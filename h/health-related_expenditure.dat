30|$|The {{findings}} of this paper suggest that the measure of services sector enters significantly positive in the growth regression of Pakistan. This implies that the services sector has {{a positive impact on}} the economic activities of Pakistan. To check the robustness of this finding, we take several business- and household-related service variables. All these variables confirm the previous results that the services-related variable enters significantly positive in the growth regression whether these are related to business or household activities like education- and <b>health-related</b> <b>expenditure.</b>|$|E

Our findings suggest that Mutuelles have been successful in increasing utilization of modern health care services and reducing catastrophic health related expenditure. According to our preferred method, higher utilization of health care services was found among the insured non-poor than insured poor households, with comparable effect in reducing <b>health-related</b> <b>expenditure</b> shocks. ...|$|E

Furthermore, there are several factors that may affect the business activities of a country, for example physical capital, trade openness and inflation. We also incorporate these variables to test the robustness of the sign and significance of services variable. The model 7 shows that the sign and significance level of services remain robust and do not alter the results. The measure of capital stock, trade openness and inflation enters in the regression according to the a priori expectation.|$|E

40|$|The {{provision}} of {{safe drinking water}} provides a dramatic example of the inherent complexity involved in incorporating environmental justice (EJ) considerations into the implementation and enforcement of new environmental standards. To promote substantive EJ, implementation policy must be concerned with the net risk reduction of new and revised regulations. The regulatory concern is that higher water bills for low-income customers of small public water systems may result in less disposable income for other health-related goods and services. In the net, this trade-off may be welfare decreasing, not increasing. Advocates of Health–Health Analysis {{have argued that the}} reduction in health-related spending creates a problem for traditional benefit-cost analysis since the long-run health implications of this reduction are not considered. The results of this investigation tend to support this contention. An evaluation of the internal structure of consumption expenditures reveals that low-expenditure households can be expected to react to an increase in the relative price of housing-related goods and services due to a water-rate hike by reducing both housing and <b>health-related</b> <b>expenditures.</b> That is, the representative low-expenditure household re-establishes equilibrium by not only decreasing housing-related spending, but also by decreasing spending on <b>health-related</b> <b>expenditures</b> in a modest but significant way. These results reflect the fact that expenditures on housing are a major proportion of overall household spending, and that accommodating drinking water surcharges exacerbates both health and food security concerns for low-expenditures households...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of <b>health-related</b> <b>expenditure</b> on {{household}} welfare in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Serbia and Kosovo, {{all of which have}} undertaken major health sector reform. Two methodologies are used: (i) the incidence and intensity of ‘catastrophic ’ health care expenditure, and (ii) {{the effect of}} out-of-pocket payments on poverty headcount and poverty gap measures. Data are drawn from the most recent Living Standards and Measurement Surveys, 2000 – 05. While our analyses are not without their limitations, and the lack of comparability across instruments precludes a direct comparison across countries, {{there is no doubt that}} health expenditure contributes substantially to the impoverishment of households—increasing the incidence of poverty and pushing poor households into deeper poverty—in each country. Both the catastrophic and the impoverishing effects of health expenditures are particularly severe in Albania and Kosovo. Transportation expenditure accounts for a large share of total health expenditures, especially in Albania and Serbia. Informal payments are substantial in all countries, and are particularly high in Albania.

40|$|Background: The health {{sector in}} Lebanon suffers from {{high levels of}} {{spending}} and is acknowledged {{to be a source}} of fiscal waste. Lebanon initiated a series of health sector reforms which aim at containing the fiscal waste caused by high and inefficient public health expenditures. Yet these reforms do not address the issues of health equity in use and coverage of healthcare services, which appear to be acute. This paper takes a closer look at the micro-level inequities in the use of healthcare, in access, in ability to pay, and in some health outcomes. Methods: We use data from the 2004 / 2005 Multi Purpose Survey of Households in Lebanon to conduct health equity analysis, including equity in need, access and outcomes. We briefly describe the data and explain some of its limitations. We examine, in turn, and using standardization techniques, the equity in health care utilization, the impact of catastrophic health payments on household wellbeing, the effect of health payment on household impoverishment, the equity implications of existing health financing methods, and health characteristics by geographical region. Results: We find that the incidence of disability decreases steadily across expenditure quintiles, whereas the incidence of chronic disease shows the opposite pattern, which may be an indication of better diagnostics for higher quintiles.

40|$|Objectives This study {{explores the}} views of older adults who are {{receiving}} health and social care {{at the end of}} their lives, on how services should be funded, and describes their <b>health-related</b> <b>expenditure.</b> Design Qualitative interview study Setting North West England Participants 30 people aged 69 – 93 years, diagnosed with lung cancer, heart failure or stroke and judged by health professionals to be in their last year of life. Sixteen participants lived in disadvantaged areas. Main outcome measures Views of older adults on funding of services. Results Participants expressed a belief in an earned entitlement to services funded from taxation, based on a broad sense of being a good citizen. Irrespective of social background, older people felt that those who could afford to pay for social care, should do so. Sale of assets and use of children's inheritance to fund care was widely perceived as an injustice. The costs of living with illness are a burden, and families are filling many of the gaps left by welfare provision. People who had worked in low-wage occupations were most concerned to justify their current acceptance of services, and distance themselves from what they described as welfare ‘spongers’ or ‘layabouts. ’ Conclusions There is a gap between the health and social care system that older adults expect and what may be provided by a reformed welfare state at a time of financial stringencies. The values that underpinned the views expressed – mutuality, care for the most needy, and the importance of working to contribute to society – are an important contribution to the debate on welfare funding...|$|E

Results: Between 2010 and 2013, a total of 41 research projects contributed data to TOPICS-MDS, resulting in preliminary data available for 32, 310 older persons and 3, 940 informal caregivers. The majority of studies sampled were from primary care settings and inclusion criteria differed across studies. Discussion: TOPICS-MDS is a public data repository which contains essential data to better understand health challenges experienced by older persons and informal caregivers.

With household panel data from 1996 - 1998, we estimated a switching regression model of a consumption Euler equation, which is augmented by endogenous credit constraints. Several empirical findings emerged. First, households coped with the negative shocks by reducing consumption of luxury items while maintaining food, education, and <b>health-related</b> <b>expenditures.</b> Second, the estimated {{results suggest that the}} standard consumption Euler equation, i. e., the necessary condition of the life-cycle permanent income hypothesis, does not hold because of binding credit constraints.

40|$|This review {{analyses}} {{the available}} {{literature on the}} economic aspects of obstructive sleep apnoea, including the indirect medical costs, the indirect nonmedical costs, the direct costs of diagnosing and treating the disease, and the utilities as perceived by patients. The philosophical context of health economics is also considered. The literature available on the economic aspects of obstructive sleep apnoea is scarce, and frequently incomplete, so that only tentative conclusions can be reached. Obstructive sleep apnoea seems to lead to measurable (about two-fold) increases in indirect medical costs. Moreover, this excess cost seems to be reduced {{in the first years}} following the institution of treatment with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP). There are also indirect nonmedical costs linked to the disease, for example traffic, domestic and workplace accidents. The exact extent of these costs is, however, impossible to ascertion from the available literature. Cost/utility analysis has shown full-night polysomnography to be the diagnostic approach with the higher cost/utility ratio, because diagnostic errors (greater with other approaches) carry a disproportionate weight. The cost of treating the disease has not been thoroughly assessed but appears as quite reasonable, and certainly not excessive. Finally, one study has shown in patients with severe sleep apnoea that treatment with nCPAP has a favourable effect when measured as quality adjusted life years. It is concluded that obstructive sleep apnoea leads to an excess in <b>health-related</b> <b>expenditure,</b> that treatment with nasal continuous positive airway pressure reduces this excess cost and thus makes sense in economic terms, and that patients believe nasal continuous positive airway pressure treatment to be worth considering for economic reasons. It is further concluded that medical decisions should be guided by medical (not economic) considerations, even if it is acknowledged that, for the time being, economic analysis is necessary to to convince health managers that obstructive sleep apnoea is also worth considering from the economic point of view...|$|E
40|$|There is {{sufficient}} {{evidence to prove}} that the improved health status of a nation’s citizens results in economic growth and development via improved functionality and productivity of labor. It is also commonly accepted that healthcare expenditure significantly influences health status through, for instance, improving life expectancy at birth and reducing morbidity, death, and infant mortality rates. Within healthcare, medicines account for a considerable share of <b>health-related</b> <b>expenditure</b> in both developed and developing countries. Therefore, it seems reasonable to assume that improved access to medicines is likely to contribute not only to the well-being of families and individuals but also to the economic growth and development in all societies. It has been widely advocated that pharmaceutical multinational enterprises (MNEs) can play an important role to address this problem, as they develop and supply a significant proportion of the drugs imported by low- and middle-income countries. This chapter is dedicated to a systematic review of literature in order to identify the strategies implemented by pharmaceutical MNEs to improve access to medicines in the low- and middle-income countries. A total of 76 research articles have been identified, and we have found that the main strategies of pharmaceutical MNEs are related to improving health outcomes through R&D, establishing partnerships for product development, pricing strategies to improve access to medicines, technology transfer, licensing agreements, and nonmarket efforts to improve access to medicines, among other strategies to overcome barriers imposed by intellectual property rights. We have also found that pharmaceutical MNEs’ strategies take place within a complex system and often involve interactions {{with a wide range of}} actors, such as international organizations, governments, private not-for-profit sector, universities and research institutes, and generic manufacturers. However, there is still a need for major progress in the field of access to medicines, and pharmaceutical MNEs should be more active in this field in order to avoid potential negative consequences, such as loss of legitimacy and compulsory licensing of their patented medicines...|$|E

Yet these reforms do not address the issues of health equity in use and coverage of healthcare services, which appear to be acute. This paper takes a closer look at the micro-level inequities in the use of healthcare, in access, in ability to pay, and in some health outcomes. Methods We use data from the 2004 / 2005 Multi Purpose Survey of Households in Lebanon to conduct health equity analysis, including equity in need, access and outcomes. We briefly describe the data and explain some of its limitations. We examine, in turn, and using standardization techniques, the equity in health care utilization, the impact of catastrophic health payments on household wellbeing, the effect of health payment on household impoverishment, the equity implications of existing health financing methods, and health characteristics by geographical region. Results We find that the incidence of disability decreases steadily across expenditure quintiles, whereas the incidence of chronic disease shows the opposite pattern, which may be an indication of better diagnostics for higher quintiles. The presence of any <b>health-related</b> <b>expenditure</b> is regressive while the magnitude of out-of-pocket expenditures on health is progressive. Spending on health is found to be "normal" and income-elastic. Catastrophic health payments are likelier among disadvantaged groups (in terms of income, geography and gender). However, the cash amounts of catastrophic payments are progressive. Poverty is associated with lower insurance coverage for both private and public insurance. While the insured seem to spend an average of almost LL 93, 000 ($ 62) on health a year in excess of the uninsured, they devote a smaller proportion of their expenditures to health. Conclusions The lowest quintiles of expenditures per adult have less of an ability to pay out-of-pocket for healthcare, and yet incur healthcare expenditures more often than the wealthy. They have lower rates of insurance coverage, causing them to spend a larger proportion of their expenditures on health, and further confirming our results on the vulnerability of the bottom quintiles. </p...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} impact of {{droughts}} on health outcomes and health expenditures in rural Vietnam. Given the increasing frequency of extreme weather events in Vietnam and many developing countries, it is crucial for policy makers {{to be aware of}} the economic impact of such shocks at the micro level. Using local rainfall data, the analysis directly links the incidence of drought to health shocks and <b>health-related</b> <b>expenditures</b> from a multiple-wave panel of rural Vietnamese households. Overall, the results suggest that individuals affected by drought display a deterioration of health conditions and have significantly higher health expenditures. The effect is found to prevail among households with a high degree of agricultural dependency and limited access to coping mechanisms such as selling assets or tapping off-farm income sources. The preferred estimates using an IV strategy reveal that drought-related health shocks can cause non-negligible additional financial burden for many households vulnerable to poverty in rural Vietnam. This paper quantifies the immediate impact of drought on health conditions and contributes to the existing literature which has mostly focused on the long-term consequences...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Non-communicable {{diseases}} (NCD) {{accounts for}} more than a third (37 %) of all deaths in South Africa. However, this burden of disease can be reduced by addressing risk factors. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the health and risk profile of South African employees presenting for health risk assessments and to measure their readiness to change and improve lifestyle behaviour. METHODS: Employees (n = 1954) from 18 companies were invited to take part in a wellness day, which included a health-risk assessment. Self-reported health behaviour and health status was recorded. Clinical measures included cholesterol finger-prick test, blood pressure and Body Mass Index (BMI). Health-related age was calculated using an algorithm incorporating the relative risk for all case mortality associated with smoking, physical activity, fruit and vegetable intake, BMI and cholesterol. Medical claims data were obtained from the health insurer. RESULTS: The mean percentage of participation was 26 % (n = 1954) and ranged from 4 % in transport to 81 % in the consulting sector. Health-related age (38. 5 +/- 12. 9 years) was significantly higher than chronological age (34. 9 +/- 10. 3 yrs) (p < 0. 001). Both chronological and risk-related age were significantly different between the sectors (P < 0. 001), with the manufacturing sector being the oldest and finance having the youngest employees. Health-related age was significantly associated with number of days adversely affected by mental and physical health, days away from work and total annual medical costs (p < 0. 001). Employees had higher rates of overweight, smoking among men, and physical inactivity (total sample) when compared the general SA population. Increased <b>health-related</b> <b>expenditure</b> was associated with increased number of risk factors, absenteeism and reduced physical activity. CONCLUSION: SA employees' health and lifestyle habits are placing them at increased risk for NCD's, suggesting that they may develop NCD's earlier than expected. Inter-sectoral differences for health-related age might provide insight into those companies which have the greatest need for interventions, and may also assist in predicting future medical expenditure. This study underscores the importance of determining the health and risk status of employees which could assist in identifying the appropriate interventions to reduce the risk of NCD's among employees...|$|E
40|$|Health {{is deemed}} central to a nation’s development. Accordingly, {{health care reform}} and {{expansion}} are key policy priorities in developing countries. Many such nations are now testing various methods of funding and delivering health care to local disadvantaged populations. Similarly, India launched the Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY) national health insurance programme for low-income groups in 2008. The RSBY intends preventing catastrophic <b>health-related</b> <b>expenditure</b> by improving recipients’ access to hospital-based care. This thesis is an in-depth qualitative evaluation of the RSBY in Delhi state. It examines the RSBY’s effectiveness in fulfilling its goals and meeting local health care needs. Walt and Gilson’s (1994) actors-content-process-context model informs the research design and an actor-centred “responsive” (Stake 1975) or “constructivist” approach guides data analysis. Three research questions are examined: (i). Why was a health insurance programme launched and why now? Why was this model favoured over alternate methods of service expansion? (ii). Is the RSBY delivered as intended? If not, why? (iii) How does the RSBY affect patients’ access to services? The findings are based on documentary sources, observation of implementation sites and activities and 164 semi-structured interviews with RSBY policymakers, insurers, NGOs, doctors, and patients. The results show improved access to curative and surgical care for RSBY patients. However, RSBY’s focus on hospitalisation and omission of primary and outpatient services had undesired negative effects. The lack of ambulatory facilities led RSBY patients to self-medicate or use dubious quality informal providers. By only allowing inpatient care, the RSBY also seemingly encouraged the substitution of outpatient care with costlier hospitalisations. In effect, the RSBY’s design contributed to cost increases and poor patient outcomes. While more funds and human resources were needed to improve RSBY implementation, the performance of frontline agencies could potentially improve through more stable, longer-term contracts. Similarly, modifying RSBY’s monetary incentives for doctors may lead to better service delivery by them. By evaluating the RSBY’s strong points and shortcomings, this thesis provides key lessons on strengthening policy design and health service delivery in developing countries. Thereby, it makes a broader {{contribution to understanding the}} determinants of successful policymaking. This thesis is not currently available in ORA...|$|E
40|$|Health {{services}} in the Republic of South Africa (RSA) are provided by a mixture {{of public and private}} providers and institutions. Estimates of total <b>health-related</b> <b>expenditure</b> for 1985 range between 5. 3 % and 5. 9 % of gross national product (GNP), divided on approximately a 55 : 45 basis between public and private sectors. Basic preventive and curative services are provided by a hospital- and clinic-based public system. The public system does not adequately serve the rural areas and African tribal bantustans, and racial discrimination and/or segregation are obvious in its organisation and funding. The public sector's strength is the provision of state-subsidised care to many citizens who are unable to afford private medicine. The vast majority of hospitals are operated on a non-profit basis by government, industries, and voluntary agencies. Excluding hospitals that receive state subsidies, private investor-owned hospitals control about 10 % of all hospital beds in the RSA. One-third of these investor-owned beds are held by state-dependent contractors providing long-term care. Two-thirds are wholly independent. Growth has been rapid in the independent hospital sector, and major corporations have entered the market. In 1985, over 85 % of the white population was privately insured by a variety of prepayment programmes, including those organised through parastatal corporations and government departments. Despite major enrolment growth in the preceding decade, only 8 % of blacks held private insurance by 1985; their coverage also tended to be less comprehensive. Faced with deficit financing, a sluggish economy, complaints from its white constituency about taxation levels, and pressure from private sector interest groups, the Nationalist government has endorsed the concept of privatisation of health care. Exponents of privatisation claim that it will permit differentiation by income to supplant discrimination by race. However, the direct links between disposable income and race, the rapidly rising costs of private insurance, and the still-limited extent of private coverage among the black majority, indicate that privatisation is likely to co-opt a comparatively small proportion of the total black population. It may exacerbate the urban-rural imbalance in health status and health services, promote growth of hospital-intensive curative services rather than needed expansion of community-centred preventive and primary care, and create financial barriers to access for low-income patients. Lastly, private sector expense data suggest that privatisation is likely to save costs only for those among the elite, mainly white, who currently pay more in taxes than they use in public health care resources. privatisation South African health services health policy private health insurance health care financing...|$|E
40|$|The Philippines {{is one of}} the few {{countries}} where decentralization in the delivery of local anti-poverty programs can result in the reduction of targeting failures that characterize traditional delivery mechanisms of centralized bureaucracies. Here, the primary challenge for the health sector is in identifying ways to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of health-service delivery for illness, particularly those related to catastrophic disease management. On the one hand, devolution highlights both the limited resources and weak capacity of local government. A rationalized health service delivery system is expected to lead to efficiency gains. Improved coverage under health equity mechanisms (through social health insurance) would reduce household health care cost, particularly against illness and disaster, which further aggravate poverty. Against the background of persistent poverty and unacceptable mortality levels, the present study evaluates the health equity mechanism and its innovativeness, as well as other home-grown programs. The study explores how such programs can contribute to achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) in addressing ill health and catastrophic <b>health-related</b> <b>expenditures</b> in the Philippines. The study also presents an extensive review, impact evaluation, and cost-effective analyses of on-going programs on “catastrophic health expenditures and poverty ” and “reducing poverty resulting from ill-health ” that are supported by health-equity mechanisms in the region...|$|R

40|$|Background: Economic {{growth in}} low- and middle-income {{countries}} (LMIC) has raised interest in how disease burden patterns {{are related to}} economic development. Meanwhile, poverty-related diseases {{are considered to be}} neglected in terms of research and development (R&D). Objectives: Developing intuitive and meaningful metrics to measure how different diseases are related to poverty and neglected in the current R&D system. Design: We measured how diseases are related to economic development with the income relation factor (IRF), defined by the ratio of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) per 100, 000 inhabitants in LMIC versus that in high-income countries. We calculated the IRF for 291 diseases and injuries and 67 risk factors included in the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010. We measured neglect in R&D with the neglect factor (NF), defined by the ratio of disease burden in DALYs (as percentage of the total global disease burden) and R&D expenditure (as percentage of total global <b>health-related</b> R&D <b>expenditure)</b> for 26 diseases. Results: The disease burden varies considerably with the level of economic development, shown by the IRF (median: 1. 38; interquartile range (IQR) : 0. 79 – 6. 3). Comparison of IRFs from 1990 to 2010 highlights general patterns of the global epidemiological transition. The 26 poverty-related diseases included in our analysis of neglect in R&D are responsible for 13. 8 % of the global disease burden, but receive only 1. 34 % of global <b>health-related</b> R&D <b>expenditure.</b> Within this group, the NF varies considerably (median: 19; IQR: 6 – 52). Conclusions: The IRF is an intuitive and meaningful metric to highlight shifts in global disease burden patterns. A large shortfall exists in global R&D spending for poverty-related and neglected diseases, with strong variations between diseases...|$|R

Performance of randomized controlled drug trials (drugRCTs) adds to the scientific output, scientific knowledge, scientific training and up-to-date status of healthcare and may drive economy. The {{purpose of this study was}} to benchmark Europe's position on drugRCTs relative to the rest of the world, and to identify factors that may drive this performance. The number of scientific publications on drugRCTs, indexed in PubMed and Thomson Scientific/Web of Science database over the period 1995 - 2004, was used as a proxy measure for the quantitative drugRCT output. The international citation impact of these publications was used as a proxy measure for the qualitative drugRCT output. Country's origin of 103 211 publications was determined. After adjustment for population size, the number of drugRCT publications from Europe, USA and Australia/Japan was 102, 124 and 44 publications per million inhabitants, respectively. The proportional increase in publication output from 1995 until 2004 was lower in Europe compared with the USA and Australia/Japan (29. 1, 40. 1 and 63. 4 %, respectively). The number of citations per publication was 4. 9 in Europe, 7. 0 in the USA and 3. 4 in Australia/Japan. Within Europe, the UK, Germany and Italy produced most publications. Country-specific factors associated with publication output in Europe were the number of pharmaceutical companies with headquarters in a country (R- 2 = 0. 71, P < 0. 001), national R&D expenditures by pharmaceutical companies (R- 2 = 0. 63, P < 0. 001) and <b>health-related</b> R&D <b>expenditures</b> by national governments (R- 2 = 0. 22, P = 0. 052). When adjusted for population size, quantitative and qualitative performance of drugRCTs in Europe lags behind the USA but is ahead of Australia/Japan. Several factors appear to explain the differences, among which are the number of headquarters of pharmaceutical companies in a country, the research expenditures by pharmaceutical companies, as well as <b>health-related</b> R&D <b>expenditures</b> of a country. To enhance and strengthen Europe's position, researchers may strengthen their collaborations with local pharmaceutical companies, and national governments could increase their budgets for medical research funding...|$|R
40|$|Background: As {{compared}} to other countries in South East Asia, India's {{health care system is}} characterized by very high out of pocket payments, and consequently low financial protection and access to care. This paper describes the relative importance of ill-health {{compared to}} other adverse events, the conduits through which ill-health affects household welfare and the coping strategies used to finance these expenses. Methods: Cross-sectional data are used from a survey conducted with 5241 households in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in 2010 that included a household shocks module and detailed information about health care use and spending. Results: Health-related adverse events were the second most common adverse events (34 %), after natural disasters (51 %). Crop and livestock disease and weddings each affected about 8 % of households. Only a fourth of households reported to have recovered from illness and/or death in the family (by the time of the survey). Most of the households' economic burden related to ill-health was depending on direct medical costs, but indirect costs (such as lost earnings and transportation or food costs) were also not negligible. Close to half of the health expenditures were made for chronic conditions. Households tried to cope with <b>health-related</b> <b>expenditures</b> mostly by dissaving, borrowing and selling assets. Few households reported having to reduce (food) consumption in response to ill-health. Conclusions: In the absence of pre-financing schemes, ill-health events pose a substantial threat to household welfare in rural India. While most households {{seem to be able to}} smooth consumption in the short term, coping strategies like selling assets and borrowing from moneylenders are likely to have severe long term consequences. As most of the households' economic risk related to ill-health appears to depend on out of pocket spending, introducing health insurance may contribute significantly to alleviate economic hardship for families in rural India. The importance of care for chronic diseases, however, represents a big challenge for the sustainability of community based health insurance schemes, since it is necessary to ensure a sufficient degree of risk pooling...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{increased}} smoking prevalence in {{some parts}} of the world, particularly in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs) is a major concern among tobacco control advocates and governments. The higher smoking-related disease prevalence associated with this is expected to fall among the sub-populations least able to pay for healthcare services in LMICs. This, in turn, will perpetuate the vicious cycle of poverty and disease. The current study contributes to developing an understanding of the socioeconomic disparities in smoking in Namibia and their potential association with per capita <b>health-related</b> <b>expenditures.</b> Method: Data from the Namibia 2013 Demographic and Health Survey, a nationally representative survey, are used in the study. Three main variables for healthcare costs are constructed, namely out-patient disease (OPD) costs, inpatient disease (IPD) costs and total out of pocket (OOP) payments. Concentration curves and indices are estimated for all three variables as well as for smoking intensity and smoking prevalence. Further, three Tobit regression models are run to examine the associations of the different healthcare costs with smoking intensity. Results: The concentration index of smoking prevalence is estimated at - 0. 05 compared to - 0. 18 for smoking intensity. Thus, both smoking prevalence and smoking intensity, in relation to their socioeconomic status, are concentrated among the poor. In contrast, the concentration index of OPD healthcare costs is calculated at 0. 34 compared to 0. 65 for IPD healthcare costs reflecting disproportionately higher healthcare costs among the rich. The concentration index of the overall total annual OOP payments is 0. 55. Tobit regression analysis, however, does not find any statistically significant relationship between the smoking intensity and the amount spent on health care costs, regardless of whether these were IPD, OPD healthcare costs or total OOP payments. Conclusion: Namibia's current policies on demand reducing tobacco control policies can be strengthened by these findings. Smoking is an important determinant of several non-communicable diseases and has the potential to exacerbate health care costs across socioeconomic strata. Understanding the socioeconomic disparities in smoking is imperative for developing appropriate interventions against smoking...|$|R
