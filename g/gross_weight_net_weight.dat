40|$|Soil {{degradation}} is {{a growing}} problem worldwide because it reduces the fertile top layer of the soil available for food production and one such degradative action is soil erosion due to the harvesting of crops. Soil loss due to crop harvesting with particular reference to yam tubers has not been quantified globally {{despite the fact that}} yam is a major staple food consumed worldwide and it is prevalent in many parts of Nigeria. Harvesting yams in our environment is usually done with the soil attached to the yams {{due to the fact that}} farmers do not want additional work of removing soil attached to the yams. This study investigates the soil physical properties that influence soil loss due to yam harvesting in Abeokuta, South-Western Nigeria and to assess the quantity of soil loss due to yam harvesting. Based on representative sampling area per location, yam tubers were harvested manually within the entire yam farmland from October to December 2012. <b>Gross</b> <b>weight,</b> <b>net</b> <b>weight</b> and the amount of soil adhering to the yams were measured. Effects of soil physical properties such as soil moisture content, heap bulk density, inter-heap bulk density and soil texture were investigated with respect to soil losses. The results showed that moisture content ranged from 4 % to 15 %, heap bulk density ranged from 0. 93 to 1. 29  g cm− 3 and inter-heap bulk density ranged from 1. 03 to 1. 50  g cm− 3. They all had a positive correlation with soil loss. Soil particle size analysis for Federal University of Agricultural, Abeokuta (FUNAAB) and Alabata revealed that sand content was (86. 78 % and 88. 32 %), clay content (10. 69 % and 7. 6 %) and silt content, (2. 53 % and 4. 08 %) respectively. Study also revealed that clay content of the soil positively influenced the total soil loss during the yam harvesting. The mean soil losses in Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta (FUNAAB) and Alabata village yam farms were 4303 and 2125  kg/ha/harvest respectively. The study also revealed that soil moisture content at harvesting time and clay content are the key factors affecting soil loss due to yam harvesting. Consequently, soil loss due to crop harvesting should be considered in soil erosion control strategies, sediment budget and for better post harvest procedures...|$|E

The paper demonstrates that the interaction between people is an important aspect of the information process, which is often neglected in the literature.

New tillers of endophyte-infected and endophyte-free plants were planted in the field according to a complete block design with three replications. The traits including days to head emergence, days to 50 % anthesis, days to maturity initiation, number of heads (as a weekly measurement), total seed <b>weight,</b> <b>net</b> seed <b>weight</b> and empty seed weigh were measured. Results showed that endophytes can enhance head emergence, maturity initiation and periodical seed yield. Days to 50 % anthesis, and days to maturity initiation were also reduced.

Increase in net seed yield may show some physiological alterations in plant such as hormonal balance alteration which may provide better seed setting in infected plants.

40|$|Abstract — <b>Net</b> <b>weighting</b> {{is a key}} {{technique}} in timing driven placement (TDP), which {{plays a crucial role}} for deep submiron VLSI physical synthesis and timing closure. A popular way to assign <b>net</b> <b>weight</b> is based on its slack, such that the worst negative slack (WNS) of the entire circuit may be minimized. While WNS is an important optimization metric, another figure of merit (FOM), defined as the total slack difference compared to a certain slack threshold for all timing end points, is of equivalent importance to measure the overall timing closure result for highly complex modern ASIC and microprocessor designs. Moreover, to optimally assign <b>net</b> <b>weight</b> for timing closure, the effect of <b>net</b> <b>weighting</b> on timing should be carefully studied. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the wire length, slack and FOM sensitivities to the <b>net</b> <b>weight,</b> and propose a new <b>net</b> <b>weighting</b> scheme based on those sensitivities. Such sensitivity analysis implicitly takes potential physical synthesis effect into consideration.

40|$|<b>Net</b> <b>weighting</b> for timing-driven {{placement}} {{has been}} very popular in industry and academia.

Experimental data shows that compared with the weighting algorithm used in state-of-the-art FPGA placement package VPR[1], this new algorithm can achieve the longest path delay reduction of up to 38. 8 %, 15. 6 % on average with no runtime overhead and only a 4. 1 % increase in total wirelength. ...|$|R

Accordingly, we evaluated whether preconception body weight and weight gain during pregnancy influence the sex ratio of human offspring. METHODS:A retrospective study was performed on 10 239 births in 1997 - 2001. Time of conception, preconception body <b>weight</b> and <b>net</b> <b>weight</b> gain during pregnancy were obtained for 9284 pregnancies. RESULTS:The secondary sex ratio of mothers in the lowest quartile of pre-pregnancy body weight (< 54. 6 kg) was lower than that of the other three quartiles (0. 497 versus 0. 525; P < 0. 01). In contrast, the sex ratio of children born by the women in the highest quartile of weight gain during pregnancy appeared lower than that of the first three quartiles (0. 493 versus 0. 516; P = 0. 054). CONCLUSIONS:A low pre-pregnancy weight and a greater weight gain during pregnancy are both associated with a reduced secondary sex ratio. These data indicate that in women with non-optimal reproductive/metabolic conditions, a greater attrition is exerted on male than on female offspring...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to examine {{information}} use and information literacy {{in the context of}} weight management. It reports on a two-year study funded by the Department of Health known informally as the <b>Net.</b> <b>Weight</b> Study. <b>Net.</b> <b>Weight</b> examined the potential for increased, innovative and effective uses of information and communication technologies (ICTs) to support the self management of weight. The research was conducted in the city of Brighton & Hove by an inter-disciplinary team from the University of Brighton. The paper gives a brief overview of the various methods used in the study as a whole but discusses one strand, the user survey, in more detail. The survey gathered data on people’s information and ICT use around weight management. The design of the survey questionnaire required the adaptation of existing literacy assessment instruments and this process is described in this paper. The findings show that people use a wide range of information sources for information and support around weight management. The most useful sources are slimming groups, food packaging, friends and family, magazines, TV and health books, thus representing a variety of media, formal and informal, and including human sources. The internet was reported to be a useful source for around half the survey respondents and is most often used for information about diet and exercise. A majority of respondents described themselves as active information seekers and confident about their information skills. They are less confident about internet information than information generally and even less confident about using the internet to support weight management activities. The concept of literacies, particularly around information and health, provide a framework for examining the <b>Net.</b> <b>Weight</b> findings. The findings are discussed in terms of their implications for health information policy and for those interested in applying information literacy theory to health. The role of healthcare practitioners in weight management information is addressed, as is the need for targeted rather than generic health information. It is suggested that the work done in the education sector to increase awareness of information literacy and improve skills could provide a useful model of good practice in a health context. However, the evidence provided by the <b>Net.</b> <b>Weight</b> study suggests that for such an approach to be relevant it needs to reflect the complexity of health information processes in everyday lives...|$|R
