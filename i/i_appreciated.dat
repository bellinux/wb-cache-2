25|$|I confess that, as {{a student}} unaware {{of the history of}} the subject and unaware of the {{connection}} with cyclotomy, I did not find the law or its so-called elementary proofs appealing. I suppose, although I would not have (and could not have) expressed myself in this way that I saw it as little more than a mathematical curiosity, fit more for amateurs than for the attention of the serious mathematician that I then hoped to become. It was only in Hermann Weyl's book on the algebraic theory of numbers that <b>I</b> <b>appreciated</b> it as anything more.|$|E
500|$|Director Mark Romanek {{has said}} that, {{as in the}} novel, {{everyone}} has to uncover their relationship to our own mortality; we have two options: either go against it, or {{try to figure out}} a way around it like the character Tommy does. Romanek hoped the audience of Never Let Me Go would be reminded of what is important: love, behaviour, and friendships. He recalled an email a person had written to him: [...] "I saw your film and it made me cry and I haven't reacted to a film emotionally like that in years. And I called my father, cause I realized I hadn’t spoken to him in 3 weeks and I told him how much I love him and how much <b>I</b> <b>appreciated</b> what a good father he's been." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{previous}} poet laureate, Gerald Stern, {{said that}} he advocated for Baraka's selection because he [...] "thought {{it was important for}} the black community to get recognition." [...] Slate.com political reporter David Weigel said that McGreevey's selection of Baraka [...] "was a no-brainer—he was a sort of icon, and a major figure within a constituency McGreevey counted on". At a ceremony in August 2002, Baraka warned McGreevey that the decision to appoint him as poet laureate might be a mistake because of his controversial views, saying [...] "You're gonna catch hell for this". After Baraka's death in January 2014, McGreevey said, [...] "I named him poet laureate because <b>I</b> <b>appreciated</b> his art, his intelligence and his creative energy. I’ve always had great personal affect(ion) for him and recognized him as a gifted creative force." ...|$|E

500|$|Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel gave Captain America: The First Avenger a {{positive}} review, saying, [...] "Johnston has delivered a light, clever and deftly balanced adventure picture with real lump {{in the throat}} nostalgia, with Nazis – who make the best villains, and with loving references to Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times remarked, [...] "I enjoyed the movie. <b>I</b> <b>appreciated</b> the 1940s period settings and costumes, which were a break with the usual generic cityscapes. I admired the way that director Joe Johnston propelled the narrative. I {{got a sense of}} a broad story, rather than the impression of a series of sensational set pieces. If Marvel is wise, it will take this and Iron Man as its templates". A. O. Scott of The New York Times declared it [...] "pretty good fun".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode an 8 out of 10, indicating {{that it was}} [...] "great". While calling Veronica [...] "not likable at all" [...] in the episode, he praised {{the second half of}} the episode, particularly the final sequence involving a drugged Veronica. He wrote, [...] "Veronica Mars seems to slowly be getting back on track. There are still some problems to be sure, but this week's episode was a good one, and most notably, built towards some very strong scenes in the second half." [...] Price Peterson, writing for TV.com, was also positive towards the episode, writing [...] "This was good! I liked all of the scenes of Piz sleeping on the floor. And as much as it freaks me out to see Veronica in harm's way (I shouldn't be watching TV, apparently), <b>I</b> <b>appreciated</b> the forward momentum in this plotline." [...] Television Without Pity gave the episode an [...] "A".|$|E
500|$|Critics adulated the {{character}} development of Rick Grimes, {{as well as}} the concluding scene of [...] "Nebraska". Kine appreciated the attempt to incorporate a suspenseful feeling in the series. She wrote: [...] "Mazzara wants to infuse some horror movie suspense back into the show and his intentions are evident in this scene. Even though I personally didn’t find it that tense, <b>I</b> <b>appreciated</b> the effort. It means that the show is trying to expand and become about something bigger." [...] Los Angeles Times Gina McIntyre felt that Rick emulated Justified character Raylan Givens, and Halden commented that Rick was becoming [...] "something of a badass". Halden further praised the conclusion of the episode, calling it the series' best scenes. [...] "This {{is one of the best}} scenes I’ve seen on the show so far, and it does any number of things that The Walking Dead has struggled with in the past," [...] he opined. [...] "The tension builds naturally , the dialogue has actual subtext, and there’s a clear sense of risk here that never pauses to telegraph itself." [...] Meslow affirmed that the scene was an achievement for the writers. [...] "There are characters with new information ," [...] Meslow commented. [...] "There is dialogue with subtext [...] There is intriguing parallel plotting [...] And there's the surprisingly swift, violent dénouement, when Rick guns down Dave and Tony before they can do the same to him. It's a necessary action, given the circumstances, but it also rings in an honest-to-god character change for our hero, who, having dispatched zombie Sophia, seems to have developed a new recognition of the ruthlessness and self-centeredness it may take to survive in this new world order." [...] HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall appreciated James' performance, and opined that the scene was [...] "as suspenseful as any the show has ever done featuring actual monsters".|$|E

2500|$|President Barack Obama: He [...] {{was as much}} a part of the Senate as {{the marble}} busts that line its chamber and its corridors. His {{profound}} passion for that body and its role and responsibilities was as evident behind closed doors as it was in the stemwinders he peppered with history. He held the deepest respect of members of both parties, and he was generous with his time and advice, something <b>I</b> <b>appreciated</b> greatly as a young senator.|$|E

2500|$|The term {{also has}} {{economic}} connotations. For instance, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton outlined the downturn {{of the global}} financial crisis {{and its effect on}} Pakistan especially {{in the context of the}} war against militancy: [...] "this economic crisis, left unresolved, will create massive unemployment. It will upend governments, it will, unfortunately, breed instability... <b>I</b> <b>appreciated</b> putting that into the context of the Threat Matrix, because look at Pakistan, a country that we know has to be stabilized for the benefit of not only South Asia, but beyond." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{you lose}} your {{confidence}} you don't want to bowl again. When I went on the West Indies tour I had no confidence, even though I got 17 wickets {{at an average of}} about 25, and 10 of them were in first-class games. I only bowled about 78 overs on tour. When {{you lose your}} confidence it's not a nice feeling – you can't do what you used to do, but I'm only sorry it was the wrong day at the wrong time , because if I was myself, I assure you, in my opinion, I would have played more Test cricket, but that's only my assumption. <b>I</b> <b>appreciated</b> the experience , but after three months with no confidence [...] I was pleased to get back home.|$|E
2500|$|While Andy Travis {{received}} {{his name and}} some personality elements from a cousin of creator Hugh Wilson, he was based primarily on innovative program director Mikel Herrington, who also was {{the inspiration for the}} character Jeff Dugan in the 1978 film FM, written by Ezra Sacks who had worked at KMET. Dr. Johnny Fever was based on a DJ named [...] "Skinny" [...] Bobby Harper at WQXI/790 in Atlanta, Georgia (in 1968). WKRP writer Bill Dial worked with Harper at WQXI, which is considered Dial's inspiration for the show. Coincidentally, Harper had previously worked at Cincinnati AM Top 40 powerhouse WSAI in 1964, before moving to 11 other stations, including seven in Atlanta. In 1997, Bobby Harper told WSB's Condace Pressley, [...] "He went on record as pointing out which ones, including myself, that he based the characters on. [...] was a nice little thing. You know? That was nice. <b>I</b> <b>appreciated</b> that." ...|$|E

2500|$|With the {{intention}} of counteracting the [...] "star" [...] cult faction that had begun to form around him, Clapton assembled a new band composed of Delaney and Bonnie's former rhythm section, Bobby Whitlock as keyboardist and vocalist, Carl Radle as the bassist, and drummer Jim Gordon, with Clapton playing guitar. It was his intention {{to show that he}} need not fill a starring role, and functioned well as a member of an ensemble. During this period, Clapton was increasingly influenced by The Band and their album Music from Big Pink, saying, [...] "What <b>I</b> <b>appreciated</b> about the Band was that they were more concerned with songs and singing. They would have three- and four-part harmonies, and the guitar was put back into perspective as being accompaniment. That suited me well, because I had gotten so tired of the virtuosity—or pseudo-virtuosity—thing of long, boring guitar solos just because they were expected. The Band brought things back into perspective. The priority was the song." ...|$|E
2500|$|From London, Wild had {{obtained}} an assistant research officer {{job with the}} Council for Scientific and Industrial Research at the Radiophysics Laboratory near Sydney. He described the position as [...] "a humble one": to maintain and develop test equipment. But within a year he had, as he put it, [...] "wheedled his way" [...] into the new science of radio astronomy, and he described 1948–50 as a tremendously exciting time.... The only two really powerful groups in radio astronomy were the Australian one and Cambridge; and... we all thought we had the edge over the Cambridge group. [...] Joe Pawsey {{was the sort of}} father of radio astronomy in Australia. He was a wonderfully inspiring leader, very self-effacing and taking no credit for himself, and he was a delight to work under. And he did something which <b>I</b> <b>appreciated</b> greatly: he left me alone to do my own research but I could come to him at any time and get his advice.This advice, Wild acknowledged, [...] "was often very perceptive, very good". Pawsey’s approach became a template that Wild would follow.|$|E
2500|$|Robbins {{directed}} two episodes {{from the}} HBO series Treme. The series follows the interconnected {{lives of a}} group of New Orleanians in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. He helmed the episodes [...] "Everything I Do Gonh Be Funky" [...] in Season 2 (2011) and [...] "Promised Land" [...] in Season 3 (2012). Robbins became interested in the show while staying in New Orleans during the filming of Green Lantern. [...] "I had the unique experience of watching ‘Treme’ with locals. It resonated for me immediately, and it resonated for them as well, because they have seen their town get misinterpreted and represented in ridiculous ways," [...] he told The Times-Picayune in 2011. “Something about this show was different for them. <b>I</b> <b>appreciated</b> that. I loved the writing and the actors. I loved the environment it’s set in. I watched the whole first season in New Orleans, and got in touch with David Simon and said, ‘If you guys need a director next year, I’d be happy to do an episode.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Davis {{learned to}} dance {{from his father}} and his [...] "uncle" [...] Will Mastin. Davis joined the act as a child and they became the Will Mastin Trio. Throughout his career, Davis {{included}} the Will Mastin Trio in his billing. Mastin and his father shielded him from racism, such as by explaining race-based snubs as jealousy. However, when Davis served in the United States Army during World War II, he was confronted by strong prejudice. He later said: [...] "Overnight the world looked different. It wasn't one color any more. I could see the protection I'd gotten all my life from my father and Will. <b>I</b> <b>appreciated</b> their loving hope that I'd never need to know about prejudice and hate, but they were wrong. It was as if I'd walked through a swinging door for 18 years, a door which they had always secretly held open." [...] At age 7 Davis played the title role in the film Rufus Jones for President, in which he sang and danced with Ethel Waters. He lived for several years in Boston's South End, and reminisced years later about [...] "hoofing and singing" [...] at Izzy Ort's Bar & Grille.|$|E
2500|$|Vice President Joe Biden {{recalled}} Byrd's {{standing in}} the rain with him as Biden buried his daughter when Biden had just been elected to the Senate. He called Byrd [...] "a tough, compassionate, and outspoken leader and dedicated above all else to making life better {{for the people of}} the Mountain State." [...] President Barack Obama said, [...] "His profound passion for that body and its role and responsibilities was as evident behind closed doors as it was in the stemwinders he peppered with history. He held the deepest respect of members of both parties, and he was generous with his time and advice, something <b>I</b> <b>appreciated</b> greatly as a young senator." [...] Senator Jay Rockefeller, who had served with Byrd since 1985, said, [...] "I looked up to him, I fought next to him, and I am deeply saddened that he is gone." [...] Former President Jimmy Carter noted, [...] "He was my closest and most valuable adviser while I served as president. I respected him and attempted in every way to remain in his good graces. He was a giant among legislators, and was courageous in espousing controversial issues." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas {{underwent}} preview test screenings – {{a process}} that Gilliam does not enjoy. [...] "I always get very tense in those (test screenings), because I'm ready to fight. I know the pressure from the studio is, 'somebody didn't like that, change it! The filmmaker {{said that it was}} important to him that Thompson like the film and recalls the writer's reaction at a screening, [...] "Hunter watched it for the first time at the premiere and he was making all this fucking noise! Apparently it all came flooding back to him, he was reliving the whole trip! He was yelling out and jumping on his seat like it was a roller coaster, ducking and diving, shouting 'SHIT! LOOK OUT! GODDAMN BATS!' That was fantastic – if he thought we'd captured it, then we must have done it!" [...] Thompson himself stated, [...] "Yeah, I liked it. It's not my show, but <b>I</b> <b>appreciated</b> it. Depp did a hell of a job. His narration is what really held the film together, I think. If you hadn't had that, it would have just been a series of wild scenes." ...|$|E
