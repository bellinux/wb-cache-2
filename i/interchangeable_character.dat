2500|$|While {{this word}} jiajie {{dates from the}} Han Dynasty, the related term tongjia (通假 tōngjiǎ [...] "interchangeable borrowing") is first attested from the Ming Dynasty. The two terms are {{commonly}} used as synonyms, {{but there is a}} linguistic distinction between jiajiezi being a phonetic loan character for a word that did not originally have a character, such as using [...] "a bag tied at both ends" [...] for dōng [...] "east", and tongjia being an <b>interchangeable</b> <b>character</b> used for an existing homophonous character, such as using [...] zǎo [...] "flea" [...] for [...] zǎo [...] "early".|$|E
50|$|In {{trying to}} develop universally <b>interchangeable</b> <b>character</b> encodings, {{researchers}} in the 1980s faced the dilemma that on the one hand, it seemed necessary to add more bits to accommodate additional characters, {{but on the other}} hand, for the users of the relatively small character set of the Latin alphabet (who still constituted the majority of computer users), those additional bits were a colossal waste of then-scarce and expensive computing resources (as they would always be zeroed out for such users).|$|E

5000|$|Generic <b>characters</b> are <b>interchangeable</b> <b>characters,</b> {{appearing}} {{mostly in}} animated shows or comic strips. They often reappear {{at different times}} with different jobs, or are seen in the background. Animation or comic strip artists, when {{in need of a}} character who furthers the story without becoming part of it, often use an existing character from their repertoire instead of inventing a new one. Generics can be considered to be similar to gag characters, but might stay longer.|$|R

5000|$|The Shuowen tongxun dingsheng (...) is an 18-volume {{study of}} the Shuowen Jiezi {{completed}} in 1833 by the Qing phonologist Zhu Junsheng (朱駿聲) (1788-1858) and published in 1870. The bulk {{of the work is}} a phonetic study in which the 9000 characters of the Shuowen Jiezi and 7000 additional characters are grouped into 1137 series, each sharing a phonetic element. These phonetic series were further grouped into 18 Shijing rhyme groups, based on Duan Yucai's dictum that characters sharing a phonetic element belonged in the same rhyme group. The work thus anticipated the structure of Bernard Karlgren's Grammata Serica Recensa. The work also includes very detailed notes on rhyming, semantics, and <b>interchangeable</b> <b>characters.</b>|$|R

In this article, I will use the terms “refugee” and “immigrant” as equivalent to each other due to the <b>interchangeable</b> <b>character</b> of these concepts throughout the integration literature. First, the article brings into discussion the definitional and conceptual battle around {{the concept of}} immigrant “integration”, and second, it will describe and analyze cultural and social integration with their presupposing processes...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} novel system for {{creating}} an animation that is synchronized {{to a piece of}} music. The system consists of two main stages. In the first stage, musical features such as the tempo, beat positions, and dynamics of an input song are extracted. The features are then mapped to control a character using some pre-defined primitive movements. The mapping is defined by the user using a very simple script. Many-to-one or one-to-many mappings are possible. In the case of one-to-many, the system selects one of the candidate movements randomly. The proposed approach is implemented as a plug-in for Alias-Wavefront’s Maya, which allows for <b>interchangeable</b> <b>characters</b> and songs. The system is designed {{for a wide range of}} users and encourages experimentation by providing extensive user control. Very interesting animations can be generated using our approach...|$|R
40|$|The Lushan YuanGong Hua (廬山遠公話) of Dunhuang Bianwen (敦煌變文) - the Dunhuang {{version of}} the Scripts of the Eminent Monk Huiyuan of Mount Lu - is the {{earliest}} storytelling novel (話本) ever found through the present time. It is considered a work of great value {{in the context of}} historical studies of colloquial language, literature, and religion. This work has long been a subject of scholarly attention, including a Japanese translation by Dr. Iriya published in 1975. However, due to problems with the process of researching the Dunhuang manuscript research in the 1970 s, many problems remained. This paper, focusing on unresolved issues, presents a solution based on the outcome of Bianwen research, which has advanced dramatically in recent years. As a result, we have confirmed that said issues can be resolved on various aspects including organizing Tongjiazi (通假字: Chinese <b>interchangeable</b> <b>characters),</b> correcting punctuation, analyzing colloquial vocabulary, and more...|$|R
2500|$|IBM also {{produced}} computer terminals {{based on the}} Selectric mechanism, some of which (all models of the IBM 1050 series, and IBM 2741 models using [...] "PTTC/BCD" [...] code) used a different encoding. Though the elements were physically <b>interchangeable,</b> the <b>characters</b> were differently arranged, so that standard Selectric elements {{could not be used}} in them, and their elements could not be used in standard Selectrics. On the other hand, IBM 2741s using [...] "correspondence coding" [...] used standard office Selectric elements. [...] The IBM 1130 computer used a Selectric mechanism as the console printer.|$|R

40|$|My {{dissertation}} examines, within Fascist propagandist {{literature and}} cinema of the 1930 s, the hybrid figures of mulattoes—the offspring of interracial unions between Italian men and native women of Italy 2 ̆ 7 s African colonies—and Levantines—white Italian immigrant merchants and craftsmen living in Alexandria, Egypt, who culturally intermingled with other ethnic groups. The popular novels and feature films I examine reveal the mulattoes and Levantines as <b>interchangeable</b> <b>characters</b> invalidating Benito Mussolini 2 ̆ 7 s efforts at establishing {{a national identity}} based on a common cultural background, racial attributes, and religious beliefs. As my title suggests, I take mulattoes and Levantines out of the cinematic and literary “stock” of propaganda, where they were depicted as outside the stirpe (stock) of the Italian people, to reveal the inconsistencies within Fascist ideals of racial and cultural purity. In historical and anthropological terms, I intend to bring to light how literary and cinematic devices used to stigmatize mulattoes and Levantines often undermine themselves, calling attention to {{what was supposed to}} be absent or different from what was in “stock,” in the works themselves, in the actual peoples depicted and even in the motives of Fascist colonial enterprises. My analysis is informed by the framework of studies on exoticism, hybridity and mimicry, passing and the tragic mulatto, masculinity and femininity, and cultural studies, all of which lead back to the question: Why did Italians resist the ethnic and cultural metissage during colonialism and still to this day insist on “whiteness” when they describe themselves and their culture?...|$|R
40|$|Failure Projects is as {{the name}} suggests. Naturally, the word {{projects}} can function as either a noun or a verb in describing the collection. Most of the parts of speech in this collection are <b>interchangeable.</b> The <b>characters</b> in Failure Projects want meaning and purpose {{in a world in}} which late capitalism has suggested self-fulfillment as the ultimate and illusory goal of life. These are sad stories so naturally they are funny. These stories, like the University of California at which they were bown, are massive, complex, and full of totally pointless and arcane rules. They have terrible administrators and feel unsure of what they are doing. They like to make jokes when they're sa...|$|R

Jiaoge 鮫革 (with ge [...] "hide; leather") means [...] "sharkskin". Several texts (Han shi waizhuan 韓詩外傳, Shangzi, Xunzi, Shiji, and Huainanzi) record that {{soldiers}} from the southern state of Chu made strong armor with skin from jiao sharks and hides from rhinoceros.

50|$|As {{written by}} Gardner Fox, Snapper Carr {{had the most}} {{distinctive}} personality of {{all the members of}} the Justice League. Fox's writing focused on action, not character, and the dialogue he gave his superheroes was so bland as to be <b>interchangeable</b> among the <b>characters.</b> Snapper not only had the most distinctive means of speaking (with his extreme hipster slang), but he had the most clearly written and individualist character of all the recurring characters in the comic book. Within a few years, Fox got rid of the hipster slang and had Snapper speak in a more mainstream way, which had the side-effect of giving the character no discernible personality.|$|R
