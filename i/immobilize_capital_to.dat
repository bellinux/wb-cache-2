40|$|We {{assessed}} {{the potential of}} the solid residue from ahydrothermal treatment of rice straw as an alternative raw material for obtaining cellulose pulp. To this end, we examined the influence of operational variables in the diethanolamine pulping of this material on the properties of the cellulose pulp obtained and of paper sheets made from it. Using a central composite factor design and fitting the results to a polynomial model allowed us to establish equations relating the dependent variables to the independent ones with errors less than 8 % in all cases except for burst index (27 %). The optimum conditions with a view to saving reagents, heating energy and <b>immobilized</b> <b>capital</b> were found <b>to</b> be a diethanolamine concentration of 70 %, a temperature of 162. 5 ºC, a cooking time of 60 min and a liquid/solid ratio of 8. These conditions provide paper sheets with physical properties that depart by less than 8 % from their optimum values, and a pulp yield and Kappa number differing by less than 14 % from their best levels. We compared the results obtained in the diethanolaminepulping of the solid fraction from the hydrothermal treatmentof rice straw with those for kraft and diethanolaminepulp from eucalyptus and pine wood, and found the propertiesof the former to fall in between those for the latter two...|$|R

The study was made on a company which will process agricultural products(2). Therefore, several alternatives are prepared which different as regard the production capacity volume and the technology used in obtaining the finished product, so the method of variants will be used.
