5|$|The mycelia (but not {{the fruit}} bodies) of Armillaria gallica {{are known to}} be bioluminescent. Experiments have shown that the {{intensity}} of the luminescence is enhanced when the mycelia are disturbed during growth or when they are exposed to fluorescent light. Bioluminescence is caused by the action of luciferases, enzymes that produce light by the oxidation of a luciferin (a pigment). The biological purpose of bioluminescence in fungi is not definitively known, although several hypotheses have been suggested: <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>help</b> attract insects to help with spore dispersal, it may be a by-product of other biochemical functions, or <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>help</b> deter heterotrophs that might consume the fungus.|$|E

5|$|Both the mycelia and {{the fruit}} bodies of M.haematopus (both young and mature specimens) are {{reported}} to be bioluminescent. However, the luminescence is quite weak, and not visible to the dark-adapted eye; in one study, light emission was detectable only after 20hours of exposure to X-ray film. Although the biochemical basis of bioluminescence in M.haematopus has not been scientifically investigated, in general, bioluminescence {{is caused by the}} action of luciferases, enzymes that produce light by the oxidation of a luciferin (a pigment). The biological purpose of bioluminescence in fungi is not definitively known, although several hypotheses have been suggested: <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>help</b> attract insects to help with spore dispersal, it may be a by-product of other biochemical functions, or <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>help</b> deter heterotrophs that might consume the fungus.|$|E

5|$|Bee-eaters spend around 10% {{of their}} day on comfort activities. These include sunning themselves, dust bathing and water bathing. Sunning {{behaviour}} helps warm birds in the morning, reducing the need to use energy to raise their temperature. It also has a social aspect, as multiple birds adopt the same posture. Finally, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>help</b> stimulate parasites in the feathers, making them easier to find and remove. Due to their hole-nesting lifestyle, bee-eaters accumulate a number of external parasites such as mites and flies. Together with sunning, bouts of dust bathing (or water bathing where available), as well as rigorous preening, keep the feathers and skin in good health. Bathing with water involves making shallow dives into a water body and then returning to a perch to preen.|$|E

25|$|On 18 January, the High {{court ruled}} {{in favour of}} the City of London Corporation, giving them the power to order the {{eviction}} of occupiers from the St Pauls Camp. A spokesperson for the City {{said they would not}} further pursue eviction until 20 January, to give occupiers a chance to appeal against the ruling. The appeal date was later set to 13 February 2012. Comparing the St Pauls camp as it was in January 2012 with its first few weeks, journalists such as Sid Ryan, Brendan O'Neill and Laurie Penny noted a change of character, with energy being diverted from political activism into caring for homeless and mentally ill people attracted by the companionship and shelter. Ryan has argued that despite caring for the homeless being a worthwhile cause, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>help</b> the movement achieve change in the wider world if the camp is evicted.|$|E

500|$|The AdS/CFT {{correspondence}} {{is closely}} related to another duality conjectured by Igor Klebanov and Alexander Markovich Polyakov in 2002. This duality states that certain [...] "higher spin gauge theories" [...] on anti-de Sitter space are equivalent to conformal field theories with O(N) symmetry. Here the theory in the bulk is a type of gauge theory describing particles of arbitrarily high spin. It is similar to string theory, where the excited modes of vibrating strings correspond to particles with higher spin, and <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>help</b> to better understand the string theoretic versions of AdS/CFT and possibly even prove the correspondence. In 2010, Simone Giombi and Xi Yin obtained further evidence for this duality by computing quantities called three-point functions.|$|E
500|$|Chao claimed that, because GR embeds {{the tone}} of each {{syllable}} in its spelling, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>help</b> students to master Chinese tones. One study of GR, however, found the opposite to be true. GR uses a complicated system of tonal spelling that obscures the basic relationship between spelling and tone; for example, the difference between tones 1 and 2 is variously indicated as mha vs. ma, ching vs. chyng, chang vs. charng, etc. [...] Although tonal spelling has been adopted {{as part of the}} normal romanization of a number of Asian languages (e.g. Hmong), all such systems indicate different tones in a simple and consistent fashion by adding letters {{to the end of a}} syllable (e.g. in Hmong, -b indicates high tone, -s indicates low tone, -j indicates high-falling tone, etc.).|$|E

500|$|Legal {{historian}} John Phillip Reid {{has written}} that {{the emphasis on the}} political philosophy of the Declaration has been misplaced. The Declaration is not a philosophical tract about natural rights, argues Reid, but is instead a legal documentâ€”an indictment against King George for violating the constitutional rights of the colonists. [...] Historian David Armitage has argued that the Declaration was strongly influenced by de Vattel's The Law of Nations, the dominant international law treatise of the period, and a book that Benjamin Franklin said was [...] "continually {{in the hands of the}} members of our Congress". Armitage writes, [...] "Vattel made independence fundamental to his definition of statehood"; therefore, the primary purpose of the Declaration was [...] "to express the international legal sovereignty of the United States". If the United States were to have any hope of being recognized by the European powers, the American revolutionaries first had to make it clear that they were no longer dependent on Great Britain. [...] The Declaration of Independence does not have the force of law domestically, but nevertheless <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>help</b> to provide historical and legal clarity about the Constitution and other laws.|$|E
