5|$|The Committee to Protect Journalists, Proceso magazine, {{and several}} journalists and press freedom {{organizations}} have complained about irregularities {{in the investigation}} and question {{the legitimacy of the}} whole case. They believe that their colleague's murder was part of a campaign of intimidation against those who investigate alleged links between <b>drug</b> <b>traffickers</b> and politicians in the state of Veracruz.|$|E
5|$|Suspicions first fell on Los Tecos ("The Owls"), an ultra-rightwing {{group of}} the Autonomous University of Guadalajara who were largely criticized by Buendía for terrorizing their campus. However, suspicions turned to <b>drug</b> <b>traffickers</b> and {{high-level}} government officials, specifically those of the DFS. According to local media reports, once Buendía was killed, DFS agents went into the columnist's office and stole several files.|$|E
5|$|A Coast Guard {{detachment}} {{aboard the}} Fife confirmed {{that it was}} properly flying the U.S. flag. The Coast Guard was suspicious since the ship was low in the water, suggesting it was carrying heavy cargo, yet there were no cranes or other equipment that a legitimate fishing vessel {{would be expected to}} have. Instead there were several large shipping containers. Via radio, they asked the Joint Interagency Task Force West, a consortium of various federal law enforcement agencies, for permission to investigate further, since smugglers and <b>drug</b> <b>traffickers</b> were known to use that route.|$|E

5|$|María Santos Gorrostieta Salazar (1976 – 15 November 2012) was a Mexican {{physician}} and politician of the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD). From 2008 to 2011, {{she served as}} mayor of Tiquicheo, {{a small town in}} the Mexican state of Michoacán. In spite of three failed assassination attempts during her tenure as mayor, Gorrostieta Salazar continued to be outspoken in the fight against organized crime. In a fourth attack, Gorrostieta Salazar was kidnapped and assassinated by suspected <b>drug</b> <b>traffickers</b> on 15 November 2012. Michoacán is home to several violent drug trafficking organizations such as La Familia Michoacana and the Knights Templar Cartel.|$|E
5|$|The Ashaninkas were {{pressured}} to begin growing coca as cocaine trafficking increased in Peru {{by the early}} 1980s. Gagnon {{said that he would}} leave the mission if the people entered the cocaine trade, and no one chose to change their way of life. As the trade grew in the area, though, Gagnon talked to a United States Drug Enforcement Administration agent and {{sent a letter to the}} Peruvian security police base commander in Mazamari in 1983. Gagnon was told, and heeded the advice of two <b>drug</b> <b>traffickers,</b> not make any further overtures about the cocaine trade.|$|E
5|$|The Facebook page Valor por Tamaulipas ("Courage for Tamaulipas") {{was created}} by an {{anonymous}} user on 1 January 2012 after getting his inspiration from other websites that anonymously reported the drug violence in Mexico. The page regularly posts messages and photos of crime scenes; its goal is to report on drug-related violence and situations of risk in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas. It frequently posts messages and photos of the criminal activities in the state, including {{but not limited to}} law enforcement in action, photos of alleged criminals, vehicles of reported extortionists, abandoned vehicles left on the roadside, roadblocks, arsons, oil theft activities, <b>drug</b> <b>traffickers</b> on the job, and the like.|$|E

5|$|The {{death of}} Ramírez Treviño's boss {{triggered}} a war within the Gulf Cartel, {{resulting in the}} deaths and arrests of several high-ranking <b>drug</b> <b>traffickers</b> from 2011 to 2013. When the Gulf Cartel's top leaders Mario Cárdenas Guillén and Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sánchez were arrested in early September 2012, Ramírez Treviño decided to step up for the job and become the undisputed leader of the cartel. In efforts to keep the Gulf Cartel under a single command structure, he ordered the assassination of high-ranking drug trafficker El Metro 4 on 15 January 2013 in Reynosa. His death, however, sparked a turf war.|$|E
5|$|Both of the Gulf Cartel leaders {{ignored the}} command, and Treviño Morales moved swiftly to avenge {{the death of}} his former comrade. On 30 January 2010, Treviño Morales kidnapped and {{slaughtered}} 16 Gulf Cartel members in Reynosa, Tamaulipas, marking the start of the cartel war between the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas in the Mexican states of Tamaulipas, Nuevo León, and Veracruz that has led to thousands of deaths. Los Zetas used violent and intimidatory tactics to expand, forging a reputation as Mexico's most violent drug trafficking organization. It managed to take control of most of the territories owned by the Gulf Cartel when they had essentially served as a single organization. With Treviño Morales as the second-in-command of the criminal organization, Los Zetas began killing Gulf Cartel members and other rival <b>drug</b> <b>traffickers</b> en masse and winning their territories.|$|E
5|$|In February 2008, Lazcano Lazcano sent Treviño Morales to kill rival <b>drug</b> <b>traffickers</b> {{and take}} control of the drug {{trafficking}} routes in Guatemala. Reportedly, he carried out a military-like ambush that resulted in the death of the Guatemalan drug lord Juan José León Ardón (alias Juancho) in March. An unnamed U.S. official said that Treviño Morales may have been the man who fired the bullet that killed the drug kingpin. Having succeeded outside of Mexico, Treviño Morales was appointed by Lazcano Lazcano as the national commander of Los Zetas, a position traditionally reserved to Zetas members with military background. In this position, Treviño Morales had a say in nearly all the decisions Los Zetas made at a national level, creating some resentment among the old-generation commanders of Los Zetas who, unlike him, had been in the Mexican Armed Forces before turning to the drug trade.|$|E

5|$|On 22 May 2013, Valor por Tamaulipas {{released}} a video {{sent to the}} page by an alleged organized crime group. In the video, {{a man and a}} woman are interrogated by alleged <b>drug</b> <b>traffickers</b> and ask the administrator to close the page and reveal his true identity. The couple was presented as supposed family members of the administrator; however, he later indicated that they were not his family, and that the criminal organization had either confused them or simply targeted a random family to pressure to administrator to close the page. Valor por Tamaulipas responded by sending a message to the authorities in Tamaulipas and blamed them for the death of a person who died of a cardiac arrest after the couple was kidnapped; the administrator also accused the Tamaulipas authorities of protecting Los Zetas drug cartel.|$|E
25|$|Reporting on the {{activities}} of drug trafficking organizations in China is sparse. However, Chinese officials report that <b>drug</b> <b>traffickers</b> are dividing their large shipments into smaller ones {{in order to minimize}} losses in case of seizure. Chinese officials also report that <b>drug</b> <b>traffickers</b> are increasingly using women, children, and poor, uneducated farmers to body-carry drugs from the Golden Triangle area to Guangdong and other provinces in China.|$|E
25|$|This {{was easily}} {{accomplished}} because Mexico {{had long been}} {{a major source of}} heroin and cannabis, and <b>drug</b> <b>traffickers</b> from Mexico had already established an infrastructure that stood ready to serve the Colombia-based traffickers. By the mid-1980s, the organizations from Mexico were well-established and reliable transporters of Colombian cocaine. At first, the Mexican gangs were paid in cash for their transportation services, but in the late 1980s, the Mexican transport organizations and the Colombian <b>drug</b> <b>traffickers</b> settled on a payment-in-product arrangement.|$|E

25|$|Hurt {{economically}} by Peruvian Air Force interdiction {{efforts in}} the mid-1990s, <b>drug</b> <b>traffickers</b> are now using land and river routes as well as aircraft to transport cocaine paste and, increasingly, refined cocaine to consumers around {{and out of the}} country. The Air Bridge Denial program was suspended in April 2001 after the Peruvian Air Force and strength of the U.S. DEA misidentified a civilian aircraft as a drug trafficker and shot it down, killing two American citizens on board. Peru continues to arrest <b>drug</b> <b>traffickers</b> and seize drugs and precursor chemicals, destroy coca labs, disable clandestine airstrips, and prosecute officials involved in narcotics corruption.|$|E

25|$|Scarface was {{released}} on December 9, 1983 and was a box office success, grossing $44 million. Initial critical reception was mixed, with criticism over excessive violence and profanity and graphic drug usage.

25|$|Drug policy {{fails to}} target {{high-level}} traffickers. In the 1970s, {{as part of}} the international Operation Condor, the Mexican government sent 10,000 soldiers and police to a poverty-stricken region in northern Mexico plagued by drug production and leftist insurgency. Hundreds of peasants were arrested, tortured, and jailed, but no major <b>drug</b> <b>traffickers</b> were captured.|$|E
25|$|Drug {{shipments}} {{are often}} delayed in Mexican border towns before delivery to the US, which has forced <b>drug</b> <b>traffickers</b> to increase prices {{to account for}} transportation costs of products across international borders, making it a more profitable business for the drug lords, and has likely contributed to the increased rates of local drug consumption.|$|E
