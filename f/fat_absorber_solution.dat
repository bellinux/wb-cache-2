50|$|Liquid neutron {{absorbers}} {{are also}} used in rapid shutdown systems for light water reactors. Following a SCRAM, if the reactor (or section(s) thereof) are not below the shutdown margin (that is, they could return to a critical state due to insertion of positive reactivity from cooling, poison decay, or other uncontrolled conditions), the operators can inject solutions containing neutron poisons directly into the reactor coolant. Neutron poisons are water-based solutions that contain chemicals that absorb neutrons, such as common household borax, sodium polyborate, boric acid, or gadolinium nitrate, causing a decrease in neutron multiplication, and thus shutting down the reactor without use of the control rods. In the PWR, these neutron absorbing solutions are stored in pressurized tanks (called accumulators) that {{are attached to the}} primary coolant system via valves; a varying level of neutron absorbent is kept within the primary coolant at all times, and is increased using the accumulators {{in the event of a}} failure of all of the control rods to insert, which will promptly bring the reactor below the shutdown margin. In the BWR, soluble neutron absorbers are found within the Standby Liquid Control System (SLCS), which uses redundant battery-operated injection pumps, or, in the latest models, high pressure nitrogen gas to inject the neutron <b>absorber</b> <b>solution</b> into the reactor vessel against any pressure within. Because they may delay the restart of a reactor, these systems are only used to shut down the reactor if control rod insertion fails.

40|$|DOI: 10. 1016 /j. energy. 2016. 02. 022 An ANN (artificial neural network) {{model was}} {{developed}} to determine the efficiency parameters of a horizontal falling film absorber at operating conditions of interest for absorption cooling systems. The aqueous nitrate solution LiNO 3 +KNO 3 +NaNO 3 with salt mass percentages of 53 %, 28 % and 19 %, respectively, {{was used as a}} working fluid. The authors created the ANN from the database they had compiled with the results of experiments that they had performed in a set-up designed and built for this purpose. The ANN structure consisted of 6 input variables: inlet solution and cooling water temperatures, cooling water and solution mass flow rates, absorber pressure and inlet solution concentration; 4 output variables which facilitated the assessment of the performance of the absorber: heat and mass transfer coefficients, absorption mass flux and the degree of subcooling of the <b>solution</b> leaving the <b>absorber.</b> The hidden layer contained 9 neurons which were determined by training and test procedures. The results showed that the deviation between the experimental data and the estimated values was well adjusted. This indicated that the ANN model was an effective tool for predicting the efficiency parameters of the <b>absorber.</b> The <b>solution</b> flow rate was also observed to be the most significant operating variable which affected the performance of the absorber...|$|R
40|$|The solar-to-hydrogen (STH) {{efficiency}} limits, {{along with}} the maximum efficiency values and the corresponding optimal band gap combinations, have been evaluated for various combinations of light absorbers arranged in a tandem configuration in realistic, operational water-splitting prototypes. To perform the evaluation, a current–voltage model was employed, with the light <b>absorbers,</b> electrocatalysts, <b>solution</b> electrolyte, and membranes coupled in series, and with the directions of optical absorption, carrier transport, electron transfer and ionic transport in parallel. The current density vs. voltage characteristics of the light absorbers were determined by detailed-balance calculations that accounted for the Shockley–Queisser limit on the photovoltage of each absorber. The maximum STH efficiency for an integrated photoelectrochemical system {{was found to be}} ~ 31. 1 % at 1 Sun (= 1 kW m⁻², air mass 1. 5), fundamentally limited by a matching photocurrent density of 25. 3 mA cm⁻² produced by the light absorbers. Choices of electrocatalysts, as well as the fill factors of the light absorbers and the Ohmic resistance of the solution electrolyte also play key roles in determining the maximum STH efficiency and the corresponding optimal tandem band gap combination. Pairing 1. 6 – 1. 8 eV band gap semiconductors with Si in a tandem structure produces promising light absorbers for water splitting, with theoretical STH efficiency limits of > 25 %...|$|R
