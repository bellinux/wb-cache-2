Furthermore, the legal status of such discs poses economic frictions in that they may be interpreted as two copies of a copyrighted work.

Since this would make the record much more expensive, it appears that most companies are avoiding this issue by simply canceling the release of the SACD version.Kooper said, [...] "Have finished an eye-opening 5.1 Surround SACD mix of Super Session.

40|$|AbstractWe {{continue}} our research on hybrid derivation modes of cooperating distributed (CD) grammar systems started in (Fernau et al., Proc. 3 rd Internat. Conf. Developments in Language Theory, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, 1997, pp. 261 – 272; Theoret. Comput. Sci. 259 (2001) 405). Here, {{we focus on}} (hybrid) systems with context-free components working in a hybrid t- and Δk-mode, Δ∈{⩽,=}. We prove that CD grammar systems working in the mode (t∧= 1), which means that each component cannot perform more than one derivation step in a row, characterize the context-free programmed languages with finite index. Moreover, we show that additional external hybridization of this mode with, e. g., the = 1 -mode (or = 2 -mode, respectively) leads to a characterization of the context-free ordered languages (or the context-free programmed languages with appearance checking, respectively). In particular, <b>hybrid</b> <b>CD</b> grammar systems with classical and internally hybrid modes have universal computational power, a result which is unknown for <b>hybrid</b> <b>CD</b> grammar systems whose components work only in classical modes, since such systems are computationally equivalent to recurrent programmed grammars with appearance checking, as shown in (Theoret. Computer. Sci. 259 (2001) 405). Furthermore, we obtain a characterization of ordered languages {{within the framework of}} CD grammar systems...|$|E
30|$|As {{mentioned}} before, SVD precoding {{is still}} quite effective in OOBE suppression {{when there is}} CP although the result degrades. On the contrary, the filtering scheme does not depend much on whether there is CP or not. Thus, the Filter curves in both Figures  8 and 9 look similar, and they can achieve larger stopband attenuation but slower roll-off than the SVD curves. In both Figures  8 and 9, the <b>hybrid</b> <b>C</b> curves can achieve higher stopband attenuation than SVD curves and quicker roll-off and smaller transition band than Filter curses. Thus, the <b>hybrid</b> <b>C</b> scheme has the advantages of both the SVD precoding scheme (i.e., quick roll-off or transition) and the filtering scheme (i.e., large stopband attenuation).|$|R

40|$|Several {{domains of}} CD 4 have been {{suggested}} to {{play a critical role}} in events that follow its binding to the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) envelope glycoprotein (gp 120 -gp 41). It has been reported previously that cells expressing a chimeric molecule consisting of the first 177 residues of human CD 4 attached to residues from the hinge, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains of human CD 8 did not form syncytia with HIV- 1 -infected cells (L. Poulin, L. A. Evans, S. Tang, A. Barboza, H. Legg, D. R. Littman, and J. A. Levy, J. Virol. 65 : 4893 - 4901, 1991). In contrast, we found that the <b>hybrid</b> <b>CD</b> 4. CD 8 molecule expressed in human cells did render them susceptible to fusion with cells expressing HIV- 1 IIIB or HIV- 1 RF envelope glycoproteins encoded by vaccinia virus recombinants, but only after long lag times.

However, the rate of binding to and the affinity of soluble gp 120 for membrane-associated CD 4. CD 8 were the same as for CD 4. Both molecules were laterally mobile, as determined by patching experiments. Coexpression of the CD 4. CD 8 chimera with wild-type CD 4 did not lead to interference in fusion but had an additive effect. Therefore, the proximal membrane domains of CD 4 play an important role in determining the kinetics of postbinding events leading to membrane fusion. We hypothesize that the long lag time is due to the inability of the CD 4. CD 8 -gp 120 -gp 41 complex to undergo the rapid conformational changes which occur during the fusion mediated by wild-type CD 4...|$|E

The newly developed method employs the standard finite difference method in the x and y directions and the well-known nodal methods [nodal expansion method (NEM) and analytic nodal method (ANM) as needed] in the z direction. Four variants of the hybrid method are investigated depending on the axial nodal methodologies: HYBRID A, NEM with the conventional quadratic transverse leakage; HYBRID B, the conventional NEM method except that the transverse-leakage shapes are obtained from a fine-mesh local problem (FMLP) around the control rod tip; <b>HYBRID</b> <b>C,</b> the same as HYBRID B except that ANM with a high-order transverse leakage obtained from the FMLP {{is used in the}} vicinity of the control rod tip; and HYBRID D, the same as <b>HYBRID</b> <b>C</b> except that the transverse leakage is determined using the buckling approximation instead of the FMLP around the control rod tip.

These mutations paralleled those in other viral strains passaged in vitro.

40|$|We {{introduce}} several internally {{hybrid derivation}} modes of cooperating distributed (CD) grammar systems.

40|$|Thymocytes must bind major {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC) proteins on thymic epithelial cells in order to mature into either CD 8 + cytotoxic T cells or CD 4 + helper T cells. Thymic precursors express both CD 8 and CD 4, {{and it has been}} suggested that the intracellular signals generated by CD 8 or CD 4 binding to class I or II MHC, respectively, might influence the fate of uncommitted cells. Here we test the notion that intracellular signaling by CD 4 directs the development of thymocytes to a CD 4 lineage. A hybrid protein consisting of the CD 8 extracellular and transmembrane domains and the cytoplasmic domain of CD 4 (CD 884) should bind class I MHC but deliver a CD 4 intracellular signal. We find that expression of a <b>hybrid</b> <b>CD</b> 884 protein in thymocytes of transgenic mice leads to the development of large numbers of class I MHC-specific, CD 4 lineage T cells.

Ad 3, 7 and 11 bound and transduced CD 46 -positive rodent BHK cells at levels similar to Ad 35. By using antibody-blocking experiments, <b>hybrid</b> <b>CD</b> 46 -CD 4 receptor constructs and CD 46 single point mutants, it is shown that Ad 3, 7 and 11 share many of the Ad 35 -binding features on CD 46. Both CD 46 short consensus repeat domains SCR I and SCR II were necessary and sufficient for optimal binding and transgene expression, provided that they were positioned at an appropriate distance from the cell membrane. Similar to Ad 35, most of the putative binding residues of Ad 3, 7 and 11 were located on the same glycan-free, solvent-exposed face of the SCR I or SCR II domains, largely overlapping with the binding surface of the recently solved fiber knob Ad 11 -SCR I-II three-dimensional structure. Differences between species B 1 and B 2 Ads were documented with competition experiments based on anti-CD 46 antibodies directed against epitopes flanking the putative Ad-binding sites, and with competition experiments based on soluble CD 46 protein.

To this aim, we studied the effect of MAb 13 B 8 - 2 treatment on (i) HIV- 1 production in A 2. 01 cells, which express different forms of the CD 4 gene, (ii) Tat-induced HIV- 1 promoter activation, and (iii) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation, which is induced in CD 4 -positive cells by HIV- 1 cross-linking of CD 4. Inhibition of HIV production by 13 B 8 - 2 MAb treatment was consistently observed in cells expressing wild-type CD 4 and cells expressing a <b>hybrid</b> <b>CD</b> 4 -CD 8 molecule (amino acids 1 to 177 of CD 4 fused to the hinge, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains of CD 8).

The delay was much less in cells expressing a <b>hybrid</b> <b>CD</b> 4 -CD 8 molecule (amino acids 1 - 177 of CD 4 fused to the hinge, transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of CD 8). Yet the extent of viral entry and reverse transcription, monitored by semi-quantitative PCR, was similar in each cell type studied. For further study of the mechanism responsible for delayed HIV replication in the A 2. 01 /CD 4. 401 cell line, cells were treated with phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), 24 h after HIV infection. Under such experimental conditions HIV production was detected {{at the same time in}} the culture supernatants of A 2. 01 /CD 4 and A 2. 01 /CD 4. 401 cells. Moreover, we found that CD 4 oligomerization by HIV- 1 induced NF-kappa B translocation in A 2. 01 /CD 4 and A 2. 01 /CD 4 -CD 8 but not in A 2. 01 /CD 4. 401 cells. This was consistent with CAT assay experiments which provided evidence for Tat-independent NF-kappa B mediated activation of HIV- 1 LTR promoter after HIV binding to CD 4 in A 2. 01 /CD 4 and A 2. 01 /CD 4 -CD 8 but not in A 2. 01 /CD 4. 401 cells. In contrast to results published recently by Tremblay et al.
