The ASAT <b>kill</b> <b>vehicle</b> relies on an imaging infrared seeker and also {{has been described}} as a modified HQ-19 with a KT-1 rocket booster.

25|$|In the {{framework}} of Ground-Based Midcourse Defense, Raytheon is developing a Ground Based Interceptor (GBI) that includes a booster missile and a kinetic Exoatmospheric <b>Kill</b> <b>Vehicle</b> (EKV), along with several key radar components, such as the Sea-Based X-Band Radar (SBX) and the Upgraded Early Warning Radar (UEWR).|$|E
25|$|The HOE used a Kinetic <b>Kill</b> <b>Vehicle</b> (KKV) {{to destroy}} a {{ballistic}} missile. The KKV was equipped with an infrared seeker, guidance electronics and a propulsion system. Once in space, the KKV could extend a folded structure similar to an umbrella skeleton of 4m (13ft) diameter to enhance its effective cross section. This device would destroy the ICBM reentry vehicle on collision.|$|E

During an actual hostile ballistic missile attack, the carrier vehicle with its cargo of small <b>kill</b> <b>vehicles</b> would have maneuvered {{into the path of}} an enemy missile. Using tracking data from the Ballistic Missile Defense System and its own seeker, the carrier vehicle would have dispensed and guided the <b>kill</b> <b>vehicles</b> to destroy any warheads or countermeasures.|$|R

25|$|On January 11, 2007, China {{conducted}} an anti-satellite missile test. A Chinese weather satellite—the FY-1C polar orbit satellite of the Fengyun series, {{at an altitude}} of , with a mass of 750kg—was destroyed by a kinetic <b>kill</b> <b>vehicle</b> traveling with a speed of 8km/s in the opposite direction (see Head-on engagement). It was launched with a multistage solid-fuel missile from Xichang Satellite Launch Center or nearby.|$|E
25|$|Later, SDIO {{worked with}} the Navy to test the LEAP on the Terrier missile. The Terrier LEAP {{demonstration}} program lasted from 1991 into 1995 and consisted of four flight tests. Two of these were intercept tests in early 1995; both failed to intercept—the first had a software error in the second-stage booster, the second had a squib (pyrotechnic switch to connect power) in the kinetic <b>kill</b> <b>vehicle</b> that was mounted backwards and failed to fire.|$|E
2500|$|The ABM {{project has}} two missiles—namely the AAD (Advanced Air Defence) and PAD (Prithvi Air Defence) missiles. The former is an endo-atmospheric {{interceptor}} of new design, which can intercept targets to {{a height of}} [...] Whereas {{the latter is a}} modified Prithvi missile, dubbed the Axo-atmospheric interceptor (AXO) with a dedicated second stage <b>kill</b> <b>vehicle</b> for ballistic missile interception, up to an altitude of [...] Both these missiles are cued by an active phased array Long Range Tracking Radar, similar to the Elta GreenPine but made with locally developed components, which include DRDO-developed transmit/receive modules. The ABM system also makes use of a second radar, known as the Multi-Function Control Radar which assists the LRTR in classifying the target, and can also act as the fire control radar for the AAD missile. The MFCR, like the LRTR, is an active phased array system.|$|E
5000|$|An April 2000 {{study by}} the Union of Concerned Scientists and the Security Studies Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology {{concluded}} that [...] "any country capable of deploying a long-range missile would {{also be able to}} deploy countermeasures that would defeat the planned NMD system."Countermeasures studied in detail were bomblets containing biological or chemical agents, aluminized balloons to serve as decoys and to disguise warheads, and cooling warheads to reduce the <b>kill</b> <b>vehicle’s</b> ability to detect them.|$|R
50|$|The HGV stays {{within the}} {{stratosphere}} after reentry and pull-up, and glides through the air. Although that creates more drag, warheads fly further {{than they would}} on a higher trajectory through space, and are too low to be intercepted by exo-atmospheric <b>kill</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The tradeoff is that warheads have less speed and altitude as they near the target, making them vulnerable to lower-tier interceptors. For example the mach 10 Sprint missile and its US derivatives and the mach 17 Russian 53T6, ABM-3 Gazelle. Other potential counter-hypersonic interception measures may involve laser or rail gun technologies.|$|R

2500|$|In 2009, reports emerged {{of a new}} exo-atmospheric {{interceptor}} missile named the Prithvi Defence Vehicle (PDV) {{interceptor missile}}. The DRDO is developing a new Prithvi interceptor missile codenamed PDV. It will be a two-stage missile and both the stages will be powered by solid propellants. It will have an innovative system for controlling the vehicle {{at an altitude of}} more than 150km The PDV is intended to replace the existing PAD in the PAD/AAD combination. It will have an IIR seeker for its <b>kill</b> <b>vehicle</b> as well. The PDV will replace the PAD with a far more capable missile and will complete the Phase 1 of the BMD system, allowing it to be operational by 2013. Whereupon Phase 2 development will take over for protection against missiles of the [...] range class. The first test flight of the missile was expected in 2010. The PDV is designed to take out the target missile at altitudes above [...]|$|E
2500|$|Lockheed {{is pushing}} for funding for the {{development}} of an extended range (ER) version of the THAAD to counter maturing threats posed by hypersonic glide vehicles that adversaries may deploy, namely the Chinese WU-14, to penetrate the gap between low and high-altitude missile defenses. The company performed static fire trials of a modified THAAD booster in 2006 and continued to fund the project until 2008. The current -diameter single-stage booster design would be expanded to a [...] first stage for greater range with a second [...] "kick stage" [...] to close the distance to the target and provide improved velocity at burnout and more lateral movement during an engagement. Although the <b>kill</b> <b>vehicle</b> would not need redesign, the ground-based launcher would have only five missiles instead of eight. As of early 2015 THAAD-ER is only an industry concept, but Lockheed believes the Missile Defense Agency will show interest because of the weapons under development by potential adversaries. If funding for the THAAD-ER begins in 2018, a system could be produced by 2022 to provide an interim capability against a rudimentary hypersonic threat. The Pentagon is researching whether other technologies like directed energy weapons and railguns are better solutions for missile defense; these are expected to become available in the mid to late 2020's.|$|E
50|$|China {{carried out}} a {{land-based}} anti-ballistic missile test on 11 January 2010.

50|$|Israel Aerospace Industries {{announced}} in June 2009, that the Arrow 3 patented exoatmospheric interception method includes a two-stage interceptor, like the Arrow 2, but purely based on hit-to-kill technology. Unlike most kill vehicles, which use liquid or gas propulsion, the new Israeli <b>kill</b> <b>vehicle</b> will be propelled by an ordinary rocket motor {{equipped with a}} thrust-vectoring nozzle. It will also be fitted with a gimbaled seeker for hemispheric coverage. By measuring the seeker's line-of-sight propagation relative to the vehicle's motion, the <b>kill</b> <b>vehicle</b> will use proportional navigation to divert its course and line up exactly with the target's flight path. Joseph Hasson, chief missile designer at IAI, who patented the new <b>kill</b> <b>vehicle</b> with his colleague Galya Goldner, says that the concept is relatively simple, reliable and inexpensive, {{and is based on}} mature technologies. Furthermore, the kill vehicle's divert capability and agility reduce the need for detection and tracking systems, which usually accompany remote sensor-assisted exoatmospheric kills. IAI displayed a full-sized model of the Arrow 3 missile and its <b>kill</b> <b>vehicle</b> at the June 2009 Paris Air Show.|$|E
