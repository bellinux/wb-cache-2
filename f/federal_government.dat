5|$|Citing {{the trust}} {{relationship}} between the <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> and the tribes, the Court held that removal treaties could only be enforced against the tribes by the <b>federal</b> <b>government,</b> not private parties (whether through self-help or through the courts). In other words, the <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> retained the discretion not to enforce such treaties. At the same time, the Court held that enrolled treaties are conclusively valid, and refused to consider the plaintiffs claim that the Treaty of Buffalo Creek (1838) was fraudulent.|$|E

5|$|Canada is a {{federation}} {{composed of}} ten provinces and three territories. In turn, {{these may be}} grouped into four main regions: Western Canada, Central Canada, Atlantic Canada, and Northern Canada (Eastern Canada refers to Central Canada and Atlantic Canada together). Provinces have more autonomy than territories, having responsibility for social programs such as health care, education, and welfare. Together, the provinces collect more revenue than the <b>federal</b> <b>government,</b> an almost unique structure among federations in the world. Using its spending powers, the <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> can initiate national policies in provincial areas, such as the Canada Health Act; the provinces can opt out of these, but rarely do so in practice. Equalization payments are made by the <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> to ensure that reasonably uniform standards of services and taxation are kept between the richer and poorer provinces.|$|E
