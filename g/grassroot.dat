40|$|Since its {{inception}} in 1996, the <b>GrassRoots</b> Program {{has been instrumental in}} facilitating the integration of information and communication technologies (ICT) into the classrooms of Canadian schools. By linking the <b>GrassRoots</b> Program to the school curriculum and providing incentives for teachers to engage students in the process of co-creating electronic curriculum resources for the Internet, it has been influential in transforming classrooms into authentic centres of learning. There is overwhelming evidence supporting the concept that the <b>GrassRoots</b> Program is a powerful connector between ICT and new teaching theories. This paper provides an overview of innovation, a background to some of the challenges associated with large-scale innovation in the Canadian K- 12 school system and the findings from a collection of 16 case studies conducted in innovative schools in Canada. An analysis of the data contained in the case studies indicates that the <b>GrassRoots</b> Program is having a positive impact on the diffusion of ICT in the classrooms of schools that are members of the Network of Innovation (NIS), and it is making a significant contribution {{to the development of a}} culture of innovation. The existence of <b>GrassRoots</b> projects has also increased the capacity for innovation by empowering and enabling the schools and teachers to work on multiple innovations simultaneously. Also, there is sufficient evidence to show that <b>GrassRoots</b> has had a major impact on: teacher professional learning; teacher technology skill development; student technology skill development, student employability skill development; access to teaching resources; leadership opportunities; and school growth and development. ...|$|R

25|$|After Adolf Hitler {{imposed on}} all German church bodies an unconstitutional reelection of all presbyters and synodals on 23 July 1933, the massive voter {{participation}} of Protestant Nazis, {{who had not}} shown up for years in services, let alone church elections, caused an extraordinarily high turnout, which yielded the German Christians a share of 70–80% of the presbyters and synodals, with some exceptions. However, this did not automatically mean the total takeover of the German Christians in all Protestant organisations, since due to the decentral and <b>grassroot</b> organisation of many Protestant groups, the official church bodies had no direct control, this was especially true for missionary endowments such as Jerusalem's Association.|$|E

40|$|Large, socially-driven Web 2. 0 {{sites such}} as Facebook and Youtube have seen {{significant}} growth in popularity [5, 10]. However, strong demand also exists for socially-driven web sites specialized to companies and knowledge domains. Unfortunately, existing tools for building such sites only provide low-level functionality to address recurring search and organization patterns. Further, they require expertise at many levels of the software stack. Therefore, we propose <b>GrassRoots,</b> a declarative language for modeling socially-driven websites and a compiler to automatically generate the code at several layers of the software stack. We provide abstractions for modeling data and relationships, search, page composition, and navigation. Most notably, we propose a graph-based data model that allows designers to both filter and rank search results using structural and value-based primitives. In this paper, we describe the <b>GrassRoots</b> language and show how popular sociallydriven websites can be specified using it. We also describe the GR compiler that generates web sites based on Grass-Roots specifications...|$|R
