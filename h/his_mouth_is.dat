5|$|Lately, Cookie {{has also}} taught {{children}} {{the importance of}} eating a balanced diet. This doesn't mean that Cookie rounds out his diet with plates, trucks, ukuleles, and other objects the munching monster {{has been known to}} devour. This means that Cookie now eats a fair share of salads, meats, and vegetables to set a good example for viewers at home. And Cookie doesn't mind a bit. Sure he loves cookies, but he likes the act of eating in general. As long as <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>is</b> full, his heart is happy.|$|E
5|$|In Sri Lanka {{the belief}} of Riri Yaka (Blood Demon) can be found. According to mythology, he tore his mother's breast and emerged {{into the human}} world as a demon killing her. The demon is said to give a primary form and eight other manifestations. In most cases {{he is said to}} be a giant who towers over his human victims. In the primary form, his face is blue and splotched with blood. Red rays radiate from his bloodshot eyes. Blood pours from his {{nostrils}} and smoke billows from his ears. <b>His</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>is</b> filled with decomposing human flesh and his breath is foul. His entire body is coloured scarlet with dripping blood. He is closely associated with Mara, the demon king of death.|$|E
5|$|The panel {{captures the}} instant of Christ's death, {{traditionally}} the moment after {{the breaking of}} the thieves' legs (although this is not depicted). Christ is naked except for a transparent veil, with some of his pubic hair visible. His hands and feet are nailed to the timber; the blood from the nail holding his feet to the cross stains its wooden base. His arms strain under the weight of his upper body, and in his final agony, his jaw has fallen slack; <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>is</b> open with his teeth exposed in the grimace of death. In the mid-ground, {{at the base of the}} cross, Longinus, on horseback, wearing a fur-trimmed hat and green tunic, guided by an assistant, stretches to pierce Jesus' side with a lance, as deep-red blood pours from the wound. To the right of Longinus, a mostly obscured Stephaton holds high a sponge soaked with vinegar on the tip of a reed.|$|E

25|$|Superficially the Green Man {{would appear}} to be pagan, perhaps a {{fertility}} figure or a nature spirit, similar to the woodwose (the wild man of the woods), and yet he frequently appears, carved in wood or stone, in churches, chapels, abbeys and cathedrals, where examples can be found dating through to the 20th century. The earliest example of a green man disgorging vegetation from <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>is</b> from St. Abre, in St. Hilaire-le-grand, c. 400 AD.|$|E
500|$|In the Vishnu Purana, Varaha {{represents}} yajna (sacrifice), as {{the eternal}} upholder of the earth. His feet represent the Vedas (scriptures). His tusks represent sacrificial stakes. His teeth are offerings. <b>His</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>is</b> the altar with tongue of sacrificial fire. The [...] {{hair on his}} head denotes the sacrificial grass. The eyes represent {{the day and the}} night. His coarse hair represents sexual prowess. The head represents the seat of the Brahmin (priest). The mane represents the hymns of the Vedas. His nostrils are for oblation. His joints represent the various ceremonies. The ears are said to indicate rites (voluntary and obligatory). Thus, Varaha is the embodiment of the Supreme Being who brings order amidst chaos in the world by his sacrifice.|$|E
500|$|Albrecht the Elder's {{lips are}} thin and tightly pursed and <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>is</b> broad and down-turned, yet his {{features}} {{are those of}} a handsome man. Marcel Brion described him as appearing [...] "mild and thoughtful", an impression reinforced by the uncomplicated design of the painting. This view {{is reinforced by the}} relative drabness or simplicity of his clothes, which seem intended to convey a reserved, ascetic piousness. Dürer presents his father more like a low-ranking [...] ecclesiastic than a tradesman: a calm, considerate and straightforward man dressed up in his best, albeit modest, clothes. After his father's death in 1502, Dürer wrote that Albrecht the Elder [...] "passed his life in great toil and stern hard labour, having nothing for his support save what he earned with his hand for himself, his wife and his children... He underwent manifold afflictions, trials and adversities. But he won just praise from all who knew him... he was also of few words, and was a God-fearing man." ...|$|E

500|$|The filmmakers {{decided that}} Dredd should appear lean and fast like a boxer rather than bulky like [...] "someone who spends hours sort of steroiding himself up." [...] His Judge uniform was altered from the comic version; an {{extruded}} eagle statuette {{was removed from}} his shoulder pad to emphasise the outfit's functionality {{and give it a}} sense of realism. Garland said: [...] "If you did a very faithful adaptation of the uniform you'd have someone who if he got stabbed in the stomach he’d be in big trouble. Dredd is out there on the frontline so he needed protection." [...] Remaining faithful to the comic, Dredd's face, except for <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> <b>is</b> never shown and his helmet is not removed throughout the film. Urban said: [...] "He {{is supposed to be the}} faceless representative of the law and I think that is part of his enigma...You wouldn't get to the end of a Sergio Leone Western and go, 'God, I didn't even know the character's name!' It's irrelevant." ...|$|E
500|$|Edward {{became ill}} during January 1553 with a fever and cough that {{gradually}} worsened. The imperial ambassador, Jean Scheyfve, reported that [...] "he suffers {{a good deal}} when the fever is upon him, especially from a difficulty in drawing his breath, {{which is due to}} the compression of the organs on the right side". Edward felt well enough in early April to take the air in the park at Westminster and to move to Greenwich, {{but by the end of}} the month he had weakened again. By 7 May he was [...] "much amended", and the royal doctors had no doubt of his recovery. A few days later the king was watching the ships on the Thames, sitting at his window. However, he relapsed, and on 11 June Scheyfve, who had an informant in the king's household, reported that [...] "the matter he ejects from <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>is</b> sometimes coloured a greenish yellow and black, sometimes pink, like the colour of blood". Now his doctors believed he was suffering from [...] "a suppurating tumour" [...] of the lung and admitted that Edward's life was beyond recovery. Soon, his legs became so swollen that he had to lie on his back, and he lost the strength to resist the disease. To his tutor John Cheke he whispered, [...] "I am glad to die".|$|E
2500|$|The hygiene {{hypothesis}} {{states that}} {{infants and children}} who lack exposure to infectious agents {{are more susceptible to}} allergic diseases via modulation of immune system development. As Mary Ruebush writes in her book Why Dirt is Good, “what a child is doing when he puts things in <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>is</b> allowing his immune response to explore his environment. Not only does this allow for ‘practice’ of immune responses, which will be necessary for protection, but it also plays a critical role in teaching the immature immune response what is best ignored.” [...] The theory was first proposed by David P. Strachan who noted that hay fever and eczema were less common in children who belonged to large families. [...] Since then, studies have noted the effect of gastrointestinal worms on the development of allergies in the developing world. For example, a study in Gambia found that eradication of worms in some villages led to increased skin reactions to allergies among children.|$|E

2500|$|The Game {{released}} a controversial artwork {{of the album}} via Instagram on October 21, 2012 and also announced the release date will be December 11. The cover portrays a dark-skinned Jesus in a stained glass window with a teardrop tattoo, a red bandanna around his mouth, and wearing a Jesus piece. The stained glass-inspired image shows Jesus sitting on a throne adorned with gang-related symbols. In the artwork, Jesus is holding a gold [...] "Jesus Piece" [...] chain and pointing to a symbol on his breast plate. The red bandana over <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>is</b> {{a reference to the}} Cedar Block Piru Bloods gang, to which Game is allegedly a member. The artwork has a slightly altered logo on the top, which features on all of Game's previous studio albums. The album's title Jesus Piece is stylized as Je5us Piece, depicting that it is Game's fifth studio album. Je5us Piece logo is styled after the iconic Louis Vuitton. The cover was designed by Mike Saputo. The religious imagery of the art has gained mixed reactions and the ire of some fans who deem the work as blasphemous. Several celebrities praised the artwork, including Busta Rhymes, Mac Miller and Kevin Hart. However, The Game decided to make this cover for the deluxe edition after the Roman Catholic Church complained to Interscope Records about it. Complex named the album cover the fifteenth best cover of 2012. On November 12, an alternative cover for the standard edition of the album was released. This cover paid homage to one of The Game's older brothers, Jevon Danell Taylor, who was shot and killed at the age of 20 on May 21, 1995.|$|E
