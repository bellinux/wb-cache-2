5|$|Artavasdes I of Media Atropatene, {{also known}} as Artavasdes I of Atropatene, Artavasdes I and Artavasdes (before or about 59 BC-about 20 BC) was a Prince {{who served as a}} King of Media Atropatene. Artavasdes <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> enemy of King Artavasdes II of Armenia and his son Artaxias II. He was a {{contemporary}} with the Ptolemaic Greek Queen Cleopatra VII and Roman Triumvir Mark Antony, as Artavasdes I was mentioned in their diplomatic affairs.|$|E
5|$|Khasekhemre Neferhotep <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> Egyptian pharaoh {{of the mid}} Thirteenth Dynasty {{ruling in}} the second half of the 18th century BC during a time {{referred}} to as the late Middle Kingdom or early Second Intermediate Period, depending on the scholar. One of the best attested rulers of the 13th Dynasty, Neferhotep I reigned for 11 years.|$|E
5|$|Artavasdes I succeeded {{his father}} as King, when Ariobarzanes I died in 56 BC. When Mark Antony led his {{campaign}} against the Parthian Empire in 36 BC, Artavasdes <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> ally of the King Phraates IV of Parthia. Antony led his troops from Zeugma northward into Armenia and then invaded the domain of Artavasdes I. Antony {{did not want to}} attack Parthia from the west, which was the shortest way, but surprisingly from the north. Antony allegedly used this strategy on the advice of Artavasdes II of Armenia, the enemy of Artavasdes I. Antony moved with his army in fast marches to Phraaspa, the strong fortified capital of Media Atropatene, where Artavasdes I had got his family to safety. Meantime Artavasdes I had joined the army of Phraates IV.|$|E

25|$|Charles, {{like his}} father Oscar <b>I,</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> {{advocate}} of Scandinavianism and the political solidarity of the three northern kingdoms, and his friendship with Frederick VII of Denmark, it is said, led him to give half promises of help to Denmark {{on the eve of}} the war of 1864, which, in the circumstances, were perhaps misleading and unjustifiable. In view, however, of the unpreparedness of the Swedish army and the difficulties of the situation, Charles was forced to observe a strict neutrality. He died in Malmö on 18 September 1872.|$|E

The Winchester Geese were medieval sex workers in the Bankside brothels licensed by the Bishop of Winchester under Ordinances dating back to 1161.
