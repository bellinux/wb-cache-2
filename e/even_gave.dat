5|$|While at Coldwater Canyon in 1977, Cagney had a minor stroke. After {{two weeks}} in the hospital, Zimmermann became his {{full-time}} caregiver, traveling with Billie Vernon and him wherever they went.

Encouraged by his wife and Zimmermann, Cagney accepted an offer from the director Miloš Forman to star in a small but pivotal role in the film Ragtime (1981).|$|E

5|$|The Hamdanids' {{success and}} rule over the Abbasid capital lasted for {{little more than}} a year. They lacked funds and were {{politically}} isolated, finding little support among the Caliphate's most powerful vassals, the Samanids of Transoxiana and the Ikhshidids of Egypt. Consequently, when in late 943 a mutiny broke out among their troops (mostly composed of Turks, Daylamites, Carmathians and only a few Arabs) over pay issues, under the leadership of the Turkish general Tuzun, they were forced to quit Baghdad and return to their base, Mosul. Caliph al-Muttaqi now appointed Tuzun as amir al-umara, but the Turk's overbearing manner induced al-Muttaqi to once again seek refuge in the Hamdanid court. The Hamdanid forces under Sayf al-Dawla took the field against Tuzun's army, but were defeated. The Hamdanids now concluded an agreement with Tuzun which allowed them to keep the Jazira and <b>even</b> <b>gave</b> them nominal authority over northern Syria (which at the time was not under Hamdanid control), in exchange for an annual tribute of 3.6 million dirhams.|$|E

25|$|The Byzantines again summoned an {{enormous}} army gathered from all themes of their Empire including the guards of the Syrian passes.

25|$|The Replica Microman {{series was}} mainly aimed at adult {{collectors}} and older {{fans of the}} original toyline. This series launched in 1998 with the Microman Founder (M10X) series which reissued the Microman (M10X) figures. That release was soon followed by the reissue of many other classic Microman figures such as Acroyear (A30X), Spy Magician (M14X), Lady Command (M18X) and others. In addition to reissuing versions that adhered to the original, vintage Microman color combinations, Takara also released several limited edition, newly created color variants—and <b>even</b> <b>gave</b> them new Microman character names and designations—to add to the canon of the old series.|$|E
25|$|After Manzikert, the Seljuq Turks {{concentrated}} on their eastern territorial gains which were {{threatened by the}} Fatimid dynasty in Egypt although Alp Arslan encouraged other allied Turks and vassals to establish Beyliks in Asia Minor. Many Byzantines at the time {{did not see the}} victory as a total disaster and when the Turks began occupying the countryside in Anatolia they began to garrison the Byzantine cities as well, not as foreign conquerors but as mercenaries requested by various Byzantine factions – one Byzantine Emperor <b>even</b> <b>gave</b> the city of Nicaea's defense to the invading Turks in 1078.|$|E
25|$|Tibetan armies invaded Bhutan around 1629, in 1631, {{and again}} in 1639, hoping to {{throttle}} Ngawang Namgyal's popularity before it spread too far. In 1634 Ngawang Namgyal defeated Karma Tenkyong's army in the Battle of Five Lamas. The invasions were thwarted, and the Drukpa subsect developed a strong presence in western and central Bhutan, leaving Ngawang Namgyal supreme. In recognition of the power he accrued, goodwill missions were sent to Bhutan from Cooch Behar in the Duars (present-day northeastern West Bengal), Nepal to the west, and Ladakh in western Tibet. The ruler of Ladakh <b>even</b> <b>gave</b> a number of villages in his kingdom to Ngawang Namgyal.|$|E

25|$|On 22 August 1940, in the Gulf of Bomba, the Italian {{submarine}} Iride, being a human torpedo carrier, was sunk by a torpedo {{released by}} a British Fairey Swordfish bomber. The air attack happened during an exercise, in shallow water, when four human torpedo squads were around, including officers Teseo Tesei and Luigi Durand de la Penne. The divers {{were able to}} make an immediate rescue action. Of the 12 Iride crewmen who survived, two died during an unsuccessful attempt to surface, nine were retrieved alive (two of them died soon, due to wounds), and one was too shocked to leave the sunken submarine. De la Penne tried to persuade him to surface, and <b>even</b> <b>gave</b> him his own aqualung, but the seaman refused surfacing and died.|$|E
25|$|Henrietta Maria's {{religious}} activities {{appear to have}} focused on bringing a modern, 17th century European form of Catholicism to England. To some extent, it worked, with numerous conversions amongst Henrietta Maria's circle; historian Kevin Sharpe argues {{that there may have}} been up to 300,000 Catholics in England by the late 1630s– they were certainly more open in court society. Charles came under increasing criticism for his failure to act to stem the flow of high-profile conversions. Henrietta Maria <b>even</b> <b>gave</b> a requiem mass in her private chapel for Father Richard Blount, S.J. upon his death in 1638. Henrietta Maria also continued to act in masque plays throughout the 1630s, which met with criticism from the more Puritan wing of English society. In most of these masques she chose roles designed to advance ecumenism, Catholicism and the cult of Platonic love.|$|E
25|$|Under the {{leadership}} of Thurlow Weed, an anti-Masonic and anti-Andrew Jackson (Jackson was a Mason) movement grew to become the Anti-Masonic Party and made the ballot for the presidency in 1828 while gaining the support of such notable politicians as William H. Seward. Its influence was such that other Jackson rivals, including John Quincy Adams, denounced the Masons. In 1847, Adams wrote a widely distributed book titled Letters on the Masonic Institution that was {{highly critical of the}} Masons. In 1832, the party fielded William Wirt as its presidential candidate. This was rather ironic because he was, in fact, a Freemason, and <b>even</b> <b>gave</b> a speech at the Anti-Masonic convention defending the organization. The party only received seven electoral votes. Three years later, the party had disbanded in every state save Pennsylvania, as other issues such as slavery had become the focus of national attention.|$|E
