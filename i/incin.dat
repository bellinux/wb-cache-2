40|$|The {{ability of}} animals to extract {{predictive}} {{information from the}} environment to inform their future actions is {{a critical component of}} decision-making. This phenomenon is studied in the laboratory using the pavlovian–instrumental transfer protocol in which a stimulus predicting a specific pavlovian outcome biases choice toward those actions earning the predicted outcome. It is well established that this transfer effect ismediated by corticolimbic afferents on the nucleus accumbens shell (NAc-S), and recent evidence suggests that-opioid receptors (DORs) play an essential role in this effect. In DOR-eGFP knock-inmice, we show a persistent, learning-related plasticity in the translocation of DORs to the somatic plasma membrane of cholinergic interneurons (CINs) in the NAc-S during the encoding of the specific stimulus–outcomeassociations essential for pavlovian–instrumental transfer. We found that increasedmembraneDORexpres-sion reflected both stimulus-based predictions of reward {{and the degree to which}} these stimuli biased choice during the pavlovian– instrumental transfer test. Furthermore, this plasticity altered the firing pattern of CINs increasing the variance of action potential activity, aneffect thatwas exaggeratedbyDORstimulation. The relationshipbetween the inductionofmembraneDORexpression <b>inCINs</b> andbothpavlovian conditioning andpavlovian–instrumental transfer provides a highly specific function forDOR-relatedmodulation in the NAc-S, and it is consistent with an emerging role for striatal CIN activity in the processing of predictive information. Therefore, our results reveal evidenceof a long-term, experience-dependentplasticity inopioid receptor expressiononstriatalmodulatory interneurons critical for the cognitive control of action...|$|R
