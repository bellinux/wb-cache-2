60|$|Dolores tossed <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> made {{a sudden}} gesture of impatience.|$|E
60|$|She threw <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> {{laughed at}} him, this time heartily, unaffectedly.|$|E
60|$|She put <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> {{looked at}} him sideways, {{laughing}} through the glitter of her hair.|$|E
60|$|She {{stood up}} and faced him, slim and white-faced, yet with <b>her</b> <b>head</b> thrown <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> voice steady.|$|R
60|$|Instead of responding, {{her figure}} became limp, frigid, heavy; <b>her</b> <b>head</b> fell <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> {{he found that}} she had fainted.|$|R
60|$|The colour {{had faded}} out of Noel's face, <b>and,</b> with <b>her</b> <b>head</b> thrown <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> eyelids half-closed, {{she looked like}} a scornful young ghost.|$|R
60|$|She drew <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> looked with a {{challenging}} smile at Baldassarre, {{as if she}} had proposed a difficult riddle to him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{altogether}} {{agree with}} you there," [...] said Miss Mergle, throwing <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> regarding him firmly through her spectacles, and Mr. Widgery coughed.|$|E
60|$|She threw <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> laughed, laughed {{long and}} softly, and Tavernake, simple and unversed {{in the ways}} of women, {{believed}} that she was indeed amused.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Matlack {{was seated}} on his log, and he smoked, while Mrs. Perkenpine {{sat on the}} ground, <b>her</b> <b>head</b> thrown <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> arms hugging her knees.|$|R
60|$|Louisa turned {{upon her}} pillow, and heard no more. When {{her sister had}} withdrawn, she turned <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>back</b> again, <b>and</b> lay with her face towards the door, until it opened and her father entered.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} her, as, with <b>her</b> <b>head</b> thrown <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> hands tight clenched together, she uttered these words in an agony of appeal. Then, {{starting}} {{to his feet}} as she had done, he advanced towards her.|$|R
6000|$|... [MRS. GWYN {{drops her}} hand. She throws <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> her [...] throat {{is seen to}} work {{as though she were}} gulping down a bitter [...] draught. She moves away.] ...|$|E
6000|$|Averil moved petulantly; but {{the soft}} warm stream was so {{grateful}} to her burning brow, {{that she could not}} resist; she put <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> submitted like a child to have her face bathed, saying, 'Thank you.' ...|$|E
60|$|Saxon felt Billy's finger laid warningly on her lips. Guided by his hand, {{she turned}} <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> {{together}} they gazed far {{up the side}} of the knoll where a doe and a spotted fawn looked down upon them from a tiny open space between the trees.|$|E
60|$|Presently the {{violence}} of her sobbing diminished and {{she sat in the}} chair, exhausted, with <b>her</b> <b>head</b> thrown <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> arms hanging by her side. She had the grotesque look of one of those painters' dummies used to hang draperies on.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And then,' said Mrs Brown, {{with her}} arms uplifted towards the sky, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> thrown <b>back</b> <b>and</b> shaking, 'if he's true to his word, I'll never come a-near him though I know where he is, and never breathe a {{syllable}} about him! Never!' ...|$|R
60|$|He {{was in the}} act of {{concluding}} {{his explanation}} when another chuckle burst upon them from the region of the lamp. This time there was no attempt at concealment, for there stood old Kannoa, partly enveloped in savoury steam, <b>her</b> <b>head</b> thrown <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> mouth wide-open.|$|R
60|$|He {{started the}} refrain, {{and then the}} most frightful thing happened. The girl next to me got up in her seat, chucked <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> began to sing too. I say 'too', but it wasn't really too, because her first note stopped Gussie dead, {{as if he had}} been pole-axed.|$|E
60|$|Dolores {{read her}} letter {{over and over}} and over, for the {{pleasure}} of having something all to herself, and never communicated a word about the miscroscopic monsters her father had described, but she drew <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> reflected, 'He little knows,' when he spoke of her being happy among her cousins.|$|E
60|$|Jill {{had thrown}} <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> was singing jubilantly {{at the top}} of her voice. The appositeness of the song had cheered her up. It seemed somehow to make her forebodings rather ridiculous, to reduce them to absurdity, to turn into farce the {{gathering}} tragedy which had been weighing upon her nerves.|$|E
60|$|Jim, {{following}} {{the direction of}} his neighbour's eyes, found them to be fixed on a figure till that moment hidden from himself--Margery Tucker--who was crossing the garden to an opposite gate with a little cheese in <b>her</b> arms, <b>her</b> <b>head</b> thrown <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> face quite exposed.|$|R
6000|$|... "And when {{we loved}} each other," [...] Clotilde repeated, <b>her</b> <b>head</b> thrown <b>back</b> now, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> bearing as proud and haughty {{as that of}} Julia.|$|R
6000|$|Kate, however, to Mrs. Hale's indignation, threw <b>her</b> pretty <b>head</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> {{sniffed the}} air contemptuously. [...] "I really don't see {{anything}} but some absurd sentimentalism of their own, or some mannish wickedness they're concocting by themselves. I am by no means certain, Josephine, that Lee's influence over that young man {{is the best thing}} for him." ...|$|R
60|$|Then they bound Soa {{securely}} {{and set her}} in {{a corner}} of the throne chamber, and all that day Leonard and Francisco mounted guard over her alternately. She made no resistance and said nothing; indeed it seemed as if a certain lassitude had followed her outbreak of rage, for she leaned <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> slept, or made pretence to sleep.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then," [...] said Lady Hammergallow, {{throwing}} <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> {{speaking with}} deliberate indignation, as she rustled forward, [...] "if you cannot play with Mr Wilmerdings I am afraid I cannot {{ask you to}} play again." [...] She {{made it sound like}} an ultimatum. Her glasses in her hand quivered violently with indignation. The Angel was now human enough to appreciate {{the fact that he was}} crushed.|$|E
6000|$|In {{an instant}} Will {{was close to}} her and had his arms round her, but she drew <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> held his away gently that she might go on speaking, her large tear-filled eyes looking at his very simply, while {{she said in a}} sobbing childlike way, [...] "We could live quite well on my own fortune--it is too much--seven hundred a-year--I want so little--no new clothes--and I will learn what {{everything}} costs." ...|$|E
60|$|Outside, in the corridor, {{he heard}} voices, {{and again the}} knock at the door. He bade them enter. As the door opened Emma von der Tann, <b>her</b> <b>head</b> thrown <b>back</b> <b>and</b> a flush of anger on her face, entered the room. Behind her was the officer who had been {{despatched}} to bring her. Barney nodded to the latter.|$|R
50|$|Leaving little Jim {{alone on}} the beach, Janey leads Cady high into the woods. After posing for him, she takes his camera and tells him how to pose. She adjusts his shirt and tells him to strip off. Then she puts his camera aside and starts {{touching}} him all over. They kiss, <b>her</b> <b>head</b> tilts <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> the screen goes black-and-white.|$|R
60|$|She {{had just}} {{completed}} this task when she glanced up and saw a face at her window--indistinctly, for even as she raised <b>her</b> <b>head</b> it drew <b>back</b> <b>and</b> faded into the outer gloom.|$|R
6000|$|A {{discharge}} of firearms near by made her throw <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> close her eyes. Old Giorgio set his teeth hard under his white moustache, {{and his eyes}} began to roll fiercely. Several bullets struck {{the end of the}} wall together; pieces of plaster could be heard falling outside; a voice screamed [...] "Here they come!" [...] and after a moment of uneasy silence there was a rush of running feet along the front.|$|E
60|$|At {{the merest}} signal {{he was there}} with his violin under his arm. Mademoiselle whispered a word in his ear and he departed, all smiles. The {{selection}} which they were playing suddenly ceased. Monsieur le chef alone played some Italian air, which no one wholly recognized but every one found familiar. Slowly he walked around the tables, playing still, always with his eyes upon Mademoiselle Ixe, and when at last he stood before her, she threw <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> sang.|$|E
6000|$|... "Last night was--last night!" [...] said Maruja, {{slightly}} {{lifting her}} shoulders. [...] "One makes love at night--one marries in daylight. In the music, in the flowers, in the moonlight, one says everything; {{in the morning}} one has breakfast--when one is not asked to have councils of war with captains and commandantes. You would speak of my sister, Captain Car-roll--go on. Dona Amita Carroll sounds very, very pretty. I shall not object." [...] She held out both her hands to him, threw <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> smiled.|$|E
60|$|Then Miss Willoughby threw <b>her</b> shapely <b>head</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> the squeal of her {{laughter}} smote the ceiling. And at {{that the company}} made its decision. Everybody laughed. Everybody urged Ashe to give an encore. Everybody was his friend and admirer---everybody but Beach, the butler. Beach, the butler, was shocked to his very core. His heavy-lidded eyes rested on Ashe with disapproval. It seemed to Beach, the butler, that this young man Marson had got above himself.|$|R
60|$|She was {{standing}} with one foot advanced, as if {{in the act of}} springing on to it; one of her arms was held above <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> the other advanced across <b>her</b> body; <b>her</b> <b>head</b> was thrown <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> balance perfect.|$|R
60|$|The cab {{started on}} its journey; {{husband and wife}} {{preserving}} absolute silence. Anne laid <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>back</b> wearily, <b>and</b> closed <b>her</b> eyes. Her strength had broken down under the effort which had sustained her {{from the beginning to}} the end of the inquiry. Her power of thinking was gone. She felt nothing, knew nothing, feared nothing. Half in faintness, half in slumber, she had lost all sense of her own terrible position before the first five minutes of the journey to Fulham had come to an end.|$|R
