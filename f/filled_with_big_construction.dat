They are treated unjustly and are not fairly rewarded. Also, there is no balance between the social classes.

50|$|Early/late {{exhaust valve}} closingEarly and late exhaust valve closing can also reduce emissions. Traditionally, the exhaust valve opens, and exhaust gas is {{pushed out of}} the {{cylinder}} and into the exhaust manifold by the piston as it travels upward.

By holding the exhaust valve open slightly longer, the cylinder is emptied more and ready to be <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> a <b>bigger</b> air/fuel charge on the intake stroke. By closing the valve slightly early, more exhaust gas remains in the cylinder which increases fuel efficiency. This allows for more efficient operation under all conditions.|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of nanocomposite materials are controlled {{to a large}} extent by the filler-filler interactions. Nevertheless, another important contribution - less well understood - is due to the polymer chain-filler interactions. Experimentally, the radius of gyration (Rg) of polymer chains in nanocomposites can be measured by SANS using the zero average contrast conditions (mixing hydrogenated (H) and deuterated (D) chains) in order to match the filler signal and measure the chain form factor. However, many studies display an unexplained polluted SANS signal in the low-q range. In this talk, we will discuss the measurement of polymer chain signal in nanocomposites prepared from the drying of a colloidal dispersion of silica and polymer particles. In such samples, the mixture of H and D chains results from the dissolution of H and D latex beads. This dissolution was followed by SANS in the low q range, as function of thermal annealing (figure 1) and filler content using an original model [1]. Experimental results demonstrate that the dissolution dynamics of polymer chains is significantly slowed down by the presence of silica nanoparticles [1]. Besides, the effect of the filler size on the chain signal in the nanocomposites was studied by a combination of SAXS and SANS measurements and reveal that the filler contribute to the SANS signal in nanocomposites <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> small silica nanoparticles (compared to the latex beads) contrarily to nanocomposites <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>bigger</b> silica particles. We rationalize this observation considering an attractive interaction between polymers and silica particles leading to an inhibited interdiffusion of latex particles in the vicinity of silica particles, and a statistical local assymmetry due to the small number of latex beads defining the environment of small silica particles. Finally, no evolution of the polymer Rg was found in our samples. References[1] Genix et al., Macromolecules (2012), 45, 1663. [2] Banc et al., Macromolecules (2015), in press...|$|R

40|$|The {{proliferation}} of new “big box ” retail superstores {{throughout the nation}} challenges city and county planning departments {{to find ways to}} mitigate the economic, social, and environmental damage they cause.

40|$|Rummaging the ?queer? smelling attic of his parental home, a space <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> ?<b>big</b> trunks, broken furniture, old books, old clothes, and {{odds and}} ends of all sorts,? fifteen-year-old Forrest Reid hit upon a {{treasure}} that would furnish his listless life with a ?fresh stimulus?: stacks of ivory yellowed periodicals dating from the 1860 s, the decade prior to his birth. As he leafed through back numbers of Good Words, Cornhill, Quiver, Argosy and Once a Week, young Reid realised that here was the ?nucleus of a real collection? ? not of stories, essays or poems, but of the images that went with them. He was conscious that {{the removal of the}} illustrations from the magazines might be frowned upon as an act of vandalism; so, he secretly busied himself in the ?sunless pallor of the skylight? or even by candlelight to extract wood engravings that, as he recalled in his 1926 autobiography Apostate, ?possessed an increasing fascination? for him: ?They accepted life as it was and turned it into beauty; they invested the most homely material with a delicate and poetic charm. ? Reid had never been to a picture gallery ? and here was a chance to assemble one from the ?spoils of the lumber-room?. From the start, Reid?s collecting was studious and methodical: ?I cut out and mounted my pictures, carefully dating each drawing, and writing its title {{at the foot of the}} board, and the title of the magazine in which found it? (177). The use of possessive is telling here. By appropriating the images, by releasing them from the fictions they were designed to accompany and separating them from the publications they were intended to promote, the collector changed their value along with their meaning. Reid was not alone in this endeavour. Aficionados like Gleeson White and Harold Thomas Hartley concurred that magazine illustrations were well worth collecting, an engagement that elevated the ephemeral to the status of art or at least recognised its potentialities as art. This chapter examines the motives, methods, achievements and influences of those pioneer collectors ? their approaches and attitudes toward their pursuit as well as their own role and responsibilities ? and considers them in relation to the collector?s market from the 1860 s to the present day...|$|R

The {{influence of the}} particle size on the foam microstructure and its mechanical behaviour has been studied using calcium carbonate with two different sizes (with average diameter of 1 and 30 µm, respectively) and crystallised silica particles with an intermediate size. The microstructural characterisation has been performed by electron microscopy. It has shown closed spherical cells whose size is decreased when the fillers are added. The results of mechanical characterisation by large and small deformation (mechanical spectrometry) tests have been compared to different modelling approaches. It appeared that a correct description of the viscoelastic properties and of the yield stress needs {{to take into account}} the filler size compared to the wall size. Two modelling hypothesis which consider the composite foam as either a filler dispersion in a foam or a void dispersion in a filled polymer have been made.
