5|$|In his 1935 work Handbuch der systematischen Weichtierkunde (Handbook of Systematic Malacology), Johannes Thiele {{introduced}} a mollusc taxonomy {{based upon the}} 1909 work by Cossmann and Peyrot. Thiele's system divided the bivalves into three orders. Taxodonta consisted of forms that had taxodont dentition, {{with a series of}} small parallel teeth perpendicular to the <b>hinge</b> <b>line.</b> Anisomyaria consisted of forms that had either a single adductor muscle or one adductor muscle much smaller than the other. Eulamellibranchiata consisted of forms with ctenidial gills. The Eulamellibranchiata was further divided into four suborders: Schizodonta, Heterodonta, Adapedonta and Anomalodesmata.|$|E
5|$|The two valves of the bivalve shell {{are held}} {{together}} at the hinge by a ligament composed of two keratinised proteins, tensilium and resilium. In different groups of bivalves, the ligament may be internal or external in position. The main function of the ligament (as well as joining the valves together) is to passively cause the shell to open. The shell is actively closed using the adductor muscle or muscles which {{are attached to the}} inner surface of both valves. The position of the muscles is often clearly visible on the inside of empty valves as circular or oval muscle scars. Along the <b>hinge</b> <b>line</b> of the shell are, in most cases, a number of hinge teeth which prevent the valves from moving laterally relative to one another. The arrangement of these teeth is often important in identifying bivalves.|$|E
25|$|The {{hinge points}} along an entire folded surface form a <b>hinge</b> <b>line,</b> {{which can be}} either a crest line or a trough line. The trend and plunge of a linear <b>hinge</b> <b>line</b> gives you {{information}} about {{the orientation of the}} fold. To more completely describe the orientation of a fold, one must describe the axial surface. The axial surface is the surface defined by connecting all the hinge lines of stacked folding surfaces. If the axial surface is a planar surface then it is called the axial plane and can be described by the strike and dip of the plane. An axial trace is the line of intersection of the axial surface with any other surface (ground, side of mountain, geological cross-section).|$|E

Others, like the Spiriferinida and Terebratulida are basically smooth. Most have shells without perforations known as punctae and are impunctate but some e.g. Orthida and Rhynchonellida have punctate offshoots.|$|R

25|$|Finally, folds can have, but don't {{necessarily}} have a fold axis. A fold axis, “is the closest approximation to {{a straight line}} that when moved parallel to itself, generates {{the form of the}} fold.” (Davis and Reynolds, 1996 after Donath and Parker, 1964; Ramsay 1967). A fold that can be generated by a fold axis is called a cylindrical fold. This term has been broadened to include near-cylindrical folds. Often, the fold axis {{is the same as the}} <b>hinge</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
25|$|Lobe-finned fishes, fish {{belonging}} to the class Sarcopterygii, are mostly extinct bony fishes, basally characterised by robust and stubby lobe fins containing a robust internal skeleton, cosmoid scales and internal nostrils. Their fins are fleshy, lobed, paired fins, joined to the body by a single bone. The fins of lobe-finned fish {{differ from those of}} all other fish in that each is borne on a fleshy, lobelike, scaly stalk extending from the body. The pectoral and pelvic fins are articulated in ways resembling the tetrapod limbs they were the precursors to. The fins evolved into the legs of the first tetrapod land vertebrates, amphibians. They also possess two dorsal fins with separate bases, as opposed to the single dorsal fin of ray-finned fish. The braincase of lobe-finned fishes primitively has a <b>hinge</b> <b>line,</b> but this is lost in tetrapods and lungfish. Many early lobe-finned fishes have a symmetrical tail. All lobe-finned fishes possess teeth covered with true enamel.|$|E
500|$|As of 2016 {{there are}} no indisputable body fossils of phoronids. Researching the Lower Cambrian Chengjiang fossils, in 1997 Chen and Zhou {{interpreted}} Iotuba chengjiangensis as a phoronid since it had tentacles and a U-shaped gut, and in 2004 Chen interpreted Eophoronis as a phoronid. However, in 2006 Conway Morris regarded Iotuba and Eophoronis as synonyms for the same genus, which in his opinion looked like the priapulid Louisella. In 2009 Balthasar and Butterfield found in western Canada two specimens from about 505million years ago of a new fossil, Lingulosacculus nuda, which had two shells like those of brachiopods but not mineralized. In the authors' opinion, the U-shaped gut extended beyond the <b>hinge</b> <b>line</b> and outside the smaller shell. This would have precluded the attachment of muscles to close and open the shells, and the 50% of the animal's length beyond the <b>hinge</b> <b>line</b> would have needed longitudinal muscles and also a cuticle for protection. Hence they suggest that Lingulosacculus {{may have been a}} member of a phoronid stem group within the linguliform brachiopods. [...] Another alternative is that Eccentrotheca lies somewhere in the phoronid stem lineage.|$|E
40|$|The {{longitudinal}} aerodynamic {{characteristics of}} a 35 deg swept, variable camber and twist semispan wing {{in the presence of}} a body were studied. The variable camber and twist were incorporated to allow a near optimum lift distribution over the wing for both the cruise condition and the high lift conditions for maneuverability. The wing incorporated movable leading-edge segments whose swept <b>hinge</b> <b>lines</b> provided maximum camber variations at the outboard leading edge and movable trailing-edge segments whose swept <b>hinge</b> <b>lines</b> provided maximum camber variations near the inboard trailing edge.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that a global bending {{collapse}} hinge of thin-walled square metal tubes composed with a series of stationary <b>hinge</b> <b>lines,</b> rolling <b>hinge</b> <b>lines</b> and toroidal surfaces. In particular they have shown that the structures respond to quasi-static testing by means of an initial peak moment followed by a falling moment as deformation proceeds. This paper further studies, using finite element analysis, the bending collapse mechanism of thin-walled square metal tubes with a global hinge. Various finite element models are created with ABAQUS. Detailed numerical calculations are made in terms of the resultant moment-rotation curves, the overall collapse process, development of plastic <b>hinge</b> <b>lines,</b> profiles of the cross-section and distributions of stress and strain along the cross-section. Dimensional analysis theory reveals that the bending moment, M, depends on the ratio of width to thickness of the tube (b/t), the flow stress of the material (s 0) and the corresponding rotation angle (?). An empirical design formula for the bending moment is presented and compared with available test results. Finally, the strain-rate effect of the material is investigated for dynamic bending collapse of tubes...|$|R

500|$|The {{shell of}} a bivalve is {{composed}} of calcium carbonate, and consists of two, usually similar, parts called valves. These are joined together along one edge (the <b>hinge</b> <b>line)</b> by a flexible ligament that, usually in conjunction with interlocking [...] "teeth" [...] {{on each of the}} valves, forms the hinge. This arrangement allows the shell to be opened and closed without the two halves detaching. The shell is typically bilaterally symmetrical, with the hinge lying in the sagittal plane. Adult shell sizes of bivalves vary from fractions of a millimetre to over a metre in length, but the majority of species do not exceed 10cm (4in).|$|E

40|$|Based on {{experimental}} {{observations of}} a grid-domed textile composite under axial compression, the large deformation mechanisms of a flat-topped conical shell are identified. Accordingly, both elastic model and rigid-plastic model are proposed {{to describe the}} collapse process and predict the load-displacement characteristics. In the rigid-plastic analysis, the energies dissipated in bending along plastic <b>hinge</b> <b>lines</b> and in stretching of the thin-wall segments between the plastic <b>hinge</b> <b>lines</b> are taken into account. Analytical expressions describing the load-displacement and energy-displacement relationships during the large deformation process are derived. Illustrated by typical numerical examples, the effects of apical angle of a flat-topped conical shell on its energy absorption capacity are revealed. The respective strain distributions on the conical shell resulted from bending deformation and membrane deformation are presented.

25|$|Shear zones that {{approximate}} {{to simple}} shear typically contain minor asymmetric folds, {{with the direction}} of overturning consistent with the overall shear sense.

2500|$|Another weight-saving concept the {{designers}} {{came up with}} was detachable wingtips. The wings were designed to fold at a point about [...] out along the span, reducing the space taken up on the carrier. Normally the hinge system {{would have to be}} built very strong in order to transmit loads from the outer portions of the wing to the main spar in the inner section, which adds considerable weight. Instead of building the entire wing to be able to withstand high-g loads, only the inner portion of the wing was able to do this. The outer portions were more lightly constructed, and designed to snap off at the <b>hinge</b> <b>line</b> if the g-force exceeded 7.5g. In this case the aircraft would still be flyable and could be repaired after returning to the carrier. This saved [...] of weight.|$|E
2500|$|Ridley had {{to rise to}} meet {{unexpected}} {{problems and}} new aerodynamic principles. He faced the problem of a complete loss of elevator effectiveness which Yeager experienced during his eighth powered flight as his Mach meter indicated a speed of Mach 0.94 (his true airspeed was {{in the range of}} 0.96-0.99 Mach, just below the speed of sound). At that speed, the little research plane stopped responding to all elevator control inputs, leaving the pilot unable to change his pitch angle, or to raise or lower the plane's nose in flight. When speed decreased slightly, the problem abruptly disappeared. Analysis suggested that a shockwave was forming along the elevator's <b>hinge</b> <b>line,</b> leaving it ineffective. Ridley determined in that speed range, the elevator itself could safely be dispensed with and the X-1's entire horizontal stabilizer, which could be adjusted for trim changes, be used for pitch control. The idea worked, and Ridley's concept eventually came to be incorporated in all supersonic aircraft the [...] "flying tail." ...|$|E
2500|$|The S.E.1 {{made its}} first flight, a {{straight}} mile {{in the hands of}} its designer Geoffrey de Havilland on 11 June 1911. [...] Further fight testing revealed control problems and the area of the front wing/elevator was adjusted to try to bring together the centre of pressure and the <b>hinge</b> <b>line</b> and make the S.E.1 stable in pitch. By the beginning of August the front surface was fixed and carried a conventional trailing edge elevator. [...] An attempt to improve the turning characteristics was made by stripping the side covering of the nacelle to reduce side area. [...] de Havilland continued to fly the S.E.1 until 16 August. On 18 August the aircraft was flown by the rather inexperienced pilot Lt. Theodore J. Ridge, Assistant Superintendent at the factory (whose previous experience was chiefly with dirigibles, and had only been awarded his Pilot's certificate the day before, and was described as [...] "an absolutely indifferent flyer"). Both [...] "the designer" [...] and a factory engineer warned him against flying it. The combination of the inexperienced pilot and the marginally controllable aircraft proved fatal - while landing he made a sharp turn with the engine off; the S.E.1 stalled and spun in, killing Ridge.|$|E
30|$|Also, {{note that}} in the {{kinematic}} limit analysis of plates, the ability to obtain the strict upper bound depends {{not only on the}} efficient solution of the arising optimization problem but also on the effectiveness of the elements employed. It is required that the flow rule needs hold throughout each element. For the C 1 -continuous elements, this requirement can be satisfied naturally. However, for the C 0 -continuous elements, it can be violated due to the appearance of plastic <b>hinge</b> <b>lines</b> on boundaries of elements. In order to overcome this violation, the internal work dissipated in resulting <b>hinge</b> <b>lines</b> on boundaries of elements should be taken into account as done by Hodge and Belytschko [7] and Makrodimopoulos and Martin [82]. In this paper, the CS-MIN 3 uses only three-node triangular plate elements and hence belongs to the C 0 -continuous elements. However, for the sake of simplicity of using the CS-MIN 3 in the limit analysis of plates, we can ignore considering the internal work dissipated in resulting <b>hinge</b> <b>lines</b> on boundaries of elements. It is therefore no longer possible to guarantee that the solution obtained from the minimization problem (47) is a strict upper bound on the collapse multiplier. However, using the smoothed strain rates which are constant over elements, the flow rule only needs to be enforced at any point in each element, and it is guaranteed to be satisfied almost everywhere in the problem domain. Therefore, the computed collapse load obtained using the proposed method can still be reasonably considered as an upper bound on the actual value.|$|R

2500|$|However, the {{majority}} of scallops are free-living and can swim with brief bursts of speed to escape predators (mostly starfish) by rapidly opening and closing their valves. [...] Indeed, everything about their characteristic shell shape – its symmetry, narrowness, smooth and/ or grooved surface, small flexible hinge, powerful adductor muscle, and continuous and uniformly curved edge – facilitates such activity. They often do this in spurts of several seconds before closing the shell entirely and sinking back {{to the bottom of}} their environment. Scallops are able to move through the water column either forward/ ventrally (termed swimming) by sucking water in through the space between their valves, an area called the gape, and ejecting it through small holes near the <b>hinge</b> <b>line</b> called exhalant apertures, or backward/ dorsally (termed jumping) by ejecting the water out the same way it came in (i.e., ventrally). [...] A jumping scallop will usually land on the sea floor between each contraction of its valves, whereas a swimming scallop will stay in the water column for most or all of its contractions and will travel a much greater distance (though seldom at a height of more than one meter off the sea bed and seldom for a distance of greater than five meters). [...] Both jumping and swimming movements are very energy-intensive and most scallops cannot perform more than four or five in a row before becoming completely exhausted and requiring several hours of rest. Should a swimming scallop land on its left side, it is capable of flipping itself over to its right side via a similar shell-clapping movement called the righting reflex. So-called singing scallops are rumored to make an audible, soft popping sound as they flap their shells underwater (though whether or not this happens is open to some debate). [...] Other scallops can extend their foot from between their valves, and by contracting the muscles in their foot, they can burrow into sand.|$|E
2500|$|The model scallop shell {{consists}} of two similarly shaped valves with a straight <b>hinge</b> <b>line</b> along the top, devoid of teeth and producing a pair of flat wings or [...] "ears" [...] (sometimes called [...] "auricles", though {{this is also the}} term for two chambers in its heart) on either side of its midpoint, a feature which is unique to and apparent in all adult scallops. [...] These ears may be of similar size and shape, or the anterior ear may be somewhat larger (the posterior ear is never larger than the anterior one, an important feature for distinguishing which valve is which). [...] As is the case in almost all bivalves, a series of lines and/ or growth rings originate {{at the center of the}} hinge, at a spot called the beak surrounded by a generally raised area called the umbo. [...] These growth rings increase in size downwards until they reach the curved ventral edge of the shell. The shell of most scallops is streamlined to facilitate ease of movement during swimming at some point in the life cycle, while also providing protection from predators. [...] Scallops with ridged valves have the advantage of the architectural strength provided by these ridges called ribs, although the ribs are somewhat costly in terms of weight and mass. [...] A feature that is unique to the members of the scallop family is the presence, at some point during the animal's life cycle, of a distinctive and taxonomically important shell feature, a comb-like structure called a ctenolium located on the anterior edge of the right valve next to the valve's byssal notch. Though many scallops lose this feature as they become free-swimming adults, all scallops have a ctenolium at some point during their lives, and no other bivalve has an analogous shell feature. [...] The ctenolium is found in modern scallops only; the ancestors of modern scallops, the entoliids, did not possess it.|$|E

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the cleavage-fold {{relationships}} in the Lower Palaeozoic Brabant Massif, primarily because of the scarcity of suitable exposures. Moreover, to date, folds have only been described in the Ordovician and Silurian sequences along the southern extremity of the basement. However, excavation works for the construction of the TGV(railway) -track south of Brussels created an opportunity to study cleavage-fold relationships in the Lower Cambrian terrigenous series (Tubize Group) in a more central part of the Brabant Massif. The structural features observed seemed inconsistent with the suspected regional trends. Primarily, a divergent cleavage fan was observed in a region thought to have a regular cleavage attitude. The symmetrical but divergent disposition of the cleavage with regard to the fold hinges is explained by flexural folding of a pre-existing bedding-parallel compaction fabric. Cleavage development and folding are considered synchronous. The divergent cleavage fan reflects local strain variations. Also the steeply plunging <b>hinge</b> <b>lines</b> of the open, subangular folds are seemingly inconsistent with the regional trend characterized by subhorizontal fold hinges.

Each of the deformation phases is characterised by a foliation. D₁ is associated With pure shear dominated layer-parallel extension characterised by disrupted lithological layering and hedding-parallel foliation S₀+₁.
