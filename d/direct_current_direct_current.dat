5000|$|In 1878 {{inventor}} Thomas Edison saw {{a market}} for a system that could bring electric lighting directly into a customer's business or home, a niche not served by arc lighting systems. By 1882 the investor-owned utility Edison Illuminating Company was established in New York City. Edison designed his [...] "utility" [...] {{to compete with the}} then established gas lighting utilities, basing it on a relatively low 110 volt direct current supply to power a high resistance incandescent lamp he had invented for the system. Edison direct current systems would be sold to cities throughout the United States, making it a standard with Edison controlling all technical development and holding all the key patents. Direct current worked well with incandescent lamps, which were the principal load of the day. Direct-current systems could be directly used with storage batteries, providing valuable load-leveling and backup power during interruptions of generator operation. Direct-current generators could be easily paralleled, allowing economical operation by using smaller machines during periods of light load and improving reliability. Edison had invented a meter to allow customers to be billed for energy proportional to consumption, but this meter worked only with <b>direct</b> <b>current.</b> <b>Direct</b> <b>current</b> also worked well with electric motors, an advantage DC would hold throughout the 1880s. The primary drawback with the Edison direct current system was that it ran at 110 volts from generation to its final destination giving it a relatively short useful transmission range: to keep the size of the expensive copper conductors down generating plants had to be situated in the middle of population centers and could only supply customers {{less than a mile from}} the plant.|$|E

Introduction: Alternating current will {{perhaps in}} time {{supplant}} <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> for traction purposes {{as it did}} in lighting, {{with the advent of the}} long distance high potential transmission, but as yet the <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> plays a very important part in both power and traction. It has however the disadvantage of being difficult to transmit long distances without great loss. This is due to the inherent limitations in the production of high voltages from the <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> generator. Commutation at voltages sufficiently high to warrant economical transmission over long distances, is extremely difficult. Sparking and other difficulties at once arise which place the voltage within the limitations mentioned. The alternating current generator has not only the advantage of higher voltage, but by means of suitable transformer devices the voltage may be raised to any desired value for economical transmission. It will be readily seen, therefore, that alternating <b>current</b> machinery will supplant the <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> for traction purposes. In this thesis only <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> is treated. <b>Direct</b> <b>current</b> on a small scale and for local distribution fulfills more nearly the requirements demanded for traction purposes such as is needed on railways.

The project is about the designing {{and implementation of the}} electrical drive system of a solar powered car. The solar panel collects energy from the sun during the day time and stores this in a lead-acid battery through a charge controller that to drive the motor of the car. The charge controller circuit has been used to supply the battery with the maximum amount charge possible, while protecting it from overcharge by the solar panels or the electric source as well as over discharge by the motor. Functionality of both the driver circuit and the charge controller circuit are controlled by the PIC 16 F 876 A microcontroller. For the charge controller circuit, the PIC detects the current and voltage of the battery and thereby, according to the state of the battery, it feeds back a Pulse-Width Modulated (PWM) flow of charge from the panel to the battery. As the whole thesis project is based on <b>Direct</b> <b>Current</b> Power System, <b>Direct</b> <b>Current</b> (DC) motors are worthier in this case. DC motor has become familiar as an essential drive configuration or pattern for many applications widely in terms of power and speed.

This study was conducted at the Kathu Campus of the Northern Cape Rural Further Education and Training College in the town Kathu in the arid Northern Cape. The empirical part of this study was conducted during the first six months of 2013. A design-based research (DBR) method consisting of four phases was used. DBR function is to design and develop interventions such as a procedure, new teachinglearning strategies, and in the case of this study a technology-enhanced learning (TEL) tool (screencast) with the purpose of solving a versatile didactic problem and to acquire information about the interventions of the TEL tool (screencast) on the learning of a student. In the first and second phase of DBR quantitative data for this research were gathered with the Determining and Interpreting Resistive Electric circuits Concepts Test (DIRECT) in order to determine the four most common misconceptions. The DIRECT test was conducted in the first trimester to find the misconceptions; the test was conducted in the second trimester also to confirm the misconceptions. Further quantitative data were collected from a demographic questionnaire. The qualitative data were collected by individual interviews in the fourth phase of the research project. Phase three of this study was the development of screencasts in the four most prominent misconceptions in DC resistive circuits of the students. The respondents of this study were non-randomly chosen and comprised of two groups, one in the first trimester of the year and one in the second trimester of the year, which enrolled for the N 2 Electrical or Millwright courses. The respondents were predominant male and representing the three main cultural groups in the Northern Cape namely: Black, Coloured and White. The four misconceptions on DC resistive circuits that were identified were: (i) understanding of concepts, (ii) understanding of short circuit, (iii) battery as a constant current source, and (iv) rule application error. Screencasts clarifying the four misconceptions were developed and distributed to the respondents. On the foundation of the results of this research, it can be concluded that the students have several misconceptions around <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> resistive <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> circuits and that the use of TEL like screencasts can be used to solve some of these misconceptions. Screencasts could supplement education when they were incorporated into the tutoring and learning for supporting student understanding.

Therefore, the objectives of this research were to: 1) use three model cyprinid fish species to determine the voltage type (virtual <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> or pulsed <b>direct</b> <b>current),</b> exposure duration, and voltage gradient necessary to cause significantly increased embryo mortality, and determine the most vulnerable developmental stages of the embryos of these species to estimate the effects of electricity on silver carp embryos; 2) test the effects of multiple exposures on the survival of zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos with different resting intervals between shocking events to determine how multiple exposures affects fish embryo survival; and 3) determine the lethal concentration 50 (LC 50) of rotenone to zebrafish embryos to test the combined effects of electricity plus rotenone on zebrafish embryos when applied at concentrations at and below the LC 50 value during electroshocking to determine if the simultaneous stressors can result in higher mortality than has been previously seen with electrical field exposures alone. The results of this research are consistent with previous research in that embryo survival across all species tested was related to developmental stage and voltage gradient. Zebrafish embryo survival was also affected by differences in current type and exposure duration. Surprisingly, zebrafish embryos were not affected by multiple exposures to electrical fields. Furthermore, when rotenone was added at values 10 and 100 X lower than the LC 50, no signs of increased mortality were observed. In terms of controlling Asian carp with electricity at early life history stages, the results of this research are discouraging. If the carp respond the same as the species in this study, then the amount of electricity necessary to cause mortality is impractical in a field application. However, since Asian carp embryos are much larger than the embryos used in this study, lower voltage gradients might cause higher mortality compared to the species studied here. Unfortunately, due to complications with obtaining carp embryos, the number of embryos exposed in this research was minimal, and further testing is necessary to explicitly determine the effectiveness of using electricity as a means of controlling these invasive cyprinids. ...|$|R
