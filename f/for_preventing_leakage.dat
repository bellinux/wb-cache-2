40|$|Background: Incontinence is {{a common}} and {{embarrassing}} problem which has {{a profound effect on}} social and psychological well-being. Many people wear absorbent products to contain urine leakage and protect their clothes. It can be difficult to define light urinary incontinence because urine volumes, flow and frequency rates may vary substantially whilst still being considered 'light'. Light incontinence may encompass occasional (monthly) leaks of very small amounts (e. g. 1 g to 2 g) up to frequent leaks (several times per day) of larger amounts (e. g. 20 g to 50 g). A practical definition is urine loss that can be contained within a small absorbent pad (typically 50 g to 500 g; ISO 1996). Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of different types of absorbent product designs for women with light urinary incontinence. Search strategy: We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Trials Register (3 May 2006) and the reference lists of relevant articles were perused. Selection criteria Types of studies: All randomised or quasi-randomised trials of absorbent products for women with light urinary incontinence. Types of participants: Women with light urinary incontinence. Types of intervention: Absorbent products (disposable insert pads, menstrual pads, washable pants with integral pad, washable insert pads) suitable for light incontinence. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors assessed the methodological quality of potentially eligible studies and independently extracted data from the included trial. Main results: One study with 85 participants met the selection criteria. This trial studied all the absorbent product designs included in this review. Data were presented on all included outcomes. <b>For</b> <b>preventing</b> <b>leakage,</b> for preference and for overall acceptability disposable insert pads are better than disposable menstrual pads which are better than washable pants with integral pad which are better than washable insert pads. There is no strong evidence that either disposables or washables are better for skin health. The disposable insert is the most expensive design and there is no dominant design for cost-effectiveness. There is evidence that some women will prefer alternative designs which are all cheaper than disposable inserts. Authors' conclusions: Although data were available from only one eligible trial the data were sufficiently robust to make recommendations for practice. Disposable insert pads are typically more effective than the other designs considered. However, because they are the most expensive, providing choice of designs (or combinations of designs for different circumstances) is likely to be cost-effective...|$|E

Most of the fabricated FinFETs are on SOI substrates. But fabrication of FinFETs using the bulk CMOS substrates instead of SOI technology is also of interest since it reduces the process costs.

It is shown numerically that the qubit behaves as a giant magnetic dipole with quantum tunneling between the two qubit states. The natural coupling between qubits plus the manipulation on a single qubit state provides the building blocks for universal quantum computing. The state of the qubit can be determined by measuring its flux with a SQUID. The measurement efficiency and measurement-induced decoherence are investigated. A coherent transition assisted scheme is designed for a projective measurement on the qubit. A general method is developed to study qubit decoherence by environmental noise.

40|$|Abstract. In fully {{distributed}} machine learning, {{privacy and}} security are impor-tant issues. These issues are often dealt with using secure multiparty computa-tion (MPC). However, in our application domain, known MPC algorithms are not scalable or not robust enough. We propose a light-weight protocol to quickly and securely compute {{the sum of}} the inputs of a subset of participants assuming a semi-honest adversary. During the computation the participants learn no individ-ual values. We apply this protocol to efficiently calculate the sum of gradients as part of a fully distributed mini-batch stochastic gradient descent algorithm. The protocol achieves scalability and robustness by exploiting the fact that in this application domain a “quick and dirty ” sum computation is acceptable. In other words, speed and robustness takes precedence over precision. We analyze the protocol theoretically as well as experimentally based on churn statistics from a real smartphone trace. We derive a sufficient condition <b>for</b> <b>preventing</b> the <b>leakage</b> of an individual value, and we demonstrate the feasibility of the overhead of the protocol...|$|R
40|$|The Australian Government's Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS), March 2009, set {{a target}} of 5 to 15 per cent {{emission}} cuts during 2000 and 2020. The proposed target is weak {{and is likely to}} increase mitigation costs in Australia in the long run. This research report analyses the target’s efficiency as well as provisions <b>for</b> <b>preventing</b> carbon <b>leakage.</b> The research also looks at the nature of changes to the CPRS made during 2008 as well as the likely cause of these changes. The free allocation of output-linked, tradable permits to Emissions-Intensive, Trade-Exposed (EITE) sectors was much higher than previously proposed and greater than what is needed to <b>prevent</b> carbon <b>leakage.</b> This means EITE emissions could rise by 13 per cent during 2010 and 2020. To meet the proposed national targets, non-EITE sectors must also cut emissions by 34 to 51 per cent (or make equivalent permit imports). This is far from a cost-effective outcome. The weak targets and over-generous EITE assistance illustrate how collective action by the ‘carbon lobby’ can damage economic efficiency. To resist this, new national or international institutions to assess lobby claims impartially are needed. More government publicity about the true economic importance of carbon-intensive sectors is also required. Over-concern that voluntary emission cuts will be nullified by the CPRS is another, different, demonstration of lobby power. climate policy, Australia, targets, emission trading, carbon leakage, lobbying, Environmental Economics and Policy, Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|R
40|$|Channelrhodopsin (ChR) is a light-gated cation {{channel that}} {{responds}} to blue light. Since ChR {{can be readily}} expressed in specific neurons to precisely control their activities by light, {{it has become a}} powerful tool in neuroscience. Although the recently solved crystal structure of a chimeric ChR, C 1 C 2, provided the structural basis for ChR, our understand-ing of the molecular mechanism of ChR still remains limited. Here we performed electrophysiological analyses and all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, to investigate the importance of the intracellular and central constrictions of the ion conduct-ing pore observed in the crystal structure of C 1 C 2. Our electrophysiological analysis revealed that two glutamate residues, Glu 122 and Glu 129, in the intracellular and central constrictions, respectively, should be deprotonated in the photocycle. The simulation results suggested that the deprotonation of Glu 129 in the central constriction leads to ion leakage in the ground state, and implied that the protonation of Glu 129 is important <b>for</b> <b>preventing</b> ion <b>leakage</b> in the ground state.

40|$|Two methods, {{namely the}} {{air-tight}} sheet method and the vacuum-drain method (sheetless), are generally used to conduct vacuum consolidation in the field. The {{advantages and disadvantages}} of both methods and the techniques <b>for</b> <b>preventing</b> vacuum <b>leakage</b> through a middle sand layer in a deposit, as well as the method for maintaining vacuum pressure when large settlement occurs, have been described. Vacuum pressure is an isotropic consolidation pressure applied to a soil deposit, and the deformation induced is different from that induced by a surcharge (e. g. the weight of an embankment). Two typical case histories in Japan are presented and deformation analyses were conducted. In one case history the vacuum-drain method was used with vacuum pressure alone, and in the other a combination of embankment loading and vacuum pressure was applied employing the air-tight sheet method. It is shown that under vacuum pressure loading, the ground deformation (settlement and lateral displacement) can be calculated reliably using a method proposed previously. For the case involving a combination of vacuum pressure and embankment load, the settlements under the embankment centreline can be estimated reasonably assuming one-dimensional deformation conditions...|$|R
40|$|While {{information}} sharing can benefit supply chains significantly, {{it may also}} have a "side effect", namely, information leakage. A limitation common to many existing solutions <b>for</b> <b>preventing</b> information <b>leakage</b> in supply chains is that they rely, either implicitly or explicitly, upon two unrealistic assumptions. First, what information is confidential is well known. Second, confidential information will not be revealed, if only it is not shared, regardless of how much other information is being shared. As it shall be shown in this thesis, those assumptions are not always true due to potential information leakage caused by inferences. Specifically, a conceptual model of such information leakage is proposed in this thesis. The model will enable companies in a supply chain to better understand how their confidential information may be leaked through inferences. On {{the basis of the}} proposed conceptual model, a quantitative approach is devised to evaluate the risk of information leakage caused by inferences when a given amount of information is shared. The quantitative approach will allow companies in a supply chain to measure and consequently to mitigate the risk of information leakage. Finally, a case study is discussed to illustrate how the proposed approaches work in practice...|$|R

MethodsThirty-three beagle dogs were divided into 7 groups, and each underwent thoracotomy. Right middle lobe incision was performed with a linear stapler and 1 of the following buttress methods: group A, no buttress; group B, polyglycolic acid nonwoven fabric; group C, fibrin glue alone; group D, polyglycolic acid nonwoven fabric with fibrin glue; group E, polyglycomer sheet; group F, new alginate material; and group G, polyglycolic acid nonwoven fabric plus new alginate material. Burst pressures were measured under mechanical ventilation management. ResultsBurst pressures were 12. 0 ± 6. 8 cm H 2 O in group A, 31. 3 ± 6. 6 cm H 2 O in group B, 13. 9 ± 3. 8 cm H 2 O in group C, 26. 9 ± 2. 8 cm H 2 O in group D, 24. 8 ± 1. 8 cm H 2 O in group E, 48. 5 ± 4. 9 cm H 2 O in group F, and 54. 2 ± 12. 4 cm H 2 O in group G.

40|$|With the {{large-scale}} research in space sciences and technologies, {{there is a}} great demand of satellite image security system for providing secure storage and transmission of satellite images. As the demand to protect the sensitive and valuable data from satellites has increased and hence proposed a new method for satellite image security by combining DWT-DCT watermarking and AES encryption. Watermarking techniques developed for multimedia data cannot be directly applied to the satellite images because here the analytic integrity of the data, rather than perceptual quality, is of primary importance. To improve performance, combine discrete wavelet transform (DWT) with another equally powerful transform; the discrete cosine transform (DCT). The combined DWT-DCT watermarking algorithm’s imperceptibility was better than the performance of the DWT approach. Modified decision based unsymmetrical trimmed median filter (MDBUTMF) algorithm is proposed for the restoration of satellite images that are highly corrupted by salt and pepper noise. Satellite images desire not only the watermarking for copyright protection but also encryption during storage and transmission <b>for</b> <b>preventing</b> information <b>leakage.</b> Hence this paper investigates the security and performance level of joint DWT-DCT watermarking and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for satellite imagery.

40|$|Endothelial barrier {{dysfunction}} is {{a hallmark}} of many severe pathologies, including sepsis or atherosclerosis. The cardiovascular hormone atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) has increasingly been suggested to counteract endothelial leakage. Surprisingly, the precise in vivo relevance of these observations has never been evaluated. Thus, we aimed to clarify this issue and, moreover, to identify the permeability-controlling subcellular systems that are targeted by ANP. Histamine was used as important pro-inflammatory, permeability-increasing stimulus. Measurements of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) -dextran extravasation from venules of the mouse cremaster muscle and rat hematocrit values were performed to judge changes of endothelial permeability in vivo. It is noteworthy that ANP strongly reduced the histamine-evoked endothelial barrier dysfunction in vivo. In vitro, ANP blocked the breakdown of transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) induced by histamine. Moreover, as judged by immunocytochemistry and Western blot analysis, ANP inhibited changes of vascular endothelial (VE) -cadherin, β-catenin, and p 120 ctn morphology; VE-cadherin and myosin light chain 2 (MLC 2) phosphorylation; and F-actin stress fiber formation. These changes seem to be predominantly mediated by the natriuretic peptide receptor (NPR) -A, but not by NPR-C. In summary, we revealed ANP as a potent endothelial barrier protecting agent in vivo and identified adherens junctions and the contractile apparatus as subcellular systems targeted by ANP. Thus, our study highlights ANP as an interesting pharmacological compound opening new therapeutic options <b>for</b> <b>preventing</b> endothelial <b>leakage.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: In some cases, {{spontaneous}} pneumothorax may require surgery, but in poor risk patients, pleurodesis {{may be a}} reasonable choice. Pleurodedis with autologous blood necessitates the clampage of the chest tube for a period. Excess air leakage from the chest tube may avoid the clampage. A simple technique without clamping the chest tube during pleurodesis is described which we used in patients with persistent air leak. Material and Method: The study comprised 11 patients diagnosed with {{spontaneous pneumothorax}} who were treated by autologous blood patch pleurodesis without clamping the chest tube. Pleurodesis was performed at the bedside by giving 50 ml autologous blood into the pleural cavity. The tube was lifted up to form a loop, {{in order to prevent}} the blood from draining into the bottle. Cessation of air leak at the end of 72 hours was accepted as complete response, whereas a marked decrease in air leakage was accepted as partial response to the procedure. Results: The mean age and age range of 10 male and 1 female patients were 55. 6 + 15. 7 and 29 - 75, consecutively. Complete response was obtained in 6 patients (% 54. 5), partial in 4 (% 36. 4). Air drainage continued without any change in 1 patient. Complications were empyema (1 patient) and intrathoracic coagulum (1 patient). Conclusion: The aforementioned loop technique facilitates the execution of autologous blood patch pleurodesis, particularly in patients with an excessive air leak. In our opinion, it is a reliable technique both <b>for</b> <b>preventing</b> air <b>leakage</b> and achieving pleurodesis in selective patients unsuitable for surgery...|$|R
