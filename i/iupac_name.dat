5|$|Ununennium, {{also known}} as eka-francium or simply element 119, is the {{hypothetical}} chemical element with symbol Uue and atomic number 119. Ununennium and Uue are the temporary systematic <b>IUPAC</b> <b>name</b> and symbol respectively, until a permanent name is decided upon. In the periodic table of the elements, {{it is expected to}} be an s-block element, an alkali metal, and the first element in the eighth period.|$|E

5|$|Unbinilium, {{also known}} as eka-radium or simply element 120, is the {{hypothetical}} chemical element in the periodic table with symbol Ubn and atomic number 120. Unbinilium and Ubn are the temporary systematic <b>IUPAC</b> <b>name</b> and symbol, until a permanent name is decided upon. In the periodic table of the elements, {{it is expected to}} be an s-block element, an alkaline earth metal, and the second element in the eighth period. It has attracted attention because of some predictions that it may be in the island of stability, although newer calculations expect the island to actually occur at a slightly lower atomic number, closer to copernicium and flerovium.|$|E
5|$|Unbiunium, {{also known}} as eka-actinium or element 121, is the {{hypothetical}} chemical element with symbol Ubu and atomic number 121. Unbiunium and Ubu are the temporary systematic <b>IUPAC</b> <b>name</b> and symbol, until a permanent name is decided upon. In the periodic table of the elements, {{it is expected to}} be the first of the superactinides, and the third element in the eighth period: analogously to lanthanum and actinium, it could be considered the fifth member of group 3 and the first member of the fifth-row transition metals. It has attracted attention because of some predictions that it may be in the island of stability, although newer calculations expect the island to actually occur at a slightly lower atomic number, closer to copernicium and flerovium.|$|E
25|$|The 1979 IUPAC {{nomenclature}} rules made {{an exception for}} retaining the non-systematic name ethylene, however, this decision was reversed in the 1993 rules so the <b>IUPAC</b> <b>name</b> is now ethene.|$|E

25|$|Water {{has several}} {{systematic}} names, including oxidane (the <b>IUPAC</b> <b>name),</b> hydrogen oxide, and dihydrogen monoxide (DHMO).

25|$|Polyethylene or {{polythene}} (abbreviated PE; <b>IUPAC</b> <b>name</b> polyethene or poly(ethylene)) is {{the most}} common plastic. The annual global production is around 80 million tonnes. Its primary use is in packaging (plastic bags, plastic films, geomembranes, containers including bottles, etc.). Many kinds of polyethylene are known, with most having the chemical formula (C2H4)n. PE is usually a mixture of similar polymers of ethylene with various values of n.|$|E
25|$|It is {{difficult}} or impossible to find compounds {{with more than one}} <b>IUPAC</b> <b>name.</b> This is because shorter chains attached to longer chains are prefixes and the convention includes brackets. Numbers in the name, referring to which carbon a group is attached to, should be as low as possible so that 1- is implied and usually omitted from names of organic compounds with only one side-group. Symmetric compounds will have two ways of arriving at the same name.|$|E
25|$|The {{ingredient}} or monomer is ethylene (<b>IUPAC</b> <b>name</b> ethene), a {{gaseous hydrocarbon}} with the formula C2H4, {{which can be}} viewed as a pair of methylene groups (––) connected to each other. Because the compound is highly reactive, the ethylene must be of high purity. Typical specifications are <5 ppm for water, oxygen, and other alkenes. Acceptable contaminants include N2, ethane (common precursor to ethylene), and methane. Ethylene is usually produced from petrochemical sources, but also is generated by dehydration of ethanol.|$|E

25|$|The suffix -ol {{appears in}} the IUPAC {{chemical}} name of all substances where the hydroxyl group is the functional group with the highest priority; in substances where a higher priority group is present the prefix hydroxy- {{will appear in the}} International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (<b>IUPAC)</b> <b>name.</b> The suffix -ol in non-systematic names (such as paracetamol or cholesterol) also typically indicates that the substance includes a hydroxyl functional group and, so, can be termed an alcohol. But many substances, particularly sugars (examples glucose and sucrose) contain hydroxyl functional groups without using the suffix. An important class of alcohols, of which methanol and ethanol are the simplest members is the saturated straight chain alcohols, the general formula for which is CnH2n+1OH.|$|E
25|$|Saffron {{contains}} more than 150 volatile and aroma-yielding compounds. It also has many nonvolatile active components, {{many of which are}} carotenoids, including zeaxanthin, lycopene, and various α- and β-carotenes. However, saffron's golden yellow-orange colour is primarily the result of α-crocin. This crocin is trans-crocetin di-(β-D-gentiobiosyl) ester; it bears the systematic (<b>IUPAC)</b> <b>name</b> 8,8-diapo-8,8-carotenoic acid. This means that the crocin underlying saffron's aroma is a digentiobiose ester of the carotenoid crocetin. Crocins themselves are a series of hydrophilic carotenoids that are either monoglycosyl or diglycosyl polyene esters of crocetin. Crocetin is a conjugated polyene dicarboxylic acid that is hydrophobic, and thus oil-soluble. When crocetin is esterified with two water-soluble gentiobioses, which are sugars, a product results that is itself water-soluble. The resultant α-crocin is a carotenoid pigment that may comprise more than 10% of dry saffron's mass. The two esterified gentiobioses make α-crocin ideal for colouring water-based and non-fatty foods such as rice dishes.|$|E
500|$|Columbium (symbol [...] "Cb") was {{the name}} {{originally}} bestowed by Hatchett upon his discovery of the metal in 1801. The name reflected that the type specimen of the ore came from America (Columbia). This name remained in use in American journals—the last paper published by American Chemical Society with columbium in its title dates from 1953—while niobium was used in Europe. To end this confusion, the name niobium was chosen for element 41 at the 15th Conference of the Union of Chemistry in Amsterdam in 1949. A year later this name was officially adopted by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) after 100 years of controversy, despite the chronological precedence of the name columbium. The latter name is still sometimes used in US industry. This was a compromise of sorts; the IUPAC accepted tungsten instead of wolfram in deference to North American usage; and niobium instead of columbium in deference to European usage. Not everyone agreed, and while many leading chemical societies and government organizations use the official <b>IUPAC</b> <b>name,</b> many leading metallurgists, metal societies, and the United States Geological Survey still use the original American name, [...] "columbium".|$|E
