500|$|On the Barrier {{stage of}} the homeward march, Scott reached the 82.30°S meeting point for the dog teams, three days ahead of schedule, noting in his diary for 27 February 1912 [...] "We are {{naturally}} always discussing possibility of meeting dogs, where and when, etc. It is a critical position. We may find ourselves in safety at the next depot, {{but there is a}} horrid element of doubt." [...] The party then met with three, ultimately critical, difficulties: the non-appearance of the dog teams, a large unexpected drop in temperature, [...] and a shortage of fuel in the depots. The low temperatures caused poor surfaces which Scott likened to [...] "pulling over desert sand"; he described the surface as [...] "coated with a thin layer of woolly crystals, formed by radiation no doubt. These are too <b>firmly</b> <b>fixed</b> to be removed by the wind and cause impossible friction on the [...] runners." [...] The low temperatures were accompanied by an absence of wind, something Scott had expected to assist them on their northern journey.|$|E

500|$|When Howard J. Savage of the Carnegie Foundation issued [...] "Bulletin 33" [...] in January 1930 criticizing {{recruitment}} and subsidization of athletes, Aigler challenged {{the fairness of}} the report. Aigler charged that Savage had [...] "no intention of being fair and accurate" [...] and accused Savage of questionable tactics in sending Michigan's president a report of conditions different from the report in the bulletin. Aigler also accused Savage of removing letters from the files of the athletic department to which he was allowed full access. He also argued that the report reflected eastern bias: [...] "In a number of places in the Bulletin the so-called Western Conference (now the Big Nine) is referred to and, curiously, almost always with a sort of half veiled sneer. The truth apparently is that the Bulletin was written {{from the point of view}} of the Eastern athletic man who has it pretty <b>firmly</b> <b>fixed</b> in mind that, athletically, things are pretty raw in the territory generally West of the Alleghenies." [...] Aigler later issued a 31-page report on athletic conditions at Michigan, charging the Carnegie Foundation with [...] "muck-raking." ...|$|E

2500|$|In colonial times, {{the concept}} of {{consideration}} was exported to many common law countries, but it is unknown in Scotland and in civil law jurisdictions. [...] Roman law-based systems neither require nor recognise consideration, and some commentators have suggested that consideration be abandoned, and estoppel be used to replace it {{as a basis for}} contracts. However, legislation, rather than judicial development, has been touted as the only way to remove this entrenched common law doctrine. Lord Justice Denning famously stated that [...] "The doctrine of consideration is too <b>firmly</b> <b>fixed</b> to be overthrown by a side-wind."

[...] Although some simpler and relatively early penannular brooches are found in Anglo-Saxon contexts, and some sub-types predominantly so, as far as is known the Anglo-Saxons did not use these brooch styles for prestige elite jewellery. [...] However, there are elements in the style of Irish and Scottish brooches deriving from Anglo-Saxon art, and related to Insular work in other media, especially illuminated manuscripts.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} {{was built}} around four ash longerons, equally spaced {{at the front}} but tapering to a vertical edge at the tail. [...] Underneath the fuselage was a deep central keel, so the lower fuselage cross-section was triangular; on top there was a rounded decking. [...] The tailplane was of steeply swept delta plan {{like that of the}} Type D, but carried twin elevators of roughly half-heart shape. [...] In contrast to the Type D, the rudder post was <b>firmly</b> <b>fixed</b> to the fuselage and did not move with the elevators; the rudder was similar in shape to the elevators, moving between them and behind a long rectangular fin. [...] The pilot's open cockpit was a little behind {{the leading edge of the}} wing, just aft of the spar and bigger than the passenger's, placed behind the rear spar near the trailing edge. [...] The pilot warped the wings by turning a wheel mounted on a lever which could also be moved fore and aft, operating the elevators. [...] There was a [...] "foot tiller" [...] for rudder control.|$|E
30|$|As {{a factor}} of {{high-quality}} chest compression, 2010 American Heart Association (AHA) Guideline [5] recommends providing chest compressions of adequate rate and adequate depth, allowing complete chest recoil after each compression, and minimizing interruptions in compressions. Most of CPR are performed with the patient in the spine position, but in some surgical situation, making patient in the supine position is challenging. For example, most of thoracic surgeries are performed in the lateral position and immediate transposition from lateral to supine is difficult because of <b>firmly</b> <b>fixing</b> body-supporting devices, a lot of inserted catheters, and inability of gathering sufficient staff to make transposition. In addition, repositioning the patient may {{make it impossible for}} surgeon to access to the surgical site and address the cause of cardiovascular collapse. So in the case of intraoperative cardiac arrest in the special position, immediate initiation of CPR without repositioning is sometimes required to prevent the delay of resuscitation and minimize interruptions of compression.|$|R
5000|$|In A Grammar of Motives, Burke {{provides}} {{a system of}} analysis for the Scene-Act ratio and the Scene-Agent ratio, though his analysis of ratios {{in the analysis of}} rhetoric is not limited to these. He states that, “The principles of dramatic consistency would lead one to expect such cases of overlap among the terms; but while being aware of them we should <b>firmly</b> <b>fix</b> in our minds such cases as afford a clear differentiation. Our terms leaning themselves towards merger and division, we are here trying to divide two of them while recognizing their possibilities of merger.” [...] Thus any two dramatistic elements can be analyzed in relation to each other, creating a ratio, and can produce individual, yet separate meanings which are equally valid. However, the rhetor’s selection of elements to compose a ratio should be scrutinized, as it can deflect attention away from or direct attention towards aspects of the rhetor’s desire.|$|R

30|$|A fiber Bragg grating (FBG) {{pressure}} sensor with high sensitivity and resolution {{has been designed}} and demonstrated. The sensor is configured by <b>firmly</b> <b>fixing</b> the FBG with a metal bellows structure. The sensor works by means of measuring the Bragg wavelength shift of the FBG with respect to pressure change. From the experimental results, the pressure sensitivity of the sensor {{is found to be}} 90.6 pm/psi, which is approximately 4000 times as that of a bare fiber Bragg grating. A very good linearity of 99.86 % is observed between the Bragg wavelength of the FBG and applied pressure. The designed sensor shows good repeatability with a negligible hysteresis error of ± 0.29 psi. A low-cost interrogation system that includes a long period grating (LPG) and a photodiode (PD) accompanied with simple electronic circuitry is demonstrated for the FBG sensor, which enables the sensor to attain high resolution of up to 0.025 psi. Thermal-strain cross sensitivity of the FBG {{pressure sensor}} is compensated using a reference FBG temperature sensor. The designed sensor can be used for liquid level, specific gravity, and static/dynamic low pressure measurement applications.|$|R
40|$|Four-corner fusion (4 CF) is an {{accepted}} and regularly performed procedure when managing posttraumatic degenerative disorders in the wrist. This procedure consists of excision {{of the entire}} scaphoid in association with midcarpal fusion of the remaining four ulnar carpal bones (hamate, capitate, lunate, and triquetrum). In the majority of cases, the long-term outcome is a functional painless wrist. However, the exact procedure to best achieve a rapid solid bone union of the fusion mass without hardware complications remains controversial. The authors have developed a precise system to ensure precise positioning, firm fixation, and fusion at the midcarpal joint together with an early postoperative recovery, avoiding {{some of the issues}} reported with other implants used for 4 CF. The described implant is a circular plate accommodating variable angle locking screws as well as compression screws that can <b>firmly</b> <b>fix</b> the plate to the carpal bones. The locking technology produces a very solid construct. A special reaming-distraction-compression guide has also been developed to both countersink the plate on the underlying carpal bone mass and allow distraction of the midcarpal joint for debridement and cancellous bone graft interposition. The features of the implant, its surgical technique, and a relevant case are described...|$|R
