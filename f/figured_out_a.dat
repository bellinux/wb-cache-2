The community soon got together, chalked out plans, <b>figured</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> route and realised they would need a framework to support such {{a large group of}} people, got sponsors on board to mitigate costs as well as popularise the Tour and the Cause of popularising Cycling as a viable and sustainable means of travel. Ever since its first edition, the TfN has stayed true to the Community of Cyclists in India by being a Tour for the Community, Of the Community and By the Community. It has grown in size, stature and visibility. From 40 riders in the first edition, its grown to 100 cyclists in 2013.|$|E

500|$|Hed PE {{released}} {{their third}} studio album, Blackout, on March 18, 2003. It peaked at No.33 on the Billboard 200, while its title track peaked at No.21 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and at No.32 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. Allmusic's Johnny Loftus wrote that [...] "While it expands on melodic elements {{that had previously}} played a supporting role in the band's sound, Blackout also delivers truckloads of crushing guitar and pounding rhythm. And {{whether or not it}} is the presence of a top-line producer, (hed) pe have <b>figured</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> way to imbue their aggressive mix of heavy rock and hip-hop with some serious hooks."

500|$|While {{earlier work}} was deemed [...] "vaguely funky white-soul" [...] and [...] "rock", recent ones have been judged {{to have a}} more reggae, anthemic pop sound, evoking {{comparisons}} to Coldplay. Levine refuses to fit his music into a genre, saying: [...] "There's so much variety in music, it's silly to belong to a specific club and try to sound a certain way". He considers himself an orthodox lyricist sticking to conventional themes, acknowledging: [...] "Romance, love, the lack thereof are still very big themes. I haven't <b>figured</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> way to use everything yet. As a songwriter, I'm still limited to that one thing." [...] He also claims he does not like mincing words, stating in a Rolling Stone interview: [...] "I was so sick of typical lyrics like 'Ooh, baby' and 'I love you' and all this vague shit. I thought the more explicit I got without being totally explicit was a nice approach".|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of X has been well-received by critics. Entertainment Weekly included the {{character in the}} list of the top 20 Black Sci-Fi Icons in 2009, at number 17. Todd vanDerWerff, writing for The A.V. Club, has praised the [...] "gravitas" [...] of Williams' acting, adding that he wished that the writers [...] "had <b>figured</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> way to have him around more often than they did". VanDerWerff's fellow writer Zack Handlen felt that the character's assassination in [...] "Herrenvolk" [...] was [...] "appropriately shocking", calling the scene [...] "one of the most memorable death's [...] in the series"; although he felt that the immediate introduction of the character's successor, Marita Covarrubias, [...] "deflates the importance of X's loss" [...] in the episode. Handlen has also called X [...] "the best of Mulder's informants", explaining that this is [...] "because he's always pissed off, he's always reluctant to provide information, and you can't ever be sure what play he's really running". Series writer Frank Spotnitz has called X [...] "the meanest, nastiest, most lethal killer on the planet".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Entertainment Weekly gave [...] "Syzygy" [...] an A, describing the episode as [...] "another uproarious send-up, {{this time of}} teen venom, B-movie paranoia, and our agents' painfully restrained rapport", with praise to the villains and the discussion on why Mulder always drives, considered [...] "one of Mulder's and Scully's funniest exchanges". Todd VanDerWerff [...] of The A.V. Club gave a B-, describing it as [...] "an entertaining hour that never rises {{to the level of}} those other episodes" [...] like [...] "Humbug" [...] and [...] "War of the Coprophages". VanDerWerff argued that [...] "Syzygy" [...] was an attempt by Carter to try and emulate the writing style of Darin Morgan's scripts, without success; he noted [...] "the laughs here are emptier than they were the week before in 'Coprophages'"—and adding that [...] "every time you think the episode has <b>figured</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> way to plant its foot firmly in comedic territory, there's a horribly judged moment of 'drama,' like Mulder's final monologue." [...] Connie Ogle of Popmatters listed Margi and Terri among the best monster-of-the-week characters of the series, describing [...] "Syzygy" [...] as a [...] "hilarious send-up of Heathers".|$|E

500|$|The only {{uranium metal}} {{available}} commercially {{was produced by}} the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company, using a photochemical process. Uranium oxide was reacted with potassium fluoride in large vats {{on the roof of}} Westinghouse's plant in Bloomfield, New Jersey. This produced ingots the size of a quarter that were sold for around $20 per gram. But Edward Creutz, the head of the Metallurgical Laboratory's group responsible for fabricating the uranium, wanted a metal sphere the size of an orange for his experiments. With Westinghouse's process, it would have cost $200,000 and taken a year to produce. The hydride or [...] "hydramet" [...] process, developed by Alexander used calcium hydride as the reducing agent for the conversion of uranium ore to metal. [...] By this means the Metal Hydrides plant in Beverly, Massachusetts, managed to produce a few pounds of uranium metal. Unfortunately, the calcium hydride contained unacceptable amounts of boron, a neutron poison, making the metal unsuitable for use in a reactor. Some months would pass before Clement J. Rodden from the National Bureau of Standards and Union Carbide <b>figured</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> means to produce sufficiently pure calcium hydride.|$|E
500|$|With digital effects work {{running behind}} schedule, Zemeckis {{convinced}} Wes Takahashi, an animation supervisor from visual effects company Industrial Light & Magic, to help work on The Frighteners. [...] "The shots Zemeckis showed me were pretty remarkable," [...] Takahashi reflected, [...] "but {{there were still}} about 400 shots to do, and everyone was kind of worried." [...] Takahashi was quickly drafted as a visual effects supervisor, and began looking at the schedule, {{trying to work out}} whether The Frighteners could be finished in time. [...] "There was no way we'd make the deadline. I <b>figured</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> concerted plan involving Jackson and Zemeckis to convince Universal it was worthy of asking for more money." [...] The executives at Universal proposed splitting some of the shots to visual effects companies in the United States, but Jackson, for whom the film was a chance to show New Zealand filmmaking could stand alongside Hollywood, convinced Universal otherwise. Instead, The Frighteners received an accelerated release date, four months earlier than planned, and an additional $6 million in financing, with fifteen digital animators and computer workstations (some were borrowed from Universal and other effects companies in the US). Andrew Adamson was hired as a digital effects supervisor.|$|E
2500|$|David Kalat (author of A Critical History and Filmography of Toho's Godzilla Series) stated, [...] "I {{was really}} {{surprised}} how much I liked this", though {{he felt that}} [...] "Godzilla himself gets almost no screen time", he did feel that Edwards <b>figured</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> successful [...] "modern American context" [...] for the film in supporting American troops, stating, [...] "Edwards' Godzilla (2014) takes that concept and weaponizes it: we're used to seeing Godzilla movies where the military fails because they're stupid, but seeing them fail but be heroic while failing is new. It's also something the culture needs—and it's the kind of heretical idea that's otherwise hard to dramatize in pop culture, just like the original Godzilla's anti-American stance was so potent in 1954." ...|$|E

2500|$|Within days of Giancana's murder, Willow Springs {{police chief}} and Outfit {{associate}} Michael J. Corbitt discussed the murder with capo Salvatore Bastone. Bastone told him, [...] "You know, Sam sure loved that little guy in Oak Park... Tony Spilotro. Yeah, he was fuckin' crazy about him. Sam put Tony on the fuckin' map, {{thought he was}} gonna be a big fuckin' man someday. Did you know that after Marshall Caifano got out of Vegas, it was Sam who wanted Tony Spilotro out there?

6000|$|The Democratic Committee <b>figured</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> {{way to do}} this. Monroe County, {{where both}} Forbes and Hopkins resided, {{was one of the}} Democratic strongholds of the State. The {{portions}} of Washington and Jefferson Counties included in the Eighth District were as strongly Republican, and being more populous gave to the district its natural Republican majority. On the same ticket that was to elect a Representative to the State Legislature was the candidate for Sheriff of Monroe County. A man named Cummings was the Republican and Seth Reynolds, the liveryman, the Democratic nominee. Under ordinary conditions Reynolds was sure to be elected, but the Committee proposed to sacrifice him in order to elect Hopkins. The Democrats would bargain with the Republicans to vote for the Republican Sheriff if the Republicans would vote for the Democratic Representative. This [...] "trading votes," [...] which was often done, was considered by the politicians quite legitimate. The only thing necessary was to [...] "fix" [...] Seth Reynolds, and this Hopkins arranged personally. The office of Sheriff would pay about two thousand a year, and this sum Hopkins agreed to pay the liveryman and so relieve him of all the annoyance of earning it.|$|E

And inside of thirty days you find us swarming into Kansas with a pair of fluent horses and a red camping wagon on the European plan. John Tom is Chief Wish-Heap-Dough, the famous Indian medicine man and Samaritan Sachem of the Seven Tribes. Mr. Peters is business manager and half owner. We needed a third man, so we looked around and found J. Conyngham Binkly leaning against the want column of a newspaper. This Binkly has a disease for Shakespearian rôles, and an hallucination about a 200 nights' run on the New York stage. But he confesses that he never could earn the butter to spread on his William S. rôles, so he is willing to drop to the ordinary baker's kind, and be satisfied with a 200-mile run behind the medicine ponies. Besides Richard III, he could do twenty-seven coon songs and banjo specialties, and was willing to cook, and curry the horses. We carried a fine line of excuses for taking money. One was a magic soap for removing grease spots and quarters from clothes. One was a Sum-wah-tah, the great Indian Remedy made from a prairie herb revealed by the Great Spirit in a dream to his favorite medicine men, the great chiefs McGarrity and Siberstein, bottlers, Chicago. And the other was a frivolous system of pick-pocketing the Kansasters that had the department stores reduced to a decimal fraction. Look ye! A pair of silk garters, a dream book, one dozen clothespins, a gold tooth, and 'When Knighthood Was in Flower' all wrapped up in a genuine Japanese silkarina handkerchief and handed to the handsome lady by Mr. Peters for the trivial sum of fifty cents, while Professor Binkly entertains us in a three-minute round with the banjo.|$|E
