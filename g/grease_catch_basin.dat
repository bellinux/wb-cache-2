The parameters of interest were determining 1) abundance of the mosquito species {{associated with the}} <b>catch</b> <b>basins</b> and 2) feeding patterns of local mosquito species. Three species of mosquitoes were collected from Corvallis catch basins: Culex pipiens L., Culex stigmatosoma Dyar, and Culiseta incidens (Thomson). Over 32 weeks of sampling 60 <b>catch</b> <b>basins</b> in Corvallis in 2004, a total of 1, 920 <b>catch</b> <b>basin</b> visits were made and 79, 760 immature mosquitoes were collected. Emerging mosquitoes were collected from 20 <b>catch</b> <b>basins</b> in southern Corvallis for 22 days in August 2006 and from 20 <b>catch</b> <b>basins</b> in northern Corvallis for 20 days in September 2006. Based on the numbers of mosquitoes collected from the 20 <b>catch</b> <b>basins</b> sampled, an estimated 138, 484 female Cx. pipiens emerged from the all of the <b>catch</b> <b>basins</b> in the southern area and 84, 432 emerged from the northern <b>catch</b> <b>basins.</b> Molecular analysis of the bloodmeals from Cx. pipiens, Cx. stigmatosoma, and Cs. incidens collected in Corvallis parks and greenspaces found that the two Culex spp. fed primarily on avian hosts and Cs. incidens fed primarily on mammalian hosts. Based on the abundance and host feeding pattern data collected, all three mosquitoes could be involved in epizootic and epidemic transmission of mosquito-borne encephalitis, including West Nile virus, in Corvallis, if the virus were present...|$|R

In urban areas with high building density, traditional drainage concepts like wetlands {{are not available}} {{and the concept of}} decentralized treatment facilities that can be housed in <b>catch</b> <b>basin</b> structures are a viable option for treatment of pollutants. A European and US study is underway to determine the parameters of sustainable on-site retention and infiltration. The European study progressed in three stages.

40|$|<b>Catch</b> <b>basins</b> {{can capture}} sediments and sediment-bound {{pollutants}} in stormwater, providing some pollutant removal and {{acting as a}} pretreatment for other stormwater best management practices (BMPs) (USEPA 2006). A factor that {{is critical to the}} effectiveness of a <b>catch</b> <b>basin</b> at removing sediments is regular maintenance to remove accumulated sediments and other debris from its sump (USEPA 2006).

40|$|A {{mixture of}} {{sediment}} and water is formed during the cleansing of <b>catch</b> <b>basins.</b> This paper discusses the concentration levels {{and distribution of}} numerous metals and organic carbon (OC) in the water phase of this mixture. The results show that due to the high concentrations of metals in the water phase, the <b>catch</b> <b>basin</b> mixture should be treated before it reaches a recipient. Three sites with different types of area and traffi c intensity were sampled. Four fractions were analyzed: unfi ltered, dissolved (< 0. 2 μm), colloidal (0. 22 μm to 1 kD [kilodalton]), and truly dissolved (< 1 kD). The results of the unfi ltered fraction show high concentrations of metals and OC in the <b>catch</b> <b>basin</b> mixture. A comparison of Canadian and Swedish Environmental Protection Agency guidelines and the <b>catch</b> <b>basin</b> mixtures shows that concentrations exceeded the threshold values for As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn. Compared with samples from a reference lake in the area, the unfi ltered fraction showed high concentrations of all elements. OC {{seems to have a}} large impact on the overall speciation of trace metals in the <b>catch</b> <b>basin</b> mixture. To trace the sources of the particulate fraction in the unfi ltered samples, Al-normalization was used. Al-normalization indicated that Ca, K, Mg, Na, Mn, Ba, Co, and Cr concentrations could be explained by mineral particles used as traction control.

40|$|The {{mosquito}} larvicide methoprene is {{a juvenile}} growth hormone mimic that {{is widely used}} to control mosquitoes. This chemical disrupts normal mosquito development, drastically inhibiting emergence from the pupal to the adult stage. Methoprene is active at extremely low levels and is widely used; so it could affect arthropods, other than mosquitoes, that have similar endocrine systems. This study evaluates the efficacy at controlling mosquitoes in storm water drainage <b>catch</b> <b>basins</b> and potential nontarget effects of methoprene. Secondly, whether methoprene attracts or deters mosquitoes likely to oviposit in <b>catch</b> <b>basins</b> was examined. Thirdly, the <b>catch</b> <b>basin</b> community was described and environmental factors were used to model mosquito larval abundance; and lastly methoprene 2 ̆ 7 s effects on the communities that live in <b>catch</b> <b>basins</b> were measured. ^ Methoprene formulated as 30 -day slow release Altosid® pellets effectively controlled mosquitoes {{for about a month}} under field conditions and substantially longer under laboratory conditions when applied at a dose of 3. 5 g pellets per average-sized <b>catch</b> <b>basin.</b> Methoprene formulated as liquid larvicide did not affect oviposition of either Culex spp. or Ochlerotatus japonicus. ^ <b>Catch</b> <b>basin</b> environment organisms are, for the most part, detritivores that can withstand low levels of oxygen and periods of drought.

50|$|Process: The {{evaporation}} surface (1) suctions {{water out}} of the capillary basin (6), puts the capillary pump (8) for the flooding process in action and quickly fills the surface from top to bottom. Then it drips into the <b>catch</b> <b>basin</b> (2). The water evaporates and sets the air circulation into motion. The drained water closes the hose (3) below. Here, air which flows via pipe into the water tank (5) is interrupted. The water in the tank can no longer flow out because under-pressure occurs. The residual water in the capillary basin (6), on the upper part, is evaporated by the evaporation surface (1). The residual water in the <b>catch</b> <b>basin</b> (2), on the bottom, is suctioned out by the lime separator (7) and evaporated. As soon as the <b>catch</b> <b>basin</b> is empty, air then flows again through the hose (3); water from the tank flows back to the capillary basins (6) and thereby begins the process again.

40|$|Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (Bti) and Lysinibacillus sphaericus (Lsph) are {{extensively}} used in {{mosquito control}} programs. These biocides are the active ingredients {{of a commercial}} larvicide. Quantitative data {{on the fate of}} both Bti and Lsph applied together for the control of mosquitoes in urban drainage structures such as <b>catch</b> <b>basins</b> are lacking. We evaluated the dynamics and persistence of Bti and Lsph spores released through their concomitant application in urban <b>catch</b> <b>basins</b> in southern Switzerland. Detection and quantification of spores over time in water and sludge samples from <b>catch</b> <b>basins</b> were carried out using quantitative real-time PCR targeting both cry 4 A and cry 4 B toxin genes for Bti and the binA gene for Lsph. After treatment, Bti and Lsph spores attained concentrations of 3. 76 (± 0. 08) and 4. 13 (± 0. 09) log ml(- 1) in water, then decreased progressively over time, reaching baseline values. For both Bti and Lsph, spore levels in the order of 10 (5) g(- 1) were observed in the bottom sludge two days after the treatment and remained constant for the whole test period (275 days). Indigenous Lsph strains were isolated from previously untreated <b>catch</b> <b>basins.</b> A selection of those was genotyped using pulsed field gel electrophoresis of SmaI-digested chromosomal DNA, revealing that a subset of isolates were members of the clonal population of strain 2362. No safety issues related to the use of this biopesticide in the environment have been observed during this study, because no significant {{increase in the number of}} spores was seen during the long observation period. The isolation of native Lysinibacillus sphaericus strains belonging to the same clonal population as strain 2362 from <b>catch</b> <b>basins</b> never treated with Lsph-based products indicates that the use of a combination of Bti and Lsph for the control of mosquitoes does not introduce non-indigenous microorganisms in this area...|$|R

40|$|Background: Urban {{mosquitoes}} in temperate regions {{may represent}} a high nuisance and {{are associated with the}} risk of arbovirus transmission. Common practices to reduce this burden, at least in Italian highly infested urban areas, imply calendar-based larvicide treatments of street <b>catch</b> <b>basins</b> – which represent the main non-removable urban breeding site and/or insecticide ground spraying. The planning of these interventions, as well as the evaluation of their effectiveness, rarely benefit of adequate monitoring of the mosquito abundance and dynamics. We propose the use of adhesive traps to monitor Aedes albopictus and Culex pipiens adults and to evaluate the efficacy of insecticide-based control strategies. Methods: We designed two novel types of adhesive traps to collect adult mosquitoes visiting and/or emerging from <b>catch</b> <b>basins.</b> The Mosquito Emerging Trap (MET) was exploited to assess the efficacy of larvicide treatments. The <b>Catch</b> <b>Basin</b> Trap (CBT) was exploited together with the Sticky Trap (ST, commonly used to collect ovipositing/resting females) to monitor adults abundance in the campus of the University of Rome “Sapienza” - where <b>catch</b> <b>basins</b> were treated with Insect Growth Regulators (IGR) bi-monthly and Low-Volume insecticide spraying were carried out before sunset - and in a nearby control area. Results: Results obtained by MET showed that, although all monitored diflubenzuron-treated <b>catch</b> <b>basins</b> were repeatedly visited by Ae. albopictus and Cx. pipiens, adult emergence was inhibited in most basins. Results obtained by ST and CBT showed a significant lower adult abundance in the treated area than in the untreated one after the second adulticide spraying, which was carried out during the major phase of Ae. albopictus population expansion in Rome. Spatial heterogeneities in the effect of the treatments were also revealed. Conclusions: The results support the potential of the three adhesive traps tested in passively monitoring urban mosquito adult abundance and seasonal dynamics and in assessing the efficacy of control measures. ST showed higher specificity for Ae. albopictus and CBT for Cx. pipiens. The results also provide a preliminary indication on the effectiveness of common mosquito control strategies carried out against urban mosquito in European urban areas...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background An {{important}} {{determinant of}} mosquito-borne pathogen transmission is the {{spatial distribution of}} vectors. The primary vectors of West Nile virus (WNV) in Illinois are Culex pipiens Linnaeus (Diptera: Culicidae) and Culex restuans Theobald. In urban environments, these mosquitoes commonly oviposit in roadside storm water <b>catch</b> <b>basins.</b> However, use of this habitat is inconsistent, with abundance of larvae varying significantly across <b>catch</b> <b>basins</b> at a fine spatial scale. Methods We tested the hypothesis that attributes of the biotic and abiotic environment contribute to spatial and temporal variation in production of mosquito vectors, characterizing the relationship between terrestrial vegetation and aquatic chemistry and Culex abundance in Chicago, Illinois. Larvae were sampled from 60 <b>catch</b> <b>basins</b> from June 14 to October 3, 2009. Density of shrubs and 14 tree genera surrounding the basins were quantified, as well as aquatic chemistry content of each basin. Results We demonstrate that the spatial pattern of Culex abundance in <b>catch</b> <b>basins</b> is strongly influenced by environmental characteristics, resulting in significant variation across the urban landscape. Using regression and machine learning techniques, we described landscape features and microhabitat characteristics of four Chicago neighborhoods and examined {{the implications of these}} measures for larval abundance in adjacent <b>catch</b> <b>basins.</b> The important positive predictors of high larval abundance were aquatic ammonia, nitrates, and area of shrubs of height Culex during the fruit-bearing periods and early senescent periods in August and September. Conclusions This study identifies environmental predictors of mosquito production in urban environments. Because an abundance of adult Culex is integral to efficient WNV transmission and mosquitoes are found in especially high densities near larval habitats, identifying aquatic sites for Culex and landscape features that promote larval production are important in predicting the spatial pattern of cases of human and veterinary illness. Thus, these data enable accurate assessment of regions at risk for exposure to WNV and aid in the prevention of vector-borne disease transmission. </p...|$|R
