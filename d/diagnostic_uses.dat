50|$|High density SNP arrays help {{scientists}} identify {{patterns of}} allelic imbalance. These studies have potential prognostic and <b>diagnostic</b> <b>uses.</b> Because LOH is so common in many human cancers, SNP arrays have great potential in cancer diagnostics. For example, recent SNP array {{studies have shown}} that solid tumors such as gastric cancer and liver cancer show LOH, as do non-solid malignancies such as hematologic malignancies, ALL, MDS, CML and others. These studies may provide insights into how these diseases develop, as well as information about how to create therapies for them.|$|E

50|$|The {{implementation}} of array CGH, whereby DNA microarrays are {{used instead of}} the traditional metaphase chromosome preparation, was pioneered by Solinas-Tolodo et al. in 1997 using tumor cells and Pinkel et al. in 1998 by use of breast cancer cells. This {{was made possible by}} the Human Genome Project which generated a library of cloned DNA fragments with known locations throughout the human genome, with these fragments being used as probes on the DNA microarray. Now probes of various origins such as cDNA, genomic PCR products and bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) can be used on DNA microarrays which may contain up to 2 million probes. Array CGH is automated, allows greater resolution (down to 100 kb) than traditional CGH as the probes are far smaller than metaphase preparations, requires smaller amounts of DNA, can be targeted to specific chromosomal regions if required and is ordered and therefore faster to analyse, making it far more adaptable to <b>diagnostic</b> <b>uses.</b>|$|E
