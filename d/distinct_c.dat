It also differs epidemiologically, since it is found outside the San Joaquin Valley. Unlike C. immitis, which is geographically largely limited to California, C. posadasii can also be found in northern Mexico and South America.|$|E

5000|$|The {{classification}} of various species {{assigned to the}} genus Cimolopteryx {{has changed over the}} years, and many species once thought to belong to this genus have been reclassified or deemed indeterminate. As of a re-evaluation of the fossil remains in 2002 by Sylvia Hope, at most five species were recognized: Cimolopteryx rara, C. petra, C. maxima, C. minima, and one yet-unnamed species. C. rara and C. petra were considered almost identical, and found in the same environments (the Lance and Frenchman formations), but differed in size, with C. petra smaller than C. rara. In a 2009 review, Nicholas Longrich synonymized them as the same species, dismissing the size difference as possibly based on gender or growth stage. However, Longrich reversed his position following a 2011 analysis of Lancian birds, in which he and co-authors considered all four named species to be <b>distinct.</b> <b>C.</b> minima and C. petra were transferred to the new genus Lamarqueavis by Federico Agnolin in 2010, based on their similarity to the South American species L. australis. [...] An additional species from the much earlier Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta has also since been re-evaluated as a probable species of Lamarqueavis rather than Cimolopteryx.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Clostridium difficile {{infection}} (CDI) {{is still}} a major clinical challenge. Previous studies have demonstrated multiple <b>distinct</b> <b>C.</b> difficile strains in the faeces of patients with CDI; yet whether true mixed CDI occurs in vivo is unclear. In this study we evaluated whether two <b>distinct</b> <b>C.</b> difficile strains could co-germinate and co-proliferate in an in vitro human gut model. METHODS: An in vitro triple-stage chemostat was used to study the responses of two PCR ribotype 001 C. difficile strains following exposure to ceftriaxone at concentrations observed in vivo (7 days). C. difficile viable counts (vegetative and spore forms), cytotoxin titres and indigenous microflora viable counts were monitored throughout the experiment. RESULTS: Both C. difficile strains germinated and proliferated following exposure to ceftriaxone. Cytotoxin production was detected in the gut model following C. difficile spore germination and proliferation. Ceftriaxone elicited reduced viable counts of Bifidobacterium spp. and elevated viable counts of Enterococcus spp. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that multiple C. difficile strains are able to proliferate concurrently in an in vitro model reflective of the human colon. Previous studies in the gut model have reflected clinical observations so clinicians should be mindful {{of the possibility that}} multiple C. difficile strains may infect patients. These observations augment recent human epidemiological studies in this area...|$|E
40|$|Previous studies {{identified}} specific Chlamydia trachomatis strains circulating {{among men}} who have sex with men (MSM). This study investigates whether <b>distinct</b> <b>C.</b> trachomatis strains circulate among subpopulations within the MSM community. Participants were recruited at the sexually transmitted infection clinic of the Public Health Service of Amsterdam from 2008 to 2009. C. trachomatis samples were typed using multilocus sequence typing. Epidemiological and clinical data were derived from questionnaires and patient records. Typing of 277 samples from 260 MSM identified <b>distinct</b> <b>C.</b> trachomatis strains circulating concurrently over time. Men with lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) -inducing strains were more likely to be infected with human immunodeficiency virus, more often had a history of STI, and had a higher frequency of risky sexual behavior. No such associations were found for non-LGV-inducing strains. MSM infected with heterosexual-associated strains were often younger (P =. 04) and more often reported sex with women (P =. 03), compared with men infected with MSM-associated strains. With the exception of LGV-inducing strains, no evidence was found that different C. trachomatis strains circulated in distinct subpopulations of MSM. This indicates that no separate transmission networks for C. trachomatis among MSM existed. However, younger MSM and bisexuals were more often infected with heterosexual-associated C. trachomatis strain...|$|E
