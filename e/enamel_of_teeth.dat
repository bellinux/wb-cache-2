60|$|The {{substances}} {{which are}} digested by Drosera {{act on the}} leaves very differently. Some cause much more energetic and rapid inflection of the tentacles, and keep them inflected for a much longer time, than do others. We are thus {{led to believe that}} the former are more nutritious than the latter, as is known to be the case with some of these same substances when given to animals; for instance, meat in comparison with gelatine. As cartilage is so tough a substance and is so little acted on by water, its prompt dissolution by the secretion of Drosera, and subsequent absorption is, perhaps, {{one of the most striking}} cases. But it is not really more remarkable than the digestion of meat, which is dissolved by this secretion in the same manner and by the same stages as by gastric juice. The secretion dissolves bone, and even the <b>enamel</b> <b>of</b> <b>teeth,</b> but this is simply due to the large quantity of acid secreted, owing, apparently, to the desire of the plant for phosphorus. In the case of bone, the ferment does not come into play until all the phosphate of lime has been decomposed and free acid is present, and then the fibrous basis is quickly dissolved. Lastly, the secretion attacks and dissolves matter out of living seeds, which it sometimes kills, or injures, as shown by the diseased state [page 270] of the seedlings. It also absorbs matter from pollen, and from fragments of leaves.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of trace elements on {{the prevalence of}} caries is a complex subject. However, the demonstration of an inverse relationship between caries prevalence and fluoride (F) intake indicates the potential effect of trace elements on caries. Aims and Objectives: This in vitro study sought to estimate and compare the trace element concentrations in sound and carious <b>enamel</b> <b>of</b> primary and permanent teeth. Materials and Methods: Forty sound and carious primary and permanent teeth, extracted from children and adolescents of Davangere city, were collected. The teeth were divided into four groups (of ten each) and enamel samples were prepared by mechanical grinding. The trace elements were estimated using atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Results and Conclusions: The results of our study showed the presence of 18 trace elements (F, Sr, K, Al, Si, Ni, B, Fe, Cu, Mn, Co, Cr, Zn, Mg, Se, Pb, Mo, and V) in the <b>enamel</b> <b>of</b> sound and carious primary and permanent teeth. The mean, standard deviation, and range (at 95 &#x 0025; confidence level) were calculated for each element. The concentrations of F, Sr, and K were significantly (P &# 60; 0. 05) higher in sound <b>enamel</b> <b>of</b> permanent <b>teeth</b> than in sound <b>enamel</b> <b>of</b> primary <b>teeth.</b> The concentrations <b>of</b> F, Sr, K, Al, and Fe were significantly (P &# 60; 0. 05) higher in sound <b>enamel</b> <b>of</b> permanent <b>teeth</b> than in carious <b>enamel</b> <b>of</b> permanent <b>teeth.</b> The concentrations <b>of</b> F, K, and Si were significantly (P &# 60; 0. 05) higher in sound <b>enamel</b> <b>of</b> primary <b>teeth</b> than in carious <b>enamel</b> <b>of</b> primary <b>teeth...</b>|$|R

6000|$|The {{rocks of}} St. Paul appear from a {{distance}} of a brilliantly white colour. This is partly owing to the dung of a vast multitude of seafowl, and partly to a coating of a hard glossy substance with a pearly lustre, which is intimately united {{to the surface of the}} rocks. This, when examined with a lens, is found to consist of numerous exceedingly thin layers, its total thickness being about the tenth of an inch. It contains much animal matter, and its origin, no doubt, is due to the action of the rain or spray on the birds' dung. Below some small masses of guano at Ascension, and on the Abrolhos Islets, I found certain stalactitic branching bodies, formed apparently in the same manner as the thin white coating on these rocks. The branching bodies so closely resembled in general appearance certain nulliporae (a family of hard calcareous sea-plants), that in lately looking hastily over my collection I did not perceive the difference. The globular extremities of the branches are of a pearly texture, like the <b>enamel</b> <b>of</b> <b>teeth,</b> but so hard as just to scratch plate-glass. I may here mention, that on a part of the coast of Ascension, where there is a vast accumulation of shelly sand, an incrustation is deposited on the tidal rocks, by the water of the sea, resembling, as represented in Plate 4, certain cryptogamic plants (Marchantiae) often seen on damp walls. The surface of the fronds is beautifully glossy; and those parts formed where fully exposed to the light, are of a jet black colour, but those shaded under ledges are only grey. I have shown specimens of this incrustation to several geologists, and they all thought that they were of volcanic or igneous origin! In its hardness and translucency--in its polish, equal to that of the finest oliva-shell--in the bad smell given out, and loss of colour under the blowpipe--it shows a close similarity with living sea-shells. Moreover in sea-shells, it is known that the parts habitually covered and shaded by the mantle of the animal, are of a paler colour than those fully exposed to the light, just as is the case with this incrustation. When we remember that lime, either as a phosphate or carbonate, enters into the composition of the hard parts, such as bones and shells, of all living animals, it is an interesting physiological fact to find substances harder than the <b>enamel</b> <b>of</b> <b>teeth,</b> and coloured surfaces as well polished as those of a fresh shell, re-formed through inorganic means from dead organic matter--mocking, also, in shape, some of the lower vegetable productions. (1/6. Mr. Horner and Sir David Brewster have described ("Philosophical Transactions" [...] 1836 page 65) a singular [...] "artificial substance resembling shell." [...] It is deposited in fine, transparent, highly polished, brown-coloured laminae, possessing peculiar optical properties, on the inside of a vessel, in which cloth, first prepared with glue and then with lime, is made to revolve rapidly in water. It is much softer, more transparent, and contains more animal matter, than the natural incrustation at Ascension; but we here again see the strong tendency which carbonate of lime and animal matter evince to form a solid substance allied to shell.) ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{substance}} {{forming the}} fronds {{has a very}} compact and often almost crystalline fracture; the edges being translucent, and hard enough easily to scratch calcareous spar. Under the blowpipe it immediately becomes white, and emits a strong animal odour, like that from fresh shells. It is chiefly composed of carbonate of lime; when placed in muriatic acid it froths much, leaving a residue of sulphate of lime, and of an oxide of iron, together with a black powder, which is not soluble in heated acids. This latter substance seems to be carbonaceous, and is evidently the colouring matter. The sulphate of lime is extraneous, and occurs in distinct, excessively minute, lamellar plates, studded {{on the surface of}} the fronds, and embedded between the fine layers of which they are composed; when a fragment is heated in the blowpipe, these lamellae are immediately rendered visible. The original outline of the fronds may often be traced, either to a minute particle of shell fixed in a crevice of the rock, or to several cemented together; these first become deeply corroded, by the dissolving power of the waves, into sharp ridges, and then are coated with successive layers of the glossy, grey, calcareous incrustation. The inequalities of the primary support affect the outline of every successive layer, in the same manner as may often be seen in bezoar-stones, when an object like a nail forms the centre of aggregation. The crenulated edges, however, of the frond appear to be due to the corroding power of the surf on its own deposit, alternating with fresh depositions. On some smooth basaltic rocks on the coast of St. Jago, I found an exceedingly thin layer of brown calcareous matter, which under a lens presented a miniature likeness of the crenulated and polished fronds of Ascension; in this case a basis was not afforded by any projecting extraneous particles. Although the incrustation at Ascension is persistent throughout the year; yet from the abraded appearance of some parts, and from the fresh appearance of other parts, the whole seems to undergo a round of decay and renovation, due probably to changes in the form of the shifting beach, and consequently in the action of the breakers: hence probably it is, that the incrustation never acquires a great thickness. Considering the position of the encrusted rocks in the midst of the calcareous beach, together with its composition, I think there can be no doubt that its origin is due to the dissolution and subsequent deposition of the matter composing the rounded particles of shells and corals. (The selenite, as I have remarked is extraneous, and must have been derived from the sea-water. It is an interesting circumstance thus to find the waves of the ocean, sufficiently charged with sulphate of lime, to deposit it on the rocks, against which they dash every tide. Dr. Webster has described ("Voyage of the 'Chanticleer'" [...] volume 2 page 319) beds of gypsum and salt, as much as two feet in thickness, left by the evaporation of the spray on the rocks on the windward coast. Beautiful stalactites of selenite, resembling in form those of carbonate of lime, are formed near these beds. Amorphous masses of gypsum, also, occur in caverns in the interior of the island; and at Cross Hill (an old crater) I saw a considerable quantity of salt oozing from a pile of scoriae. In these latter cases, the salt and gypsum appear to be volcanic products.) From this source it derives its animal matter, which is evidently the colouring principle. The nature of the deposit, in its incipient stage, can often be well seen upon a fragment of white shell, when jammed between two of the fronds; it then appears exactly like the thinnest wash of a pale grey varnish. Its darkness varies a little, but the jet blackness of some of the fronds and of the botryoidal masses seems due to the translucency of the successive grey layers. There is, however, this singular circumstance, that when deposited on the under side of ledges of rock or in fissures, it appears always to be of a pale, pearly grey colour, even when of considerable thickness: hence one is led to suppose, that an abundance of light is necessary to the development of the dark colour, in the same manner as seems to be the case with the upper and exposed surfaces of the shells of living mollusca, which are always dark, compared with their under surfaces and with the parts habitually covered by the mantle of the animal. In this circumstance,--in the immediate loss of colour and in the odour emitted under the blowpipe,--in the degree of hardness and translucency of the edges,--and in the beautiful polish of the surface (From the fact described in my [...] "Journal of Researches" [...] of a coating of oxide of iron, deposited by a streamlet on the rocks in its bed (like a nearly similar coating at the great cataracts of the Orinoco and Nile), becoming finely polished where the surf acts, I presume that the surf in this instance, also, is the polishing agent.), rivalling when in a fresh state that of the finest Oliva, there is a striking analogy between this inorganic incrustation and the shells of living molluscous animals. (In the section descriptive of St. Paul's Rocks, I have described a glossy, pearly substance, which coats the rocks, and an allied stalactitical incrustation from Ascension, the crust of which resembles the <b>enamel</b> <b>of</b> <b>teeth,</b> but is hard enough to scratch plate-glass. Both these substances contain animal matter, and seem to have been derived from water in filtering through birds' dung.) This appears to me to be an interesting physiological fact. (Mr. Horner and Sir David Brewster have described [...] "Philosophical Transactions" [...] 1836 page 65 a singular [...] "artificial substance, resembling shell." [...] It is deposited in fine, transparent, highly polished, brown- coloured laminae, possessing peculiar optical properties, on the inside of a vessel, in which cloth, first prepared with glue and then with lime, is made to revolve rapidly in water.

All subjects were stored in artificial saliva (without fluoride) for a month and samples were obtained from each subject using Acid etch biopsy technique. The amount of fluoride and calcium in sample solutions were measured by potentiometer and atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The results were analyzed by t-test and ANOVA statistical tests. Results: This study indicated that the amount of fluoride uptake by <b>enamel</b> <b>of</b> deciduous <b>teeth</b> from Fuji II Glass-ionomer was (146. 85 ± 15. 68 ppm which was significantly is higher than fluoride uptake from riva self cure (40. 67 ± 5. 34 ppm) and SDS (83. 68 ± 6. 40 ppm) (P< 0. 001). Conclusion: Fluoride uptake by <b>enamel</b> <b>of</b> deciduous <b>teeth</b> was higher from Fuji II Glass-ionomer (GC Japan) in comparison with Riva self-cure(SDI Australia) and SDS(Iran).

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{in vitro}} study was to {{evaluate}} by scanning electron microscopy the morphological aspects <b>of</b> the <b>enamel</b> <b>of</b> primary <b>teeth</b> after etching with 36 % phosphoric acid or a non-rinse conditioner. Ten naturally exfoliated anterior primary teeth were selected. The samples were subjected to prophylaxis with pumice paste and water using a low-speed hand piece. Etching was done on the buccal surface. Specimens were divided into 2 groups: G 1 (n= 10) : etching with 36 % phosphoric acid gel - Conditioner 36 (Dentsply) for 20 s, followed by water rinse for 15 s; G 2 (n= 10) : etching with NRC - Non Rinse Conditioner (Dentsply) for 20 s, followed by air drying for 15 s. The samples were dehydrated, mounted on metal stubs, coated with gold and observed with Jeol JSM- 6100 scanning electron microscope. Electron-micrographic analysis showed that both etching agents were effective for etching the <b>enamel</b> <b>of</b> primary <b>teeth</b> causing the formation of microporosities on the enamel surface, although the etching pattern was more effective {{with the use of}} 36 % phosphoric acid gel...|$|R
