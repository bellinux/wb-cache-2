This description is written as a user manual to aid application, not as a design description. SPi is a generic custom ASIC, manufactured in 0. 25 {mu}m CMOS by TSMC, to interface between a constant current source and silicon detector read-out chips. There is no SEU (single event upset) protection, but most (not all) components are radiation tolerant design. An operating voltage of 1. 2 to 2. 5 volts and other design features make the IC suitable {{for a variety of}} serial powering architectures and ROICs. It {{should be noted that the}} device is likely to be a prototype for demonstration rather than a product for inclusion in a detector. The next design(s), SPin, are likely to be designed for a specific application (eg SLHC). The component includes: (1) Seven bi-directional LVDS-like buffers for high data rate links to/from the read-out chips. These are AC coupled (series capacitor) off-chip for DC level conversion; (2) A programmable internal programmable shunt regulator to provide a defined voltage to readout chips when linked in a serial powering chain; (3) A programmable <b>internal</b> <b>shunt</b> regulator control circuit for external transistor control; (4) Shunt current measurement (for <b>internal</b> <b>shunt</b> regulator); (5) A programmable <b>internal</b> <b>shunt</b> regulator current alarm; and (6) Two programmable linear regulators...|$|E

40|$|Background. Endarterectomy of the {{internal}} carotid artery, supported by medicamental treatment, is the best method used to prevent stroke with symptomatic patients with an over 70 -percent narrowing of the ipsilateral carotid artery. With patients who have successfully passed the operation the occurrence of the stroke is less often than with non-operated patients (1 % vs. 6 – 10 % per year). Therefore, {{it is important that}} the operation is carried out as safely as possible. Currently, the average acceptable rate of death and/ or severe stroke risk stands at between 2 – 4 %. Greatest problems faced during carotid artery surgery are embolism of the affected artery during preparation, brain ischaemia during the blockade of the carotid artery, and embolism and intimal tearing due to injury of {{the internal}} carotid artery by the temporary <b>internal</b> <b>shunt.</b> Due to the risk of causing an embolism and intimal tearing, the use of the <b>internal</b> <b>shunt</b> can be dangerous. Therefore, selective usage of the shunt is recommended when necessary due to brain ischaemia. Methods. Under block/conduction anaesthesia (deep and superficial cervical block) we have performed surgery on 23 patients (16 males, 7 females) because of severe stenosis {{of the internal}} carotid artery (over 70 %). A mixture of Xylocain 1 % and Marcain 1. 5 % was used for the cervical block. Cerebral blood circulation was monitored by neurological testing of the patient awake during the procedure. During the procedure, we performed standard monitoring of the vital functions including the blood pressure. Additionally, the transcranial Doppler monitoring of the blood flow through the middle cerebral artery was used with 20 of the patients. Results. Even after placing the artery clamp and cutting off the blood flow through the internal carotid artery no neurological deficits were observed with 18 patients, neither did we use temporary <b>internal</b> <b>shunt</b> with them. Five patients suffered problems with loss of consciousness, therefore we used the <b>internal</b> <b>shunt.</b> With all but one patient we performed a typical longitudinal endarterectomy and used the Dacron patch to close the carotid artery. Those patients underwent operation and post-operation treatment without complications and were dismissed from hospital five to seven days after the operation. Meanwhile, one patient’s condition worsened severely during preparation of the carotid artery even before the placement of the artery clamp, which resulted in paralysis on the contralateral side and loss of consciousness. The operation was suspended, the patient was treated conservatively. Conclusions. The patients handled the procedure under block/ conduction anaesthesia well. Neurological testing of the patient awake during the procedure was a reliable method to ascertain cerebral blood circulation. Temporary <b>internal</b> <b>shunt</b> was used with patients who suffered a neurological deficit during the blockade of the carotid artery. As a result, the neurological deficit improved. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Percutaneous transluminal {{angioplasty}} (PTA) {{has proved}} to be an effective method for dilating stenoses in veins and arteries used for vascular access in haemo-dialysis. Not only can stenoses of arteriovenous fistulae (Cimino and other types) be treated, but stenoses of arteriovenous shunts (Scribner) can also be successfully dilated. Over a period of 3 years, PTA was applied 94 times in a haemodialysis population of about 50 patients. It reduced the number of surgical interventions required to maintain permanent vascular access by 30 %.

In one patient, an initial <b>internal</b> <b>shunt</b> was transformed to a cystoperitoneal shunt. After surgery, all patients experienced relief of symptoms. Reduction of cyst volume occurred in 11 patients. The {{patients were}} tested for brain asymmetries related to language and verbal memory before and after operation, with a dichotic listening technique with simultaneous presentation of different auditory stimuli to the two ears. In the preoperative memory test, the patients showed impaired total recall compared with healthy control subjects, and recall from the right ear was significantly impaired. The patients also performed poorly in a forced attention task consisting of dichotic presentations of consonant-vowel syllables. In addition to clinical improvement, the surgical procedures led to improvements in both dichotic perception and memory. Overall memory performance was enhanced, mainly because of improved recall from the right ear. This normalisation of memory function was found as early as four hours after the operation. The results indicate that arachnoid cysts in the left temporal fossa may impair cognitive function, that neuropsychological tests are necessary to disclose these impairments, and that cognitive improvement occurs after surgery...|$|E

All of the PV cells are assumed operating under the same ambient conditions where they share the same electric voltage and current values.

At the same time, overdamped junctions with single-valued characteristics are needed for most superconducting digital applications. The usual way to overcome the hysteretic behavior is to place an external low-resistance normal-metal shunt in parallel with each junction. Unfortunately, such solution results in a considerable complication of the circuitry design and introduces parasitic inductance through the junction. This paper provides a concise overview of some generic approaches that have been proposed in order to realize <b>internal</b> <b>shunting</b> in Josephson heterostructures with a barrier that itself contains the desired resistive component. The main attention is paid to self-shunted devices with local weak-link transmission probabilities so strongly disordered in the interface plane that transmission probabilities are tiny for {{the main part of the}} transition region between two superconducting electrodes, while a small part of the interface is well transparent. We consider the possibility of realizing a universal bimodal distribution function and emphasize advantages of such junctions that can be considered as a new class of self-shunted Josephson devices promising for practical applications in superconducting electronics operating at 4. 2 K.
