5|$|It's not my {{responsibility}} to draw (the audience) in, I just {{have to play the}} character. The way I would perform songs was always about the lyrics and always about trying to speak to everybody and make them watch and believe what I'm saying and I suppose I'm essentially <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> here but I'm not looking at the audience I'm obviously looking at the other actors.|$|E
5|$|Most of Rachel's {{songs are}} solos, with some being group tracks {{and a few}} being duets. About one song in every episode is led by Rachel. Depending on the theme, her song choice changes from Broadway to Top 40 to '60s music. In college, she leaned more into Broadway songs, because she was at a musical theater college, but did match mostly with {{whatever}} theme the Glee club was <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> week.|$|E
5|$|Norrington escapes {{with the}} heart amid a battle with Jones's crew, and Jones summons the Kraken. Realizing Sparrow is the target, Elizabeth traps him aboard the Black Pearl as the crew {{abandons}} the ship, and kisses him while she handcuffs him to the mast. Then, the monster devours Sparrow and drags the ship and his soul to Davy Jones's Locker. The surviving crew seeks refuge with Tia Dalma who produces a captain she says can rescue Sparrow: it was her <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> brought Barbossa back to life.|$|E

5|$|More {{accelerated}} {{classes were}} added, but {{the core of}} the gifted curriculum remained the individualized approaches and learning by <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> had long been central to the Avery Coonley curriculum. Nature study was still prominent in the student's activities, with music, art, and drama. The traditional learning themes and school projects involving maple trees, Native Americans, ancient Egypt and other topics were preserved but adapted to serve the gifted curriculum. In early 1980, an early childhood (EC) program for three-year-olds was launched, designed to cater to the needs of gifted preschool children and prepare them to transition from home to kindergarten. Again departing from the prevailing educational theory, Avery Coonley introduced academics in the EC program, with the same focus on nature, music, movement, and practical skills as the higher grades.|$|E

Both of them are smart for <b>doing</b> <b>that.</b> The song came out hard. Mariah knew I {{wanted to do a}} song with her. It finally happened, and it turned out hard. I just flew up there to New York, went in the studio with her. I flew right out and went back on the road. When I do a song with people, I like to really get in the studio with them so I could feel they swag and they could feel mine. The music comes out better.|$|E
5|$|At the old lady's house, Gary {{has been}} fed a lot. The old lady puts out fresh sheets of flyers {{given to her}} by Patrick. Upon reading them, Gary realizes that SpongeBob truly loves him and wants him back. He tries to leave, but instead of <b>doing</b> <b>that,</b> he ends up going to the closet, filled with empty snail shells. When the old lady tries to feed him again, Gary finds that the old lady most likely has {{sinister}} motives—she is possibly trying to fatten and then eat him. He makes his escape, but the old lady chases him out onto the streets. Gary quickly finds one of the gangster snails he saw before, which the old lady now mistakes for Miss Tuftsy, and takes him home instead. Back home, SpongeBob gives up on his search for Gary, and tries to forget about him by taking a walk, but his memories keep coming to mind and upsetting him. He is constantly reminded as the streets are filled with posters and signs for Gary. SpongeBob then hears a meow. At first he thinks he is imagining Gary is there, but then he turns around to find Gary is actually at his side, and he is overjoyed to see his beloved pet again.|$|E

5|$|Quagmire {{returns home}} from a holiday in Florida and comes to the Griffins' house to tell Peter that he has smuggled some {{fireworks}} into Quahog by hiding them in his anus. Peter tells him that fireworks aren't illegal in Quahog, so he didn't need to hide them and could have just brought them in normally, but Quagmire doesn't see any fun in <b>doing</b> <b>that.</b> Later on, the Griffins and Quagmire start {{to play with the}} fireworks. Peter attaches ten M-80s together and shows Quagmire, but they explode, detaching all the fingers from his right hand. With Joe's help, Peter is able to find his fingers and later gets them reattached to his hand. The next day, Peter celebrates getting his fingers reattached by going to The Drunken Clam with Cleveland, Joe and Quagmire, and they decide to continue their celebrations at Pawtucket Brewery after the bar closes. Peter is behind on his work at the brewery, as he is unable to type due to his hand injury, and Angela threatens him with the prospect of being fired if he fails to catch up, so he asks Lois to help him. When Lois agrees to help Peter catch up with his work, Peter attempts to seduce her numerous times. Later at the brewery, after a final attempt to seduce Lois in his office, she gives in and they have sex in front of their co-worker Opie, who runs away screaming. In the end, Peter is caught up with his work and enjoys having Lois help out and have sex with him.|$|E

30|$|One {{hundred and}} twenty five years later, {{in the era of}} Big Data, various {{statistical}} data are publicly available. The task of ensuring that security intensive information does not leak out becomes much more challenging. A modern man lives and works in a society oriented toward collecting and storing data on each and every person. Statistics services <b>do</b> <b>that</b> (census forms), taxing services <b>do</b> <b>that</b> (tax declarations), medical facilities <b>do</b> <b>that</b> (patient’s medical records), law enforcement agencies <b>do</b> <b>that</b> (person’s IDs), employers <b>do</b> <b>that</b> (CVs), retail stores <b>do</b> <b>that</b> (personal discount cards), security <b>does</b> <b>that</b> (security cameras files), {{and so on and so}} forth. Problems of preserving privacy in such data are widely discussed within the field of privacy-preserving data publishing (Fung et al. 2010; Wong and Fu 2010). To great extent, appropriate protection implies removing identifiers (passport data, full name etc.), and distorting the data (e.g., values of certain characteristics are swapped between respondents or get noised) or suppressing them (e.g., data on elder people are grouped in a category of senior citizens).|$|R

25|$|Because there's little {{standardized}} {{protocol for}} insect rearing, most farmers learn the best production methods {{by trial and}} error.
