60|$|The woman lifted <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> lips--touched them--and {{shook her}} head.|$|E
60|$|She {{took her}} own seat, and beckoned with <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> father.|$|E
60|$|She swept <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> knees {{over her}} silken lap, and turned upon Susan.|$|R
60|$|Diana {{had stood}} up very unsteadily; then {{she sat down}} again, putting <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> head.|$|R
60|$|She put up <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> eyes, {{as though}} to drive away the sight of hateful things.|$|R
60|$|THE ORACLE [sternly] Give {{it to me}} [she raises <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> veil].|$|E
60|$|My {{mother looked}} up, went very white, and put <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> bosom.|$|E
60|$|She beckoned with <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> father. He {{came and}} sat down by her.|$|E
60|$|Madame recoiled, and put <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> ears, horror {{stamped on}} her {{handsome}} face. Her massive bosom heaved.|$|R
6000|$|Pressing <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> temples, Helen resumed her restless march again, but {{suddenly}} broke out more violently than before: ...|$|R
60|$|LADY WINDERMERE. [Holding out <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> helplessly, as a {{child might}} do.] Take me home. Take me home.|$|R
60|$|She ceased; she {{had heard}} him at last. She pressed <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> forehead.|$|E
60|$|LADY CHESHIRE. I've tried; I [putting <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> throat] can't get it out.|$|E
60|$|With {{that the}} speaker came forward to the fire, panting and holding <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> side.|$|E
60|$|Madeline {{turned from}} the huge, ever-widening smile that beamed down upon her and held out <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> brother.|$|R
60|$|She blanched {{till she}} looked like death itself, and put <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> heart {{as though she had}} been stabbed.|$|R
60|$|She put up <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> head, and I {{could not}} help noticing how grimy and rough were her nails.|$|R
60|$|She put <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> throat--swayed. I made a step forward, {{and caught}} {{her in my}} arms.|$|E
60|$|She pressed <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{side and}} writhed. Telford turned desperately to the door. Min raised her arm.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Gribble, with <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> heart, tottered to {{the sofa}} and lay there with her eyes closed.|$|E
6000|$|MABEL. [With <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> forehead] I can't realise--I simply can't. If there's a {{case would}} it be all right afterwards? ...|$|R
60|$|WANDA. [Simply] Crying. [Pressing <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> breast] He is {{in danger}} because of me. I am so afraid for him.|$|R
60|$|She got {{up as she}} was speaking, and put <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> bonnet <b>to</b> adjust it, {{and then}} laid hold of her basket.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Bless us!' exclaimed Miss La Creevy, {{starting}} and putting <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> curl-papers. 'You're up very early, Mr Nickleby.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What's {{that you}} say, Tommy?" [...] {{interrupted}} old Martha, putting <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> ear and wrinkling her brow interrogatively.|$|E
60|$|There was {{something}} in his look, or in his tone, that mastered her. She put <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> head.|$|E
60|$|She {{had turned}} away; she raised <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> ears. He {{looked at her}} a moment, and then he slowly walked to church.|$|R
60|$|She put <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{head and}} sat quite {{still for a}} moment or two. It was really hard to take {{everything}} in.|$|R
6000|$|... "And you too {{think that}} I must not marry him?" [...] she said, putting up <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> brows as though <b>to</b> collect <b>her</b> thoughts.|$|R
60|$|Albinia slowly rose, and put <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> brow, {{as though}} {{confused}} with the tissue of deceit and double dealing.|$|E
60|$|The {{old woman}} stuck her needle into the quilt, {{and reached out}} <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> visitor, who took it cordially.|$|E
60|$|Carrie held <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> face a moment, as if {{the fire}} were hot, and then smiled as she looked up.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} him through a film of tears, her face drawn and startled. Then she put <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> brow {{in a gesture of}} bewildered helplessness.|$|R
60|$|She {{was afraid}} that her hair, {{specially}} done for him, would come down. She stood with <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> head. He hid the comb between his knees.|$|R
6000|$|MABEL too gets up. She presses <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> forehead, then [...] walks blindly {{round to}} behind {{the sofa and}} stands looking {{straight}} [...] in front of her.|$|R
