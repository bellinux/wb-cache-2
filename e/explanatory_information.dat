50|$|China and the Christian Impact was {{published}} in 1985 as the English translation of Jacques Gernet's Chine et christianisme of 1982. It received considerable attention from academic circles dealing with China and the Jesuit mission, mainly because of its approach to the subject from an almost exclusively Chinese point of view. In this Gernet differs much from previous studies on the China mission, the most famous {{up to that point}} perhaps being the Jesuit George Dunne's Generation of Giants (1962), which analyzes the Jesuit China mission from a decidedly eurocentric perspective. In spite of the wide range of source material consulted by its author, Gernet's book has been criticized on account of its apparent anachronisms, and lack of <b>explanatory</b> background <b>information</b> when dealing with historically related events.|$|R

40|$|Despite {{the growing}} {{use of the}} Internet as an {{effective}} marketing channel, {{there is a lack}} of comprehensive research regarding multinational corporations' (MNCs') Web sites for multiple cultures. In this paper, Japanese MNCs' product-based Web sites were content-analysed, comparing the Web sites created by the same firms in domestic and external markets. In total, 150 product-based Web sites were chosen from the Japanese, Spanish and US market samples. Three <b>explanatory</b> variables (<b>information</b> content, cultural values and creative strategies) were examined on the basis of cultural dimensions and contexts. The results revealed that Japanese MNCs are likely to localise their Web sites to meet the target market culture through tailoring content and creative strategies, but also that online product presentations do not reflect target-market values. In closing, implications and future research directions are discussed. Financial support provided by the Yoshida Hideo Foundation (Tokyo...|$|R

40|$|Considering {{absolute}} log {{returns as}} a proxy for stochastic volatility, the influence of explanatory variables on absolute log returns of ultra high frequency data is analysed. The irregular time structure and time dependency of the data is captured by utilizing a continuous time ARMA(p,q) process. In particular we propose a mixed effect model for the absolute log returns. <b>Explanatory</b> variable <b>information</b> is used to model the fixed effects, whereas the the error is decomposed in a non-negative L 9 vy driven continuous time ARMA(p,q) process and a market microstructure noise component. The parameters are estimated in a state space approach. In a small simulation study the performance of the estimators is investigated. We apply our model to IBM trade data and quantify the influence of bid-ask spread and duration on a daily basis. To verify the correlation in irregularly spaced data we use the variogram, known from spatial statistics...|$|R

50|$|Jameson sent General George Washington the six {{sheets of}} paper carried by André, but he was unwilling to believe that Benedict Arnold could be guilty of treason. He {{therefore}} insisted on sending a note to Arnold informing him of the entire situation. Jameson did not want his army career to be wrecked later for having wrongly believed that his general was a traitor. Arnold received Jameson's note while at breakfast with his officers, made an excuse to leave the room, and was not seen again. The note gave Arnold time to escape to the British. An hour or so later, Washington arrived at West Point with his party and was disturbed to see the stronghold's fortifications in such neglect, {{part of the plan}} to weaken West Point defenses. Washington was further irritated to find that Arnold had breached protocol by not being about to greet him. Some hours later, Washington received the <b>explanatory</b> <b>information</b> from Maj.

40|$|Product {{packaging}} is {{an important}} means for communicating product and brand benefits. Research suggests that visual metaphors may be particularly suited in this context, however, {{the conditions under which}} metaphors are effective are not yet well understood. In the research reported herein, effects of metaphor ambiguity and <b>explanatory</b> <b>information</b> on consumer appreciation and brand personality perceptions are tested.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I defend {{the idea that}} there is a sense in which it is {{meaningful}} and useful to talk about objective understanding, and that to characterize that notion it is necessary to formulate an account of explanation that makes reference to the beliefs and epistemic goals of the participants in a cognitive enterprise. Using the framework for belief revision developed by Isaac Levi, I analyze the conditions that information must fulfill to be both potentially explanatory and epistemically valuable to an inquiring agent and to a scientific community. To be potentially <b>explanatory,</b> the <b>information</b> must state the relations of probabilistic relevance that the explanans bares to the explanandum. But a potential explanation con only be a bona fide explanation if it becomes part of inquiry, that is, if an agent or a group of agents can see any value in it for their cognitive purposes. I provide a way to evaluate the epistemic value of a potential explanation as a function of its credibility and its informational content...|$|R
40|$|Gunther von Hagens’ Body Worlds {{exhibition}} contextualises its {{display of}} plastinated bodies within the Renaissance tradition of écorché (or flayed body) art—surrounding its figures with screen-prints of early modern anatomical illustrations, labels bearing <b>explanatory</b> medical <b>information,</b> and quotations about {{the body and}} mortality from religious and philosophical sources. This paper argues that the early modernécorché figure informs not only the iconography, but also the kind of anatomical knowledge—the anatomised vision of the body—that Body Worlds reproduces. While images of early modern anatomical art serve to foreground the declared educational aim of the show, primarily by contextualising it within {{a long history of}} public anatomy, they also reveal that for von Hagens, as for the Renaissance anatomists before him, the anatomical significance of the body is to be found by removing its skin and exposing its interior. Such images do not simply reveal the inside of the body, this article demonstrates, but rather represent the invention of a specifically modern concept of bodily interiority, one intricately connected to a wider reconceptualisation of the body as individual and self-contained...|$|R

40|$|Effects {{of forest}} {{thinning}} on community level properties {{have not been}} understood yet in Korea. We investigated regenerationpatterns and trajectories after a disturbance by applying a chronosequence approach. Light availability, litter andwoody debris cover, and species composition were determined for twenty 50 m line-transect samples representing a disturbanceduration gradient (within 11 years). Environmental factors such as light availability and coverage of woody debrisand litter changed abruptly after thinning {{and then returned to}} the pre-disturbance state. Although species richnesswas gained at shrub and ground layer in a limited way in both forests, cover of various functional types revealed diversityin their responses. Notably, Alnus firma stands exhibited a larger increment of cover in woody plants. Ordination analysisrevealed different regeneration trajectories between natural and planted stands. Based on ordination analysis, rehabilitatedstands showed movement to alternative states compared with natural ones, reflecting lower resilience to perturbation(i. e., lower stability). Our results suggest that community resilience to artificial thinning depends on properties ofthe dominant species. But to get more <b>explanatory</b> ecological <b>information,</b> longer-term static observations are required...|$|R
