Wilson received a $1,000 fine from MLB the next day, and he responded by coloring half of the shoes black with a marker. He said afterwards, [...] "The fact that he (Rodríguez) thinks these shoes throw 97–100 with cut {{might be a little}} far-fetched. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> probably have these checked for performance-enhancing cleats." [...] He also stated that he was punished [...] "for having too much awesome on my feet." ...|$|E

[...] He {{dropped his}} leg, {{and bent over}} as if to examine the grass; he ended by taking a blade of it between his teeth before he spoke again, with his head still down. [...] "I don't want to hurry 'em; I want to give 'em a fair show now we're here, and I'll let the stock go as long as I can. But I don't see very much gaiety around." ...|$|E
