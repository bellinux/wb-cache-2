500|$|Pliny's work {{frequently}} reflects Rome's imperial expansion {{which brought}} {{new and exciting}} things to the capital: exotic eastern spices, strange animals {{to be put on}} display or herded into the arena, even the alleged phoenix sent to the emperor Claudius in AD 47 – although, as Pliny admits, this was generally acknowledged to be a fake. Pliny repeated Aristotle's maxim that Africa was always producing something new. Nature's variety and versatility were claimed to be infinite: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>observed</b> nature she has always induced me to deem no statement about her incredible." [...] This led Pliny to recount rumours of strange peoples on the edges of the world. These monstrous races – the Cynocephali or Dog-Heads, the Sciapodae, whose single foot could act as a sunshade, the mouthless Astomi, who lived on scents – were not strictly new. They had been mentioned by the Greek historian Herodotus in the 5th century BC, but Pliny made them better known.|$|E
500|$|Henry Johnson survives, however, {{under the}} watchful eye of Dr. Trescott, who treats the injured man out of {{gratitude}} for saving his son's life. [...] Hagenthorpe, a leading figure in town, urges Trescott to let Henry die, stating that he [...] "will hereafter be a monster, a perfect monster, and probably with an affected brain. No man can observe you as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>observed</b> you and not know that it was a matter of conscience with you, but I am afraid, my friend, that it is one of the blunders of virtue." [...] Ultimately Trescott decides to move Henry, who has sustained disfiguring injuries to his face and psyche, to a local negro household, but Henry's presence proves troubling for the family's well-being, and he is moved to another. [...] One night Henry absconds, visiting various people around town and leaving terrified neighbors in his wake, including Bella Farragut, who he attempts to court as if no time has passed since they last met. [...] Not welcome anywhere else, Henry is eventually moved to the carriage-house in the newly built Trescott home. [...] Despite Dr. Trescott's protection, Henry is branded a monster by the townspeople, who avoid the Trescotts as a result. [...] Although previously Henry's friend, Jimmie now mocks him, daring his friends to approach the disfigured man. [...] Once the leading doctor in Whilomville, Trescott's reputation suffers greatly, as does that of his wife, who no longer receives visitors.|$|E

2500|$|Concerns {{were raised}} once {{defending}} World and European champions Serbia and Montenegro (former Yugoslavia) were set as the quarterfinal opponents. The Lithuanians still prevailed, already achieving a 30–19 {{advantage in the}} first quarter (30–19), and never giving any chances in a 98–82 victory. Serbian coach Božidar Maljković followed the match by saying that [...] "Lithuania plays the best team-play in this championship.

2500|$|Chakraverti's public {{declaration}} {{that she was}} a [...] witch came at a time, when India still considered the word [...] "witch", taboo. Author Kumkum Bhandari said that [...] "Ipsita was a pioneer. Remember, call someone a 'witch' and you could be in for slander. Legally. But she was easily accepted. Partly because of her packaging and presentation—she is elegant, articulate and poised. People listen when she speaks. [...] Life and magic course through and around her. Being a witch is about ripping away layers of social conditioning, gender limitations and protective shields. It is, in a sense about moving towards being the complete and total woman. There is intensity, conviction and passion in the way Ipsita talks about witchcraft, or Wicca—the Craft of the Wise—and its relevance throughout history." [...] Chakraverti also observes that [...] "If I had come from a different rung of society, or was illiterate, the reaction wouldn't be the same. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>observed</b> that it is always the person they will accept, and then the word Wicca. Witches are not born, they are made. Or perhaps they sculpt themselves." [...] According to her, every strong woman can be considered a witch. [...] "A witch is the total woman. Strong daring women who have dared to live their own life, whatever it is. Jacqueline Kennedy, Indira Gandhi, Marilyn Monroe, Madonna, Namita Gokhale, Kiran Bedi—all of them could count as witches." [...] Chakraverti has argued that Wicca is the first feminist movement in history and the oldest women-oriented branch of learning.|$|E

[...] Now I want you to go back to your people, call them all together, and tell them all about it. [...] Tell them {{to be very careful about}} their clothes; to see that they are perfectly clean and neat for that particular performance. [...] If anything needs repairs, tell them to attend to it at once. [...] We must please the King at this performance. [...] Rehearse your Indians well so they will do their best for me.

[...] It is very fine, and when the King attends the show, I want you to do an Indian dance in front of his box. [...] Will you do this for me?” [...] “Everything worked splendidly. [...] When it came time for the Indians to come in with their village in the center of the arena, we started the dance in which I was to appear before the King of England. [...] I had a beautiful lance, and as the dance proceeded I worked over toward the King’s box. [...] There I shook the lance in his face and danced my very prettiest, you may be sure. [...] The King had been very dignified thus far, and had not even smiled. [...] But when I got down to doing my fancy steps and gave a few Sioux yells, he had to smile in spite of himself. [...] I saw that I had made a hit with him and was very happy. After the show, Buffalo Bill brought the King and his party around the inside of the arena. [...] In front of him walked a big man who seemed to keep his eyes roving about all the while. [...] I think he must have been the King’s personal bodyguard. [...] Buffalo Bill brought the King over to me and we were introduced. [...] We shook hands, although neither of us said a word. [...] But I had the honor of being introduced to King Edward VII, the monarch of Great Britain.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Initial {{criticism}} of Amos Barton was mixed, with Blackwood's close friend W. G. Hamley [...] "dead against Amos" [...] and Thackeray diplomatically noncomittal. However, the complete Scenes of Clerical Life {{was met with}} 'just and discerning applause', and considerable speculation as to the identity of its author. Sales were no better than satisfactory, following a first printing of 1,500 copies, but Blackwood was none the less confident of Eliot's talent. Early reviewers deemed the writer [...] "religious, without cant or intolerance" [...] and [...] "strong in his [...] knowledge of the human heart". It was praised for its realism: one contemporary review noted approvingly that [...] "the fictitious element is securely based upon a broad groundwork of actual truth, truth as well in detail as in general". Due to its subject matter, it was widely assumed to {{be the work of}} a real-life country parson; one such even attempted to take the credit. Popular opinion in Eliot's home town attributed the work to a Mr Joseph Liggins, who attempted ineffectually to deny the rumours, and eventually accepted the undeserved celebrity. George Eliot's [...] "identity" [...] was revealed in a letter to The Times, but this claim was immediately refuted in a letter from Eliot herself. In 1858 Charles Dickens wrote to Eliot to express his approval of the book, and {{was among the first to}} suggest that Scenes of Clerical Life might have been written by a woman.I have been so strongly affected by the two first tales in the book you have had the kindness to send me, through Messrs. Blackwood, that I hope you will excuse my writing to you to express my admiration of their extraordinary merit. The exquisite truth and delicacy both of the humour and the pathos of these stories, I have never seen the like of; and they have impressed me in a manner that I should find it very difficult to describe to you. if I had the impertinence to try. In addressing these few words of thankfulness to the creator of the Sad Fortunes of the Rev. Amos Barton, and the sad love-story of Mr. Gilfil, I am (I presume) bound to adopt the name that it pleases that excellent writer to assume. I can suggest no better one: but I should have been strongly disposed, if I had been left to my own devices, to address the said writer as a woman. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>observed</b> what seemed to me such womanly touches in those moving fictions, that the assurance on the title-page is insufficient to satisfy me even now. If they originated with no woman, I believe that no man ever before had the art of making himself mentally so like a woman since the world began.|$|E
