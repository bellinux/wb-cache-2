500|$|After {{spending}} {{the early part}} of his career naming his songs with random words, he decided to use more personal titles. [...] "As Serious as Your Life" [...] takes its name from a 1977 Val Wilmer book about free jazz in New York City. Hebden was given a copy of the book by his father and said [...] "I did hope that some <b>kid</b> <b>would</b> get interested and ask what the title was and then check out the book, so it's a bit like leaving little trails for people." [...] He was inspired to title the album Rounds after hearing that his sister had been singing a musical round, telling an interviewer: [...] "It seemed totally relevant; a round is all about repetition and phasing, which is the essence of what I've been doing since I've been making music." ...|$|E
500|$|Aguilar {{was trained}} {{by his father}} prior to his {{professional}} wrestling debut. In 1999 he began working as the enmascarado (masked wrestler) character [...] "Kempo Kid", hiding his family relationship from the public. Between 1999 and 2002 or 2003 the Kempo <b>Kid</b> <b>would</b> win several Lucha de Apuestas, or [...] "bet matches" [...] where he forced his opponents to unmask as a result. His mask victories included Extasis, Avispón Jr. and Apolo Negro. In late 2002, or early 2003 Kempo Kid lost a Lucha de Apuestas match to Stuka Jr. {{and was forced to}} unmask. As part of the tradition wrestlers are supposed to announced their real name, which mean that Aguilar revealed that {{he was the son of}} El Texano. He subsequently took the ring name [...] "El Texano Jr.", adopting the same cowboy style character that his father used including carrying a lariat with him to the ring.|$|E
500|$|The series {{also saw}} the {{introduction}} of gunge based games too, the first being The Kid Gets It which would involve a celebrity speaking on a subject for 60 seconds without saying a trigger word. If they did, the <b>kid</b> <b>would</b> be gunged. In January 2001, the premise evolved into a courtroom setting with a trivial argument between friends trying to be settled. The person the jury found guilty would subsequently be gunged. In March 2001, the game took on the premise of The Leakiest Sink', a parody of The Weakest Link which involved three contestants vying to meet a celebrity. After three rounds of questions which would eliminate one contestant, the remaining two would go onto the final round where the celebrity would pick plugs out of a sink whilst the contestants switched for each one pulled. Whoever was sitting under the tank when the wrong plug was pulled would lose and be gunged, the one left untouched would win.' ...|$|E
50|$|The {{cast and}} the <b>kids</b> <b>would</b> then say their goodbyes and the <b>kids</b> <b>would</b> {{walk off the}} set as the closing credits ran. The show's closing theme was the last few verses of the Disney {{standard}} It's a Small World written by Robert & Richard Sherman.|$|R
50|$|The school {{remained}} a one-room school with one teacher until 1959, which was when another building was constructed for grades 4-8.There was a shed that the <b>kids</b> <b>would</b> stable the horses they rode to school, and each kid was responsible {{to bring their}} own hay for their horses. The rest of the <b>kids</b> <b>would</b> walk to school.|$|R

500|$|Bruce Campbell, {{a long-time}} {{colleague}} of director Sam Raimi, has a cameo as the announcer at the wrestling ring Peter takes part in. Years later, Jeffrey Henderson, {{who worked on}} the storyboards for the cancelled Spider-Man 4 movie, released information regarding which villains would appear within the movie. One of those included Bruce Campbell's character's progression into Quentin Beck / Mysterio. Ted Raimi, Sam Raimi's actor brother, plays a small role as editor's assistant [...] "Hoffman". Sam Raimi himself appeared off-screen, throwing popcorn at Peter as he enters the arena to wrestle Bonesaw McGraw. Spider-Man co-creator Stan Lee also has a cameo, in which he asks Peter, [...] "Hey <b>kid,</b> <b>would</b> you like a pair of these glasses? They're the kind they wore in X-Men." [...] The scene was cut, and Lee only briefly appears in the film to grab a young girl from falling debris during the battle between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin in Times Square. R/soul singer Macy Gray appears as herself. One of the stunt performers in the film is actor Johnny Tri Nguyen. Robert Kerman, best known for his performances in pornographic and exploitation films, has a bit part as a tugboat captain. Lucy Lawless makes a cameo as a punk rock girl. It was also intended for Hugh Jackman to make an appearance in the film as Logan / Wolverine, reprising the role from 2000's X-Men, but a dispute between Sony and 20th Century Fox over the characters' film rights prevented it from happening. The novelization of Spider-Man identifies Liz Allan as the character portrayed by Sally Livingstone.|$|E
2500|$|I wasn't trying to, quote, [...] "Americanize" [...] them... What I {{was trying}} to do is translate, which I think is different. I {{wanted to make sure that}} an American kid reading the book would have the same {{literary}} experience that a British <b>kid</b> <b>would</b> have." ...|$|E
2500|$|As North explained, [...] "...there was a vogue of a soubrette, as {{we called}} her, singing on the stage, and a <b>kid</b> <b>would</b> {{get up from}} the gallery and sing the chorus. The Gallery Gods, of course, thought {{he was one of}} them and applauded loudly. I was the kid in the gallery. I had the voice and I could sing." [...] North {{traveled}} around the USA with the company playing in small town opera houses or theaters for one- or two-night stands. [...] He developed a song and dance act.|$|E

2500|$|In addition, some taboos did {{not relate}} {{to the source of}} the food but {{to the way in which}} they were prepared, as in the {{prohibition}} against boiling a young goat in its mother’s milk (and mentioned in the Bible in three separate instances: , , [...] ). Milk and its by-products served as offerings in Near Eastern pagan worship to gods and kings and milk was used in connection with the phenomenon of reproduction, and a goat <b>kid</b> <b>would</b> be cooked in its mother's milk. Thus, the Israelite practice was to avoid an act similar to that carried out by the Canaanites as part of their cult worship (...) [...]|$|E
2500|$|Pythia {{would then}} remove her purple veil. [...] She would wear a short plain white dress. [...] At the temple fire to Hestia, a live goat <b>kid</b> <b>would</b> {{be set in}} front of the Altar and {{sprinkled}} with water. [...] If the kid trembled from the hooves upward it was considered a good omen for the oracle, but if it didn't, the enquirer was considered to have been rejected by the god and the consultation was terminated. [...] The goat was then slaughtered and upon sacrifice, the animal's organs, particularly its liver, were examined to ensure the signs were favourable, and then burned outside on the altar of Chios. [...] The rising smoke was a signal that the oracle was open. [...] The Oracle then descended into the adyton (Greek for [...] "inaccessible") and mounted her tripod seat, holding laurel leaves and a dish of Kassotis spring water into which she gazed. [...] Nearby was the omphalos (Greek for [...] "navel"), which was flanked by two solid gold eagles representing the authority of Zeus, and the cleft from which emerged the sacred pneuma.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why don't you sneak the kid away somewhere?" [...] he suggested. [...] "Why don't you {{go right}} in {{at them and}} say: 'It's my kid, and I'm {{going to take him}} away into the country out of all this white-tile stuff and let him roll in the mud same as he used to.' Why, say, there's that shack of yours in Connecticut, just made for it. That <b>kid</b> <b>would</b> have the time of his life there." ...|$|E

"When I {{was down}} in Alabama," [...] one <b>kid</b> <b>would</b> begin; or, another, [...] "Coming up on the C. & A. from K.C."; whereat, a third kid, [...] "On the C. & A. there ain't no steps to the 'blinds.'"

[...] "Talk about railroadin'--wait till you hit the Pennsylvania, four tracks, no water tanks, take water on the fly, that's goin' some." [...] "The Northern Pacific's a bad road now."

60|$|He {{came and}} sat down again next to me, and my {{attention}} wandered. The q-b was raging for her dinner. It must be quite half-past eight. The kid, the perfect <b>kid</b> <b>would</b> be cold and ruined. Both fire and candle were burning low. Someone had been out for a new candle, but there was evidently no means of replenishing the fire. The mate still crouched on the hearth, the dull red fire-glow on his handsome face, patiently trying to roast the kid and poking it against the embers. He had heavy, strong limbs in his khaki clothes, but his hand that held the spit was brown and tender and sensitive, a real Mediterranean hand. The girovago, blond, round-faced, mature and aggressive with all his liveliness, {{was more like a}} northerner. In the background were four or five other men, of whom I had distinguished none but a stout soldier, probably chief carabiniere.|$|E
5000|$|... "At first, we were {{intrigued}} by the idea, but we weren't sure <b>kids</b> <b>would</b> get the vague-tongue-and-check-of-it. Then {{a bunch of us}} took it home to our own children and they loved it." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{think if}} you analyze {{the needs of the}} school, in fact, going right at it {{as if it was a}} {{merchandizing}} problem, of course the one basic and fundamental need is growth. I presume we're all agreed we won't be satisfied till we build up the biggest darn Sunday School in the whole state, so the Chatham Road Presbyterian won't have to take anything off anybody. Now about jazzing up the campaign for prospects: they've already used contesting teams, and given prizes to the kids that bring in the most members. And they made a mistake there: the prizes were a lot of folderols and doodads like poetry books and illustrated Testaments, instead of something a real live <b>kid</b> <b>would</b> want to work for, like real cash or a speedometer for his motor cycle. Course I suppose it's all fine and dandy to illustrate the lessons with these decorated book-marks and blackboard drawings and so on, but when it comes down to real he-hustling, getting out and drumming up customers--or members, I mean, why, you got to make it worth a fellow's while.|$|E

Here Luke Dawson had been coming to me for every toeache and headache and a lot of little things that just wasted my time, and then when his grandchild was here last summer and had summer-complaint, I suppose, or something like that, probably--you know, the time you and I drove up to Lac-qui-Meurt--why, Westlake got hold of Ma Dawson, and scared her to death, and made her think the kid had appendicitis, and, by golly, if he and McGanum didn't operate, and holler their heads off about the terrible adhesions they found, and what a regular Charley and Will Mayo they were for classy surgery. They let on that if they'd waited two hours more the <b>kid</b> <b>would</b> have developed peritonitis, and God knows what all; and then they collected a nice fat hundred and fifty dollars. And probably they'd have charged three hundred, if they hadn't been afraid of me! I'm no hog, but I certainly do hate to give old Luke ten dollars' worth of advice for a dollar and a half, and then see a hundred and fifty go glimmering. And if I can't do a better 'pendectomy than either Westlake or McGanum, I'll eat my hat!" ...|$|E
