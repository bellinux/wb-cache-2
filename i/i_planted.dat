5|$|Ranavalona <b>I</b> <b>planted</b> a pair {{of royal}} fig trees {{at the far end}} of the Bevato {{compound}} and stood between them when addressing the public. These were later complemented by additional fig trees planted all around the courtyard by Ranavalona II and jacarandas planted by the French during the colonial period. The figs that shade the esplanade are believed to be imbued with hasina enhanced by the bones and skulls of sacrificed zebu and special marking stones that pilgrims from across Madagascar, Mauritius, Reunion and Comoros have come to place around them. Pilgrims gather in this courtyard to celebrate the Fandroana ceremony, during which time the sovereign historically engaged in a ritual bath to wash away the sins of the nation and restore order and harmony to society. Today, pilgrims celebrate by offering sacrifices or prayers to honor, appease or commune with their ancestors.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{speculated that}} such an {{invasion}} {{may have been the}} origin of the presence of the Brigantes in Ireland as noted in Ptolemy's 2nd century Geography. The Brigantes were a rebellious British tribe only recently conquered in Agricola's time. The dispossessed nobility may have been ready recruits for Tuathal's invasion force, or the Romans may have found it a convenient way of getting rid of troublesome subjects, just as Elizabeth I and James VI & <b>I</b> <b>planted</b> rebellious Scots in Ireland in the 16th and 17th century. Other tribal names associated with the south-east, including the Domnainn, related to the British Dumnonii, and the Menapii, also known from Gaul (Roman France), may also date from such an invasion.|$|E

Their homes were distant from {{political}} life, but Diocletian and Maximian were {{close enough to}} remain in regular contact with each other. Galerius assumed the consular fasces in 308 with Diocletian as his colleague. In the autumn of 308, Galerius again conferred with Diocletian at Carnuntum (Petronell-Carnuntum, Austria). Diocletian and Maximian were both present on 11 November 308, to see Galerius appoint Licinius to be augustus in place of Severus, who had died {{at the hands of}} Maxentius. He ordered Maximian, who had attempted to return to power after his retirement, to step down permanently. At Carnuntum people begged Diocletian to return to the throne, to resolve the conflicts that had arisen through Constantine's rise to power and Maxentius' usurpation. Diocletian's reply: [...] "If you could show the cabbage that <b>I</b> <b>planted</b> with my own hands to your emperor, he definitely wouldn't dare suggest that I replace the peace and happiness of this place with the storms of a never-satisfied greed." ...|$|E

40|$|Previously, we {{reported}} that OsNRAMP 5 {{functions as a}} manganese, iron, and cadmium (Cd) transporter. The shoot Cd content in OsNRAMP 5 RNAi plants was higher than that in wild-type (WT) plants, whereas the total Cd content (roots plus shoots) was lower. For efficient Cd phytoremediation, we produced OsNRAMP 5 RNAi plants using the natural high Cd-accumulating cultivar Anjana Dhan (A 5 i). Using a positron-emitting tracer imaging system, we assessed the time-course of Cd absorption and accumulation in A 5 <b>i</b> <b>plants.</b> Enhanced 107 Cd translocation from the roots to the shoots was observed in A 5 <b>i</b> <b>plants.</b> To evaluate the phytoremediation capability of A 5 <b>i</b> <b>plants,</b> we performed a field experiment in a Cd-contaminated paddy field. The biomass of the A 5 <b>i</b> <b>plants</b> was unchanged by the suppression of OsNRAMP 5 expression; the A 5 <b>i</b> <b>plants</b> accumulated twice as much Cd in their shoots as WT plants. Thus, A 5 <b>i</b> <b>plants</b> {{could be used for}} rapid Cd extraction and the efficient phytoremediation of Cd from paddy fields, leading to safer food production...|$|R

2500|$|The Persian term [...] "paradise" [...] (Hebrew פרדס, pardes), {{meaning a}} royal garden or hunting-park, {{gradually}} became {{a synonym for}} Eden after c. 500BCE. The word [...] "pardes" [...] occurs {{three times in the}} Old Testament, but always in contexts other than a connection with Eden: in the Song of Solomon iv. 13: [...] "Thy plants are an orchard (pardes) of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; camphire, with spikenard"; Ecclesiastes 2. 5: [...] "I made me gardens and orchards (pardes), and <b>I</b> <b>planted</b> trees in them of all kind of fruits"; and in Nehemiah ii. 8: [...] "And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king's orchard (pardes), that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which appertained to the house, and for the wall of the city." [...] In these examples pardes clearly means [...] "orchard" [...] or [...] "park", but in the apocalyptic literature and in the Talmud [...] "paradise" [...] gains its associations with the Garden of Eden and its heavenly prototype, and in the New Testament [...] "paradise" [...] becomes the realm of the blessed (as opposed to the realm of the cursed) among those who have already died, with literary Hellenistic influences.|$|E
2500|$|Bernhardt's first American tour {{carried her}} to 157 {{performances}} in 51 cities. She traveled {{on a special}} train with her own luxurious palace car, which carried her two maids, two cooks, a waiter, her maitre d'hôtel, and her personal assistant, Madame Guérard. It also carried an actor named Édouard Angelo whom she had selected to serve as her leading man, and, according to most accounts, her lover during the tour. From New York, she made a side trip to Menlo Park, where she met Thomas Edison, who made a brief recording of her reciting a verse from Phèdre [...] She crisscrossed the United States and Canada from Montreal and Toronto to Saint Louis and New Orleans, usually performing each evening, and departing immediately after the performance. She gave countless press interviews and in Boston posed for photos {{on the back of}} a dead whale. She was condemned as immoral by the Bishop of Montreal and by the Methodist press, which only increased ticket sales. She performed Phedre six times and La Dame Aux Camilias (which Jarrett had renamed [...] "Camille" [...] to make it easier for Americans to pronounce) 65 times. On 3 May 1881, she gave her final performance of Camelias in New York. Throughout her life, she always insisted on being paid in cash. When Bernhardt returned to France, she brought with her a chest filled with $194,000 in gold coins [...] She described the result of her trip to her friends: [...] "I crossed the oceans, carrying my dream of art in myself, and the genius of my nation triumphed. <b>I</b> <b>planted</b> the French verb in the heart of a foreign literature, and it is that of which I am most proud." ...|$|E

40|$|Soybean (Glycine max [L. ] Merr. cv Braxton) {{plants were}} grown in sandy soil with only natural {{rainfall}} (N) or with supplemental irrigation (<b>I).</b> Water-stressed <b>plants</b> grew more extensive root systems, whereas irrigated plants developed larger shoots and smaller root systems. Maximum stomatal apertures were observed {{at the beginning}} of each photoperiod. Partial stomatal closure occurred each afternoon, but stomata of <b>I</b> <b>plants</b> remained open longer than those of N plants. Significant reductions in net carbon fixation rate generally accompanied decreases in stomatal aperture, which coincided with periods of high temperature, low relative humidity, maximum solar radiation, and water stress. Leaf water potential decreased from morning to afternoon, with a greater decrease observed for N plants. Midafternoon stomatal closure did not occur in N plants with very large root systems following a heavy rain which saturated the soil profile. With smaller root systems and greater evaporative demand from larger shoots, the <b>I</b> <b>plants</b> continued to show midafternoon stress following the heavy rain. The large root systems of the N plants absorbed sufficient water to meet shoot evaporative demand for several days following the rain. Root soil system resistance apparently contributed to the afternoon water stress in the <b>I</b> <b>plants...</b>|$|R
