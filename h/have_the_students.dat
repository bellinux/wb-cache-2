50|$|CeremonyAlthough ceremonies {{vary from}} school to school, certain basic {{elements}} are usually the same. A typical graduation ceremony starts with the processional, which in some cases consists of the graduating class and their parents who formally walk side by side into the venue for the ceremony. Some schools <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> leave their parents at their designated seats. Boys then go {{up on the stage}} from the left and girls from the right. The two lines meet in center stage and go down the front steps, each pair bowing to the audience just before they reach the top step.|$|E
5000|$|Rather than {{focusing}} on choosing {{a small number of}} undesirable behaviors, <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> select several desirable behaviors instead. This way they practice, observe and report the behaviors the teacher has deemed important Every time the teacher [...] "catches" [...] a student engaging in one of the predetermined appropriate behaviors, a tally or token is added to the students bank. Simultaneously the teacher can then [...] "earn points" [...] for catching the students engaging in predetermined undesired behaviors. The goal here is to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> tally more points for their desirable behavior than the teacher will tally for undesirable behavior. You can even allow the students to catch each other engaging in those predetermined behaviors to earn points. This gets them looking for and modeling desired behavior. Don't be overly concerned in the beginning if this distracts from learning, especially if behavior change is needed immediately and sorely in the classroom. Be sure to shape course of the game as time progresses over a few days and weeks. Allowing them to win and setting them up for success is key in the beginning so that they associate this game with rewards. Ultimately, if the students are able to tally more points than the teachers, a simple contingency is set up (i.e. An extra 5 minutes of recess). If the teacher happens to win (this should not be all that frequent) then the students owe their teacher an undesirable course of action (i.e. an extra five minutes of math problems).|$|E

In the spring semester of 1986 students at Smith College protested the Board of Trustee's decision not to fully divest the college's endowment from companies in South Africa. Student protests included a sit-in in College Hall, the main administrative office which included nearly 100 students sleeping in over night on 24 February 1986.

50|$|The {{main focus}} of the MOELC is at the {{secondary}} education level. Grading is examination-oriented. The formal goal of the MOELC is to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> pass their GCE 'O' Levels for their respective languages, as the MOELC does not issue a diploma per se upon students' graduation from their respective courses. Qualifications received thus take {{in the form of}} an O-level certificate. For students taking a foreign language as their second language, these second language qualifications are necessary to enter most tertiary institutions in Singapore, due to the requirement for bilingualism. Grades are reported quarterly to the students' respective schools, with the two Continual Assessments (each making up 15% of the year-end grade), the first Semestral Assessment (25%) and the Final Examination (45%) contributing to a student's final grade.|$|E

50|$|In 1831, Catharine Beecher {{suggested}} teachers {{read aloud}} to students the passages from writers with elegant styles, “to accustom the ear to the measurement of the sentences and the peculiar turns of expression” (Wright & Halloran, 2001, p. 215).She went on to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> imitate the piece read using words, style, and turns of expression in order to develop, “a ready command of the language and easy modes of expression” (Wright & Halloran, 2001, p. 215). In 1846, Beecher pronounced that women, not men, should educate children and established schools for training teachers in western cities. She advocated that young ladies find godly work as Christian teachers away from the larger Eastern cities. The Board of National Popular Education, which was her idea, trained teachers in four-week sessions in Connecticut and then sent them out West. She believed that women had a higher calling to shape children and society.|$|E
