Several natural sites also offer green exercise, with exercise equipment installed along the paths and tracks reserved for mountain biking. The newly reconstructed area of Skjoldhøjkilen <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>prime</b> <b>example.</b>|$|E
5|$|On {{his trip}} to Germany, Ruisdael {{encountered}} water mills which he turned into a principal subject for painting, the first artist to ever do so. Two Water Mills with an Open Sluice, dated 1653, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>prime</b> <b>example.</b> The ruins of Egmont Castle near Alkmaar were another favourite subject of Ruisdael's and feature in The Jewish Cemetery, of which he painted two versions. With these, Ruisdael pits the natural world against the built environment, which has been overrun by the trees and shrubs surrounding the cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Cassini {{observations}} {{provided a}} much {{closer look at}} the crater distribution and size, showing that many of Enceladus' craters are heavily degraded through viscous relaxation and fracturing. Viscous relaxation allows gravity, over geologic time scales, to deform craters and other topographic features formed in water ice, reducing the amount of topography over time. The rate at which this occurs is dependent on the temperature of the ice: warmer ice is easier to deform than colder, stiffer ice. Viscously relaxed craters tend to have domed floors, or are recognized as craters only by a raised, circular rim. Dunyazad crater <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>prime</b> <b>example</b> of a viscously relaxed crater on Enceladus, with a prominent domed floor.|$|E

5|$|Taft is now better {{remembered for}} his books, such as The History of American Sculpture (1903), {{regarded}} as the first comprehensive work on the subject. However, in his day he was well known for portraits and allegorical public sculpture, of which Fountain of Time <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>prime</b> <b>example.</b> It was produced in the period following his assignment to design sculptures for William Le Baron Jenney's 1893 Horticultural Building for the World's Columbian Exposition. During this period he designed several large-scale public works, including Fountain of the Great Lakes. Taft resided in Illinois {{for most of his}} life and worked in the Midway Studios starting in 1906.|$|E
5|$|The museum {{building}} {{was designed by}} architect Daniel Libeskind and opened in July 2002, receiving 470,000 visitors {{in its first year}} of opening. It was recognised with awards or prize nominations for its architecture and <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>prime</b> <b>example</b> of Deconstructivist architecture. The museum features a permanent exhibition of chronological and thematic displays, supported by hourly audiovisual presentations which are projected throughout the gallery space. The museum also hosts a programme of temporary exhibitions in a separate gallery. Since opening, the museum has operated a successful volunteer programme, which since January 2007 has been run in partnership with Manchester Museum. As part of a national museum, Imperial War Museum North is financed by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and by self-generated income. Admission is free.|$|E
5|$|Catherine Rottenberg {{argues that}} Larsen’s novella <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>prime</b> <b>example</b> {{of race and}} gender norms portrayed in the US. The main characters, Irene and Clare, and their {{struggle}} with their own identification problems in the novel, helps readers {{understand the difference between}} gender and race norms. These two central characters are able to pass as white women even though Irene does not fully pass over, and Rottenberg argues the difference between Clare and Irene by re-evaluating the idea of desire/identification. The mis-identification Clare deals with stems from her re-connection with Irene after twelve years of not speaking. Seeing Irene sparked a desire in Clare for her to get back in touch with her African-American culture. Irene's identification trouble is associated with her need to feel safe and in control in her life, the main reason Irene chooses to pass over only on occasion. Irene doesn't want to put herself into a dangerous situation.|$|E

25|$|Accumulation {{occurs as}} {{crystals}} are formed by fractional crystallisation and, {{if they are}} dense enough, precipitate out from the magma. In large, hot magma chambers having vigorous convection and settling, pseudo-sedimentary structure,s such as flow banding, graded bedding, scour channels, and foreset beds, can be created. The Skaergaard intrusion in Greenland <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>prime</b> <b>example</b> of these quasi-sedimentary structures.|$|E

For example, the Chasa Bonpuli {{introduced}} earlier <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>prime</b> <b>example</b> {{of a hero}} myth; however, it is also related to the myths concerning the Underworld, and is treated as such. In the Chasa Bonpuli myth, the mortal Gangrim Doryeong captures Yeomra, King of the Underworld, and brings him to his homeland.|$|E

50|$|Combining low-brow comedy with {{elements}} of action, adventure and even horror, Lam Ngai Kai’s films starting with Ghost Snatchers <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>prime</b> <b>example</b> of Hong Kong cinema as an cinema of attractions {{as described by}} film scholar Tom Gunning and further examined in film studies all over the world. Gunning’s analysis sees the main principle of early cinema as “exhibitionist confrontation rather than diegetic absorption” and can be expanded not just to experimental cinema but also to certain trends in commercial cinema. Hong Kong films <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>prime</b> <b>example</b> of <b>a</b> cinema where narration <b>is</b> secondary to <b>a</b> constant stream of attractions.|$|R

Glutamate <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>prime</b> <b>example</b> of an excitotoxin in the brain, {{and it is also}} the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian CNS. During normal conditions, glutamate concentration can be increased up to 1mM in the synaptic cleft, which is rapidly decreased in the lapse of milliseconds. When the glutamate concentration around the synaptic cleft cannot be decreased or reaches higher levels, the neuron kills itself by a process called apoptosis.|$|E

25|$|However, {{competitive}} {{markets are}} not without limitations. Basic economic theory dictates that for competition to exist, {{a large number of}} market participants are required. Experience with deregulation in the United States and the United Kingdom, however, has shown that competitive markets can lead to market power concentration and market manipulation. In these jurisdictions, the market has been threatened by the strategic behaviour of incumbents and new entrants that have too large a market share. The case of Enron in California <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>prime</b> <b>example.</b> For a competitive market to function, firms cannot significantly influence prices by adjusting or shutting down supply individually.|$|E
25|$|Telecommunications {{equipment}} providers, {{convinced that}} the future economy would require ubiquitous broadband access, went deeply into debt to improve their networks with high-speed equipment and fiber optic cables. In the struggle to become a technology hub, many cities and states used tax money to fund technology conference centers, advanced infrastructure, and created favorable business and tax law to encourage development of the dotcom industry in their locale. Virginia's Dulles Technology Corridor along I-495 <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>prime</b> <b>example</b> of this activity. Large quantities of high-speed fiber links were laid, and the State and local governments gave tax exemptions to technology firms. Office vacancy increased significantly after the bubble burst, although the area still remains a major technology hub.|$|E
25|$|Work on the {{interiors}} {{came to a}} halt when the building's fabric was completed. Not until the 1730s was the first phase of interior work carried out, including a palace chapel in the attic designed by the Swedish architect Carl Hårleman. The interiors at Strömsholm Palace are largely Gustavian in style. In 1766 the heir to the Swedish throne, later King Gustav III, married Princess Sophia Magdalena of Denmark. As a wedding present from the Riksdag of the Estates, she was given Strömsholm Palace. Extensive interior works commenced, under the architectural direction of Carl Fredrik Adelcrantz, and continued into the 19th century. The queen's bedchamber <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>prime</b> <b>example</b> of Swedish interior design {{from the start of the}} Gustavian era, as well as the Chinese dining room with its fabric-covered walls with Chinese style paintings done by the renowned tapestry painter Lars Bolander.|$|E
