30|$|Comparisons between refuge fire records since 1975 {{and those}} {{recorded}} by tree rings showed good, but not perfect, agreement. The 1978 <b>fire</b> <b>scar</b> was unverifiable {{due to an}} alteration in the fire notes (i.e., fire records indicate an event occurred either in 1975, 1978, or both). The 1982 dormant-season <b>fire</b> <b>scar</b> corresponded to a February 1982 wildfire of unknown cause. The 1989 fire event corresponded to a January 1989 wildfire caused by vehicle sparks. A February 1993 prescribed fire event occurring throughout the study site was undetected through <b>fire</b> <b>scars.</b> The 1996 and 1999 <b>fire</b> <b>scars</b> were unverified by <b>fire</b> records. These <b>scars</b> were small, only represented by a partial scar on one sample, but {{we were unable to}} discount as fire events based on physical features and callus growth that mimicked those of <b>fire</b> <b>scars.</b> The 2001 dormant-season <b>fire</b> <b>scar</b> corresponded to a September 2000 wildfire.|$|R
30|$|There were 11 {{instances}} (9 % Type I error rate), using <b>fire</b> <b>scars</b> {{and growth}} changes, where evidence of fire was detected within the stand despite being located outside the mapped fire perimeter. Using only <b>fire</b> <b>scars,</b> the Type I error rate is only 2 %. Except in one case, these false detections were, on average, 10 km from the mapped perimeters {{with a range}} of 5 km to 15 km. Conversely, Type II error rates using <b>fire</b> <b>scars</b> and growth change data (5 %) are lower than that observed when using only <b>fire</b> <b>scar</b> evidence (7.5 %) (Table 2).|$|R
30|$|Early {{growing season}} (earlywood) fires were very rare (1.7 percent). The three late-earlywood <b>fire</b> <b>scars</b> were {{recorded}} from the Huddart 1 and Wunderlich sites. No <b>fire</b> <b>scars</b> {{were found in}} the early or middle portion of the earlywood.|$|R
30|$|We {{were able}} to {{approximate}} seasonality of fire occurrence for 296 of the 373 (79.4 %) <b>fire</b> <b>scars</b> found in the study area. The majority of <b>fire</b> <b>scars</b> were detected in the latewood (17.7 %) and dormant (53.4 %) portions of the annual growth rings, indicating that most fires {{took place in the}} late summer, fall, or early winter. By contrast, we detected only 8 % of the <b>fires</b> <b>scars</b> in the earlywood potions of annual growth rings.|$|R
30|$|Partial cross {{sections}} were {{cut with a}} chainsaw from all fire-scarred snags, downed logs, and live trees with visible <b>fire</b> <b>scars</b> within the four <b>fire</b> <b>scar</b> sampling areas. In some cases, several cuts were needed to obtain a sample with a maximum number of <b>fire</b> <b>scars</b> and a minimum of rotted wood. Live trees were not sampled more than twice and were sampled conservatively to reduce the probability of mechanical failure (Heyerdahl and McKay 2001, Stephens 2001). Each fire-scarred sample was sanded with a belt sander using a series of belts up to 400 grit. <b>Fire</b> <b>scars</b> were identified by the characteristic disruption and healing patterns of radial tree ring growth (McBride 1983).|$|R
40|$|Disturbance events, such as fire, have a {{major impact}} on boreal forest dynamics, succession, and the global carbon cycle. Methods using {{satellite}} imagery are well established for detecting forest fires in real time and mapping the burned area (<b>fire</b> <b>scars)</b> within one year of the fire. This paper focuses on the detection of older fire disturbance–regeneration patterns in the boreal forests of Canada. Previous work found that shortwave-infrared image segmentation proved particularly good at creating uniform regions that were easy to associate with <b>fire</b> <b>scars.</b> Our findings suggest it is possible to detect <b>fire</b> <b>scars</b> up to ten years old using SPOT-VEGETATION data from a single year and that the use of a vegetation index based on near- and shortwave-infrared reflectance is critical to this success. We demonstrate how the use of short-term multitemporal imagery can enhance segmentation results and present a threshold-based procedure for a posteriori identification of <b>fire</b> <b>scar</b> segments. The resulting <b>fire</b> <b>scar</b> probability map showed a good correspondence with records of <b>fire</b> <b>scars</b> mapped by the Canadian Forest Service for 1980 – 1992 and “hot spots” from the FireM 3 Information System for 1994 – 1998...|$|R
30|$|We {{tested for}} {{statistical}} differences in <b>fire</b> <b>scar</b> {{area as a}} function of AOI over the 5 -year span (2000 to 2004) using the Kruskal-Wallis statistic. Pairwise comparisons for differences among AOI median area were conducted using Mann-Whitney U test. The null hypothesis in all cases was that of no difference among AOIs. Areas for <b>fire</b> <b>scars</b> in ENP were obtained from the fire management database, whereas <b>fire</b> <b>scar</b> areas for the WCAs were computed from their hand-digitized polygons. The database contains <b>fire</b> <b>scars</b> that are too small to locate in 30 m resolution imagery. To eliminate this bias in our area comparisons, ENP fires smaller than the smallest fire detected by visual examination in the WCAs (1.6 ha) were removed prior to analysis.|$|R
30|$|To {{determine}} the fire return interval (FRI), annual rings between successive <b>fire</b> <b>scars</b> were counted for each sample. Some areas between <b>fire</b> <b>scars</b> were excessively burned and this probably eliminated some <b>fire</b> <b>scars.</b> These intervals {{were excluded from}} point and site FRI estimates (non-recording years). The position within the ring in which a scar occurred was noted as EE (early earlywood), ME (middle earlywood), LE (late earlywood), LW (latewood), D (dormant), or U (undetermined) {{to serve as an}} estimate of the season of fire occurrence (Ahlstrand 1980, Dieterich and Swetnam 1984).|$|R
30|$|Each {{sample was}} {{progressively}} sanded with finer sandpaper, ending with 400 grit, to distinguish tree rings and <b>fire</b> <b>scars.</b> <b>Fire</b> <b>scars</b> {{were identified by}} the disruption and healing pattern of tree ring growth associated with the injury (McBride 1983). Calendar years were assigned to each <b>fire</b> <b>scar</b> by cross-dating rings using common dendrochronological techniques (Dieterich 1980, Swetnam and Thompson 1985). Patterns of tree rings were compared {{to each other and}} to a nearby published master tree ring chronology from Lemon Canyon (Holmes 1980). When possible, the season of a <b>fire</b> <b>scar</b> was identified from the location of the scar within the growth ring (Caprio and Swetnam 1995). The position was noted as early earlywood, middle earlywood, late earlywood, latewood, dormant, or undetermined (Ahlstrand 1980, Dieterich and Swetnam 1984, Caprio and Swetnam 1995).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The spectral, {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} characteristics of the Landsat data record make it appropriate for mapping <b>fire</b> <b>scars.</b> Twenty-two annual <b>fire</b> <b>scar</b> maps from 1972 – 2002 were produced from historical Landsat imagery for a semi-arid savannah landscape on the South Africa–Botswana border, centred over Madikwe Game Reserve (MGR) in South Africa. A principal components transformation (PCT) helped differentiate the spectral signal of <b>fire</b> <b>scars</b> in each image. A simple, nonparametric, supervised classification (parallelepiped) of the PCT data differentiated burned and unburned areas. During most years, fire occurrences {{and the percentage of}} area burned annually were lowest in Botswana, highest in MGR, and intermediate in South Africa outside MGR. These <b>fire</b> <b>scar</b> maps are aiding MGR managers, who are endeavouring to restore a more active fire regime following decades of fire exclusion. 1...|$|R
40|$|Dendroecological {{methods were}} used to select and analyze <b>fire</b> <b>scarred</b> trees in central Idaho. Twenty four trees and stumps with {{multiple}} <b>fire</b> <b>scars</b> were cross-dated to identify the year and season of fire occurrence, referenced to a master chronology developed from increment cores from live trees in the area. Fires were frequent in the area, with Weibull mean fire return interval of 8 years. <b>Fire</b> <b>scar</b> locations indicated that fires occurred primarily {{in the late summer}} and fall, which was consistent with fire occurrence data records. <b>Fire</b> <b>scars</b> were absent from all trees after 1890, likely corresponding to rapid settlement of the area around Idaho City beginning in 1862, and active fire suppression some time in the early 1900 ’s.

Datasets to be archived included tree-ring chronologies (annual resolution), fire event chronologies (annual to seasonal resolution), and wood samples. Crossdated tree-ring measurements used to date <b>fire</b> <b>scars</b> have been submitted to the International Tree-Ring Databank. All fire history datasets, including metadata, have been submitted to NOAA’s International Multiproxy Paleofire Databank. Metadata describing tree species, spatial attributes, and access were entered into Metavist. The management implications of these data pertain to applications to forest ecosystem conservation and restoration through the design of fire management programs.

30|$|We {{determined}} {{the season of}} fire occurrence for 1345 (68 % of total) <b>fire</b> <b>scars.</b> <b>Fire</b> <b>scars</b> were found mainly in latewood (47 %) and at the ring boundary (32 %) and they were much less frequent in early wood (late = 15.6 %; middle = 5.8 %; early = 0.2 %).|$|R
30|$|To {{evaluate}} widespread versus {{localized fire}} activity, we compared synchrony of <b>fire</b> <b>scars</b> among the plots. For this purpose, {{four of the}} five DRY plots were grouped into a single group since they were located in a landscape context in which fires could spread between them. This gave us two MESIC plots and two DRY groups for comparison. Fire activity was considered synchronous within groups and across the study area if the following criteria were met: 1) synchrony in MESIC plots occurred when both MESIC plots had <b>fire</b> <b>scars</b> in the same year, 2) synchrony in DRY plots occurred when both DRY groups had <b>fire</b> <b>scars</b> in the same year, and 3) synchrony across the study occurred when one of the DRY groups and one of the MESIC plots had <b>fire</b> <b>scars</b> in the same year.|$|R
30|$|While <b>fire</b> <b>scars</b> in {{ponderosa pine}} (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.) {{forests of the}} southwestern US {{have been used to}} {{accurately}} reconstruct the extent of fires (Farris et al. 2010), the accuracy of using <b>fire</b> <b>scars</b> for reconstructing <b>fire</b> extent in oak forests has not been established. For this reason we limited inferences and discussion concerning the historical spatial extent of fires and focused more on the temporal aspects of the OGMA fire history. The use of <b>fire</b> <b>scars</b> to accurately reconstruct temporal aspects of fire in oak forests has been well established (Guyette and Stambaugh 2004).|$|R
30|$|During {{the period}} from 1600 to 2005, 238 fire {{indicators}} (either <b>fire</b> <b>scars</b> or growth changes) were cross-dated, and 72 % of the events (n = 171) were identified using <b>fire</b> <b>scars.</b> All 171 fire-scar records were accompanied by a corresponding growth change event within the same stand; however, because these supplementary growth change events were associated with <b>fire</b> <b>scars</b> from the same stand, they {{were not included in}} the analysis. The remaining fire events (n = 67), those with no direct fire-scar evidence within the same stand, were resolved using only growth change data (Table 1).|$|R
30|$|We {{delineated}} 107 <b>fire</b> <b>scars</b> in the WCAs for the 2000 through 2004 study period. While the ENP database included 72 <b>fire</b> <b>scar</b> perimeters {{for this}} time period, only 47 of them were large enough (> 1.6 ha) to be visible at the Landsat 30 m pixel scale and therefore included in the study.|$|R
30|$|<b>Fire</b> <b>scar</b> {{detection}} utilised a semi-automated approach. Polygons were segmented {{from the}} raster data layer using Definiens® ECognition™ v 4.0.

All <b>fire</b> <b>scars</b> derived from MODIS were supplied by the Tropical Savannas Cooperative Research Centre.|$|R
30|$|We searched within aspen {{patches and}} along the patch {{boundaries}} for conifers with potential direct evidence of <b>fire</b> (e.g., <b>fire</b> <b>scars,</b> conifer death dates, and ring-width changes and injuries). Cross sections and partial cross sections were collected with handsaws from remnant conifer logs, living trees, and standing dead snags with intact outer rings. Increment cores were collected from potentially injured live conifers without basal scars. Potential evidence of fire injury included char, scars on the undersides of branches, elevated crown base height, and unilateral loss of branches. <b>Fire</b> <b>scars</b> were not collected at PIN due to the existing <b>fire</b> <b>scar</b> collection located within our study site (Grissino-Mayer et al. 1995).|$|R
40|$|AbstractFire {{is a major}} {{disturbance}} {{factor in}} boreal forest ecosystems. Research on fire regimes is important for understanding fire disturbance and for taking a scientific approach to fire management in the Daxing’anling region. <b>Fire</b> <b>scars</b> in Daxing’anling were extracted from NOAA/MODIS satellite remote sensing data for the period 1987 - 2010. The paper analyzed the spatial-temporal characteristics of the <b>fire</b> <b>scars</b> {{and the relationship between}} burned areas and forest fire danger indexes.

40|$|Abstract- Multitemporal {{principal}} components analyses (PCAs) of pre- and post-burn Landsat Thematic Mapper images {{were used to}} map <b>fire</b> <b>scars</b> in Madikwe Game Reserve (MGR), South Africa. Prior to MGR's inception in 1991, when the land was used for extensive cattle ranching, overgrazing and fire suppression lead to bush encroachment. Fire is currently being used to control bush encroachment. Bands 3, 4, 5, 7 and a NDVI band from both pre- and post-burn images were included in both the 1994 and 1996 PCAs. <b>Fire</b> <b>scars</b> comprised the fourth principal component (PC 4) in both years. Fire intensities were classified via a density slice of the PC 4 data within <b>fire</b> <b>scars.</b> In 1994, <b>fires</b> covered 31 % of MGR and in 1996, 56 %. In both years, fires were more frequent and intense on soils with lower bush densities (and therefore higher grass fuel loads) than on soils with higher bush densities.

40|$|Report Prepared For: The Silviculture Laboratory, Bend, OregonIn 1982 the Silviculture Laboratory {{located in}} Bend, Oregon {{provided}} the University of Arizona's Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research with nine fire-scarred ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) cross sections from the Pringle Falls area in Central Oregon {{to assess the}} potential for fire history studies in that locale.

The individual ring series did contain enough shared sensitivity for crossdating and the development of a Pringle Falls skeleton plot chronology. This chronology made possible the accurate dating of the tree -ring series and <b>fire</b> <b>scars,</b> resulting in an extraordinarily lengthy record of fire occurrence.

30|$|Over 100 cross {{sections}} with apparent <b>fire</b> <b>scars</b> (<b>fire</b> <b>scar</b> samples) were cut from stumps, snags, and downed logs of various {{species in the}} PNF from 1997 – 1999 by US Forest Service employees.

Samples were taken from sites near Antelope Lake, near La Porte Road east {{of the town of}} Quincy, near Frenchman Lake, and surrounding the town of Portola (Moody, 2005). Clusters of <b>fire</b> <b>scars</b> were located, existing vegetation was noted, and samples were then chosen and collected to maximize the completeness of fire dates within the area in question (Swetnam and Baisan, 2003).|$|R
30|$|<b>Fire</b> <b>scars</b> are {{a primary}} source of {{information}} for documenting the historic fire regimes. Several studies in Yosemite have determined that fires were frequent {{in the past but}} decreased sharply after the mid- 1800 s, coinciding with Euro-American settlement of the Yosemite region. Swetnam (1993) reported <b>fire</b> <b>scar</b> records in five giant sequoia groves located from Yosemite to Sequoia National Park that confirmed the presence of fire in the Sierra Nevada for the past 3, 000 years. Between 1300 and the mid- 1800 s, intervals free of <b>fire</b> <b>scars</b> ranged from less than 13 yr during dry periods to between 15 yr and 30 yr during cool periods. Swetnam et al. (2000) examined <b>fire</b> <b>scars</b> in the southwestern part of Yosemite along a transect from 1, 090 m to 2, 425 m. They found that mean fire return intervals for fires recorded by 25 % or more of the fire-scarred trees ranged from 4.94 yr in ponderosa pine at the lowest elevation to 10.57 yr in Jeffrey pine at the highest. Swetnam et al. (2000) also found that 55 % of the <b>fire</b> <b>scars</b> occurred in the latewood part of the tree ring, indicating that these fires burned between July and early October. An additional 21 % occurred between June and July and 17 % between mid-September and December.|$|R

30|$|<b>Fire</b> <b>scars</b> were {{identified}} {{by the presence of}} callus tissue, charcoal, barrier zones, and cambial injury (Figure 3). <b>Fire</b> <b>scar</b> dates were assigned to the year and, where possible, season of response to cambial injury (Smith and Sutherland 1999). We used FHX 2 software (Grissino-Mayer 2001) to construct the fire chronology, analyze <b>fire</b> <b>scar</b> years, and graph individual tree and composite <b>fire</b> intervals. <b>Fire</b> <b>scar</b> intervals were summarized for a pre- and post- 1901 period associated with transition to Euro-American settlement of the region. Mean and median fire intervals and descriptive statistics were computed for both the composite and individual trees. Kolmogorov-Smirnov Goodness-of-Fit (K-S) tests were used to determine whether a Weibull distribution described the fire interval data better than a normal distribution. A t-test of sample means (α = 0.05) was conducted to determine whether fire intervals were significantly different between the pre- and post-Euro-American settlement periods. Fire severity was defined as the percentage of trees <b>scarred</b> in <b>fire</b> events where sample depth was at least three trees.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{potential}} for utilizing multi-frequency, quad-polarized Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) for delineation of <b>fire</b> <b>scars</b> in the tropical savannas of northern Australia.

Thus, the ability to accurately map <b>fire</b> <b>scars</b> and assess impacts on the mosaic of vegetation community types is crucial for effective landscape management. In this study identification of a <b>fire</b> <b>scar</b> resulting from a late dry season fire was assessed using TopSAR data. The assessment was achieved through comparison with optical datasets acquired both pre-burn and post-burn. By examining five representative vegetation communities, it was concluded that only C-band SAR data were affected sufficiently by fire in this environment to detect and map <b>fire</b> <b>scars.</b> Despite the intensity of the fire event, the resistance of vegetation communities to fire damage resulted in insignificant changes to the L- and P-band SAR data. Further investigation is required to determine if this behaviour can be exploited to improve the above-ground woody biomass mapping currently reliant on optical data...|$|R
30|$|Fire-scarred slabs were sanded {{to a high}} polish, then cross-dated {{against a}} master {{chronology}} using standard dendrochronological techniques to assign calendar years to <b>fire</b> <b>scars</b> (specific methodology was as explained in Brown and Wu 2005). Except when confined by the <b>fire</b> <b>scar</b> study area boundary, we mapped the spatial extent of <b>fires</b> recorded by <b>scars</b> within our study area by constructing a convex hull polygon around trees (3 minimum) that recorded a particular fire (Bekker and Taylor 2001). While a complete census of all fire-scarred trees would be optimal for the most accurate reconstruction of fire extent, doing so would be infeasible due to the effort required and destructive nature of sampling <b>fire</b> <b>scars.</b> Our relatively complete spatial coverage across the Illilouette and Sugarloaf study areas (Figure 1) allows us to make reasonable assertions on tree scarring patterns.|$|R

For the three most severe fire years, we assumed wind-driven fire events and plotted the bearing (degrees) of the <b>fire</b> <b>scars</b> on the tree boles in order to characterize the direction of <b>fire</b> movement. <b>Fire</b> <b>scars</b> were assigned a bearing that represented {{the direction of the}} middle of the arc of killed cambium.

40|$|<b>Fire</b> <b>scars</b> {{are well}} known to fire ecologists and dendrochronologists worldwide, and are used in dating fires and reconstructing the fire {{histories}} of modern forests.

The external features of the prehistoric scar match those of modern <b>fire</b> <b>scars</b> better than those of scars created by other kinds of wounding events. The fossil specimen also exhibits a number of changes in wood anatomy similar to those reported in modern fire-scarred trees, including a band of very small tracheids that indicate growth suppression immediately associated with the scarring event; an area with a tangential row of probable traumatic resin ducts; and a significant increase in tracheid size following the scarring event that indicates a growth release. No <b>fire</b> <b>scar</b> resembling those in modern trees has previously been described in petrified wood {{as far as we can}} determine.

We compared the <b>fire</b> <b>scar</b> results with independent, twentieth century fire atlas data to assess our interpretations.
