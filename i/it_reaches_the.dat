The train then begins a 270-degree climbing helix to the left, after which <b>it</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>the</b> ride's brake run {{and returns to}} the station.|$|E
5|$|At the Nyack line, NY59 becomes {{known as}} Main Street. As Main Street, NY59 runs under the Thruway one final {{time before the}} Thruway heads over the bridge. The route {{continues}} toward downtown Nyack; however, it ends at an intersection with US9W before <b>it</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>the</b> central district. Main Street continues for several blocks into downtown Nyack.|$|E
5|$|Heading past more homes, PA463 enters Montgomery Township at the Line Street intersection. <b>It</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>the</b> {{community}} of Montgomeryville, where PA 463 widens into a four-lane divided highway and intersects PA309 (Bethlehem Pike) and US202 Bus.

5|$|Passing beneath Lawrence {{and back}} over the East Don River, the {{expressway}} begins climbing out of the valley once more. <b>It</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>the</b> top of the valley and curves along a plateau before passing over York Mills Road. Residential sub-divisions are present along {{both sides of the}} road, isolated from the expressway by noise barriers, from north of Lawrence to the Highway401 interchange.|$|E
5|$|Speeches are given, {{formally}} {{opening the}} games.

5|$|The {{most notable}} {{topographical}} features are the Danubian Plain, the Balkan Mountains, the Thracian Plain, and the Rhodope Mountains. The {{southern edge of}} the Danubian Plain slopes upward into the foothills of the Balkans, while the Danube defines the border with Romania. The Thracian Plain is roughly triangular, beginning southeast of Sofia and broadening as <b>it</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>the</b> Black Sea coast.|$|E
50|$|The {{greatest}} {{achievement of}} the team to date has been in 1997, when <b>it</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> finals of the Colombian Championship, losing to América de Cali.

5|$|The north-west ridge {{continues}} from Lower Man over Browncove Crags, becoming almost insignificant when <b>it</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>the</b> shore of Thirlmere, yet still separating {{the valley of}} Helvellyn Gill from the reservoir, before finally rising again to the wooded height of Great How at its terminus.|$|E
5|$|The {{penetration}} front propagates {{to minimize}} the surface energy until <b>it</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>the</b> edges of the drop, thus arriving at the Wenzel state. Since the solid can be considered an absorptive material due to its surface roughness, this phenomenon of spreading and imbibition is called hemiwicking. The contact angles at which spreading/imbibition occurs are between 0 and π/2.|$|E
5|$|There is, however, {{one notable}} exception. In most implementations, COALESCE evaluates its {{parameters}} until <b>it</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>the</b> first non-NULL one, while NVL evaluates {{all of its}} parameters. This is important for several reasons. A parameter after the first non-NULL parameter could be a function, which could either be computationally expensive, invalid, or could create unexpected side effects.|$|E

5|$|After heading east {{past the}} {{junction}} with I-69, the highway turns southeast as it heads through rural fields toward Eaton Rapids. Once <b>it</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>the</b> city, M-50 converges with M-99, {{and the two}} intersect M-188 {{on the south side}} of the Grand River. The two highways run south out of the city. Immediately prior to entering Jackson County, the two trunklines diverge with M-99 heading off to the southwest and M-50 to the southeast.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} skull, the cranial {{component}} detaches from the spinal component. The spinal accessory nerve continues alone and heads backwards and downwards. In the neck, the accessory nerve crosses the internal jugular vein around {{the level of}} the posterior belly of digastric muscle. As it courses downwards, the nerve pierces through the sternocleidomastoid muscle while sending it motor branches, then continues down until <b>it</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>the</b> trapezius muscle to provide motor innervation to its upper part.|$|E
5|$|After {{the artistic}} {{portion of the}} ceremony, the athletes parade into the stadium grouped by nation. The last hosting nation is {{traditionally}} the first nation to enter. Nations then enter the stadium alphabetical or continental wise with the host country's athletes being the last to enter. Speeches are given, formally opening the Games. Finally, the Queen's Baton is brought into the stadium and passed on until <b>it</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>the</b> final baton carrier, often a successful Commonwealth athlete from the host nation, who hands {{it over to the}} Head of the Commonwealth.|$|E

5|$|Approaching Harrisburg, the Pennsylvania Turnpike heads east {{through a}} mixture of rural land and {{suburban}} development. In Upper Allen Township, the highway reaches the US15 interchange accessing Gettysburg to the south. The road continues east into York County, where <b>it</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>the</b> interchange with I-83 serving Harrisburg, its western suburbs and York to the south. East of I-83 it widens to six lanes, crossing the Susquehanna River into Dauphin County on the Susquehanna River Bridge and bypassing Harrisburg to the south.|$|E

The Americans stand down their forces.|$|E
5|$|If a {{white dwarf}} were {{to exceed the}} Chandrasekhar limit, and nuclear {{reactions}} did not take place, the pressure exerted by electrons {{would no longer be}} able to balance the force of gravity, and it would collapse into a denser object called a neutron star. Carbon-oxygen white dwarfs accreting mass from a neighboring star undergo a runaway nuclear fusion reaction, which leads to a Type Ia supernova explosion in which the white dwarf may be destroyed, before <b>it</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>the</b> limiting mass.|$|E

5|$|NY17A begins {{just south}} of NY17 exit124 {{in the village of}} Goshen. At the traffic light with the {{southern}} on-ramp from NY17 eastbound, NY207 becomes NY17A. The route quickly climbs to some of the hillier areas south of Goshen, offering views of not only Orange County's Black Dirt Region but Pochuck Mountain and High Point to the south in New Jersey. It then slowly descends past rolling meadows and farmland until <b>it</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>the</b> small village of Florida, where NY94 comes in from the west shortly after the village border.

5|$|Of the subspecies, the black-faced impala is {{significantly}} larger and {{darker than the}} common impala; melanism {{is responsible for the}} black colouration. Distinctive of the black-faced impala is a dark stripe, {{on either side of the}} nose, that runs upward to the eyes and thins as <b>it</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>the</b> forehead. Other differences include the larger black tip on the ear, and a bushier and nearly 30% longer tail in the black-faced impala.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the race}} was {{abandoned}} after twelve total laps, it did not reach official status; IndyCar does not consider a race official unless <b>it</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>the</b> halfway mark. As such, no points were awarded and the series championship went to Franchitti by default. If the race had continued and reached official status, Franchitti {{would have been the}} series champion anyway as he had avoided the accident. Power's car, meanwhile, was heavily damaged in the lap 11 crash {{to the point where he}} would not have been able to continue racing.|$|E
