Brian Aldiss admired {{the film as}} well: [...] "I thought what an inventive, intriguing, ingenious, {{involving}} film this was. There are flaws in it and I suppose <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> personal quibble but it's so long since I wrote it." [...] Of the film's ending, he wondered how {{it might have been}} had Kubrick directed the film: [...] "That is one of the 'ifs' of film history—at least the ending indicates Spielberg adding some sugar to Kubrick's wine. The actual ending is overly sympathetic and moreover rather overtly engineered by a plot device that does not really bear credence. But it's a brilliant piece of film and of course it's a phenomenon because it contains the energies and talents of two brilliant filmmakers." [...] Richard Corliss heavily praised Spielberg's direction, as well as the cast and visual effects. Roger Ebert gave the film four stars, saying that it was [...] "wonderful and maddening." [...] Leonard Maltin, on the other hand, gives the film two stars out of four in his Movie Guide, writing: [...] " [...] intriguing story draws us in, thanks in part to Osment's exceptional performance, but takes several wrong turns; ultimately, it just doesn't work. Spielberg rewrote the adaptation Stanley Kubrick commissioned of the Brian Aldiss short story 'Super Toys Last All Summer Long'; [...] result is a curious and uncomfortable hybrid of Kubrick and Spielberg sensibilities." [...] However, he calls John Williams' music score [...] "striking". Jonathan Rosenbaum compared A.I. to Solaris (1972), and praised both [...] "Kubrick for proposing that Spielberg direct the project and Spielberg for doing his utmost to respect Kubrick's intentions while making it a profoundly personal work." [...] Film critic Armond White, of the New York Press, praised the film noting that [...] "each part of David’s journey through carnal and sexual universes into the final eschatological devastation becomes as profoundly philosophical and contemplative as anything by cinema’s most thoughtful, speculative artists– Borzage, Ozu, Demy, Tarkovsky." [...] Filmmaker Billy Wilder hailed A.I. as [...] "the most underrated film of the past few years." [...] When British filmmaker Ken Russell saw the film, he wept during the ending.|$|E
500|$|Casting {{announcements}} {{began in}} June 2009 when Noah Wyle was announced as the lead. Wyle, {{who worked with}} TNT on the Librarian films, was sent scripts for various shows on their network. He said {{part of the reason}} he chose the part was to gain credibility from his children. [...] "With the birth of my kids, I started to really look at my career through their eyes more than my own, so that does dictate choice, steering me toward certain things and away from other things," [...] he said. He also decided to do it as he could relate with his character, stating [...] "I identified with Tom's devotion to his sons, and admired his sense of social duty." [...] Spielberg wanted Wyle for the role because he knew him from his previous series ER, which Spielberg's company produced. He had wanted Wyle to appear in his 1998 film Saving Private Ryan but due to scheduling conflicts, he was unable to star. Spielberg stated that he was determined to work with him again. In July 2009, Moon Bloodgood, Jessy Schram, Seychelle Gabriel and Maxim Knight were cast as Anne Glass, Karen Nadler, Lourdes and Matt Mason, respectively. Bloodgood, the female lead, did not have to audition for the role. She received the script and was offered the role. Bloodgood was drawn to the role because of Spielberg and Rodat's involvement. She stated: [...] "Well certainly when you get handed a script and they tell you it’s Bob Rodat and Steven Spielberg, you’re immediately drawn to it. It’s got your attention. I was a little cautious about wanting to do science fiction again. But {{it was more of a}} drama story, more of a family story. I liked that and I wanted to work with Spielberg." [...] Bloodgood added that portraying a doctor excited her. [...] "I liked the idea of playing a doctor and deviating from something I had done already," [...] she said. In August 2009, Drew Roy and Peter Shinkoda were cast as Hal Mason and Dai, respectively. Drew Roy's agent received the script and the pair joked that Roy might get the role. [...] "This one came to me through my agent, just like everything else. We even joked about the fact that it was a Steven Spielberg project. We were like, [...] "Oh yeah, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> chance." [...] We were just joking." [...] He auditioned four times for the part. [...] "The whole process went on for quite some time, and then towards the end, it was down to me and one other guy, and we were literally waiting for the word from Steven Spielberg ‘cause he had to watch the two audition tapes and give the okay. That, in and of itself, had me like, [...] "Okay, even if I don’t get it, that’s just cool." [...] Fortunately, it went my way." ...|$|E
