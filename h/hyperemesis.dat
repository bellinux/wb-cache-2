5|$|In {{addition}} to death occurring in pregnancy and childbirth, pregnancy {{can result in}} many non-fatal health problems including obstetrical fistulae, ectopic pregnancy, preterm labor, gestational diabetes, <b>hyperemesis</b> gravidarum, hypertensive states including preeclampsia, and anemia. Globally, complications of pregnancy vastly outway maternal deaths, with an estimated 9.5 million cases of pregnancy-related illness and 1.4 million near-misses (survival from severe life-threatening complications). Complications of pregnancy may be physical, mental, economic and social. It is estimated that 10–20 million women will develop physical or mental disability every year, resulting from complications of pregnancy or inadequate care. Consequently, international agencies have developed standards for obstetric care.|$|E
25|$|Women {{experiencing}} <b>hyperemesis</b> gravidarum {{often are}} dehydrated and lose weight despite efforts to eat. The {{onset of the}} nausea and vomiting in <b>hyperemesis</b> gravidarum is typically before the twenty-second week of pregnancy.|$|E

25|$|Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, was hospitalised due to <b>hyperemesis</b> gravidarum {{during her}} first pregnancy, and was treated for a similar {{condition}} during the subsequent two.|$|E
25|$|Ondansetron is used off-label {{to treat}} morning {{sickness}} and <b>hyperemesis</b> gravidarum of pregnancy. It is typically used after trials of other drugs have failed.|$|E
25|$|Vomiting is {{a common}} {{condition}} affecting about 50% of pregnant women, with another 25% having nausea. However, the incidence of HG is only 0.3–1.5%. After preterm labor, <b>hyperemesis</b> gravidarum {{is the second most}} common reason for hospital admission {{during the first half of}} pregnancy. Factors such as infection with Helicobacter pylori, a rise in thyroid hormone production, low age, low body mass index prior to pregnancy, multiple pregnancies, molar pregnancies, and a past history of <b>hyperemesis</b> gravidarum have been associated with the development of HG.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hyperemesis</b> gravidarum is {{considered}} a diagnosis of exclusion. HG {{can be associated with}} serious problems in the mother or baby, such as Wernicke's encephalopathy, coagulopathy, peripheral neuropathy.|$|E
25|$|The Duchess's third {{pregnancy}} was announced on 4 September 2017. She was again forced to cancel engagements due to <b>hyperemesis</b> gravidarum. The child {{is due in}} April 2018.|$|E
25|$|Author Charlotte Brontë {{is often}} {{thought to have}} {{suffered}} from <b>hyperemesis</b> gravidarum. She died in 1855 while four months pregnant, having been afflicted by intractable nausea and vomiting throughout her pregnancy, {{and was unable to}} tolerate food or even water.|$|E
25|$|Preeclampsia {{refers to}} {{abnormal}} placental growth {{which can cause}} multiple problems including preterm labor, polyhydramnios, <b>hyperemesis</b> gravidarum, and fetal-maternal hemorrhage. Preeclampsia is the most prevalent pregnancy complication and predominant cause of premature birth, occurring at 2-5% of pregnancies in first world countries and 10% in developing countries.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} antiemetics are {{effective}} and safe in pregnancy including: pyridoxine/doxylamine, antihistamines (such as diphenhydramine), and phenothiazines (such as promethazine). With respect to effectiveness, {{it is unknown}} if one is superior to another for improving nausea or vomiting. Limited evidence from published clinical trials suggests the use of medications to treat <b>hyperemesis</b> gravidarum.|$|E
25|$|Not only is obesity {{associated}} with miscarriage, it {{can result in}} sub-fertility and other adverse pregnancy outcomes. Recurrent miscarriage is also related to obesity. Women with bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa may have a greater risk for miscarriage. Nutrient deficiencies have not been found to impact miscarriage rates but <b>hyperemesis</b> gravidarum sometimes precedes a miscarriage.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hyperemesis</b> gravidarum (HG) is a {{pregnancy}} complication that {{is characterized by}} severe nausea, vomiting, weight loss, and possibly dehydration. Signs and symptoms may also include vomiting {{several times a day}} and feeling faint. Hypremesis gravidarum is considered more severe than morning sickness. Often symptoms get better after the 20th week of pregnancy but may last the entire pregnancy duration.|$|E
25|$|On 3 December 2012, St James's Palace {{announced}} that the Duchess was pregnant with her first child. The announcement was made earlier in the pregnancy than is usual {{as she had been}} admitted to King Edward VII's Hospital suffering from <b>hyperemesis</b> gravidarum, a severe form of morning sickness. She stayed in hospital for three days. On 14 January 2013, St James's Palace {{announced that}} the child was due to be born in July 2013, and that the condition of the Duchess was improving.|$|E
25|$|Ondansetron may be beneficial, however, {{there are}} some {{concerns}} regarding an association with cleft palate, {{and there is little}} high-quality data. Metoclopramide is also used and relatively well tolerated. Evidence for the use of corticosteroids is weak; {{there is some evidence that}} corticosteroid use in pregnant women may slightly increase the risk of oral facial clefts in the infant and may suppress fetal adrenal activity. However, hydrocortisone and prednisolone are inactivated in the placenta and may be used in the treatment of <b>hyperemesis</b> gravidarum after 12 weeks.|$|E
25|$|In December 2012, two Australian radio hosts, Michael Christian and Mel Greig, called King Edward VII's Hospital Sister Agnes {{where the}} Duchess was an {{in-patient}} for <b>hyperemesis</b> gravidarum. Pretending {{to be the}} Queen and the Prince of Wales, Greig and Christian telephoned the hospital and spoke to a nurse on the Duchess's ward, enquiring about her condition. Following a hospital inquiry and a public backlash against the hoax, the nurse who put the call through to the ward, Jacintha Saldanha, committed suicide. The radio hosts subsequently apologised for their actions.|$|E
25|$|The {{symptoms}} and discomforts of pregnancy are those presentations and conditions {{that result from}} pregnancy but do not significantly interfere with {{activities of daily living}} or pose a threat {{to the health of the}} mother or baby. This is in contrast to pregnancy complications. Sometimes a symptom that is considered a discomfort can be considered a complication when it is more severe. For example, nausea (morning sickness) can be a discomfort, but if, in combination with significant vomiting it causes a water-electrolyte imbalance, it is a complication known as <b>hyperemesis</b> gravidarum.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Hyperemesis</b> gravidarum is {{from the}} Greek hyper-, meaning excessive, and emesis, meaning vomiting, and the Latin gravidarum, the {{feminine}} genitive plural form of an adjective, here used as a noun, meaning [...] "pregnant [...] ". Therefore, <b>hyperemesis</b> gravidarum means [...] "excessive vomiting of pregnant women".|$|E
2500|$|The {{effects of}} HG on the fetus are mainly due to {{electrolyte}} imbalances caused by HG in the mother. [...] Infants {{of women with}} severe <b>hyperemesis</b> who gain less than 7kg (15.4lb) during pregnancy tend to be of lower birth weight, small for gestational age, and born before 37 weeks gestation. In contrast, infants of women with <b>hyperemesis</b> who have a pregnancy weight gain of more than 7kg appear similar to infants from uncomplicated pregnancies. There is {{no significant difference in}} the neonatal death rate in infants born to mothers with HG compared to infants born to mothers who do not have HG. Children born to mothers with undertreated <b>Hyperemesis</b> have a fourfold increase in neurobehavioral diagnoses.|$|E
2500|$|The Duchess's second {{pregnancy}} was announced on 8 September 2014. As {{with her first}} pregnancy, the Duchess suffered from <b>hyperemesis</b> gravidarum and was required to cancel official engagements. On 2 May 2015, the Duchess gave birth to Princess Charlotte.|$|E
2500|$|Caffeine from {{coffee or}} other {{beverages}} is {{absorbed by the}} small intestine within 45 minutes of ingestion and distributed throughout all bodily tissues. Peak blood concentration is reached within 1–2hours. It is eliminated by first-order kinetics. Caffeine can also be absorbed rectally, evidenced by suppositories of ergotamine tartrate and caffeine (for the relief of migraine) and chlorobutanol and caffeine (for the treatment of <b>hyperemesis).</b> However, rectal absorption is less efficient than oral: [...] the maximum concentration (Cmax) and total amount absorbed (AUC) are both about 30% (i.e. 1/3.5) of the oral amounts.|$|E
2500|$|The {{feeling of}} {{increased}} appetite following {{the use of}} cannabis has been documented for hundreds of years, and is known colloquially as [...] "the munchies" [...] in the English-speaking world. Clinical studies and survey data have found that cannabis increases food enjoyment and interest in food. Scientists have claimed {{to be able to}} explain what causes the increase in appetite, concluding that [...] "endocannabinoids in the hypothalamus activate cannabinoid receptors that are responsible for maintaining food intake". Rarely, chronic users experience a severe vomiting disorder, cannabinoid <b>hyperemesis</b> syndrome, after smoking and find relief by taking hot baths.|$|E

[...] On 4 December, at about 5:30 am London time (GMT) or 4:30 pm Sydney time (AEST), the hosts of the Hot30 Countdown radio programme, Mel Greig and Mike Christian, called the hospital and spoke to Saldanha. Impersonating Elizabeth II, Greig said: [...] "Oh hello there, could I please speak to Kate please, my granddaughter." [...] Saldanha responded, [...] "Oh yes. Hold on," [...] and transferred the call to the Duchess's nurse, who spent approximately two minutes speaking with Greig as well as Christian, the latter impersonating Prince Charles.
