500|$|Capoeira is an Afro-Brazilian martial art, {{described}} by Pabon as [...] "a form of self defense {{disguised as a}} dance." [...] Its influence on breaking is disputed and debated; one side believes that breaking came from capoeira, while the other side denies this. Capoeira is hundreds of years older than breaking, and uprock is similar in purpose to capoeira in that both translate aggressive combat movements into stylized dance. Both breaking and capoeira are performed to music and, since both art forms are acrobatic, some moves look similar to each other. However, capoeira is more rule-oriented. One rule in capoeira is that a capoeirista's back can never touch the ground. In contrast, a breaker's back is almost always on the ground, and the only rule in breaking <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not touch your opponent during a battle.|$|E
2500|$|An atheist bus {{campaign}} {{promoted by}} the Italian Union of Rationalist Atheists and Agnostics (UAAR) was due to start on 4 February 2009 in Genoa. The city was chosen {{on the occasion of}} the nomination of its archbishop, Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco, as president of the Italian Episcopal Conference (CEI). The slogan of the Italian campaign reads [...] "La cattiva notizia è che Dio non esiste. Quella buona è che non ne hai bisogno", meaning [...] "The bad news is that God does not exist.

6000|$|... "How know <b>you</b> <b>that,</b> Seth Jepson, {{unless it}} <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> play us false, {{and how was}} it you {{returned}} in company with the Britishers?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] Deane answered. [...] "The {{only thing}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not do enough. I am {{perfectly}} convinced, Hardaway, that that {{man did not}} go there {{with the intention of}} murdering Sinclair." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, {{you shall}} not go, Olaf, {{at least not}} yet. My orders <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not fall upon your sword. As for this Egyptian witch, well, {{presently}} my people will be here; then we will see." ...|$|R
60|$|CONJURER. Well, {{the whole}} point of being a {{journalist}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> explain a thing that hasn't happened.|$|E
6000|$|... "What <b>is</b> <b>that?</b> <b>You</b> <b>do</b> {{not know}} {{anything}} about the big snowball that just came hurtling down these stairs?" [...] stormed Professor Duke.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he at last returned, [...] "I know. But the {{marvel to}} me <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> I've no right in fact to imagine or {{to assume that}} you do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, how thankful I <b>am</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> {{not attempt}} to go around that corner!" [...] came from Laura. [...] "If <b>you</b> had tried <b>that</b> {{we would have been}} upset and maybe all killed!" [...] and she shuddered.|$|R
6000|$|The slave {{girl looked}} at her in surprise. [...] "It cannot <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not know!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "Why, they are--" [...] but she got no further. The door swung open and an officer stood before them.|$|R

6000|$|... "If {{you wish}} the necklace, Augusta, {{you must take}} the head as well; and my counsel to you <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> neither, since they will bring you no good luck." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{tell me what}} it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> do," [...] said Mr. Anderson, with a {{convenient}} whisper, when he found that M. Grascour had fallen into conversation with her ladyship. [...] "Lawn-tennis?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course there}} are ample reasons," [...] said Ralph, looking into his hat, which he had taken from the table. [...] "The one,--most ample of all, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not care for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am satisfied, Mr Hatton." [...] said Sir Vavasour: [...] "let no time be lost. All I regret <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> {{not mention}} {{all this to}} me before; and then we might have saved {{a great deal of}} trouble and expence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{have met}} before, nevertheless, Lady," [...] Oswald said, with a smile; [...] "though {{it may well}} <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not {{remember}} my face, or that of my squire there; seeing <b>that</b> we <b>were</b> together but a few minutes, {{and that in the}} moonlight." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Open, Stephanus," [...] said Marcus, {{in a tone}} of command, at {{the same}} time pushing the door wide and entering. [...] "Fool," [...] he added, [...] "what kind of a steward <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not know your master's voice?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Prince," [...] said Penelope, [...] "there is {{one thing}} I have learned about you this evening, and that <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not love questions. And yet {{there is one other}} which I should like to ask you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Micawber,' she returned, 'no! Your {{mistake in}} life <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not look forward far enough.

6000|$|... "From {{the first}} time I saw you, Hazel," [...] he said, [...] "I have loved you. I am willing to wait, for I am certain that so great and pure a love as mine will be rewarded. All that I care to know <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not love another. Will you tell me?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "My dearest," [...] he said presently, [...] "what a {{happy life}} ours will <b>be.</b> <b>That</b> <b>is,</b> if <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not find <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have made a mistake." ...|$|R

60|$|SHAKESPEAR. You {{are here}} to inspire them, madam. For this, among the rest, were you ordained. But the boon I crave <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> endow a great playhouse, or, if I may make bold to coin a {{scholarly}} name for it, a National Theatre, for the better instruction and gracing of your Majesty's subjects.|$|E
6000|$|... "To observe {{with me is}} at once a {{task and}} an amusement, and the habit is one that leads me to {{accurate}} conclusions, as I think you will admit. The conclusion I have come to in your case <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not wish to see Arthur Heigham married to another woman. I spoke just now of assistance----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We gain nothing by {{discussing}} the matter," [...] said Maenck shortly. [...] "You are Leopold of Lutha. Prince Peter {{says that you}} are mad. All that concerns me <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not escape again, and you may rest assured that while Ernst Maenck is governor of Blentz you shall not escape and go at large again.|$|E
6000|$|... "What <b>is</b> there <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not know?" [...] cried {{they all}} at once. And Torfrida {{actually}} showed herself a fair practical engineer.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{of immense}} interest, also, to me," [...] Selingman interrupted. [...] "It may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> {{not know this}} at present. It may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> I anticipate, but if so, no matter. Between you and your fiancée there will {{naturally}} be no secrets.

6000|$|... "Arabella," [...] {{said the}} mother, [...] "it <b>is</b> clear <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not {{look into the}} future. How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> mean to live? You are getting old." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why not? You {{are well}} {{able to do}} so. The more since you have heard two sides. For my godfather would tell you the truth. If you cannot judge, it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not wish to judge." [...] His tone became harsh. [...] "Wilfully {{you close your eyes}} to justice that might check the course of your unhealthy, unnatural ambition." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good--it {{is always}} well to be {{particular}} under oath. Now, Signor Podestà, {{the result of}} all your evidence <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> {{not know that the}} felucca you mention was le Feu-Follet, that I am a Frenchman even, much less that I am Raoul Yvard, and that I told you that I was from Guernsey, and that my name was Jacques Smeet--is it not so?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pooh!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "Fancy {{asking a}} woman to be reasonable! Don't you realise, you stupid man, {{that if you were}} at liberty to tell {{everybody}} what it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> there, well, then I should have no more interest in it? It is just because you say that you will not and you may not tell, that, womanlike, I am curious." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I <b>am</b> afraid <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not {{thank me}} for having brought you to any place so unfit for a gentleman,' said Tregarva, seeing Lancelot's sad face.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Only stupid people, {{who have}} no {{perception}} of a joke,' said Elizabeth; 'he never deceived me with any joke; it <b>is</b> only <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not understand.' ...|$|R
