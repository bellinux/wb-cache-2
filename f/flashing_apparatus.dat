50|$|His colleague's {{interest}} in the new <b>flash</b> <b>apparatus</b> soon provoked Edgerton to improve upon the design. The mercury lamp's efficiency was limited by the coolest part of the lamp, causing them to perform better when very hot but poorly when cold. Edgerton decided to try a noble gas instead, feeling {{that it would not}} be as temperature dependent as mercury, and, in 1930, he employed the General Electric company to construct some lamps using argon instead. The argon tubes were much more efficient, were much smaller, and could be mounted near a reflector, concentrating their output. Slowly, camera designers began to take notice of the new technology and began to accept it. Edgerton received his first major order for the strobes from the Kodak company in 1940. Afterward, he discovered that xenon was the most efficient of the noble gases, producing a spectrum very close to that of daylight, and xenon flashtubes became standard in most large photography sets. It was not until the 1970s that strobe units became portable enough to use in common cameras.|$|R

The experiments {{were performed}} using exfoliated graphite nanoparticle fibers suspended in polyalphaolefin atmass concentrations of 0. 6 and 0. 3 %. The experimental setup consisted of a test section containing a plain offsetfin cooler apparatus (gap or nongap fin), whichwas connected to a flow loop consisting of a gear pump, a shell and tube heat exchanger (that was cooled or heated by a constant temperature bath chiller/heater), and a reservoir. Experiments were conducted using nanofluid and polyalphaolefin for two different fin strip layouts. Heat transfer data were obtained by parametrically varying the operating conditions (heat flux and flow rates). The heat transfer data for nanofluids were compared with the heat transfer data for neat polyalphaolefin fluid under similar conditions. The change in surfacemorphology of the finswas investigated using scanning electronmicrography. The nanofluid properties were measured using rheometry for the viscosity, differential scanning calorimetry for the specific heat, and laser <b>flash</b> <b>apparatus</b> for the thermal diffusivity.

40|$|Fast {{scanning}} chip-calorimetry {{was used}} to explore the crystallisation and melting of three semi-crystalline polymers. The heating and cooling rates required to prevent crystallisation on cooling (from above Tm) and on re-heating (from below T_g) were determined as: 3, 000 and 8, 000 ËšC/s respectively in PCL, 75 and 250 ËšC/s respectively in PEEK and 10 and 100 ËšC/s respectively in PLA. The effect of the thermal lag was considered using indium as a standard and corrections of > 5 ËšC were required at rates in excess of 5, 000 ËšC/s. As readily observed in conventional DSC (CDSC), PEEK exhibited a double melting endotherm and this was attributed to a melting-recrystallisation-melting process. The absence of recrystallisation above 250 ËšC allowed a Hoffman-Weeks analysis {{to be carried out}} over a broader temperature range than is general possible in CDSC. The interplay between thermal lag and re-crystallisation was analysed using heating rates covering 5 orders of magnitude. At an optimum heating rate of 1, 500 ËšC/s, an equilibrium melting temperature of 359 ËšC was determined. The consideration of thermal lag led to the measurement of diffusivity using the technique of laser <b>flash</b> <b>apparatus</b> (LFA). The high measurement speed in the LFA allowed a time and temperature resolved study of diffusivity in PLA.

These included depth, sources of freshwater inflow and pollution, bottom characteristics, current direction and speed, surface and bottom temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen, and water clarity was estimated with a secchi disk. Seagrass blades and macroalgae were counted in a 0. 1 -m 2 grid placed so as to best represent the bottom community within a 50 -foot radius.

40|$|World {{energy crisis}} has {{triggered}} {{more attention to}} energy saving and energy conversion systems with high efficiency. There is a growing awareness that nanoscience and nanotechnology can have {{a profound impact on}} energy generation, conversion, and recovery. Nanotechnology-based solutions are being developed {{for a wide range of}} energy problems such as, solar electricity, hydrogen generation and storage, batteries, fuel cells, heat pumps and thermoelectrics. This thesis deals with the design and fabrication of novel functional materials/architectures for energy-related applications. The study includes two parts: Nanostructured thermoelectric (TE) materials for energy conversion and nanostructured metallic surfaces for energy heat transfer. In the first part, the focus is given to the fabrication of novel nanostructured TE materials and architectures. TE materials are very important functional materials that can convert heat to electrical energy and vice versa. Recently, nanostructuring TE materials showed very promising potential to improve their TE figure of merit which opens a new venue for the TE world. As a result, some advanced nanostructured TE architectures are proposed as the state-of-the-art TE materials/structures. Among these advanced TE architectures, bismuth telluride nanowires/thick films and skutterudite nanocomposites with nanoinclusions have been successfully fabricated and some of their advantageous TE performance has been demonstrated. For example, an improvement of 11 % on the figure of merit, ZT, was achieved in the CoSb 3 nanocomposite with 5 mole% ZrO 2 as nanoinclusion. Comprehensive physico-chemical characterization techniques have been used for the synthesized TE materials. The potential-Seebeck microprobe, 4 -point probe and laser <b>flash</b> <b>apparatus</b> have been used for the measurement of TE parameters on the TE materials. In the second part of the thesis, we developed a nanostructured macro-porous (NMp) surface for enhancing heat transfer in boiling process. Enhanced surfaces for boiling improve the energy efficiency of heat pumping equipment such as air conditioners, refrigerators, etc. Conventional techniques currently used for fabricating enhanced surfaces are often based on the use of complicated mechanical machine tools and require a large consumption of materials and give only limited enhancement of the boiling heat transfer. In this thesis, we present a new approach to fabricate enhanced surfaces by using electrodeposition under specific conditions forming in-situ dynamic gas bubble templates. As a result, the NMp metallic surface layer comprising of dendritically ordered copper branches is obtained. Since the structure is formed during the evolution of the dynamic bubbles, it is ideal for the bubble generation applications such as boiling. The efficiency of the NMp surfaces for boiling heat transfer was evaluated in pool boiling experiments. At the heat flux of 1 W/cm 2, the heat transfer coefficient for the NMp surface is found to be more than 17 times higher than the reference surface. It's estimated that such an effective boiling surface would improve the energy efficiency of many heat pumping machines with 10 - 30 %. The extraordinary enhancement of boiling performance is explained by the structure characteristics, which assist in enhancing nucleation of the gas bubbles, subsequent coalescence, and facilitated departure from the surfaces.

5000|$|The Cleveland open-cup {{method is}} one of three main methods in {{chemistry}} for determining the flash point of a petroleum product using a Cleveland open-cup apparatus, also known as a Cleveland open-cup tester. [...] First, the test cup of the apparatus (usually brass) is filled to a certain level with a portion of the product. Then, the temperature of this chemical is increased rapidly and then at a slow, constant rate as it approaches the theoretical flash point. The increase in temperature will cause the chemical to begin to produce flammable vapor in increasing quantities and density. The lowest temperature at which a small test flame passing over the surface of the liquid causes the vapor to ignite is considered the chemical's <b>flash</b> point. This <b>apparatus</b> may also be used to determine the chemical's fire point which is considered to have been reached when the application of the test flame produces at least five continuous seconds of ignition.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} studies of {{nano-scale}} materials in electronic packaging applications {{with respect to}} following aspects: surface analysis of nano-scale oxide of lead-free solder particles, and thermal performance and mechanical property studies of nano-scale fiber and metal composite-based thermal interface materials. The composition and thickness of the solder oxide have {{a direct impact on}} the quality of interconnects and the reliability of a packaged system. The characterization of the nano-scale oxide of lead-free solder particles is investigated by transmission electron microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy. The solder powders are exposed to air at 150 oC for 0, 120 and 240 h. The oxide thickness is 6 nm and 50 nm measured by STEM for 0 h and 120 h samples, respectively. The increase in oxide thickness of solder particles is proportional to the rooting of the oxidation time. The intersection analysis method for analyzing Auger electron spectroscopy depth profiles is also presented which could be expand to analyze oxide of other alloy, i. e. Cu, Ag or stainless steel. In the next part of this thesis, a new composite design consisting of electrospun polyimide fiber networks and infiltrated metal matrix is presented. Three composites are fabricated including polyimide fiber-InSnBi, polyimide fiber-indium and polyimide fiber-SnAgCu composites. The microstructure of the composite is investigated by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray detector and X-ray diffraction, showing a good bonding between the fibers and the metal matrix. These composites demonstrate high thermal conductivity, low thermal contact resistance and reliable thermomechanical performance during thermal cycling. The polyimide fiber-indium composites are sandwiched between chips and heat spreaders with different packaged sizes to detect the junction temperature and junction-to-case thermal resistance. The shear strength of the polyimide fiber-indium composite between Sn surfaces can reach 4 MPa which is larger than that with Au and Cu surfaces. Both composites present good reliability during the humidity-heat aging tests. The polyimide fiber-indium compositeâ€™s ultimate tensile strength at 20 Â°C is five times higher than that of the pure indium, and the tensile strength of the composite exceeds the summation of those from its individual components. With the increase in temperature, the ultimate tensile strength declines but still precedes pure indium and the elongation at fracture increases. Contrary to most metallic materials, the ultimate tensile strength of the composite is inversely proportional to the logarithmic strain rate in a certain range. Finally, a new strengthening mechanism is presented based on mutually reinforcing structures formed by the indium and surrounding fibers, underlining the effect of compressing at the fiber-indium interfaces by dislocation pileups and slip pinning. The creep threshold of the composite corresponds to the fracture strength of the polyimide fiber, and the step-like sudden increases of the compositeâ€™s creep strain are due to the breakage of fibers. The fiber-indium interfaces are also beneficial to the compositeâ€™s creep resistance. In the final part of the thesis, two novel thermal interface materials are developed and characterized including boron nitride fiber-indium composite and carbon fiber-SnAgCu composite. Thermally conductive boron nitride fiber or carbon fiber is prepared via electrospinning and heat treatment. Afterward, the boron nitride/carbon fibers are sputtered with Ti/Au coatings and infiltrated with metal matrix. Good in-plane and through-plane thermal conductivity of the thermally conductive fiber-metal matrix composite are obtained using a laser <b>flash</b> <b>apparatus...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractRecently, ionic liquids were {{verified}} to be combustible {{instead of}} nonflammable; the contrary {{was thought to}} be true due their extremely low vapor pressure. Flash point {{is one of the most}} important variables used to characterize the fire and explosion hazards of liquids. Because of extremely low vapor pressure and decomposition at elevated temperatures, the reason for ionic liquids to be combustible should be different from that of traditionally defined liquids. The flash point of ionic liquids in relation to their decomposition was investigated in this study by the estimation of vapor pressure and by use of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and <b>flash</b> point analyzer <b>apparatus.</b> The ionic liquids 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium ethylsulfate ([Emim][EtSO 4]), 1 -hexyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride ([C 6 mim][Cl]) and 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide ([Bmim][NTf 2]), were selected as test examples. Results revealed that the flammability of ionic liquids was mainly attributed to the decomposition of the ionic liquids generating flammable substances instead of themselves vaporizing, as do traditionally defined combustible/flammable liquids...|$|R
