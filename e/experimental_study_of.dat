5|$|Tool use in orangutans was {{observed}} by primatologist Birutė Galdikas in ex-captive populations. In addition, evidence of sophisticated tool manufacture and {{use in the}} wild was reported from a population of orangutans in Suaq Balimbing (Pongo abelii) in 1996. These orangutans developed a tool kit for use in foraging that consisted of both insect-extraction tools {{for use in the}} hollows of trees and seed-extraction tools for harvesting seeds from hard-husked fruit. The orangutans adjusted their tools according {{to the nature of the}} task at hand, and preference was given to oral tool use. This preference was also found in an <b>experimental</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> captive orangutans (P. pygmaeus).|$|E

25|$|On {{his return}} from Russia, Bothe {{continued}} his employment at the PTR under Hans Geiger in the Laboratory for Radioactivity there. In 1924, Bothe published on his coincidence method. Then and in the following years, he applied this method to the <b>experimental</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> the nuclear reactions, the Compton effect, and the wave–particle duality of light. Bothe's coincidence method and his applications of it earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1954.|$|E
25|$|Since the <b>experimental</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> actual extreme pro-group acts raises large ethical red flags, {{researchers}} have largely focused on endorsements of extreme pro-group acts. Several {{studies have shown}} that fusion is a robust predictor of willingness to fight and die on behalf of one’s group. Other research has examined responses to variations of the trolley dilemma adapted for groups. In scenarios that pitted the desire for self-preservation against self-sacrifice for others, strongly fused persons were especially willing to endorse sacrificing their lives for fellow in-group members (but not for out-group members). Using a different approach, researchers examined group members’ reactions to significant group losses and found that highly identified individuals tend to detach themselves from the group following a group failure, whereas strongly fused persons predicted that they would “go down with the ship”. For example, in parallel studies of the 2008 presidential elections in Spain and the United States, people who were strongly fused with their political party internalized both victory and defeat, but highly identiﬁed persons internalized only victory. Additional field research with terrorist groups like ISIS and rebel groups is also beginning to shed light on the role identity fusion plays in extreme pro-group behaviors.|$|E

2500|$|In 1894 Morgan {{was granted}} a year's absence to conduct {{research}} in the laboratories of Stazione Zoologica in Naples, where Wilson had worked two years earlier. There he worked with German biologist Hans Driesch, whose research in the <b>experimental</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> development piqued Morgan's interest. Among other projects that year, Morgan completed an <b>experimental</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> ctenophore embryology. In Naples and through Loeb, he became familiar with the Entwicklungsmechanik (roughly, [...] "developmental mechanics") school of experimental biology. It was {{a reaction to the}} vitalistic Naturphilosophie, which was extremely influential in 19th-century morphology. Morgan changed his work from traditional, largely descriptive morphology to an experimental embryology that sought physical and chemical explanations for organismal development.|$|E
2500|$|Wolfgang Kohler, Max Wertheimer and Kurt Koffka co-founded {{the school}} of Gestalt {{psychology}} (not {{to be confused with}} the Gestalt therapy of Fritz Perls). This approach is based upon the idea that individuals experience things as unified wholes. Rather than breaking down thoughts and behavior into smaller elements, as in structuralism, the Gestaltists maintained that whole of experience is important, and differs from the sum of its parts. Other 19th-century contributors to the field include the German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus, a pioneer in the <b>experimental</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> memory, who developed quantitative models of learning and forgetting at the University of Berlin, and the Russian-Soviet physiologist Ivan Pavlov, who discovered in dogs a learning process that was later termed [...] "classical conditioning" [...] and applied to human beings.|$|E

2500|$|Doppler first {{proposed}} this effect in 1842 in his treatise [...] "Über das farbige Licht der Doppelsterne und einiger anderer Gestirne des Himmels" [...] (On the coloured {{light of the}} binary stars and some other stars of the heavens). The hypothesis was tested for sound waves by Buys Ballot in 1845. He confirmed that the sound's pitch was higher than the emitted frequency when the sound source approached him, and lower than the emitted frequency when the sound source receded from him. Hippolyte Fizeau discovered independently the same phenomenon on electromagnetic waves in 1848 (in France, the effect is sometimes called [...] "effet Doppler-Fizeau" [...] but that name was not adopted {{by the rest of}} the world as Fizeau's discovery was six years after Doppler's proposal). In Britain, John Scott Russell made an <b>experimental</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> the Doppler effect (1848).|$|E

60|$|It {{is further}} to be remembered, {{that even if}} all which this theory of mental {{phenomena}} contends for could be proved, {{we should not be}} the more enabled to resolve the laws of the more complex feelings into those of the simpler ones. The generation of one class of mental phenomena from another, whenever it can be made out, is a highly interesting fact in psychological chemistry; but it no more supersedes the necessity of an <b>experimental</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> the generated phenomenon, than a knowledge of the properties of oxygen and sulphur enables us to deduce those of sulphuric acid without specific observation and experiment. Whatever, therefore, may be the final issue of the attempt to account for the origin of our judgments, our desires, or our volitions, from simpler mental phenomena, it is not the less imperative to ascertain the sequences of the complex phenomena themselves, by special study in conformity to the canons of Induction. Thus, in respect to Belief, psychologists will always have to inquire what beliefs we have by direct consciousness, and according to what laws one belief produces another; what are the laws in virtue of which one thing is recognized by the mind, either rightly or erroneously, as evidence of another thing. In regard to Desire, they will have to examine what objects we desire naturally, and by what causes we are made to desire things originally indifferent, or even disagreeable to us; and so forth. It may be remarked that the general laws of association prevail among these more intricate states of mind, {{in the same manner as}} among the simpler ones. A desire, an emotion, an idea of the higher order of abstraction, even our judgments and volitions, when they have become habitual, are called up by association, according to precisely the same laws as our simple ideas.|$|E
