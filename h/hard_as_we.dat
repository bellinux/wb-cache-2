500|$|According to the rowing {{correspondent}} of The Times, it was [...] "one of {{the greatest}} battles {{in the history of}} the race". [...] Cambridge's boat club president Masser said [...] "I cannot speak too highly Oxford's magnificent row. [...] We had planned to build up an early lead and then row clean away ... but <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> tried we could not shake Oxford off our tail." ...|$|E
2500|$|They [...] "attempted {{to signal}} our {{location}} {{to the surface}} by beating on the mine bolts and plates. We found a sledgehammer, {{and for a long}} time we took turns pounding away. We had to take off the rescuers in order to hammer as <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> could. This effort caused us to breathe much harder. We never heard a responsive blast or shot from the surface." ...|$|E
2500|$|William Morris was {{disappointed}} by the slow growth of the organisation. After six months, the Socialist League only had eight branches and 230 members. Morris wrote to a friend: [...] "I am in low spirits about the prospects of our party, if I can dignify a little knot of men by such a word. You see we are such a few, and <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> work we don't seem to pick up people." ...|$|E

[...] He also said, [...] "I believe that we have the power to deter Iran, should it become nuclear." ...|$|E
2500|$|A further {{modification}} to {{the boiler}} design {{has been the}} use of hollow stays. The stays support and separate the outer boiler and inner firebox. The hollow stays act {{as an indicator of}} any cracks in the otherwise inaccessible stays, such cracks being revealed by water leaks. Leaks have in fact been detected and have led to the locomotive being unavailable for service. In July 2010 while replacement stays were fitted, Mark Allatt, chairman, The A1 Steam Locomotive Trust, commented [...] "Although the problems with Tornado’s boiler are part of learning about the locomotive in today’s operational environment, they are a source of great disappointment to all of Tornado's supporters and customers and our customers' passengers. We are working as <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> can to bring Tornado back to full health as soon as possible and back onto the main line where she belongs." ...|$|E
2500|$|Valve's former {{business}} development chief Jason Holtman {{stated that the}} company sees themselves as an [...] "oddity" [...] {{in an industry that}} looks towards punctual delivery of products; instead, Valve [...] " [...] as <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> can to make the best thing possible in the right time frame and get people content they want to consume. And if that takes longer, that's fine". For that, Valve takes the concept of [...] "Valve Time" [...] as a compliment, and that [...] "having customers consistently looking at our property or something you've done and saying, can you give me more" [...] is evidence that they are making the right decisions with their game releases, according to Holtman. The company does try to avoid unintentional delays of their projects, and believes that the earlier occurrences of [...] "Valve Time" [...] delays, primarily from Half-Life development, has helped them improve their release schedules.|$|E

2500|$|... "It {{must have}} been when I was about 19 or 20 and went out {{training}} with a friend on the Belgian borders. As we spun along, out of nowhere this skinny blond kid was on our back wheel. He looked about 14. He was still there 15 minutes later, so we picked up speed. He just sat there, so we picked up the pace again. It was still no problem for him. I looked over my shoulder {{and he gave me}} a half-mocking, half-friendly grin. In the end, we went as <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> could to try {{to get rid of him}} and teach the little brat a lesson, because by now he was getting a bit too cocky for our tastes. But whatever we did, he still hung on. After about an hour, we came into a village called Ploegsteert, at which point he came alongside with real arrogance and said 'OK, I'm back home now, so 'bye. By the way, I'm Frank Vandenbroucke.' Neither of us had ever met a kid like him." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{spending}} {{the majority of}} the season behind Rosberg, Hamilton had won the four preceding rounds of the season, converting a 29-point deficit into a 17-point lead over his teammate heading into the Austin race. With three races left in the season, Hamilton said he would prioritise not allowing any negative thoughts concerning double-points in the season-closing event in Abu Dhabi bother him and would take any opportunities he was presented with: [...] "We've just got to do our due diligence and work as <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> can to make sure we don't have any problems." [...] Hamilton hoped to achieve his fifth consecutive victory of the year: [...] "A lot of the American side of my family come to the race, plus I won the first F1 GP at the circuit back in 2012 - it's a special one for me. I really enjoy going there and I'm looking forward to another great race." [...] Rosberg was aiming to improve on his best finish in Austin (ninth in 2013) and to further reduce Hamilton's advantage in the Driver's Championship. He said Mercedes were targeting [...] "a big finish" [...] to their season, while also declaring he would not concede defeat until the final round of the season, and hoped to maintain the level of entertainment for the sport's fan base: [...] "The first step comes in Austin, which is a really cool city and a great race track. I haven't had the best races there so far, but I'm determined to change that this year." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the 2006 Jingle Ball, Evanescence {{performed}} [...] "Going Under" [...] and [...] "Call Me When You're Sober". Before {{the start}} of the performance, Lee announced: [...] "We're going to do something completely different from everyone else tonight — and rock as <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> can." [...] During the Family Values Tour 2007, Evanescence performed the song on July 30, 2007, in Mansfield. They had a 65-minute set during the show and Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe praised the performance of the song, writing, [...] "'Call Me When You're Sober' was a seething highpoint, with Lee heaving and hurling her bitterness like so much china at a betrayer's head." [...] The band performed the song during a secret gig concert that took place on November 4, 2009, at the Manhattan Center. Four days later, the band performed the song during the 2009 Maquinaria festival in São Paulo, Brazil. The band later added the song to the set list of their third worldwide tour in support of their third self-titled studio album (2011), titled the Evanescence Tour (2011–12). They also performed [...] "Call Me When You're Sober" [...] during the 2011 Rock in Rio festival on October 2, 2011 as part of the aforementioned tour. On April 11, 2012, the band performed [...] "Call Me When You're Sober" [...] at the 2012 Revolver Golden Gods Awards at the Nokia Theater in Los Angeles. The band later included the song on the set list of their tour which visited cities in the US and Europe in 2016 and 2017. While reviewing a concert from the tour, David Simers from the website National Rock Review observed that the [...] "decibel kept rising" [...] with the performance of the track.|$|E

Six feet tall, muscular and <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> rawhide. <b>We</b> don't {{know much about}} their morals, but they're fearless, proud, and {{distrust}} strangers.

"Not so <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> some <b>we</b> have known, Husband," [...] she answered, laughing, [...] "for {{at least}} we are free and have food to eat, {{and for the rest}} we will borrow from Jacob Smith on the jewels that remain over.

40|$|We {{investigate}} algorithms to {{find the}} first vertex in large trees generated by either the uniform attachment or preferential attachment model. We require the algorithm to output a set of K vertices, such that, with probability at least 1 − ε, the first vertex is in this set. We show that for any ε, there exist such algorithms with K independent {{of the size of}} the input tree. Moreover, we provide almost tight bounds for the best value of K as a function of ε. In the uniform attachment case we show that the optimal K is subpolynomial in 1 /ε, and that it has to be at least superpolylogarithmic. On the other hand, the preferential attachment case is exponentially <b>harder,</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> prove that the best K is polynomial in 1 /ε. We conclude the paper with several open problems. ...|$|R
60|$|Wemmick was {{up early}} in the morning, and I am afraid I heard him {{cleaning}} my boots. After that, he fell to gardening, and I saw him from my gothic window pretending to employ the Aged, and nodding at him in a most devoted manner. Our breakfast {{was as good as}} the supper, and at half-past eight precisely we started for Little Britain. By degrees, Wemmick got dryer and <b>harder</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> went along, and his mouth tightened into a post-office again. At last, when we got to his place of business and he pulled out his key from his coat-collar, he looked as unconscious of his Walworth property as if the Castle and the drawbridge and the arbor and the lake and the fountain and the Aged, had all been blown into space together by the last discharge of the Stinger.|$|R

40|$|Preprint {{to appear}} in a special issue of Cultural Analytics on "Identity. " The article explores the paradox that the {{representation}} of gender in fiction became more flexible while the sheer balance of attention between fictional men and women was growing more unequal. We measure the rigidity of gendered roles by asking {{how easy it is}} to infer grammatical gender from ostensibly ungendered words used in characterization. In the nineteenth century, roles are so predictable that the inference is easy; it becomes <b>harder</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> move toward the present. But the diminishing power of stereotypes does not parallel progress toward equality of representation. On the contrary, by the middle of the twentieth century, women have lost almost half the space they occupied in nineteenth-century fiction. The tension between growing flexibility and growing inequality of representation presents literary historians with a striking paradox; a few potential explanations are considered...|$|R

40|$|Two {{topics are}} presented: {{synchronization}} games and synchronization costs. In a synchronization game on a deterministic finite automaton, {{there are two}} players, Alice and Bob, whose moves alternate. Alice wants to synchronize the given automaton, while Bob aims to make her task <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> possible. <b>We</b> answer a few natural questions related to such games. Speaking about synchronization costs, we consider deterministic automata in which each transition has a certain price. The problem {{is whether or not}} a given automaton can be synchronized within a given budget. We determine the complexity of this problem. © 2012 Springer-Verlag...|$|R
