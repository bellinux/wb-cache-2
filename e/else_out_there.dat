500|$|Bleeding Through's The Truth {{album was}} {{released}} on January 10, 2006 through Trustkill Records. The album was produced by Rob Caggiano, lead guitarist of Anthrax. The band decided to rebuild their sound from the ground up, quoting to Alternative Press as [...] "Taking out the Metalcore, and then adding the metal into hardcore, if that makes any sense." [...] (--Scott Danough, guitarist). [...] "I don't think this album sounds like anything <b>else</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> right now. We're {{very proud of that}} fact." [...] says guitarist Brian Leppke.|$|E
500|$|Reznor called Year Zero a [...] "shift in direction" [...] {{in that it}} [...] "doesn't {{sound like}} With Teeth". [...] He also {{said that when he}} {{finishes}} a new album, he has to [...] "go into battle with the people {{whose job it is to}} figure out how to sell the record. The only time that didn't happen was [...] With Teeth. This time, however, [...] expecting an epic struggle. [...] is not a particularly friendly record and it certainly doesn't sound like anything <b>else</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> right now." ...|$|E
500|$|For me, in my {{mind the}} {{accomplishment}} is just that much sweeter. In terms of my ethnicity, always feeling like an outsider, always feeling different ... for me it's about saying, 'Thank you Lord, for giving me the faith to believe in myself when other people had written me off.' I've gone through enough of my life worrying {{about that kind of}} thing. I want to encourage anyone <b>else</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> who feels like maybe they can't overcome an obstacle, I feel like I'm living proof ... never lose your faith. I'm seriously a grateful individual right now.|$|E
5000|$|Marisa Brown of AllMusic {{gave the}} album 4 stars out of 5, saying, [...] "Hezekiah's rhymes and beats are more focused, clearer, and more {{intelligent}} {{than a lot}} of what <b>else</b> is <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> and he writes well-done, backpacker-friendly songs that are also catchy and memorable." ...|$|R
5000|$|In his {{interview}} for The Paris Review's My First Time (film series), Knausgard described the book's writing process {{as not being}} [...] "related to me, in any normal sense. I'm writing things that I never could think of. It's like <b>there's</b> something <b>else</b> coming <b>out</b> <b>there.</b> And I think that's the definition of writing. It {{was a very good}} time for me." ...|$|R

500|$|In 2011, Richard Cobbett {{summarized}} Maniac Mansion as [...] "one of {{the most}} intricate and important adventure games ever made". Retro Gamer ranked {{it as one of}} the ten best Commodore 64 games in 2006, and IGN later named it one of the ten best LucasArts adventure game. Seven years after the NES version's debut, Nintendo Power named it the 61st best game ever. The publication dubbed it the 16th best NES title in 2008. The game's uniqueness and clever writing were praised by Nintendo Power: in 2010, the magazine's Chris Hoffman stated that the game is [...] "unlike anything <b>else</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> — a point-and-click adventure with an awesome sense of humor and multiple solutions to almost every puzzle." [...] In its retrospective coverage, Nintendo Power several times noted the ability to microwave a hamster, which the staff considered to be an iconic scene. In March 2012, Retro Gamer listed the hamster incident as one of the [...] "100 Classic Gaming Moments".|$|E
500|$|The first season, which premiered on September 24, 2013, aired episodes that {{directly}} relate to {{events in the}} films [...] and Captain America: The Winter Soldier. The revelation in Captain America: The Winter Soldier that S.H.I.E.L.D. had been infiltrated by Hydra had {{a huge impact on}} the series. Regarding the synergy the show had with addressing events from the film, Loeb said, [...] "It's an extremely unique experience that doesn't exist anywhere <b>else</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> in the entertainment business." [...] The second season, which premiered on September 23, 2014, introduces Inhumans to the MCU, ahead of their own television series. Additionally, a recurring plot point in the first two seasons involved the body of a member of the Kree race, who {{play a significant role in}} Guardians of the Galaxy. The third season, which premiered on September 29, 2015, introduces the concept of the Secret Warriors, with new Inhuman characters inspired by the comic of the same name, as well as Life Model Decoys. The fourth season, which premiered on September 20, 2016, sees Robbie Reyes / Ghost Rider introduced to the MCU, and ties to the second season of Agent Carter and Doctor Strange. The fifth season is scheduled to premiere on December 1, 2017.|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{released}} her eighth studio album, Music, in September 2000. It featured elements from the electronica-inspired Ray of Light era, and like its predecessor, received acclaim from critics. Collaborating with French producer Mirwais Ahmadzaï, Madonna commented: [...] "I love {{to work with}} the weirdos that no one knows about—the people who have raw talent and who are making music unlike anyone <b>else</b> <b>out</b> <b>there.</b> Music is the future of sound." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic felt that [...] "Music blows by in a kaleidoscopic rush of color, technique, style and substance. It has so many depth and layers that it's easily as self-aware and earnest as Ray of Light." [...] The album took the number-one position in more than 20 countries worldwide and sold four million copies in the first ten days. In the U.S., Music debuted at the top, and became her first number-one album in eleven years since Like a Prayer. It produced three singles: the Hot 100 number-one [...] "Music", [...] "Don't Tell Me", and [...] "What It Feels Like for a Girl". The music video of [...] "What It Feels Like for a Girl" [...] depicted Madonna committing acts of crime and vandalism, and was banned by MTV and VH1.|$|E
5000|$|By {{the early}} 1970s Fishtown had {{a steady flow}} of {{visitors}} and several year-round residents, with Krafft serving as the commune's [...] "self-proclaimed mayor", organizing basic logistics - although, as Bo Miller would later point out, [...] "There was no control over anybody <b>else's</b> life <b>out</b> <b>there.</b> We weren't looking for a father figure. We weren't looking for someone to tell us what to do. We knew, each, bloody well what we wanted to do. We were strong personalities." ...|$|R

[...] And with that she shut down the window.|$|R
5000|$|Partially {{destroyed}} by {{bombing of the}} Russian army during the period 1994-1996 and 1999-2000, the memorial complex was again defaced {{in an attempt to}} demolish it conducted in 2008 by the authorities. At the time, the uproar of human rights defenders at this [...] "barbarism" [...] and [...] "vandalism" [...] saved [...] "the only really Chechen monument of the city" [...] from the complete demolition, although, inevitably regarded as a symbol of independence, it was then enclosed by a fence, so that nothing was indicating to the uninitiated that a memorial or anything <b>else</b> was <b>out</b> <b>there</b> somewhere.|$|R
500|$|Ultimately, {{the season}} {{featured}} several tie-in episodes with Marvel Cinematic Universe films: the episode [...] "The Well" [...] takes place directly {{after the events}} of the episode [...] "T.A.H.I.T.I." [...] introduces the alien race the Kree to the MCU (confirmed as such in the second season), members of which {{play a significant role in}} Guardians of the Galaxy; and the episodes [...] "End of the Beginning" [...] and [...] "Turn, Turn, Turn" [...] revolve around the events of Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Due to Captain America: The Winter Soldier revealing that Hydra had infiltrated S.H.I.E.L.D. with sleeper agents, the season sees a retooling for the final six episodes. Regarding the synergy the show has with addressing events from the films, Loeb said [...] "It's an extremely unique experience that doesn't exist anywhere <b>else</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> in the entertainment business". The characters face the Hydra issue head on, while experiencing trust issues within themselves. Jed Whedon added that the Hydra element, which the show could not mention until after the release of The Winter Soldier in order to avoid spoiling the film, also attempts to address the lack of characters from the comics, a complaint fans had throughout the season, while also tying established threats such as the Clairvoyant, Project Centipede, and Deathlok, back into Hydra.|$|E

5000|$|The film {{received}} {{positive feedback}} from independent movie reviewers, however audiences were divisive, but many noted Ridley's casting as well. Dr. Lenera of Horror Cult Films rated the film 8/10 stars {{and said it}} is [...] "a very impressive piece of work considering the circumstances of its making, and is certainly very different to much <b>else</b> that is <b>out</b> <b>there</b> at the moment." ...|$|R

Kendall found the incident amusing and was not ill-disposed towards either author.

[...] Of the series, Alison Graham from the Radio Times quipped [...] "It's a cheerful half-hour of amiable nonsense led by Sue Perkins. I know it hasn't set the world on fire, but its heart is in the right place and the gags are often clever." [...] Kevin O'Sullivan from the Daily Mirror called the series [...] "pathetic", adding [...] "Sadly, it's not even mildly amusing. It's a toe-curling car crash.

She has grown up in Colby all her life and has had life long friends who will always be there, but she also has an ure to leave Colby and see what <b>else</b> is <b>out</b> <b>there.</b> Theo represents life outside of Colby and Luke represents Colby.

50|$|As a {{start-up}} without any brand recognition, you’re {{going to have}} to paint a very clear picture as to why you’re worth people’s time. Often though, many companies’ marketing messages end up being vague and unfocused, thereby losing their impact and persuasiveness. The value proposition frames not only how you’re creating value for the audience by addressing a core need, but critically why the solution is better than what they are currently doing or using, or versus whatever <b>else</b> is potentially <b>out</b> <b>there</b> that could do so.|$|R
