40|$|<b>Discrete</b> Clifford {{analysis}} is a <b>discrete</b> higher-dimensional function theory which corresponds simultaneously to a refinement of <b>discrete</b> harmonic analysis {{and to a}} <b>discrete</b> counterpart of Euclidean Clifford analysis. The <b>discrete</b> framework {{is based on a}} <b>discrete</b> Dirac operator that combines both forward and backward difference operators and on the splitting of the basis elements into forward and backward basis elements. For a systematic development of this function theory, an indispensable tool is the Taylor series expansion, which decomposes a <b>discrete</b> (monogenic) function in terms of <b>discrete</b> homogeneous (monogenic) building blocks. The latter are the so-called <b>discrete</b> Fueter polynomials. For a <b>discrete</b> function, the authors assumed a series expansion which is formally equivalent to the Taylor series expansion in Euclidean Clifford analysis; however, attention needed to be paid to the geometrical conditions on the domain of the function, the convergence and the equivalence to the given <b>discrete</b> function. We furthermore applied the theory to <b>discrete</b> delta functions and investigated the connection with Shannon sampling theorem (Bell Sys Tech J 27 : 379 - 423, 1948). We found that any <b>discrete</b> function admits a series expansion into <b>discrete</b> homogeneous polynomials and any <b>discrete</b> monogenic function admits a Taylor series expansion in terms of the <b>discrete</b> Fueter polynomials, i. e. <b>discrete</b> homogeneous monogenic polynomials. Although formally the <b>discrete</b> Taylor series expansion of a function resembles the continuous Taylor series expansion, the main difference {{is that there is no}} restriction on <b>discrete</b> functions to be represented as infinite series of <b>discrete</b> homogeneous polynomials. Finally, since the continuous expansion of the Taylor series expansion of <b>discrete</b> delta functions is a sinc function, the <b>discrete</b> Taylor series expansion lays a link with Shannon sampling...|$|R

50|$|The MIL-STD-1760 {{interface}} is used {{as follows}} with a notional weapon that uses GPS for terminal guidance. Prior to activating any of the store's interface signals, the aircraft will examine the interlock <b>discretes</b> {{to ensure that the}} store is attached to the aircraft, thereby preventing the ground crew from being subjected to an electrical shock hazard while servicing the aircraft. The interface will be energized to supply the weapon with electrical power when the air crew determines that hostilities are imminent. The weapon electronics will initialize itself, including running a battery of self tests and starting its MIL-STD-1553 communications interface. The weapon will read its address from the settings on its MIL-STD-1760 interface and will start to listen for MIL-STD-1553 commands to that address from the SMS. These commands will commence with requests for the weapon to report its status, and will continue with commands that ready the weapon for its mission, such as navigation initialization and target coordinates. The weapon's GPS receiver will be able to lock onto the signals from GPS satellites and resolve its position much more quickly after it separates from the aircraft if it is initialized with the current position and time. The aircraft may use the MIL-STD-1553 interface to send current position and time to the weapon, and a high bandwidth signal to route the GPS satellite signal from a topside aircraft antenna to the weapon.|$|E
