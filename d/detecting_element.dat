40|$|Many modern {{manufacturing}} industries use granular {{materials as}} raw materials. A highly accurate feeder {{is needed to}} supply granules to processes {{in order to maintain}} the quality of products. There are various types of feeders depending on the purposes and the nature of supply materials. Improvements in current high accuracy feeders and/or control systems are required. In this study, a screw feeder together with a control system, including a flowmeter as a sensor, is discussed. Tow types of flowmeter are used. One is an impact-type flowmeter in current use. The other is a prototype strain-gauge-type flowmeter developed at the author's laboratory. The characteristics of the flowmeters, such as speed of response and the difference of response depending on the nature of supply granules, are examined. A control system using the flowmeters as the <b>detecting</b> <b>element</b> in order to supply fixed quantities with high accuracy was constructed. A self tuning regulator (STR) scheme is applied to the system as the control method.

We have optimized the fabrication process starting with ultra-thin NbN films, Au films for antenna structures and their patterning using e-beam lithography and lift-off. The coupling between normal conducting antenna and NbN detector has been improved by introducing an intermediate NbN film to reduce proximity suppression of superconductivity in the <b>detecting</b> <b>element.</b> A critical temperature of about 9. 5 K is reached for NbN films with a thickness between 5 nm and 6 nm. A twofold increase of the film thickness increases the critical temperature to 12 K.

This value {{is close to the}} critical temperature of 5. 5 nm thick HEB devices.

40|$|In {{the field}} of {{acceleration}} sensors, 3 -axis acceleration sensors that detect acceleration in 3 -dimensional space have already been commercialized, and also in {{the field of}} angular velocity sensors, piezoelectric type 2 -axis angular velocity sensors have been developed. By applying such piezoelectric type 2 -axis angular velocity sensors, 3 -axis angular velocity can be detected with the oscillator’s velocity components in the directions of two axes, and the detection components of Coriolis force produced by angular velocity in the directions of two axes. By using this principle, we have succeeded in developing a 3 -axis angular velocity sensor (1) that detects 3 -axis angular velocity with one <b>detecting</b> <b>element,</b> which was announced at this symposium last year. By applying the 3 -axis angular velocity sensor, acceleration and angular velocity can be discriminated with use of the difference in frequency between the force produced by acceleration and the Coriolis force produced in synchronization with the oscillator’s drive frequency. With this, we have succeeded in developing a 6 -axis motion sensor that detects 3 -axis acceleration and 3 -axis angular velocity with one <b>detecting</b> <b>element.</b> This report details the construction, detection principle, and detection circuit, as well as the performance, such as sensitivity, cross-axis sensitivity, and linearity of the 6 -axis motion sensor using a piezoelectric element, and furthermore the influence of acceleration on angular velocity characteristics...|$|E
