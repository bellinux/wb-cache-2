Governor Fisher was an old friend and ally of McCreight, and together they labored for many years on the Cook Forest conservation project. [...] Both were “farm-boy” bankers who grew up near the Great Shamokin Path of the Seneca, knew the forests and believed in conservation. It was not until Fisher was elected Governor that the Cook Forest Bill was finally passed and signed on April 14, 1927. Governor Fisher supported McCreight’s proposal. “The Governor has written me that he is greatly interested {{in the use of}} the park for the home of the native Red Folks, and I think the plan can be worked out. [...] My suggestion is that Good Face, and with William Spotted Tail with his family, and John Sitting Bull, and others who would suit with my old friend Flying Hawk who lives at Rockyford.” McCreight, forever the dedicated public educator, saw yet another opportunity for [...] "Young America". “The Eastern people, especially the younger generation, are greatly interested in the Indians and to have a few of the old time names of whom they have read in history, it would add to their desire to know more of them. [...] Anyway, the American People owe the Indians a lot and there is nothing that I know of that would be finer, than to make a nice home for them in this great natural forest where they once lived and which was theirs before the whites came and it is the one piece of land that is just the same as it was when the original red men lived there. [...] Like all parks in the north, it would not be necessary for them to remain in it in the winter, likely they could go back and forth as it appealed to them. [...] Of course there are plenty of Indians that would be glad to get the chance to come, but not all are desired by any means. [...] I know Commissioner of Indian Affairs Charles H. Burke and will of course consult with him if the plan seems to be practical in other ways. [...] I would like, first to know whether the plan would appeal to the Indians themselves, the ones <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> to have for it. [...] Possibly you could see Spotted Tail too. [...] Good Face has been here before. [...] He told me he was at my house nearly thirty years ago. [...] Now that you understand what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind,</b> there are others who might be just as desirable to those mentioned, in your country, and I wish you would think about it and write me again how you regard it, and with any suggestions you might have considering the plan.” In February 1929, the Superintendent of the Pine Ridge Agency, Indian Field Service of the U.S. Department of the Interior contacted McCreight that “two families have signified their willingness to go if proper arrangements can be made and a contract and bond furnished.” [...] McCreight’s vision of Lakota living and working at Cook Forest was endorsed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and families were ready to move to the great forest along the Clarion River. However, when the stock market crashed on October 29, 1929, with the onset of the Great Depression, the Lakota project at Cook Forest was shelved.|$|E

60|$|To {{capture the}} fish is {{not all of the}} fishing.

No matter for what slight misdemeanor he may have been arrested, once he has made his escape the hue-and-cry will be raised.

60|$|You have {{no doubt}} noticed that certain books produce a sort of {{physical}} effect on one--mostly an audible effect. I am not alluding here to Blue books or to books of statistics. The effect of these is simply exasperating and no more. No! the books <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> are just the common books of commerce you and I read when we have five minutes to spare, the usual hired books published by ordinary publishers, printed by ordinary printers, and censored (when {{they happen to be}} novels) by the usual circulating libraries, the guardians of our firesides, whose names are household words within the four seas.|$|E
60|$|For instance, {{for some}} years it had been my {{practice}} each winter to cruise for six or eight weeks on San Francisco Bay. My stout sloop yacht, the Spray, had a comfortable cabin and a coal stove. A Korean boy did the cooking, and I usually took a friend or so along to share the joys of the cruise. Also, I took my machine along and did my thousand words a day. On the particular trip <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind,</b> Cloudesley and Toddy came along. This was Toddy's first trip. On previous trips Cloudesley had elected to drink beer; so I had kept the yacht supplied with beer and had drunk beer with him.|$|E

60|$|The {{particular}} instance <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> was on Malaita, the most savage {{island in the}} easterly Solomons. The natives had been remarkably friendly; and how were we {{to know that the}} whole village had been taking up a collection for over two years with which to buy a white man's head? The beggars are all head-hunters, and they especially esteem a white man's head. The fellow who captured the head would receive the whole collection. As I say, they appeared very friendly; and on this day I was fully a hundred yards down the beach from the boat. Otoo had cautioned me; and, as usual when I did not heed him, I came to grief.|$|E
60|$|On the {{particular}} day <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> {{there was an}} unusually large crowd in attendance, and the police had their hands full keeping the people back. There was much pushing and shoving, and the ropes were bulging with the pressure of men, women and children. As I {{came down from the}} dressing room I noticed two girls outside the ropes, of about fourteen and sixteen, and inside the rope a youngster of eight or nine. They were holding him by the hands, and he was struggling, excitedly and half in laughter, to get away from them. I thought nothing of it at the time--just a bit of childish play, no more; and {{it was only in the}} light of after events that the scene was impressed vividly upon me.|$|E

I wouldn't for the world approach Madame de Cintre without all the proper forms. If I ought to go and tell your mother, why I will go and tell her. I will go and tell your brother, even. I will go and tell any one you please. As I don't know any one else, I begin by telling you. But that, if it is a social obligation, is a pleasure as well." ...|$|E
50|$|Guitarist and songwriter, A.J. Novello, {{had this}} to say on the album:...it wasn't exactly what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind.</b> (It) was a little too metallic.

60|$|Seeing the {{favorable}} {{disposition of the}} warriors toward Tars Tarkas, as well as toward me, I grasped the opportunity to enlist them in my cause against Zodanga.

[...] "Ye have spoken of the streak of fat that runs in big men's muscles, of the grit {{of women and the}} love, and ye have spoken fair; but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> things which {{happened}} when the land was young and the fires of men apart as the stars. It was then I had concern with a big man, and a streak of fat, and a woman. And the woman was small; but her heart was greater than the beef-heart of the man, and she had grit. And we traveled a weary trail, even to the Salt Water, and the cold was bitter, the snow deep, the hunger great. And the woman's love was a mighty love--no more can man say than this." ...|$|E
6000|$|His tone became {{suddenly}} serious. [...] "You are right, I can't ask you {{to share}} a life like mine. It is too uncertain. I may be ordered back to my regiment next winter, and then nothing remains but garrison duty. I think I will then resign. But I am unfitted for business, or for any money-getting, and so I've decided that as an honorable man I must not imperil the happiness of a woman. I {{claim to be a}} person of taste, and the girl I admired would have other chances in life. I can't afford to say to her, 'Give up all your comfort and security and come with me to the frontier.' She would be foolish to listen--no woman of the stamp <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> could do it." [...] They were nearing [...] "the parsonage" [...] gate, and he ended in a low voice: [...] "Don't you think I am right?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{waved his}} hand vaguely in the {{direction}} of the north-east, where stretched a terra incognita into which vastness few men have strayed and fewer emerged. [...] "I was in camp one day with Klooch. Klooch was as handsome a little kamooks as ever whined betwixt the traces or shoved nose into a camp kettle. Her father was a full-blood Malemute from Russian Pastilik on Bering Sea, and I bred her, and with understanding, out of a clean-legged bitch of the Hudson Bay stock. I tell you, O man, she was a corker combination. And now, on this day <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind,</b> she was brought to pup through a pure wild wolf of the woods--grey, and long of limb, with big lungs and no end of staying powers. Say! Was there ever the like? It was a new breed of dog I had started, and I could look forward to big things.|$|E

5000|$|With the {{publication}} of The Children of Húrin, Christopher Tolkien quotes his father's own words on his fictional universe: [...] once upon a time... <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> to make a body of more or less connected legend...

"I {{have faced}} {{charging}} tigers and elephants in India, and charging rhinos and lions in Africa," [...] began Castleton, his quick and fluent speech {{so different from}} the drawl of his ordinary conversation; [...] "but I never was frightened but once. It will not do to hunt those wild beasts if you are easily balled up. This adventure <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> happened in British East Africa, in Uganda. I was out with safari, and we were in a native district much infested by man-eating lions. Perhaps I may as well state that man-eaters are very different from ordinary lions. They are always matured beasts, and sometimes--indeed, mostly--are old. They become man-eaters most likely by accident or necessity. When old they find it more difficult to make a kill, being slower, probably, and with poorer teeth. Driven by hunger, they stalk and kill a native, and, once having tasted human blood, they want no other. They become absolutely fearless and terrible in their attacks.|$|E

Let me drop Neo-European; let me say Northern. We are Northerners. The key, the heart, the nucleus and essence of every culture is its conception of the relations of men and women; and this new culture tends to diminish the specialisation of women as women, to let them out from the cell of the home into common citizenship with men. It's a new culture, still in process of development, which will make men more social and co-operative and women bolder, swifter, more responsible and less cloistered. It minimises instead of exaggerating the importance of sex....|$|E

Here is a youth of good family, who elects {{to take up a}} life filled with mischief from the start. Discipline has been lacking. Here, at last, he so far oversteps the law that he appears before a jury. It seems to the Court necessary, for this young man's own good, that he feel the harsh hand of the law. According to the evidence adduced here to-day, he has been for years beyond the control of his parents, and must now know the inflexible purpose of law. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> all that can be said in his favor: his youth, the disparity of age and physical power between himself and his accuser, the provocation, and the possession of the whip by the accuser--but all these are more than counterbalanced by the record of mischief and violence which stands against the prisoner." ...|$|E
