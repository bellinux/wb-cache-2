5|$|A {{large number}} of stone monuments {{were placed in the}} North Acropolis. By the 9th century AD these {{included}} 43 stelae and 30 altars; 18 of these monuments were sculpted with hieroglyphic texts and royal portraits.

5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 6th century AD Calakmul was {{assembling}} a far-reaching political alliance, activity that brought the city into conflict with the <b>great</b> <b>city</b> of Tikal. The influence of Calakmul extended deep into the Petén; king Tuun K'ab' Hix of Calakmul oversaw the enthronement of Aj Wosal to the rulership of Naranjo in 546.

5|$|Meanwhile, the Seljuq Zengi, Atabeg of Mosul, {{had added}} to his rule in 1128 Aleppo, the key to power in Syria, contested between the rulers of Mosul and Damascus. Both Zengi and King Baldwin II turned their {{attention}} towards Damascus; Baldwin was defeated outside the <b>great</b> <b>city</b> in 1129. Damascus, ruled by the Burid Dynasty, later allied with King Fulk when Zengi besieged the city in 1139 and 1140; the alliance was negotiated by the chronicler Usamah ibn Munqidh.|$|E
5|$|As the Classic Maya {{collapse}} {{swept across}} the Maya region, city after city ceased to erect stelae recording its dynastic achievements. At the important city of Calakmul, two stelae were raised in 800 and three more in 810, but these were the last and the city fell into silence. At Oxkintok the last stela was raised in 859. Stela11, dated to 869, was the last monument to ever be erected at the once <b>great</b> <b>city</b> of Tikal. The last known Maya stelae bearing a Long Count calendrical date are Toniná Monument101, which was erected in 909 to mark the k'atun ending that year, and Stela6 from Itzimté, dated to 910.|$|E
5|$|Cow Tower is an {{artillery}} tower {{that was built}} in the city of Norwich, Norfolk, England, between 1398 and 1399. Norwich was a prosperous city in the late 14th century, with a population of around 5,000 involved in key medieval industries and forming a centre for international trade. Between 1297 and 1350 the city had erected a circuit of defensive stone walls and ditches, both to impress upon outsiders the status of Norwich as a <b>great</b> <b>city,</b> but also to defend against invasion or civil disorder.|$|E

5|$|He {{opened his}} 2011 {{season with a}} run in the 150m {{straight}} race at Manchester's <b>Great</b> <b>City</b> Games and timed 14.51 seconds (the second fastest after Bolt's 2009 run). His season's best run of 9.79sec for the 100m came in June in Clermont, Florida and ranked it him as the third fastest {{in the event that}} year. Gay was defeated by Steve Mullings at the adidas Grand Prix in New York – Mullings failed a doping test later that month and was banned for life. A nagging hip injury led to Gay's withdrawal from the 2011 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships and in July he underwent acetabular labrum surgery; almost a year passed until the next time he competed.|$|E
5|$|In the Brahmanda Purana, Kamadhenu {{creates a}} <b>great</b> <b>city</b> by her power to {{accommodate}} Kartavirya Arjuna's army, when they visit Jamadagni's hermitage. On {{returning to his}} kingdom, Kartavirya Arjuna's minister, Chandragupta, persuades him to capture the divine cow. The minister returns to the hermitage and tries to convince the sage to give away the cow, but to no avail, so he tries to snatch Kamadhenu with force. In the ensuing fight, the sage is killed, but Kamadhenu escapes to the sky and Chandragupta takes her calf with him instead. The Brahmanda Purana narrates this Kamadhenu Sushila was given to Jamadagni by the Kamadhenu-Surabhi, who governs in Goloka.|$|E
5|$|Maya stelae (singular stela) are monuments {{that were}} {{fashioned}} by the Maya civilization of ancient Mesoamerica. They consist of tall, sculpted stone shafts {{and are often}} associated with low circular stones referred to as altars, although their actual function is uncertain. Many stelae were sculpted in low relief, although plain monuments are found throughout the Maya region. The sculpting of these monuments spread throughout the Maya area during the Classic Period (250–900 AD), and these pairings of sculpted stelae and circular altars are considered a hallmark of Classic Maya civilization. The earliest dated stela to {{have been found in}} situ in the Maya lowlands was recovered from the <b>great</b> <b>city</b> of Tikal in Guatemala. During the Classic Period almost every Maya kingdom in the southern lowlands raised stelae in its ceremonial centre.|$|E

5|$|Seibal {{underwent}} a revival in the Late Classic with {{an expansion of}} occupation linked to the <b>great</b> <b>city</b> of Tikal. About AD 650 new inhabitants moved into the city in order to found a new kingdom. GroupsA and D saw new construction, with a particular emphasis on GroupD, which became {{an important part of}} the ceremonial centre. Any monuments raised by the Late Classic rulers responsible for this renewed occupation were defaced when the city suffered a catastrophic defeat in the 8th century AD.|$|E
5|$|The central Petén {{style of}} {{architecture}} is modelled after the <b>great</b> <b>city</b> of Tikal. The style {{is characterized by}} tall pyramids supporting a summit shrine adorned with a roof comb, and accessed by a single doorway. Additional features are the use of stela-altar pairings, and the decoration of architectural façades, lintels, and roof combs with relief sculptures of rulers and gods. One of the finest examples of Central Petén style architecture is Tikal Temple I. Examples of sites in the Central Petén style include Altun Ha, Calakmul, Holmul, Ixkun, Nakum, Naranjo, and Yaxhá.|$|E
5|$|Adrift in a <b>Great</b> <b>City</b> is a 1914 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Film Corporation that stars Florence LaBadie. The film begins with Pat Moran who pays for the passage {{of his wife and}} daughter to join him in America, but he is seriously injured on the way to greeting them. Left by themselves, the daughter works in a sweatshop and goes blind, forcing her and her mother to become beggars. By pure happenstance, the blind girl wanders to the hospital where her father is recovering and tells her story to a doctor. The father recognizes the girl as his daughter and the family is reunited, and the doctor confirms her blindness can be cured. The film was reviewed negatively by critics for its poor scenario, settings and technical execution. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

5|$|Animated {{television}} advertisements starring the transgender playboy cow Graham Heffer {{ran from}} 1999 until 2002. The adverts attracted complaints {{from the public}} for allegedly promoting bestiality, homosexuality and drug-taking. Boddingtons become an official partner of the 2002 XVII Commonwealth Games held in Manchester in a deal worth at least £1million. To mark the occasion, a special Boddingtons 5% ABV Commonwealth Ale cask ale was produced for the North West of England, and subsequently launched nationwide. The last Boddingtons television advertising campaign in 2005 was criticised for capitalising on the beer's Manchester heritage with a Happy Mondays soundtrack, even though production had {{moved out of the}} city. Mike Thompson, a former worker at the brewery and representative of the Transport & General Workers' Union, said: This is at best cynical and at worst a slur on our <b>great</b> <b>city,</b> its heritage and the Strangeways workers. People have lost their livelihoods because of how this company has behaved. They will not be best pleased at what we can only see as pouring salt on the wounds.|$|E
5|$|At the <b>Great</b> <b>City</b> Games in Manchester, England in May, he set {{his sights}} on {{breaking}} Tommie Smith's 44-year-old world best mark over a 200m straight. He beat Smith's time of 19.5 by finishing in 19.41seconds – including a first 100m of 9.88 and a first 150m of 14.41seconds. He suffered from hamstring difficulty after the run but returned to compete at the Prefontaine Classic in Eugene, Oregon in July – his first meeting of the 2010 IAAF Diamond League. Running over 200m, he finished in 19.76seconds but was beaten to the line by Walter Dix, who returned from a year-long hiatus. A week later he attended the British Grand Prix and, in spite of poor conditions, he gained a victory over his rival Asafa Powell with a 9.93-second run. He set a meet record of 19.72seconds at the Herculis meeting in Monaco later that month, but expressed disappointment with his race execution as Yohan Blake came close to overhauling him at the finish.|$|E
5|$|Bolt {{started the}} season {{competing}} over 400 metres {{in order to}} improve his speed, winning two races and registering 45.54 s in Kingston, and windy conditions gave him his first sub-10 second finish of the season in the 100 m in March. In late April Bolt suffered minor leg injuries in a car crash. However, he quickly recovered following minor surgery and (after cancelling a track meet in Jamaica) he stated that he was fit to compete in the 150 metres street race at the Manchester <b>Great</b> <b>City</b> Games. Bolt won the race in 14.35 s, the fastest time ever recorded for 150 m. Despite not being at full fitness, he took the 100 and 200 m titles at the Jamaican national championships, with runs of 9.86 s and 20.25 s respectively. This meant he had qualified for both events at the 2009 World Championships. Rival Tyson Gay suggested that Bolt's 100 m record was within his grasp, but Bolt dismissed the claim and instead noted that he was more interested in Asafa Powell's return from injury. Bolt defied unfavourable conditions at the Athletissima meet in July, running 19.59 seconds into a 0.9m/s headwind and rain, to record the fourth fastest time ever over 200 m, one hundredth off Gay's best time.|$|E

5|$|In the Late Classic period Motul de San José {{was located}} between two {{mutually}} hostile powers, the <b>great</b> <b>city</b> of Tikal {{to the north}} and the breakaway kingdom of Petexbatún to the southwest, which had become a vassal of Tikal's implacable enemy Calakmul. In Mesoamerica, such border states as Motul de San José became centres of political activity as they tried to manipulate the shifting political fortunes of their neighbours to their own advantage. This {{seems to be the case}} at Motul de San José with its rich ceramic tradition being a testament to the politically motivated banqueting that took place in the city. In the 8th century, although Motul de San José was the capital of the Ik polity, the aristocracy of its satellite sites wielded great power and were able to challenge their own position within the political hierarchy of the state while remaining subordinate to the ruling lord of the capital city.|$|E
5|$|Resonance of Fate {{takes place}} on Earth in the distant future. The levels of {{pollution}} in the atmosphere trigger massive environmental changes, making the world hostile to human life. On the brink of extinction, humanity creates Basel, a giant air purification module controlled by the Zenith System. As conditions worsened in the land surrounding Basel, the remnants of humanity gathered around it and built a <b>great</b> <b>city</b> {{at the base of}} Zenith's tower. While Basel and the Zenith System control the surrounding environment to make it habitable for humans, it also controls the human population: each person has their social status determined at birth, and their exact lifespan is controlled through quartz crystals programmed by Zenith. Basel evolves for countless years into a class-driven society, the populace forgets everything about Basel's past: those {{at the top of the}} tower are the city's leaders, dubbed Cardinals, and indoctrinate the people into a religion deifying the Zenith System.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenario}} {{was written}} by Lloyd F. Lonergan, but {{the director of the}} film is uncredited. Little is known of the production, but a review in The New York Dramatic Mirror made the assumption that the scenes were shot in the morning. The film starred Florence La Badie, who was the most prominent player of the Thanhouser Company and frequently in the leading roles of films including the The Million Dollar Mystery which would captivate the United States. The role of the father was played, Sidney Bracy, was a stage actor of considerable experience who claimed to have been affiliated with the Thanhouser players since 1910. Though Q. David Bowers says that it is probably an incorrect assertion, it is possible that Bracy may not have been a full-time member of the company. Bracy's first credited work appears in 1913, but it would not be until The Million Dollar Mystery that Bracy would garner much attention in the role of Jones, the Butler. The role of the doctor was played by Arthur Bauer who was a veteran of the stage and film, through the Great Northern Film Company, before signing onto the Thanhouser Company. The announcement of Bauer's role at Thanhouser came after the release of sixteen films, including Adrift in the <b>Great</b> <b>City,</b> on March 21, 1914. Lila Chester, played the role of a nurse in the production. Chester was claimed by a Thanhouser publicist to have appeared in over 400 films by February 14, 1914. Bowers reasons that if these productions were with Thanhouser, than most of them had to be minor roles {{because of the lack of}} attention and credits she was given. The one reel drama film, approximately 1008 feet long, was filmed in New York City and New Rochelle, New York.|$|E
