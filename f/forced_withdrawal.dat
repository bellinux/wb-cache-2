In July, it was announced that Coulthard would remain at Red Bull for 2006. This marked a turning point in his season as Coulthard did not score points in six of the nine remaining races. He achieved points three times during this period—in Germany, Turkey and Japan. He finished the season in twelfth place with Red Bull seventh in the Constructors' Championship.|$|E

25|$|The Sultan {{also ordered}} his vassal Muhammad Ali not to {{withdraw}} his army from the Peloponnese. But the Allies despatched envoys to Alexandria {{to demand that}} the Egyptian prince do precisely that. This left Muhammad Ali in a dilemma. On the one hand, as an experienced statesman, he knew that with the Great Powers backing Greek autonomy, the game {{was up in the}} Peloponnese. On the other, he was reluctant to be seen as betraying his overlord, especially now that he had declared jihad, and also to inflict on his son Ibrahim the humiliation of a <b>forced</b> <b>withdrawal.</b> So he played for time, engaging the Allies in lengthy but inconclusive negotiations, in the hope that in the meantime the Sultan would himself reach an agreement with the Allies that would permit Ibrahim a face-saving departure.|$|E

40|$|Background. Spinal catheters, {{because of}} their smaller diameter, have lower tensile {{strength}} than epidural catheters. This {{study was designed to}} measure the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>forces</b> needed to remove lumbar spinal catheters and to determine whether patient position affects <b>withdrawal</b> <b>forces.</b> Methods. Eighty-two patients with a 24 -gauge spinal catheter placed midline at the lumbar L 3 / 4 or L 4 / 5 level were randomly assigned to catheter removal either in flexed lateral or sitting position. <b>Withdrawal</b> <b>forces</b> were measured using a tension spring balance. Results. Mean <b>withdrawal</b> <b>force</b> was 0. 91 N (95 % CI: 0. 73, 1. 09) with extremes up to 5 N. <b>Withdrawal</b> <b>force</b> in the flexed lateral position was 1. 04 N (95 % CI: 0. 73, 1. 34) or in the sitting position was 0. 78 N (95 % CI: 0. 59, 0. 97). The 95 % CI for the difference of the means was 20. 62 N, 0. 10 N. Thus, the absolute mean difference between the positions can be assumed to be smaller than 0. 62 N. Neither the length of the spinal catheter under the skin or in the subarachnoid space, nor BMI influenced <b>withdrawal</b> <b>force.</b> Conclusion. <b>Withdrawal</b> <b>force</b> of spinal catheters is not influenced by body position during catheter removal, length of catheter under skin, or BMI...|$|R
2500|$|In January 1962, {{even as the}} Chinese Road pact was announced, the Royal Lao Army {{abandoned}} its occupation of Muang Xay, Laos. It withdrew into Luang Namtha, a village with about 1,800 inhabitants located [...] from the Chinese border. The communist troops in the vicinity fired a few mortar rounds into {{the fringes of the}} town. Royalist reinforcements were flown into Luang Namtha over the next few days, including four 105mm howitzers and 12 75mm howitzers. T-6 Harvards from the Royal Lao Air Force were also operating from the unpaved airstrip there. Communist shelling beginning 1 February <b>forced</b> <b>withdrawal</b> of the T-6s to Luang Prabang. The American military attaché at that time deemed the topography of Luang Namtha to be too reminiscent of that around Dien Ben Phu to be defensible.|$|E
2500|$|The draw to {{determine}} the allocation of the participating countries into their respective semi-finals took place at Stockholm City Hall on 25 January 2016, hosted by Alexandra Pascalidou and Jovan Radomir.

The EBU originally announced that the running order would be revealed on 5 April, however for undisclosed reasons this was later put back to 8 April. Eighteen countries participated in the first semi-final, while nineteen countries were planned to participate in the second semi-final, but this was reduced to eighteen on 22 April due to the <b>forced</b> <b>withdrawal</b> of [...] From each semi-final, ten countries joined the [...] "Big 5" [...] and Sweden in the final, where a total of twenty-six countries participated.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was said}} that {{throughout}} these battles, however, Wang was being undermined inside the Later Liang army itself. He had long resented {{what he saw as}} the corrupting influence that Zhu Zhen's brother-in-law Zhao Yan and four brothers/cousins of Zhu Zhen's deceased wife Consort Zhang (including Zhang Hanjie, who was her brother), and had told people, [...] "After I victoriously return, I will kill all the wicked men on the behalf {{of the people of the}} empire." [...] His hatred of them eventually was discovered by Zhao and the Zhangs. Further, Duan was jealous of Wang and wanted to be the commander himself, and therefore formed an alliance with Zhao and the Zhangs, and it {{was said that}} Wang's military campaign was much hampered by this group of internal enemies. After his <b>forced</b> <b>withdrawal</b> from Majiakou, Zhu Zhen believed the false accusations against Wang and relieved him of his command of the main Later Liang army, instead ordering him to rendezvous with Dong Zhang to attack Ze Prefecture (澤州, in modern Jincheng, Shanxi). Zhu Zhen replaced him with Duan, despite the oppositions of senior officials Jing, Li Zhen, and Zhang Zongshi.|$|E

30|$|The first {{possibility}} is that the workers who have left an industrial sector have been marginalized by the rapid changes around them. They may have ended up jobless, either unemployed or even withdrawn from the labor force. Given that the analysis in this paper is restricted to working age individuals, the outcome of labor <b>force</b> <b>withdrawal</b> seems particularly negative. Even if the workers have found new jobs, {{it may be that}} they have joined the ranks of the subsistence farmers who now account for a large fraction of Romanian employment. 8 If the data shows that unemployment, labor <b>force</b> <b>withdrawal,</b> and subsistence farming are the predominant destinations for workers leaving industry, then I would argue that the down-sizing of industry has not been successful in releasing labor to other uses. The outflows would be associated not with reallocation, but with a decline in total employment (ceteris paribus) and with a de-modernization of the Romanian economy.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we compare}} the {{patterns}} of labor <b>force</b> <b>withdrawal</b> of older workers in seven OECD countries. We find wide variation in retirement patterns and recent trends. In Sweden and the United States, for example, it is relatively common for workers to combine retirement benefits and earnings (i. e., to continue working while "retired"), while in Australia, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and (West) Germany, this is much less common. These countries have also had very different experiences in arresting the postwar trend toward earlier retirement. After significant declines prior to 1985, the labor force participation rates of older men in Australia, West Germany and the United States have been almost unchanged, while the pre- 1985 trends have continued unabated in Sweden and Canada. The challenge to researchers is to correlate the diverse public policies in these countries with the very different labor market experiences observed. labor <b>force</b> <b>withdrawal,</b> retirement patterns, cross-country studies...|$|R
2500|$|In foreign policy, {{following}} the September 11, 2001 {{attacks in the}} United States, Blair greatly supported U.S. President George W. Bush's new War on Terror which began with the <b>forced</b> <b>withdrawal</b> of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. Blair's case for the subsequent war in Iraq was based on their alleged possession {{of weapons of mass}} destruction and consequent violation of UN resolutions. He was wary of making direct appeals for regime change, since international law does not recognise this as a ground for war. A memorandum from a July 2002 meeting that was leaked in April 2005 showed that Blair believed that the British public would support regime change in the right political context; the document, however, stated that legal grounds for such action were weak. On 24 September 2002 the Government published a dossier based on the intelligence agencies' assessments of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. Among the items in the dossier was a recently received intelligence report that [...] "the Iraqi military are able to deploy chemical or biological weapons within 45 minutes of an order to do so". A further briefing paper on Iraq's alleged WMDs was issued to journalists in February 2003. This document was discovered to have taken a large part of its text without attribution from a PhD thesis available on the internet. Where the thesis hypothesised about possible WMDs, the Downing Street version presented the ideas as fact. The document subsequently became known as the [...] "Dodgy Dossier".|$|E

But all that should be altered now. Then he had wanted a quick return for his writing. It had piqued him to think that the names of others, his contemporaries, were bruited about the world, but that the world knew nothing of his own.
