40|$|It {{is shown}} that Lewis' ontological {{doctrine}} of Humean supervenience incorporates at its foundation the so-called separability principle of classical physics. In {{view of the}} systematic violation of the latter within quantum mechanics, the claim that contemporary physical science may posit non-supervenient relations beyond the spatiotemporal ones is reinforced on a foundational basis concerning constraints on the state-representation of <b>physical</b> <b>systems.</b> Depending on the mode of assignment of states to <b>physical</b> <b>systems,</b> unit state vectors versus statistical density operators, we distinguish between strongly and weakly non-Humean, non-supervenient relations. It is demonstrated that in either case the relations of quantum entanglement constitute prototypical examples of <b>irreducible</b> <b>physical</b> relations that do not supervene upon a spatiotemporal arrangement of Humean qualities, weakening, thereby, the thesis of Humean supervenience. It is examined, in this respect, the status of Lewis' recombination principle, whereas his conception of lawhood is critically investigated. It is concluded that the assumption of ontological reductionism, as expressed in Lewis' Humean doctrine, cannot {{be regarded as a}} reliable code {{of the nature of the}} physical world and its contents. It is proposed instead that, due to the undeniable existence of non-supervenient relations, a metaphysic of relations of a moderate kind ought to be acknowledged as an indispensable part of our understanding of the natural world at a fundamental level.

40|$|OF THE DISSERTATION Compositional Modeling for Spatial Problems by Kyungsook Han Dissertation Director: Professor Andrew Gelsey Solving {{a problem}} about a complex <b>physical</b> <b>system</b> {{generally}} involves {{the creation and}} execution of a model needed to reason about the problem.

In this paper, we propose a novel representation for developing cybersecurity schemes for <b>physical</b> <b>systems</b> wherein the cyber system states affect the <b>physical</b> <b>system</b> and vice versa. Subsequently by using this representation, an optimal strategy via Q-learning is derived for the cyber defense {{in the presence of}} an attack.

An illustra-tive example is given where the proposed theory is evaluated on the yaw-channel control of an unmanned aerial vehicle.
