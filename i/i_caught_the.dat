500|$|In the verses, Spears is {{flirting with}} a guy, in lyrics such as [...] "Look at you/Look at you/Be my sweetie/Be my honey tonight/Look at you/Look at you/Be my sweetie/Be my honey tonight/'Cause you're beautiful/Drop dead". Sabi rap's also {{alludes to the}} theme of the song, with lines such as [...] "I think I like you/Boy, boy, look at you/I want to get next to you/Got me kind of hot but I ain't {{sweating}} you/Steaming like a pot full of vegetables". Spears references The Notorious B.I.G.'s hit [...] "Hypnotize" [...] in [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful" [...] in the line [...] "You must be B.I.G. because you got me Hypnotized". Spears' vocals on [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful" [...] were deemed as [...] "robotic", but similar to the ones of [...] "Oops!... I Did It Again" [...] (2000). Jocelyn Vena of MTV noted the singer uses her deep vocals in lines such as [...] "And, yeah, your body looks so sick, I think <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> flu" [...] and [...] "You must be B.I.G. 'cause you got me hypnotized".|$|E
2500|$|... "A lot of {{the tension}} in the school came from the class above us," [...] Chad Laughlin states. [...] "There were people fearful of walking by a table where you knew you didn't belong, stuff like that. Certain groups {{certainly}} got preferential treatment across the board. <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> tail end of one really horrible incident, and I know Dylan told his mother that it was the worst day of his life." [...] That incident, according to Laughlin, involved seniors pelting Klebold with [...] "ketchup-covered tampons" [...] in the commons.|$|E
2500|$|Balderstone's next {{club was}} in Scotland. [...] "Queen of the South rang me up. Carlisle {{used to play}} {{practice}} matches against them and they remembered me. <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> train to Dumfries from Leicester every Friday night. It was quite a trek but it gave me another couple of years football." [...] When George Cloy and Crawford Boyd were each later interviewed for the Queen of the South website, each commented on Balderstone's ability with the ball. Cloy in particular said Balderstone's passing ability was the best in Cloy's entire career at Queens.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the opening}} drive {{of the second}} half, the Bills moved the ball 80 yards and scored with Reich's 17-yard {{touchdown}} pass to James Lofton, increasing their lead to 14-3. On the play before the touchdown, Reich had thrown the ball right {{into the hands of}} defensive back Richard Shelton while trying to connect with Beebe, but Shelton dropped the pass, costing his team what would have been an easy touchdown return. [...] "I was just running before <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> ball, and that really hurt", Shelton said after the game. [...] "I could have had six." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> {{sound of}} {{something}} very like a gasp from the Count.|$|E

6000|$|At {{that moment}} <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> sight of Retief riding {{to and fro}} and {{shouting}} out orders. Going to him, <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> him by <b>the</b> sleeve, saying: ...|$|R
60|$|Coming back to <b>the</b> poop <b>I</b> was <b>caught</b> by <b>the</b> {{surprised}} Mr. Mellaire.|$|R
6000|$|... “Very well, Benjamin,” {{said the}} sheriff, writing in his journal; “I believe <b>I</b> have <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> idea. Oh! here’s a cloud over the rising sun—so {{you had it}} hazy in the morning?” ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> {{glitter of}} the gold watch-chain across his chest ever so far away. He {{radiated}} benevolence.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> hint. Mr. Cooke {{had given}} {{out that he}} had started for Saville to restock the larder.|$|E
60|$|As {{he spoke}} <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> {{sound of a}} woman's voice somewhere in the outer {{passages}} of the cave.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> listened, and <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> {{sound of}} a horse's hoofs {{stumbling}} among the rocks.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>caught</b> one <b>the</b> next day, {{one hundred}} and forty-four pounds.

And then, Captain Dan foreshadowing my remarkable finish, exclaimed: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ha! ha! ha!--why, Simpson, {{you have}} an {{astonishing}} tact at making discoveries--original ones, I mean." [...] And here we separated, while one of the trio began humming a gay vaudeville, of which <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> only <b>the</b> lines-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Yes; <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> general drift. It was an entreaty to Siva {{to give us}} some {{glimpse of}} futurity which might benefit us.' ...|$|E
60|$|That made me angry. Jerking up in bed, <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> heavy pitcher {{from the}} wash-stand {{and flung it}} with all my might.|$|E

60|$|If it {{were not}} for Tom! The full burden of the trust began to dawn upon me then. Presently I heard him speaking, but in so low a voice that <b>I</b> hardly <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> words.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Prince Bulbo, {{far from}} {{coming over to}} us, ran away, sir; but <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> him. <b>The</b> Prince is a {{prisoner}} in our army, and the most terrific tortures await him if a hair of the Princess Rosalba's head is injured.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think," [...] {{said the}} photographer, pursing his lips in a pleased smile, [...] "that <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> {{features}} {{just in a}} moment of animation." ...|$|E
60|$|He set {{the candle}} on the table, then {{carrying}} {{his hand to}} his girdle he withdrew it sharply, and <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> gleam of a dagger.|$|E

6000|$|... "You won’t hear of much more," [...] ses the keeper. [...] "I’ve {{invented a}} new way of {{catching}} the dirty rascals; afore I came ’ere <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> all <b>the</b> poachers on three estates. I clear ’em out just like a ferret clears out rats." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ride to meet them, Michelot!" [...] I cried. Obediently he wheeled to the left, and <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> swish of {{his sword}} as {{it left the}} scabbard.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now take him," [...] said SIR WHITE, [...] "Or {{you will}} soon be rueing it; Bless me! I must be right, - <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> fellow doing it!" ...|$|E

60|$|I floated on, and I {{would have}} floated past the Inn, and perhaps {{have gotten into}} the Land of Never-Come-Back-Again, only <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> at <b>the</b> branch of an apple-tree, and so I stopped myself, though the apple-blossoms came falling down like pink and white snowflakes.|$|R
