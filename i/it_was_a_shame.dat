5|$|The Simpson County sheriff moved Dinning to Bowling Green and {{eventually}} to Louisville {{to prevent him from}} being lynched. Governor Bradley dispatched a squad of the state militia to protect him while his trial proceeded. Despite the fact that the case involved a black man killing a white man, most observers believed Dinning would be acquitted on grounds of self-defense. The jury, however, convicted Dinning of manslaughter and sentenced him to seven years of hard labor. Immediately, Bradley's office was flooded with requests for him to intervene on Dinning's behalf. The requests came from blacks and whites, some of them ex-Confederates. Dinning's attorney, Augustus E. Willson, formally requested a pardon, and Bradley issued it 10days after the conviction. Bradley opined that Dinning had acted reasonably under the circumstances and that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> that no members of the mob were charged. After being freed, Dinning relocated to Indiana and hired ex-Confederate Bennett H. Young to file a federal lawsuit against some members of the mob that had identified themselves during his trial. The trial was held in Louisville, and Dinning was awarded $50,000 in damages.|$|E
5|$|At {{a meeting}} with church and cathedral officials, held on 11 June, reporters noted that three people had been shot within {{the city in the}} {{previous}} 72 hours. The attendees produced a letter by the Very Reverend Rogers Govender, on behalf of the Dean and Canons of Manchester Cathedral to Sony. It stated that they were currently seeking the advice of lawyers in the matter, and reserved their legal position in relation to the same. It demanded a substantial donation for the cathedral's work with youth in resisting the culture of gun crime and other forms of violence in our society. It further demanded the immediate withdrawal of the game, and that Sony not re-issue it without removing the section of the game containing the Cathedral interior. Govender described the use of images of the cathedral as virtual desecration. The letter stressed that they were in consultation with their lawyers and urged Sony to contact them so there can be a mutually satisfactory conclusion to the matter. Govender told reporters that the church officials had only been told of the content on 8 June 2007, and, after watching footage of gameplay posted on YouTube, said they were dismayed beyond belief and were shocked to see a place of worship being presented to youths as a place where guns may be fired, and that every year, they invite hundreds of teenagers to see the Cathedral and appreciate it as an alternative to violence. They added that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> to have a game like this undermining such important work. They also sought that Sony apologise unreservedly.|$|E
25|$|In an {{interesting}} postscript, Tewodros II {{is said to}} have disbelieved that Haile Melekot was really dead and demanded that his body be disinterred. When he saw the body of the dead king, the Emperor {{is said to have}} wept for him, saying <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> that illness should deny a brave man such as the King of Shewa, the honor of falling in battle. He ordered that Haile Melekot be re-buried with all the pomp and ceremony due to a king.|$|E

25|$|It was Neil's {{last season}} and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> that his amazing career should end in an uncharacteristic {{outburst}} of bad temper against Ted Dexter. I never did {{get to the bottom}} of the row but perhaps it was just because he and Ted were total opposites as people. All I know is that his press comments on Ted lost him a lot of friends. These attacks upset the MCC players more than anything else that happened on that tour, and for Neil to retire from the game on this sour note was disappointing for those who had played with an against him, and for the public who had enjoyed his performances. For all this, you couldn't help admiring some of Neil's knocks, including his sixth Test century against England. He was nearly always exciting to watch because he was the sort of batsman who was supremely capable of winning or saving a match. He was also good to bowl to because he gave you a chance; he played shots and he took risks. And his fielding was quite brilliant; in this series, it was easily the best on either side. He stopped some wonderful shots in the covers and took some terrific catches. It was just sad to see such a talented man consumed by such bitterness.|$|E
500|$|... "A Quiet Night In" [...] was {{submitted}} to the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA), but was not nominated for a 2015 BAFTA award. In an interview with Digital Spy, Shearsmith said that this surprised him, saying [...] "I was upset, I did think <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> that it's not been recognised. You want people to have seen it and to have recognised the work, and innovation, but I think people are doing that. I get told that every day on Twitter, or in meetings." [...] A number of journalists expressed surprise that Inside No. 9 had received no BAFTA nominations, with Julia Raeside, of The Guardian, describing [...] "A Quiet Night In" [...] as [...] "one of the most inspired pieces of mute theatre I've seen on television".|$|E
500|$|In October 2005, {{work was}} begun {{by a group}} of Ukrainian {{developers}} to port Decay over to Windows, as a modification for both the old World Opponent Network and current Steam versions of Half-Life. The port relied on the discovery of a method that allowed Decays PS2 game files to be deciphered, thereby allowing the files to be ported to Windows. The port went into the beta development stage in December 2007 and was released publicly on September 23, 2008. The port was received well by the journalists in the industry; GameSpy site Planet Half-Life noted that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> that an official PC version of Decay never emerged, while British journalist Alec Meer stated that it was [...] "fantastic to have this short but sweet lost Half-Life episode on PC at last, and it even has something the PS2 version didn't—online play".|$|E

He stated: [...] "I am so disappointed I cannot {{find the words}} to describe how I feel. Up to the pit stop the race was going perfectly for me." [...] Williams technical director Patrick Head was {{not happy with the}} refulling rigs supplied by the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). One of the rigs was sent back to manufacturer Intertechnique who said they could not find any issues with the system. Michael Schumacher, placed fourth before his retirement from a fuel pressure problem on lap 23, shared similar feelings to Montoya: [...] "I am not too disappointed as the situation in the championship remains the same and there is one less race to go. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> not to finish the race and pick up a further six points." ...|$|E
500|$|Breath of Mana is {{a promotional}} album {{of music from}} Dawn of Mana {{included}} with preorders {{of the game in}} Japan. Despite the many composers of the full soundtrack, the five songs on Breath were all composed and arranged by Kenji Ito. Three of the songs, [...] "Breath of MANA", [...] "Unforgotten Memories", and [...] "Rising Sun (piano solo ver.)", did not appear on the full soundtrack album. The songs on the disc are [...] "gentle melodies" [...] using orchestra and piano. The five songs cover a duration of 13:41. The disc was published by Square Enix on December 21, 2006. A review of the album by Dennis Rubinshteyn of RPGFan called it a [...] "good showcase" [...] of the strengths of the full album, which were in his opinion the tracks by Ito. He felt that the tracks on the single were [...] "superb", and said that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> that two of the tracks were not found on the soundtrack album.|$|E
500|$|Since airing, [...] "The One {{with the}} Cast of Night Court" [...] has {{received}} mixed reception from television critics. Nathan Rabin [...] of The A.V. Club {{wrote that the}} episode was [...] "kooky, ooky and over-the-top" [...] and enjoyed every minute of it. [...] "For the more esoteric viewer, it's a milestone episode", said The Ages Farah Farouque. Cameron Adams for the Herald Sun called the episode hilarious, while The Boston Globes Matthew Gilbert {{felt that it was}} flaccid and cliched. IGN contributor Robert Canning said that the episode [...] "did have its moments" [...] and that the storylines [...] "had their potential, and their share of laughs, but I can't help but feel they both could have been so much more." [...] He opined that the Kenneth and Tracy story was [...] "more up 30 Rocks style" [...] but that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> that the story could not [...] "quite knock the concept out of the park." [...] Overall, Canning rated [...] "The One with the Cast of Night Court" [...] a 7.9 out of 10. Jeff Labrecque for Entertainment Weekly reported that the episode fell flat.|$|E

500|$|Reviewing [...] "The Long Game" [...] for The A.V. Club in 2013, Alasdair Wilkins {{gave it a}} {{grade of}} [...] "B-". He found it [...] "inessential" [...] and commented {{that it was not}} very clear on the motives of the Editor and Jagrafess, but Pegg's {{performance}} was almost enough to make up for it. Overall he felt that the story [...] "presents a few too many simple ideas, with the cumulative effect that this is a story that feels slight at best, underdeveloped at worst. The episode is hardly a failure, {{but it could have been}} so much more." [...] In Who Is the Doctor, a guide to the revived series, Graeme Burk described the episode as [...] "entertaining, if unspectacular." [...] He called Pegg the best guest star so far, and stated that Langley did a [...] "superb job" [...] at conveying Adam, but he felt that the episode did not have much else beside the failed companion storyline. Burk criticised the satire for not being subtle enough and borrowing from other stories such as Nineteen Eighty-Four. He also remarked that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> Adam's motives were cut, as well as development between Rose and Adam. Burk's coauthor Robert [...] was more positive, opining that a satire did not have to be subtle to be effective, and that viewers could still relate it to the news media today. He also praised the way [...] "The Long Game" [...] showed the Ninth Doctor as an [...] "inspirational figure." [...] The two also questioned the decision to leave Adam in the 21st century with future technology.|$|E
500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN graded {{the episode}} 8.1 out of 10, calling it [...] "pretty damn busy and quite fun", {{highlighting}} Skye's character {{development and the}} drama it caused, {{as well as the}} connections to [...] "Pilot", as high points of the episode. He praised the [...] "dark, but also necessary" [...] deaths depicted, and concluded that the series [...] "is beginning to build its story in an intriguing way." [...] James Hunt at Den of Geek found the episode to be [...] "mostly, quite good," [...] praising Skye's story, the idea that S.H.I.E.L.D. [...] "might actually be as bad as the people they're trying to fight", and the character of Raina, who he called [...] "the closest thing this series has yet had to an original, interesting idea". Hunt criticized the dialogue, and found the character of Chan Ho Yin to be unrealistic, stating [...] "while I loved the fact that they kind of, sort of, dredged up an actual Marvel character to use in this episode ... <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> that he too bore almost no resemblance to an actual person". The Guardians Graeme Virtue also criticized some of the dialogue, but enjoyed the character of Raina and the potential for her to return. He hoped that now Skye's secret has been revealed, [...] "perhaps some of the other agents will get their time in the spotlight." [...] Marc Bernardin of The Hollywood Reporter decided that the [...] "episode wasn't as good as [...] "Eye Spy"—by the time we got to the last two segments, I really didn’t care what happened to “Scorch,”—but it was still better than the first three. It was all just so very ... perfunctory." ...|$|E

To show that progress was being made, Norfolk started forwarding Grey's dispatches and apologising for his depute's [...] "humour", asking that Elizabeth should send Grey a letter showing her thanks. Norfolk brought in expert military advisors, Sir Richard Lee {{and his own}} cousin Sir George Howard, who Norfolk believed would bring the siege to a rapid conclusion.

2500|$|The Human Torch (Johnny Storm), Sue Storm's younger brother, {{possesses}} {{the ability to}} control fire, allowing him to project fire from his body, as well as the power to fly. This character was loosely based on a Human Torch character published by Marvel's predecessor Timely Comics in the 1940s, an android that could ignite itself. Lee said that when he conceptualized the character, [...] "I thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> that we didn't have The Human Torch anymore, and this was a good chance to bring him back". Unlike the teen sidekicks that preceded him, the Human Torch in the early stories was [...] "a typical adolescent — brash, rebellious, and affectionately obnoxious." [...] Johnny Storm was killed in the 2011 storyline [...] "Three", before being brought back and rejoining the reformed Fantastic Four.|$|E
2500|$|Neela Debnath of The Independent praised Nina Toussaint-White in {{her role}} as Mels, saying she was [...] "every bit as sassy and vivacious as her later incarnation... <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> that she {{regenerated}} so early on because she brought a different energy to the character". However, Neil McCormick in The Daily Telegraph thought that her sudden introduction as Rory and Amy's childhood friend showed that Moffat was making it up as he went along. Charlie Jane Anders of io9 felt that River Song was at her [...] "high point" [...] in some of the early Matt Smith episodes, where she was [...] "generally badass and mysterious". However, with [...] "The Wedding of River Song", Anders felt she had lost her mystery and independence, and her love for the Doctor was unrealistic.|$|E

2500|$|There were {{concerns}} {{about the number of}} steps required by Dukat to attack the wormhole, and it was Ron Moore who suggested the inclusion of the pah-wraiths once more. Echevarria then raised the idea of having Dukat possessed, as seen with Kira and Jake Sisko in [...] "The Reckoning". The scene with Worf {{at the end of the}} episode was kept, and a death chant was written initially in English based upon the Native American chant Only the Earth endures. It was subsequently translated into Klingon for the script, but Behr thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> that the audience would not be able to understand the meaning behind the words. The scene with Sisko and Jadzia's coffin was shot on a closed set, with Avery Brooks being the only actor on set in order to give a sense of intimacy to the proceedings.|$|E
2500|$|Despite her {{prominence}} {{among the}} young musicians of the 1960s and 1970s, and her writing of [...] "Woodstock" [...] (where she was prevented from performing because her manager thought it was more advantageous to appear on The Dick Cavett Show), she did not align herself with the era's protest movements or its cultural manifestations. She {{has said that the}} parents of the boomers were unhappy, and [...] "out of it came this liberated, spoiled, selfish generation into the costume ball of free love, free sex, free music, free, free, free, free we're so free. And Woodstock was the culmination of it." [...] But [...] "I was not a part of that," [...] she explained in an interview. [...] "I was {{not a part of the}} anti-war movement, either. I played in Fort Bragg. I went the Bob Hope route because I had uncles who died in the war, and I thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> to blame the boys who were drafted." [...] Even Bob Dylan, the most iconic musician of the Baby Boom generation, has not escaped Mitchell's generational critique. [...] "I like a lot of Bob's songs.

2500|$|During his Anfield career Hodgson missed {{very few}} games in league or cup and scored prolifically throughout; therefore, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> that his career {{coincided with a}} barren period for the club because his {{contribution}} to the Liverpool cause was massive. [...] The 36 league goals Hodgson scored during the 1930–31 season beat Sam Raybould’s total of 31 scored in 1902–03 and set a new club record that would last for more than thirty years, until it was beaten by Roger Hunt in 1961–62. [...] Hodgson scored three hat-tricks that season at Anfield but {{perhaps it was the}} four goals he scored in an away match at Hillsborough that gave him the most satisfaction of all. [...] He was top scorer in seven out of the nine full seasons he played for Liverpool. [...] On completion of his ten years service he was honoured by the club with a benefit sum of £650. His popularity prompted an ingenious biscuit seller to name the home-made ginger nuts, that he sold in a quantity of five for a penny on matchdays at Anfield, in his honour: [...] "Hodgson’s Choice! Hodgson’s Choice!" [...] he would call. [...] The 1935–36 season proved to be Hodgson's last at Anfield; his 9 goals in 17 league appearances was yet again a decent return, but on 8 January 1936 he was allowed to move to Aston Villa [...] for £4,000. [...] In total Hodgson scored 241 goals in 377 appearances for Liverpool in all competitions, earning him a place in the Liverpool FC Hall of Fame and leaving him third in the all-time list of leading goalscorers for the Anfield club with only Ian Rush (346) and Roger Hunt (285) having scored more.|$|E
