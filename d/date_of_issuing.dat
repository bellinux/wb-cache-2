5000|$|... ==Background== At the {{outbreak}} of the United States Civil War in April 1861, Washington, D.C., was largely undefended, rioters in Baltimore, Maryland threatened to disrupt the reinforcement of the capital by rail, and Congress was not in session. The military situation made it dangerous to call Congress into session. Abraham Lincoln, the president of the United States, therefore authorized his military commanders to suspend the writ of habeas corpus between Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia (and later up through New York City). Numerous individuals were arrested, including John Merryman and a number of Baltimore police commissioners; the administration of justice in Baltimore was carried out through military officials. When Judge William Fell Giles of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland issued a writ of habeas corpus, the commander of Fort McHenry, Major W. W. Morris, wrote in reply, [...] "At the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>issuing</b> your writ, and for two weeks previous, the city in which you live, and where your court has been held, was entirely under the control of revolutionary authorities." ...|$|E
50|$|In another Maryland {{habeas corpus}} case, {{just prior to}} Merryman, Judge William Fell Giles of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland issued a writ of habeas corpus. The {{commander}} of Fort McHenry, Major William W. Morris, wrote in reply, At the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>issuing</b> your writ, and for two weeks previous, the city in which you live, and where your court has been held, was entirely {{under the control of}} revolutionary authorities. Within that period United States soldiers, while committing no offense, had been perfidiously attacked and inhumanly murdered in your streets; no punishment had been awarded, and I believe, no arrests had been made for these atrocious crimes; supplies of provisions intended for this garrison had been stopped; the intention to capture this fort had been boldly proclaimed; your most public thoroughfares were daily patrolled by large numbers of troops, armed and clothed, at least in part, with articles stolen from the United States; and the Federal flag, while waving over the Federal offices, was cut down by some person wearing the uniform of a Maryland officer. To add to the foregoing, an assemblage elected in defiance of law, but claiming to be the legislative body of your State, and so recognized by the Executive of Maryland, was debating the Federal compact. If all this be not rebellion, I know not what to call it. I certainly regard it as sufficient legal cause for suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus.|$|E

40|$|The article {{regards the}} {{position}} of a spouse of a bankrupt consumer during bankruptcy proceeding. The <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>issuing</b> a decision declaring bankruptcy is the date of bankruptcy. From this time matrimonial property regime converts into a compulsory system of separate estates in matrimony. The joint matrimonial estate shall be included in the bankruptcy estate. The rules of management of matrimonial estate are converted. From this moment the course of bankruptcy proceeding depends on the bankrupt spouse’s activity. They can pursue amounts resulting from their share in the joint matrimonial estate, filing the claim with the judge – commissioner. They can also demand exemption from the bankrupt estate assets which do not belong to the bankrupt. Sometimes they do not have any impact on the activity of a bankrupt spouse, for example, they cannot resist the petition to declare bankruptcy. During bankruptcy proceeding a bankrupt spouse is limited in their rights which regard joint matrimonial estate. This situation lasts to the valid conclusion of bankruptcy proceeding. The article emphasizes different depiction of time in the aspect of bankruptcy law. On the one hand, time assigns limits of divagations. During bankruptcy proceeding special rules regarding compulsory matrimonial property regime are in force. On the other hand, time is an impulse of transformation of law and enforcement of new legal institutions such as, for example, an institution of consumer bankruptcy. e. kosior@uwb. edu. plUniwersytet w Białymstoku, Wydział Praw...|$|E
