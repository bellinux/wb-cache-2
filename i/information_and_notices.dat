50|$|Town criers were {{a common}} means of {{conveying}} information to citydwellers. In thirteenth-century Florence, criers known as banditori {{arrived in the}} market regularly, to announce political news, to convoke public meetings, and to call the populace to arms. In 1307 and 1322-1325, laws were established governing their appointment, conduct, and salary. These laws stipulated how many times a banditoro was to repeat a proclamation (forty) and where in the city they were to read them. Different declarations sometimes came with additional protocols; announcements regarding the plague were also to be read at the city gates. These proclamations all used a standard format, beginning with an exordium—"The worshipful and most esteemed gentlemen of the Eight of Ward and Security {{of the city of}} Florence make it known, notify, and expressly command, to whosoever, of whatever status, rank, quality and condition"—and continuing with a statement (narratio), a request made upon the listeners (petitio), and the penalty to be exacted from those who would not comply (peroratio). In addition to major declarations, bandi (announcements) might concern petty crimes, requests for <b>information,</b> <b>and</b> <b>notices</b> about missing slaves. Niccolò Machiavelli was captured by the Medicis in 1513, following a bando calling for his immediate surrender. Some town criers could be paid to include advertising along with news.|$|E

40|$|My thesis {{revolves}} around children's exploration and functioning in their environment. In the theoretical {{part of the}} thesis I presented developmental characteristics {{of children in the}} first age group, the meaning of active learning in the preschool period, the role of an adult and the fundamental knowledge of different materials (paper, cardboard, wood, artificial mass and textile). In the empirical part I carried out an open-ended research. I attempted to establish {{the ways in which the}} children of the first age group explore different materials and gather experience by offering them diverse materials. I concluded that children develop a rich symbolic play with the materials. They are very curious and resourceful. The children were gathering new knowledge and also developing their ability to cooperate in exploring and solving problem situations. I checked the children's knowledge of materials before and after the activities. I carefully examined the gathered pieces of <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>noticed</b> that the children have improved their knowledge in this area.

The inmate told Ballard that he knew {{a man on the}} outside who would do it, upon which Ballard offered to pay the inmate $100,000 in cash and provided him with detailed instructions, such as how it could be done with a high-powered rifle and scope, and even provided a contingency plan of planting a bomb in the judge’s vehicle to the inmate.

BACKGROUND: Both nuclear power plant operational experience and probabilistic risk assessments (PRAs) indicate that the risk associated with low power and shutdown (LPSD) operations could be significant. In {{the past ten years}} important events have occurred and a number of NRC, industry, and international studies have concluded that significant frequencies of reactor core damage could occur from accidents initiated during low power and shutdown (LPSD) operations. This perspective has led to several initiatives to ensure safety during such operations, including: Reactor licensees have developed and applied methods for better managing plant safety during outages. The American Nuclear Society (ANS) has initiated work to develop standards for qualitative and quantitative methods for assessing LPSD risk.

Talking later with his partner Hesam, Peter finds out that some people believe that Peter himself has been causing the accidents, trying to get some glory for himself by saving people. Samuel later breaks into Peter's apartment and uses his ability over ink to insert a picture of himself into the newspaper clipping of the accident, which Peter sees. Peter goes to Samuel and apologizes for injuring him and not believing him about the crash. Samuel is pleased with Peter. He says that he will drop the suit, and shakes Peter's hand. Peter later observes Emma playing beautifully on a cello, and watches her as she runs away afterward. Later, Peter and his partner go to the site of a sinkhole that destroyed a house and killed three people. As Peter looks on, his arm starts to hurt, and he sees a new compass tattoo, spinning wildly.|$|R
