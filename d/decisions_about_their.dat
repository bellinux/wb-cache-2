He believed that within a health system, research should {{be an integral part}} of its mission, especially where lack of commercial interests prevents the possibility of private investment, and that researchers should concentrate on what is relevant to patients, not to their careers or to drug companies.

25|$|In {{terms of}} {{standard}} ethical theory, respecting dignity {{can also be}} aligned with having a respect for people and their autonomous choices.

Amongst other things this grounds the practice of informed consent that should be respected by the nurse, {{although much of the}} debate lies in the discussion of cases where people are unable to make choices about their own treatment due to being incapacitated or having a mental illness that affects their judgement. A suggested way to maintain autonomy is for the person to write an advance directive, outlining how they wish to be treated in the event of their inability to make an informed choice, thus avoiding unwarranted paternalism.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, Bloomberg {{received}} a Healthy Communities Leadership Award from Leadership for Healthy Communities – a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation national program – for his {{policies and programs}} that increase access to healthful foods and physical activity options in the city.

His administration also created a Healthy Bodega initiative, which provides healthful food samples and promotional support to grocers in lower-income areas {{to encourage them to}} carry one-percent milk and fruits and vegetables. Under Bloomberg's leadership, the city passed a Green Carts bill, which supports mobile produce vendors in lower-income areas; expanded farmers' markets using the city's Health Bucks program which provides coupons to eligible individuals to buy produce at farmers' markets in lower-income areas; and committed $111 million in capital funding for playground improvements.

40|$|In {{order to}} achieve an {{efficient}} energy consumption level in the residential sector of a smart grid, the end-users are equipped with various smart home energy controller technologies.

We propose that the energy home controllers should offer preferred and optimal scenarios to support end-users when making a <b>decision</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> consumption. Effective scenarios should emerge from consumer's life style and preferences. In this paper, we will apply AHP methodology to quantify the consumer's preferences for using appliances during peak periods when the price has increased, and use the Knapsack problem approach to achieve the optimal solution for managing the appliances. With this approach, not only will the cost of electricity not escalate during peak hours, but also user preferences, satisfaction and minimum change to current life style will be considered...|$|R
