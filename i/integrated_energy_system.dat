40|$|The {{combustion}} {{of fossil}} fuels {{for the production of}} energy has already resulted in significant modifications of the earth's environment, primarily through the emissions of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulates. The modern world primary energy consumption patterns and its trends lead to the utilization of dirtier and more expensive fossil fuels. The desire to protect the environment is contradictory Lo such structural changes in energy like the broader use of coal as substitution for liquid fuels, taking into account the depletion of coal deposits with low sulfur contents. Previous studies carried out at IIASA, in the FRG, the US, the USSR and other countries, formulate one long-term technological strategy that might limit pollutant emissions sufficiently to permit an efficient and ecologically sustainable development of the world's energy consumption patterns. This technological strategy is based on the implementation of the so-called <b>Integrated</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>Systems</b> (IES) or <b>Integrated</b> Energy-Chemical Systems (IECS). The basic idea of IES incorporates the decomposition and purification of primary fossil energy inputs before combustion, the integration of these decomposed (clean) products and the allocation of them in line with the requirements for final <b>energy.</b> Thus, <b>Integrated</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>Systems</b> represent a concept for providing a flexible range of final energy forms from varying inputs of different primary energy sources. Other potential advantages include improved performance of the whole <b>energy</b> <b>system,</b> such as higher efficiencies and lower environmental impacts.

A MARKAL-based model for an <b>integrated</b> <b>energy</b> <b>system</b> of Laos and Thailand was developed to assess the effects of energy resource development and trade to meet the national energy demands of the two countries. Two national MARKAL-based energy system models of Laos and Thailand were formulated for the study.
