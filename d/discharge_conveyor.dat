50|$|Crushing at {{the actual}} {{construction}} site using portable crushers reduces construction {{costs and the}} pollution generated when compared with transporting material to and from a quarry. Large road-portable plants can crush concrete and asphalt rubble at 600 tons per hour or more. These systems normally consist of a rubble crusher, side <b>discharge</b> <b>conveyor,</b> screening plant, and a return conveyor from the screen to the crusher inlet for reprocessing oversize materials. Compact, self-contained mini-crushers are also available that can handle up to 150 tons per hour and fit into tighter areas. With the advent of crusher attachments - those connected to various construction equipment, such as excavators - the trend towards recycling on-site with smaller volumes of material is growing rapidly. These attachments encompass volumes of 100 tons/hour and less.|$|E
40|$|Approximately {{ten million}} tons of waste {{bituminous}} roofing are torn off annually in the United States. This volume {{is a major factor}} in the rapid filling of landfills. In 1995, Benton County, Iowa initiated a program to cost effectively recycle torn off waste shingles. Nine hundred tons of waste shingles were ground using a Maxigrind. A magnetic roller on the <b>discharge</b> <b>conveyor</b> removed most of the nails. Five hundred tons of the ground waste shingles were blade mixed into 0. 6 km (0. 4 mi) of a crushed stone granular surfaced Benton County rural secondary roadway. A magnet attached to the motor grader removed another 1 / 3 kg (3 / 4 lb) of nails during the spreading and mixing operation on the 0. 6 km (0. 4 mi) section of roadway. The bitumen of the waste shingles was very effective in providing a dust free granular surfaced roadway. It remains relatively dust free one year after treatment...|$|E
50|$|The {{stripping}} machines included receiving and <b>discharge</b> <b>conveyors,</b> washing, separation, cathode stacking and discharging, {{cathode plate}} separation for refurbishing, and the wax {{applications for the}} sides and bottoms of the cathode plates. The original CRL stripping machine had the capability of stripping 250 cathode plates per hour.|$|R
50|$|In {{conveyor}} decanter centrifuges {{the conveyor}} or scroll fits inside a rotating bowl and carries the solids settled against the wall, pushing them across a beach towards the underflow where the solids <b>discharge.</b> The <b>conveyor</b> allows {{for an increase}} in separation efficiency and feed capacity.|$|R
50|$|More modern systems adopt a {{continuous}} removal philosophy. Essentially, a heavy duty chain conveyor (SSC) submerged {{in a water}} bath below the furnace which quenches hot ash as it falls from the combustion chamber and removes the wet ash continuously up to a de-watering slope before onward <b>discharge</b> into mechanical <b>conveyors</b> or directly to storage silos.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe paper {{presents}} {{the analysis of}} the condition of the flow of cohesionless and cohesive bulk solids in a <b>conveyor</b> <b>discharge</b> point of a descending belt. The analysis was carried out for stationary flows at high velocities. It presents mathematical methods of description of the velocity of materials leaving a <b>conveyor</b> <b>discharge</b> point with a descending conveyor belt, as well as final equations which enable the determination of the velocity of material after it has left the discharge point, with the accuracy sufficient for practical use. Next, the obtained mathematical descriptions for the mentioned material groups have been compared. The usefulness of the equations in determining the velocity of the material beyond the point, which enable to omit the indirect equations, has been demonstrated. Finally, the difference between the values of the velocities obtained with the proposed and indirect equations as well as the relative error for the proposed method have been calculated...|$|R
5000|$|At the {{south-east}} of the site, {{with its}} top about 16 m above {{the level of}} the base of the kilns, is the primary chalk crusher. This was accessible to the lorries bringing chalk down from the chalk pit. The crusher was electrically driven, and was fed from a hopper into the rotating teeth. The crusher <b>discharged</b> onto a <b>conveyor</b> belt which transferred the chalk to the intermediate chalk crusher.|$|R
50|$|Screen scroll {{centrifuge}} is a filtering or screen centrifuge {{which is}} also known as worm screen or <b>conveyor</b> <b>discharge</b> centrifuge. This centrifuge was first introduced in the midst of 19th century. After developing new technologies over the decades, it {{is now one of the}} widely used processes in many industries for the separation of crystalline, granular or fibrous materials from a solid-liquid mixture. Also, this process is considered to dry the solid material. This process has been some of the most frequently seen within, especially, coal preparation industry. Moreover, it can be found in other industries such as chemical, environmental, food and other mining fields.|$|R
5000|$|The bulk coal {{terminal}} discharges {{imported coal}} {{from both the}} Royal Edward and Royal Portbury docks, via a rail-loading system managed by DB Schenker Rail (UK), located just south of St Andrews Road railway station on the Severn Beach Line. At the Royal Edward, a Gottwald HSK 260 Harbour Crane can unload up to 10,000 tonnes of coal per day; whilst two 2,500 tonne rapid bulk-handling conveyors at Royal Portbury <b>discharge</b> into a <b>conveyor</b> system which runs under the River Avon in a tunnel. Freight trains are moved automatically under the bunkers at 0.8 km/h, allowing a [...] train to be fully and automatically loaded in under 36 minutes.|$|R
50|$|Screen scroll centrifuges, {{which are}} also known as worm screen or the <b>conveyor</b> <b>discharge,</b> {{instigate}} the solids to move along the cone through an internal screw conveyor. The conveyor in the centrifuge spins at a differential speed to the conical screen and centrifugal forces approximately 1800g - 2600g facilitate reasonable throughputs. Some of the screen scroll centrifuges are available with up to four separate stages for improved performance. The first stage is used to de-liquor the feed which {{is followed by a}} washing stage, with the final stage being used for drying. In an advanced screen scroll centrifuge with four stages, two separate washes are employed in order to segregate the wash liquors.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a theory, combined with design equations, {{to compute the}} loads on structural elements, in particular those of trestle legs of tubular construction supporting load-out belt conveyors, where the trestle legs are substantially buried in gravity reclaim stockpiles. The stress conditions, both active and passive, that arise during filling and reclaim are examined {{taking into account the}} position of the trestle supports with respect to the load out <b>conveyor</b> <b>discharge</b> during filling, and reclaim hoppers during draw-down. The theory examines the various loading conditions due to the stored bulk solids focusing on the determination of the lateral or bending load distribution on the trestle support legs. The compressive, in-plane shear traction loads which may influence the buckling effect in the buried legs are also examined...|$|R
40|$|Abstract â€” Drag {{conveyors}} are {{the most}} efficient medium of material handling for conveying higher volume {{from one place to}} another. In horizontal condition drag chain conveyors can handle material up to 45 - 50 % of cross sectional area of the trough. In between the drive and non drive ends of drag conveyor an endless chain, having wide links carrying projection or wings are drags a bed of bulk material from feeding end to <b>discharge</b> end. Drag <b>conveyor</b> chains are work under the very extreme conditions such as high tensile load, friction and some time hazardous operating environment (e. g. presence of humidity, chemicals). Due to versatile application various failures are occurred in the drag conveyor chain and causes loss of productivity and corrective maintenance in the system. In this paper we emphasis on appropriate design changes by which can reduce cost of drag conveyor chain and enhance the performance...|$|R
