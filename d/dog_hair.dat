They also used <b>dog</b> <b>hair,</b> especially the long tail hairs of the Tuamotuan varieties of dogs, to decorate the fringes of the taumi – a traditional breast ornament often called a gorget – which were worn by priests and high chiefs. The Tuamotuan breed were described as similar to their Tahitian counterparts distinguishable by their longer hair. Historian Margaret Titcomb noted that Tuamotuan varieties may not have been a separate breed that developed in isolation, arguing that the people of the Tuamotus could have eaten their short hair varieties and kept their longer haired dogs for exports to the Society Islands.|$|E
25|$|A {{task force}} {{was formed to}} proceed with what was now a murder case and several leads were investigated, such as an ex-boyfriend of Karyn's {{as well as her}} ex-husband Michael. An autopsy of Karyn's body showed that Karyn had been shot six times, once {{in the back of the}} head and an {{additional}} five times in the forehead, before being dismembered and the body parts placed in the plastic bags. Police found several strands of <b>dog</b> <b>hair</b> on the duct tape and remnants of cinders and tall grass. Swann was suspected of the crime as his alibi initially did not cover him for a forty-minute period. Investigators were also suspicious of several actions that Swann had performed during the initial search for Karyn and because he owned a handgun matching the type that had shot Karyn. Swann participated with police during a search warrant and was eventually cleared of suspicion after footage from an ATM surveillance video cleared him for the missing 40 minutes of his alibi. Alibis for other suspects such as Michael Jr and Karyn's ex-boyfriend also ruled them out as suspects.|$|E

Tom Ryan of WhatCulture rated the episode {{two and a}} half out of five stars, summing up the review with; [...] "Given the popularity of the original book and the success thus far of the current TV series, it is safe to assume that last nights episode was perhaps the most eagerly anticipated installment of the show since its inception. Too bad then that it was so underwhelming." [...] The Guardian writer Stuart Heritage stated; [...] "Last night's Hounds of Baskervilles wasn't quite as rapturously received as other adventures, perhaps because of {{the amount of time that}} Cumberbatch and Freeman spent apart. The whole middle section, where Watson stormed off in a huff after being subjected to another one of Sherlock's baroque [...] "that man is left-handed and also has <b>dog</b> <b>hair</b> on one of his socks" [...] monologues, felt slow and flat precisely because there was none of the chemistry between the two leads that we've come to expect from Sherlock." [...] Jim Shelley of the Daily Mirror stated that the episode was [...] "a disappointment," [...] adding that the contrasting reveal of the hound from the original book was [...] "a tedious treatise against vivisection."

Difference between two species was analyzed using three types of microscope; compound microscope, stereomicroscope, and scanning electron microscope. Numerical morphology employ six measurements on hair samples which are (length, (Len), maximum width (MaxWid), medulla width (MedWid), width at 1 / 3 of proximal hair shaft (proWid), medullary index (MI) and hair width index (HWI).

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to analyse possibilities of making different woollen blend yarns with sheep’s wool and <b>dog’s</b> <b>hair</b> fibers and to investigate geometrical and mechanical properties of these yarns. In this paper sheep’s wool and dogs’ hair fibers were compared one with other in different geometrical (fibre surface, length, diameter, linear density) and mechanical (breaking tenacity, elongation at break, breaking toughness) properties. It was estimated that the sheep’s and the dog’s fibers are visually very different, they have various types of scales, also most of the <b>dog’s</b> <b>hair</b> have channels inside them. On the next stage of this work the woollen blend yarns were made by mixing the wool of German Blackface sheep with different breed (English Spaniel, Poodle, Yorkshire Terrier) dogs’ hair 15  %, 25  % and 35  %. After evaluating the linear density and mechanical properties of woollen blend yarns, it was estimated that influence of fiber composition in the yarns on these properties is different. Different values of the investigated properties are mostly influenced by spinning system of these yarns. The condenser spinning system affects inequality and unpredictable properties of woollen blend yarns. Also, obtained results depend on the breed of protein fibers, hairy surface, hollow structure and bending rigidity of fiber, the technological process or even compatibility of used devices.
