50|$|White-winged {{wood duck}} (Cairina scutulata), an {{endangered}} species of forest duck, and the sarus crane (Grus antigone) are native to the Shweli river. The gharial (<b>Gavialis</b> <b>gangeticus),</b> a crocodilian, was last spotted in 1927. The Irrawaddy dolphin {{has been known to}} reach the upper tributaries of the Ayeyarwady including the Shweli.|$|R
25|$|Some {{reptiles}} are predators too, {{including two}} species of crocodiles, the saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) and mugger crocodile (Crocodylus palustris), {{as well as the}} gharial (<b>Gavialis</b> <b>gangeticus)</b> and the water monitor lizards (Varanus salvator), all of which hunt on both land and water. Sharks and the Gangetic dolphins (Platanista gangetica) roam the waterways.|$|R
50|$|Major attractions are Gangetic Dolphins (known as Soons by Locals) {{which are}} {{classified}} as Endangered on the 2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and included in Schedule-I of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.The Sanctuary also contains rich diversity of other threatened aquatic wildlife, including the Indian smooth-coated otter (Lutrogale perspicillata), gharial (<b>Gavialis</b> <b>gangeticus),</b> a variety of freshwater turtles, and 135 species of waterfowl.|$|R
50|$|Due to its {{proximity}} to the Sanjay Gandhi National Park, the campus has significant green cover and is mostly untouched by the pollution {{of the rest of}} the city. The proximity of the campus to the national park has also led to occasional sightings of panthers, Leopards and Gharial (<b>Gavialis</b> <b>gangeticus)</b> crocodiles along the banks of Lake Powai. Sometimes they stray into the campus in chase of hunt.|$|R
50|$|The Gharial (<b>Gavialis</b> <b>gangeticus)</b> {{was once}} found {{in great numbers}} in the Indus river system before its {{population}} dwindled {{and it is now}} classified as Critically Endangered in the International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) Red List of Endangered Species. The Punjab Government is now planning to release 10 gharials in the Harike Wetlands as the first step to increase their numbers and to attract more tourists.|$|R
50|$|The gharial (<b>Gavialis</b> <b>gangeticus),</b> {{also known}} as the gavial, and the {{fish-eating}} crocodile, is a crocodilian of the family Gavialidae, native to {{the northern part of the}} Indian Subcontinent. The global wild gharial population is estimated at fewer than 235 individuals, which are threatened by loss of riverine habitat, depletion of fish resources, and entanglement in fishing nets. As the population has declined drastically in the past 70 years, the gharial is listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List.|$|R
50|$|Gryposuchinae {{was named}} in 2007 as a {{subfamily}} of closely related gavialid crocodilians. It {{was defined as}} a stem-based taxon including Gryposuchus jessei and all crocodilians more closely related to it than to <b>Gavialis</b> <b>gangeticus</b> (the gharial) or Tomistoma schlegelii (the False gharial). Other gavialoids from the Americas include thoracosaurs from the Late Cretaceous and Paleocene and long-snouted tomistomines from the Eocene, but neither of these groups are closely related to gryposuchines. The relationship of tomistomines in particular is unclear, as they have also been classified as crocodiles.|$|R
50|$|The {{sanctuary}} is a 50 km {{stretch of}} the river Ganga from Sultanganj to Kahalgaon. Gangetic dolphins are the major attraction of the sanctuary.

Take the boat ride in the 50 km {{stretch of the}} Vikramshila sanctuary and you will definitely come across several Gangetic dolphins in the region. For dolphin sightings the best time to visit Vikramshila Sanctuary is June and October. There is other wildlife at the Vikramshila. several species of freshwater turtles, waterfowl, otter and <b>Gavialis</b> <b>gangeticus.</b>|$|R
50|$|National Chambal (Gharial) Wildlife Sanctuary: The Chambal river {{remains one}} of north India's most unpolluted rivers, home to a rich {{diversity}} of flora and fauna. National Chambal (Gharial) Wildlife Sanctuary contains the rare Ganges river dolphin. The sanctuary was founded in 1978 and {{is part of a}} large area co-administered by Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, within area of 5,400 km². Approximately 400 km of the river is within the reserve. Apart from the Ganges river dolphin, the other inhabitants of the sanctuary include mugger crocodiles and gharial (<b>Gavialis</b> <b>gangeticus).</b> Migratory birds from Siberia form its rich avian fauna.|$|R
50|$|Gavialidae is {{a family}} of {{reptiles}} within the order Crocodilia. Gavialidae have conventionally consisted of only one surviving species, the gharial (<b>Gavialis</b> <b>gangeticus),</b> which is native to India and Nepal. Many extinct species are also known. The false gharial (Tomistoma schlegelii) has usually been {{thought to be a}} member of the family Crocodylidae based on several characters including skull morphology, but has sometimes been viewed as a member of this family due to general similarities in morphology and habit. However, numerous molecular studies have consistently shown the two species to be very closely related, supporting the view that they are in the same family.|$|R
50|$|Among {{crocodilians}} {{and certain}} lizards, {{there is a}} much greater interaction between members. Young will be guarded and defended for a considerable period of time. Crocodilians of both sexes carry and assist young hatchlings to the water and guard them. The gharial (<b>Gavialis</b> <b>gangeticus)</b> has to nudge young to the water because their teeth are too sharp to carry them. Sub-adult members of a crocodilian social group will often stand by a female laying eggs or retrieving young from a nest to keep predators away. The female Asian forest tortoise (Manouria emys) {{has been reported to}} guard a nest site for a short period after egg laying but this instinct is very short lived.|$|R
50|$|Gavialis is a genus of crocodylians that {{includes}} the living gharial <b>Gavialis</b> <b>gangeticus</b> and several extinct species, including Gavialis bengawanicus, Gavialis breviceps, Gavialis browni, Gavialis curvirostris, Gavialis hysudricus, Gavialis leptodus, Gavialis lewisi, and Gavialis pachyrhynchus. Most species, including G. gangeticus, come from the Indian Subcontinent, while G. bengawanicus is known from Java. Gavialis likely {{first appeared in the}} Indian Subcontinent in the early Miocene around 20 million years ago and dispersed into the Malay Archipelago through a path called the Siva-Malayan route in the Quaternary. Remains attributed to Gavialis have also been found on Sulawesi and Woodlark Island east of the Wallace Line, suggesting a prehistoric lineage of Gavialis was able to traverse marine environments and reach places possibly as far as western Oceania.|$|R
40|$|A herpetofaunal {{inventory}} {{based on}} field surveys, literature records and photographic records is presented for Katerniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary and its environs, {{situated in the}} Terai region of Uttar Pradesh, India. We list a total of 10 species of amphibians and 42 species of reptiles from the area. Compiled observations presented here include biological notes on the Critically Endangered <b>Gavialis</b> <b>gangeticus</b> and new locality records and natural history information of poorly known species including Polypedates taeniatus and Sibynophis sagittarius. Besides recording members of currently recognized species complexes, the study also documents species that were either conferred to closely related species (e. g., Fejervarya cf. teraiensis) or their identity remains to be ascertained (e. g., Kaloula sp.). The present study indicates that species count at Katerniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary {{is likely to increase}} with additional surveys and systematic work...|$|R
40|$|During {{thirty years}} of {{observation}} from 1984 sighting of mugger crocodiles (Crocodylus palustris) have increased more than 12 -times from 33 and their spatial distribution have expanded to the entire river in National Chambal Gharial Sanctuary (NCS). In this period sighting of gharial has increased less than two-fold from 605. Reducing water level in upper reaches of Chambal and certain or several other critical changes in the habitat prior to 2008 - 09 may have triggered and intensified ecological and behavioural changes. As a result, from 2011 onwards sighting of mugger crocodiles in the stretch of river downstream of Rajghat have surpassed sightings in {{upper reaches of the}} river. The programme on conservation of gharial (<b>Gavialis</b> <b>gangeticus)</b> in river Chambal, now over 35 years, warrants review and fresh planning because of intensified human dimensions and threat from the fast-growing population of mugger crocodiles...|$|R
40|$|The Indian gharial (<b>Gavialis</b> <b>gangeticus)</b> is {{not found}} in saltwater, but the {{geographical}} distribution of fossil relatives suggests a derivation from ancestors that lived in, or were at least able to withstand, saline conditions. Here, we describe a new Oligocene gharial, Aktiogavialis puertoricensis, from deltaic–coastal deposits of northern Puerto Rico. It is related to a clade of Neogene gharials otherwise restricted to South America. Its geological and geographical settings, along with its phylogenetic relationships, are consistent with two scenarios: (i) that a single trans-Atlantic dispersal event during the Tertiary explains the South American Neogene gharial assemblage and (ii) that stem gharials were coastal animals and their current restriction to freshwater settings is a comparatively recent environmental shift for the group. This discovery {{highlights the importance of}} including fossil information in a phylogenetic context when assessing the ecological history of modern organisms...|$|R
25|$|The main {{sections}} of the Ganges River are home to the gharial (<b>Gavialis</b> <b>gangeticus)</b> and mugger crocodile (Crocodylus palustris), and the delta {{is home to the}} saltwater crocodile (C. porosus). Among the numerous aquatic and semi-aquatic turtles in the Ganges basin are the northern river terrapin (Batagur baska; only in the lowermost section of the basin), three-striped roofed turtle (B. dhongoka), red-crowned roofed turtle (B. kachuga), black pond turtle (Geoclemys hamiltonii), Brahminy river turtle (Hardella thurjii), Indian black turtle (Melanochelys trijuga), Indian eyed turtle (Morenia petersi), brown roofed turtle (Pangshura smithii), Indian roofed turtle (Pangshura tecta), Indian tent turtle (Pangshura tentoria), Indian flapshell turtle (Lissemys punctata), Indian narrow-headed softshell turtle (Chitra indica), Indian softshell turtle (Nilssonia gangetica), Indian peacock softshell turtle (N. hurum) and Cantor's giant softshell turtle (Pelochelys cantorii; only in the lowermost section of Ganges basin). Most of these are seriously threatened.|$|R
30|$|Katerniaghat {{is located}} near the Indo-Nepal border of India in the Bahraich {{district}} of Uttar Pradesh and is a sensitive ecosystem spread over an area of approximately 440  km 2 with sal (Shorea robusta) and teak (Tectona grandis) forests, lush grasslands, and wetlands along with the ever flowing Ghaghara river. Girwa River is small tributary and is passed through a jungle known as the ‘Katerniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary’. Gharials (<b>Gavialis</b> <b>gangeticus)</b> and Muggar (Crocodile) are seen with basking at the sand bars on every side of the active river channel. Katerniaghat Wildlife sanctuary is an important breeding area of the Ghariyal which builds its nests on the sandbars. Turtle of many species will also be visible basking in the sand. There are several Gangetic Dolphin (Platanista gangetica) visible with jumping within {{the water of the}} river Ghaghara. As Census of India (2011), Baharaich had a population of 3, 478, 275.|$|R
25|$|Large-scale {{commercial}} {{hunting of}} Indian crocodilians for their skin began {{towards the end}} of the 19th century, and by the 1970s, crocodile populations were severely depleted. The Madras Crocodile Bank was conceived in 1973 and started on 26 August 1976 by herpetologist Romulus Whitaker and his wife Zai Whitaker at the time when the Indian government protected all three species of Indian crocodilians under the Wild Life Protection Act of 1972. The real push for captive breeding of crocodiles came after the launch of the Indian Crocodile Conservation Project by the Indian government in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) in 1975. The bank was started to protect India's dwindling crocodile population and to preserve the art of snake catching. Along with other like-minded people such as Rajamani, Whitaker founded the bank to conserve the three species of reptiles namely, the mugger (Crocodylus palustris), the gharial (<b>Gavialis</b> <b>gangeticus),</b> and the saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus).|$|R
50|$|Gavialis browni is an {{extinct species}} of the crocodylian genus Gavialis and a close {{relative}} of the living gharial <b>Gavialis</b> <b>gangeticus.</b> G. browni lived about 5 million {{years ago in the}} Sivalik Hills of Pakistan. G. browni can be distinguished from G. gangeticus by its more closely spaced eyes and a narrower frontal bone. The species was named in 1932 by paleontologist Charles Mook. Mook described it as a transitional form between the most primitive Gavialis species, Gavialis dixoni, and the most advanced, the modern gharial (although G. dixoni is now placed outside Gavialis in its own genus, Dollosuchus, and may be more closely related to crocodiles than to the gharial). G. browni has a longer snout with more teeth than Dollosuchus, but it is not as long and does not have as many teeth as that of the gharial. G. browni has also been proposed to be moved to a genus other than Gavialis.|$|R
40|$|Pages 5 - 17 (Report) The {{activity}} pattern, behavioural {{activity and}} interspecific interactions of smooth-coated otter (Lutrogale perspicillata) with crocodilians viz. gharial (<b>Gavialis</b> <b>gangeticus)</b> and mugger (Crocodylus palustris) was examined by monitoring four radio-implanted otters in the National Chambal Sanctuary, India. Based on {{the percentage of}} active telemetry recordings, the observed overall activity patterns of otters were {{in the form of}} a bimodal curve in which two periods of high activity were separated by a period of relative inactivity. In summer, the relative period of inactivity was greater than the winter and monsoons. Otters were more diurnal during winter than in summer or monsoon. Travelling and grooming were the most prevalent activities recorded during 422 sightings. Though the habitats and the diet of otters overlapped with gharial and mugger, their diurnal activity pattern was different and spatially they maintained a mutually agreeable strategy to avoid conflicts in sharing resources for basking and grooming...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Based on {{morphological}} analyses, extant {{members of}} the orderCrocodylia are divided into three families, Alligatoridae, Crocodylidae, and Gavialidae. Gavialidae includes one species, the gharial, <b>Gavialis</b> <b>gangeticus.</b> In this study we have examined crocodilian relationships in phylogenetic analyses of seven mito-chondrial genomes that have been sequenced in their entirety. The analyses {{did not support the}} morpho-logically acknowledged separate position of the gharial in the crocodilian tree. Instead the gharial joined the false gharial (Tomistoma schlegelii) on a common branch that was shown to constitute a sister group to traditional Crocodylidae (less Tomistoma). Thus, the analyses suggest the recognition of only two Croco-dylia families, Alligatoridae and Crocodylidae, with the latter encompassing traditional Crocodylidae plus Gavialis/Tomistoma. A molecular dating of the diver-gence between Alligatoridae and Crocodylidae sug-gests that this basal split among recent crocodilians took place 140 million years before present, at the Jurassic/Cretaceous boundary. The results suggest that at least five crocodilian lineages survived the mass extinction at the KT boundary...|$|R
40|$|Among {{the fossil}} {{vertebrates}} collected by Barnum Brown from the sediments of the Siwalik formation in 1922, is a well-preserved gavialoid crocodilian skull. This skull is practically complete, {{except for the}} pre-maxillary region, which is missing. Its horizon is lower middle Siwalik, which makes it Lower Pliocene, according to Dr. Matthew's 1929 cor-relation (p. 441, fig. 1). Ten teeth are preserved, and the alveoli of {{nearly all of the}} rest in the portion of the skull preserved are clearly indicated. The locality is one mile south of Nathot, India. The characters of this skull indicate that it belonged to a species quite distinct from the living gavial of the Gangetic region (<b>Gavialis</b> <b>gangeticus),</b> from the various Siwalik species of gavials described by Falconer, Cautley, and Pilgrim, and from G. dixoni Owen, of the Eocene of Europe. Comparison with G. bahiensis Marsh is not possible at the present time. This species is given the name Gavialis browni in honor of Mr. Brown, who collected the type skull...|$|R

50|$|The mugger {{crocodile}} is a freshwater species found in lakes, rivers and marshes. Muggers prefer slow-moving, shallower {{bodies of water}} rather than, fast-flowing, deep areas. They are also known to thrive in man-made reservoirs and irrigation canals. Although it prefers freshwater, it has some tolerance to saltwater therefore is occasionally reported from saltwater lagoons. It is sympatric with the gharial (<b>Gavialis</b> <b>gangeticus)</b> {{in some areas of}} India and Nepal and with the saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) in other areas, but separated by habitat most of the time. It is adapted to terrestrial life like its cousin, the Cuban crocodile, more than most crocodilians, but is ecologically most similar to the African Nile crocodile. It is known to be more mobile on land, can migrate considerable distances over land in search of a more suitable habitat. It can chase prey on land for short distances. They are also known to dig burrows as shelters during the dry seasons.|$|R
50|$|Captive {{breeding}} {{units of}} all the three crocodilian species have been established at Nandankanan Zoo. In 1980, the gharial (<b>Gavialis</b> <b>gangeticus)</b> was bred in captivity {{for the first time}} at the Nandankanan Biological Park in Odisha. This successful effort involved the collaboration and coordination between international and national zoological parks. The male came from the Frankfurt zoo and the females were from the Nandankanan and Trivandrum zoos. A large part of the credit for this first time ex-situ breeding in captivity goes to the meticulous planning and designing of the breeding enclosure at the Nandankanan Zoo by Dr. H. R. Bustard, which simulates the gharial's natural habitat of a deep flowing river with adequate high-rise sandbanks. The breeding enclosure, together with a judicious mix of adult size classes to from a social group, minimal disturbance and provision of natural food culminated in that success story, which continues to the present date. The Nandankanan Biological park has since provided many zoos around the world with captive-bred gharials for display and education. Muggers bred at Nandankanan Zoo have also been released in Satkosia Gorge.|$|R
40|$|Proctocaecum gairhei n. sp. is {{described}} from the gharial <b>Gavialis</b> <b>gangeticus</b> (Gmelin) in Nepal. The new taxon {{can be distinguished}} from all other species of Proctocaecum Baugh, 1957 by {{the combination of the}} following morphological characters: a single row of 23 cephalic spines, lateral anal pores opening at uneven levels, a forebody accounting for 16 % of the total body length (TBL), an oral to ventral sucker width ratio of 1 : 0. 7, an oral sucker to pharynx width ratio of 1 : 0. 6 and uterine loops that occupy 59 – 67 % of the TBL. While sharing some morphological characteristics with Acanthostomum slusarskii Kalyankar, 1977 from Crocodylus palustris (Lesson) in India, P. gairhei n. sp. is distinguished from the latter by possessing the solid muscular gonotyl diagnostic for Proctocaecum, by the number of cephalic spines, position of the anal pores and egg size. The existing cladogram for Proctocaecum was expanded using the character information of P. gairhei n. sp. The host range of Proctocaecum is now known to include all three families of the order Crocodylia...|$|R
40|$|To provide {{context for}} the {{diversification}} of archosaurs [...] the group that includes crocodilians, dinosaurs, and birds [...] we generated draft genomes of three crocodilians: Alligator mississippiensis (the American alligator), Crocodylus porosus (the saltwater crocodile), and <b>Gavialis</b> <b>gangeticus</b> (the Indian gharial). We observed an exceptionally slow rate of genome evolution within crocodilians at all levels, including nucleotide substitutions, indels, transposable element content and movement, gene family evolution, and chromosomal synteny. When placed {{within the context of}} related taxa including birds and turtles, this suggests that the common ancestor of all of these taxa also exhibited slow genome evolution and that the comparatively rapid evolution is derived in birds. The data also provided the opportunity to analyze heterozygosity in crocodilians, which indicates a likely reduction in population size for all three taxa through the Pleistocene. Finally, these data combined with newly published bird genomes allowed us to reconstruct the partial genome of the common ancestor of archosaurs, thereby providing a tool to investigate the genetic starting material of crocodilians, birds, and dinosaurs...|$|R
25|$|The {{forest cover}} of the {{district}} has dwindled with increasing use of land for agriculture. There are areas with high prevalence of mango (Mangifera indica), mahua (Madhuca longifolia), sal (Shorea robusta), and bamboo (Bambusa arundinacea) trees. Some of the wild animals of the district are the nilgai (Boselaphus tragocamelus), antelok (Anelok cervicapra), pig (Sus scrofa), wolf (Canis lupus), jackal (Conis aureus), fox (Vulpes bengalensis), hare (Lepus ruficandatus), monkey (Macaca mulatta), wild cat (Felis bengalensis) and the porcupine (Hystric leucura). Several species of game birds are also seen, including the peafowl (Pavo cristatus), the black partridge (Frencolinus francolinus) and the gray partridge (Francalinus pondicervanus). A number of migratory water fowls visit the water bodies of the district in winter, such as the goose (Anser anser), common teal (Anas crecca), red-crested pochard (Netta rufina), white-eyed pochard (Aythya rufa) and the wigeon (Mareca penelope). The cobra (Naja naja), krait (Bungarus caeruleus), and rat-snake (Ptyas mucosus) are commonly found. The Indian crocodile or naka (Crocodylus palustris), and the ghariyal (<b>Gavialis</b> <b>gangeticus)</b> are {{also found in the}} river Ghaghra. The common fish species are rohu (Lebeo rohita), bhakur (Catla catla), nain (Cirrhina mrigala), parhin (Wallagonia attu), krunch (Labeo calbasu), and tengan (Mystus seenghala).|$|R
