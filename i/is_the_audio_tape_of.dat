40|$|Specimens {{of early}} {{computer}} systems stop working every day. It {{is necessary to}} prepare ourselves for the upcoming situation of having storage media and no working systems to read data from these carriers. With storage media residing in archives for already obsolete systems {{it is necessary to}} extract the data from these media before it can be migrated for long term preservation. One storage medium that was popular for home computers in <b>the</b> 1980 s <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>audio</b> <b>tape.</b> <b>The</b> first home computer systems allowed the use of standard cassette players to record and replay data. <b>Audio</b> <b>tapes</b> are more durable than old home computers when properly stored. Devices playing this medium (i. e. tape recorders) can be found in working condition or can be repaired as they are made out of standard components. By re-engineering the format of the waveform the data on such media can then be extracted from a digitized audio stream. This work presents a case study of extracting data created on an early home computer system, the Philips G 7400. The original data formats were re-engineered and an application was written to support the migration of data stored on tapes without using the original system. This eliminates the necessity of keeping an obsolete system alive for preserving access to data on storage media meant for this system. Two different methods to interpret the data and eliminate possible errors in <b>the</b> tape <b>were</b> implemented and evaluated on original tapes recorded 20 years ago. Results show that with some error correction methods parts of <b>the</b> tapes <b>are</b> still readable, even without the original system. It also becomes clear, that it is easier to build solutions now when <b>the</b> original systems <b>are</b> still available...|$|R

40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} a major health challenge. It is also is a high profile disease with {{extraordinary}} media attention that places an immense burden on women, families, children and health resources. Over {{the last two decades}} the way in which women experience breast cancer has undergone significant changes. The implementation of the National Health Service Breast Screening Programme, development of specialist multidisciplinary teams, and greater involvement of women in decision making surrounding treatment choice are just some of these changes. A discrete clinical nurse specialism has developed to provide support and information to women undergoing treatment and care for breast cancer. This multi-method two staged study explored the work of breast care nurses supporting women with breast cancer. <b>The</b> particular focus <b>was</b> on <b>the</b> body image and sexuality dimensions of the breast cancer experience. Firstly, a postal survey using modified versions of the Sex Knowledge and Attitude Test (Lief and Reed 1972) and the Williams-Wilson Sexuality Survey instrument (Wilson and Williams 1989) was undertaken and completed by breast care nurses (n= 100) across England. Secondly, adopting an interpretative perspective, breast care nurses (n= 29), recruited via the earlier survey participated in focused conversational interviews. In addition a secondary analysis of two focus group interviews with women breast cancer patients (n= 14), and a further two individual interviews with lesbian women <b>were</b> undertaken. <b>The</b> <b>audio</b> <b>taped</b> data <b>was</b> analysed using a thematic approach assisted by ATLAS. ti 4. 1 qualitative software (Muhr 1996). Three major themes: the delivery of breast cancer care, knowing women, and the territory of breast care nursing <b>were</b> developed. <b>The</b> theme of knowing women was connected with three sub themes titled: authenticity and domesticity, moral journeys, and the (in) visibility of lesbian women. The thematic analysis presents a critical account of contemporary breast care nursing in the endeavour of "being there for women"...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to collect {{information}} about how supervisors motivate their front line staff in the field of campus recreation.

Eighteen campus recreation professional staff members from eighteen different institutions <b>were</b> interviewed for <b>the</b> study. These professionals were selected from public institutions which are current members of the National Intramural-Recreational Sports Association. All staff members selected for the interview maintains direct contact with front-line staff members from programs within the department. A qualitative interview process was used to collect the data for the study. Each participant <b>was</b> interviewed, and <b>the</b> <b>audio</b> <b>tapes</b> from <b>the</b> interview <b>were</b> transcribed. Data triangulation methodology was used to analyze the data to identify common themes within the 18 different interviews. This study found that:Campus recreation front-line employees want to be rewarded and recognized for their work. These employees have a high need for appreciation and recognition. When the employees receive appreciation and recognition for their hard work from their supervisors, they are motivated to perform better. Campus recreation departments are using a variety of techniques to reward and recognize their employees for excellent work, but these programs should align with the department that support the institution's values, goals, and mission. This study provides additional information about the reward, recognition, and motivation programs offered by campus recreation departments throughout the United States.

40|$|The {{increased}} {{intensity and}} complexity of cancer treatment {{has an impact on}} the lives of the adolescents undergoing such treatments. Living with cancer is a distinct experience for them which include physical, psychological, spiritual and social dimensions. The cancer experience comprises more than the measurement of symptom occurrence, frequency, duration and severity, or the ratings of quality oflife. The meanings of the lived experience from the adolescent's perspective and self-report can give a more accurate, holistic picture of the nature and scope of the experience. Practitioners need to know and understand the meaning of the experience from the adolescent's perspective in order to design appropriate interventions to prevent or relieve distress in these patients. The purpose of this study <b>was</b> to describe <b>the</b> meanings of the lived experience ofhaving cancer for adolescents undergoing treatment. Phenomenology <b>was</b> <b>the</b> qualitative research methodology used. As outlined by Patricia Munhall, this methodology seeks to understand the meaning of lived experiences. Seven adolescents, 14 to 18 years of age, in treatment for cancer were interviewed. Six males and one female participated in this study. Six were receiving treatment for acute lymphocytic leukemia and one for a solid tumor. All participants were of Pacific Island origin; two live in Hawaii and five <b>were</b> temporary residents. <b>The</b> <b>audio</b> <b>taped</b> interviews <b>were</b> transcribed and analyzed to understand the meaning of the cancer experience. The essence of the experience for <b>the</b> individual adolescent <b>was</b> described and a composite interpretation of the meaning derived. Recommendations to healthcare providers for improving communication with adolescents in treatment for cancer are provided, including discussing death and dying early in the illness trajectory. The interdisciplinary concept of care is stressed, as well as the importance of a thorough physical examination. The importance of social support and techniques to potentially strengthen and increase this support are outlined. Solutions to the problems of school reintegration are introduced. Ph...|$|R

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this study <b>was</b> to {{investigate}} <b>the</b> usefulness of the Interpersonal Process Recall training program in developing counseling skills with U. S. Army squad leaders. A secondary purpose was to examine applicability of Interpersonal Process Recall training with subjects having little or no prior counseling skills training. A review of paraprofessional and nonprofessional literature indicated the effectiveness of lay persons, in various mental health settings. The use of videotape technology has indicated several advantages for its use in training programs; however no significant differences were reported between audio and video techniques on trainee response criteria. The increased use of simulation methods in counselor training programs <b>was</b> reported from <b>the</b> literature. Related theoretical positions <b>were</b> discussed including <b>the</b> concepts of Rogers, Bruner, Bandura, and Kagan. Research relative to the efficacy of the IPR method indicated its validity as a training model for a variety of populations. <b>The</b> study <b>was</b> conducted at <b>the</b> Twelfth Engineer Battalion, United States Army, at Dexheim, Germany. The Population consisted of forty squad leaders and was randomly divided into treatment and control groups. A posttest-only control group design was used in this study. The treatment consisted of 21 hours of IPR training extended over a three-week period of time. At the conclusion of the training each subject in the treatment and control groups conducted a 45 minute taped interview with a volunteer client followed by the client completing a Barrett-Lennard Relationship Inventory. <b>The</b> tapes <b>were</b> rated by three doctoral students who achieved high levels of interrater reliability on the Counselor Verbal Response Scale. The Barrett-Lennard Relationship Inventories were then scored {{in order to determine the}} clients' perception of the quality of the counseling relationship that had <b>been</b> established. <b>The</b> means of <b>the</b> client scores <b>were</b> analyzed by using a one-way ANOVA test for significant difference. No significance <b>was</b> found when <b>the</b> means of the treatment and control groups <b>were</b> compared. <b>The</b> <b>audio</b> <b>tapes</b> <b>were</b> rated on <b>the</b> four dichotomized dimensions of the Counselor Verbal Response Scale (CVRS) by using a seven minute segment from the middle of each <b>audio</b> <b>tape.</b> <b>The</b> means of the raters judging the treatment and control groups were treated by using the one-way analysis of variance. Significance at <b>the.</b> 05 level <b>was</b> found on <b>the</b> affective verbal response dimension. No significance was found on exploratory, listening, or honest labeling dimensions. Eight of the nine hypotheses failed to show a significant difference between treatment and control groups relative to the subjects' levels of regard, empathic understanding, congruence, and unconditionality, on the Barrett-Lennard Relationship Inventory; and the subjects' exploratory, listening, and honest labeling responses on the Counselor Verbal Response Scale. Conclusions based on the findings indicated that hypothesis eight relative to subjects' affective responses <b>was</b> <b>the</b> only hypothesis to show significance. Caution should <b>be</b> applied in <b>the</b> interpretation of this finding since further analysis of the data for the affective dimension indicated that one treatment group score made the difference that resulted in significance. The lack of significance for the hypotheses presented little evidence from this study to support the use of IPR training with this population. Subjective questionnaires from the treatment subjects indicated positive reactions toward the IPR training experience. The subjects' supervisors and subordinates were asked to report their observations of the subjects' interpersonal behavior for the five week period following the training. Results indicated approximately an equal number of positive and negative observations which showed little or no observable change in the subjects. The results of the study pointed out the need for further research relative to the usefulness of IPR training with specific military populations. The limitations of the study included: (1) <b>the</b> population studied <b>was</b> specific in its characteristics which limited generalization of the results; (2) there was an absence of comparable research with this population; (3) the instructors had limited experience conducting IPR training sessions prior to the study; (4) the training period of 21 hours was too brief especially within a military setting where military priorities resulted in subject absenteeism; (5) the small N of 16 used in the study restricted the generalization of results; and (6) the lack of random assignment of volunteer clients could have contributed to the results on the dependent measures. Future research of this nature should consider comparing other training programs with the IPR model. 3 Thesis (D. Ed. ...|$|R
