40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} on percentage of wheel slip for a passenger car using GPS and wheel speed sensor. The objective of this thesis is to analyze the percentage of wheel slip for a passenger car in a various velocity, road condition and driving mode. The thesis describes the post-processing method to analyze the percentage of wheel slip and identify the effective rolling radius and the longitudinal tire stiffness for maximum tire life and performance. Driving and braking behaviour of vehicle were both studied in this thesis for paved and unpaved sandy road condition which commonly the contributing factors to the wheel slip to occur. The data used for the analysis is obtained through experimental test using UMP Test Car which has been installed with Wheel Pulse Transducer, Global Positioning System and DEWESOFT software for data acquisition purpose. The post-processing method was performed using Flexpro and Microsoft Office Excel. The post-processing method to analyze the percentage of wheel slip was performed using the SAE definition of wheel slip and the percent error in the distance travel by the car between free rolling and actual condition. Finally, the longitudinal force, the effective rolling radius and the longitudinal tire stiffness was determined for both driving and braking maneuver of vehicle on paved and unpaved sandy road condition. From the results, {{it is observed that}} the percentage of wheel slip during driving maneuver is higher for unpaved sandy road condition compares to that the paved road. It is also observed that the longitudinal force of the tire is lower for unpaved sandy road compare to the paved road condition. The effective rolling radius of the tire during driving maneuver was determined to be lower compare to the <b>free</b> rolling <b>radius</b> of the tire. During braking manuever, the results show that the percentage of wheel slip is higher for unpaved sandy road compare to that for paved road condition. The longitudinal force and tire stiffness also observed lower for unpaved sandy road condition.

40|$|Septal {{displacement}} is postulated as {{an important}} mediator of ventricular interdependence. During acute right ventricular loading with the Mueller manoeuvre the septum flattens and shifts leftward. To investigate the mechanism of this septal deformation, we measured transseptal pressures in nine patients during Mueller manoeuvres with simultaneous right and left ventricular micromanometers, and left ventricular configuration with two-dimensional echocardiograms. Data were analysed throughout diastole and at end-systole during control and maximum Mueller manoeuvre (- 40 to - 80 mmHg airway pressure). Leftward septal displacement during the Mueller manoeuvre was evidenced {{by an increase in}} septal radius of curvature at end-diastole persisting through end-systole. The left ventricular <b>free</b> wall <b>radius</b> of curvature was unchanged. During the Mueller manoeuvre, the left ventricular cavity area decreased significantly in the cross-sectional view. All Mueller manoeuvres were associated with a decrease in left-to-right ventricular transseptal pressure gradient throughout diastole. There was no significant change in the gradient at end-systole; septal flattening persisted, however, despite a pronounced left to right pressure gradient. Thus, diastolic septal flattening during right ventricular loading is associated with a decreased transseptal pressure gradient but does not require right ventricular diastolic pressure to exceed left ventricular diastolic pressure. The persistence of flattening in systole suggests that once septal shift occurs during diastole, other forces during systole maintain the deformity despite a large intracavitary transseptal gradient...|$|R

The pairing coherence length in the spin-singlet channel for the effective density dependent delta (DDD) and Gaussian interaction is estimated. We consider in our calculations bound {{states as well}} as narrow resonances. It turns out that the pairing gaps given by the DDD interaction {{are similar to those of}} the Gaussian potential if one renormalizes the radial width to the nuclear radius. The correlations induced by the pairing interaction have in all considered cases a long range character inside the nucleus and decrease towards the surface. The mean coherence length is larger than the geometrical radius for light nuclei and approaches this value for heavy nuclei. The effect of the temperature and states in continuum is investigated. Strong shell effects are evidenced, especially for protons. We generalize this concept to quartets by considering similar relations, but between proton and neutron pairs. The quartet coherence length has a similar shape, but with larger values on the nuclear surface. We evidence the important role of proton-neutron correlations by estimating the so-called alpha coherence length, which takes into account the overlap with the proton-neutron part of the α-particle wave function. It turns out that it does not depend on the nuclear size and has a value comparable to the <b>free</b> α-particle <b>radius.</b> We have shown that pairing correlations are mainly concentrated inside the nucleus, while quarteting correlations are connected to the nuclear surface.
