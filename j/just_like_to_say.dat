But he isn't nice! He's horrid, and conceited, and--and--hateful. And I shall never study art anywhere. And I'd die before I asked him to help me. He was just making fun of you all the time, and anybody but you would see it, mother! Comparing me to a hired girl!" ...|$|R

6000|$|So Miranda Pryor {{was married}} to Private Joseph Milgrave on his last leave. It {{should have been a}} romantic wedding but it was not. There were too many factors working against romance, as even Rilla had to admit. In the first place, Miranda, in spite of her dress and veil, was such a flat-faced, commonplace, uninteresting little bride. In the second place, Joe cried bitterly all through the ceremony, and this vexed Miranda unreasonably. Long {{afterwards}} she told Rilla, [...] "I <b>just</b> felt <b>like</b> <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> him then and there, 'If you feel so bad over having to marry me you don't have to.' But it was just because he was thinking all the time of how soon he would have to leave me." ...|$|R
