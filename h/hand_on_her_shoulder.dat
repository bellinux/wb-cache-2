500|$|By midnight, the Baley {{company had}} fallen behind the Rose company {{and decided to}} stop and make a {{mountain}} camp while Rose and others continued to the Colorado River, where they planned to water their combined stock and build a raft {{in preparation for the}} impending river crossing. By noon on August 28, Rose had reached a patch of Cottonwood trees about one mile from the river, where their oxen were unhitched and allowed to join the loose stock racing towards the water. There the emigrants encountered more Mohave, but unlike the friendly ones that greeted them at Sitgreaves Pass, these were rude and hostile. After a thorough watering, the work oxen were returned to the wagons. Rose and his wife, Amanda, decided to scout the river bank for a suitable campsite, exiting their wagon to make the journey by foot. Moments later, an aggressive Mohave placed his <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> and bosom, and she ran back, terrified, to the relative safety of their wagon. Rose, not wanting to incite the Mohave, ignored the incident and continued to the river. Other Mohave harassed Alpha Brown's family, briefly threatening to take his wife's dress and abduct their son. That danger was averted, but many Mohave set about driving off and slaughtering several of the party's cattle before leaving the emigrants alone at their encampment, some two hundred yards from the river and [...] away from the Baley company's mountain camp.|$|E
500|$|Hollyoaks devised an arson plot {{to begin}} on Guy Fawkes Night 2010, {{as a result}} of which some {{characters}} would die. The production team intended to keep details of who would die secret until transmission. Prior to broadcast, Stenson revealed that Steph would risk her own life to save Amy Barnes (Ashley Slanina-Davies), Leah Barnes (Jessica Croft-Lane) and Lucas Hay. The actress explained that [...] "She stares death in the face every day because of her cancer, so thinks she really has nothing to lose now." [...] Stenson performed one of her own stunts during filming, with the rest undertaken by a stunt double. A promotional trailer for the episodes aired across the Channel 4 network, featuring Steph on fire. In the event, Steph rescued Amy and her children from a burning building but refused to leave herself, saying she was ready to die. Her exit received a positive reaction from fans on the social networking website Twitter, with Stenson stating that she was [...] "honoured" [...] by the response. Steph's legacy continued following her death, with her husband, family and friends left {{to come to terms with}} their grief. On 29 November 2011 it was confirmed Stenson was to reprise the role for a one off guest appearance as Steph in which she appears as an angel to Doug Carter who had attempted suicide and she convinces him that his life matters. Steph tells Doug something and he shows Frankie a special song that Steph had recorded for her. Frankie, overjoyed that her daughter had not forgotten her, wept whilst Angel Steph looked on happily and placed a <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> before winking to Tom and returning to heaven, stating she was [...] "ready for her solo." ...|$|E
