ABSTRACT: The aim of the study was to generate design criteria in order to encour-age and facilitate wayfinding for advanced Alzheimer’s patients. Two sources of data were used: interviews with the staff of a typical urban nursing home, and a wayfinding experience with its residents. The results show that even patients with severe cognitive deterioration are able to reach certain destinations. Wayfinding decisions have to be based on environmental information that is readily accessible, so that the patient can proceed from decision point to decision point. Monotony of architectural composi-tion and the lack of reference points render wayfinding difficult. The elevators are seen to be a major anxiety-causing barrier. Visual access to the main destinations increases their use and facilitates wayfinding. Signage has an important function...|$|E
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of prescription medication use among older people increases with advancing age and {{is related to}} their comorbidities. Cardiovascular medication is the medication category {{that is the most}} commonly prescribed. We retrospectively determined the repercussion of the cardiological consultation of the Hopital de <b>geriatrie</b> de Geneve on the cardiovascular medication. For the year 2001, 191 hospitalized patients were randomely selected and their treatment before and after the consultation was compared. The treatment was simplified after consultation considering the number of medication classes, drugs, and pills. Adverse effect (11 % of consultations) is the main reason for interrupting a medication. The number of medication before consultation is an important factor to decide whether the treatment needs to be simplified. The medication cost is not modified. By simplifying treatment the cardiological consultation reduces the adverse effects of medication and probably improves therapeutic adherence. A prospective study is necessary to confirm these data and estimate their long term consequences...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{assess whether}} stress or mixed urinary {{incontinence}} (UI) {{is associated with}} deficits in executive functioning among community-dwelling women. Design: An observational study comparing the performance, using multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVAs) and Bonferroni post hoc test, of continent women and women with stress or mixed UI during executive control tasks. Setting: The research center of the Institut universitaire de <b>gériatrie</b> de Montréal. Participants: One hundred and fifty-five community-dwelling women aged 60 and older participated in the study. Measurements: Based on the Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI), participants were split into three groups: 35 continent women, 43 women with stress UI, and 78 women with mixed UI. Participants completed a battery of neuropsychological tests and a computerized dual-task test. Results: Women with mixed UI showed poorer performances than continent and stress UI women in executive control functions. Deficits were specific to tests involving switching and sharing/dividing attention between two tasks. Conclusion: Results {{of this study suggest}} that mixed UI can be associated with executive control deficits in community-dwelling older women. Future intervention studies in the treatment of UI should take the higher risk of an executive control deficit in women with UI under consideration...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{update the}} {{evidence-based}} position statement {{published by the}} French National Authority for Health (HAS) in 2006 regarding the pharmacological treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis, {{under the auspices of}} the French Society for Rheumatology and Groupe de Recherche et d 2 ̆ 7 Information sur les Ostéoporoses (GRIO), and with the participation of several learned societies (Collège National des Gynécologues et Obstétriciens Français, Groupe d 2 ̆ 7 Étude de la Ménopause et du Vieillissement hormonal, Société Française de Chirurgie Orthopédique, Société Française d 2 ̆ 7 Endocrinologie, and Société Française de <b>Gériatrie</b> et de Gérontologie). METHODS: A multidisciplinary panel representing the spectrum of clinical specialties involved in managing patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis developed updated recommendations based on a systematic literature review conducted according to the method advocated by the HAS. RESULTS: The updated recommendations underline the need for osteoporosis pharmacotherapy in women with a history of severe osteoporotic fracture. In these patients, any osteoporosis medication can be used; however, zoledronic acid is the preferred first-line medication after a hip fracture. In patients with non-severe fractures or no fractures, the appropriateness of osteoporosis pharmacotherapy depends on the bone mineral density and FRAX(®) values; any osteoporosis medication can be used, but raloxifene and ibandronate should be reserved for patients at low risk for peripheral fractures. Initially, osteoporosis pharmacotherapy should be prescribed for 5 years. The results of the evaluation done at the end of the 5 -year period determine whether further treatment is in order.

The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} how weight training or nursing-based rehabilitative care programs in nursing hornes impact on resident performance of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and objectives tests of physical performance. Methods. This study involved a quasi-experimental contro!, longitudinal comparison of functional status over a 10 -month period, where baseline status was adjusted through a weighting procedure based on functional status, cognitive status, and age. All residents from six residential care nursing horne facilities were eligible except those with a terminal prognosis, a projected stay of less than 90 days, or with health complications that prohibited contact. Hornes were placed into matched triplets based on patient characteristics: two members of each triplet were randomly designated to be experimental sites, the third became the control site. Baseline data were available for 468 subjects, follow-up for 392. ADL self-performance measures derived from the Minimum Data Set, including indicators of early loss ADL, locomotion, and late loss ADL; a number of objective functional tests (including measures ofbalance, power, and endurance); and mood state as measured by the <b>Geriatrie</b> Depression Scale. Results. Mean ADL values in the two experimental groups declined at a significantly lower rate than did rates for the con-trols. Functional decline was also lower in more specific measures: locomotion, early loss ADL, and late loss ADL. Conclusions. With both interventions, facilities were able to implement a broad-based intervention that resulted in a signifi-cant reduction in ADL decline rates. A facility-wide nursing rehabilitation program can playa useful role in reversing func-tional decline, helping residents to maintain their involvement in a broad spectrum of ADL activities...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn France, the {{population}} of very old frail patients, who require appropriate high-quality care, is increasing. Given the current economic climate, the mean duration of hospitalization (MDH) needs to be optimized. This prospective study analyzed the causes of prolonged hospitalization in an acute geriatric care unit. Over 6 months, all patients admitted to the target acute geriatric care unit were included and distributed into two groups according to a threshold stay of 14 days: long MDH group (LMDHG) and short MDH group (SMDHG). These two groups were compared. 757 patients were included. The LMDHG comprised 442 {{with a mean age}} of 86. 7 years, of whom 67. 65 % were women and the SMDHG comprised 315 {{with a mean age of}} 86. 6 years, of whom 63. 2 % were women. The two groups were statistically similar for age, sex, living conditions at home (alone or not, help), medical history and number of drugs. Patients in the LMDHG were more dependent (p= 0. 005), and were more likely to be hospitalized for social reasons (p= 0. 024) and to have come from their homes (p= 0. 011) than those in the SMDHG. The reasons for the prolonged stay, more frequent in the LMDHG than the SMDHG (p< 0. 05), were principally: waiting for imaging examinations, medical complications, and waiting for discharge solutions, assistance from social workers and/or specialist consultations. In order to reduce the MDH in acute geriatric care unit, it is necessary to consider the particularities of the patients who are admitted, their medico-socio-psychological management, access to technical facilities/consultations and post-discharge accommodation.

40|$|Objective To {{assess the}} effects of {{inpatient}} rehabilitation specifically designed for geriatric patients compared with usual care on functional status, admissions to nursing homes, and mortality. Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data sources Medline, Embase, Cochrane database, and reference lists from published literature. Review methods Only randomised controlled trials were included. Trials had to report on inpatient rehabilitation and report {{at least one of}} functional improvement, admission to nursing homes, or mortality. Trials of consultation or outpatient services, trials including patients aged < 55, trials of non-multidisciplinary rehabilitation, and trials without a control group receiving usual care were excluded. Data were double extracted. Odds ratios and relative risks with 95 % confidence intervals were calculated. Results 17 trials with 4780 people comparing {{the effects of}} general or orthopaedic geriatric rehabilitation programmes with usual care were included. Meta-analyses of effects indicated an overall benefit in outcomes at discharge (odds ratio 1. 75 (95 % confidence interval 1. 31 to 2. 35) for function, relative risk 0. 64 (0. 51 to 0. 81) for nursing home admission, relative risk 0. 72 (0. 55 to 0. 95) for mortality) and at end of follow-up (1. 36 (1. 07 to 1. 71), 0. 84 (0. 72 to 0. 99), 0. 87 (0. 77 to 0. 97), respectively). Limited data were available on impact on health care or cost. Compared with those in control groups, weighted mean length of hospital stay after randomisation was longer in patients allocated to general geriatric rehabilitation (24. 5 v 15. 1 days) and shorter in patients allocated to orthopaedic rehabilitation (24. 6 v 28. 9 days). Conclusion Inpatient rehabilitation specifically designed for geriatric patients has the potential to improve outcomes related to function, admission to nursing homes, and mortality.

Here, we present a case of {{necrotizing fasciitis}} of the leg caused by K. pneumoniae in a 92 -year-old French woman hospitalized in a geriatric rehabilitation unit. The patient initially presented with dermohypodermitis of the leg that developed from a dirty wound following a fall. A few hours later, this painful injury extended to the entire lower limb, with purplish discoloration of the skin, bullae, and necrosis. Septic shock rapidly appeared and the patient died 9  hours after the onset of symptoms. The patient was Caucasian, with no history of travel to Asia or any underlying disease. Computed tomography revealed no infectious metastatic loci. Blood cultures showed growth of capsular serotype K 2  K. pneumoniae strains with virulence factors RmpA, yersiniabactin and aerobactin.

Methods: This study compares the Observation and Interview-based Diurnal Sleepiness Inventory (ODSI) with two existing instruments for measurement of sleepiness and daily functioning, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ). Results: A total of 125 study participants {{were included in}} this study and were administered the ODSI, ESS and FOSQ; subjects had a mean age of 70. 9 ± 5. 27  years, mean Apnea–Hypopnea Index of 31. 9 ± 27. 9 events/hour and normal cognitive functioning (Mini-Mental State Examination score > 24). The ODSI showed a significant association with the ESS (Spearman’s ρ: 0. 67, P < 0. 001) and with the FOSQ (Spearman’s ρ: – 0. 52, P < 0. 001). The ODSI 1 item (assessing sleepiness in active situations) was borderline significantly correlated with the ESS (β = 0. 14; 95 % confidence interval [CI], – 0. 01 to 0. 29; P = 0. 069). ODSI 2 item (sleepiness in passive situations) was correlated with the ESS (β = 1. 65; 95 % CI, 1. 32 to 1. 98; P < 0. 001).

Current theories propose that the processing of negative emotions is defective in violent individuals and that dysfunctions within the neural circuits involved in emotion processing are implicated in violence. Although schizophrenia patients show enhanced sensitivity to negative stimuli, there are only few functional neuroimaging studies that have examined emotion processing among men with schizophrenia and a history of violence. Objective: The present study aimed to identify the brain regions with greater neurofunctional alterations, as detected by functional magnetic resonance imaging during an emotion processing task, of men with schizophrenia who had engaged in violent behavior compared with those who had not. Methods: Sixty men were studied; 20 with schizophrenia and a history of violence, 19 with schizophrenia and no violence, and 21 healthy men were scanned while viewing positive, negative, and neutral images. Results: Negative images elicited hyperactivations in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), left and right lingual gyrus, and the left precentral gyrus in violent men with schizophrenia, compared to nonviolent men with schizophrenia and healthy men. Neutral images elicited hyperactivations in the right and left middle occipital gyrus, left lingual gyrus, and the left fusiform gyrus in violent men with schizophrenia, compared to the other two groups. Discussion: Violent men with schizophrenia displayed specific increases in ACC in response to negative images. Given the role of the ACC in information integration, these results indicate a specific dysfunction in the processing of negative emotions that may trigger violent behavior in men with schizophrenia.

However, few studies have looked at the potential synergetic effects of combining physical and cognitive training in a single study. Prior trials on combined training have led to interesting yet equivocal results. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the effects of combined physical and cognitive interventions on physical fitness and neuropsychological performance in healthy older adults. Methods: Seventy-six participants were randomly assigned to one of four training combinations using a 2 × 2 factorial design. The physical intervention was a mixed aerobic and resistance training program, and the cognitive intervention was a dual-task (DT) training program. Stretching and toning exercises and computer lessons were used as active control conditions. Physical and cognitive measures were collected pre- and postintervention. Results: All groups showed equivalent improvements in measures of functional mobility. The aerobic–strength condition led to larger effect size in lower body strength, independently of cognitive training. All groups showed improved speed of processing and inhibition abilities, but only participants who took part in the DT training, independently of physical training, showed increased task-switching abilities. The level of functional mobility after intervention was significantly associated with task-switching abilities. Conclusion: Combined training did not yield synergetic effects. However, DT training did lead to transfer effects on executive performance in neuropsychological tests. Both aerobic-resistance training and stretching-toning exercises can improve functional mobility in older adults.

Identifying comorbid conditions and physiologic changes due to aging allows oncologists to better assess the risk/benefit ratio and to adjust the treatment accordingly. Conducting a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) is one approach developed for this purpose. We reviewed the evidence on the usefulness of CGA for assessing health problems and predicting cancer treatment outcomes, functional decline, morbidity, and mortality in older patients with solid malignancies. Methods: We searched Medline for articles published in English between January 1, 2000 and April 14, 2014, and reporting prospective observational or interventional studies of CGA feasibility or effectiveness in patients aged ≥ 65 years with solid malignancies. We identified studies with at least 100 patients, a multivariate analysis, and assessments of at least five of the following CGA domains: nutrition, cognition, mood, functional status, mobility and falls, polypharmacy, comorbidities, and social environment. Results: All types of CGA identified {{a large number of}} unrecognized health problems capable of interfering with cancer treatment. CGA results influenced 21 %– 49 % of treatment decisions. All CGA domains were associated with chemotoxicity or survival in at least one study. The abnormalities that most often predicted mortality and chemotoxicity were functional impairment, malnutrition, and comorbidities. Conclusion: The CGA uncovers numerous health problems in elderly patients with cancer and can affect treatment decisions. Functional impairment, malnutrition, and comorbidities are independently associated with chemotoxicity and/or survival. Only three randomized published studies evaluated the effectiveness of CGA-linked interventions. Further research into the effectiveness of the CGA in improving patient outcomes is needed.

40|$|Anorexia is {{the most}} {{frequent}} modification of eating habits in old age, which may lead to malnutrition and consequent morbidity and mortality in older adults. We aimed to estimate the prevalence and factors associated to anorexia {{in a sample of}} Italian older persons living in different settings. Our secondary aim was to evaluate the impact of senile anorexia on nutritional status and on eating habits, as well as on functional status. Observational study in nursing homes, in rehabilitation and acute geriatric wards, and in the community in four Italian regions (Lazio, Sicily, Emilia-Romagna, and Veneto). 526 over 65 years old participants were recruited; 218 free-living subjects, 213 from nursing homes, and 96 patients from rehabilitation and acute geriatric wards {{in the context of a}} National Research Project (PRIN) from the Italian Ministry of Instruction, University and Research (2005 - 067913 "Cause e Prevalenza dell'Anoressia senile"). Anthropometric and nutritional evaluation, olfactory, chewing, and swallowing capacity, food preferences, cognitive function, functional status, depression, quality of life, social aspects, prescribed drugs, and evaluation of gastrointestinal symptoms and pain. Laboratory parameters included prealbumin, albumin, transferrin, C-reactive protein, mucoprotein, lymphocyte count, as well as neurotransmitters leptin, and ghrelin. Anorexia was considered as ≥ 50 % reduction in food intake vs. a standard meal (using 3 -day "Club Francophone de <b>Gériatrie</b> et Nutrition" form), in absence of oral disorders preventing mastication. The overall prevalence of anorexia was 21. 2 % with higher values among hospitalized patients (34. 1 % women and 27. 2 % men in long-term facilities; 33. 3 % women and 26. 7 % men in rehabilitation and geriatric wards; 3. 3 % women and 11. 3 % men living in the community) and in the oldest persons. Anorexic subjects were significantly less self-sufficient and presented more often a compromised nutritional and cognitive status. Diet composition analyses of anorexic older adults revealed a lower intake of all food groups and a general tendency to a monotonous diet. Anorexia is a frequent condition in older Italians, particularly those hospitalized, with important consequences in the nutritional and functional status. The analysis of dietary components and its quality along with the frequency of intake of single food groups may be useful to plan intervention strategies aiming to improve the nutritional and health status of older adults with anorexia. An early detection of anorexia followed by an adequate intervention in older hospitalized patients to avoid further worsening of clinical and functional status is warranted...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: This study {{evaluated}} a ten-week structured walking {{intervention with}} systematic training progression in a community-based social organization {{for older adults}} on promoting physical activity, fitness and well-being among older adults (+ 55). The intervention prescribed pedometer-based walks in weekly walking schedules. These were competence-tailored based on a walking assessment (6 ’ walking test) and structured in walking load according {{to the principles of}} training progression. The intervention was implemented as a social activity in community-based meeting points of a social organization for older adults, including group walks. Methods: The intervention condition consisted of 29 meeting points (n = 432) while 10 meeting points (n = 148) formed a waiting-list control condition. Measurements were at intervention start (pre-test) and end (post-test). The Godin LTEQ (Godin et al., 1985) was used to assess physical activity. The 6 ’ walking test (6 MWT; Butland et al., 1982) was used to assess fitness. Well-being included measures of anxiety (STAI; Spielberger et al., 1983), well-being(Marcoen et al., 2002), and subjective health. Results: Intention-to-treat linear mixed models revealed intervention effects on moderate intensity (F = 7. 276, p <. 01) and total physical activity (F = 6. 185, p <. 05), fitness (F = 9. 486, p <. 01), anxiety (F = 5. 261,p <. 05) and subjective health (F = 3. 960, p <. 05), and suggested an effect on low intensity physical activity (F = 3. 291, p =. 07). The effects consisted of increased low intensity (t = - 6. 482, p <. 001) and total physical activity (t = - 3. 589, p <. 001), fitness (t = - 7. 017, p <. 001) and subjective health (t = - 4. 723, p <. 001), and of reduced anxiety (t = 4. 957, p <. 001) over time. Moderate intensity physical activity remained unchanged in the intervention condition (t = - 1. 707, p = n. s.), but was reduced in the control condition (t = 2. 131, p <. 05), indicating the counteraction of a season effect. Conclusions: The intervention was effective in promoting physical activity, fitness and aspects of wellbeing. The results underline the value of (A) training progression in structured walking interventions and of (B) community-based social organizations for older adults as intervention setting.

Purpose: To evaluate the annual direct {{health care costs}} and productivity costs associated with moderate to severe CNCP in primary care patients taking into account their pain disability. Materials and methods: Patients reporting noncancer pain for at least 6 months, at a pain intensity of 4 or more on a 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain) intensity scale, and at a frequency of at least 2 days a week, were recruited from community pharmacies. Patients&# 39; characteristics, health care utilization, and productivity losses (absenteeism and presenteeism) were documented using administrative databases, pharmacies&# 39; renewal charts, telephone, and self-administered questionnaires. Patients were stratified by tertile of pain disability measured by the Brief Pain Inventory questionnaire. Results: Patients (number = 483) were, on average, 59 years old, mainly women (67. 5 %), and suffered from CNCP for a mean of 12 years at an average pain intensity of 6. 5 ± 1. 9. The annual direct health care costs and productivity costs averaged CAD $ 9, 565 (±$ 13, 993) and CAD $ 7, 072 (±$ 11, 716), respectively. The use of complementary health care services accounted for almost 50 % of the direct health care costs. The mean adjusted total direct health care costs (considering pain-related hospitalizations only) and productivity costs increased with more pain disability: low disability, CAD $ 12, 118; moderate, CAD $ 18, 278; and severe, CAD $ 19, 216; P= 0. 001. Conclusion: The economic burden of CNCP is substantial and increases {{with the level of}} pain disability, which suggests the need for and potential benefits of improving CNCP management through specific and adapted treatment plans targeting the impact of pain on daily functioning.

40|$|International audienceINTRODUCTION: This paper {{discuss the}} ability to obtain a {{reliable}} pervasive information at home from a network of localizing sensors allowing to follow the different activity-station at which a dependent (elderly or handicapped) person can be detected. Since 12 years ([1 - 3]), many experiments have been achieved for watching dependent people at home, in particular elderly and handicapped persons. For acquiring data necessary to permit the alarms triggering, numerous sensors have been invented, in particular for localizing the person {{at home or in}} the surroundings. These localizers are on the body (GPS, accelerometers, [...] .), in the flat rooms (on the walls: infrared or radar detectors; on the ground, the bed or the chairs: pressure sensors), on the doors (magnetic switches) or in gardens and streets (video-cameras). METHODS: The data recorded can be treated as time series as the sequence of color coding numbers of balls (symbolizing activity-stations) taken in a Polya's urn, in which the persistence of the presence in an activity-station is represented by adding a number of balls of the same color as the ball just drawn ([5]). The sequence could also represent historical data from a model, deriving from language models and markovian processes existing in speech recognition research, where the persistence is the probability to stay at the same activity-station ([6]). Other models can also be used as well as the mean time passed or the remaining time in the activity-station. Theses models are compared in order to use the most representative one. RESULTS: Using statistics, the best model offers up to 98. 03 % of good prediction location, considering only the last second of location but distinguishing days of week. Other models need to be improved. We discuss the pertinence of such procedures to early detect sudden or chronic changes in the parameters values of the random process made of the succession of ball numbers. We will use the best procedure to trigger alarms, which will occur when an incorrect prediction is made, or when the person persists at the same station more than the mean time passed in this station, or when the remaining time is passed. CONCLUSIONS: The sensors network is very important to follow up the dependent people during their walk trajectories inside home or outside. If the space/time data are acquired on healthy elderly people or on patients which suffer from neuro-degenerative diseases, the sensors recording must be very well calibrated, to give birth to specific profiles concerning the time series which correspond to the successive locations of the dependent person in rooms inside the flat or in specific places inside a room ([4]). Simpler than Polya's urns derived approach, the Markovian approach seems to be a good way of location modeling. Other models need to be improved in order to concurrence it. A big hope comes from the ambient information techniques to be able to detect a sudden fall on the ground or a progressive stereotyped behavior (for the early diagnosis of chronic neuro-degenerative diseases like the Alzheimer or Parkinson ones).

Methods: A cohort {{study was conducted in}} Quebec (Canada). Patients reporting chronic noncancer pain with an average pain intensity of at least 4 on a 0 – 10 scale (10 = worst possible pain) and having an active analgesic prescription from a primary-care physician were recruited. They completed a telephone interview and a self-administered questionnaire to document their pain, emotional well-being, satisfaction with treatment, and barriers/beliefs/attitudes about pain and its treatment. Information on pharmacotherapy was based on an administrative provincial database and pharmacies&# 39; charts. Determinants of patients&# 39; satisfaction were identified using multivariate linear regression models. Results: Four hundred and eighty six patients participated. Their mean age was 58. 4 years and they had had pain for a mean of 11. 7 years (standard deviation, ± 11. 1) at an average pain intensity of 6. 5 in the past week. Although 90 % reported adverse gastrointestinal effects, 36. 4 % and 54. 4 % of these patients took no over-the-counter or prescribed medication for constipation or nausea, respectively. On a scale from 0 – 100, the mean overall satisfaction score was 64. 7 (95 % confidence interval [CI] = 63. 5 – 65. 9). Patient satisfaction was low, particularly regarding the “information about pain and its treatment” (mean 50. 6; 95 % CI = 47. 6 – 53. 7) and “treatment efficacy” (mean 53. 6; 95 % CI = 51. 5 – 55. 6) subscales. The overall treatment satisfaction score decreased with more pain disability, probable depression and anxiety, more barriers to pain treatment, higher incidence of nausea, and use of over-the-counter analgesics. Conclusion: In primary care, patients’ level of satisfaction with their pain treatment is not optimal. This study underlines how the expanded scope of practice of community pharmacists may allow them to play a pivotal role in providing information, discussing barriers to pain treatment, and monitoring pain disability, and by appropriately managing pharmacotherapy to optimize effectiveness while minimizing adverse effects.

Available at [URL] In Europe {{it is estimated that}} the number of elderly people aged above 65 will have doubled by 2060. In several chronic pulmonary diseases patients can suffer recurrent exacerbation episodes that can lead to severe breathing or death. In this thesis we explore the association of physical activity to lung health parameters, focusing on cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients and a group of the general population. The main goals of the thesis were to assess the feasibility of classifying exacerbation episodes in cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients and to implement new parameters {{in the context of a}} cohort study. We conducted four distinct studies involving in total over 250 subjects. We asked them to wear a set of accelerometers, including GT 3 X and RT 3, recording physical activity for up to 14 days. The data was processed and several features extracted that were used as inputs in three different classification algorithms: logarithmic regression, neural networks and support vector machines. We achieved an area under the curve of 67 % with logarithmic regression, 83 % with neural networks and 90 % with support vector machines when classifying exacerbation episodes in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. A neural network was achieved an accuracy of 85 % distinguishing cystic fibrosis patients from healthy controls. We proposed, extracted and tested a large set of physical activity parameters for use in KORA-Age. The work on classification of exacerbations in COPD patients is, to our knowledge, the first attempt based on features from accelerometer data. Overall SVM showed to be the most robust classifier with an area under the curve of 90 %. Nevertheless the number of patients and episodes is too low to draw definitive conclusions. The next step to classify exacerbations in COPD is to design a study with a statistically significant number of exacerbation episodes...|$|E
40|$|The present {{prospective}} study of oral health of aged {{people in a}} geriatric centre was carried out {{within the framework of}} a practical training in dental treatment of the aged of students of dentistry at the Medical Department Charité in the Max-Bürger-Zentrum für Sozialmedizin <b>Geriatrie</b> und Altenhilfe gGmbH (Centre for Social Medicine, Geriatrics and Assistance for the Aged) in Berlin and was based on the issue of a dental finding (1 st day of examination), a survey of the patients (2 nd day of examination) as well as a neuropsychological test (3 rd day of examination). In the years 2000 to 2002, it was possible to examine or, as the case may be, survey 140 patients (average age 82. 6 ± 9, 1 years, 78. 6 % women), who participated voluntarily in the clinical trial. 2001, an examination of the risk factors of malnutrition was carried out. Additionally an anonymous written survey of the nursing staff was planned, which, however, could not be utilised {{because of the lack of}} cooperation of the surveyed people. Acute disorders in the oral cavity existed in 10. 3 % of the patients. 20. 8 % of the patients suffered from disturbs on the oral mucosa. A dental treatment was desirable for 33. 3 % of the patients and necessary for 23. 2 % of them. In the health care facility 37 % of the patients had already been treated by a dentist. The last visit to a dentist had been made on an average in a total 34. 1 ± 59. 7 months ago. 46. 0 % cleaned their teeth once a day, 39. 7 % twice a day, 14. 3 % performed a sporadic dental hygiene. The API was on an average of 93. 6 ± 17. 5 %, whereas 85. 7 % had an API of 100 %. 67. 9 % of our patients had a total prosthesis in the maxilla, 42. 9 % in the mandible. 23. 2 % of the evaluated dental prosthesis were in need of repair or enhancement", in a further 24. 4 % the material was bad or the teeth were abraded and therefore a renewal of the prosthesis advisable. 72. 2 % of the patients cleaned their prosthesis once a day, only 8. 2 % cleaned it after every meal. In 76. 8 % of the cases a toothbrush was used and in less than 32, 6 % a cleaning bath with tablets was used. The performance of oral hygiene and hygiene of the prosthesis was carried out in 58. 2 % of the cases by the patient on his/her own. 1. 8 % were assisted by their relatives and 12. 7 % were supported by the nursing staff. In 27. 3 % of the cases the measures were taken only by the nursing staff. The prosthesis hygiene was good with 28. 9 % of the evaluated patients; with 43. 4 % moderate and with 27. 6 % bad. 31. 1 % of the patients were able to call on a dentists practise on their own or accompanied, for 44. 4 % a transport for disabled had to be called and for 24. 4 % a transport to the dentists practise was unacceptable. The average value of points scored in the Mini-Mental-Status-Test was 15 ± 10 points. For every patient there was an average of 7. 1 ± 2. 3 of risk factors for malnutrition. The present clinical trial proved in accordance with the results of other clinical trials the bad dental hygiene and the insufficient dental care of aged people, living in health care facilities, which was proven in Germany as well as on an international level. The realisation of the following measures for the enhancement of the care situation is reqired: * A better advanced training for dentists and physicians in the area of geriatric dentistry * Improvement of the basic conditions for a dental treatment for patients in a nursing home * Dental entry examinations and routine examinations for all inhabitants of nursing homes * Better training of the nursing staff and obligatory integration of oral hygiene measures in the daily nursing tasks * More dentists influence on the assessment of the level of care * Support in the performance of oral hygiene measures by a qualified dental nurse * Development AND realisation of prevention concepts for aged people * Enhancement measures for the compliance These fundamental improvements have to be regularised on a national level, though actual compliance must be performed at grass-roots levels, where the personal involvement of every individual counts...|$|E
