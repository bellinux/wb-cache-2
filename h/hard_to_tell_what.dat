25|$|Evans, at one point, {{published}} an {{assertion that the}} disc had been written, and should be read, from the center out; {{because it would have}} been easiest to place the inscription first and then size the disc to fit the text. There is general agreement that he was wrong, and Evans himself later changed his mind: the inscription was made, and should be read, from the outside in toward the centre. The centres of the spirals are not in the centre of the disc, and some of the symbols near the centre are crowded, as though the maker was cramped for space. One pair of symbols are set top-to-bottom, so it is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>what</b> order they should be in. Except in the cramped section, when there are overstrikes, the inner symbol overlies the outer symbol. Jean Faucounau has proposed a reconstruction of the scribe's movements, which would also require an inward direction; Yves Duhoux says that any outward reading may be discarded. Despite this consensus, there are still a few such attempted decipherments (See Phaistos Disc decipherment claims).|$|E
500|$|Several critics {{interpreted}} the song's lyrics during their reviews. Its theme was noted {{to be about}} freedom. Jason Lipshutz of Billboard {{said that in the}} song, Lee is [...] "trying to convince a romantic partner to stop 'spiraling down, down, down' and help her find a new beginning." [...] Kerrang! writer Steve Beebee wrote that Lee reaches a conclusion that [...] "Love will guide you home." [...] Talking about the lyrical content of the song, Laurie Tuffrey of NME opined: [...] "It's quite <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>what</b> the song's about, with lots of references to 'the unknown' and 'the pain', and it confusingly switches between suggesting people 'do what you want you want, if you have a dream for better' in the first verse and the decidedly creepier final chorus where Lee seemingly gets an ex-lover on the blower, only to tell them 'Hello, hello, it’s only me, infecting everything you love'." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "West Coast" [...] {{was directed by}} Vincent Haycock, and shot at Marina del Rey, California and in Venice, Los Angeles, in early April 2014. Aside from Del Rey, the clip also features Hollywood tattoo artist Mark Mahoney who plays the singer's love interest in the clip's chorus segment, and American model Bradley Soileau who plays the same role in another scene. Del Rey described Mahoney as her confidante, lover and procurer in the video. In an interview with Clash, the singer mentioned, [...] "Like the record, [...] atmospheric, and you catch a directional vibe, but it's not that pointed, and it's <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>what</b> is going on". She attained inspiration for the clip from the Chet Baker documentary Let's Get Lost (1988), and her love of the red dress effect. The singer also wanted the video to be mood-driven, and for its final scene, to transcend from black-and-white imagery to a [...] "HD color dream scene".|$|E

500|$|Mark Washburn of Knight Ridder {{wrote that}} at the time of the episode's broadcast, most Americans were {{accustomed}} to seeing homosexual characters on television. He said this is why Patty's coming-out did not become as controversial as the episode's examination of the same-sex marriage issue, which was more sensitive in the country then. The controversy became so big that local news programs in certain cities aired segments about it. In response to the claims that this episode was supporting gay marriage, Al Jean replied that [...] "we don't really take any positions for or against anything, we just like to examine all sides of an issue and I think that anyone who would get their political wisdom from a cartoon might be sadly mistaken." [...] Likewise, Mark Pinsky writes in The Gospel According to The Simpsons that once the episode ended, it was <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>what</b> stance on same-sex marriage the writers had and that [...] "both sides of the controversy had their say, voiced by various Simpsons characters". Jean has also cited the episode in defense to critics who say The Simpsons has lost its relevance and edginess in later years. In his book , John Ortved responded to this, commenting that despite the controversies the episode was [...] "in fact a long-winded and lame exploration of the topic." ...|$|E
500|$|Official Stargate sources advertised Vala as a [...] "scheming, unscrupulous, thieving con artist", [...] "feisty" [...] and [...] "occasionally fickle", with a [...] "mysterious agenda" [...] and a {{seemingly}} [...] "amorous interest in Dr. Daniel Jackson". Genre magazine TV Zone subtitled Vala as a [...] "thief, arms dealer, mercenary" [...] who, when given an inch, will [...] "take a mile, {{and whatever else}} she can get her hands on." [...] SFX described Vala as a [...] "mischievous minx", whereas The San Diego Union-Tribune interpreted Vala as [...] "ethically challenged". Steven Eramo of Starburst gave Vala the attributes [...] "sexy, smart and always resourceful". Claudia Black characterized early Vala as [...] "sassy", [...] "intelligent", [...] "manipulative", and [...] "mercurial", but found it [...] "very <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>what</b> the real core of Vala is." [...] Black later described Vala as [...] "a new, weird element", [...] "irritating", [...] "very vibrant", [...] "sort of the hair-pulling variety", [...] "really infuriating" [...] and [...] " [...] funny". With Vala being a departure from Black's former Farscape role as Aeryn Sun, Black regarded Vala as a comedic and energetic character with streaks of irreverence and naughtiness who [...] "says everything that everyone else is thinking, but doesn't dare say", although both characters share [...] "being damaged goods [...] and on a path to becoming a better person". Robert C. Cooper thought of Vala as [...] "a bit of a wild card" [...] and [...] "a very sexy character, who isn't afraid to take whatever she wants in any given situation." [...] Cooper and Black believed the character had a moral compass to her actions.|$|E
500|$|Theme Hospital {{took over}} two years to develop. The idea came from Peter Molyneux and {{journalist}} James Leach, who explored the possibility of other Theme games while discussing Theme Park. Leach suggested a hospital, and Molyneux was enthusiastic about the idea. Development began when the designer Mark Webley selected Theme Hospital {{from a list of}} possible games put together by Molyneux, and Webley, along with the artist Gary Carr, visited the Royal Surrey County Hospital and Frimley Park Hospital to get inspiration. Carr was initially displeased at the prospect of working on Theme Hospital: he had previously left Bullfrog to work for The Bitmap Brothers because he did not have faith in Theme Park. He chose to return based on his belief that he would work on Dungeon Keeper, which he was eager to do. Initially, Theme Hospital was to feature real diseases, but these were replaced with fictional, comedic afflictions as it was decided that the game's maladies should not be too realistic: the team were faced with the dilemma of having to make the hospital fun and interesting, as Webley stated that theme parks are [...] "colourful" [...] compared to hospitals, and Carr believed that hospital rooms looked very similar and that it was <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>what</b> each machines does. It was during a hospital visit that they {{came up with the idea}} of using made-up illnesses and cures: Carr considered death [...] "quite sad" [...] and believed that illness was not a popular subject. He stated that using made-up illnesses gave them [...] "creative freedom", which he believed was essential. Webley said that Carr was concerned that using real diseases might be considered distasteful. According to Carr, the team were aiming for humour rather than gore. During the initial stages of programming, Bullfrog hired James Leach, who wrote the game's text and came up with the diseases. Molyneux was not directly involved in the game's production as he was then working on Dungeon Keeper.|$|E

As such, the book feels at times like a movie, and sometimes more specifically, a snuff film. New technology such as photo manipulation software (e.g. [...] "PhotoSoap for Windows 95") are featured in the novel. This creates an ironic situation in which Victor, the character obsessed by appearances, is haunted by fake images that appear real which implicate him in a murder; it becomes <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>what</b> is real in the 'modern' world. As such, [...] "meaningful identity is obliterated"; this furthers the recurring joke from American Psycho wherein [...] "characters are always getting confused by their friends with other people, with no noticeable consequences".|$|E

5000|$|Hilbert's {{original}} {{statement of}} his 12th problem is rather misleading: {{he seems to}} imply that the abelian extensions of imaginary quadratic fields are generated by special values of elliptic modular functions, which is not correct.

More seriously, while values of elliptic modular functions generate the Hilbert class field, for more general abelian extensions one also needs to use values of elliptic functions. For example, the abelian extension [...] is not generated by singular moduli and roots of unity.|$|R

Writing about a live performance in the New York Times, critic Peter Watrous said of Chilton that [...] "He's a soul and blues guitar connoisseur; he chooses his guitar licks as carefully as he does the blues songs he covers, and during his solos, a listener heard a history of soul and blues guitar."
