50|$|In 2000, the Elián González {{affair was}} an {{immigration}} {{battle in the}} Miami area. The controversy concerned six-year-old Elián González who was rescued from the waters {{off the coast of}} Miami. The U.S. and the Cuban governments, his father <b>Juan</b> <b>Miguel</b> <b>González,</b> his Miami relatives, and the Cuban-American community of Miami were all involved. The climactic stage of this prolonged battle was the April 22, 2000, seizure of Elián by federal agents, which drew the criticism of many in the Cuban-American community. During the controversy, Alex Penelas, the mayor of Miami-Dade County at the time, vowed that he would do nothing to assist the Bill Clinton administration and federal authorities in their bid to return the six-year-old boy to Cuba. Tens of thousands of protesters, many of whom were outraged at the raid, poured out into the streets of Little Havana and demonstrated. Car horns blared, demonstrators turned over signs, trash cans, and newspaper racks and some small fires were started. Rioters jammed a 10-block area of Little Havana. Shortly afterwards, many Miami businesses closed, as their owners and managers participated in a short, one-day boycott against the city, attempting to affect its tourism industry. Employees of airlines, cruise lines, hotels, car rental companies, and major retailers participated in the boycott. Elián González returned to Cuba with his father on June 28, 2000.|$|E

Elián was rescued from the ocean off the coast of Florida after his mother and stepfather drowned when their boat capsized {{on the way to the}} United States. He was taken to the Miami home of his great uncle, a Cuban émigré, who assumed temporary custody of the “unaccompanied minor”(the five-year-old’s classification under U. S. immigration law). Claiming that Elián would face “imminent and irreparable harm ” if he were returned to Castro’s “island prison,” the great-uncle petitioned the Immigration and Naturalization Service to grant the boy political asylum. But the father, <b>Juan</b> <b>Miguel</b> <b>González,</b> demanded that his son be returned to Cuba, where, he said, Elián “does not lack anything ” and “has his health care and education free. ” The INS and the Justice Department agreed that giving custody to the Cuban-based father would be in accord with U. S. laws as well as “in the best interests of the child,” although several members of Congress actively supported the great uncle’s efforts to retai...|$|E
