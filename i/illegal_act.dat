5|$|Krikler {{comments}} that Mansfield's conclusions ignored the ruling precedent of his predecessor, Matthew Hale, that {{the killing of}} innocents {{in the name of}} self-preservation was unlawful. This ruling was to prove important a century later in R v Dudley and Stephens, which also concerned the justifiability of acts of murder at sea. Mansfield also failed to acknowledge another important legal principle—that no insurance claim can be legal if it arose from an <b>illegal</b> <b>act.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{front of}} a jury, the city's art censor Jeremiah O'Connor testified that September Morn was lewd {{and should not be}} {{displayed}} in public, but rather only in a museum exhibition. W.W.Hallam of the Chicago Vice Committee agreed, arguing that, as the woman was committing the <b>illegal</b> <b>act</b> of bathing in public, September Morn had to be banned. Other witnesses for the prosecution included censors, educators, and clergy, such as the superintendent Ella Flagg Young {{and the head of the}} Juvenile Protective Association Gertrude Howe Britton.|$|E
5|$|In 1896, Savage sued his {{publisher}} for $12,000 in unpaid royalties. The publisher, Frank Tennyson Neely, who {{had filed}} for bankruptcy five years earlier before accepting Savage as a client, argued {{that he did not}} owe Savage anything, instead, Savage owed him. Neely's scattered and incomplete accounting books prevented an easy conclusion to the trial. Three years later, Neely once again declared bankruptcy. In 1899, Abraham Lewis of Brooklyn sued Savage for $10,000 in damages, for stealing away the affections of his wife. Savage's own wife and a friend defended him in court, saying Lewis, an informal supplier of food to soldiers under Savage's command, was retaliating for being stopped from the lucrative but <b>illegal</b> <b>act</b> of selling liquor to the troops at Montauk Point.|$|E

40|$|<b>Illegal</b> <b>acts</b> are a {{major threat}} to global forest resources. Various studies on the {{magnitude}} and impact of forest crime completed {{in the last few years}} show rather shocking results: <b>Illegal</b> forest <b>acts</b> of various kinds are common everywhere, in developing and industrialized nations, and in all major forest types—boreal, temperate, and tropical. Forest crime prominently includes <b>illegal</b> logging but <b>acts</b> against the law also affect other sector operations such as forest products transport, industrial processing, and trade. This paper looks at available evidence on the magnitude and impacts of <b>illegal</b> <b>acts,</b> the vulnerabilities of the forest sector, and proposes a strategy for combating forest crime...|$|R
5|$|Lavender {{created a}} {{controversy}} {{in a game}} on September23, when he was caught altering the baseball by rubbing it against an emery board that he had attached to his uniform's pant leg, an <b>illegal</b> <b>act.</b> At the time, the fine for such an infraction was a five-dollar fine. The Phillies players noticed that the pitcher was constantly scratching {{the side of his}} leg. They asked the umpire to search the pitcher. Lavender refused to be searched and ran into the outfield, and the umpire refused to chase Lavender. Eventually, a particularly fast Phillies player, Hans Lobert, was able to catch up with him and grab the offending item. As a result of this incident, AL president, Ban Johnson, decreed that any pitcher in his league caught using sandpaper to alter the baseball, would be suspended for 30days and fined $100. This rule became the forebearer of the rule banning other pitches as well, including the spitball. In his 37 games pitched in 1914, 28were as the starting pitcher. His win–loss record was 11–11, and he lowered his ERA down to 3.07in 214innings pitched.|$|E

40|$|The {{extent to}} which {{auditing}} standards merely consolidate existing practice, {{as compared with the}} {{extent to which}} they are innovative and raise standards, is a matter of debate. This paper provides evidence on this issue in respect of the UK auditing standard SAS 120 concerned with the auditor's responsibilities for client <b>illegal</b> <b>acts.</b> Six case examples of <b>illegal</b> <b>acts</b> were developed and these formed the basis for interviews with forty-three practising auditors. It was found that auditors' assessments of their ability under current practice to discover specific <b>illegal</b> <b>acts</b> are significantly below their perceptions as to the need for these acts to be discovered. This indicates that auditors believe that their responsibilities in this area of the audit are not being adequately discharged. It was also found that auditor consensus appears to be an important consideration in the shaping of the standard and this is consistent with viewing auditing standards as consolidations of professional practice. However, it was also found that levels of consensus did vary and tended to be less in the case of less familiar <b>illegal</b> <b>acts</b> or those less proximate to the financial statements...|$|R

25|$|Abuse of authority, in {{the form}} of {{political}} corruption, is the use of legislated or otherwise authorised powers by government officials for illegitimate private gain. Misuse of government power for other purposes, such as repression of political opponents and general police brutality, is not considered political corruption. Neither are illegal acts by private persons or corporations not directly involved with the government. An <b>illegal</b> <b>act</b> by an officeholder constitutes political corruption only if the act is directly related to their official duties.|$|E
25|$|After {{a series}} of {{interlocutory}} hearings over the discovery of documents that took more than seven months, the matter finally came before Justice Harun Hashim in the Kuala Lumpur High Court on 4 February 1988.

The question of the Assembly itself being illegal therefore became academic.|$|E
25|$|In certain jurisdictions {{it is or}} {{has been}} held that hyperlinks are not merely {{references}} or citations, but are devices for copying web pages. In the Netherlands, Karin Spaink was initially convicted in this way of copyright infringement by linking, although this ruling was overturned in 2003. The courts that advocate this view see the mere publication of a hyperlink that connects to illegal material to be an <b>illegal</b> <b>act</b> in itself, regardless of whether referencing illegal material is illegal. In 2004, Josephine Ho was acquitted of 'hyperlinks that corrupt traditional values' in Taiwan.|$|E

25|$|The act of {{domestic}} violence towards women is a human rights violation {{as well as an}} <b>illegal</b> <b>act</b> under Indian law.

Domestic violence {{is one of the most}} significant determinants of this denial. Greater gender equality through greater women’s agency cannot be achieved if basic health needs are not being met and if cultural biases that allow for domestic violence in India persist.|$|E
