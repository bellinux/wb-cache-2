40|$|In {{a region}} where falciparum malaria is endemic and where {{pregnant}} women traditionally receive only curative treatment for parasitaemias and no chemoprophylaxis 65 placental biopsy specimens were examined histologically for malaria pigment. Twenty seven placentas had pigment, but parasitaemias had been diagnosed antenatally in only 12 of these women despite their frequent attendance at antenatal and other clinics. The incidence of parasitaemia in pregnant primigravidas was 17. 7 %, seven times greater than that in lactating primiparous mothers; pregnant primigravidas also had the highest incidence (67 %) of pigmented placentas. <b>First</b> born <b>babies</b> with pigmented placentas had a mean (SD) birth weight of 2580 (260) g, significantly less than the 3150 (400) g of unaffected <b>first</b> <b>babies.</b> All babies weighing less than 2500 g at birth had pigmented placentas. Pigmentation was associated with parasitaemias {{in the second half}} of pregnancy, and, although some recovery from early parasitaemias may occur, the fetoplacental unit is inadequately protected by curative treatment alone.
