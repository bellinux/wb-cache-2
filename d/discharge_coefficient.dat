The inlet and outlet of the 3 -in- 1 hole both have a 15 ° lateral expansion. The flow conditions considered are mainstream turbulence intensities and density ratios of secondary flow to mainstream. The momentum flux ratios varied {{in the range from}} 1 to 4. The comparison is made of the <b>discharge</b> <b>coefficients</b> of three shaped holes to find an optimal hole with low flow loss. The results show that the <b>discharge</b> <b>coefficients</b> of 3 -in- 1 hole are highest in three shaped holes and therefore this article is focused on the measurements of <b>discharge</b> <b>coefficients</b> of 3 -in- 1 hole for various geometries and aerodynamic parameters. The measured results of 3 -in- 1 hole indicate that turbulence intensities, density ratios and momentum flux ratios have weak influence on <b>discharge</b> <b>coefficients</b> for inclination angle of 20 °. The high turbulence intensity yields the small <b>discharge</b> <b>coefficients</b> for inclination angle of 45 ° and 90 °.

40|$|Abstract: Water cycle {{research}} {{is the basis of}} any water management and one of most important elements is the runoff. In environmental analyzes the most commonly used is the annual specific runoff. Due to increasing environmental awareness the need for better seasonal runoff knowledge is crucial to support the decision making processes in order to improve the sustainable water resources management. The water quantity is crucial for all environmentally based water management. For water vulnerability analyzes the specific runoff can be taken into account as water sensitivity indicator. Since the runoff is varying in time and space the average annual runoff is not always enough, the substantial improvement can be achieved with the use of seasonal or monthly runoff. With the use of GIS we joined the results of two hydrological analyzes: water balance and river flow regimes. We used kriging to transform the point data of <b>discharge</b> <b>coefficients</b> in order to create continuous spatial distribution of the variable as a raster. To compute long-term average monthly specific runoff raster we used mathematical functions in GIS to combine the long-term specific runoff raster and the monthly <b>discharge</b> <b>coefficients.</b> The final results are 12 raster maps of monthly <b>discharge</b> <b>coefficients</b> and 12 maps of long-term monthly specific runoff...|$|R

40|$|The {{linkage between}} sewer pipe flow and {{floodplain}} flow is recognised to induce {{an important source}} of uncertainty within two-dimensional (2 D) urban flood models. This uncertainty is often attributed to the use of empirical hydraulic formulae (the one-dimensional (1 D) weir and orifice steady flow equations) to achieve data-connectivity at the linking interface, which require the determination of <b>discharge</b> <b>coefficients.</b> Because of the paucity of high resolution localised data for this type of flows, the current understanding and quantification of a suitable range for those <b>discharge</b> <b>coefficients</b> is somewhat lacking. To fulfil this gap, this work presents the results acquired from an instrumented physical model designed to study the interaction between a pipe network flow and a floodplain flow. The full range of sewer-to-surface and surface-to-sewer flow conditions at the exchange zone are experimentally analysed in both steady and unsteady flow regimes. Steady state measured discharges are first analysed considering the relationship between the energy heads from the sewer flow and the floodplain flow; these results show that existing weir and orifice formulae are valid for describing the flow exchange for the present physical model, and yield new calibrated <b>discharge</b> <b>coefficients</b> for each of the flow conditions. The measured exchange discharges are also integrated (as a source term) within a 2 D numerical flood model (a finite volume solver to the 2 D Shallow Water Equations (SWE)), which is shown to reproduce the observed coefficients. This calibrated numerical model is then used to simulate a series of unsteady flow tests reproduced within the experimental facility. Results show that the numerical model overestimated the values of mean surcharge flow rate. This suggests the occurrence of additional head losses in unsteady conditions which are not currently accounted for within flood models calibrated in steady flow conditions...|$|R
