5|$|The {{style of}} {{narrative}} writing, <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>passage</b> {{and throughout the}} piece, was alien to journalism at the time, and was considered the province of fiction writing. Only a few other authors, such as Tom Wolfe, were using such techniques in journalistic writing. The piece employed techniques like scenes, dialogue and third-person narrative that were common in fiction, but still rare in journalism.|$|E
5|$|The early texts do {{not contain}} just-war {{ideology}} as such. Some argue that a sutta in the Gamani Samyuttam rules out all military service. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>passage,</b> a soldier asks the Buddha {{if it is true}} that, as he has been told, soldiers slain in battle are reborn in a heavenly realm. The Buddha reluctantly replies that if he is killed in battle while his mind is seized with the intention to kill, he will undergo an unpleasant rebirth. In the early texts, a person's mental state at the time of death is generally viewed as having a great impact on the next birth.|$|E

25|$|Others {{interpret}} the phrase as referring to simple baptism of an individual. For Martin Luther it regarded {{a practice of}} being baptized above (the first of the meanings of the preposition ὑπέρ, generally translated <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>passage</b> as for) the tombs of the dead.

25|$|Concerning {{the longest}} passage of anapaestic septenarii (Miles Gloriosus 1011-93), Moore notes the close {{resemblance}} between the metre <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>passage</b> and trochaic septenarii. The German classicist Marcus Deufert {{notes that the}} style of writing in these lines {{is different from the}} usual anapaests, in that it is more regular and there are more long syllables. He draws the conclusion that the lines from Miles Gloriosus were recited {{in the same way as}} trochaic septenarii, while other anapaestic passages (which usually contain an admixture of other metres) were sung.|$|E
25|$|The {{translation}} of Thomas Taylor (1887) {{has given rise}} to a conception of Melinoe as half-black, half-white, representing the duality of the heavenly Zeus and the infernal Pluto. This had been the interpretation of Gottfried Hermann in his annotated text of the hymns in 1805. This duality may be implicit, like the explanation offered by Servius for why the poplar leaf has a light and dark side to represent Leuke ("White"), a nymph loved by Pluto. The Orphic text poses interpretational challenges for translators <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>passage.</b>|$|E

25|$|Matthew {{opens with}} the {{genealogy}} of Jesus, {{set out in}} three stages each of 14 generations: from Abraham to David, from David to the Babylonian exile and thence to Jesus' legal father Joseph, the husband of Mary his mother. The opening words of the gospel show that it is written by a Jew for Jewish readers. The genealogy demonstrates that Jesus comes from the seed of Abraham and belongs to the House of David, and thus is their heir. The Gospel also asserts Jesus is, in fact, the Son of God, and Joseph is, thus, not actually Jesus' father. Legally, however, Joseph is Jesus' father and some scholars contend legal parentage is of the most importance. Ra McLaughlin argues that the central event <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>passage</b> is actually the adoption of Jesus by Joseph (signified by his naming of the child), which alone makes Jesus eligible to be the messiah from the line of David.|$|E

500|$|The {{dispute over}} the {{authenticity}} of the biblical edicts has prompted interest <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>passage</b> from the Cyrus Cylinder, specifically concerning the question of whether it indicates that Cyrus had a general policy of repatriating subject peoples and restoring their sanctuaries. The text of the Cylinder is very specific, listing places in Mesopotamia and the neighboring regions. It does not describe any general release or return of exiled communities but focuses on the return of Babylonian deities to their own home cities. It emphasises the re-establishment of local religious norms, reversing the alleged neglect of Nabonidus – a theme that Amélie Kuhrt describes as [...] "a literary device used to underline the piety of Cyrus as opposed to the blasphemy of Nabonidus." [...] She suggests that Cyrus had simply adopted a policy used by earlier Assyrian rulers of giving privileges to cities in key strategic or politically sensitive regions {{and that there was no}} general policy as such. Lester L. Grabbe, a historian of early Judaism, has written that [...] "the religious policy of the Persians was not that different from the basic practice of the Assyrians and Babylonians before them" [...] in tolerating – but not promoting – local cults, other than their own gods.|$|E
500|$|This transcendency thesis {{has also}} been applied to scriptural interpretation. When {{discussing}} {{the path to the}} attainment of Nirvana, in some passages in the Tipiṭaka merit is rejected. For example, in the Padhāna Sutta, the Bodhisatta (the Buddha Gotama to be) is tempted by Māra to give up his self-torture practices to do meritorious acts instead. The Bodhisatta replies that even a bit of merit is no use to him (...) [...] Some scholars, supporting the transcendency thesis, have interpreted this to mean that merit can only lead to happiness and progress within Saṃsāra, but does not lead to Nirvana, and must in fact be discarded before attaining Nirvana. Marasinghe believes, however, that the word merit <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>passage</b> refers to merit in the pre-Buddhist Brahmanical sense, connected with rituals and sacrifice, and the lay life. Another example often quoted in this context is the simile of the raft, which states that both dhamma and adhamma should be let go of in order to attain liberation. Whereas the term adhamma in the text clearly refers to evil views, the meaning of dhamma is subject to different interpretations. Considering that no other similar passage {{can be found in the}} Tipiṭaka, Keown believes that only this passage is not enough to base the transcendency thesis on.|$|E
