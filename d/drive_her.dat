5|$|San Marcos {{was used}} for gunnery {{practice}} throughout World War II, although generally as an anchor for a canvas target screen. Sitting two to six {{feet below the surface}} and marked by an unlit buoy, she was responsible for the sinking of the cargo ship Lexington in 1940 following a collision. Tons of explosives were used to demolish her upperworks and <b>drive</b> <b>her</b> hull deep into the mud; by January 1959, they were successful and she remains there today.|$|E
5|$|When Ben Bradley (Ben Richards) daughter, Carly (Sophie Wise), {{is found}} dead, Ben {{initially}} blames Darren {{as he was}} supposed to <b>drive</b> <b>her</b> up to Scotland to a rehab center that day but cancelled the job so he could support Maxine through a dinner party with Patrick. Patrick later manipulates Darren and Maxine's relationship causing Maxine to break up with Darren as she doesn't believe his claims that he's still controlling her.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time, Jayanthi (Andrea Jeremiah) arrives in Kochi from Mumbai {{in search of}} her missing husband, Ramesh (Ashvin Mathew), an Indian Revenue Service officer who {{frequently}} disappeared from home for various reasons, but is now {{a suspect in the}} gold smuggling. Jayanthi arranged for a taxi to <b>drive</b> <b>her</b> to various locations in her quest to find Ramesh. The taxi driver Raju (Mohanlal) appears to have an interest of his own in the circumstances surrounding Ramesh's disappearance. At Jayanthi's bidding, Raju drives her to the home of her mother-in-law (KPAC Lalitha) where he cooks for them and interacts in such a way to earn their trust. Jayanthi then asks Raju to <b>drive</b> <b>her</b> to Kochi to the office of her friend, Chandrasekharan (Vijayaraghavan), assistant commissioner of police. Chandrasekharan promises Jayanthi he will investigate the disappearance of Ramesh. After leaving Chandrasekharan's office, Raju drives Jayanthi to see Chandrasekharan's wife, Advocate Rekha (Muthumany), who is also her friend. During their chat, Jayanthi receives a surprise phone call from Ramesh. He explains that he is in Kovalam for an official meeting but will return home the next day, and insists that Jayanthi return home as well. Chandrasekharan later informs Jayanthi that the phone number Ramesh called from was actually in Kochi, not Kovalam. It is also revealed that Sudheer, Ramesh's brother is involved in the smuggling operation.|$|E

Amir refuses, even after Omi hires him to <b>drive</b> <b>her</b> around the city {{in an attempt to}} convince him. After dropping Omi off, Amir is approached by a man who asks him to deliver a package; however, before he can deliver the package Amir is arrested and charged with smuggling opium.|$|E
5|$|Heather {{resolves}} {{to go to}} Silent Hill, {{intent on}} killing Claudia. She meets with Douglas in her apartment and accepts his offer to <b>drive</b> <b>her</b> there. On the journey there, Douglas explains that Vincent left him a message, telling them {{to look for a}} man named Leonard, while Heather reads a memo left by her father before his death, which reveals that she is the baby girl that was left to her adoptive father, Harry Mason, {{at the conclusion of the}} first game, after he defeated the god birthed by Alessa Gillespie. Claudia seeks Heather to birth the cult's god, since Heather is Alessa's reincarnation.|$|E

5|$|Lek breeding, where males congregate {{to display}} to females, has been {{recorded}} {{in at least one}} species Cyrtocara eucinostomus. Lek-like breeding systems have also been recorded in several other species. In monogamous species, males and females may form pair bonds and breed exclusively with their partners. This occurs in North American freshwater catfishes, many butterflyfishes, sea horses and several other species. Courtship in teleosts plays a role in species recognition, strengthening pair bonds, spawning site position and gamete release synchronisation. This includes colour changes, sound production and visual displays (fin erection, rapid swimming, breaching), which is often done by the male. Courtship may be done by a female to overcome a territorial male that would otherwise <b>drive</b> <b>her</b> away.|$|E
5|$|Queen Mary 2 {{is not a}} {{steamship}} {{like many}} of her predecessors, but is powered primarily by four diesel engines, with two additional gas turbines used when extra power is required; this integrated electric propulsion configuration is used to produce the power to <b>drive</b> <b>her</b> four electric propulsion pods as well as powering the ship's hotel services. The spaces for these prime movers are also split, and controls are also backed up, {{with the intention of}} preventing a single failure from disabling the ship.|$|E
5|$|The Comet {{appears in}} the sky, and Azula's {{coronation}} takes place. Azula banishes nearly all of her subjects, haunted by the betrayals of former friends Mai and Ty Lee. Her paranoia and loneliness begin to <b>drive</b> <b>her</b> insane. Before she is crowned, Zuko and Katara arrive. Zuko accepts Azula's challenge to a one-on-one duel because he realizes Azula is distracted {{and he does not}} want Katara injured. Just as Zuko {{is on the verge of}} defeating Azula, she shoots a bolt of lightning at an unprepared Katara. Zuko throws himself in front of her and intercepts the lightning, preventing Katara from getting hurt, but gravely injuring himself.|$|E

5|$|A large, cranky sow {{escapes from}} its herd and attacks the Mistress after {{she tries to}} shoo {{it out of her}} garden. Lad charges between them and battles the sow, but with his old age and blunt fangs he struggles with the fight and is badly injured. Bruce and Wolf return from a forest romp in time to aid him, and the younger dogs are able to easily <b>drive</b> <b>her</b> off. While fleeing, the pig runs {{directly}} into the path of one of the Place's cars, driven by a car thief who is knocked unconscious. Lad's feelings are hurt by the battle being finished by the other dogs and the Mistress' holding him back from joining them at the end, but he quickly forgives her.|$|E
5|$|Ale {{have several}} adversaries, {{including}} dragons, zmajeviti (dragon-like) men, eagles, St. Elijah, and St. Sava. The principal {{enemy of the}} ala is the dragon; {{he is able to}} defeat her and eliminate her harmful effects. Dragons are thus seen as guardians of the fields and harvest, and as protectors against bad weather. When an ala threatens by bringing hail clouds, a dragon comes out to fight with her and <b>drive</b> <b>her</b> away. His main weapon is lightning; thunder represents a fight between ale and dragons (during which ale hide in tall trees). An instance of a more abundant crop at a particular point is explained in the Pčinja region {{as a result of a}} dragon having struck an ala with lightning just over that place, making her drop the looted grains she had been carrying in her huge ears. If an ala finds a dragon in a hollow tree, however, she can destroy him by burning the tree.|$|E
5|$|As a disorganized {{tropical}} cyclone {{in the northeastern}} Caribbean, Rafael produced major flooding across the region. As much as a foot of rain fell across portions of the Lesser Antilles, causing mudslides, landslides, and river flooding. In addition, the heavy rains led to significant crop loss. Sustained winds near hurricane force were recorded on Saint Martin, while tropical storm-force gusts occurred widespread. Lightning activity {{as a result of}} heavy thunderstorms caused many fires and power outages. One fatality occurred when a woman in Guadeloupe unsuccessfully attempted to <b>drive</b> <b>her</b> car across a flooded roadway. As Rafael passed just to the east of Bermuda as a hurricane, light rainfall was recorded. Gusts over 50mph (85km/h) left hundreds of houses without electricity. Large swells from the system caused significant damage to the coastline of Nova Scotia, while many roads were washed away or obscured with debris, but overall, damage was minimal.|$|E

5|$|As {{detected}} by the British, repairs to Tirpitz following Operation Tungsten progressed quickly. Work on repairing the battleship began in late April, and 157 shipyard workers and special equipment were transported from Kiel in Germany to Kaafjord {{to accelerate the}} project. Assisted by the long hours of daylight at Kaafjord's latitude during summer, three shifts of personnel worked on Tirpitz each day. The battleship was capable of moving under her own power by 2 June, and ready to begin gunnery exercises {{at the end of}} that month. The repair works concluded in mid-July, though the battleship's starboard propeller shaft could only be used to <b>drive</b> <b>her</b> forwards. Captain Wolf Junge assumed command of the battleship in May 1944, replacing Captain Hans Meyer who had been wounded during Operation Tungsten.|$|E
5|$|Morgan {{learned to}} swim at Bankstown {{at the age}} of 7. She was {{initially}} slow to learn, and her coach used a long pole attached to a rope and belt to maintain her safety. This allowed him to fish her out of the water if she fell into difficulty. Due to her slow learning, Morgan was given twice the number of lessons as the other students. At the age of eight, she won the district championship, and in 1953, aged 11, she won the New South Wales (NSW) Primary School Championships. In February 1956, aged 13, she was taken for serious training. Her father transferred her to the tutelage of Frank Guthrie in Enfield. At the time, Guthrie was {{regarded as one of the}} best coaches in the state; his students included Gary Chapman, Kevin O'Halloran and Lorraine Crapp. All three (plus Morgan) would win medals at the 1956 Summer Olympics. Her mother had to <b>drive</b> <b>her</b> to Enfield, as her father was busy with the plumbing business.|$|E
5|$|While Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{is having}} a meeting with Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) in his office, Robert California (James Spader) appears {{at the window and}} frantically says that his wife Susan (Maura Tierney) is looking for a job in the office, and that Andy must not give her one. When Susan arrives, Andy {{compliantly}} tells her that they have no openings, but Robert insists that they have a look around before coming to any conclusions. Susan looks at the different departments, and decides on accounting. Andy again claims the office is already fully staffed, but Robert insists that he give her a job, even pressuring Andy by reminding him of his power as CEO. Confused by Robert's mixed messages, Andy relents and gives her a job, but Robert later calls Andy on the phone to berate him for hiring Susan. Andy asks everyone in the office to treat her poorly to <b>drive</b> <b>her</b> out, which makes everyone uncomfortable as they like her, but end up doing so nevertheless. When Susan notices their behavior, she complains to Robert, who asks Andy to discuss the issues with Susan in the conference room and leaves. Susan eventually realizes it was Robert's idea to <b>drive</b> <b>her</b> away. When they call Robert out, he vehemently denies it. Andy tells them Jim also heard him say he did not want her working at the office, which Jim overhears, prompting him to flee the office. Robert orders security to close the gate, preventing him from leaving. Jim then runs all over the building, but Andy and Robert find him and take him back to the office. After trying unsuccessfully to deflect their questions about what Robert told Andy, Jim blurts out that he is baffled at Robert's attitude, since Jim enjoys working in the same place as his wife Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) and misses her while she is on maternity leave. Andy and Jim leave the conference room and after a short while, Robert and Susan leave. In the parking lot, Andy apologizes to Susan and after brief small talk, Susan asks Andy out on a date, leaving him surprised.|$|E

5|$|In the {{original}} Friday the 13th (1980), Mrs. Pamela Voorhees (Betsy Palmer) stalks and murders the teenagers preparing Camp Crystal Lake for re‑opening. She {{is determined to}} ensure that the camp does not reopen after her son Jason (Ari Lehman) drowned in the lake due to the negligence of two staff members. The last counselor, Alice Hardy (Adrienne King), fends off Mrs. Voorhees long enough to grab a machete and decapitate her. In Friday the 13th Part 2 (1981), Jason (Steve Daskewisz/Warrington Gillette) is revealed to be alive and fully grown. After killing Alice Hardy, Jason returns to Crystal Lake to guard it from all intruders. Five years later, a group of teenagers arrive at Crystal Lake to set up a new camp, but Jason murders them. Ginny Field (Amy Steel), the last counselor Jason attempts to kill, finds a cabin in the woods with a shrine built around the severed head of Mrs. Voorhees. Ginny fights back and slams a machete through Jason's shoulder. Jason is left for dead as Ginny is taken away in an ambulance. During the events of Friday the 13th Part III (1982), Jason (Richard Brooker) removes the machete from his shoulder and finds his way to Chris Higgins' (Dana Kimmell) local homestead. Chris returns to her property with some friends, and Jason kills anyone who wanders into the barn where he is hiding. Taking a hockey mask from a victim to hide his face, Jason leaves the barn to kill the rest of the group. Chris seemingly kills Jason with an axe to his head, but the night's events <b>drive</b> <b>her</b> into hysteria as the police take her away.|$|E
5|$|Mercer {{travels to}} a bohemian pottery-making commune in Shelter Cove, California where Arlen once lived, but learns that {{he moved to}} Reno, Nevada. He passes through Fallon, Nevada {{to meet up with}} the seductive Joely (Jena Malone), his middle school crush. In Reno, they take ecstasy and almost have sex before Mercer resumes his search for Arlen. Later he finds himself on the set of a pornographic film, where the {{director}} (Julio Oscar Mechoso) tells him that Arlen left to work at a pet store in Sacramento, California. Joely asks Mercer if he can <b>drive</b> <b>her</b> cousin Buddy (Colin Fickes) and his friend Rid (William Lee Scott) to Mojave, California, where they are building their own car. While driving, Mercer finds Kate's YMCA card in the trunk of her car and, now knowing what she looks like, describes a dream to her in which he, Joely, and Kate are dancing in a re-enactment of Bande à parts dance sequence. Not wanting to get sidetracked, he tries to leave the others behind in a motel room, but when Buddy threatens to steal the car, Mercer tells him that the car belongs to his girlfriend, and Buddy, Rid, and Joely leave without Mercer in Kate's car. He hitchhikes to Mojave and finds the salvage yard where Buddy and Rid are working, and retrieves the car.|$|E
5|$|The Malaysian Penanggalan is a {{woman who}} {{obtained}} her beauty through the active use of black magic or other unnatural means, and is most commonly described in local folklore to be dark or demonic in nature. She is able to detach her fanged head which flies around in the night looking for blood, typically from pregnant women. Malaysians hung jeruju (thistles) around the doors and windows of houses, hoping the Penanggalan would not enter for fear of catching its intestines on the thorns. The Leyak is a similar being from Balinese folklore of Indonesia. A Kuntilanak or Matianak in Indonesia, or Pontianak or Langsuir in Malaysia, {{is a woman}} who died during childbirth and became undead, seeking revenge and terrorising villages. She appeared as an attractive woman with long black hair that covered a hole {{in the back of her}} neck, with which she sucked the blood of children. Filling the hole with her hair would <b>drive</b> <b>her</b> off. Corpses had their mouths filled with glass beads, eggs under each armpit, and needles in their palms to prevent them from becoming langsuir. This description would also fit the Sundel Bolongs.|$|E
