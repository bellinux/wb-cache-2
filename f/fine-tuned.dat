Mechanization and automation are often implemented to reduce labor costs, but this frequently increases the cost of equipment and creates additional setup time. Material costs tend to increase when special properties are necessary, and energy costs normally do not amount to more than several percent of the total welding cost.|$|E
5|$|The <b>fine-tuned</b> Universe is the {{proposition}} that the conditions that allow life in the Universe can only occur when certain universal fundamental physical constants lie within a very narrow range, so that if any of several fundamental constants were only slightly different, the Universe would be unlikely to be conducive to the establishment and development of matter, astronomical structures, elemental diversity, or life as it is understood.

5|$|Hirokazu Yashuhara of Sonic Team went to England and <b>fine-tuned</b> {{the game}} {{due to lack}} of time for communication.

The game's final release would be first in North America on 18 November 1997, with releases in other regions occurring in late 1997 for the Sega Saturn, and into 1998 for the PC version. The PC versions allowed the user to alter graphics details to get the game to run optimally on different computers. Options include allowing to change between software rendering and 3D acceleration, or adjusting the game's draw distance, affecting how soon objects in the distance are visible. Like many other previous Sonic games during this time period, a largely unrelated Sonic R game was released as a Tiger Electronics LCD handheld game around the same time in 1998.|$|E

5|$|All {{four of the}} Ganguts were {{assigned}} to the First Battleship Brigade of the Baltic Fleet in December 1914 – January 1915 when they reached Helsingfors. Their turrets and fire-control systems, however, were still being adjusted and <b>fine-tuned</b> through the next spring. Their role was to defend the mouth of the Gulf of Finland against the Germans, who never tried to enter, so they spent their time training with occasional sorties into the Baltic. Several ships ran aground in 1915 and 1916, often while providing cover for minelaying operations, but only Sevastopol suffered any significant damage. A minor mutiny broke out on 1 November on board Gangut when the executive officer refused to feed the crew the traditional meal of meat and macaroni after coaling. The crews of the battleships joined the general mutiny of the Baltic Fleet on 16 March 1917, after the idle sailors received word of the February Revolution in Saint Petersburg. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk required the Soviets to evacuate their base at Helsinki in March 1918 or have them interned by newly independent Finland even though the Gulf of Finland was still frozen over.

40|$|Abstract: During {{the latter}} {{stages of a}} {{software}} product cycle, developers may be faced {{with the task of}} <b>fine-tuning</b> an embedded system that is not meeting all of its timing requirements. To aid in this process, we have created a tool called AF-TER (Assist in <b>Fine-Tuning</b> Embedded Real-time systems) to help software designers <b>fine-tune</b> and debug their target real-time implementations. AFTER uses raw timing data collected from an embedded system, analyzes it by correlating the measured data with the system specifications, then provides a temporal image of the current implementation, highlighting actual and potential problems. AF-TER is then used in an interactive predictor mode to help the developer <b>fine-tune</b> the application systematically. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{identify}} the parameter {{regions of the}} phenomenological minimal supersymmetric standard model (pMSSM) with the minimal possible <b>fine-tuning.</b> We show that the <b>fine-tuning</b> of the pMSSM is not large, nor under pressure by LHC searches. Low sbottom, stop and gluino masses {{turn out to be}} less relevant for low <b>fine-tuning</b> than commonly assumed. We show a link between low <b>fine-tuning</b> and the dark matter relic density. <b>Fine-tuning</b> arguments point to models with a dark matter candidate yielding the correct dark matter relic density: a bino-higgsino particle with a mass of $ 35 - 155 $ GeV. Some of these candidates are compatible with recent hints seen in astrophysics experiments such as Fermi-LAT and AMS- 02. We argue that upcoming direct search experiments, such as XENON 1 T, will test all of the most natural solutions {{in the next few years}} due to the sensitivity of these experiments on the spin-dependent WIMP-nucleon cross section.

40|$|In this paper, a fuzzy-based {{approach}} is {{proposed for the}} adaptive <b>fine-tuning</b> of general Nonlinear Control Systems (NCSs). The proposed approach retains all the nice properties of the neural-based <b>fine-tuning</b> algorithms recently proposed by the author [4]–[6], i. e. it provides with efficient, convergent and safe performance under a general set of assumptions, while it employs a novel decision-making mechanism that avoids the use of numerical differentiation as it happens in the approaches of [4]–[6]. Moreover, the proposed approach can efficiently handle both gain-based and threshold-based NCSs contrary to the approaches of [4]–[6] which may exhibit severe performance problems when applied to threshold-based NCSs. Also, while the results of [4]–[6] are applicable to repetitive <b>fine-tuning</b> of NCSs, in this paper both the problems of repetitive and on-line NCS <b>fine-tuning</b> are addressed. Simulation results {{on the problem of}} repetitive <b>fine-tuning</b> of a threshold-based traffic control system demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach...|$|R

Furthermore, even accepting fine tuning, Sober (2005) and Ikeda and Jefferys, argue that the Anthropic Principle as conventionally stated actually undermines intelligent design; see <b>fine-tuned</b> universe.|$|E
40|$|Brane {{inflation}} {{can provide}} a promissing framework for solving the <b>fine-tuning</b> problem in standard inflationary models.

By considering the supersymmetric two-stage inflation model it is shown that the initial <b>fine-tuning</b> of the coupling parameter can be considerably relaxed. SubPlanckian values of the inflaton during inflation can also be obtained. Inflation has been initially invoked as a remedy for the conceptual problems of the cosmological hot big-bang model [1]. These problems are essentially related to the <b>fine-tuning</b> of the initial conditions. However, inflation itself has given rise to another <b>fine-tuning</b> problem.

40|$|We {{study the}} amounts of <b>fine-tuning</b> of the {{parameters}} of the MSSM with non-universal soft supersymmetry-breaking contributions to the Higgs masses (the NUHM) that would be required for the relic neutralino density to lie within the range favoured by WMAP and other astrophysical and cosmological observations. Such dark matter <b>fine-tuning</b> is analogous to the commonly studied electroweak <b>fine-tuning</b> associated with satisfying the electroweak symmetry breaking conditions, which we also study for completeness. We identify several distinct regions of the NUHM parameter space: a bulk region, a - coannihilation region, a pseudoscalar Higgs funnel region, a focus-point bino/higgsino region and a - coannihilation region. Within each region, we analyse specific representative points for which we provide breakdowns of the contributions to the dark matter <b>fine-tuning</b> associated with the different NUHM parameters. In general, the NUHM offers points with both both smaller and larger amounts of dark matter <b>fine-tuning</b> than points in the corresponding regions of the CMSSM. Lower amounts of dark matter <b>fine-tuning</b> typically arise at points where several different (co) annihilation processes contribute, e. g., at junctions between regions with different dominant processes. We comment on the prospects for using collider measurements to estimate the likely dark matter density within the NUHM framework.

40|$|Abstract: The idea of “Natural SUSY”, {{understood}} as a supersymmetric scenario where the <b>fine-tuning</b> is as mild as possible, is a reasonable guide to explore supersymmetric phenomenology. In this paper, we re-examine this issue {{in the context of}} the MSSM including several improvements, such as the mixing of the <b>fine-tuning</b> conditions for different soft terms and the presence of potential extra fine-tunings that must be combined with the electroweak one. We give tables and plots that allow to easily evaluate the <b>fine-tuning</b> and the corresponding naturalness bounds for any theoretical model defined at any high-energy (HE) scale. Then, we analyze in detail the complete <b>fine-tuning</b> bounds for the unconstrained MSSM, defined at any HE scale. We show that Natural SUSY does not demand light stops. Actually, an average stop mass below 800 GeV is disfavored, though one of the stops might be very light.
