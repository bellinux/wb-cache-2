25|$|Although wealthier {{countries}} have <b>higher</b> <b>tax</b> revenue, economic growth {{does not always}} translate to <b>higher</b> <b>tax</b> revenue. For example, in India, increases in exemptions leads to the stagnation of income tax revenue at around 0.5% of GDP since 1986.|$|R

40|$|It is well {{established}} in the economics literature that before-tax prices are not independent of sales-tax rates. This paper shows that a sales-tax imposed in a <b>high</b> <b>tax</b> region can decrease the tax-included price for a buyer in a low tax region who purchases from a seller in the <b>high</b> <b>tax</b> region. Therefore, {{it may be more}} profitable for Internet retailers to be located in <b>high</b> <b>tax</b> regions. An empirical analysis shows that automobile manufacturers in the European Union (EU) set higher before-tax recommended prices for countries with low indirect taxes. This may contribute to the explanation of the flow of Internet automobile sales from <b>high</b> <b>tax</b> countries to low tax countries in the EU...|$|R
5|$|Even after Suys' {{proposal}} was officially adopted, Anspach faced strong {{opposition to the}} project. This opposition came first from engineers who felt that the covering was incompatible with Brussels’s geology, would accumulate potentially dangerous gases {{and would not be}} able to handle enough water to prevent floods. Others opposed to the project complained about the <b>high</b> <b>taxes</b> resulting from its high cost, poor compensation for seized property and the lack of public input into the project. The press accused Anspach of being responsible for demolishing Brussels' old town, and published numerous caricatures mocking him.|$|E
5|$|In January 1957, Diefenbaker {{took his}} place as Leader of the Official Opposition.

The Liberals submitted a budget in March; Diefenbaker attacked it for overly <b>high</b> <b>taxes,</b> failure to assist pensioners, {{and a lack of}} aid for the poorer provinces. Parliament was dissolved on April 12. St. Laurent was so confident of victory that he did not even bother to make recommendations to the Governor General to fill the 16 vacancies in the Senate.|$|E
5|$|In {{his book}} The Technology Edge, {{published}} in 1983, O'Neill wrote about economic competition with Japan. He {{argued that the}} United States had to develop six industries to compete: microengineering, robotics, genetic engineering, magnetic flight, family aircraft, and space science. He also thought that industrial development was suffering from short-sighted executives, self-interested unions, <b>high</b> <b>taxes,</b> and poor education of Americans. According to reviewer Henry Weil, O'Neill's detailed explanations of emerging technologies differentiated the book from others on the subject.|$|E
30|$|The Government in {{our model}} has two {{important}} roles. First, it collects taxes and, second, it promotes cashless transactions. There is a trade-off {{between these two}} actions. <b>High</b> <b>tax</b> levels may mean <b>higher</b> <b>tax</b> revenues, but also discourage consumers and sellers from investing in cashless instruments. This, in turn, means fewer individuals paying taxes. Therefore, {{there is the possibility}} that announcing <b>higher</b> <b>taxes</b> may actually lower expected tax collections. Indeed, this is often cited as a reason for tax evasion in India.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Increasing {{the federal}} {{gasoline}} tax in the United States is highly debated. A <b>higher</b> <b>tax</b> {{would reduce the}} nation’s {{dependence on foreign oil}} and have environmental benefits. Downfalls of a <b>higher</b> <b>tax</b> are the regressive nature of the tax and the unfair burden placed on drivers in rural areas. An increased gasoline tax is not popular with the public, so most politicians do not support a <b>higher</b> <b>tax.</b> An increased federal gasoline tax is a good idea if the increase is large and the additional revenue is used to reduce income taxes in a progressive manner.

5|$|In {{the small}} town of Champaner (in the state of Gujarat, western India) {{during the height of the}} British empire in India in 1893, Captain Andrew Russell (Paul Blackthorne), the {{commanding}} officer of the Champaner cantonment, has imposed <b>high</b> <b>taxes</b> ("Lagaan") on people from the local villages that they are unable to pay due to a prolonged drought.

5|$|Lagaan (English: Taxation) is a 2001 Indian sports drama film, {{written and}} {{directed}} by Ashutosh Gowariker. The film stars Aamir Khan, who also produced the film, and Gracy Singh in the lead roles. Yashpal Sharma, Raghubir Yadav, Rachel Shelley, and Paul Blackthorne feature in supporting roles. The film was edited by Ballu Saluja, with music and cinematography provided by A. R. Rahman, and Anil Mehta respectively. Lagaan is set in India in 1893, during the British Raj.

5|$|On {{the right}} wing of the Republican party, some of Goldwater's {{political}} positions included anti-communism, an emphasis on total victory in war and opposition to <b>high</b> <b>taxes</b> and government spending. He often criticized the politics of some of his more moderate contemporaries, including President Dwight D. Eisenhower. He criticized some aspects of Eisenhower's economic policy, citing his failure to balance the federal budget. After being written off as too right-wing to successfully wage a presidential campaign, Goldwater actively supported Richard Nixon's campaign against John F. Kennedy in the 1960 presidential election.|$|E

5|$|The film {{is set in}} the Victorian {{period of}} India's colonial British Raj. The story {{revolves}} around a small village whose inhabitants, burdened by <b>high</b> <b>taxes,</b> find themselves in an extraordinary situation as an arrogant officer challenges them to a game of cricket as a wager to avoid the taxes. The narrative spins around this situation as the villagers face the arduous task of learning the alien game and playing for a result that will change their village's destiny.|$|E
5|$|The mid-term {{elections}} in 1862 brought the Republicans severe losses due to sharp disfavor {{with the administration}} over its failure to deliver a speedy end to the war, as well as rising inflation, new <b>high</b> <b>taxes,</b> rumors of corruption, the suspension of habeas corpus, the military draft law, and fears that freed slaves would undermine the labor market. The Emancipation Proclamation announced in September gained votes for the Republicans {{in the rural areas}} of New England and the upper Midwest, but it lost votes in the cities and the lower Midwest.|$|E
5|$|In foreign affairs, Walter {{negotiated}} with Scotland in 1195 {{and with the}} Welsh in 1197. Scotland claimed Northumbria, or northern England. Negotiations broke down, but {{relations between the two}} countries remained good throughout the rest of Richard's reign. Talks with the Welsh began after the English lords Roger Mortimer and William de Briouze expanded into Welsh territory in 1195, causing a concern that the Welsh lord Rhys ap Gruffydd would strike back across the border. In 1196, Walter quickly suppressed a popular uprising in London led by William Fitz Osbern. FitzOsbern was an orator who harnessed the discontent of the poor residents of London against <b>high</b> <b>taxes.</b> His oratory provoked a riot in London, and he was apprehended and hanged on Walter's orders.|$|E
50|$|Lower and <b>higher</b> <b>taxes</b> {{were tested}} in the United States from 1980 to 2010 and {{it was found that}} the periods of {{greatest}} economic growth occurred during periods of higher taxation.

40|$|When {{taxes on}} labor are {{introduced}} the tax wedge between labor costs paid by employer (gross wage) and net wage received by employee appears. At {{a certain level}} of wage, <b>higher</b> <b>tax</b> wedge on labor increases unemployment and decreases employment, ceteris paribus. The paper tackles with thee main questions: characteristics of tax wedge on labor, unemployment and employment rate in OECD countries in near past, tax wedge on labor policy in EU 15 and new EU members and tax system and its effects on unemployment and employment rate in Slovenia. We found that OECD countries can be classified in two groups of countries if tax wedge on labor, unemployment rate and employment rate are taken into consideration. First group is <b>high</b> <b>tax</b> wedge, <b>high</b> unemployment rate and low employment rate group of countries, whereas the other group has alternative characteristics.

5|$|On an {{ordinary}} day, a brown bear strolls {{onto the streets}} of Springfield, frightening the town. The bear is eventually subdued by the police. Homer convinces Springfield that {{something needs to be}} done to protect them from bears, and the town takes their complaint to Mayor Quimby, who gives in easily. Soon, the Bear Patrol is created. Homer is then shocked to see taxes have been raised five dollars to maintain the patrol, and this warrants another visit by the town to the Mayor's office. To appease them, Mayor Quimby blames the <b>high</b> <b>taxes</b> on illegal immigrants. He creates Proposition 24, which will require all illegal immigrants in Springfield to be deported.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{excavations}} {{have shown}} that from the early 11th century, the town developed {{in the area around}} Albani Torv, Fisketorvet, Overgade and Vestergade. By 1070, Odense had already grown into a city of stature in Denmark. Canute IV of Denmark, generally considered to be the last Viking king, was murdered by unruly peasants, discontent with the <b>high</b> <b>taxes</b> he imposed on the town, in Odense's St Alban's Priory on 10 July 1086. He was canonized in 1100. The priory no longer exists, although a church has been situated on the site since about 900. At the beginning of the 12th century, Benedictine monks from England founded St Canute's Abbey. It was here the English monk Ælnoth wrote Denmark's first literary work, Vita et Passio S. Canuti (The Life and Passion of St Canute). Canute's shrine in Odense Cathedral (which was attached to the priory) attracted pilgrims throughout the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|By 1686, Seringapatam, {{capital of}} the Kingdom of Mysore, was home to a {{community}} of more than 400 Catholics who were severely harassed in the following two decades when their churches were destroyed and the priest's house confiscated. This destruction was undertaken {{in the name of}} the Wodeyar king, Kanthirava Narasaraja I by his finance minister. The priest's house was eventually returned to the church in 1709. Sometime between 1700 and 1717, another church was built in Rampura, a suburb of Seringapatam, in the face of local opposition. During the period of Chikka Devaraja (1673–1704), 400 priests who protested against <b>high</b> <b>taxes</b> were executed; as per a legend, they were strangled by the wrestlers of his court. Relations between the Wodeyars and the Mangalorean Catholics improved until 1717, when an anti-Christian purge led to the expulsion of the resident priest who was thereafter forbidden to preach. Several more anti-Christian demonstrations followed, but by 1736 relations had once more improved between the two groups.|$|E

5|$|His fourth {{minister}} of economy, Domingo Cavallo, was appointed in 1991. He deepened the neoliberal reforms. The Convertibility plan was {{sanctioned by the}} Congress, setting a one-to-one fixed exchange rate between the United States dollar and the new Argentine peso, which replaced the Austral. The law also limited public expenditures, but this was frequently ignored. There was increased free trade to reduce inflation, and <b>high</b> <b>taxes</b> on sales and earnings {{to reduce the deficit}} caused by it. Initially, the plan was a success: the capital flights ended, interest and inflation rates were lowered, and economic activity increased. The money from privatizations allowed Argentina to repurchase many of the Brady Bonds issued during the crisis. The privatizations of electricity, water, and gas were more successful than previous ones. YPF, the national oil refinery, was privatized as well, but the state kept {{a good portion of the}} shares. The project to privatize the pension funds was resisted in Congress, and was approved as a mixed system that allowed both public and private options for workers. The national state also signed a fiscal pact with the provinces, so that they reduced their local deficits as well. Buenos Aires Province was helped with a fund that gave the governor a million pesos daily.|$|E
5|$|In 1648, the Fronde insurrection {{broke out}} in Paris, {{prompted}} by <b>high</b> <b>taxes,</b> increased food prices and disease. The Parlement of Paris, the Regency government of Anne of Austria and rebellious noble factions fought for several years {{to take control of}} the city and wider power. On 26 August, during the period known as the First Fronde, Anne ordered the arrest of some of the leaders of the Parlement of Paris; violence flared as a result, and the 27 August became known as another Day of the Barricades. The governor of the Bastille loaded and readied his guns to fire on the Hôtel de Ville, controlled by the parliament, although the decision was eventually taken not to shoot. Barricades were erected across the city and the royal government fled in September, leaving a garrison of 22 men behind in the Bastille. On 11 January 1649, the Fronde decided to take the Bastille, giving the task to Elbeuf, one of their leaders. Elbeuf's attack required only a token effort: five or six shots were fired at the Bastille, before it promptly surrendered on the 13 January. Pierre Broussel, one of the Fronde leaders, appointed his son as the governor and the Fronde retained it even after the ceasefire that March.|$|E
5|$|The Peasants' Revolt, {{also called}} Wat Tyler's Rebellion or the Great Rising, {{was a major}} {{uprising}} across large parts of England in 1381. The revolt had various causes, including the socio-economic and political tensions generated by the Black Death in the 1340s, the <b>high</b> <b>taxes</b> resulting from the conflict with France during the Hundred Years' War, and instability within the local leadership of London. The final trigger for the revolt was the intervention of a royal official, John Bampton, in Essex on 30 May 1381. His attempts to collect unpaid poll taxes in Brentwood ended in a violent confrontation, which rapidly spread across the south-east of the country. A wide spectrum of rural society, including many local artisans and village officials, rose up in protest, burning court records and opening the local gaols. The rebels sought a reduction in taxation, {{an end to the}} system of unfree labour known as serfdom and the removal of the King's senior officials and law courts.|$|E
