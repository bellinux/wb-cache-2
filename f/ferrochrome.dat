5|$|The British South Africa Company had {{reservations}} about devoting all of Southern Rhodesia's {{resources to the}} war effort, {{in part because of}} its desire to keep the colonial economy operating. There was indeed tightening of belts in the Rhodesias during the war, but not on the same scale as in Britain. The retail sector suffered, prices for many basic day-to-day items rose sharply, and exports plummeted as much of the white male citizenry went overseas to war, but mining, the industry on which Rhodesia's economic viability hinged, continued to operate successfully, despite occasional difficulties in obtaining manpower. The Company administration posted record outputs of gold and coal during 1916, and began to supply the Empire with the strategic metal <b>ferrochrome.</b> A flurry of new prospecting ventures led to the discovery of another strategic metal, tungsten, near Essexvale in southern Matabeleland in May 1917.|$|E
25|$|The {{manufacturing}} sector, already well-developed {{before the}} Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) in 1965, {{was given a}} major stimulus by the imposition of United Nations sanctions. The sanctions obliged Rhodesian industry to diversify and create many import-substitution undertakings to compensate for loss of traditional sources of imports. Rhodesian processing of local raw materials also grew rapidly. Major growth industries included steel and steel products, heavy equipment, transportation equipment, <b>ferrochrome,</b> textiles, and food processing.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ferrochrome</b> is {{produced}} by electric arc carbothermic reduction of chromite. Most of the world's <b>ferrochrome</b> {{is produced}} in South Africa, Kazakhstan and India, which have large domestic chromite resources. Increasing amounts are coming from Russia and China. The production of steel is the largest consumer of <b>ferrochrome,</b> especially the production of stainless steel with chromium content of 10 to 20% is the main application of <b>ferrochrome.</b> Chromium (Cr) {{is an element of}} the Periodic Table.|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} the Kemi Mine in the long {{production}} chain from chromite ore to stainless steel is to produce concentrates from ore as raw material for the manufacture of <b>ferrochrome</b> at the <b>ferrochrome</b> plant located in Tornio. The chrome contained in the <b>ferrochrome</b> generated as a product at the <b>ferrochrome</b> plant - used as an alloying material in the steel manufacturing process - {{is what makes the}} steel manufactured at the Tornio steel plant stainless.|$|E

50|$|IFCAL, {{a wholly}} owned {{subsidiary}} of IDCOL, {{is a government}} of Orissa undertaking located at Jajpur Road. It has capacity to manufacture 19,000 MT of high carbon <b>ferrochrome.</b> This plant, set up in 1969, is pioneer {{in the country to}} produce <b>ferrochrome.</b> The plant produces high carbon <b>ferrochrome</b> by using chromite ore, chromite briquettes, friable lumps, hard lumps in various proportions to meet customers' requirements.|$|E
50|$|The Kemi Mine {{opened in}} 1968. Initially, it {{operated}} as an open-pit mine. In the same year, the Tornio <b>ferrochrome</b> plant also started operating, {{with the first}} liquid metal pouring from the <b>ferrochrome</b> furnace (VKU1) taking place in August.|$|E
50|$|Ferro-Chrome factory of ElbasanFerro-Chrome factory of Elbasan {{started to}} operate in 1989. It is {{designed}} to produce high-carbon <b>ferrochrome</b> using as raw chromium material coming from the mines in the country, mainly from Bulqiza area. Currently Ferro-Chrome Factory of Elbasan works with two furnaces {{for the production of}} high-carbon <b>ferrochrome.</b> One of the furnaces was recently introduced into production, in early May 2013, after an investment of Balfin Group. Current production capacity is about 33’000 tons of <b>ferrochrome</b> per year. This product is entirely destined for export, mainly to the markets of developed industrial countries in Europe, Asia and America.|$|E
50|$|An alloy factory {{was opened}} in 1909 and was {{operated}} by the Newcastle Alloy Company, producing ferro alloys such as ferrosilicon, ferromolybdenum, ferrotungsten and <b>ferrochrome.</b> Because <b>ferrochrome</b> was an important ingredient {{in the manufacture of}} armoured steel, and Whinfield was the only manufacturer of this alloy in England, the factory was extended during World War I.|$|E
50|$|Tapping of the {{material}} from the furnace takes place intermittently. When enough smelted <b>ferrochrome</b> has accumulated in the hearth of the furnace, the tap hole is drilled open and a stream of molten metal and slag rushes down a trough into a chill or ladle. The <b>ferrochrome</b> solidifies in large castings, which are crushed for sale or further processed.|$|E

50|$|In the 1950s {{several new}} {{furnaces}} for production of <b>ferrochrome</b> and ferrosilicon were installed. During the 1960s, Bjølvefossen struggled to remain competitive, yet {{was able to}} invest in new production facilities on both production lines. In the 1970s, however, new technology in steel production reduced demand for the low-carbon <b>ferrochrome</b> that was produced. Government environmental regulations also {{put pressure on the}} production economy. Employment at the plant thus peaked at about 600 in this decade, before <b>ferrochrome</b> production was discontinued on the old production line in 1979 and on the new in 1983. Ferrosilicon production was prioritised to comply with environmental standards, furnaces were rebuilt to a closed type, making it possible to recycle excess heat in a steam turbine and to remove all dust from the discharge fumes. The dust, silica slurry, was found to be a saleable product.|$|E

50|$|Despite the {{opposition}} and the legal findings against the amendment, it was not repealed until March 1977, when newly elected President Jimmy Carter successfully pushed Congress to do so. The Ford administration had finally turned against the amendment in its last few months in 1976 and called {{for it to be}} repealed. The success of Carter's administration in persuading Congress to go along with this was due to a significant degree to a collapse in industry support for the amendment, as it had had the side effect of letting in more <b>ferrochrome</b> than raw chromium and caused the collapse of half of the American <b>ferrochrome</b> industry.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ferrochrome</b> Plant was {{initially}} commissioned in November 1969 as {{a division of}} IDCOL with an installed manufacturing capacity of 12,000 MT p.a. of High Carbon Ferro Chrome (HCFC) with reduction furnace. Subsequently, additional capacity of 10,000 MT p.a. of Low Carbon Ferro Chrome (LCFC) with slag furnace was created in October 1970. However, due to entry of relatively cheaper South African <b>ferrochrome</b> and general slow down in the demand of LCFC, IDCOL decided to stop the production of LCFC and with minor modifications, converted its slag furnace into reduction furnace in July, 1998, so as to produce an additional 6,000 MT p.a. of HCFC. With this, the total installed capacity of the HCFC stood at 18,000 MT p.a. The current installed capacity is 19,000 MT p.a. The rated capacity of the furnaces are 9 MVA and 6.5 MVA. The plant {{was taken over by}} IFCAL in April, 2002. The operations at the <b>Ferrochrome</b> plant include mining of chrome ore from open cast mines, beneficiation of ore and smelting. The production process involves reduction of Chromium Oxide to Chromium by Electric Arc Furnace to produce HCFC by further reduction of the metallic oxide with the help of carbon.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ferrochrome</b> {{is often}} {{classified}} {{by the amount}} of carbon and chrome it contains. The vast majority of FeCr produced is charge chrome from Southern Africa.
