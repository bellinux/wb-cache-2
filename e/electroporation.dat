5|$|<b>Electroporation</b> is {{the rapid}} {{increase}} in bilayer permeability induced by {{the application of a}} large artificial electric field across the membrane. Experimentally, <b>electroporation</b> is used to introduce hydrophilic molecules into cells. It is a particularly useful technique for large highly charged molecules such as DNA, which would never passively diffuse across the hydrophobic bilayer core. Because of this, <b>electroporation</b> {{is one of the key}} methods of transfection as well as bacterial transformation. It has even been proposed that <b>electroporation</b> resulting from lightning strikes could be a mechanism of natural horizontal gene transfer.|$|E
5|$|In {{studies of}} {{molecular}} and cellular biology {{it is often}} desirable to artificially induce fusion. The addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG) causes fusion without significant aggregation or biochemical disruption. This procedure is now used extensively, for example by fusing B-cells with myeloma cells. The resulting “hybridoma” from this combination expresses a desired antibody {{as determined by the}} B-cell involved, but is immortalized due to the melanoma component. Fusion can also be artificially induced through <b>electroporation</b> in a process known as electrofusion. It is believed that this phenomenon results from the energetically active edges formed during <b>electroporation,</b> which can act as the local defect point to nucleate stalk growth between two bilayers.|$|E
5|$|This {{increase}} in permeability primarily affects transport of ions and other hydrated species, {{indicating that the}} mechanism {{is the creation of}} nm-scale water-filled holes in the membrane. Although <b>electroporation</b> and dielectric breakdown both result from application of an electric field, the mechanisms involved are fundamentally different. In dielectric breakdown the barrier material is ionized, creating a conductive pathway. The material alteration is thus chemical in nature. In contrast, during <b>electroporation</b> the lipid molecules are not chemically altered but simply shift position, opening up a pore that acts as the conductive pathway through the bilayer as it is filled with water.|$|E
5|$|Another area of {{interest}} is in assessing whether keyhole surgery (laparoscopy) {{would be better than}} Whipple's procedure in treating the disease surgically, particularly in terms of recovery time. Irreversible <b>electroporation</b> is a relatively novel ablation technique that has shown promise in downstaging and prolonging survival in persons with locally advanced disease. It is especially suitable for treatment of tumors that are in proximity to peri-pancreatic vessels without risk of vascular trauma. The limited success of outcomes after surgery has led to a number of trials that were running in 2014 to test outcomes using chemotherapy or radiochemotherapy before surgery. This had previously not been found to be helpful, but is being trialed again, using drug combinations which have emerged from the many trials of post-operative therapies, such as FOLFIRINOX.|$|E
25|$|<b>Electroporation</b> uses {{high voltage}} {{electrical}} pulses to translocate DNA across the cell membrane (and cell wall, if present). In contrast, transduction involves the packaging of DNA into virus-derived particles, and using these virus-like particles {{to introduce the}} encapsulated DNA into the cell through a process resembling viral infection. Although <b>electroporation</b> and transduction are highly specialized methods, {{they may be the}} most efficient methods to move DNA into cells.|$|E
25|$|It is {{also added}} after <b>electroporation</b> of yeasts in {{transformation}} protocols, allowing the cells to recover {{by raising the}} osmolarity of the medium.|$|E
25|$|Methods for non-viral {{gene therapy}} include the {{injection}} of naked DNA, <b>electroporation,</b> the gene gun, sonoporation, magnetofection, {{the use of}} oligonucleotides, lipoplexes, dendrimers, and inorganic nanoparticles.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{the thermal}} effects in tissue, {{electric}} field can produce pores in the cellular membranes - a phenomenon called <b>electroporation.</b> This effect may affect cells beyond {{the range of}} thermal damage.|$|E
25|$|The chicken {{has long}} been a model {{organism}} for studying vertebrate developmental biology. As the embryo is readily accessible, its development can be easily followed (unlike mice). This also allows the use of <b>electroporation</b> for studying the effect of adding or silencing a gene. Other tools for perturbing their genetic makeup are chicken embryonic stem cells and viral vectors.|$|E
25|$|The DNA mixture, {{previously}} manipulated in vitro, {{is moved}} {{back into a}} living cell, {{referred to as the}} host organism. The methods used to get DNA into cells are varied, and the name applied to this step in the molecular cloning process will often depend upon the experimental method that is chosen (e.g. transformation, transduction, transfection, <b>electroporation).</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Electroporation</b> is the {{application}} of short pulses of electric fields on skin and has proven to increase skin permeability. The pulses are high voltage and {{on the order of}} milliseconds when applied. Charged molecules penetrate the skin more frequently than neutral molecules after the skin has been exposed to electric field pulses. Results have shown molecules on the order of 100 micrometers to easily permeate electroporated skin.|$|E
25|$|Transformation using <b>electroporation</b> was {{developed}} in the late 1980s, increasing the efficiency of in-vitro transformation and increasing the number of bacterial strains that could be transformed. Transformation of animal and plant cells was also investigated with the first transgenic mouse being created by injecting a gene for a rat growth hormone into a mouse embryo in 1982. In 1907 a bacterium that caused plant tumors, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, was discovered and in the early 1970s the tumor-inducing agent was found to be a DNA plasmid called the Ti plasmid. By removing the genes in the plasmid that caused the tumor and adding in novel genes, researchers were able to infect plants with A. tumefaciens and let the bacteria insert their chosen DNA into the genomes of the plants. Not all plant cells are susceptible to infection by A. tumefaciens, so other methods were developed, including <b>electroporation</b> and micro-injection. Particle bombardment was made possible with the invention of the Biolistic Particle Delivery System (gene gun) by John Sanford in the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|In {{studies of}} {{molecular}} and cellular biology {{it is often}} desirable to artificially induce fusion. Although {{this can be accomplished}} with the addition of calcium as discussed earlier, this procedure is often not feasible because calcium regulates many other biochemical processes and its addition would be a strong confound. Also, as mentioned, calcium induces massive aggregation as well as fusion. The addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG) causes fusion without significant aggregation or biochemical disruption. This procedure is now used extensively, for example by fusing B-cells with myeloma cells. The resulting “hybridoma” from this combination expresses a desired antibody as determined by the B-cell involved, but is immortalized due to the myeloma component. The mechanism of PEG fusion has not been definitively identified, but some researchers believe that the PEG, by binding a large number of water molecules, effectively decreases the chemical activity of the water and thus dehydrates the lipid headgroups. Fusion can also be artificially induced through <b>electroporation</b> in a process known as electrofusion. It is believed that this phenomenon results from the energetically active edges formed during <b>electroporation,</b> which can act as the local defect point to nucleate stalk growth between two bilayers.|$|E
25|$|Electrical pulses {{are also}} used to intracellularly deliver siRNA into cells. The cell {{membrane}} is made of phospholipids which makes it susceptible to an electric field. When quick but powerful electrical pulses are initiated the lipid molecules reorient themselves, while undergoing thermal phase transitions because of heating. This results {{in the making of}} hydrophilic pores and localized perturbations in the lipid bilayer cell membrane also causing a temporary loss of semipermeability. This allows for the escape of many intracellular contents, such as ions and metabolites as well as the simultaneous uptake of drugs, molecular probes, and nucleic acids. For cells that are difficult to transfect <b>electroporation</b> is advantageous however cell death is more probable under this technique.|$|E
25|$|DNA vaccination– an alternative, {{experimental}} {{approach to}} vaccination called DNA vaccination, created from an infectious agent's DNA, is under development. The proposed mechanism is the insertion (and expression, {{enhanced by the}} use of <b>electroporation,</b> triggering immune system recognition) of viral or bacterial DNA into human or animal cells. Some cells of the immune system that recognize the proteins expressed will mount an attack against these proteins and cells expressing them. Because these cells live for a very long time, if the pathogen that normally expresses these proteins is encountered at a later time, they will be attacked instantly by the immune system. One potential advantage of DNA vaccines is that they are very easy to produce and store. As of 2015, DNA vaccination is still experimental and is not approved for human use.|$|E
25|$|Genetically {{modified}} mice are {{the most}} common animal model for transgenic research. Transgenic mice are currently being used to study a variety of diseases including cancer, obesity, heart disease, arthritis, anxiety, and Parkinson’s disease. The two most common types of genetically modified mice are knockout mice and oncomice. Knockout mice are a type of mouse model that uses transgenic insertion to disrupt an existing gene’s expression. In order to create knockout mice, a transgene with the desired sequence is inserted into an isolated mouse blastocyst using <b>electroporation.</b> Then, homologous recombination occurs naturally within some cells, replacing the gene of interest with the designed transgene. Through this process, researchers were able to demonstrate that a transgene can be integrated into the genome of an animal, serve a specific function within the cell, and be passed down to future generations.|$|E
25|$|Initially, the DNA of {{interest}} {{needs to be}} isolated to provide a DNA segment of suitable size. Subsequently, a ligation procedure is used where the amplified fragment is inserted into a vector (piece of DNA). The vector (which is frequently circular) is linearised using restriction enzymes, and incubated with the fragment {{of interest}} under appropriate conditions with an enzyme called DNA ligase. Following ligation the vector with the insert of interest is transfected into cells. A number of alternative techniques are available, such as chemical sensitivation of cells, <b>electroporation,</b> optical injection and biolistics. Finally, the transfected cells are cultured. As the aforementioned procedures are of particularly low efficiency, {{there is a need}} to identify the cells that have been successfully transfected with the vector construct containing the desired insertion sequence in the required orientation. Modern cloning vectors include selectable antibiotic resistance markers, which allow only cells in which the vector has been transfected, to grow. Additionally, the cloning vectors may contain colour selection markers, which provide blue/white screening (alpha-factor complementation) on X-gal medium. Nevertheless, these selection steps do not absolutely guarantee that the DNA insert is present in the cells obtained. Further investigation of the resulting colonies must be required to confirm that cloning was successful. This may be accomplished by means of PCR, restriction fragment analysis and/or DNA sequencing.|$|E
500|$|For a Morpholino to be effective, {{it must be}} {{delivered}} past the cell membrane into the cytosol of a cell. Once in the cytosol, Morpholinos freely diffuse between the cytosol and nucleus, {{as demonstrated by the}} nuclear splice-modifying activity of Morpholinos observed after microinjection into the cytosol of cells. [...] Different methods are used for delivery into embryos, into cultured cells or into adult animals. A microinjection apparatus is usually used for delivery into an embryo, with injections most commonly performed at the single-cell or few-cell stage; an alternative method for embryonic delivery is <b>electroporation,</b> which can deliver oligos into tissues of later embryonic stages. Common techniques for delivery into cultured cells include the Endo-Porter peptide (which causes the Morpholino to be released from endosomes), the Special Delivery system (no longer commercially available, used a Morpholino-DNA heteroduplex and an ethoxylated polyethylenimine delivery reagent), <b>electroporation,</b> or scrape loading.|$|E
2500|$|The {{transformation}} efficiency {{using the}} [...] method decreases with plasmid size, and <b>electroporation</b> therefore {{may be a}} more effective method for the uptake of large plasmid DNA. Cells used in <b>electroporation</b> should be prepared first by washing in cold double-distilled water to remove charged particles that may create sparks during the <b>electroporation</b> process.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Electroporation</b> is {{used when}} the plant tissue {{does not contain}} cell walls. In this technique, [...] "DNA enters the plant cells through {{miniature}} pores which are temporarily caused by electric pulses." ...|$|E
2500|$|Genetically {{engineered}} crops have genes added or removed using {{genetic engineering}} techniques, [...] originally including gene guns, <b>electroporation,</b> microinjection and agrobacterium. More recently, CRISPR and TALEN offered much more precise and convenient editing techniques.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Electroporation</b> {{is another}} method of {{promoting}} competence. [...] In this method the cells are briefly shocked {{with an electric}} field of 10-20 kV/cm, which is thought to create holes in the cell membrane through which the plasmid DNA may enter. [...] After the electric shock, the holes are rapidly closed by the cell's membrane-repair mechanisms.|$|E
2500|$|The {{next step}} in the no-SCAR {{protocol}} is to transform the pCas9cr4 and pKDsg-XXX plasmids and linear oligonucleotides into the E [...]coli cells themselves. In order to achieve this, the cells are made to be electrocompetent; one such method, as used by Reisch and Pather, is using a glycerol/mannitol density step gradient, which is fast and simple. This allows for transformation through <b>electroporation</b> and introduction of the plasmids and DNA into the cells.|$|E
2500|$|Scientists can use viral or non-viral {{systems for}} {{delivery}} of the Cas9 and sgRNA into target cells. <b>Electroporation</b> of DNA, RNA or ribonucleocomplexes {{is the most common}} and cheapest system. This technique was used to edit CXCR4 and PD-1, knocking in new sequences to replace specific genetic [...] "letters" [...] in these proteins. The group was then able to sort the cells, using cell surface markers, to help identify successfully edited cells. Deep sequencing of a target site confirmed that knock-in genome modifications had occurred with up to ∼20% efficiency, which accounted for up to approximately one-third of total editing events. However, hard-to-transfect cells (stem cells, neurons, hematopoietic cells, etc.) require more efficient delivery systems such as those based on lentivirus (LVs), adenovirus (AdV) and adeno-associated virus (AAV).|$|E
50|$|<b>Electroporation</b> is {{a dynamic}} {{phenomenon}} {{that depends on the}} local transmembrane voltage at each point on the cell membrane. It is generally accepted that for a given pulse duration and shape, a specific transmembrane voltage threshold exists for the manifestation of the <b>electroporation</b> phenomenon (from 0.5 V to 1 V). This leads to the definition of an electric field magnitude threshold for <b>electroporation</b> (Eth). That is, only the cells within areas where E≧Eth are electroporated. If a second threshold (Eir) is reached or surpassed, <b>electroporation</b> will compromise the viability of the cells, i.e., irreversible <b>electroporation</b> (IRE).|$|E
50|$|In contrast, <b>electroporation</b> {{does not}} require a helper or donor strain. This helps avoid {{possible}} contamination with other strains. The introductionof the plasmid can be verified in the recipient strain in two days, making <b>electroporation</b> a faster and more efficient method of transformation. <b>Electroporation</b> however does not work with all bacteria and is mostly limited to well-characterized model organisms.|$|E
50|$|<b>Electroporation</b> is {{also highly}} {{efficient}} for {{the introduction of}} foreign genes into tissue culture cells, especially mammalian cells. For example, it {{is used in the}} process of producing knockout mice, as well as in tumor treatment, gene therapy, and cell-based therapy. The process of introducing foreign DNA into eukaryotic cells is known as transfection. <b>Electroporation</b> is highly effective for transfecting cells in suspension using <b>electroporation</b> cuvettes. <b>Electroporation</b> has proven efficient for use on tissues in vivo, for in utero applications as well as in ovo transfection. Adherent cells can also be transfected using <b>electroporation,</b> providing researchers with an alternative to trypsinizing their cells prior to transfection. One downside to <b>electroporation,</b> however, is that after the process the gene expression of over 7,000 genes can be affected. This can cause problems in studies where gene expression has to be controlled to ensure accurate and precise results.|$|E

50|$|<b>Electroporation,</b> or electropermeabilization, is a {{microbiology}} {{technique in}} which an electrical field is applied to cells {{in order to increase}} the permeability of the cell membrane, allowing chemicals, drugs, or DNA to be introduced into the cell. In microbiology, the process of <b>electroporation</b> is often used to transform bacteria, yeast, or plant protoplasts by introducing new coding DNA. If bacteria and plasmids are mixed together, the plasmids can be transferred into the bacteria after <b>electroporation,</b> though depending on what is being transferred cell-penetrating peptides or CellSqueeze could also be used. <b>Electroporation</b> works by passing thousands of volts across a distance of one to two millimeters of suspended cells in an <b>electroporation</b> cuvette (1.0 - 1.5 kV, 250 - 750V/cm). Afterwards, the cells have to be handled carefully until they {{have had a chance to}} divide, producing new cells that contain reproduced plasmids. This process is approximately ten times more effective than chemical transformation.|$|E
50|$|More {{recently}} a newer method of <b>electroporation,</b> termed electron-avalanche transfection, {{has been used}} in gene therapy experiments. By using a high-voltage plasma discharge, DNA was efficiently delivered following very short (microsecond) pulses.

5000|$|Reversible <b>electroporation</b> (RE): Temporary {{and limited}} {{pathways}} for molecular transport via nanopores are formed, {{but after the}} end of the electric pulse, the transport ceases and the cells remain viable.
