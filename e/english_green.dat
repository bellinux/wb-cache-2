6000|$|It was {{not only}} {{messengers}} fiery red with haste and charged with the destiny of nations who were made welcome {{at the gates of}} Blois. If any man of accomplishment came that way, he was sure of an audience, and something for his pocket. The courtiers would have received Ben Jonson like Drummond of Hawthornden, and a good pugilist like Captain Barclay. They were catholic, as none but the entirely idle can be catholic. It might be Pierre, called Dieu d'amours, the juggler; or it might be three high English minstrels; or the two men, players of ghitterns, from the kingdom of Scotland, who sang the destruction of the Turks; or again Jehan Rognelet, player of instruments of music, who played and danced {{with his wife and two}} children; they would each be called into the castle to give a taste of his proficiency before my lord the duke.[49] Sometimes the performance was of a more personal interest, and produced much the same sensations as are felt on an <b>English</b> <b>green</b> on the arrival of a professional cricketer, or round an English billiard-table during a match between Roberts and Cook. This was when Jehan Nègre, the Lombard, came to Blois and played chess against all these chess-players, and won much money from my lord and his intimates; or when Baudet Harenc of Chalons made ballades before all these ballade-makers.[50] ...|$|E
6000|$|You {{asked me}} on Christmas Eve about my children. My second {{daughter}} {{is going to}} be married {{in the course of the}} summer to Charles Collins, the brother of Wilkie Collins, the novelist. The father was one of the most famous painters of <b>English</b> <b>green</b> lanes and coast pieces. He was bred an artist; is a writer, too, and does [...] "The Eye Witness," [...] in [...] "All the Year Round." [...] He is a gentleman, accomplished, and amiable. My eldest daughter has not yet started any conveyance on the road to matrimony (that I know of); but it is likely enough that she will, as she is very agreeable and intelligent. They are both very pretty. My eldest boy, Charley, has been in Barings' house for three or four years, and is now going to Hong Kong, strongly backed up by Barings, to buy tea on his own account, as a means of forming a connection and seeing more of the practical part of a merchant's calling, before starting in London for himself. His brother Frank (Jeffrey's godson) I have just recalled from France and Germany, to come and learn business, and qualify himself to join his brother on his return from the Celestial Empire. The next boy, Sydney Smith, is designed for the navy, and is in training at Portsmouth, awaiting his nomination. He is about three foot high, with the biggest eyes ever seen, and is known in the Portsmouth parts as [...] "Young Dickens, who can do everything." ...|$|E

40|$|Language: <b>English.</b> <b>Green</b> Information System (IS) {{has become}} an {{important}} topic in IT management research and practice {{in the last few}} years due to economic opportunities and increasing pressure from stakeholders. However, many private organizations fail to manage their environmental efforts in an adequate manner since they neglect the strategic aspects of this topic. This paper discloses the strategic relevance of Green IS on the basis of a literature review that refers to fundamental approaches of Strategic Management and Information Systems research and emphasizes the necessity of aligning business, sustainability, and IT domain. The debate is emphasized by a multiple-case study that analyses the Green IS implementation practices of three companies on the basis of semi-structured interviews. The empirical findings of the cross-case analysis indicate that there is no consistent approach for aligning Green IS with corporate sustainability goals and business objectives so far. For that purpose, I conceptualize a Strategic Green IS Alignment Framework and identify four distinct Green IS strategies. The proposed framework is supposed to provide guidance for decision-makers in selecting an appropriate Green IS strategy tha...|$|E
40|$|The change {{relates to}} {{territorial}} understanding in the 90 s, has caused that suburban open spaces, where daily {{millions of people}} are living, begin {{to play an important role}} in urban policies of many cities and metropolitan areas. Although the development of experiences whit an important revaluation of these spaces, for example Oslo, Hamburg or Vitoria, the indifferent attitude of politicians and urban planers about the urban periphery, has meant thal those areas near downtowns, are not areas of opportunity, but areas of uncertainty. However, the English territorial scenario could be defined as an unusual case. The implementation and permanence of the Green Belt in urban planning, it is a unique case. Originally it was conceived as an agricultural belt that would control the growth of English cities after World War II. So the periphery has been protected against housing development, keeping a balanced percentage of rural and urban land around the cities. Such circumstance gives many and beneficial added values to surrounding areas. The integration of nature and city, improving the connection between different open spaces, promoting formal and informal recreational activities for people, making a better accessibility to Countryside, protecting the agrarian land, acting as a green lung for the city, have a common objective: to improve the quality of life to 20 mill people. Therefore the suburban areas in English cities, are in a privileged position in order to add value to open spaces, mainly to Green Belt as a high and important prototype regarding other experiences. This singularity of the <b>English</b> <b>Green</b> Belt is the most interested and valuable, not only as an exclusive urban legacy, but an opportunity to approach the English territory in the future. The physical and temporary analysis from his origin, it will be helpful in order to formalize his permanence and certificate his evolution. But, is this evolution according to present day situation? Analyzing the London Green Belt position and behavior in new circumstances; it will be the way to understand the current situation. This case of study is origin and reality of an idea becoming a fact. It is the cornerstone in the consolidation process and the pioneer in every change of the Green Belt. The understanding of this case of study will open a discussion line which affects many current experiences and focusing in one question: Would be the <b>English</b> <b>Green</b> Belt able to tackle with current requests? The house demand, sustainability patterns, the suburban agriculture aclivity as urban-territorial strategy, the suburban multifunctionality, the sectorial management to improve the environment protection and regeneration, and the Green Infrastructure as new model to global interpretation of open spaces; these points become the lines of work to clarify the Green Belt roll in the city's future.
