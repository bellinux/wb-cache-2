40|$|The Thermal Radiation Analyzer System, TRASYS, is a {{computer}} software system with generalized capability to solve the radiation related aspects of thermal analysis problems. TRASYS computes the total thermal radiation environment for a spacecraft in orbit. The software calculates internode radiation interchange data as well as incident and absorbed heat rate data originating from environmental radiant heat sources. TRASYS provides data of both types in a format directly usable by such thermal analyzer programs as SINDA/FLUINT (available from COSMIC, program number MSC- 21528). One primary feature of TRASYS {{is that it allows}} users to write their own driver programs to organize and direct the preprocessor and processor library routines in solving specific thermal radiation problems. The preprocessor first reads and converts the user's geometry input data into the form used by the processor library routines. Then, the preprocessor accepts the user's driving logic, written in the TRASYS modified FORTRAN language. In many cases, the user has a choice of routines to solve a given problem. Users may also provide their own routines where desirable. In particular, the user may write output routines to provide for an interface between TRASYS and any thermal analyzer program using the R-C network concept. Input to the TRASYS program consists of Options and Edit data, Model data, and Logic Flow and Operations data. Options and Edit data provide for basic program control and user <b>edit</b> <b>capability.</b> The Model data describe the problem in terms of geometry and other properties. This information includes surface geometry data, documentation data, nodal data, block coordinate system data, form factor data, and flux data. Logic Flow and Operations data house the user's driver logic, including the sequence of subroutine calls and the subroutine library. Output from TRASYS consists of two basic types of data: internode radiation interchange data, and incident and absorbed heat rate data. The flexible structure of TRASYS allows considerable freedom in the definition and choice of solution method for a thermal radiation problem. The program's flexible structure has also allowed TRASYS to retain the same basic input structure as the authors update it in order to keep up with changing requirements. Among its other important features are the following: 1) up to 3200 node problem size capability with shadowing by intervening opaque or semi-transparent surfaces; 2) choice of diffuse, specular, or diffuse/specular radiant interchange solutions; 3) a restart capability that minimizes recomputing; 4) macroinstructions that automatically provide the executive logic for orbit generation that optimizes the use of previously completed computations; 5) a time variable geometry package that provides automatic pointing of the various parts of an articulated spacecraft and an automatic look-back feature that eliminates redundant form factor calculations; 6) capability to specify submodel names to identify sets of surfaces or components as an entity; and 7) subroutines to perform functions which save and recall the internodal and/or space form factors in subsequent steps for nodes with fixed geometry during a variable geometry run. There are two machine versions of TRASYS v 27 : a DEC VAX version and a Cray UNICOS version. Both versions require installation of the NASADIG library (MSC- 21801 for DEC VAX or COS- 10049 for CRAY), which is available from COSMIC either separately or bundled with TRASYS. The NASADIG (NASA Device Independent Graphics Library) plot package provides a pictorial representation of input geometry, orbital/orientation parameters, and heating rate output as a function of time. NASADIG supports Tektronix terminals. The CRAY version of TRASYS v 27 is written in FORTRAN 77 for batch or interactive execution and has been implemented on CRAY X-MP and CRAY Y-MP series computers running UNICOS. The standard distribution medium for MSC- 21959 (CRAY version without NASADIG) is a 1600 BPI 9 -track magnetic tape in UNIX tar format. The standard distribution medium for COS- 10040 (CRAY version with NASADIG) is a set of two 6250 BPI 9 -track magnetic tapes in UNIX tar format. Alternate distribution media and formats are available upon request. The DEC VAX version of TRASYS v 27 is written in FORTRAN 77 for batch execution (only the plotting driver program is interactive) and has been implemented on a DEC VAX 8650 computer under VMS. Since the source codes for MSC- 21030 and COS- 10026 are in VAX/VMS text library files and DEC Command Language files, COSMIC will only provide these programs in the following formats: MSC- 21030, TRASYS (DEC VAX version without NASADIG) is available on a 1600 BPI 9 -track magnetic tape in VAX BACKUP format (standard distribution medium) or in VAX BACKUP format on a TK 50 tape cartridge; COS- 10026, TRASYS (DEC VAX version with NASADIG), is available in VAX BACKUP format on a set of three 6250 BPI 9 -track magnetic tapes (standard distribution medium) or a set of three TK 50 tape cartridges in VAX BACKUP format. TRASYS was last updated in 1993...|$|E
