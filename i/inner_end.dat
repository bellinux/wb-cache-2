25|$|The first {{production}} power car, numbered 43002, {{was delivered}} in late 1975, with a significantly different appearance from the prototype. The streamlined front end lacked conventional buffers, and the drawgear was hidden under a cowling. The single cab front window was {{much larger than}} the prototype's, and side windows were included. There was also no driving position at the <b>inner</b> <b>end.</b>|$|E
25|$|On tilled soil a {{one-piece}} roller has {{the disadvantage}} that when turning corners the outer {{end of the}} roller has to rotate much faster than the <b>inner</b> <b>end,</b> forcing one or both ends to skid. A one-piece roller turned on soft ground will skid up a heap of soil at the outer radius, leaving heaps, which is counter-productive. Rollers are often made {{in two or three}} sections to reduce this problem, and the Cambridge roller overcomes it altogether by mounting many small segments onto one axle so that they can each rotate at local ground-speed.|$|E
25|$|The Wigtown Bay Sailing Club welcomes all visiting yachtsmen {{whether they}} arrive by sea or by land with trailered boats. The clubhouse is {{situated}} on the harbour and has all the usual facilities. The harbour dries 3 hours either side of high water, {{and there is a}} dedicated visitors' berth at the outer end of the quay. There are also two slipways for launching trailer boats or dinghies, one of which is at the <b>inner</b> <b>end</b> of the quay and is sheltered in all weathers. The other, which gives access into the bay, can be used at virtually any state of the tide. The club is active throughout the summer with dinghy or cruiser races organised for most weekends and some races mid-week.|$|E

25|$|Initially, the {{structure}} of the Hurricane's cantilever wing consisted of two steel spars, which possessed considerable strength and stiffness. The wing was described by aviation publication Flight as being relatively straightforward to manufacture, employing simple vertical jigs to attach the two spars, after which the wing ribs would be installed using horizontal bolts, forming separate units between the front and rear spars. Hydraulically-actuated split trailing edge flaps were present on the <b>inner</b> <b>end</b> of the wings. The original wing was predominantly fabric-covered, like the fuselage, while some use of lightweight metal sheets was made upon the exterior surface of the inner wing and its leading edge. The majority of the Flight control surfaces, such as the Frise-type ailerons, also had fabric coverings.|$|E
25|$|The T.III's {{alternative}} undercarriages {{were both}} fixed, {{with the two}} legs independent of each, avoiding the cross bracing which would have interfered with the bomb or torpedo release. Each mainwheel was on a horizontal axle supported at the outer end by a longitudinal V-strut from the wing underside. There were two more pairs of Vs, one fixed below the wing {{and the other on}} the lower fuselage, angled towards each other to support the <b>inner</b> <b>end</b> of the axle. A tailskid completed the undercarriage. The T.III's twin float undercarriage projected just forward of the nose. The floats were mounted on the fuselage by two sets of N-struts, with diagonal transverse bracing between them, on each float. Both wood and aluminium floats were available. Fitting floats added 243kg (536lb) to the unladened weight and reduced the maximum speed by 11km/h (7mph).|$|E
25|$|Peristome is double; inner lip {{recognizable}} as a narrow ridge, contacting the body whorl and closing the umbilicus (visible in not fully grown specimens); outer lip is protruding, forming a small, free tube. Aperture is pear-shaped, whitish inside, with a sinulus {{which is not}} defined at the palatal side. Lamella parietalis (= superior) very prominent, reaching {{the margin of the}} peristome, which is conspicuously curved at that site; its <b>inner</b> <b>end</b> merging into the lamella spiralis. Inside the shell, the lamella columellaris reaches somewhat further than ventrally, whereas both the lamella subcolumellaris and the spiralis are slightly shorter; without a lamella inserta. In frontal view, the lamella columellaris is visible as a low, nearly straight lamella, not reaching the margin of the peristome, whereas the lamella subcolumellaris reaches the margin of the peristome in most specimens. With six plicae palatales: plica principalis, shortly visible in frontal view, ventro-laterally accompanied by five short, somewhat curved plicae, increasingly diverging from the principalis and nearly running parallel which each other, so that the lowest one runs most obliquely. Inside the body whorl, the plicae are connected by a lunella-like ridge of callus. Clausilial blade is simple, ending with a sharp angle.|$|E
40|$|Instead of the single-channel pore {{proposed}} earlier [Wooldridge, D. E. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81, 5609 - 5612] for {{the transit}} of conductance ions through the neural membrane, a pore {{with a second}} channel for "influence ions" of calcium or magnesium is considered in this paper. By entering trapping centers at the closed <b>inner</b> <b>ends</b> of the new channels, the influence ions are postulated to alter the rates of chemical reactions that change the configurational state of the gates guarding the <b>inner</b> <b>ends</b> of the nearby conductance channels. This makes the permeability of the conductance channels strongly dependent on voltage. Using a four-state reaction scheme for both the sodium and potassium pore systems, a computer model of the membrane conductance is constructed. When suitable values are assigned to its parameters, the model closely reproduces {{the results of the}} Hodgkin-Huxley voltage-clamp and action potential experiments...|$|R

40|$|A {{rough terrain}} vehicle is {{described}} which includes auxiliary wheels {{that can be}} deployed to avoid overturning the vehicle when turning while traversing a slope, to climb an embankment or the like, and to right the vehicle when it is overturned. The vehicle includes a pair of front and rear primary wheels, {{and a pair of}} auxiliary arms having <b>inner</b> <b>ends</b> pivotally mounted on the front wheel axes and outer ends that carry auxiliary wheels. A motor can turn the arms to move the auxiliary wheels from a stowed position about halfway between the front and rear wheels and above the ground, to a second position against the ground to stabilize the vehicle. The arms can be turned more than 180. degree. to move the auxiliary wheels in front of the front primary wheels to help climb an embankment.

2500|$|Different {{recognition}} sub-units {{are used}} for actin or tubulin although there is some overlap. In actin the subunits that bind with prefoldin are probably PFD3 and PFD4, which bind in two places one between residues 60-79 and the other between residues 170-198. The actin is recognized, loaded and delivered to the cytosolic chaperonin (CCT) in an open conformation by the <b>inner</b> <b>end</b> of prefoldin’s [...] "tentacles” (see the image and note). The contact when actin is delivered is so brief that a tertiary complex is not formed, immediately freeing the prefoldin.|$|E
6000|$|Obliquity of the eyebrows.--Two points {{alone in}} the above {{description}} require further elucidation, and these are very curious ones; namely, the raising of the <b>inner</b> <b>ends</b> of the eyebrows, and the drawing down of {{the corners of the}} mouth. With respect to the eyebrows, they may occasionally be seen to assume an oblique position in persons suffering from deep dejection or anxiety; for instance, I have observed this movement in a mother whilst speaking about her sick son; and it is sometimes excited by quite trifling or momentary causes of real or pretended distress. The eyebrows assume this position owing to the contraction of certain muscles (namely, the orbiculars, corrugators, and pyramidals of the nose, which together tend to lower and contract the eyebrows) being partially checked by the more powerful action of the central fascim of the frontal muscle. These latter fasciae by their contraction raise the <b>inner</b> <b>ends</b> alone of the eyebrows; and as the corrugators at the same time draw the eyebrows together, their <b>inner</b> <b>ends</b> become puckered into a fold or lump. This fold is a highly characteristic point in the appearance of the eyebrows when rendered oblique, as may be seen in figs. 2 and 5, Plate II. The eyebrows are at the same time somewhat roughened, owing to the hairs being made to project. Dr. J. Crichton Browne has also often noticed in melancholic patients who keep their eyebrows persistently oblique, [...] "a peculiar acute arching of the upper eyelid." [...] A trace of this may be observed by comparing the right and left eyelids of the young man in the photograph (fig. 2, Plate II.); for {{he was not able to}} act equally on both eyebrows. This is also shown by the unequal furrows on the two sides of his forehead. The acute arching of the eyelids ...|$|R

50|$|To {{simplify the}} {{marshalling}} of trains and reduce their overall length, the original four-wheeled stock was close coupled in pairs from 1887 onwards. This involved removing the chopper couplers {{from one end of}} each vehicle and replacing them with conventional side buffers on one carriage and rubbing plates on the other. A link and pin coupling then joined the <b>inner</b> <b>ends</b> of the carriages whilst conventional chopper couplings were retained on the outer ends of the each pair.|$|R
2500|$|Initially, the Laotian Aviation {{wore the}} same rank {{insignia}} as their French and ANL counterparts, whose sequence followed closely the French Air Force pattern defined by the 1956 regulations.

2500|$|The {{unstable}} cordite ammunition {{carried by}} Invincible, {{coupled with the}} weakness of her turret design and armour, and bad ammunition handling practices, resulted in a catastrophic explosion from [...] "Q" [...] turret's magazine, which blew the ship into two halves which sank separately, each protruding from the sea as the <b>inner</b> <b>end</b> settled on the shallow bottom. Of Invincibles 1,021 crew, there were just six survivors, pulled from the water by attendant destroyers. Hood was not amongst them. The Battle of Jutland was ultimately an expensive stalemate; both sides suffered further losses during the night action but the strategic situation remained unchanged. The Royal Navy had suffered over 6,000 fatal casualties, three times the German losses, but remained {{in control of the}} North Sea while the High Seas Fleet was forced to retire to harbour.|$|E
2500|$|There he had {{a temple}} built, {{and it was a}} {{sizeable}} building, with a door on the side-wall near the gable.

A sacrificial bowl [...] was placed on the platform and in it a sacrificial twig like a priest's aspergillumwhich was used to sprinkle blood from the bowl.

2500|$|The level 9 adit was {{the longest}} built at Rhosydd, {{measuring}} [...] from the mouth to the haulage system at the <b>inner</b> <b>end.</b> It had a gradient of 1 in 86 to aid drainage, and took eight years to complete, being completed in 1870 or 1871. During its construction, an internal incline was built downwards from floor 5, so that rock from higher levels could be lowered down to the mine exit. Trucks were moved along the adit by attaching them to an endless rope, which was driven by a [...] diameter pitchback water wheel located {{near the mouth of}} the adit. They were marshalled into rakes of about 12 wagons, with a gripper truck or megryn at both ends. A screw handle was used to attach the front megryn to the rope, both on the line of full trucks in the mine and on empty ones outside the adit. The rope was then set in motion, and when the couplings between the trucks were tight, the gripper on the back megryn was applied. When they reached the far end, the grippers were released, as the water wheel took some time to stop. A similar system was used on the Glasgow Subway when it first opened. For most of its length, there were only three rails in the adit, the centre one being shared by both tracks. They fanned out into double tracks at both ends, and for [...] in the middle, so that trucks moving in opposite directions could pass one another. Communication between the operators at either end was by a bell system.|$|E
