5000|$|A box tool {{is mounted}} on the turret of a turret lathe or screw machine. It is {{essentially}} a toolpost that brings its <b>follower</b> <b>rest</b> along with it. A tool bit (or several tool bits) and a compact <b>follower</b> <b>rest</b> (usually V-shaped or with two rollers) are mounted opposite {{each other in a}} body which surrounds the workpiece (forms a [...] "box" [...] around it). As the tool bit puts a lateral deflecting force on the workpiece, the <b>follower</b> <b>rest</b> opposes it, providing rigidity. A different and popular type of box tool uses two rollers rather than a <b>follower</b> <b>rest.</b> One roller is called a [...] "sizing roller" [...] and the other roller is called a [...] "burnishing roller". The rollers turn with the stock to reduce scarring on the finished turn. Opposing tool bits may be used (instead of a rest) to cancel each other's deflecting forces (called a [...] "balanced turning tool"), in which case the box tool begins to overlap in form, function, and identity with a hollow mill.|$|E

5000|$|Long {{workpieces}} {{often need}} to be supported in the middle, as cutting tools can push (bend) the work piece away from where the centers can support them, because cutting metal produces tremendous forces that tend to vibrate or even bend the workpiece. This extra support can be provided by a steady rest (also called a steady, a fixed steady, a center rest, or sometimes, confusingly, a center). It stands stationary from a rigid mounting on the bed, and it supports the workpiece at the rest's center, typically with three contact points 120° apart. A <b>follower</b> <b>rest</b> (also called a follower or a travelling steady) is similar, but it is mounted to the carriage rather than the bed, which means that as the tool bit moves, the <b>follower</b> <b>rest</b> [...] "follows along" [...] (because they are both rigidly connected to the same moving carriage).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} a Multi-Tip Tool Structure for fast turning process, to prolong overall tool life as well as to shorten machining time. Instead of one cutting edge in regular turning process, several cutting tools are used simultaneously in this assembly.

40|$|Abstract. Turning {{operation}} of slender shaft poses {{a great challenge}} in machining field. It {{is due to the}} fact that the accuracy of machined workpiece depends almost completely on the operator’s skill by using conventional methods. To improve the accuracy of slender shaft with less operation skill, this paper presents an error compensation system, which includes a fuzzy PID controller. As a part of the controller, the traditional PID controller is used to control a <b>follower</b> <b>rest</b> for improving the dimensional accuracy. And the fuzzy controller incorporates skilled operators ’ knowledge into an automatic machining system. At the end, turning experiments are carried out to verify the efficacy of the error compensation system. The experimental results indicate that the dimensional accuracy of slender shaft using the system is higher and more stable than that by using conventional methods...|$|E

5000|$|Beginning on 9 February 2013, {{approximately}} 200 men led by his brother, Agbimuddin Kiram intruded into neighbouring Sabah in Malaysia {{by entering}} illegally into Lahad Datu, {{in an effort}} to assert the former Sulu Sultanate's claim to the state.

When the small group arrived at the embassy's gates, their persuers had cought up with them and a firefight ensued. Initially, the U.S. guards present refused to allow Johnson's men inside, but as it became clear that they were about to be killed, the U.S. security officers allowed them at least to seek shelter behind a wall that protected the embassy's entry.

40|$|As {{a common}} practice, various firms {{initially}} make information {{and access to}} their products/services scarce within a social network; identifying influential players that facilitate information dissemination emerges as a pivotal step for their success. In this paper, we tackle this problem using a stylized model that features payoff externalities and local network effects, and the network designer is allowed to release information to only a subset of players (leaders); these targeted players make their contributions first and the <b>rest</b> <b>followers</b> move subsequently after observing the leaders' decisions. In the presence of incomplete information, the signaling incentive drives the optimal selection of leaders {{and can lead to}} a first-order materialistic effect on the equilibrium outcomes. We propose a novel index for the key leader selection (i. e., a single player to provide information to) that can be substantially different from the key player index in Ballester et al.

We also show that in undirected graphs, the optimal leader group identified in Zhou and Chen (2013) is exactly the optimal follower group when signaling is present. The pecking order in complete graphs suggests that the leader should be selected by the ascending order of intrinsic valuations. We also examine the out-tree hierarchical structure that describes a typical economic organization.

5000|$|Certain cams can be {{characterized}} by their displacement diagrams, which reflect the changing position a roller follower (a shaft with a rotating wheel at the end) would make as the cam rotates about an axis. These diagrams relate angular position, usually in degrees, to the radial displacement experienced at that position. Displacement diagrams are traditionally presented as graphs with non-negative values. A simple displacement diagram illustrates the follower motion at a constant velocity rise followed by a similar return with a dwell in between as depicted in figure 2. The rise is {{the motion of the}} follower away from the cam center, dwell is the motion where the <b>follower</b> is at <b>rest,</b> and return is the motion of the follower toward the cam center.However, the most common type is in the valve actuators in internal combustion engines. Here, the cam profile is commonly symmetric and at rotational speeds generally met with, very high acceleration forces develop. Ideally, a convex curve between the onset and maximum position of lift reduces acceleration, but this requires impractically large shaft diameters relative to lift. Thus, in practice, the points at which lift begins and ends mean that a tangent to the base circle appears on the profile. This is continuous with a tangent to the tip circle. In designing the cam, the lift and the dwell angle [...] are given.

40|$|The {{primary goal}} of this thesis is to {{consider}} probation practice and the contribution of leadership to the achievement of effective service delivery in the New Zealand Community Probation Service {{during a period of}} major change. In relation to this goal, the objectives are: (a) to explore Probation Officers' and Service Managers' understandings of the political and managerial changes affecting the New Zealand Probation Service; (b) to ascertain Probation Officers' and Service Managers' views of probation values, knowledge, skills and practice; (c) to understand Probation Officers' and Service Managers' views of the assessment of service delivery; (d) to identify how Probation Officers and Service Managers define and what they understand by the concepts of leadership and effective service delivery; (e) to examine how the relationship between leadership and effective service delivery is perceived and acted upon by Probation Officers and Service Managers; and (f) to determine the structures and processes that are necessary to maximise the contribution of leadership to the achievement of effective service delivery. The research participants comprised a purposeful sample of 27 Probation Officers and 8 Service Managers (front-line staff involved in service delivery) recruited from among those employed in the northern and southern administrative regions of the Probation Service. Qualitative data were collected via personal in-depth interviews and augmented by focus group discussions. The key findings of the study are that: first, effective service delivery was not perceived to be limited to the reduction of recidivism alone, but to also include the client's broader social experience, recognising that positive social benefit can extend beyond the simple measurement of offending behaviour. second, leaders must be seen to be credible if they are to create willing <b>followers.</b> This credibility <b>rested</b> upon the leader's possession of relevant practice knowledge and skills, their demonstrated commitment to professional practice, their ability to provide clear direction for practice and their ability to ensure that adequate resources are available to achieve service delivery goals; third, a positive association was drawn between a leader's professional experience, possession of personal power and ability to influence Probation Officer practice. In essence, the leader's experience and competence has a bearing upon confidence in the leader. Participants also posited a connection between positive leadership, the development of a 'team' culture, Probation Officer work performance and service delivery. Overall, the linkage between leadership and effective service delivery was conceived of as being dependent upon the ability of leaders to enhance the practice of Probation Officers. From this perspective, five leadership challenges for senior managers in the Probation Service were identified. These included the challenges to: (a) establish the professional foundations of probation practice; (b) develop a clearer, integrated statement of purpose, values and beliefs that identifies probation as a distinct area of professional practice; (c) develop probation practice in a flexible manner, incorporating international influences while remaining responsive to features and events that reflect the dynamic character of the local environment; (d) to ensure that the integrative structures, processes and new roles/positions necessary to underpin and support probation practice are introduced or implemented, notably for the provision of professional supervision; and (e) to introduce a multi-dimensional approach to the assessment of service delivery that includes both quantitative and qualitative indicators of aspects other than recidivism alone. It is acknowledged that these challenges have significant resource implications...|$|R
