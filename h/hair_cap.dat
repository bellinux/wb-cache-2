40|$|BACKGROUND: Family {{members of}} {{laboratory}} animal workers {{are at risk}} of developing allergy to laboratory animals. Little is known about the spreading of laboratory animal allergens outside the animal facilities. OBJECTIVE: To assess the presence of laboratory animal allergens in dust collected from mattresses of laboratory animal workers and unexposed controls. METHODS: Mouse and rat urinary proteins were measured in samples of mattress dust collected by laboratory animal workers and unexposed controls. In addition, rat and mouse allergens were determined in extracts of hair-covering caps, used during laboratory animal work, to estimate spreading of allergen through dust captured on hair. Allergen concentrations on <b>hair</b> <b>caps</b> were compared with exposure measured by personal airborne dust sampling. RESULTS: Levels of rat urinary allergens (RUA) and mouse urinary allergens (MUA) and mouse urinary protein (MUP) 8, a specific pheromone-binding mouse allergen, were significantly higher in mattress samples of laboratory animal workers than in those of controls. Hair-covering caps used in animal facilities harboured large amounts of RUA and MUA, which correlated significantly with exposure measured by the personal sampling technique in the animal facility. CONCLUSIONS: Occupational laboratory animal allergens are detectable in mattress dust of laboratory animal workers. Transfer of allergens via uncovered hair of animal workers is likely contributing to this phenomenon. This study stresses the importance of using <b>hair</b> <b>caps</b> to prevent spreading of occupational allergen...|$|R

40|$|Studies of the {{endangered}} Kirtland's warbler in relation to landscape ecosystems were conducted from 1988 on a large wildfire-burn surrounding Mack Lake in southeastern Oscoda County, Michigan. A landscape ecosystem approach was used to distinguish and high-elevation segments of the landscape, as well as 11 local ecosystem types. The ecosystems were distinguished by physiography, microclimate, soil, and vegetation. The early occurrence of the warblers was strongly related to landscape structure, to the broad and high-elevation areas and the local ecosystem types within them. Territories of male warblers were observed in 5 of the 11 ecosystems. The five ecosystem types where warblers were observed were charac- terized by (1) a physiography of level or rolling terrain; (2) soil series of Grayling, Graycalm, Montcalm, or (3) uplands with relatively warm temperature during the breeding season; (4) vegetation dominated by low sweet blueberry, bearberry, wintergreen, northern pin oak, blue stem grasses, and <b>hair</b> <b>cap</b> moss; and (5) canopy of relatively tall, dense, and patchy jack pine and oak.

Programa de Pós-Graduação em NutriçãoO comércio {{informal}} de alimentos de rua desempenha papel importante em muitos países, destacando-se como fonte de emprego e de variedade de alimentos convenientes e acessíveis para as pessoas. Por outro lado, apresenta aspectos que podem comprometer a segurança dos alimentos comercializados. Apesar da importância dos alimentos de rua há poucos estudos na maioria dos municípios brasileiros, inclusive em Florianópolis, onde o estudo foi realizado. O objetivo deste estudo foi caracterizar o perfil do manipulador de alimentos de rua e os alimentos comercializados na região central da cidade de Florianópolis-SC. Realizou-se um estudo exploratório, descritivo, de natureza quali-quantitativa, com todos os vendedores de alimentos de rua cadastrados na lista da prefeitura local, que operavam em pontos de venda estacionários. Foram coletadas informações sobre as características sociodemográficas, gerais, do ponto de venda e as práticas de higiene do vendedor por meio de observação e de um roteiro de entrevista estruturado, pré-testado, entre novembro e dezembro de 2011. Dentre os 50 participantes do estudo, 60 % eram do sexo masculino, a maior parte era casada e tinha idade entre 40 e 59 anos. Predominaram vendedores sem ensino formal ou fundamental incompleto e com estimativa de venda em reais de até dois salários mínimos. A partir dos dados sobre a atividade laboral, verificou-se que os pontos de vendas eram operados, em sua maioria, por um vendedor e que 90 % não tinham outra fonte de renda. O interesse e a dificuldade em encontrar outro emprego foram os principais motivos que levaram os vendedores a trabalharem com a atividade. Dentre os vendedores, 46 % nunca haviam realizado o curso para manipulação de alimentos e 28 % não tinham o atestado de saúde. Com relação às práticas de higiene, foi observado que 86 % dos vendedores usavam jaleco e o mantinham limpo. A maioria protegia parcialmente os cabelos com touca ou boné e quase ¾ usavam adornos. Dentre os 15 tabagistas deste estudo, 20 % informaram fumar durante o preparo dos alimentos. Observou-se que quase todos manipulavam o dinheiro e o alimento, sem higienizar as mãos. Com base nas informações sobre o tipo de alimento comercializado, verificou-se que 30 % dos participantes vendiam pipoca preparada no ponto de venda; 28 %, doces e salgadinhos industrializados; 20 %, cachorro-quente e churrasquinho; 22 %, alimentos preparados com antecedência ou pré-preparados e finalizados no ponto de venda. O percentual de vendedores que tinha o curso para manipulação de alimentos foi maior para os de alimentos preparados antecipadamente ou pré-preparados e finalizados no ponto de venda, do que os de industrializados. A partir deste estudo, verificou-se que o comércio de alimentos de rua representa para muitos vendedores sua única fonte de renda e, que a maioria dos pontos de venda é operada por apenas um vendedor, que não movimenta a economia. Por meio dos vendedores, as pessoas que transitam pelo centro da cidade e os comerciantes têm disponíveis alimentos prontos e regionais, como o pinhão. Embora uma exigência legal, verificou-se que quase metade dos vendedores nunca havia feito o curso para manipulação de alimentos e 28 % não tinham o atestado de saúde. Entre as práticas de higiene inadequadas observadas neste estudo destacam-se: manuseio de dinheiro e alimento sem higienizar as mãos; fumar durante o preparo dos alimentos; proteção parcial dos cabelos e uso de adornos. Constata-se a necessidade de repensar os treinamentos ofertados, a fim de que sejam efetivos para que os vendedores cumpram as normas básicas de higiene. Aos órgãos competentes cabe verificar a razão pela qual as exigências dispostas na lei não estão sendo cumpridas e o vendedor continua tendo seu alvará de licença renovado. Ainda, tornar mais eficientes as maneiras de verificar as razões pelas quais tais exigências e as boas práticas de higiene não estão sendo seguidas. Por fim, formular normas específicas para a venda de alimentos de rua e proporcionar infraestrutura básica e adequada ao vendedor. The informal {{trade of}} street food {{plays an important}} role in many countries, especially as a source of employment and of convenient and affordable food for people. On the other hand, it has aspects that may compromise food safety. Despite the importance of street food, there are few studies in most Brazilian cities, including Florianópolis, where this research was conducted. The aim of this study was to characterize the street food vendor profile and the food marketed in the central region of the city of Florianópolis-SC. An exploratory, descriptive, qualitative and quantitative study was held with all street food vendors registered with the local government, which operated in stationary points of sale. Information regarding general and sociodemographic characteristics, as well as good manipulation practices of the stationary vendors was collected through a pre-tested and well structured interview questionnaire, between November and December 2011. Among the 50 participants of the study, 60 % were male; most were married and aged between 49 and 50 years. Their level of education was predominantly low and their average monthly income was between one and two minimum wages. The data collected about labour activity showed that the semi-permanent stationary vending stalls were mostly operated by a single seller and that 90 % of them had no other source of income. The interest and the difficulty in finding another job were the main reasons that led vendors to work on this activity. Among the sellers, 46 % had not received training in food handling and 72 % had a health certificate. In relation to hygienic handling of street-vended foods, it was observed that 86 % of the sellers wore a uniform or overall, changed daily and kept clean. More than half of the sellers partially covered their hair with a <b>hair</b> <b>cap</b> and approximately ¾ wore jewelry. Among the 15 sellers who were smokers, 20 % informed smoking during food preparation. It was observed that almost all sellers handled money and food without cleaning their hands. Based on information about the type of food marketed, it was found that 30 % of the participants sold prepared popcorn at the point of sale; 28 % sold industrialized snacks and sweets and 20 %, hot dog and barbecue; 22 % sold food previously prepared or pre-prepared and finalized on the point of sale. The percentage of sellers that had taken the food handling course was higher for sellers of previously prepared or finalized food on the point of sale (cocada, pamonha, bonbon and churros), than those of industrialized snacks and sweets. From this study, it would appear that the street food trade represents, for many sellers, a source of employment and the only source of income. It was also observed that most of the points of sale were operated by only one seller that does not move the economy. Through the work of these street food vendors, people going through the city center, as well as traders, have available local and ready-to-eat foods, like the pine nut. Although a legal obligation, it was observed that almost half of the sellers had never had course of food handling and 28 % had no health certificate. Among the inadequate hygienic practices observed in this study the following outstand: the handling of money and food without cleaning hands, smoking during food preparation, partial protection of the hair and use of jewelry. There is a need to rethink the trainings offered in order to be more effective and have the sellers following the basic rules of hygiene. With regards to regulatory organizations, it is their responsibility to verify why obligations existing in the law are not being followed and sellers continue to have permits renewed. Nevertheless, it is necessary to find more efficient ways to verify the reasons why these obligations and good handling practices are not being followed. Finally, it is necessary to formulate specific rules for the street food segment and provide some basic and adequate infrastructure to vendor...|$|E

40|$|Authors: Bevin Gangadharan & Nicole Zitzmann ### Abstract Two-dimensional gel {{electrophoresis}} (2 -DE) is a protein separation technique {{often used to}} separate plasma or serum proteins {{in an attempt to}} identify novel biomarkers. This protocol describes how to run 2 -DE gels using narrow pH 3 - 5. 6 immobilised pH gradient strips to separate 2 mg of serum proteins. pH 3 - 6 ampholytes are used to enhance the solubility of proteins in this pH range before the serum proteins are separated in the first dimension by isoelectric point (isoelectric focusing) followed by molecular weight (SDS-PAGE). This approach using the pH 3 - 5. 6 range differs from pH ranges more commonly used for serum or plasma biomarker discovery which span three or more pH units (e. g. pH 3 - 10 and 4 - 7), and has the advantage that the pH range lies outside the range of three highly abundant proteins and therefore improves separation and representation of low abundance features. The protocol described takes approximately 8 days. ![Fig 1]([URL] "Fig 1 ") ### Introduction There is much interest in discovering biomarkers to assess the pathological states of disease, and blood is the most common sample taken from patients to determine disease severity. (1) In hospital laboratories, plasma or serum is obtained from these blood samples and the levels of the biomarkers are determined using automated immunoanalysers or mass spectrometry. However, for many diseases there are no reliable serum/plasma biomarkers available and as a result occasionally invasive approaches such as biopsies are necessary. Not all biomarkers currently used for clinical diagnoses are reliable (e. g. they may show large variation in marker levels between different individuals with the same pathological state). There is an urgent need for reliable and novel biomarkers for many diseases in order to aid both patients and clinicians for diagnosis as well as for monitoring disease and therapeutic regimens. Two-dimensional {{gel electrophoresis}} (2 -DE) separates proteins and is often used to search for novel biomarkers in serum or plasma. This technique separates proteins in the first dimension by isoelectric point (isoelectric focusing) followed by molecular weight (SDS-PAGE). Commonly used pH ranges for isoelectric focusing are pH 3 - 10 and pH 4 - 7 which have been used by us and others to successfully discover novel disease biomarkers. (2, 3) However, plasma and serum contain high abundant proteins in these pH ranges. These high abundant proteins restrict the amount of protein that can be loaded onto 2 -DE gels and therefore decreases the chances of identifying low abundance proteins which potentially could serve as biomarkers. In the protocol described here we use 2 -DE over a narrow pH 3 - 5. 6 range since this lies outside the range of the highly abundant proteins albumin, transferrin and immunoglobulins. The lack of highly abundant proteins in this pH range allows four times more serum or plasma to be loaded compared to a 2 -DE gel using a wide pH 3 - 10 range. Here we present {{for the first time the}} detailed protocol for using pH 3 - 5. 6 immobilised pH gradient strips to separate serum and plasma by 2 -DE gels. (4, 5) Protocol development included analysis of various narrow pH ranges for 2 -DE and their comparison to the more commonly used wide pH range. The use of a narrow pH 3 - 5. 6 range led to an improved separation and visualisation of low abundance proteins. In Gangadharan et al. (4) for example, we demonstrate that using the pH 3 − 5. 6 range with a load of 2 mg 262 additional protein features were detected compared to a pH 3 − 10 gel across the same pH 3 − 5. 6 range. These extra features are potentially new disease biomarkers which are missed when using 2 -DE gels with a wide pH range. This novel approach described here not only helps in identifying new biomarkers in serum/plasma but would also be of great benefit in the separation and analysis of other samples where high abundant proteins like albumin may pose a problem such as cerebrospinal fluid or urine. A work flow diagram to show how the experimental steps fit together and examples of equipment which can be used is shown in Fig. 1. This work flow could also be adapted for use in 2 -D Fluorescence Difference Gel Electrophoresis (2 -D DIGE). ### Reagents 1. Blood collection tubes such as P 100, plasma or serum tubes (BD). - Bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay kit, 3 -([3 -Cholamidopropyl]dimethylammonio) - 1 -propanesulphonate (CHAPS), tributyl phosphine, iodoacetamide, pooled human serum (Sigma). - pH 3 - 6 SERVALYT® carrier ampholytes (SERVA). - Urea, dithiothreitol (DTT), γ-methacryloxy-propyl-trimethoxysilane (Bind-Silane), Repel-Silane ES, dry strip cover mineral oil, Immobiline pH 3 - 5. 6 NL IPG DryStrips (18 cm, 3 mm wide), electrode wicks (GE Healthcare). - Sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), bromophenol blue, ammonium bicarbonate (NH 4 HCO 3) (Fluka). - HPLC grade water, absolute ethanol, hydrochloric acid (HCl), glycine (BDH). - 2 -Amino- 2 -(hydroxymethyl) - 1, 3 -propanediol (Tris), agarose, sequencing grade bovine trypsin (Roche). - Thiourea, glycerol (Fisher Scientific). - Dimethylbenzylammonium propane sulphonate: non-detergent sulphobetaine- 256 – NDSB- 256 (Calbiochem). - Acetic acid, acetonitrile (Riedel-de Haën). - SYPRO Ruby (Invitrogen). - 96 well reaction plate (Intavis). - 96 well collection plate – non-skirted 200 μl PCR plate (ABgene). **REAGENT SETUP** 1. Rehydration sample buffer (5 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4 % (w/v) CHAPS, 65 mM DTT, 2 mM tributyl phosphine, 150 mM NDSB- 256, and 0. 0012 % (w/v) bromophenol blue). - Equilibration solution (4 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 50 mM Tris HCl (pH 6. 8), 30 % (v/v) glycerol, 2 % (w/v) SDS, 130 mM DTT, 0. 002 % (w/v) bromophenol blue). - Laemmli reservoir buffer (25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 0. 1 % (w/v) SDS). ### Equipment 1. Reswelling tray, Multiphor II, EPS 3500 XL power supply, DALT gradient maker, Hoefer DALT running tank (GE Healthcare) - LAS 1000 Pro Intelligent Dark Box II CCD camera (Fuji). - Melanie image analysis software (Genebio). - Robotic gel excisor – GCM instrument (Horizon Instruments). - Dark Reader light box (Clare Chemical Research). - Savant SpeedVac and vacuum vaporiser (Thermo Electron). - Automated DigestPro workstation (ABiMED). ### Procedure To avoid keratin contamination of samples it is recommended, although not essential, that all steps below are carried out in clean room conditions using a <b>hair</b> <b>cap</b> bouffant, face mask / beard cover, extended cuff gloves and a non-shedding labcoat. - **Sample preparation** 1. Collect blood from patients using P 100 tubes according to the manufacturer’s recommendation or in other serum/plasma tubes as previously described for proteomics. (6, 7) - PAUSE POINT Serum / plasma samples can be stored at – 80 °C until required. - Determine the total protein concentration of the sample using a protein assay such as BCA protein assay according to the manufacturer’s recommendation. - Mix 2. 4 mg of serum / plasma protein with rehydration sample buffer up to a total volume of 442 μl. - CRITICAL STEP Never heat the samples after adding urea. Elevated temperatures can result in urea hydrolysing to isocyanate. This can cause protein modification by carbamylation leading to artifactual trains of protein features on 2 -DE gels. - ! CAUTION Tributyl phosphine in the rehydration sample buffer is spontaneously inflammable in air. - Add 8 μl of pH 3 - 6 carrier ampholytes (final ampholyte concentration = 1. 8 %) and vortex mix for 2 minutes. Leave the samples at room temperature for 30 minutes to ensure complete denaturation and solubilisation. Spin samples at 16, 000 g for 15 min. - Pipette 375 μl of supernatant (containing 2 mg serum/plasma) into separate lanes of a reswelling tray. Place Immobiline pH 3 - 5. 6 NL IPG DryStrips face down onto the protein-containing samples in each lane of the reswelling tray and overlay with 2 ml of dry strip cover mineral oil. Leave to rehydrate for at least 16 h at room temperature. - CRITICAL STEP To ensure successful rehydration, the gel should be swollen to 1 mm thick and the bromophenol blue dye should be stained across the full length of the strip. - **Isoelectric focusing (IEF) ** - Drain off excess mineral oil and transfer to the sample tray of Multiphor II apparatus with the gel facing upwards. - For each IPG DryStrip, cut two electrode wicks 2 cm in length. Soak electrode wicks with 100 μl HPLC grade water and blot with a cleanwipe to ensure that the wicks are damp but not excessively wet. Place damp wicks on either end of the IPG strips and fix electrode bars onto the wicks at either end of the IPG strips. Pour mineral oil into the Multiphor sample tray until the strips are immersed. Prod wicks gently using tweezers to remove air bubbles and ensure good contact with the IPG gel. - Carry out IEF at 300 V for 2 h, a gradient increase to 3500 V over 3 h and then maintain at 3500 V up to 70 kVh using an EPS 3500 XL power supply. For all stages, set the current limit to 10 mA for 12 gels, and the power limit to 5 W. Maintain the temperature of the Multiphor at 17 °C using a recycling thermostatic water bath. - PAUSE POINT Strips can be snap frozen on dry ice and then stored at – 80 °C until required. - **Two dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2 D-PAGE) ** - Gels can be poured using a gradient gel casting machine such as the DALT Gradient maker connected to a peristaltic pump. Pour gels according to the manufacturer’s recommendation. Precast gels can also be used such as the ExcelGel system (GE Healthcare). Gels can be either of fixed percentage such as 12 % or of a gradient such as 9 - 16 % the latter of which gives better separation for serum / plasma. Gels must be able to accommodate 18 cm IPG strips. - Optional step: If pouring gels, the plates can be treated so that the gel covalently binds to one of the glass plates in the gel cassette. This makes it easier to manipulate the gels for fixing, staining, scanning, storage and cutting. One plate needs to be treated with Bind-Silane and the other with Repel-Silane ES according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. - Immediately post IEF, incubate the IPG strips in 2 ml of reducing equilibration solution for 15 min at room temperature. Drain strips of equilibration solution. Overlay the strips onto the second dimension gels and seal in place with 90 °C, 0. 5 % (w/v) agarose in Laemmli reservoir buffer. Use the flat end of a spatula to aid placement of the IPG strip. - Perform second dimension electrophoresis with Laemmli reservoir buffer using a Hoefer DALT running tank or any other equivalent electrophoresis running tank capable of running large 18 cm by 18 cm gels. Set the current to 20 mA per gel for 1 h, followed by 40 mA per gel for approximately 4 h. Set the power limit to 150 W for a tank containing 6 gels and the voltage limit to 600 V throughout the run. Maintain the temperature at 10 °C using a recycling thermostatic water bath. Terminate electrophoresis once the bromophenol blue tracking dye has reached the bottom of the gel. - Remove gels from the running tank and open the glass plates. Discard the IPG strip and the overlay agarose. Wash gels briefly in ultrapure water to remove running buffer and then place into a staining tank such as the Dodeca stainer (BioRad) or equivalent. Fix the proteins on the gels in 40 % (v/v) ethanol, 10 % (v/v) acetic acid overnight. - Gels can then be stained. For highest sensitivity and greatest compatibility by mass spectrometry, fluorescent stains such as SYPRO Ruby are recommended. 8 Perform staining according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. - Image gels using a scanner/camera appropriate for the stain used. Scanners/cameras are available capable of imaging multiple stains such as the Fuji LAS 1000 Pro CCD camera which can image either fluorescent, silver or Coomassie stained gels. In the case of SYPRO Ruby stained gels, set the parameters to fluorescence and cool the CCD camera to - 25 °C prior to capturing images. Place the gel onto the imaging tray and acquire images over different exposure times (typically between 0. 5 to 2 min) until the optimum image has been produced. - Place scanned gels in a plastic bag with approximately 10 ml of 40 % (v/v) ethanol, 10 % (v/v) acetic acid and seal the bag with a bag sealer. Store at 4 °C until required for excising protein spots. - **Differential image analysis and spot excision** - Perform differential image analysis of the gels. This can be carried out using various commerically available software such as the Medical ELectrophoresis ANalysis Interactive Expert (Melanie) software. Perform differential image analysis according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. An optional step is to calibrate all gels internally for pI and molecular weight using the E. coli proteome as a standard (9), typically using 10 - 15 calibrated landmarks on each gel. Landmarks allow the software to warp the gels so that they can be superimposed onto each other to aid with image analysis. All features displayed as differentially expressed by the software must be validated further by visualising the features across all gels in a montage format. - Differentially expressed features can be excised from the gel manually using a clean scalpel or using any software-driven robot. To aid manual excision gels can be visualised in a dark room using either a white light box (for silver or Coomassie stained gels) or a Dark Reader light box (for fluorescent stained gels). For excision of features using a robotic gel excisor (such as a GCM instrument), the co-ordinates of each differentially expressed protein feature is sent to the robot as a list of commands which will programme x and y movements of the robot arms and direct the cutting head to cut and remove features. To avoid contamination between spots, use a new cutter tip on the cutting head for each gel feature. The robot excises gel features by shearing and aspirating actions. Eject the cutter tips with the isolated gel pieces into separate wells of a 96 well reaction plate with laser made holes on the bottom. - **In-gel trypsin digestion** - In-gel trypsin digestion can then be performed either manually (see Supporting Information) or using an automated workstation such as the DigestPro as described below (all steps at room temperature unless stated otherwise). The DigestPro workstation adds solutions to the 96 well plate containing the gel pieces using needles and removes liquid through laser made holes on the bottom of the plate by applying nitrogen pressure as previously described. (10) Prepare 18 ng/μl bovine trypsin and place inside the automated robot in its inactive form by storing in acidic conditions (10 % (v/v) acetonitrile, 1 mM HCl). - Wash gels with 50 μl acetonitrile and 50 μl 50 mM NH 4 HCO 3 for 15 min. Remove supernatant. Dehydrate gels with 100 μl acetonitrile for 10 min. Remove acetonitrile. - Reduce proteins in the gel with 30 μl 10 mM DTT in 25 mM NH 4 HCO 3 for 10 min at 60 °C. Remove supernatant once the samples have cooled (20 min). - Alkylate gel proteins with 30 μl 50 mM iodoacetamide in 25 mM NH 4 HCO 3 for 15 min. Remove iodoacetamide solution. - Wash gel pieces with 50 μl 50 mM NH 4 HCO 3 for 15 min. Remove 50 mM NH 4 HCO 3. Dehydrate gels twice with 50 μl acetonitrile for 15 min. Remove acetonitrile. Pause workstation for 10 min to allow drying. - Activate trypsin by diluting it 2 -fold with 25 mM NH 4 HCO 3. Add 15 μl of this 9 ng/ml trypsin solution to each gel piece and leave for 10 min to allow gel swelling. Incubate gel pieces at 37 °C for 2 h. Add 10 μl water to compensate for any water loss. Incubate gel pieces at 37 °C for a further 2 h. - Add 10 μl 25 mM NH 4 HCO 3 to each gel piece and incubate for 10 min. Add 20 μl acetonitrile and leave for 10 min to dehydrate the gel. Transfer the supernatant to a 96 well collection plate. - Add 20 μl 10 % (v/v) formic acid to the gels and leave for 10 min to extract the peptides. Add supernatant to the collection plate. Dehydrate gels with 30 μl acetonitrile for 15 min.

5|$|The climax {{takes place}} at the beauty pageant. After a frantic race against the clock the family arrives at the hotel, and are curtly told by a pageant {{organizer}} that they are a couple minutes past the deadline. A sympathetic hired hand instead offers to register Olive on his own time. As Olive prepares for the pageant, the family sees Olive's competition: slim, hypersexualized pre-teen girls with teased <b>hair</b> and <b>capped</b> teeth. They wear lip gloss, adult-like swimsuits, and glamorous evening wear while performing highly elaborate dance numbers with great panache. It quickly becomes apparent that Olive (plain, chubby, wearing large eyeglasses, and untrained in beauty pageant conventions) is a mere amateur by comparison.|$|R
50|$|Masking {{feminine}} features includes {{dealing with}} hairstyle.

25|$|On 21 October 1960, Francisco Morazan began {{what was}} to be her last voyage from Miami, Florida. She sailed to Montreal and Toronto, where she {{unloaded}} a cargo of phosphates. Francisco Morazan then sailed to Chicago, arriving there in mid-November. At Chicago, 1,118 tons, 10 cwt of mixed cargo was loaded, destined for Rotterdam, Netherlands and Hamburg, Germany. The cargo included aluminium, baled <b>hair,</b> bottle <b>caps,</b> canned chicken, castings, chemicals, Gilsonite, hides, lard, machinery, phosphate, scrap metal, solder dross, tinplate, and toys. Francisco Morazan departed Chicago on 28 November. Fog on Lake Michigan slowed her progress and a problem with the feed pump for the boiler required the ship to be stopped while the pump was repaired. This meant Francisco Morazan was now in a race to leave the Great Lakes before the system closed to navigation on 3 December.|$|R
50|$|The {{woman can}} be {{identified}} as Mary Magdalen from the jar of oil held in her hand; her traditional attribute in 15th and 16th century northern European art. The jar, depicted in fine detail, seems to be made from a precious blue stone, delicately carved and mounted in gold. The Magdalen is shown with very elegant and beautiful facial features, brown eyes and shallow pale skin, and is dressed in finely embroidered clothes. She wears a white patterned cap over her strawberry-blond <b>hair.</b> The <b>cap</b> is covered by two white veils; one semi-transparent, the other opaque white. Infra-red photography reveals a number of preparatory underdrawings. Samples of the pigments show that three different purples were used; formed from mixtures of lead white, azurite and red lake, however most passages of purple have either faded or been overpainted by restorers.|$|R
60|$|And then to find Miss Pinnegar! In her way, Miss Pinnegar {{was very}} {{different}} from Miss Frost. She was a rather short, stout, mouse-coloured, creepy kind of woman with a high colour in her cheeks, and dun, close <b>hair</b> like a <b>cap.</b> It was evident she was not a lady: her grammar was not without reproach. She had pale grey eyes, and a padding step, and a soft voice, and almost purplish cheeks. Mrs. Houghton, Miss Frost, and Alvina did not like her. They suffered her unwillingly.|$|R
5000|$|Rittenhouse was {{dissatisfied}} with Eckfeldt's designs, {{and with the}} criticism of the Chain cents fresh in his mind, he hired Joseph Wright to do yet another redesign in the denomination's troubled first year. Wright's design faced Liberty {{to the right and}} [...] "tamed" [...] her wild <b>hair.</b> The Phrygian <b>cap</b> was added as an ancient symbol of freedom. The reverse design was revised to a recognizable laurel wreath, and future Chief Engraver Robert Scot had a hand in several minor revisions to the design over the next three years.|$|R

She exhibited it to the little ones ten times a day, she kissed it night and morning, and registered her vow always to sleep with it under her [...] "pilow," [...] in a letter of thanks, which Margaret defended and despatched, in spite of Miss Winter's horrors at its disregard of orthography.|$|R
50|$|Netting is a {{technique}} which involves braiding natural tresses under a thin, breathable net {{that serves as a}} flat surface onto which stylists can weave extensions. This method requires the use of <b>hair</b> net or <b>cap</b> to be placed over the person's hair that has been braided. Netting provides more flexibility than track placement because the stylist is not limited to sewing extensions to a braid. With netting there is the option of sewing the hair wefts onto the net or gluing. This technique is not as time-consuming when compared to the other hair techniques because it takes about 2-4 hours to complete.|$|R
50|$|Banbibi is worshipped by her Hindu {{followers}} as Bandurga, Bandevi or as Banbibi, and her predominantly Hindu {{images are}} found as wearing a crown and garland, carrying a club and trishul and her vahana (vehicle) is a tiger.

She wears ghagra and pyjama (instead of a sari) and a pair of shoes. Both Hindu and Muslim images have a boy in her lap, believed as Dukhe by her worshippers. Her vahana (mount) is a tiger or a hen.|$|R

Surprise and satisfaction were both for an instant to be read upon his eager face, though when she glanced round to find out the cause of his silence he had become as demure as ever. I stared hard myself at her flat, grizzled <b>hair,</b> her trim <b>cap,</b> her little gilt earrings, her placid features; but I could see nothing which could account for my companion's evident excitement.|$|R
50|$|Kiko is a calm, laid-back Afro-Brazilian boy. He is {{the only}} Ranger not worried about dating, and likes reggae and rap. His words always {{come in the form}} of ghetto slangs, and he is always the most cheerful and optimistic, despite the bad {{situations}} he and the Rangers get involved with. Kiko has become Ultramano once (see details below). His design is the one which changes the most throughout the series: he initially shaved his <b>hair</b> (wearing a <b>cap</b> turned backwards), then in Combo Rangers Zero he dyed his hair blond (much like pagode musicians usually did at the time), and from Revolution onwards he started wearing glasses and using dreadlocks as a hairstyle.|$|R
5000|$|Between 27 BC and 102 AD, in Imperial Rome, women wore {{their hair}} in {{complicated}} styles: {{a mass of}} curls on top, or in rows of waves, drawn back into ringlets or braids. Eventually noblewomen's hairstyles grew so complex that they required daily attention from several slaves and a stylist {{in order to be}} maintained. The hair was often lightened using wood ash, unslaked lime and sodium bicarbonate, or darkened with copper filings, oak-apples or leeches marinated in wine and vinegar. [...] It was augmented by wigs, hairpieces and pads, and held in place by nets, pins, combs and pomade. Under the Byzantine Empire, noblewomen covered most of their <b>hair</b> with silk <b>caps</b> and pearl nets.|$|R
5000|$|The {{standard}} {{uniform of}} the British army consisted of the traditional red coat with cocked hats, white breeches and black gaiters with leather knee <b>caps.</b> <b>Hair</b> was usually cut short or fixed in plaits {{at the top of}} the head. As the war progressed many line regiments replaced their cocked hats with slouch hats. The full [...] "marching order" [...] a line infantryman was expected to carry on campaign was extensive, and British soldiers often dropped much of their equipment before battle. Soldiers were also issued with greatcoats to be worn in adverse conditions, which were often used as tents or blankets. Drummers usually wore colours in reverse of their regimental colour, they carried the coat of arms of their colonel and wore mitre caps. Most German regiments wore dark blue coats, while cavalry and loyalists often wore green.|$|R
