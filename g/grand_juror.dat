25|$|In 1964, Hoffa {{was convicted}} in Chattanooga, Tennessee, of {{attempted}} bribery of a <b>grand</b> <b>juror,</b> {{and was sentenced to}} eight years. This case resulted from an earlier matter, the Test Fleet case, the trial for which had been held in Nashville, Tennessee. Hoffa was implicated by one of his close associates, Edward Grady Partin, a Louisiana teamster, who went to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) with the information that led to Hoffa's conviction. Hoffa was also convicted of fraud later that same year for improper use of the Teamsters' pension fund, in a trial held in Chicago. Hoffa had illegally arranged several large pension fund loans to leading organized crime figures. He received a five-year sentence to run consecutively to his bribery sentence. Robert F. Kennedy, who had pursued Hoffa for several years, since the McClellan-led U.S. Senate Labor industry hearings of 1957, stepped down as Attorney General in 1964, after the second Hoffa conviction, to run successfully for the New York seat in the November 1964 United States Senate election.|$|E
500|$|The defense made pre-trial motions {{arguing that}} the defendants' right to trial by a jury of their peers had been denied because, at that time, a {{potential}} <b>grand</b> <b>juror</b> had to meet a minimum property requirement, effectively eliminating the less affluent from service.

60|$|I {{have spoken}} {{something}} slightingly of the acquirements and doings of the family; and indeed their acquirements had been few and their doings little. At Allington, Dale of Allington {{had always been}} known as a king. At Guestwick, the neighbouring market town, {{he was a great}} man--to be seen frequently on Saturdays, standing in the market-place, and laying down the law as to barley and oxen among men who knew usually more about barley and oxen than did he. At Hamersham, the assize town, he was generally in some repute, being a constant <b>grand</b> <b>juror</b> for the county, and a man who paid his way. But even at Hamersham the glory of the Dales had, at most periods, begun to pale, for they had seldom been widely conspicuous in the county, and had earned no great reputation by their knowledge of jurisprudence in the grand jury room. Beyond Hamersham their fame had not spread itself.|$|E

60|$|When {{his wife}} had died, {{the nature of the}} man had {{apparently}} been changed. Of all men he had been the most cheerful, the most eager, and the most easily pleased. He had worked hard at his property, and had loved his work. He knew every man and woman about the place, and always had a word to say to them. He had had a sailing boat on the lake, in which he had spent much of his time, but {{his wife had}} always been with him. Since her death he had hardly put his foot within the boat. He had lately become quick and short-tempered, but always with a visible attempt to be kind to those around him. But people said of him that since his wife had died he had shown an indifference to the affairs of the world. He was anxious--so it was said--to leave matters as much as possible to his son; but, as has been already stated, his son was only twenty-two. He had formerly taken a great pleasure in attending the assizes at Galway. He had been named as a <b>grand</b> <b>juror</b> for the county, which he had indeed regarded as a great compliment; but since his wife's death he had not once attended.|$|E
60|$|The {{long days}} and early sun of July {{allowed time for}} a {{gathering}} of the interested, before the little bell of the academy announced that the appointed hour had arrived for administering right to the wronged, and punishment to the guilty. Ever {{since the dawn of}} day, the highways and woodpaths that, issuing from the forests, and winding among the sides of the mountains, centred in Templeton, had been thronged with equestrians and footmen, bound to the haven of justice. There was to be seen a well-clad yeoman, mounted on a sleek, switch- tailed steed, rambling along the highway, with his red face elevated in a manner that said, “I have paid for my land, and fear no man;” while his bosom was swelling with the pride of being one of the grand inquest for the county. At his side rode a companion, his equal in independence of feeling, perhaps, but his inferior in thrift, as in property and consideration. This was a professed dealer in lawsuits—a man whose name appeared in every calendar—whose substance, gained in the multifarious expedients of a settler’s change able habits, was wasted in feeding the harpies of the courts. He was endeavoring to impress the mind of the <b>grand</b> <b>juror</b> with the merits of a cause now at issue, Along with these was a pedestrian, who, having thrown a rifle frock over his shirt, and placed his best wool hat above his sunburnt visage, had issued from his retreat in the woods by a footpath, and was striving to keep company with the others, on his way to hear and to decide the disputes of his neighbors, as a petit juror. Fifty similar little knots of countrymen might have been seen, on that morning, journeying toward the shire-town on the same errand.|$|E

50|$|The {{rules are}} very similar to the federal process; the grand jury usually only hears from law {{enforcement}} personnel, with the exception of property crimes, where store detectives or actual victims of theft or vandalism are called to testify. The only cases brought to the grand jury are those initiated from the Commonwealth's Attorney's office (the prosecutor for felonies). For the vast majority of cases, the <b>grand</b> <b>jurors</b> generally only hear a recitation of facts from the police report, crime laboratory & medical examiner reports, and other documentation generated during the evidence gathering process. <b>Grand</b> <b>jurors</b> can ask factual questions of the witnesses and legal questions of the Commonwealth's Attorney or Assistant Commonwealth's Attorney. The ability to broaden or narrow indictments does technically allow for grand juries to open new avenues of investigation, although since it is dependent on prosecutors for facts, this is very rarely done. Rules of confidentiality that apply to Kentucky <b>grand</b> <b>jurors</b> are similar to those that apply to federal grand juries.|$|R

50|$|In Ireland, {{grand juries}} were active from the Middle Ages during the Lordship of Ireland {{in parts of}} the island {{under the control of the}} English {{government}} (The Pale), that was followed by the Kingdom of Ireland. They mainly functioned as local government authorities at the county level. The system was so-called as the <b>grand</b> <b>jurors</b> had to present their public works proposals and budgets in court for official sanction by a judge. <b>Grand</b> <b>jurors</b> were usually the largest local payers of rates, and therefore tended to be the larger landlords, and on retiring they selected new members from the same background.|$|R

50|$|The California Federal Grand Jury has two {{sections}} - the Accusatory and the Investigatory. Accusatory Grand Juries hear shorter less complicated criminal cases and often hear several cases {{each day in}} attendance. Accusatory Grand Juries are impaneled for four to six months. Accusatory <b>grand</b> <b>jurors</b> meet one day each week, always {{on the same day}} of the week. Each day met, the number of cases varies and jurors are expected to be available from 9:00 a.m. until 4:30 p.m. for these cases. Often accusatory jurors have a shortened day, but this is never predictable. A typical Accusatory <b>Grand</b> <b>Juror's</b> day begins at 9:00 a.m. A Federal Attorney, the prosecutor, presents an indictment {{to the members of the}} jury. Then he brings in a witness, usually a Federal agent involved with the case, and questions him. When there are no more questions, the attorney, court reporter, and witness exit the room and the jurors are asked to deliberate the case. <b>Grand</b> <b>jurors</b> do not choose guilt but only decide if the case has probable cause to go to trial.|$|R

40|$|Unlike the {{generally}} random {{process that is}} common in petit juries, grand juries have been selected by means guaranteed to produce partiality with juries being drawn {{from those who are}} part of or propertied in the criminal justice system. Recognizing the potential problems associated with a key-man approach to jury selection, we examine the process used in Harris County, Texas to select <b>grand</b> <b>jurors</b> and we attempt to identify both the types of individuals who select the <b>grand</b> <b>jurors</b> and the types of individuals chosen as jurors, specifically looking at Hispanic surnamed <b>grand</b> <b>jurors.</b> Choosing Justice 1 For over two hundred years the United States has had a grand jury system in place serving as both a “sword ” to vanquish the guilty and a “shield ” to protect the innocent from the vagrancies of the government (Leipold 1995, p. 182). The grand jury was considered so important by the nation’s founding fathers that the Bill of Rights included an amendment guaranteeing the right of an indictment by a grand jury for all infamous or capital crimes yet its use was so accepted by the colonists that it wasn’t even considered an issue to be defended when the Federalist Papers were published in support of th...|$|R

The meetings are twice a month in most counties (however, grand juries in more populous counties such as Jefferson (Louisville) and Fayette (Lexington) generally meet more often), with each meeting usually going through 20-30 cases in a four- to five-hour period. The indictment rate is about 98-99%; the grand jury can broaden (about 1% of the time) or narrow (about 3% of the time) the counts in the indictment as well. Usually, fifteen to twenty [...] <b>grand</b> <b>jurors</b> are required to report to meetings; {{the hope is that}} twelve will show to each meeting, which is the number of jurors required to hear cases (an additional juror may be kept as an alternate while other extra jurors are typically excused for the day). It takes nine yes votes to the question of probable cause to sign a true bill of indictment. Fewer than nine yes votes either causes a no true bill or a narrowing of the indictment (depending on the votes per count).|$|R
