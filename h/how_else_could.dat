25|$|Imagine {{a pair of}} {{particles}} that can be measured at distant locations. Suppose that the measurement devices have settings, which are angles—e.g., the devices measure something called spin in some direction. The experimenter chooses the directions, one for each particle, separately. Suppose the measurement outcome is binary (e.g., spin up, spin down). Suppose the two particles are perfectly anti-correlated—in the sense that whenever both measured in the same direction, one gets identically opposite outcomes, when both measured in opposite directions they always give the same outcome. The only way to imagine how this works is that both particles leave their common source with, somehow, the outcomes they will deliver when measured in any possible direction. (<b>How</b> <b>else</b> <b>could</b> particle 1 know how to deliver the same answer as particle 2 when measured in the same direction? They don't know in advance how {{they are going to}} be measured...). The measurement on particle 2 (after switching its sign) can be thought of as telling us what the same measurement on particle 1 would have given.|$|E

2500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times {{gave the}} film 4 out of 4 stars, stating that it is, [...] "a breathless, {{exciting}} story, heartbreaking and exhilarating." [...] Wall Street Journal critic Joe Morgenstern refers to Slumdog Millionaire as, [...] "the film world's first globalised masterpiece." [...] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post argues that, [...] "this modern-day 'rags-to-rajah' fable won the audience award at the Toronto International Film Festival earlier this year, and it's {{easy to see}} why. With its timely setting of a swiftly globalising India and, more specifically, the country's {{own version of the}} 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire' TV show, combined with timeless melodrama and a hardworking orphan who withstands all manner of setbacks, 'Slumdog Millionaire' plays like Charles Dickens for the 21stcentury." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times describes the film as [...] "a Hollywood-style romantic melodrama that delivers major studio satisfactions in an ultra-modern way" [...] and [...] "a story of star-crossed romance that the original Warner brothers would have embraced, shamelessly pulling out stops that you wouldn't think anyone would have the nerve to attempt any more." [...] Anthony Lane of the New Yorker stated, [...] "There is a mismatch here. Boyle and his team, headed by the director of photography, Anthony Dod Mantle, clearly believe that a city like Mumbai, with its shifting skyline and a population of more than fifteen million, is as ripe for storytelling as Dickens's London [...] At the same time, the story they chose is sheer fantasy, not in its glancing details but in its emotional momentum. <b>How</b> <b>else</b> <b>could</b> Boyle get away with assembling his cast for a Bollywood dance number, at a railroad station, over the closing credits? You can either chide the film, at this point, for relinquishing any claim to realism or you can go with the flow—surely the wiser choice." [...] Colm Andrew of the Manx Independent was also full of praise, saying the film [...] "successfully mixes hard-hitting drama with uplifting action and the Who Wants To Be a Millionaire show is an ideal device to revolve events around". Several other reviewers have described Slumdog Millionaire as a Bollywood-style [...] "masala" [...] movie, due to the way the film combines [...] "familiar raw ingredients into a feverish masala" [...] and culminates in [...] "the romantic leads finding each other." ...|$|E

5000|$|The past {{president}} of the Missouri Association for Creation has said: The appearance of age in the things which God created is a much-debated issue in contemporary Christian scientific circles.

The short answer to this question may be: <b>How</b> <b>Else?</b> <b>How,</b> indeed, <b>could</b> God create anything that did not appear to us to be aged (like a fine wine) at the moment of its creation ... Maybe you thought of a visible star—depending on its distance from the earth, its light might appear to have been traveling for over a billion years to reach your eyes. All of these things would have the appearance of age and an ongoing process at the very moment of their creation.|$|R
