To obtain representative sediment samples of each sampling site, sediment samples were taken at 4 to 10 spots within each sampling site and over a sampling distance of 20 to 30  m. After collection, all sediment samples were homogenized with a stainless steel shovel in a stainless steel bucket and divided into batches of 100 or 300  g, wrapped in aluminum foil (Roth, Germany). The 100  g batches were used in the FET with Danio rerio, whereas the 300  g batches were used for chemical analyses. Due to financial shortcomings, chemical analyses with sediment samples were only conducted with samples of sampling event 5.|$|E

There are, however, {{a disproportionate number of}} unsuccessful attempts translocating populations of herpetofauna. Logistical and temporal limits of monitoring, combined with ambiguous metrics concerning 2 ̆ 2 success, 2 ̆ 2 have led to few advances regarding reptile translocations. Successfully established and persistent populations are those in which both the founding population and subsequent generations show consistent or positive levels of survival and reproduction. A small population of the threatened Florida Sand Skink (Plestiodon reynoldsi) was translocated in 2007. Data collected from 2007 to 2009 confirmed survival and reproduction among the founding individuals, but the sampling did not include a long enough period to allow for the evaluation of the survival and reproduction of individuals born on the site. In this study, individuals were collected during two separate <b>sampling</b> <b>events,</b> one during the third spring and one during the sixth spring after the translocation occurred. Survival estimates, reproduction, population size and generation structure were calculated by combining and analyzing data from all years post-translocation.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 28 - 34). Elevated nutrient loads can impair ecological {{functioning in}} receiving water bodies, including those along urbanized coastlines. Riparian corridors provide ecosystems services including retention of anthropogenic nutrient loads and can therefore protect downstream ecosystems, but the retention varies with discharge {{and is not}} well documented in southern California. This study examined longitudinal patterns of stream discharge (Q), nutrient concentrations and nutrient loads in Escondido Creek, which discharges to an ecologically sensitive coastal wetland in Southern California. The upper portion of the watershed is urbanized, the middle subwatershed is undeveloped, and the lower subwatershed has lowdensity residential land use. Q and concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (N) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) were measured at six sample locations on 9 different sampling dates covering a range of Q. A mass balance was calculated from observed data to measure the fraction of nutrient retention or release (R) in five reaches of Escondido Creek downstream from the highly urbanized reach. Stream discharge decreased with distance downstream from the most upstream site to the most downstream site during this investigation, indicating significant channel infiltration and loss to evapotranspiration. Nitrate concentrations and loads decreased with distance from the urban reach for <b>every</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>event,</b> including those with high discharge. By contrast, SRP concentrations increased with distance downstream, but load decreased because Q decreased. Overall, 80 %, 90 %, and 50 % of the water, nitrate, and ammonium discharged from the urban upper watershed were retained in the mid and lower subwatershed, and 40 % orthophosphate {{was added to the}} mid lower subwatershed. Overall retention in the mid- and lower subwatershed increased with discharge. Retention increased with the percent of the subwatershed undeveloped, except for the least developed watershed, which showed downstream increases in load due mainly to increases in discharge. Retention rates for nitrogen were high compared with other streams of comparable size, suggesting that riparian systems downstream of urban areas may play a large role in protecting coastal ecosystems from high nitrogen loads in southern California...|$|E
40|$|Bacterial source {{tracking}} (BST) methods often {{involve the}} use of phenotypic or genotypic fingerprinting techniques to compare indicator bacteria such as Escherichia coli isolated from unknown sources against a library of fingerprints from indicator bacteria found in the feces of various known source animals. The predictive capability of a library is {{based in part on}} how well the library isolates reflect the true population diversity of indicator bacteria that can potentially impact a water body. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the behavior of E. coli population structures in the feces of humans, beef cattle and horses across different parameters. Ribotyping and antibiotic resistance analysis were used to 2 ̆ 2 fingerprint 2 ̆ 2, or subtype E. coli isolates. Significantly greater diversity was observed in the E. coli population of horses compared to the human or beef cattle sampled. Subtype sharing between individuals from all host categories was infrequent, therefore the majority of E. coli subtypes were sampled from a single individual. The dominant E. coli populations of nine individuals (three per host source category) were monitored over time, which demonstrated that E. coli subtypes within a host individual vary on a monthly time frame, and an increase in the frequency of subtype sharing was noted between individuals within the same source group over time. The E. coli population of a single human that had just finished antibiotic treatment was studied on a daily basis for one month. The loss of an E. coli subtype with high antibiotic resistance was observed over time, however there was a single dominant E. coli subtype that was present at <b>every</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>event</b> during the entire month. Geographic distinctiveness of E. coli populations was investigated by sampling four herds located in different geographical regions. We observed that E. coli populations are not geographically distinct, but are somewhat individual-specific, as most E. coli isolates had a subtype that was found in a single individual. This study defines factors that should be considered when constructing a successful BST library, and suggests that E. coli may not be the appropriate indicator organism for BST...|$|E

In turn, <b>samples</b> from <b>sampling</b> <b>events</b> 4 and 5 again showed stronger effects. Sediment and surface water samples from the exposure site (downstream of the SSB) taken at <b>sampling</b> <b>events</b> 4 and 5 led to significantly reduced hatching rates, elevated mortality rates, and elevated developmental failure rates (e.g., spinal deformation, yolk sac edema; see Appendix 2, Fig.  5) in exposed embryos, whereas fish embryos exposed to samples from the reference site showed no or only slight effects, similarly to the negative control.

30|$|The {{conducted}} fish embryo tests {{resulted in}} varying embryotoxic effects, {{depending on the}} <b>sampling</b> <b>event</b> and site. In <b>samples</b> from <b>sampling</b> <b>event</b> 1, both <b>sampling</b> sites had distinct negative effects on the survival rate, the hatching rate, and the developmental failure rate of exposed zebrafish embryos. One explanation for these effects might be the loading of the sediments with pollutants like PAHs, PCBs, and PBDEs. Experiments by Cachot et al. [53] and McElroy et al. [54] indicated that PAHs can pass the chorion when fish embryos are exposed to benzo[a]pyrene-spiked sediments. As a consequence, sediments containing large amounts of hydrophobic substances may affect the embryonic development of fish embryos. Additionally, {{it has to be}} mentioned that the FET with native sediment samples characterizes the overall quality of the sample including both micropollutants but also sediment characteristics as, e.g., particle size or its loading with organic compounds that may lead to oxygen depletion. In contrast to the results of <b>sampling</b> <b>event</b> 1, <b>samples</b> from <b>sampling</b> <b>events</b> 2 and 3 only caused weak effects such as developmental delays in some of the exposed larvae. One probable explanation for this variation is the historic and severe flood event that affected central Europe (including the Argen River) in June 2013, prior to <b>sampling</b> <b>events</b> 2 and 3. The prevalent hydraulic forces may have led to a runoff or shift of the sediments and their bound pollutants and, therefore, may have resulted in distinct lower effects in the FET with samples taken at the events 2 and 3.|$|R
