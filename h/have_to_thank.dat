500|$|Relatively {{little is}} known of The Lady's Realms {{publishing}} history, as many records of its publisher, Hutchinson, were destroyed during the London Blitz. The first issue was published in November 1896. Its first editor was William Henry Wilkins, a mildly successful novelist who oversaw the publication's editing from 1896 to 1902. Though inexperienced, Wilkins was acquainted with society, being a friend of such figures as the explorer Richard Francis Burton and his wife Isabel Burton. After Wilkins' death in 1905, The Lady's Realm wrote of how [...] "the general public are little aware how much of [...] early success" [...] was due to him, and that [...] "not a few [...] have since made their names {{in the world of}} letters <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>thank</b> him for placing their foot on the first rung of the ladder". Wilkins' successor as editor is unknown, though Margaret Versteeg and colleagues, who produced an index of the fiction published in The Lady's Realm, detect no changes in editorial judgement in the magazine's tenure after 1902. While the publication mainly featured women writers and feminine topics, all of its editors, most likely, were men.|$|E
500|$|The {{relatively}} short expedition—Bruce {{was back in}} Scotland in May 1893—failed in its main purpose, and gave only limited opportunities for scientific work. No right whales were found, and to cut the expedition's losses a mass slaughter of seals was ordered, to secure skins, oil and blubber. Bruce found this distasteful, especially as {{he was expected to}} share in the killing. The scientific output from the voyage was, in Bruce's words [...] "a miserable show". In a letter to the Royal Geographical Society he wrote: [...] "The general bearing of the master (Captain Fairweather) was far from being favourable to scientific work". Bruce was denied access to charts, so was unable to establish the accurate location of phenomena. He was required to work [...] "in the boats" [...] when he should have been making meteorological and other observations, and no facilities were allowed him for the preparation of specimens, many of which were lost through careless handling by the crew. Nevertheless, his letter to the RGS ends: [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>thank</b> the Society for assisting me in what has been, despite all drawbacks, an instructive and delightful experience." [...] In a further letter to Mill he outlined his wishes to go South again, adding: [...] "the taste I have had has made me ravenous".|$|E
500|$|Jan C. Snow laments {{that the}} phrase was trite and {{indicative}} of the speaker's lack of vocabulary. She wrote that on Saturdays, people could be asked to [...] "have a relaxing day". People with highly variable jobs such as emergency room nurses may appreciate [...] "have a routine day", while mothers of young children may wish to [...] "have a quiet day". Debbie Lundberg wrote in her 2008book Have a Nice Day Is Not Thank You, and No Problem Is Not You're Welcome that service people should say [...] "thank you" [...] instead of [...] "have a nice day". She argued that [...] "thank you" [...] is shorter and is a [...] "recognition of the ability you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>thank</b> someone", which adds more worth to the purchase than something that will occur in the future. Paul V. Marshall, the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Bethlehem, concurred, writing in the Reading Eagle that he prefers [...] "thank you" [...] to [...] "have a nice day" [...] or [...] "have a great day" [...] even though [...] "thank you" [...] has a [...] "host of socially acceptable responses". He stated that when people say [...] "thank you", they admit that they are dependent on others, {{which leads to a}} healthier, safer society.|$|E

2500|$|Escobar (2009) {{was delayed}} because of {{producer}} Oliver Stone's {{involvement with the}} George W. Bush biopic W. (2008). The release date of Escobar remains unconfirmed.. Regarding the film, Stone said: [...] "This is a great project about a fascinating man who took on the system. I think I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>thank</b> Scarface, and maybe even Ari Gold." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pravit {{expressed}} {{disappointment in}} FCCT president Jonathan Head, a BBC journalist, for stating {{the organization was}} [...] "grateful" [...] to the NCPO for permitting the meeting. [...] "I...couldn't help feeling upset {{over the fact that}} the oppressed <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>thank</b> the oppressor," [...] Pravit wrote. [...] "We now live in a society," [...] he lamented, [...] "where those who try to defend democracy are arrested, while those who support military dictatorship are rewarded.... A society where citizens merely obey the law without wondering if the usage of the law is legitimate or not is doomed to docility".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the final}}, An faced Pulyaev, also a past opponent. It {{was the final}} with the most shidos, {{and the only one}} to end with a disqualification. An and Pulyaev were both level with 3 shidos each by the end of five minutes, and it went on to a minute of golden score until Pulyaev was penalised for being passive. An became one of the two world champions for Korea at the championships, the other being middleweight Gwak Dong-han. An said after {{claiming}} the World title, [...] "I am so happy, I really can't believe it. I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>thank</b> my coach and all of the team who have helped me to achieve this. I can't describe how I feel." ...|$|E

2500|$|In January 1965, Demeter {{signed a}} new {{contract}} with the Tigers {{for the amount of}} $30,000. In late January, he joined manager Dressen on an annual press-radio-television tour that went to Toledo and outstate Michigan. Demeter was cited as the Tigers most clutch hitter, but Demeter still wasn't satisfied with his power output. He trained in Oklahoma during the winter, chopping wood and gaining 12 pounds to 202. On February 5 in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Demeter was given the Art Griggs Award given to Oklahomans with the most outstanding performance at the major league level. He remarked, [...] "I would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>thank</b> Mickey Mantle for moving out of the state, Allie Reynolds for retiring and Warren Spahn for just getting old." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{creation}} of the Fundación Rafa Nadal took place in November 2007, and its official presentation was in February 2008, at the Manacor Tennis Club in Mallorca, Spain. The foundation will focus on social work and development aid particularly on childhood and youth. On deciding why to start a foundation, Nadal said [...] "This can {{be the beginning of}} my future, when I retire and have more time, [...] I am doing very well and I owe society, [...] A month-and-a-half ago I was in Chennai, in India. The truth is we live great here....I can contribute something with my image..." [...] Nadal was inspired by the Red Cross benefit match against malaria with Real Madrid goalkeeper Iker Casillas, recalling, [...] "We raised an amount of money that we would never have imagined. I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>thank</b> Iker, my project partner, who went all out for it, [...] That is why {{the time has come to}} set up my own foundation and determine the destination of the money." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1999 Nina Shatskaya {{went to the}} USA {{with a view of}} {{recording}} her Russian romances. [...] "Investors hoped that there would be some kind of a romance revival. They wanted to make a high-budget product involving the leading Russian poets and composers. But producer Maksim Dunayevsky decided to make it a pop record and since I've never been keen on pop music, the project flopped," [...] she later explained. The recorded material was taken back to Russia but remained unreleased. [...] "I was well aware that the material we recorded was primitive and had nothing whatsoever to do with what I'd been dreaming of. I felt like I'd been given one chance and squandered it," [...] she later admitted. She spent in America six months and spoke warmly of her vocal coach Seth Riggs. [...] "When I first came to him, he was jovially dismissive of the Russian vocal school. Having heard me he was impressed and said I had brilliant technique, for which I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>thank</b> Natalya Andrianova," [...] the singer recalled.|$|E

Like the cotton cultivation introduced by Germany into Cilicia, this carpet industry, in the eastern provinces, has been deprived of the hands essential to it by the Armenian deportations." ...|$|R
60|$|MY DEAR JAMES PAYN, - I {{hear from}} Lang {{that you are}} unwell, and {{it reminds me of}} two circumstances: First, that it is a very long time since you had the {{exquisite}} pleasure of hearing from me; and second, that I have been very often unwell myself, and sometimes <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>thank</b> you for a grateful anodyne.|$|R
2500|$|In 1897, Ward {{enrolled}} in the medical school at the University of Pennsylvania. [...] Ward received his M.D. from Penn in 1899. [...] While at Penn, {{he was a member}} of Psi Upsilon and the H.C. Wood Medical Society. [...] As he had done at Michigan, Ward followed in the footsteps of William [...] "Jerry" [...] McCauley. Both were Princeton football players who coached football at Michigan and received their medical degrees at Penn. [...] Ward later wrote, [...] "At Pennsylvania, too, 'Jerry' McCauley had been my forerunner, and he it was who took me around to see Dr. Joe upon the very day of my arrival in Philadelphia, and from that time until I left Philadelphia, in March, 1902, after a winter's special training with him, he was my friend and instructor; and if I ever make a name for myself in the domain of surgery it is his training that I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>thank</b> for it. [...] Many a morning would find me standing beside his operating table instead of on the benches of the lecture room where I belonged, but I have never repented my choice." ...|$|E
2500|$|Disagreement {{persists}} {{over who}} originated {{the metaphor of}} a [...] "stab in the back" [...] as an explanation for losing the First World War. [...] What emerges clearly from Thaer's observations is {{that the idea of}} off-loading responsibility for military defeat away from the military leadership originated in the Supreme Army Command. [...] Even though Hindenburg and Ludendorff tried to shift the blame for the threatened defeat [...] - and therefore the failure of their own predications to come true - during the later years of the war, away from the army, there was not at this point any talk of a planned or treacherous conspiracy. [...] But there was talk of the forces having been let down by shortcomings on the homefront, whereby inadequate soldiers and insufficient war resources had been supplied by the civilain authorities. [...] Thaer quotes Ludendorff on 1 October 1918: [...] "Right now we have no chancellor. [...] Whoever gets appointed, there are {{things that need to be}} done. [...] But I have asked His Majesty to bring into government those whom we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>thank</b> that we have come to the present position. [...] We will now see these gentlemen taking over the ministries. [...] They must now conclude the peace that must be concluded. [...] Let them now take the gruel that they have been delivering to us!" [...] This argument can really only be interpreted as a form of retreat-ideology, and in that sense the first phase in the development of the [...] Dolchstoß legend. [...] It served to obscure the failures of the military leadership, and from there of certain specific individuals.|$|E
