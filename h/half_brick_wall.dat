40|$|The {{birth of}} {{alternative}} construction techniques and new construction materials have offer many advantages {{as compared to}} the traditional construction methods and basic materials. Bricks are normally used as infill materials in framed structures in conventional design and construction of buildings. However, research has shown that bricks can also be used as an external and internal load bearing walls, where the structural masonry aided cheaper and faster construction. Load bearing walls were introduced in buildings as cost savings. The cost savings {{come in the form of}} less beam column framing system, smaller foundation, speedy erection, shorter construction time and finally reduced labour costs. In comparison to reinforced concrete framed buildings, which are by far most common found in Malaysia, new market for buildings constructed on load bearing <b>walls</b> using <b>bricks</b> need to be investigated. Wall is always known as a structural element used to divide or enclose spaces in building to form the periphery of a room or a building. This study determined the capability sand cement bricks to withstand load in load bearing wall system.
