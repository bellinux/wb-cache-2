Intel's Chengdu <b>factory,</b> <b>set</b> up in 2005 is its second in China, after its Shanghai factory, {{and the first}} such large-scale foreign investment in the electronics industry in interior mainland China. Intel, the world's largest chipmaker, has invested US$525 million in two assembly and testing facilities in Chengdu. Following the footsteps of Intel, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), the world's third largest foundry, set up an assembly and testing plant in Chengdu. Intel's rival AMD is likewise set to open an R center in this city.|$|E
500|$|It {{was also}} {{performed}} on Gaga's The Monster Ball Tour. The piano version was played by Gaga while balancing {{on the piano}} stool and holding one leg up in the air. Rapper Kid Cudi joined her then to perform his song [...] "Make Her Say" [...] which contains a sample of [...] "Poker Face". The actual version was performed at the last segment of the show. Gaga wore a dress made of guns and during the performance she pumped {{her hands in the}} air. For the revamped Monster Ball shows in 2010-11, Gaga was dancing around the stage while whipping a chain. It was also performed at the 52nd Grammy Awards, where she opened the show with the song while standing on a pedestal. Midway through the performance, she was flung into the garbage chute of the Fame <b>Factory</b> <b>set,</b> before emerging seated at a piano, facing Elton John. In May 2011, Gaga performed the song during Radio 1's Big Weekend in Carlisle, Cumbria. The song was included on the set list of her 2012-3 Born This Way Ball Tour in which she sports a modified version of her infamous meat dress. Gaga and her dancers put themselves headfirst into enormous meat grinders during the performance. For her 2014 residency show, Lady Gaga Live at Roseland Ballroom she chose to perform the song in a piano-only rendition. In the same year, at the [...] tour, Gaga performed the song in a medley with [...] "Just Dance" [...] and [...] "Telephone" [...] while wearing knee-length white dress and heels, and a bob wig.|$|E
2500|$|... (1998) The workers use {{respirators}} {{with full}} face masks, air is supplied under a mask forcibly - from the block of filtration and purification. Components of respirators {{differ from the}} <b>factory</b> <b>set</b> (workers used the most appropriate mask, comfortable units clean and cheap filters - from different manufacturers). Of the 21 cases, the workers received adequate protection only in eight cases. The minimum protection factor (5) was significantly less than expected from the respirator of this design (1000). The authors recommended the use of working methods that create less dust concentration; train workers; and prohibit the use of RPE with non-approval configuration.|$|E

2500|$|In summer 1916, the Royal Aircraft <b>Factory</b> <b>set</b> out {{to design}} a {{replacement}} for its F.E.2 two-seat pusher fighter. [...] Although effective gun synchronising gear was now available, which would allow a tractor design with superior performance to be designed, the factory chose to continue the pusher layout of the F.E.2 in its new two-seat fighter, the F.E.9. Its nacelle extended well forward of the wings and was located {{high up in the}} wing gap to give a good field of fire for the observer, who was seated in the nose, ahead of the pilot, with dual controls fitted. It had unequal span, single-bay wings, with ailerons on the upper wing only with large horn balances (the amount of control surface forward of the hinge). It was powered by a 200hp (149kW) Hispano-Suiza 8 V8 engine, with the Royal Aircraft Factory having priority for this important and widely used engine.|$|E
2500|$|Calibers {{available}} for the Contender were initially limited, stopping {{just short of the}} [...]308 Winchester-class rifle cartridges. However, almost any cartridge from [...]22 Long Rifle through [...]30-30 Winchester is acceptable, as long as a peak pressure of 48,000 CUP is not exceeded. This flexibility prompted a boom in the development of wildcat cartridges suitable for the Contender, such as the 7-30 Waters and [...]357 Herrett and the various TCU cartridges, most of which were commonly based on either the widely available [...]30-30 Winchester or [...]223 Remington cases. The largest factory caliber offered for the Contender was the [...]45-70, which, although a much larger case than the [...]308, is still feasible because of the relatively low cartridge pressures of the original black-powder round relative to the limits of the bolt face of the Contender receiver. Custom gunmakers have added to the selection, such as the J. D. Jones line of JDJ cartridges based on the [...]225 Winchester and [...]444 Marlin. Other barrel makers pushed beyond the limits the <b>factory</b> <b>set,</b> and chambered Contender barrels in lighter [...]308-class cartridges like the [...]243 Winchester. The Contender can fire [...]410 bore shotgun shells, either through the [...]45 Colt/.410 barrel or through a special [...] smoothbore shotgun barrel. A ported, rifled, [...]44 Magnum barrel was made {{available for}} use with shotshell cartridges in a removable-choke [...]44 Magnum barrel, with the choke being used to unspin the shot from the barrel rifling, or, by removing the choke, for use with standard [...]44 Magnum cartridges. The degree of flexibility provided by the Contender design is unique for experimenting with new cartridges, handloads, barrel lengths, and shotshells.|$|E
