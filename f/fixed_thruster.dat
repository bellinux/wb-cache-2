40|$|The {{development}} of a model which predicts doubly charged ion density is discussed. The accuracy of the model is shown {{to be good for}} two different thruster sizes and a total of 11 different cases. The model indicates that in most cases more than 80 % of the doubly charged ions are produced from singly charged ions. This result can be used to develop a much simpler model which, along with correlations of the average plasma properties, can be used to determine the doubly charged ion density in ion thrusters with acceptable accuracy. Two different techniques which can be used to reduce the doubly charged ion density while maintaining good thruster operation, are identified {{as a result of an}} examination of the simple model. First, the electron density can be reduced and the thruster size then increased to maintain the same propellant utilization. Second, at a <b>fixed</b> <b>thruster</b> size, the plasma density, temperature and energy can be reduced and then to maintain a constant propellant utilization the open area of the grids to neutral propellant loss can be reduced through the use of a small hole accelerator grid...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{reviews the}} {{development}} of an autonomous docking feature for a marine vessel in a small-scale, sheltered, environment. Proximity sensors are added to aid the autonomous exploration by detecting obstacles outside the lidars scan-plane, an assessment of different thrust allocations to emulate leisure boats are addressed. The Cyber Ship Saucer, a model-scale vessel built for testing in the Marine Cybernetics Laboratory at NTNU, have been serving the platform for testing the docking scheme. The model and the lab, together with autonomous systems, optimal thrust allocation, sensors and SLAM is presented as a background for the experimental work performed in this thesis. In addition to the fixed thrusters, four new configurations which considering rotation, emulating a leisure boat, have been studied. The ''constrained control allocation for azimuth thruster'' were applied to find an optimal solution for each of the modes. The online visualization process has been altered such that obstacles detected by the proximity sensors become apparent for the operator, along with the heading of the vessel. Through modifying the existing system, influencing both the path planning strategy and operator interaction, autonomous docking and take-off arose. Simulations, and later experiments, verified the autonomous docking by utilizing the proximity sensors using a <b>fixed</b> <b>thruster</b> configuration. Through the user interface, the user is able to select a spot and then inputting the desired heading there. The results are presented, and discussed, in a separate chapter. The electronic attachment contains, among other, photos and videos from the experimental trials...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the design, construction and control systems {{development of the}} marine cybernetics vessel CS Saucer. CS Saucer is a fully actuated and highly controllable vessel with a spherically shaped hull, much like a flying saucer. The vessel is fitted with three azimuth thrusters which are driven by three Torpedo 800 motors. The embedded controller myRIO from National Instruments is used to control the vessel. The system {{is powered by a}} three cell 11. 1 V Lithium Polymer battery. The hull of the vessel is constructed from three millimeter MDF sheeting, milled Divinycell foam and a woven carbon sheet fitted to the exterior of the vessel with epoxy. This results in a rigid and watertight hull with a low draft. The vessel has a detachable lid made of plexi glass that is secured {{to the top of the}} vessel with four butterfly screws. The drag forces acting on the vessel have been analyzed through testing in the Marine Cybernetics Laboratory (MC Lab) at NTNU. The results have been used to derive the parameters for a dynamic model used in Hardware-in- the-loop testing and for future model based control design. The forces produced by each of the thrusters have been mapped and approximated with linear curve fitting. This approximated force mapping has been used in the implemented thrust allocation with <b>fixed</b> <b>thruster</b> angles. Manual thruster control and manual force control of the vessel can be operated by the application on the host computer or directly from the Dashboard app from National Instruments available on Android and iOS devices. A dynamic positioning system has been implemented on the CS Saucer and tested in the MC Lab. The dynamic positioning system performs as desired when changing the setpoint for the vessel position. A tentative path following controller has also been implemented and tested on the vessel. The completed CS Saucer is a fully functioning vessel and a stable and expandable platform for use in future demonstrations, projects and research at the MC Lab...|$|E

40|$|This paper adresses {{the problem}} of {{nonlinear}} control allocation applied to marine vessels. An energy optimal solution combining a static and a dynamic non-recursive algorithm is proposed. Ships equipped with azimuth (rotatable) and tunnel (<b>fixed)</b> <b>thrusters</b> are considered. The staticsolution gives the optimal orientation of the thrust forces corresponding to minimum use of power, whereas the dynamic-solution provides dynamic capabilities. The dynamic-solution uses the Damped Least-Squares pseudo inverse of the Jacobian matrix about the static-solution. This guarantees singularity robustness, i. e. bounded solutions in all singular points. The combined solution (static and dynamic allocation) gives a 37 % reduction in thrust compared to the pure static solution when simulated on a supply vessel.

40|$|Several {{mathematical}} models, {{including a}} minimum integral square criterion problem, {{were used for}} the qualitative investigation of fuel optimal maneuvers for spacecraft with <b>fixed</b> <b>thrusters.</b> The solutions consist of intervals of "full thrust" and "coast" indicating that thrusters {{do not need to be}} designed as "throttleable" for fuel optimal performance. For the primary model considered, singular solutions occur only if the optimal solution is "pure translation". "Time optimal" singular solutions can be found which consist of intervals of "coast" and "full thrust". The shape of the optimal fuel consumption curve as a function of flight time was found to depend on whether or not the initial state is in the region admitting singular solutions. Comparisons of fuel optimal maneuvers in deep space with those relative to a point in circular orbit indicate that qualitative differences in the solutions can occur. Computation of fuel consumption for certain "pure translation" cases indicates that considerable savings in fuel can result from the fuel optimal maneuvers...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} generic {{optimization}} algorithm for the allocation of dynamic positioning actuators, such as azimuthing <b>thrusters</b> and <b>fixed</b> <b>thrusters.</b> The algorithm {{is based on the}} well-known Lagrange multipliers method. In the present approach the Lagrangian functional represents not only the cost function (the total power delivered by all actuators), but also all constraints related to thruster saturation and forbidden zones for azimuthing thrusters. In the presented approach the application of the Lagrange multipliers method leads to a nonlinear set of equations, because an exact expression for the total power is applied and the actuator limitations are accounted for in an implicit manner, by means of nonlinear constraints. It is solved iteratively with the Newton-Raphson method and a step by step implementation of the constraints related to the actuator limitations. In addition, the results from the non-linear solution method were compared with the results from a simplified set of linear equations, based on an approximate (quadratic) expression for the thruster power. The non-linear solution was more accurate, while requiring only a slightly higher computational effort. An example is shown for a thruster configuration with 8 azimuthing thrusters, typical for a DP semi-submersible. The results show that the optimization algorithm is very stable and efficient. Finally, some options for improvements and future enhancements – such as including thruster-thruster and thruster-hull interactions and the effects of current – are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an onboard closed loop attitude reorientation algorithm for a dual-spin spacecraft, Galileo. The basic concept {{for the design}} uses the despun stator as a reference and fires a sequence of <b>fixed</b> duration <b>thruster</b> pulses to precess the angular momentum vector to its commanded orientation. The error signals used to despin the stator and to perform the turn are derived from the stator error quaternion which is computed using gyro outputs. Constraints considered in the design include gyro rate saturation, plume impingement effects, system parameter variations, as well as software reliability and flexibility. The performance of the algorithm was predicted by analysis and confirmed by computer simulation results. It was concluded that a reorientation accuracy of better than 1 milliradian with a nutation angle of less than 1 degree during the turn can be achieved...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe multi-axis-coupling {{attitude}} {{control of a}} spacecraft with thrusters for attitude tracking is investigated. The attitude kinematics and dynamics are both described by error quaternions. The four error quaternion dynamic equations are then transformed into four perturbed double integrators via linear transformations. An on-off controller is designed based on the perturbed double integrators. The controller is determined by parabolic switching functions of the scalar error quaternion and the transformed vector error quaternions and their rates. The shortest possible acquiring path, external disturbance rejection, parameter uncertainty compensation are also taken into account. A non-diagonal jet-torque matrix is allowed, which makes the <b>fixing</b> of <b>thrusters</b> more flexible. The controller including no target acceleration feedback is also suitable for acquisition and tracking of maneuvering targets. Stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed by means of phase plane methods. Simulation examples are included to illustrate {{the effectiveness of the}} control scheme...|$|R
40|$|The Odyssey IV class AUV was {{designed}} to fill the evolving needs of research and industry for a deep rated (6000 meter) vehicle, which is capable of both efficient cruising and precise hovering. This AUV is powerful enough to reject currents typical in the open ocean environment and yet small enough to be deployed from a small fishing boat. The thruster layout, two vectored side <b>thrusters</b> and two <b>fixed</b> cross-body <b>thrusters,</b> allow for 4 -DOF control, which gives this vehicle precision and flexibility not possible in previous Odyssey class AUVs. An adaptable payload area allows the mounting of sensors, actuators, or other hardware suitable to a particular mission. The dynamic control layer of our behavior-based MOOS software was completely redesigned {{to take advantage of}} the capabilities of this vehicle. This is also the first platform to utilize new graphical controls and database-driven logging which increase operator efficiency and make the vehicle safer to operate. Odyssey IV's intended uses include survey and inspection of cold water corals, fisheries, archaeological sites, and subsea infrastructure. It will also serve as a research platform for computer vision-based servoing and acoustic supervisory control. This paper will document the design considerations and implementation of the Odyssey IV, as well as report on a series of field tests culminating in its first scientific deployment at Georges Bank, observing and mapping the invasive tunicate Didemnum.

40|$|Thesis (Master) [...] İzmir Institute of Technology, Mechanical Engineering, İzmir, 2012 Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves: 65 - 70) Text in English; Abstract: Turkish and Englishxv, 74 leavesIn conventional electrically driven {{propulsion systems}} with <b>fixed</b> pitch propellers, <b>thruster</b> controllers are usually aimed at controlling propeller shaft speed only. Especially in unmanned marine vehicles which operate in dynamic flow conditions, these type thruster controllers provide unsatisfactory thrust responses. The {{reason for this}} is that the thrust force is simultaneously affected by dynamic effects like, variable ambient flow velocity and angle, thruster-thruster interaction and ventilation. It is aimed to achieve acceptable thrust tracking accuracy in all kind of dynamic flow conditions in this thesis work. A novel feed-back based thruster controller which includes the effect of incoming axial flow velocity, is designed for this purpose. In controller design, first, thruster propeller's open water characteristics in four-quadrant flow states are measured. Data collected from open water tests are then non-dimensionalized and embedded in the controller's thrust model code. Relation between ideal shaft speed and desired thrust is derived by using the four-quadrant propeller model. The proposed method is evaluated in the experimental test-setup designed for this study to simulate open water conditions. Results indicate that thrust tracking performance of novel controller is acceptable in all four-quadrant flow tests...|$|R
40|$|Precision {{spacecraft}} {{formation flying}} is an enabling technology {{for a variety}} of proposed space-based observatories, such as NASA's Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF), the Micro-Arcsecond X-Ray Imaging Mission (MAXIM), and Stellar Imager (SI). This research specifically examines the precision formation flying control architecture, characterizing the relative performance of linear and nonlinear controllers. Controller design is based on a 6 DOF control architecture, characteristic of precision formation flying control. In an effort to minimize the influence of design parameters in the comparison, analysis employs "equivalent" controller gains, and incorporates an integrator in the linear control design. Controller performance is evaluated through various simulations designed to reflect a realistic space environment. The simulation architecture includes a full gravitational model and solar pressure effects. Spacecraft model properties are based on realistic mission design parameters. Control actuators are modeled as a <b>fixed</b> set of <b>thrusters</b> for both translation and attitude control. Analysis includes impact on controller performance due to omitted dynamics in the model (gravitational sources and solar pressure) and model uncertainty (mass properties, thruster placement and thruster alignment). Linearized equations of relative motion are derived for spacecraft operating {{in the context of the}} Restricted Three Body Problem. Linearization is performed with respect to a reference spacecraft within the formation. Analysis demonstrates robust stability for the Linear Quadratic Regulator controller design based on the linearized dynamics. Nonlinear controllers are developed based on Lyapunov analysis, including both non-adaptive and adaptive designs. While the linear controller demonstrates greater robustness to model uncertainty, both nonlinear controllers exhibit superior performance. The adaptive controller provides the best performance. As a key feature, the adaptive controller design requires only relative navigation knowledge. Analysis demonstrates the ability of the nonlinear controller to compensate for unknown dynamics and model uncertainty. Results exhibit the potential of a nonlinear adaptive architecture for improving controller performance. Nonlinear adaptive control is a viable strategy for meeting the extreme control requirements associated with formation flying missions like MAXIM and Stellar Imager. Mission specific analysis from a systems perspective is required to determine the best controller design...|$|R
40|$|The paper aims {{to address}} the {{challenge}} of performing precise spin-axis reorientation maneuver for prolate spacecraft (e. g. kinetic planetary penetrators) spinning about its minimal inertia axis using a single body <b>fixed</b> attitude control <b>thruster,</b> which takes into account constraints of dynamics, phase boundary and slew time, etc. Spin stabilization is an attractive way for providing attitude pointing stability to a spacecraft due to its simplicity and ability to reject against various disturbances, such as gravity gradient disturbance torque and liquid sloshing disturbance torque. This is deemed applicable to various missions involving upper stages, multiple unit cubesats, and kinetic impactors such as for MoonLITE and NEOShield projects. Furthermore, for spinners using one attitude control thruster that is perpendicular to the spin axis is theoretically feasible and advantageous in terms of simplicity and redundancy in comparison to 3 -axis stabilization control. Spin Sync slew algorithm is recently developed for the single thruster attitude control of prolate spinners. It possesses similar characteristic as Rhumb Line slew, but can be implemented to overcome the inherent singularity of the Rhumb Line slew and sun sensor failure. Both Spin Sync and Rhumb Line slews still have issues with residual nutation angle and potential divergence of the angular momentum trajectory. In this paper, a geometric method is proposed to estimate and compensate the angular momentum vector divergence. In addition, the paper presents solutions to achieve precise attitude control using spin sync slew. This is a difficult problem due to nonlinear and nonconvex attitude dynamics and constraints and is hence treated as a nonlinear multi-phase optimal control problem with constraints related to initial and terminal state, control torque magnitude, attitude dynamics, and slew time. Here, the optimization is achieved by direct transcription using Gauss pseudo-spectral method, in which the varying boundary problem is converted to a fixed boundary problem by varying optimization parameters. Computer simulations and results are provided to demonstrate the proposed approach. The optimal control achieved is also verified using engineering software simulator of 'Attitude Control Simulator for Spinning Spacecraft with Single Thruster'...|$|R
