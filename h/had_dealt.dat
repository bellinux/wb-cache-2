5|$|Following his {{retirement}} from the NWMP, Primrose {{was offered the}} position of a police magistrate in Edmonton. Primrose accepted, as he had always wanted to retire in the city. In 1917, he was chairman of the three-person Alberta Provincial Police board of commissioners, where he was tasked with supervising the new force. Before {{his retirement}} as magistrate in July 1935, it had been estimated that he <b>had</b> <b>dealt</b> with over 40,000 cases.|$|E

50|$|Other {{matters that}} are {{scattered}} through the book, correspond to matters that other unwritten volumes of Lo Crestià should <b>have</b> <b>dealt</b> with. They speak for instance about marriage and penance (and the Desè, or tenth volume, should <b>have</b> <b>dealt</b> with sacraments), religious vows and contemplation (and the Onzè, or eleventh volume, should <b>have</b> <b>dealt</b> with clergy) {{or about the}} final chapters, that deal with eschatological (and the Tretzè, or thirteenth volume, should <b>have</b> <b>dealt</b> with Eschatology {{and the end of}} the world, and the reward or punishment that people will then receive, according to medieval mentality.|$|R
50|$|This {{work could}} {{correspond}} maybe with the Onzè (eleventh volume) of Lo Crestià, that Eiximenis did not write, that should <b>have</b> <b>dealt</b> with priests. Nevertheless, {{if we consider}} that priesthood is also a sacrament, the Desè (tenth volume) of Lo Crestià should <b>have</b> <b>dealt</b> with sacraments.|$|R

The first witnesses were then called from a list of 55 that included Hare and Knox; not all the witnesses on the list were called and Knox, with three of his assistants, avoided being questioned in court. One of Knox's assistants, David Paterson—who had been the main person Burke and Hare <b>had</b> <b>dealt</b> with at Knox's surgery—was called and confirmed the pair had supplied the doctor with several corpses.|$|E
5|$|Spencer Tracy {{had been}} {{cast as the}} male lead in the film just days after MGM {{purchased}} {{the rights to the}} novel. George Cukor was chosen to direct in late April 1942 because he <b>had</b> <b>dealt</b> well with troubled and headstrong actors in the past, and Tracy was considered a difficult actor to direct. Bronisław Kaper, who had come to MGM in 1935 from Nazi Germany, was assigned to compose the film score. William H. Daniels was named the cinematographer.|$|E
5|$|The Bulgarian {{high command}} {{did not attempt}} to perform a spoiling attack as they lacked the {{necessary}} vehicles and pack animals.

5|$|French {{military}} planners had to balance competing demands for the 1781 campaign. After the unsuccessful American attempts of co-operation leading to failed assaults at Rhode Island and Savannah, they realised more {{active participation in}} North America was needed. However, they also needed to co-ordinate their actions with Spain, where there was potential interest in making {{an assault on the}} British stronghold of Jamaica. It turned out that the Spanish were not interested in operations agaynst Jamaica until after they <b>had</b> <b>dealt</b> with an expected British attempt to reinforce besieged Gibraltar, and merely wanted to be informed of the movements of the West Indies fleet.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the James River Squadron {{had turned}} its {{attention}} to Minnesota, which had left Fort Monroe {{to join in the}} battle and had run aground. After Virginia <b>had</b> <b>dealt</b> with the surrender of Congress, she joined the James River Squadron despite her damage. Because of her deep draft and the falling tide, however, Virginia was unable to get close enough to be effective, and darkness prevented the rest of the squadron from aiming their guns to any effect. The attack was therefore suspended. Virginia left with the expectation of returning the next day and completing the task. She retreated into the safety of Confederate-controlled waters off Sewell's Point for the night, but had killed 400 enemy sailors and had lost two. The Union had lost two ships and three were aground.|$|E
5|$|The {{preceding}} {{section of}} the poem <b>had</b> <b>dealt</b> at some length with the extended family of Porthaon's sister Demodice, tracing her line down to the generation following the Trojan War. Here ē' hoiai (plural) is used to jump backwards in order to complete {{the account of the}} descendants of Porthaon and Demodice's father Agenor by covering the son's family. Elsewhere the formula is used in transitions to more distant branches. The Ehoie of Mestra, for example, ultimately serves to reintroduce the family of Sisyphus, Mestra's great-granduncle who hoped to win her as bride for his son Glaucus. Although that marriage does not take place, the descendants of Sisyphus are soon presented.|$|E
50|$|Nevertheless, {{the final}} part, the one {{dedicated}} to nuns, {{which is the}} longest one, is a short treatise on theology. In this part Eiximenis gathers many of the materials (even though they are explained in a basic and schematic way), {{that were going to}} be used in the unwritten volumes of Lo Crestià. So this part deals with the theological virtues (and the Cinquè, or fifth volume should <b>have</b> <b>dealt</b> with them), the cardinal virtues (and the Sisè, or sixth volume should <b>have</b> <b>dealt</b> with them), and about the ten commandments (and the Setè, or seventh volume should <b>have</b> <b>dealt</b> with them).|$|R

5|$|Two {{days after}} her defeat in the Derby, La Fleche ran against fillies in the Oaks. Although some {{regarded}} her as a certainty, her odds drifted from 2/5 to 8/11 before the start. In the race she tracked the leader Broad Corrie before taking {{the lead in the}} straight apparently poised for an easy victory. In the final furlong however, she was closely pressed by The Smew, a filly she <b>had</b> <b>dealt</b> with easily in the 1000 Guineas, and Barrett had to ride a vigorous finish to win the race by a short head. On 29 July at Goodwood, La Fleche won the Nassau Stakes in which, despite looking less than fully fit, she quickened impressively to bear Broad Corrie by a length and a half.|$|E
5|$|In 963, {{following}} the death of Emperor Romanos II, Nikephoros {{turned his attention to the}} power struggle that saw him ascend the imperial throne. The defeats of the previous years, and particularly the occupation of Aleppo, <b>had</b> <b>dealt</b> a heavy blow on Sayf al-Dawla's power and authority. At the same time, the Hamdanid prince also suffered from physical decline, with the onset of hemiplegia as well as worsening intestinal and urinary disorders, that henceforth confined him to a litter. The disease limited Sayf al-Dawla's ability to intervene personally in the affairs of his state; he soon abandoned Aleppo to the charge of his chamberlain, Qarquya, and spent most of his final years in Mayyafariqin, leaving his senior lieutenants to carry the burden of warfare against the Byzantines and the various rebellions that increasingly occurred in his domains.|$|E
5|$|Stephen was {{initially}} secure on his throne but, by 1139, stresses had appeared. David I invaded England in 1138, {{and some of}} the English nobles rebelled, but Stephen <b>had</b> <b>dealt</b> with both threats by April 1139. Later that year, he arrested Roger, the Bishop of Salisbury, and his nephews Nigel, the Bishop of Ely and Alexander, the Bishop of Lincoln, who were not only powerful ecclesiastics but important royal administrators. In September 1139, Matilda landed in England to contest the throne, supported by her half-brother Robert. Stephen himself was captured in February 1141 by Matilda's forces, but Robert's subsequent capture by forces loyal to Stephen later that year allowed his exchange for Stephen in November 1141. The result was an effective stalemate, with Stephen controlling parts of the country and others under the control of Matilda's supporters. During the 1140s, Matilda's husband, Geoffrey of Anjou, wrested Normandy from Stephen.|$|E

5|$|The Romans {{were well}} aware that their victory was still fragile, and {{that as soon as}} the Parthian king <b>had</b> <b>dealt</b> with the Hyrcanian rebellion, he would turn his {{attention}} to Armenia. Despite Vologases' reluctance to risk an all-out conflict with Rome, in the end, he was forced to act when Tigranes raided the Parthian province of Adiabene in 61. The enraged protests of its governor Monobazus, and his pleas for protection, could not be ignored by Vologases, whose prestige and royal authority were at stake. Vologases therefore hastily concluded a treaty with the Hyrcanians so as to be free to campaign against Rome, and called an assembly of the grandees of his realm. There he publicly reaffirmed Tiridates' position as king of Armenia by crowning him with a diadem. In order to reinstall his brother on the Armenian throne, the Parthian king assembled a force of picked cavalry under Monaeses, complemented by infantry from Adiabene.|$|E
5|$|The {{police did}} not find the {{silencer}} in the cupboard. One of Bamber's cousins found it on 10 August, with {{what appeared to be}} flecks of red paint and blood, and took it to another of the cousin's homes; it took the police a further three days to collect it. A few days after that, it was the cousins who found a scratch on the red mantelpiece that the prosecution said was caused by the silencer during a struggle for the gun; that accounted for the fleck of red paint. The Bible found near Sheila was not examined at all. Journalist David Connett writes that a hacksaw blade that might have been used to gain entry to the house lay in the garden for months. Officers did not take contemporaneous notes; those who <b>had</b> <b>dealt</b> with Bamber wrote down their statements weeks later. The bodies were released days after the murders, and three of them (June, Nevill and Sheila) were cremated. Bamber's clothes were not examined until one month later. Ten years later all blood samples were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Unable to {{effectively}} {{respond to the}} Bulgarian campaign due to the engagement of their forces against the Arabs, the Byzantines convinced the Magyars to attack Bulgaria, promising to transport them across the Danube using the Byzantine navy. Leo VI may have also concluded an agreement with Arnulf {{to make sure that}} the Franks did not support Simeon against the Magyars. In addition, the talented commander Nikephoros Phokas was called back from southern Italy to lead a separate army against Bulgaria in 895 with the mere intention to overawe the Bulgarians. Simeon, unaware of the threat from the north, rushed to meet Phokas' forces, but the two armies did not engage in a fight. Instead, the Byzantines offered peace, informing him of both the Byzantine foot and maritime campaign, but intentionally did not notify him of the planned Magyar attack. Simeon did not trust the envoy and, after sending him to prison, ordered the Byzantine navy's route into the Danube closed off with ropes and chains, intending to hold it until he <b>had</b> <b>dealt</b> with Phokas.|$|E
