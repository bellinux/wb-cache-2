25|$|The dams are {{supposed}} to be strong enough to survive natural and terrorist threats. Both their construction schemes and government efforts work towards this goal. For instance, some <b>engineers</b> <b>guarantee</b> that every Dnieper dam will survive an earthquake (to its typical regional extent), meteorite or aircraft falling. There are also countermeasures against overflooding and malfunction of dams. Authorities pay significant attention to safeguarding the dams and bridges by special units of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and other security agencies.|$|R
50|$|Southern Pacific {{also changed}} its cargo weight procedures, which {{required}} that the clerks assume that every freight car on every train was carrying the maximum load {{it was designed to}} carry if the submitted paperwork did not indicate a weight. By assuming the maximum weight of the train, that would <b>guarantee</b> that the <b>engineer</b> would assign at least the minimum number of locomotives needed to ensure that the train would have enough braking capacity needed to keep the train under control on steep grades.|$|R
40|$|Generating correct {{specifications}} for real-time event-driven software systems {{is difficult and}} time-consuming. Even when such specifications have been created, they are often used to guide development rather than state properties guaranteed by the actual system. We propose a specification genera-tor that reads execution traces and can generate invariants with real-time constraints. That specification can also offer programmers the ability to repair violated invariants at run-time. Creating fault-tolerant systems in this manner would provide software <b>engineers</b> <b>guarantees</b> about the software’s high-level operation {{and its ability to}} recover from errors...|$|R

This was agreed {{by most of the}} unions. Sytsma held out for a <b>guarantee</b> that locomotive <b>engineers</b> would retain their 15% salary differential over other train crew members.In 1982 Sytsma was named a member of the National Labor Advisory Council of the Republican National Committee.In May 1986 Sytsma was involved in negotiations with Amtrak over a dispute that could have led to a strike affecting hundreds of thousands of commuters on the east coast of the USA.|$|R
40|$|Radwaste must be {{isolated}} from the biosphere for a long periods. To isolate waste, engineered clay barriers can be constructed. The functional life of such engineered barriers must be much longer (factor 100 - 1000) than that of more common engineered structures. Can the responsible <b>engineer</b> <b>guarantee</b> a functional life of several thousand years? Probably not, therefore waste like radwaste is stored at great depths, in a combination of geological and engineered barriers. During the storage period the waste itself (radiation) or derived products (oxidation of containers) can interact with the engineered and geological clay barriers. In,this contribution it is discussed how such interactions affect the hydro-mechanical properties of clay barriers. First some examples are given that show how properties of clays change at surface conditions if clays are exposed to typical waste products like different cations. Thereafter a method is proposed to classify the potential of hydro-mechanical modifications at three different scales: the particle level, the interlayer level and the tetrahedral-octahedral level. Next it is explained why the reactivity of clays at depth during long-term waste isolation is different (smaller) from the better known reactivity of clays at the surface. Instead of directing {{too much attention to}} such well known interactions, the focus for a safe deep disposal of radwaste should be directed to reactions that play a role at depth if, e. g. damage due to radiation occurs. Only if such reactions can be excluded, a safe storage of waste is possible. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Tentative Parcel Map No. 09 - 001 and Demolition Permit No. 10 - 002 to {{subdivide}} one legal {{lot with}} a gross lot area of 5. 71 acres and a net lot area of 5. 52 acres into four buildable lots and one remainder lot. The net lot area of each buildable lot {{will be at}} least one acre. The remainder lot will be deed restricted to be preserved as open space. The proposed project includes the demolition of an existing single-family residence and abandonment of associated onsite wastewater treatment system (OWTS). Site improvements, including rough grading, drainage, and all-weather access roads and safety-vehicle turnarounds, will be conducted as part of the TPM process in anticipation of four future single-family residences on each proposed buildable lot. Grading will be minimal as the subject property is relatively flat and only 126 cubic yards is expected to be imported. The developer must either conduct all of these site improvements or submit an Undertaking Agreement and a Faithful Performance and Labor and Materials Bond in the amount estimated by the City <b>Engineer</b> <b>guaranteeing</b> the installation of these improvements prior to the adoption of the final parcel map. Construction of a single-family residence on each of the proposed buildable lots {{is not part of the}} proposed project. However, development of the proposed buildable lots is within a reasonably foreseeable future. Given the applicable rural residential land use and zoning designations, a single-family residence is a permitted use and would likely be the primary use of each proposed buildable lot. Therefore, future construction offour single-family residences and associated development is evaluated in the initial study for potential cumulative environmental impacts...|$|R
40|$|Industrial Biotechnology is {{increasingly}} replacing chemical processes in numerous industrial sectors since {{it allows the}} use of renewable raw-materials and provides a more sustainable manufacturing base. The field of Metabolic Engineering (ME) has thus gained a major importance since it allows the design of improved microorganisms for industrial applications, starting with wild-type strains that usually have low production capabilities {{in terms of the}} target compounds. The ultimate aim of ME is to identify genetic manipulations in silico leading to improved microbial strains, that can be implemented using novel molecular biology techniques. This task, however, is a complex one, requiring the existence of reliable (genome-scale-) metabolic models for strain simulation and robust optimization algorithms for target identification. Strain simulation is usually performed by using Linear or Quadratic Programing methods that assume a steady state over the intracellular metabolites. However, there is no <b>guarantee</b> that the <b>engineered</b> cells actually function according to the optimal pathway predicted by these methods. In this scope, we have been working towards the use of a modification of the concept of Control Effective Fluxes {{to be able to find}} Metabolic Engineering solutions that couple growth with product formation while considering optimal, as well as sub-optimal routes and their efficiency. Regarding strain optimization, the most common task is to solve a bi-level optimization problem, where the strain that maximizes the production of a given compound is sought, while trying to keep the organism viable. Several different algorithms have been proposed to address this problem, namely mixed integer linear programming. More recently, we have proposed the use of stochastic meta-heuristics, such as Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) and Simulated Annealing (SA). These approaches allow to solve the Metabolic Engineering problem in a considerable shorter time, originating a family of (sub) optimal solutions. Moreover, they are quite flexible regarding the use of non-linear objective functions. However, so far optimization approaches have been limited to the tasks of selecting the best set of genes to knockout from an organism. To extend the manipulation possibilities, we have been using both dynamic and steady-state models in modified formulations to account for gene over and under expression. In this way, it is possible to indicate the set of genes that should be modified, the type of modification that should be performed and the degree of over and underexpression. These algorithms have been validated with different case-studies, namely the production of lactic and succinic acid with E. coli and S. cerevisiae and some are already available in the open source and user friendly software tool Optflux...|$|R
