5|$|However, {{the most}} obvious {{deficiency}} of the Roman army remained its shortage of cavalry, especially heavy cavalry.

5|$|In the {{interests}} of keeping the strip exciting, it seemed that no season for Melchester Rovers could ever consist of mid-table obscurity. Almost every year, the club was either competing for the major honours {{at the top of}} the domestic and European game, or struggling against relegation to lower divisions. Often, such spells of good and bad fortune and form would directly succeed one another—a Rovers team that won the European Cup one year could <b>find</b> <b>itself</b> struggling to stay in Division One the next.|$|E

5|$|On {{the edge}} of the Munassib Depression, Bertram risked a double bluff. From 15 October 1942, a week before the attack, Camouflage {{constructed}} three and a half dummy field regiments of artillery. They were carefully made to appear seriously camouflaged, but day by day, they were maintained less and less well, to allow the enemy to decide it was facing dummy guns at Munassib. When the real battle had begun, the dummies were replaced at night with real artillery, which then kept utterly still for a day. An Axis tank attack on Munassib was shocked to <b>find</b> <b>itself</b> being fired on by the massed 'dummy' guns.|$|E
5|$|The {{plan was}} for Major-General Hunter and a flying column of crack troops to race with all {{possible}} speed from Merowe north-east to Abu Hamed, {{where they would}} surprise the numerically inferior Mahdist garrison and win control of the town. Speed was essential, for it was certain Hunter's column would be spotted by Mahdist scouts during the journey. If these scouts managed to send word and reinforce the town prior to Hunter's arrival, his column might <b>find</b> <b>itself</b> outmatched and forced to retreat.|$|E
5|$|Charles's {{cautious}} {{failure to}} directly assault the town, putting {{a higher priority}} on minimising losses than on victory, had cost the Royalists dearly; while claims for their number of dead and wounded men ranged from 1,000 to 1,500, only around 50 people inside the city were killed. Essex's force, on the other hand, was in relatively good shape; its one issue {{was the lack of}} supplies. If he stayed in the Severn Valley, Essex would be unable to get reinforcements or outside aid, the London elements of the army would demand to go home, and the one remaining significant Parliamentarian force would <b>find</b> <b>itself</b> pinned down, while Charles, with secure bases at Oxford and Bristol, would be able to starve them into surrender while other Royalist armies ran rampant through Britain. Because of this, Essex {{had no choice but to}} try to return to London. Travelling back across the Cotswolds, as he had done to reach Gloucester initially, would expose the Parliamentarians to Charles's cavalry on open ground.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{concerns}} {{had been}} growing about the unsympathetic treatment of historic military buildings by the War Office; for its part, the War Office was concerned that it might <b>find</b> <b>itself</b> financially supporting these properties from its own budget. Yarmouth Castle was passed to the Commissioners of Woods and Forests in 1901, with parts of it were leased to the neighbouring hotel. The War Office concluded that Walmer and Deal had no remaining military value and agreed to transfer the castles to the Office of Works in 1904, who opened both former fortifications to visitors. Portland Castle was placed onto what {{was known as the}} Schedule C list, which meant that the Army would continue to use and manage the historic property, but would receive advice on the suitability of repairs from the Office of Works.|$|E
5|$|Nationalist {{activity}} ceased {{during the}} course of World War I (WWI) and many nationalists were killed in the trenches. The nationalist movement was revived by the periodical Breiz Atao, which was founded in 1919. In 1923, it adopted Pan-Celticist ideals, drawing a line between Gauls and Bretons, and arguing that the traditionally federal Bretons were oppressed by the autocratic Latins of France. Support was instead to be sought in the north, the Easter Rising and the Irish War of Independence were portrayed as the implementations of a successful formula that was to be emulated shall France <b>find</b> <b>itself</b> in dire straits. The incorporation of Alsace-Lorraine into France as a consequence of Germany's defeat in WWI, {{led to the creation of}} an Alsatian autonomist movement that opposed the French imposition of Laïcité. In 1928, Breizh Atao established contacts with the Alsace-Lorraine Party, which in turn facilitated the spread of Nordism and Völkisch ideology into Breton nationalist circles. Ties with the ethnically German Alsatians strengthened and with them the idea of accepting Abwehr assistance, which was already being provided to the Flemish and Alsatians alike.|$|E
5|$|The Wars of the Roses {{broke out}} between the Lancastrians and Richard's Yorkist faction in the 1450s. Ludlow Castle did not <b>find</b> <b>itself</b> in the front-line {{of most of the}} conflict, instead acting as a safe retreat away from the main fighting. An {{exception}} to this was the Battle of Ludford Bridge which took place just outside the town of Ludlow in 1459, resulting in a largely bloodless victory for the Lancastrian Henry VI. After the battle, in a bid to break Richard's power over the region, Edmund de la Mare was placed in charge of the castle as constable, with John Talbot, the Earl of Shrewsbury, being given the wider lordship. Richard was killed in battle in 1460, and his son Edward seized the throne the following year, retaking control of Ludlow Castle and merging it with the property of the Crown.|$|E

5|$|As in the {{original}} Rome: Total War, Europa Barbarorums strategic campaign sees the player take control of a particular faction and then compete for territory and resources against all the other factions, which are controlled by the game's artificial intelligence. The player is presented with a map of Europe, North Africa and the Near East in which territory is divided into 200 provinces, each of which contains a province capital, which will at any given point be controlled either by the player's faction, a rival playable faction, or the non-playable Eleutheroi faction, which represents the world's minor kingdoms, regional powers and rebel states. If a faction should at any point <b>find</b> <b>itself</b> not in control of any provinces, it is eliminated from the game. Gameplay is turn-based, each turn representing the passage of three months on the campaign map (unlike the six months of {{the original}} Rome: Total War) and alternating between the player managing their empire and the artificial intelligence making all the other factions' moves. A key game mechanic of the campaign map is the annexation of territory, which is done province-by-province, either by successfully besieging the province capital, or by acquiring it from another faction through diplomacy. Once a faction has acquired a province, they may construct buildings in the province capital which either enable the recruitment of certain military units or grant various bonuses to the city such as greater resilience during a siege or a decreased likelihood of the province rebelling. Provided the city contains the appropriate buildings, the player may recruit military units in the city {{at the same time as}} undertaking construction projects. The aim of the game is to acquire a specified number of provinces and/or eliminate specified rival factions (in Europa Barbarorum particular victory conditions differ for each faction), whilst avoiding being eliminated by the other factions.|$|E
25|$|The French light Cavalry {{was shocked}} to <b>find</b> <b>itself</b> outclassed by Russian {{counterparts}} {{so much so that}} Napoleon had ordered that infantry be provided as back up to French light cavalry units.

25|$|The {{definitions}} of the outcomes decided upon are subject to interpretation by those implementing them. Across different programs or even different instructors outcomes could be interpreted differently, leading to a difference in education, even though the same outcomes {{were said to be}} achieved.

Consequently, the US could <b>find</b> <b>itself</b> bombing operational missiles if blockade failed to force Khrushchev to remove the missiles already on the island.|$|E
25|$|When an ICG {{vessel was}} sighted, the frigates would sail towards it and place {{themselves}} between the trawlers and the ICG vessel, sailing parallel at close range. Occasionally, {{because of the}} close manoeuvring and heavy seas, one ship would <b>find</b> <b>itself</b> across the path of another. This led to accusations of ramming between the two countries, but accounts from each side differ as to who rammed who; the British maintain that the Icelandic vessels turned and rammed them using their strengthened bows, whereas Iceland maintain that the British ships turned across their bows and immediately slowed down. Altogether, 14 'rammings' were recorded by the ICG between October 1972 and September 1973.|$|E
25|$|The Moldavians' (as well as Wallachians') {{favourite}} {{military doctrine}} in (defensive) wars was a scorched earth policy combined with harassment of the advancing enemy using hit-and-run tactics and disruption {{of communication and}} supply lines, followed by a large scale ambush: a weakened enemy would be lured {{in a place where}} it would <b>find</b> <b>itself</b> in a position hard or impossible to defend. A general attack would follow, often with devastating results. The shattered remains of what was once the enemy army would be pursued closely and harassed {{all the way to the}} border and sometimes beyond. A typical example of successful employments of this scenario is the Battle of Vaslui.|$|E
