5|$|The University of Alaska also grew {{during this}} period.

The institute was established in 1949 and spurred the university's growth as the GI Bill simultaneously boosted the student population. Elementary education also developed as the Fairbanks Independent School District (the precursor to today's Fairbanks North Star Borough School District) was established in 1947 to collect school taxes from areas outside city limits that were sending students to Fairbanks' school. The Golden Valley Electric Association, an electrical cooperative, was founded in the 1940s to provide <b>electricity</b> <b>to</b> areas outside Fairbanks city limits. In 1953, it bought the FE Co. power plant that served Fairbanks and provided <b>electricity</b> <b>to</b> customers as varied as Fairbanks' second radio station, KFRB, and the town's largest farm, Creamer's Dairy.|$|E

Vision is of little importance in hunting, as the ray's eyes are often obscured as it lies buried on the bottom.

5|$|After the Gas Boom {{began to}} sweep {{the state in the}} 1880s, Lilly and other Commercial Club members {{advocated}} the creation of a public corporation to pump natural gas from the ground, pipe it to Indianapolis from the Trenton Gas Field, and provide it at low cost to businesses and homes. The project {{led to the creation of}} the Consumer Gas Trust Company, which Lilly named. The gas company provided low-cost heating fuel that made urban living much more desirable. The gas was further used to create <b>electricity</b> <b>to</b> run Indianapolis's first public transportation venture, a streetcar system.|$|E
5|$|Although ionic {{compounds}} contain charged atoms or clusters, {{these materials}} do not typically conduct <b>electricity</b> <b>to</b> any significant extent when the substance is solid. In order to conduct, the charged particles must be mobile rather than stationary in a crystal lattice. This is achieved {{to some degree}} at high temperatures when the defect concentration increases the ionic mobility and solid state ionic conductivity is observed. When the ionic compounds are dissolved in a liquid or are melted into a liquid, they can conduct electricity because the ions become completely mobile. This conductivity gain upon dissolving or melting is sometimes used as a defining characteristic of ionic compounds.|$|E

5|$|Construction of the B Station began {{shortly after}} the A station was completed. The {{stations}} were built during {{a period in which}} there were great advances in power station technology, and in the scale of production, which led to them having a variety of intermediate generator set sizes along with a mix of design styles. Blyth A had a generating capacity of 480megawatts (MW) and the B Station 1,250MW. Their combined capacity of 1,730MW briefly made Blyth Power Station the largest electricity generation site in England, until Ferrybridge C Power Station came into full operation in 1966. The stations were capable of generating enough <b>electricity</b> <b>to</b> power 300,000homes.|$|E
5|$|Electricity {{distribution}} in the state {{as well in the}} Federal Territory of Labuan are operated and managed by the Sabah Electricity Sdn. Bhd. (SESB). Sabah electrics are mostly generated from diesel power plant, hydropower and combined cycle power plants. The only main hydroelectric plant is the Tenom Pangi Dam. The combined cycle power plant called Kimanis Power Plant was completed in 2014, supplying 300 MW, with 285 MW nominal capacity. The plant is a joint venture between Petronas and NRG Consortium that also includes facilities such as gas pipeline of Sabah‚ÄìSarawak Gas Pipeline and a terminal of Sabah Oil and Gas Terminal. There is another two combined cycle power plants with a capacity of 380 MW operated by Ranhill Holdings Berhad. In 2009, the electricity coverage covers 67% of the state population and by 2011 increase to 80%. The coverage reach 100% in 2012 after an allocation of RM962.5million from the federal government were given to expand the coverage under the 2012 National Budget. The electrical grid is divided into two of West Coast and East Coast which has been integrated since 2007. The West Coast Grid supplies <b>electricity</b> <b>to</b> Kota Kinabalu, Papar, Beaufort, Keningau, Kota Belud, Kota Marudu, Kudat and Labuan with a capacity of 488.4 MW and maximum demand of 396.5 MW. While the East Coast Grid supplies <b>electricity</b> <b>to</b> the major towns of Sandakan, Kinabatangan, Lahad Datu, Kunak, Semporna and Tawau with a capacity of 333.02 MW and maximum demand of 203.3 MW.|$|E
5|$|In 1883, Cornell {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{university}} campuses to use <b>electricity</b> <b>to</b> light the grounds from a water-powered dynamo. In 1904, a hydroelectric plant was built in the Fall Creek gorge. The plant takes water from Beebe Lake through a tunnel in the side of the gorge to power up to 1.9 megawatts of electricity. The plant continued to serve the campus's electric needs until 1970, when local utility rates placed a heavy economic penalty on independently generating electricity. The abandoned plant was vandalized in 1972, but renovated and placed back into service in 1981.|$|E
