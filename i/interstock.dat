5000|$|When CTV {{was first}} {{discovered}} quarantine {{was the best}} management strategy, now quarantining only works for areas where {{a small amount of}} trees are infected. The other approach that was adopted after T. citricida came to the U.S. was destroying any tree in which the budwood was not free of CTV. [...] This is a more drastic measure but must be done due to how fast T. citricida can spread the virus. If there is any CTV in the area, avoid grafting trees on sour orange rootstock and instead graft on tristeza-tolerant rootstock. Since the virus has been in Asia a long time they have used rootstock from trifoliate orange, Sunki, and Shiikuwasha (C. depressa Hayata) for many years. Some hybrids, such as Troyer citrange or Swingle citromelo, show promise as resistant root-stock. Also, using scion varieties tolerant to stem pitting is recommended. The production of virus-free trees by shoot-tip grafting or heat treatment is very important. If it is possible to keep the field permanently free of CTV, the planting of virus-free trees is practical. In areas where it is difficult to find a virus-free field, preinoculation with a mild CTV strain protects trees against infection with a severe strain of CTV. Bud-stock trees should be inoculated with a mild CTV strain at least four to six months prior to propagation. They should then be kept in a greenhouse, under aphid-free conditions. It is also recommended that nurseries of young plants grown for propagation should be kept vector-free. Top-grafting with pre-inoculated buds onto <b>interstock</b> trees infested with severe CTV is not effective, because the tree has little protection against the disease. It is necessary to spray nursery plants and young trees with insecticide occasionally, to control aphids. This should retard any re-infection with the virus. A biological approach has been to bring in a parasitoid wasp from Asia that naturally controls A. spiraecola. This approach was stopped when T. citricida arrived due to it not being a parasite of the more important aphid. There is a natural parasite of aphids in Florida in the gall midge family Cecidomiidae that attempts to keep aphid levels down, however due to the influx in aphid population it {{has not been able to}} keep populations down.|$|E

40|$|Grafting is a centuries-old {{technique}} used in plants to obtain economic benefits. Grafting increases nutrient uptake and utilization efficiency {{in a number}} of plant species, including fruits, vegetables, and ornamentals. Selected rootstocks of the same species or close relatives are utilized in grafting. Rootstocks absorb more water and ions than self-rooted plants and transport these water and ions to the aboveground scion. Ion uptake is regulated by a complex communication mechanism between the scion and rootstock. Sugars, hormones, and miRNAs function as long-distance signaling molecules and regulate ion uptake and ion homeostasis by affecting the activity of ion transporters. This review summarizes available information on the effect of rootstock on nutrient uptake and utilization and the mechanisms involved. Information on specific nutrient-efficient rootstocks for different crops of commercial importance is also provided. Several other important approaches, such as <b>interstocking</b> (during double grafting), inarching, use of plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria, use of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, use of plant growth substances (e. g., auxin and melatonin), and use of genetically engineered rootstocks and scions (transgrafting), are highlighted; these approaches can be combined with grafting to enhance nutrient uptake and utilization in commercially important plant species. Whether the rootstock and scion affect each other’s soil microbiota and their effect on the nutrient absorption of rootstocks remain largely unknown. Similarly, the physiological and molecular bases of grafting, crease formation, and incompatibility are not fully identified and require investigation. Grafting in horticultural crops can help reveal the basic biology of grafting, the reasons for incompatibility, sensing, and signaling of nutrients, ion uptake and transport, and the mechanism of heavy metal accumulation and restriction in rootstocks. Ion transporter and miRNA-regulated nutrient studies have focused on model and non-grafted plants, and information on grafted plants is limited. Such information will improve the development of nutrient-efficient rootstocks...|$|R

In double-grafted plants, GFP-plant (scion) /P 50 -plant (<b>interstock)</b> /GFP-plant (rootstock), the systemic silencing in scion was inhibited when GFP silencing was induced in rootstock. Analysis of P 50 deletion mutants indicated that the N-terminal region (amino acids 1 – 284) is important for its suppressor activity. In gel mobility shift assay, P 50 lacks binding ability with siRNAs. These results indicated that P 50 has a unique suppressor activity that specifically inhibits the long-distance movement of silencing signals...|$|E
40|$|Os experimentos foram realizados no viveiro da Embrapa Transferência de Tecnologia em Canoinhas SC, no período de dezembro de 2003 a julho de 2005. Estudou-se o efeito de interenxertos, na produção de mudas de pessegueiro. Os tratamentos foram: combinação de dois porta-enxertos ('Okinawa' e 'Capdeboscq'), quatro interenxertos (ameixeira 'Reubennel' e 'Irati', um umezeiro e uma cerejeira 'Capulin') e duas copas ('Coral' e 'Chimarrita'). O delineamento {{experimental}} inicial foi inteiramente ao acaso, com 20 tratamentos, 6 repetições e 8 plantas por parcela. Após a cicatrização e o crescimento dos enxertos, as mudas foram transplantadas para pomar definitivo, sem os tratamentos com os interenxertos de umezeiro e cerejeira que apresentaram baixa sobrevivência com os porta-enxertos de pessegueiro utilizados neste trabalho. O delineamento neste caso foi em blocos ao acaso, com 12 tratamentos, 4 repetições e 11 plantas por parcela. O crescimento das copas foi avaliado pelas seguintes variáveis: diâmetro 5 cm acima do ponto de enxertia, comprimento da ramificação principal e número de ramificações secundárias. Com relação ao crescimento das copas, verificou-se que as mudas interenxertadas com ameixeira apresentam um crescimento reduzido, com possibilidade de utilização em pomares mais adensados.

The effect of <b>interstock</b> was studied, {{in the production of}} peach tree seedlings. The treatments had been the combination of two rootstock ('Okinawa' and 'Capdeboscq'), four <b>interstock</b> (plum tree 'Reubennel' and 'Irati', Umezeiro and cherry 'Capulin') and two scion ('Coral' and 'Chimarrita'). O initial experimental design used were entirely randomized, with 20 treatments, 6 replications and 8 plants for parcel. After the cicatrisation and growth of the scion, the seedlings had been transplanted for definitive orchard, without the treatments with the interstocks of Umezeiro and Cherry that presented low survival with the peach tree rootstocks used in this work. O delineation in this in case that he were block-type randomized with 12 treatments, 4 repetitions and 11 plants for parcel. The growth of the scion was estimated for the variables: diameter 5 cm above of the point of graft, length of the main ramification and number of secondary ramifications. With relation to the growth of the scion, was verified more that the intergrafting seedlings with plum tree present a reduced growth, with possibility of use in accumulated orchards...|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} <b>interstock</b> {{differences in}} condition, {{it would be}} advantageous to develop stock-level condition indices from standardized databases on weight and length. This study describes a method for estimating stock-level condition when individual-level observations on length and weight are not easily accessible. For each year in a 56 -year time series (1946 - 2001) for Northeast Arctic cod (Gadus morhua), pseudo-observations of weight and length were generated by pairing the Norwegian and Russian values for weight-at-age provided annually to the assessment working group with estimates of length-at-age derived from the same databases. A weight-length relationship fit to each year was then used to predict weight-at-length, i. e., girth, {{for a range of}} standard lengths (30 - 120 cm). This index was uncorrelated with both the liver condition index and the abundance of Barents Sea capelin (Mallotus villosus), suggesting that at the stock level, the girth of cod is not necessarily indicative of the magnitude of stored energy reserves. Partitioning body size into length-at-age and girth revealed long-term trends in body size. In particular, large/old cod showed substantially higher values of both length-at-age and girth that could be the result of long-term increases in fishing mortality...|$|E
40|$|This study {{attempted}} to characterise 5 field stocks of B. canis, collected from various geographic areas of southern Africa {{in terms of}} pathogenicity, immune response, cross resistance and antigenic composition. This was done by means of artificial infection of two to four year old Beagle dogs. Serological tests included indirect fluorescent antibody tests, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Western blotting of B. canis antigen and immune serum transfers. The ZIM 1, GHT 1, QTN 1 and DBN 1 stocks {{were found to be}} virulent and the JHB 1 stock, which might be a cardiac form of babesiosis, was found to be highly virulent. Immune responses of dogs to primary challenges were poor. A second challenge or relapse was important {{in the development of a}} resistant immunity. Heterologous challenges showed that dogs which were immune to the ZIM 1, QTN 1 and DBN 1 stocks were partially immune to the JHB 1 stock. The dog that was immune to the GHT 1 stock was the only one that was totally resistant to the JHB 1 stock. Western blots revealed <b>interstock</b> antigenic variation between the JHB 1 and the other four stocks. These differences were, however, not great enough to separate the stocks taxonomically. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{wreckfish}} Polyprion americanus is {{a component}} of directed and admixed species fisheries throughout its world range and has recently been identified for its aquaculture potential. Several wreckfish broodstocks were founded in Galician hatcheries {{in the last decade}} and are now approaching maturity. The combination of genetic markers with classic domestication strategies is a pertinent approach to preserve genetic variation and to slow down consanguineous-derived adverse effects. Genetic data from microsatellites used to characterize four Galician wreckfish stocks provide evidence of both, a significant <b>interstock</b> differentiation (7. 60 %) and a pronounced loss of allele diversity (26 %) in 80 % of the stocks. Such artificial sub-structuring linked to the erosion of gene diversity is most likely caused by sampling drift that stepped up from the North Atlantic population. Computer simulation of relatedness helps to appraise alternate breeding protocols to avoid uncontrolled inbreeding within stocks. We show that under a fixed number of breeders and a sex balanced contribution, two protocols consisting on randommatingamong broodstocks (ΔRxy= 2. 21 %) or enhancedwith a wild sample (ΔRxy= 0. 97 %), are far more advantageous strategies to slow inbreeding in F 1 and F 2 than breeding protocols within stock (ΔRxy= 6. 6 %).

40|$|Graft {{combinations}} {{were made}} between flowering (donor) and non-flowering (receptor) plants, and grown in a photoperiod unfavourable for flowering of the receptor. Donor {{leaves of the}} short-day (SD) plant Perilla crispa caused a maximum flowering response after exposure to 30 SD. By the use of radioactive sucrose it was shown that a functional phloem connection between donor and receptor was necessary for transmission of the floral stimulus. Induced Perilla leaves transferred to LD had not lost their capacity to induce flower formation after 3 months. But leaves taken from flowering receptor branches did not function as donors. Thus, photoperiodic induction of Perilla was permanently conserved in the SD-treated leaves. This was in contrast to Xanthium (SD plant) in which indirectly induced shoots could themselves transfer the floral stimulus to receptors. Transmission of the floral stimulus was also demonstrated between: Kalanchoë (SD plant) and Sedum (LD plant), and between Maryland Mammoth tobacco (SD plant) and Nicotiana sylvestris (LD plant). In either case, the LD plant {{as well as the}} SD plant could function as donor for the other partner. A day-neutral tobacco variety did not cause flower formation in Maryland Mammoth tobacco, but when grafted as <b>interstock</b> between N. sylvestris and Maryland Mammoth tobacco it permitted transfer of the flowering stimulus. It was concluded that in graft-compatible species the floral stimuli of SD and LD plants seemed to be identical. <p/...|$|E
40|$|It is {{impossible}} to preserve all pear species which were collected {{from all over the}} world in the field,. In this study, Taiwan native pear (Pyrus koehnei, Schneider) were grafted onto the branch of pear preservedd varieties. We choose the thinner, non-dominant twigs to graft, and choose the more vigorous, dominant twigs to be the control. We find it had higher growth rate of the twig grafted with P. koehnei, compared to the control treatment to prove the effect of the technique of <b>interstock</b> grafting preservation. A few months latrer, the diameter of thinner twig is higher than the control one, even replace the orihginal main twig to become the main trunk. The reason of the phenomenon may be the higher growth rate, the shorter dormant period, the more numerous leaves of P. koehnei grafted onto the cultivars of pear. Pyrus koehmei fit the sub-tropical and tropical area should be the key point reason. We can save more space if we use the double-working grafting or triple-working grafting and even more grafting. Double-working is grafting a few repository cultivars together on one stock, and the top of scions is Pyrus koehnei that protect the other scions. The best effect is grafting two repository cultivars and then graft the protect scion Pyrus koehnei. 以臺灣野梨(Pyrus koehnei) 為根砧及頂砧，將大部分來自溫帶地區的厘種源以中間砧的型態在臺灣平地加以保存；雖然冬季低溫明顯不足，其生長勢與各品系無高接者比較，有極顯著的差異。此方法可以使品種保存的成本及所需場地大大減少。 各品種在高接臺灣野梨之初期有半年至一年的停滯期，一但開始生長其生長勢與臺灣野梨實生苗無異；即使側枝或不具主幹優勢的枝條都會取得優勢，並成為主幹。高接之前為主幹的對照枝條，仍可顯示該品種物候期並作為繁殖之用...|$|E
40|$|The {{recessive}} dad 1 - 1 allele conditions {{a highly}} branched growth habit {{resulting from a}} proliferation of first- and second-order branches. Unlike the wild-type parent, which has lateral branching delayed until {{the third or fourth}} leaf node distal to the cotyledons, dad 1 - 1 initiates lateral branching from each cotyledon axil. In addition to initiating lateral branching sooner than the wild type, dad 1 - 1 sustains branching through more nodes on the main shoot axis than the wild type. In keeping with a propensity for branching at basal nodes, dad 1 - 1 produces second-order branches at the proximal-most nodes on first-order branches and small shoots from accessory buds at basal nodes on the main shoot axis. Additional traits associated with the mutation are late flowering, adventitious root formation, shortened internodes, and mild leaf chlorosis. Graft studies show that a dad 1 - 1 scion, when grafted onto wild-type stock, is converted to a phenotype resembling the wild type. Furthermore, a small wild-type <b>interstock</b> fragment inserted between a mutant root stock and a mutant scion is sufficient to convert the dad 1 - 1 scion from mutant to a near wild-type appearance. The recessive dad 1 - 1 phenotype combines traits associated with cytokinin overexpression, auxin overexpression, and gibberellin limitation, which suggests a complex interaction of hormones in establishing the mutant phenotype...|$|E
40|$|Twelve wild {{collections}} and one commercial strain {{were used to}} characterize breeding systems and to develop molecular identities in the Arvenses section of the genus Agaricus, which includes the “horse mushroom” A. arvensis. Two morphotypes were identified based on macro- and micromorphological features. However, not all collections could be delimited by conventional taxonomic characters. Sequencing of the small subunit intergenic spacer (ITS) region (368 to 370 bp) of the rRNA genes clearly resolved the 13 collections into two clusters consistent with the identified morphotypes. Single-spore progenies and mating type testers were established and used to test intra- and <b>interstock</b> compatibility. The two compatibility groups identified were consistent with ITS clusters. Compatibility group I stocks readily interbred within the constraints of a unifactorial heterothallic system with a multiallelic mating type factor. Compatibility group II had a more restricted breeding pattern, and interactions were difficult to predict {{on the basis of}} mating type. Morphological data, ITS sequences, and the ability to interbreed suggest that these collections are part of a complex of interrelated species. Single-spore, homokaryotic isolates from both compatibility groups were able to fruit in compost culture, and two of the collections may represent natural homokaryotic fruiting. We conclude that species from the section Arvenses have versatile unifactorial heterothallic life cycles that permit both interbreeding and homokaryotic fruiting...|$|E
40|$|Composition of {{membrane}} lipids {{from the}} gills of juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in presmolt and smolt phases of development was compared among anadromous and non-anadromous populations. Three stocks migrating from spawning rivers to either lake (landlocked stock), brackish water or full strength sea water were grown under common garden conditions, and gill lipids and their acyl and alkenyl chains {{were examined in}} February (presmolts) {{and at the end}} of May (smolts) by mass spectrometry and gas-liquid chromatography. The most remarkable changes upon transition from the presmolt phase to the smolt phase were: (i) increase in the cholesterol/phospholipid ratio, (ii) decrease in the abundance of phosphatidylinositol (PI) content, (iii) increase in the amount of sulfatides, (iv) increase in phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) species with two highly unsaturated acyl chains, and finally (v) convergence of <b>interstock</b> differences in PC and PE species composition towards a similar lipid composition. Increases in the gill membrane content of cholesterol and sulfatides are discussed as pre-adaptation of salmon gills for salt-secretion, which may occur by increases in membrane microdomains (rafts) harboring ion channels and pumps. The decreases of PI were likely related to adjusting the gill membrane permeability to ions by diminishing prostanoid production. The similarity of those changes among three salmon stocks and the convergence of initially (presmolt phase) different PC and PE species profiles between the stocks towards similar lipid composition suggests that smoltification process of the gill epithelium is largely similar in anadromous and landlocked populations...|$|E
