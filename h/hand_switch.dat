5000|$|The {{railroad}} did {{not come}} to Lyon County until 1885 when the Burlington, Cedar Rapids and Northern Railway (BCR&N) proposed to construct a line between Little Rock, Iowa and Sioux Falls, South Dakota via Rock Rapids. The county and local citizens promised financial support, and the line was completed the following year. The Cedar Rapids, Iowa Falls and Northwestern Railway, which was affiliated with the BCR&N, laid the track and built the structures. The depot is a one and two-story frame building. The decorative treatment of the exterior of building is in the Stick style. The single story section was used as a warehouse. Bridge No. 2834 is a 550 ft structure, and features a horizontal circular curve. [...] The Plate girder bridge is nine spans in length. The eastern two spans cross the main channel of the Rock River, the interior six spans cross Island Park, and the western span crosses the west branch of the Rock River. Just {{to the north of the}} depot is a <b>hand</b> <b>switch</b> along the tracks (date unknown).|$|E
5000|$|The Airflare, {{sometimes}} {{also called}} an Airtrack, is an advanced move {{that is similar}} in concept to a Halo, also known as Headtracks or just tracks. This is because they share the feel {{when it comes to}} piking your legs and swinging them in between the <b>hand</b> <b>switch.</b> While performing an Air Flare, the breaker is inverted with his torso at a 45 degree angle to the floor. (angle can differ. the smaller the angle, the greater the difficulty). his legs in a V-shape, and his arms straight. The hands are the only body part that touch the floor as the move is being performed. The bboy whips his legs, then arms around so that he travels in a circular path. Air Flares can also be referred to as Air Tracks: however, Air Tracks was originally a single 360 spin in the air that would be a transition move linking to another. Later, people would start doing Air flares {{in the manner of a}} continuous Air track, rendering both names to be basically the same move, since the difference in execution is so minimal. (Air flares reach across the chest and Air tracks reach over the head - the inclination of the body is irrelevant in this case.) ...|$|E

5000|$|Manigault was {{particularly}} {{famous for his}} leaping abilities on the basketball court. However much of his legend is unsupported playground myth, including his signature move - the double dunk. He allegedly would dunk the ball, catch it with his left <b>hand,</b> <b>switch</b> the ball to his right hand, bring it back around {{to the top of}} the basket and jam it through again, all done while still in the air on a single jump, and without hanging on the rim. However this is a story repeatedly told but unconfirmed. It was refuted by Manigault himself in a CNN interview available on YouTube when he called the reports of this feat rubbish, stating not even The Goat could do that. Like other street basketballers of the day such as Jackie Jackson, Earl was reportedly able to touch the top of the backboard to retrieve quarters and dollar bills, part of [...] "elaborate innovations and tricks" [...] elite street players of the era performed before games to help build their reputations. Again, this has never been confirmed. Like the dunking myth,it is always referred to as [...] "reportedly" [...] without a credible source to support it. It is refuted in Todd Gallagher's book [...] " [...] Andy Roddick Beat Me With a Frying Pan." [...] The book dedicates an entire chapter to this myth concluding it was never done by Manigault or anyone else, including NBA stars.Gallagher writes [...] " [...] Earl [...] "The Goat" [...] Manigault is widely regarded as one of the greatest playground basketball players of all time. Although he never played in the NBA and only briefly played in college, the legend of Manigault has spread far and wide and led to his play being glorified in magazines, books, and even a movie starring Don Cheadle called Rebound: The Legend of Earl [...] "The Goat" [...] Manigault. There are a number of tales regarding Manigault's prowess, but the central story that propelled his legend was that he had such extraordinary leaping ability he could pull dollar bills off the top of the backboard and leave change. What made this even more amazing was that Manigault was, depending on who you talk to, somewhere between 5-11 and 6-1. Considering that the top of the backboard is at thirteen feet and the average six-foot-tall man can only touch about eight feet high standing flat-footed, Manigault would have had to jump at least sixty inches to even come close. He was only 6' 1", but attributed his tremendous jumping ability to having in childhood often worn ankle weights during practice. (Such efficacy of ankle weights is doubtful, however.) He once dunked two-handed during a game from near the foul line over two players much taller than himself (Sahil Muliyil 6'8", David Urenda 6'9"). He once reverse dunked 36 times in a row to win a $60 bet.|$|E
40|$|In a {{sequential}} task, {{the grasp}} postures people select {{depend on their}} movement history. This motor hysteresis effect results from the reuse of former movement plans and reduces the cognitive cost of movement planning. Movement plans for hand trajectories not only transfer across successive trials, but also across hands. We therefore asked whether such a transfer would {{also be found in}} movement plans for hand postures. To this end, we designed a sequential, continuous posture selection task. Participants had to open a column of drawers with cylindrical knobs in ascending and descending sequences. A <b>hand</b> <b>switch</b> was required in each sequence. Hand pro/supination was analyzed directly before and after the <b>hand</b> <b>switch.</b> Results showed that hysteresis effects were present directly before, but absent directly after the <b>hand</b> <b>switch.</b> This indicates that, in the current study, movement plans for hand postures only transfer across trials, but not across hands...|$|E
40|$|Healthy {{aging is}} {{associated}} with a variety of functional and structural brain alterations. These age-related brain alterations have been assumed to negatively impact cognitive and motor performance. Especially important for the execution of everyday activities in older adults (OA) is the ability to perform movements that depend on both hands working together. However, bimanual coordination is typically deteriorated with increasing age. Hence, a deeper understanding of such age-related brain-behavior alterations might offer the opportunity to design future interventional studies in order to delay or even prevent the decline in cognitive and/ or motor performance over the lifespan. Here we examined to what extent the capability to acquire and maintain a novel bimanual motor skill is still preserved in healthy OA as compared to their younger peers (YA). For this purpose, we investigated performance of OA (n= 26) and YA (n= 26) in a bimanual serial reaction time task (B-SRTT), on two experimental sessions, separated by one week. We found that even though OA were generally slower in global response times, they showed preserved learning capabilities in the B-SRTT. However, sequence specific learning was more pronounced in YA as compared to OA. Furthermore, we found that switching between hands during B-SRTT learning trials resulted in increased response times (<b>hand</b> <b>switch</b> costs), a phenomenon that was more pronounced in OA. These <b>hand</b> <b>switch</b> costs were reduced in both groups over the time course of learning. More interestingly, there were no group differences in <b>hand</b> <b>switch</b> costs on the second training session. These results provide novel evidence that bimanual motor skill learning is capable of reducing age-related deficits in <b>hand</b> <b>switch</b> costs, a finding that might have important implications to prevent the age-related decline in sensorimotor function...|$|E

40|$|Many {{tasks in}} our daily life demand not only the use of {{different}} fingers of one hand in a serial fashion, but also to alternate from one hand to the other. Here, we investigated performance in a bimanual serial reaction time task (SRTT) with particular emphasis on learning-related changes in reaction time (RT) for consecutive button presses for homologous index- and middle fingers. The bimanual SRTT consisted of sequential button presses either with {{the left or right}} index- and middle-finger to a series of visual letters displayed on a computer screen. Each letter was assigned a specific button press with one of four fingers. Two outcome measures were investigated: (a) global sequence learning as defined by the time needed to complete a 15 -letter SRTT sequence and (b) changes in <b>hand</b> <b>switch</b> costs across learning. We found that bimanual SRTT resulted in a global decrease in RT during the time course of learning that persisted for at least two weeks. Furthermore, RT to a button press showed an increase when the previous button press was associated with another hand as opposed to the same hand. This increase in RT was defined as switch costs. <b>Hand</b> <b>switch</b> costs significantly decreased during the time course of learning, and remained stable over a time of approximately two weeks. This study provides evidence for modulations of switch costs during bimanual sequence learning, a finding that might have important implications for theories of bimanual coordination and learning...|$|E
40|$|Recent studies about {{sensorimotor}} {{control of}} the human hand have focused on how dexterous manipulation is learned and generalized. Here we address this question by testing {{the extent to which}} learned manipulation can be transferred when the contralateral hand is used and/or object orientation is reversed. We asked subjects to use a precision grip to lift a grip device with an asymmetrical mass distribution while minimizing object roll during lifting by generating a compensatory torque. Subjects were allowed to grasp anywhere on the object’s vertical surfaces, and were therefore able to modulate both digit positions and forces. After every block of eight trials performed in one manipulation context (i. e., using the right hand and at a given object orientation), subjects had to lift the same object in the second context for one trial (transfer trial). Context changes were made by asking subjects to switch the hand used to lift the object and/or rotate the object 180 u about a vertical axis. Therefore, three transfer conditions, <b>hand</b> <b>switch</b> (HS), object rotation (OR), and both <b>hand</b> <b>switch</b> and object rotation (HS+OR), were tested and compared with hand matched control groups who did not experience context changes. We found that subjects in all transfer conditions adapted digit positions across multiple transfer trials similar to the learning of control groups, regardless of different changes of contexts. Moreover, subjects in both HS and HS+OR group also adapted digit forces similar to the control group, suggesting independent learning of the left hand. In contrast, the OR group showed significant negative transfer of the compensatory torque due to an inability to adapt digit forces. Our result...|$|E
