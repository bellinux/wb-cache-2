5|$|Host-{{parasite}} mimicry <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> {{a parasite}} mimics its own host. As with mimicry {{of the female}} sex outlined previously, only two species are involved, the model and mimic being of the same species. Brood parasitism, a form of kleptoparasitism where the mother has its offspring raised by another unwitting organism, is one such situation where host-parasite mimicry has evolved. Pasteur terms this form of aggressive-reproductive mimicry Kirbyan mimicry, after the English entomologist William Kirby.|$|E
25|$|The speed {{lines of}} gas turbine {{centrifugal}} compressors typically exhibit choke. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> the pressure ratio of a speed line drops rapidly (vertically) {{with little or}} no change in flow. In most cases {{the reason for this is}} that close to Mach 1 velocities have been reached somewhere within the impeller and/or diffuser generating a rapid increase in losses. Higher pressure ratio turbocharger centrifugal compressors exhibit this same phenomenon. Real choke phenomena is a function of compressibility as measured by the local Mach number within an area restriction within the centrifugal pressure stage.|$|E

2500|$|The above {{equation}} can {{be manipulated}} to solve for M {{as a function of}} H. However, due to the form of the T/T* equation, a complicated multi-root relation is formed for M = M(T/T*). Instead, M can be chosen as an independent variable where Î”S and H can be matched up in a chart as shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 shows that heating will increase an upstream, subsonic Mach number until M = 1.0 and the flow chokes. [...] Conversely, adding heat to a duct with an upstream, supersonic Mach number will cause the Mach number to decrease until the flow chokes. [...] Cooling produces the opposite result for each of those two cases. The Rayleigh flow model reaches maximum entropy at M = 1.0 For subsonic flow, the maximum value of H occurs at M = 0.845. [...] This indicates that cooling, instead of heating, causes the Mach number to move from 0.845 to 1.0 [...] This is not necessarily correct as the stagnation temperature always increases to move the flow from a subsonic Mach number to M = 1, but from M = 0.845 to M = 1.0 the flow accelerates faster than heat is added to it. Therefore, this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> heat is added but T/T* decreases in that region.|$|E
