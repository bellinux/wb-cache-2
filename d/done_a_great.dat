5|$|For printing, {{the mass}} {{production}} of paper for writing was already well established in China. The papermaking process had been perfected and standardized by the Han dynasty court eunuch Cai Lun (50–121) in 105, {{and was in}} widespread use for writing even by the 3rd century. The Song dynasty was the world's first government in history to issue paper-printed money—the banknote (see Jiaozi and Huizi). Toilet paper had been in general use in China since the 6th century, paper bags for preserving the flavor of tea leaves by the 7th century, and by the Song dynasty government officials who had <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> service were rewarded by the court with gifts of paper-printed money wrapped in paper envelopes. During the Song dynasty, independent and government sponsored industries were developed {{to meet the needs}} of a growing population that had reached over 100 million. For example, for the printing of paper money alone, the Song court established several government-run mints and factories in the cities of Huizhou, Chengdu, Hangzhou, and Anqi. The size of the workforce employed in these paper money factories was quite large, as it was recorded in 1175 that the factory at Hangzhou alone employed more than a thousand workers a day.|$|E

Peter Beardsley had England's best chance after 13 minutes, {{following}} a slip from Nery Pumpido in Argentina's goal, but failed to take it.

25|$|India {{has been}} using {{imported}} enriched uranium and are under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards, but it has developed {{various aspects of the}} nuclear fuel cycle to support its reactors. Development of select technologies has been strongly affected by limited imports. Use of heavy water reactors has been particularly attractive for the nation because it allows Uranium to be burnt with little to no enrichment capabilities. India has also <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> amount of work {{in the development of a}} Thorium centred fuel cycle. While Uranium deposits in the nation are extremely limited, there are much greater reserves of Thorium and it could provide hundreds of times the energy with the same mass of fuel. The fact that Thorium can theoretically be utilised in heavy water reactors has tied the development of the two. A prototype reactor that would burn Uranium-Plutonium fuel while irradiating a Thorium blanket is under construction at the Madras/Kalpakkam Atomic Power Station.|$|E

Although Janet Maslin of The New York Times admitted the film's plot was [...] "demented", she wrote that the film [...] "has <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal to ensure the series' longevity". Rushworth Kidder of the Christian Science Monitor praised the film for giving audiences a view of their modern life from a different perspective, while simultaneously proving that a film {{does not need to}} have murder, violence, innuendo or even a main villain for dramatic storytelling.|$|E

She often met them while visiting Neil Aspinall at his London home. On these occasions, the Beatles often had small gifts for her which they had acquired on their travels. For her part, Mona allowed them to use her father's military medals in the photo shoot for the Sgt. Pepper album cover.|$|E

Despite this, she said that [...] "the episode wasn't as [...] as [...] hoped it would be" [...] and [...] "felt like there was more potential in Howard's bachelor party than just revealing some unflattering secrets to Bernadette." [...] Robin Pierson of The TV Critic rated the episode as 56 out of 100, describing Howard's [...] "little speech" [...] as [...] "very well written and performed". However, he considered most of the comedy [...] "generic", especially in regards to the jokes about Jewish stereotypes and Penny's dismissal of Leonard. Overall, Pierson said it [...] "wasn't the strongest episode of comedy" [...] and [...] "wasn't a particularly interesting episode until the end".|$|E
500|$|On March 3 against Northwestern, Dawkins {{posted a}} career-high 21 {{points in a}} 49-minute double {{overtime}} appearance. On March 7, Michigan won its Big Ten Conference finale against Rutgers with a career-high scoring effort by Dawkins (31). The 31 points was the most by a Michigan freshman since Trey Burke posted 32 against Minnesota on March 9, 2012 in the 2012 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament.

For conference play of the 2014–15 Big Ten Conference men's basketball season, Dawkins led the league in both Effective field goal percentage and True shooting percentage, but that season did not show strengths in other aspects of the game such as assists, rebounding, defense and drawing fouls.
