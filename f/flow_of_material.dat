5|$|At {{the end of}} his {{lifetime}} the Linnean collection in Uppsala was considered one of the finest collections of natural history objects in Sweden. Next to his own collection he had also built up a museum for the university of Uppsala, which was supplied by material donated by Carl Gyllenborg (in 1744–1745), crown-prince Adolf Fredrik (in 1745), Erik Petreus (in 1746), Claes Grill (in 1746), Magnus Lagerström (in 1748 and 1750) and Jonas Alströmer (in 1749). The relation between the museum and the private collection was not formalised and the steady <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> from Linnean pupils were incorporated to the private collection rather than to the museum. Linnaeus felt his work was reflecting the harmony of nature and he said in 1754 'the earth is then nothing else but a museum of the all-wise creator's masterpieces, divided into three chambers'. He had turned his own estate into a microcosm of that 'world museum'.|$|E

25|$|The huge {{variety of}} the shapes is {{partially}} the projection effect—the same nebula when viewed under different angles will appear different. Nevertheless, {{the reason for the}} huge variety of physical shapes is not fully understood. Gravitational interactions with companion stars if the central stars are binary stars may be one cause. Another possibility is that planets disrupt the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> away from the star as the nebula forms. It has been determined that the more massive stars produce more irregularly shaped nebulae. In January 2005, astronomers announced the first detection of magnetic fields around the central stars of two planetary nebulae, and hypothesized that the fields might be partly or wholly responsible for their remarkable shapes.|$|E
40|$|The {{logistics}} {{concept was}} initially developed within the manufacturing industry and now constitutes an important management tool to ensure an overall strategic {{perspective on the}} <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> in the production process. This paper contends that this concept is also relevant to the construction industry, and describes the development of logistics methods to manage the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> from suppliers to installation on-site, and its application to a Danish housing project. The case study {{evidence suggests that the}} focal points of logistics concepts are the interfaces between parties, exchange of information and the development across project organisational boundaries based on partnering-type arrangements. The management <b>of</b> the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> from the logistics point of view also requires early planning of the selection <b>of</b> <b>materials,</b> and in more detail, than is required in the traditional approach to materials procurement...|$|R

25|$|When {{sedimentation}} continues, {{an older}} rock layer becomes buried deeper as a result. The lithostatic {{pressure in the}} rock increases due to {{the weight of the}} overlying sediment. This causes compaction, a process in which grains mechanically reorganize. Compaction is, for example, an important diagenetic process in clay, which can initially consist of 60% water. During compaction, this interstitial water is pressed out of pore spaces. Compaction can also be the result of dissolution of grains by pressure solution. The dissolved material precipitates again in open pore spaces, which means there is a net <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> into the pores. However, in some cases, a certain mineral dissolves and does not precipitate again. This process, called leaching, increases pore space in the rock.|$|E
25|$|The marker {{technique}} for {{friction stir welding}} provides data on the initial and final positions of the marker in the welded material. The <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> is then reconstructed from these positions. Detailed material flow field during friction stir welding can also be calculated from theoretical considerations based on fundamental scientific principles. Material flow calculations are routinely used in numerous engineering applications. Calculation of material flow fields in friction stir welding can be undertaken both using comprehensive numerical simulations or simple but insightful analytical equations. The comprehensive models for the calculation of material flow fields also provide important information such as geometry of the stir zone and the torque on the tool. The numerical simulations have shown the ability to correctly predict the results from marker experiments and the stir zone geometry observed in friction stir welding experiments.|$|E
2500|$|The {{success of}} forming is in {{relation}} to two things, the flow and stretch of material. [...] As a die forms a shape from a flat sheet of metal, {{there is a need}} for the material to move into the shape of the die. [...] The <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> is controlled through pressure applied to the blank and lubrication applied to the die or the blank. [...] If the form moves too easily, wrinkles will occur in the part. [...] To correct this, more pressure or less lubrication is applied to the blank to limit the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> and cause the material to stretch or set thin. [...] If too much pressure is applied, the part will become too thin and break. [...] Drawing metal requires finding the correct balance between wrinkles and breaking to achieve a successful part.|$|E

2500|$|Improvements in {{tool design}} {{have been shown}} to cause {{substantial}} improvements in productivity and quality. TWI has developed tools specifically designed to increase the penetration depth and thus increasing the plate thicknesses that can be successfully welded. An example is the [...] "whorl" [...] design that uses a tapered pin with re-entrant features or a variable pitch thread to improve the downwards <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>material.</b> Additional designs include the Triflute and Trivex series. The Triflute design has a complex system of three tapering, threaded re-entrant flutes that appear to increase material movement around the tool. The Trivex tools use a simpler, non-cylindrical, pin and have been found to reduce the forces acting on the tool during welding.|$|E

2500|$|Contact, compression, decompression, and {{the passage}} of the shock wave all occur within a few tenths of a second for a large impact. The {{subsequent}} excavation of the crater occurs more slowly, and during this stage the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> is largely subsonic. During excavation, the crater grows as the accelerated target material moves away from the point of impact. The target's motion is initially downwards and outwards, but it becomes outwards and upwards. The flow initially produces an approximately hemispherical cavity that continues to grow, eventually producing a paraboloid (bowl-shaped) crater in which the centre has been pushed down, a significant volume of material has been ejected, and a topographically elevated crater rim has been pushed up. [...] When this cavity has reached its maximum size, it is called the transient cavity.|$|E
2500|$|All {{of these}} {{technology}} assessments {{have to do}} with energy resources only, and not with material resources. Georgescu stressed the point that even with the proliferation of solar collectors throughout the surface of the globe, or the advent of fusion power, or both, any industrial economy will still depend on a steady <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> resources extracted from the crust of the Earth, notably metals. He repeatedly argued his case that in the (far) future, it will be scarcity of terrestrial material resources, and not of energy resources, that will prove to impose the most binding constraint on man's economy on Earth. [...] As he held no space advocacy views, Georgescu failed to assess the (still) emerging technology of asteroid mining or any other known type of space colonisation as potentials for compensating for this future scarcity constraint facing mankind: He was convinced that throughout its entire span of existence, our species will remain confined solely to Earth for all practical purposes. His paradigmatic vision concluded thereby.|$|E

50|$|The major {{challenge}} that materials managers face is maintaining a consistent <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> for production.
