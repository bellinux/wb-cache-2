5|$|Because army ants are {{unpredictable}} {{in their}} movements, it is impractical for obligate ant-followers {{to maintain a}} territory that always contains swarms to feed around. Antbirds have evolved a more complicated system than the strict territoriality of most other birds. They generally (details vary among species) maintain breeding territories but travel outside those territories in order to feed at swarms. Several pairs {{of the same species}} may attend a swarm, with the dominant pair at the swarm being the pair which holds the territory that the swarm is in. In addition to competition within species, competition among species exists, and larger species are dominant. In its range, the ocellated antbird is the largest of the obligate ant-following antbirds and is dominant over other members of the family, although it is subordinate to various species from other families (including certain woodcreepers, motmots and the rufous-vented ground cuckoo). At a swarm, the <b>dominant</b> <b>species</b> occupies positions above the central front of the swarm, which yields the largest amount of prey. Smaller, less <b>dominant</b> <b>species</b> locate themselves further away from the centre, or higher above the location of the <b>dominant</b> <b>species,</b> where prey is less plentiful.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the site {{is made up of}} species-rich grassland (subcommunity MG5c), which comprises three <b>dominant</b> <b>species</b> of grass and several other grass species at lower abundances. The <b>dominant</b> <b>species</b> are Red Fescue (Festuca rubra), Common Bent (Agrostis capillaris) and Yorkshire Fog (Holcus lanatus). The less abundant species of grass include, Crested Dog's-tail (Cynosurus cristatus), Heath-grass (Danthonia decumbens) and Cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata). The subcommunity also has many broad-leaved herbs including Common Knapweed (Centaurea nigra), Tormentil (Potentilla erecta), Devils-bit scabious (Succisa pratensis) and Betony (Stachys officinalis).|$|E

5|$|Sodium {{chromate}} {{is produced}} industrially by the oxidative roasting of chromite ore with calcium or sodium carbonate. The <b>dominant</b> <b>species</b> is therefore, {{by the law}} of mass action, determined by the pH of the solution. The change in equilibrium is visible by a change from yellow (chromate) to orange (dichromate), such as when an acid is added to a neutral solution of potassium chromate. At yet lower pH values, further condensation to more complex oxyanions of chromium is possible.|$|E
5|$|These {{patterns}} – a few common {{species and}} many rare ones; {{the dominance of}} arthropods and sponges; and the percentage frequencies of different life-styles – seem to apply {{to all of the}} Burgess Shale. However the identity of the <b>dominant</b> <b>species</b> differs between sites. For example, Marrella splendens is often credited as the commonest animal in the Burgess Shale, because of its abundance among the specimens collected by Walcott, but is only the third-most abundant organism in the Greater Phyllopod Bed, and very rare at other localities.|$|E
5|$|Seabird colonies {{are highly}} variable. Individual nesting sites can be widely spaced, as in an {{albatross}} colony, or densely packed {{as with a}} murre colony. In most seabird colonies, several different species will nest on the same colony, often exhibiting some niche separation. Seabirds can nest in trees (if any are available), on the ground (with or without nests), on cliffs, in burrows under the ground and in rocky crevices. Competition can be strong both within species and between species, with aggressive species such as sooty terns pushing less <b>dominant</b> <b>species</b> out of the most desirable nesting spaces. The tropical Bonin petrel nests during the winter to avoid competition with the more aggressive wedge-tailed shearwater. When the seasons overlap, the wedge-tailed shearwaters will kill young Bonin petrels {{in order to use}} their burrows.|$|E

40|$|To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that <b>dominant</b> plant <b>species</b> could acquire different nitrogen (N) forms over a spatial scale and they also {{have the ability to}} compete for available N with microbes. A short-term N- 15 labeling experiment was conducted in the temperate grassland ecosystem of North China in July of 2013. Three N forms (NO 3 (-) (,) NH 4 (+) and glycine) labeled with N- 15 were injected into the two soil depths (0 - 5 and 5 - 15 cm) surrounding each plant to explore N acquisition by plants and microbes. Three <b>dominant</b> plant <b>species</b> (Artemisia frigida, Cleistogenes squarrosa and Artemisia capillaris) were investigated. Two hours after N- 15 labeling, all three <b>dominant</b> plant <b>species</b> absorbed both organic and inorganic N, but different patterns were observed at two soil depths. Uptake of NO 3 (-) was significantly higher at 0 - 5 cm than at 5 - 15 cm soil depth among all the <b>dominant</b> plant <b>species.</b> N- 15 recovery by microbes was significantly higher than plants. However, N- 15 recovery by plants showed different patterns over soil depths. <b>Dominant</b> plant <b>species</b> in the temperate grassland have different patterns in acquisition of N added to soil in organic form and absorption of inorganic N, and microbes were more effectively than plants at competing for N in a short-term period...|$|R
5|$|The {{river is}} nutrient-poor and acidic (pH 4.33) which determines {{the type of}} plant life found there. Mosses and liverworts are the most common. Near the source {{compressed}} flapwort (Nardia compressa) and green algae are the most <b>dominant</b> <b>species.</b> Closer to the mouth water earwort (Scapania undulata), feather moss and bulbous rush (Juncus bulbosus) are also found. Holt's mouse-tail moss (Isothecium holtii) is very common on the banks; the Shimna River {{is one of only}} three known sites for this species in Northern Ireland. It is also the only known location in Northern Ireland where Portuguese feather-moss (Platyhypnidium alopecuroides) is found.|$|E
5|$|The {{species has}} been found growing in small groups in the Guineo-Congolian rainforest. This forest is {{dominated}} by the single canopy tree species Gilbertiodendron dewevrei. Not only does this tree provide food in the form of edible seeds {{for a wide variety of}} large mammals, it forms mycorrhizal relationships with P.bembae. This is a mutually beneficial relationship where the hyphae of the fungus grow around the roots of the plant, enabling the fungus to receive moisture, protection and nutritive byproducts of the tree, and affording the tree greater access to soil nutrients. The ectomycorrhizal symbiosis is thought to contribute to the success of the <b>dominant</b> <b>species,</b> by allowing it access to nutrients otherwise unavailable. The Congolian forests encompass an ecoregion known for its species richness and endemism, which is spread across four countries: Cameroon, Gabon, Republic of Congo, and the Central African Republic.|$|E
5|$|The terrans are a young {{species with}} psionic potential. The terrans of the Koprulu sector descend from the {{survivors}} of a disastrous 23rd century colonization mission from Earth. Compared to the protoss and zerg, the terrans are technologically inferior, lacking in genetic-diversity, and highly factionalized. The seven dominant government factions are the Moebius Foundation, the Kel-Morian Combine, the Tarsonis Republic, the Mar Sara Republic, the Terran Dominion, the Umojan Protectorate, and the United Earth Directorate. Terrans are {{in a constant state}} of conflict: whenever they are not caught in the two-front pitched battle crossfire with their alien neighbors' interstellar conflicts, they endure frequent assassinations, civil wars and revolutions amongst themselves. Nevertheless, terran ingenuity and unyielding stubbornness has kept them from extinction; they stand as one of the three <b>dominant</b> <b>species</b> of the galaxy.|$|E

5|$|The tunnel {{runs through}} {{an area with}} complex and varied geology. It runs through two rock complexes, the Halsnøy Basement Rock on the Sveio side, and Hardangerfjord Cover Complex on the Stord side. Both were created during the {{creation}} of the Caledonian orogeny 500 million years ago. The Halsnøy Basement Rock consists of Precambrian rock with elements of gneiss of both sedimentary and magmatic origin. They range between granite gneiss to mylonite. In the area between the two complexes, there is some amount of gabbro. At the lowest point, the tunnel runs through a section of phyllite, which continues to be the <b>dominant</b> <b>species</b> until the tunnel reaches Otterøya. Below the island the tunnel reaches a section of greenstone, before it rises again through more phyllite.|$|E
5|$|The {{ecosystem}} of Dal is ecologically rich in macrophytes, submerged macrophytes, floating macrophytes and phytoplankton. Macrophyte flora {{recorded in}} the lake's aquatic and marshland environment consists of 117 species, belonging to 69 genera and 42 families. The lake is noted in particular for its Nelumbo nucifera (lotus flowers) which bloom in July and August. The prolific growth of Ceratophyllum demersum in the eutrophic zones has been reported, with Myriophyllum spicatum and Potemogetton lucens cited as <b>dominant</b> <b>species.</b> Other macrophytes discerned in different zones of the lake include Typho angustata, Phragmites australis, Myriophyllum, Sparganium evectum and Myriophyllum verticillatum, which contribute {{to the production of}} macrophites. The rooted variety of the floating leaf type consists of Neelambium nucifera, Nymphaea alba, N.Tertagonia, N.Candida, Nymphoides peltatum, Salvinia natans, Hydrocharis dubia, Nymphaea sp. and Potamogeton natans, all of which occupy 29.2% of the lake. Phytoplanktons include Navicula radiosa, Nitzschia accicularis, Fragilaria crotonensis, Diatoma elongatum, Scenedesmus bijuga, Pediastrum duplex, Tetraedron minimum, Microcystis aeruginosa and Merismopedia elegans.|$|E
5|$|The green-head ant is a diurnal {{species that}} is active {{throughout}} the day, quickly foraging {{on either the}} ground or vegetation. They are scavengers, predators and seed-eaters, generally having a broad diet of animal material, insects, small arthropods, honeydew from sap-sucking insects and seeds. The workers usually prey on beetles, moths and termites, using their stingers to kill them by injecting venom. The removal of the capitula (structure similar to an elaiosome) from Eurycnema goliath eggs reduces the chances of them being collected by green-head ants that carry them back into their nests. In areas where the meat ant (Iridomyrmex purpureus) is dominant, the green-head ant is not affected by its presence and is still successful in finding food sources. As green-head ants are primitive general predators, {{in contrast to the}} more advanced species (which forage in groups and always communicate via trail pheromones), they are unable to defend food sources from dominant ants. They rely heavily on any food source, and the impossibility of successfully defending it from other ants may have led to their peaceful coexistence with <b>dominant</b> <b>species,</b> including meat ants.|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} pattern of demersal fish and food {{habits of the}} <b>dominant</b> fish <b>species</b> were studied off the Pacific coast of eastern Hokkaido {{during the summer of}} 2003 - 2004 and the winter of 2005. In summer, the assemblages on the upper continental slope (700 m) was dominated by macrourids(chiefly, Coryphaenoides cinereus and C. pectoralis). However, in winter, the boundary between assemblages on the middle slope was obscured slightly by the bathymetric descent of threadfin hakeling from the upper-middle slopes to the lower-middle slopes. Most <b>dominant</b> fish <b>species</b> preyed primarily on nekton, micronekton and zooplankton. However, the <b>dominant</b> fish <b>species</b> utilizing common food organisms belonged to different assemblages. This pattern of assemblage structure is characteristic of weak inter-specific competition for food and appears to be an important factor underlying increased biomass of demersal fish...|$|R

5|$|Soul Reaver {{takes place}} within the fictional world of Nosgoth, where {{the health of the}} land is tied to the nine Pillars of Nosgoth, and each pillar in turn is {{represented}} by a guardian. Before the events of Soul Reaver, the guardians became corrupt, and, after Kain killed eight of them, he discovered he was the final one. Refusing to sacrifice himself to restore the Pillars, he doomed Nosgoth to eternal decay and proceeded to raise his vampire lieutenants, including Raziel, to besiege the land. By the time of Soul Reavers introduction, the vampires are now the land's <b>dominant</b> <b>species</b> and apex predators, the humans have been decimated, and the vampire tribes have each claimed a region of Nosgoth and turned their attention to internal matters. Unknown to the vampires, beneath Nosgoth lurks The Elder God, an ancient and powerful entity. The Elder God controls the Wheel of Fate, a cycle of reincarnation of souls that circle the Wheel in a loop of predestination; however, because vampires are immortal, their souls do not spin with the Wheel, causing the land to decay as the Wheel stalls. By the time that Raziel is revived centuries after the game's opening cinematic, Nosgoth is on the brink of collapse, little more than a wasteland wracked with cataclysms and earthquakes.|$|E
5|$|The {{climate of}} Adams {{gives it a}} large amount of {{diversity}} within its forests. On the west side, down in the lower valleys, grand fir and Douglas fir dominate the forest with Western hemlock and Western red cedar as well. On the east side, Douglas fir and ponderosa pine are dominant with some patches of dense lodgepole pine. Western hemlock and Western red cedar also occur, but are limited to creek and river bottoms. Grand fir is present on sites with better moisture retention. At middle elevations on the west side, grand fir is increasingly replaced by Pacific silver fir and noble fir; and on the east side, lodgepole becomes much more prevalent. Above a certain elevation, lodgepole pine also appears in areas on the west side as well. As elevation increases further, the forest changes again with subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, and mountain hemlock becoming the dominant tree species on all sides of the mountain. Eventually, the last trees to disappear from the mountainside are the highly cold tolerant whitebark pine and mountain hemlock. Other conifers, 18 species in all, that play a lesser role than the <b>dominant</b> <b>species</b> are Western white pine, Sitka spruce, Western larch, Pacific yew, Alaska cedar, and mountain juniper. Adams is also home to many hardwoods as well including the tree species big leaf maple, Oregon white oak, quaking aspen, black cottonwood, and red alder. Large shrubs/small trees include the dwarf birch, Suksdorf’s hawthorn, California hazelnut, bitter cherry, vine maple, Douglas maple, and blue elderberry and contribute to a vibrant fall display.|$|E
5|$|The pied currawong {{is common}} in both wet and dry sclerophyll forests, rural and semi-urban environments {{throughout}} eastern Australia, from Cape York Peninsula to western Victoria and Lord Howe Island, where it occurs as an endemic subspecies. In general, the pied currawong is sedentary, although some populations from higher altitudes move to areas of lower elevation in winter. However, evidence for the extent of migration is conflicting, and the species' movements have been little studied to date. It has adapted well to European presence, and has become more common {{in many areas of}} eastern Australia, with surveys in Nanango, Queensland, Barham, New South Wales, Geelong, Victoria, as well as the Northern Tablelands and South West Slopes regions in New South Wales, all showing an increase in population. This increase has been most marked, however, in Sydney and Canberra since the 1940s and 1960s respectively. In both cities, the species had previously been a winter resident only, but now remains year-round and breeds there. They are a <b>dominant</b> <b>species</b> and common inhabitant of Sydney gardens. More recently still, a survey of the population of pied currawongs in southeastern Queensland between 1980 and 2000 had found the species had become more numerous there, including suburban Brisbane. One 1992 survey reported the total number of pied currawongs in Australia had doubled from 3 million birds in the 1960s to 6 million in the early 1990s.|$|E
