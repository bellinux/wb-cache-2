According to the FARC, the capture of Rodrigo Granda in Venezuela in late and the capture of other operatives, such as Simon Trinidad, in Ecuador would allegedly include CIA participation.|$|E
25|$|Within the {{framework}} of the post-Classic cycle of thirteen katuns (the so-called 'Short Count'), some of the Yucatec Books of Chilam Balam present a deluge myth describing the collapse of the sky, the subsequent flood, and the re-establishment of the world and its five world trees upon the cycle's conclusion and resumption. The lightning deity (Bolon Dzacab), the divine carriers of sky and earth (the Bacabs), and the earth crocodile (Itzam Cab Ain) all <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> in this cosmic drama, to which a much earlier, hieroglyphic text from Palenque's Temple XIX seems to allude. The Quichean Popol Vuh does not mention the collapse of the sky and the establishment of the five trees, but focuses instead on a succession of previous mankinds, the last of which was destroyed by a flood.|$|E

25|$|The genome is non-segmented and positive-sense (the {{same sense}} as {{mammalian}} mRNA, being read 5' to 3'). Unlike mammalian mRNA picornaviruses {{do not have}} a 5' cap but a virally encoded protein known as VPg. However, like mammalian mRNA, the genome does have a poly(A) tail at the 3' end. There is an un-translated region (UTR) {{at both ends of the}} picornavirus genome. The 5' UTR is usually longer, being around 500–1200 nucleotides (nt) in length, compared to that of the 3' UTR, which is around 30–650 nt. It is thought that the 5' UTR is important in translation and the 3' in negative strand synthesis; however the 5' end may also <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> in virulence of the virus. The rest of the genome encodes structural proteins at the 5' end and non-structural proteins at the 3' end in a single polyprotein.|$|E
25|$|By some {{definitions}} a protagonist {{must be able}} {{to exist}} in and of himself or herself and that the secondary characters in the work exist only to further the plot for the protagonist. Because Satan does not exist solely for himself, as without God he would not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> in the story, he may not be viewed as the protagonist because of the continual shifts in perspective and relative importance of characters in each book of the work. Satan's existence in the story involves his rebellion against God and his determination to corrupt the beings he creates in order to perpetuate evil so that there can be a discernable balance and justice for both himself and his fallen angels. Therefore, it is more probable that he exists in order to combat God, making his status as the definitive protagonist of the work relative to each book.|$|E

The Justice Department appealed, but in United States v. Wheeler, 254 U.S. 281 (1920), Chief Justice Edward Douglass White wrote for an 8-to-1 majority that the U.S. Constitution did not empower the federal government to enforce the rights of the deportees. Rather, it [...] "necessarily assumed the continued possession by the states of the reserved power to deal with free residence, ingress and egress."

2500|$|The Dictionary was {{exported}} to America. [...] "The American {{adoption of the}} Dictionary was a momentous event not just in its history, but {{in the history of}} lexicography. For Americans {{in the second half of}} the eighteenth century, Johnson was the seminal authority on language, and the subsequent development of American lexicography was coloured by his fame." [...] For American lexicographers the Dictionary was impossible to ignore: [...] "America's two great nineteenth-century lexicographers, Noah Webster and Joseph Emerson Worcester, argued fiercely over Johnson's legacy ... In 1789 [...] declared that 'Great Britain, whose children we are, and whose language we speak, should no longer be our standard; for the taste of her writers is already corrupted, and her language on the decline.'" [...] "Where Webster found fault with Johnson, Joseph Worcester saluted him ... In 1846 he completed his Universal and Critical Dictionary of the English Language. He defended Johnson's work, arguing that 'from the time of its publication, [...] has been, far more than any other, regarded as the standard for the language'." [...] Notwithstanding the evolution of lexicography in America, [...] "The Dictionary has also played its part in the law, especially in the United States. Legislators are much occupied with ascertaining 'first meanings', with trying to secure the literal sense of their predecessors' legislation ... Often it is a matter of historicizing language: to understand a law, you need to understand what its terminology meant to its original architects ... as long as the American Constitution remains intact, Johnson's Dictionary will <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> in American law." ...|$|E

[...] Huckabee added that {{we also need to}} address [...] "the infanticide in our own country, with the slaughter of millions of unborn children." [...] Paul opposed even sending food, and added, [...] "we should direct our attention only to national security, and not get involved for these feel-good reasons of going overseas for the various reasons, and this is the main reason why I think we ought to just come home from every place in the coun-, from every place in the world." [...] Keyes replied, [...] "I have to say I'm appalled by the suggestion that we retreat into some kind of Fortress America, and forget who we are. [...] We are a nation of nations, a people of many peoples. [...] We are in touch with every people {{on the face of the}} earth. [...] If somebody's is being hurt somewhere in the world, somebody in America grieves for them. [...] And I don't believe we can turn our backs on that universal significance, that universal mission... We don't have to send troops, but we need to support and reinforce the sense of local regional responsibility for both humanitarian and military order in that region." ...|$|E
