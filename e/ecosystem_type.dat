25|$|Many facilitative {{interactions}} {{directly affect}} {{the distribution of}} species. As discussed above, transport of plant propagules by animal dispersers can increase colonization rates of more distant sites, which may impact the distribution and population dynamics of the plant species. Facilitation most often affects distribution by simply {{making it possible for}} a species to occur in a site where some environmental stress would otherwise prohibit growth of that species. This is apparent in whole-community facilitation by a foundation species, such as sediment stabilization in cobble beach plant communities by smooth cordgrass. A facilitating species may also help drive the progression from one <b>ecosystem</b> <b>type</b> to another, as mesquite apparently does in the grasslands of the Rio Grande Plains. As a nitrogen-fixing tree, mesquite establishes more readily than other species on nutrient-poor soils, and following establishment, mesquite acts as a nurse plant for seedlings of other species. Thus, mesquite facilitates the dynamic spatial shift from grassland to savanna to woodland across the habitat.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The Sensitive Ecosystems Inventory 2003 – 2004 {{disturbance}} mapping {{project for}} east Vancouver Island and the Gulf Islands, British Columbia, measured {{changes to the}} landscape over approximately a ten-year period. In 1993 – 1997, the Sensitive Ecosystems Inventory mapped seven different natural <b>ecosystem</b> <b>types</b> that {{were considered to be}} rare and sensitive on east Vancouver Island and the Gulf Islands, plus two other <b>ecosystem</b> <b>types</b> that were mapped for general biodiversity and wildlife habitat values. Based on interpretation of air photos, most of which were from 1992, less than 8 % of the landscape was mapped as sensitive ecosystems that were in a relatively natural state. The recent disturbance mapping work evaluated the current (2002) condition of the original mapped polygons by underlaying the spatial data with 2002 orthophotographs. Changes to polygons were noted, and areas that were lost to disturbance or were heavily modified were digitized, allowing calculation of total hectares lost to disturbance throughout the study area since the original inventory. The results of the disturbance mapping project show an alarming trend. Over 1460 ha (4. 5 %) of the area occupied by the seven sensitive <b>ecosystem</b> <b>types</b> in the early 1990 s had been disturbed (and was considered to be no longer representative of the <b>ecosystem</b> <b>types)</b> by 2002.

40|$|Understanding how {{ecological}} {{communities are}} structured {{and how this}} may vary between diff erent <b>types</b> of <b>ecosystems</b> is a fundamental question in ecology. We develop a general framework for quantifying size-structure within and among diff erent <b>ecosystem</b> <b>types</b> (e. g. terrestrial, freshwater or marine), via {{the use of a}} suite of bivariate relationships between organismal size and properties of individuals, populations, assemblages, pair-wise interactions, and network topology. Each of these relationships can be considered a dimension of size-structure, along which real communities lie on a continuous scale. For example, the strength, slope, or elevation of the body mass-versus-abundance or predator size-versus-prey size relationships may vary systematically among <b>ecosystem</b> <b>types.</b> We draw on examples from the literature and suggest new ways to use allometries for comparing among <b>ecosystem</b> <b>types,</b> which we illustrate by applying them to published data. Finally, we discuss how dimensions of size-structure are interconnected and how we could approach this complex hierarchy systematically. We conclude: (1) there are multiple dimensions of size-structure; (2) communities may be size-structured in some of these dimensions, but not necessarily in others; (3) across-system comparisons via rigorous quantitative statistical methods are possible, and (4) insuffi cient data are currently available to illuminate thoroughly the full extent and nature of diff erences in size-structure among <b>ecosystem</b> <b>types...</b>|$|R
