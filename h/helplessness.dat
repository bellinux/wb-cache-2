5|$|Anxious-ambivalent {{attachment}} is also misnamed as 'resistant attachment'. In general, a {{child with}} an anxious-ambivalent pattern of attachment will typically explore little (in the Strange Situation) and is often wary of strangers, even when the parent is present. When the mother departs, the child is often highly distressed. The child is generally ambivalent when she returns. The anxious-ambivalent strategy {{is a response to}} unpredictably responsive caregiving, and the displays of anger (ambivalent resistant) or <b>helplessness</b> (ambivalent passive) towards the caregiver on reunion can be regarded as a conditional strategy for maintaining the availability of the caregiver by preemptively taking control of the interaction.|$|E
5|$|Communication {{partners}} {{may also}} require training to notice and consistently interpret the communication signals of a severely disabled individual, particularly {{because there is}} a danger that learned <b>helplessness</b> can be the result of repeated failure to communicate successfully. Parties may need assistance to avoid the directive communication style that can lead a child user of AAC not to develop a full range of communication skills such as initiating or taking the lead in conversation, using complex syntax, asking questions, making commands or adding new information.|$|E
5|$|The trailer was {{designed}} to be emotional, allowing players to care for the characters and to be distinct from trailers for the game's competitors. The trailer does not show any actual gameplay, instead telling a short story about the game's world and the background behind its events. The development team also had the goal to show the inevitability and the <b>helplessness</b> of a family in a zombie outbreak. Upon its release on February 16, 2011, the trailer sparked public interest, and the community reaction led Techland to adjust the content of the actual game. It was met with a mixed reception from critics. Praise was directed at the trailer's new ideas, story, immersion and tone, however, it received criticism for lacking gameplay information and its depiction of a dead child. The trailer received multiple awards upon release.|$|E
5|$|Finding her mother's body, Buffy {{at first}} denies what she sees, {{to the point}} of imagining {{alternate}} realities. Whedon stated that these mini dream sequences were like documentaries; people who find their loved ones dead are desperate to imagine a different, better outcome, and they create fantasies that cause much more pain when they are forced to return to the harshness of reality. Later in the hospital, Buffy imagines what she {{might have been able to}} do to save Joyce, although the doctor tells her there was nothing to be done. Willow and Xander express anger and <b>helplessness.</b> Anya, new to mortality and human connections, is childlike in her innocence and questions. Xander's anger and Anya's confusion allow them to be mothered somewhat by Willow, who needs to take care of someone. Dawn is deeply in denial, unable to understand that the woman she thought she had known all her life was gone. Tara, who has gone through the ordeal before, represents the acceptance phase, soothing and helping the others to work through what they are experiencing. Buffy toward the end also begins to see acceptance when she tells Dawn that the body in the morgue is not their mother; Joyce is gone.|$|E
5|$|The film {{presents}} {{examples of}} crowd psychology and collective behavior {{which can lead}} to mass hysteria and the loss of social order. The bafflement, outrage, and <b>helplessness</b> associated with the lack of information, combined with new media such as blogs, allow conspiracy theorists like Krumwiede to spread disinformation and fear, which become dangerous contagions themselves. Dr. Cheever must balance the need for full disclosure but avoid a panic and allow the time to characterize and respond to an unknown virus. The movie indirectly critiques the greed, selfishness, and hypocrisy of isolated acts in contemporary culture and the unintended consequences they can have {{in the context of a}} pandemic. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends social distancing by forcibly isolating the healthy to limit the spread of the disease, which stands in stark opposition to contemporary demands for social networking. Responding to the pandemic presents a paradox, as the contagiousness and lethality of the virus instills deep distrust of others but surviving and limiting the spread of the disease also requires individuals to work together.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene when}} Walter {{approaches}} Gus' house {{with plans to}} kill him ends with an extremely high crane shot of Walter standing alone {{in the middle of}} the street. MacLaren wanted that shot to be extremely effective because she believed it conveyed Walter's <b>helplessness,</b> insignificance and lack of experience. Although the normal crane used for such overhead shots in Breaking Bad was only 30 feet tall, MacLaren rented a 180-foot-tall crane specifically for that shot. Since the crew had only about four hours to shoot before losing the night-time hours, the crane shot was the first one they filmed. It was shot by camera operators Andrew Voegeli, with dolly grip David Jaxx Nagro and gaffer Steven Litecky. Later, for the scene when Walter meets with Mike at a bar, MacLaren backlit Walter as he entered so only his silhouette would be visible when he entered. When the shots of Mike punching Walter was originally filmed, the staging involved Mike standing up, then Walter standing up, then Mike suddenly punching him. Vince Gilligan edited the scene to have Mike simply punch Walter instead to make the action faster and more surprising. The scene was arranged by stunt coordinator Al Goto, and actors Bryan Cranston and Jonathan Banks performed the stunts themselves. Mike kicks Walter several times after he falls, and Goto placed a large sandbag against Cranston's torso for Banks to kick during those scenes.|$|E
25|$|As the President of India, I {{had lots}} of {{experiences}} that were full of pain and <b>helplessness.</b> There were occasions when I could do nothing for people and for the nation. These experiences have pained me a lot. They have depressed me a lot. I have agonised because {{of the limitations of}} power. Power and the <b>helplessness</b> surrounding it are a peculiar tragedy, in fact.|$|E

25|$|Early use of augmentative and {{alternative}} communication systems may assist {{the child in}} developing spoken language skills. Overall language delay is associated with problems of intellectual disability, deafness, and learned <b>helplessness.</b> Children with cerebral palsy {{are at risk of}} learned <b>helplessness</b> and becoming passive communicators, initiating little communication. Early intervention with this clientele, and their parents, often targets situations in which children communicate with others so that they learn that they can control people and objects in their environment through this communication, including making choices, decisions, and mistakes.|$|E
25|$|Learned <b>helplessness</b> theory {{posits that}} because human bodies are only alterable {{to a certain}} point, people {{develop a sense of}} body shame and anxiety from which they create a feeling of <b>helplessness</b> in {{relation}} to correcting their physical appearance and <b>helplessness</b> in being able to control the way in which others perceive their appearance. This lack of control often results in depression. In relating to a lack of motivation, objectification theory states that women have less control in relationships and the work environment because they have to depend on the evaluation of another who is typically basing their evaluation on physical appearance. Since the dependence on another's evaluation limits a woman's ability to create her own positive experiences and motivation, it adversely increases her likelihood for depression. Furthermore, sexual victimization may be a cause. Specifically, victimization within the workplace degrades women. Harassment experienced every day wears on a woman, and sometimes results in a state of depression.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} {{symptoms}} and reasons for gambling. Gamblers gamble {{more money to}} try and win back money that they have lost and some gamble to relieve feelings of <b>helplessness</b> and anxiety.|$|E
25|$|Changes in self-perception, such as {{a chronic}} and {{pervasive}} sense of <b>helplessness,</b> paralysis of initiative, shame, guilt, self-blame, a sense of defilement or stigma, {{and a sense of}} being completely different from other human beings.|$|E
25|$|T3 may {{increase}} serotonin in the brain, {{in particular in}} the cerebral cortex, and down-regulate 5HT-2 receptors, based on studies in which T3 reversed learned <b>helplessness</b> in rats and physiological studies of the rat brain.|$|E
25|$|The {{goal of a}} trafficker is to turn a {{human being}} into a slave. To do this, {{perpetrators}} employ tactics {{that can lead to}} the psychological consequence of learned <b>helplessness</b> for the victims, where they sense that they no longer have any autonomy or control over their lives. Traffickers may hold their victims captive, expose them to large amounts of alcohol or use drugs, keep them in isolation, or withhold food or sleep. During this time the victim often begins to feel the onset of depression, guilt and self-blame, anger and rage, and sleep disturbances, PTSD, numbing, and extreme stress. Under these pressures, the victim can fall into the hopeless mental state of learned <b>helplessness.</b>|$|E
25|$|In several {{sections}} Murasaki reveals her {{dissatisfaction with}} court life.

25|$|Resilient {{children}} within classroom environments {{have been}} described as working and playing well and holding high expectations, have often been characterized using constructs such as locus of control, self-esteem, self-efficacy, and autonomy. All of these things work together to prevent the debilitating behaviors that are associated with learned <b>helplessness.</b>|$|E
25|$|People may wear gags for {{a variety}} of reasons. Some people derive erotic {{pleasure}} from a gag, either in a submissive or dominant role. When combined with other physical restraints, the wearing of a gag can increase the wearer's sense of <b>helplessness</b> and anxiety level within a BDSM scene by rendering them unable to speak during sexual activity, which some people enjoy.|$|E
25|$|During {{and after}} the initial investigations, social cliques within high schools were widely discussed. One {{perception}} formed was that both Klebold and Harris had been isolated from their classmates, prompting feelings of <b>helplessness,</b> insecurity, and depression, {{as well as a}} strong need for attention. This concept has been questioned, as both Harris and Klebold had a close circle of friends and a wider informal social group.|$|E
25|$|In {{its final}} form, Guernica is an immense black and white, 3.5 metre (11ft) tall and 7.8 metre (23ft) wide mural painted in oil. The mural {{presents}} {{a scene of}} death, violence, brutality, suffering, and <b>helplessness</b> without portraying their immediate causes. The choice to paint {{in black and white}} contrasts with the intensity of the scene depicted and invokes the immediacy of a newspaper photograph.|$|E
25|$|The war {{brought a}} decline in Ottoman morale {{and a feeling of}} <b>helplessness,</b> {{illustrating}} that modern technology and superior weaponry were {{the most important part of}} a modern army, and a part that the Ottoman Empire was sorely lacking. While fighting alongside the British, French, and even the Piedmontese, the Ottomans could see how far they had fallen behind. Things began to change after the Crimean War.|$|E
25|$|Head harnesses, {{like many}} other forms of bondage, also {{have the effect of}} {{creating}} a sense of objectification and erotic <b>helplessness</b> in the wearer, which can be erotic for the wearer, or for those observing them. Many head harnesses are designed with straps that pass in front of the wearer's eyes, restricting their vision, and further increasing the sense of objectification and erotic subjection.|$|E
25|$|According to this account, {{the subject}} {{attempts}} to breathe deeply and finds herself {{unable to do}} so, creating a sensation of resistance, which the threat-activated vigilance system interprets as an unearthly being sitting on her chest, threatening suffocation. The sensation of entrapment causes a feedback loop when the fear of suffocation increases {{as a result of}} continued <b>helplessness,</b> causing the subject to struggle to end the SP episode.|$|E
25|$|Although {{in itself}} neither {{degenerative}} nor fatal, the chronic pain of fibromyalgia is pervasive and persistent. Most people with fibromyalgia report that their symptoms do not improve over time. An evaluation of 332 consecutive new people with fibromyalgia found that disease-related {{factors such as}} pain and psychological factors such as work status, <b>helplessness,</b> education, and coping ability had an independent and significant relationship to FM symptom severity and function.|$|E
25|$|For those enslaved in {{situations}} of forced labor, learned <b>helplessness</b> can also manifest itself through the trauma of living as a slave. Reports indicate that captivity for the person and financial gain of their owners adds additional psychological trauma. Victims are often cut off from all forms of social connection, as isolation allows the perpetrator to destroy the victim's {{sense of self and}} increase his or her dependence on the perpetrator.|$|E
25|$|The {{short-term}} psychological {{injuries to}} the victims include feelings of fear, <b>helplessness,</b> sadness, disorientation, isolation, vulnerability, and desperation. If left untreated, the psychological effects of sexual assault and rape can be devastating, sometimes even deadly. Causes of death {{as the result of}} sexual violence include suicide and murder. Murder of sexual assault and rape victims may be perpetrated by the rapist or as part of an honor killing by family members of the victim.|$|E
25|$|Lyra's {{original}} surname, Belacqua, is {{the name}} of a character in Dante's Divine Comedy, a soul in the ante-purgatory, representing those who wait until the last opportunity before turning to God. The mood in the ante-purgatory is said to be one of <b>helplessness,</b> nostalgia, and yearning – Belacqua and the other souls in ante-purgatory are caught between two worlds and lack clear understanding of themselves. Whether this has any connection to Lyra, is not known.|$|E
25|$|For these rapists, {{they have}} a sexual {{association}} with anger and power so that aggression and the infliction of pain itself is eroticized. For this rapist, sexual excitement {{is associated with the}} inflicting of pain upon their victim. The offender finds the intentional maltreatment of their victim intensely gratifying and takes pleasure in the victim's torment, pain, anguish, distress, <b>helplessness,</b> and suffering; he/she finds the victim's struggling with him/her to be an erotic experience.|$|E
25|$|As our {{television}} sets show bombers preparing for war against Iraq, we survivors of Guernica and Dresden recall our own <b>helplessness</b> and horror {{when we were}} flung into the inferno of bombing—we saw people killed. Suffocated. Crushed. Incinerated. Mothers trying to protect their children with only their bodies. Old people with no strength left to flee from the flames. These pictures are still alive in our memory, and our accounts capture indelibly what we went through.|$|E
25|$|Deinstitutionalisation (or deinstitutionalization) is {{the process}} of {{replacing}} long-stay psychiatric hospitals with less isolated community mental health services for those diagnosed with a mental disorder or developmental disability. Deinstitutionalisation works in two ways: the first focuses on reducing the population size of mental institutions by releasing patients, shortening stays, and reducing both admissions and readmission rates; the second focuses on reforming mental hospitals' institutional processes so as to reduce or eliminate reinforcement of dependency, hopelessness, learned <b>helplessness,</b> and other maladaptive behaviours.|$|E
25|$|A hyper-vigilant state {{created in}} the {{midbrain}} may further contribute to hallucinations. More specifically, the emergency response is activated in the brain when individuals wake up paralyzed and feel vulnerable to attack. This <b>helplessness</b> can intensify {{the effects of the}} threat response well above the level typical of normal dreams, which could explain why such visions during sleep paralysis are so vivid. The threat-activated vigilance system is a protective mechanism that differentiates between dangerous situations and determines whether the fear response is appropriate.|$|E
25|$|Explanations for {{the delayed}} {{presentation}} {{among women in}} Ghana have been traced to the cost of, and access to, and routine screening mammography. Furthermore, women with breast cancer in Ghana describe a feeling of hopelessness and <b>helplessness,</b> largely due to their belief in fatalism, which contributes to denial {{as a means of}} coping. Mayo et al. (2003) conclude, however, that lack of awareness may be a more critical variable than fatalism in explaining health care decisions among women in Ghana.|$|E
25|$|The films usually {{involved}} the Gump character, usually called Norman, in a manual occupation {{in which he}} is barely competent and in a junior position to a straight man, often played by Edward Chapman (as Mr Grimsdale) or Jerry Desmonde. They benefited from Wisdom's capacity for physical slapstick comedy and his skill at creating a sense of the character's <b>helplessness.</b> The series often contained a romantic subplot; the Gump's inevitable awkwardness with women is a characteristic shared with the earlier Formby vehicles. His innocent incompetence still made him endearing to the heroine.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} manage the deportation, the Italian Ministry of the Colonies hired many people, {{including}} Zerai Deres as a translator for Ethiopian nobles deported to Italy.

Year Essay|publisher=Department of History, Haile Selassie University|location=Asmara|year=1976}} During his stay in the Italian capital, Zerai closely followed the events of the colonial war with a growing sense of anger and <b>helplessness</b> in the face of news coming from Ethiopia, and translated for the Abyssinian Ras the news reported by the Italian press.|$|E
