5|$|On the December 16, 2010 {{episode of}} Stossel titled “Skeptic or Believer,” Stossel {{identified}} himself as an agnostic, explaining that although he had no belief in God, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> God was an impossibility.|$|E
5|$|Although Johnson was {{friends with}} actors such as David Garrick who had {{performed}} Shakespeare onstage, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> that performance was {{vital to the}} plays, nor did he ever acknowledge {{the presence of an}} audience as a factor in the reception of the work. Instead, Johnson believed that the reader of Shakespeare was the true audience of the play.|$|E
5|$|Cynthia Lennon {{personally}} {{believed that}} Mardas invented {{the story about}} sexual impropriety to undermine the Maharishi's influence on the Beatles, as Mardas was always jealous of anyone having Lennon's attention. Harrison and McCartney later offered their apologies to the Maharishi (McCartney said that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> the accusation at all). In 2010, Mardas issued a statement denying that he had spread rumours.|$|E
50|$|In {{the spring}} of 2003, Thorkild Grosbøll {{published}} the book En Sten i Skoen (A Stone in the Shoe), resulting in very limited reactions, though he wrote in it that <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> in God. On May 23, 2003, the Danish newspaper Weekendavisen published an interview with Grosbøll, in which he repeated statements from his book, in particular that <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> in a creating or upholding God.|$|R
60|$|I 'asten to {{tell him}} all, and plead with him to be decent old buck. <b>He</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe.</b>|$|R
60|$|Why should I {{be angry}} with Flush? <b>He</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> in Ossian. Oh, I assure you he doesn't.|$|R
5|$|The Aurora {{returned}} to Cape Denison the following summer, in mid-December, {{to take the}} men home. The delay may have saved Mawson's life; he later told Phillip Law, then-director of Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions (ANARE), that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> he could have survived the sea journey so soon after his ordeal.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the custom}} had {{no basis in}} law and {{frequently}} resulted in prosecution, particularly from the mid-19th century onwards, {{the attitude of the}} authorities was equivocal. At least one early 19th-century magistrate is on record as stating that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> he had the right to prevent wife sales, and there were cases of local Poor Law Commissioners forcing husbands to sell their wives, rather than having to maintain the family in workhouses.|$|E
5|$|Bolt {{announced}} that he would double-up with the 100 metres and 200 metres events at the Beijing Summer Olympics, and the new 100 m world-record holder was the favourite to win both. Michael Johnson, the 200 m and 400 m record holder, personally backed the sprinter, saying that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> that a lack of experience would work against him. Bolt qualified for the 100 m final with times of 9.92 s and 9.85 s in the quarter-finals and semi-finals, respectively.|$|E
5000|$|Foreman {{refers to}} himself as [...] "a Christian, {{conservative}} Republican." [...] <b>He</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> in {{the separation of church}} and state.|$|R
5000|$|<b>He</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> Claudia has a {{reasonable}} motive to kill him, and instead works {{with her to}} remove the other threats.|$|R
50|$|El Meswy <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> in frontiers, flags or boundaries. <b>He</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> in {{race as a}} concept; he {{believes}} in unity, diversity and respect.|$|R
5|$|IRS {{officers}} raided Bell's home on April 1, 1997. He {{was arrested}} in May of that year, and, in July, {{he pleaded guilty to}} charges of obstruction of IRS agents and the use of a false Social Security number (officials alleged that he had used four such numbers since 1984 in order to conceal his assets; Bell said that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> anyone had a right to know his real Social Security number).|$|E
5|$|In 1990, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney {{attempted}} {{to pass the}} Meech Lake Accord, a series of constitutional amendments to persuade Quebec to endorse the Canada Act 1982. Unanimous support in the legislature was needed to bypass public consultation. Manitoba politician Elijah Harper, a Cree, opposed because <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> First Nations had been adequately involved in the Accord's process, and thus the Accord failed.|$|E
5|$|Secretariat {{members who}} had {{supported}} Shachtman were expelled by the emergency conference, {{with the support of}} Trotsky himself. While leader of the SWP James P. Cannon later said that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> the split to be definitive and final, the two groups did not reunite. A new International Executive Committee was appointed, which came under the increasing influence of the Socialist Workers Party.|$|E
60|$|MRS. ARBUTHNOT. It is {{not what}} Lord Illingworth <b>believes,</b> or what <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe,</b> that makes him bad. It is what he is.|$|R
50|$|Day is a {{supporter}} of the Monarchy of Australia. <b>He</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> in anthropogenic climate change and opposes policies to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide.|$|R
50|$|However, the Mufti still {{rejects the}} death penalty for {{apostasy}}. In 2009, posted on his website that <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> that apostasy is punishable by death.|$|R
5|$|The theatre reputedly {{fell into}} {{disrepair}} under the Brars. In 1998, the Princess was called “an absolutely lousy advertisement for late 20th century privatization” by Magic Lantern Theatre’s Rick Ostapchuk, {{who said that}} the current owners had allowed the theatre to sink “with the velocity, if not the sanitized H20, of a waterslide”. By his count, 170 of the marquee’s 330 lights were burnt out, and <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> the interior had been regularly washed or maintained.|$|E
5|$|According to Znaniecki, {{sociology}} can {{be divided}} into the study of four dynamic social systems: social action theory, social relation theory, social actors theory, and social groups theory. Znaniecki saw social actions as the foundation of a society, as they give rise to more complex social relations, and he saw this theory as the foundation of all the others. Unlike Max Weber, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> that everything can be reduced to social actions; he was also quite skeptical of any insights coming from the science of psychology, which he held in low esteem.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the title}} has {{religious}} connotations, Bacon's personal outlook was bleak; as an atheist <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> in either divine intervention nor an afterlife. As such, this work—through the inevitable {{fate of the}} prey—seems to represent a nihilistic and hopeless view of the human condition. Bacon later dismissed the painting, considering it too literal and explicit. He abandoned {{the theme of the}} crucifixion for the following 12 years, not returning to it until the more loosely based, but equally bleak, triptych Three Studies for a Crucifixion.|$|E
5000|$|Ning Choi Kwan's {{academic}} {{teacher who}} belittles him. When <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> Choi Kwan {{is capable of}} writing his own name Choi Kwan beats him up.|$|R
5000|$|Young {{has stated}} that <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> in climate changes and {{believes}} the idea of global warming is [...] "the biggest scam since the Teapot Dome." ...|$|R
50|$|On February 25, 2013, Patrick Foye, the Executive Director of the Port Authority, said <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> Chairman Samson has moral {{authority}} {{to run the}} Port Authority.|$|R
5|$|Because Kant viewed {{rationality}} as {{the basis}} for being a moral patient—one due moral consideration—he believed that animals have no moral rights. Animals, according to Kant, are not rational, thus one cannot behave immorally towards them. Although <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> we have any duties towards animals, Kant did believe being cruel to them was wrong because our behaviour might influence our attitudes toward human beings: if we become accustomed to harming animals, then we are more likely to see harming humans as acceptable.|$|E
5|$|Bohr {{was aware}} of the {{possibility}} of using uranium-235 to construct an atomic bomb, referring to it in lectures in Britain and Denmark shortly before and after the war started, but <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> that it was technically feasible to extract a sufficient quantity of uranium-235. In September 1941, Heisenberg, who had become head of the German nuclear energy project, visited Bohr in Copenhagen. During this meeting the two men took a private moment outside, the content of which has caused much speculation, as both gave differing accounts.|$|E
5|$|Brynn {{drove to}} the home of her friend Ron Douglas and confessed to the killing, but {{initially}} <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> her. The pair drove back to the house in separate cars, and Brynn called another friend and confessed a second time. Upon seeing Hartman's body, Douglas called 911 at 6:20a.m. Police subsequently arrived and escorted Douglas and the Hartmans' two children from the premises, by which time Brynn had locked herself in the bedroom and committed suicide by shooting herself in the mouth.|$|E
50|$|On April 20, 2017 Labrador said <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> {{healthcare}} {{is a human}} right. Labrador stated afterwards that he {{was talking}} about it not being in the constitution.|$|R
2500|$|<b>He</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> {{that the}} United States' [...] "current {{position}} in the world is analogous to that of an Imperial power, as we have come to understand imperial powers".|$|R
50|$|Furthermore, {{he argues}} that <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> that Story of the Eye is {{necessarily}} a pornographic narrative, given that these structuring chains of metaphors do provide coherent underpinning sequences.|$|R
5|$|Hughes {{countered that}} <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> {{the wording of}} the 1957 {{document}} gave Rhodesia the right to devise its own representation overseas without first gaining assent from Britain. The Reedman appointment would probably be seen internationally as a major rise in Rhodesian diplomatic profile, he said, and might damage Britain's reputation, which would in turn make the ongoing negotiations for independence more difficult for both sides. He repeated Bottomley's previous offer of a consul on the British Embassy staff, adding that the official would not have to be physically located within the embassy, and could set up his own office elsewhere so long as he remained nominally affiliated to it.|$|E
5|$|In the Senate, Stevenson was a {{conservative}} stalwart, steadfastly opposing spending on internal improvements {{and maintaining a}} strict constructionist view of the constitution. He urged his fellow senators to oppose the Civil Rights Act of 1871, claiming that its provision that the president could suspend the right of habeas corpus in cases where he believed violence was imminent amounted to giving the chief executive the powers of a dictator. He also opposed the appropriation of federal money to fund the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, because <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> Congress was given the authority to make such an allocation under the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{worrying}} about a possible Austrian threat, Frederick scattered his men facing eastward, the last known location of Daun's army. The troops created an S-shaped line, north to south, adjacent to Hochkirch. The weak (west) side was guarded by an outpost of nine battalions with artillery support; the principal purpose of the infantry was to maintain contact with a deployed scout unit. Eleven battalions and 28 squadrons guarded the east side. Frederick had his best soldiers garrison the village of Hochkirch. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> any attack would occur; Daun's army had been dormant in recent months, refusing {{to be drawn into}} battles.|$|E
50|$|Goldenberg {{has said}} {{on his show}} that <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> in ESP or psychic powers, but he is an expert of mentalism, {{comparable}} to the English entertainer Derren Brown.|$|R
5000|$|He {{supports}} {{same-sex marriages}} and stated [...] "there's {{no reason to}} discriminate against gay people." [...] <b>He</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> religious leaders should be mandated to perform same-sex wedding ceremonies.|$|R
