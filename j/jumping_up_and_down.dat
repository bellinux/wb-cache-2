25|$|Fancher {{states that}} radical hermeneutics, {{which is similar}} to but {{different}} from ontological hermeneutics, may end up being a kind of Trojan horse for psychotherapy because its emphasis on subjective narrative and deconstruction can lend itself to a dangerous relativism. He likens it to a small boy <b>jumping</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> on the diving board of an empty pool: what starts out in innocence is likely to end up in disaster.|$|E

One hour later Beyoncé recorded [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] and two other songs. Smith recalled that Beyoncé focused solely on the recording, ignoring hunger as she worked into the night.

We couldn't play music on the street so I was wearing an ear piece with my track playing. Loads of people were stopping and looking at me like I'd lost it, <b>jumping</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> to what they thought was no music playing! Gotta do what you gotta do! Everyone worked so hard in getting the video together considering the conditions, I was really grateful! ...|$|E
500|$|Results May Vary was {{released}} on September 23, 2003, and received largely unfavorable reviews. Allmusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine panned the album, writing, [...] "the music has no melody, hooks, or energy, [...] all {{attention is focused on}} the clown <b>jumping</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> and screaming in front, and long before the record is over, you're left wondering, how the hell did he ever get to put this mess out?" [...] The Guardian reviewer Caroline Sullivan wrote, [...] "At least Limp Bizkit can't be accused of festering in the rap-rock ghetto [...] But Durst's problems are ever-present – and does anybody still care?" [...] Despite criticisms of the album, it was a commercial success, peaking at No.3 on the Billboard 200.|$|E

[...] Coach Price responded by saying [...] "Roy, get up and go back out there — the game is only half over." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} of Results May Vary was mainly negative. The album received [...] "generally unfavorable reviews" [...] on Metacritic, {{with a score}} of 33 out of 100. This is the second lowest score on Metacritic, above only Kevin Federline's album Playing with Fire. According to AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine, [...] "the music has no melody, hooks, or energy, [...] all {{attention is focused on}} the clown <b>jumping</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> and screaming in front, and long before the record is over, you're left wondering, how the hell did he ever get to put this mess out?". In a review of Limp Bizkit's Greatest Hitz compilation, Erlewine called [...] "Behind Blue Eyes" [...] the worst in the band's [...] "never-ending series of embarrassing covers". Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian wrote, [...] "Durst's problems are ever-present - and does anybody still care?". Stylus criticized Results May Vary, calling it [...] "an album that {{can only be described as}} abysmal". Rob O'Connor of Yahoo! Launch also criticized Results May Vary: [...] "No, Fred, the results don't vary. The results are consistent throughout your new album—consistently crappy." [...] Kitty Empire of The Guardian wrote, [...] "Limp Bizkit have decided to expose their tender side. They really shouldn't have bothered [...] having seen Limp Bizkit's 'other side', you want the old, unapologetic, meathead version back". Scott Mervis of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette also criticized Results May Vary: [...] "Results May Vary has a few highlights — 'Almost Over' (very Everlast) and 'Phenomenon' (very Primus) — but way too few to justify all the time and energy spent".|$|E
500|$|American {{recording}} artist Kanye West {{also contributed to}} three tracks on the album; Madonna called him [...] "the black Madonna" [...] and said, [...] "We're comrades in the envelope-pushing genre". Madonna said, [...] "It's {{a little bit of}} a bullfight, but we take turns. He knows that he's walking into a room with a person with a strong point of view, and I do, too. I listen to what he has to say, take it in, and he listens to what I say and takes it in. We didn't agree on everything, but he has good ideas." [...] She told Rolling Stone that of the songs she played him, West connected the most with [...] "Illuminati" [...] and that, [...] "e loved the melody, and he was actually <b>jumping</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> on the soundboard. He literally stood on top of the mixing board—we were worried he was going to hit his head on the ceiling, but he didn't. He ended up being very excited about that track, and then he added his spin to it, musically, and I love it. To me, he elevated the lyrics with the music. It's like a siren, alerting people." [...] In December 2014, thirteen demos of tracks for the album, including [...] "Illuminati", were leaked to the Internet. To avoid further leaks, Madonna released six completed tracks, including the final version of [...] "Illuminati" [...] with the addition of West's writing and production, with the pre-order for the album on the iTunes Store on December 20, 2014, as an [...] "early Christmas gift".|$|E

30|$|We analyze {{solutions}} using fast-slow analysis. The {{basic idea}} is that the solutionevolves on two different time scales: During the <b>jumps</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down,</b> thesolution evolves on a fast time scale, while during the silent and activephases, the solution evolves on a slow time scale. The fast-slow analysis allows usto derive reduced equations that determine the evolution of the solution during eachof these phases. In particular, we derive explicit formulas for the times when eachcell <b>jumps</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> use these to determine the outcomes of the races tothreshold, depending on parameters and initial conditions. To derive these formulas,we will make some simplifying assumptions on the equations; in situations in whichsuch formulas cannot be obtained, then a similar analysis can be donenumerically.|$|R
