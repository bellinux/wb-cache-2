40|$|OBJETIVO: Classificar a dor {{abdominal}} crônica em crianças e adolescentes por meio dos critérios de Roma II e definir o desfecho diagnóstico em três anos de seguimento. MÉTODOS: Durante um ano, 71 pacientes com dor abdominal crônica foram atendidos como casos novos num ambulatório terciário de gastroenterologia pediátrica. Causas orgânicas foram excluídas por bases clínicas e laboratoriais, e relatos clínicos foram avaliados especificamente quanto à possibilidade de preencherem os Critérios de Roma II para dor abdominal em crianças. Para estabelecer o diagnóstico definitivo, os pacientes foram seguidos por três anos, em média. RESULTADOS: A alocação dos 71 pacientes segundo Roma II foi: doença orgânica (n= 12), remissão dos sintomas após a primeira consulta (n= 7), ou preencheram os critérios para dor funcional (n= 52). Dos 12 pacientes de doença orgânica, nove foram diagnosticados como intolerantes à lactose, mas foram re-alocados para doença funcional no seguimento, visto que a dieta de isenção não aliviou a queixa. Dos 52 pacientes com doença funcional (idade mediana= 9, 3 anos, 50 % meninos), nove, que inicialmente preencheram o critério para dor abdominal funcional, foram re-alocados no diagnóstico de constipação funcional e 43 mantiveram o diagnóstico funcional: 24 com dispepsia funcional, 18 com dor abdominal funcional e um com síndrome do intestino irritável. CONCLUSÕES: Dentre os casos de dor abdominal crônica, a dor do tipo funcional foi mais comum que as causas orgânicas e, dentre os seus subgrupos, a dispepsia funcional foi mais freqüente. O seguimento em longo prazo permitiu estabelecer o diagnóstico definitivo da origem da dor abdominal nessas crianças. OBJECTIVE: To classify chronic {{abdominal pain}} {{in children and}} adolescents, according to Rome II criteria and to define diagnosis outcome in a three-year follow-up period. METHODS: During one year, 71 consecutive new patients with abdominal pain were seen in a tertiary pediatric gastroenterology outclinic. Organic diseases were excluded by physical examination and laboratory procedures, and clinical complaints were evaluated according to Rome II criteria for children abdominal pain. In order to establish definitive diagnosis, patients were followed for a mean of three years. RESULTS: Allocation of the 71 patients was: organic disease (n= 12), complete remission of symptoms following first clinical presentation (n= 7), and <b>functional</b> <b>disease</b> (n= 52). Nine patients from the organic disease group, who had been diagnosed as having lactose intolerance, were re-allocated to the <b>functional</b> <b>disease</b> criteria since their symptoms did not relieve when lactose was excluded from their diet. Out of the 52 patients of the <b>functional</b> <b>disease</b> group (median age= 9. 3 years, 50 % boys), nine children with initial diagnosis of functional abdominal pain were re-allocated to functional constipation diagnosis during follow-up, and other 43 patients fulfilled the <b>functional</b> <b>disease</b> diagnosis defined by Rome II: 24 with functional dyspepsia, 18 with functional abdominal pain and one with irritable bowel syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: In {{a group of children}} with chronic abdominal pain, functional diseases were found more frequently than organic diseases, and functional dyspepsia was the commonest subtype.

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the prevalence of}} human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DQ 2 / 8 alleles in Southern Italians with liver and gastrointestinal (GI) diseases outside of celiac disease. METHODS: HLA DQ 2 / 8 status was assessed in 443 patients from three ambulatory gastroenterology clinics in Southern Italy (University of Federico Ⅱ, Naples, Loreto Crispi Hospital, Ruggi D’Aragona Hospital, Salerno). Patients were grouped based on disease status[pre-post transplant liver disease, esophageal/gastric organic and <b>functional</b> <b>diseases,</b> irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) ] and DQ 2 / 8 alleles, which correspond to a celiac disease genetic risk gradient. Subject allele frequencies were compared to healthy Italian controls. RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-six out of four hundred and forty-three (44. 2 %) subjects, median age 56 years and 42. 6 % female, were DQ 2 / 8 positive. When stratifying by disease we found that 86 / 188 (45. 7 %) patients with liver disease were HLA DQ 2 / 8 positive, 39 / 73 (53. 4 %) with <b>functional</b> upper GI <b>diseases</b> and 19 / 41 (46. 3 %) with organic upper GI diseases were positive. Furthermore, 38 / 105 (36. 2 %) patients with IBS and 14 / 36 (38. 9 %) with IBD were HLA DQ 2 / 8 positive (P = 0. 21). Compared to healthy controls those with <b>functional</b> upper GI <b>diseases</b> disorders had a 1. 8 times higher odds of DQ 2 / 8 positivity.
