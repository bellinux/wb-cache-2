2500|$|Historic Hill {{contains}} Bird House, Bird Garden, Sea Lion Sound, Herpetarium, Chain of Lakes, Flight Cage and Cypress Swamp, and Primate House. The Bird House features birds {{as varied}} as bald eagle, rhinoceros hornbill, hyacinth macaw, burrowing owl, toco toucan, Cape thick-knee, golden pheasant, kookaburra, Mariana fruit-dove, king vulture, <b>horned</b> <b>guan,</b> superb starling, tawny frogmouth, and the Guam kingfisher, which is extinct in the wild. The Bird Garden contains outdoor bird enclosures. Sea Lion Sound provides an underwater viewing tunnel of California sea lions and three harbor seals. The herpetarium houses most of the zoo's reptiles and amphibians, including the critically endangered Jamaican iguana, Chinese alligator, McCord's box turtle, Panamanian golden frog, and Arakan forest turtle. Other species include the Komodo dragon, green anaconda, mountain chicken, spotted turtle, false gharial, king cobra, Gila monster, frill-necked lizard, Aldabra giant tortoise, tuatara, reticulated python, tiger salamander, three-toed amphiuma, pancake tortoise, and over two dozen species of pit vipers from around the world. The Chain of Lakes {{is a series of}} small enclosures between the Bird House and the Herpetarium and Primate House, where the zoo's North American river otters and alligator snapping turtles reside. In 1904, the Flight Cage was the largest bird cage ever built, and {{is still one of the}} world's largest free-flight aviaries at [...] long, [...] wide, and [...] high. The Cypress Swamp is dedicated to North American birds found it the cypress swamps of the southern Mississippi River. Among the birds in the aviary are black-crowned night heron, blue-winged teal, bufflehead duck, cattle egret, double-crested cormorant, great egret, wood duck, northern bobwhite, roseate spoonbill, snowy egret, and American white ibis. Primate House is home to the zoo's monkeys and lemurs. Species included are Allen's swamp monkey, Coquerel's sifaka, golden-headed lion tamarin, black-and-white colobus monkey, lion-tailed macaque, pygmy marmoset, ring-tailed lemur, and white-faced saki.|$|E

It is home to around 400 species of birds including several rare species such as the <b>horned</b> <b>guan,</b> the quetzal and the azure-rumped tanager. The Palenque National Forest is centered on the archaeological site of the same name and was decreed in 1981. It is located in the municipality of Palenque where the Northern Mountains meet the Gulf Coast Plain. It extends over [...] of tropical rainforest. The Laguna Bélgica Conservation Zone is located in the north west of the state in the municipality of Ocozocoautla. It covers forty-two hectares centered on the Bélgica Lake. The El Zapotal Ecological Center was established in 1980. Nahá – Metzabok is an area in the Lacandon Jungle whose name means [...] "place of the black lord" [...] in Nahuatl. It extends over [...] and in 2010, it was included in the World Network of Biosphere Reserves. Two main communities in the area are called Nahá and Metzabok. They were established in the 1940s, but the oldest communities in the area belong to the Lacandon people. The area has large numbers of wildlife including endangered species such as eagles, quetzals and jaguars.|$|E

The logo, which represents a <b>horned</b> <b>guan,</b> was 'modernized' in 2006, due to the celebration of the 25th anniversary of Pronatura, keeping the <b>horned</b> <b>guan,</b> but giving it a more stylized image.|$|E
2500|$|In general, Chiapas has a humid, {{tropical}} climate. In the north, in {{the area}} bordering Tabasco, near Teapa, rainfall can average more than [...] per year. In the past, natural vegetation at this region was lowland, tall perennial rainforest, but this vegetation has been destroyed almost completely {{to give way to}} agriculture and ranching. Rainfall decreases moving towards the Pacific Ocean, but it is still abundant enough to allow the farming of bananas and many other tropical crops near Tapachula. On the several parallel [...] "sierras" [...] or mountain ranges running along the center of Chiapas, climate can be quite temperate and foggy, allowing the development of cloud forests like those of the Reserva de la Biosfera el Triunfo, home to a handful of resplendent quetzals and <b>horned</b> <b>guans.</b>|$|R
50|$|If {{taken as}} a subfamily, the group also {{includes}} the chachalacas, but the <b>horned</b> <b>guan</b> is excluded and found in its monotypic subfamily.|$|E
50|$|The reserve has 885 species, about 70% of {{all species}} found in Guatemala and Belize, {{including}} threatened birds like the resplendent quetzal (Pharomachrus mocinno), harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja) and <b>horned</b> <b>guan</b> (Oreophasis derbianus).|$|E
50|$|Due {{to ongoing}} habitat loss, small {{population}} size, limited range and hunting in some areas, the <b>horned</b> <b>guan</b> is evaluated as Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It is listed on Appendix I of CITES.|$|E
50|$|The {{only member}} in {{monotypic}} genus Oreophasis, the <b>horned</b> <b>guan</b> is distributed in humid mountain forests of southeast Mexico-(Chiapas) and Guatemala of Central America. It {{is found in}} altitude up to 3,350 metres. Its diet consists mainly of fruits, green leaves and invertebrates. The female usually lays up to two eggs.The <b>horned</b> <b>guan</b> is not a true guan, but merely resembles these birds most in overall shape and color, whereas the horn is more reminiscent of the helmeted curassows. In fact, this species is the only survivor of a very ancient lineage of cracids that has been evolving independently from all other living members of this family for at least 20, possibly as much as 40 million years.|$|E
50|$|Since about 2004, the zoo {{has been}} {{breeding}} the endangered pavón (<b>horned</b> <b>guan).</b> It {{has also been}} active in breeding the Mexican gray wolf, which is currently extinct in the wild, and cares for and breeds several species of macaw, including the scarlet macaw.|$|E
50|$|In {{line with}} the other 3 main {{lineages}} of cracids (chachalacas, true guans, and the <b>horned</b> <b>guan),</b> mt and nDNA sequence data indicates that the curassows diverged from their closest living relatives (probably the guans) at some time during the Oligocene, or c.35-20 mya (Pereira et al. 2002). This data must be considered preliminary until corroborated by material (e.g. fossil) evidence however.|$|E
5000|$|Although it {{does not}} have any really close {{relatives}} among living cracids, the true guans are apparently most distant. Given that the basal relationships of the living cracids are not well resolved, the <b>horned</b> <b>guan</b> is often placed into a distinct subfamily, the Oreophasinae. Alternatively, it might be included in a large Cracinae with curassows and chachalacas (Pereira et al. 2002) ...|$|E
50|$|The guans are {{a number}} of bird genera which make up the largest group in the family Cracidae. They are found mainly in {{northern}} South America, southern Central America, and a few adjacent Caribbean islands. There is also the peculiar <b>horned</b> <b>guan</b> (Oreophasis derbianus) which is not a true guan, but a very distinct and ancient cracid with no close living relatives (Pereira et al. 2002).|$|E
50|$|This {{section is}} home to giant anteaters, agouti, red pandas, Chilean {{flamingo}} peacocks, spider monkeys, Morelet's crocodiles, prairie dogs, southern screamer, tufted capuchins, scarlet macaws, meerkats, African spurred tortoise, kinkajous, blue tegu, hamadryas baboons, trumpeter hornbills, highland guan, gray brocket, African porcupines, rhinoceros hornbills, gray Mexican wolf, Indian pythons, crocodile monitor, savannah monitor, squirrel monkeys, red-handed tamarin, <b>horned</b> <b>guan,</b> patas monkey, big hairy armadillo, great horned owl and black swans.|$|E
50|$|The <b>horned</b> <b>guan</b> (Oreophasis derbianus) is a large, {{approximately}} 85 cm long, turkey-like {{bird with}} glossed black upperparts plumage, red legs, white iris, yellow bill {{and a red}} horn on top of head. The breast and upper belly are white, and its long tail feathers are black with white band near base. Both sexes are similar. The young is duller with smaller horn, and has brown tail and wings.|$|E
50|$|Recent {{research}} has analyzed mt and nDNA sequences, morphological, and biogeographical data {{to study the}} phylogenetic relationships of cracid birds, namely the relationships among the genera (Pereira et al., 2002), {{the relationships between the}} species of curassows (Pereira & Baker, 2004) and between the piping- and wattled guans (Grau et al., 2005). The traditional groups—chachalacas, guans, and curassows—are verified as distinct clades, but the <b>horned</b> <b>guan</b> represents the sole survivor of a very distinct and ancient lineage.|$|E
50|$|The forest forms a vital {{biological}} corridor between North and Central America and has very diverse zoology, lying at the conjunction between the Nearctic and Neotropic ecozones and spanning {{a range of}} montane and lowland habitats.It is home to species that include ocelot, tapir, and puma.Highly threatened species include jaguar, spider monkey, white-lipped peccary, <b>horned</b> <b>guan,</b> quetzal and harpy eagle.There {{are estimated to be}} more than 600 birds species, including great curassow, crested guan and ornate hawk-eagle.Recent herpetological studies have found many new forms, including at least eight endemic reptile and amphibian species.|$|E
5000|$|Atitlán {{is home to}} two {{particularly}} {{rare and}} beautiful birds that are endemic to the cloud forests of this region. The <b>horned</b> <b>guan</b> (Oreophasis derbianus) is a Pleistocene relic of the Cracidae family that persists today only in small fragments of its previous range. Its habitat is limited to cloud forests above approximately 1650 m. This bird {{is the size of}} a turkey and the adult male has a one-inch scarlet-colored [...] "horn" [...] projecting straight up from the top of its head. The Cabanis's or azure-rumped tanager (Tangara cabanisi) is probably the most restricted-range species in the region. It occurs only at mid-elevations within the Sierra Madre del Sur of Chiapas, Mexico and western Guatemala.|$|E
5000|$|Regardless {{of whether}} or not the dish was {{constructed}} in the pre-Hispanic period as it is today, the ancient Mayans would have had access to all of the basic ingredients used in the modern dish. Corn, tomatoes, and chiles were all staples in the Mesoamerican diet. Pumpkin seeds, likewise, were an important part of the Mayan diet. [...] Chicken eggs were unknown to pre-Hispanic Mayans, but several other fowl capable of providing eggs were known and eaten. Turkeys and muscovy ducks were both domesticated, and both produce edible eggs. In addition to that, the Mayans ate non-domesticated fowl including the curassow, crested guan, <b>horned</b> <b>guan,</b> chachalaca, and ocellated turkey, although it is unclear the extent to which edible eggs could have been obtained from these birds. [...] Aside from the eggs of fowl, iguana eggs were also used in Mayan cooking and could conceivably have been used to make this dish.|$|E
50|$|West Indian {{manatees}} were illegally hunted in the Port Honduras area in Belize {{at least}} {{until the end of the}} 1990s. Poachers were suspected to come from Guatemala and Honduras. Manatees were killed for meat, and their bones used for carving trinket and other souvenirs sold in local markets in the Yucatán Peninsula. In 2002, it was estimated that about 40 manatees are killed annually along the eastern Nicaraguan coast and in inland wetlands by poachers and incidental drowning in fishing nets.Other species poached in Central American countries and in the Dominican Republic for being traded alive include Geoffroy's spider monkey, margay, ocelot, great <b>horned</b> <b>guan,</b> crested guan, great curassow, ocellated turkey, great green macaw, Hispaniolan amazon, Hispaniolan parakeet, red-billed toucan, chestnut-mandible toucan, raptors, rosy boa, rattlesnake, Galápagos tortoise, beaded lizard, green iguana, poison dart frogs and freshwater turtles.

40|$|Abstract. —The Cracidae {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{endangered}} and distinctive bird families in the Neotropics, yet the higher relationships among taxa remain uncertain. The molecular phylogeny of its 11 genera was inferred using 10, 678 analyzable sites (5, 412 from seven different mitochondrial segments and 5, 266 sites from four nuclear genes). We performed combinability tests to check conflicts in phyloge-netic signals of separate genes and genomes. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the unrooted tree of ((curassows, <b>horned</b> <b>guan)</b> (guans, chachalacas)) was favored by most data partitions and that different data partitions provided support for different parts of the tree. In particular, the concatenated mito-chondrial DNA (mtDNA) genes resolved shallower nodes, whereas the combined nuclear sequences resolved the basal connections among the major clades of curassows, <b>horned</b> <b>guan,</b> chachalacas, and guans. Therefore, we decided that for the Cracidae all data should be combined for phylogenetic analysis. Maximum parsimony (MP), maximum likelihood (ML), and Bayesian analyses of this large data set produced similar trees. The MP tree indicated that guans are the sister group to (<b>horned</b> <b>guan,</b> (curassows, chachalacas)), whereas the ML and Bayesian analysis recovered a tree where the <b>horned</b> <b>guan</b> is a sister clade to curassows, and these two clades had the chachalacas as a sister group. Parametric bootstrapping showed that alternative trees previously proposed for the cracid gener...|$|E
40|$|The phylogenetic relationships, {{biogeography}} and classification of, and morphobehavioral (M/B) evolution in, gamebirds (Aves: Galliformes) are investigated. In-group taxa (rooted on {{representatives of}} the Anseriformes) include 158 species representing all suprageneric galliform taxa and 65 genera. The characters include 102 M/B attributes and 4452 nucleic acid base pairs from mitochondrial cytochrome b (CYT B), NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 (ND 2), 12 S ribosomal DNA (12 S) and control region (CR), and nuclear ovomucoid intron G (OVO-G). Analysis of the combined character data set yielded a single, completely resolved cladogram that had {{the highest levels of}} jackknife support, which suggests a need for a revised classification for the phasianine galliforms. Adding 102 M/B characters to the combined CYT B and ND 2 partitions (2184 characters) decisively overturns the topology suggested by analysis of the two mtDNA partitions alone, refuting the view that M/B characters should be excluded from phylogenetic analyses because of their relatively small number and putative character state ambiguity. Exclusion of the OVO-G partition (with > 70 % missing data) from the combined data set had no effect on cladistic structure, but slightly lowered jackknife support at several nodes. Exclusion of third positions of codons in an analysis of a CYT B + ND 2 partition resulted in a massive loss of resolution and support, and even failed to recover the monophyly of the Galliformes with jackknife support. A combined analysis of putatively less informative, "non-coding" characters (CYT B/ND 2 third position sites + CR + 12 S + OVO-G sequences) yielded a highly resolved consensus cladogram congruent with the combined-evidence cladogram. Traditionally recognized suprageneric galliform taxa emerging in the combined cladogram are: the families Megapodiidae (megapodes), Cracidae (cracids), Numididae (guineafowls), Odontophoridae (New World quails) and Phasianidae (pheasants, pavonines, partridges, quails, francolins, spurfowls and grouse) and the subfamilies Cracinae (curassows, chachalacas and the <b>horned</b> <b>guan),</b> Penelopinae (remaining guans), Pavoninae sensu lato (peafowls, peacock pheasants and argus pheasants), Tetraoninae (grouse) and Phasianinae (pheasants minus Gallus). The monophyly of some traditional groupings (e. g., the perdicinae: partridges/quails/francolins) is rejected decisively, contrasted by the emergence of other unexpected groupings. The most remarkable phylogenetic results are the placement of endemic African galliforms as sisters to geographically far-distant taxa in Asia and the Americas. Biogeographically, the combined-data cladogram supports the hypothesis that basal lineages of galliforms diverged prior to the Cretaceous/Tertiary (K-T) Event and that the subsequent cladogenesis was influenced by the break-up of Gondwana. The evolution of gamebirds in Africa, Asia and the Americas has a far more complicated historical biogeography than suggested to date. With regard to character evolution: spurs appear to have evolved at least twice within the Galliformes; a relatively large number of tail feathers (≥ 14) at least three times; polygyny at least twice; and sexual dimorphism many times...|$|E
