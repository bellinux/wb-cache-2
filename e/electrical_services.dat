5|$|Otto and its {{precursor}} disturbance brought {{several days}} of rainfall and gusty winds to the Greater Antilles. In St. Lucia, 400 houses were severely flooded or destroyed, access to water was cut off, and power outages were observed. Storm impacts in Saint Kitts and Nevis flooded homes, caused minor beach erosion, topped bridges, washed out roads, and caused severe disruption to <b>electrical</b> <b>services.</b> Throughout the U.S. Virgin Islands, monthly rainfall records were shattered, with 21.52in (546.6mm) in Red Hook. Flooding and landslides on surrounding islands closed roads and highways. Across the British Virgin Islands, the worst flooding in the nation's history—with precipitation amounts up to 24.98in (634.5mm)—overturned cars, damaged drainage pipes and utility lines, and left residents without water. Widespread flooding across Puerto Rico affected at least 295 roads, including at least 14 that were severely damaged, and impacted crops. Landslides and downed utility poles isolated communities, waters supplies were contaminated, and numerous people required rescuing.|$|E
5|$|The cyclone inflicted heavy citrus losses, {{and one-third}} of the trees were uprooted in many groves. Agricultural losses reached $20 million (1949 USD), {{including}} 14 million boxes of fruit. Wind gusts of 75mph (120km/h) affected Clermont, and numerous central Florida communities reported severe damage from the winds. The observation station at Archbold Biological Station reported peak wind gusts of 110mph (175km/h); the town of Sebring reported 125mph (205km/h) gusts, which caused damage to trees and severe structural damage to buildings. Estimations of property damage reached $100,000 (1949 USD) in the town, and local citrus groves estimated losses near $2,000,000 (1949 USD). Buildings received considerable damage in the Lake Placid area, and telegraph, telephone, rail, and bus services were disrupted. Flooding affected Georgia and the Carolinas, although the rains alleviated drought conditions in Maryland, Pennsylvania, New York, and New England. Charleston, South Carolina reported a wind gust of 80mph (129km/h), and power lines were damaged. In Maryland, damage was minimal, although trees were prostrated and <b>electrical</b> <b>services</b> were down.

25|$|The {{effects of}} soil {{liquefaction}} on {{the built environment}} can be extremely damaging. Buildings whose foundations bear directly on sand which liquefies will experience a sudden loss of support, which will result in drastic and irregular settlement of the building causing structural damage, including cracking of foundations and damage to the building structure itself, or may leave the structure unserviceable afterwards, even without structural damage. Where a thin crust of non-liquefied soil exists between building foundation and liquefied soil, a 'punching shear' type foundation failure may occur. The irregular settlement of ground may also break underground utility lines. The upward pressure applied by the movement of liquefied soil through the crust layer can crack weak foundation slabs and enter buildings through service ducts, and may allow water to damage the building contents and <b>electrical</b> <b>services.</b>|$|E

The 1940 Expo resulted in the demolition of the older nucleus of Belém, the Praça do Império. and the beginning of a phase of monumental constructions which, along with pre-existing historic architecture (such as the Jerónimos Monastery, Belém Tower, and Belém Palace) began to occupy the waterfront. This included the iconic Padrão dos Descobrimentos and the modern Centro Cultural de Belém which helped to promote tourist and cultural exploration of the north margin of the Tagus.|$|E
