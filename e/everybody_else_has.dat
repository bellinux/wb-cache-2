500|$|Vonnegut {{enrolled}} at Shortridge High School in Indianapolis in 1936. While there, he played clarinet {{in the school}} band and became a co-editor (along with [...] Madelyn Pugh) for the Tuesday edition of the school newspaper, The Shortridge Echo. Vonnegut said his tenure with the Echo allowed him to write for a large audience—his fellow students—rather than for a teacher, an experience he said was [...] "fun and easy". [...] "It just turned out that I could write better {{than a lot of}} other people", Vonnegut observed. [...] "Each person has something he can do easily and can't imagine why <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>has</b> so much trouble doing it." ...|$|E
500|$|Voice actress Marcia Mitzman Gaven {{was hired}} to fill in for Roswell's characters, {{including}} Maude in this episode and the earlier episodes of the eleventh season, although the producers decided to kill her off to open up new storylines for the show. Executive producer Mike Scully said it [...] "was a chance for one of our regular characters [...] to face a challenge and grow in a new direction. The idea came up quickly, we all latched on to it, and it just felt right. We didn't want to kill a character {{for the sake of}} killing. We wanted it to have consequences for surviving characters to deal with in future episodes." [...] Roswell returned to The Simpsons in 2002 after reaching a deal with Fox to record her lines from her home in Denver. Since returning, she has voiced Maude in flashbacks and as a ghost. When asked by The Denver Post on how she thought Ned was doing without Maude, she replied: [...] "OK. But Maude was such a vulnerable character. Maude and Lisa and Marge were the only vulnerable characters, really, <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>has</b> an edge. So they [...] discovered that arc was lost, and now {{there are a lot of}} flashbacks with Maude." ...|$|E
2500|$|Weezer {{completed}} the Pinkerton tour in mid-1997 {{and went on}} hiatus. Wilson returned {{to his home in}} Portland, Oregon to work on his side project, the Special Goodness, and Bell worked on his band Space Twins. Sharp left Weezer to complete the follow-up album for his group the Rentals. He said of his departure from Weezer: [...] "I don't really know how to speak on this because I don't know what should be kept private and what should be shared. I certainly have my view of it, as I'm sure <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>has</b> their sort of foggy things. When you have a group that doesn't communicate, you're going to {{have a whole lot of}} different stories." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pray, God, don't quite starve us, and let <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>have</b> indigestion. We don't say it out loud, {{but there}} it is; {{and the spirit of}} it might damp the orange blossoms." ...|$|R
5000|$|Teddy {{has said}} that [...] "Everybody Move It" [...] was {{inspired}} and partly based on personal experience with going out to clubs as a teenager, often ending up in a corner watching <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>having</b> all the fun.|$|R
50|$|Craxi {{was also}} known for never apologising, {{as a matter of}} principle; most Italians {{expected}} an apology after the corrupt system had been exposed. Craxi never apologised, stating he had done nothing that <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>had</b> not been doing, and that he was being unjustly singled out and persecuted.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{as pretty}} well <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>has.</b> The {{trouble is that}} Bau-Oti can't give {{latitude}} or longitude. Says they sailed {{a long way from}} the Gilberts--that's all he knows. I wonder what became of him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know. Probably {{she will}} be too proud at first. But I shall come, whether she asks me or not. If they had {{relations}} or connections, as <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>has,</b> it would be different. But as it is--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Give me joy, Lucy, I'm to have {{a benefit}} next week! <b>Everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>has</b> had one, and I've played for them all, so {{no one seemed to}} begrudge me my turn when dear old Kent {{proposed}} it," [...] said Christie, coming in one night still flushed and excited with the good news.|$|E
60|$|Burgess, {{the captain}} of the Wrykyn team, made no pretence of being a bat. He was the school fast bowler and {{concentrated}} his energies on that department of the game. He sometimes took ten minutes at the wicket after <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>had</b> had an innings, but it was to bowl that he came to the nets.|$|R
60|$|I {{must say}} this, because I don't think I {{ought to have}} asked you to go away, and I want {{you to believe that}} I will keep my promise, or I should feel that you and <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>had</b> a right to condemn me. I was awake all last night, and have a bad {{headache}} this morning. I can't write any more. ANTONIA.|$|R
6000|$|... "GOTHA, THURSDAY, 15th SEPTEMBER. Grand-Duke and Duchess, like <b>everybody</b> <b>else,</b> <b>have</b> {{been much}} {{occupied}} all {{morning with the}} fact, that the Prussian Army [Seidlitz and a regiment or two, nothing more] is actually here; took possession of the Town-Gates and Main Guard this morning,--certain Hungarian-French hussar rabble, hateful to every one in Gotha, having made off in time, rapidly towards Eisenach and the Hills.|$|R
6000|$|... "Huck, it'll be the bulliest {{thing that}} ever {{happened}} if we find the body after <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>has</b> quit looking, and then go ahead and hunt up the murderer. It won't only be an honor to us, but it'll be an honor to Uncle Silas because it was us that done it. It'll set him up again, you see if it don't." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Mitchy," [...] said Mrs. Brookenham, [...] "what do YOU {{know about}} 'trouble'--either poor Nanda's or mine or anybody's else? You've {{never had to}} take any in your life, you're the spoiled child of fortune and you skim {{over the surface of}} things in a way that seems often to {{represent}} you as supposing <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>has</b> wings. Most other people are sticking fast in their native mud." ...|$|E
60|$|The poorness of {{his play}} was accentuated by the {{brilliance}} of Joe's. Joe combined science and vigour to a remarkable degree. He laid on the wood with a graceful robustness which drew much cheering from the crowd. Beside him Mike was oppressed by that leaden sense of moral inferiority which weighs on {{a man who has}} turned up to dinner in ordinary clothes when <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>has</b> dressed. He felt awkward and conspicuously out of place.|$|E
6000|$|... "Me and Huck's found Jubiter Dunlap's corpse all by {{ourselves}} with a bloodhound, after <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>had</b> quit hunting and given it up; {{and if it}} hadn't a been for us it never WOULD 'a' been found; and he WAS murdered too--they done it with a club or something like that; and I'm going to start in and find the murderer, next, and I bet I'll do it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And if I was," [...] I said, {{avoiding}} a direct reply, [...] "what of it? Though it is hidden from <b>everybody</b> <b>else,</b> he <b>has</b> only {{to draw the}} curtain and see--you." ...|$|R
40|$|A {{typical day}} {{for women in}} rural Nepal is like this: In Nepal you are only getting two meals a day, at 10 a. m. and 7 p. m. Both meals consist of rice with a lens soup, and also some vegetables, if available. In between you are served a glas of tea and khadja (a kind of snacks). During all the meals, the woman is eating at the end, when <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>have</b> {{received}} their share...|$|R
60|$|Mara vividly {{remembered the}} scene on the sea-beach, the finding of little Moses and his mother, {{the dream of the}} pale lady that seemed to bring him to her; and not one of the conversations that had transpired before her among {{different}} gossips had been lost on her quiet, listening little ears. These pale, still children that play without making any noise are deep wells into which drop many things which lie long and quietly on the bottom, and come up in after years whole and new, when <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>has</b> forgotten them.|$|E
6000|$|... "You're {{probably}} quite right," [...] said Wally, [...] "but, if so, <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>has</b> {{been wrong}} {{for a good}} many years. It's usually supposed that the gentleman's name was Omar Khayyám. Khayyám, Omar J. Born A.D. 1050, educated privately and at Bagdad University. Represented Persia in the Olympic Games of 1072, winning the sitting high-jump and the egg-and-spoon race. The Khayyáms were quite a well-known family in Bagdad, {{and there was a}} lot of talk when Omar, who was Mrs. Khayyam's pet son, took to drink and writing poetry. They had had it all fixed for him to go into his father's date business." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{should like}} {{to know the answer}} to that question. Japan of my limited view is {{inhabited}} almost entirely by little children whose duty is to prevent their elders from becoming too frivolous. The babies do a little work occasionally, but their parents interfere by petting them. At Yami's hotel the attendance is in the hands of ten-year-olds because <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>has</b> gone out picnicing among the cherry trees. The little imps find time to do a man's work and to scuffle on the staircase between whiles. My special servitor, called [...] "The Bishop" [...] on account of the gravity of his appearance, his blue apron, and gaiters, is the liveliest of the lot, but even his energy cannot account for the Professor's statistics of population....|$|E
5000|$|Fabio Capello, {{who coached}} Savićević at A.C. Milan for four seasons during which their {{relationship}} featured {{no shortage of}} confrontation and antagonism, said: [...] "Without question, Savićević is the player with whom I had the most rows. He hardly trained, he hardly worked. And, {{when he was on}} the pitch, <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>had</b> to work twice as hard to make up for him. But he was an exceptional talent. And we turned him into a superstar".|$|R
60|$|The summer {{departed}} {{with the}} sun, and winter {{came with the}} stars. It grew to be a bitter night in that little hotel, backed up against a precipice that had no visible top to it, but we kept warm, and woke in time {{in the morning to}} find that <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>had</b> left for Gemmi three hours before--so our little plan of helping that German family (principally the old man) over the pass, was a blocked generosity.|$|R
5000|$|Walker told The Dallas Morning News, [...] "I {{felt this}} song {{speaks to the}} listener, it {{definitely}} spoke to me. I've lived that song as well as <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> who <b>has</b> been in love before." ...|$|R
6000|$|So I may say {{it without}} fear of contradiction,--since <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>has</b> seen it,--that, {{up to the present}} time, the {{returned}} soldier is a disappointment. He is not turning out as he ought. According to all the professors of psychology he was to come back bloodthirsty and brutalised, soaked in militarism and talking only of slaughter. In fact, a widespread movement had sprung up, warmly supported by the business men of the cities, to put him on the land. It was thought that central Nevada or northern Idaho would do nicely for him. At the same time an agitation had been started among the farmers, with the slogan [...] "Back to the city," [...] the idea being that farm life was so rough that it was not fair to ask the returned soldier to share it.|$|E
60|$|The {{attitude}} of the British public, too, was getting on their nerves. They had been prepared for fierce resistance. They had pictured the invasion {{as a series of}} brisk battles--painful perhaps, but exciting. They had anticipated that when they had conquered the country they might meet with the Glare of Hatred as they patrolled the streets. The Supercilious Stare unnerved them. There is nothing so terrible to the highly-strung foreigner as the cold, contemptuous, patronising gaze of the Englishman. It gave the invaders a perpetual feeling of doing the wrong thing. They felt like men who had been found travelling in a first-class carriage with a third-class ticket. They became conscious of the size of their hands and feet. As they marched through the Metropolis they felt their ears growing hot and red. Beneath the chilly stare of the populace they experienced all the sensations {{of a man who has}} come to a strange dinner-party in a tweed suit when <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>has</b> dressed. They felt warm and prickly.|$|E
60|$|There are {{few things}} more {{worrying}} than sitting up for somebody, especially if that somebody be at a party. You cannot help thinking {{how quickly the}} time passes with them, which drags so heavily with you; {{and the more you}} think of this, the more your hopes of their speedy arrival decline. Clocks tick so loud, too, when you are sitting up alone, and you seem as if you had an under-garment of cobwebs on. First, something tickles your right knee, and then the same sensation irritates your left. You have no sooner changed your position, than it comes again in the arms; when you have fidgeted your limbs into all sorts of queer shapes, you have a sudden relapse in the nose, which you rub as if to rub it off--as there is no doubt you would, if you could. Eyes, too, are mere personal inconveniences; and the wick of one candle gets {{an inch and a half}} long, while you are snuffing the other. These, and various other little nervous annoyances, render sitting up for a length of time after <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>has</b> gone to bed, anything but a cheerful amusement.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good boy," [...] said old Deleglise, laying {{his hand}} on my shoulder. We were {{standing}} in the passage. We had just shaken hands with the red-haired man, who, as usual, had been the last to leave. [...] "None of the others will listen to him. He used to stop and confide it all to me after <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>had</b> gone. Sometimes I have dropped asleep, to wake an hour later and find him still talking. He gets it over early now. Good boy!" ...|$|R
6000|$|By pure {{accident}} {{it happened}} to be the first night of the piece, and the author, in response to much shouting and whistling, came before the curtain. He was fat and looked commonplace; but I deemed him a genius, and my mother said he had a good face, and waved her handkerchief wildly; while my father shouted [...] "Bravo!" [...] long after <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>had</b> finished; and people round about muttered [...] "packed house," [...] which I didn't understand at the time, but came to later.|$|R
5000|$|... “This {{just really}} infuriates me because {{apparently}} I {{was one of}} the extreme few that actually cherished my scholarship and went to get the education that <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>had</b> to pay for. I scream {{at the top of my}} lungs every day when some of these guys are screaming for more money, more money, more money. I think it’s absolutely ridiculous, but once again, I think it’s kind of the way our country has gone. We want more, but we want to do less. I think it’s terrible." ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{is another}} very common mistake, {{to suppose that}} Time wanders among old ruins, and sits on {{mouldering}} walls and moss-grown stones, meditating about matters which <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>has</b> forgotten. Some people, perhaps, {{would expect to find}} him at the burial-ground in Broad Street, poring over the half-illegible inscriptions on the tombs of the Higginsons, the Hathornes,--[Not [...] "Hawthorne," [...] as one of the present representatives of the family has seen fit to transmogrify a good old name.]--the Holyokes, the Brownes, the Olivers, the Pickmans, the Pickerings, and other worthies, with whom he kept company of old. Some would look for him on the ridge of Gallows Hill, where, in one of his darkest moods, he and Cotton Mather hung the witches. But they need not seek him there. Time is invariably the first to forget his own deeds, his own history, and his own former associates. His place is in the busiest bustle of the world. If you would meet Time face to face, you have only to promenade in Essex Street, between the hours of twelve and one; and there, among beaux and belles, you will see old Father Time, apparently the gayest of the gay. He walks arm in arm with the young men, talking about balls and theatres, and afternoon rides, and midnight merry-makings; he recommends such and such a fashionable tailor, and sneers at every garment of six months' antiquity; and, generally, before parting, he invites his friends to drink champagne,--a wine in which Time delights, on account of its rapid effervescence. And Time treads lightly beside the fair girls, whispering to them (the old deceiver!) that they are the sweetest angels he ever was acquainted with. He tells them that they have nothing to do but dance and sing, and twine roses in their hair, and gather a train of lovers, and that the world will always be like an illuminated ball-room. And Time goes to the Commercial News-Room, and visits the insurance-offices, and stands at the corner of Essex and St. Peter's Streets, talking with the merchants.|$|E
60|$|It {{is truly}} a terrible stress, this summer problem, and, as I say, my heart aches much more {{for those who have}} to solve it and suffer the {{consequences}} of their choice than for those who have no choice, but must stay the summer through where their work is, and be humbly glad that they have any work to keep them there. I am not meaning now, of course, business men obliged to remain in the city to earn the bread--or, more correctly, the cake--of their families in the country, or even their clerks and bookkeepers, and porters and messengers, but such people as I sometimes catch sight of from the elevated trains (in my reluctant midsummer flights through the city), sweltering in upper rooms over sewing-machines or lap-boards, or stewing in the breathless tenement streets, or driving clangorous trucks, or monotonous cars, or bending over wash-tubs at open windows for breaths of the no-air without. These all get on somehow, {{and at the end of}} the summer they have not to accuse themselves of folly in going to one place rather than another. Their fate is decided for them, and they submit to it; whereas those who decide their fate are always rebelling against it. They it is whom I am truly sorry for, and whom I write of with tears in my ink. Their case is hard, and it will seem all the harder if we consider how foolish they will look and how flat they will feel at the judgment-day, when they are asked about their summer outings. I do not really suppose we shall be held to a very strict account for our pleasures because <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>has</b> not enjoyed them, too; that would be a pity of our lives; and yet there is an old-fashioned compunction which will sometimes visit the heart if we take our pleasures ungraciously, when so many have no pleasures to take. I would suggest, then, to those on whom the curse of choice between pleasures rests, that they should keep in mind those who have chiefly pains to their portion in life.|$|E
5000|$|... "I've lost seventy-eight days, {{almost a}} third of my whole working time, in sick days and certificates. And all because of the children. Everybody copies out their days and so can see what <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>has</b> got. I don’t {{understand}} why I feel so awkward, even ashamed. I shrink, avoid looking at people. Why?

6000|$|... "Because, you foolish boy, it isn't {{the least}} bit in the world necessary. This has been, all through, a comedy of errors. Tragedy enough intermixed; but still a comedy of errors. There never was really any reason on earth why either of us shouldn't have married the other. And the only thing I now regret myself is that I didn't do as I first threatened, and marry you outright, just to show my {{confidence}} in you and Guy, {{at the time when}} <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>had</b> turned most against you." ...|$|R
60|$|To Gudrun, {{there was}} in Loerke the rock-bottom of all life. <b>Everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>had</b> their illusion, must have their illusion, their before and after. But he, with a perfect stoicism, did without any before and after, {{dispensed}} with all illusion. He did not deceive himself in the last issue. In the last issue he cared about nothing, he was troubled about nothing, he made not the slightest attempt to be at one with anything. He existed a pure, unconnected will, stoical and momentaneous. There was only his work.|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed right}} and proper that {{students}} should indulge in dogs; but <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>had</b> them, too--old men and young ones, old women and nice young ladies. If there is one spectacle that is unpleasanter than another, it is that of an elegantly dressed young lady towing a dog by a string. It {{is said to be}} the sign and symbol of blighted love. It seems to me that some other way of advertising it might be devised, which would be just as conspicuous and yet not so trying to the proprieties.|$|R
