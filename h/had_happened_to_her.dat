25|$|When Cardenas {{learned of}} his wife's predicament, he {{recommended}} that she retain Charles Garry, a criminal attorney who had {{gained a reputation}} in Soledad State Penitentiary as the ardent defender of George Jackson, Huey P. Newton, and Bobby Seale. At the same time, news of the case reached the San Francisco Bay Area, where the women's rights and Chicano movements were at their apex. García began speaking to women's groups in the area, and the Inez Garcia Defense Committee raised money for the defense and publicized the case, hoping to put gender inequalities {{in the criminal justice}} system, rather than Garcia herself, on trial. Through her contact with feminist groups, Garcia transformed from the timid, submissive victim who was too ashamed to even admit what <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> into an outspoken critic of patriarchy, even when she saw it in her own judge, who she accused of prejudice and sexism. During the trial, Garry had argued that García had acted with diminished capacity. He based this argument on expert psychological testimony that rape causes mental trauma and García's own history of mental instability. The defense disappointed feminists who preferred to see García as a symbol of strength and resistance to male domination. It also failed to win the sympathy of the jury. García was convicted of second-degree murder, sentenced, and spent two years in the California Institution for Women before her appeal was heard.|$|E
500|$|On 3 July 1985, DCS Topping visited Brady, {{then being}} held at Gartree Prison, Leicestershire, but found him [...] "scornful of any {{suggestion}} that he had confessed to more murders". Police nevertheless decided to resume their search of Saddleworth Moor, once more using the photographs taken by Brady and Hindley to help them identify possible burial sites. Meanwhile, in November 1986 Winnie Johnson, Keith Bennett's mother, {{wrote a letter to}} Hindley begging to know what <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> son, a letter that Hindley seemed to be [...] "genuinely moved" [...] by.

2500|$|At once Jesus {{realized}} that power {{had gone out}} from him. He turned around in the crowd and asked, “Who touched my clothes?” [...] “You see the people crowding against you,” his disciples answered, “and yet you can ask, ‘Who touched me?’ ” But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it.Then the woman, knowing what <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> came and fell at his feet and, trembling with fear, told him the whole truth.

2500|$|According to Ida Görres, [...] "Thérèse {{instantly}} {{understood what}} <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{when she won}} this banal little victory over her sensitivity, which she had borne for so long; ...freedom is found in resolutely looking away from oneself.. {{and the fact that}} a person can cast himself away from himself reveals again that being good, victory is pure grace, a sudden gift..It cannot be coerced, and yet it can be received only by the patiently prepared heart". Biographer Kathryn Harrison: [...] "After all, in the past she had tried to control herself, had tried with all her being and had failed. Grace, alchemy, masochism: through whatever lens we view her transport, Thérèse's night of illumination presented both its power and its danger. It would guide her steps between the mortal and the divine, between living and dying, destruction and apotheosis. It would take her exactly where she intended to go." ...|$|E

2500|$|Chris Haydon of Den of Geek {{argued that}} Amy was [...] "much {{more than the}} {{supposed}} eye candy many journalists unfairly referred to her as, or indeed {{much more than a}} female human to accompany the Gallifreyan Time Lord. She is far more three-dimensional and developed than the pre-existing judgements made her out to be". He also praised Gillan's acting abilities and the way her relationship with Rory helped [...] "render [...] character into something quite special". The Daily Telegraph Michael Hogan considered Amy [...] "the joint best assistant of the rebooted Who era– far superior to Catherine Tate and Freema Agyeman, equally as excellent as Billie Piper". He also praised her relationship with the Doctor, saying that they were [...] "totally believable as best friends". Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times praised Amy for being [...] "cheerfully free...of the emotional baggage that mired her predecessors" [...] and also reacted positively to her attempted seduction of the Doctor. SFX named Amy and Rory the second-best science fiction and fantasy romance. In 2012, leading up to her departure, Martin wrote that Gillan's acting had improved, becoming less of [...] "a rootless collection of personality traits and enunciated sentence peaks" [...] and someone more rounded. He also noted that Amy was unique because so much <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> and she became intwined in the Doctor's life, which allowed the audience to see her [...] "develop and change".|$|E
2500|$|... "The Leander {{paid off}} at Chatham {{after many years}} in China [...] Naturally {{she was in a}} bad state, and the Dockyard {{officers}} reported her as only fit for C Division of the Reserve; that is to say, she required an extensive refit, which meant landing all her stores and stripping her. This was reported to the Controller , and he wired back that the Leander was to be paid off into the A Division, meaning that no repairs were to be taken in hand, and that her name would appear in the list of ships ready for sea at forty-eight hours notice. As this was contrary to Regulations, besides being false, a further report was made to the Admiralty. Fisher replied: 'If the dockyard offers will not do as I tell them, I will replace them by others who will.' The Leander paid off all standing, and I was ordered to keep her defect lists and reports of the survey until the Admiralty should be pleased to order them to be taken in hand. After some months [...] Admiralty orders were received for the Leander to be commissioned by Captain Fegen for the Pacific. We reported that she was unfit to go to sea until refitted. The reply was that the Admiralty orders were to be obeyed. The Leander did commission at Chatham. She got as far as Portsmouth, where Sir Nowel Salmon was Commander-in-Chief, whom Fisher could not bully. the result was that the Leander was detained at Portsmouth to have her necessary defects made good. If anything <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> owing to her unseaworthy state, it would have been scandalous." ...|$|E
