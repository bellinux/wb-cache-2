To achieve the approach, the following issues were covered in this study: impact detecting; signal processing; feature extractioon; impact identification. In impact detection, them smart stuctures, two piezoelectric sensors embedded in {{composite structures}}, are designed to measure impact signals caused by foreign object impact events. The impact signals were stored in computer system memory through the impact monitoring system developed in this study. In signal processing, the cross correlation method was used to process the measured impact signals. This processing built the correlation between the impact signals and location of impacts as well as <b>impact</b> <b>magnitude.</b> In feature extraction, the initial feature data were gained from the cross correlation results through the point and segmentation processing. thie final feature data were selected from the initial feature data with a fuzzy clustering method. In impact identification, the adaptive deuro fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) were built with the feature data to identify abscissas of impact location, ordinates of impact location and <b>impact</b> <b>magnitude.</b> The parameters of the ANFISs were refined with a hybrid learning rule i. e. the combination of the Least Square Estimation and the Steepest Descent algorithm.

Railway stations function as nodes in transport networks and places in an urban environment. They have accessibility and environmental impacts, which contribute to property value.

Generally the variations are attributed to the nature of data, particular spatial characteristics, temporal effects and methodology. The data can vary in relation to the type of property under study. Some indication is found to support the assertion that commercial properties enjoy a higher positive impact compared to residential properties. Commuter railway stations have a consistently higher positive impact on the property value compared to light and heavy railway/Metro stations.

In addition to system specification utilizing four groups of proposed lane traffic variables, a stochastic estimation approach which involves a discrete-time nonlinear stochastic model and an algorithm based on Kalman filtering is developed to estimate real-time delays and queues in the presence of freeway incidents. The proposed method is tested employing simulated data generated via the CORSIM simulation model. The preliminary test results indicate that the proposed method is promising.

It is essential to consider the interaction between UPSH plants and the surrounding geological media. There has been little work on the assessment of associated groundwater flow impacts. The impacts on groundwater flow are determined numerically using a simplified numerical model which is assumed to be representative of open-pit and deep mines. The main impact consists of oscillation of the piezometric head, and its magnitude depends on the characteristics of the aquifer/geological medium, the mine and the pumping and injection intervals. If an average piezometric head is considered, it drops at early times after the start of the UPSH plant activity and then recovers progressively. The most favorable hydrogeological conditions to minimize impacts are evaluated by comparing several scenarios. The <b>impact</b> <b>magnitude</b> will be lower in geological media with low hydraulic diffusivity; however, the parameter that plays the more important role is the volume of water stored in the mine. Its variation modifies considerably the groundwater flow impacts. Finally, the problem is studied analytically and some solutions are proposed to approximate the impacts, allowing a quick screening of favorable locations for future UPSH plants. Peer reviewe...|$|E
