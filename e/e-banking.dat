25|$|While {{financial}} institutions {{took steps to}} implement <b>e-banking</b> services in the mid-1990s, many consumers were hesitant to conduct monetary transactions over the internet. It took widespread adoption of electronic commerce, based on trailblazing companies such as America Online, Amazon.com and eBay, to make the idea of paying for items online widespread. By 2000, 80% of U.S. banks offered <b>e-banking.</b> Customer use grew slowly. At Bank of America, for example, it took 10 years to acquire 2 million <b>e-banking</b> customers. However, a significant cultural change took place after the Y2K scare ended.|$|E

30|$|Although {{content and}} {{structure}} mining {{are important in}} e-commerce development and management, usage mining remains the basic way of monitoring {{the evolution of the}} market, and represents a dynamic reflection of business changes since interactions between businesses and customers cannot necessarily be seen in content and structure mining alone. Usage mining describes inter-page interactions and session streams, and could form a major source of provisions for better services to customers.

30|$|The {{criteria}} for identifying a service as traditional or modern lie in whether this service is produced based upon more advanced technologies and/or more advanced management. For example, banking services and retail services {{are known to}} be both old and traditional services, but today, they are hugely different from what they were a hundred years ago. On one hand, ITs have been pervasively used in these two service sectors, where, for instance, the service providers tend to operate on the foundation of the Internet. So we can often see and utilize <b>e-banks</b> and e-marts. On the other hand, the providers of these services have also introduced new forms of operation. The supermarket is certainly one of the advanced forms of retail services.|$|R

The {{limited number of}} servers, costs of reallocat-ing servers, and unpredictability of requests make server allocation optimization difficult. Based on the many similarities between server and honey bee colony forager allocation, we pro-pose a new decentralized honey bee algorithm which dynamically allocates servers to satisfy request loads. We compare it against an omniscient optimality algorithm, a conventional greedy algorithm, and an algorithm that computes omnisciently the optimal static allocation. We evaluate performance on simulated request streams and commercial trace data. Our algorithm performs better than static or greedy for highly variable request loads, but greedy can outperform it under low variability. Honey bee forager allocation, though suboptimal for static food sources, may possess a counterbalancing responsiveness to food source variability.

30|$|The target {{respondents}} {{in this study}} are users experienced in online financial products. The 2013 Investigation Report on Chinese <b>E-banks</b> indicated that the general age bracket of consumers using online financial products is 20 – 29 years. The target respondents here were concentrated in the age bracket of 18 – 40 years. The research was conducted through snowball sampling. First, relatives and friends of the target personnel were invited to fill in the questionnaire and were asked to forward the questionnaire to their Wechat Moments, from where they could invite their friends and relatives to further pass on the questionnaire. Thus, using this snowballing approach, the sample size continuously expanded, as compared with other sampling techniques. We believe this approach obtains a highly credible response (Biernacki & Waldorf 1981). A total of 202 questionnaires were collected. The {{respondents in}}cluded 117 men (57.92 %) and 85 women (42.08 %); 94.06 % of the respondents were in the 18 – 30 year age bracket; 63.86 % of the respondents frequently used mobile payment (more than once a week). In terms of the preferred investment amount in Yuebao, the largest number, 36.14 %, of the respondents were only willing to invest less than RMB 5000, 27.72 % were willing to invest between RMB 5000 – 10, 000, 25.25 % between RMB 10, 000 – 50, 000, and 10.89 % RMB 50, 000 or above.|$|R
