40|$|According {{to social}} judgeability theory, people rely on naive {{theories}} of judgment {{to make decisions}} about others. Because of limited access to their cognitive processes, perceivers use meta-informational cues to estimate the validity of their judgment and misattribute the origin of their <b>impression.</b> In <b>line</b> with this hypothesis, Yzerbyt, Schadron, Leyens, and Rocher (1994) found that participants who thought that they had subliminally received individuating information felt more entitled to judge and they made polarized judgments. Experiment 1 uses a bogus pipeline procedure to examine the viability of an impression management account of Yzerbyt et al. 's (1994) data, for example, that participants judged only because they thought that they were expected to judge regardless of their private beliefs. In line with a private belief interpretation, the bogus pipeline participants replicated previous results. Moreover, participants also stereotyped the target more in the presence than {{in the absence of the}} bogus pipeline, suggesting the existence of social desirability concerns in the expression of stereotypes. Experiment 2 tested perceivers' sensitivity to judgmental contexts by avoiding any reference to person perception. The results not only replicate the social judgeability pattern but additionally show that the absence of information made participants feel even less inclined to judge in a context that does not stress social judgment so much. As a set, these findings emphasize the role of naive theories in social inference processes, as suggested by social judgeability theory...|$|R

To further emphasize the horizontal of the bricks, the horizontal joints were filled with a cream-colored mortar and the small vertical joints were filled with brick-colored mortar.

Wright used similar designs in tapestries inside the house and for gates surrounding the outdoor spaces and enclosing the garage courtyard. Robie's generous budget allowed Wright to design a house with a largely steel structure, which accounts for the minimal deflection of the eaves.The planter urns, copings, lintels, sills and other exterior trimwork are of Bedford limestone.|$|R

OBJECTIVE: •  To evaluate the perception and performance of urological surgeons when first applying scarless surgical techniques. METHODS: •  The study was conducted during the 2 (nd) Minimally Invasive Urological Surgical Week annual course in Braga, Portugal. •  Fourteen attendees performed three porcine nephrectomies by using each of the following techniques: mini-laparoscopy, laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) -assisted laparoscopy. •  Peri-operative data were recorded, and operating performance was scored by one experienced surgeon for each working station, using a global rating scale. •  The surgeons' subjective perceptions of degree of difficulty were graded and their expectations before the procedures were recorded. RESULTS: •  Forty-two porcine nephrectomies were performed. •  There were no differences in overall operating time, or time to dissect and manage the renal vascular hilum, whereas time to gain access was faster for LESS than for mini-laparoscopy or NOTES-assisted laparoscopy (mean [sd] 8 [6] min vs 10. 2 [5. 3] min vs 9. 9 [5. 3] min, respectively; P= 0. 59). •  A better visualization of the surgical field was obtained with mini-laparoscopy and there was a higher degree of difficulty of bimanual dexterity for LESS, but {{no significant differences were found}} among the three techniques for any variable (operating field view: P= 0. 52; bimanual dexterity: P= 0. 49; efficiency: P= 0. 77; tissue handling: P= 0. 61; autonomy: P= 0. 2). •  Subjective perception of the degree of difficulty trended in favour of mini-laparoscopy (P= 0. 17), but no significant difference was found in terms of surgeons' impression as compared with their expectations (P= 0. 34).

40|$|Grinding/polishing and {{indentation}} induced {{residual stresses}} were measured by confocal Cr 3 + fluorescence microscopy with high spatial resolution (~ 2 μm),obtaining local stress variation information {{rather than the}} mean stress averaged over a large sampling volume as is measured by other techniques. Due to the translucency of alumina materials, {{a substantial portion of}} the fluorescence signal comes from beneath the surface of the specimen. A probe response function (PRF) was developed taking account of microscope resolution, refraction, absorption and scattering, to quantitatively describe where the collected signal came from. It described the fluorescence intensity variations against defocus distance very well for a range of materials including sapphire, ruby, polycrystalline alumina and AI 2 O 3 /SiC nanocomposites. Large variations in the residual stresses on ground and polished surfaces were observed, owing to the surface fracture and pullouts. The broad peaks and narrow peaks separated from the spectra collected near the ground/polished surfaces physically represented the two distinct regions in the ground region: a plastically deformed surface layer and the elastically deformed material underneath. A model for the residual stress field taking into account the pullout was proposed using an array of virtual dislocations. The model agreed with the experimental results well when the PRF was included. Tensile stresses were detected on the ground surfaces of polycrystalline aluminas and 2 vol. % SiC nanocomposite, but not on the polished surfaces of polycrystalline aluminas or ground surfaces of 5 and 10 vol. % SiC nanocomposites. This was explained in terms of difference in the amount of pullouts on the surfaces. The depth of deformation was deeper in the ground polycrystalline alumina compared to the polished condition; the depth of deformation in alumina and the AI 2 O>sub> 3 /SiC nanocomposites were similar (~ 1 μm) while the compressive stresses in the nanocomposites were greater owing to the reduction in pullout. The main difference between ground alumina and AI 2 O 3 /SiC nanocomposites was the brittle fracture behavior rather than the plastic deformation. Line scans and area mapping were carried out on 1 kg loaded Vickers indentations of alumina-based ceramics. Tensile stresses were found at the tips of radial cracks and lateral cracks and compressive stresses were found around the indent <b>impression.</b> The <b>line</b> scan results in the elastic regions agreed qualitatively with Yoffe's model and the quantitative discrepancy was attributed mainly to the cracking that relaxed the stresses. The differences in residual stresses between alumina and AI 2 O 3 /SiC nanocomposites were small if measured with high spatial resolution but it would be exaggerated with lower resolution. </p...|$|R

The reproductions of fine tone details on these films are challenging as the occurrence of graininess and image-noise results in print defect such as print half-tone mottle. The presence of print half-tone mottle is visually disturbing leading to wastage of ink, substrate and time. The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate the effect of gravure process parameters viz. ink viscosity, press speed, <b>impression</b> hardness and <b>line</b> screen and develop statistical model for print half-tone mottle in shrink films. The base line for print half-tone mottle was determined by conducting production runs on press with a defined set of process parameters and the target was set to minimize it from the baseline. The half-tone area was scanned and processed through SFDA algorithm to calculate print half-tone mottle. The design of experiments (DOE) was generated for above-mentioned process parameters and was analysed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) to find the significant factor affecting the print half-tone mottle. The analysis revealed line screen, viscosity and hardness as significant factors in minimizing print half-tone mottle. The results showed minimization of print half-tone mottle by 28 % for both PVC and PET-G films. Furthermore, regression model was developed and validated for print half-tone mottle and a correlation coefficient (R 2) of 0. 8696 and 0. 879 was achieved for PET-G and PVC respectively. The proposed model is helpful in determining the impact of gravure process parameters and prediction of print half-tone mottle in shrink films...|$|R
