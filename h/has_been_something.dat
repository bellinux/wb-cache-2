5|$|Historically, Ashland <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>something</b> of a {{political}} outlier in southwest Oregon. In the presidential election of 1860, Ashland favored Abraham Lincoln while its neighbors strongly preferred pro-slavery candidates. In the early 1900s, Ashland voters supported women's suffrage and prohibition, generally {{out of step with}} the rest of the region. In more recent elections, liberal Ashland has supported tax levies and environmental regulations opposed by voters elsewhere in Jackson and nearby counties. Critics sometimes refer to the city as the People's Republic of Ashland.|$|E
5|$|Iguanodon gives {{its name}} to the unranked clade Iguanodontia, a very populous group of ornithopods with many species known from the Middle Jurassic to the Late Cretaceous. Aside from Iguanodon, the best-known members of the clade include Dryosaurus, Camptosaurus, Ouranosaurus, and the duck-bills, or hadrosaurs. In older sources, Iguanodontidae was shown as a {{distinct}} family. This family traditionally <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>something</b> of a wastebasket taxon, including ornithopods that were neither hypsilophodontids or hadrosaurids. In practice, animals like Callovosaurus, Camptosaurus, Craspedodon, Kangnasaurus, Mochlodon, Muttaburrasaurus, Ouranosaurus, and Probactrosaurus were usually assigned to this family.|$|E
5|$|Job Maarse, artistic {{director}} of Pentatone, said of the album's origins: From day one the co-operation between Pentatone and the Oregon Symphony and its Music Director Carlos Kalmar <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>something</b> magical. The quality of the orchestra and the program ideas of Carlos Kalmar {{attracted the attention of}} a large group of music lovers in and outside the U.S. During a pleasant meeting at the Chicago airport almost two years ago the idea for this new album was discussed. I believe all at the table liked it and now everybody can hear how these three pieces, although by composers with different styles, fit perfectly in one program. And of course the Copland symphony {{is one of the best}} pieces ever written by an American composer.|$|E

25|$|In recent years, there <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>something</b> of {{a revival}} in Danish theatre. Many new playwrights and {{producers}} have appeared including Astrid Saalbach (born 1955), {{winner of the}} Nordic Drama Award in 2004, and Peter Asmussen (born 1957), who wrote the film script for Lars von Trier's Breaking the Waves. Danish musicals have also been a particularly successful feature of the modern theatre. Knud Christensen, commonly known as Sebastian, was particularly successful with Cyrano (1992), based on Rostand’s play and Klokkeren fra Notre Dame (The Hunchback of Notre Dame) (2001). Bent Fabricius-Bjerre's musical Matador (2007) {{is based on a}} successful TV series of the same name.|$|E
500|$|Adelson's {{decision}} to self-censor his website caused an unintended backlash from the Digg {{community in the}} form of the Streisand effect. [...] "In trying to make the cracked issue go away", notes Jeremy Goldman in his 2012 book Going Social, [...] "the AACS's letter (and Digg's response) succeeded only in making the story bigger." [...] Digg users made sure, by their votes and online participation, that all front-page stories on Digg were about the encryption key. Digg founder Kevin Rose observed: [...] "The Digg community is one that loves to have their voice heard, and this <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>something</b> that struck a chord with them.|$|E
500|$|Russell {{refused to}} attend the {{ceremony}} when his #6 jersey was retired in 1972, or his induction into the Hall of Fame in 1975. While Russell still has sore feelings towards the city, there <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>something</b> of a reconciliation; and he has even visited the city regularly in recent years, something he never did {{in the years immediately}} after his retirement. When Russell originally retired, he demanded that his jersey be retired in an empty Boston Garden. In 1995, the Celtics left Boston Garden and entered the FleetCenter, now the TD Garden, and as the main festive act, the Boston organization wanted to re-retire Russell's jersey in front of a sellout audience. Perennially wary of what he long perceived as the racist city of Boston, Russell decided to make amends and gave his approval. On May 6, 1999, the Celtics re-retired Russell's jersey in a ceremony attended by his on-court rival (and friend) Chamberlain, along with Celtics legend Larry Bird and Hall of Famer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. The crowd gave Russell a prolonged standing ovation, which brought tears to his eyes. He thanked Chamberlain for taking him to the limit and [...] "making [...] a better player" [...] and the crowd for [...] "allowing [...] {{to be a part of}} their lives." [...] In December 2008, the We Are Boston Leadership Award was presented to Russell.|$|E

However, for many centuries since the exile of the Jewish people from the Land of Israel, tzitzit have been worn without a techelet fringe, though in the last hundred years there <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>something</b> of a comeback.|$|E
2500|$|Half of the Yamna {{component}} {{is derived from}} a Caucasus hunter-gatherer strand (Satsurblia). On November 16, 2015, in {{a study published in}} the journal Nature Communications, geneticists announced that they had found a new fourth ancestral [...] "tribe" [...] or [...] "strand" [...] which had contributed to the modern European gene pool. They analysed genomes from two hunter-gatherers from Georgia which were 13,300 and 9,700 years old, and found that these Caucasus hunter-gatherers were probably the source of the farmer-like DNA in the Yamna. According to co-author Dr Andrea Manica of the University of Cambridge: [...] "The question of where the Yamnaya come from <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>something</b> of a mystery up to now....we can now answer that as we've found that their genetic make-up is a mix of Eastern European hunter-gatherers and a population from this pocket of Caucasus hunter-gatherers who weathered much of the last Ice Age in apparent isolation." ...|$|E

6000|$|In {{ten minutes}} the lady appeared. She took the client's chair {{and lifted her}} veil. The same effect which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{produced}} on Mr. Karnegie was once more produced on Mr. Camp. For the first time, for many a long year past, he felt personally interested in a total stranger. It might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>something</b> in her eyes, or it might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>something</b> in her manner. Whatever it was, it took softly hold of him, and made him, to his own exceeding surprise, unmistakably anxious to hear {{what she had to}} say! ...|$|R
