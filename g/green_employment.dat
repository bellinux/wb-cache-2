40|$|To analyze {{economic}} {{viability of the}} biogas plants in Bangladesh six case studies are carried out in some selected upazilas of greater Sylhet district in Bangladesh where NGOs like Grameen Shakti (GS) and Rural Services Foundation (RSF) are delivering and servicing biogas plants. Economic viability of the biogas plants are measured by comparing prior expenditure (before implementing biogas plant) for firewood, kerosene, and other conventional sources. Economic viability refers to an estimator that not only seeks to maximize the effectiveness of financial viability but also considers environmental externalities. Economic viability for six different cases of biogas plants provides information about relative performance of the product in six different situations. A sensitivity analysis is performed using artificial neural network (ANN) model. Although {{economic viability}} of biogas is sensitive to kerosene price, firewood availability, this study reveals that biogas is economically more attractive when women could render their saved cooking time for other income generating green jobs.

Therefore, solving the problem of youth unemployment is a matter of great concern and requires bringing to the forefront modern employment policies correlated with the economic reality, to which the EU attaches increasingly more importance, namely promoting <b>green</b> <b>employment</b> in a green economy.

40|$|This paper {{builds on}} earlier {{investigations}} of psychiatric asylum closure {{by focusing on}} their not infrequent successor role as educational facilities. We ask two questions: what conditions underpin a transition to educational re-use, and how is former asylum use remembered and memorialised in the successor context? Through recounting and interpreting the histories of acquisition and adaptation at two sites (Carrington, Auckland and Lakeshore, Toronto), we build a narrative that suggests a variable response to the shadows cast by stigma and the vilification of asylum. We distinguish between memorialisation (material reminders on site) and remembrance (narratives of past use). Former asylum sites, we contend, are attractive for educational users for their campus-like settings, range of buildings and (now) suburban locations. For city residents and planners replacing one institutional use with another keeps the site <b>green,</b> brings <b>employment,</b> and retains semi-public access. Memorialisation is often strategically low-key and remembrance more personal and individual. The net result is a relict landscape that speaks to the transcendence of stigma despite the relatively recent demise of the asylum. <br/...|$|R

Through literature studies, we found that the green economy has positive effects on employment in both developing and developed countries, while the results can alter according to the type of measurement adopted. However, the Green economy can also have negative effects in some countries like Spain. Moreover, it may shape the labor market in another way if policy influence is taken into consideration. Finally, we must realize that there are some problems with the current researches in this area, such as the lack of studies on different countries and energy types, inadequate theoretical support, limited analysis of such relationship, and so on. We suggest that scholars should focus on mechanisms whereby this relationship is influenced and policies to regulate such relationships in further researches...|$|R
