500|$|More {{mixed reviews}} were {{critical}} of Diamandis' vocal delivery. Lou Thomas from BBC Music commented that [...] "he consistently diverting changes in style across the album are fine—the wonky 80s shoulder-pad pop of 'The Outsider' {{is nothing like}} anything <b>else</b> <b>here,</b> for example. But over 13 songs of Sparks-voice and many similar staccato piano riffs listeners may feel bludgeoned by Marina and her slightly overbearing presence", concluding that her eccentric vocals would polarise opinions. Sean O'Neal wrote on The A.V. Club that after [...] "dozens of squeaky Regina Spektor-ish enunciations" [...] and [...] "Kate Bush trills", the [...] "overbearing need to prove herself just ends up being exhausting". Joe Rivers of No Ripcord praised [...] "Are You Satisfied?", [...] "Hollywood" [...] and [...] "Oh No!" [...] but was put off by sudden [...] "howling" [...] in [...] "Hermit the Frog" [...] and a [...] "throaty growl" [...] in [...] "The Outsider".|$|E
500|$|Ben Lawrence, {{writing in}} The Daily Telegraph, gave the episode {{four out of}} five stars, saying that it had much to [...] "enthral" [...] a present-day viewer and showed how Doctor Who was {{constantly}} reinventing itself. A similar statement was made by Euan Ferguson of The Observer, who also wrote that the episode was [...] "splendid" [...] with good villains, though he felt that the plot was [...] "insanely complicated" [...] and hard to understand. Digital Spy's Morgan Jeffery also rated [...] "The Bells of Saint John" [...] four stars, feeling that the threat [...] "leaves a little to be desired" [...] and the Spoonheads' physical appearance was not memorable. However, he said that [...] "practically everything <b>else</b> <b>here</b> is wonderful", especially Clara's new characterisation. IGN reviewer Mark Snow rated the episode 8.2 out of 10. He praised the Wi-Fi concept but was underwhelmed by the Spoonheads, and felt that it was more low-key than it was promoted.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, Sheen had a {{supporting}} role in the science fiction sequel [...] Referring to his David Bowie-esque character, Sheen has said, [...] "I was paid to show off basically". The Wall Street Journal found little fun in the movie [...] "except for a gleefully campy turn by Michael Sheen" [...] while The New York Times said he [...] "shows up to deliver {{the closest thing to}} a performance in the movie". The Daily Telegraph felt his [...] "lively hamming as a cane-swishing nightclub owner merely underlines how impersonal—how inhuman—much <b>else</b> <b>here</b> is". However, USA Today felt his [...] "scenery-chewing performance ... is meant as comic relief, but this movie thunders along so seriously that the attempt at humor feels jarring". In other 2010 film work, Sheen provided the voices for characters in Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland and Disney's Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue and appeared as a terrorist in Unthinkable. On television, Sheen's performance in the third instalment of Peter Morgan's Blair trilogy, The Special Relationship, was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor – Miniseries or Movie. The HBO film examined the [...] "special relationship" [...] between the US and the UK in the political era of Blair and Bill Clinton. It was the sixth collaboration between Sheen and Peter Morgan; both parties have since said they will not work together again [...] "for the foreseeable future". Sheen also made a guest appearance in four episodes of NBC's 30 Rock as Wesley Snipes, a love interest for Tina Fey's Liz Lemon. Fey, the sitcom's star and creator, has said that [...] "he was so funny and delightful to work with". In November 2010, Sheen received the BAFTA Britannia Award for British Artist of the Year.|$|E

I never felt like it was my band or that I was really a part of everyone <b>else</b> <b>here</b> ... Right before I joined LED, I started a solo project that I put on the back burner, because things were going well with LED and I ended up getting too busy to focus on it. I kept writing songs for both LED and the solo shit, knowing one day I would have to part ways with LED to fulfill my desire to express myself the way I had always dreamed. I was going to do this sooner and then [...] So I stayed to help get the band back on track and I never leave anything on a negative note.|$|E
2500|$|Although Konni was, for {{the most}} part, allowed to attend {{meetings}} with Putin, on occasion she was kept away from such functions. Rossiyskaya Gazeta recalled an incident in 2003, when journalists travelled to Sochi to discuss various issues with the President. Upon arrival at Bocharov Ruchei, Konni, who was described as cheerful and inquisitive, greeted the journalists. When {{it came time to}} start the meeting, Putin's security detail stopped Konni from following him. As the journalists and Putin started walking down the staircase, Konni rushed towards them and began to bark loudly at Putin. Irena Lesnevskaya, the President of REN TV, asked [...] "So who <b>else</b> <b>here</b> can so bark at the President?". Konni, {{in what appeared to be}} an expression of dissatisfaction in not being allowed to [...] "participate" [...] in the meeting, continued barking, and refused several orders by Putin to come to him, leading Lesnevskaya to ask, [...] "So who else can disobey the President?".|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{professional}} literary critics, {{most prominent}} Russian {{writers of the}} time supported the novel wholeheartedly. Goncharov, Turgenev, Leskov, Dostoyevsky and Fet have all gone on record as declaring War and Peace the masterpiece of the Russian literature. Ivan Goncharov in a July 17, 1878 letter to Pyotr Ganzen advised him to choose for translating into Danish War and Peace, adding: [...] "This is positively {{what might be called}} a Russian Iliad. Embracing the whole epoch, it is the grandiose literary event, showcasing the gallery of great men painted by a lively brush of the great master ... This is one of the most, if not the most profound literary work ever. In 1879, unhappy with Ganzen having chosen Anna Karenina to start with, Goncharov insisted: [...] "War and Peace is the extraordinary poem of a novel, both in content and execution. It also serves as a monument to Russian history's glorious epoch when whatever figure you take is a colossus, a statue in bronze. Even [...] minor characters carry all the characteristic features of the Russian people and its life." [...] In 1885, expressing satisfaction with the fact that Tolstoy's works have now been translated into Danish, Goncharov again stressed the immense importance of War and Peace. [...] "Count Tolstoy really mounts over everybody <b>else</b> <b>here</b> [...] ", he remarked.|$|E

2500|$|The album {{has been}} well {{received}} by critics. The BBC review by Garry Mulholland described the record as [...] "40 minutes of gorgeous nothings, full of intricate curlicues of sparkling Colin Newman guitar and synth given beef by the surging rhythms of Robert Grey aka Gotobed and Graham Lewis [...] if you love alternative guitar music, you will love this, because Wire play alternative guitar music better than any young British band you can name." [...] PopMatters rated Red Barked Tree 8 out of 10, stating that [...] "Selecting a standout track is no easy feat when there's so much to sink one's teeth into. [...] Over 11 tracks of fantastically unapproachable guitars and vocals, of deceivingly simple rhythms and unswerving purpose, Wire sound perfectly comfortable in their own skin and sense of history on Red Barked Tree." [...] The Quietus described the record as [...] "a Wire album, through and through [...] Red Barked Tree reclaims the essence of their best work – the irreverence, the serene self-assuredness and the melody, but it's their lesser recognized attribute – a gamely grace – that eclipses all <b>else</b> <b>here</b> [...] as products of the post-punk generation their songs are full of contradictions: simultaneously friendly and unfamiliar; arithmetical but rolling; and rabble-rousing but vaguely neutral. The overall outcome is a sound much like a summer cold – woebegone and chilled but caressed with ripples of tingly heat, valanced by Newman's nacreous rhythm guitar that twirls through the wet, refined production beautifying everything it touches." [...] The Pitchfork review by Stuart Berman noted the presence of acoustic guitars in three tracks and the record's [...] "impulsive stylistic shifts – from mechanized thrash to psychedelic folk to nervy power-pop – mirror the 'age of fragmentation' that Colin Newman is railing against. [...] Wire have successfully reinvented themselves, this time as wise elder statesmen cautioning against a world where over-reliance on GPS systems has replaced the basic survivalist skill of knowing your map references." ...|$|E
