Mountain Gravel solicited bids for a subcontract for guardrails along the highway. The lowest bid was submitted by Adarand Constructors, {{with a higher}} bid being submitted by Gonzales Construction. However, Gonzales Construction had been certified by the Small Business Administration as a disadvantaged business and so Mountain Gravel awarded the subcontract to Gonzales because of financial incentives in the Mountain Gravel's contract for employing disadvantaged businesses. Adarand filed suit in federal court against DOT by arguing that the subcontracting <b>incentive</b> <b>clause,</b> or bonus, that caused Adarand to lose a subcontract was unconstitutional. The federal district court and circuit court {{ruled in favor of}} DOT and against Adarand, which then appealed to the US Supreme Court. The case was docketed as Adarand Constructors, Inc. v.

40|$|A {{comparison}} of <b>incentive</b> <b>clauses</b> of players’ contracts in German soccer and clauses {{used in the}} NFL and NBA shows considerable differences. Against the background of principle-agent theory we have {{a closer look at}} these incentive systems. In contrast to other industries it is easy to observe the employees’ effort in team sports. Therefore, it would be desirable to set incentives for players based on their individual effort. We show that there are reasons why <b>incentive</b> <b>clauses</b> in professional German soccer, the NBA and the NFL are not directly based on effort. We argue that there are two main reasons: Firstly, efficient incentives are complementarily provided by subjective and objective performance measures. Secondly, cooperation amongst team members is essential in team sports. sports, labor contracts, agency theory, incentives,...|$|R

After Langston turned free agent in 1989, Tellem engineered a record five-year, $16 million {{deal with the}} California Angels. In 1994, he convinced the Angels to sign journeyman Rex Hudler for the league minimum, inserting an innovative <b>incentive</b> <b>clause</b> into the contract: $1,000 for every plate appearance. In 1995, he found the [...] "voluntary retirement" [...] loophole in Hideo Nomo's contract that allowed the veteran pitcher to leave Japan and sign with the Los Angeles Dodgers. In 1997, the five-year, $55 million deal Tellem made with the White Sox for Albert Belle changed the salary structure in baseball. When Belle opted out of the contract in 1999, Tellem orchestrated a new five-year deal with the Baltimore Orioles worth $65 million. He also cobbled together contracts of six years and $88.5 million for Mussina in 2001; seven years and $120 million for Giambi in 2002; four years and $52 million for Matsui in 2004; and, in 2007, Chase Utley’s seven-year, $85 million arbitration contract with the Philadelphia Phillies. Utley’s pact was then the largest and longest ever given to a second baseman, and the most lucrative in Phillies history. In 2012, following an around-the-clock negotiating session, he and the Texas Rangers agreed to a six-year, $60 million deadline deal with Japanese pitcher Yu Darvish.|$|E

40|$|The {{construction}} industry {{is fraught with}} waste and inefficiencies resulting in projects often failing to meet owners? expectations. Integrated Project Delivery (IPD) is the newest project delivery system and changes the traditional roles and relationships of key project stakeholders. Through increased early collaboration IPD attempts to eliminate waste and deliver the highest value projects to owners. It {{is seen as a}} potential solution to many of the challenges impeding successful project performance. However, a transformational change towards IPD has yet to reach a ?tipping point? and its use is not prevalent throughout the {{construction industry}}. Little research has been done to quantitatively analyze IPD compared to the more commonly used delivery methods. Through substantial collection of quantitative project performance data and univariate statistical analysis, this study fills the gap in research by evaluating the effects of IPD on building construction projects across a wide range of performance metrics from the perspective of general contractors and construction managers. This research demonstrated that IPD/IPD-ish outperformed Non-IPD projects with respect to performance in communication, change management, and business performance areas. Evidence of superior communication performance was found {{in terms of the number}} of requests for information (RFIs) per million dollars; change management in terms of change order processing time; and business performance in terms of a project?s impact on company image and the potential for return business. A new term called the Project Quarterback Rating (PQR) that combines key performance metrics was used to quantitatively evaluate overall performance. Statistically significant evidence of overall superior IPD/IPD-ish performance was found compared to Non-IPD projects. This research also evaluated other project attributes and found evidence suggesting that higher overall performance was related to implementation of Lean construction techniques, a more engaged and empowered project leadership team, a higher level of stakeholder involvement throughout a project, and inclusion of an <b>incentive</b> <b>clause</b> in a construction contract. The results should encourage owners to consider the use of IPD, or the utilization of IPD principles in conjunction with other delivery methods, in future capital facilities endeavors...|$|E

The research objectives were (1) to investigate how the Department of Defense (DOD) motivates Industry to conserve energy, (2) to examine Industry's views for conserving energy in the acquisition process and (3) to provide recommendations based upon Industry's views. The results of the research indicate that selected acquisition concepts such as Life Cycle Costing, Value <b>Incentive</b> <b>Clauses,</b> Specifications and Profit, in addition to management programs and contingency plans, can effectively motivate Industry to conserve energy. The study's major contribution is that it presents the candid views of Industry for DOD consideration.

One notable occurrence during his time with the Cowboys was a return to Philadelphia. Cunningham started the game and dueled the new Eagles quarterback, Donovan McNabb. The game was decided in overtime, with an Eagles field goal giving them the 16-13 victory. He received a mixed reception of cheers and boos upon his return to Philadelphia. A 5-11 subpar year for the Cowboys led to major roster changes, and Cunningham {{was one of the}} many changes.

30|$|Over {{the past}} 25 to 30 years, {{the use of}} {{production}} contracts in hog production has increased substantially. During the same period, operations have become larger and more specialized; the number and production share of farrow-to-finish operations has declined, while the shares of operations that are farrow-to-wean, wean-to-feeder, and feeder-to-finish have increased (McBride and Key 2013). On average, in 2009, larger, more specialized operations were especially likely to use contracts (McBride and Key 2013). Hog contracts generally involve the contractor maintaining ownership of animals, providing inputs and technical advice to farmers. The farmer provides labor and facilities. The farmer receives a fee and the contractor receives the residual returns. The farmer’s return includes a payment {{based on the number}} of hogs or capacity. It may include <b>incentive</b> <b>clauses</b> regarding feed efficiency (MacDonald and McBride 2009). Key and McBride (2003) find that production contracts notably increase the productivity of US feeder-pig-to-finish hog operations. Key and McBride (2008) find that there was a substantial increase in total factor productivity in the U.S. hog industry between 1992 and 2004, due mostly to technical progress and increased scale efficiencies. This finding is consistent with contract use and contract provisions influencing productivity due to which farmers contract and the design of these contracts.|$|R
40|$|In the 1995 {{issue of}} the Journal of Cooperatives, Trechter and King {{reported}} findings from a survey of managerial compensation practices in Minnesota and Wisconsin cooperatives that was conducted in 1993. The results from that study indicated that overall compensation and bonuses received by general managers of local cooperatives were more closely associated with cooperative size measures than with levels of profitability. The results also suggested {{that there was not}} a strong relationship between compensation practices and cooperative performance, measured by return on assets. A follow-up compensation survey was conducted in 1994. The study population was expanded to include local cooperatives in North Dakota, along with the Minnesota and Wisconsin cooperatives that responded to the first survey questionnaire. In addition, new questions were added to the survey to elicit information on the use of specific cooperative performance targets in settings where there were no explicit <b>incentive</b> <b>clauses</b> in the manager's contract. Finally, collecting compensation data for a second consecutive year made it possible to analyze factors associated with changes in compensation levels. Results from this follow-up survey are reported here. In the sections that follow, data collection procedures are first briefly summarized.

The first is that agency relationships often require the creation of specific property rights in order for firm owners to realize productive efficiencies of scale or scope from agency. The second is that the economic characteristics of the agency relationship, which generally entail the transfer of specific "process rights " to agents, are often quite different from the nature of agency characterized in and supported by the common law.

40|$|The {{interest}} in construction partnering has increased {{during the last}} decade. Much research has, however, found that cooperation and its benefits are not easily obtained, partly {{due to a lack}} of understanding of the partnering concept and when and how to implement it. The aim is therefore to increase this understanding by investigating three research questions: (1) What is partnering? (2) When should partnering be used and to what extent? (3) How should partnering be implemented? A thorough literature review and four case studies are utilized to develop a definition of partnering and discuss when and how partnering should be implemented through cooperative procurement procedures. Partnering is defined as a cooperative governance form that is based on core and optional cooperative procurement procedures to such an extent that cooperation-based coopetition is facilitated. Mandatory core procedures are: soft parameters in bid evaluation, compensation form based on open books, and usage of the core collaborative tools start-up workshop, joint objectives, follow-up workshops, teambuilding, and conflict resolution techniques. Complementary optional procedures are: early involvement of contractors in concurrent engineering, limited bid invitation, joint selection and involvement of subcontractors in broad partnering teams, collaborative contractual <b>clauses,</b> <b>incentives</b> based on group performance, usage of complementary collaborative tools (e. g. partnering questionnaire, facilitator, joint risk management, joint project office, and joint IT tools), and increased focus on contractors' self-control.

40|$|Construction {{planning}} and scheduling {{are important to}} contractors for estimating the cost and duration of a project they are to bid on and construct. Many projects specify <b>incentive</b> and disincentive <b>clauses</b> for completing projects early and late. The timely completion and success of a project rely on good {{planning and}} scheduling.   Contractors who repeatedly build {{the same kind of}} facilities acquire experience in scheduling the needed construction work. When parts of a facility's design are copied from one project to the next, the previously developed schedules could possibly be reused to schedule future work. This dissertation presents a construction planner and scheduler, named CasePlan, that automates the planning and scheduling process through the use of experience encoded in cases.  CasePlan enables a contractor to specify a facility design using a product model, describe the relationships between product components and parts of a schedule (e. g., activity subnetworks, construction crews), and store this information as a case. As a decision support tool, CasePlan enables the contractor to search for cases whose facility designs are similar to that of a new project. The similarity assessment is based on the relative importance values that the contractor assigns to the components and their attributes in the product model. As an automation tool, CasePlan creates the schedule of a new project by reusing parts of the schedules whose associated designs are most similar to that project's design. The result is a schedule in which construction alternatives are chosen from those used in previous cases based on the new project scheduling constraints. The contractor / system-user can interact with CasePlan during its operation or modify the resulting schedule to add detail needed for executing the schedule in the field.  Two types of construction projects have been studied for the development of CasePlan. One is the Kit-of-Parts post offices, in which designs are made by reusing design modules defined as Parts. The other is the boiler erection for fossil-fueled power plants, in which the design process is standardized and component configurations are similar across designs. These projects were chosen because their schedules are similar within each project type, which suggested that practitioners had a high incentive and were likely to reuse schedules.  CasePlan's similarity assessment for boiler erection projects was validated using a survey. CasePlan's schedules and usability was subjectively evaluated also by the interviewed professionals. ...|$|R
