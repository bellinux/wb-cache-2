40|$|Abstract. Temperature {{evolution}} {{is one of}} the important parameters of mechanical properties of thin strip products. So the ability of prediction of temperature history before processing is critical to the processing scheme of controlling rolling and controlling cooling. In this paper an integrate model of finite element method is presented for the prediction of the temperature evolution in the <b>finishing</b> <b>rolling</b> during hot strips. The model takes into account the interaction between thermal behavior and mechanical behaviors. By using the second-development method based on the commercial code thermal behavior and temperature distribution of strips through seven-pass <b>finishing</b> <b>rolling</b> are described in detail. A method for computing the mean temperature at the exit of each pass is approached. Using this method the mean temperature can be attained after each pass. In one seven-pass thin strip rolling mills the temperature at the exit after each pass is measured by the pyrometer. The measured results and the simulation results are compared.

40|$|Manganese {{partitioning}} {{and mechanical}} properties of dual phase steels have been examined. The manganese partitioning coefficient increases to a limit with increasing isothermal holding time, {{and the final}} equilibrium partitioning coefficient decreases with increasing annealing temperature. The combination of diffusion equations in austenite and ferrite plus mass balance and austenite growth can give the manganese distribution in austenite and ferrite respectively, and the manganese partitioning coefficient at any isothermal holding time. The introduction of rolling during annealing or {{at the end of}} annealing can strengthen dual phase steels by elongating austenite and introducing internal stresses and dislocations, the magnitude of which depends on <b>finishing</b> <b>rolling</b> temperature and the timing of rolling during annealing. The tensile properties of as-rolled dual phase steels are strongly influenced by <b>finishing</b> <b>rolling</b> temperature and martensite volume fraction because of internal stresses and dislocation density, whereas those of post-rolling annealed steels depend on only martensite volume percentage. To model the heat-treatment for producing dual phase steels (“in-situ” dual phase steel), a steel-steel composite is produced by incorporating high strength steel-wires into ductile steel sheets through hot-rolling (“artificial” dual phase steel). The properties of the reinforcing wire, matrix steels, interfacial strength between wire and matrix steels and steel-steel composite are affected by the surface condition of wire, <b>finishing</b> <b>rolling</b> temperature, preform holding time at rolling temperature before rolling, and heat-treatment after fabrication of composites. Mileiko’s theory can predict the relationship between the steel-steel composite strength and the volume fraction of wire. But for dual phase steels, Mileiko’s theory can be applied only when martensite volume fraction is over 30 % because the residual stress, high dislocation density and carbide are produced at low temperature, at which low martensite volume fraction is obtained. Continuous wire composites can simulate the as-rolled dual phase steel when the reinforcement content is over 30 %, but discontinuous wire composites can not simulate the post-rolling annealed dual phase steel...|$|R

40|$|Thermo-mechanical control {{processing}} (TMCP) is {{a powerful}} tool for development of high strength low alloy (HSLA) steels. The understanding of the effect of process parameters on the microstructure of these steels is a key aspect for the optimization of their mechanical properties. The influence of the rolling temperatures and the cooling conditions on the texture, strength and toughness of HSLA steel was investigated. Two stage controlled rolling (roughing and finishing) was carried out on a laboratory rolling mill. Four different compositions were rolled by maintaining same roughing conditions but varying the process parameters of the <b>finish</b> <b>rolling,</b> namely, start <b>finish</b> <b>rolling</b> temperature (SFRT), <b>finish</b> <b>rolling</b> and cooling temperatures.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the work}} is a semi-industrial {{physical}} simulation of thermomechanical rolling and controlled cooling of advanced high-strength steels with increased Mn and Al content. Design/methodology/approach: Four steels of various Mn and Nb concentration were thermomechanically rolled in 3 and 5 passes using a modern LPS line for physical simulation of hot rolling at a semi-industrial scale. The hot deformation course is fully automated as well as controlled cooling applied directly after <b>finishing</b> <b>rolling.</b> Temperature-time and force-energetic parameters of hot rolling were continuously registered and assessed. Findings: The applied line consisting of two-high reversing mill, roller tables with heating panels, cooling devices and controlling-recording systems reflects industrial hot strip rolling parameters sufficiently. Reduction values and temperature-time regimes are similar to those used in industrial practice whereas strain rate is limited to about 10 s- 1 what requires taking into account during comparison. All the steels investigated have high total pressure forces due to the high total content of alloying elements. The critical factor making it possible to obtain high-quality sheet samples with a thickness up to 3. 3 mm is applying isothermal heating panels which decrease a cooling rate of thin sheets. Research limitations/implications: The real complete simulation of hot strip rolling requires extension of a used line with a further module for simulation of continuous <b>finishing</b> <b>rolling</b> stages. The work is in progress. Practical implications: The results can be successfully utilized in industrial hot rolling and controlled cooling practices after necessary modifications.

40|$|Abstract: Improving {{the steel}} {{properties}} and production processes with reduced energy demand for high strength steels requires improved process control in close {{relation to the}} steel composition. Hot rolling of steel is an energy-intensive process, especially in respect of preheating the steel slabs. The present work was carried out {{with the aim of}} reducing the initial slab temperature {{while at the same time}} improving properties by optimization of the steel composition and process parameters. Optimization of slab reheating and hot rolling parameters in connection with plate and strip rolling was carried out on low C-Mn high-strength steels microalloyed with Mo-Ti-Nb-B, both in laboratory and full scales processing. The effects of a low slab reheating temperature, high <b>finish</b> <b>rolling</b> temperature (FRT) during thermo-mechanical controlled processing (TMCP) and accelerated cooling rates following hot rolling to RT or to the coiling temperature have been investigated. Improvement of yield strength of the plate has been obtained by lowering the slab reheating temperature, especially with high cooling rates (> 20 °C/s) to room temperature. The results obtained for strip steels also show that a reduced reheating temperature combined with high <b>finish</b> <b>rolling</b> temperatures and cooling rates (> 20 °C/s) to a coiling temperature of 450 °C produces very positive microstructures and mechanical properties in the present steels.
