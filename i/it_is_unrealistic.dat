25|$|One of {{the central}} points made by critics of canal expansion, most {{prominently}} former canal administrator Fernando Manfredo, is that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unrealistic</b> to attempt to predict canal usage trends over a generation, improbable to expect that US imports from China {{will continue to grow}} for a generation as they have the past few years, and irresponsible to bet Panama's financial future on such a projection.|$|E
25|$|The EIB is {{presently}} implemented as a circular ring consisting of four 16 bytes wide unidirectional channels which counter-rotate in pairs. When traffic patterns permit, each channel can convey {{up to three}} transactions concurrently. As the EIB runs at half the system clock rate the effective channel rate is 16 bytes every two system clocks. At maximum concurrency, with three active transactions {{on each of the}} four rings, the peak instantaneous EIB bandwidth is 96 bytes per clock (12 concurrent transactions * 16 bytes wide / 2 system clocks per transfer). While this figure is often quoted in IBM literature <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unrealistic</b> to simply scale this number by processor clock speed. The arbitration unit imposes additional constraints which are discussed in the Bandwidth Assessment section below.|$|E
500|$|When Asmoro {{reads the}} story, {{he says that}} <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>{{unrealistic}}</b> and that readers need a climax. However, Adjeng insists that reality is unrealistic and that not all victims of rape are willing to call the police. Several days later, while they are lying in bed, Asmoro shows Adjeng that [...] "Lintah" [...] had been published in Kompas. Adjeng's mother, aware of the story's autobiographical nature, is furious and, after going to Adjeng's apartment, blames everything on Adjeng's father abandoning them.|$|E

5000|$|The BBC's test {{audience}} had {{a strong}} negative reaction to the story, complaining that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unrealistic,</b> [...] "so ridiculous that it's a bore", and [...] "suitable only for morons". [...] Despite these criticisms, many later critics have praised the story's use of humour to contrast with the darker elements of the piece.|$|R
5000|$|... : Foreign Ministry {{spokesman}} Andrei Popov {{stated that}} his government believes the situation arose from an unwillingness {{on the part}} of nuclear powers to disarm themselves and that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unrealistic</b> to expect non-nuclear states to not develop their own deterrent when threatened by states with such arms. Belarus called upon the states concerned to return to negotiations.|$|R

2500|$|The 2008 Democratic Party Platform {{acknowledges}} a [...] "special {{relationship with}} Israel, grounded in shared interests and shared values, and a clear, strong, fundamental {{commitment to the}} security of Israel, our strongest ally in the region and its only established democracy." [...] It also included: It is {{in the best interests of}} all parties, including the United States, that we take an active role to help secure a lasting settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict with a democratic, viable Palestinian state dedicated to living in peace and security side by side with the Jewish State of Israel. To do so, we must help Israel identify and strengthen those partners who are truly committed to peace, while isolating those who seek conflict and instability, and stand with Israel against those who seek its destruction. The United States and its Quartet partners should continue to isolate Hamas until it renounces terrorism, recognizes Israel's right to exist, and abides by past agreements. Sustained American leadership for peace and security will require patient efforts and the personal commitment of the President of the United States. The creation of a Palestinian state through final status negotiations, together with an international compensation mechanism, should resolve the issue of Palestinian refugees by allowing them to settle there, rather than in Israel. All understand that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unrealistic</b> to expect the outcome of final status negotiations to be a full and complete return to the armistice lines of 1949. Jerusalem is and will remain the capital of Israel. The parties have agreed that Jerusalem is a matter for final status negotiations. It should remain an undivided city accessible to people of all faiths.|$|E

40|$|Since {{strategy}} is about connecting ends, ways and means, the means constrain the ends. <b>It</b> would <b>be</b> <b>unrealistic</b> to set objectives {{for which the}} means are unavailable or cannot be acquired in time. But <b>it</b> would <b>be</b> equally <b>unrealistic</b> to underestimate the available means. To wilfully ignore one’s potential is to handicap one’s strategy from the outset...|$|R
50|$|Awdry's {{complaints}} were directed at {{two aspects of}} the episode in particular. One <b>was</b> that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unrealistic</b> to have a railway running through a forest, and that sparks from an engine's funnel could cause a wildfire. Britt Allcroft, the producer of the series, countered this aspect by claiming {{that she had seen}} a number of lines do the same thing.|$|R

2500|$|Washington {{believed}} {{in the importance of}} religion for republican government. His 1796 Farewell Address, written by Alexander Hamilton and revised by himself, said that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unrealistic</b> to expect that a whole nation, whatever might be said of minds of peculiar structure, could long be moral without religion, that national morality is necessary for good government, and that politicians should cherish religion's support of national morality: ...|$|R
50|$|In April 1944, Hill's {{opposite}} number, Colonel Chichayev, {{complained that}} SOE had done practically nothing {{and that the}} Soviets no longer had any need for them. At the same time, SOE was frustrated by NKVD's refusal to co-operate in Soviet-occupied Europe, particularly with the Polish underground army. Hill could not really <b>be</b> blamed: <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unrealistic</b> to expect SOE and NKVD to co-operate successfully.|$|R
50|$|The Auld Report (2001) {{commented that}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unrealistic</b> {{to expect the}} social {{composition}} of magistrates {{to be close to}} that of the general population. This was partly because many people found it difficult to obtain support from their senior managers to be released for magisterial duties, and because of other reasons relating to employment. Therefore, the bench would never be a true cross-section of society.|$|R
50|$|The Perilous Gard also {{contains}} {{references to the}} Thomas the Rhymer ballad and to the Arthurian legends, as well. Kate initially dislikes British folklore because she believes that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unrealistic.</b> As the story unfolds, however, she finds that the folklore she once despised is based on fact, and that understanding it may allow her to save Christopher from the Fairy Queen.|$|E

Instead, adopting the following approach will provide a solution - ...|$|E
5000|$|Under {{the first}} view, species appear {{to us as}} typical natural kinds, but when {{biologists}} turn to understand species evolutionarily they are revealed as changeable and without sharp boundaries.

50|$|In February 2007, a {{property}} assessment {{report found that}} more than $5 million was needed to restore the church building, and that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unrealistic</b> for the parish to continue maintaining all its properties. The following month, the parish council petitioned the Bishop of Tasmania, Rt. Rev. John Harrower, to deconsecrate the building. In August the decision to close the church was communicated to the congregation, and the final service was held on 28 October 2007.|$|R
5000|$|Routier was {{represented}} at trial by prominent lawyer Douglas Mulder. Defense attorneys {{said that there}} was no reason why she would have killed her children. They said that the case did not have a motive, a confession or any witnesses. They asserted that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unrealistic</b> to accuse her of staging a crime scene. Her attorneys advised her not to appear on the witness stand, but she testified anyway and [...] "withered under cross-examination by prosecutor Toby Shook." ...|$|R

50|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>unrealistic</b> {{to expect}} {{business}} to voluntarily commit the resources required for full sustainable accounting implementation.

Once the sustainability accounting system is established tax rates could be linked to (sustainability) performance outcomes to encourage the transition to sustainability at the organizational level.|$|E
50|$|There is {{significant}} debate among scholars {{as to whether}} the athletes actually vaulted over the bull. Sir Arthur Evans argued that the Bull-Leaping Fresco depicts acrobats literally seizing the bull by the horns and leaping over the creature’s back. Others have asserted that the fresco more likely shows young Minoan people attempting to ride the bull and that the act of catching a charging bull and vaulting over <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unrealistic.</b>|$|E
5000|$|After his 2009 breakup with Bristol, Johnston gave {{a series}} of nationally {{televised}} interviews. He appeared on The Tyra Banks Show {{with his mother and}} sister, saying he wanted to dispel rumors. Remarking on Bristol's public appearances to promote sexual abstinence, Johnston told The Early Show that [...] "abstinence is a great idea" [...] but said <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unrealistic</b> to think <b>it</b> <b>is</b> going to work for teens. In another interview {{he said that he was}} [...] "pretty sure" [...] Sarah Palin had known that he and Bristol were having sex in the family's house.|$|R
2500|$|Lee's stated {{goals were}} {{expressed}} in the [...] "747 Plan" [...] and included: 7% annual growth in gross domestic product (GDP), $40,000 USD per capita, and transforming Korea into the world's seventh largest economy. An important part of his platform was the Grand Korean Waterway (한반도 대운하) project from Busan to Seoul, which he believed would lead to an economic revival. His political opponents criticized the project, saying <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unrealistic</b> and too costly to be realized. Others were concerned about possible negative environmental impact.|$|R
50|$|Ruppin {{was a major}} Zionist {{figure and}} held a senior {{position}} within the Jewish Agency as Director of the Palestine Land Development Company. Most Palestinian Jews and Arabs rejected the proposed binational solution, and Ruppin himself eventually became convinced <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unrealistic.</b> The group disintegrated by the early 1930s. The idea of a single state for Jews and Arabs between the Jordan and the Mediterranean has never fully died, however. In 1942, Magnes and supporters of Brit Shalom formed the political party Ihud which also advocated binationalism.|$|R
5000|$|In {{an age of}} big business, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unrealistic</b> {{to think}} only of markets of the {{classical}} kind. Big businesses set their own terms in the marketplace, and use their combined resources for advertising programmes to support demand for their own products. As a result, individual preferences actually reflect the preferences of entrenched corporations, a [...] "dependence effect", and {{the economy as a}} whole is geared to irrational goals.|$|E
