40|$|Interest in, {{and the use}} of, <b>electronic</b> <b>marketplaces,</b> if {{less than}} {{at the height of}} the dot. com boom, appears to be enduring, and is {{therefore}} an important area for continuing academic study. <b>Electronic</b> <b>marketplaces</b> were heralded as allowing buyers to find new suppliers more easily, compare their offerings and if appropriate switch between them. However, sellers have proved reluctant to participate in marketplaces where they perceive the over-riding criterion for comparison with competitors is that of price, contributing to the failure of a number of marketplaces. This study seeks to explore the impact of <b>electronic</b> <b>marketplaces</b> on the relationship between buyers and suppliers. In particular, it seeks to determine if the ''move to the middle'' hypothesis put forward by Clemons et al. will be supported in this domain. Case studies of buying organisations, in four distinct industries, that are participating in <b>electronic</b> <b>marketplaces</b> were undertaken. It was found that the adoption of <b>electronic</b> <b>marketplaces</b> has led to a reduction in supplier numbers and to the deepening of relationships with them. Rather than replace human relationships, the establishment of electronic communications between organisations has resulted in increased person-to-person communication. The findings of this study suggest that <b>electronic</b> <b>marketplaces</b> can form an important part of an IT enabled supplier relationship management strategy...|$|R

40|$|Business-to-business (B 2 B) marketplaces have {{significant}} potential {{impacts on the}} structure of channel relationships and IT management arrangements. IS theory traditionally investigated <b>electronic</b> <b>marketplaces</b> from a transaction cost theory point of view. We identify three major limitations of transaction cost theory as it applies to B 2 B <b>electronic</b> <b>marketplaces.</b> A number of other literatures with a bearing on <b>electronic</b> <b>marketplaces</b> have critiqued and extended transaction cost models. Among them are strategic networks theory, marketing channel theory, and political economy. This paper reviews and attempts to synthesize these perspectives on <b>electronic</b> <b>marketplaces</b> and exchanges. We propose an integrative model combining transaction cost theory, strategic networks theory, relational exchange theory, and the theory of political economy. The synthesis promotes better operationalizations of EMP channel structure, identifies the antecedents and consequences of EMP channel structures, and suggests an agenda for future research. ...|$|R
40|$|Healthcare {{providers}} {{are seeking to}} limit the significant growth {{in the cost of}} healthcare provision and are increasingly seeking to use information technology to reduce costs. In the UK in particular, a recent major government report has caused a focus on the improved use of IT in the National Health Service (NHS), including the use of electronic procurement and <b>electronic</b> <b>marketplaces</b> {{in order to reduce the}} significant amounts spent on goods and services each year.

Interviews were carried out with managers of healthcare <b>electronic</b> <b>marketplaces</b> operating in the UK, suppliers and buyers in those marketplaces and policy makers in the NHS. The study finds that, to date, the focus of healthcare <b>electronic</b> <b>marketplaces</b> operating in the UK is on the purchasing process.

40|$|The {{launch of}} B 2 B exchanges in brick and mortar {{industries}} has inspired {{the study of}} the potential impacts on business models of this shift from offline into online trade. Among market parties, intermediaries form a very interesting group, since <b>electronic</b> <b>marketplaces</b> could be seen as their direct competitors. We argue that the emergence of <b>electronic</b> <b>marketplaces</b> both creates opportunities and threats for brick and mortar intermediaries. This paper presents an analysis of the theoretical impacts of <b>electronic</b> <b>marketplaces</b> on brick and mortar intermediaries and both illustrates and extends the theoretical findings with the Elemica case. Elemica is an initiative of several major chemical companies, which aims to reduce supply chain costs by providing one-stop shopping.

The proposed schema is then used to classify and discuss several commercial and academic agentbased <b>electronic</b> <b>marketplaces.</b> Finally, we formulate some conclusions and challenges for further research in the field of agent-based e-marketplaces. ...|$|R

40|$|If {{the first}} chapter of the Internet was about the {{dissemination}} of information, chapter two is about services.

In particular, <b>electronic</b> <b>marketplaces</b> represent the new space for service providers and service consumers to interact and carry out business transactions.
