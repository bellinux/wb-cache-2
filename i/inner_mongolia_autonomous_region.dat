Mines in Inner Mongolia are rapidly expanding production, with 637 million tons produced in 2009. Transport of coal from this region to seaports on China's coast has overloaded highways such as China National Highway 110 resulting in chronic traffic jams and delays.|$|E
25|$|In 1923, the Third Asiatic Expedition of the American Museum of Natural History, led {{by chief}} {{paleontologist}} Walter W. Granger was hunting for dinosaur fossils in Mongolia. On April 25, assistant paleontologist George Olsen recovered the holotype (AMNH 6554), or name-bearing specimen, of Alectrosaurus, a nearly complete right hindlimb. This included the distal {{end of the}} right femur, the tibia, the fibula, the astragalus, the calcaneum, an incomplete right pes, three metatarsals of the left hind foot, two manual unguals, a manus, and the distal end of the pubis known as the pubic foot. On May 4, Olsen discovered AMNH 6368 approximately 30 meters away from his first find. This specimen included a right humerus, two incomplete manual digits, four fragmentary caudal vertebrae, and other poorly preserved material. These discoveries were made at the Iren Dabasu Formation {{in what is now}} the <b>Inner</b> <b>Mongolia</b> <b>Autonomous</b> <b>Region</b> (Nei Mongol Zizhiqu) of the People's Republic of China.

40|$|During {{winter the}} Yellow River in China is {{frequently}} subjected to ice flood disasters. Possible dike breaking due to ice floods poses {{a serious threat}} to the part of the region located along the river, in particular the Ning–Meng reach (including Ningxia Hui and the <b>Inner</b> <b>Mongolia</b> <b>autonomous</b> <b>regions).</b> Due to its special geographical location and river flow direction, the ice dams and jams lead to dike breaking and overtopping on the embankment, which has resulted in huge casualties and property losses throughout history. Therefore, there is a growing need to develop capability in forecasting and analysing river ice floods. Research into ice floods along the river is taking place at the Yellow River Conservancy Commission (YRCC). A numerical model is one of the essential parts of the current research going on at the YRCC, which can be used to supplement the inadequacies in the field and lab studies which are being carried out to help understand the physical processes of river ice on the Yellow River. Based on the available data about the Ning–Meng reach of the Yellow River, the YRCC river ice dynamic model (YRIDM) has been tested for capabilities to conduct ice flood forecasting. The YRIDM can be applied to simulate water level, discharge, water temperature, and ice cover thickness under unsteady-state conditions. Different scenarios were designed to explore the model uncertainty for two bounds (5 and 95 %) and probability distribution. The YRIDM is an unsteady-state flow model that can show the basic regular pattern of ice floods; hence it can be used as an important tool to support decision making. The recommendation is that data and research should be continued in order to support the model and to measure improvements. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

500|$|Two {{new species}} of Psittacosaurus were {{described}} by Canadian Dale Russell and Zhao in 1996. The first was named P. neimongoliensis, after the Mandarin Chinese name for Inner Mongolia. It {{is based on a}} nearly complete fossil skeleton, including most of the skull, found in the Early Cretaceous Ejinhoro Formation with seven other individuals. Russell and Zhao also named P. ordosensis in 1996, after the Ordos prefecture of the <b>Inner</b> <b>Mongolia</b> <b>Autonomous</b> <b>Region.</b> The type specimen is a nearly complete skeleton, including part of the skull. However, only the skull, lower jaw, and foot have been described. Three other specimens were referred to this species but remain undescribed. Like P. neimongoliensis, this species was discovered in the Eijnhoro Formation. Sereno (2010) found the species as described to be indistinguishable from P. sinensis, another small species, but suggested that additional study of P. ordosensis might reveal diagnostic features.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{explore the}} {{associations}} between waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), {{body mass index}} (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) and risk of ischemic stroke among Mongolian men in China. METHODS: A population-based prospective cohort study was conducted from June 2003 to July 2012 in <b>Inner</b> <b>Mongolia,</b> an <b>autonomous</b> <b>region</b> in north China. A total of 1034 men aged 20 years and older free of cardiovascular disease {{were included in the}} cohort and followed up for an average of 9. 2 years. The subjects were divided into four groups by WHtR levels (WHtR 0. 60). The cumulative survival rates of ischemic stroke among the four groups were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier curves and compared by log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards models and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were employed to evaluate the associations between obesity indices and ischemic stroke. RESULTS: A total of 47 ischemic stroke patients were observed during the follow-up period. The cumulative incidence and incidence density of ischemic stroke were 4. 55 % and 507. 61 / 100 000 person-years, respectively. After the major risk factors were adjusted, individuals with WHtR> 0. 60 had a 3. 56 -fold increased risk of ischemic stroke compared with those with 0. 40 ≤WHtR≤ 0. 50. Hazard ratio (HR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) of ischemic stroke for a 1 -SD increase in WHtR was 1. 34 (95 % CI: 1. 00 - 1. 81). After adding BMI or WC to models, higher WHtR remained significantly associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that the cumulative survival rate in the group with WHtR> 0. 60 was significantly lower than in the group with 0. 40 ≤WHtR≤ 0. 50 (log-rank test, P = 0. 025). The areas under the curve for each index were as follows: 0. 586 for WHtR, 0. 543 for WC; 0. 566 for BMI. CONCLUSIONS: Higher WHtR is associated with risk of ischemic stroke in Mongolian males. WHtR may be useful in predicting ischemic stroke incidence in males...|$|R
40|$|<b>Inner</b> <b>Mongolia</b> is an <b>autonomous</b> <b>region</b> of China {{and has a}} {{long history}} of pastoralism.

40|$|Introduction. Koumiss is a low-alcohol {{product made}} from {{fermented}} mare's milk, which is popular in Kazakhstan, Russia, {{and other countries}} of Central Asia, China, and Mongolia. Natural mare's milk is fermented in symbiosis of two types of microorganisms (lactobacteria and yeast). Koumiss’s microbial composition varies depending on the geographical, climatic, and cultural conditions. Based on a phenotypic characteristic from samples, Wu, R. and colleagues identified the following bacteria isolated in <b>inner</b> <b>Mongolia,</b> an <b>autonomous</b> <b>region</b> of China: L. casei, L. helveticus, L. plantarum, L. coryniformis subsp. coryniformis, L. paracasei, L. kefiranofaciens, L. curvatus, L. fermentum, and W. kandleri. Studies of the yeast composition in koumiss also showed significant variations. Thus, there were Saccharomyces unisporus related 48. 3 % of isolates, to Kluyveromyces marxianus (27. 6 %), Pichia membranaefaciens (15. 0 %), and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (9. 2 %) from 87 isolated yeast cultures. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the bacterial composition in koumiss. Methods. To extract DNA, 1. 8 ml of fermented milk was centrifuged to generate a pellet, which was suspended in 450 µl of lysis buffer P 1 from the Powerfood Microbial DNA Isolation kit (MoBio Laboratories Inc, USA). Amplification of the microflora was used to determine the composition of a fragment of the gene 16 S rRNA and ITS 1. Plasmid library with target insertion was obtained on the basis of height copy plasmid vectors producing high pGem-T. The definition of direct nucleotide sequencing was performed by the method of Sanger using a set of "BigDye Terminanor v 3. 1 Cycle sequencing Kit with automatic genetic analyzer ABI 3730 xl  (Applied Biosystems, USA).  Informax Vector NTI Suite 9, Sequence Scanner v 1. 0  software package used for the analysis. Results. Our studies showed that in the most samples of koumiss isolated from Akmola region (Central Kazakhstan) prevailed the following bacteria species: Lactobacillus diolivorans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. casei, L. curvatus  yeast genus Torula (62. 4 %) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (37. 6 %).
