40|$|To {{identify}} genes specifically {{expressed in}} taste tissues, we constructed a subtraction cDNA library of epithelium of rat circumvallate and foliate papillae {{and carried out}} differential screening of this library. Dot blot analysis showed 46 out of 88 clones obtained by this method to be expressed in the epithelium of papillae. The cDNA inserts in these clones were sequenced and analyzed for similarity to entries the GenBank database. About 64. 3 % of the clones were known sequences, including the sequences of ebnerin, cytokeratin 18, and Na+,K+-ATPase, that were shown by in situ hybridization to be expressed in the circumval-late papillae.

40|$|Abstract Brain-derived {{neurotrophic}} factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin- 3 (NT- 3) mRNAs {{are expressed in}} the developing rat tongue and taste organs in specific spatio-temporal patterns.

40|$|Taste buds and {{papillae}} {{in tongues}} of rhesus monkeys were examined and counted {{to determine if}} there are age-related differences in general morphology or numbers of receptor organs. Tongues from 15 monkeys in five groups aged 4 – 31 years were studied with light microscopy. Fungiform, circumvallate, and foliate papillae were examined and taste buds in each papilla type were counted. Numbers of papillae did not differ with age through 31 years; however, at 24 years and older, fungiform papillae were reduced in number in some animals that had lost tongue tips due to trauma. There were no age-related differences in numbers of taste buds in any of the three <b>gustatory</b> <b>papilla</b> types, nor did taste bud diameter alter with age. From data on each papilla type, estimates were made of total numbers of lingual taste buds. Totals ranged from about 8, 000 to 10, 000 and there were no agerelated differences. These results support other recent reports that taste buds are not decreased in number in old rats or humans. Since taste bud numbers and general morphology are maintained even in old age, any age-related differences in taste behavior cannot be attributed to gross degenerative changes in lingual taste buds...|$|R
40|$|To {{establish}} lingual receptive {{fields that}} are the basic unit of taste function, ganglion cells must extend neurites to peripheral and central targets and form connections. This symposium concerns developmental interactions between the geniculate, trigeminal and petrosal ganglia and peripheral taste organs, the <b>gustatory</b> <b>papillae</b> and resident taste buds. Investigators present data from organ and tissue culture, from mice with targeted gene deletions and from grafting experiments, in pursuit of principles that direct early innervation of the taste system. The lingual ganglia and the taste papillae initially develop independently, but then become reciprocally dependent as ganglia derive neurotrophin support from <b>gustatory</b> <b>papillae</b> and the papillae require sensory innervation for growth and morphogenesis. The issue of subsequent taste bud induction is discussed with results from amphibian and mammalian models, yielding conclusions that are not yet totally convergent.

40|$|ABSTRACT Background The {{inherent}} {{complications of}} cirrhosis include protein-calorie malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies. Changes in taste are {{detrimental to the}} nutritional status, and the mechanism to explain these changes is not well documented in the cirrhotic patients. Objective To evaluate the taste buds of cirrhotic rats. Methods Fourteen male Wistar rats were evaluated. After 16 weeks, the liver was removed to histologically diagnose cirrhosis, and blood was collected to perform liver integrity tests. The tongue was removed for histological examination and immunohistochemistry using antibodies against protein gene product PGP 9. 5 and the sweet taste receptors T 1 R 2 and T 1 R 3. Morphological changes were determined by scanning electron microscopy. Serum zinc levels were measured. Results The cirrhotic animals, but not the control animals, exhibited zinc deficiency. In both groups, there was positive immunoreactivity for type II and III cells and T 1 R 2 receptors. The cirrhotic animals had no immunoreactivity for T 1 R 3 receptors. Scanning electron microscopy analysis of the cirrhotic group revealed a uniform tapering of the <b>gustatory</b> <b>papillae.</b> Conclusion In conclusion the experimental cirrhosis model mimicked the biochemical and histological parameters of human cirrhosis, therefore enabling {{a study of the}} <b>gustatory</b> <b>papillae</b> and taste buds...|$|E

We {{examined}} the literature to verify whether adaptations and modifications {{in the structure}} and glandular secretions of birds ’ tongues are related to habitat and can be ascribed to evolutionary processes. The data are discussed in relation to species taxonomy, following the Sibley and Ahlquist classification [C. G. Sibley and J. E. Alquist, Philogeny and Classification of Birds. A study in molecular evolution (Yale University Pres, New Haven, 1990) ]. The following conclusions are drawn: <b>gustatory</b> <b>papillae</b> and taste buds are present in varying numbers in most species. The composition of gland secretions is also found to be variable. Proteic secretion is documented in Larus modestus, Sula varie-gata, Fulica atra only. Acid proteoglycans both with sulfomucins and carboxymucins, and also glycoproteins, are consistently found. Sialic and hyaluronic acids are found in many species. Our overview indicates that {{the presence or absence}} of <b>gustatory</b> <b>papillae</b> is related to adaptation processes that these structures undergo in response to environmental factors, and that the absence of front tongue glands can be ascribed to habitat and feeding habits. Referring to the Sibley and Ahlquist classification, proteins are present in the glandular se-cretion of less evolved species, whereas more evolved species exhibit a gradual decrease in proteins with the exception of hyaluronic acid, which is absent, and a progressive increase in glycoproteins and acid proteoglycans. 1...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Recent {{studies in}} rodents and humans {{suggest that the}} chemoreception of {{long-chain}} fatty acids (LCFA) in oral cavity {{is involved in the}} spontaneous preference for fatty foods and might contribute to the obesity risk. CD 36 and GPR 120 are LCFA receptors identified in rodent taste bud cells. The fact that CD 36 or GPR 120 gene inactivation leads to a decrease in the preference for lipids raises the question of the respective role(s) played by these gustatory lipid-sensor candidates. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using a combination of biochemical, nutritional and behavioural studies in wild-type, CD 36 (+/-) and CD 36 (-/-) mice, it was found that: 1 °) CD 36 and GPR 120 display different diurnal rhythms in the <b>gustatory</b> circumvallate <b>papillae,</b> CD 36 mRNA levels being down-regulated during the dark period in contrast to GPR 120, 2 °) this change is due to food intake and strictly dependent of the presence of lipids in the diet, 3 °) CD 36 protein levels are also rapidly but transiently decreased by the food intake, a two-fold drop in CD 36 protein levels being found 1 h after refeeding, followed by a progressive return to the pre-prandial values, 4 °) this down-regulation, which has a post-transcriptional origin, seems sufficient to alter the spontaneous fat preference, independently to change in the GPR 120 gene expression. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In contrast to GPR 120, CD 36 appears to be a food-sensitive lipid sensor in the <b>gustatory</b> circumvallate <b>papillae.</b> Lipid-mediated change in lingual CD 36 expression might modulate the motivation for fat during a meal, initially high and then gradually decreasing secondary to the food intake. This short-term lipid-mediated effect is reminiscent of sensory-specific satiety. These findings, which highlight the role played by CD 36 in the oro-sensory perception of dietary lipids, raise the possibility of novel pharmacological strategies to modify attraction for fatty foods and decrease obesity risks...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFrom time of {{embryonic}} emergence, the <b>gustatory</b> <b>papilla</b> types on the mammalian tongue have stereotypic anterior and posterior tongue locations. Furthermore, on anterior tongue, the fungiform papillae are patterned in rows. Among the many molecules that have potential roles in regulating papilla location and pattern, Sonic hedgehog (Shh) has been localized within early tongue and developing papillae. We used an embryonic, tongue organ culture system that retains temporal, spatial, and molecular characteristics of in vivo taste papilla morphogenesis and patterning {{to study the}} role of Shh in taste papilla development. Tongues from gestational day 14 rat embryos, when papillae {{are just beginning to}} emerge on dorsal tongue, were maintained in organ culture for 2 days. The steroidal alkaloids, cyclopamine and jervine, that specifically disrupt the Shh signaling pathway, or a Shh-blocking antibody were added to the standard culture medium. Controls included tongues cultured in the standard medium alone, and with addition of solanidine, an alkaloid that resembles cyclopamine structurally but that does not disrupt Shh signaling. In cultures with cyclopamine, jervine, or blocking antibody, fungiform papilla numbers doubled on the dorsal tongue with a distribution that essentially eliminated inter-papilla regions, compared with tongues in standard medium or solanidine. In addition, fungiform papillae developed on posterior oral tongue, just in front of and beside the single circumvallate papilla, regions where fungiform papillae do not typically develop. The Shh protein was in all fungiform papillae in embryonic tongues, and tongue cultures with standard medium or cyclopamine, and was conspicuously localized in the basement membrane region of the papillae. Ptc protein had a similar distribution to Shh, although the immunoproduct was more diffuse. Fungiform papillae did not develop on pharyngeal or ventral tongue in cyclopamine and jervine cultures, or in the tongue midline furrow, nor was development of the single circumvallate papilla altered. The results demonstrate a prominent role for Shh in fungiform papilla induction and patterning and indicate differences in morphogenetic control of fungiform and circumvallate papilla development and numbers. Furthermore, a previously unknown, broad competence of dorsal lingual epithelium to form fungiform papillae on both anterior and posterior oral tongue is revealed...|$|R
40|$|The Diabetes Mellitus II type is {{a chronic}} {{pathology}} {{typical of the}} third age. With {{the course of the}} illness the person affected by DM can present long term complications that aggravate the clinical picture. Systemic diseases such as the diabetes mellitus can influence very much the diet of the affected patient; and besides that the dehydration joined to the hyperglicemia, the neuropathy and the diabetic angiopathy can cause xerestomy. The saliva, important for the organization of the alimentary bolus, dissolving partly the food, makes possible a better contact with the <b>gustatory</b> <b>papillas</b> helping the taste perception, cleans and reduce the attachment of the plaque on dental surface and mucosas and makes better the attachment of the total prothesis to the mucous surface of the maxillaries. The hyposcialia makes difficult the deglutition and the mastication, reduces the prothesis retention and causes oral lesions of the mucosas given by backing lubrification. The absorption of food and its digestion as regard to a diabetic patient, can be modified by the presence of autonomic neuropathy that, even if not clinically evident, aims to increase the intestinal peristalsis up to phenomenon such as the ”diarrea diabeticorum”. A lack of metabolic compensation as we can deduce from the measurement of the HbA 1 c,can easily bring infections, micro and macroangiopathy, polyneuropathies,diabetic retinopathy proliferative and not, AOCAI,IRC, ulcers, phlegmous, osteomyelitis to lower limbs diabetic foot and soon. Some of these complications affect the stomatognathic apparatus with connected more frequency and aggressiveness of parodontopathies, easy gingival bleeding, microangiopathy of gingival tissue and profound paradontium, stomatodinia from neuropathy, disgeusia, xerestomy from hyperglycemia, and soon. All this can cause an untimely increase of dental mobility, evidence of loss of tissue of dental support, alveolar ligament-bone-radicul cement and consequently untimely loss of dental elements. Considering that the correct working of the masticatory apparatus is the first essential phase of a fit digestion, we can understand the importance of a proper dietetic and pharmacological diet that allows the patient to be compensated. The aim of this thesis, besides explaining the clinical pictures of DM, its long term complications and the consequences on the stomatognathic system, is to check whether or not in diabetic patients the deterioration of the chewing apparatus is bigger than in non diabetic persons.

40|$|To learn whether {{horseradish}} peroxidase (HRP) injections in <b>gustatory</b> <b>papillae</b> {{on the tongue}} {{can be used to}} study central topographical projections of taste buds and papillae, injections were made into the circumvallate papilla in rats. Labeled central projections after papilla injections were compared to projections after applying HRP to the cut glossopharyngeal nerve. Papilla injections result in HRP transport by afferent and efferent fibers of the glossopharyngeal nerve, and the pattern of central projections is similar to that after labeling the cut nerve. Projections include a separation in the brainstem of afferent, dorsally located fibers and efferent, ventrally located fibers. Afferent fibers project to the solitary nucleus and the trigeminal system. Efferent projections label muscle motorneurons in the nucleus ambiguus and the cells of origin of parasympathetic preganglionic fibers, which form the inferior salivatory nucleus. The parasympathetic neurons labeled after papilla projections are preganglionic fibers to Remak's ganglia in the tongue; postganglionic fibers of these ganglia are the secretomotor supply to the von Ebner's glands. In summary, injections of HRP into <b>gustatory</b> <b>papillae</b> reliably label central projections of the papilla and can be used for studies to discern topography in central projections of the taste system. Injections into the circumvallate papilla also have demonstrated that the parasympathetic neurons innervating von Ebner's glands are located in the inferior salivatory nucleus...|$|E

Immuno-staining experiments further indicated that TPH is localized both in gustatory fibers and in differentiated taste receptor cells.

40|$|Spacing {{patterns}} are of fundamental importance in various repeated structures which develop {{at regular intervals}} such as feathers, teeth and insect ommatidia. The mouse tongue develops a regular papilla pattern and provides a good model to study pattern formation. We examined the expression patterns of the signalling molecules, sonic hedgehog (Shh), bone morphogenetic proteins - 2 and - 4 (Bmp- 2 and Bmp- 4), and fibroblast growth factor- 8 (Fgf- 8) in mouse embryos between E 10. 5 and 15. We show that all four genes are expressed uniformly in the tongue epithelium between E 10. 5 and 11. At E 13, before morphologically detectable <b>gustatory</b> <b>papillae</b> initiation, Shh, Bmp- 2 and Bmp- 4 expression segregates into discrete spots, whereas, Fgf- 8 is downregulated. At E 14, small eminences in the anterior part of the tongue are the first morphological indications of fungiform papillae, and they express Shh and Bmp- 2, whereas, Bmp- 4 is almost absent in the tongue.

40|$|AbstractTaste buds on the {{anterior}} {{part of the}} tongue develop in conjunction with epithelial–mesenchymal specializations {{in the form of}} <b>gustatory</b> (taste) <b>papillae.</b> Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4 (BMP 4) are expressed in developing taste papillae, but the roles of these signaling molecules in specification of taste bud progenitors and in papillary morphogenesis are unclear. We show here that BMP 4 is not expressed in the early tongue, but is precisely coexpressed with Shh in papillary placodes, which serve as a signaling center for both gustatory and papillary development. To elucidate the role of Shh, we used an in vitro model of mouse fungiform papillary development {{to determine the effects of}} two functional inhibitors of Shh signaling: anti-Shh (5 E 1) antibody and cyclopamine. Cultured E 11. 5 tongue explants express Shh and BMP 4 LacZ in a pattern similar to that of intact embryos, localizing to developing papillary placodes after 2 days in culture. Tongues cultured with 5 E 1 antibody continue to express these genes in papillary patterns but develop more papillae that are larger and closer together than in controls. Tongues cultured with cyclopamine have a dose-dependent expansion of Shh and BMP 4 LacZ expression domains. Both antibody-treated and cyclopamine-treated tongue explants also are smaller than controls. Taken together, these results suggest that, although Shh is not involved in the initial specification of papillary placodes, Shh does play two key roles during pmcry development: (1) as a morphogen that directs cells toward a nonpapillary fate, and (2) as a mitogen, causing expansion of the interplacodal epithelium and underlying mesenchyme...|$|R
40|$|A {{possibility}} of efferent innervation of gustatory and mechanosensitive afferent fiber endings was studied in frog fungiform papillae with a suction electrode. The amplitude of antidromic impulses in a papillary afferent fiber induced by antidromically stimulating an afferent fiber of glossopharyngeal nerve (GPN) {{with low voltage}} pulses was inhibited for 40 s after the parasympathetic efferent fibers of GPN were stimulated orthodromically with high voltage pulses at 30 Hz for 10 s. This implies that electrical positivity of the outer surface of papillary afferent membrane was reduced by the efferent fiber-induced excitatory postsynaptic potential. The inhibition of afferent responses in the papillae was blocked by substance P receptor blocker, L- 703, 606, indicating that substance P is probably released from the efferent fiber terminals. Slow negative synaptic potential, which corresponded to a slow depolarizing synaptic potential, was extracellularly induced in papillary afferent terminals for 45 s by stimulating the parasympathetic efferent fibers of GPN with high voltage pulses at 30 Hz for 10 s. This synaptic potential was also blocked by L- 703, 606. These data indicate that papillary afferent fiber endings are innervated by parasympathetic efferent fibers.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the morphostructure of lingual papillae in Markhoz goat. Tissue samples were taken from the dorsal surfaces of the apex, body and root of the tongues of five adult goats. After routine procedure of preparation, the samples were observed under the scanning electron microscope. Three mechanical and tow <b>gustatory</b> types of <b>papillae</b> were seen. Filiform papillae were distributed on the dorsal surface of the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. A bulb-like structure formed the basal portion of the papilla. Between six and eight secondary papillae with sharp pointed tips emerged at the base of filiform papillae. The conical papillae were found on the torus linguae and elongated with a round base while their tips were blunt and sharp, differing structurally from the filiform papillae which posses larger size, a tip without projections and lack of secondary papillae. The round-shaped type I lenticular papillae had a flat surface whereas, those of the leaf-shaped type II lenticular papillae were protruded from the lingual surface with a blunt apex. The round to oval shaped vallate papillae on both rims of the torus linguae were encircled by a prominent gustatory furrow and a thick annular pad. The fungiform papillae were scattered among filiform papillae in the anterior two-thirds of the dorsal surface and each papilla was surrounded by a distict papillary groove.

40|$|AbstractMost fungiform {{taste buds}} fail to become innervated when BDNF or NT 4 is overexpressed in the basal layer of tongue epithelium. Here, we {{examined}} {{when and how}} overexpression of BDNF and NT 4 disrupt innervation to fungiform papillae. Overexpression of either factor disrupted chorda tympani innervation patterns either before or during the initial innervation of fungiform papillae. NT 4 and BDNF overexpression each disrupted initial innervation by producing different gustatory axon morphologies that emerge at distinct times (E 12. 5 and E 14. 5, respectively). Chorda tympani nerve branching was reduced in NT 4 overexpressing mice, and neuronal fibers in these mice were fasciculated and remained below the epithelial surface, as if repelled by NT 4 overexpression. In contrast, many chorda tympani nerve branches were observed near the epithelial surface in mice overexpressing BDNF, and most were attracted to and invaded non-taste filiform papillae instead of <b>gustatory</b> <b>papillae.</b> These results suggest that BDNF, but not NT 4, normally functions as a chemoattractant that allows chorda tympani fibers to distinguish their fungiform papillae targets from non-gustatory epithelium.

The herbivores chosen for this study belong to different taxonomic families and habitats, and hence, exhibit distinct foraging behaviors and diet preferences. We describe the first partial repertoires of T 2 R gene sequences for these species obtained by direct sequencing. We then consider the homology and evolutionary history of these receptors within this ruminant group, and whether it relates to feeding type classification, using MEGA software.

40|$|Taste buds on the {{mammalian}} tongue are {{confined to}} the epithelium of three types of gustatory papillae: the fungiform, circumvallate, and foliate. The <b>gustatory</b> <b>papillae</b> are composed of an epithelium that covers a broad connective tissue core, with extensive innervation to taste bud and nongustatory epithelial locations. Although the temporal sequence of gustatory papilla development is known for several species, factors that regulate initiation, growth, and maintenance of the papillae are not understood. We tested the hypothesis that sensory innervation {{is required for the}} initial formation and early morphogenesis of fungiform papillae in a patterned array. An organ culture of the embryonic rat tongue was developed to provide an in vitro system for studying mechanisms involved in fungiform papilla morphogenesis in patterns on the anterior tongue. Tongues were dissected from embryos at 13 days of gestation (E 13), a time when the tongue has not yet fully formed and <b>gustatory</b> <b>papillae</b> have not yet appeared, and at 14 days of gestation (E 14), when the tongue is well formed and papillae make their initial morphological appearance. Dissected tongues were maintained at the gas/liquid interface in standard organ culture dishes, fed with DMEM/F 12 plus 2 % B- 27 supplement and 1 % fetal bovine serum. After 1, 2, 3, or 6 days in culture, tongues were processed for scanning electron or light microscopy, or immunocytochemistry. Tongues cultured from E 13 or E 14 underwent extensive morphogenesis and growth in vitro. Furthermore, fungiform papillae developed on these tongues on a culture day equivalent to E 15 in vivo; that is, after 2 days for cultures begun at E 13 and 1 day for those begun at E 14. Because E 15 is the characteristic time for gustatory papilla formation in the intact embryo, results demonstrate that the cultured tongues retain important temporal information related to papilla development. In addition, fungiform papillae formed in the tongue cultures in the stereotypic pattern of rows. The papillae were large structures with epithelial and mesenchymal cell integrity, and an intact epithelial basement membrane was indicated with laminin immunoreactivity. The cultures demonstrate that gustatory papilla morphogenesis can progress {{in the absence of an}} intact sensory innervation. To exclude a potential developmental role for autonomic ganglion cells that are located in the posterior rat tongue, cultures consisting of only the anterior half of E 14 tongues were established. Fungiform papilla development progressed in half tongues in a manner directly comparable to whole tongue cultures. Therefore, robust, reproducible development of fungiform papillae in patterns is supported in rat tongue cultures from E 13 or E 14, without inclusion of intact sensory or major, posterior tongue autonomic ganglia. This is direct evidence that papillae will form and develop further in vitro without sensory ganglion support. The data also provide the first detailed account of in vitro development of the entire embryonic tongue. J. Comp. Neurol. 377 : 324 – 340, 1997. © 1997 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|E

Two groups were used in this study, twelve samples for anatomical study and ten samples for histological study, in each group of this study, the tongues were divided into four regions from apex {{to the end of}} the root. The tongue is a muscular organ which consists of dorsal and ventral surfaces, it is formed from three parts (apex, body and root). The lingual fossa and torus linguae both appear on the dorsal surface. The total average of the tongue length in adult animals (36. 00 ± 0. 97) cm while the highest average of the length, width and thickness found in the third region. The total length in small ages was (16. 92 ± 0. 98) cm and the highest average of length and thickness again it happens in third region and the highest width in this age group found in the second region. The investigation of the normal anatomical structures of the tongue distinguished four lingual papillae (filiform, fungiform, conical and circumvalate) while the lenticuler papillae absent in both age groups. The filiform and fungiform papillae spread over the dorsal surface and ventro-lateral surface terminat abruptly at the ventro-lateral border forming a distinct straight line from apex to the torus linguae in both ages. The present work reveals that the highest average of filiform papillae in both surface (dorsal and ventro-lateral surface) founds in second region in adult group, while in small group founds in first region. The highest average of fungiform papillae in both surface of both age groups are in the apex of tongue. The highest average of conical and circumvalate papillae in both age group (adult and young) were on torus linguae. The histological study has been used the shape, diameter and the type of epithelium which covered the papillae in both groups. The filiform papillae are long fine projection beading back word with highest average of diameter in both age groups occuring in the third region. The epithelium covering these papillae is keratinized stratified squamus epithelium. No trace of connective tissue core has been found in these papillae. The fungiform papillae in both ages take the shape of small rounded projection, containing taste buds in adult group only. The highest average diameter located in the third region of both groups. These papillae are covered by mildly keratinized stratified squamus epithelium. The conical papillae in both age groups exist on the dorsal surface in the torus linguae as a conical projections in different sizes. The large sized papilla located towards the side edges of the tongue whereas the smaller sized ones spread along mid-dorsal. This gives them "V" shape pattern, with apex towards the front. These papillae covered by highly keratinized stratified squamus epithelium with a connective tissue core. The circumvalate papillae exist on the dorso-lateral surface, on the end of the torus linguae and the beginning of the root, in two irregular rows on either side. The diameter of these papillae peaks in the third region in the adult group whereas in young group it peaks in the fourth region. These papillae are surrounded by gustatory groove. In adult groups, unlike the young group, there could exist more than one <b>papillae</b> in each <b>gustatory</b> groove.

The deficits were found throughout the tongue and all <b>gustatory</b> <b>papillae.</b> There was a significant loss of fungiform papillae and the papillae were smaller in size compared to BDNF −/− and wild-type mice. Circumvallate papillae in the double knockouts were smaller and did not contain any intraepithelial nerve fibers. BDNF −/− x NT- 3 −/− mice exhibited additive losses in both somatosensory and gustatory innervation indicating that BDNF and NT- 3 exert specific roles in the innervation of the tongue. However, the additional loss of fungiform papillae and taste buds in BDNF −/− x NT- 3 −/− mice compared to single BDNF knockout mice indicate a synergistic functional role for both BDNF-dependent gustatory and NT- 3 -dependent somatosensory innervations in taste bud and taste papillae innervation and development...|$|E
40|$|Geniculate axons are {{initially}} guided to discrete epithelial placodes in the lingual and palatal epithelium that subsequently differentiate into taste buds. In vivo approaches {{show that}} {{brain-derived neurotrophic factor}} (BDNF) mRNA is concentrated in these placodes, that BDNF is necessary for targeting taste afferents to these placodes, and that BDNF misexpression disrupts guidance. We used an in vitro approach to determine whether BDNF may act directly on geniculate axons as a trophic factor and as an attractant, and {{whether there is a}} critical period for responsiveness to BDNF. We show that BDNF promotes neurite outgrowth from geniculate ganglion explants dissected from embryonic day (E) 15, E 18, infant, and adult rats cultured in collagen gels, {{and that there is a}} concentration optimum for neurite extension. Gradients of BDNF derived from slow-release beads caused the greatest bias in neurite outgrowth at E 15, when axons approach the immature <b>gustatory</b> <b>papillae.</b> Further, neurites advanced faster toward the BDNF bead than away from it, even if the average amount of neurotrophic factor encountered was the same. We also found that neurites that contact BDNF beads did not advance beyond them. At E 18, when axons would be penetrating pregustatory epithelium in vivo, BDNF continued to exert a tropic effect on geniculate neurites. However, at postnatal and adult stages, the influence of BDNF was predominantly trophic. Our data support a role for BDNF acting as an attractant for geniculate axons during a critical period that encompasses initial targeting but not at later stages...|$|E
40|$|The {{sense of}} taste is {{fundamental}} to our ability to ingest nutritious substances and to detect and avoid potentially toxic ones. Sensory taste buds are housed in papillae that develop from epithelial placodes. Three distinct types of <b>gustatory</b> <b>papillae</b> reside on the rodent tongue: small fungiform papillae {{are found in the}} anterior tongue, whereas the posterior tongue contains the larger foliate papillae and a single midline circumvallate papilla (CVP). Despite the great variation in the number of CVPs in mammals, its importance in taste function, and its status as the largest of the taste papillae, very {{little is known about the}} development of this structure. Here, we report that a balance between Sprouty (Spry) genes and Fgf 10, which respectively antagonize and activate receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling, regulates the number of CVPs. Deletion of Spry 2 alone resulted in duplication of the CVP as a result of an increase in the size of the placode progenitor field, and Spry 1 (-/-);Spry 2 (-/-) embryos had multiple CVPs, demonstrating the redundancy of Sprouty genes in regulating the progenitor field size. By contrast, deletion of Fgf 10 led to absence of the CVP, identifying FGF 10 as the first inductive, mesenchyme-derived factor for taste papillae. Our results provide the first demonstration of the role of epithelial-mesenchymal FGF signaling in taste papilla development, indicate that regulation of the progenitor field size by FGF signaling is a critical determinant of papilla number, and suggest that the great variation in CVP number among mammalian species may be linked to levels of signaling by the FGF pathway...|$|E
40|$|The {{sense of}} taste plays an {{important}} role in the evaluation of the nutrient composition of consumed food. Bitter taste in particular is believed to serve a warning function against the ingestion of poisonous substances. In the past years enormous progress was made in the characterization of bitter taste receptors, including their gene expression patterns, pharmacological features and presumed physiological roles in gustatory as well as in non-gustatory tissues. However, due to a lack in TAS 2 R-specifc antibodies the localization of receptor proteins within gustatory tissues has never been analyzed. In the present study we have screened a panel of commercially available antisera raised against human bitter taste receptors by immunocytochemical experiments. One of these antisera was found to be highly specific for the human bitter taste receptor TAS 2 R 38. We further demonstrate that this antibody is able to detect heterologously expressed TAS 2 R 38 protein on Western blots. The antiserum is, however, not able to interfere significantly with TAS 2 R 38 function in cell based calcium imaging analyses. Most importantly, we were able to demonstrate the presence of TAS 2 R 38 protein in human <b>gustatory</b> <b>papillae.</b> Using double immunofluorescence we show that TAS 2 R 38 -positive cells form a subpopulation of PLCbeta 2 expressing cells. On a subcellular level the localization of this bitter taste receptor is neither restricted to the cell surface nor particularly enriched at the level of the microvilli protruding into the pore region of the taste buds, but rathe...|$|E
40|$|The {{morphology}} of the dorsal lingual papillae of {{the adult}} Goitered gazelle was examined by scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy. On the dorsal surface of the lingual mucosa, three types of mechanical papillae and two types of <b>gustatory</b> <b>papillae</b> were observed. Numerous filiform papillae covered the entire surface of the lingual apex and body except for the lingual torus of the dorsal lingual surface. The structure and size of filiform papillae vary in the apex and body parts of the tongue. Two types of lenticular papillae were observed including rounded type papillae in the anterior median portion and half-cut pyramid shaped papillae in the posterior median portion of the lingual torus. Conical papillae were distributed on {{all parts of the}} lingual torus excluding the median plane and were also observed on the root of the tongue. Fungiform papillae, dispersed the lingual apex and body and the lateral sides of the lingual torus, display regional variation in structure and size. The smaller papillae on the lingual apex and body were mainly located along the sides of the tongue among filiform papillae while the larger papillae on the lateral and posterior parts of the lingual torus were located among conical papillae and had a convex surface. Large fungiform papillae lacked taste buds. The number of vallate papillae was 26 in the caudolateral region of the lingual torus. These papillae were observed to have a compact structure and to possess shallow grooves. No foliate papillae were seen on the dorsal surface...|$|E

Due to its diet {{and the lack of}} literature on the morphological aspect of Xenarthras, five Bradypus variegatus tongues from animals which died from natural causes were evaluated, and they came from Pará State Museum Emílio Goeldi and were donated to the Laboratory of Animal Morphological Research (LaPMA) from UFRA, for revealing the different types of papillae and epithelial-connective tissue. Macroscopically, the tongues presented elongated shape, rounded apex, body, root, median sulcus in the root's apex, and two vallate papillae. The mucous membrane of the tongue revealed a keratinized stratified pavement epithelium, while the ventral surface of the tongue was thin and smooth, not provided with any type of papillae. However, the dorsal surface of the tongue was irregular with the presence of three types of papillae: filiform, fungiform and vallate papillae. The filiform papillae found were of a simple type, presenting a rounded base, irregularly distributed with a larger concentration and development on the tongue's apex and body. The fungiform papilla showed a practically smooth surface with irregular format, with the presence of gustatory pores; these were found all over the dorsal surface, with larger concentration at the rostral part of the apex. Only two vallate papillae were observed disposed in the root of the tongue, surrounded by a deep groove, and revealing several taste buds. The tongues from Bradypus variegatus presented <b>gustatory</b> <b>papillae</b> similar to the ones described for other Xenarthras species and wild mammals...|$|E
40|$|Neurotrophins, {{neurotrophin}} receptors and sensory neurons {{are required}} {{for the development of}} lingual sense organs. For example, neurotrophin 3 sustains lingual somatosensory neurons. In the traditional view, sensory axons will terminate where neurotrophin expression is most pronounced. Yet, lingual somatosensory axons characteristically terminate in each filiform papilla and in each somatosensory prominence within a cluster of cells expressing the p 75 neurotrophin receptor (p 75 NTR), rather than terminating among the adjacent cells that secrete neurotrophin 3. The p 75 NTR on special specialized clusters of epithelial cells may promote axonal arborization in vivo since its over-expression by fibroblasts enhances neurite outgrowth from overlying somatosensory neurons in vitro. Two classical observations have implicated gustatory neurons in the development and maintenance of mammalian taste buds—the early arrival times of embryonic innervation and the loss of taste buds after their denervation in adults. In the modern era more than a dozen experimental studies have used early denervation or neurotrophin gene mutations to evaluate mammalian gustatory organ development. Necessary for taste organ development, brain-derived neurotrophic factor sustains developing gustatory neurons. The cardinal conclusion is readily summarized: taste buds in the palate and tongue are induced by innervation. Taste buds are unstable: the death and birth of taste receptor cells relentlessly remodels synaptic connections. As receptor cells turn over, the sensory code for taste quality is probably stabilized by selective synapse formation between each type of gustatory axon and its matching taste receptor cell. We anticipate important new discoveries of molecular interactions among the epithelium, the underlying mesenchyme and gustatory innervation that build the <b>gustatory</b> <b>papillae,</b> their specialized epithelial cells, and the resulting taste buds...|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{molecular}} factors orchestrate {{the development}} of the peripheral taste system. The unique anatomy/function of the taste system makes this system ideal for understanding the mechanisms by which these factors function; yet the taste system is underutilized for this role. This review focuses on some of the many factors that are known to regulate gustatory development, and discusses a few topics where more work is needed. Some attention is given to factors that regulate epibranchial placode formation, since gustatory neurons are thought to be primarily derived from this region. Epibranchial placodes appear to arise from a pan-placodal region and a number of regulatory factors control the differentiation of individual placodes. Gustatory neuron differentiation is regulated by a series of transcription factors and perhaps bone morphongenic proteins (BMP). As neurons differentiate, they also proliferate such that their numbers exceed those in the adult, and this is followed by developmental death. Some of these cell-cycling events are regulated by neurotrophins. After gustatory neurons become post-mitotic, axon outgrowth occurs. Axons are guided by multiple chemoattractive and chemorepulsive factors, including semaphorins, to the tongue epithelium. Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), functions as a targeting factor {{in the final stages of}} axon guidance and is required for gustatory axons to find and innervate taste epithelium. Numerous factors are involved in {{the development of}} <b>gustatory</b> <b>papillae</b> including Sox- 2, Sonic hedge hog and Wnt-β-catenin signaling. It is likely that just as many factors regulate taste bud differentiation; however, these factors have not yet been identified. Studies examining the molecular factors that regulate terminal field formation in the nucleus of the solitary tract are also lacking. However, it is possible that some of the factors that regulate geniculate ganglion development, outgrowth, guidance and targeting of peripheral axons may have the same functions in the gustatory CNS...|$|E
40|$|Sensory ganglia that {{innervate}} {{taste buds}} and <b>gustatory</b> <b>papillae</b> (geniculate and petrosal) are reduced in volume by about 40 % in mice with a targeted deletion {{of the gene}} for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). In contrast, the trigeminal ganglion, which innervates papillae but not taste buds on the anterior tongue, is reduced by only about 18 %. These specific alterations in ganglia that innervate taste organs make possible a test for roles of lingual innervation {{in the development of}} appropriate number, morphology, and spatial pattern of fungiform and circumvallate papillae and associated taste buds. We studied tongues of BDNF null mutant and wild-type littermates and made quantitative analyses of all fungiform papillae on the anterior tongue, the single circumvallate papilla on the posterior tongue, and all taste buds in both papilla types. Fungiform papillae and taste buds were reduced in number by about 60 % and were substantially smaller in diameter in mutant mice 15 – 25 days postnatal. Remaining fungiform papillae were selectively concentrated in the tongue tip region. The circumvallate papilla was reduced in diameter and length by about 40 %, and papilla morphology was disrupted. Taste bud number in the circumvallate was reduced by about 70 % in mutant tongues, and the remaining taste buds were smaller than those on wild-type tongues. Our results demonstrate a selective dependence of taste organs on a full complement of appropriate innervation for normal growth and morphogenesis. Effects on papillae are not random but are more pronounced in specific lingual regions. Although the geniculate and petrosal ganglia sustain at least half of their normal complement of cell number in BDNF −/− mice, remaining ganglion cells do not substitute for lost neurons to rescue taste organs at control numbers. Whereas gustatory ganglia and the taste papillae initially form independently, our results suggest interdependence in later development because ganglia derive BDNF support from target organs and papillae require sensory innervation for morphogenesis.

40|$|Many studies {{demonstrate}} that differentiation of certain sensory receptors during development is induced by their nerve supply. Thus the navigational accuracy of pioneering fibres to their targets {{is crucial to}} this process. The special gustatory elements of the facial and glossopharyngeal nerves are used extensively as model systems in this field. We examined the chorda tympani, the gustatory component of the facial nerve, to determine the precise time course of its development in mice. The transganglionic fluorescent tracer DiI was injected into the anterior aspect of the mandibular arch of fixed embryos aged between 30 and 50 somites (E 10 –E 12). It was allowed to diffuse retrogradely via the geniculate ganglion to the brainstem for 4 wk, before the distribution of DiI was determined using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Geniculate ganglion cells were first labelled at the 34 somite stage (E 10). Pioneering chorda tympani fibres that arise from these cells passed peripherally and followed an oblique course as they grew towards the mandibular arch. At the 36 somite stage (E 10. 5), the peripheral component followed an intricate postspiracular course and passed anteriorly to arch over the primitive tympanic cavity, {{en route to the}} lingual epithelium. From the 36 to 50 somite stages (E 10. 5 –E 12), it consistently traced in the fashion of a ‘U’ bend. The central fascicle also traced at the 36 somite stage (E 10. 5) and just made contact with the brainstem. At the 40 somite stage (E 11), the central fibres clearly chose a route of descent into the spinal trigeminal tract and branched into the solitary tract. Pioneering chorda tympani fibres contact the lingual epithelium when the target is primordial. The lingual epithelium may be a source of a neurotropic factor that attracts peripheral chorda tympani fibres to the sites of putative papillae. However, the chorda tympani is probably not a vital influence on the subsequent differentiation of <b>gustatory</b> <b>papillae,</b> since the papillae are elaborated 5 d later at E 15 in murine embryos. The early morphology of the nerve is true to the amniote vertebrate phenotype...|$|E
40|$|Brain-derived {{neurotrophic}} factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin- 3 (NT- 3) mRNAs {{are expressed in}} the developing rat tongue and taste organs in specific spatiotemporal patterns. BDNF mRNA {{is present in the}} early lingual gustatory papilla epithelium, from which taste buds eventually arise, prior to the arrival of gustatory nerve fibers at the epithelium, whereas NT- 3 initially distributes in the mesenchyme. However, a direct test for neural dependence of neurotrophin expression on the presence of innervation in tongue has not been made, nor is it known whether the patterns of neurotrophin expression can be replicated in an in vitro system. Therefore, we used a tongue organ culture model that supports taste papilla formation while eliminating the influence from sensory nerve fibers, to study neurotrophin mRNAs in lingual tissues. Rat tongue cultures were begun at embryonic day 13 or 14 (E 13, E 14), and BDNF, NT- 3, nerve growth factor (NGF) and neurotrophin- 4 (NT- 4) mRNAs were studied at 0, 2, 3 and 6 days in culture. BDNF transcripts were localized in the gustatory epithelium of both developing fungiform and circumvallate papillae after 2 or 3 days in culture, and NT- 3 transcripts were in the subepithelial mesenchyme. The neurotrophin distributions were comparable to those in vivo at E 13 –E 16. In 6 -day tongue cultures, however, BDNF transcripts in anterior tongue were not restricted to fungiform papillae but were more widespread in the lingual epithelium, while the circumvallate trench epithelium exhibited restricted BDNF labeling. The NT- 3 expression pattern shifted in 6 -day organ cultures in a manner comparable to that in the embryo in vivo, and was expressed in the lingual epithelium as well as mesenchyme. NGF mRNA expression was subepithelial throughout 6 days in cultures. NT- 4 mRNA was not detected. The neurotrophin mRNA distributions demonstrate that temporospatial localization of neurotrophins observed during development in vivo is retained in the embryonic tongue organ culture system. Furthermore, initial neurotrophin expression in the developing lingual epithelium, mesenchyme, and/or taste papillae is not dependent on intact sensory innervation. We suggest that patterns of lingual neurotrophin mRNA expression are controlled by the influence of local tissue interactions within the tongue at early developmental stages. However, the eventual loss of restricted BDNF mRNA localization from fungiform papillae in anterior tongue suggests that sensory innervation may be important for restricting the localized expression of neurotrophins at later developmental stages, and for maintaining the unique phenotypes of <b>gustatory</b> <b>papillae...</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Gustatory</b> <b>papillae</b> {{are complex}} organs that are {{composed}} of 1) an epithelium, 2) specialized sensory cells within the epithelium (the taste buds), 3) a broad connective core, and 4) sensory innervation. During papilla development, cells in the various tissue compartments must divide, aggregate, detach, migrate, and reaggregate in relation to each other, but factors that regulate such steps are poorly understood and have not been extensively studied. All of these processes potentially require participation of the extracellular matrix. Therefore, we have studied temporal and spatial patterns of immunoreactivity for two extracellular matrix molecules, tenascin and laminin, in the developing fungiform and circumvallate papillae of fetal, perinatal, and adult sheep tongue. To determine relations of tenascin and laminin to sensory innervation, we used an antibody to growth-associated protein (GAP- 43) to label growing nerves. Immunocytochemical distributions of tenascin and laminin alter during development {{in a manner that}} reflects morphogenesis rather than histologic boundaries of the taste papillae. In early fungiform papillae, tenascin immunoreactivity is very weak within the mesenchyme of the papilla core. However, there is a subsequent shift to an intense, restricted localization in the apical papilla core only—directly under taste bud-bearing regions of the papilla epithelium. In early circumvallate papillae, tenascin immunoreactivity is patchy within the papilla core and within the flanking, nongustatory papillae. Later, immunoreactivity is restricted to the perimeter of the central papilla core, under epithelium that contains developing taste buds. In fungiform and circumvallate papillae, the shift in tenascin immunolocalization is associated with periods of taste bud formation and multiplication within the papilla epithelium and with extensive branching of the sensory innervation in the papilla apex. Laminin immunoreactivity, although it is continuous throughout the basement membrane of general lingual epithelium, is interrupted in the epithelial basement membrane of early fungiform and circumvallate papillae in regions where taste buds are forming. The breaks are large in young fetuses, when taste buds first develop, and are evidenced later as punctate disruptions. Heparan sulfate proteoglycan immunoreactivity confirms that these are basement membrane discontinuities. GAP- 43 label coincides with innervation of the papilla core and is most extensive in regions where tenascin immunoreactivity is weak or absent. GAP- 43 immunoreactivity is also found in early taste buds: Later, it is extensive within more mature multiple taste buds, presumably in relation to synaptogenesis. We propose that tenascin has a role in promoting deadhesion of cells in the papilla epithelium during periods of taste bud formation and multiplication. Discontinuities in the epithelial basement membrane under developing taste buds, indicated with laminin and heparan sulfate proteoglycan immunoreactivity, may interact to facilitate taste bud morphogenesis and multiplication, to permit access of papilla innervation to the forming taste buds, and/or to allow epithelial/mesenchymal interactions during papilla and taste bud development. © 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|E
40|$|Background: Chemosensory {{disorders}} affect approximately 15 % of the U. S. {{population and}} an estimated 200, 000 individuals visit a doctor each year for problems with their ability to taste or smell (NIDCD). Among the common causes of taste problems are radiation therapy, chemotherapy, exposure to certain chemicals and medications, head trauma and surgical injuries. Tastants are detected by taste buds, which are specialized collections of cells. Taste bud development and innervation has been an active research front and several key molecules involved in these processes have been elucidated. Neurotrophins, in particular brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin- 3 (NT- 3) {{were among the first}} to be identified as playing a role in taste buds. BDNF and NT- 3 are expressed in developing and adult rodent tongues in a temporospatially specific manner. BDNF mRNA is found in the gustatory epithelium during development and in adult taste buds, NT- 3 mRNA in the surrounding epithelium in rodents. Neurotrophins are also expressed in a temporospatially specific manner during tooth morphogenesis. Nerve growth factor (NGF), BDNF and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) are expressed in developing rodent teeth. Aims: To examine the expression of mRNA encoding neurotrophic factors in the developing human taste system and teeth, to assess the role of neurotrophic factors in the formation and innervation of taste buds and teeth, and to explore possible consequences of neurotrophic factor expression in cultured dental pulp cells (DPCs). Results: Neurotrophic factor expression patterns are described in the developing human tongue and compared to those of rodents. BDNF was found in the first-trimester in the same areas as in rodents; developing gustatory epithelium and taste buds, and in additional areas such as the subepithelial mesenchyme. Human NT- 3 mRNA expression patterns were largely similar to those of rodents, except that taste buds also expressed NT- 3 mRNA during development and in adults. In both rodents and humans, BDNF was expressed prior to innervation of <b>gustatory</b> <b>papillae,</b> and thus serves as a very early marker of the gustatory epithelium. Our study showed wider expression patterns of both BDNF and NT- 3 in the human gustatory system (paper I) compared to rodents. Next, we showed that taste papillae in BDNF/NT- 3 double KO mice were smaller and less innervated compared to BDNF-/- mice, indicating specific gustatory roles for both neurotrophins (paper V). Studies of developing human teeth showed that NGF, BDNF, NT- 3, neurotrophin- 4 (NT- 4), GDNF and neurturin (NTN) were expressed in the tooth organ and surrounding mesenchyme (paper III). Interactions of neurotrophic factors from the dental pulp and trigeminal, motor and dopamine (DA) neurons were analyzed. DPCs promoted survival and neurite outgrowth from trigeminal neurons in cocultures, and prolonged neural survival in vitro. DPCs also promoted motoneuron survival in a rodent model of spinal cord injury (paper II), as well as the survival of embryonic DA neurons in vitro (paper IV). BDNF is the main neurotrophic factor in the gustatory system, but NT- 3 plays a role as well in both humans and rodents, which knockout studies were able to detect. The tooth provides an excellent model to study molecular events in cells during organ formation, and to examine how neurotrophic factors promote innervation during development...|$|E
