Also back in Rouen in 2017 were Venezuelans Larry Infante and Jonathan <b>Jaspe.</b> Infante returned for his third season with the club, while <b>Jaspe,</b> MVP of both the Challenge de France and All-Star Game in 2016, returned for a second season with the Huskies. The rest of the lineup featured familiar faces Dylan Gleeson at catcher, Luc Piquet and Maxime Lefevre in the infield.

5000|$|Following a very {{successful}} 2015 season, Keino Perez's Rouen Huskies kept their spot {{at the top of}} the French League. After losing Boris Marche and David Gauthier (retirement) along with Quentin Becquey, Jeffrey McKenzie and Kevin Lusson, the Huskies managed to finish first yet again with a 24-3 regular season record in 2016. Rouen welcomed back longtime French National team pitcher Anthony Piquet, who won three titles with the club from 2010-2012. Along with Piquet, the pitching staff was composed of Owen Ozanich, Yoann Vaugelade, Marc-Andre Habeck, Pablo Ossandon, Esteban Prioul and Keino Perez. Dylan Gleeson and Venezuelan slugger Jonathan <b>Jaspe</b> (2016 Challenge de France MVP & FFBS All-Star Game MVP) were the Huskies primary catchers. Arthur Paturel started the majority of the games at first base and hit [...]338 on the season. Team captain Luc Piquet played second, while Venezuelan slugger Larry Infante manned shortstop, taking home the 2016 Batting Title. French National team third baseman Maxime Lefevre played the hot corner. The outfield featured Andrew Medeiros (.368, 3 HR, 22 SB), Kenji Hagiwara, Oscar Combes, Derek Cornell and Bastien Dagneau, with Sebastien Duchossoy getting the majority of his at bats as DH for 2016 Huskies. Along with finishing first in the regular season, the Huskies swept through the Challenge de France, beating Clermond-Ferrand, Toulouse, Montpellier and Senart behind very strong pitching (0.26 team ERA). Along with <b>Jaspe</b> being named MVP of the Challenge, Ozanich was named best pitcher after throwing a one-hit shutout against Montpellier. Yoann Vaugelade pitched seven strong innings to top Senart in the final. In June's CEB Cup hosted in Rouen, the Huskies won all five games to capture the cup. They beat fellow French team Montpellier 5-2 in the final. Rouen's Larry Infante was named tournament MVP after hitting 3 home runs in the five games, Owen Ozanich won best pitcher after his complete game shutout against Karlovac. To recap the 2016 regular season, Infante was the league's top hitter, Medeiros led the FFBS in runs scored, and Ozanich led in wins, WHIP and ERA.|$|E

A certain Fr Peguero, who was the vicar of San Juan, described the shrine as [...] "the biggest in the Islands and the refuge and consolation of all." [...] He described the shrine further as [...] "built on a mountain of solid rock and, thanks to that, it had not been damaged by earthquakes. It has been repaired well recently. It is all — the convent and the church — of stone quarry, and both are strong, firm, beautiful and devout. All in all they are the most perfect structures (of their kind) that exist in the Philippines." [...] He further notes: [...] "It is all painted al oleo en <b>jaspe</b> (imitation marble) from the floor to the ceiling and adorned with many Latin and Spanish verses and texts from the Holy Scriptures. There are three altars with artistic and proportionate retablos. It has five rich ternos — some better than others — and six ordinary ones.

Between the Serra da Arrábida and the western Montes de Azeitão, is the Vale de Picheleiros, that continue from the Vale da Ribeira da Ajuda to Várzea da Comenda. There is also the Vale do Solitário, between the coastal flanks of Arrábida and the Cabeços do <b>Jaspe</b> and Guincho, and the Vale da Vitória, in the subplateau of the Serra do Risco. The coast from Sesimbra and Alpertuche is more varied and elevated then the Cabo Espichel until Sesimbra. The coast, generally elevated and abrupt, is 380 m at the Alto do Píncaro, with rare and small beaches and coves, mostly accessible by boat. From Alpertuche to Outão the coast is less elevated resulting in more beaches, such as the bay of Portinho or Chã da Anixa, a small platform only metres above the sea. But, generally, the lands are inclined, principally along {{the north and south}}, but predominately along the coast. Slopes in these areas of the Serra da Arrabida, Serra de Ares, Serra de Riscoa and Serra de São Luís exceed 30%, including the Vale da Rasca, Comenda, Vale do Alto da Madalena until Portela da Sardinha and areas along the north and south of the Serra de São Francisco and Serra de Louro.|$|E
40|$|The {{dark blue}} and white <b>jaspe</b> (ikat) rebozo is a {{traditional}} shawl-like garment still worn daily in Mexico by many women and girls, especially in the State of Oaxaca. Formerly,this type of rebozo was mainly produced locally in tatteres (workshops) in Oaxaca. Now such rebozos are almost entirely made in other centers, most probably Tenancingo and Chilapa de Guerrero, and brought into Oaxaca. When asked {{about the number of}} <b>jaspe</b> reboceros in Oaxaca in former times, informants would reply 2 ̆ 2 a lot, 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 many. 2 ̆ 2 By the early 19602 ̆ 7 s, eight of these remained. Not only had other types of weaving become more profitable and less labor intensive, {{but there is also a}} possibility that a decline in the wearing of the traditional <b>jaspe</b> rebozo had contracted the market. While the rebozo is romanticized and seen as part of national and state costume, it is also seen as representing rural attitudes and a lack of modernity. For example, young girls are discouraged from wearing rebozos at school. Today, only one maestro of <b>jaspe</b> lives and works in Oaxaca, Fidel Diaz Valencia. In video interviews conducted in May/June 1990 together with Pamela Scheinman, Don Fidel tells of his life as a weaver, and pocotero (seller) of rebozos. He explains and demonstrates the <b>jaspe</b> technique. This material is presented as a thirty minute video which also includes photographs of Don Fidel taken by researchers from the San Diego Museum of Man in 1963, as well as a meeting of Don Fidel with representatives from a Oaxacan governmental agency, concerning the continuation of this weaving tradition.

In executing the <b>jaspe</b> patterns, they are broken down into like design component elements which are grouped together to minimize the vast amount of tieing, then placed back in the original order at the time of assembling the warp for weaving. Similarity of such complex technique in Peru and Ecuador may point to diffusion via trade in Hispanic America. Conceptually this process provides a good example of sophisticated non-verbal manipulation. Beyond technique, the rebozo in Mexican culture has a strong semiotic significance in terms of national identity and religion. The twentieth century Mexican artist and folklorist, Dr. Atl suggested that as the characteristic mestiza garment which is worn throughout the population, the rebozo could be the national flag (Murillo 1922). The history of the origin of the <b>jaspe</b> rebozo is quite speculative; often observers and travellers speak in general terms about cloth and garments rather than discuss the nuances of technique. Bernal Dfaz del Castillo speaks of seeing in the Texcoco market in 1524 : 2 ̆ 2 many sorts of spun cotton in hanks of every color, and it seems like the silk market at Granada, except that there is much greater quantity 2 ̆ 2 (Diaz del Castillo 1956 : 213 - 16).

40|$|The {{history of}} rebozos and <b>jaspe</b> (ikat) in Mexico still {{presents}} many enigmas and fertile field for research. Public and private collections in Mexican and foreign museums preserve {{a variety of}} rebozos from the mid- 18 th through the 20 th centuries. However, it has been complicated to correlate these extant pieces with exact places of production and dates. Other sources such as written accounts and images focus mostly on their social uses, sometimes places of production or sale are merely mentioned yet techniques and designs are the information least dealt with. Virginia Davis mentions this problem while analyzing the Frederick Church collection at the Olana Estate in the following terms, “the lack of a gamut of authenticated examples for each makes attribution difficult. 2 With the purpose of providing new clues for the historiography of the rebozo de <b>jaspe</b> (ikat) and other variants, and contribute to deciphering {{a part of the}} puzzle, this essay is based on a fragment of a chart published in the monthly trade journal El Correo del Comercio in October 1871, 3 under the title Efectos Nacionales (National Goods).

We present documentary information to back up our attribution proposals, as well as discussing their implications.
