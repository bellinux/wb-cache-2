40|$|Many {{peptides}} containing tryptophan have therapeutic {{uses and}} can be studied by their fluorescent properties. The biological activity of these peptides involves interactions with many cellular components and micelles can function as carriers inside organisms. We report results from the interaction of small peptides containing tryptophan with several microheterogeneous systems: sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) micelles; sodium dodecyl sulphate-poly(ethylene oxide) (SDS-PEO) aggregates; and neutral polymeric micelles. We observed that specific parameters, such as wavelength of maximum emission and fluorescence anisotropy, {{could be used to}} ascertain the occurrence of interactions. Affinity constants were determined from changes in the intensity of emission while structural modifications in rotameric conformations were verified from time-resolved measurements. Information about the location and diffusion of peptides in the microheterogeneous systems were obtained from tryptophan <b>emission</b> <b>quenching</b> <b>experiments</b> using N-alkylpyridinium ions.

In this manuscript, the guanosine triphosphate (GTP) -selective oxidation is reported using the network polymers composed of polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS). We synthesized the water-soluble POSS network polymer containing the naphthyridine ligands to capture GTP inside the networks and the ruthenium complexes to oxidize the captured GTP under light irradiation.

40|$|Proton-coupled {{electron}} transfer (PCET) {{is a critical}} mechanism in biology, underpinning key processes such as radical transport, energy transduction, and enzymatic substrate activation. Ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) rely on PCET to mediate the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of DNA precursors. E. coli class Ia RNR consists of two dimeric subunits: [alpha]₂ contains the active site, while [beta]₂ contains a stable diferric-tyrosyl radical cofactor. During turnover, transport occurs over 35 Ȧ, from Y₁₂₂ in [beta]₂ to C₄₃₉ in [alpha]₂) where an active-site thiyl radical mediates turnover. Radical transport is proposed to occur over a series of highly conserved redox-active amino acids, including Y₃₅₆ in [beta]₂,and Y₇₃₁ and Y₇₃₀ in [alpha]₂. This thesis examines three subject areas of PCET that pertain to RNR: Small-molecule model systems provide insights into tyrosine oxidation and radical generation. Under physiological conditions, tyrosine oxidation is accompanied by deprotonation and occurs by PCET. A critical factor in PCET reactions is the nature ofthe proton acceptor and the presence ofhydrogen bonding. In a modular model system, pyridyl-amino acid-methyl esters are appended to rhenium(I) tricarbonyl phenanthroline to yield rhenium-amino acid complexes. In dichloromethane solution, bases coordinate to tyrosine by hydrogen bonding. Emission kinetics reveal base-dependent oxidation by PCET. A photopeptide composed of the 19 C-terminal residues of [beta]₂, fluorinated tyrosine in place of Y₃₅₆, and a rhenium(I) bipyridine photooxidant enables photoinitated radical transport into [alpha]₂. Transient absorption kinetics show rapid radical transport (10 ⁵ s-¹) that is only observed when both Y₇₃₁ and Y₇₃₀, are present, suggesting a critical role for the Y₇₃₁-Y₇₃₀, dyad for radical transport in RNR. An intact, photochemical [beta]₂ enables studies of an [alpha]₂:[beta]₂ complex. A bromomethylpyridine rhenium(I) phenanthroline photooxidant labels a single surface-cysteine mutant of [beta]₂ at position 355 to yield [Re]- [beta]₂. Under flash-quench conditions, transient absorption reveals a tyrosine radical. [Re] -[beta]₂ binds [alpha]₂ and is capable of light-initiated substrate turnover. Transient <b>emission</b> <b>quenching</b> <b>experiments</b> reveal Y₃₅₆ oxidation that {{is dependent on the}} presence of Y₇₃₁ in [alpha]₂.

40|$|The extracytoplasmic {{function}} (ECF) {{sigma factor}} SigR (σ R) is a bacterial transcription factor {{involved in the}} regulation of cytosolic redox homeostasis in Streptomyces coelicolor. SigR activity is regulated by its cognate anti-sigma factor RsrA. RsrA {{is a member of}} the zinc-anti-sigma (ZAS) family, which in its reduced state binds a single Zn 2 + ion coordinated by 3 cysteine residues and a histidine. RsrA senses oxidative stress within the cytosol and responds by the formation of intramolecular disulphide bonds between its Zn-ligating cysteine residues. This results in the loss of the metal ion, a conformational rearrangement, and dissociation of SigR by an unknown mechanism. This releases SigR to bind RNA polymerase and direct the expression of a large regulon including that of the thioredoxin pathway, thereby re-establishing redox homeostasis. No structural information is available for the SigR-RsrA complex in Streptomyces coelicolor. Moreover, little is known of the mechanism by which RsrA associates with SigR and regulates gene transcription, or the role of zinc in SigR binding. In this work, a stopped-flow fluorescence-based assay was developed for investigating the kinetics of SigR-RsrA complex formation to aid our understanding of the role of the metal ion. Ultimately, trying to understand how oxidative stress causes dissociation of the Streptomyces coelicolor complex. Through tryptophan fluorescence <b>emission</b> <b>quenching</b> <b>experiments,</b> the SigR region 2 tryptophan (W 88) and region 4 tryptophan (W 159) were found to be sensitive to RsrA binding, likely denoting the binding sites for the anti-sigma factor. Pre-steady state experiments demonstrated that the metal ion has little effect on the rate of association (K on 8. 9 and 17. 3 x 10 6 M - 1 s - 1 at 35 °C in the presence and absence of zinc, respectively) but a large effect on the dissociation rate constant (> 500 -fold faster in the absence of zinc at 35 °C). Moreover, the kinetically derived K d s (0. 27 nM and 62. 4 nM with and without zinc respectively) agreed with the equilibrium constant for the complex derived through isothermal titration calorimetry (0. 78 nM and 101. 7 nM), validating the kinetic model <b>for</b> binding <b>experiments.</b> Zinc therefore has an important role in the structure of RsrA, affecting SigR-RsrA complex affinity, the off-rate for the complex and inhibition of SigR activity.

In particular, cobalt based POMs have shown remarkable activity as WOCs under both dark and light activated cycles, although current studies focus on their possible evolution to different forms of cobalt oxides under operating conditions.

40|$|The {{fluorescence}} {{properties of}} tryptophan octyl ester (TOE), a hydrophobic model of Trp in proteins, were investigated in various mixed micelles of dodecylmaltoside (DM) and 7, 8 -dibromododecyl beta-maltoside (BrDM) or 10, 11 -dibromoundecanoyl beta-maltoside (BrUM). This study {{focuses on the}} mechanism via which these brominated detergents quench the fluorescence of TOE in a micellar system. The experiments were performed at a pH at which TOE is uncharged and almost completely bound to detergent micelles. TOE binding was monitored by its enhanced fluorescence in pure DM micelles or its quenched fluorescence in pure BrUM or BrDM micelles. In DM/BrUM and DM/BrDM mixed micelles, the fluorescence intensity of TOE decreased, as a nonlinear function of the molar fraction of brominated detergent, to almost zero in pure brominated detergent. The indole moiety of TOE is therefore highly accessible to the bromine atoms located on the detergent alkyl chain because quenching by bromines occurs by {{direct contact with the}} fluorophore. TOE is simultaneously poorly accessible to iodide (I(-)), a water-soluble collisional quencher. TOE time-resolved fluorescence intensity decay is heterogeneous in pure DM micelles, with four lifetimes (from 0. 2 to 4. 4 ns) at the maximum emission wavelength. Such heterogeneity may arise from dipolar relaxation processes in a motionally restricted medium, as suggested by the time-dependent (nanoseconds) red shift (11 nm) of the TOE emission spectrum, and from the existence of various TOE conformations. Time-resolved <b>quenching</b> <b>experiments</b> <b>for</b> TOE in mixed micelles showed that the excited-state lifetime values decreased only slightly with increases in the proportion of BrDM or BrUM. In contrast, the relative amplitude of the component with the longest lifetime decreased significantly relative to that of the short-lived species. This is consistent with a mainly static mechanism for the quenching of TOE by brominated detergents. Molecular modeling of TOE (in vacuum and in water) suggested that the indole ring was stabilized by folding back upon the octyl chain, forming a hairpin conformation. Within micelles, the presence of such folded conformations, making it possible for the entire molecule to be located in the hydrophobic part of the micelle, is consistent with the results of fluorescence <b>quenching</b> <b>experiments.</b> TOE rotational correlation time values, in the nanosecond range, were consistent with a hindered rotation of the indole moiety and a rotation of the complete TOE molecule in the pure DM or mixed detergent micelles.

40|$|The DNA-binding {{domain of}} the oncoprotein Myb {{comprises}} three imperfect repeats, R 1, R 2 and R 3. Only R 2 and R 3 are required for sequence-specific DNA-binding. Both are assumed to contain helix-turn-helix (HTH) -related motifs, but multidimensional heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy revealed a disordered structure in R 2 where the second HTH helix was predicted [Jamin et al. (1993) Eur. J. Biochem., 216, 147 - 154]. We propose that the disordered region folds into a 'recognition' helix and generates a full HTH-related motif upon binding to DNA. This would move Cys 43 into the hydrophobic core of R 2. We observed that Cys 43 was accessible to N-ethylmaleimide alkylation in the free protein, but inaccessible in the DNA complex. Mutant proteins with charged (C 43 D) or polar (C 43 S) side chains in position 43 bound DNA with reduced affinity, while hydrophobic replacements (C 43 A, C 43 V and C 43 I) gave unaltered or improved DNA-binding.

40|$|The DNA-binding {{domain of}} the oncoprotein c-Myb {{consists}} of three imperfect tryptophan-rich repeats, R 1, R 2 and R 3.

The location of the linker between two DNA-binding units suggests a function analogous to a dimerisation motif with {{a critical role in}} positioning the recognition helices of each mini-domain. Mutational analysis of the minimal DNA-binding domain of chicken c-Myb (R 2 and R 3), revealed that besides the recognition helices of each repeat, the linker connecting them was of critical importance in maintaining specific DNA-binding. A comparison of several linker sequences from different Myb proteins revealed a highly conserved motif of four amino acids {{in the first half of}} the linker: LNPE (L 138 to E 141 in chicken c-Myb R 2 R 3). Substitution of residues within this sequence led to reduced stability of protein-DNA complexes and even loss of DNA-binding.

In order {{to work with}} these emerging physical platforms, new technologies for state identification are required.

We employ our procedure to capture ultracold atomic systems using atom chips, a setup that allows for the quantum simulation of static and dynamical properties of interacting quantum fields. Our procedure is based on cMPS, the continuous analogues of matrix product states (MPS), ubiquitous in condensed-matter theory. These states naturally incorporate the locality present in realistic physical settings and are thus prime candidates for describing the physics of locally interacting quantum fields.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} use of {{surfactants}} and metal cations for the enhancement of long range fluorescent resonant energy transfer (FRET) and the antenna effect in DNA structures with multiple fluorescent dyes. Double-stranded (ds) DNA structures were formed by hybridization of 21 mer DNA oligonucleotides with different arrangements of three fluorescent TAMRA donor dyes with two different complementary 21 mer oligonucleotides with one fluorescent TexasRed acceptor dye. In such DNA structures, hydrophobic interactions between the fluorescent dyes in close proximity produces dimerization which along with other quenching mechanisms leads to significant reduction of fluorescent emission properties. Addition of the surfactants Triton X- 100, cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) along with sodium cations (Na+) and divalent magnesium cations (Mg 2 +) were tested {{for their ability to}} reduce quenching of the fluorescent dyes and improve overall fluorescent emission, the long range FRET and the antenna effect properties. When the neutral (uncharged) surfactant Triton X- 100 was added to the FRET ds-DNA hybrid structures with three TAMRA donors and one TexasRed acceptor, dye dimerization and <b>emission</b> <b>quenching</b> remained unaffected. However, for the positively charged CTAB surfactant at concentrations of 100 uM or higher, the neutralization of the negatively charged ds-DNA backbone by the cationic surfactant micelles was found to reduce TAMRA dye dimerization and <b>emission</b> <b>quenching</b> and improve TexasRed quantum yield, resulting in much higher FRET efficienies and an enhaced antenna effect. This improvement is likely due to the CTAB molecules covering or sheathing the fluorescent donor and acceptor dyes which breaks up the dimerized dye complexes and prevents further quenching from interactions with water molecules and guanine bases in the DNA structure. While the negatively charged SDS surfactant alone was not able to reduce dimerization and <b>emission</b> <b>quenching</b> due to repulsive forces between DNA and SDS micelles, the addition of cations such as sodium ions (Na+) and divalent magnesium ions (Mg 2 +) did lead to a significant reduction in the dimerization and <b>emission</b> <b>quenching</b> resulting in much higher FRET efficiency and an enhanced antenna effect.

We include excited-state hyperfine interactions, electronic spin relaxation in collisions with He and N_ 2, spontaneous <b>emission,</b> <b>quenching</b> collisions, and a simplified treatment of radiation trapping...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} between the 1 - 47 N-terminus fragment of the cholecystokinin receptor and the nonsulfated cholecystokinin octapeptide, CCK 8, is monitored by fluorescence <b>emission.</b> <b>Quenching</b> of the fluorescence intensities is observed on binding. Dissociation constants calculated by these data {{are in the same}} submicromolar range as found for the binding of linear CCK 8 analogues to B-type receptors. Although detailed structural information cannot be obtained, fluorescence emission is more sensitive than other techniques and permits fast detection of receptor-ligand interaction...|$|R
40|$|Stilbene {{triplets}} {{are further}} characterized by their interaction with quenchers. A previously proposed model for stilbene triplet decay and quenching, together with rate constants for excitation transfer from indeno[2, 1 -a]indene triplets to azulene, {{is used to}} account for the temperature dependence of the azulene effect on stilbene photoisomerization and is shown to lead to erroneous predictions concerning the lifetime and geometry of stilbene triplets. This conclusion is based on oxygen <b>quenching</b> <b>experiments</b> suggesting a twisted geometry for stilbene triplets in benzene solution with a lifetime of — 120 ns at 30 °. Azulene <b>quenching</b> <b>experiments</b> show that bromine substitution at the para position of stilbene markedly increases 'S — T intersystem crossing efficiency while substitution at the meta position does not enhance this process at 30 °. These results are consistent with the fact that in contrast to the para position, the meta position is a near node in the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals of stilbene...|$|R
40|$|Allready known {{theoretical}} {{observations about}} {{utilization of the}} <b>emission</b> <b>quenching</b> of fluorescence probes {{in the study of}} colloids were summarized by finding in the literature search and on the internet, especially the determination of the probe´s location, the aggregation numer and finally the effective viscosity. In the experimental part was studied quenching of the pyrene in the medium of the anionogenic and non-ionic surfactants. As a quenchers were used iodobenzene, tetracyanoethylene and cetylpyridiniumchloride. Selected experiments helped by finding out the aggregation number of the micelle...|$|R
