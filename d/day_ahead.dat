5|$|Following the 2008 European Grand Prix on 24 August, mid-season testing {{took place}} at Italy's Autodromo Nazionale Monza. Ferrari {{concentrated}} on their aerodynamic set-up during tests on Monza's long straights. Massa set the quickest times on the first <b>day,</b> <b>ahead</b> of McLaren driver Heikki Kovalainen. BMW Sauber's Nick Heidfeld was quickest on the second day. Massa spun off into the gravel at the Ascari chicane, bringing a brief halt to testing. Hamilton was fastest on the third day.|$|E
5|$|Despite the misgivings of the expedition's commanders, {{the fleet}} left Brest as {{scheduled}} on 15 December 1796, one <b>day</b> <b>ahead</b> {{of a message}} from the Directory calling off the entire operation. De Galles knew that the British would be watching Brest harbour: their frigates were a constant presence as part of the Inshore Squadron of the blockade. In an effort to disguise his force's intentions, he first anchored in Camaret Bay and issued orders for his ships to pass through the Raz de Sein. The Raz was a dangerous narrow channel littered with rocks and sandbanks and subject to heavy surf during bad weather, but would also obscure the size, strength and direction of the French fleet from the British squadron offshore, which French scouts claimed consisted of 30 ships.|$|E
5|$|That evening, the {{witnesses}} gathered {{to discuss what}} was to be done. United States laws were not applicable west of the Continental Divide (in what was then Mexican territory) and wagon trains often dispensed their own justice. But George Donner, the party's leader, was a full <b>day</b> <b>ahead</b> of the main wagon train with his family. Snyder had been seen to hit James Reed, and some claimed that he had also hit Margret Reed, but Snyder had been popular and Reed was not. Keseberg suggested that Reed should be hanged, but an eventual compromise allowed Reed to leave the camp without his family, who were {{to be taken care of}} by the others. Reed departed alone the next morning, unarmed, but his daughter Virginia rode ahead and secretly provided him with a rifle and food.|$|E

5|$|After the British Grand Prix on 15 July, eight teams {{conducted}} mid-season {{testing at}} the Autodromo Nazionale Monza between 17–20 July {{to prepare for}} the upcoming German Grand Prix at the Hockenheimring. Ricardo Zonta set the fastest times on the first <b>day,</b> <b>ahead</b> of McLaren test driver Alexander Wurz. Michael Schumacher lost control of the rear-end of his car at the Seconda Variante chicane, causing him to slide along the barriers and his car rested in the tyre barriers. Testing was suspended for one hour for the barriers to be repaired. Ferrari later found the crash occurred by a broken diffuser from riding on the kerbs which created a loss of downforce under braking. Michael Schumacher took a medical check and was declared fit to race. Ralf Schumacher was fastest on the second day where it was held in wet weather conditions during the afternoon. Sauber and BAR went to Circuit Ricardo Tormo for three days where aerodyamic and set-up testing was undertaken. Coulthard was scheduled to join Wurz during the session but withdrew because of food poisoning. Irvine was quickest on the third and final days of testing. Arrows elected not to perform any testing and concentrated on work on aerodynamics at their headquarters at Leafield.|$|E
5|$|After the Hungarian Grand Prix on 13 August, {{five teams}} {{conducted}} mid-season testing at the Silverstone Circuit on 15–17 August. McLaren test driver Olivier Panis was fastest {{on the first}} <b>day,</b> <b>ahead</b> of Frentzen. Williams test driver Bruno Junqueira's car had a water leak, resulting in repairs which limited his team's testing time. Panis remained the fastest on the second day. Jos Verstappen's Arrows car had a sensor failure, limiting his team's testing time; the car's floor {{had to be removed}} to install a new sensor. Panis was again fastest {{on the final day of}} testing. Ferrari opted to test the suspension and tyres of Michael Schumacher's car at the Fiorano Circuit. Schumacher later moved to the Mugello Circuit, with Barrichello conducting engine and setup tests, and Ferrari test driver Luca Badoer remained at Fiorano for development work on new car components. Prost opted to test at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza on 17–18 August with driver Jean Alesi. Benetton conducted a five-day, one-car test at the Danielson Circuit, with test driver Mark Webber on aerodynamic development for the first four days and Alexander Wurz concentrating on practice starts the last day.|$|E
5|$|Following the Belgian Grand Prix on 27 August, {{the teams}} {{conducted}} a four-day testing {{session at the}} Monza circuit and concentrated on optimising their car set-ups for low downforce. Jos Verstappen set the quickest times on the first <b>day,</b> <b>ahead</b> of Pedro Diniz. Coulthard was quickest on the second day. Fisichella suffered a high speed crash going into the Ascari chicane, bringing a brief halt to testing. He visited Rome to undergo a medical examination and was diagnosed with an inflamed tendon in his right ankle, but was cleared to race having been advised to take five days of rest. Jacques Villeneuve set the quickest times {{on the third day}} as rain shortened the team's running. Minardi's Gastón Mazzacane suffered a high speed accident at the Ascari chicane, forcing testing to be stopped. Ralf Schumacher was fastest on the fourth and final day of testing. Michael Schumacher's car developed a malfunction and pulled off the race track, limiting Ferrari's testing time as the car's power unit was changed.|$|E

5|$|Following the Canadian Grand Prix on 18 June, {{the teams}} {{conducted}} testing sessions at the Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours between 21–23 June {{to prepare for}} the upcoming French Grand Prix. Coulthard set the fastest times on the first <b>day,</b> <b>ahead</b> of McLaren test driver Olivier Panis. Arrows driver Jos Verstappen lost control of his car after suffering a mechanical problem and crashed into the barriers at turn two. Verstappen sustained neck strain and withdrew from testing. He was later passed fit to compete in the Grand Prix. Coulthard remained fastest on the second day. Fisichella damaged the underside of his car's chassis, limiting his testing time as Benetton made repairs to his car. Häkkinen was quickest {{on the final day of}} testing. Michael Schumacher stopped on circuit as his Ferrari engine failed, causing his team to fit a new engine into the chassis. Ferrari went to their private testing facility, the Fiorano Circuit, on 27 June where test driver Luca Badoer shook down three Ferrari F1-2000 cars and also took part in pit stop practices.|$|E
5|$|Following the German Grand Prix on 30 July, six teams {{conducted}} mid-season {{testing at}} the Circuit Ricardo Tormo from 3–5 August. McLaren test driver Olivier Panis was fastest {{on the first}} <b>day,</b> <b>ahead</b> of Häkkinen. Pedro Diniz's Sauber car was afflicted with an oil leak, limiting his team's testing time as the leak was repaired. Coulthard was fastest on the second day. Fisichella set the fastest times {{on the final day}} of testing. His teammate Alexander Wurz spun off and collided with the tyre barrier. His car's wishbone struck his right leg and was taken to the circuit's medical center before a transfer to a local hospital. Wurz was passed fit to compete in the race the day after his accident. Ferrari opted to spend five days testing at the Fiorano Circuit and concentrated on car development, practice starts, aerodynamic testing and race distance simulations with their test driver Luca Badoer. He was joined by Barrichello on the second day and Michael Schumacher from the fourth day onwards. Badoer and Michael Schumacher spent two further days at the circuit performing shakedowns of the Ferrari F1-2000 car.|$|E
5|$|The tower has {{a three-story}} {{observation}} deck, located on floors 100–102, {{in addition to}} existing broadcast and antenna facilities. Similar to the Empire State Building, visitors are separated from the tenants, having their own separate entrance next to the museum, descending down to a below-ground security screening area. On the observation deck, the actual viewing space is on the 100th floor, {{but there is a}} food court on the 101st floor and a space for events for the 102nd floor. To show visitors the city, and give them information and stories about New York, an interactive tool called City Pulse is used by Tour Ambassadors. The admission fee is $32 per person, but admission discounts are available for children and seniors, and the deck is free for 9/11 responders and families of 9/11 victims. When it opens, the deck is expected to have about 3.5 million visitors per year. Tickets went on sale starting on April 8. However, the Manhattan District Attorney probed the Port Authority about the firm to which it awarded a contract to operate the deck. It officially opened on May 28, 2015, one <b>day</b> <b>ahead</b> of schedule.|$|E

5|$|Still 200 {{miles from}} the Afghan border, the {{expedition}} now had to race against time. Ahead were British patrols of the East Persia Cordon (later known as the Seistan Force) and Russian patrols. By September, the German codebook lost by Wassmuss had been deciphered, which further compromised the situation. Niedermayer, now in charge, {{proved to be a}} brilliant tactician. He sent three feint patrols, one to north-east to draw away the Russian troops and one to the south-east to draw away the British, while a third patrol of thirty armed Persians, led by a German officer—Lieutenant Wagner—was sent ahead to scout the route. After leading the Russians astray, the first group was to remain in Persia to establish a secret desert base as a refuge for the main party. After luring away the British, the second group was to fall back to Kermanshah and link with a separate German force under Lieutenants Zugmayer and Griesinger. All three parties were ordered to spread misleading information about their movements to any nomads or villagers they met. Meanwhile, the main body headed through Chehar Deh for the region of Birjand, close to the Afghan frontier. The party covered forty miles before it reached the next village, where Niedermayer halted to await word from Wagner's patrol. The villagers were meanwhile barred from leaving. The report from Wagner was bad: His patrol had run into a Russian ambush and the desert refuge had been eliminated. The expedition proceeded towards Birjand using forced marches to keep a <b>day</b> <b>ahead</b> of the British and Russian patrols. Other problems still confronted Niedermayer, among them the opium addiction of his Persian camel drivers. Fearful of being spotted, he had to stop the Persians a number of times from lighting up their pipes. Men who fell behind were abandoned. Some of the Persian drivers attempted to defect. On one occasion, a driver was shot while he attempted to flee and betray the group.|$|E
