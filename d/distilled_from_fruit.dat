50|$|In English-speaking countries, eau de vie {{refers to}} a <b>distilled</b> {{beverage}} made <b>from</b> <b>fruit</b> other than grapes. Similar terms may be local translations or may specify the fruit used to produce it. Although eau de vie is a French term, similar beverages are produced in other countries (e.g., German Schnaps, Balkan rakia, Turkish rakı, Romanian țuică, Czech and Slovak pálenka, Hungarian pálinka, and Sri Lankan coconut arrack). In French, however, eau de vie is a generic term for distilled spirits. The proper French term for fruit brandy is eau-de-vie de fruit, while eau-de-vie de vin means wine spirit (brandy), and several further categories of spirits (<b>distilled</b> <b>from</b> grape pomace, lees of wine, beer, cereals, etc.) are also legally defined as eau-de-vie in a similar fashion.

40|$|Indigenous trees fulfil many {{subsistence}} {{and economic}} needs in north-central Namibia. Hyphaene petersiana provides {{a range of}} products which contribute to most aspects of people’s livelihoods. Of particular importance is its income-generating capacity {{through the use of}} palm leaves for basket production and the sale of liquor <b>distilled</b> <b>from</b> the <b>fruits.</b> This study investigates the population structure of Hyphaene petersiana in two areas of different human and livestock densities. Data were recorded for height class distribution, basal diameter of mature, stemmed individuals and sex ratios. These parameters of population structure indicate a reduction in the recruitment of mature palms and an increase in single-stemmed, vegetatively reproduced palm suckers of the smallest size class (0. 5 m). This trend is more pronounced in the site with greater human and livestock population densities. It appears to be related to high recorded levels of browsing by livestock of juvenile, unstemmed palms, despite the unpalatability of palm leaves. This acts to prevent recruitment into larger size classes and increase the compensatory growth of palm suckers, the latter being enhanced due to reduced competition through the prior removal by grazing animals of grasses and other herbaceous species. Accompanying this heavy pressure on juvenile palms are destructive uses of mature, stemmed palms, including their felling for construction purposes and tapping for palm wine. With regional human population increase, exacerbated by a recent trend to privatise land and raise pressure on remaining communal resources, it is possible that these destructive uses of mature palms will increase to unsustainable levels. Concern is thus expressed in this study regarding the long-term viability of Hyphaene petersiana populations in this area...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the current work was to assess various novel and underutilized feeds and thus increase the awareness of various novel feeding solutions to support organic and low-input dairy production. A set of various feeds representing high protein feeds, by-products <b>from</b> <b>distilling,</b> wineries, <b>fruit</b> and vegetable production, whole crop cereals, agroforestry and wood derived materials were collected from Spain, Romania, UK and Finland and analysed for chemical composition and digestibility. The results {{can be used to}} aid in exploiting the potential of different feed resources and in ration formulation, and to demonstrate potential to widen the basis of feed supply on organic and low-input dairy farms. The use of various by-products as animal feeds allows in many cases to add the economic value of them, and may provide an environmentally sound method for disposal of the by-product materials. As organic food and beverage manufacturing increases in volumes, it creates opportunities for organically labelled by-products. This would result in higher value for the manufacturer and provide useful additional feedstuffs to be used in organic animal production...|$|R
