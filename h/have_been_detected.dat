5|$|A recent (2005) {{hypothesis}} is that the star of Bethlehem was a supernova or hypernova occurring in the nearby Andromeda Galaxy.

5|$|Although the {{physical}} and chemical properties of cobalt and nickel are rather similar, the concentrations of isolated cobalt in diamond are much smaller than those of nickel (parts per billion range).

5|$|Boron-doped {{diamonds}} transmit light down to ~250nm {{and absorb}} some red and infrared light (hence the blue color); they may phosphoresce blue after exposure to shortwave ultraviolet light.

5|$|Clay-like {{minerals}} (specifically, phyllosilicates), {{often associated}} with organic matter on Earth, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>detected</b> on the icy crust of Europa. The presence of the minerals {{may have been the}} result of a collision with an asteroid or comet.|$|E
5|$|Magnetic fields <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>detected</b> in {{the space}} around just about every class of {{celestial}} object. Star formation in spiral galaxies can generate small-scale dynamos, generating turbulent magnetic field strengths of around 5–10μG. The Davis–Greenstein effect causes elongated dust grains to align themselves with a galaxy's magnetic field, resulting in weak optical polarization. This {{has been used to}} show ordered magnetic fields exist in several nearby galaxies. Magneto-hydrodynamic processes in active elliptical galaxies produce their characteristic jets and radio lobes. Non-thermal radio sources <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>detected</b> even among the most distant, high-z sources, indicating the presence of magnetic fields.|$|E

5|$|A model {{suggests}} that Enceladus's salty ocean (-Na, -Cl, -CO3) has an alkaline pH of 11 to 12. The high pH is interpreted to be {{a consequence of}} serpentinization of chondritic rock {{that leads to the}} generation of H2, a geochemical source of energy that can support both abiotic and biological synthesis of organic molecules such as those that <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>detected</b> in Enceladus's plumes.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{spectral}} evidence, Hygiea's {{surface is}} thought to consist of primitive carbonaceous materials {{similar to those found}} in carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. Aqueous alteration products <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>detected</b> on its surface, which could indicate the presence of water ice in the past which was heated sufficiently to melt. The primitive present surface composition would indicate that Hygiea had not been melted during the early period of Solar System formation, in contrast to other large planetesimals like 4 Vesta.|$|E

Melanins, carotenoids and pterins, very common in other animals, are apparently absent. In some species, the exocuticle of the legs and prosoma is modified by a tanning process, resulting in brown coloration.|$|E

The presence of the dye indicated that the crack was present and should <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>detected</b> at a prior inspection. The detection failure arose from poor attention to human factors in United Airlines' specification of maintenance processes.|$|E

They {{exist in}} extremely dense populations and are all associated with areas of high human activity.

In mouse, the two alternative first exons are MKYK and MWAR. Their function is not known. NM_001142393 initiates translation at an upstream location compared to NM_006403.3, but both transcripts have 7 exons.

5|$|Trace {{amounts of}} ammonia, acetylene, ethane, propane, {{phosphine}} and methane <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>detected</b> in Saturn's atmosphere. The upper clouds {{are composed of}} ammonia crystals, while the lower level clouds appear to consist of either ammonium hydrosulfide (NH4SH) or water. Ultraviolet radiation from the Sun causes methane photolysis in the upper atmosphere, leading {{to a series of}} hydrocarbon chemical reactions with the resulting products being carried downward by eddies and diffusion. This photochemical cycle is modulated by Saturn's annual seasonal cycle.|$|E

5|$|Because {{high levels}} of jitter <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>detected</b> in the {{spectrum}} of HAT-P-33, the ability to collect the most sensitive radial velocity measurements possible has been dulled. The loss of accuracy has prevented astronomers from disregarding the possibility that HAT-P-33 is actually a binary star, where the secondary, dimmer companion is visually indistinguishable from the brighter primary companion. If this is the case, then the dimmer star in the HAT-P-33 system {{would have to have}} a mass that is less than 0.55 times that of the Sun. A search for a binary companion star using adaptive optics at the MMT Observatory was negative.|$|E
5|$|Biologically active {{mushroom}} polysaccharides {{have been}} a frequent research topic in recent decades due to their possible stimulatory effect on innate and cell-mediated immune responses, antitumor activities, and other activities.

A water-insoluble beta-glucan, RVS3-II, has been isolated from the fruit bodies. Sulfated derivatives of this compound have antitumor activities against sarcoma tumor cell lines. RVP, a water-soluble polysaccharide present in the mushroom, is made largely of galactomannan subunits and has antioxidant activity.|$|E
