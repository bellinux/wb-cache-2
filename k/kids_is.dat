25|$|In October 2010, The Forward {{reported}} on {{the current state of}} Jews and the level of antisemitism in Sweden. Henrik Bachner, a writer and {{professor of history at the}} University of Lund, stated that members of the Swedish Riksdag have attended anti-Israel rallies where the Israeli flag was burned while the flags of Hamas and Hezbollah were waved, and the rhetoric was often antisemitic—not just anti-Israel. Charles Small, former director of the Yale University Initiative for the Study of Anti-Semitism, stated that “Sweden is a microcosm of contemporary anti-Semitism. It’s a form of acquiescence to radical Islam, which is diametrically opposed to everything Sweden stands for.” Per Gudmundson, chief editorial writer for Svenska Dagbladet and well known for his pro-Israeli stance for decades, has sharply criticised politicians who he says offer “weak excuses” for Muslims accused of antisemitic crimes. “Politicians say these kids are poor and oppressed, and we have made them hate. They are, in effect, saying that the behaviour of these <b>kids</b> <b>is</b> in some way our fault.” Much of the anti-semitism in the country has been attributed to the growing Muslim immigrant population.|$|E

40|$|Aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} comparatively the slaughter and carcass characteristics of Gokceada, Maltese and Turkish Saanen suckling kids. Eight suckling male kids at 80 – 90 days of age from each genotype were used in the study. The <b>kids</b> <b>were</b> collected from dairy goat farms and slaughtered after lairage of an overnight period. Although the <b>kids</b> <b>were</b> at similar age and sex, the slaughter weight and chilled carcass weight of indigenous Gokceada <b>kids</b> <b>were</b> lower than those of Maltese and Turkish Saanen kids (P 0. 05). While there were significant differences between breeds in terms of muscle, bone and fat weights in half carcass on the side of Turkish Saanen and Maltese kids, the differences between the genotypes were not significant for percentages of muscle, bone and fat. The carcass structure of suckling <b>kids</b> <b>was</b> small and meat production was low, however, they had very little fat in the carcass. It was concluded that Maltese and Turkish Saanen <b>kids</b> <b>were</b> favourable than Gokceada kids in terms of suckling kid meat production...|$|R

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mixed reviews from television critics. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson called the episode a [...] "generally good program, though {{not one of}} the year’s best". Jacobson said he dislikes Marge's mother; [...] "she’s one of the series’ less interesting characters, which is probably why she appears so rarely." [...] However, he thinks Grampa is [...] "always fun", and [...] "it’s nice to see him in an ebullient mood, at least for a while." [...] Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict gave the episode a B grade and said he is [...] "never terribly interested in episodes that revolve around [...] Simpson". He believes Grampa is [...] "great as a background character, but less so when he takes center stage". He added: [...] "I'm also especially uninterested in episodes revolving around Marge's mother. Having said that, this episode does have a number of inspired moments—notably the subplot involving Bart's pursuit of an Itchy & Scratchy cel, as well as one of the series' many homages to The Graduate." [...] Bill Gibron of DVD Talk gave the episode a score of 4 out of 5. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: [...] "Homer's nightmare vision of Bart, Lisa and Maggie as ordinary <b>kids</b> <b>is</b> a highlight of this especially crazy—surreal jokes, flashbacks and dream sequences whizz by at an alarming rate—installment." ...|$|E
500|$|Mays has deemed Emma an [...] "amazing" [...] {{character}} to play, and has explained: [...] "I don't find that female characters are always written {{with a lot}} of depth, but she's so well defined on the page. Sure, she's terrified of germs and in love with a married man, so seeing her as the voice of reason for the <b>kids</b> <b>is</b> amazing." [...] Emma's relationship with Will will continue to grow, as [...] "she has these moments of clarity when she's talking to Will because he calms her." [...] Mays described her in an interview with TheTVChick: [...] "She is a romantic at heart. But she’s practical. She’s very interesting, because she does have those dreams and hopes of finding the right man. And in her mind, even though Will Schuester’s married, that sort of guy is like the perfect guy for her. She’s very practical in the fact that she doesn’t want to be alone and she knows that she’s somewhat limited in a small town to men. And Ken Tanaka is a very nice man, he’s not exactly like Will, but he’s good to her and he’s solid. He’s got a job, and he understands her and he understands all her quirks and stuff. So she’s practical, she knows that just might be her lot in life. So it’s weird. She’s got this very dreamy side about her and who she wants to be and what she wants her life to be like. But she’s also got this very practical, down-to-earth, well this is kind of the best I can do thing. It’s funny {{a lot of people have}} thought that part about her is weak. Like a weak character flaw, but I actually don’t think that’s true. I really just think that’s the practical side of her. I think that’s her being practical. And I think a lot of people are like that sometimes." ...|$|E
