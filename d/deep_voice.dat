5|$|After briefly reading {{law with}} former New Hampshire Governor Levi Woodbury, a family friend, in Portsmouth, {{he spent a}} {{semester}} at Northampton Law School in Northampton, Massachusetts, followed by a period of study in 1826 and 1827 under Judge Edmund Parker in Amherst, New Hampshire. He {{was admitted to the}} New Hampshire bar in late 1827 and began to practice in Hillsborough. Pierce lost his first case, but soon proved capable as a lawyer. Despite never being a legal scholar, his memory for names and faces served him well, as did his personal charm and <b>deep</b> <b>voice.</b> In Hillsborough, his law partner was Albert Baker, who had studied law under Pierce and was the brother of Mary Baker Eddy.|$|E
5|$|When Brian advises Stewie to “wait and see” {{whether or}} not he has cancer, Stewie says “Jim Henson had a wait and see attitude, and look what {{happened}} to him. Now we’ve got wrong-sounding Muppets,” a reference to Henson’s deadly Streptococcus pneumoniae infection that was discovered too late which led to his death in 1990. The scene then cuts to Kermit the Frog and the Swedish Chef in a dialogue sequence, with much different voice tones. The two would later appear {{at the end of the}} show, discussing the preceding events, when Fozzie Bear walks in, and says in a <b>deep</b> <b>voice</b> (supplied by actor Michael Clarke Duncan): “Wocka wocka. Who wants to hear a funny-ass joke?”.|$|E

5|$|The basslines in {{his songs}} {{tend to be}} melodically dynamic, rising and falling in a {{dramatic}} fashion. Polyrhythms are also apparent, particularly in songs with Indian folk or Carnatic influences. The melodic structure of his songs demand considerable vocal virtuosity, and have found expressive platform amongst some of India's respected vocalists and playback singers, such as Rajkumar, T. M. Soundararajan, K. J. Yesudas, S. P. Balasubrahmanyam, S. Janaki, P. Susheela, Asha Bhosle, Lata Mangeshkar, Jayachandran, S. P. Sailaja, Jency, Swarnalatha, K. S. Chithra, Minmini, Sujatha, Malaysia Vasudevan, Kavita Krishnamurthy, Hariharan, Udit Narayan, Sadhana Sargam and Shreya Ghoshal. Ilaiyaraaja has sung over 400 of his own compositions for films, and is recognisable by his stark, <b>deep</b> <b>voice.</b> He has penned the lyrics for some of his songs in Tamil.|$|E
25|$|MGM signed Boyer to a contract, and {{he loved}} life in the United States, but nothing much came of his first American stay from 1929 to 1931.

However, {{with the coming of}} sound, his <b>deep</b> <b>voice</b> made him a romantic star.|$|E
25|$|In looks he {{was easily}} {{distinguishable}} from the crowd, his black crinkling hair neatly cut, telling of his services background; his hawk's eyes, his shrewdness, his Roman nose, and jutting jaw, his fierce competitiveness; his hairy forearms, expansive shoulders and <b>deep</b> <b>voice,</b> his physical strength; his infectious laugh, {{his sense of}} humour, and his craggy smiling face revealing a kindness and sensitivity that accompanied his more resolute qualities.|$|E

You just can't hear them." ...|$|R

25|$|In 1936 Ladd {{played an}} {{unbilled}} role in Pigskin Parade. He had short term stints at MGM and RKO, but only got regular professional acting work {{when he turned}} to radio. Ladd's rich, <b>deep</b> <b>voice</b> was ideal for that medium and in 1936 he ended up being signed by station KFWB as their sole radio actor. He stayed for three years at KFWB doing up to 20 shows a week.|$|E
25|$|In February 1972, Cunningham married Beatrice Nannery, {{who worked}} for him {{managing}} a supermarket which he owned. They had four children and two grandchildren. He died on 28 September 2012, following {{a long period of}} illness. Among those to pay tribute were U.S. country singer Robert Mizzell who said: “I am so saddened to hear of the passing of country legend Larry. I admired his talent and quick humour. My thoughts are with his family, friends, and the fans who loved the big <b>deep</b> <b>voice</b> that rattled the radio waves”.|$|E

Holly {{was known for his}} solo ballads with his {{trademark}} booming <b>deep</b> <b>voice</b> on Buck Owens and the Buckaroos albums. His departure was a setback to the band, as Doyle had received the Bass Player of the Year award from the Academy of Country Music the year before in 1970 and served as co-lead vocalist (along with Don Rich) of the Buckaroos. Holly went on to record two solo records in the early 1970s, both were top 20 hits.|$|E

25|$|The Brontë {{sisters were}} highly {{amused by the}} {{behaviour}} of the curates they met. Arthur Bell Nicholls (1818–1906) had been curate of Haworth for {{seven and a half}} years, when contrary to all expectations, and to the fury of Patrick Brontë (their father), he proposed to Charlotte. Although impressed by his dignity and <b>deep</b> <b>voice,</b> as well as by his near complete emotional collapse when she rejected him, she found him rigid, conventional, and rather narrow-minded 'like all the curates' – as she wrote to Ellen Nussey. After she declined his proposal Nicholls, pursued by the anger of Patrick Brontë, left his functions for several months. However, little by little her feelings evolved and after slowly convincing her father, she finally married Nicholls on 29 June 1854.|$|E
25|$|Androgens, such as {{testosterone}} and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), are {{the major}} sex hormones in XY chromosomed individuals, and {{are responsible for the}} development and maintenance of masculine secondary sexual characteristics, such as a <b>deep</b> <b>voice,</b> broad shoulders, and a masculine pattern of hair, muscle, and fat distribution. In addition, they stimulate sex drive and the frequency of spontaneous erections and are responsible for acne, body odor, and masculine-pattern scalp hair loss. Androgens act by binding to and activating the androgen receptor (AR), their biological target in the body. In contrast to androgens, antiandrogens are drugs that prevent the effects of androgens in the body. They do this by preventing androgens from binding to the AR or by preventing the production of androgens. The most commonly used antiandrogens in transgender women are cyproterone acetate, spironolactone, and GnRH analogues.|$|E
500|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} in 1957, which included eight full-page photographs, Wright described his thoughts about how high mountain beauty resembles great music: [...] "Beauty haunts the high country like a majestic hymn, sings in cold sunny air, the brilliant mountain air—makes of sunlight a living thing—floats in cloud forms—filters changing floods of light ever clothing the mountains anew. Beauty arrives in <b>deep</b> <b>voice</b> of river and wind through forest, swelling the chorus, giving sonority universal proportions." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Jean-Claude Déquéant, Farmer showed limited enthusiasm {{during the}} demo {{recordings}} and declared: [...] "The voice was surprisingly present {{and she laughed}} after each take when listening". Dahan was satisfied, because Farmer had a clear and <b>deep</b> <b>voice</b> and could easily reach high notes. Initial rehearsals were held at Dahan's home. Dahan has said of these rehearsals: [...] "There was a large room with a piano and there we repeated the staging of the song. Mylène {{had a hard time}} understanding all this, we had to teach her everything, starting with the choreography [...] This probably did not look very professional." ...|$|E
500|$|The name Hives, used by Shearsmith's character, {{was taken}} from a Laurel and Hardy butler of the same name. Meanwhile, Hives's costume and mannerisms were {{inspired}} by those worn and adopted by Noel Edmonds in undercover practical jokes. A related influence for the episode was a prank-gone-wrong seen on YouTube, in which a joke's target punches a costumed person when the latter surprises the former. Pemberton's character spoke with a cockney accent, something unusual for Pemberton, who normally does not affect accents when acting. In addition to playing Pete, Pemberton provided the <b>deep</b> <b>voice</b> spoken by [...] "Madam Talbot" [...] during the séance.|$|E

[...] Jack explains his plans to her on how he will get Tracy to return, with Liz once again mocking Jack, this time in a deep raspy voice, [...] "Just get it done. Nope. I lost it.

[...] "Foggy Mountain Breakdown" [...] is played during a chase scene, reminiscent of a recurring theme of the 1967 film Bonnie and Clyde. When Professor Frink takes the tonic, he transforms into a suave man with a <b>deep</b> <b>voice,</b> which is a reference to Jerry Lewis transforming into Buddy Love in The Nutty Professor.
