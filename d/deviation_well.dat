40|$|In a supersymmetric {{extension}} of the standard model where baryon and lepton numbers are local gauge symmetries(BLMSSM) and the Yukawa couplings between Higgs doublets and exotic quarks are considered, we study the one loop diagrams and the two-loop Barr-Zee type diagrams with a closed Fermi(scalar) loop between the vector Boson and Higgs. Using the effective Lagrangian method, we deduce the Wilson coefficients of dimension 6 operators contributing to the anomalous magnetic moment of muon, which satisfies the electromagnetic gauge invariance. In the numerical analysis, we consider the experiment constraints from Higgs and neutrino data. In some parameter space, the new physics contribution is large and even reaches 24 × 10 − 10, which can remedy the <b>deviation</b> <b>well...</b>|$|E

The model starts from stochastic binding and dissociation of Ca 2 + to binding sites {{on a single}} subunit of the IP 3 -receptor channel but is capable of simulating large numbers of clusters for many oscillation periods too. I find oscillations with variable periods ranging from 17 s to 120 s and a standard <b>deviation</b> <b>well</b> in the experimentally observed range. Long period oscillations can be perceived as nucleation phenomenon and can be observed for a large variety of single channel dynamics. Their period depends on the geometric characteristics of the cluster array. Short periods {{are in the range}} of the time scale of channel dynamics. Both long and short period oscillations occur for parameters with a nonoscillatory deterministic regime...|$|E

40|$|Reference {{evapotranspiration}} (ETo) {{is one of}} {{the driving}} forces in crop simulation models and is very important to be estimated accurately. Moreover, weather generator (WG) models are widely used in combination with these crop models. As the quality of model output is related to the quality of weather data used as input, the evaluation of the sensitivity of model outputs to the quality of generated weather data is essential. In this study, eight different weather generator models were assessed and their outputs were used to estimate daily reference evapotranspiration and irrigation requirement. Two daily weather generator algorithms were combined with a monthly weather generator and/or an adjustment algorithm for low-frequency variances. Precipitation occurrence series was generated by an independent semi-empirical distribution. The daily weather generators outperformed the monthly models in reproducing daily statistics, while the monthly models performed better in simulating the monthly and yearly variations. After analyzing the model performances in simulating climatic variables, more assessments were carried out on ETo and irrigation requirement. The results depicted the strength of all the models in simulating daily ETo and irrigation requirement. Although all the studied models have comparable performances in simulating these two daily variables on daily and monthly scales, the monthly WGs outperform the daily models on yearly time scales and have better performances in simulating standard deviation values of yearly mean ETo and irrigation requirement. It can be concluded that WG models are robust tools for estimating these two daily variables if they can at least reproduce daily statistics (i. e. mean and standard <b>deviation)</b> <b>well.</b> But it must be taken in considerations that each WG model (including the one studied here) has different weaknesses and strengths and the best choice must be done according to the requirements...|$|E
40|$|Additional thesis - To improve weather monitoring, local near-real time weather {{forecasts}} {{and climate}} monitoring, a dense network of sensors {{should be set}} up. As shown already in the 1990 s, GPS is a promising measurement device to form a dense network for meteorology observation. Because of economic reasons, a network of dual frequency GPS receivers is densified using low-cost single frequency GPS receivers. In this thesis and the complementary thesis written by E. M. J. Stierman (2016), respectively, {{the quality of the}} Tropospheric Zenith delay and the Precipiatble Water Vapour recordings that are estimated using the single frequency receivers in the network are investigated. To do this, two networks of small (< 10 km) spacing and large (30 - 90 km) spacing have been set-up. After this, a L 2 - and C 2 -measurement is generated for the single frequency receivers, using epoch-differenced ionospheric delay for L 2 and regular ionospheric delay for the C 2 measurement together with the L 1 and C 1 observations of the single frequencyreceiver. This is done {{to be able to use}} web-based PPP processing software of NRCan, that estimates the ZTD for dual frequency data. The single frequency GPS show a ZTD that is much more variable in time than the ZTD found by dual frequency measurements. Secondly, the standard deviation to which the single frequency measurements converge is about 5 cm. It takes about half a day to obtain this precision. For comparison; the dual frequency receivers obtain a standard <b>deviation</b> <b>well</b> below 1 cm in less than 2. 5 hours. The results show this processing method for single frequency receivers is not good enough to obtain an accurate and precise measurement of the ZTD. Further research could be done on taking the correlation between the made observation and generated observations into account, using other processing methods, for instance double differences, or improving this processing method.

40|$|Graphene is the {{archetype}} 2 D material, and {{its unique}} properties widely appeal to applications, from electronics, to energy storage, photonics, composite materials and sensor technology. Graphene oxide (GO) {{can be easily}} dispersed in solvents and deposited with controlled thickness onto different substrates. Because {{of the variety of}} its oxygen-functional groups, GO can interact with wide range of organic and inorganic materials. Since it is tunable from insulator to semi-metal, it is promising for applications such as plastic electronics, solar cells and biosensors. As is in general for 2 D materials, the physical properties of graphene and GO crucially depend on the number of stacked atomic layers composing the film. It is therefore of the utmost importance to quantify the number of layers and the overall thickness of the films obtained from different growth processes. Nanoscale thickness metrology techniques are possible, like atomic force microscopy (AFM), optical microscopy, contrast spectroscopy, confocal Rayleigh scattering microscopy and micro-Raman (μ-Raman) spectroscopy. Among these, AFM and μ -Raman spectroscopy directly identify the number of layers. However, depending on the substrates, Raman technique may not be applicable and AFM is mainly limited by the small field of view and the need for a step-shaped sample to refer to substrate for levelling. Recently, Scanning Auger Microspectroscopy (SAM) has been demonstrated to be sensitive for thickness measurements of graphene layers on silica substrates. We extend SAM characterization to generic substrates and to GO, by evaluating reference layer number by AFM and μ-Raman, where applicable, and by overcoming the limitations of AFM and μ-Raman themselves. Firstly, updated values for the electron effective attenuation lengths in graphene and GO were experimentally determined with unprecedented accuracy, for each film/substrate combination. Then, the absolute thickness of graphene and GO flakes, up to 4 monolayers thick, was evaluated by SAM; results are consistent with AFM and Raman measurements, with a standard <b>deviation</b> <b>well</b> below a single monolayer. SAM, associated with SEM imaging, represents a method for quantitative thickness mapping of large area graphene and GO films and related devices with sub-monolayer resolution. This method is capable of detecting chemical impurities, on a very wide variety of substrates, from conductors to insulators and from heavy to light atomic weight compounds...|$|E
