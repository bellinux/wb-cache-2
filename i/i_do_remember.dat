25|$|I {{actually}} {{never met}} the Three Kings—it didn't matter how hard my little brother and I tried to keep awake at night {{to catch a glimpse}} of the Three Royal Visitors, we would always fall asleep just before they arrived. But <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>remember</b> hearing them. I remember the weird cadence of their song in the dark distance; I remember the brittle sound of the camel's hooves crushing the frozen snow; and I remember the mysterious tinkling of their silver bridles.|$|E
500|$|This {{episode is}} one of Yeardley Smith's {{favorite}} episodes. She says, [...] "I don't actually remember {{a lot of the}} episodes because they all blend in together for me, and I don't have a really good memory anyway, but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>remember</b> this one and thinking that it was terrific." ...|$|E
500|$|Robert Christgau, who {{had been}} so {{critical}} of Pleasures of the Harbor and Ochs's guitar skills eight years earlier, wrote warmly of Ochs in his obituary in The Village Voice. [...] "I came around to liking Phil Ochs' music, guitar included," [...] Christgau wrote. [...] "My affection [...] no doubt prejudiced me, so it is worth [...] that many observers who care more for folk music than <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>remember</b> both his compositions and his vibrato tenor {{as close to the}} peak of the genre." ...|$|E

500|$|As I was {{reporting}} to the Triton, I remember saying, [...] "This ship is an unusual one. We've {{got to do something}} special with it. What could it be?" [...] We talked about it a little bit, and nobody had any ideas. Finally, I got an idea. We'll do a stunt. We'll go around the world from North Pole to South Pole. That was my brainstorm. If {{you take a look at}} a map of the world, you'll see that's not a very easy way to go. [...] So we didn't do that. But <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>remember</b> thinking of it. And I made a speech to the crew, advising them of my thinking—that we were going to put this ship on the map. Well, that died out. Suddenly ... a phone call came, asking me if I could be in Washington tomorrow.|$|E
500|$|Al Jean, showrunner since season thirteen, {{has also}} {{been the subject of}} criticism, with some arguing that the show has {{continued}} to decline in quality under his tenure. Former writers have complained that under Jean, the show is [...] "on auto-pilot", [...] "too sentimental", and the episodes are [...] "just being cranked out." [...] Some critics believe that the show has [...] "entered a steady decline under Jean and is no longer really funny." [...] John Ortved, author of , characterized the Jean era as [...] "toothless", and criticized what he perceived as the show's increase in social and political commentary. Jean responded: [...] "Well, it's possible that we've declined. But honestly, I've been here the whole time and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>remember</b> in season two people saying, 'It's gone downhill.' If we'd listened to that then we would have stopped after episode 13. I'm glad we didn't." ...|$|E
500|$|As a child, Stephen {{was often}} sickly and afflicted by {{constant}} colds. [...] When {{the boy was}} almost two, his father wrote in his diary that his youngest son became [...] "so sick that we are anxious about him." [...] Despite his fragile nature, Crane was an intelligent child who taught himself to read {{before the age of}} four. His first known inquiry, recorded by his father, dealt with writing; at the age of three, while imitating his brother Townley's writing, he asked his mother, [...] "how do you spell O?" [...] In December 1879, Crane wrote a poem about wanting a dog for Christmas. Entitled [...] "I'd Rather Have –", it is his first surviving poem. Stephen was not regularly enrolled in school until January 1880, but he had no difficulty in completing two grades in six weeks. Recalling this feat, he wrote that it [...] "sounds like the lie of a fond mother at a teaparty, but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>remember</b> that I got ahead very fast and that father was very pleased with me." ...|$|E

But <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>remember</b> the rummage sale to which I sent all my old clothes, including a coat that had got mixed up with them by accident, and that I believe I could have worn again.|$|R
500|$|Jean {{continued}} as showrunner after the movie. Critics {{have argued that}} the quality of the show has declined in Jean's tenure. Jacob Burch, an administrator of the website NoHomers.com, {{said in an interview that}} the show [...] "seems less cohesive, more about trying to get the jokes in there, instead of make a story and let the jokes come off of that" [...] and adds [...] "I just think there's only so much you can do [...]" [...] Steven Hyden of The A.V. Club argues in an online debate over this issue that [...] "The Simpsons has come to rely too much on wacky Homer shtick and tired, meaningless guest stars" [...] and that the writers are [...] "content to amuse themselves with in-jokes, non sequiturs, and self-consciously silly plot twists." [...] Jean responded to this criticism by saying: [...] "Well, it's possible that we've declined. But honestly, I've been here the whole time and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>remember</b> in season two people saying, 'It's gone downhill.' If we'd listened to that then we would have stopped after episode 13. I'm glad we didn't." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{the course}} of the show, Val was often played up as the good girl character. When asked about whether Val was a weak character, Van Ark said: [...] "God, no. No she wasn’t. For the very reason that she went through so much and landed on both feet. She was strong in a {{realistic}} kind of way. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>remember</b> that TV Guide did a quote that the three of us can be compared to Earth, Wind and Fire. Michele was the Earth, I was the Wind and Donna was the Fire. I think that really captured it." [...] Van Ark was later asked about who she saw Val as today. She said, [...] "Of course the dysfunctional elements would come out. Why even bother otherwise? But of course they would persevere and still be together after all. I think Valene was headed to, and my sister’s like this, after years of doing everything for her husband and her children, Valene was going to further her achievements in the professional world. I think if you saw Valene today she’d be much more accomplished as a writer and would be very successful overall." [...] The actress also said: ...|$|E
500|$|... "Little Things" [...] {{was written}} by British singer-songwriters Ed Sheeran and Fiona Bevan, and {{produced}} by Jake Gosling. In February 2012, One Direction expressed interest in working with Sheeran for their second studio album. In June 2012, Sheeran disclosed that One Direction would be recording two of his songs. In October 2012, Sheeran acknowledged Bevan's songwriting credit {{in an interview with}} British radio network Capital FM: [...] "The great thing about it is I wrote that song with a girl called Fiona Bevan when I was 17 and we lost the song. I've kept in touch with Fiona, we've done gigs and stuff and about two months ago she sent me the tune and was like, 'Oh, do you remember this?' I was like, 'Yeah, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>remember</b> that', and I was in the studio with the One Direction boys at the time and I was playing it and they were like, 'We really like that'. It's got one of my favourite lines that I've ever written in a song." [...] On 15 October 2012, Louis Tomlinson confirmed via social networking website Twitter that [...] "Little Things" [...] would serve as the second single of their second studio album Take Me Home.|$|E

5000|$|... "Do you {{remember}} line {{dancing on the}} steps?" [...] Without sufficient context, some statements may trigger TDS in order to resolve inherent ambiguity {{in the interpretation of}} a posed question. <b>Do</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> a bygone fad called [...] "line dancing on the steps"? <b>Do</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> personally engaging in dancing in the past? <b>Do</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> my routine practice dancing by focusing {{on the steps of the}} dance? <b>Do</b> <b>I</b> tend to forget about dancing when I am standing on steps? ...|$|R
500|$|Jean {{returned}} full-time to The Simpsons {{during the}} tenth season (1998). He once again became show runner with {{the start of}} the thirteenth season in 2001, this time without Reiss. Jean called it [...] "a great job with a lot of responsibility," [...] and cited [...] "the fact that people love it so much" [...] as [...] "great." [...] He adds, however, that [...] "the hardest thing at this point is just thinking of fresh ideas. People are so on top of things that we've done before, so the challenge now is to think of an idea that's good, but hasn't been seen." [...] Jean's return was initially welcomed, with MSNBC's Jon Bonné stating: [...] "Jean, who took the show's helm from executive producer Mike Scully in 2001, has guided the show away from its gag-heavy, Homer-centric incarnation...these are certainly brighter days for the show's long-time fans." [...] However, some critics have argued that the quality of the show has declined in recent years during Jean's tenure. Jean has responded to this criticism by saying: [...] "Well, it's possible that we've declined. But honestly, I've been here the whole time and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>remember</b> in season two people saying, 'It's gone downhill.' If we'd listened to that then we would have stopped after episode 13. I'm glad we didn't." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{anonymous}} Vita Edwardi Secundi, c.1326AD, wrote: [...] "Indeed <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>remember</b> to {{have heard}} that one man so loved another. Jonathan cherished David, Achilles loved Patroclus." [...] And thus, King Edward II wept for his dead lover Piers Gaveston as: [...] "... David had mourned for Jonathan.". Similarly, Roger of Hoveden, a twelfth-century chronicler, deliberately drew comparisons in his description of “The King of France (Philip II Augustus) [...] loved him (Richard the Lionheart) as his own soul.” ...|$|E

2500|$|I am {{perfectly}} convinced in my {{own mind}} that Shelley never had an improper connexion [...] with Claire ... we lived in lodgings where I had momentary entrance into every room and such a thing could not have passed unknown to me ... <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>remember</b> that Claire did keep to her bed there for two days – but I attended on her – I saw the physician – her illness was one that she had been accustomed to for years – and the same remedies were employed as I had before ministered to her in England.|$|E
2500|$|Rebbe Nachman {{also wrote}} Sefer HaGanuz ("The Hidden Book") and the Sefer HaNisraf ("The Burned Book"), {{neither of which}} is extant. Rebbe Nachman told his disciples that these volumes {{contained}} deep mystical insights that few {{would be able to}} comprehend. While he dictated the Sefer HaNisraf to Reb Noson, the latter said that he did not understand it at all; later he said, [...] "What <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>remember</b> is that it spoke about the greatness of the mitzvah of hospitality and preparing the bed for a guest". Rebbe Nachman never showed the Sefer HaGanuz to anyone. In 1808 Rebbe Nachman burned all the copies of the Sefer HaGanuz and the Sefer Ha-nisraf.|$|E
2500|$|Julie Fernandez, {{who later}} {{appeared}} in BBC television programmes Eldorado and The Office, {{was invited to}} a BBC studio to appear on Jim'll Fix It. She recalled her experience in a radio interview: [...] "I was in my wheelchair, but I just remember [...] hands being everywhere and just lingering those two, three, four seconds slightly too long in places they shouldn't [...] It was in a busy room full {{of people in a}} studio so it was quite discreetly done and you don't kind of realise what's happening at the time, especially when you're 14 and it's the first time you've ever been in a studio and you're very excited. But <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>remember</b> feeling uncomfortable and he had these huge rings on his fingers." ...|$|E

2500|$|She remembered {{having a}} {{photographic}} memory as a child, {{making it easy}} to memorize songs, as well as get her through school tests. She got her first taste of singing solo at a fire hall, where she soaked up the crowd's appreciation. [...] "Sometimes I think that I cheated my own family and my closest friends by giving to audiences so much of the love I might have kept for them. But that's the way I was made; I truly don't think I could help it." [...] (p.20) Martin's craft was developed by seeing movies and becoming a mimic. She would win prizes for looking, acting and dancing like Ruby Keeler and singing exactly like Bing Crosby. [...] "Never, never, never can I say I had a frustrating childhood. It was all joy. Mother used to say she never had seen such a happy child—that I awakened each morning with a smile. I don't remember that, but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>remember</b> that I never wanted to go to bed, to go to sleep, for fear I'd miss something." [...] (p.20) ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Let me shed a bit {{of light}} on things here. Martin and Frazer had this band called Hydra back in 84/85. The most {{impressive}} thing about the band {{was the fact that}} Frazer had already printed some 2 colour t shirts and he had a car! I met Frazer at a local Hell gig in Long Eaton and it turned out they were thinking of getting a second guitarist. I heard a tape (which I still have, it's priceless) of a show they did in a pub in Nottingham and decided to have a jam as I was wanting to get some experience playing, after all I was the ripe old age of 15. Hell, two weeks after I joined, the original guitarist quit (i think this was on the cards) and the drummer left (thankfully) after we did our first demo a couple of months later, I think due to me having a go about his girlfriend being in the studio (you see, good work ethic back then!). It was Tim Bowler (the drummer from Hell) who introduced us to Simon Negus. The name Sabbat came from a book on witchcraft, but I actually found some old school books of mine with ideas doodled on them so I'm sure I had some doing in suggesting it, but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>remember</b> we liked the way the word looked in the scrawly type of writing so we went with it. Yeah the flexi disc for white dwarf was an odd one, John Blanche, the art editor painted our first cover so it all came about quite easy, it does sound shockingly bad though." ...|$|E
2500|$|... “The old days. [...] After all {{the fall}} of 1906 is a far piece back, and high school {{football}} then was a mighty casual and simple thing. [...] That was my senior year and I was a ‘new boy’, having just moved to Massillon that summer from the wide open spaces of South Dakota, Wyoming and Nebraska. [...] The first day at school several of my classmates came around to suggest that of course I was coming out for football; and although I protested that I {{had never had a}} ball in my hands, they countered with the argument that I was a good sized lump of a boy and would make a fine prospect. [...] So I promised. [...] Well the only preparation necessary was to take an old pair of shoes down to the town cobbler and have some cleats nailed on them. [...] I think the athletic association must have had some football pants, but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>remember</b> distinctly that you had to furnish your own stockings (any color) and an old sweater. [...] Put these on and you were in business. [...] I can’t believe that there were more than 11 candidates out because I made the team the first afternoon. [...] Nor did we have a regular coach. [...] A boy named Fritz Merwin, who I think had played the year before was our coach. [...] If you ask me, he’s the one whose picture ought to be hanging up around there someplace. [...] He didn’t get paid anything, and if a coach ever had an awkward squad of 11 nit-wits, he did. [...] But he was out there every afternoon, early and late teaching us fundamentals instead of fancy razzle-dazzle plays, and in the end it paid off because we won a few games. [...] I can’t remember who we beat, but I do recall, painfully even after this lapse of time, that our friends over at the county seat (Canton, Ohio) took us to the cleaners twice.” ...|$|E
