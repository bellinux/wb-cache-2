One notable rector was John Dee, who served from early 1568 until the year 1574, although he was probably never a permanent resident. Dee, a noted mathematician, astrologer, alchemist and astronomer, was on friendly terms with the ruling monarch, Queen ElizabethI, and had given her astrological advice <b>for</b> <b>setting</b> the date of her coronation.|$|E
25|$|Fractal {{dimensions}} {{were first}} applied as an index characterizing complicated geometric forms {{for which the}} details seemed {{more important than the}} gross picture. <b>For</b> <b>sets</b> describing ordinary geometric shapes, the theoretical fractal dimension equals the set's familiar Euclidean or topological dimension. Thus, it is 0 <b>for</b> <b>sets</b> describing points (0-dimensional sets); 1 <b>for</b> <b>sets</b> describing lines (1-dimensional sets having length only); 2 <b>for</b> <b>sets</b> describing surfaces (2-dimensional sets having length and width); and 3 <b>for</b> <b>sets</b> describing volumes (3-dimensional sets having length, width, and height). But this changes <b>for</b> fractal <b>sets.</b> If the theoretical fractal dimension of a set exceeds its topological dimension, the set is considered to have fractal geometry.|$|R

Later in 1927, his works of art were exhibited at the Uzielli Gallery, Frankfurt. During his stay in Germany, he also translated Rainer Maria Rilke's poetry into Urdu, {{which was published in}} the journal of Jamia Millia Islamia. Though, his passion for arts was superseded by the enthusiasm in scientific research, he continued to patronise arts and culture. In 1966, he was at the forefront <b>for</b> <b>setting</b> up the Central Institute of Arts and Crafts in Karachi. He also compiled a selection of poetry of Mir Taqi Mir into Intekhab-e-Meer. In 1983, he published a portfolio collection of charcoal drawings from 1920 to 1950s.|$|E

5|$|On {{taking office}} as Chancellor of the Exchequer Brown gave the Bank of England {{operational}} independence in monetary policy, and thus responsibility <b>for</b> <b>setting</b> interest rates through the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee.

5|$|At {{the close}} of the 1991 season, a {{proposal}} was tabled {{for the establishment of a}} new league that would bring more money into the game overall. The Founder Members Agreement, signed on 17 July 1991 by the game's top-flight clubs, established the basic principles <b>for</b> <b>setting</b> up the FA Premier League. The newly formed top division would have commercial independence from The Football Association and the Football League, giving the FA Premier League licence to negotiate its own broadcast and sponsorship agreements. The argument given at the time was that the extra income would allow English clubs to compete with teams across Europe. Although Dyke played a significant role in the creation of the Premier League, Dyke and ITV would lose out in the bidding for broadcast rights as BSkyB won with a bid of £304million over five years with the BBC awarded the highlights package broadcast on Match of the Day.|$|E
