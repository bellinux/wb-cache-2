40|$|Abstract—This paper {{introduces}} compositional time Petri net (CTPN) models. A CTPN is a modularized time Petri net (TPN), {{which is}} composed of components and connectors. The paper also proposes a set of component-level reduction rules for TPNs. Each of these reduction rules transforms a TPN component to a very simple one while maintaining the net’s <b>external</b> observable <b>timing</b> properties. Consequently, the proposed method works at a coarse level rather than at an individual transition level.

40|$|Abstract. Time Petri Nets (TPNs) are {{a popular}} Petri net model for {{specification}} and verification of real-time systems. A widely applied method for analyzing Petri nets is component-level reduction analysis. The existing technique for component-level reduction analysis transforms a TPN component to a constant size of simple one while maintains the net <b>external</b> observable <b>timing</b> properties, but it neglects the internal properties of component such as synchronization, conflict and concurrency. Based on Delay Time Petri Net (DTPN), the paper transforms a TPN component to DTPN model {{in order to}} preserve such properties as synchronization, conflict and concurrency during the reduction. For the sake of analyzing the DTPN model, the paper proposes new schedule analysis method. Finally, reduction rules based on DTPN are applied to the TPN model analysis in the command and control (C 2) system...|$|R

Timing channels arising from interaction with underlying hardware features such as instruction caches are controlled.

40|$|Natural sounds such as {{communication}} {{signals and}} music {{are composed of}} complex temporal features that cover {{a wide range of}} time scales. Our auditory system excels at resolving this temporal structure and temporal features are crucial for identifying sound qualities and understanding speech. Yet, how auditory cortex neurons encode rapid sound features remains a matter of investigation. To shed light on this issue we recorded the activity of neural populations in caudal auditory cortex of alert macaque monkeys during stimulation with a rapid sequence of synthetic random chords and with naturalistic stimuli. We quantified stimulus discriminability by means of both decoding and information theoretic measures. We used these data to investigate two important questions related to temporal coding in auditory cortex: 1) What is the time scale at which spike patterns of auditory cortex neurons carry sensory information? And 2) is it possible to ‘read’ such temporal activity patterns without having exact knowledge about <b>external</b> stimulus <b>timing?</b> With regard to the first question we find that auditory cortex responses are very precise and can encode stimulus information in spike patterns at the millisecond scale. Importantly, we find that ‘reading’ responses at precisions coarser than 4 ms causes a significant loss in the information, which reaches already 10 at an effective precisions of 6 ms. This information loss induced by ignoring millisecond precise spike patterns was more prominent during stimulation with random chords, but for a subset of neurons also prevailed during stimulation with natural sounds. With regard to the second question we find that one can detect the timing of stimulus onset directly from the population of neural responses with a precision of about 8 ms. This population derived timing defines an internal reference frame {{that can be used for}} temporal response decoding without making reference to an external clock. Quantifying the information lost by using internal rather than external reference frames suggests that the auditory system can well achieve fine temporal stimulus encoding even without precise knowledge about <b>external</b> stimulus <b>timing...</b>|$|R

40|$|A major {{difficulty}} for tracking information flow in multithreaded programs {{is due to}} the internal timing covert channel.

Its basic principle is summarized as follows: a BS emits a pulse indicating its own timing reference and is receptive to pulses from surrounding BSs; internal timing references are adjusted based on the power-weighted average of received pulses. Conditions for convergence were derived in [5], which reveals that convergence and stability are tightly linked to the intersite propagation delays between neighboring BSs. This is a critical issue, as inter-BS propagation delays are not known a priori. Furthermore, in [2], direct communication between BSs is required, and for the exchange of synchronization pulses, a separate frequency band is assumed to be available.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn 1958 MacKay [1] {{showed that}} a rigidly moving object becomes {{visually}} fragmented when {{part of it is}} continuously visible but the rest is illuminated intermittently. For example, the glowing tip of a lit cigarette moving under stroboscopic illumination appeared to move ahead of the intermittently lit body. Latterly rediscovered as “the flash-lag effect” (FLE) [2], this illusion now is typically demonstrated on a computer monitor showing two spots of light, one translating across the screen and another briefly flashed in vertical alignment with it. Despite being physically aligned, the brief flash is seen to lag behind the moving spot. This effect has recently motivated much fruitful research, prompting a variety of potential explanations, including those based on motion extrapolation [2, 3], differential latency [4, 5], attention [6], postdiction [7], and temporal integration [8] (for review, see [9]). With no consensus on which theory is most plausible, we have broadened the scope of enquiry to include audition and have found that the FLE is not confined to vision. Whether the auditory motion stimulus is a frequency sweep or a translating sound source, briefly presented auditory stimuli lag behind auditory movement. In addition, when we used spatial motion, we found that the FLE can occur cross-modally. Together, these findings challenge several FLE theories and point to a discrepancy between internal brain <b>timing</b> and <b>external</b> stimulus <b>timing...</b>|$|R
40|$|Legumes form a highly-regulated {{symbiotic}} relationship with specific soil bacteria known as rhizobia. This interaction {{results in the}} de novo formation of root organs called nodules, in which the rhizobia fix atmospheric di-nitrogen (N- 2) for the plant. Molecular mechanisms that regulate the nodulation process include the systemic 2 ̆ 7 autoregulation of nodulation 2 ̆ 7 and the local nitrogen-regulation of nodulation pathways. Both pathways are mediated by novel peptide hormones called CLAVATA/ESR-related (CLE) peptides that act to suppress nodulation via negative feedback loops. The mature peptides are 12 - 13 amino acids in length and are post-translationally modified from the C-terminus of tripartite-domain prepropeptides. Structural redundancy between the prepropeptides exists; however, variations in <b>external</b> stimuli, <b>timing</b> of expression, tissue specificity and {{presence or absence of}} key functional domains enables them to act in a specific manner.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to quantify the differences in lumbopelvic movement pattern during the passive hip external rotation (PHER) test in LBP patients with and without rotational demand activities (RDA). MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 30 subjects with LBP, including 15 patients with-RDA and 15 patients without-RDA were enrolled. A passive hip external rotation test was performed. Pelvic and hip rotation over the full range of the test, timing of hip and pelvic motion, and pelvic rotation in the first half of the movement were measured using a 3 -D motion analysis system. RESULTS Passive pelvic rotation during the test in the group with RDA was significantly greater than in the other group. However, there was no significant difference between the groups in other kinematic variables, including hip <b>external</b> rotation, <b>timing</b> of hip and pelvic motion and pelvic rotation in the first half of the movement (p > 0. 05).

We report that the neuropeptide PDF receptor and the circadian photoreceptor CRYPTOCROME (CRY) are precisely co-expressed in a subset of pacemakers, and that these pathways together provide a requisite drive for circadian control of daily locomotor rhythms. These convergent signaling pathways influence the phase of rhythm generation, but also its amplitude. In the absence of both pathways, PER rhythms were greatly reduced in only those specific pacemakers that receive convergent inputs and PER levels remained high in the nucleus throughout the day. This suggested a large-scale dis-regulation of the pacemaking machinery. Behavioral rhythms were likewise disrupted: in light:dark conditions they were aberrant, and under constant dark conditions, they were lost.
