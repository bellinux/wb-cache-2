They again saw print in 2003, in a {{critical}} edition co-edited by daughter Mitzura Arghezi (Domnica Theodorescu) and Traian Radu. According to philogist Gheorghe Pienescu, who collected and reedited the texts for printing in the 1960s, the copies were taken from him under <b>false</b> <b>pretense</b> by Mitzura Arghezi, and never returned. As an additional contribution to Romanian literature, Searas popularization of the expression craii de Curtea-Veche may have inspired Mateiu Caragiale in writing his celebrated 1929 novel.|$|E
25|$|At Maio, the easternmost of the Cape Verde's Sotavento islands, Every {{committed}} {{his first}} piracy, robbing three English merchantmen from Barbados of provisions and supplies. Nine {{of the men}} from these ships were quickly persuaded to join Every's crew, who now numbered about ninety-four men. Every then sailed to the Guinea coast, where he tricked a local chieftain into boarding the Fancy under the <b>false</b> <b>pretense</b> of trade, and forcibly took his and his men's wealth, leaving them slaves. Continuing to hug the African coastline, Every then stopped at Bioko in the Bight of Benin, where the Fancy was careened and razeed. By cutting {{away some of the}} superstructure to improve the ship's speed, the Fancy became one of the fastest vessels then sailing in the Atlantic Ocean. In October 1694, the Fancy captured two Danish privateers near the island of Príncipe, stripping the ships of ivory and gold and welcoming approximately seventeen defecting Danes aboard.|$|E

2500|$|The sources {{compiled}} by Iorga suggest that Hrizea {{never managed to}} rekindle the revolt with his presence, being betrayed by a Transylvanian Romanian notable in whose house he was lodging, and then delivered to Wallachia as a prisoner. His cause had remained popular with both the mercenaries and the Wallachian commoners. Some 400 Seimeni had grouped in northern Oltenia, possibly at Bistrița Monastery, where they expected his return. A Wallachian army, led by Brâncoveanu, met them in Gorj County, at Târgul Bengăi or Bengești-Ciocadia. As noted by Iorga, {{they were asked to}} surrender but refused, and were then decimated. Other reports suggest that they were [...] "not defeated", but promised safe haven, and disarmed under this <b>false</b> <b>pretense.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Front Palace guards {{immediately}} set {{off from}} their quarters to help extinguish the fire.

Vichaichan had [...] remained in his palace, instead of leading his men to the Grand Palace. This was contrary to ancient custom, which dictated that he must {{take an active role in}} defending the Royal compound and the king in any situation.

2500|$|The {{religious}} factor {{combined with}} a power struggle between Kỳ and General Nguyễn Chánh Thi, the commander of I Corps, a Buddhist local to the region and popular in the area. Thi was a strong-willed officer regarded as a capable commander, and Kỳ saw him as a threat, as did others within the junta. In March 1966, Kỳ fired Thi and ordered him into exile in the United States under the <b>false</b> <b>pretense</b> of medical treatment. This prompted both civilians and some I Corps units to launch widespread civil protests against Kỳ's regime and halt military operations against Viet Cong. Kỳ gambled by allowing Thi to return to I Corps before departing for the US, but {{the arrival of the}} general to his native area only fuelled anti-Kỳ sentiment. The Buddhist activists, students and Thi loyalists in the military coalesced into the [...] "Struggle Movement", calling for a return to civilian rule and elections. Meanwhile, Thi stayed in I Corps and did not leave; strikes and protests stopped civilian activity in the area, government radio stations were taken over and used for anti-Kỳ campaigning, and military operations ceased. Riots also spread to the capital Saigon and other cities further south.|$|E

60|$|Cyrus {{was thrown}} into a fever of {{excitement}} and agitation on reading this letter. He determined to accede to Harpagus's proposal. He revolved in his mind for some time the measures by which he could raise the necessary force. Of course he could not openly announce his plan and enlist an army to effect it, for any avowed and public movement of that kind would be immediately made known to Astyages, who, by being thus forewarned of his enemies' designs, might take effectual measures to circumvent them. He determined to resort to deceit, or, as he called it, stratagem; nor did he probably have any distinct perception of the wrongfulness of such a mode of proceeding. The demon of war upholds and justifies falsehood and treachery, in all its forms, {{on the part of}} his votaries. He always applauds a forgery, a <b>false</b> <b>pretense,</b> or a lie: he calls it a stratagem.|$|E
60|$|While {{speaking}} {{on the subject of}} patronage, I cannot but allude to two appointments which had been made by political interest, and with the circumstances of which I became acquainted. In both instances a good place had been given to a gentleman by the incoming President-- not in return for political support, but from motives of private friendship--either his own friendship or that of some mutual friend. In both instances I heard the selection spoken of with the warmest praise, as though a noble act had been done in the selection of a private friend instead of a political partisan. And yet in each case a man was appointed who knew nothing of his work; who, from age and circumstances, was not likely to become acquainted with his work; who, by his appointment, kept out of the place those who did understand the work, and had earned a right to promotion by so understanding it. Two worthy gentlemen--for they were both worthy-- were pensioned on the government for a term of years under a <b>false</b> <b>pretense.</b> That this should have been done is not perhaps remarkable; but it did seem remarkable to me that everybody regarded such appointments as a good deed--as a deed so exceptionably good as to be worthy of great praise. I do not allude to these selections on account of the political view shown by the Presidents in making them, but on account of the political virtue; in order that the nature of political virtue in the States may be understood. It had never occurred to any one to whom I spoke on the subject, that a President in the bestowing of such places was bound to look for efficient work in return for the public money which was to be paid.|$|E
