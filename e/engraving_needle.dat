Drums were often put far from the horn (part of the mechanical transducer) to reduce sound distortion. Since this affected the rendition of cymbals at playback, sound engineers of the time remedied the situation by asking drummers to play {{the content of the}} cymbals onto woodblocks, temple blocks, and cowbells for their loudness and short decay.|$|E
5000|$|A Frenchman named Gilles-Louis Chrétien {{invented the}} [...] "physionotrace" [...] in 1783-84 {{to aid in}} the {{production}} of silhouette portraits which became popular during the reign of Louis XIV. Chrétien's partner, Edme Quenedey, made a drawing of the instrument in 1788, which now sits in the Bibliothèque Nationale de France. Chrétien's device used the mechanics of the pantograph to transmit the tracing (via an eyepiece) of the subject's profile silhouette to an <b>engraving</b> <b>needle.</b> Thus it enabled the production of multiple portrait copies.|$|E

In the laboratory where the couple's eggs and sperm samples are being mixed, the scientist takes a large, <b>engraved</b> metal <b>needle</b> and injects a red substance into Craig's sperm without the couple's knowledge.

5|$|The tomb {{had been}} {{extensively}} plundered by tomb robbers during antiquity, yet numerous stone vessels and earthen jars remained. Some {{of the stone}} vessels had copper-coated rims and {{are similar to the}} better known finds from tomb of Khasekhemwy. Vessels from preceding rulers such as Nynetjer and Raneb were also found. Beads and bracelets made of fayence and carnelian and tools made of copper were excavated. Special findings include a silver <b>needle</b> <b>engraved</b> with the name of king Hor Aha and clay seal fragments with the name of king Sekhemib. The two stone stelae from the entrance, common to burial chambers of the First and Second dynasties, are now on display in two different museums.|$|R
5000|$|Kudryashov’s work is {{difficult}} to categorize since it is at once both representational and abstract. He {{does not want to}} be pigeonholed and believes that ideology is the enemy of art because it limits the human imagination. [...] Although his work is influenced by Russian constructivism and Suprematism, Lubok prints, and Russian Orthodox icons, Kudryashov does not share their utopian ideals. [...] Kudryashov creates sculpture, videos, performance pieces, book illustrations, and an occasional collage but, is primarily a printmaker. His favorite technique is drypoint and engraving and his preferred material is the industrial zinc plate. Kudryashov does no preparatory studies prior to drawing directly on the plate using a large burin or <b>engraving</b> <b>needle.</b> For his larger prints he lays the sheet of zinc directly on the floor and works from all sides. For colored prints, paint is applied to the paper before being run through the press with the inked zinc plate.|$|E

Gravure {{printing}} {{has been}} applied widely in flexible packaging, building materials and other fields, and amount of ink transfer {{is an important factor}} to affect the printing quality and depends largely on the volume of the gravure cell. The volume of cell is affected by gravure process parameters such as screen lines, cell angle and <b>engraving</b> <b>needle</b> angle, so the volume of cell is calculated difficulty, and it is difficulty for the optimization of the gravure plate-making process. This paper presents a computing model calculating the volume of gravure cell. The cells for three kind of dot coverage rate are carved with 70 LPC screening lines and 120 ° needle angle, their opening length, width and depth are measured by cell measuring instrument, their relation is been found by MATLAB and the computing model is built to calculate the cell volume model. The results show that the computing model is suitable for different cell angle, and the cell volume depends the screening rules, cell angle, needle angle and the cell depth. If the depth for different dot coverage rate is measured the cell volume will be calculated...|$|E
