In {{electronic}} flexible {{printed circuit}} (E-FPC) manufacturing procedure, the cover laminating {{process in which the}} line circuit (copper wire) is covered with hot cover layer on the printed circuits is importance process. This process will help to increase elasticity, strength and corrosion protection to the product therefore this process can affect directly to quality of the printed circuit. The process for laminating printed circuits can be classified into two methods by coating with industry iron and <b>hot</b> <b>bar</b> machine. This article compares the quality of the electrical circuit between industry iron and <b>hot</b> <b>bar</b> machine methods in the cover coating process by using Peeling Strength to indicate the quality in the same temperature and time condition. The experimental result illustrates the electrical circuits using the <b>hot</b> <b>bar</b> machine method give Peeling Strength value in the acceptable range and the laminating surface of circuits is smooth and uniform. On the other hand, Peel Strength value of electrical circuits using the industry iron method is unsteady and lower than the acceptable range. Moreover the result circuit product has wrinkled coating surface and become the waste product...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This study {{investigates the}} shape {{evolution}} of the pinholes on the bloom surfaces, which are originated from the continuous casting process, during multi-pass <b>hot</b> <b>bar</b> rolling. It is important to track the shape {{evolution of the}} pinholes since they can be formed as the sharp surface cracks after <b>hot</b> <b>bar</b> rolling and can initiate the surface bursts in the cold forging process. It {{is very hard to}} track the deformation behavior of the pinholes with detection tools during hot rolling, so the numerical simulations can be properly utilized. In general, the size of the pinholes in the bloom surface is order of micrometer although the bloom size is order of millimeter. This size discrepancy between them makes it difficult to discretize the domain including the pinholes for the finite element (FE) simulations. To overcome this limitation of the conventional FE simulation, multi-scale technique coupling the macro and micro models was developed in current study. This technique was implemented into the commercial simulation code, DEFORM- 3 D. The developed multi-scale simulation technique was capable of simulating the shape evolution of the pinholes through multi-pass <b>hot</b> <b>bar</b> rolling successfully. It is concluded that aspect ratio of the initial pinhole should be larger than 2. 0 approximately to prevent it folded...|$|R
40|$|Curcumin is {{the major}} {{phenolic}} diarylheptane derivative in Curcuma longa and {{has been reported to}} possess pharmacological activities. Unfortunately this compound suffers from poor bioavailability and rapid neutral-alkaline degradation. Co-crystal of curcumin is one option under exploration, motivated by the fact that a number of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) co-crystals with improved dissolution have recently been synthesized. Hence, co-crystallization technique highlights an alternative means to improve the performance of curcumin. Within our work evidences for a co-crystal was ascertained from DSC, <b>Kofler</b> <b>hot</b> stage screening and PXRD, and all confirmed a new crystal phase could have been formed between curcumin and a co-crystallizing agent, nicotinamide. We report that re-crystallization step essentially aids the purification of commercial curcumin, a herbal based actives. Otherwise the prevalence of a new crystal phase in solvent-mediated co-crystallization will be significantly reduced. Besides, phase diagram is an effective tool for the study of solubility behaviours in co-crystal system. In order to acquire related techniques, fenbufen, a poorly water soluble drug, was selected. The result showed the huge difference in solubility between fenbufen and nicotinamide lead to difficulty in the construction of phase diagram...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to adjust the roll gap for the dimension accuracy of <b>bar</b> in <b>hot</b> <b>bar</b> rolling process considering roll wear. In this study <b>hot</b> <b>bar</b> rolling processes for round and oval passes have been investigated. In order to predict the roll wear, the wear model is reformulated as an incremental form and then wear depth of roll is calculated at each deformation step on contact area using the results of finite element analysis, such as relative sliding velocity and normal pressure at contact area. Archard’s wear model was applied to predict the roll wear. To know the effects of thermal softening of DCI (Ductile Cast Iron) roll material according to operating conditions, high temperature micro hardness test is executed and a new wear model has been proposed by considering the thermal softening of DCI roll expressed in terms of the main tempering curve. The new technique developed in this study for adjusting roll gap can give more systematically and economically feasible means to improve the dimension accuracy of bar with full usefulness and generality...|$|R

Results show that fatigue cracks in pearlitic steels initiate at the wire surface starting from small defects, whose size decreases with the drawing process. Fatigue cracks created from defects (initiation phase) exhibit a fractographic appearance consisting of ductile microtearing events which can be classified as tearing topography surface or TTS, and exhibit a remarkably lower spacing in the prestressing steel wire than in the <b>hot</b> rolled <b>bar.</b> In addition, some S-N tests were performed in both material forms under a stress range of about half the yield strength.

At the micro-level, the cold drawn pearlitic steel exhibits higher micro-roughness than the <b>hot</b> rolled <b>bar</b> (this is a consequence of the manufacturing process by cold drawing), so that the actual fractured surface in the cold drawn wire is greater than that in the <b>hot</b> rolled <b>bar,</b> {{due to the fact that}} the crack deflection events are more frequent and with higher angle in the former (the heavily drawn prestressing steel wire).
