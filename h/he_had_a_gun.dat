5|$|Berkman {{was ready}} {{to carry out the}} {{assassination}} on July21. He wore a new suit and a black derby hat, and in his pockets <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> and a dagger fashioned from a steel file. He went to Frick's office and asked to see him, saying he was the representative of a New York hiring agency, but he was told Frick was too busy to meet him. The following night, Berkman checked into a hotel under the name Rakhmetov, his role model from What Is to Be Done? On July23, he returned to Frick's office. While the attendant told Frick that the New York employment agent had returned to see him, Berkman burst into the office and took aim at Frick's head. After two shots, Berkman was tackled to the ground. Still, he managed to pull out the dagger and stab Frick three times.|$|E
25|$|On October 8, 2014, Vonderrit Myers Jr. {{was shot}} and killed by an off-duty police officer in St. Louis. Police said <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> and shot at them. Doug Hollis of St. Louis, a {{relative}} of both Myers and Michael Brown, did not witness the shooting but told USA Today that Myers was unarmed, with only a sandwich in his hands, and suggested that the gun found at the scene might have been planted by police. Following the shooting, there were multiple nights of protests. Forensic evidence later confirmed that Myers had gunshot residue on his right hand, shirt, and pants, indicating that he had fired a gun. Three bullets fired at police matched Myers's gun. The family's attorney noticed that police versions differ about the weapon Myers allegedly used: first, police mentioned a 9mm Ruger, and later a 9mm Smith & Wesson. Although later determined that Myers did have a gun and it matched the same gun he was seen in various photos posted to social media. An independent autopsy by Dr. Cyril H. Wecht found that six of the eight wounds were {{at the back of the}} body. Police investigators served Wecht with a subpoena for his results. The funeral was held on October 26.|$|E
25|$|The Fortune next headed northwards towards Newfoundland, raiding Canso, Nova Scotia, and {{capturing}} {{a number}} of ships around Cape Breton and the Newfoundland banks. Roberts raided the harbour of Ferryland, capturing a dozen vessels. On 21 June, he attacked the larger harbour of Trepassey, sailing in with black flags flying. In the harbour he discovered 22 merchant ships and 150 fishing ships, {{all of which were}} abandoned by their panic-stricken captains and crews, and the pirates were masters of Trepassey without any resistance being offered. Roberts had captured all 22 merchant ships, but was angered by the cowardice of the captains who had fled their ships. Every morning <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> fired and the captains were forced to attend Roberts on board his ship; they were told that anyone who was absent would have his ship burnt. One brig from Bristol was taken over by the pirates to replace the sloop Fortune and fitted out with 16 guns. When the pirates left in late June, all the other vessels in the harbour were set on fire. During July, Roberts captured nine or ten French ships and commandeered one of them, fitting her with 26 cannons and changing her name to the Good Fortune. With this more powerful ship, the pirates captured many more vessels before heading south for the West Indies, accompanied by Montigny la Palisse's sloop, which had rejoined them.|$|E

60|$|The slaves, too, were gloomy, as all natives {{are when}} {{suddenly}} awakened in the night; {{but as the}} light grew they became more cheerful.

50|$|On the plane, Marker {{shows the}} other two that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun,</b> and confesses to {{stealing}} the briefcase.

During the commotion that arises, Marker manages to sneak off the plane unseen.|$|R
500|$|The defendant, John Williams, {{was called}} next. Williams {{claimed that the}} package {{containing}} the rope and the gun {{had been given to}} him by a fellow thief called [...] "Freddy Mike", who had asked him to keep the package until Mike came to collect it. After the murder, Williams was scared that he would be suspected, since <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> and had been arrested previously for burglary.|$|E
500|$|Aldermen Edward Jones (20th) and William C. Henry (24th) {{were the}} first aldermen to arrive from the City Council session. According to the federal lawsuit, Henry showed <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun,</b> and then with Jones removed the now-hung {{painting}} {{from the wall and}} placed it on the floor, facing the wall. After they left, another student rehung the painting. Three other aldermen, Allan Streeter (17th), Dorothy Tillman (3rd) and Rush, arrived later. They took down the painting and attempted to remove it from the school, but were stopped by a school official. The aldermen then took the painting to the office of the school president Anthony Jones (no relation to Edward Jones). The painting had a [...] gash, and it had been wrapped in brown paper.|$|E
2500|$|Vang further {{testified that}} Joseph Crotteau {{deserved}} to die [...] "because he {{accused me of}} giving him the finger and tried to cut {{in front of me}} to stop me from leaving." [...] And Laski deserved to die because <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun,</b> he said. Vang re-enacted his deeds while on the stand, using his hands and arms to imitate the motions of firing a rifle. Vang's lawyers commented that some of his abnormal remarks were due to the language barrier. Therefore, when Vang responded affirmatively to the question that Mr. Crotteau and Mr. Laski [...] "deserved to die," [...] his meaning implied that the men contributed to the circumstances that led to their deaths.|$|E

2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} bombing, while driving on I-35 in Noble County, near Perry, Oklahoma, McVeigh {{was stopped by}} Oklahoma State Trooper Charles J. Hanger. Hanger had passed McVeigh's yellow 1977 Mercury Marquis and noticed {{that it had no}} license plate. McVeigh {{admitted}} to the police officer (who noticed a bulge under his jacket) that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> and McVeigh was subsequently arrested for having driven without plates and illegal firearm possession; McVeigh's concealed weapon permit was not legal in Oklahoma. McVeigh was wearing a T-shirt at that time with a picture of Abraham Lincoln and the motto: sic semper tyrannis ('Thus always to tyrants'), the supposed words shouted by John Wilkes Booth after he shot Lincoln. On the back, it had a tree with a picture of three blood droplets and the Thomas Jefferson quote, [...] "The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants." [...] Three days later, while still in jail, McVeigh was identified as the subject of the nationwide manhunt.|$|E

Louanne enters her dressing room and is shocked to find Miguel. Wally soon appears and pretends <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> to intimidate Miguel; he gives the [...] "gun" [...] to Connie Lamont (James Murray) because <b>he</b> <b>has</b> to go on stage.

60|$|Half an {{hour later}} Captain Jerry and Dick set out. Each carried a few ship's {{biscuits}} and also a heavy stick which had been cut in the thickets. Each wished <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> or a pistol, but those articles {{were not to be}} had.|$|E
