5|$|Jesus for President {{is divided}} into four chapters, the first two of which {{summarize}} the Bible from a New Monastic perspective. The summary of the Old Testament argues that the Israelites had a unique political philosophy, but that they {{failed to live up}} to its implications. The New Testament summary considers Jesus' politics and the qualities of the Christian Church. The third chapter suggests implications of this narrative for citizens of the United States, who the authors describe as members of an empire similar to that of the Romans. This chapter argues that the Book of Revelation has more to do with living faithfully in an <b>evil</b> <b>empire</b> than with eschatology. The chapter also asserts that Constantinianism had generally negative consequences for the Church. The fourth chapter tells of Christians living in countercultural ways that model divine redemption towards others. Other stories involve heterodox economics, defending the homeless, Amish forgiveness, dumpster diving, missional robotics, Martin Luther King Jr., anti-war protests, and The Simple Way.|$|E

25|$|Some in the Republican Party support unilateralism {{on issues}} of {{national}} security, believing in the ability and right of the United States to act without external support in matters of its national defense. In general, Republican thinking on defense and international relations is heavily influenced by the theories of neorealism and realism, characterizing conflicts between nations as struggles between faceless forces of international structure, {{as opposed to being}} the result of the ideas and actions of individual leaders. The realist school's influence shows in Reagan's <b>Evil</b> <b>Empire</b> stance on the Soviet Union and George W. Bush's Axis of evil stance.|$|E

[...] Persall expressed frustration when Alexander did not answer specific questions about his inspiration and influences used in the film, citing concerns that: [...] "the <b>evil</b> <b>empire</b> will jump all over whoever else is going to show it next." [...] Though the review was not favorable, Persall wrote that the film would have been a more powerful piece as a truthful documentary, and not a parody, writing: [...] "The Profit would make a stronger statement if Alexander used his Scientology experience to produce a documentary or a no-holds-barred version of Hubbard's life that calls him Hubbard." ...|$|E
