50|$|Investigative access - {{making sure}} {{encrypted}} communications are {{accessible to the}} U.S. Government. While few would argue {{with the need for}} the government to access its own internal communications, the NSA Clipper chip proposal to extend this key <b>escrow</b> <b>requirement</b> to public use of cryptography was highly controversial.|$|E
50|$|To {{comply with}} that law, issuers {{typically}} buy {{a mix of}} ordinary Treasury securities in the open market or special securities, called slugs, from the Treasury. In yield burning, underwriters sell the issuers Treasury securities at inflated prices, which cuts the yield to levels that appear to meet the <b>escrow</b> <b>requirements</b> but that also generate substantial profits for the underwriters. By some estimates, underwriters may have earned $2 billion to $3 billion of illegal profits from yield burning since the late 1970s.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{concerns}} that {{widespread use of}} strong cryptography would hamper government use of wiretaps, NSA proposed the concept of key escrow in 1993 and introduced the Clipper chip that would offer stronger protection than DES but would allow access to encrypted data by authorized law enforcement officials. The proposal was strongly opposed and key <b>escrow</b> <b>requirements</b> ultimately went nowhere. However, NSA's Fortezza hardware-based encryption cards, created for the Clipper project, are still used within government, and NSA ultimately declassified and published {{the design of the}} Skipjack cipher used on the cards.|$|R
5000|$|Following the {{appointment}} of UniForum by the AUC, the “AfricaInOneSpace” was formed to handle the AUC led initiative {{which is based on}} governmental ownership and leadership. This is evidenced by the contract between the AUC and UniForum/ZACR, which not only specifies that the AUC would have all the rights to the [...]Africa registry technical databases and intellectual property but also gives the AUC the right to change the registry operator at any time; which essentially makes ZACR a proxy for the AUC, even though technically the AUC did not and cannot apply for [...]Africa. Such provisions in that agreement between the AUC and UniForum/ZACR are in direct violation of many important aspects of the ICANN new gTLD Program, since all registry technical data, including data <b>escrow</b> <b>requirements,</b> technically and legally belong to ICANN and not to the AUC. [...] It is likely that ZACR agreed to these rather “extra-ordinary conditions” to enable the AUC accept to appoint the organization as a registry operator for [...]Africa.|$|R

50|$|The {{particulars}} of the Statutes are as follows. Section 480-b requires cigarette manufacturers to certify annually, to the New York State Commissioner of Taxation and Finance, the Attorney General of the State of New York, and the cigarette tax stamp agents (according to appellants, usually wholesalers 6 responsible for affixing New York State cigarette tax stamps on such manufacturer's cigarettes), that such manufacturer is either: (a) a PM making payments under the MSA (i.e. satisfying Section 1399-pp(1) of the Escrow Statute) or (b) {{in compliance with}} the <b>escrow</b> <b>requirements</b> of Section 1399-pp(2) of the Escrow Statute. Section 480-b also prohibits New York State cigarette tax stamp agents from affixing tax stamps to cigarettes if the relevant manufacturer has not provided the required certification or if the tax stamp agent has been notified by the Commissioner of Public Health that such manufacturer is in violation of the Escrow Statute. Section 1846 provides for seizure and forfeiture of any cigarettes that are unstamped or have been stamped in violation of Section 480-b. Section 481, subdiv. 1(c) authorizes imposition of civil penalties upon any manufacturer or agent violating Section 480-b.|$|R
5000|$|DCA Trust {{had read}} and {{understood}} the published {{parts of the}} application for [...]Africa that was submitted by UniForum ZA Central Registry and concluded that such provisions in that agreement between the AUC and UniForum/ZACR are in direct violation of many {{important aspects of the}} ICANN new gTLD Program, since all registry technical data, including data <b>escrow</b> <b>requirements,</b> technically and legally belong to ICANN and not to the AUC. It is likely that ZACR agreed to these rather “extra-ordinary conditions” to enable the AUC accept to appoint the organization as a registry operator for [...]Africa. Additionally, DCA wrote to ICANN that the UniForum application was not submitted on behalf of the African Community, and also wrote and posted several public comments against the UniForum application {{to draw attention to the}} fact that UniForum had not submitted a Community TLD application for [...]Africa. DCA also made other objection to ZACR application and submitted officially to ICANN evaluators. DCA then requested that ICANN disqualify ZACR immediately based on the merits of its application and its failure to follow the new gTLD AGB procedures. [...] Not only did the application reveal this improper agreement with the AU to grant it these rights, but it also contemplated vesting legal or executive responsibility in an organization that did not have any formal role or executive responsibility at ZACR and delegating responsibility for overseeing [...]AFRICA to an entity not yet legally established. These comments, however, were ignored by ICANN.|$|R
40|$|Federal {{involvement}} in securitized loans provided a buffer for lenders to make increasingly risky loans for over seventy years. As lenders {{took advantage of}} government protections, securitized loans—the primary source of financing for real estate—were packaged together into trusts and segmented by tranches, which were then assessed a risk factor by a rating agency, and sold together. By the mid- 1990 s, Wall Street financiers were lending to middle-class Americans through “exotic, untested financial products” that ultimately led to the subprime mortgage crisis of the late 2000 s. The Great Recession depleted spending power and rendered many contracts susceptible to legal attack by consumers who hoped to recover some of their assets. Few industries were as vulnerable to these attacks as real estate, and those {{areas of the country}} with the highest densities of new commercial construction were hit hardest. As a result of a clause buried deep in Florida’s statutes, South Floridian developers were particularly exposed to deposit refund claims. This article provides a unique and important analysis about the interpretation of <b>escrow</b> <b>requirements</b> in Fla. Stat. § 718. 202 threatened to criminalize unsuspecting condominium developers and bankrupt their companies. The interpretation, set forth in Double AA Int’l Inv. Group, Inc. v. Swire Pac. Holdings, created a dire situation that allowed buyers to void their condominium preconstruction contracts and forced developers to seek returns in commissions from brokerage firms. But for the Florida Supreme Court’s unprecedented civil use of the “rule of leniency” in CRC 603, LLC v. North Carillon, LLC, many developers were at risk of being charged with a felony of the third degree. The depth of this article’s appeal, however, expands far beyond the scope of a simple case analysis. This article is the first to analyze how Florida’s change in interpretation has directly shifted the paradigm for new condominium financing, as developers have transitioned from traditional financing models involving securities to a South American-influenced buyer-deposit model. While this later model requires whopping deposits of fifty to eighty percent of the final purchase price for preconstruction units, South Americans, in particular, have been quick to pony up the cash with the expectation that such new condominiums are the most stable investment their money can buy. Shockingly, units in new buildings are selling out months before developers break ground. As a result of these new financing techniques, Miami as we know it is not the same Miami as it existed a mere decade ago. This article concludes by analyzing the sustainability of these changes and predicts whether this new financing archetype is susceptible to the risks that plagued the traditional model and instigated the boom-or-bust cycles of the past century...|$|R
