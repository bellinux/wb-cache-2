60|$|Auchincloss {{stood up}} and, shaking himself {{as if to}} ward off his testy temper, <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> on Dale's arm.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> {{on either}} side of his head and rocked himself to and fro, droning to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words.|$|E
60|$|The girl sat very insecurely, {{clinging}} fast. <b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> on her waist, {{to support}} her. And {{he held her}} closely, he clasped her as in an embrace, he was weak with desire as he strode beside her.|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't say nothing, sir, for I {{could make}} neither head nor tail {{of what he}} was saying, and, I dessay, looked as {{surprised}} as might be. Then he takes a step forward, and <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> on my shoulder, and says he: ...|$|R
60|$|Sir Oliver smiled wistfully. <b>He</b> <b>put</b> out <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> {{and took}} his brother's.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>put</b> forth <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> {{to touch}} her arm, and she drew it back as if his fingers were of fire.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes--the one Slingerland told me about--the {{girl with}} big eyes," [...] replied Neale. <b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> softly on her head. It was warm. Her hair felt silky, and the touch sent a quiver over him. Probably she was dying.|$|E
60|$|He made a {{pretense of}} leaving, and <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> to his pocket {{as if to}} insure the safety of some article. Columbine blushed. She held out her hands. She was repentant of her words and curious as to his.|$|E
60|$|Somehow Bostil {{could not}} find words for {{what he wanted to}} say. <b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> on the red stallion--patted his shoulder. Then he gripped Slone close and hard. He was {{thinking}} how he would have gloried in a son like this young, wild rider. Then he again faced his comrades.|$|E
6000|$|... "He run the King down--carryin' weight--with a {{long lead}} to overcome!" [...] Slone muttered, and <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> shaking <b>hand</b> on the horse's wet neck.|$|R
60|$|The old sailor {{was still}} bewildered. <b>He</b> <b>put</b> out <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> indeed, {{but he was}} too late, for now the bananas {{disappeared}} and lemons took their place.|$|R
60|$|Then Dale {{stood beside}} Helen. How tall he was! His wide {{shoulders}} seemed {{on a level}} with the pommel of her saddle. <b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>an</b> affectionate <b>hand</b> on the horse.|$|R
60|$|And Sir Rowland, realizing, too, by {{now that}} here was no ghost, {{recovered}} his lost courage. <b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> to his sword, then withdrew it, leaving the weapon sheathed. Here was a hangman's job, not a swordsman's, he opined--and wisely, for he had had earlier experience of Mr. Wilding's play of steel.|$|E
60|$|Succinctly now Captain Blood dispelled {{the mystery}} by a {{relation}} of the facts. It was a narrative that painted red and white by turns the Spaniard's countenance. <b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> {{to the back of}} his head, and there discovered, in confirmation of the story, a lump as large as a pigeon's egg. Lastly, he stared wild-eyed at the sardonic Captain Blood.|$|E
6000|$|Unc' Billy {{looked at}} Peter {{very hard for}} a few minutes, just as if he thought that Peter was crazy already. Then <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> behind one ear just {{as if he was}} hard of hearing. [...] "Ah beg yo' pardon, Brer Rabbit, but Ah don' seem to have it quite right in mah haid what yo'all am going down to the Laughing Brook for," [...] said Unc' Billy in the politest way.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, judge!" [...] he said, and <b>he</b> <b>put</b> out <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> which Kenton {{took with}} {{trembling}} reluctance and a dazed stare. [...] "I thought you sailed last Saturday!" ...|$|R
60|$|He looked down. Minnie's soft {{hair was}} resting against his knee. <b>He</b> <b>put</b> out <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> and stroked it. She {{turned and looked}} up, and he met her big eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{just never}} {{can get by}} this place," [...] {{explained}} the rancher, as he came and stood so that <b>he</b> could <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> on Dorn's knee. [...] "Look, son--an' Lenore, don't you miss this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I reckon I'd be glad," [...] {{answered}} King. <b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> on Neale's face. [...] "You shore have fever." [...] He {{left the}} tent, to return presently with {{a roll of}} blankets and a canteen. Then he awkwardly began to bathe Neale's face with cold water. There was a flickering camp-fire outside that threw shadows {{on the wall of}} the tent. By its light Neale saw that King's left hand was bandaged and that he used it clumsily.|$|E
6000|$|Dear me, dear me! Grandfather Frog was boasting. If he {{had been}} safe {{at home in the}} Smiling Pool, there might have been some excuse for boasting, but way over here in the Long Lane, not even knowing {{the way back to the}} Smiling Pool, it was foolish, very foolish indeed. No one knew that better than Striped Chipmunk, but he has a great deal of respect for Grandfather Frog, and he knew too that Grandfather Frog was feeling very much out of sorts and very much mortified to think that {{he had been}} caught in such a scrape, so <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> over his mouth to hide a smile as he said: ...|$|E
60|$|Leaping {{in with a}} rush, the Turks {{shut and}} barred the door. They saw Lancey, but had evidently {{no time to waste}} on him. The window-frame was dashed out with rifle-butts, and quick firing was {{commenced}} by some, while others made loop-holes in the mud walls with their bayonets. Bullets came pinging through the window and brought down masses of plaster from the walls. Suddenly a terrible yell rang in the little room, and the commander of the party, raising both hands above him, dropped his sword and fell with a terrible crash. <b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> to his side and writhed on the floor in agony, while blood flowed copiously from his wound. The poor fellow's pain lasted but a moment or two. His head fell back suddenly, and the face became ashy pale, while his glaring eyeballs were transfixed in death.|$|E
60|$|Slone sat up. The {{smoke was}} {{clearing}} away. Little curves of burning grass were working {{down along the}} rim. <b>He</b> <b>put</b> out <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> to grasp Lucy, remembering in a flash. He pointed to the ledge across the chasm.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Jenkins {{got to his}} feet, in a slow, foolish fashion. <b>He</b> <b>put</b> out <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> to stay his lordship. The lady, in the background, {{looked on}} with wide eyes, very breathless, one hand to her bosom as if to control its heave.|$|R
60|$|Bostil's eyes glistened. <b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> {{friendly}} <b>hand</b> on Cordts's shoulder, {{an action}} which showed {{the stress of}} the moment. Most of the men crowded around Bostil. Sears and Hutchinson hung close to Cordts. And Holley, keeping near his employer, had keen eyes for other things than horses.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will permit}} me to {{compliment}} you, my dear Mary," [...] said he, in a voice which was the most mellow and beautiful that I have ever heard. [...] "I {{can assure you that}} the country air has used you wondrous well, and that I should be proud to see my pretty sister in the Mall. I am your servant, sir," [...] he continued, holding out his hand to my father. [...] "It was but last week that I had the honour of dining with my friend, Lord St. Vincent, and I took occasion to mention you to him. I may tell you that your name is not forgotten at the Admiralty, sir, and I hope that I may see you soon walking the poop of a 74-gun ship of your own. So this is my nephew, is it?" [...] <b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> upon each of my shoulders in a very friendly way and looked me up and down.|$|E
60|$|The old knight said no word, but <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> {{on either}} shoulder, {{and kissed his}} squire, with the tears shining in his eyes. Alleyne sprang to the rope, and sliding swiftly down, soon found himself at its extremity. From above {{it seemed as though}} rope and cliff were well-nigh touching, but now, when {{swinging}} a hundred feet down, the squire found that he could scarce reach the face of the rock with his foot, and that it was as smooth as glass, with no resting-place where a mouse could stand. Some three feet lower, however, his eye lit upon a long jagged crack which slanted downwards, and this he must reach if he would save not only his own poor life, but that of the eight-score men above him. Yet it were madness to spring for that narrow slit with nought but the wet, smooth rock to cling to. He swung for a moment, full of thought, and even as he hung there another of the hellish stones sang through his curls, and struck a chip {{from the face of the}} cliff. Up he clambered a few feet, drew up the loose end after him, unslung his belt, held on with knee and with elbow while he spliced the long, tough leathern belt to the end of the cord: then lowering himself as far as he could go, he swung backwards and forwards until his hand reached the crack, when he left the rope and clung to the face of the cliff. Another stone struck him on the side, and he heard a sound like a breaking stick, with a keen stabbing pain which shot through his chest. Yet it was no time now to think of pain or ache. There was his lord and his eight-score comrades, and they must be plucked from the jaws of death. On he clambered, with his hand shuffling down the long sloping crack, sometimes bearing all his weight upon his arms, at others finding some small shelf or tuft on which to rest his foot. Would he never pass over that fifty feet? He dared not look down and could but grope slowly onwards, his face to the cliff, his fingers clutching, his feet scraping and feeling for a support. Every vein and crack and mottling of that face of rock remained forever stamped upon his memory. At last, however, his foot came upon a broad resting-place and he ventured to cast a glance downwards. Thank God! he had reached the highest of those fatal pinnacles upon which his comrade had fallen. Quickly now he sprang from rock to rock until his feet were on the ground, and he had his hand stretched out for the horse's rein, when a sling-stone struck him on the head, and he dropped senseless upon the ground.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well {{up in your}} studies?" [...] he asked, cordially. Then <b>he</b> seated himself, <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> on each knee, and {{deliberately}} and curiously studied Ken.|$|R
6000|$|... "Gawd Almighty!" [...] gasped Larry, and <b>he</b> <b>put</b> out <b>a</b> shaking <b>hand</b> {{to clutch}} Neale. [...] "The Injuns! I always feared this--spite of Slingerland's talk." ...|$|R
60|$|The calf stirred beneath him. <b>He</b> <b>put</b> out <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> {{to touch}} <b>a</b> warm, furry coat. The mother had fallen beside him. Lifting a heavy hoof, he laid {{it over the}} neck of the calf to serve as {{additional}} weight. He lay still and listened. The rumble of the herd died away in the distance.|$|R
60|$|He {{had been}} routing among the piled {{newspapers}} under the kitchen dresser, and had turned quite hopefully and taken the thing. <b>He</b> <b>put</b> it on. But it didn't feel right. Nothing felt right. <b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> trembling <b>hand</b> upon {{the crown of}} the thing and pressed it on his head, and tried it askew {{to the right and}} then askew to the left.|$|R
6000|$|His face caught {{something}} of my dismay. He {{stood up and}} stared about him at the scrub that fenced us in and rose about us, straining upward in a passion of growth. <b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> dubious <b>hand</b> to his lips. He spoke with a sudden lack of assurance. [...] "I think," [...] he said slowly, [...] "we left it ... somewhere ... about there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{glad that}} you are here," [...] the {{sufferer}} continued {{with a sigh of}} relief. From the brightened expression upon his pinched face, it seemed as if, even now in the jaws of death, he leaned upon his old schoolfellow and looked to him for assistance. <b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> wasted <b>hand</b> above the counterpane and laid it upon Girdlestone's.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>put</b> up <b>a</b> {{trembling}} <b>hand</b> {{and took}} from that shelf {{a piece of}} twisted paper, which he opened absently only to find it inscribed with a true lover's knot and, the words:-- ...|$|R
60|$|He {{repeated}} this, and as I {{was now in}} one of my subtle moods, I {{determined to}} dispute it. Possibly I wandered a little from the point. But Cavor certainly did not attend at all properly. He stood up as well as <b>he</b> could, <b>putting</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> on my head to steady himself, which was disrespectful, and stood staring about him, quite devoid now of any fear of the moon beings.|$|R
6000|$|The elder Chase {{appeared}} {{fascinated by}} something he either saw or felt in Belding, and his gray face grew grayer. <b>He</b> <b>put</b> up <b>a</b> shaking <b>hand.</b> Then Radford Chase, livid and snarling, burst out: [...] "I'll talk till I'm {{black in the}} face. You can't stop me!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lin!" [...] In {{that word}} {{there was the}} subtle, nameless charm of an {{intimacy}} she had never granted him until that moment. He seemed drawn as if by invisible wires. <b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> shaking <b>hand</b> on hers and crushed her gauntleted fingers. And Lucy, in the current now of her woman's need to be placated if not obeyed, pressed her small hand to his. How strange to what lengths a little submission to her feeling had carried her! Every spoken word, every movement, seemed to exact more from her. She did not know herself.|$|R
