A downtown district heating system was constructed in 1981 and extended in 1982. There was public opposition to the scheme. Many homes were heated by private geothermal wells, and owners were concerned that the city system could lower the water level and/or reduce water temperatures. System operation was delayed until 1984 following an aquifer study. Full operational testing showed no negative impact on the private wells. The system was shut down again in 1986 after multiple <b>distribution</b> <b>piping</b> failures were discovered. By 1991, the <b>distribution</b> <b>piping</b> had been reconstructed, and the system was again operating.

This study aims at understanding the main factors controlling spatial patterns of piping in loess-derived soils under a temperate climate. To map the spatial <b>distribution</b> of <b>piping</b> and identify the environmental controls on its distribution, a regional survey was carried out in a 236 km 2 study area in the Flemish Ardennes (Belgium). Orthophotos taken at optimal field conditions (winter) were analyzed to detect piping in open landscapes and ground thruthing was systematically done through field surveys. In total, 137 parcels having 560 collapsed pipes were mapped. Dimensions of the sinkholes and local slope gradient were measured in the field and topographical variables were derived from LiDAR data. Land use plays an important role as 97 % of the sites with piping are found under pasture. The probability of piping increases rapidly on hillslopes with gradients exceeding 8 % and with a concave profile and plan curvature, enhancing subsurface flow concentration. The zones with soil profiles on shallow loess over a relatively thin layer of homogeneous blue massive clays (Aalbeke Member) are most prone to piping. Soil characteristics are of less importance to explain piping occurrence. Furthermore, the topographical threshold line indicating the critical slope gradient for a given contributing drainage area was determined.

40|$|The Holden {{gas-fired}} furnace {{is used in}} the {{enriched uranium}} recovery process to dry and combust small batches of combustibles. The ash is further processed. The furnace operates by allowing a short natural gas flame to burn over the face of a wall of porous fire brick on two sides of the furnace. Each firing wall uses two main burners and a pilot burner to heat the porous fire brick to a luminous glow. Regulators and orifice valves are used to provide a minimum gas pressure of 4 in. water column at a rate of approximately 1, 450 scf/h to the burners. The gas flow rate was calculated by determining the gas flow appropriate for the instrumentation in the gas line. Observed flame length and vendor literature were used to calculate pilot burner gas consumption. Air for combustion, purging, and cooling is supplied by a single blower. Rough calculations of the air-flow <b>distribution</b> in <b>piping</b> entering the furnace show that air flow to the burners approximately agrees with the calculated natural gas flow. A simple on/off control loop is used to maintain a temperature of 1, 000 F in the furnace chamber.

Recommendations for safety improvements include installation of both a timed ignition system and a combustible-gas monitor near the furnace.

In order to estimate the spatial and temporal distribution of cooling loads; the climatic conditions of Hong Kong were investigated and a weather database {{in the form of a}} typical meteorological year (TMY) was developed.

By means of computational. experiments, it was demonstrated that there is a promising improvement to GA performance by including the Local Search/Looped Local Search algorithm, in terms of both solution quality and computational efficiency. The effects on the search performance of a number of parameters were systematically investigated to establish the most effective settings.

However, there is a significant gap between the funds available and the projected costs of infrastructure replacement or rehabilitation. Infrastructure Management Systems (IMS) have been developed to assist utilities and decision-makers in determining how to allocate resources for infrastructure. This project utilizes theTampa Water Department (TWD) as a case study to develop a tool for prioritizing infrastructure replacement. TWD is responsible for managing over 2, 240 miles of pipeline. Building booms in the 1920 s and 1950 s have inadvertently resulted in a significant need to replace or rehabilitate pipelines due to the aging of the overall water supply infrastructure. To address this problem, TWD is taking the first steps in applying IMS to transmission anddistribution pipelines. Currently, approximately 500 miles of water mains have been slated for replacement or rehabilitation. The TWD has a GIS that has been used to map and integrate information on main breaks, service line breaks, customer complaints and modeled water age. Information on fire hydrant spacing and line flushing dates are also integrated into the GIS. Following development of the GIS based infrastructure replacement prioritization system, approximately 3, 000 pipe segments were identified and queries were performed to help develop cost to benefit analyses. The results were used to develop a prioritized list of potential capital projects and incorporate the time value of money and event forecasting. The GIS was also used to develop indicators of the overall infrastructure condition.
