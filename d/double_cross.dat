40|$|For a {{matched pair}} of locally compact quantum groups, we {{construct}} the <b>double</b> <b>crossed</b> product as a locally compact quantum group. This construction generalizes Drinfeld’s quantum double construction. We study C ∗-algebraic properties of these <b>double</b> <b>crossed</b> products and several links between <b>double</b> <b>crossed</b> products and bicrossed products. In an appendix, we study the Radon-Nikodym derivative of a weight under a quantum group action, following Yamanouchi and obtain, as a corollary, a new characterization of closed quantum subgroups. ...|$|R

5|$|Through the Etherians, Voyager learns of {{an energy}} field being {{projected}} by a gigantic space station, the Forge, which is draining power and preventing repairs from being completed. To counteract {{the effects of}} the field, chief engineer B'Elanna Torres suggests the use of a rare substance called Isodesium, and the Hazard Team is sent on a stealth mission to the scavenger base to steal their supplies of Isodesium. However, the mission is a disaster: despite acquiring the Isodesium, one crewman is briefly captured and another team member is critically injured. As the team attempts to extract, Borg drones transport into the extraction point, killing another team member, capturing Lieutenant Foster and taking the Isodesium. In Foster's absence, Munro is made the team leader. Along with Seven of Nine, the team transports to the Borg cube to retrieve the Isodesium. While on the cube, Munro is given the chance to rescue Foster from assimilation by the Borg. Matters are complicated when the Borg corner the team, leveraging their freedom and the Isodesium for assistance against a number of Species 8472 on board, a race highly resistant to the Borg. Although successful, the Borg attempt to assimilate the team; anticipating a <b>double</b> <b>cross,</b> however, Munro has Chang detonate an explosive in a sensitive part of the cube and the team escapes with the Isodesium in the chaos.|$|E
25|$|The <b>double</b> <b>cross</b> symbol {{appeared}} {{again in}} rudimentary {{features on the}} first coins that Stephen I, the first king of the Kingdom of Hungary (part of which now forms the territory of present-day Slovakia), had minted at an unknown place. Before he became king in 1000, he was the Grand Prince of the Principality of Hungary and was living there with his Bavarian wife Gisella. The frequent opinion that the <b>double</b> <b>cross</b> was a cross that the Pope granted to Stephen I. around 1000 is still disputed. The opinion arose only in the 15th century based on a legend from the 12th century, which in addition only says that Stephen received an apostolic cross (i.e. a normal, not a <b>double</b> <b>cross).</b>|$|E

25|$|After the Mongol {{invasion}} in 1241-1242 {{many of the}} newly founded towns in the Kingdom of Hungary received {{the right to use}} the royal <b>double</b> <b>cross</b> as their coat of arms. The first, biggest and most towns of the kingdom arose in present-day Slovakia - the part of the kingdom that was characterized by German settlers, extensive mining activities and thus the most advanced economy at that time. It was probably partly due to this use in municipal coats of arm that the <b>double</b> <b>cross</b> became a clear symbol of {{the northern part of the}} kingdom again from the 15th century onwards and Upper Hungary from the 18th century.|$|E

Čisárik and Vrtel based their designs for a modern coat of arms and flag on an existing 14th Century coat of arms. However, Čisárik and Vrtel chose to enlarge the <b>double</b> <b>cross</b> three times to emphasize it as a national symbol. In addition to the national coat of arms and the national flag, the duo also designed a new presidential standard, which incorporates the <b>double</b> <b>cross</b> as well.|$|E

25|$|It {{was only}} 100 years later, around 1189, that the <b>double</b> <b>cross</b> {{is known to}} have been used again – it was used during a crusade of the Hungarian king Béla III as his royal symbol.

This time, the symbol was already used as a coat of arms, because coats of arms became fashionable in Europe at that time. He chose the symbol, because it was a Christian symbol and because it was the oldest symbol used in his kingdom.|$|E
