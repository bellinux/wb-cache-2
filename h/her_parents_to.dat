5|$|Living in Bendigo and {{studying}} at Camp Hill Primary School, Leech could only travel {{three times a}} year to train with Froelich, so she relied heavily on dry land simulations, such as a pulley attached to the kitchen door.

5|$|During {{a family}} {{vacation}} to New York when Lawrence was 14, she was spotted on the street by a talent scout who arranged for her to audition for agents. Lawrence's mother was not keen on allowing her to pursue an acting career, but briefly moved {{to the city to}} let her read for roles. After Lawrence's first cold reading, the agents said that hers was the best they had heard from someone that young; Lawrence's mother convinced her that they were lying. Lawrence said her early experiences were difficult as she felt lonely and friendless. She signed on with the CESD Talent Agency, who convinced <b>her</b> <b>parents</b> <b>to</b> let her audition for roles in Los Angeles. Lawrence's mother agreed to let her pursue acting on the condition that she graduate from high school. Lawrence was eventually home-schooled in Los Angeles, and graduated two years early with good grades.

Bored with practice, she gave up playing piano at that time. Hoping for more freedom, she urged <b>her</b> <b>parents</b> <b>to</b> send her to Geelong Grammar School, an independent boarding school attended by her siblings.

5|$|Alice's birth {{prompted}} <b>her</b> <b>parents</b> <b>to</b> find {{a larger}} family home. Buckingham Palace was not {{equipped with the}} private apartments that Victoria's growing family needed, including suitable nurseries. Therefore, in 1844, Victoria and Albert purchased Osborne House on the Isle of Wight as a family holiday home. Alice's education was devised by her father and his close friend, Baron Stockmar. At Osborne, Alice and her siblings were taught practical skills such as housekeeping, cooking, gardening and carpentry, as well as daily lessons in English, French and German. Victoria and Albert favoured a monarchy based on family values; Alice and her siblings, who wore middle class clothing on a daily basis, slept in sparsely furnished bedrooms with little heating. Alice was fascinated with the world outside the Royal Household; at Balmoral, where she seemed happiest, she visited the tenants living and working on the estate. On one occasion, she escaped from her governess at the chapel at Windsor Castle and sat in a public pew, so she could better understand {{people who were not}} strict adherents to royal protocol. In 1854, during the Crimean War, the eleven-year-old Alice toured London hospitals for wounded soldiers with her mother and her eldest sister. She was the most emotionally sensitive of her siblings and was sympathetic to other people's burdens, possessing a sharp tongue and an easily triggered temper. In her childhood, Alice formed a close relationship with her brother, the Prince of Wales, and her eldest sister, The Princess Royal. Victoria's marriage to Prince Frederick of Prussia in 1858 greatly upset her.|$|E
