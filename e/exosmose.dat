60|$|Aggregation {{is excited}} by {{almost all the}} stimulants which induce movement; such as the glands being touched two or three times, the {{pressure}} of minute inorganic particles, the absorption of various fluids, even long immersion in distilled water, <b>exosmose,</b> and heat. Of the many stimulants tried, carbonate of ammonia is the most energetic and acts the quickest: a dose of 1/134400 of a grain (.00048 mg.) given to a single gland suffices to cause in one hour well-marked aggregation in the upper cells of the tentacle. The process goes on {{only as long as}} the protoplasm is in a living, vigorous, and oxygenated condition.|$|E
60|$|The bending of the tentacles, when {{leaves are}} {{immersed}} in a dense fluid, and their subsequent re-expansion in a less dense fluid, show that the passage of fluid from or into the cells can cause movements like the natural ones. But the inflection thus caused is often irregular; the exterior tentacles being sometimes spirally curved. Other unnatural movements are likewise caused by the application of dense fluids, {{as in the case}} of drops of syrup placed on the backs of leaves and tentacles. Such movements may be compared with the contortions which many vegetable tissues undergo when subjected to <b>exosmose.</b> It is therefore doubtful whether they throw any light on the natural movements.|$|E
60|$|Some of {{the leaves}} which were not {{affected}} by the non-nitrogenous fluids were, as above stated, immediately afterwards tested with bits of meat, and were thus proved {{to be in an}} active condition. But in addition to these trials, twenty-three {{of the leaves}}, with drops of gum, syrup, or starch, still lying on their discs, which had produced no effect in the course of between 24 hrs. and 48 hrs., were then tested with drops of milk, urine, or albumen. Of the twenty-three leaves thus treated, seventeen had their tentacles, and in some cases their blades, well inflected; but their powers were somewhat impaired, for the rate of movement was decidedly slower than when fresh leaves were treated with these same nitrogenous fluids. This impairment, as well as the insensibility of six of the leaves, may be attributed to injury from <b>exosmose,</b> caused by the density of the fluids placed on their discs.|$|E
60|$|Lastly, bits of meat {{were placed}} on some glands; these were {{examined}} after 23 hrs., as were others, which had apparently not long before caught minute flies; {{but they did not}} present any [page 348] difference from the glands of other hairs. Perhaps there may not have been time enough for absorption. I think so as some glands, on which dead flies had evidently long lain, were of a pale dirty purple colour or even almost colourless, and the granular matter within them presented an unusual and somewhat peculiar appearance. That these glands had absorbed animal matter from the flies, probably by <b>exosmose</b> into the viscid secretion, we may infer, not only from their changed colour, but because, when placed in a solution of carbonate of ammonia, some of the cells in their pedicels become filled with granular matter; whereas the cells of other hairs, which had not caught flies, after being treated with the same solution for the same length of time, contained only a small quantity of granular matter. But more evidence is necessary before we fully admit that the glands of this saxifrage can absorb, even with ample time allowed, animal matter from the minute insects which they occasionally and accidentally capture.|$|E
60|$|The {{secretion}} {{from the}} glands is extremely viscid, {{so that it}} can be drawn out into long threads. It appears colourless, but stains little balls of paper pale pink. An object of any kind placed on a gland always causes it, as I believe, to secrete more freely; but the mere presence of the object renders this difficult to ascertain. In some cases, however, the effect was strongly marked, as when particles of sugar were added; but the result in this case is probably due merely to <b>exosmose.</b> Particles of carbonate and phosphate of ammonia and of some other salts, for instance sulphate of zinc, likewise increase the secretion. Immersion in a solution of one part of chloride of gold, or of some other salts, to 437 of water, excites the glands to largely increased secretion; on the other hand, tartrate of antimony produces no such effect. Immersion in many acids (of the strength of one part to 437 of water) likewise causes a wonderful amount of [page 14] secretion, so that when the leaves are lifted out, long ropes of extremely viscid fluid hang from them. Some acids, on the other hand, do not act in this manner. Increased secretion is not necessarily dependent on the inflection of the tentacle, for particles of sugar and of sulphate of zinc cause no movement.|$|E
6000|$|Although {{drops of}} water and of a {{moderately}} strong solution of sugar, falling on the filaments, does not excite them, yet the immersion of a leaf in pure water sometimes caused the lobes to close. One leaf was left immersed for 1 hr. 10 m., and three other leaves for some minutes, in water at temperatures varying between 59o and 65o (15o to 18o.3 Cent.) without any effect. One, however, of these four leaves, on being gently withdrawn from the water, closed rather quickly. The three other leaves were proved {{to be in good}} condition, as they closed when their filaments were touched. Nevertheless two fresh leaves on being dipped into water at 75o and 62 1/2o (23o.8 and 16o.9 Cent.) instantly closed. These were then placed with their footstalks in water, and after 23 hrs. partially re-expanded; on touching their filaments one of them closed. This latter leaf after an additional 24 hrs. again re-expanded, and now, on the filaments of both leaves being touched, both closed. We thus see that a short immersion in water does not at all injure the leaves, but sometimes excites the lobes to close. The movement in the above cases was evidently not caused by the temperature of the water. It has been shown that long immersion causes the purple fluid within the cells of the sensitive filaments to become aggregated; and the tentacles of Drosera are acted on in the same manner by long immersion, often being somewhat inflected. In both cases the result is probably due to a slight degree of <b>exosmose.</b> [page 293] ...|$|E
60|$|I am {{confirmed}} in this belief by {{the effects of}} immersing a leaf of Dionaea in a moderately strong solution of sugar; the leaf having been previously left for 1 hr. 10 m. in water without any effect; for now the lobes closed rather quickly, {{the tips of the}} marginal spikes crossing in 2 m. 30 s., and the leaf being completely shut in 3 m. Three leaves were then immersed in a solution of half an ounce of sugar to a fluid ounce of water, and all three leaves closed quickly. As I was doubtful whether this was due to the cells on the upper surface of the lobes, or to the sensitive filaments, being acted on by <b>exosmose,</b> one leaf was first tried by pouring a little of the same solution in the furrow between the lobes over the midrib, which is the chief seat of movement. It was left there for some time, but no movement ensued. The whole upper surface of leaf was then painted (except close round the bases of the sensitive filaments, which I could not do without risk of touching them) with the same solution, but no effect was produced. So that the cells on the upper surface are not thus affected. But when, after many trials, I succeeded in getting a drop of the solution to cling to one of the filaments, the leaf quickly closed. Hence we may, I think, conclude that the solution causes fluid to pass out of the delicate cells of the filaments by exosmose; and that this sets up some molecular change in their contents, analogous to that which must be produced by a touch.|$|E
6000|$|It is a {{far more}} {{remarkable}} problem how the members of this family, and Pinguicula, and, as Dr. Hooker has recently shown, Nepenthes, could all have acquired the power of secreting a fluid which dissolves or digests animal matter. The six genera of the Droseraceae very probably inherited this power from a common progenitor, but this cannot apply to [page 362] Pinguicula or Nepenthes, for these plants are not at all closely related to the Droceraceae. But the difficulty is not nearly so great as it at first appears. Firstly, the juices of many plants contain an acid, and, apparently, any acid serves for digestion. Secondly, as Dr. Hooker has remarked in relation to the present subject in his address at Belfast (1874), and as Sachs repeatedly insists,* the embryos of some plants secrete a fluid which dissolves albuminous substances out of the endosperm; although the endosperm is not actually united with, only in contact with, the embryo. All plants, moreover, have the power of dissolving albuminous or proteid substances, such as protoplasm, chlorophyll, gluten, aleurone, and of carrying them from one part to other parts of their tissues. This must be effected by a solvent, probably consisting of a ferment together with an acid. Now, in the case of plants which are able to absorb already soluble matter from captured insects, though not capable of true digestion, the solvent just referred to, which must be occasionally present in the glands, would be apt to exude from the glands together with the viscid secretion, inasmuch as endosmose is accompanied by <b>exosmose.</b> If such exudation did ever occur, the solvent would act on the animal matter contained within the captured insects, and this would be an act of true digestion. As it cannot be doubted that this process would be of high service to plants ...|$|E
60|$|Mirabilis longiflora.--The {{stems and}} both {{surfaces}} of the leaves bear viscid hairs. young plants, from 12 to 18 inches in height in my greenhouse, caught so many minute Diptera, Coleoptera, and larvae, that they were quite dusted with them. The hairs are short, of unequal lengths, formed of a single row of cells, surmounted by an enlarged cell which secretes viscid matter. These terminal cells or glands contain granules and often globules of granular matter. Within a gland which had caught a small insect, one such mass was observed to undergo incessant changes of form, with the occasional appearance of vacuoles. But I {{do not believe that}} this protoplasm had been generated by matter absorbed from the dead insect; for, on comparing several glands which had and had not caught insects, not a shade of difference could be perceived between them, and they all contained fine granular matter. A piece of leaf was immersed for 24 hrs. in a solution of one part of carbonate of ammonia to 218 of water, but the hairs seemed very little affected by it, excepting that perhaps the glands were rendered rather more opaque. In the leaf itself, however, the grains of chlorophyll near the cut surfaces had run together, or become aggregated. Nor were the glands on another leaf, after an immersion for 24 hrs. in an infusion of raw meat, in the least affected; but the protoplasm lining the cells of the pedicels had shrunk greatly from the walls. This latter effect may have been due to <b>exosmose,</b> as the infusion was strong. We may, therefore, conclude that the glands of this plant either have no power of absorption or that the protoplasm which they contain is not acted on by a solution of carbonate of ammonia (and this seems scarcely credible) or by an infusion of meat.|$|E
60|$|Opposed to this view, that {{aggregation}} {{is caused}} by the outward passage of fluid from the cells, are the following facts. There seems no close relation between the degree of increased secretion and that of aggregation. Thus a particle of sugar added to the secretion round a gland causes a much greater increase of secretion, and much less aggregation, than does a particle of carbonate of ammonia given in the same manner. It does not appear probable that pure water would cause much <b>exosmose,</b> and yet aggregation often follows from an immersion in water of between 16 hrs. and 24 hrs., and always after from 24 hrs. to 48 hrs. Still less probable is it that water at a temperature of from 125o to 130o Fahr. (51o.6 to 54o.4 Cent.) should cause fluid to pass, not only from the glands, but from all the cells of the tentacles down to their bases, so quickly that aggregation is induced within 2 m. or 3 m. Another strong argument against this view is, that, after complete aggregation, the spheres and oval masses of protoplasm float about in an abundant supply of thin colourless fluid; so that at least the latter stages of the process cannot be due to the want of fluid to hold the protoplasm in solution. There is still stronger evidence that aggregation is independent of secretion; for the papillae, described in the first chapter, with which the [page 57] leaves are studded are not glandular, and do not secrete, yet they rapidly absorb carbonate of ammonia or an infusion of raw meat, and their contents then quickly undergo aggregation, which afterwards spreads into the cells of the surrounding tissues. We shall hereafter see that the purple fluid within the sensitive filaments of Dionaea, which do not secrete, likewise undergoes aggregation from the action of a weak solution of carbonate of ammonia.|$|E
6000|$|... (19) Six small {{particles}} of dry starch of commerce {{were placed on}} a leaf, and one of these caused some secretion in 1 hr. 15 m., and the others in from 8 hrs. to 9 hrs. The glands which had thus been excited to secrete soon became dry, and did not begin to secrete again until the sixth day. A larger bit of starch was then placed on a leaf, and no secretion was excited in 5 hrs. 30 m.; but after 8 hrs. there was a considerable supply, which increased so much in 24 hrs. as to run down the leaf to the distance of 3/4 of an inch. This secretion, though so abundant, {{was not in the}} least acid. As it was so copiously excited, and as seeds not rarely adhere to the leaves of naturally growing plants, {{it occurred to me that}} the glands might perhaps have the power of secreting a ferment, like ptyaline, capable of dissolving starch; so I carefully observed the above six {{small particles}} during several days, but they did not seem in the least reduced in bulk. A particle was also left for two days in a little pool of secretion, which had run down from a piece of spinach leaf; but although the particle was so minute no diminution was perceptible. We may therefore conclude that the secretion cannot dissolve starch. The increase caused by this substance may, I presume, be attributed to <b>exosmose.</b> But I am surprised that starch acted so quickly and powerfully as it did, though in a less degree than sugar. Colloids are known to possess some slight power of dialysis; and on placing the leaves of a Primula in water, and others in syrup and diffused starch, those in the starch became flaccid, but to a less degree and at a much slower rate than the leaves in the syrup; those in water remaining all the time crisp.] ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{length of}} time during which the tentacles remain inflected largely depends on the {{quantity}} of the substance given, partly on the facility with which it is penetrated or acted on by the secretion, and partly on its essential nature. The tentacles always remain inflected much longer over large bits or large drops than over small bits or drops. Texture probably plays a part in determining the extraordinary {{length of time}} during which the tentacles remain inflected [page 133] over the hard grains of chemically prepared casein. But the tentacles remain inflected for an equally long time over finely powdered, precipitated phosphate of lime; phosphorus in this latter case evidently being the attraction, and animal matter {{in the case of}} casein. The leaves remain long inflected over insects, but it is doubtful how far {{this is due to the}} protection afforded by their chitinous integuments; for animal matter is soon extracted from insects (probably by <b>exosmose</b> from their bodies into the dense surrounding secretion), as shown by the prompt inflection of the leaves. We see the influence of the nature of different substances in bits of meat, albumen, and fresh gluten acting very differently from equal-sized bits of gelatine, areolar tissue, and the fibrous basis of bone. The former cause not only far more prompt and energetic, but more prolonged, inflection than do the latter. Hence we are, I think, justified in believing that gelatine, areolar tissue, and the fibrous basis of bone, would be far less nutritious to Drosera than such substances as insects, meat, albumen, &c. This is an interesting conclusion, as it is known that gelatine affords but little nutriment to animals; and so, probably, would areolar tissue and the fibrous basis of bone. The chondrin which I used acted more powerfully than gelatine, but then I do not know that it was pure. It is a more remarkable fact that fibrin, which belongs to the great class of Proteids,* including albumen in one of its sub-groups, does not excite the tentacles in a greater degree, or keep them inflected for a longer time, than does gelatine, or ...|$|E
40|$|In {{breeding}} apples for {{a region}} where winter hardiness is an important consideration, the desirability of having some rapid and reliable means of separating the few winter hardy seedlings produced from the great number of less hardy ones is obvious. Any elimination {{that can be made}} in the first year or two of seedling growth is economical from the standpoint of both time and cost. From previous investigations, it is apparent that many factors are involved in working with the electro-conductivity method as a measurement of winter hardiness. Several of these factors are discussed in this paper. Studies were begun in the spring of 1949 and carried through the fall of the same year. The material used throughout this investigation consisted of shoots from 16 standard horticultural varieties of apples. All of the material used in the experiment were obtained from the University of Nebraska fruit farm at Union, Nebraska. The varieties were grouped as follows starting with the variety showing the least amount of resistance to cold and ending with the variety of greatest resistance:Cortland, Grimes Golden, Joan, Golden Delicious, Sharon, Secor, Winesap, Hawkeye, Wealthy, Haralson, Jonathan, Beacon, Red Duchess, Virginia Crab, and Hibernal. Two year old shoots were found to have nearly twice as much resistance to a temperature of 15 ° F. as the one-year old shoots had. It was found that waxing the cut ends of a sample reduced the electrolyte loss to almost 50 percent less than that of a sample with unwaxed ends. There was a greater spread in specific conductance readings between varieties when the ends of each piece were waxed. Very little difference was found between varieties when shoots were allowed to <b>exosmose</b> without being frozen. The rapidity with which the estimation of injury can be accomplished and the convenience of the precise numerical values obtained by electrical conductance makes the application of this method very valuable in studying winter hardiness of plants.
