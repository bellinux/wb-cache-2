6000|$|... "And Rollo and I," [...] said he, [...] "think {{of going}} up. If {{you would like}} to go, we should be very <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> join our party." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{imagine they}} would," [...] said Beaton. [...] "I think they'd be only too <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> come. But you wouldn't {{know what to}} do with each other, indeed, Miss Vance." ...|$|E
60|$|Bel. I am {{infinitely}} <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> met <b>you</b> with Donna Aurelia, {{that you}} may do me the favour to satisfy this lady of a truth, which I can scarce persuade her to believe.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind, my dear Brother," [...] said Shaggy consolingly; [...] "I am very <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> found <b>you</b> again, {{although}} I {{may never}} see your face. So let us {{make the most}} of this joyful reunion." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} glad to see it, though I am not sure I shall go in immediately. I must reconnoitre a little first. That makes me so very <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> met <b>you.</b> I think it's very wonderful--your knowing me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no, I am not," [...] said she, as {{she went}} on {{continually}} filling his cup; [...] "but I am so <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> home again. You have been away so much lately." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps not," [...] replied Harry, [...] "but {{it seems}} very {{contradictory}} to me; and yet it's an evident fact, for I'm very sorry to leave them, and I'm very <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> for my companion here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Will you? Oh! will you? We {{are going}} to have some at Christmas, with a nice part for me. A simple little thing, but I can do it, and should be so proud, so <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> there.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll 'splain ever'thing {{as soon as}} we get to your rooms," [...] promised Dorothy. [...] "You're {{in great}} luck, Uncle Henry and Aunt Em; an' so am I! And oh! I'm so <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> got <b>you</b> here, at last!" ...|$|R
60|$|WALPOLE. I'm coming. [To B. B.] Theres {{nothing in}} your point: {{phagocytosis}} is pure rot: {{the cases are}} all blood-poisoning; and the knife is the real remedy. Bye-bye, Sir Paddy. <b>Happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> met <b>you,</b> Mr. Blenkinsop. Now, Emmy. [He goes out, followed by Emmy].|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{very sorry}} you are going, Mr. Gilmore," [...] she said, {{looking at me}} kindly. [...] "It is like the <b>happy</b> old times <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> here.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am very <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> back, Robert," [...] replied Mr. Worthington, {{and it was}} true. It {{would have}} been strange indeed if some tremor of {{sentiment}} {{had not been in}} his voice and some gleam of pride in his eye as he looked upon his son.|$|E
6000|$|MRS. ROBERTS: 'Oh yes, do go, Edward! Not {{but what}} I {{should be proud}} and <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> appear just as you are before the whole world, {{if it was only}} to put Willis down with his jokes about your absent-mindedness, and his boasts about those California desperadoes of his.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} you, Mr. Ledsam," [...] he said, [...] "why I am so <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> here this evening. In the first place, I desire to tender you once more my {{thanks for your}} very {{brilliant}} efforts on my behalf. The very fact that I am able to offer you hospitality at all is without a doubt due to these." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{young lady}} is your friend? Miss Sharp, I am very <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> see <b>you.</b> <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> and Emmy been quarrelling already with Joseph, {{that he wants}} to be off?" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{acknowledgment}} {{of which is}} a fair occasion offered me, to retire from the consideration of your lordship to that of myself. I here present you, my lord, with that in print, which <b>you</b> <b>had</b> the goodness not to dislike upon the stage; and account it <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> met <b>you</b> here in England; it being, at best, like small wines, to be drunk out upon the place, and has not body enough to endure the sea.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Whom {{would they}} like <b>to</b> <b>have</b> asked <b>to</b> the wedding?' the lady inquired, herself naming the Langs and Burfords. 'Of course,' she added, smiling, 'Freda and Alice {{will be only}} too <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> be bridesmaids. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> any one whom you would wish to ask? Your old {{scholars}} perhaps.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is not a}} {{question}} of degradation, but of prudence;--of the ordinary caution which I, as a mother, am bound to use as regards my daughter. Oh, Mr. Fitzgerald!" [...] and she now altered her tone as she spoke to him; [...] "we have all been so pleased to know you, so <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> there; why have you destroyed all this by one half-hour's folly?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{know that}} I love you. I think, surely, that never love was {{stronger}} than mine. If you can love me say but the one word, and you will make me absolutely <b>happy.</b> <b>To</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> for my wife is all that the world can give me now. Why {{do you go from}} me? Is it to tell me that you cannot love me, Marion? Do not say that, or I think my heart will break." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We shall {{take it up}} strong," [...] {{said the}} gentleman, [...] "and we shall be <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> among us. You'll find, Mr. Finn, that in public life there's nothing like having a horgan to back you. What is the most {{you can do in}} the 'Ouse? Nothing, if you're not reported. You're {{speaking}} to the country;--ain't you? And you can't do that without a horgan, Mr. Finn. You come among us on the Banner, Mr. Finn. You can't do better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am happy}} indeed, Lady Margaret," [...] he said {{approaching}} the litter, [...] "to <b>have</b> been able <b>to</b> save {{you from the}} power of these villains. Fortunately, word came {{to me that the}} outlaws in the forest were about to carry you off, and that they would not hesitate even to desecrate the walls of the convent. Assembling my men-at-arms, I at once rode to your rescue, and am doubly <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> saved <b>you,</b> first, as a gentleman, secondly, as being the man to whom our gracious prince <b>has</b> assigned <b>you</b> as a wife. I am Sir Rudolph, Earl of Evesham." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear fellow, {{you must}} trust me implicitly and {{do exactly what}} I tell you. You can tell your friends that we should <b>have</b> been <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> come with <b>you,</b> but that urgent {{business}} required us to be in town. We hope very soon to return to Devonshire. Will you remember to give them that message?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{have met}} at {{last in a}} {{singular}} way," [...] he heard Mr. Bentley going on, [...] "in a way that has brushed aside the conventions, in a way--I am <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> say--that <b>has</b> enabled <b>you</b> <b>to</b> give me your confidence. And I am an old man,--that has made it easier. I saw this afternoon, Mr. Hodder, that you were troubled, although you tried to hide it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O uncle! I'm so glad! and so sorry! Why didn't you let us {{know what}} time you'd be here, or call out the minute you came? Haven't I been home-sick for you? and now I'm so <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> back I could hug your dear old curly head off," [...] cried Rose, as the Encyclopedia went down with a bang, and she up with a spring that carried her into Dr. Alec's arms, to be kept there in the sort of embrace a man gives to the dearest {{creature}} the world holds for him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. March, I bow to {{the superiority}} of the Boston mind," [...] said the Colonel, while his females civilly protested and consented; [...] "and I might almost hail you as our preserver. If ever you come to Milwaukee,--which is the centre of the world, as Boston is,--we--I--shall be <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> call at my place of business.--I didn't commit myself, did I, Fanny?--I am {{sometimes}} hospitable to excess, Mrs. March," [...] he said, to explain his aside. [...] "And now, let us reconnoitre. Lead on, madam, and the gratitude of the houseless stranger will follow you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes, yes, yes," [...] {{said her}} husband, {{scrambling}} to his feet, and coming round to greet Annie. He {{was a small}} man, very bald, with a serious and wrinkled forehead, and rather austere brows; but his mouth had a furtive curl at one corner, which, with the habit he had of touching it there {{with the tip of}} his tongue, made Annie think of a cat that had been at the cream. [...] "I've been hoping to call with Mrs. Wilmington to pay my respects; but I've been away a great deal this season, and--and--We're all very <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> home again, Miss Kilburn. I've often heard my wife speak of your old days together at Hatboro'." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss Thorne," [...] said he, pulling {{himself up}} at the gate, [...] "if I had known that I was to be so {{extremely}} <b>happy</b> as <b>to</b> <b>have</b> found <b>you</b> here, I would <b>have</b> brought <b>you</b> down the most beautiful creature, an Arab. She belongs to my friend Jenkins; but I wouldn't have stood at any price in getting her for you. By Jove! {{if you were on}} that mare, I'd back you, for style and appearance, against anything in Hyde Park." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Bathurst, you did {{not think}} of your life. I don't think any of us stopped to think of anything; but, {{constituted}} as you are, the impulse must have been overpowering. It is nonsense your taking this matter to heart. Why, man, if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> stopped, <b>you</b> would <b>have</b> been murdered when the boat touched the shore, and {{do you think it would}} <b>have</b> made her <b>happier</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> seen <b>you</b> killed before her eyes? If <b>you</b> <b>had</b> swam ashore with her, the chances are she would have been killed by that volley of grape, for I saw eight or ten bodies lying on the sands, and you yourself were, you say, hit. You acted upon impulse, I grant, but it was upon a wise impulse. You did the very best thing that could have been done, and your doing so made it possible that Isobel Hannay should be rescued from what would otherwise have been certain death." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The disturbance, I am <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> inform <b>you,</b> <b>has</b> been {{completely}} quelled, and the ringleader taken into custody. She had a pail {{of cold water}} thrown over her, previous to being locked up, and expresses great contrition and uneasiness. We are all in a fever of anticipation about to-morrow; but, {{now that we are}} within a few hours of the meeting of the association, and at last enjoy the proud consciousness of having its illustrious members amongst us, I trust and hope everything may go off peaceably. I shall send you a full report of to-morrow's proceedings by the night coach.' ...|$|R
60|$|Second. Religious Exercise on Saturday afternoon. In {{order to}} bring up more {{distinctly}} and systematically the subject of religious duty, I established a long time ago, a religious meeting on Saturday afternoon. It is intended for those who feel interested in receiving such instruction, and who can conveniently attend at that time. If you have not other engagements, and if your parents approve of it, I should be <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> attend. There will be very little to interest you except the subject itself, for I make all the instructions which I give there as plain, direct, and practical as is in my power. A considerable number of the scholars usually attend, and frequently bring with them many of their female friends. You can at any time invite any one whom you please, {{to come to the}} meeting. It commences at half past three and continues about half an hour.|$|E
6000|$|Our hero {{had a bad}} {{half hour}} of it, though many words were said which must have gratified him much. They all wanted to keep him,--so Lord Cantrip declared, [...] "except one or two whom I could name, and who are {{particularly}} anxious to wear his shoes," [...] said Barrington, thinking that certain reminiscences of Phineas with regard to Mr. Bonteen and others might operate as strongly as any other consideration to make him love his place. Lord Brentford declared {{that he could not}} understand it,--that he should find himself lost in amazement if such a man as his young friend allowed himself to be led into the outer wilderness by such an ignis-fatuus of light as this. Lord Cantrip laid down the unwritten traditional law of Government officials very plainly. A man in office,--in an office which really imposed upon him as much work as he could possibly do with credit to himself or his cause,--was dispensed from the necessity of a conscience with reference to other matters. It was for Sir Walter Morrison to have a conscience about Irish tenant-right, as no doubt he had,--just as Phineas Finn had a conscience about Canada, and Jamaica, and the Cape. Barrington Erle was very strong about parties in general, and painted the comforts of official position in glowing colours. But I think that the two ladies were more efficacious than even their male relatives in the arguments which they used. [...] "We have been so <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> among us," [...] said Lady Cantrip, looking at him with beseeching, almost loving eyes. [...] "Mr. Finn knows," [...] said Lady Laura, [...] "that since he first came into Parliament I have always believed in his success, and I have been very proud to see it." [...] "We shall weep over him, as over a fallen angel, if he leaves us," [...] said Lady Cantrip. [...] "I won't say that I will weep," [...] said Lady Laura, [...] "but I do not know anything of the kind that would so truly make me unhappy." ...|$|E

You certainly surprised many people, finally allowing your creativity to shine, and your lack of focus to diminish. You succeeded where many thought you might fail. My best wishes to your patient family; they will be <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> home. I hope to see and hear from you in the future." ...|$|E
