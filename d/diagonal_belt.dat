Furthermore, in spite of the results of this investigation which show some disadvantageous effects of <b>diagonal</b> <b>belts</b> (as compared to lap belts and three-point belts), involving a higher injury risk, which leads to the conclusion that general use of this type should not be favoured, a complete comdemnation of <b>diagonal</b> <b>belts</b> seems exaggerated. The effectiveness percentages of both lap belts and three-point belts show independently very high values. It is justifiable to draw the conclusion that both lap belts and three-point belts are highly effective measures for safety in traffic. There is also a dutch version of this report...|$|R

40|$|The FRP sheet {{has been}} applied in many fields of civil {{engineering}} structures. The study on the application has been spread out involving of precast concrete structures, such as the application on the connection of beam and column of precast concrete structures. Since {{the strength of the}} CFRP sheet is depend on the bonding capacity, it is necessary to apply a vertical U-wrap belt on the main sheet to increase its bonding strength. However, it was reported that the vertical U-wrap belt may cause a prematurely rupture on the fibers of main CFRP sheet. Therefor, the <b>diagonal</b> U-wrap <b>belt</b> was considered to avoid premature rupture. This paper presents the effect of the <b>diagonal</b> U-wrap <b>belt</b> on the moment capacity of the connection system using CFRP sheet on the beam-column join of precast concrete. A series of specimens with parameter of CFRP sheet belts patterns was prepared. The specimens were subjected by one point load on the beam to create a moment at the connection.

40|$|Some {{researches}} {{have shown}} that critical phenomena {{on the use of}} FRP sheets as external reinforcement is debounding between the FRP sheet and concrete. This research was done to investigate the effect of Diagonal GFRP belt on failure behavior and flexural strength of reinforced concrete beam with additional 1 layer of GFRP sheet. The test was done on reinforced concrete beam specimens with dimension of 150 x 200 x 2500 mm on 2 simple support and were loaded using 2 point concentrated loads at 975. 5 mm from the supports. Specimens were made in 4 group, without the addition of layers of GFRP beams, beams with the addition of one layer of GFRP without the belt and with the addition of 1 layer of GFRP beams with Diagonal GFRP belt. Each group consists of 2 specimens. The data observed during the test are cracking loads, crack patterns, crack widths, ultimate load capacities, deflections and failure modes. The results showed that with the addition of GFRP <b>Diagonal</b> <b>belt</b> can change the mode of failure of the release of the bond between GFRP and concrete for beams with the addition of one layer of GFRP without belts to break GFRP sheets to the beams with Diagonal GFRP belt. Use of GFRP <b>Diagonal</b> <b>belt</b> can also improve the bending strength of reinforced concrete beams.

40|$|Fatalities {{caused by}} car {{accidents}} accounted for 1. 2 million worldwide in 2004. Chest injuries are the second death cause, after head injuries, in vehicle accidents. Devices to predict {{risk of injury}} are fundamental to develop and evaluate restraint systems that can mitigate the injury severity and reduce the fatalities. This can be achieved with mathematical Human Body Models (HBM). An HBM needs to be biofidelic, {{both in terms of}} size and biomechanical response. Herein, the biofidelity of the thorax region in an HBM is evaluated. The evaluation focuses on whole body kinematics and chest response during frontal car accidents. Finite element simulations with an HBM were performed with the code LS-DYNA [1]. A modified version of Total HUman Model for Safety v 3. 0 (THUMS) [2] has been the basis for the work presented here. THUMS was modified to improve its robustness and numerical stability. The meshes of the rib cage, skin around the ribcage, and intercostal muscles were refined. THUMS represents a 50 th percentile male and has approximately 150, 000 elements. It was compared with cadaver pendulum impacts [3], table top tests [4], and sled tests [5]. The pendulum test consist of a cylinder with diameter 125 mm, mass of 23. 4 kg and an initial speed of 4. 3 m/s impacting on the middle of the sternum. The table top tests included four loading conditions of the chest: hub, <b>diagonal</b> <b>belt,</b> double <b>diagonal</b> <b>belt,</b> and distributed load. The sled test was performed at 40 km/h, using a three point standard seat belt. The model has been compared to cadaver experiments on different load cases, which are representative of modern automotive restraint systems. In general, THUMS showed a good agreement with the experimental corridors for the pendulum and table top tests. The chest response in the sled test differed for the lower chest, possibly due to the absence of biofidelic fracture simulations in the THUMS. After comparing the kinematic and dynamic responses of THUMS with cadaver experiments it was concluded that the model is adequate to simulate the human response under frontal impacts. The next step is to identify parameters that can predict the risk of rib fracture and then become a tool to evaluate new restraint systems...|$|E

40|$|This study quantifies the {{effectiveness}} of current European car driver restraint systems in frontal crashes, notably steering wheel mounted airbags and seat belts (some pretensioned) compared to the previous generation of vehicles fitted with standard lap and <b>diagonal</b> seat <b>belts</b> alone.

40|$|Many forest-dwelling bats are {{purported to}} be {{widespread}} in South America, although records are scant from the vast <b>diagonal</b> <b>belt</b> of dry ecosystems that straddles the continent, implying possible sampling deficiencies. Here, we investigate this possibility {{in the case of}} four species of bat (Centronycteris maximiliani, Lampronycteris brachyotis, Peropteryx kappleri and Trinycteris nicefori), evaluating whether their disjunct present-day distributions reflect their true zoogeographic characteristics or the subsampling of intermediate zones. We use environmental niche modelling (ENM) in an ensemble approach, combining four different modeling techniques, and using niche descriptors based on climatic and remote sensing data, to estimate the potential distribution of the four species. The models indicate that all four species have disjunct distributions in the Amazon and Atlantic forest biomes. The one possible exception is P. kappleri, which the models indicated might potentially occur in humid forest enclaves in western Brazil and eastern Bolivia. The present-day distribution of the species may date back to the Plio-Pleistocene, when the forested biomes of South America were more extensive and connected. Further studies of different chiropteran lineages may provide additional insights into the historic processes of faunal interchange between the Amazon and Atlantic forest biomes...|$|E
40|$|Athletic pelvic / groin {{injuries}} can {{be difficult}} to define, diagnose and therefore manage. These injuries are often the result of multifactorial dysfunction, making them susceptible to becoming chronic. Transverse pelvic belts have shown effectiveness in reducing pain and improving function in athletes with pelvic / groin pain, but there may be better alternatives. Exploring different pelvic belt configurations with athletes with pelvic / groin pain confirmed the role of a transverse belt but also found that <b>diagonal</b> <b>belts</b> produced significantly (< 0. 05) greater effects upon clinical measures of pain and function. Dynamic elastomeric fabric orthoses (DEFOs) are Lycra®-based orthoses theorised as providing stability and enhancing proprioception. A DEFO was designed to apply diagonal force to the pelvic girdle and mimic transverse belt application. In a series of single case studies the DEFO was found to have beneficial effects upon pain and / or function in selected athletes with pelvic / groin pain. Athletes’ subjective reports suggested that balance and power may have also been positively influenced. Further work exploring appropriate measures of athletic balance led to the investigation of the intra-rater reliability of a functional measure; the multiple single-leg hop-stabilisation test. Good to excellent reliability (ICC = 0. 85; CI 0. 61 - 0. 90) confirmed this measure as being reliable for use in a future study, and highlighted relationships with other factors such as age and training status. The findings of a pilot RCT indicated that with minor revisions this protocol could be effectively implemented in informing a future RCT. Findings also indicated that the DEFO led to moderate to large effect sizes on clinical measures (d = 0. 6 - 1. 1) of active straight leg raise and squeeze test force, and negligible to small effects on measures of power and functional balance (d = 0. 1 - 0. 3). This thesis therefore outlines the development and initial evaluation of a novel DEFO for supporting the management of athletic pelvic / groin injury. Further work is required to undertake a fully powered RCT, and to explore the mechanistic action of this DEFO. DM Orthotics Lt...|$|R
40|$|This study {{compares the}} {{thoracic}} deformation {{response of the}} 50 th percentile male THOR NT frontal crash dummy and {{the response of the}} THOR modified with the SD- 1 shoulder (THOR SD- 1) relative to the thoracic response of eight 50 th percentile male PMHS. The prototype Chalmers University SD- 1 shoulder was designed to be more human-like in terms of geometry and range of motion in comparison to the standard THOR NT shoulder. The dummies and PMHS were restrained by a three-point restraint in a driver-side configuration and were subjected to a simulated 40 km/h frontal crash. The most prominent difference between the responses of the dummies and PMHS involved motion of the lower right anterior ribcage measurement site that is the farthest lateral distance from the <b>diagonal</b> shoulder <b>belt.</b> During the impact event, this site moved substantially anteriorly and away from the spine for the PMHS. The PMHS lower right “bulge out” behavior is believed to be caused by inertial loading of the ribcage, underlying organs, and soft tissue overlying the torso. The THOR SD- 1 shoulder altered the shoulder belt position relative to the thoracic deflection measurement sites resulting in a different distribution of deformation for the upper measurement sites although the average upper site deformation was similar to that recorded for the standard THOR shoulder...|$|R

40|$|For {{assessment}} of their performance and {{for the development of}} injury risk functions {{there is a need for}} additional biofidelity data. In this report two types of data are made available: Part A - post mortem human subject exposed to various restraints; Part B – volunteer shoulder rang-of-motions. Part A LAB- 2002 : Load-limiting belt restraints have been present in cars since 1995. An accident study showed the greater effectiveness in thorax injury prevention using a 4 kN load limiter belt with an airbag than using a 6 kN load limiter belt without airbag. Frontal sled crashes were performed using PMHS. Restraint conditions evaluated are 6 kN load-limiting belt and 4 kN load-limiting belt with an airbag. Loads between the occupant and the sled environment were recorded. Various measurements characterize the PMHS behaviour and injuries were noted. LAB- 2005 : Many studies have reported multiple rib fractures sustained by an Out-of-Position (OOP) driver subjected to a frontal airbag deployment. Two successive phases occur during the bag deployment: punch-out loading of the thorax, followed by a membrane effect. The aim of this study was to investigate the thoracic injuries generated by each phase separately. Tests of nine post-mortem human surrogates were carried out on a static test bench using a driver side airbag module. Three loading configurations were performed: membrane only, punch-out only, and both types combined. The membrane-only tests were performed with the thorax initially positioned at 13, 78 and 128 mm from the plate in order to vary the load magnitude. The punch-out and the combined tests were performed with the thorax initially 8 mm from the module. Accelerometers and angular rate sensors were fixed on the sternum and on the first, fourth, and eighth thoracic vertebrae of the PMHS. Ribs 2 to 6 were instrumented with strain gauges. The reaction force of the bag on the plate was measured using four 2 -axis load cells. Results showed that both pure punch-out and pure membrane loading can result in thoracic injuries. However, the rib fracture locations seemed to differ from one type of loading to the other. Moreover, for the same initial distance between the airbag module and the thorax, the injuries were more severe in the combined effect tests than in the pure punch-out or pure membrane. LAB- 2008 : Ribs of 8 PMHS were equipped with up to 96 strain gauges. In a first series of 3 tests, the subjects were seated upright and their chests were loaded by a 23. 4 kg impactor propelled at 4. 3 m/s in pure frontal, oblique and pure lateral directions. In a second series of 3 tests, the subjects were loaded by the deployment of an unfolded airbag in the same 3 directions. Part B The shoulder complex is rarely exposed to injuries in frontal and oblique frontal collisions, but influence the belt interaction and as such the thorax compression and head kinematics. The purpose of this study was to establish response requirements for the shoulder complex in terms of range-of-motion and stiffness. Six male volunteers were seated in a rigid seat that simulated a car driver’s posture whilst in a special designed test rig. Loads to the shoulders were applied through the arms, by means of brackets fastened to the elbows, loads rearward were applied by means of a strap around the shoulder complex. Torso movement was blocked by two pre-tensed <b>diagonal</b> <b>belts</b> that were routed close to the neck to avoid excessive clavicle interaction. Shoulders were loaded with increasing load from 0 ̶ 200 N/shoulder at 50 N increments. A test series included four load series: shoulders pulled straight forward, forward-upward, upward and rearward. Each volunteer was exposed to three tests. Shoulder positions relative to the spine were obtained from film analysis. Photo markers were mounted on the volunteer’s skin: head, posterior tip of acromion process, chest, T 1 and T 4. The right and left acromion relative to T 1 displacements were used to calculate the shoulder range-of-motion in three directions. Belt loads and seat back loads were recorded. Average resultant volunteers’ acromion relative to T 1 range-of-motion, at the maximum load, was 55 mm for forward loads, 69 mm for forward-upward loads, 73 for mm upward loads and 50 mm for rearward loads. The volunteers provided measurements with reasonable repeatability. The volunteers curved their spines only slightly when shoulder loads were applied. Hence, shoulder complex motion was successfully isolated and results reflect pure shoulder relative to chest motions. The applied loads were lower than those commonly seen in frontal crashes, however the shoulder is highly mobile and its response to loads is largely dependent on muscle characteristics. As such studies using volunteers may be complimentary to tests with post mortem human subjects...|$|R
