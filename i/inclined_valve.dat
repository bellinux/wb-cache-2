50|$|The EA series {{brought new}} engines to the Ford Falcon along with {{across the board}} fuel injection, {{overhead}} camshaft cylinder head, <b>inclined</b> <b>valve</b> alloy heads and a low profile intake manifold lowering the engine height. The capacity was decreased from the previous XF which was 4.1 litres and an overhead valve (OHV) design. All EA series engines utilised the corporate Ford EEC-IV engine management system.|$|E
5000|$|The more {{powerful}} versions {{will be developed}} by Amédée Gordini from the original engine. The machining of the <b>inclined</b> <b>valve</b> seats allows for a greater range but leaving intact the camshaft spindle, improved cylinder head cooling, and the engine is fitted with a new 32 mm Solex carburettor [...] This, {{in conjunction with the}} increase in compression ratio, results in a maximum power of 37 hp SAE at 5,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 62.8 Nm at 3500 rpm. This engine made its debut in the fall of 1957, then, in 1959, it underwent further modifications and its power was increased to 40 hp SAE. The [...] "Sorcerer" [...] then makes a small preparation, thus the Dauphine Gordini (type R1091) is born in 1957.|$|E

50|$|The pre-war {{locomotives}} were {{equipped with}} two large <b>inclined</b> Ross-pop safety <b>valves,</b> {{mounted on the}} upper sides of the boiler {{just ahead of the}} firebox and aimed about 80 degrees apart. When these <b>inclined</b> <b>valves</b> blew off under a station canopy, bystanders often received a shower of slimy wet soot. After the war, they were replaced by four smaller Ross-pop valves at the highest point of the boiler that blew off straight up.|$|R

50|$|Major Halford built two 6-cylinder in-line engines for the car. Each had an {{aluminium}} cylinder-block and crankcase {{with steel}} liners, with rubber seals at their base. Bore and stroke were 63 mm and 80 mm giving 1.5 litres, the Grand Prix formula for 1926. The cylinder heads were cast iron with two camshafts, twelve <b>inclined</b> <b>valves,</b> and two 12 mm plugs per cylinder.|$|R
50|$|Where fuel {{quality is}} low and octane rating is poor, {{compression}} ratios will be restricted. In these cases, the sidevalve engine still has much to offer. Particularly {{in the case of}} the developed IOE engine for a market with poor fuels, engines such as Rolls-Royce B series or the Land-Rover use a complicated arrangement of <b>inclined</b> <b>valves,</b> a cylinder head line at an angle to the bore and corresponding angled pistons to provide a compact combustion chamber approaching the near-hemispherical ideal. Such engines remained in production into the 1990s, only being finally replaced when the fuels available 'in the field' became more likely to be diesel than petrol.|$|R
50|$|The new {{detachable}} {{aluminium alloy}} cylinder head was fitted over <b>inclined</b> side <b>valves</b> and anodised aluminium alloy pistons. Pressure lubrication was supplied to the tappets, coolant temperature {{was controlled by}} thermostat and coil ignition was provided with automatic advance.|$|R
50|$|Each of {{the three}} team cars was {{designed}} around its intended driver integrating each driver’s requirements and preferences. The asymmetrically <b>inclined</b> <b>valves</b> (inlet 20 degrees and outlet 40 degrees from vertical) were a significant departure for Henry and may be attributable to Sunbeam and Coatalen whose interest in desaxé configuration dated to 1911. Another unusual detail was the engine mounted directly on the chassis frame similarly to the 1921 'invincible Talbot-Darracq'. Following tests in Brooklands and Isle of Man prior to the Grand Prix, modifications were instigated to the tail support bracket. Different carburetor configurations and different tyre types were tried, axle ratios experimented with, aero screens and mudguards were installed or removed as required.|$|R
5000|$|The Sunbeam's {{engine was}} of 2,920 cc, {{distributed}} between six cylinders. It featured <b>inclined</b> <b>valves</b> operated via easily adjustable tappet levers by two overhead camshafts, an important innovation at the time. The detailed {{design of the}} engine followed many {{of the principles of}} the engines which were gathering plaudits for the company on European racing circuits. The cylinder head and block were formed from a single casting which was then considered normal for high-performance engines. [...] One of the novel features of the engine was its use of dry-sump lubrication whereby engine oil was drawn from a tank positioned beside the engine. In 1929 a supercharger was added, increasing the power output to 135bhp.|$|R
5000|$|With alloy {{cylinder}} head, hemi-spherical combustion chambers, <b>inclined</b> <b>valves</b> [...] and twin side-draft SU carburetors, {{the dual}} overhead-cam 3.4 L straight-6 XK engine was comparatively advanced for a mass-produced {{unit of the}} time. With standard 8:1 compression ratio it developed , using 80 octane fuel. Most of the early cars were exported; a 7:1 low-compression version, with consequently reduced performance, was reserved for the UK market, where the post-war austerity measures then in force restricted buyers to 70 octane [...] "Pool petrol". The Jaguar factory, with access to 80 octane fuel, provided roadsters with the higher compression ratio to the press. Journalists could then test the model's optimum performance in Belgium, on a long, straight stretch of road between Jabbeke and Ostend. The XK engine's basic design, later modified into 3.8 and 4.2 litre versions, survived into the late 1980s.|$|R
50|$|The 1915 batch (Classified 52 and 502) had direct motion, without rocker arms, driving <b>inclined</b> piston <b>valves,</b> and Robinson superheater. The only {{external}} {{difference was}} that the shaft and reversing rod were a little higher {{which resulted in the}} rear of the left hand side sandbox rod being inclined upwards from the centre sandbox back to the firebox.|$|R

50|$|The racing {{engine was}} {{extensively}} redesigned and the cylinder heads were {{replaced with a}} more conventional two-valve design, employing a SOHC acting directly on vertically <b>inclined</b> <b>valves</b> through bucket tappets, {{in a move that}} bore striking similarity to the cylinder head design of the contemporary Rover 2000, a similarity which is further noted in the use of a flat-cylinder head and dished 'heron' pistons of both engines. These changes greatly reduced complexity, weight, size and noise.The revised head design had restrictive and long inlet ports which sacrificed top-end power but which, along with an increase in displacement to 5.3 litres, greatly improved performance at low-mid engine speeds, which was desirable in what was planned to be a heavy luxury car. The chain-driven SOHC heads and the soft valve springs fitted to reduce valvetrain noise resulted in the redline being lowered to 6,500 rpm from the 8,000 rpm of the original quad-cam design. When the limousine project was cancelled the engine was again retired {{for a number of years}} before finally seeing production in the series III E-type in 1971.|$|R
5000|$|The {{locomotives}} were superheated, {{with outside}} plate frames, Walschaerts <b>valve</b> gear, <b>inclined</b> cylinders, piston <b>valves</b> and round-topped fireboxes. Designed for light [...] rail, their lightness of construction made them {{popular with the}} fitters who had to maintain them.|$|R
5000|$|The six-cylinder 2½-litre engine has <b>inclined</b> {{overhead}} <b>valves</b> {{on either}} side of the cylinder head. They are opened by rockers operated by a single overhead camshaft which is driven by double roller chain. The S.U. carburettor is bolted to the cylinder head which may be removed with the valve train without affecting engine timing. The crankshaft has been given four bearings. The pistons are of aluminium and the connecting rods are steel. Cooling water circulates by pump.|$|R
50|$|The core of Bill Lyons' success {{following}} WWII was the twin-cam straight six engine, conceived pre-war and realised while {{engineers at}} the Coventry plant were dividing their time between fire-watching and designing the new power plant. It had a hemispherical cross-flow cylinder head with <b>valves</b> <b>inclined</b> from the vertical; originally at 30 degrees (inlet) and 45 degrees (exhaust) and later standardised to 45 degrees for both inlet and exhaust.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} had inside cylinders, arranged at an <b>incline,</b> with slide <b>valves</b> {{which were}} actuated by Stephenson valve gear through rocker shafts. The cylinders and valve gear were placed between the plate frames and {{hidden from view}} by the wheels, which were coupled with external connecting rods. Together with the Cape Town Railway & Dock’s Blackie of 1859, these were the only two-cylinder locomotives with an inside cylinder and valve gear arrangement to see service in South Africa.|$|R
50|$|The 1,087 cc {{four-cylinder engine}} had {{hemispherical}} combustion chambers with the <b>valves</b> <b>inclined</b> at 45 degrees in a crossflow head. To save the expense and complication of overhead camshafts, the valves were operated by two camshafts mounted {{high in the}} crankcase through short pushrods and rockers. The engine was mounted in the chassis by a rubber bushed bar that ran through the block with a further mount {{at the rear of}} the gearbox. Drive was to the rear wheels through a torque tube and spiral bevel live rear axle mounted on semi elliptic springs.|$|R
50|$|Ernest Henry, who {{was then}} 27 years old, started from a drawing board and a blank page in the racing department, working in secret in Suresnes (in Rossel's former factory), with a budget {{allocated}} by the Peugeot factory Through skill and ingenuity Ernest Henry would materialize innovative ideas and sometimes a little iconoclastic team. He wanted to get high speeds {{through the use of}} double camshaft in head-driven shaft with a bevel at each end. The engine born in early 1912 featured <b>inclined</b> actuating four <b>valves</b> {{for each of the four}} cylinders, a very good four-cylinder twin camshaft cylinder head with hemispherical combustion chambers, 4 valves per cylinder arranged in V, and 7.6 liter capacity.|$|R
50|$|Introduced in 1926 in {{a humble}} but innovatively {{designed}} fabric bodied saloon, Percy Riley's ground-breaking Riley 9 engine- a small capacity, high revving unit- {{was ahead of}} its time in many respects. Having hemispherical combustion chambers and <b>inclined</b> overhead <b>valves,</b> it has been called the most significant engine development of the 1920s. With twin camshafts set high in the cylinder block and valves operated by short pushrods, it provided power and efficiency without the servicing complexity of an OHC (overhead camshaft) layout. It soon attracted the attention of tuners and builders of 'specials' intended for sporting purposes. One such was engineer/driver J.G. Parry-Thomas, who conceived the Riley 'Brooklands' (initially called the '9' Speed Model) in his workshops at the banked Surrey circuit. After Parry-Thomas was killed during a land speed record attempt in 1927, his close collaborator Reid Railton stepped in to finish the job. Officially backed by Riley, the Brooklands, along with later developments and variations such as the 'Ulster' Imp, MPH, and Sprite, proved some of the most successful works and privateer racing cars of the late 1920s and early 1930s. At Le Mans in 1934, Rileys finished 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th and 12th, winning the Rudge-Whitworth Cup, the Team Prize, two class awards, and the Ladies' Prize. Rileys also distinguished themselves at the Ulster TT, at Brooklands itself, and at smaller events like hill climbs, while providing a platform for the success of motorsports' first women racing drivers such as Kay Petre, Dorothy Champney and Joan Richmond. Another engineer/driver, Freddie Dixon, was responsible for extensive improvements to engine and chassis tuning, creating a number of 'specials' that exploited the basic Riley design still further, and contributed greatly to its success on the track.|$|R
40|$|The work {{summarized}} here {{comprises the}} concluding effort of a multi-year project, {{funded by the}} U. S. Department of Energy, Office of Vehicle Technologies. It supports {{the development of a}} better understanding of advanced diesel engine designs in which enhanced power density, energy efficiency, and emissions control place increasing demands upon the durability of engine materials. Many kinds of metallic alloys are used in engines depending on the operating stresses, temperatures, and chemical environments. Exhaust valves, for example, are subjected to high temperatures and repetitive surface contacts that place demands on durability and frictional characteristics of the materials. Valves must continue to seal the combustion chamber properly for thousands of hours of cyclic engine operation and under varying operating conditions. It was the focus of this effort to understand the wear processes in the valve-seat area and to develop a model for the surface deformation and wear of that important interface. An annotated bibliography is provided to illustrate efforts to understand valve wear and to investigate the factors of engine operation that affect its severity and physical manifestation. The project for which this modeling effort was the final task, involved construction of a high-temperature repetitive impact test system as well as basic tribology studies of the combined processes of mechanical wear plus oxidation at elevated temperatures. Several publications resulted from this work, and are cited in this report. The materials selected for the experimental work were high-performance alloys based on nickel and cobalt. In some cases, engine-tested exhaust valves were made available for wear analysis and to ensure that the modes of surface damage produced in experiments were simulative of service. New, production-grade exhaust valves were also used to prepare test specimens for experimental work along with the other alloy samples. Wear analysis of valves and seats run for hundreds of hours in heavy-duty diesels provided insights into the kinds of complexity that the contact conditions in engines can produce, and suggested the physical basis for the current approach to modeling. The model presented here involves four terms, two representing the valve response and two for its mating seat material. The model's structure assumes that wear that takes place under a complex combination of plastic deformation, tangential shear, and oxidation. Tribolayers form, are removed, and may reform. Layer formation affects the friction forces in the interface, and in turn, the energy available to do work on the materials to cause wear. To provide friction data for the model at various temperatures, sliding contact experiments were conducted from 22 to 850 C in a pin-on-disk apparatus at ORNL. In order to account for the behavior of different materials and engine designs, parameters in all four terms of the model can be adjusted to account for wear-in and incubation periods before the dominant wear processes evolve to their steady-state rates. For example, the deformation rate is assumed to be maximum during the early stages of operation, and then, due to material work-hardening and the increase in nominal contact area (which reduces the load per unit area), decreases to a lower rate at long times. Conversely, the rate of abrasion increases with time or number of cycles due to the build-up of oxides and tribo-layers between contact surfaces. The competition between deformation and abrasion results in complex, non-linear behavior of material loss per cycle of operation. Furthermore, these factors are affected by valve design features, such as the angle of <b>incline</b> of the <b>valve</b> seat. Several modeling scenarios are presented to demonstrate how the wear profile versus number of cycles changes in response to: (a) different relative abrasion rates of the seat and valve materials, (b) the friction coefficient as a function of temperature, (c) the relative deformation contribution of valve and seat materials, and (d) an interruption in the dominant wear process...|$|R
