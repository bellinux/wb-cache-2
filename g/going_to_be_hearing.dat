5000|$|Idolator's Rachel Sonis {{labeled the}} song [...] "endlessly infectious". Chris DeVille of Stereogum called it [...] "a {{gorgeous}} thing to behold: thumping acoustic guitar figures, a crisply minimal disco drum beat, eerie background noise, thunderous bass, and twinkling pianos, all topped off by Grimes-reminiscent high-end vocal work. You're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>hearing</b> {{this one for}} a long time." [...] Pastes Scott Russell dubbed it [...] "hauntingly beautiful". Alex Siber of Pigeons and Planes said [...] "what sounds like a soft-spoken soul begins to soar, liberated, as the record progresses. Rogers breathes the crisp air of glacial plains, fueling a voice that's at once as delicate and powerful as the nature she describes and samples in the track's backbone. Each component of 'Alaska' pulses with the same heartbeat, amplifying itself like an echo chamber in which dancing is required and sadness is left at the door. What remains is an ear worm as infectious as it is earnest, one that took time to crystalize." ...|$|E
40|$|I {{have heard}} that there <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a <b>hearing</b> on March 16 - 19 in Augusta to discuss the {{possibility}} of a new Nuclear utility site on the Savanna River. My understanding is that the proposed Nuclear reactors would require millions of gallons of water per day <b>to</b> <b>be</b> pulled from the Savannah River at this location. And that would <b>be</b> in addition <b>to</b> the millions of gallons that are already being pulled by the Vogtle utility. Water has become a precious commodity in this area due to recent drought conditions. This river basin is downstream from Lake Hartwell and Lake Keowee which are both already at extremely low levels. Water Utilities in both Georgia and South Carolina have {{over the last few years}} imposed mandatory water restrictions in various areas that impact the water flow in the Savanna river basin. This facility would not only affect water requirements in this area it would also increase downstream water temperatures, which could negatively impact fisheries and the livelihood of fishermen. Please reconsider {{the possibility of a}}dding an additional drain on the water resources-of this already parched region. There <b>are</b> other ways <b>to</b> produce energy that don't require the volumes of water that this facility would require. Thank you...|$|R
