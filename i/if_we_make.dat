25|$|Let our graph {{have two}} {{partitions}} U, V. The key {{idea is to}} add two dummy vertices {{on each side of}} the graph: uDummy connecting it to all unmatched vertices in U and vDummy connecting to all unmatched vertices in V. Now if we run BFS from uDummy to vDummy then we can get shortest path between an unmatched vertex in U to unmatched vertex in V. Due to bipartite nature of the graph, this path would zig zag from U to V. However we need to make sure that when going from V to U, we always select matched edge. If there is no matched edge then we end at vDummy. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>make</b> sure of this criteria during BFS then the generated path would meet the criteria for being an augmented shortest path.|$|E

500|$|After {{he saw the}} {{completed}} episode, James L. Brooks called the writers and suggested that the Kamp Krusty script {{be used as a}} plotline for a film. However, the episode ran very short, and to make it barely fit the minimum time the Kamp Krusty song had to be lengthened by a number of verses. The episode was also chosen to be the first episode of the season, further complicating matters. As Jean told Brooks, [...] "First of all, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>make</b> it into the movie then we don't have a premiere, and second, if we can't make 18 minutes out of this episode how are we supposed to make 80?" ...|$|E

500|$|Before the {{establishment}} of the National Action Plan, a variety of people and organizationsincluding First Nations, human trafficking victims, law enforcement, and victim service providerscriticized Canada for failing to have such a plan. Charles Momy, president of the Canadian Police Association, said that despite existing efforts from local law enforcement agencies, Canada lacked and required [...] "a coordinated response to ensure the offenders are prosecuted, and put a stop to this modern day form of slavery." [...] In October 2008, John Fenn of Toronto's Streetlight Support Services expressed his frustration that there was still no national action plan on this subject despite the passing of the corresponding motion the previous year. Fenn said, [...] "Even <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>make</b> a muck of the thing if we get started, let's get started."

2500|$|The {{notion of}} the DCFL {{is closely related to}} the {{deterministic}} pushdown automaton (DPDA). It is where the language power of [...] pushdown automatons is reduced to <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>make</b> them deterministic; [...] the pushdown automatons become unable to choose between different state-transition alternatives and as a consequence cannot recognize all context-free languages. Unambiguous grammars do not always generate a DCFL. For example, the language of even-length palindromes on the alphabet of 0 and 1 has the unambiguous context-free grammar S → 0S0 | 1S1 | ε. An arbitrary string of this language cannot be parsed without reading all its letters first, which means that a pushdown automaton has to try alternative state transitions to accommodate for the different possible lengths of a semi-parsed string.|$|E

[...] Oh! that our minds might be enlightened, – that our hearts might be opened, – that we might know the difference between thing and thing.

On 2 February a committee specially convened reported to the Commons 23Heads of Grievances, which the Commons approved and added some of their own. However, on 4 February the Commons decided to instruct the committee to differentiate between [...] "such of the general heads, as are introductory of new laws, from those that are declaratory of ancient rights".
