5|$|There are literary, archaeological, epigraphic and numismatic {{sources of}} ancient Tamil history. The {{foremost}} among these sources is the Sangam literature, generally dated {{to the last}} centuries BCE to early centuries CE.

Bede said that the sons had never been converted, and after Æthelberht's death they attempted to force Mellitus to give them the Eucharist without ever becoming Christians, seeing the Eucharist as magical. Although Bede does not <b>give</b> <b>details</b> of any political factors surrounding the event, it is likely that by expelling Mellitus the sons were demonstrating their independence from Kent, and repudiating the overlordship that Æthelberht had exercised over the East Saxons. There is no evidence that Christians among the East Saxons were mistreated or oppressed after Mellitus' departure.|$|E

25|$|The {{game was}} first {{announced}} in August 2014 {{with an initial}} release of December, though it was later delayed multiple times, partially due to the developers changing the game engine partway through development. Players who pre-order VA-11 HALL-A gain access to a playable prologue which is independent of the actual game. The game was initially only offered on desktop platforms, though the PlayStation Vita port was later announced by Wolfgame at the Game Developers Conference 2015; where another trailer was also shown. The final release date of June 21 was confirmed by Sukeban Games for the Windows, OS X, and Linux versions of VA-11 HALL-A in early June 2016.
