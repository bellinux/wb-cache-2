5|$|Massachusetts {{is located}} along the Atlantic Flyway, a major route for migratory {{waterfowl}} {{along the eastern}} coast. Lakes in central Massachusetts provide <b>habitat</b> <b>for</b> many species of fish and waterfowl, but some species such as the common loon are becoming rare. A significant population of long-tailed ducks winter off Nantucket. Small offshore islands and beaches are home to roseate terns and are important breeding areas for the locally threatened piping plover. Protected {{areas such as the}} Monomoy National Wildlife Refuge provide critical breeding <b>habitat</b> <b>for</b> shorebirds and a variety of marine wildlife including a large population of grey seals.|$|E
5000|$|Birdwatchers {{and other}} naturalists: the park's terrain is quite {{variable}} {{and there are}} many excellent <b>habitats</b> <b>for</b> bird watching. Access to many of the best <b>habitats</b> <b>for</b> birds is still limited, but this is seldom a barrier to the most eager of birders.|$|R
5|$|The conifer and mixed-forests of {{the park}} and its {{surroundings}} provide <b>habitats</b> <b>for</b> northern saw-whet owl, blue-headed vireo, hermit thrush, dark-eyed junco, and magnolia, pine, yellow-rumped, Blackburnian, and black-throated green warblers. The deciduous forests provide <b>habitats</b> <b>for</b> songbirds, such as scarlet tanager and red-eyed vireo.|$|R

5|$|The {{forests in}} and around Ricketts Glen State Park {{are some of the}} most {{extensive}} in northeastern Pennsylvania, and provide <b>habitat</b> <b>for</b> a wide variety of woodland creatures. The swampy areas in the park provide a <b>habitat</b> <b>for</b> plants like black gum, yellow birch, cinnamon fern, sphagnum and various sedges. The old-growth forest in the Glens Natural Area is mostly eastern hemlock, eastern white pine, and oaks, and the park is home to 85species of shrubs, woody vines, and trees, including seven kinds of conifers.|$|E
5|$|The ideal <b>habitat</b> <b>for</b> these rabbits {{is in an}} {{area between}} mature and young forests. They use the dense mature forests as {{protection}} and {{for the presence of}} pampas grass, in the summer, and acorns, in the winter, for their diets. They also use the high density of perennial grasses and herbaceous ground cover in the young forests for their diets during different times of the year. Therefore, the best <b>habitat</b> <b>for</b> them to live in is where they have easy access to both young and mature forests with no obstructions between the two forest types.|$|E
5|$|The tidal {{reaches of}} the River Avon provide <b>habitat</b> <b>for</b> waterbirds, with 64 species having been {{recorded}} up to 2004, including 21 species of shorebird, and 13 species of gull.|$|E

50|$|Estuaries provide <b>habitats</b> <b>for</b> a {{large number}} of organisms and support very high productivity. Estuaries provide <b>habitats</b> <b>for</b> many fish nurseries, {{depending}} upon their locations in the world, such as salmon and sea trout. Also, migratory bird populations, such as the black-tailed godwit, make essential use of estuaries.|$|R

5|$|At {{the time}} the Warren Hill would have {{overlooked}} a large river valley that was to become the English Channel. Once the sea had inundated the surrounding valley, Mesolithic hunter gatherers exploited the site. Pollen analysis of peat from the Solent bed suggest a lightly wooded headland free of close-knit undergrowth during this period, an ideal <b>habitat</b> <b>for</b> game.|$|E

5|$|Extensive {{deforestation}} {{has resulted}} in loss of trees such as acacias, baobab, dates and palm trees. This has also caused loss of natural <b>habitat</b> <b>for</b> wild animals; {{one of the main}} reasons for this is also hunting and livestock farming by increasing human settlements. Populations of animals like lions, leopards and rhino have fallen significantly.|$|E
5|$|First {{recorded}} and surveyed in 1840, North Island {{has been a}} seasonal camp for western rock lobster fishermen {{since the beginning of}} the 20th century, and this remains the principal focus of human activity on the island. There is also a small amount of tourism, though for the most part it is reserved as conservation <b>habitat</b> <b>for</b> vegetation communities and rare birds.|$|E
5|$|From this core, {{specifically}} from {{ice that}} {{is thought to}} have formed from lake water freezing onto the base of the ice sheet, extremophile microbes were found, suggesting that the lake water supports life. Scientists suggested that the lake could possess a unique <b>habitat</b> <b>for</b> ancient bacteria with an isolated microbial gene pool containing characteristics developed perhaps 500,000years ago.|$|E
