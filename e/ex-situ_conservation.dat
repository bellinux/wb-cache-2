The Amphibian Specialist Group of the IUCN is spearheading efforts to implement a comprehensive global strategy for amphibian conservation. Amphibian Ark is an organization that was formed to implement the <b>ex-situ</b> <b>conservation</b> recommendations of this plan, and they have been working with zoos and aquaria around the world, encouraging them to create assurance colonies of threatened amphibians.

The morphological analysis was congruent with the peasant classification, contrary to the molecular markers. The comparison between both conservation strategies revealed a larger intra-varietal diversity in in-situ conditions and a genetic divergence between plants. The traditional practices are likely to be responsible of the intra-varietal polymorphism since the oca is propagated almost exclusively vegetatively. At the conservation level, differences could be explained by the sampling methods.

Parameters of flowering measured daily on each of 10 selected individual based on Ghazoul and Owens methods. Pollination mechanisms investigated by observing the attractant availability provided by 10 marked individual of each provenance. Observation was then made on plant pollinator interactions: stigmatic contact, pollen load, interplant movement, feeding behavior and visitation rate; that were measured daily based on Ghazoul and Jones and Little methods.

Apart existing forty four ecoraces, a new wild-race JATA (univoltine) with superior cocoon traits, invent under in-situ habitat of Thakurmunda, Simlipal biosphere, India. The extensive collection of its nature grown cocoons has depleted the race population and the imperative need is to conserve in-situ, stabilize ex-situ to save this tasar race from extinction and also to exploit its optimal commercial potential. The systematic evaluation and ex-situ studies under Central Tasar Research and Training Institute, Ranchi, India indicates that the race attained bivoltine status with sustainable fecundity (209 eggs) and cocoon yield (55 nos), consistent moth emergence (72. 6 %) and coupling (84. 1 %). The wider phenotypic and cocoon commercial trait variability vividly substantiate that Jata is different from Modal, Sukinda and Daba and not an off-shoot of other ecoraces of the zone. The change of voltinism, acclimatization to ex-situ climate, amenability for commercial rearings and seed production with feasible cocoon yields of the race JATA, off its niche during successive generations indicate its status and potential over in-practice Daba and Sukinda ecoraces.
