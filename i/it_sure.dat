500|$|Despite {{the good}} reviews, {{there was no}} {{universal}} acclaim from critics as a whole. Robert Canning of IGN said that [...] " [...] wasn't the most spectacular half-hour from this truncated season" [...] and [...] "unfortunately, there wasn't all that much that was funny about <b>it.</b> <b>Sure,</b> {{there were a couple}} of decent one-liners, but overall [...] offered up nothing new." [...] Despite these criticisms, Canning added further praise to the [...] "Midnight Train to Georgia" [...] performance. Canning gave this episode a rating of 8.4 out of 10.|$|E

[...] The team wanted to re-sign Carlos Ruiz (or find another catcher) and sign a right-handed-hitting corner outfielder and a middle-of-the-rotation starter to supplement Cole Hamels and Cliff Lee after the departure of Roy Halladay and the discovery of medical problems in Cuban Miguel Alfredo González, signed by the Phillies the previous summer.|$|E

[...] Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times [...] gave it a three-out-of-four rating, saying [...] "Its 22 tracks should be two albums: The first, a club-directed missile helmed by [...] "Darkchild" [...] Rodney Jerkins and Jackson's beau, Jermaine Dupri, could reassert Jackson's primacy among glamazon hit-makers; the second, a bedroom-bound ladies' favorite coauthored by soul dauphin Ne-Yo, would remind fans of Jackson's gift for creating truly tender smut." ...|$|E

500|$|The A.V. Club's Noel Murray graded {{the episode}} with an A-, admitting that despite its faults, he [...] "enjoyed {{the hell out}} of" [...] it. He loved it for several reasons: he is {{a big fan of}} Anna Torv's Bellivia {{performance}} and its plotline, the drugs incorporated into the plot, its Inception-like qualities, the animation, and Bell's final goodbye. IGN Fringe reviewer Ramsey Isler rated the episode 8.0/10, calling it [...] "one of the most memorable Fringe episodes to date." [...] Like Murray, Isler also noted the similarities to Inception {{as well as to the}} 1968 film Yellow Submarine and the 1977 science fiction novel A Scanner Darkly. Isler did however remark that [...] "Lysergic Acid Diethylamide" [...] "end a string of episodes that didn't really have much point", though it was a [...] "beautiful episode that doesn't really do much for the mythology of the series... <b>it</b> <b>sure</b> was a blast to watch." ...|$|E
500|$|As the 1950 Detroit Tigers season started, Houtteman {{was on a}} high note, {{pitching}} all {{of spring}} training without allowing a walk. He won his tenth {{game of the season}} on June 28, 1950, and became the first pitcher to hit the 10-win mark alongside Bob Lemon. After the game, he told an Associated Press reporter that he was just about convinced that Lady Luck had decided to give him a break after kicking him around for the past two or three years. Houtteman said, [...] "I've been having a pretty good year and <b>it</b> <b>sure</b> feels good after {{some of the things that}} have happened to me". A week into July, Houtteman notched his eleventh victory, and only lost five games, in a 6–1 win against the St. Louis Browns. Just a few days later, Houtteman was named to the All-Star roster alongside fellow Tigers including Ted Gray, George Kell and Hoot Evers. In the 1950 All-Star game, Houtteman pitched three innings and batted once. He allowed one earned run, three hits, and one walk, his one earned run coming in the ninth inning on a Ralph Kiner home run that made the game go to extra innings.|$|E
500|$|In {{comparing}} {{the film to}} its predecessor, Dr. No, Richard Roud, writing in The Guardian, said that From Russia with Love [...] "didn't seem quite so lively, quite so fresh, or quite so rhythmically fast-moving." [...] He {{went on to say}} that [...] "...the film is highly immoral in every imaginable way; it is neither uplifting, instructive nor life-enhancing. Neither is it great film-making. But <b>it</b> <b>sure</b> is fun." [...] Writing in The Observer, Penelope Gilliatt noted that [...] "The way the credits are done has the same self-mocking flamboyance as everything else in the picture." [...] Gilliatt {{went on to say that}} the film manages [...] "to keep up its own cracking pace, nearly all the way. The set-pieces are a stunning box of tricks". The critic for The Times wrote of Bond that he is [...] "the secret ideal of the congenital square, conventional in every particular... except in morality, where he has the courage—and the physical equipment—to do without thinking what most of us feel we might be doing..." [...] The critic thought that overall, [...] "the nonsense is all very amiable and tongue-in-cheek and will no doubt make a fortune for its devisers".|$|E

The Daily Heralds Ted Cox wrote that [...] " [...] to insist that <b>it</b> <b>sure</b> {{seems to me that}} not just Fey and Liz, but most of all viewers at home deserve better." [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said that [...] "I saw [...] "Subway Hero" [...] a while back, and as I wrote in my column last week, my {{reaction}} to it was roughly {{the same as it was}} to [...] "MILF Island": a number of very funny individual moments, but an episode that was less than the sum of its parts." [...] David Hinckley of The New York Daily News said that there were [...] "a lot of former-boyfriend gags that are, once again, well-formulated" [...] in this episode and that [...] "They work." [...] Hinckley also wrote that [...] "the real reason [...] is must-see TV is a guest spot by Tim Conway as an old-time television star whose deadpan recollections of the [...] "good old days" [...] keep getting weirder and funnier.

500|$|With the film's success, it was {{immediately}} decided to finish Superman II. Ilya and Alexander Salkind and Pierre Spengler {{did not ask}} Donner to return because Donner had criticized them during the film's publicity phase. Donner commented in January 1979, [...] "I'd work with Spengler again, but only on my terms. As long as {{he has nothing to}} say as the producer, and is just liaison between Alexander Salkind and his money, that's fine. If they don't want it on those terms, then they need to go out and find another director, <b>it</b> <b>sure</b> as shit ain't gonna be me." [...] Kidder, who portrayed Lois Lane, was dissatisfied by the producers' decision, and also criticized the Salkinds during publicity. As a result, Kidder was only given a cameo appearance for Superman III, and not a main supporting role. Jack O'Halloran, who portrayed Non, stated, [...] "It was great to work with Donner. Richard Lester was as big an asshole as the Salkinds." [...] Two more films, Superman III (1983) and [...] (1987), were produced. Superman Returns was released in 2006. Director Bryan Singer credited the 1978 Superman as an influence for Superman Returns, and used restored footage of Brando as Jor-El. [...] also was released in 2006.|$|E
500|$|The {{soundtrack of}} the film {{received}} mainly-positive reviews. Rumnique Nannar of Bollyspice gave the soundtrack three-and-a-half stars, saying [...] "the album succeeds in all respects, since it features a remake, a retro song, and two gems, and manages to fit with the film's tone and mood of the 80s". Movie Talkies also gave the soundtrack three-and-a-half stars, remarking that [...] "the soundtrack of OUATIMD is an excellent effort from Pritam and {{is sure to be}} lapped up by the audiences {{in much the same way}} as its predecessor. <b>It</b> <b>sure</b> might be a short album with just four songs in it but suffice to say, Quality wins over Quantity". Rajiv Vijayakar of Bollywood Hungama said that [...] "the soundtrack has only four songs but nevertheless emerges as one of the better albums of this year" [...] praising the first three tracks identifying Tu Hi Khwahish and Chugliyaan as the finest and weakest links of the album respectively. Bryan Durham of The Times of India said that [...] "brevity seems to be the soul of the Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai Dobaara soundtrack", highlighting Yeh Tune Kya Kiya as the best song." [...] Mohar Basu reviewed the soundtrack for Koimoi, summarising it to be [...] "just about alright... in comparison to its predecessor turned out to be drab!" ...|$|E

[...] Mücke stated that he felt okay after his heavy crash and thanked his team for constructing a safe vehicle.

[...] Nero calls 'Hey Daddy' [...] "one of more than half a dozen sex songs on the album." [...] Sara D. Anderson of AOL Music said that the song has a [...] "catchy R tune" [...] and [...] "the song showcases Usher's role as the ladies' man as he croons: [...] "You know your daddy's home (daddy's home) / And it's time to play (so it's time to play) / So you ain't got to give my loving away." [...] James Reed of The Boston Globe said that the track was one of the album's songs to showcase [...] "Usher's signature loveman moves" [...] however called them [...] "hollow as a chocolate Easter bunny", as he pointed out the whole album had a lack of emotion Andrew Rennie of Now Magazine said that on the song and on [...] "Lil Freak" [...] that Usher shows [...] "he’s unafraid to get lewd".|$|E
500|$|Through late 1967 {{and early}} 1968, Barrett's {{behaviour}} became increasingly erratic and unpredictable, {{partly as a}} consequence of his reported heavy use of psychedelic drugs, most prominently LSD. There is also much speculation that he suffered from schizophrenia. Once described as joyful, friendly, and extroverted, he became increasingly depressed and socially withdrawn, and experienced hallucinations, disorganized speech, memory lapses, intense mood swings, and periods of catatonia. Although the changes began gradually, he went missing for a long weekend and, according to several friends including Rick Wright, came back [...] "a completely different person." [...] One of the striking features of his change was the development of a blank, empty, dead-eyed stare. He was unable to recognize old friends that he had known for years, and often did not know where he was. At one point, while {{on a tour of the}} city of Los Angeles, Barrett is said to have exclaimed, [...] "Gee, <b>it</b> <b>sure</b> is nice to be in Las Vegas!" [...] Many reports described him on stage, strumming one chord through the entire concert, or not playing at all. At a show at The Fillmore in San Francisco, during a performance of [...] "Interstellar Overdrive", Barrett slowly detuned his guitar. The audience seemed to enjoy such antics, unaware of the rest of the band's consternation. Interviewed on Pat Boone's show during this tour, Syd's reply to Boone's questions was a [...] "blank and totally mute stare," [...] according to Nick Mason, [...] "Syd wasn't into moving his lips that day." [...] Barrett exhibited similar behaviour during the band's first appearance on Dick Clark's popular TV show American Bandstand. Although surviving footage of this appearance shows Barrett miming his parts of the song competently, during a group interview afterwards, when asked two questions by Clark, Barrett's answers were terse, almost to the point of rudeness (though, Clark noted, they had been flying non-stop from London to Los Angeles). During this time, Barrett would often forget to bring his guitar to sessions, damage equipment and occasionally was unable to hold his pick. Before a performance in late 1967, Barrett reportedly crushed Mandrax tranquilliser tablets and an entire tube of Brylcreem into his hair, which subsequently melted down his face under the heat of the stage lighting, making him look like [...] "a guttered candle". Nick Mason later disputed the Mandrax portion of this story, stating that [...] "Syd would never waste good mandies".|$|E
