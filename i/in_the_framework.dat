40|$|Periodic {{mesoporous}} organosilica (PMO) spherical particles {{with different}} organic contents were synthesized {{in one pot}} by reacting 1, 2 -bis(triethoxysilyl) ethane (BTSE) with tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) using a spray-drying technique.

The 29 Si magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance data revealed that the organic contents due to ethane fragments embedded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>frameworks</b> were controllable and consistent with the BTSE/TEOS molar ratios of precursor solutions. Transmission electron microscopy, small-angle x-ray scattering, and N 2 adsorption data of PMO with controlled organic contents indicated that the ethane fragments were embedded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>frameworks</b> with <b>the</b> formation of ordered mesostructures.
