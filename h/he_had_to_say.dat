25|$|Any way, the Guru did not issue any {{statement}} to counter Gandhiji's writings in Young India. It {{was never the}} Guru's technique to argue and win. He expressed through actions what <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b>|$|E

He would stop every Member in their tracks to hear what <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> and there are very few Members that have served in this body that can claim the respect that {{both sides of the aisle}} had for the gentleman from California.|$|E
25|$|His poems display {{neither the}} {{incoherence}} of nostalgia for some mentally palatable past nor, however vaguely charted, {{the possibility of}} the future. All he had was the present, which was not to his Muse’s liking, and eventually not to his own either. His poetry, in other words, is that of the here and now and of no escape, except for poetry itself. Yet for all <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about the present, his language is amazingly clear and direct, and the formal aspects of his verse are amazingly conservative. Evidently Kees did not feel the imperative of arrythmia so palpable among his less memorable peers, not to mention successors.|$|E

25|$|Ivo Josipović gave a short speech {{after the}} exit polls were {{announced}} saying he was confident the official results would match the results they predicted. After the official results were published, he gave a victory speech shortly after midnight thanking his colleagues and especially his voters for their support and expressed conviction {{he would be the}} victor once again two weeks later. He said the citizens of Croatia have a choice between the light and the dark, with him being the light, referring to his untarnished political record, and Bandić being the dark, referring to his allegations of corruption. Milan Bandić arrived to his campaign headquarters {{just a couple of minutes}} before midnight and just a couple of minutes after the results were announced he gave his speech. He congratulated all the other candidates and said a new race began that night. He said he would be an independent president, not a remote-control of Zoran Milanović and accused Josipović of being a project of the highest-ranking members of SDP. He claimed Croatia needs a president that works for them, not for his party. While he was speaking, most television networks were showing scenes from Josipović headquarters in the corner, with Milanović observing Bandić's remarks. During the middle of his speech, right when Bandić was bashing his former party and its leader, Josipović came to the stage and all television stations switched to hear what <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b>|$|E
500|$|Historically, {{the press}} had enjoyed {{considerable}} prestige and respect to that point, though some Republicans complained of bias. But in his Des Moines speech, Agnew attacked the media, complaining that immediately after Nixon's speech, [...] "his words and policies {{were subjected to}} instant analysis and querulous criticism... by {{a small band of}} network commentators and self-appointed analysts, the majority of whom expressed {{in one way or another}} their hostility to what <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say...</b> It was obvious that their minds were made up in advance." [...] Agnew continued, [...] "I am asking whether a form of censorship already exists when the news that forty million Americans receive each night is determined by a handful of men... and filtered through a handful of commentators who admit their own set of biases".|$|E
500|$|Hubbard {{played a}} very {{active role in the}} Dianetics boom, writing, lecturing and {{training}} auditors. Many of those who knew him spoke of being impressed by his personal charisma. Jack Horner, who became a Dianetics auditor in 1950, later said, [...] "He was very impressive, dedicated and amusing. The man had tremendous charisma; you just wanted to hear every word <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> and listen for any pearl of wisdom." [...] Isaac Asimov recalled in his autobiography how, at a dinner party, he, Robert Heinlein, L. Sprague de Camp and their wives [...] "all sat as quietly as pussycats and listened to Hubbard. He told tales with perfect aplomb and in complete paragraphs." [...] As Atack comments, he was [...] "a charismatic figure who compelled the devotion of those around him". Christopher Evans described the personal qualities that Hubbard brought to Dianetics and Scientology: ...|$|E

500|$|A {{number of}} {{literary}} theorists have approached the Devotions as politically themed. Richard Strier, in particular, identifies the Devotions as an [...] "Arminian polemic", {{arguing that it}} was highly atypical of Donne to actually publish works, rather than merely let them circulate amongst friends. Both before and after ordination, Donne actively resisted publication, normally only publishing works {{that had been the}} result of a commission, such as The Anniversaries or Pseudo-Martyr. The Devotions, however, were [...] "literally rushed" [...] into print, with the volume being handed to the printers a month after he had recovered from his disease. Strier argues that Donne's rationale for publishing the Devotions matches his rationale for publishing a sermon, the Encaenia, the same year, to assert the importance of [...] "places, and of dayes, and of all outward meanes", because he felt some sense of urgency about what <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> This is coupled with Devotion XVI, in which Donne explicitly comes out against Puritanism and is simultaneously [...] "purposely militant", deliberately frustrating the other extreme from Puritanism, where [...] "the Arminianism and the polemical anti-puritanism of the volume becomes explicit".|$|E
500|$|Biographers {{describe}} Rutherford as {{tall and}} solidly built with a senatorial demeanor, {{and a strong}} booming voice that helped make him a powerful orator. In 1917, The New York Times stated that Rutherford [...] "has a reputation as an eloquent, forceful speaker". Watch Tower Society literature states that his personality contrasted strongly with that of his predecessor. One Witness history book says that while Russell was kind, warm and tactful, Rutherford [...] "was warm and generous toward his associates {{but he was also}} a brusque and direct type of person, and his legal background and experiences in early life gave him a directness in his approach to problems in dealing with his brothers that caused some to take offense." [...] Another Watch Tower Society account says he did not hide his feelings, adding, [...] "His bluntness, even when spoken in kindness, was sometimes misunderstood." [...] Fellow Watch Tower Society director A. H. Macmillan says Rutherford [...] "spoke as simply and directly to the people as he knew how, and he was an extremely forthright man. He was thoroughly convinced that what <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> was the truth and that {{it was a matter of}} life and death." [...] Macmillan added, [...] "He would never tolerate anything that would be contrary to what he clearly understood the Bible to teach. He was so strict about that, he would permit nothing that would seem to show a compromise when it came to an issue of the truth." [...] Author Tony Wills describes him as charitable and generous, and says his sympathy for the poor and oppressed was exceeded only by his hatred for the rich, the oppressors. Wills also notes that he was a dynamic, impatient extrovert. Other authors also address Rutherford's abrasiveness: James Penton describes him as blunt and moody with an explosive temper, with [...] "a streak of self-righteousness which caused him to regard anyone who opposed him as of the Devil", while Alan Rogerson notes that he was a [...] "dogmatic and insensitive person, obsessed with his own self-importance." ...|$|E

When asked whether there was anything <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> to the families of his victims, Bonin stated: [...] "They feel my death will bring closure, but that's not the case.

2500|$|Oglala Lakota Chief American Horse {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} advocates of education for Native Americans. While recruiting at Pine Ridge Reservation, Captain Pratt met strong opposition from Red Cloud, who distrusted white education, and had no school-age children. American Horse [...] "took a lively interest" [...] in what <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> He was a tribal leader and head of a large household with at least ten children. He was a sophisticated man and believed that his children would have to deal with whites, and perhaps live with them, whether they liked it or not.

2500|$|Creedence Clearwater Revival was {{inducted}} into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993. Fogerty refused to perform with his former bandmates and fellow inductees Stu Cook and Doug Clifford during the musical portion of the induction ceremony. In place of the surviving members of CCR, Fogerty recruited session musicians on drums and bass and was also joined by Bruce Springsteen and Robbie Robertson in performing three songs: [...] "Who'll Stop the Rain", [...] "Born on the Bayou" [...] and [...] "Green River". During the induction speech, Springsteen said, [...] "As a songwriter, only a few did as much in three minutes [...] He was an Old Testament, shaggy-haired prophet, a fatalist. [...] Funny, too.

2500|$|Francesco Balilla Pratella {{joined the}} Futurist {{movement}} in 1910 {{and wrote a}} Manifesto of Futurist Musicians in which he appealed to the young (as had Marinetti), because only they could understand what <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> According to Pratella, Italian music was inferior to music abroad. He praised the [...] "sublime genius" [...] of Wagner and saw some value {{in the work of}} other contemporary composers, for example Richard Strauss, Elgar, Mussorgsky, and Sibelius. By contrast, the Italian symphony was dominated by opera in an [...] "absurd and anti-musical form". The conservatories was said to encourage backwardness and mediocrity. The publishers perpetuated mediocrity and the domination of music by the [...] "rickety and vulgar" [...] operas of Puccini and Umberto Giordano. The only Italian Pratella could praise was his teacher Pietro Mascagni, because he had rebelled against the publishers and attempted innovation in opera, but even Mascagni was too traditional for Pratella's tastes. In the face of this mediocrity and conservatism, Pratella unfurled [...] "the red flag of Futurism, calling to its flaming symbol such young composers as have hearts to love and fight, minds to conceive, and brows free of cowardice." ...|$|E
