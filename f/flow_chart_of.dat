In the case of iMovie projects, scene selection menus were automatically created in accordance with chapter markers that were set within iMovie. The application also had a Media panel that provided access to the user's iTunes library, iPhoto library and Movies folder at any time. It also provided a map view, which showed a <b>flow</b> <b>chart</b> <b>of</b> the project's menu system. Another feature was the ability to hide or show an approximation of the 'TV-safe area' (as old televisions often cut off some of a video's outer areas). iDVD also incorporated a 'One-Step DVD' function, which would automatically rewind the currently connected DV camcorder and burn a DVD of the video footage stored on the tape.|$|E
