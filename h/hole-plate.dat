40|$|Although {{there are}} a number of {{existing}} assays for monitoring the activity of both isopenicillin N synthase (IPNS) and deacetoxycephalosporin C synthase (DAOCS), none have demonstrated the qualities required for screening a mutant library. Hence, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for IPNS and DAOCS were developed based on the detection of the catalytic turnover products isopenicillin N and cephalexin/phenylacetyl- 7 -aminodeacetoxycephalosporanic acid (G- 7 -ADCA), respectively. These assays are relatively fast compared to existing assays, such as the <b>hole-plate</b> bioassay, and are amenable with high-throughput screening. Both the IPNS and DAOCS-ELISAs were optimised for use with crude protein extracts rather than purified protein, thereby eliminating any additional time required for purification. The ELISA developed for the detection of cephalexin had an IC 50 value of 154 ± 9 ngmL− 1 and LOD of 7. 2 ± 2. 2 ngmL− 1 under conditions required for the assay. Good recoveries and correlation was observed for spiked samples when the concentration of crude protein was kept below 1 mgmL− 1. The DAOCS-ELISAwas found to have increased sensitivity compared to the <b>hole-plate</b> bioassay (10. 3 µgmL− 1). The IPNS-ELISA did not significantly increase the sensitivity (approximately 5 µgmL− 1) compared to that of the <b>hole-plate</b> bioassay (16 µgmL− 1) for isopenicillin N. The minimum amount of crude protein extract required for producing detectable amounts of product for both assays was below 0. 5 % of the maximum amount of protein that the assay could contain without any effect on the ELISA. This suggests that when screening a mutant library, mutants producing low amounts of the product could still be detected using these assays...|$|E

40|$|The {{need for}} finding {{fungicides}} against Fusarium {{is a key}} step in the chemical plant protection and using appropriate chemical agents. Existing, conventional methods of evaluation of Fusarium isolates resistance to fungicides are costly, time-consuming and potentially environmentally harmful due to usage of high amounts of potentially toxic chemicals. Therefore, the development of fast, accurate and effective detection methods for Fusarium resistance to fungicides is urgently required. MT 2 microplates (BiologTM) method is traditionally used for bacteria identification and the evaluation {{of their ability to}} utilize different carbon substrates. However, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, there is no reports concerning the use of this technical tool to determine fungicides resistance of the Fusarium isolates. For this reason, the objectives of this study are to develop a fast method for Fusarium resistance to fungicides detection and to validate the effectiveness approach between both traditional <b>hole-plate</b> and MT 2 microplates assays. In presented study MT 2 microplate-based assay was evaluated for potential use as an alternative resistance detection method. This was carried out using 3 commercially available fungicides, containing following active substances: triazoles (tebuconazole), benzimidazoles (carbendazim) and strobilurins (azoxystrobin), in 6 concentrations (0 %, 0. 0005 %, 0. 005 %, 0. 05 %, 0. 1 %, 0. 2 %), for nine selected Fusarium isolates. In this study, the particular concentrations of each fungicides was loaded into MT 2 microplate wells. The wells were inoculated with the Fusarium mycelium suspended in PM 4 -IF inoculating fluid. Before inoculation the suspension was standardized for each isolates into 75 % of transmittance. Traditional <b>hole-plate</b> method was used as a control assay. The fungicides concentrations in control method were the following: 0 %, 0. 0005 %, 0. 005 %, 0. 05 %, 0. 5 %, 1 %, 2 %, 5 %, 10 %, 25 % and 50 %. Strong relationships between MT 2 microplate and traditional <b>hole-plate</b> methods were observed regarding to the detection of Fusarium resistance to various fungicides and their concentrations. The tebuconazole was most potent, providing increased efficiency in the growth inhibition of all tested isolates. Almost all among tested isolates were resistant to azoxystrobin-based fungicide. Overall, the MT 2 microplates method was effective and timesaving, alternative method for determining Fusarium resistance/sensitivity to fungicides, compering to traditional <b>hole-plate</b> approach...|$|E

Neosartorya fischeri is the leading source of spoilage in thermally processed products. Its resistance to heat processing and toxigenicity makes studies about Neosartorya fischeri metabolism and chemical sensitivity essential. In this study chemical sensitivity of two environmental Neosartorya fischeri isolates were compared. One was isolated from canned apples in 1923 (DSM 3700), the other from thermal processed strawberry product in 2012 (KC 179765), used as long-stored and fresh isolate, respectively. The study was conducted using Biolog Phenotype MicroArray platforms of chemical sensitivity panel and traditional <b>hole-plate</b> method. The study allowed for obtaining data about Neosartorya fischeri growth inhibitors. The fresh isolate appeared to be much more resistant to chemical agents than the long-stored isolate. Based on phenotype microarray assay nitrogen compounds, toxic cations and membrane function compounds were the most effective in growth inhibition of N. fischeri isolates.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the chemical modification of polymer surfaces to confer various functionalities for controlled macroscopic functions, and in particular, photochromic activity and drug delivery. In this collaboration project, the first two years spent in Oxford placed emphasis on the development of a versatile synthetic route for surface modification of polymers with proof of concept. The next two years were spent at the Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology (SIMTech) for translational research, which involved the application of the processes developed in Oxford for large area surface engineering, and testing of the surface modified polymers. Different approaches to modify surface of polymer by chemical methods were investigated, and compared to analogous chemistry in solution. The best surface modification approach was then optimised to determine the most suitable system for translation. A library of polymers with variation in end group, and with expansion of substrate scope, was characterised in detail for chemical and macroscopic properties. In particular, drug delivery properties were investigated using <b>hole-plate</b> bioassays and HPLC-MS methods, and {{it was found that the}} antibiotic, Penicillin V, was still active after being loaded onto the polymer scaffolds, with surface modified polymers binding and releasing more drug than the corresponding controls. Incorporation of the spiropyran units on to the polymer surfaces also demonstrated good photochromic activities. With the transfer of the technology to SIMTech, surface modification processes were re-designed and tested on a variety of 2 D engineering polymers. Macroscopic function of photochromic activity, change in surface wettability and drug delivery were investigated. Lastly, a surprising finding on adhesion function generated from the diaryldiazo compound is disclosed, with preliminary results of lap-shear and t-peel tests showing high levels of adhesion.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the synthesis of chiral pyrrolidinone scaffolds as mimics of the natural product pramanicin, and the evaluation of their antibacterial properties for use towards the development of potential novel antibacterial lead compounds. Chapter 1 discusses the urgency of the antibiotic resistance problem as well as the current lack of new antibiotics in the drug pipeline. This dearth of new antibacterials is partly attributed to the combinatorial libraries used in the screening process which occupies a limited chemical space. By applying the natural product-inspired paradigm, it is hypothesised that a drug discovery process with a starting point based on a natural product, possessing intrinsic antibacterial properties, may provide insights to a novel class of antibacterials. Chapter 2 describes the synthesis of three different scaffolds of oxygenated pyrrolidinones via a common bicyclic intermediate synthesised from L-pyroglutamic acid. The use of a mild and facile epoxidation condition utilising H 2 O 2 /tertiary amine afforded the epoxypyrrolidinones. α-Hydroxylation with “Davis oxaziridine” and a Ru-mediated dihydroxylation gave 2 -hydroxypyrrolidinones and 2, 3 -dihydroxypyrrolidinones respectively. In all cases, a pendant Weinreb amide was used to introduce a variety of side-chains onto the parent pyrrolidinones. The enantioselective oxygenation of these scaffolds was accomplished {{as a result of the}} chiral [3. 3. 0] bicyclic intermediate. Chapter 3 describes the attempted synthesis of oxygenated pyrrolidinones via tetramic acids. Although progress was thwarted by synthetic challenges discussed therein, a series of tetramic acids was synthesised. A synthetic sequence to install a 3 -acyl moiety onto the parent tetramic acid core was accomplished via an O -acyl/ C -acyl rearrangement using a series of carboxylic acids in the presence of excess DMAP. The use of a 3 -acyltetramic acid with a pendant phosphorane permits a general synthetic route, compatible with a wide range of aldehydes, towards 3 -enoyltetramic acids via Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons olefination. These tetramic acids are mimics of another class of bactericidal natural products which nonetheless allows the natural product-inspired paradigm to be investigated. Finally, an analysis of the antibacterial properties of the synthesised compounds is discussed in Chapter 4. A cellular <b>hole-plate</b> bioassay with E. coli and S. aureus was chosen to provide a rapid assessment for active compounds. A correlation between the physicochemical properties and the observed activities of these active compounds suggested possible chemical modifications which could be undertaken in the future to improve their activities.

Chapter 1 explores methods and approaches to the discovery of new antibacterial drugs and the challenges faced in this respect. It also gives an overview of the properties of the natural products investigated in the following chapters and summarises previous synthetic approaches to these molecules published in the scientific literature. Chapter 2 describes the work carried out towards the synthesis of the diazabicyclo[3. 2. 1]octane unit of the tetrahydroisoquinoline antitumour antibiotic lemonomycin. The intended retrosynthesis of the natural product led to a 2, 5 -disubstituted pyrrolidine bearing a 1 ʹ-amino functional group; a series of routes were explored for the synthesis of this unit. Using (S) -pyroglutamic acid, strategies using Eschenmoser and thiolactim ether coupling reactions were investigated. A sequence based on the formation of a pyrrolidine ring from the cyclisation of an appropriately substituted oxime ether derived from L-phenylalanine was then implemented but a competing Beckmann rearrangement/Grob fragmentation prevented access to the desired heterocycle. Preliminary investigations were also carried out on the modification of cyclic imines derived from oxime ethers which did not undergo Beckmann rearrangement. Chapter 3 describes the synthesis of a library of densely functionalised tetramic acid and pyroglutamate mimics for the right-hand fragment of 16 -methyloxazolomycin, and their coupling with a gem-dimethylamide unit mimicking the middle fragment of the natural product. Tetramates were accessed through the Dieckmann cyclisation of N-acyloxazolidines and were derivatised with various alkyl halides. The pyroglutamates were accessed via the highly diastereoselective aldol cyclisation of N-acyloxazolidines formed by the amide coupling of a threonine derived oxazolidine and β-keto-acids. A series of β-keto-acids were synthesised through the acylation and subsequent ring-opening/decarboxylation reaction of Meldrum’s acid. The formation of right-hand/middle fragment adducts was explored using cycloaddition, alkylation and Sonogashira chemistry before a Wittig protocol {{led to the formation of}} adducts (E) - and (Z) - 402 and 403.

Chapter 1 discusses {{the need for new}} antibiotics due to the emergence of virulent bacterial strains resistant to clinically available drugs and the hiatus in the discovery of new replacement antibitoics that has become a global threat to human health. Different platforms for antibacterial drug discovery and the re-emergence of natural products-based approach that has gained importance in the quest for novel antibiotics are discussed. In this regard, the intrinsic antibacterial activity of natural products containing a tetramate core structure and the strategies developed to synthesise the core scaffold are described. Chapter 2 discusses the use of Ê-serine and Ê-cysteine in tetramic acid synthesis and the application of Ê-cysteine-derived thiazolidine templates suitable for stereoselective ring closing reactions to obtain the tetramic acid core with scope for further functionalization. Chapters 3 and 4 describe a range of synthetic routes for appropriate substitutions of the tetramate core for compound library generation. Elaboration of the tetramate core via carboxamide tetramate synthesis, Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions, glycosylations and their aglycone analogue synthesis, etherification, tetramate-pyroglutamate systems, Buchwald aminations/amidations, cycloadditions and Î²-lactam hybrids as possible chemical modifications of the tetramate core structure are discussed. Chapter 5 {{describes the}} antibacetiral activity and physicochemical properties of the library of compounds synthesised. A preliminary evaluation of their antibiotic activity was conducted against S. aureus and E. coli using the <b>hole-plate</b> method. MICs of the tetramates synthesised were determined against several Gram-negative strains; Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Gram-positive strains; MRSA, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pneumoniae, in whole-cell bioassays. Physicochemical properties of the compound library were analysed to map the chemical space occupied by tetramates with potent antibacterial activity. Enzyme inhibition studies were conducted to identify possible modes of action that contribute to whole-cell antibiotic activity and in this regard, the inhibition of enzymes S. aureus topoisomerase IV, S. aureus RNA polymerase, E. coli RNA polymerase, E. coli gyrase and M. tuberculosis gyrase are discussed. Since plasma protein binding of compounds is an important factor that determines the bioavailability of antibiotics and their clinical outcome, a study of the binding affinity of these drug candidates to Human Serum Albumin (HSA) by both whole-cell bioassay and NMR spectroscopy-based protein binding experiments are discussed.

40|$|Aboriginal {{communities}} in the northern Ontario region utilize an abundance of locally grown medicinal plants. However, no prior documentation or phytochemical studies on the northern Ontario medicinal plants existed in literature. This prompted me to exploit the ethnobotanical resources in this region towards the study of antibacterial bioactivity and alleviation of oxidative stress. Oxidative stress plays {{a fundamental role in}} the pathogenesis of many major human illnesses, such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and Alzheimer?s syndrome. Also, infectious diseases are a major concern in our society due to the advent of multiple drug resistant strains of bacteria that cause millions of mortalities worldwide. From the accumulated list of 48 northern Ontario medicinal plants, I selected 21 plants based on their documented anticancer, antibacterial, antioxidant, antidiarrheal and anti-inflammatory properties. These plants were separated into leaf, flower, stem and root tissues and extracted with ethanol. In total, 43 extracts were assayed for antioxidant and antibacterial activity in this study. The antioxidant activity was evaluated through the DPPH (2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl), ABTS (2, 2 '-azino-bis(3 -ethylbenzothiazoline- 6 -sulphonic acid) diammonium salt), ORAC (Oxygen radical absorption capacity), and EC 50 (half maximal effective concentration) assays. The total phenolic content of medicinal plants was also determined. The antibacterial activity was determined through the <b>hole-plate</b> diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assays on Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Mycobacterium avium subsp. avium, Paenibacillus alvei and Aeromonas caviae bacteria. The crude extract was fractionated through manual liquid chromatography (LC) into five fractions of varying polarity using a mixture of hexane: ethyl acetate: methanol solvents and assayed for inhibitory activity in the MIC assay. Also, a few plants were shortlisted and studied for more detailed antibacterial activity through minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) and time-kill analyses. In the antioxidant assays, all plant extracts exhibit some level of activity, however, a few were exceptional. The extracts of Cornus canadensis, Ledum palustre, Prunella vulgaris, Arctostaphylos uva-ursi, and Apocynum androsaemifolium L. from the Cornaceae, Lamiaceae, Ericaceae and Apocynaceae families, respectively, display the highest antioxidant activity and total phenolic contents. In the antibacterial assays, plants from the Asteraceae, Apocynaceae, Cornaceae and Ericaceae families display the highest activity. Particularly, the leaf and/ or flower extracts of Xanthium strumarium, Anaphalis margaritacea, Arctostaphylos uva-ursi, Apocynum androsaemifolium L., Cornus canadensis, Solidago canadensis and Grindelia squarrosa exhibit high inhibition diameters and low MIC values. Also, for the majority of extracts, an increase in bioactivity was observed in the medium polarity LC fraction, relative to the crude. Particularly, the medium polarity fraction of Anap. margaritacea flower exhibits MIC values in the range of 0. 08 - 1. 25 mg/ml against all six bacteria tested. The crude extract of Anaphalis margaritacea flower also displays MBC values in the range of 0. 16 - 5 mg/ml against A. caviae, M. luteus, P. alvei and B. cereus bacterium and demonstrates complete extermination within eight hours of incubation. Overall, this investigation provides evidence for the application of these medicinal plants towards the treatment of infectious and oxidative stress related diseases in Native Aboriginal communities...|$|E
