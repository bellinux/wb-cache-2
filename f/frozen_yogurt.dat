5|$|Hershey Creamery Company, {{also known}} as Hershey's Ice Cream, is a creamery that {{produces}} Hershey's brand ice cream, sorbet, sherbet, and <b>frozen</b> <b>yogurt,</b> and other frozen treats such as smoothies and frozen slab style ice cream mixers. Founded by Jacob Hershey and four of his brothers in 1894 (all of whom have no relation to Milton S. Hershey and the chocolate company that he founded, also in 1894), it {{was taken over by}} the Holder family in the 1920s. The company {{was one of the first}} to offer consumers pre-packaged ice cream pints. In 1998, it modernized its operations to increase efficiency and reduce overhead. With their shared names and cities of origin, Hershey Creamery and Hershey Company have had a tumultuous relationship marked by multiple lawsuits over trademark issues. In the mid-1990s, the companies settled their most recent legal battles out of court, with the creamery agreeing to add a disclaimer to its ice cream products to note that it is not affiliated with The Hershey Company.|$|E

Cable television later grew to provide the same variety.

500|$|Shortly after this, Hershey Creamery {{expanded}} its trademark to include other ice cream products: [...] "ice cream, ice milk, sherbet, water ice, and frozen confections in which ice cream, ice milk, sherbet or water ice is a component". In 1989, the creamery {{expanded its}} products to include <b>frozen</b> <b>yogurt</b> and filed {{for a new}} trademark for this new line of products. Upon learning of the registration request, the Hershey Company—then named Hershey Foods—demanded the company cease production of the products claiming it violated Hershey Company's trademarks. The creamery dropped its application, but continued releasing the products, so in May 1990, Hershey Company filed suit in the Middle District court of Pennsylvania seeking a legal injunction to stop Hershey Creamery from producing and marketing its Hershey's branded <b>frozen</b> <b>yogurt,</b> {{as well as to}} attempt to stop the company from using the [...] "Hershey's" [...] trademark outside of its [...] "traditional thirteen-state trading area" [...] and to demand that the company include a disclaimer disavowing its relation to Hershey Company on all of its products. Hershey Creamery counter sued in the New York South District court, concerned that Hershey Company demands reneged on the 1967 settlement, and requested the Pennsylvania court actions be transferred to the New York court as that was where the settlement was originally handled. The request was denied and the court instead blocked the Hershey Creamery's suit in New York. The Creamery appealed but this was denied.|$|E
40|$|Background: Obesity is {{becoming}} an increasingly prevalent problem in Pakistan, {{as it has in}} other developing countries. Childhood obesity poses high cost to the well-being and negatively affects children's health, causes chronic disease as children grow older. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore nutritional status, physical activity and body mass index (BMI) of school and college going students of mid and late adolescence age (14 to 19 years) studying in multi-ethnic city of Karachi, Pakistan. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out among school and college going students of public and private educational institutes of Karachi, Pakistan. The study sample of 171 students was conveniently selected from these institutes. The data was collected through a semi-structured questionnaire. In order to calculate BMI, the height and weight of each student were measured after completion of the questionnaire. The data were entered and analysed using IBM SPSS version for Windows 20. 0 software. Results: The average age of the respondents was 16. 2 years with 68 % students belonged to school and 32 % to College, and 57. 3 % were males and 42. 7 % were females. More than half sample (59. 6 %) participants belonged to privileged and 40. 4 % to underprivileged class. The sample was eating a wide variety of junk food in daily routine including chips, packed fruit juices, packed flavoured milk, ice creams/ <b>frozen</b> <b>yogurts</b> both at home and at school/college. The physical activity of the school students was found to be better than the college students. No participant had regular activity or strenuous physical games for more than one hour per day. Around one third (38 %) respondents used to watch TV or play computer games for more than two hours a day. Almost half of the students' BMI was within the normal ranges, but remaining half of the sample was either overweight or underweight. Conclusions: This study indicates that a large proportion of school and college students had physical inactivity, unhealthy dietary habits and they were overweight. All these interrelated factors were independent of their household socioeconomic condition and ethnicity. There is a need to educate and create awareness about healthy lifestyle among the adolescents and the community at large. [Int J Res Med Sci 2016; 4 (8. 000) : 3563 - 3569...|$|R
