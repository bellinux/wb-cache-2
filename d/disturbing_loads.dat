40|$|Many {{definitions}} {{have been}} formulated to represent nonactive power for distorted voltages and currents in electronic and electrical systems. Unfortunately, no single universally suitable representation {{has been accepted}} as a prototype for this power component. This paper defines a nonactive power multivector from the most advanced multivectorial power theory based on the geometric algebra (GA). The new concept can have more importance on harmonic loads compensation, identification, and metering, between other applications. Likewise, this paper is concerned with a pioneering method for the compensation of <b>disturbing</b> <b>loads.</b> In this way, we propose a multivectorial relative quality index[*][*] associated with the power multivector. It can be assumed as a new index for power quality evaluation, harmonic sources detection, and power factor improvement in residential and commercial buildings. The proposed method consists of a single-point strategy based of a comparison among different relative quality index multivectors, which may be measured at the different loads on the same metering point. The comparison can give pieces of information with magnitude, direction, and sense {{on the presence of}} <b>disturbing</b> <b>loads.</b> A numerical example is used to illustrate the clear capabilities of the suggested approach...|$|E
40|$|A device {{has been}} {{developed}} to measure the harmonic impedances of power network by using harmonic voltage and current increments {{at the point of}} common coupling between the network and a <b>disturbing</b> <b>load.</b> The key problem in the implementation of the method is the synchronization of phasors sampled asynchronously and at different times. This kind of synchronization is linked to the frequency measurement. A small error in the frequency will cause a great deviation of the impedance measurement. A formulation is given here to evaluate the error on the impedance in each individual measurement (event), and a statistical method is proposed to achieve a relatively high accuracy in the source impedance estimation. Laboratory and field tests results are both discussed as well as verified with the harmonic emission level estimation of the <b>disturbing</b> <b>load.</b> SCOPUS: cp. pinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

The {{problem has been}} usually solved with indirect control strategies that work through the input current. In this article, we report a robust control methodology that uses Galerkin-based sliding manifolds, which use full state reference profiles and {{an estimate of the}} <b>disturbed</b> <b>load</b> parameter. The sliding surface incorporates a first-order Galerkin approximation of the input current that provides robustness to piecewise constant load perturbations by dynamic compensation: it allows on-line accommodation to the action of the load estimator.

Field measurements and theoretical studies suggest that the industrial loads containing large proportions of induction motors assist in attenuating flicker compared to residential loads consisting ofpassive devices. This paper describes a frequency domain approach which can be used to determine the propagation ofvoltagefluctuations when there are induction motor loads {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>disturbing</b> <b>load.</b> The method involves linearization of the network in d-q domain to evaluate various voltage transfer coefficients.

The control algorithms based on the proportional-derivative controller have been applied to a specially designed two-channel electro-hydraulic servo system, which {{has the capacity to}} experimentally simulate common circumstances of a typical fluid power circuit. The first system includes the positioning hydraulic cylinder controlled using the proportional valve, a displacement measuring system and a control device in a closed-loop system. In order to add further realism in the control system a second double acting hydraulic cylinder is used to generate the <b>disturbing</b> <b>load.</b> The effectiveness of the proposed control algorithms is demonstrated for both moving directions as well as for both unloaded and loaded system.

40|$|This {{computational}} work investigates {{planetary gear}} load sharing of three-mount suspension wind turbine gearboxes. A three dimensional multibody dynamic model is established, including gravity, bending moments, fluctuating mesh stiffness, nonlinear tooth contact, and bearing clearance. A flexible main shaft, planetary carrier, housing, and gear shafts are modeled using reduced degrees-of-freedom through modal compensation. This drivetrain model is validated against the experimental data of Gearbox Reliability Collaborative for gearbox internal loads. Planet load sharing is a combined effect of gravity, bending moment, bearing clearance, and input torque. Influences {{of each of}} these parameters and their combined effects on the resulting planet load sharing are investigated. Bending moments and gravity induce fundamental excitations in the rotating carrier frame, which can increase gearbox internal <b>loads</b> and <b>disturb</b> <b>load</b> sharing. Clearance in carrier bearings reduces the bearing load carrying capacity and thus the bending moment from the rotor can be transmitted into gear meshes. With bearing clearance, the bending moment can cause tooth micropitting and can induce planet bearing fatigue, leading to reduced gearbox life. Planet bearings are susceptible to skidding at low input torque...|$|R
