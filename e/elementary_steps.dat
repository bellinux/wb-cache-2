2500|$|Van 't Hoff studied {{chemical}} {{dynamics and}} published in 1884 his famous [...] "Etudes de dynamique chimique". In 1901 he was awarded by the first Nobel Prize in Chemistry [...] "in recognition of the extraordinary services he has rendered by {{the discovery of the}} laws of chemical dynamics and osmotic pressure in solutions". After van 't Hoff, chemical kinetics deals with the experimental determination of reaction rates from which rate laws and rate constants are derived. Relatively simple rate laws exist for zero order reactions (for which reaction rates are independent of concentration), first order reactions, and second order reactions, and can be derived for others. Elementary reactions follow the law of mass action, but the rate law of stepwise reactions has to be derived by combining the rate laws of the various <b>elementary</b> <b>steps,</b> and can become rather complex. In consecutive reactions, the rate-determining step often determines the kinetics. In consecutive first order reactions, a steady state approximation can simplify the rate law. The activation energy for a reaction is experimentally determined through the Arrhenius equation and the Eyring equation. The main factors that influence the reaction rate include: the physical state of the reactants, the concentrations of the reactants, the temperature at which the reaction occurs, and whether or not any catalysts are present in the reaction.|$|E

40|$|Complex {{reaction}} kinetics {{of the solid}} acid alkylation of isobutane with butenes over a proton-exchanged Y-zeolite has been modeled at the <b>elementary</b> <b>step</b> level. Starting with a computer algorithm that generated the reaction network based on the fundamentals of the carbenium ion chemistry, the formation of over 100 + product species has been modeled {{in order to gain}} understanding of the underlying phenomena leading to rapid catalyst deactivation and product selectivity shifts observed in experimental runs. An experimental investigation of the solid acid alkylation process was carried out in a fixed bed catalytic reactor operating with an excess of isobutane under isothermal conditions at moderate temperatures (353 - 393 K) in liquid phase. Experimental data varying with run-time for a set of butene space-times and reaction temperatures were collected for parameter estimation purposes. A kinetic model was formulated in terms of rate expressions at the <b>elementary</b> <b>step</b> level including a rigorous modeling of deactivation through site coverage. The single event concept was applied to each rate coefficient at the <b>elementary</b> <b>step</b> level to achieve a significant {{reduction in the number of}} model parameters. Based on the identification of structural changes leading to the creation or destruction of symmetry axes and chiral centers in an <b>elementary</b> <b>step,</b> formulae have been developed for the calculation of the number of single events. The Evans-Polanyi relationship and the concept of stabilization energy were introduced to account for energy levels in surface-bonded carbenium ions. A novel functional dependency of the stabilization energy with the nature of the carbenium ion and the carbon number was proposed to account for energy effects from the acid sites on the catalyst. Further reductions in the number of parameters and simplification of the equations for the transient pseudohomogeneous one-dimensional plug-flow model of the reactor were achieved by means of thermodynamic constraints. Altogether, the single event concept, the Evans-Polanyi relationship, the stabilization energy approach and the thermodynamic constraints led to a set of 14 parameters necessary for a complete description of solid acid alkylation at the <b>elementary</b> <b>step</b> level...|$|R

In the presence of TBT-Cl, the consecutive rotation of V 1 paused for a long duration (∼ 0. 5 s), even at saturated ATP concentrations, and the pausing positions were localized at 120 ° intervals. Analysis of both the pausing time and moving time revealed that TBT-Cl has little effect on the binding affinity for ATP, but, rather, it arrests the catalytic event(s).

40|$|The {{frequent}} simple gross {{redox reaction}} notation, where A {{is a solution}} species and Bads is its adsorbed reduction product, is misleading in its simplicity. It may represent a concerted reaction, i. e., a true <b>elementary</b> <b>step</b> in which the electron transfer (ET) to the solution species A is concerted {{with the creation of}} the electrode-species bond(s) in Bads. Conversely, the reaction may be a composite one involving two sequential steps. One such two-step mechanism may be termed as a CadsEads sequence where Cads stands for a pre-adsorption <b>elementary</b> <b>step</b> and Eads for the follow-up ET. Alternatively, the two steps may proceed in the reverse order, leading to an EsolnCads mechanism in which A is reduced into B, both being solution species, followed by adsorption of B onto the electrode. The present theoretical investigations show that a different panel of voltammetric behaviours may be produced by each mechanism. Hence, rationalising voltammetric peak positions and shapes in terms of surface or potential effects is challenging and may be completely erroneous if the wrong mechanistic sequence is considered. © 2014 Taylor & Francis...|$|R
