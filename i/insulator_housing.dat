40|$|To {{reduce the}} risk imposed by use of {{defected}} composite insulators on the operation of power grids, this paper introduces a nondestructive ultrasonic phased array (UPA) technique that allows effectively test such insulators. The method offers a great potential by reducing inspection {{time as well as}} allowing for analyzing components characterized by a complex geometry. The UPA inspection system utilizes an open-ended rectangular waveguide sensor, operating at frequency of 2. 5 MHz. The system is simple, safe and relatively inexpensive. In this work, samples of silicone rubber composite insulators with various types of detects are studied and the obtained results show that void defects in the bulk of the <b>insulator</b> <b>housing</b> are easiest to be detected. Holes under insulator sheds can also be detected by the edge of scanning range. For the defects near the core-shed interface, the detection becomes possible by comparisons with sample without defects...|$|E
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} how {{the texture of the}} {{silicone}} rubber material affects the distribution of microbial growth on the surface of materials used for high voltage insulation. The analysis of surface wetting properties showed that the textured surfaces provide higher receding contact angles and therefore lower contact angle hysteresis. The textured surfaces decrease the risk for dry band formation and thus preserve the electrical properties of the material due to a more homogeneous distribution of water on the surface, which, however, promotes the formation of more extensive biofilms. The samples were inoculated with fungal suspension and incubated in a microenvironment chamber simulating authentic conditions in the field. The extent and distribution of microbial growth on the textured and plane surface samples representing the different parts of the <b>insulator</b> <b>housing</b> that is shank and shed were determined by visual inspection and image analysis methods. The results showed that the microbial growth was evenly distributed {{on the surface of the}} textured samples but restricted to limited areas on the plane samples. More intensive microbial growth was determined on the textured samples representing sheds. It would therefore be preferable to use the textured surface silicone rubber for the shank of the insulator...|$|E
40|$|Advanced RTG {{concepts}} utilizing improved thermoelectric {{materials and}} converter concepts are under study at Fairchild for DOE. The design described here {{is based on}} DOE's newly developed radioisotope heat source, and on an improved silicon-germanium material and a multicouple converter module under development at Syncal. Fairchild's assignment was to combine the above into an attractive power system for use in space, and to assess the specific power and other attributes of that design. The resultant design is highly modular, consisting of standard RTG slices, each producing ~ 24 watts at the desired output voltage of 28 volt. Thus, the design could be adapted to various space missions {{over a wide range}} of power levels, with little or no redesign. Each RTG slice consists of a 250 -watt heat source module, eight multicouple thermoelectric modules, and standard sections of <b>insulator,</b> <b>housing,</b> radiator fins, and electrical circuit. The design makes it possible to check each thermoelectric module for electrical performance, thermal contact, leaktightness, and performance stability, after the generator is fully assembled; and to replace any deficient modules without disassembling the generator or perturbing the others. The RTG end sections provide the spring-loaded supports required to hold the free-standing heat source stack together during launch vibration. Details analysis indicates that the design offers a substantial improvement in specific power over the present generator of RTGs, using the same heat source modules. There are three copies in the file...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of polymeric materials for outdoor insulation {{has been much}} aided by existing standard laboratory tests such as inclined-plane procedures. The position is less satisfactory in respect of the optimization of insulator profiles and {{the choice of the}} minimum unified specific creepage distance (USCD) for a given site pollution severity (SPS). Standard tests currently under revision are stated to be 'not directly applicable to polymeric insulators'. Such tests are, therefore, urgently needed to discriminate the pollution performance of silicone-rubber <b>insulators</b> of different <b>housing</b> materials and profiles, to quantify the inverse relationship of pollution severity and flashover voltage and to assess the influence of wetting rate. A suitable test strategy would also avoid housing damage from excessive flashovers. A new test procedure is presented here to achieve these objectives. This is not confined to flashover voltage measurements. A high-resolution data acquisition system is used to monitor and store the waveforms of the applied test voltage and leakage current throughout tests on 11 kV silicone-rubber insulators. This enhancement provides a further basis for the quantitative comparison of insulators in artificial pollution testing, because the results corroborate the inverse relationship between flashover voltage and pre-flashover leakage current. Part 2 demonstrates the pollution performance of 11 kV silicone-rubber insulators when surface texturing is used to increase USCD values...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. In {{the last}} 10 - 15 years a {{dominant}} {{position in the}} market of medium voltage circuit breakers, vacuum circuit breakers have taken in which as an actuator mono- or bistable actuators with permanent magnets are used. Such circuit breakers are characterized by simplicity of design, high reliability, require preventive maintenance for many years. Development, research and improvement of vacuum circuit breakers are carried out at the Department for Electrical Apparatus, National Technical University «Kharkiv Polytechnic Institute». While working on the circuit breakers, developers {{have to deal with}} two related objectives – electrical and mechanical. This paper considers the solution of one of these problems – calculation of mechanical forces in the drive shaft of the vacuum circuit breaker in static and dynamic modes. This work was preceded by the failure of the results of measurements of the prototype circuit breakers’ contacts. Measurements have shown that these values do not match the expected values (there were less than the value of 0. 8 to 1 mm). The assumption about the reasons for this discrepancy needed to be detailed checked. The results of the work done are presented in this paper. Purpose. Investigation of static and dynamic mechanical stresses and strains in the drive shaft of the vacuum circuit breaker mechanism to determine its characteristics and material selection. Methods. The investigation of mechanical processes is performed by the finite element method in the COMSOL software package. Results. We obtain the static and dynamic characteristics of the circuit breaker drive shaft: deformations, reaction forces, stresses. These characteristics made it possible to determine the actual course of the contacts, select shaft material and calculate the forces acting on the bearings. Conclusions. It is shown that the contact velocity and contact pressure are different from the theoretical value due to the deformation of the shaft. The forces acting on the thrust bearings dynamically are by 16 - 39 % higher than the static ones. It is assumed that further refinement of the mathematical model takes into account the traction <b>insulators</b> and <b>housing,</b> as well as dynamics of the circuit breaker...|$|R
40|$|Electric {{thrusters}} typically {{require a}} power processing unit (PPU) {{to convert the}} spacecraft-provided power to the voltage and current that a thruster needs for operation. NASA Marshall Space Flight Center has initiated fundamental studies on whether an arcjet thruster can be operated directly with the power produced by solar arrays without any additional conversion. Elimination of the PPU significantly reduces system-level complexity of the propulsion system, and lowers developmental cost and risk. The proposed work will aim to refine the proof-of-concept presently being assembled and begin to identify and address technical questions related to power conditioning and noise suppression in the system, and heating of the thruster in long-duration operation. The apparatus proposed for investigation has a target power level of 400 to 1, 000 W. The proposed direct-drive arcjet is potentially a highly scalable concept, applicable to spacecraft with up to hundreds of kilowatts and beyond. The design of the arcjet built for this effort was based on previous low power (1 kW class) arcjets. 1 - 3 It has a precision machined 99. 95 % pure tungsten anode that also serves as the nozzle with a 0. 040 -in- (1 -mm-) diameter, 0. 040 -in-long constrictor region.

The work aims to identify and address technical questions related to power conditioning and noise suppression {{in the system and}} heating of the thruster in long-duration operation. The apparatus under investigation has a target power level from 400 - 1, 000 W. However, the proposed direct-drive arcjet is potentially a highly scalable concept, applicable to solar-electric spacecraft with up to 100 's of kW and beyond. A direct-drive electric propulsion system would be comprised of a thruster that operates with the power supplied directly from the power source (typically solar arrays) with no further power conditioning needed between those two components. Arcjet thrusters are electric propulsion devices, with the power supplied as a high current at low voltage; of all the different types of electric thruster, they are best suited for direct drive from solar arrays. One advantage of an arcjet over Hall or gridded ion thrusters is that for comparable power the arcjet is a much smaller device and can provide more thrust and orders of magnitude higher thrust density (approximately 1 - 10 N/sq m), albeit at lower I(sub sp) (approximately 800 - 1000 s). In addition, arcjets are capable of operating {{on a wide range of}} propellant options, having been demonstrated on H 2, ammonia, N 2, Ar, Kr, Xe, while present SOA Hall and ion thrusters are primarily limited to Xe propellant. Direct-drive is often discussed in terms of Hall thrusters, but they require 250 - 300 V for operation, which is difficult even with high-voltage solar arrays. The arcjet requires under 100 V, which is more in-line with what is easily possible with a solar array. Direct-drive of an electric propulsion system confers the advantage of reducing or eliminating the power processing unit (PPU) that is typically needed to convert the spacecraft-provided power to the voltage and current needed for thruster operation. Since the PPU is typically the most expensive piece of an electric thruster system, from both a fabrication and qualification standpoint, its elimination offers the potential for major reductions in system cost and risk. The design of the arcjet built for this effort was based on previous low power (1 kW class) arcjets. It has a precision machined 99. 95 % pure tungsten anode which also serves as the nozzle. The anode constrictor region is 1 mm (0. 040 -in) diameter and 1 mm (0. 040 -in) long. The cathode is a tungsten welding electrode doped with LaO 2; its tip was precision ground to a 30 angle ending in a blunt end.

The gas seals were made using Grafoil gaskets. Figure 1 A shows the assembled thruster in the vacuum chamber; figure 1 B shows the thruster in operation on argon at a flow rate of 676 sccm (20 mg/s). Initial testing was conducted in a 3. 5 -ft diameter vacuum chamber; the ultimate pressure reached during quasi-steady operation of the thruster was about 330 millitorr. The thruster was powered with a high-current, 0 - 100 A, 15 kW power supply. The discharge was initiated with a high-voltage (approximately 10 kV) spark initiator that was isolated from the supply by a stack of diodes. The testing indicated that an operating point exists within the I-V characteristics that is compatible with direct-drive solar-electric operation; for a flow rate of 20 mg/s (argon) the arc could be sustained at a voltage of about 20 V and a current of 25 A (500 W) ...|$|R
