2500|$|In an {{interview}} with New York magazine, Hersh made {{a distinction between the}} standards of strict factual accuracy for his print reporting and the leeway he allows himself in speeches, in which he may talk informally about stories still being worked on or blur information to protect his sources. [...] "Sometimes I change events, dates, and places in a certain way to protect people. ... I can't fudge what I write. But <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>certainly</b> fudge what I say." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Mandisa {{presented}} {{herself to}} the judges prior to the final cut-down to the season's 24 semi-finalists, she told Cowell: [...] "What I {{want to say to}} you is that, yes, you hurt me and I cried and it was painful, it really was. But I {{want you to know that}} I've forgiven you and that you don't need someone to apologize in order to forgive somebody. I figure that if Jesus could die so that all of my wrongs could be forgiven, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>certainly</b> extend that same grace to you." [...] Cowell told Mandisa that he was [...] "humbled" [...] and apologized to her immediately.|$|E
2500|$|Kojima {{also said}} about her clothing, [...] "Once {{you see how}} she fits into the story, you will {{understand}} why she looks the way she does. Without any of this background <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>certainly</b> understand why there are concerns. I will say there’s a reason she looks the way she does and wears those clothes. And it’s all {{a part of the}} game, learning those reasons one by one." [...] Joosten herself was surprised with the controversy, but said [...] "When I got to see her design, I was shocked too. But everybody didn’t get to hear her story yet so I can understand people are angry about it or saying she is showing too much. But I am not bothered by it.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Thank you, I shall {{enjoy it}} very much if <b>I</b> <b>can</b> get away. <b>I</b> have my doubts whether I shall be able to; but if <b>I</b> <b>can,</b> <b>I</b> will <b>certainly</b> avail myself of your offer.' ...|$|R

2500|$|After the 1886 season Spalding sold Kelly to the Boston Beaneaters for a then-record $10,000, after Kelly {{balked at}} {{returning}} to the club. Right before the sale, Chicago writer Happy Palmer quoted Spalding about his plans to manage Kelly: [...] "Oh, tie him up, I guess, if he really is averse to playing here. He may have his ugly up, and I guess {{from the way he}} is holding out in his refusal to sign that that is the case. All right, though. I am willing, and if he keeps on in that spirit I’ll make him eat hay with his horses before he is much older. He has been mad long enough now, and it is pretty near time somebody was getting mad at this end of the line. One thing <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>certainly</b> predict and that is that if Mr. Mike Kelly does not sign a contract with Chicago pretty d--d quick, he will have cause to regret it. That is all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Something like that! <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>certainly</b> {{make things}} awkward. However, all I {{want is to}} go with you when you open the lazaret where the boxes of gold were stored." ...|$|E
60|$|Either, methinks, 'plays' {{should be}} 'play'd,' or 'and' {{should be changed}} to 'while.' <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>certainly</b> {{understand}} it as a parenthesis, an interadditive of scorn; {{but it does not}} sound to my ear as in Shakspeare's manner.|$|E
6000|$|... "Humph! Faith, my {{grandmother}} was an actress; and we St. Justs are none the worse for that fact, as far as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> see,--and <b>certainly</b> none the uglier--the women at least. Oh Sabina--Mrs. Mellot, I mean--only help me this once!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot {{recognize}} him, your excellency," [...] Francis said; [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> say <b>certainly</b> {{that he was}} not {{the leader}} of the party, whom I struck with my oar. The blow fell on the temple, and assuredly there would be marks of such a blow remaining today." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Mr Archer, <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>can</b> suggest nothing better," [...] the {{lieutenant}} said. [...] "Will you go up, then, and, get the cloaks you speak of?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Miss Fosbrook kissed her, saying, [...] "My dear little girl, I cannot tell. All <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>certainly</b> {{tell you}} is, that He hears {{the prayers of}} good children, and if it be better for her and for you He will give her back to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not in the least. The {{young lady}} {{seems to have}} been left by her father and step-mother without any engagement, and, indeed, without any provision. She was brought here, in the first place, from sheer charity, and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>certainly</b> {{understand}} that when she was here Mr Whittlestaff should have admired her." ...|$|E
6000|$|And so he did. [...] "This {{is a sad}} business, Charles," [...] says my lord to me, {{after seeing}} his son, and {{settling}} himself down in our salong. [...] "Have you any segars in the house? And hark ye, send me up {{a bottle of wine}} and some luncheon. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>certainly</b> not leave the neighborhood of my dear boy." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Prohibited! nonsense! <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>can</b> get {{out that}} way, and I will. Mr. Rushworth {{will be here}} in a moment, you know; we shall not be out of sight." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll do what <b>I</b> <b>can</b> for you, <b>certainly,</b> Mr. Crewe," [...] he said. [...] "But--what is {{to become}} of the other four hundred and ninety-nine? The ways of a Speaker are hard, Mr. Crewe, and I have {{to do justice to}} all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{think that}} {{that will be a}} very good plan, Major. Two of the men who act as {{hospital}} orderlies <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>certainly</b> depend upon, and they will help to receive the things sent in from the bungalows, and will hold their tongues as to what is being done; I shall leave my tent standing, and use it occasionally as before, but will make the courthouse my headquarters. How are we off for arms?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nay, as for me,' said Summertrees, 'I {{will tell}} you the truth at once, and fairly own that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>certainly</b> find you the means of seeing Redgauntlet, poor man; and that I will do, if you require it, and conjure him also to treat you as your errand requires; but poor Redgauntlet is much changed--indeed, to say truth, his temper never was the best in the world; however, I will warrant you from any very great danger.' ...|$|E
60|$|My brother's farm {{is but a}} wretched lease, but I {{think he}} will {{probably}} weather out the remaining seven years of it; and after the assistance which I have given, and will give him, to keep the family together, I think, by my guess, I shall have rather better than two hundred pounds, and instead of seeking, what is almost impossible at present to find, a farm that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>certainly</b> live by, with so small a stock, I shall lodge this sum in a banking-house, a sacred deposit, excepting only the calls of uncommon distress or necessitous old age.|$|E
6000|$|... "That doesn't worry me," [...] Francis declared. [...] "I don't {{need the}} fees, fortunately, and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> always pick up enough {{work to keep}} me going by {{attending}} Sessions. One thing <b>I</b> <b>can</b> promise you--I <b>certainly</b> shall not sit in my rooms and wait for things to happen. Mine is a militant spirit and it needs the outlet of action." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As to Gifford, I am {{surprised}} at their conduct towards him, although I {{know better than}} most men of what wood a minister is made, and how much reliance may be placed upon the gratitude of a party: but Canning; from <b>Canning</b> <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> did expect different conduct." ...|$|R
5000|$|Thus I plainly {{see that}} the {{certainty}} and truth of all my knowledge derives from one thing: my thought of the true God. Before I knew Him, I couldn't know anything else perfectly. But now <b>I</b> <b>can</b> plainly and <b>certainly</b> know innumerable things, not only about God and other mental beings, {{but also about the}} nature of physical objects, insofar as it is the subject-matter of pure mathematics. Descartes ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am heartily {{glad to see}} you, Colonel O'Connor," [...] {{the latter}} said. [...] "Of course, I {{have heard of the}} doings of your battalions; and am glad, indeed, to have your support. I sent a {{messenger}} off, only this morning, to Sir Arthur; telling him that, from the information brought in by my spies, I am convinced that Soult is much stronger than has been supposed; and that, if he moves south, I shall scarce be able to hold the passes of Arenas and San Pedro Barnardo; and that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>certainly</b> spare no men for the defence of the more westerly ones, by which Soult is likely to march from Salamanca. However, now you are there, I shall feel safe." ...|$|E
60|$|I am {{not about}} to trouble you with my autobiography; the omens are hardly favourable, at present, for work of that kind. But I should like if I may do so without appearing, what I earnestly desire not to be, egotistical,--I should like {{to make it clear}} to you, that such notions as these, which are {{sometimes}} attributed to me, are, as I have said, inconsistent with my mental constitution, and still more inconsistent with the upshot of the teaching of my experience. For <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>certainly</b> claim for myself that sort of mental temperament which can say that nothing human comes amiss to it. I have never yet met with any branch of human knowledge which I have found unattractive--which {{it would not have been}} pleasant to me to follow, so far as I could go; and I have yet to meet with any form of art in which it has not been possible for me to take as acute a pleasure as, I believe, it is possible for men to take.|$|E
60|$|Yet even if {{this theory}} were correct, was the second mate wholly {{answerable}} for beginning his life again with the imposture he had practiced? The contributor had either so {{fallen in love with}} the literary advantages of his forlorn deceiver that he would see no moral obliquity in him, or he had touched a subtler verity at last in pondering the affair. It seemed now no longer a farce, but had a pathos which, though very different from that of its first aspect, was hardly less tragical. Knowing with what coldness, or, at the best, uncandor, he (representing Society in its attitude toward convicted Error) would have met the fact had it been owned to him at first, he had not virtue enough to condemn the illusory stranger, who must have been helpless to make at once evident any repentance he felt or good purpose he cherished. Was it not one of the saddest consequences of the man's past,--a dark necessity of misdoing,-- that, even with the best will in the world to retrieve himself, his first endeavor must involve a wrong? Might he not, indeed, be considered a martyr, in some sort, to his own admirable impulses? I can see clearly enough where the contributor was astray in this reasoning, but I can also understand how one accustomed to value realities only as they resembled fables should be won with such pensive sophistry; and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>certainly</b> sympathize with his feeling that the mariner's failure to reappear according to appointment added its final and most agreeable charm to the whole affair, and completed the mystery from which the man emerged and which swallowed him up again.|$|E
5000|$|Explaining the {{potential}} {{appeal of the}} character, he said, [...] "I think everyone {{is sort of like}} Jonathan. Either they're like Jonathan or they're trying to cover up their Jonathan qualities. Either they're awkward and shy, or they're doing everything they can not to appear awkward and shy. I'm not really very shy, but <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>can</b> be awkward at times." ...|$|R

60|$|If {{there be}} more than one opinion among men {{elsewhere}} concerning the means by which Austria acquired Venetia and the tenure by which she holds the province, there would certainly seem to be no division on the question in Venice. To the stranger first inquiring into public feeling, there is something almost sublime in the unanimity with which the Venetians appear to believe that these means were iniquitous, and that this tenure is abominable; and though shrewder study and carefuler observation will develop some interested attachment to the present government, and some interested opposition of it; though after-knowledge will discover, in the hatred of Austria, enough meanness, lukewarmness, and selfish ignorance to take off its sublimity, the hatred is still found marvelously unanimous and bitter. I speak advisedly, and with no disposition to discuss the question or exaggerate the fact. Exercising at Venice official functions by permission and trust of the Austrian government, I cannot regard the cessation of those functions as release from obligations both to that government and my own, which render it improper for me, so long as the Austrians remain in Venice, to criticize their rule, or contribute, by comment on existing things, to embitter the feeling against them elsewhere. I may, nevertheless, speak dispassionately of facts of the abnormal social and political state of the place; and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>certainly</b> do this, for the present situation is so disagreeable in many ways to the stranger forced to live there,--the inappeasable hatred of the Austrians by the Italians is so illiberal in application to those in any wise consorting with them, and so stupid and puerile in many respects, that I think the annoyance which it gives the foreigner might well damp any passion with which he was disposed to speak of its cause.|$|E
6000|$|My words however {{were not}} {{absolutely}} the same--I put something instead of [...] "angel"; {{and in the}} sequel my epithet seemed the more apt, for when eventually we heard from Corvick it was merely, it was thoroughly to be tantalised. He was magnificent in his triumph, he described his discovery as stupendous; but his ecstasy only obscured it--there were to be no particulars till he should have submitted his conception to the supreme authority. He had thrown up his commission, he had thrown up his book, he had thrown up everything but the instant need to hurry to Rapallo, on the Genoese shore, where Vereker was making a stay. I wrote him a letter which was to await him at Aden--I besought him to relieve my suspense. That he found my letter was indicated by a telegram which, reaching me after weary days and without my having received an answer to my laconic dispatch at Bombay, was evidently intended as a reply to both communications. Those few words were in familiar French, the French of the day, which Corvick often made use of to show he wasn't a prig. It had for some persons the opposite effect, but his message may fairly be paraphrased. [...] "Have patience; I want to see, as it breaks on you, the face you'll make!" [...] "Tellement envie de voir ta tête!"--that was what I {{had to sit down}} with. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>certainly</b> not be said to have sat down, for I seem to remember myself at this time as rushing constantly between the little house in Chelsea and my own.

We all spent during this episode, for people of our means, {{a great deal of money}} in telegrams, and I counted on the receipt of news from Rapallo immediately after the junction of the discoverer with the discovered. The interval seemed an age, but late one day I heard a hansom rattle up to my door with a crash engendered by a hint of liberality. I lived with my heart in my mouth and I bounded to the window--a movement which gave me a view of a young lady erect on the footboard of the vehicle and eagerly looking up at my house. At sight of me she flourished a paper with a movement that brought me straight down, the movement with which, in melodramas, handkerchiefs and reprieves are flourished at the foot of the scaffold.|$|E
