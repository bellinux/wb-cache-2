40|$|Abstract—Various {{evolutionary}} multiobjective optimization algorithms (EMOAs) {{have adopted}} <b>indicator-based</b> selection operators that augment or replace dominance ranking with quality indicators. A quality indicator measures {{the goodness of}} each solution candidate. Many quality indicators have been proposed with the intention to capture different preferences in optimization. Therefore, <b>indicator-based</b> selection operators tend to have biased selection pressures that evolve solution candidates toward particular regions in the objective space. An open question is whether a set of existing <b>indicator-based</b> selection operators can create a single operator that outperforms those existing ones. In order to address this question, this paper proposes and evaluates a method to aggregate (or boost) existing <b>indicator-based</b> selection operators. Experimental results show that a boosted selection operator outperforms exiting ones in optimality, diversity and convergence velocity. It also exhibits robustness against different characteristics in different optimization problems and yields stable performance to solve them.

Using household survey data from Malawi, we examine whether an <b>indicator-based</b> targeting {{of the poor}} is more target- and cost-efficient than the currently used mechanisms for targeting agricultural subsidy programs in the country. There is compelling evidence in favor of targeting Malawi’s poor based on the newly developed system. An <b>indicator-based</b> targeting system {{appears to be more}} target- and cost-efficient than the 2000 / 01 Starter Pack and the 2006 / 07 Agricultural Input Subsidy Program (AISP). While the Starter Pack and the AISP transferred about 50 % of total transfer, under an <b>indicator-based</b> system, about 73 % of transfers are delivered to the poor. Likewise, under an <b>indicator-based</b> system, the costs of leakage are cut down by more than 50 % compared to Starter Pack and AISP.

40|$|Abstract—This paper proposes and evaluates an {{evolutionary}} multiobjective optimization algorithm (EMOA) that eliminates dominance ranking in selection and performs <b>indicator-based</b> selection with the R 2 indicator. Although {{it is known}} that the R 2 indicator possesses desirable properties to quantify the goodness of a solution or a solution set, few attempts have been made until recently to investigate <b>indicator-based</b> EMOAs with the R 2 indicator. The proposed EMOA, called R 2 -IBEA, is designed to obtain a diverse set of Pareto-approximated solutions by correcting an inherent bias in the R 2 indicator. (The R 2 indicator has a stronger bias {{to the center of the}} Pareto front than to its edges.) Experimental results demonstrate that R 2 -IBEA outperforms existing <b>indicator-based,</b> decomposition-based and dominance ranking based EMOAs in the optimality and diversity of solutions. R 2 -IBEA successfully produces diverse individuals that are distributed well in the objective space.

40|$|The {{importance}} of uncertainty analysis has been increasingly recognised, {{due to the}} influence of uncertainties in data, models and expert judgements. However, the successful integration of uncertainty analysis into multi-criteria analysis (MCA) has rarely been achieved. This paper analyses uncertainty sources in MCA. General methods of uncertainty analysis in MCA are reviewed, including probabilistic methods, <b>indicator-based</b> methods and fuzzy logic. Building on this review, an uncertainty analysis module developed for use within a GIS-based MCA tool for catchment management is presented. In this module, the influence of uncertainties on decision-making can be visually explored using an <b>indicator-based</b> method. The <b>indicator-based</b> method provides a pragmatic approach to communicating areas of uncertainty to decision-makers without assuming any prior knowledge of uncertainty analysis techniques. This enables uncertainty analysis to be more effectively operationalised within the decision-making process.

40|$|In recent years, <b>indicator-based</b> {{evolutionary}} algorithms, allowing to implicitly incorporate user preferences {{into the}} search, have become {{widely used in}} practice to solve multiobjective optimization problems. When using this type of methods, the optimization goal changes from optimizing a set of objective functions simultaneously to the singleobjective optimization goal of finding a set of µ points that maximizes the underlying indicator. Understanding {{the difference between these}} two optimization goals is fundamental when applying <b>indicator-based</b> algorithms in practice. On the one hand, a characterization of the inherent optimization goal of different indicators allows the user to choose the indicator that meets her preferences. On the other hand, knowledge about the sets of µ points with optimal indicator values—so-called optimal µ-distributions—can be used in performance assessment whenever the indicator is used as a performance criterion. However, theoretical studies on <b>indicator-based</b> optimization are sparse. One of the most popular indicators is the weighted hypervolume indicator.

Using household survey data from Malawi, we examine whether an <b>indicator-based</b> system is more target and cost-efficient in reaching the poor than universal {{systems and the}} currently used mechanisms for targeting agricultural subsidies in the country. Estimation results suggest that targeting Malawi's poor and smallholder farmers with <b>indicator-based</b> systems may be worth the extra effort and may improve program targeting and cost efficiency. Even though under the proposed system administrative costs increase, simulation results indicate {{that it does not}} make a targeted program cost-ineffective. More importantly, the proposed system appears to be more target and cost-efficient than the 2000 / 2001 Targeted Input Program (TIP) and the 2006 / 2007 Agricultural Input Support Program (AISP), both of which were administered through community-based targeting systems. While TIP and AISP transferred about 50 % of total transfer, under the proposed system, about 73 % of transfers are delivered to the poor and smallholder farmers. Additionally, the costs of leakage to the non-poor are cut by more than 50 % under the proposed system. We conclude from the above findings that the newly proposed system can potentially improve the targeting and cost efficiency of Malawi's development programs. However, such improvements depend on actual implementation of targeted programs, a critical issue that should not be set aside.

The approach emphasises the need to place human dignity and wellbeing at the core of the analysis; linkages to the natural resource base; the importance of peace, governance and institutions as cross-cutting factors; and the role of the means of implementation for addressing gaps.
