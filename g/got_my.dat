25|$|Born in Franklinton, North Carolina, a small textile {{and tobacco}} town, Harvey grew up {{alongside}} his father who owned his own land, {{which was very}} uncommon for black farmers in the 1930s. When his tenants stole from his property, Harvey’s father lost his land. Refusing to join the sharecropping business, Harvey looked for work in Durham. In 1936, Harvey found {{a job at the}} American Tobacco Company where the segregated unions troubled him. In a journal article about his father, the younger Harvey wrote, “I <b>got</b> <b>my</b> hatred for segregation from my father. He was raised up in the house of a white couple, two liberal lawyers. He learned to always speak up for himself.” In 1943, Harvey worked at the Krueger Bottling Company in Durham where he successfully led efforts to integrate the segregated black and white unions. During the black union protest against the segregated pay scales, forty-four out of the forty-five whites in the plant joined the black union in their strike.|$|E
25|$|I <b>got</b> <b>my</b> {{stopwatch}} {{going again}} {{to check the}} length of each man's turn at the front. Generally in a race of the Baracchi type, the changes are very rapid, with stints {{of no more than}} 300 yards. Altig was at the front when I started the check — and he was still there a minute later. Something must be wrong. Altig wasn't even swinging aside to invite Anquetil through... Suddenly, on a flat road, Anquetil lost contact and a gap of three lengths appeared between the two partners. There followed one of the most sensational things I have ever seen in any form of cycle racing during my 35 years' association with the sport — something which I consider as great a physical performance as a world hour record or a classic road race win. Altig was riding at 30mph at the front — and had been doing so for 15 minutes. When Anquetil lost contact, he had to ease the pace, wait for his partner to go by, push him powerfully in the back, sprint to the front again after losing 10 yards in the process, and again settle down to a 30mph stint at the front. Altig did this not just once but dozens of times.|$|E
