40|$|The neutral {{interface}} reflection (NIR) {{assumption is}} a widely accepted theory in computer vision. According to the NIR the color of specularities of dielectric materials {{is the color of}} the incident illumination and the influence of the Fresnel reflectance is neglected. We show, that there is a material- and geometry-dependent shift between the color of the specularity and the color of the incident light due to the <b>Fresnel</b> <b>effect</b> which for human skin can be up to approximately 5. 8 %. As the NIR concept is often the core idea of specularity-based illuminant-color estimation techniques, the ignored <b>Fresnel</b> <b>effect</b> introduces a systematic error in the estimation result. We thus propose a material-dependent rectification method for correcting this color shift. Our experiments on human skin regions show an average improvement of the illuminant color estimation of about 30 %.

40|$|A {{key element}} to {{creating}} realistic images is {{the appearance of}} surfaces. In order to overcome the artificial look of synthetic humans, human skin has to be modelled in all its variety. A new physically-based skin reflection model is {{presented in this paper}} to render a diverse selection of skin complexions. The reflection model is based on steady-state light transport theory in multi-layered skin tissue. A three-layer simulation model has been developed to capture the effect of natural sebum on skin appearance. Sebum is found over most parts of the body, causing skin to look more specular, depending on the viewing conditions. Optical and geometric properties are used as control parameters to influence the surface reflection and subsurface scattering of light within the three layers. The resultant reflection consists of the specular reflection due to the <b>Fresnel</b> <b>effect,</b> as well as the diffuse reflection from subsurface scattering. The Monte Carlo method isused to simulate the propagation of light in skin tissue. Various effects like scattering, absorption, reflection and transmission have been taken into account. The bi-directional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) obtained from the simulation is used to render the appearance of human skin.

40|$|The {{study of}} {{scattered}} fields from nonspherical seatterers {{is becoming an}} important subject particularly {{in the area of}} theoretical modeling of microwave backscatter from vegetation. The generalized Rayleigh-Gans approximation has been widely used in the calculation of scattered fields from scatterers where at least one of its dimensions is comparably smaller than the wavelength. In such calculations, far-field approximations are used, which are not accurate when the observation points are in the Fresnel and near-field regions of the scatterer. Hence, the <b>effects</b> of <b>Fresnel</b> phase and amplitude corrections for the scattered field of circular disks, needles, and cylinders have been examined and shown to be significant in the calculation of closely spaced scatterers.

It has also been shown that intensity patterns will be created at certain fractional Talbot lengths. At half the distance the same intensity distribution appears except for a lateral shift of half the grating period while at certain smaller fractional Talbot distances the self-images have fractional periods and fractional sizes of the intensity maxima and minima, that become visible in the intensity distribution behind the grating, a so-called Talbot carpet. The Talbot length and the fractional lengths can be calculated by knowing the parameters of the illuminating radiation and the illuminated grating and thus gives the exact position of the intensity maxima, which needs to be measured in GBI.
