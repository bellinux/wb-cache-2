40|$|Abstract An {{existing}} {{dynamic and}} stochastic bio-economic model <b>of</b> intramammary infection (<b>IMI)</b> caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, and Escherichia coli {{was extended to}} model the dynamics <b>of</b> <b>IMI</b> during the dry period. These dynamics were modeled {{on the basis of}} a Greenwood model. The extended model was used to calculate the cost-effectiveness of different dry period interventions in relation to the annual net costs <b>of</b> <b>IMI</b> in a herd of 100 dairy cows at the start. The interventions were blanket dry cow therapy (BDCT) as the default scenario, BDCT combined with teat sealant (TS), selective dry cow therapy (SDCT) or TS, and SDCT combined with TS. Input parameters of the dynamics <b>of</b> <b>IMI</b> during the dry period and the economic parameters were based on literature. The costs of clinical and subclinical IMI during lactation, clinical IMI during the dry period, and the cost of intervention were used to calculate the combined total annual net cost <b>of</b> <b>IMI</b> per herd. The combined total annual net cost <b>of</b> <b>IMI</b> using the other intervention scenarios was compared to the default scenario (BDCT) to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the other intervention scenarios. Sensitivity analysis was conducted on the parameters involved. The results showed that a considerable number of cows acquire new IMI during the dry period and start the new lactation with IMI. Furthermore, the average combined total annual net cost <b>of</b> <b>IMI</b> per herd using BDCT was € 8800, distributed as € 4561 due to clinical IMI, and € 3063 due to subclinical IMI during lactation, € 88 due to clinical IMI during the dry period, and € 1088 due to antibiotic therapy and labor costs at dry off. On average, application of BDCT combined with TS resulted in € 378 higher combined total annual net cost <b>of</b> <b>IMI</b> compared to the BDCT scenario. Similarly, the SDCT scenarios resulted in higher average combined total annual net costs <b>of</b> <b>IMI</b> compared to the BDCT scenario. The SDCT or TS was on average € 443 higher and the SDCT combined with TS was on average € 635 higher. Sensitivity analysis results showed that the rate <b>of</b> new <b>IMI</b> during the dry period was the most influential parameter on the average combined total annual net cost <b>of</b> <b>IMI.</b> Although the difference between the 4 simulated scenarios was minor, on average BDCT had the lowest combined total annual net cost <b>of</b> <b>IMI...</b>|$|R

40|$|The current {{methodology}} for estimating genetic parameters for SCC (SCS) {{does not account}} for the difference in SCS between healthy cows and cows with an intramammary infection (IMI). We propose a two-component finite mixed normal mixture model to estimate IMI prevalence, separate SCS subpopulation means, individual posterior probabilities <b>of</b> <b>IMI,</b> and SCS variance components. The theory is presented and the expectation-conditional maximization algorithm is utilized to compute maximum likelihood estimates. The methodology is illustrated on two simulated data sets based on the current knowledge of SCS parameters. Maximum likelihood estimates <b>of</b> <b>IMI</b> prevalence and SCS subpopulation means were close to simulated values, except for the estimate <b>of</b> <b>IMI</b> prevalence when both subpopulations were almost confounded. Individual posterior probabilities <b>of</b> <b>IMI</b> were always higher among infected than among healthy cows. Error and additive variance components obtained under the mixture model were closer to simulated values than restricted maximum likelihood estimates obtained assuming a homogeneous SCS distribution, especially when subpopulations were completely separated and when mixing proportion was highest. Convergence was linear and rapid when priors were chosen with caution. The advantages of the methodology are demonstrated, and its feasibility for large data sets is discussed.

40|$|This study {{determined}} {{the direct and}} indirect epidemiologic and economic effects of lactational treatment of new bovine subclinical intramammary infections (IMI) caused by contagious pathogens using an existing bioeconomic model. The dynamic and stochastic model simulated the dynamics of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, and Escherichia coli during lactation and the dry period in a 100 -cow dairy herd during 1 quota year. Input parameters on cure were obtained from recent Dutch field data. The costs <b>of</b> clinical <b>IMI,</b> subclinical IMI, and intervention were calculated into the combined total annual net costs <b>of</b> <b>IMI</b> per herd. The cost effectiveness of 4 scenarios with lactational intervention was determined; scenarios included no intervention, treatment after 1 mo of infection, treatment after 2 mo of infection, and treatment after 1 mo of infection and culling of uncured cows after 2 mo of infection. Model behavior was observed for variation in parameter input values. Compared with no lactational intervention, lactational intervention <b>of</b> new subclinical <b>IMI</b> resulted in fewer clinical flare ups, less transmission within the herd, and much lower combined total annual net costs <b>of</b> <b>IMI</b> in dairy herds. Antimicrobial treatment <b>of</b> <b>IMI</b> after 1 mo of infection and culling of uncured cows after 2 mo of infection resulted in the lowest costs, whereas treatment after 2 mo of infection {{was associated with the}} highest costs between the scenarios with intervention. Changing the probability of cure resulted in a nonlinear change in the cumulative incidence <b>of</b> <b>IMI</b> cases and associated costs. Lactational treatment was able to prevent IMI epidemics in dairy herds at high transmission rates of Strep. uberis, Strep. dysgalactiae, and E. coli. Lactational treatment did not limit the spread of Staph. aureus at high transmission rates, although the associated costs were lower compared with no intervention. To improve udder health in a dairy herd, lactational treatment <b>of</b> contagious subclinical <b>IMI</b> must therefore be preceded by management measures that lower the transmission rate. Lactational treatment <b>of</b> environmental subclinical <b>IMI</b> seemed less cost effective. Detection <b>of</b> subclinical <b>IMI</b> needs improvement to be able to most effectively treat subclinical IMI caused by contagious pathogens during lactation.

40|$|This {{project was}} divided into two studies. The first {{investigated}} the pharmacokinetics <b>of</b> imipramine hydrochloride (<b>IMI)</b> in bulls. IMI was administered intravenously to three bulls (600 - 705. 5 kg) at a dose of 2 mg/kg body weight (BW). Intravenous plasma concentrations <b>of</b> <b>IMI</b> over time were determined by fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA). IMI plasma concentration versus time profile was best described by a two compartmental open model with first-order rate constants. IMI distributed rapidly, (t½ a) at 7. 2 ± 4. 2 min, exhibited a very large apparent steady state volume of distribution (Vdss) of 4. 2 ± 0. 9 l /kg BW, had a very short terminal elimination half-life (t½ b) of 140 ± 15 min and showed a rapid total body clearance (C l) of 22. 7 ± 7 m l /min/kg. Both IMI and the pharmacologically active metabolite, desipramine was negligible in serum at 24 hours. All three bulls treated with IMI showed pronounced central nervous system signs immediately post injection. Signs of generalised weakness and ataxia were evident. All CNS signs dissipated 15 - 20 minutes post injection and should therefore not influence the treatment interval. An interval of at least 23 hours between repeat treatments <b>of</b> <b>IMI,</b> representing a period of at least 10 half-lives, is recommended. The dose of 2 mg/kg BW {{used in this study}} was similar to that routinely used in stallions without fatal side effects. One of the three bulls exhibited spontaneous emission and ejaculation with this dose. The second study investigated the effects <b>of</b> <b>IMI</b> on ampullar strips of bulls in organ baths. Vasa deferentia were collected from 16 freshly slaughtered post-puberal bulls of various breeds. Longitudinal ampullar strips were prepared and placed into 20 ml modified Krebs bicarbonate solution, aerated with a mixture of 02 (95 %) and CO 2 (5 %) in water-jacketed organ baths. The effect on the smooth muscle tissue of noradrenaline (NA) alone, NA in combination with IMI and IMI alone was evaluated. NA alone consistently produced dose-dependant smooth muscle tissue contractions. IMI doses equivalent to 0. 1 mg to < 1 mg/kg bwe partially blocked NA stimulating effects. Amplitude of rhythmic contractions increased while contraction frequency decreased at this level. This study supports the adrenergic potentiating effects <b>of</b> <b>IMI</b> at doses <b>of</b> 0. 05 - 0. 2 mg/kg bwe with higher doses having paradoxical effects. Doses <b>of</b> <b>IMI</b> < 2 mg/kg bwe completely blocked NA effects. Tissue response to NA, after IMI blockade, started to recover 146 - 186 minutes after application <b>of</b> <b>IMI</b> at < 2 mg/kg bwe. In the absence <b>of</b> NA, <b>IMI</b> had no effect on smooth muscle activity. The time to an IMI effect on NA initiated smooth muscle activity was 8 minutes. On the basis of the results of this in vitro study, we propose that IMI can be used to enhance semen collection by means of electro-stimulation in domestic bulls and immobilised wildlife species such as buffalo, provided that the correct dose is used.
