25|$|In September 2016, Russian hackers hacked the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) ADAMS {{anti-doping}} {{system and}} released {{data on a}} number of athletes, including Chris Froome and Bradley Wiggins. Therapeutic use exemptions (TUEs) are medical exemptions athletes can be given when they need treatment for pre-existing medical conditions where the drugs used in the treatment are on the WADA prohibited compound list. The leak demonstrated that Wiggins had received TUEs for triamcinolone acetonide in June 2011, June 2012 and April 2013, a number of days {{before the start of the}} 2011 Tour de France, 2012 Tour de France, and 2013 Giro d'Italia respectively. Wiggins also received TUEs for salbutamol, fluticasone, <b>formoterol</b> and budesonide whilst at Team Highroad. Froome had received TUEs for prednisolone in May 2013 and during the 2014 Tour de Romandie.|$|E

5000|$|At {{the current}} time, {{available}} long-acting β2 agonists include salmeterol, <b>formoterol,</b> bambuterol, and sustained-release oral salbutamol.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Formoterol</b> has an {{extended}} duration of action (up to 12 hours) compared to short-acting β2 agonists such as salbutamol (albuterol), which are effective for 4-6 hours. LABAs such as <b>formoterol</b> {{are used as}} [...] "symptom controllers" [...] to supplement prophylactic corticosteroid therapy. A [...] "reliever" [...] short-acting β2 agonist (e.g., salbutamol) is still required, since LABAs are not recommended {{for the treatment of}} acute asthma.|$|E
50|$|Mometasone furoate can be {{used with}} <b>formoterol</b> for the {{treatment}} of asthma, due to its anti-inflammatory properties.|$|E
50|$|<b>Formoterol</b> {{may also}} help stimulate {{mitochondrial}} biogenesis. Mitochondrial dysfunction is related to many degenerative diseases — particularly neurodegenerative disorders.|$|E
50|$|Inhaled <b>formoterol</b> {{works like}} other β2 agonists, causing {{bronchodilation}} by relaxing the smooth muscle in the airway {{so as to}} treat the exacerbation of asthma.|$|E
50|$|Long-acting β {{adrenoreceptor}} agonists (LABAs) {{are subject}} to a boxed warning against {{the possibility of an}} increased risk of asthma-related death. <b>Formoterol</b> belongs to the LABA class of drugs. As there does not exist {{at the time of the}} monograph's publication adequate research to determine whether the rate of asthma-related death is increased with <b>formoterol,</b> it is therefore recommended by the FDA that LABAs only be used for patients not adequately controlled on other asthma controlling medications or whose disease severity clearly warrants initiation of dual therapy.|$|E
50|$|Aclidinium/formoterol (trade names Duaklir and Brimica) is a {{combination}} drug for inhalation, used {{in the management of}} chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It consists of aclidinium bromide, a long-acting muscarinic antagonist, and <b>formoterol,</b> a long-acting β2 agonist.|$|E
5000|$|Budesonide/formoterol, {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Symbicort among others, is a {{combination}} medication containing budesonide and <b>formoterol</b> used {{in the management of}} asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

50|$|Short-acting {{beta-agonists}} like salbutamol or terbutaline or long-acting beta-agonists like salmeterol and <b>formoterol</b> dilate airways which {{relieve the}} symptoms thus reducing {{the severity of}} the reaction. Some patients also use it just before work to avoid a drop in the FEV1.|$|E
50|$|In {{patients}} with asthma, budesonide/formoterol formulation for both maintenance and as-needed treatment reduces exacerbations better than as-needed <b>formoterol</b> or as-needed terbutaline. Nevertheless, {{it is unclear}} as to whether this strategy is better than increasing a maintenance dose of Symbicort or similar combined inhaler.|$|E
50|$|Preliminary {{research}} offers {{hope that}} <b>formoterol</b> {{may be a}} useful treatment in Down syndrome. In a mouse model of the disease, the drug strengthened nerve connections in the hippocampus, a brain center used for spatial navigation, paying attention and forming new memories.|$|E
50|$|Currently {{available}} long-acting β2 {{adrenergic receptor}} agonists include salmeterol (inhaled or sustained-release oral), <b>formoterol,</b> bambuterol and some others. Combinations of inhaled steroids and these long-acting bronchodilators {{are becoming more}} widespread; the most common combination currently in use is fluticasone/salmeterol (brand names Seretide (UK) and Advair (U.S.)).|$|E
50|$|Salbutamol (INN) or albuterol (USAN) {{and some}} other β2 agonists, such as <b>formoterol,</b> also come in a {{solution}} form for nebulization, which is more commonly used than inhalers in emergency rooms. Salbutamol and terbutaline are also both available in oral forms. Nebulizer form is as effective as administering the drug intravenously.|$|E
5000|$|Long-acting beta-adrenoceptor {{agonists}} (LABA) such as salmeterol and <b>formoterol</b> {{can improve}} asthma control, {{at least in}} adults, when given in combination with inhaled corticosteroids. In children this benefit is uncertain. When used without steroids they {{increase the risk of}} severe side-effects and even with corticosteroids they may slightly increase the risk.|$|E
50|$|A year-long, {{placebo-controlled}} trial {{published in}} July 2010 suggests indacaterol may be significantly {{more effective than}} twice-daily <b>formoterol</b> in improving FEV1. There were some reductions in the need for rescue medication, but these were not significantly different; nor was there any difference {{in the rate of}} exacerbation between the 2 active treatments.|$|E
50|$|In the European Union, Australia, Canada, Israel, Saudi Arabia and {{elsewhere}} the combination is {{available as a}} dry powder inhaler in the following doses: 100/6 (80/4.5), 200/6 (160/4.5) and 400/12 (320/9), where the larger number is the dose per actuation of budesonide (in micrograms) and the lower number the dose of <b>formoterol</b> (also in micrograms).|$|E
50|$|<b>Formoterol</b> (INN) or eformoterol (former BAN) is a long-acting β2 agonist (LABA) {{used in the}} {{management}} of asthma and COPD. It is marketed in three forms: a dry-powder inhaler, a metered-dose inhaler and an inhalation solution, under various trade names including Atock, Atimos/Atimos Modulite, Foradil/Foradile, Oxeze/Oxis, and Perforomist. It is also marketed in the combination formulations budesonide/formoterol and mometasone/formoterol.|$|E
5000|$|On June 29, 2006, Cornell University and Stanford University {{researchers}} {{reported that a}} meta-analysis they conducted found that [...] "regularly inhaled β agonists (orciprenaline/metaproterenol Alupent, <b>formoterol</b> Foradil, fluticasone+salmeterol Advair, and salbutamol/albuterol Ventolin, Volmax, and others) increased the risk of respiratory death more than two-fold, compared with a placebo," [...] while used to treat {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD).|$|E
50|$|Inhaled {{salmeterol}} {{works like}} other β2 agonists, causing bronchodilation by relaxing the smooth muscle in the airway {{so as to}} treat the exacerbation of asthma. The long duration of action occurs by the molecules initially diffusing into the plasma membrane of the lung cells, and then slowly being released back outside the cell where they can {{come into contact with}} the β2 adrenoreceptors, with the long carbon chain forming an anchor in the membrane. Interestingly, salmeterol binding to the β2 adrenoreceptor does not induce desensitization or internalization of receptors which may also contribute to its long therapeutic duration of action. <b>Formoterol</b> has been demonstrated to have a faster onset of action than salmeterol {{as a result of a}} lower lipophilicity, and has also been demonstrated to be more potent - a 12 µg dose of <b>formoterol</b> has been demonstrated to be equivalent to a 50 µg dose of salmeterol.|$|E
50|$|Beta-2 agonist is a {{drug that}} opens the {{bronchial}} airways and often helps build muscle. Agonist {{is often referred to}} as a drug that stimulates natural processes in the body and beta-2 to a cell receptor. They are clinically used to help asthma patients. Yet, the abuse of beta-3 agonists can be used as an enhancer. Examples of beta-2 agonists are: bambuterol, <b>formoterol,</b> salbutamol, and salmeterol.|$|E
50|$|When {{combined}} with inhaled steroids, β adrenoceptor agonists can improve symptoms. In children this benefit is uncertain {{and they may}} be potentially harmful. They should not be used without an accompanying steroid due to an increased risk of severe symptoms, including exacerbation in both children and adults. At least with <b>formoterol,</b> an increased risk appears to be present even when steroids are used and this risk has not been ruled out for salmeterol.|$|E
50|$|Olodaterol is {{a nearly}} full β2 agonist, having 88% {{intrinsic}} activity {{compared to the}} gold standard isoprenaline/isoproterenol). Its half maximal effective concentration (EC50) is 0.1 nM. It has a higher in vitro selectivity for β2 receptors than the related drugs <b>formoterol</b> and salmeterol: 241-fold versus β1 and 2299-fold versus β3 adrenergic receptors. The high β2/β1 selectivity {{may account for the}} apparent lack of tachycardia in clinical trials, which is mediated by β1 receptors on the heart.|$|E
50|$|Once {{bound to}} a β2 receptor, an olodaterol {{molecule}} stays there for hours — its dissociation half-life is 17.8 hours —, {{which allows for}} once-a-day application of the drug like with indacaterol. Other related compounds generally have a shorter duration of action {{and have to be}} applied twice daily (e.g. <b>formoterol,</b> salmeterol). Still others (e. g. salbutamol/аlbuterol, fenoterol) have to be applied {{three or four times a}} day for continuous action, which can also be an advantage for patients who need to apply β2 agonists only occasionally, for example in an asthma attack.|$|E
50|$|Indacaterol (INN) is an ultra-long-acting {{beta-adrenoceptor agonist}} {{developed}} by Novartis. It {{was approved by}} the European Medicines Agency (EMA) under the trade name Onbrez Breezhaler on November 30, 2009, and by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), under the trade name Arcapta Neohaler, on July 1, 2011. It needs to be taken only once a day, unlike the related drugs <b>formoterol</b> and salmeterol. It is licensed only for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (long-term data in patients with asthma are thus far lacking). It is delivered as an aerosol formulation through a dry powder inhaler.|$|E
50|$|Prior to {{competing}} at the 2010 Commonwealth Games, an out {{of competition}} drug test revealed {{the presence of}} <b>formoterol.</b> Although there were initial concerns, the drug was permitted as an asthma medication under special exemptions, and it was later revealed that the problem {{was the result of}} a mistake in processing paperwork for his exemption. The exemption was provided and backdated, and D'Arcy was permitted to compete in the games. At the Commonwealth Games, D'Arcy was expected to take home the gold medal in the 200 m butterfly as his fastest time for the year was more than two seconds faster than any of the other entrants, but he failed to qualify for the final after a slow heat.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} short-acting β2 {{agonists}} available including salbutamol (Ventolin) and terbutaline. They provide some relief of symptoms {{for four to}} six hours. Long-acting β2 agonists such as salmeterol, <b>formoterol</b> and indacaterol are often used as maintenance therapy. Some feel the evidence of benefits is limited while others view the evidence of benefit as established. Long-term use appears safe in COPD with adverse effects include shakiness and heart palpitations. When used with inhaled steroids they {{increase the risk of}} pneumonia. While steroids and LABAs may work better together, it is unclear if this slight benefit outweighs the increased risks. Indacaterol requires an inhaled dose once a day, and is as effective as the other long-acting β2 agonist drugs that require twice-daily dosing for people with stable COPD.|$|E
