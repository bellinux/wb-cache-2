5000|$|Viola arvensis is {{a species}} of violet known by the common name <b>field</b> <b>pansy.</b> It is native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa, and it is known on other continents as an {{introduced}} species and a weed of disturbed and cultivated areas.|$|E
50|$|A German fable {{tells of}} how the pansy lost its perfume. Originally pansies {{would have been very}} fragrant, growing wild in fields and forests. It was said that people would trample the grass {{completely}} in eagerness to pick pansies. Unfortunately, the people’s cows were starving due to the ruined <b>fields,</b> so the <b>pansy</b> prayed to give up her perfume. Her prayer was answered, and without her perfumed scent, the fields grew tall, and the cows grew fat on the fresh green grass.|$|R
5000|$|Adults {{are strong}} flyers and fly from March to October. The heat-dependent {{caterpillars}} feed on Viola species (wild pansy or heartsease (Viola tricolor), <b>field</b> <b>pansy</b> (Viola arvensis), Viola canina, Viola odorata, Viola calcarata, Viola lutea, Viola biflora), lucerne (Medicago sativa), borage (Borago officinalis), Anchusa, Rubus and Onobrychis species.|$|E
50|$|Viola bicolor, {{commonly}} known as the American <b>field</b> <b>pansy</b> or wild pansy, is an annual plant in the violet family found throughout much of North America. There is some debate as to whether the plant is native here, or if it was introduced from the Old World as a variety of Viola kitaibeliana, but it is now generally thought to be native to the North America. It is common in disturbed habitats, but is also found in fields and open woods on substrates ranging from sandy soil to clay to limestone.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{evaluate}} the spectrum of species and the abundance of weed infestation in the selected company. The measurements were performed on the land of AGRAS Bohdalov, Ltd., located in region Vysočina and farms on 1, 280 hectares of land. The evaluation {{was carried out in}} two crops: winter wheat and spring barley after various preceding crop. For evaluation there was used a numerical method; on quarter m 2 with a conversion to 1 m 2. In winter wheat was found 19 weed species. The most abundant were <b>Field</b> <b>pansy</b> (Viola arvensis), Ivy-leaved speedwell (Veronica hederifolia) and Goosegrass (Galium aparine). In the cover of spring barley were found 15 weed species. The most common were <b>Field</b> <b>pansy</b> (Viola arvensis), Field pennycress (Thlaspi arvense) and Shepherd's purse (Capsella bursa-pastoris) ...|$|E
40|$|Due to etching {{effects on}} broad leafed weeds, fine ground kainite {{was used for}} weed control before {{synthetic}} herbicides have become common practice in conventional farming. According to the organic standards kainite {{can be used as}} potassium fertiliser. The present study investigates optimal growing stages for application in organic winter wheat and the range of effectiveness. Kainite was applied at a rate of 800 kg per hectare alternatively at EC 29 and EC 30 under the conditions of morning dew on days with high sunshine duration. At both growing stages kainite application reduced the population of hairy vetch, chamomile, cornflower, <b>field</b> <b>pansy,</b> winter rape, common chickweed and persian speedwell. Application at early growing stages led to a higher weed reduction...|$|E
40|$|This work {{is focused}} on the {{problems}} of weed plants in winter rape which has been in recent years {{one of the most significant}} crop-plants in the world and represents one of the few plants grown in the Czech Republic where we can expect positive profit. The problems of weed plants is one of the main negative factors affecting the yield and quality of rape. For this reason I was following the weed infestation rate in three variants in one land during a certain vegetation period of winter rape. The number of weed plants occurred in the given land was recorded and assessed regularly. The most frequent weed was <b>field</b> <b>pansy,</b> which made up approximately 85 % of all the range of weeds which occurred in the explored land. The second most frequent weed was Field pennycress which made up 14 % of the weeds occurred. There were hardly any other kinds of weeds in the land. From the resultant values we can make the conclusion that long-term fight against persistent weeds has to be done carefully and has to be based on complex protection which consists of preventive and direct methods of weed plants regulation...|$|E
40|$|Cyclotides are {{a family}} of plant defense {{proteins}} that are highly resistant to adverse chemical, thermal, and enzymatic treatment. Here, we present the first crystal structure of a cyclotide, varv F, from the European <b>field</b> <b>pansy,</b> Viola arvensis, determined at a resolution of 1. 8 Å. The solution state NMR structure was also determined and, combined with measurements of biophysical parameters for several cyclotides, provided an insight into the structural features that account for the remarkable stability of the cyclotide family. The x-ray data confirm the cystine knot topology and the circular backbone, and delineate a conserved network of hydrogen bonds {{that contribute to the}} stability of the cyclotide fold. The structural role of a highly conserved Glu residue that has been shown to regulate cyclotide function was also determined, verifying its involvement in a stabilizing hydrogen bond network. We also demonstrate that varv F binds to dodecylphosphocholine micelles, defining the binding orientation and showing that its structure remains unchanged upon binding, further demonstrating that the cyclotide fold is rigid. This study provides a biological insight into the mechanism by which cyclotides maintain their native activity in the unfavorable environment of predator insect guts. It also provides a structural basis for explaining how a cluster of residues important for bioactivity may be involved in self-association interactions in membranes. As well as being important for their bioactivity, the structural rigidity of cyclotides makes them very suitable as a stable template for peptide-based drug design. Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} on biology, occurrence and especially, herbicide {{regulation of}} Viola arvensis Murray on arable land. On {{the land of}} the farm DZV NOVA Bystřice a small-plot experiment focused on monitoring and regulation of Viola arvensis was carried out. This experiment was carried out from September 2012 to January 2014 on three crops (winter wheat, winter barley and winter rape) in three locations. In the theoretical part we describe the biology and occurrence of this frequent weed. The aim of the thesis was to evaluate the abundance of Viola arvensis and other weed species and verify the effect of different herbicides on Viola arvensis and other weeds. The effectiveness of the tested herbicide combinations was statistically significant for Viola arvensis and also for the other weeds (P 0, 05). The exceptions were Veronica persica, Geranium pussilum and Hordeum vulgare, where the effectiveness of these agents was not proved (P > 0, 05). The results summarize the numbers of weed species and effectiveness of applied herbicides. Viola arvensis was the most frequent weed species found on the examined sites. The effectiveness of herbicide agents used against this weed was very high. The highest was by preparations Maraton + Glean 75 WG, Maraton + Logran 20 WG, Cougar Forte + Logran 20 WG a Sumimax + Glean 75 WG (100 %). Lower was by preparations Butisan 400 SC + Command 36 SC (80 %) a Butisan Star + Garland Forte (75 %). In the winter barley and winter wheat, the applied herbicides were 100 % effective, only in the winter rape the effectiveness was lower (75 - 80 %). I can confirm the initial hypothesis about the effectiveness of the different herbicides on <b>field</b> <b>pansy</b> because their effectiveness differed...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to explore the {{structural}} and functional diversity of polypeptides that are found in plants. Expanding knowledge of simililarities between plant use of these compound and animal use promises exceptional opportunities for finding, from plant research, new structures with biomedical and biotechnological potential. A fractionation protocol was developed and applied to many plant species, providing fractions enriched in polypeptides, amenable to chemical and biological evaluation. From one species, the common <b>field</b> <b>pansy</b> (Viola arvensis), a 29 -amino-acid residue polypeptide was isolated, named varv A, which revealed a remarkable macrocyclic structure (i. e., N- and C-termini are joined) stabilised by three knotted disulfides. Varv A, together with {{an increasing number of}} homologous peptides, form the currently known peptide family of cyclotides. Their stable structure makes them an attractive scaffold for protein engineering. In addition, they display a wide range of biological activities (e. g., antimicrobial, cytotoxic, and insecticidal). As a part of this work, the cytotoxic effects of varv A and two other isolated cyclotides were evaluated in a human cell-line panel: all were active in the low µM range. Most likely, these effects involve pore formation through cell membranes. Cyclotides were found to be common in the plant family Violaceae; with eleven cyclotides isolated and sequenced from V. arvensis, V. cotyledon, and Hybanthus parviflorus. For six members of the genus Viola, cyclotide expression profiles were examined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) : all expressed notably complex mixtures, with single species containing more than 50 cyclotides. These profiles reflect the evolution of the genus. To assess these mixtures, a rational strategy for MS based amino acid sequencing of cyclotides was developed, circumventing inherent structural problems, such as low content of positively charged amino acids and the macrocyclic structure. This was achieved by aminoethylation of cysteines, which, following tryptic digestion, produced fragments of size and charge amenable to MS analysis. This method was also modified and used for mapping of disulfide bonds. Methods for isolation and characterisation developed in this work may prove useful not only for further studies on macrocyclic polypeptides from plants, but also for other plant peptides and disulfide-rich peptides from animals...|$|E
40|$|The broad aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{generate}} fundamental knowledge about the structure and function of cyclotides, which are a topologically unique family of proteins. A long-term goal {{is to use the}} fundamental knowledge to assist in the development of drugs based on the stable cyclotide framework. Cyclotides are small proteins that are characterised by a cyclic cystine knot (CCK) motif, which is defined as a circular backbone combined with a cystine knot core. So far cyclotides have been found in plants of the Violaceae (violet) and Rubiaceae (coffee) plant families, and are believed to have a defence-related function. From an application perspective, the CCK framework has potential as a drug scaffold, being an ultra-stable alternative to linear peptide models. The reasons why cyclotides show promise as a drug template are three-fold – they have naturally high sequence diversity, suggesting that their framework can accommodate a range of epitopes; they are remarkably stable under various chemical, enzymatic and thermal conditions, which means that they have increased bioavailability; and they have a diverse range of bioactivities, supporting the notion that they {{can be used in a}} number of therapeutic applications. These three reasons are intimately linked to three core knowledge domains of cyclotide research, namely cyclotide sequences, structures and interactions. Thus, fundamental research into these three domains, as investigated in this thesis, is important as it may assist in the development of drugs based on the CCK scaffold. Chapter 1 of this thesis provides the background information to define the molecules studied and to highlight their importance. Chapter 2 describes the main experimental techniques that were used in this thesis, including nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. The development of the CCK technology may benefit from a thorough understanding of the natural diversity of cyclotide sequences and the significance of this diversity on activity. Chapter 3 reports on the discovery of cyclotides in Viola yedoensis, a Chinese violet that is interesting because it is widely used in Traditional Chinese Medicine to treat a number of illnesses including swelling and hepatitis. In this study, a total of eight cyclotides was characterised, including five novel sequences. Based on anti-HIV and haemolytic assays, a strong relationship between surface hydrophobicity and activity was established. The stability of cyclotides, which underpins their potential as a drug scaffold, is examined at a structural level in Chapter 4. The solution structure of varv F, a cyclotide from the European <b>field</b> <b>pansy,</b> Viola arvensis, was solved and compared to the crystal structure of the same peptide, confirming the core structural features of cyclotides responsible for their stability, including the topology of the cystine knot, which has previously attracted some debate. From a comparison of biophysical measurements of a representative group of five cyclotides, a conserved network of hydrogen bonds, which also stabilises the cyclotide framework, was defined. A subset of hydrogen bonds involving the highly conserved Glu in loop 1 of cyclotides was examined in more detail by solving the structure of kalata B 12, the only naturally occurring cyclotide with an Asp instead of a Glu in loop 1. By comparison with the prototypical cyclotide kalata B 1 and an Ala mutant E 7 A-kalata B 1, it was shown that the highly conserved Glu is important for both stability and activity. Chapter 5 reports on studies that add to our understanding of the mechanism of action of cyclotides, which is believed to involve membrane interactions. Spin-label experiments were performed for two cyclotides, kalata B 2 and cycloviolacin O 2, which are representative cyclotides from the two cyclotide sub-families, Möbius and bracelet, respectively. This study showed that different cyclotides have different but very specific binding modes at the membrane surface. Currently, it is believed that for Möbius cyclotides at least (e. g. kalata B 1 and kalata B 2), self-association may lead to the formation of membrane pores. Oligomerisation of cyclotides was also studied in this chapter using NMR relaxation. A computer program, NMRdyn, was developed to extract microdynamic and self-association parameters from NMR relaxation data. This program was used to analyse 13 C relaxation data on kalata B 1, providing clues about the tetramer structure of kalata B 1. Although the three areas of cyclotide research examined in this thesis – sequence, structure and interactions – are reported in separate sections, the areas are not independent of each other. For example, the mechanism of action of cyclotides, which is reported in Chapter 3, requires an understanding of cyclotide structures, which is reported in Chapter 4. Chapter 6 describes a database, CyBase, which integrates sequence/structure/activity data on cyclotides so that relationships between the three areas can be examined. The database also provides tools to assist in discovery and engineering of cyclic proteins. In summary, several key areas that are fundamental to our understanding of cyclotides have been investigated in this thesis, ranging from cyclotide sequence diversity to their mechanism of action. The work described in this thesis represents a significant advance in our current understanding of cyclotides by providing, for example, explanations to their observed structural stability and how they work through interactions with other biomolecules. The information presented in this thesis is potentially useful in facilitating the long-term goal of developing peptide therapeutics based on the stable cyclotide framework...|$|E
