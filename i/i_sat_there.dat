500|$|The {{first two}} {{books in the}} Inheritance Cycle, Eragon and Eldest, sold over 15million copies {{worldwide}} together. Alfred A. Knopf Books for Young Readers, an imprint of Random House Children's Books and {{the publisher of the}} books, prepared Brisingrs release by printing 2.5million copies in advance, Random House's biggest initial print run of a children's book. Paolini said he tried not to let the expectations surrounding Brisingr affect him, stating that [...] "As an author, I found that I can't really allow myself to think about those things. I actually fell into that trap with the first part of Brisingr. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> and I started obsessing about every single word." [...] He turned away from his computer and began writing on parchment paper instead. The pages were rewritten on a computer document afterwards by his mother.|$|E
500|$|Swift was {{inspired}} to write [...] "Teardrops on My Guitar" [...] about her experience with a boy named Drew Hardwick, a classmate of hers whom she had feelings for. Hardwick later went on to join the Navy. During their freshman {{year of high school}} at Hendersonville High School, Swift and Hardwick sat beside each other in a class everyday. The two developed a fond friendship, although Swift secretively desired for it to become a romantic relationship. Because of Hardwick's unawareness, he would frequently speak to Swift about a girl he had feelings for, something Swift pretended to be endeared by, commenting, [...] "How beautiful she was, how nice and smart and perfect she was. And <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> and listened, never meaning it any of the times I said 'Oh, I'm so happy for you.'" [...] Hardwick and his love interest eventually developed a relationship which lasted for a few years. Swift never confessed her feelings to him. By the release of Taylor Swift, he remained unaware of Swift's intentions or the song and continued his relationship with the same female. Upon [...] "Teardrops on My Guitar"'s release as a single, Hardwick attempted to contact Swift via phone calls, which Swift did not respond to; he then left voicemails, but Swift felt too awkward to call back.|$|E
500|$|When Swift {{was first}} signed to Big Machine Records, {{it was a}} new and {{extremely}} small record label, the smallest in Nashville, Tennessee, that consisted of approximately twelve employees and her as the only signed artist. At some point, Swift realized that it would be more difficult for her to achieve success through a small label, than in a larger label, constricting their contacts and making it nearly impossible to embark on concert tours and have presenter or performer slots on award shows. In addition, as the only signed artist, she could not ask for favors and only had herself to encourage the hope that scenarios would eventually change. Swift described the scenario as an [...] "uphill climb" [...] and said, [...] "There was this moment where <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> and was like, ‘When {{are we going to get}} a fighting chance? We’re the smallest record label in Nashville, but we want this really bad.’" [...] After reassuring to herself that it would be different in the future, she wrote the beginning of [...] "Change". She let the track sit for a while, waiting for a remarkable event to trigger its completion. She then completed the track the day after she won the Horizon Award at the 2007 Country Music Association Awards and saw Scott Borchetta, the president of Big Machine Records, crying. [...] "That’s when I finished , because I knew I couldn’t finish it until something like that happened. It was absolutely the most amazing night of my life, getting to see the emotion of all the people who worked so hard for me." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "It was so pathetic that <b>I</b> just <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> {{driving along}} {{laughing}} out loud beneath my helmet." [...] Mark Blundell, commenting on his race.|$|R
6000|$|Then I {{took her}} hand, {{and led her}} To the ancient people's stone whereon <b>I</b> had <b>sat.</b> <b>There</b> now <b>sat</b> we; And {{together}} talked, until the first reluctant shyness fled her, [...] And she spoke confidingly.|$|R
60|$|I {{reached the}} museum and found it brilliantly lit, but empty except for the cheerful company of the two mummies who also {{appeared}} to regard me with gleaming but doubtful eyes. So <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>there</b> {{in front of the}} fire, not even daring to smoke lest tobacco should complicate Taduki.|$|R
2500|$|To {{get that}} understanding, Englund had darkened his lower eyelids with {{cigarette}} ash {{on his way}} to the audition and slicked his hair back. [...] "I looked strange. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> and listened to Wes talk. He was tall and preppy and erudite. I posed a bit, like Klaus Kinski, and that was the audition," [...] he said later. He took the part because it was the only project that fit his schedule during the hiatus between the V miniseries and series.|$|E
2500|$|... "(Guru Mani Madhava Chakiar) {{began playing}} the dual role of Parvati and Shiva... {{he sat on}} a wooden chair...I have never ever seen a Parvati so exquisitely beautiful. I have never seen a Shiva so {{handsome}} and so cunning. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> and wept as if I were alone in the presence of God. I then realised what theatre was all about – the falsehood of that old man made me arrive at a state where inhibitions and convictions, all became so fluid and beautiful. And this vision has remained with me always" ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 1962, Olivia died of measles {{encephalitis}} at age seven. Her death left Dahl [...] "limp with despair", {{and gave}} him a feeling of guilt that he could not do anything for her. Dahl subsequently became a proponent of immunisation and dedicated his 1982 book The BFG to his daughter. After Olivia's death, Dahl lost faith in God and viewed religion as a sham. While mourning her loss he had sought spiritual guidance from the former Archbishop of Canterbury Geoffrey Fisher, but became dismayed when Fisher told him that although Olivia was in Paradise, her beloved dog Rowley would never join her there, with Dahl recalling: [...] "I wanted to ask him how he could be so absolutely sure that other creatures did not get the same special treatment as us. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> wondering if this great and famous churchman really knew {{what he was talking about}} and whether he knew anything at all about God or heaven, and if he didn't, then who in the world did?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Taura {{syndrome}} {{can spread}} rapidly when introduced in new areas. A shrimp farmer described the 1995 outbreak in Texas as, [...] "This thing spread like a forest fire... There was no stopping it. <b>I</b> just <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> {{and watched it}} and {{in a matter of}} three days, my shrimp were gone. Dead!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was mighty {{glad when}} I heard you whistle again. It's hard work waitin'. <b>I</b> just <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> an' thought an' thought ... oh, {{all kinds of}} things. It's {{remarkable}} what a fellow'll think about. And {{then there was a}} darn cat that kept movin' around the house an' botherin' me with its noises." ...|$|R
6000|$|And I?--I was {{exceedingly}} tired. My {{head was}} burning like a coal; my thoughts in confusion. Suddenly I {{lost control of}} myself and broke into an angry, ridiculous sobbing. <b>I</b> simply <b>sat</b> <b>there,</b> my face hidden in my dry, hot hands, miserable and defeated. And strange Fanny Bowater, what did she do? ...|$|R
60|$|How long Jim and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> {{we never}} knew. The second tragedy, not so pitiful but as heart sickening as the first, crushed our spirits.|$|E
60|$|Conscience muttered {{harsh words}} {{in my ear}} as <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> holding that cold, limp hand with mine, while these inward schemings {{shuttled}} softly to and fro.|$|E
60|$|He stopped, {{and looked}} round at my corner. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> quite immovable, with my tracts at my elbow and with Miss Jane Ann Stamper on my lap.|$|E
6000|$|After <b>I</b> had <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> {{some time}} <b>I</b> noticed at this {{fork in the}} path a tree which had been blazed, and the letters [...] "Chamb. L." [...] written on it with red chalk. This I knew to mean Chamberlain Lake. So I {{concluded}} that on the whole {{we were on the}} right course.|$|R
6000|$|... "I was waitin' to make sure," [...] Matt explained. [...] "I was mighty {{glad when}} I heard you whistle again. It's hard work waitin'. <b>I</b> just <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> an' thought an' thought... oh, all kinds' of things. It's {{remarkable}} what a fellow'll think about. And {{then there was}} a darn cat that kept movin' around the house all' botherin' me with its noises." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> {{upon the}} box of the first wagon, eating my food, which {{consisted}} of some biltong and biscuit, for I had not bothered to shoot any game that day, which was very hot, and wondering whether Zikali were still alive, also whether I should take the trouble to walk up the kloof and find out. On the whole I thought that I would not, as the place repelled me, and I did not particularly wish to hear any more of his prophecies and fierce, ill-omened talk. So <b>I</b> just <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> studying the wonderful effect of the red evening light pouring up between those walls of fantastic rocks.|$|R
60|$|I felt {{awkward and}} at a loss as <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> before her, as a man unused to drawing-rooms might feel in the {{presence}} of a strange hostess.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> {{for an hour}} by my watch, {{though it}} seemed only a few minutes, and all that time my lion lay {{crouched}} on his crag and never moved.|$|E
60|$|For a {{long time}} <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there,</b> yawning and rubbing my face. At last I {{struggled}} to rise. It made me feel that I was lifting a weight. I stood up.|$|E
60|$|I suppose <b>I</b> {{must have}} <b>sat</b> <b>there,</b> {{shivering}} and yawning, {{for about an}} hour, when, tired of inactivity, I {{got up and went}} and leaned {{over the side of the}} vessel. The sound of the water gurgling and lapping by was so soothing that I began to doze.|$|R
2500|$|During {{his time}} with the Descendents, Navetta {{was known for his}} {{aggressive}} playing and eccentric personality. [...] "I know he had a rough familial thing growing up," [...] recalled Stevenson, [...] "just a lot of familial discord, and I think that can fuel a fire pretty well. <b>I</b> never <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> and went ‘wow, what made this guy so weird? [...] "All three of us—Frank, Bill, and I—came from divorced families," [...] said Lombardo, [...] "so that was maybe one of our bonds of commonality." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> had <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> on many occasions, and had glanced {{from time}} to time at the {{inscription}} cut on the stone, once actually reading it, without having my attention drawn away from the insect world I was living in. It was not the tradition of the Saxon king nor the beauty of the cross in that green wilderness which drew me daily to the spot, but its solitariness and the little open space where I could sit in the shade and have my rest.|$|R
6000|$|Now, had I {{come upon}} a hopeless incompatibility? Was this the reductio ad absurdum of my vision, and must it even as <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> fade, dissolve, and vanish before my eyes? ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> stupid with {{surprise}} and grief. This {{was no longer}} the adventure of venturesome children in a nursery-book. A grown man’s bitterness, informed, suspicious, resembling hatred, welled out of my heart.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there,</b> tense, {{gripping}} {{the arms of}} my chair. I was tingling. Something was happening to me. I had a curious sensation {{of being on the}} threshold of something wonderful and perilous.|$|E
6000|$|As <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> and thought, <b>there</b> came a {{knock at}} the door, and a letter, in a big blue envelope, was brought in to me. I saw at a glance that it was a lawyer's letter, and an {{instinct}} {{told me that it was}} connected with my trust. The letter, which I still have, runs thus:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{made the}} best of my way indoors again, {{returning}} by the servants' entrance. There was nobody in the laundry-room at that time; and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>there</b> alone. <b>I</b> have told you already of the thoughts which the Shivering Sand put into my head. Those thoughts came back to me now. I wondered in myself which it would be harder to do, if things went on in this manner--to bear Mr. Franklin Blake's indifference to me, or to jump into the quicksand and end it for ever in that way? ...|$|R
500|$|I got a call, {{they wanted}} me {{to be a part of}} that record. [...] It was {{actually}} the last day before Kanye had to turn the record in, and I think that pressure just made it that much more special to me. So <b>I</b> just <b>sat</b> <b>there,</b> approached the record openly and as straightforward as I could. When I laid the verse, 30 minutes later, I was extremely happy. I sent it to him, and he was too. I think it was one of the dopest verses I did this year." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> {{for some}} ten minutes with Miss Ambient, and we {{naturally}} had some conversation, which was begun, I think, by my asking her what {{the point of}} view of her sister-in-law could be.|$|E
60|$|One night, as <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> watching, I felt a hand upon my shoulder. I was not frightened, {{because it}} was a soft, gentle hand that I well knew, so I merely laid my cheek against it.|$|E
60|$|It's a funny thing, but {{it seems}} as if it always {{happened}} that just when you are feeling most miserable, something nice happens. As <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there,</b> there came from outside the sound of a motor-bicycle, and somebody shouted.|$|E
2500|$|Paige {{returned}} to his hotel room. He recalled that the next morning, [...] "My stomach got sick with the pain that shot up my right arm. Sweat popped out all over me. The pain wouldn't quit. I tried lifting my arm. I couldn't. <b>I</b> just <b>sat</b> <b>there,</b> sweating, hurting enough to want to cry, getting sicker in the stomach and getting scared—real scared. My arm. I couldn't lift it." [...] He was examined by physicians in Mexico and in the United States; one expert {{told him that he}} would never pitch again.|$|R
2500|$|My {{hand was}} writing out the words, 'There's a lady is sure , all that glitters is gold, and she's buying a {{stairway}} to heaven'. <b>I</b> just <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> {{and looked at}} them and almost leapt out of my seat." [...] Plant's own explanation of the lyrics was that it [...] "was some cynical aside about a woman getting everything she wanted all the time without giving back any thought or consideration. The first line begins with that cynical sweep of the hand ... and it softened up after that.|$|R
