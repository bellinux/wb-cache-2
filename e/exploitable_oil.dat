50|$|After {{reasonably}} <b>exploitable</b> <b>oil</b> {{fields were}} located in Mauritania, speculation intensified {{on the possibility of}} major oil resources being located off the coast of Western Sahara. Despite the fact that findings remain inconclusive, both Morocco and the Polisario have signed deals with oil and gas exploration companies. US and French companies (notably Total and Kerr-McGee) began prospecting on behalf of the Moroccan Office National de Recherches et d’Exploitations Petrolières (ONAREP).|$|E
40|$|Colorado has {{a bounty}} of commercially <b>exploitable</b> <b>oil</b> {{and natural gas}} {{resources}}. Developing these resources requires temporarily modifying landscapes to install wells, tanks, and other production-related equipment.

To address this the BGS has made strong contributions, over the past decade, to advance the geoscientific understanding of the UK Atlantic margin.

50|$|The French {{oil company}} Elf Aquitaine became active in {{petroleum}} exploration in Brunei in the 1980s. Its affiliate Elf Petroleum Asia BV has discovered commercially <b>exploitable</b> quantities of <b>oil</b> and gas {{in three of}} the four wells drilled since 1987, including a particularly promising discovery announced in early 1990. Recently, UNOCAL, partnered with New Zealand's Fletcher Challenge has been granted concessions for oil exploration. Brunei is preparing to tender concessions for deep water oil and gas exploration.|$|R
50|$|<b>Exploitable</b> {{reservoirs}} of <b>oil</b> and gas {{are increasingly}} rare and remote, leading to increased subsea deepwater well exploration and requiring BOPs to remain submerged {{for as long}} as a year in extreme conditions. As a result, BOP assemblies have grown larger and heavier (e.g. a single ram-type BOP unit can weigh in excess of 30,000 pounds), while the space allotted for BOP stacks on existing offshore rigs has not grown commensurately. Thus a key focus in the technological development of BOPs {{over the last two decades}} has been limiting their footprint and weight while simultaneously increasing safe operating capacity.|$|R
40|$|Rifts are {{elongate}} depressions overlying {{places where}} the lithosphere has ruptured in extension. Where filled with sediment they may contain <b>exploitable</b> quantities of <b>oil</b> and gas. Because rits form {{in a variety of}} tectonic settings, it is helpful to define the particular tectonic environment in which a specific rift or set of rifts has developed. A useful approach has been to relate that environment to the Wilson Cycle of the opening and the closing of oceans. This appreciation of tectonic setting can help in better understanding of the depositional, structural and thermal history of individual rift systems. The global distribution of rifts can also be related to tectonic environment. For example, rifts associated with continental rupture at a temporary still-stand of a continent over the mantle convective system (rifts like those active in East Africa today) can be distinguished from those associated with continental collision (rifts like the Cenozoic rifts of China) ...|$|R
30|$|The {{first point}} to {{consider}} in an area with <b>exploitable</b> <b>oil</b> potential production is {{the determination of the}} thermal maturity stage of the source rock. As it is shown in Figs.  8 and 9, the most Tmax values range between 436 and 450  °C and the majority of representative points of samples are placed, between 0.5 and 1 % vitrinite isoreflectance-bounding lines corresponding to the “oil window” as it is shown by HI/Tmax diagram. This lead to consider Aptian–Albian source rocks as unconventional oil shale resources.|$|E
40|$|Developing of Estonian power {{engineering}} {{on the basis}} of oil shale has caused several changes in environment. One of phenomena accompanied oil shale mining is heightened content of sulphates in groundwater and surface water. The aim of this research is to give an overview of groundwater and surface water transport of sulphates in the Estonian oil shale mining area and find out the regularity of its distribution during the time. As is known the water aquifer containing the <b>exploitable</b> <b>oil</b> shale seam is influenced by mining activities the most, but also the quality of upper and lower water aquifers can change. It is very important to clear up the vertical distribution of sulphates in different water-bearing horizons. It is taken under the observation also the phosphorite mining area which has finished its activity in year 1991. The aim is to clear up to what extent environmental conditions have become better and draw conclusions on the ground of old closed mines for working mines for getting to know how much time will take self-cleaning of environment...|$|E
40|$|After {{many years}} in which the {{potential}} {{for the development of the}} petroleum industry in eastern Africa has been largely ignored, the last five years has seen a resurgence of interest in oil exploration across the region. Long characterised as a "risky" frontier because of the difficult nature of the region's geology and the volatile character of its politics, the sharp rise in international oil prices, coupled with the difficulties in accessing other supply areas, has altered the prospects for successful commercial development of smaller fields known to exist in the region. The successful discovery of large oil deposits in the Lake Albert region of Uganda has encouraged the industry to view the region more positively, bringing an influx of new and established companies to tender for exploration rights in a wide range of fields covering Puntland, Somaliland, Ethiopia, Southern Sudan, Uganda, the DRC, Kenya, and Tanzania. This paper charts the extent of this oil exploration and industry investment in the region over the past decade, and discusses the economic and political implications of significant oil finds for future development. Additional <b>exploitable</b> <b>oil</b> fields may yet be discovered, but if only the Uganda fields are developed this is likely to have a considerable impact of the regional economy and upon relations between neighbouring states. © 2011 Taylor and Francis...|$|E
40|$|In 2009, commercially <b>exploitable</b> {{reserves}} of <b>oil</b> {{were found in}} the Albertine Lakes Basin in Uganda. Along with a number of new oil exporters, Uganda now faces the challenge of using the new resources to advance its development agenda, while avoiding the corrosive effects oil often has on governance. This paper considers the tradeoffs and potential impact of alternative uses of the oil rent. It argues that alternative approaches towards absorbing rents should be judged from two perspectives – the direct impact on growth and living standards, and the indirect effect on governance. The Ugandan authorities favor using the oil revenues to build much-needed infrastructure; while this could have very large benefits, evidence of Uganda’s already deteriorating governance and mounting corruption raise questions about its capacity to wisely invest the oil revenues. This paper considers an alternative—distributing oil rents to the population through cash transfers—as a potential tool to mitigate some of the governance risks associated with oil revenues by giving Ugandan citizens a stake in their own resource wealth, and considers the strengths and limitations of such an approach. Oil Rents, Resource Curse, Cash Transfers...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{analyzes the}} characteristics of the production and processing of oil, condensates and natural gas in the Republic of Croatia starting from 2000, until the end of 2014. Amounts of balance sheet (<b>exploitable)</b> reserves of <b>oil</b> and condensates ranges from 9330, 92 × 103 m 3 in 2005, to 13 471, 08 × 103 m 3 in 2013, while extracted amounts are gradually declining from 1332, 61 × 103 m 3 to 639, 96 × 103 m 3. The ratio of extracted amounts and reserves is gradually declining, meaning that a slight increase in reserves does not affect the extracted amounts. Exploitable reserves of natural gas during the observed period fluctuate greatly. Being peaked in 2007, at 40, 919. 70 × 106 m 3, they reached a low in 2014, at 17, 932. 98 × 106 m 3. Unlike liquid hydrocarbons, the ratio of extracted and exploitable amounts is growing and peaked in 2014. Overall energy demands for oil in Croatia (shown as total consumption of crude oil) amounted to 3032, 8 × 103 m 3 in 2013, while demands for natural gas amounted to 2809, 90 × 106 m 3. It {{is interesting to note that}} the consumption of oil is rapidly declining, which is a favorable trend from the standpoint of reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. While needs are partly covered by domestic exploitation, the dependence on imports of oil and natural gas is still evident and ranges from 75 % to 84 % for oil and 28 % to 46 % for natural gas, without major changes to the trend. The amounts of processed hydrocarbons are declining gradually, especially motor gasoline and fuel oil, while diesel fuel amounts remain mostly the same. Further research as well as development of the exploitation of oil and natural gas is of paramount importance, especially by investing in cadre education and new technologies...|$|R
40|$|Variability in the Lower Bowland shale {{microstructure}} is investigated here, for {{the first}} time, from the centimetre to the micrometre scale using optical and scanning electron microscopy (OM, SEM), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Total Organic Carbon content (TOC) measurements. A significant range of microtextures, organic-matter particles and fracture styles was observed in rocks of the Lower Bowland shale, together with the underlying Pendleside Limestone and Worston Shale formations encountered the Preese Hall- 1 Borehole, Lancashire, UK. Four micro-texture types were identified: unlaminated quartz-rich mudstone; interlaminated quartz- and pyrite-rich mudstone; laminated quartz and pyrite-rich mudstone; and weakly-interlaminated calcite-rich mudstone. Organic matter particles are classified into four types depending on their size, shape and location: multi-micrometre particles with and without macropores: micrometre-size particles in cement and between clay minerals; multi-micrometre layers; and organic matter in large pores. Fractures are categorized into carbonate-sealed fractures; bitumen-bearing fractures; resin-filled fractures; and empty fractures. We propose that during thermal maturation, horizontal bitumen-fractures were formed by overpressuring, stress relaxation, compaction and erosional offloading, whereas vertical bitumen-bearing, resin-filled and empty fractures may {{have been influenced by}} weak vertical joints generated during the previous period of veining. For the majority of samples, the high TOC (> 2 wt%), low clay content (50 wt%) and the presence of a multi-scale fracture network support the increasing interest in the Bowland Shale as a potentially <b>exploitable</b> <b>oil</b> and gas source. The microtextural observations made in this study highlight preliminary evidence of fluid passage or circulation in the Bowland Shale sequence during burial...|$|E
40|$|The Miocene-Pliocene Pannonian Lake {{formed in}} an extensional basin system behind the compressional {{arc of the}} Carpathians. Its size and depth were {{comparable}} to those of the Caspian Sea. Subsidence began in Middle Miocene times, forming deep, pelagic basins, separated by reef-bearing ridges. Clastic influx filled the marginal basins during Middle Miocene time. Prograding deltas dissected the lake and completed the infilling of the basin system {{by the end of the}} Pliocene. Basin plain, prodelta, delta front, delta plain, beach, fluviatile, and marsh environments can be recognized. Terminal Miocene uplift of the Carpathians isolated the Pannonian region from the rest of Paratethys. The subsequent decrease of salinity resulted in the evolution of an endemic, freshwater mollusc fauna. Rich nutrient influx from rivers supported high organic productivity (dinoflagellates, diatoms, nannoplankton, foraminifers, ostracods, etc.), yielding organic-rich sediments. Preservation of organic matter was helped by a stratified water column and oxygen deficient bottom conditions. Deep burial, continuing subsidence, and high geothermal flux due to an extremely thin crust, led to the formation of commercially <b>exploitable</b> <b>oil</b> and gas accumulations. Shallow lacustrine zones of basin margins provided suitable environments for a rich Congeria-Melanopsis mollusc fauna. Wave action on beaches produced commercially exploitable pure quartz sand deposits. Taxodium and Alnus forests flourished around the lake producing enormous lignite deposits. Besides a rich land snail and mammal fauna, prehominids lived in the forests. There was a warm, temperate climate, with probably frostfree winters. Basaltic volcanoes overlooked the landscape, and maars hosted minor lakes with rich algal flora forming oil shale. The catchment area included most of the Carpathians and parts of the Alps and Dinarides. The positive water balance resulted in a supposed overflow in the southern margin, supplying exotic fauna to the South Carpathian and Dacian basins of the Eastern Paratethys. The Pannonian Lake was completely filled by the end of Pliocene. Recent lakes in the Carpathian Basin are not descendants of it...|$|E
