50|$|The {{substantially}} increased {{revenues that}} accrued to the oil-producing states {{led to a}} construction boom {{in the middle east}} in the 1970s. Costain was a major beneficiary, particularly in the Emirates, and within a decade profits increased from little more than £1m a year to £47m. In the face of such overseas largesse, domestic housing activity declined. In the 1980s, recognising that exceptional middle east profits could not continue, Costain sought to redeploy its extensive cash balances into coal mining, international housing and commercial property. However, over-expansion in the late 1980s led to <b>high</b> <b>gearing</b> just as international markets were turning down, problems exacerbated by a disaster in Costain’s American coal mine. Substantial losses were incurred in the early 1990s and asset sales followed leaving Costain as a predominantly construction-oriented business.|$|E

50|$|Crawl {{ratio is}} a term used in the {{automotive}} world to describe the <b>highest</b> <b>gear</b> ratio that a vehicle is capable of. Note that gear ratio, also known as speed ratio, of a gear train {{is defined as the}} ratio of the angular velocity of the input gear to the angular velocity of the output gear, and thus a <b>higher</b> <b>gear</b> ratio implies a larger speed reduction, i.e. the input speed is reduced more at the output. The <b>highest</b> <b>gear</b> ratio is obtained at either first gear or reverse gear, but only first gear is typically taken into consideration while talking about crawl ratio. A potentially confusing terminology is that although a better crawl ratio is achieved by a <b>higher</b> <b>gear</b> ratio, it is common to refer to a better crawl ratio as “lower crawl ratio” rather than “higher crawl ratio” as it is obtained by lowering the engine speed more.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} Micra (chassis name K10) {{was introduced}} onto the Japanese market in October 1982 as a challenger to the Honda City, Daihatsu Charade, Suzuki Cultus, and Toyota Starlet. It {{was intended to}} replace the Nissan Cherry as the company's competitor in the supermini sector, as the Cherry model sold in Europe had progressively become larger with each successive generation. In Japan, it was exclusive to Nissan Cherry store locations, as the Japanese market Cherry was renamed March, benefiting from engineering contributions from Nissan's 1966 acquisition of the Prince Motor Company, who originally developed the outgoing Cherry. The Micra had particularly low fuel consumption {{made possible by a}} specially developed engine only used in the Micra, an uncommonly <b>high</b> <b>gearing,</b> and a particularly low weight: only 630 kg in early European trim. The low weight target necessitated a minimum of insulation, meaning that early Micras were quite loud.|$|E

However, {{the global financial}} crisis has {{had a significant impact}} on the performance of A-REITs in 2007 - 09.

This paper assesses the changing risk profile and portfolio diversification benefits of A-REITs over 1996 - 2008, specifically identifying the impact of international property, <b>high</b> <b>gearing</b> and property development activities on the performance and risk profile of A-REITs in the current global credit crisis.

30|$|The low {{rotational}} speed characteristic for the high-bladed turbine requires a <b>high</b> <b>gearing</b> ratio for the mechanical transmission system. As a result, {{it is possible}} to obtain high looses as more friction surfaces can exist caused by the requirement of the multi-gearing system. This may, thus, reduce the overall river power performance. In addition, the high ratio may add the dimension of the transmission on the power based on river current; thus, it may increase the weight which in turn influences the construction consideration.|$|E

40|$|The {{rolling process}} is an {{efficient}} alternative to currently exclusively applied cut-ting processes {{for the production}} of high gears, particularly regarding economic and ecological aspects. The manufacturing of involute gear profiles by forming, specifically by rolling, has several advantages in comparison to cutting methods, e. g. significantly shorter process times, no material loss and subsequently no chip disposal, strength increase in the forming zone and a high surface quality. Due to these characteristics gear forming will continue to gain relevance in future gear manufacturing. The Chapter presents the efforts being made at the Fraunhofer IWU Chemnitz to reach an advancement of the high gear rolling process by improving the gearing qualities. It presents the investigation and analysis of the interaction between tools, machine and forming process in gear rolling.

40|$|Leg {{dynamics}} {{are often}} {{ignored in the}} real-time control of walking robots because of the <b>high</b> <b>gearing</b> used in leg transmissions. However, {{the use of a}} gear reduction high enough to discount Coriolis and centripetal components yields additional non-desired dynamics, which are friction, backlash and elasticity. In such cases, simplifying robot dynamics without considering the effect of gear dynamics leads to unavoidable errors. In order to make dynamic equations reflect the reality of the physical system, it is of paramount importance to model the most significant effects acting on the system. Robot dynamics could then be analyzed and related to trajectory parameters for motion-control purposes. In this paper, a method to derive the dynamics of a robot leg as a function of leg-trajectory parameters is proposed. The method experimentally finds the simplified equations of motion that reflect the reality of the physical system. The resulting model is an accurate and simple representation of the system dynamics, taking into account the most relevant dynamics affecting the system. The simplification of the model allows it to be used in a real-time dynamic-control system. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{demonstrate}} how strategy is developed and implemented in an organisation with an unusual ownership model. Partnerships are not a prevalent form of ownership but as this case demonstrates they can be extremely effective. Furthermore this case demonstrates how logical incrementalism can be used to implement major strategic decisions. Design/methodology/approach – The paper draws on company documentary evidence and a semi-structured interview with Mr Charlie Mayfield, Chairman of John Lewis Partnership. A chairman has a helicopter view of business whose perspectives are rarely captured by strategy researchers. This case study offers an insight into strategic thinking of a chairman and chief executive of a successful company. Research limitations/implications – The case study and interview offer a unique insight into the rationale behind strategic decisions within a successful partnership that has grown organically in a highly competitive retail market without <b>high</b> <b>gearing.</b> Originality/value – This case study sheds light on strategic moves within partnership.

40|$|The {{interconnectedness}} between {{capital structure}} and firm performance {{is a topic}} of high interest among scholars and management alike. The scholars tend to unveil the why segment of the relationship, while the management looks into the how side to promote capital structure policy which can optimise the firm performance. While many studies have looked into this relationship across multiple industries and spanning across decades of data, the current study trains its lens on Malaysian public listed company companies which operate in the construction sector, and with data window between 2010 to 2014. This specific sector was chosen for their <b>high</b> <b>gearing</b> which renders firms to relatively high insolvency exposure emanating from interest rate fluctuations. The five-year timeframe was selected to isolate potential data contaminations streaming from global financial crisis which winds down in 2009. Financial data of the company were extracted from Bloomberg Terminal based on a pre-prepared list of Bloomberg tickers. A total of 225 observations were recorded in this study. Using Tobins Q {{as a proxy for}} firm performance, this study finds a mixed result where short term debts ratio indicates a significant negative effect, while long term debt ratio presents a non-significant influence.
