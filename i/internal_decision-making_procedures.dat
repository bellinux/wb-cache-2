Have these changes made the CPSA more or less ‘democratic’? An answer to this question must acknowledge that individuals interpret ‘trade union democracy’ in different ways. This paper evaluates the changes in the CPSA’s organizational structure and <b>internal</b> <b>decision-making</b> <b>procedures</b> according to the emphasis of four models of trade union democracy: liberal pluralism, grass-roots activism, individual accountability and consumer trade unionism...|$|E
40|$|In {{this chapter}} I {{identify}} three {{different types of}} risk, and thus three different dimensions {{to the relationship between}} risk and the law, in the context of EU external relations: (i) legal risk, or the risks caused by legal uncertainty arising from different regulatory approaches to data protection, and the corresponding difficulty of reaching agreement and/or defending EU regulatory preferences; (ii) constitutional or political risk, or the risks inherent in attempting effective policy- and law-making in a complex institutional structure such as the EU, especially at a time of constitutional change; (iii) the need to balance factual or real world risks – such as security risks – {{in the light of the}} EU’s potentially conflicting policy priorities and constitutional norms. I here explore these types of risk using as a case study the negotiation, renegotiation and eventual conclusion of the EU-US Agreement on the transfer of financial messaging data (the SWIFT or TFTP Agreement) and its impact on EU internal regulatory policy. As well as the interplay between these different types of risk, we can also identify two further dynamics. The first is the interaction between internal and external policies and procedures: internal constitutional guarantees, internal security impacting on cooperation with third countries; internal regulatory regimes and their applicability to transnational commercial activity; the negotiation of external instruments and <b>internal</b> <b>decision-making</b> <b>procedures.</b> This dynamic adds another level of complexity to the relationship between risk and (constitutional) law in an external relations context. The second is the interplay between different interests: between different regulatory approaches (in this case in the US and the EU); between different (EU) institutional actors in the context of international action against terrorism where the EU needs to be seen as an effective actor and partner of the US; between public security, the needs of private commercial undertakings, and the interests of the individual in the requirements of data protection and privacy. It is arguable that one feature of the legal regulation of risk is this balancing of different interests with different perspectives on the balance of risk...|$|E

40|$|Spatial <b>decision-making</b> <b>procedures,</b> such as multi-criteria {{evaluation}} (MCE), often {{rely upon}} input data derived from remote sensing {{in the form}} of land cover maps. However, these data can often contain inherent errors and misclassifications that can influence the accuracy of the final output associated with spatial <b>decision-making</b> <b>procedures.</b> The research presented here explores what influence errors and misclassifications in remote sensing derived land cover data can have on the output from spatial <b>decision-making</b> <b>procedures.</b> Four land cover data layers, each covering the same spatial area and easily obtained from scholarly or governmental institutions, are used throughout this research. These comparative land cover data layers are compared with an author-created land cover data layer known as the BASE layer. The BASE layer represents the nearest approximation of the land cover condition in the study region. Overall land cover classification accuracy is assessed for each of the land cover data layers used in this research. In addition to overall land cover classification accuracy, classification accuracy is evaluated along the edge and interior of land cover regions in order to determine if the spatial location of errors and misclassifications, rather than the quantity of errors and misclassifications alone, can {{have an impact on the}} output form spatial decision making procedures. This is followed by an assessment of the influence of errors and misclassifications on site and situational factors, two of the primary components of spatial <b>decision-making</b> <b>procedures.</b> Direct comparisons are made between the BASE layer and the comparative land cover data layers. A series of multi-criteria evaluation procedures using the BASE layer and the four comparative data layers as input concludes this research. The output from the spatial <b>decision-making</b> <b>procedure</b> using the BASE layer is directly compared with the same spatial <b>decision-making</b> <b>procedure</b> using each of the comparative land cover data layers as input. Differences between the BASE layer and the comparative land cover data layers are then assessed to determine if errors and misclassifications have had an impact on the output of the spatial <b>decision-making</b> <b>procedures.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: It {{is argued}} that the European Union did not perform well in the former Yugoslavia. This paper {{addresses}} the issue whether the EU should have opted for a different course, given the complex nature of the conflict that tore apart the nations inhabiting the former Yugoslavia. In {{order to understand the}} conflict what has {{to be taken into account}} are historical, political, economic and social factors. Being an international organisation of sovereign states, it was not easy for the EU to intervene in Yugoslavia and to stop the civil war. The European Political Co-operation process failed to reach the objectives the EU had set out, while the Common Foreign and Security Policy had yet to be devised. It could be asked whether the EU had been better equipped for dealing with international conflicts since the ratification of the Treaty of Amsterdam? The Treaty of Amsterdam reinforces the <b>decision-making</b> <b>procedures</b> and structures, but does not address the defence issues properly. While the situation in the former Yugoslavia remains precarious, the future response of the EU may depend on the way its <b>internal</b> <b>decision-making</b> process is reformed.

40|$|According to the neo-corporatist {{approach}} to the “problem of compliance,” worker control over union policy is incompatible with centralized wage regulation, because only associations in which national leaders are insulated from their members are capable of delivering rank-and-file acceptance of wage moderation.
