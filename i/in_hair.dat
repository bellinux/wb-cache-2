50|$|Two {{types of}} pigment give hair its color: eumelanin and pheomelanin. Pheomelanin colors hair orange and red. All humans have some pheomelanin <b>in</b> their <b>hair.</b> Eumelanin, which has two subtypes of black or brown, determines the {{darkness}} of the hair color. A low concentration of brown eumelanin results <b>in</b> blond <b>hair,</b> whereas a higher concentration of brown eumelanin results <b>in</b> brown <b>hair.</b> High amounts of black eumelanin result <b>in</b> black <b>hair,</b> while low concentrations result <b>in</b> white <b>hair.</b>|$|R

5|$|There are {{two forms}} of the Javan slow loris, {{distinguished}} mainly by differences <b>in</b> <b>hair</b> length.

5|$|Scientists also {{view the}} ability to grow very long hair {{as a result of}} sexual selection, since long and healthy hair is a sign of {{fertility}} and youth. An evolutionary biology explanation for this attraction is that hair length and quality can act as a cue to youth and health, signifying a woman's reproductive potential. As hair grows slowly, long hair may reveal 2–3 years of a person's health status, nutrition, age and reproductive fitness. Malnutrition and deficiencies in minerals and vitamins due to starvation causes loss of hair or changes <b>in</b> <b>hair</b> color (e.g. dark hair turning reddish).|$|E

5|$|Domesticated {{guinea pigs}} occur in many breeds, {{which have been}} {{developed}} since their introduction to Europe and North America. These varieties vary <b>in</b> <b>hair</b> and color composition. The most common varieties found in pet stores are the English shorthair (also known as the American), which have a short, smooth coat, and the Abyssinian, whose coat is ruffled with cowlicks, or rosettes. Also popular among breeders are the Peruvian and the Sheltie (or Silkie), both straight longhair breeds, and the Texel, a curly longhair. Grooming of guinea pigs is primarily accomplished using combs or brushes. Shorthair breeds are typically brushed weekly, while longhair breeds may require daily grooming.|$|E
5|$|The Shetland {{is one of}} the {{smallest}} British breeds. The ewes are usually polled (hornless) and the rams usually horned, although horned ewes and polled rams do occur occasionally. The breed is noted for its very fine, soft wool and the high quality of its meat, though its smaller size limits its use in commercial meat markets. They are small-bodied animals, with some wool on their faces, noses or legs, but not in excess. The legs are of medium length and finely boned. They have small, erect ears. A distinguishing feature of northern short-tailed sheep is the short, fluke-shaped tail, broad at the base, tapering to a point, and covered towards the tip <b>in</b> <b>hair,</b> not wool.|$|E

5|$|The colour of {{the head}} and gaster are black, shading into reddish brown on the clypeus and around the frontal carinae. The mesosoma (alitrunk), node, and legs are brownish-red and light, with the legs {{becoming}} yellowish in certain areas. The antennae and mandibles are brownish yellow, and the teeth have black edges. Overall, M. inquilina can be distinguished from others by its black head and its almost hairless body. Its colour is similar to M. nigriceps, but M. nigriceps is larger and covered <b>in</b> <b>hair,</b> along with a head more rounded than other species. M. inquilina does not have a worker caste, making it a workerless parasite.|$|E
5|$|Mammals are {{a diverse}} class of animals, mostly {{terrestrial}} {{but some are}} aquatic and others have evolved flapping or gliding flight. They mostly have four limbs but some aquatic mammals have no limbs or limbs modified into fins and the forelimbs of bats are modified into wings. The legs of most mammals are situated below the trunk, which is held well clear of the ground. The bones of mammals are well ossified and their teeth, which are usually differentiated, are coated in a layer of prismatic enamel. The teeth are shed once (milk teeth) during the animal's lifetime or not at all, {{as is the case}} in cetaceans. Mammals have three bones in the middle ear and a cochlea in the inner ear. They are clothed <b>in</b> <b>hair</b> and their skin contains glands which secrete sweat. Some of these glands are specialized as mammary glands, producing milk to feed the young. Mammals breathe with lungs and have a muscular diaphragm separating the thorax from the abdomen which helps them draw air into the lungs. The mammalian heart has four chambers and oxygenated and deoxygenated blood are kept entirely separate. Nitrogenous waste is excreted primarily as urea.|$|E
5|$|The largest use {{of calcium}} is in steelmaking, {{due to its}} strong {{chemical}} affinity for oxygen and sulfur. Its oxides and sulfides, once formed, give liquid lime aluminate and sulfide inclusions in steel which float out; on treatment, these inclusions disperse throughout the steel and became small and spherical, improving castability, cleanliness and general mechanical properties. Calcium is also used in maintenance-free automotive batteries, in which the use of 0.1% calcium–lead alloys {{instead of the usual}} antimony–lead alloys leads to lower water loss and lower self-discharging. Due to the risk of expansion and cracking, aluminium is sometimes also incorporated into these alloys. These lead–calcium alloys are also used in casting, replacing lead–antimony alloys. Calcium is also used to strengthen aluminium alloys used for bearings, for the control of graphitic carbon in cast iron, and to remove bismuth impurities from lead. Calcium metal is found in some drain cleaners, where it functions to generate heat and calcium hydroxide that saponifies the fats and liquefies the proteins (for example, those <b>in</b> <b>hair)</b> that block drains. Besides metallurgy, the reactivity of calcium is exploited to remove nitrogen from high-purity argon gas and as a getter for oxygen and nitrogen. It is also used as a reducing agent in the production of chromium, zirconium, thorium, and uranium. It {{can also be used to}} store hydrogen gas, as it reacts with hydrogen to form solid calcium hydride, from which the hydrogen can easily be re-extracted.|$|E

40|$|Four-hundred Holstein cows in 40 {{dairy farms}} in north Greece were {{included}} in this study, and blood (n= 400), black hair (n= 400), white hair (n= 40), and feed (n= 40) samples were obtained. Although the feeding regime in these farms was similar, the selenium content of feeds was variable. The Se content of concentrate feeds was 0. 104 +/- 0. 086 mg/kg dry matter (DM), and of silage, it was 0. 025 +/- 0. 018 mg/kg. A significantly positive correlation {{was found between the}} Se concentration <b>in</b> black <b>hair</b> and the Se concentration in blood (r(2) = 0. 610, p< 0. 001), the Se concentration <b>in</b> white <b>hair</b> and the Se concentration in blood (r(2) = 0. 770, p< 0. 001), and the Se concentration <b>in</b> white <b>hair</b> and the Se concentration <b>in</b> black <b>hair</b> (r(2) = 0. 921, p< 0. 001).

5|$|The {{underwater}} {{scene was}} the first to be shot, and for its filming Stage 16 at Fox Studios was reconstructed into a 36 by 45meter tank, 4.5meters deep, containing 548,000gallons of water. The decision was made to convert the stage rather than film the scene elsewhere, since moving the film crew to the nearest adequate facility in San Diego would have been too costly for a single scene, and by converting Stage 16 20th Century Fox would {{be able to use the}} tank for future films. Because of the aquatic filming, the ability to swim was a prerequisite for cast and crew when signing onto the film. The cast trained in swimming pools in Los Angeles with professional divers to learn how to use the equipment. An additional two and a half weeks of training took place at the studio with stunt coordinator Ernie Orsatti and underwater cinematographer Peter Romano. Weaver, however, was unable to participate in most of the training due to commitments on Broadway. Winona Ryder faced a challenge with the scene, as she had nearly drowned at age 12 and had not been in the water since. She suggested using a body double, but knew that it would be too obvious to audiences due to the difference <b>in</b> <b>hair</b> length. She filmed the scene, but suffered from anxiety on the first day of filming.|$|E
