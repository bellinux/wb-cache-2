5000|$|Tegenaria abchasica {{differs from}} all other known species in the genus Tegenaria by the {{presence}} of two dark spots on the upper surface of the cephalothorax at the junction of the head and thorax. There is also a characteristic pattern on the under surface of the cephalothorax, consisting of a paler central line with a pair of lighter spots on either side (sometimes more than one pair). T. abchasica is variable in size; one female had a carapace of about [...] long and an abdomen of about the same length. The male is somewhat smaller, particularly the abdomen. The longest leg is the fourth, around [...] long in total. The legs have yellow femora with four dark gray-green <b>half</b> <b>rings,</b> yellow patellae, darkened distally (away from the body); yellow tibiae with three <b>half</b> <b>rings</b> coloured as the femora; and brown metatarsi, also with three similar <b>half</b> <b>rings.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{synonymy}} of all Campanian North-American ankylosaurids {{was followed}} for several decades, until {{scientists from the}} University of Alberta began to re-examine the fossils. A 2009 study found that Dyoplosaurus {{is in fact a}} valid taxon, and identified unique characteristics that differentiated it from Euoplocephalus, including its triangular claws. Victoria Arbour (2010) argued that Anodontosaurus (known from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation) is distinct from Euoplocephalus and is also a valid taxon; according to Arbour, Anodontosaurus differs from Euoplocephalus in distinctive skull and cervical <b>half</b> <b>ring</b> ornamentation, as well as tail club morphology, including the presence of pointed, triangular knob osteoderms in Anodontosaurus. Furthermore, Arbour (2010) suggested to reassign all Horseshoe Canyon Formation ankylosaurine specimens from Euoplocephalus to Anodontosaurus. The validity of Anodontosaurus was accepted in two subsequent studies. The first, published by Paul Penkalski and William T. Blows in 2013, re-validated Scolosaurus as well. The second study, by Penkalski (2013), named and described Oohkotokia from Montana on the basis of remains that were originally thought to be referable to Euoplocephalus.|$|E

2500|$|Canadian {{paleontologist}} Lawrence Morris Lambe {{discovered the}} first specimen on 18 August 1897 {{in the area}} of the present Dinosaur Provincial Park, in the valley of the Red Deer River, Alberta, Canada. In 1902, this fossil, CMN 210 (also NMC 210) was designated as the holotype specimen of the type species Stereocephalus tutus. This specimen consists of the upper part of a cranium and a transverse series of five scutes that were part of a cervical <b>half</b> <b>ring.</b> [...] The generic name was derived from Greek στερεός, stereos, [...] "solid", and κεφαλή, kephalè, [...] "head", which refers to the formidable armour. However, the genus name was already preoccupied — the name had already been given to an insect, the beetle Stereocephalus Lynch 1884 — so Lambe changed it to Euoplocephalus in 1910, with as combinatio nova (new combination name) Euoplocephalus tutus. The type species remains Stereocephalus tutus. In 1915, Edwin Hennig classified E. tutus under the genus Palaeoscincus Leidy 1856, coining a Palaeoscincus tutus. Today however, Palaeoscincus is considered to be a nomen dubium based on indeterminate ankylosaurian teeth. In 1964, Euoplocephalus was by Oskar Kuhn referred to Ankylosaurus, as a Ankylosaurus tutus.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a {{modified}} version of the multi-band multiple ring monopole antenna is proposed. The height of the new design which consists of multiple <b>half</b> <b>rings</b> is <b>half</b> of the original one. The modified design is more attractive for low profile applications due to its lower height. The antenna is simulated and measured. It is shown that the simulation and measurement results are in good agreement. The performance of the modified version of the antenna is compared with the original design in terms of input characteristic and far field radiation patterns. It is shown that the multiband behaviour of the modified design is similar to the original one. However, there is a frequency shift between the operating bands of the new and the original antennas. The radiation patterns of the both antennas are similar to the conventional monopole antenna in lower operating frequency bands. However, degradation in radiation patterns of the both antennas is observed as frequency increases...|$|R
