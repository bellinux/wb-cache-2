25|$|In Ten Inny ("The Other"), a {{collection}} of lectures delivered in Vienna, Graz and Cracow, published shortly before his death, Kapuściński laments a state of affairs perpetuated by the myths which inculcate {{the notion of the}} Other as sub-human or non-human. He saw encountering the Other as the main challenge <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>twenty-first</b> <b>century.</b> The posthumously published Ho dato voce ai poveri: dialogo con i giovani ("I Gave a Voice to the Poor: Conversations with the Youth"; Trent, Il Margine, 2007; subsequently published in Poland as Dałem głos ubogim. Rozmowy z młodzieżą; Cracow, Znak, 2008) is a record of Kapuściński's interactions with the students of the University of Bolzano in Italy in October 2006; while Rwący nurt historii. Zapiski o XX i XXI wieku ("In the Whirlpools of History: Jottings on the 20th and the 21st Centuries"; Cracow, Znak, 2007) is a compilation of interviews and lectures, reflecting Kapuściński's training as a historian and dealing with contemporary issues and their historical and cross-cultural parallels (including such issues as globalisation, Islam, the birth of the Third World, and the dawn of the Pacific civilisation).|$|E

2500|$|Boyhood {{also earned}} the admiration of other filmmakers and artists. Director Christopher Nolan named Boyhood as his {{favorite}} film of 2014, calling it [...] "extraordinary". Writer-director Mike Leigh, while accepting a fellowship from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts in 2015, called it [...] "the definitive independent film". Writer Joyce Carol Oates tweeted her support, saying: [...] "It is rare that a film so mimics the rhythms {{and texture of}} actual life as Boyhood. Such seeming spontaneity is a very high art." [...] Poet and critic Dan Chiasson wrote in a contribution to The New York Review of Books: [...] "This is a great film, the greatest American movie I have ever seen in a theater. It is great for what we see, but it is even greater for its way of making real what we cannot see, or for suggesting that what we cannot yet see we might one day see." [...] According to Canadian philosopher Howard Adelman, [...] " [...] is Huckleberry Finn <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>twenty-first</b> <b>century,</b> for it is only Mason Jr. who retains his honesty, integrity and sense of decency throughout ... a masterful movie not to be missed." [...] Alejandro González Iñárritu, winner of the Academy Award for Best Director in 2015 and Linklater's fellow nominee, {{said that when he}} watched Boyhood, he sent an email to Linklater and thanked him for giving [...] "this incredible gift".|$|E
2500|$|The 1988 {{constitution}} incorporates environmental precepts {{that are}} advanced {{compared with those}} of most other countries. At that time, the Chamber of Deputies (Câmara dos Deputados) established its permanent Commission for Defense of the Consumer, the Environment, and Minorities. In 1989 the creation of the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e dos Recursos Naturais Renováveis--Ibama) joined together the federal environment secretariat and the federal agencies specializing in forestry, rubber, and fisheries. In 1990 the administration of Fernando Collor de Mello (president, 1990–92) appointed the well-known environmentalist José Lutzemberger as secretary of the environment and took firm positions on the environment and on Indian lands. In 1992 Brazil played a key role at the Earth Summit, not only as its host but also as negotiator on sustainable development agreements, including the conventions on climate and biodiversity. The Ministry of Environment was created in late 1992, after President Collor had left office. In August 1993, it became the Ministry of Environment and the Legal Amazon and took a more pragmatic approach than had the combative Lutzemberger. However, because of turnover in its leadership, a poorly defined mandate, and lack of funds, its role and impact were limited. In 1995 its mandate and name were expanded to include water resources—the Ministry of Environment, Hydraulic Resources, and the Legal Amazon—it began a process of restructuring to meet its mandate of [...] "shared management of the sustainable use of natural resources." [...] In 1997 the Commission on Policies for Sustainable Development and Agenda 21 began to function {{under the aegis of the}} Civil Household. One of its main tasks was to prepare Agenda 21 (a plan <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>twenty-first</b> <b>century)</b> for Brazil and to stimulate preparation of state and local agendas.|$|E
