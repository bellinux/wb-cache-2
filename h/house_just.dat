Instead, the balloons created were made to be twice Carl's size.

Following a town vote the previous year, Groton station was established at Flannigan's Crossing (Groton-Harvard Road). The station was {{located on the}} southwest corner of the grade crossing, with a freight <b>house</b> <b>just</b> to its west and a woodshed (to supply early wood-burning locomotives) across the tracks.|$|E
5|$|The modern Regent Street is {{the result}} of this redevelopment. No {{original}} structures survive except south of Oxford Circus for some Nash-designed sewers. The current design {{is an example of the}} Beaux Arts approach to urban design: an assembly of separate buildings on a grand scale, designed to harmonise and produce an impressive overall effect. Strict rules governed the reconstruction. Each block had to be designed with a continuous unifying street façade and finished in Portland stone. The first redevelopment was Regent <b>House,</b> <b>just</b> south of Oxford Circus. The stylistic tone for the rebuilding was set by Sir Reginald Blomfield's Quadrant.|$|E
5|$|Before {{leaving the}} next morning, the Doctor stops to ask Emma {{if she could}} sense {{anything}} unusual about Clara, but Emma reveals that Clara seems normal to her. The Doctor offers Hila a lift to any other place in history and concludes {{that she is a}} direct descendant of Emma and Palmer. He reasons that their relation resulted in a blood connection that helped them open the gateway to rescue her. While contemplating the bonds that love can create, the Doctor suddenly realises that there is another creature within Caliburn <b>House.</b> <b>Just</b> as Emma and Palmer were not part of a ghost story but a love story, the Doctor considers the same for the creatures — that the one trapped in the pocket universe has been trying to reunite with its mate. The Doctor asks Emma for a favour and they use Emma and the TARDIS to retrieve the other creature from the pocket universe.|$|E

5|$|Holmes {{was born}} in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on August 29, 1809. His birthplace, a <b>house</b> <b>just</b> north of Harvard Yard, {{was said to have}} been the place where the Battle of Bunker Hill was planned. He was the first son of Abiel Holmes (1763–1837), {{minister}} of the First Congregational Church and avid historian, and Sarah Wendell, Abiel's second wife. Sarah was the daughter of a wealthy family, and Holmes was named for his maternal grandfather, a judge. The first Wendell, Evert Jansen, left the Netherlands in 1640 and settled in Albany, New York. Also through his mother, Holmes was descended from Massachusetts Governor Simon Bradstreet and his wife, Anne Bradstreet (daughter of Thomas Dudley), the first published American poet.|$|E

5|$|The university, {{which is}} built on high ground, served as an {{evacuation}} point and emergency shelter for thousands of flood refugees. The civil defense director of the university expected between 700 and 800 people to take shelter at the university. Between 7,000 and 8,000 showed up as the water rose through August 14 and 15 and crammed into facilities designed to <b>house</b> <b>just</b> over 1,000 students. A helipad {{was set up in}} a parking lot, and helicopters from Eielson Air Force Base ferried supplies to the refugees. Fairbanks' power plant was flooded, so the university depended on its physical plant to provide electricity for the refugees. When the rising water threatened to flood the plant, hundreds of the refugees massed to build barricades and pump out the plant's basement.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} folk {{tales of the}} Tylwyth Teg, the fairy people who {{inhabited}} the area and an invisible land in Cardigan Bay. One tells of a farmer from Aberdaron {{who was in the}} habit of stepping outside his house before retiring to bed. One night he was spoken to by a stranger, who asked why the farmer was annoyed by him. The farmer, confused, asked what the stranger meant and was told to stand with one foot on the stranger's. This he did, and could see another <b>house,</b> <b>just</b> below his own, and that all the farm's slops went down the chimney of the invisible house. The stranger asked if the farmer would move his door {{to the other side of}} the house, which the farmer subsequently did, walling up the original door; from that day, the farmer's livestock flourished, and he became one of the most prosperous men in the area.|$|E

5|$|On {{the death}} of Sir Robert Preston in 1639, Craigmillar passed to a distant cousin, David Preston of Whitehill. His son sold the castle out of the family, and it was bought by Sir John Gilmour (d.1671) in 1660, who {{purchased}} the neighbouring estate of The Inch at the same time. A Royalist, Gilmour was rewarded following the Restoration of King Charles II, becoming Lord President of the Court of Session in 1661. He remodelled the west range to provide more modern accommodation in the 1660s, {{but in the early}} 18th century, the Gilmours left the castle for Inch <b>House,</b> <b>just</b> west of Craigmillar. It was claimed that two of the laird's daughters continued to live in Craigmillar Castle after {{the rest of the family}} had left. Afterwards, Craigmillar Castle formed a romantic feature in the park of the Inch estate. It was ruined by 1775, when the antiquarian and poet John Pinkerton wrote Craigmillar Castle: an Elegy. The castle became a popular tourist attraction from the late 18th century, and was drawn by numerous artists. A proposal to renovate the building for the use of Queen Victoria was put forward in 1842, but came to nothing. Victoria herself visited the castle in 1886, and much restoration work was undertaken by its then owner, Walter James Little Gilmour (d.1887).|$|E

5|$|The column {{had yet to}} {{run into}} any American troops when they reached Howard's Tavern (also known as Howard's Half-Way <b>House),</b> <b>just</b> {{a few hundred yards}} from the Jamaica Pass. Tavern keeper William Howard and his son William Jr. were forced to act as guides to show the British the way to the Rockaway Foot Path, an old Indian trail that skirted the Jamaica Pass to the west (located today in the Cemetery of the Evergreens). Five minutes after leaving the tavern, the five American militia {{officers}} stationed at the pass were captured without a shot fired, as they thought that the British were Americans. Clinton interrogated the men and they informed him that they were the only troops guarding the pass. By dawn, the British were through the pass and stopped so that the troops could rest. At 09:00, they fired two heavy cannons to signal the Hessian troops below Battle Pass to begin their frontal assault against Sullivan's men deployed on the two hills flanking the pass, while Clinton's troops simultaneously flanked the American positions from the east.|$|E
