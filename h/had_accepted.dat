5|$|Brundage {{took the}} {{position}} that as the Germans had reported nondiscrimination to the IOC, and the IOC <b>had</b> <b>accepted</b> that report, US Olympic authorities were bound by that determination. Nevertheless, it became increasingly apparent that with the Nazi actions, no Jew was likely to secure {{a place on the}} German team. Brundage stated on this issue that as only 12Jews had ever represented Germany in the Olympics, it would hardly be surprising if none did in 1936.|$|E
5|$|By the 2000s, {{adherents of}} {{prosperity}} theology in the United States were {{most common in}} the Sun Belt. In the late 2000s, proponents claimed that {{tens of millions of}} Christians <b>had</b> <b>accepted</b> prosperity theology. A 2006 poll by Time reported that 17 percent of Christians in America said they identified with the movement. There is no official governing body for the movement, though many ministries are unofficially linked.|$|E
5|$|Coolbrith never resumed {{the work}} of writing the history, as {{she was unable to}} balance its revelatory autobiographical truth with the scandal that would then ensue. In her life, there were rumors that she <b>had</b> <b>accepted</b> men such as Harte, Stoddard, Clemens and Miller as {{occasional}} lovers—a book discussing these liaisons was one she considered too controversial.|$|E

In 1966, Fischer {{narrowly}} {{missed the}} individual gold medal, scoring 88.23% to World Champion Tigran Petrosian's 88.46%, {{even though he}} played four games more than Petrosian, faced stiffer opposition, and would have won the gold if he <b>had</b> <b>accepted</b> Florin Gheorghiu's draw offer, rather than declining it and suffering his only loss.|$|E
5|$|Abd al-Malik desisted {{from further}} {{attempts}} to seize Iraq following the debacle at Khazir, and instead focused on winning over disaffected tribal chieftains throughout the province. It {{was not until}} 690/91 that Abd al-Malik launched a major invasion of Iraq, personally leading an army whose command was largely staffed by the caliph's family, including Muhammad ibn Marwan, Khalid ibn Yazid and Abd Allah ibn Yazid. By then, many of Iraq's ashraf <b>had</b> <b>accepted</b> Umayyad sovereignty, and following the Umayyad victory in the Battle of Maskin, in which both Mus'ab and Ibn al-Ashtar were slain, Umayyad rule in Iraq was reestablished.|$|E
5|$|After a slow start, {{in early}} 1942, Cascade {{began to take}} effect. As early as May, Axis {{intelligence}} began to overestimate Allied strength by nearly 30%. In July the operation expanded. Clarke introduced more and more fictitious divisions {{and by the end}} of the year the Germans <b>had</b> <b>accepted</b> many of them as real formations. By 1944, when the operation was superseded, it had completely fooled the enemy. Cascade was a major success for Clarke; it supported most of the subsequent major deceptions for the remainder of the war (by providing established fictional units) and proved that deception on a grand scale was a realistic strategy.|$|E

Shortly after receiving his commission acceptance letter, his local bishop asked him to serve as a counselor in the bishopric. Time conflicts with bishopric meetings would have made Navy service impossible. After discussion with church apostle Harold B. Lee (his former stake president), Monson declined the commission and applied for a discharge. The Navy granted his discharge in the last group processed before the Korean War. Lee set him apart six months later as a bishop—mentioning in the blessing that he likely would not have been called if he <b>had</b> <b>accepted</b> the commission.|$|E
5|$|An item of {{discussion}} between the production staff was over who would rescue Rose; Davies and Julie Gardner wanted Pete to rescue her, while Clarke and Phil Collinson wanted Mickey. The role was ultimately given to Pete, to emphasise that he <b>had</b> <b>accepted</b> Rose {{as a surrogate}} daughter. The Doctor's intended reply to Rose was also discussed; Davies, who left the reply unspecified, stated he didn't know when asked by Collinson on the episode's commentary track, and Gardner vehemently believed the Doctor would reciprocate Rose's love.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{in early}} 1973, Agnew was {{investigated}} by the United States Attorney for the District of Maryland on suspicion of conspiracy, bribery, extortion and tax fraud. Agnew <b>had</b> <b>accepted</b> payments from contractors during his time as a Maryland official, and the payments had continued into his time as vice president. After denying his guilt for months, Agnew negotiated a plea agreement that would involve his resignation from office. On October 10, 1973, Agnew pled no contest to a single felony charge of tax evasion, resigned his office, {{and was replaced by}} House Minority Leader Gerald Ford. Agnew spent the remainder of his life quietly, rarely making public appearances. He wrote a novel, and also a memoir defending his actions. He died in 1996.|$|E

5|$|Blaine and Harrison {{wished to}} see American power and trade {{expanded}} across the Pacific and were {{especially interested in}} securing rights to harbors in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and Pago Pago, Samoa. When Blaine entered office, the United States, Great Britain, and the German Empire were disputing their respective rights in Samoa. Thomas F. Bayard, Blaine’s predecessor, <b>had</b> <b>accepted</b> {{an invitation to a}} three-party conference in Berlin aimed at resolving the dispute, and Blaine appointed American representatives to attend. The result was a treaty that created a condominium among the three powers, allowing all of them access to the harbor.|$|E
5|$|Conant (1929) gave a {{detailed}} account of the feeding behavior of a captive specimen from South Carolina. When prey was introduced, the snake quickly became attentive and made an attack. Frogs and small birds were seized and held until movement stopped. Larger prey was approached in a more cautious manner; a rapid strike was executed after which the snake would withdraw. In 2.5 years, the snake <b>had</b> <b>accepted</b> three species of frogs, including a large bullfrog, a spotted salamander, water snakes, garter snakes, sparrows, young rats, and three species of mice. Brimley (1944) described a captive specimen that ate copperheads (A. contortrix), as well as members of its own species, keeping its fangs embedded in its victims until they had been immobilized.|$|E
5|$|Darwin {{published}} {{his theory of}} evolution with compelling evidence in his 1859 book On the Origin of Species, overcoming scientific rejection of earlier concepts of transmutation of species. By the 1870s, the scientific community {{and much of the}} general public <b>had</b> <b>accepted</b> evolution as a fact. However, many favoured competing explanations and {{it was not until the}} emergence of the modern evolutionary synthesis from the 1930s to the 1950s that a broad consensus developed in which natural selection was the basic mechanism of evolution. Darwin's scientific discovery is the unifying theory of the life sciences, explaining the diversity of life.|$|E
