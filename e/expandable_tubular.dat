50|$|<b>Expandable</b> <b>tubular</b> {{technology}} is a system for increasing {{the diameter of the}} casing or liner of an oil well by up to 30% after it has been run down-hole.|$|E
40|$|Some of the {{challenges}} being faced by the petroleum development industry worldwide are low-cost and more efficient well completion, water-shutoff, other types of zonal isolation, etc. Successfully addressing these issues, solid <b>expandable</b> <b>tubulars</b> (SETs) are finding increasing use for enhanced oil recovery from difficult or damaged wells. All SET applications revolve around cold expansion of the tubular in a casing or in an open hole, by hydraulically pushing a cone through the tubular, or by mechanically pulling it. Issues such as maximum expansion ratio, post-expansion pipe integrity, etc are directly linked with material properties of the tubular before and after expansion. An SET expansion test rig has been designed, fabricated, and commissioned at the Engineering Research Lab, Sultan Qaboos University (SQU) in collaboration with Petroleum Development Oman (PDO). Various types of material testing and characterization equipment augment this facility. The current paper presents some results from an ongoing study about comparison of pre and post-expansion mechanical properties of the tubular material subjected to different expansion ratios. Material properties specifically addressed here are elastic modulus, yield strength, tensile strength, fracture stress, fracture strain, and ductility...|$|R
40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringThis thesis aims to give {{a general}} insight into sand control and various sorts of sand control {{measures}} and applications of sand control tools. Special focus {{will be given to}} expandable sand screens – a technology which came about in the late 1990 ’s through the use of flexible, <b>expandable</b> <b>tubulars</b> as base pipe in sand screens. More specifically Darcy’s Hydraulic Endurance Screens, a compliant sand screen system using hydraulic activation, and the future use of these will be discussed. This technology has been successfully deployed in a test rig environment(System Integration Test) 14 and was planned to be field tested for Statoil on the Statfjord field(Well B- 03) 14, an operation which eventually was delayed as the 9 5 / 8 “ casing above the reservoir could not be cemented due to heavy losses. Insight will be given into possible future use of the Hydraulic Endurance screens - specifically in water injector wells. Sand control {{is one of the key}} aspects to be considered when planning the completion of a well. Sand control tools may not always be necessary in a well - at least not from the start – and whether or not these are to be installed is one of the first things that need to be decided on. However, in poorly consolidated or unconsolidated sandstone reservoirs sand production is one of the biggest challenges for the completion and production engineers and some sort of sand control tools will almost always have to be installed at some point during the wells lifecycle. These tools or sand control methods may include, but are not limited to, slotted or pre-drilled liners, gravel packs, frac packs, selective perforations, oriented perforations or as mentioned above, different types of sand screens. All of these sand control measures and their use will be discussed. In water injectors, sand production poses certain specific challenges. These challenges usually arise not during the actual water injection, but when for various reasons the injection has to be stopped and the well is shut-in. These “water injector”-specific challenges include reservoir cross-flow between formation layers of different permeability, the “water hammer” phenomenon, well-to-well backflow, thermal fractures and gravel loss into fracture systems. If one or more of these factors come into play, sand production may be initiated and a situation where the injection well is filled with sand may be the case. It is the aim of this thesis to discuss and analyze whether or not the Darcy’s Hydraulic Endurance Screens may solve or improve on these challenges in water injectors and how they compare to the Open Hole Gravel Pack and the Stand Alone Screen, specifically with a possible use at the Johan Sverdrup field in mind. A theoretical case of a field installation of Darcy’s Hydraulic Endurance Screens in a water injector well at the Johan Sverdrup field will be presented. It was found that Darcy’s Hydraulic Endurance Screen is a fully viable alternative to Open Hole Gravel Packs and Stand Alone Screens in water injector wells. It is particularly well suited for the Johan Sverdrup field as the innovative utilization of a solid base pipe together with a compliant screen design enables among other things injection selectivity with the possibility of future shut-off, integration of Inflow Control Devices and easier filter cake removal - factors that may be vital in the two-zone reservoir encountered at the Johan Sverdrup field. Uncertainties with the Hydraulic Endurance screens mostly relate to the lack of experience running the system...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Spinal schwannomas are benign nerve sheath tumors. Completely {{extradural}} schwannomas of the lumbar spine {{are extremely}} rare lesions, accounting for only 0, 7 – 4, 2 % of all spinal NSTs.

40|$|The use {{of solid}} <b>expandable</b> <b>tubular</b> {{technology}} {{during the last}} decade has focused on solving many challenges in well drilling and delivery including zonal isolation, deep drilling, conservation of hole sizes, etc. not only as pioneered solution but also providing cost effective and long lasting solutions. Concurrently, the technology was extended for construction of multilateral in typical wells. The process of horizontal tubular expansion is similar to the vertical expansion of <b>expandable</b> <b>tubular</b> in down-hole environment with the addition of uniformly distributed force due to its weight. The expansion is targeted to increase its diameter such that post expansion characteristics remain within allowable limits. In this study a typical <b>expandable</b> <b>tubular</b> of 57. 15 mm outer diameter and 6. 35 mm wall thickness was used with two different elastomer seals of 5 and 7 mm thickness placed at equal spacing of 200 mm. The developed stress contours during expansion process clearly showed the high stress areas in the vicinity of expansion region which lies around the mandrel. These high stresses may result in excessive wear of the mandrel. It was also found out that the drawing force increases as the mandrel angle, expansion ratio, and friction coefficient increases. A mandrel angle of 20 o  requires minimum expansion force and can be considered as an optimum geometrical parameter to lower the power required for expansion...|$|E
40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringBP’s Skarv {{field is}} a stacked three layer {{reservoir}} structure. The field development plan involves drilling deviated and horizontal wells into the uppermost reservoir layer, Garn, and the lowermost reservoir layer, Tilje. Above Garn {{is a high}} pressure zone, that requires 1. 59 sg mud weight to be drilled. When Garn {{have proven to be}} a strong formation, the overburden and Garn is drilled as one section in Skarv drilling phase 1 to reach Tilje. A 9 7 / 8 ” shoe is set in top Tilje and the reservoir section in Tilje is drilled with an 8 ½” bit and left open hole and completed with gravel pack. The drainage strategy involves pressure support in Tilje, hence Garn will deplete with a faster rate. In phase 2 Garn will have depleted to an extent that drilling with 1. 59 mud will become a to large overbalance regarding differential sticking issues. The 9 7 / 8 ” shoe must therefore be set in top Garn. Due to the low pressure in Garn, Garn must be sealed off before drilling Tilje to avoid crossflow from Tilje into Garn. Garn and Ile, the middle sand, will be drilled with an 8 ½” bit. Traditionally a 7 ” liner will be set between top Garn and top Tilje. This will give a slim hole solution in the Tilje reservoir section which can lead to insufficient gravel packing resulting in hole collapse. It was proposed that expandable liner could be the solution to maintain an 8 ½” hole in Tilje. Available solutions for Skarv have been identified and Expandable liners from two vendors, Enventure GT’s SET® open hole liner and Baker Hughes linEXX™ monobore liner have been analyzed in StressCheck for installation, drilling and production loads an expandable liner could possible need to endure through the life off the well. Skarv’s J- 4 well, Skarv basis of design, Skarv casing design, NORSOK and BP internal regulations are used to set up a model in StressCheck. <b>Expandables</b> are special <b>tubulars</b> that are expanded down hole by mechanically or hydraulically pushing or pulling a cone or mandrel through the tubular. beyond the yield point, permanently deforming the pipe. When undergoing such expansion the mechanical properties of the pipes are changed. To gain a complete picture of what load scenarios the expandable must endure, the expandables were modeled both as pre- and post expanded. The analysis includes five different pressure regimes and four different mud weights as drilling and displacement fluids. Pressure regimes were calculated based on the expected depletion rate in Garn and mud weight were calculated based on minimum required mud weight in relation to well stability. Output from the analysis are safety factors, SF. For Skarv, minimum required SF for burst and collapse loads are 1. 10 and 1. 00 for collapse. In general, the limiting factor for an expandable is the collapse strength. The results however show that the limiting factors for depleted Garn is related to the burst loading, when the liners internal pressure which is the weight of the mud and the applied surface pressure, as in a pressure test, will exceed the low external reservoir pressure. For the 7. 625 X 9 7 / 8 ” SET® liner, the minimum SF was 0. 93 for burst and 2. 35 for collapse. For the 8. 625 X 10 3 / 4 ” SET® liner, the minimum SF was 0. 88 for burst and 2. 02 for collapse. For linEXX™ liner was 0. 73 for burst and 1. 32 for collapse. For all cases it was the high test pressure and injection pressures that casued the low SF. The internal pressure in a well is the pressure that can be controlled, which propose that expandables are a god solution for depleted reservoirs. By designing the well parameters to ensure the liners burst limit will not be exceeded, by e. g. tailor making the mud weight, expandable liner can be installed in Skarv wells. The expandables are not easily modeled in StressCheck when it proved challenging to ensure the correct properties are input for the pre- and post-expanded pipes and combining the two. For StressCheck to be a reliable tool for expandables, vendor should supply exact numbers or a range for both the pre-and post-expansion properties as the input variables required in StressCheck.

ISR was defined as > 50 % diameter narrowing in stent. ResultsEighty symptomatic patients (64 male, mean age 72 years) with 90 lesions treated with balloon <b>expandable</b> <b>tubular</b> coronary stents were enrolled. There were 34 patients with 38 short lesions (length≤ 5 mm, group 1), 37 patients with 42 medium lesions (length> 5 mm, < 10 mm, group 2) and 9 patients with 10 long lesions (length≥ 10 mm, group 3). Eighty seven bare-metal stents and 3 drug-eluting stents were implanted. Repeat angiography was done in 40 lesions (44 %) at 11. 7 ± 9. 6 months. The ISR rate in group 1, 2, 3 is 21 %, 29 %, and 50 % (p= 0. 486).

40|$|Purpose: The {{ever-increasing}} {{energy demand}} has forced researchers {{to search for}} new and cheaper solutions {{for oil and gas}} production. The recent development of solid expandable tubulars (SETs) has resulted in design of slim oil and gas wells. The large plastic deformation experienced by the tubular under down-hole environment may result in premature and unexpected failures. The objective of this research is to investigate the structural integrity of SET for well applications to avoid such failures. Design/methodology/approach: In order to achieve the objectives, simulation work was carried out using finite element method and experimental tests were conducted on full size tubular for validation of numerical results. Findings: The required drawing force for expansion under different expansion ratios, surplus deformation, variations in tubular thickness and length were estimated numerically and experimentally. The differences in values using two approaches vary from 5 % to 12 %. Tubular wall thickness decreases as the mandrel angle, expansion ratio, and friction coefficient increase. Research limitations/implications: The issue of maximum expansion a tubular can be subjected to needs to be further investigated. Furthermore, the pre and post-expansion material properties need immediate attention of researchers to fulfil the dream of low-cost expandable solution. Practical implications: In recent years, solid <b>expandable</b> <b>tubular</b> technology has already made significant inroads in replacing conventional telescopic oil wells. It allows design and realization of slim wells, accessing difficult and ultra-deep reservoirs, well remediation, zonal isolation, drilling of directional and horizontal wells, etc. Originality/value: SET is an emerging technology for oil and gas industry. The current findings are very valuable for researchers and well engineers to design slim wells and enhance the productivity of older wells...|$|E

This prospective, randomized, single center trial aimed to compare a blunt splitting transmuscular {{approach to the}} interlaminar window with the subperiosteal microsurgical technique. Two experienced surgeons performed first time lumbar microdiscectomy on 125 patients. The type of approach and retractor used was randomized and both patients and evaluator were blinded to it. In 59 patients a speculum-counter-retractor was inserted through a subperiosteal (SP) route and in 66 patients an <b>expandable</b> <b>tubular</b> retractor was introduced via a transmuscular (TM) approach. In both groups the mean age was 51  years, the male gender prevalent (61 %) {{and the distribution of}} the operated levels was similar. The outcome measures were VAS for back and leg pain, ODI and the postoperative analgesic consumption was scored by the WHO 3 -class protocol. A postsurgical VAS (0 – 1) was defined as excellent, VAS (2 – 4) as satisfactory result. In this study the patients scored from 1 to 3 points daily according to the class of drugs taken. Furthermore, a 1 / 3 point (class 1), 2 / 3 point (class 2) and 1 point (class 3) was added for each on-demand drug intake. Recovery from radicular pain was excellent (SP 68 %, TM 76 %) or satisfactory (SP 23 %, TM 21 %). Recovery from back pain was excellent (SP 58 %, TM 59 %) or satisfactory (SP 37 %, TM 37 %). Postoperative mean improvement ODI was: SP 29 % and TM 31 %. Postoperative mean analgesic intake: SP 4. 8 points, TM 2. 6 points (P =  0. 03).

40|$|Fossil {{hydrocarbons}} are indispensables commodities that motorize {{the global}} economy, {{and oil and}} gas are two of those conventional fuels that have been extracted and processed for over a century. During last decade, operators face challenges discovering and developing reservoirs commonly found up to several kilometers underground, for which advanced technologies are developed through different research programs. In order to optimize the current processes to drill and construct oil/gas wells, {{a large number of}} mechanical technologies discovered centuries ago by diverse sectors are implemented by well engineers. In petroleum industry, the ancient tube forming manufacturing process founds an application once well engineers intend to produce from reservoirs that cannot be reached unless previous and shallower troublesome formations are isolated. Solid <b>expandable</b> <b>tubular</b> is, for instance, one of those technologies developed to mitigate drilling problems and optimize the well delivery process. It consists of in-situ expansion of a steel-based tube that is attained by pushing/pulling a solid mandrel, which permanently enlarge its diameters. This non-linear expansion process is strongly affected by the material properties of the tubular, its geometry, and the pipe/mandrel contact surface. The anticipated force required to deform long sections of the pipe in an uncontrollable expansion environment, might jeopardize mechanical properties of the pipe and the well structural integrity. Scientific-based solutions, that depend on sound theoretical formulation and are validated through experiments, will help to understand possible tubular failure mechanisms during its operational life. This work is aimed to study the effect of different loading/boundary conditions on mechanical/physical properties of the pipe after expansion. First, full-scale experiments were conducted to evaluate the geometrical and behavioral changes. Second, simulation of deformation process was done using finite element method and validated against experimental results to assess the effects on the post-expansion tubular properties. Finally, the authors bring a comparison study where in a semi-analytical model is used to predict the force required for expansion...|$|E
