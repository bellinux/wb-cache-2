500|$|Frank Spotnitz was {{assigned}} writing duties for [...] "Nisei", which was {{originally intended to}} be a stand-alone mythology story and to air as the seventh episode of the third season. However, as Spotnitz developed his script, the episode hit several logistical snags. Most notably, Spotnitz's script featured several scenes filmed on trains: Chris Carter explained, [...] "We <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were going to have some trouble shooting with trains." [...] Eventually, the sheer scope of the episode caused co-executive producer R. W. Goodwin so much trouble that he wanted to scrap the story. Spotnitz explained, [...] "Goodwin called Chris and said, 'This is unproducable. [...] you've got to throw out the script, basically.' I was devastated, and Chris [...] 'Let's make it a two-parter.'" [...] So, the episode was bumped back to number nine and was lengthened to a two parter, resulting in it being delayed several weeks.|$|E

I've never blamed Rodney for this creative 'falling out' nor do I blame myself. Not all creative relationships click, ours didn't {{in the long}} run." ...|$|E
2500|$|In December 2012, in an {{interview}} with Rap-Up, T.I. shared details about his collaboration with singer-songwriter Pink on the T-Minus-produced [...] "Guns and Roses," [...] which he describes as a [...] "bittersweet romantic story." [...] "We <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had a few things in common," [...] says T.I. of the pop-rocker. [...] "We clicked. She real people, she from the streets. I’m a real cat, I’m from the streets. We found ourselves in rooms where we were like, ‘You know what? These people fake as hell in here. Let’s get out of here.’" [...] In a listening session at NYC's Germano Studios, where T.I. played ten songs from the album for industry tastemakers and label executives, he stated he had big hopes for the song.|$|E

2500|$|Gunther {{had been}} {{asleep on the}} {{mainland}} across Humboldt Bay from the Island and had woken up to what he thought were screams, but went back to sleep. [...] The next morning he was awakened by the Justice of the Peace who went with Gunther to inspect the Island following reports that Indians had been killed. He was appalled by what he saw, recalling “ …what a sight presented itself to our eyes. Corpses lying all around, and all women and children, but two. Most of them had their skulls split. One old Indian, who {{looked to be a}} hundred years old, had his skull split, and still he sat there shivering”. Gunther initially desired to bring the guilty to justice, but learned [...] "We soon <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had better keep our mouths shut." ...|$|E
6000|$|But, after a while, we <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> could think, {{could act}} for ourselves, as we never {{expected}} to do. We <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were no more children; that we were improving in manly virtues by having to bear our own burdens; and to acquire, ...|$|E

30|$|As the {{simulation}} results show, <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> when <b>we</b> adjusted the power level to 2 or 3, {{we could get}} acceptable performance. If the power level was more than 3, the lifetime performance was better.|$|R
30|$|To {{find the}} reason for this we filmed a number of {{examinations}} and <b>found</b> out <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were {{spending a lot of time}} informing the patient and inserting a cannula with the patient lying in the CT device.|$|R
3000|$|Immediately {{after its}} {{discovery}} {{it was observed}} that G [...] is infinitely presented. Then, Lysenok <b>found</b> a presentation <b>that</b> <b>we</b> recall below.|$|R
60|$|Involuntarily I had glanced {{to see if}} Captain West was on the poop, and <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{were hidden}} from the poop by the 'midship house.|$|E
6000|$|... "Beggars {{must not}} be choosers, you know, Colonel Osborne. I felt a little {{disappointed}} when I <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were not to see them till February next." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Even if we <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> moved, {{relatively}} to {{the clouds}} below us, {{that would only}} show that this upper current was somewhat different from that below." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{no doubt}} you meant it simply. We Americans think {{ourselves}} sharp, but I have long since <b>found</b> out <b>that</b> <b>we</b> may meet more than our matches over here. I think we will go back. Mother means {{to try to get}} up a quadrille." ...|$|R

60|$|I {{looked at}} the carriage-clock and <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had been already {{an hour and a}} quarter on our journey. From the furious pace at which we were {{travelling}} we must have come nearly fifteen miles.|$|E
6000|$|... "Splendidly. We had {{a meeting}} of the A.V.I.S. last Friday night and <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had plenty of money subscribed to paint the hall and shingle the roof too. MOST people gave very liberally, Mr. Harrison." ...|$|E
60|$|We were {{a little}} uneasy, however, when we found it snowed one whole day and a night so fast <b>that</b> <b>we</b> could not travel; but he bid us be easy; we should soon be past it all: <b>we</b> <b>found,</b> indeed, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> began to descend every day, and to come more north than before; and so, {{depending}} upon our guide, we went on.|$|R
60|$|I {{was in my}} {{old place}} at the Coliseum this morning, {{and it was as}} grand as ever. With that {{exception}} the ruined part of Rome--the real original Rome--looks smaller than my remembrance made it. It is the only place on which I have yet <b>found</b> <b>that</b> effect. <b>We</b> are in the old hotel.|$|R
60|$|We pitched {{our little}} camp here, {{and sat down}} to our repast; for I <b>found</b> <b>that</b> though <b>we</b> were to go back to lodge, yet my patron had taken care we should be {{furnished}} sufficiently for dinner, and have a good house to eat it in, that is to say, a tent as before.|$|R
60|$|We were silent, and, {{upon the}} {{reflection}} to which our silence invited us, we <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{would rather not}} ourselves think of the image we had invoked. We preferred {{to take up the}} question at another point.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then, I {{went and}} got the quadrant,--that's the thing they do it with,--and I took an observation, and I <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were in {{latitude}} 15° north, 90° east, exactly where we had been twenty-four hours before! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{they came}} here and tried to turn the tables on us; but we had the Zulus {{and some of the}} scouts out. When they <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were watchful they decamped. Now, Carmichael, go in with your party and get a cup of tea." ...|$|E
5000|$|In January 2010, Lt. Matthew Stapleton of the Petaluma Police Department {{credited}} {{the sting}} operation with scaring potential predators away from Petaluma. Referring to later decoy operations by local police, Stapleton said, [...] "As {{soon as they}} <b>found</b> out <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were from the Petaluma area, they completely cut off communication with us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, sir," [...] Bob said. [...] "It won't {{make any}} {{difference}} about the thrashing; we are bound to get <b>that.</b> But <b>we</b> shan't mind <b>that,</b> <b>we</b> are pretty well accustomed to it. Still, if you speak for us, I expect we shall get off with that; otherwise I don't know what Tulloch would have done, when he <b>found</b> out <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had been slipping out at night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Anyhow, we'll {{never be}} parted again," [...] said Margaret happily. [...] "Fir Cottage is your home henceforth, Freda. Oh, how rich I am. I have got {{somebody}} who really belongs to me. And I owe {{it all to}} Dr. Forbes. If he hadn't suggested you coming here, I should never have <b>found</b> out <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were cousins." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear aunt, pray say nothing. We {{had thought}} when we knew little {{of each other}} that it would suit us to live together. As we learnt each other's {{characters}} more thoroughly, we <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had been wrong. It was better for us, therefore, to part; and we did part." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope, then," [...] {{said the}} captain carelessly, [...] "that {{it may be}} <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have had a proper watch on our charge, Colonel Howard; I think you told me the windows were too high for an escape in that direction, for I had no {{sentinel}} outside of the building." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That might spoil her sailing, {{and as soon}} as he <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were in chase of him, {{he would}} at once suspect that {{something}} was wrong. That would, of all things, be the worst, especially if he found--which would be just as likely as not--that he had the legs of us.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. We {{have fought}} many obstinate wars {{with the nation}} lying on the {{mainland}} opposite to us, and our men have beaten theirs when they have outnumbered us many-fold; but at present we are at peace. <b>We</b> <b>found</b> <b>that,</b> while <b>we</b> could beat them in battle, we could not continue to hold a country that lay separated from us by the sea." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Someone in the {{laboratory}} was smoking a pipe, and the pipe smoke rose in a column above the superconducting disc. So we placed a ball-shaped magnet above the disc, attached to a balance. The balance behaved strangely. We substituted a nonmagnetic material, silicon, and still the balance was very strange. <b>We</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> any object above the disc {{lost some of its}} weight, and <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> if <b>we</b> rotated the disc, the effect was increased." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The 1st Brigade {{remained}} {{at the top of}} the pass, while its baggage mules moved up. The path was so bad that only a few mules reached the top that night. It was afterwards <b>found</b> <b>that,</b> if <b>we</b> had taken the path, we should have suffered most severely; as it was discovered that the walls of the sangars had been perforated with lateral slits, commanding every turn.|$|R
