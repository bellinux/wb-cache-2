For better {{resistant}} to erosion, material was <b>hardfaced</b> by Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) by using solid wire electrode and flux cored wire electrode under same welding conditions. The substrate steel <b>hardfaced</b> with flux cored wire electrode resulted in high microhardness as compare to solid wire electrode. The erosion study was conducted, using an air jet erosion test rig at a particle velocity of 50 m/s. Ductile erosion behavior is observed in the case when the substrate steels is <b>hardfaced</b> with solid wire whereas brittle erosion behavior is observed when the substrate steels is <b>hardfaced</b> with flux cored wire. At a low angle of impingement, the abrasive type cutting is the dominating factor for material removal, and at a higher angle of impingement, impact-type as well as abrasive-type cutting actions play critical roles. Plastic deformation characterized by pitting and cutting action was also observed. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) technique was used to analyze the eroded surface. It was concluded that damaged surfaces of Pulverized coal burner nozzle material can be successfully <b>hardfaced</b> and improvement in erosion resistance was observed. ...|$|E

Shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) process were used to deposite all (<b>hardfaced</b> layer and SS layers) layers. The fabricated joints were evaluated for its ballistic performance, and the results were compared with respect to depth of penetration (DOP) on weld metal and heat-affected zone (HAZ) locations. From the ballistic test results, it was observed that both the joints successfully stopped the bullet penetration at weld center line. Of the two joints, the joint made with CrC <b>hardfaced</b> interlayer (CAHA) offered better ballistic resistance at weld metal. This is because its hardness is higher due to the presence of primary carbides of needle shape, polyhedral shape and eutectic matrix containing a mixture of γ + M 7 C 3 carbides in the CrC <b>hardfaced</b> interlayer. The scattering hardness level in the WC interlayer, the matrix decomposition resulted lower hardness and the co-existence of δ ferrite in the interface between hardfacing and SS root/SS cap could be attributed to the inferior ballistic resistance of the joint made with WC <b>hardfaced</b> interlayer (WAHA joint) ...|$|E

Part of this research addresses the friction that occurs at the interface between the valve disc and the valve body seats during operation of a gate valve. In most gate valves, these surfaces are <b>hardfaced</b> with Stellite 6, a cobalt-based alloy. The nuclear industry has developed methods to analytically predict the thrust needed to operate these valves at specific pressure conditions.

Design/methodology/approach: The layers were made by cladding technique. Cladding was conducted witha high power diode laser HDPL ROFIN SINAR DL 020 and Plasma Transformed Arc method. The subsequenttracks were overlapped by 30 ÷ 40 %. The performance of the <b>hardfaced</b> materials were evaluated by microstructure(optical and scanning electron microscope SEM), chemical analysis and micro hardness measurements. Findings: After heat treatment the microstructure of the clad layers did not change much, neither on the top partnor in the clad/steel interface. However the oxide layer on the surface is observed. The EDS analyze revile thecomposition of this scale which consisted generally of chromium and iron oxides. The semi-quantitative chemicalanalysis (EDS) of the dendritic regions and micro regions confirms changes in chemical contents before and afteroxidation and after corrosion in exhaust gases. The oxidation at temperature 750 °C for 200 hours in air and fortwo month in exhaust gases did not influence on the morphology of the clad layers neither on the top part nor inthe clad/steel interface. However changes in chemical composition were observed. On the surface of both sort ofclads the oxide layers were observed. These sorts of layers are resistant for the hot exhausted gases.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{four sets}} of tests sponsored by the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and conducted by the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory. The tests support research addressing {{the need to provide}} assurance that motor-operated valves are able to perform their intended safety function, usually to open or close against specified (design basis) flow and pressure loads. One of the parameters that affects a gate valve's operability is the friction between the disc seats and the valve body seats. In most gate valves, these surfaces are <b>hardfaced</b> with Stellite 6, a cobalt-based alloy. The tests described in this report investigate the changes that occur in the friction as the Stellite 6 surfaces develop an oxide film as they age. Stellite 6 specimens were aged in a corrosion autoclave, the oxide films were examined and characterized, and the specimens were subjected to friction testing in a friction autoclave. A very thin oxide film formed after only a fe w days of natural aging. Even a very thin oxide film caused an increase in friction. The surface structure of the oxide film was dominated by a hard crystalline structure, such that the friction response was analogous to rubbing two pieces of sandpaper together. In the limited data provided by naturally aged specimens (78 days maximum exposure, very thin oxide films), the friction increased with greater aging time, approaching an as-yet-undetermined plateau. Although the thickness of the oxide film increased with greater aging time, the mechanical properties of the oxide film (larger granules with greater aging time) appeared to play a greater role in the friction response. Friction testing of specimens subjected to simulated in-service testing strokes at intervals during the aging process showed only a slight decrease in friction, compared to other specimens. Results from specimens subjected to accelerated aging were inconclusive, because of differences in the structure and comp osition of the oxide films, compared to naturally aged specimens. For the naturally aged specimens, the highest friction occurred on the first stroke. The first stroke smeared the oxide film and dislodged some of the granules, so that subsequent strokes saw lower friction values and less variation in the friction. This result underscores the importance of planning in-plant tests so that data are collected from the first stroke following a period of inactivity...|$|E

Intermediate Heat Exchanger (IHX) is a shell and tube type, counter current, sodium to sodium heat exchanger. IHX is a very important, massive, over dimensional (∼ 42 tones in weight, ∼ 2 meters in diameter and ∼ 18 meters in length) and critical component of reactor, as it transfers heat from the radioactive primary circuit sodium to non-radioactive secondary circuit sodium forming the boundary between these two circuits. The principal material of construction of IHX is austenitic stainless steel grade 316 LN. Each IHX has 3600 nos. of straight seamless tubes which are rolled and then welded to the either ends of top and bottom tubesheets by autogenous pulsed Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) process. The shell welding around the tube bundle is extremely difficult and challenging task due to small gap between the tube bundle and shell inside diameter. Special arrangements were made to avoid arc strike or fusion on the tube during shell welding around the tube bundle. A mechanical <b>hardfaced</b> seal arrangement at the interface of the IHX outer shell and the inner vessel stand pipe is the chosen design concept to ensure leak tightness in the IHX penetrations. Based on radiation dose rate & shielding considerations during maintenance, handling and decommissioning, nickel based ENiCr-B hard facing alloy (Colmonoy- 5) was chosen to replace the traditionally used cobalt based stellite alloys to improve the resistance to high temperature wear, especially galling of mating surfaces in sodium environment. The more versatile Plasma Transferred Arc Welding (PTAW) and Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) were used for deposition of Colmonoy- 5. The hardfacing on the seal ring is really challenging task, as the diameter is too large and thickness & width is too small and which has hardfacing on all mating surfaces. Extensive varieties of trials were conducted on the mockup to optimize the hardfacing process along with heat treatment cycle to obtain minimum distortion deploying special tools and fixtures. Intermediate Heat Exchanger involves 10 mm and 28 mm thick borated stainless steel components around the tube bundle and bottom portion confirming to ASTM 887, Type 304 B 4, Grade B classification to reduce the radiation level in secondary sodium system while flowing through the IHX. Various types of welding trials were conducted on the test coupons for welding procedure qualification of borated stainless steel components using versatile grades of welding consumables. More than hundred nos. of trial coupons welded using 10 varieties of welding consumables have shown fissures and cracks in weld, as these welding consumables found not having good compatibility with SS 304 B 4, Grade B borated steel.
