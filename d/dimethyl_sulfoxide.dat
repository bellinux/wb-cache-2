5|$|A {{reversible}} surgical method {{under investigation}} is reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance (RISUG) {{which consists of}} injecting a polymer gel, styrene maleic anhydride in <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulfoxide,</b> into the vas deferens. An injection with sodium bicarbonate washes out the substance and restores fertility. Another is an intravas device which involves putting a urethane plug into the vas deferens to block it. A combination of an androgen and a progestin seems promising, as do selective androgen receptor modulators. Ultrasound and methods to heat the testicles have undergone preliminary studies.|$|E
5|$|DMSO {{is widely}} used as an {{alternative}} to water because it has a lower dielectric constant than water, and is less polar and so dissolves non-polar, hydrophobic substances more easily. It has a measurable pKa range of about 1 to 30. Acetonitrile is less basic than DMSO, and, so, in general, acids are weaker and bases are stronger in this solvent. Some pKa values at 25°C for acetonitrile (ACN) and <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulfoxide</b> (DMSO) are shown in the following tables. Values for water are included for comparison.|$|E
5|$|Optimum {{growth of}} E. coli occurs at 37°C (98.6°F), but some {{laboratory}} strains can multiply at temperatures up to 49°C (120°F). E. coli {{grows in a}} variety of defined laboratory media, such as lysogeny broth, or any medium that contains glucose, ammonium phosphate, monobasic, sodium chloride, magnesium sulfate, potassium phosphate, dibasic, and water. Growth can be driven by aerobic or anaerobic respiration, using a large variety of redox pairs, including the oxidation of pyruvic acid, formic acid, hydrogen, and amino acids, and the reduction of substrates such as oxygen, nitrate, fumarate, <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulfoxide,</b> and trimethylamine N-oxide. E. coli is classified as a facultative anaerobe. It uses oxygen when it is present and available. It can, however, continue to grow in the absence of oxygen using fermentation or anaerobic respiration. The ability to continue growing in the absence of oxygen is an advantage to bacteria because their survival is increased in environments where water predominates.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dimethyl</b> <b>sulfoxide</b> {{can produce}} an {{explosive}} reaction {{when exposed to}} acyl chlorides; at a low temperature, this reaction produces the oxidant for Swern oxidation.|$|E
25|$|The {{spectrum}} of biological effects of <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulfoxide</b> (DMSO) and MSM differ, {{but those of}} DMSO may be mediated, at least in part, by MSM.|$|E
25|$|The {{compound}} Fe(COT)2, when refluxed in toluene with <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulfoxide</b> and dimethoxyethane for 5 days, {{is found}} to form magnetite and crystalline carbon also containing carbon nanotubes.|$|E
25|$|Deuterium oxide {{is often}} used {{as the source of}} {{deuterium}} for preparing specifically labelled isotopologues of organic compounds. For example, C-H bonds adjacent to ketonic carbonyl groups can be replaced by C-D bonds, using acid or base catalysis. Trimethylsulfoxonium iodide, made from <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulfoxide</b> and methyl iodide can be recrystallized from deuterium oxide, and then dissociated to regenerate methyl iodide and <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulfoxide,</b> both deuterium labelled. In cases where specific double labelling by deuterium and tritium is contemplated, the researcher must be aware that deuterium oxide, depending upon age and origin, can contain some tritium.|$|E
25|$|For {{red blood}} cells, the optimum cooling rate is very rapid (nearly 100°C per second), whereas for stem cells the optimum cooling rate is very slow (1°C per minute). Cryoprotectants, such as <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulfoxide</b> and glycerol, {{are used to}} protect cells from freezing. A variety of cell types are {{protected}} by 10% <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulfoxide.</b> Cryobiologists attempt to optimize cryoprotectant concentration (minimizing both ice formation and toxicity) and cooling rate. Cells may be cooled at an optimum rate to a temperature between 30 and 40°C before being plunged into liquid nitrogen.|$|E
25|$|Other more {{convenient}} or less toxic reagents for oxidizing alcohols include <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulfoxide,</b> {{which is used}} in Swern and Pfitzner–Moffatt oxidations, and hypervalent iodine compounds, such as the Dess–Martin periodinane.|$|E
25|$|Azathioprine is {{synthesized}} from 5-chloro-1-methyl-4-nitro-1H-imidazole and 6-mercaptopurine in <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulfoxide</b> (DMSO). The {{synthesis of}} the former starts with an amide from methylamine and diethyl oxalate, which is then cyclizised and chlorinated with phosphorus pentachloride; the nitro group is introduced with nitric and sulfuric acid.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{property of}} solvents is the boiling point. This also determines {{the speed of}} evaporation. Small amounts of low-boiling-point solvents like diethyl ether, dichloromethane, or acetone will evaporate in seconds at room temperature, while high-boiling-point solvents like water or <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulfoxide</b> need higher temperatures, an air flow, or the application of vacuum for fast evaporation.|$|E
25|$|A {{solution}} of DCC and <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulfoxide</b> (DMSO) effects the so-called Pfitzner-Moffatt oxidation. This procedure {{is used for}} the oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes and ketones. Unlike metal-mediated oxidations, the reaction conditions are sufficiently mild to avoid over-oxidation of aldehydes to carboxylic acids. Generally, three equivalents of DCC and 0.5 equivalent of proton source in DMSO are allowed to react overnight at room temperature. The reaction is quenched with acid.|$|E
25|$|Other skin {{damaging}} {{methods used}} to increase nanoparticle penetration include tape stripping, skin abrasion, and chemical enhancement. Tape stripping is the process in which tape is applied to skin then lifted to remove {{the top layer of}} skin. Skin abrasion is done by shaving the top 5-10 micrometers off the surface of the skin. Chemical enhancement is the process in which chemicals such as polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulfoxide</b> (DMSO), and oleic acid are applied {{to the surface of the}} skin to increase permeability.|$|E
25|$|The {{potential}} {{toxicity of}} DMF has received considerable attention. It is not classified as human carcinogen (A4), {{but it is}} thought to cause birth defects. In some sectors of industry, women are banned from working with DMF. For many reactions, it can be replaced with <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulfoxide.</b> Most manufacturers of DMF list 'Life' or 'Chronic' as a health hazard in their MSDS since DMF is not readily disposed of by the body. According to IARC, DMF is not classified as to its carcinogenicity to humans, and the United States Environmental Protection Agency does not consider it a cancer risk.|$|E
25|$|Many oxidating agents {{can be used}} as {{alternatives}} to oxoammonium oxidants. Activated manganese dioxide, which is able to oxidize only allylic, benzylic, or other activated positions, is cheaper than TEMPO and operationally simple to use. Chromium-based reagents such as pyridinium chlorochromate {{can also be used to}} convert alcohols to carbonyl compounds; although the mechanism of chromium oxidations is well understood, the stoichiometric generation of chromium wastes is a disadvantage of this class of oxidants. Oxidations employing <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulfoxide,</b> such as the Swern and Moffatt reactions, involve no heavy metals and oxidize a wide variety of substrates. However, the unpleasant odor generated during these reactions (dimethyl sulfide) is often cited as a disadvantage. Oxoammonium oxidations are preferred to DMSO methods for reactions of diols and acetylenic alcohols. Dess-Martin periodinane is a highly selective, mild oxidant of alcohols, whose primary disadvantages are difficulties with preparation and safety.|$|E

2500|$|It {{was first}} {{synthesized}} in 1866 by the Russian scientist Alexander Zaytsev, who reported his findings in 1867. [...] <b>Dimethyl</b> <b>sulfoxide</b> is produced industrially from dimethyl sulfide, {{a by-product of}} the Kraft process, by oxidation with oxygen or nitrogen dioxide.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{also used}} for the {{decomposition}} of organic ozonides to ketones and aldehydes, although dimethyl sulfide is more popular for the reaction as the side product, <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulfoxide</b> is more readily separated from the reaction mixture than triphenylphosphine oxide.

2500|$|<b>Dimethyl</b> <b>sulfoxide</b> (DMSO) is an {{organosulfur}} compound {{with the}} formula (CH3)2SO. [...] This colorless liquid {{is an important}} polar aprotic solvent that dissolves both polar and nonpolar compounds and is miscible {{in a wide range}} of organic solvents as well as water. [...] It has a relatively high melting point. [...] DMSO has the unusual property that many individuals perceive a garlic-like taste in the mouth after contact with the skin.|$|E
2500|$|Simple NMR spectra are {{recorded}} in solution, and solvent protons {{must not be}} allowed to interfere. [...] Deuterated (deuterium = 2H, often symbolized as D) solvents especially for use in NMR are preferred, e.g. deuterated water, D2O, deuterated acetone, (CD3)2CO, deuterated methanol, CD3OD, deuterated <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulfoxide,</b> (CD3)2SO, and deuterated chloroform, CDCl3. However, a solvent without hydrogen, such as carbon tetrachloride, CCl4 or carbon disulfide, CS2, may also be used.|$|E
2500|$|MSM and the {{corresponding}} sulfoxide, <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulfoxide</b> ((CH3)2SO, or DMSO), have different physical properties. MSM is a white crystalline solid at room temperature (m.p. = 109°C) whereas DMSO is typically a liquid (m.p. = 19°C). The sulfoxide is a highly [...] polar aprotic solvent and is miscible with water; {{it is also an}} excellent ligand. MSM is less reactive than DMSO because the S-atom of the sulfone is already in its highest oxidation state (VI). Indeed, oxidation of the sulfoxide produces the sulfone, both under laboratory conditions and metabolically.|$|E
2500|$|A {{variation}} of the static method is to add a solution of the substance in a non-aqueous solvent, such as <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulfoxide,</b> to an aqueous buffer mixture. Immediate precipitation may occur giving a cloudy mixture. The solubility measured for such a mixture is known as [...] "kinetic solubility". The cloudiness {{is due to the}} fact that the precipitate particles are very small resulting in Tyndall scattering. In fact the particles are so small that the particle size effect comes into play and kinetic solubility is often greater than equilibrium solubility. Over time the cloudiness will disappear as the size of the crystallites increases, and eventually equilibrium will be reached in a process known as precipitate ageing.|$|E
2500|$|The key labware or testing vessel of HTS is the microtiter plate: a small container, usually {{disposable}} {{and made}} of plastic, that features a grid of small, open divots called wells. In general, modern (circa 2013) microplates for HTS have either 384, 1536, or 3456 wells. These are all multiples of 96, reflecting the original 96-well microplate with spaced wells of 8 x 12 9mm [...] Most of the wells contain test items, depending {{on the nature of}} the experiment. These could be different chemical compounds dissolved e.g. in an aqueous solution of <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulfoxide</b> (DMSO). The wells could also contain cells or enzymes of some type. (The other wells may be empty or contain pure solvent or untreated samples, intended for use as experimental controls.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Currently, {{there is}} no cure for Urbach–Wiethe disease {{although}} there are some ways to individually treat many of its symptoms. [...] There has been some success with oral <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulfoxide</b> (DMSO) and intralesional heparin, but this is not true in all cases. D-penicillamine has also shown promise, but has yet to have been used extensively. [...] There are also some reports of patients being treated with etretinate, a drug typically prescribed to treat psoriasis. In some cases, calcifications in the brain can lead to abnormal electrical activity among neurons. [...] Some patients are given anti-seizure medication to help deal with these abnormalities. [...] Tracheostomy is often used to relieve upper respiratory tract infections. Carbon dioxide laser surgery of thickened vocal cords and beaded eyelid papules have improved these symptoms for patients. [...] The discovery of the mutations of the ECM1 gene has opened the possibility of gene therapy or a recombinant EMC1 protein for Urbach–Wiethe disease treatment, but neither of these two options are currently available.|$|E
