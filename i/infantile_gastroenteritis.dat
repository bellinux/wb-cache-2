40|$|Abstract. Four {{gnotobiotic}} calves with intestinal lesions {{induced by}} {{third and fourth}} calf passages of the virus of human <b>infantile</b> <b>gastroenteritis</b> were studied by light microscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, and by immunofluorescence. Calves, 25 - 72 hours old, were examined 0. 5 hours, 3 hours, 7 hours, and 48 hours after the onset of diarrhea. Intestinal histology of infected calves was {{compared to that of}} two noninoculated gnotobiotic calves 48 and 72 hours old. The sequence of events in the small intestine was infection of the absorptive villous epithelial cells, replacement of the tall columnar villous epithelial cells with cuboidal and squamous cells, shortening of the villi, enlargement of reticular cells, lymphocytic infiltration of the villous lamina propria and repair. The association of a reovirus-like agent (also called orbivirus [11, orbivirus-like 121, rotavirus [5], duovirus [3] and <b>infantile</b> <b>gastroenteritis</b> virus [E l) with acute human <b>infantile</b> <b>gastroenteritis</b> in several countries [2, 6, 8, 9, 161 has stimulated investigations for finding animal models for the disease.

40|$|Pregnant cows were {{successfully}} hyperimmunized with all four human rotavirus serotypes, {{resulting in a}} 100 -fold increase in neutralizing milk antibody titers over those of controls. Milk antibodies were isolated batchwise from 1, 000 kg of pooled milk for the first 10 lactation days, yielding 10 kg of freeze-dried milk immunoglobulin concentrate consisting of 50 % bovine milk immunoglobulins. Milk immunoglobulin concentrate showed neutralizing activities against all four human rotavirus serotypes that were 100 times higher than those in pooled human milk samples and 10 times higher than those in a commercial pooled immunoglobulin preparation from pooled human blood serum. In vitro neutralization tests showed that milk immunoglobulin concentrate had powerful antiviral activity, even against very high doses of infectious rotaviruses. Because the technology of the milk immunoglobulin concentrate ensures that it is innocuous {{and can be used}} for oral application, it is proposed that milk immunoglobulin concentrate be used to induce passive immunity to <b>infantile</b> rotavirus <b>gastroenteritis...</b>|$|R
40|$|Astroviruses are {{a leading}} cause of <b>infantile</b> viral <b>gastroenteritis</b> worldwide. Very {{little is known about the}} {{mechanisms}} of astrovirus-induced diarrhea. One reason for this is the lack of a small-animal model. Recently, we isolated a novel strain of astrovirus (TAstV- 2) from turkeys with the emerging infectious disease poult enteritis mortality syndrome. In the present studies, we demonstrate that TAstV- 2 causes growth depression, decreased thymus size, and enteric infection in infected turkeys. Infectious TAstV- 2 can be recovered from multiple tissues, including the blood, suggesting that there is a viremic stage during infection. In spite of the severe diarrhea, histopathologic changes in the intestine were mild and there was a surprising lack of inflammation. This may be due to the increased activation of the potent immunosuppressive cytokine transforming growth factor beta during astrovirus infection. These studies suggest that the turkey will be a useful small-animal model with which to study astrovirus pathogenesis and immunity...|$|R
40|$|International audience: Group A {{rotavirus}}es, {{members of}} the Reoviridae family, are {{a major cause of}} <b>infantile</b> acute <b>gastroenteritis.</b> The rotavirus genome consists of 11 double-stranded RNA segments. In some cases, an RNA segment is replaced by a rearranged RNA segment, which is derived from its standard counterpart by partial sequence duplication. It has been shown that some rearranged segments are preferentially encapsidated into viral progenies after serial passages in cell culture. Based on this characteristic, a reverse genetics system was previously used to introduce exogenous segment 7 rearrangements into an infectious rotavirus. This study extends this reverse genetics system to RNA segments 5 and 11. Transfection of exogenous rotavirus rearranged RNA segments 5 or 11 into cells infected with a wild-type helper rotavirus (bovine strain RF), resulted in subsequent gene rearrangements in the viral progeny. Whilst recombinant viruses were rescued with an exogenous rearranged segment 11, the exogenous segment was modified by a secondary rearrangement. The occurrence of spontaneous rearrangements of wild-type or exogenous segments is a major hindrance to the use of this reverse genetics approach...|$|R

40|$|It is {{not entirely}} {{possible}} to prevent hospital cross-infection in <b>infantile</b> <b>gastroenteritis</b> {{by the use of}} conventional barrier-nursing techniques, even with experienced staff in well-designed wards. An incident of double cross-infection due to enteropathic Esch. coli types O 119 and O 126 and the measures that were taken to control it are described. The type O 119 infections were clinically severe, and the cases showed significant levels of serum antibody to the organism, while the type O 126 infections were clinically mild and no antibody was produced. The use of the antibiotic colistin, to which both organisms were originally sensitive, may have been of some value in clearing the type O 119 infection but was without effect on the type O 126 infection, which continued to spread during treatment. A degree of resistance to colistin was found in some strains of the type O 126 organism isolated after treatment. The outbreaks largely ended spontaneously, but may have been limited in extent by the administrative measures described.

40|$|International audienceRotaviruses are {{the leading}} cause of <b>infantile</b> viral <b>gastroenteritis</b> worldwide. Mature enterocytes of the small {{intestine}} infected by rotavirus undergo apoptosis, and their replacement by less differentiated dividing cells probably leads to defective absorptive function of the intestinal epithelium, which, in turn, contributes to osmotic diarrhea and rotavirus pathogenesis. Here we show that infection of MA 104 cells by the simian rhesus rotavirus strain RRV induced caspase- 3 activation, DNA fragmentation, and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; all three phenomena are features of apoptosis. RRV induced the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytosol, indicating that the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway was activated. RRV infection of MA 104 cells activated Bax, a proapoptotic member of the Bcl- 2 family, as revealed by its conformational change. Most importantly, Bax-specific small interfering RNAs partially inhibited cytochrome c release in RRV-infected cells. Thus, mitochondrial dysfunction induced by rotavirus is Bax dependent. Apoptosis presumably leads to impaired intestinal functions, so our findings contribute to improving our understanding of rotavirus pathogenesis at the cellular level...|$|R

40|$|International audienceGroup A rotaviruses (RV), {{members of}} the Reoviridae family, are {{a major cause of}} <b>infantile</b> acute <b>gastroenteritis.</b> The RV genome {{consists}} of 11 double-stranded RNA segments. In some cases, an RNA segment is replaced by a rearranged RNA segment, which is derived from its standard counterpart by partial sequence duplication. We report here a reverse genetics system for RV based on the preferential packaging of rearranged RNA segments. Using this system, wild-type or in vitro-engineered forms of rearranged segment 7 from a human rotavirus (encoding the NSP 3 protein), derived from cloned cDNAs and transcribed in the cytoplasm of COS- 7 cells with the help of T 7 RNA polymerase, replaced the wild-type segment 7 of a bovine helper virus (strain RF). Recombinant RF viruses (i. e., engineered monoreassortant RF viruses) containing an exogenous rearranged RNA were recovered by propagating the viral progeny in MA- 104 cells, with no need for additional selective pressure. Our findings offer the possibility to extend RV reverse genetics to segments encoding nonstructural or structural proteins for which no potent selective tools, such as neutralizing antibodies, are available. In addition, the system described here is the first to enable the introduction of a mutated gene expressing a modified nonstructural protein into an infectious RV. This reverse genetics system offers new perspectives for investigating RV protein functions and developing recombinant live RV vaccines containing specific changes targeted for attenuation...|$|R

40|$|To better {{understand}} the pathogenesis of <b>infantile</b> viral <b>gastroenteritis,</b> we studied Na+ and Cl- fluxes in vitro in short-circuited jejunal epithelium from 8 - 10 -day-old piglets after infection with a standard dose of human rotavirus given via nasogastric tube. 11 infected piglets, all of whom became ill, were compared with 9 uninfected, healthy litter-mates. When killed 72 h after infection, intestinal villi were shorter and crypts deeper (P less than 0. 025) in duodenum, upper jejunum, and mid-small intestine, but not ileum in infected piglets. Virus antigen was seen by fluorescence microscopy in occasional jejunal villus tip cells in only four infected piglets and no controls at 72 h. Net Na+ and Cl- fluxes {{did not differ from}} noninfected litter-mate controls under basal conditions, but response to glucose was blunted in infected piglets (P less than 0. 001). Theophylline stimulated net Cl- secretion in both infected and control animals, and cyclic AMP concentration in isolated jejunal villus enterocytes did not differ significantly. In isolated jejunal villus enterocytes of infected piglets, thymidine kinase activity increased (P less than 0. 001), and sucrase activity decreased (P less than 0. 001). We conclude that in this invasive enteritis caused by a major human viral pathogen, glucose-coupled Na+ transport is impaired in the jejunum {{at a time when the}} villus epithelium shows enzyme characteristics of crypt epithelium, and when little or no virus is present. These findings are identical to those occurring in an invasive coronavirus enteritis of piglets but differ markedly from those seen with enterotoxigenic diarrhea...|$|R
40|$|Rotavirus is a {{major cause}} of <b>infantile</b> viral <b>gastroenteritis.</b> Rotavirus nonstructural protein 4 (NSP 4) has {{pleiotropic}} properties and functions in viral morphogenesis as well as pathogenesis. Recent reports show that the inhibition of NSP 4 expression by small interfering RNAs leads to alteration of the production and distribution of other viral proteins and mRNA synthesis, suggesting that NSP 4 also affects virus replication by unknown mechanisms. This report describes studies aimed at correlating the localization of intracellular NSP 4 in cells with its functions. To be able to follow the localization of NSP 4, we fused the C terminus of full-length NSP 4 with the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and expressed this fusion protein inducibly in a HEK 293 -based cell line to avoid possible cytotoxicity. NSP 4 -EGFP was initially localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as documented by Endo H-sensitive glycosylation and colocalization with ER marker proteins. Only a small fraction of NSP 4 -EGFP colocalized with the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) marker ERGIC- 53. NSP 4 -EGFP did not enter the Golgi apparatus, in agreement with the Endo H sensitivity and a previous report that secretion of an NSP 4 cleavage product generated in rotavirus-infected cells is not inhibited by brefeldin A. A significant population of expressed NSP 4 -EGFP was distributed in novel vesicular structures throughout the cytoplasm, not colocalizing with ER, ERGIC, Golgi, endosomal, or lysosomal markers, thus diverging from known biosynthetic pathways. The appearance of vesicular NSP 4 -EGFP was dependent on intracellular calcium levels, and vesicular NSP 4 -EGFP colocalized with the autophagosomal marker LC 3. In rotavirus-infected cells, NSP 4 colocalized with LC 3 in cap-like structures associated with viroplasms, the site of nascent viral RNA replication, suggesting a possible new mechanism for the involvement of NSP 4 in virus replication...|$|R
40|$|As the {{shortage}} of fresh water {{becomes more and more}} critical, alternative sources are being sought. The reuse of wastewater has become a viable option, particularly for agriculture and landscaping. However, the possible presence of the enteric pathogens, especially viruses, in wastewater has created concern about potential health risks associated with this practice. If wastewater is used for irrigation it may contaminate vegetable crops which are commonly eaten raw. Also, it may contaminate grass used for golf courses, school yards, and playgrounds where more people may be exposed. Rotaviruses may be of particular concern since they are a cause of <b>infantile</b> diarrhea and <b>gastroenteritis</b> in adults and have been a cause of waterborne disease outbreaks. No information, however, is available about the dissemination and survival of rotaviruses on uncooked food and landscaped areas. This information is necessary in developing criteria for determining safe uses of wastewater for crop irrigation. A method was developed for recovery of rotavirus from the surface of vegetables. The simian rotavirus SA- 11, adsorbed onto the vegetable surfaces and effects of various eluents, pH, and exposure time, was evaluated to optimize recovery. The maximum recovery of rotavirus occurred with a solution of 3 % beef extract at pH 8. 0 after 5 minutes of exposure. Survival of rotavirus SA- 11 on lettuce, radishes, and carrots stored at 4 °C and room temperature was evaluated. Rotavirus SA- 11 was able to survive up to 30 days at refrigeration temperatures and up to 25 days at room temperatures. Rotavirus survived longest on lettuce. The survival of coliphage and enteric viruses on grass was studied during winter and summer outdoors. Coliphage, poliovirus, and rotavirus SA- 11 survived on two types of grass during winter and summer from 8 to 40 hours. Human rotavirus survived longer than the other enteric viruses, however, coliphage was more sensitive to inactivation. The occurrence of rotaviruses and enteroviruses in the secondarily treated sewage (activated sludge) was evaluated over a one year period. Total coliforms, pH, and turbidity were also determined.

They were found as the sole recognizable cause of diarrhea in 30 of 416 (7. 2 %) ill children and in 0 of 200 controls. Three additional ill children had enteric adenoviruses {{as a part of}} a dual infection. Evidence for established adenoviruses (Ad 1 through Ad 39) in gastroenteritis was found in 15 of 416 (3. 6 %) ill children but also in 3 of 200 (1. 5 %) controls. Eight adenovirus specimens remained untyped. Seroconversions were demonstrated in 17 of 18 (94 %) paired serum samples from patients shedding enteric adenoviruses. The predominant symptom of infections with enteric adenoviruses was diarrhea, with a mean duration of 8. 6 days (Ad 40) and 12. 2 days (Ad 41). One-third of the children with Ad 41 infections had prolonged symptoms (greater than or equal to 14 days). The frequency of respiratory symptoms was low (21 %).

These properties include haemolysin production, which has a high incidence in strains causing urinary-tract infections (Dudgeon, Wordley and Bawtree, 1921; Vahlne, 1945); necrotoxin production, which is associated with haemolysin production and is found in certain serotypes (Sjostedt, 1946); cytotoxicity in tissue culture, closely associated with the production of soluble haemolysin (Chaturvedi et al., 1969); production of large amounts of K antigen by strains infecting the kidney (Glyn, Brumfitt and Howard, 1971); and production of mucinase (ROSS, 1959) and of enterotoxin (Taylor, Maltby and Payne, 1958) by strains causing <b>infantile</b> <b>gastroenteritis.</b> Because of the evidence that carriage of E. coli round the external urethral meatus may be important in the pathogenesis of infection of the urinary trac...|$|E
