5|$|The Democratic {{party was}} badly divided over the parimutuel betting issue {{as well as}} prohibition, and a {{severance}} tax on coal. The prohibitionist and anti-gambling faction of the Democratic Party—with the help of Louisville Courier-Journal editor Robert Worth Bingham—united to make former governor and senator J. C. W. Beckham the party's gubernatorial nominee. Following Beckham's nomination, many pro-gambling and anti-prohibition Democrats <b>hurried</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> support of Sampson. Sitting Democratic governor William J. Fields, who had been elected {{with help from the}} Jockey Club, was very passive in the campaign and refused to support Beckham.|$|E
5|$|Brueys then {{anchored}} his fleet in Aboukir Bay, {{ready to}} support Napoleon if required. Nelson meanwhile {{had crossed the}} Mediterranean again in a fruitless attempt to locate the French and had returned to Naples to re-provision. He sailed again, intending to search the seas off Cyprus, but decided to pass Alexandria again for a final check. In doing so his force captured a French merchant ship, which provided the first news of the French fleet: they had passed south-east of Crete a month before, heading to Alexandria. Nelson <b>hurried</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> port but again found it empty of the French. Searching along the coast, he finally discovered the French fleet in Aboukir Bay on 1 August 1798.|$|E

50|$|A minivan {{transporting}} {{ordinary citizens}} is stopped on a Burundian dirt road. With force {{a band of}} Hutu rebels armed with Kalashnikovs get the passengers off. The rebel leader barks:"Hutus <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left, Tutsis <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right!".

5|$|While an undergraduate, she {{did some}} {{practice}} {{teaching at the}} Chinese high school in town shortly before graduating in 1952. She had won a scholarship to study music at the Philippine Women's University under Maestra Adoracion Reyes, {{a close friend of}} Imelda's cousin, Loreto Romualdez Ramos. She had a job at a music store but left this for a better one at the Central Bank. Straight from the Central Bank, she <b>hurried</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> University every day. After a few lessons, Adoracion was convinced Imelda had talent and persuaded her to enroll at the College of Music and Fine Arts at PWU, under a special arrangement that would put her on register while Adoracion would continue to give her free lessons.|$|E
5|$|The Transylvanian peasants {{had already}} been outraged because of the {{increase}} of existing seigneurial duties and taxes {{and the introduction of}} new taxes during {{the first decades of the}} century. The bishop also tried to collect the tithe from the petty noblemen and from Orthodox Vlachs who had settled in parcels abandoned by Catholic peasants. In the spring of 1437, Hungarian and Vlach commoners, poor townspeople from Kolozsvár (now Cluj-Napoca in Romania) and petty noblemen started to assemble on the flat summit of Mount Bábolna near Alparét (Bobâlna) where they set up a fortified camp. The bishop and his brother, Roland Lépes, the deputy of the voivode (or royal governor) of Transylvania, gathered their troops to fight against the rebels. The voivode, the two counts of the Székelys and many Transylvanian noblemen also <b>hurried</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mountain to assist them against the rebels.|$|E
5|$|After some time, the king's {{designated}} successor, Andriambonimena, {{launched a}} retaliatory {{attack against the}} prince's half-brother Andrianentoarivo at Ambohipotsy and successfully chased him from his fief. Andriantomponimerina {{recognized the need to}} take more dramatic action to consolidate his grip on power and sent a messenger to the Sakalava king requesting his support. The Sakalava reaffirmed their loyalty to Andriamasinavalona, however, and threatened to attack the prince if the rightful king was not released from his captivity. According to one version of the oral history, having failed to use the king as a pawn to gain power, the prince decided to ransom his father for 7,000 piastres to increase his personal wealth. Every citizen of Imerina was obligated to contribute, and those who had no money sold their children or themselves into slavery in order to raise the necessary funds. The money was placed in seven baskets and transported by dugout canoe to the prince at Ambohidratrimo, who released the king. According to another version of the story, Prince Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana of Ambohimanga sent two hunters of the Tsimahafotsy clan to free the king by digging an escape passage under the wall of his heavily guarded enclosure. After returning to Antananarivo, Andriamasinavalona sent a messenger who announced that the king had decided to hand power to Andriantomponimerina and invited the prince to the capital to be enthroned. The prince <b>hurried</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> palace, and throughout the city he was greeted with cheers, singing and dancing. When Andriamasinavalona received him, however, he publicly condemned the prince and stripped him of his rank and power.|$|E

50|$|Chaves {{then came}} under attack. Augusto Ribeiro de Carvalho <b>hurried</b> <b>to</b> recall <b>the</b> troops {{that he had}} sent out a day earlier; however, he also had local support from the townspeople. 150 {{civilian}} volunteers from Chaves, trained briefly months earlier, <b>hurried</b> <b>to</b> help <b>the</b> authorities against the royalists. The regular soldiers numbered around 100. The battle was one of scattered firing with small arms and casualties were light.

25|$|The {{advantage}} of having two {{is that it}} allows preparation for an emergency. While one of the submersibles is conducting its dive, the other remains at readiness should there be an emergency, needing to be boarded on ship and <b>hurried</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> site of the problem. Such an emergency could include the submersible becoming tangled in fishing nets or entrapped in rocks or debris on the ocean floor. In such cases, the second heads to the rescue. There are also research experiments where it is advantageous to use the two vessels together.|$|E
25|$|After {{reforming}} in a pine thicket, the 19th blazed {{away at the}} Federals {{to their}} front. Lieutenant Wood and other officers picked up rifles and fought alongside the privates {{in an attempt to}} put as much firepower into the fight as they could muster. During this fight, Wood was wounded in the neck by a ball and <b>hurried</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rear, where the wound was diagnosed as minor and dressed. Wood was soon sent back into the fight, although the scar from the wound remained visible {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
25|$|When Loki, the mischief-maker, {{heard of}} this, {{he made a}} magical spear from this plant (in some later versions, an arrow). He <b>hurried</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> place where the gods were indulging in their new pastime of hurling objects at Baldr, which would bounce off without harming him. Loki gave the spear to Baldr's brother, the blind god Höðr, who then {{inadvertently}} killed his brother with it (other versions suggest that Loki guided the arrow himself). For this act, Odin and the giantess Rindr gave birth to Váli who grew to adulthood within a day and slew Höðr.|$|E

25|$|At about 14:00, the Nawab's army ceased the cannonade {{and began}} turning back north to their entrenchments, leaving St. Frais and his {{artillery}} without support. Seeing the Nawab's forces retiring, Major Kilpatrick, {{who had been}} left {{in charge of the}} British force while Clive was resting in the hunting lodge, recognised the opportunity to cannonade the retiring enemy if St. Frais' position could be captured. Sending an officer to Clive to explain his actions, he took two companies of the 39th Regiment and two field pieces and advanced towards St. Frais' position. When Clive received the message, he <b>hurried</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> detachment and reprimanded Kilpatrick for his actions without orders and commanded to bring {{up the rest of the}} army from the grove. Clive himself then led the army against St. Frais' position which was taken at 15:00 when the French artillery retreated to the redoubt of the entrenchment, setting up for further action.|$|E
25|$|Hoyos did {{not look}} any closer, but rushed to the station and took a special train to Vienna. He <b>hurried</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Emperor's Adjutant General, Count Paar, and {{requested}} him to break the appalling news to the Emperor. The stifling protocol that characterized every movement in the Hofburg swung ponderously into action; Paar remonstrated that only the Empress could break such catastrophic news to the Emperor. Baron Nopcsa, Controller of the Empress's Household, was sent for, and he in turn sent for Countess Ida Ferenczy, Empress Elisabeth's favorite Hungarian lady-in-waiting, to determine how Her Majesty should be informed. Elisabeth was at her Greek lesson, and was impatient at the interruption. White to the lips, Ferenczy announced that Baron Nopcsa had urgent news. Elisabeth replied that he must wait and come back later. The countess insisted {{that he must be}} received immediately, finally being forced to add that there was grave news about the Crown Prince. This account comes from Ferenczy herself and Archduchess Marie Valerie, to whom Elisabeth dictated her memory of the incident, in addition to the description in her diary.|$|E
