25|$|An {{alternation}} not {{triggered by}} sound change was Sievers' law, which caused alternation of suffixal -j- and -ij- {{depending on the}} length of the preceding part of the morpheme. If preceded within the same morpheme by only short vowel followed by a single consonant, -j- appeared. In all other cases, such as when preceded by a long vowel or diphthong, by two or more consonants, or by more than one syllable, -ij- appeared. The distinction between morphemes and words is <b>important</b> <b>here,</b> as the alternant -j- appeared also in words that contained a distinct suffix that in turn contained -j- in its second syllable. A notable example was the verb suffix *-atjaną, which retained -j- despite being preceded by two syllables in a fully formed word.|$|E

(b) Dewey {{never really}} {{intended}} {{his theory of}} experience {{to be a kind}} of epistemological foundationalism, but rather wanted to celebrate the richness and value of immediate experience, including “the immediate dimension of somatic experience” and to emphasize the positive role such experience can play in improving the quality of human life.

2500|$|There {{are several}} types of wordplay used in cryptics. One is {{straightforward}} definition substitution using parts of a word. For example, in one puzzle by Mel Taub, the answer IMPORTANT is given the clue [...] "To bring worker into the country may prove significant". The explanation is that to import means [...] "to bring into the country", the [...] "worker" [...] is a worker ant, and [...] "significant" [...] means <b>important.</b> <b>Here,</b> [...] "significant" [...] is the straight definition (appearing here {{at the end of}} the clue), [...] "to bring worker into the country" [...] is the wordplay definition, and [...] "may prove" [...] serves to link the two. Note that in a cryptic clue, there is almost always only one answer that fits both the definition and the wordplay, so that when one sees the answer, one knows that it is the right answer—although it can sometimes be a challenge to figure out why it is the right answer. A good cryptic clue should provide a fair and exact definition of the answer, while at the same time being deliberately misleading.|$|E

2500|$|The short novel Eine Hand voller Sterne (1987; A Hand Full of Stars), which {{contains}} many autobiographical elements, {{is a good}} example of this. [...] It takes the form of the diary of a Damascene youth, following his progress through school, work, and family life, and featuring the themes of friendship and first love in a difficult situation of social conflict. [...] Without ever appearing didactic, it educates the reader to an awareness of the richness of life in a foreign culture. [...] <b>Important</b> <b>here</b> is the differentiating presentation of the Arab world which militates against the homogeneity of western perceptions. [...] Like the author, the diary-writer stands in the Christian tradition: not all Arabs are Muslims. [...] Cultural diversity in Syria is a key theme in the book, for example in the riddle of the [...] "madman", which can only be solved by the co-operation of all the communities in Damascus. [...] The story [...] "Nuh, mein Freund" [...] ("My Friend Nuh") in the collection Der Fliegenmelker (1985; The Fly Milker) deals with the young man's discovery of an affection for the Kurdish minority.|$|E
2500|$|Note that {{in these}} experiments, the only {{quantity}} that affects {{the result is the}} difference in phase between the two parts of the electron wave. Suppose we imagine the two parts of the electron wave as tiny clocks, each with a single hand that sweeps around in a circle, keeping track of its own phase. Although this cartoon ignores some technical details, it retains the physical phenomena that are <b>important</b> <b>here.</b> If both clocks are sped up by the same amount, the phase relationship between them is unchanged, and the results of experiments are the same. Not only that, but it is not even necessary to change the speed of each clock by a fixed amount. We could change the angle of the hand on each clock by a varying amount θ, where θ could depend on both the position in space and on time. This would have no effect on the result of the experiment, since the final observation of the location of the electron occurs at a single place and time, so that the phase shift in each electron's [...] "clock" [...] would be the same, and the two effects would cancel out. This is another example of a gauge transformation: it is local, and it does not change the results of experiments.|$|E
2500|$|The {{nature in}} which the tail groups {{organize}} themselves into a straight ordered monolayer {{is dependent on the}} inter-molecular attraction, or van der Waals forces, between the tail groups. To minimize the free energy of the organic layer the molecules adopt conformations that allow high degree of Van der Waals forces with some hydrogen bonding. The small size of the SAM molecules are <b>important</b> <b>here</b> because Van der Waals forces arise from the dipoles of molecules and are thus much weaker than the surrounding surface forces at larger scales. The assembly process begins {{with a small group of}} molecules, usually two, getting close enough that the Van der Waals forces overcome the surrounding force. The forces between the molecules orient them so they are in their straight, optimal, configuration. Then as other molecules come close by they interact with these already organized molecules in the same fashion and become a part of the conformed group. When this occurs across a large area the molecules support each other into forming their SAM shape seen in Figure 1. The orientation of the molecules can be described with two parameters: α and β. α is the angle of tilt of the backbone from the surface normal. In typical applications α varies from 0 to 60 degrees depending on the substrate and type of SAM molecule. β is the angle of rotation along the long axis of tee molecule. β is usually between 30 and 40 degrees. In some cases existence of kinetic traps hindering the final ordered orientation has been pointed out. Thus in case of dithiols formation of a [...] "lying down" [...] phase was considered an impediment to formation of [...] "standing up" [...] phase, however various recent studies indicate this is not the case.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{some critics}} viewed the album's sound as unoriginal and dated. Johnny Dee of Virgin Media said [...] "Flesh Tone marks a thrilling {{comeback}} ... The only complaint {{is that at}} 9 tracks it feels a little light." [...] Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquenmani was more critical of Kelis' direction towards dance music, stating that the album [...] "sounds dated in {{the worst kind of}} way—that is, not enough to sound retro-cool, but enough to sound totally uncool. It helps that the album ... segued together with interludes that are more interesting than the actual songs. Flesh Tone should sound desperate, but it often sounds inspired instead. Kelis seems electrified by her new genre shift, and the result is an album that's one of her most consistent to date." [...] Kaya Burgess of The Times pointed out that 'Acapella' and 'Home' are the only tracks which [...] "stand out from an otherwise rather copy-and-paste collection of electronic numbers". Magaret Wappler of Los Angeles Times expressed that Kelis has managed to [...] "make a spirited but disciplined set of classic Euro-club bangers. Sometimes they're darkly contemplative, slipping into trance; other times they nearly rip at the seams ... it's clear that Kelis has carved out a new niche for herself, dancing in front of the turntables till the lights come on, if they dare." [...] Sam Richards of Uncut complimented its fusion of [...] "R sass to thumping club beats" [...] and stated [...] "most everything Kelis touches drips with class". Gavin Haynes of the NME felt that [...] "Flesh Tone has already filled out an application form for pop record of the year" [...] and stated, [...] "Her ability to appear unimpeachably cool hasn't wavered either. But these are as nothing. What's <b>important</b> <b>here</b> is simply her direction: a genuinely innovative bearing that breaks new ground for pop without sounding any less pop for it. Kelis.

It was a branch of the Serbian stock which had climbed into this almost inaccessible eyrie, and thence, for many hundred years, had mocked at the predatory empire of the Turks. The Serbians in their turn were but one branch of the peasant Slavs, millions of whom are spread over Russia and subject on many sides to empires with which they have less sympathy; and the Slavs again, in the broad features which are <b>important</b> <b>here,</b> are not merely Slavonic but simply European.
