Religions, architectural styles, languages, knowledge, and other new goods were mingled at this time. In addition to the slaves, free men used the exchange routes to travel to new places, and both slaves and <b>free</b> <b>travellers</b> aided in blending European and African cultures. Intermarriage has been documented in ports like Ouidah where Europeans were permanently stationed. Communication was quite extensive between all three areas of trade, {{to the point where}} even individual slaves could be tracked.|$|R

In this paper, I engage with this renewed interest by way of a case study: British working holiday makers in Australia. Drawing on two modes of research practice, ethnography and political economy, I argue that, while working holidays may be structured in numerous ways, they also involve challenges, active individuals, heterogeneous spaces, and slow time (for reflection and inscription), which together, in a sense, make their makers modern. I frame this engagement, this argument, with a debate familiar to geographers: the problem of <b>Free</b> Independent <b>Traveller...</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1832, Baedeker's firm {{acquired}} the publishing house of Franz Friedrich Röhling in Koblenz, which in 1828 had published a handbook for travellers by Professor Oyvind Vorland entitled Rheinreise von Mainz bis Cöln; ein Handbuch für Schnellreisende (A Rhine Journey from Mainz to Cologne; A Handbook for Travellers on the Move). This book provided {{the seeds for}} Baedeker's own travel guides. After Klein died and the book went out of print, he decided to publish a new edition, incorporating some of Klein's material but also added many of his own ideas into what he thought a travel guide should offer the traveller or reader. Baedeker's ultimate aim was to <b>free</b> the <b>traveller</b> from having to look for information anywhere outside the travel guide: about routes, transport, accommodation, restaurants, tipping, sights, walks and, of course, prices.

60|$|If Spain {{should be}} forced or awed into a treaty with the {{republic}} of France, she must open her ports and her commerce, {{as well as the}} land communication for the French laborers, who were accustomed annually to gather in the harvest in Spain. Indeed, she must grant a <b>free</b> communication for <b>travellers</b> and traders through her whole country. In that case it is not conjectural, it is certain, the clubs will give law in the provinces; Bourgoing, or some such miscreant, will give law at Madrid.|$|R
40|$|Surfing {{has grown}} from its {{beginnings}} as a western civilisation sport in the early 1900 ’s to a stage {{where it is now}} an industry worth an estimated $ 8 billion dollars and involves surfers travelling to both domestic and international destinations as surf tourists. However, there is a dearth of empirical academic research that has been conducted into this segment of the sports tourism market. This study makes a contribution towards understanding surf tourism behaviour by analysing the demographic and psychographic characteristics of 430 surf tourists. The most lucrative segments of the five identified, from the tour operators perspective, are the price conscious safety seekers and the luxury surfers, while the lack of crowds at surfing destinations is a common preference with all groups. Areas of future research include surf destination image and the ratio of surf tourists choosing package tours compared to being <b>free</b> independent <b>travellers...</b>|$|R
50|$|In Germany, Karl Baedeker {{acquired}} the publishing house of Franz Friedrich Röhling in Koblenz, which in 1828 had published a handbook for travellers by Professor Johannes August Klein entitled Rheinreise von Mainz bis Cöln; ein Handbuch für Schnellreisende (A Rhine Journey from Mainz to Cologne; A Handbook for Travellers on the Move). He published this book with little {{changes for the}} next ten years, which provided the seeds for Baedeker's new approach to travel guides. After Klein died, he decided to publish a new edition in 1839, to which he added many of his own ideas on what he thought a travel guide should offer the traveller. Baedeker's ultimate aim was to <b>free</b> the <b>traveller</b> from having to look for information anywhere outside the travel guide; whether about routes, transport, accommodation, restaurants, tipping, sights, walks or prices. Baedeker emulated the style of John Murray's guidebooks, but included unprecedented detailed information.|$|R

40|$|The {{difficulties}} Traveller pupils {{experience in}} school are well documented. Yet those in home educating go unreported. Monk suggests {{this is because}} some groups are overlooked; that gypsies and Travellers are often not perceived as home educators. This article highlights how the move to home education is seldom a <b>free</b> choice for <b>Traveller</b> families. Although existing literature suggests this {{is a consequence of}} Traveller culture and mobility patterns, this article argues that problems in school drive uptake. Issues of race and ethnicity continue to drive educational inequality and there is an urgent need to redress this is in educational policy and practice...|$|R
50|$|Social centers (or social centres) are {{community}} spaces. They are buildings {{which are}} used {{for a range of}} disparate activities, which can be linked only by being not-for-profit. They might be organizing centers for local activities or they might provide support networks for minority groups such as prisoners and refugees. Often they provide a base for initiatives such as cafes, free shops, public computer labs, graffiti murals, legal collectives and <b>free</b> housing for <b>travellers.</b> The services are determined by both the needs of the community in which the social center is based and the skills which the participants have to offer.|$|R
50|$|Realising {{that the}} Daleks {{can see and}} overhear them via a {{wall-mounted}} device inside their cell, the travellers disable it and then hatch an escape plan. When a Dalek arrives to deliver food, they blind it by smearing some of it onto its eyestalk and force it onto the Thal cape, insulating it from the electrically charged metal floor providing its power. Ian then removes the Dalek creature from its casing and takes its place inside, pretending when challenged to be taking the captives for questioning. Once <b>free,</b> the <b>travellers</b> are able to shout a warning to the Thals who are entering the city and escape with them into the jungle, but not before one of the Thals is killed by the Daleks. The Daleks then test the Thal anti-radiation drug on {{a few of their}} number but find that it causes disastrous side effects. Thwarted, they decide to detonate a neutron bomb to increase the radiation on the planet to a level which even the Thals cannot survive.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{describe}} and examine the tourist market segment of inbound holiday visitors to New Zealand who choose to travel without pre-booking their holiday. These travellers are known as <b>Free</b> Independent <b>Travellers</b> (FITs). They are considered to be a growth segment, but there is little known of their activities in New Zealand, who they are or why they choose to travel independently. Information about travellers and FITs in particular was collected through exit interviews at New Zealand's largest ports (Auckland and Christchurch international airports) during February and March 1988. As well as containing a description of holiday characteristics, demographic characteristics and lifestyle profiles of FITs, the results of the study indicate that: 1) some demographic and holiday characteristics are significantly associated with an independent travel style, 2) segmenting FITs using lifestyle identified five segments which were given descriptive names of, Sports People, Budgeters, Gregarious, Family Oriented and Comfort Seekers. Each lifestyle is associated with particular demographic and holiday characteristics consistent with their central life interest. This market research information could be utilised by tourism planners involved in designing suitable products and services for independent travellers...|$|R

50|$|Injalak {{artists have}} acted as guides of Injalak Hill since {{the opening of}} the art centre in 1989. Injalak Hill tours began as {{informal}} service, with tourists hiring artists as guides for rates often organised on the day. In 1992, a five-year plan for the art centre was formulated, with the Aboriginal governing body of Injalak expressing the desire to formally promote cultural tourism. The main reasons highlighted were to facilitate the understanding of Kunwinjku art and culture, and to generate work and income. In the same year, a number of outside tour operators approached the traditional owners and Injalak to contract the services of Injalak guides. Some partnerships, such as those with Arnhem Land Explorer and Lord's Safaris, have continued to the present day. As demand increased, tourists began to book in advance, and eventually by the dry season of 2000, about 10-15 tours were leaving the art centre for Injalak Hill each week. Injalak currently runs three daily tours of Injalak Hill in peak season, with spaces shared between tour operators and <b>free</b> independent <b>travellers.</b> Tours are generally available from the early dry season(late April-May), with the hill becoming inaccessible again with the onset of the wet season (late November-December).|$|R
40|$|With the {{increasing}} commodification of cultural heritage induced by tourism development, {{the perception of}} a ‘real’ travel experience often depends on what is defined as authentic, original and local. Visitors are becoming increasingly concerned about the authenticity of eco-cultural tourism practices when they visit culturally and environmentally remote regions. The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine the role performance plays in visitors' perception of authenticity of eco-cultural tourism experiences. Various theoretical foundations and aspects of visitors' perceptions of authenticity in cultural heritage tourism are considered. A grounded theory approach based on in-depth semi-structured interviews with several categories of visitors including 25 clients from two eco-tours in South and Central Kazakhstan and 29 <b>Free</b> Independent <b>Travellers</b> (FITs) was adopted to identify visitors' perception of authenticity of various aspects of their tourism experiences and the attributes of the visitors' performative aspects of their travels. Results reveal that the performative aspects contributing to the perceived authenticity of the visitors' eco-cultural experiences are spontaneous, existential and reciprocal relationships with their hosts in intimate tourism encounters. The findings contribute to literature regarding authenticity and cultural heritage tourism by exploring new directions in which to apply the concept of authenticity in eco-cultural tourism experiences and by theorising the link between performance-based touristic space and the perception of authenticity. This space becomes a basis for interaction and social exchange within the host–guest relationship...|$|R
30|$|Firstly, {{for some}} {{intensive}} travellers, travel time is simply time to kill. In this case, experienced time is worse and longer than real time {{leading to a}} very negative perception of travel time. They consider that this time is wasted and useless, consequently engaging in activities simply to make the time pass more quickly. While these activities in some ways help {{to make up for}} a lack of <b>free</b> time, these <b>travellers</b> nonetheless feel they could do more activities and do them more effectively if they did not do them during their trips. Some travellers, for example, say they have trouble working on the train because of the people around them and the noise. Others are too tired to work on their way home and can only do so effectively in the morning. Finally, drivers cannot fully take advantage of their travel time because of the need to concentrate on the driving task, especially on highways.|$|R
6000|$|This {{chapter is}} purely {{practical}} and {{is concerned with}} what actually is the chief mark and element of insanity; we may say in summary that it is reason used without root, reason in the void. The man who begins to think without the proper first principles goes mad; he begins to think at the wrong end. And {{for the rest of}} these pages we have to try and discover what is the right end. But we may ask in conclusion, if this be what drives men mad, what is it that keeps them sane? By the end of this book I hope to give a definite, some will think a far too definite, answer. But for the moment it is possible in the same solely practical manner to give a general answer touching what in actual human history keeps men sane. Mysticism keeps men sane. As long as you have mystery you have health; when you destroy mystery you create morbidity. The ordinary man has always been sane because the ordinary man has always been a mystic. He has permitted the twilight. He has always had one foot in earth and the other in fairyland. He has always left himself free to doubt his gods; but (unlike the agnostic of to-day) free also to believe in them. He has always cared more for truth than for consistency. If he saw two truths that seemed to contradict each other, he would take the two truths and the contradiction along with them. His spiritual sight is stereoscopic, like his physical sight: he sees two different pictures at once and yet sees all the better for that. Thus he has always believed that there was such a thing as fate, but such a thing as free will also. Thus he believed that children were indeed the kingdom of heaven, but nevertheless ought to be obedient to the kingdom of earth. He admired youth because it was young and age because it was not. It is exactly this balance of apparent contradictions that has been the whole buoyancy of the healthy man. The whole secret of mysticism is this: that man can understand everything by the help of what he does not understand. The morbid logician seeks to make everything lucid, and succeeds in making everything mysterious. The mystic allows one thing to be mysterious, and everything else becomes lucid. The determinist makes the theory of causation quite clear, and then finds that he cannot say [...] "if you please" [...] to the housemaid. The Christian permits free will to remain a sacred mystery; but because of this his relations with the housemaid become of a sparkling and crystal clearness. He puts the seed of dogma in a central darkness; but it branches forth in all directions with abounding natural health. As we have taken the circle as the symbol of reason and madness, we may very well take the cross as the symbol at once of mystery and of health. Buddhism is centripetal, but Christianity is centrifugal: it breaks out. For the circle is perfect and infinite in its nature; but it is fixed for ever in its size; it can never be larger or smaller. But the cross, though it has at its heart a collision and a contradiction, can extend its four arms for ever without altering its shape. Because it has a paradox in its centre it can grow without changing. The circle returns upon itself and is bound. The cross opens its arms to the four winds; it is a signpost for <b>free</b> <b>travellers.</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores travel motivations {{to visit}} New Zealand by examining <b>Free</b> Independent <b>Travellers</b> (FITs) from mainland China whose age {{is in the}} range from 18 to 35 years old. Travel motivation is a critical topic in studying tourists’ travel behaviours. China has attracted more and more attention because it supplies a rapidly growing number of outbound tourists. More than ten years ago, researchers began to study the travel motivation of Chinese tourists. However, there is no study specifically focusing on Chinese FITs. This dissertation aims to explore the motivations of young FITs from mainland China to visit New Zealand in order to fill the gap and expand knowledge to travel motivation research. This research adopted a quantitative approach, using a survey {{in the form of an}} anonymous questionnaire to collect primary data. The questionnaire contained three parts, including exploring tourists’ travel characteristics, travel motivation, and demographic information. One hundred and eight participants were involved in the survey. The research findings showed that Chinese FITs came to New Zealand mainly to appreciate natural and cultural features, to relax, and to view its outstanding scenery. The beautiful scenery and unpolluted environment were particularly attractive to Chinese FITs. Twenty-seven motivational items were extracted into seven factors: “New Zealand stimuli”, “safety and cleanliness”, “experience seeking”, “exploration”, “escape”, “ego enhancement”, and “adventure and excitement”. The dominant two factors were experience seeking, and safety and cleanliness. Next, this research also examined whether significant relationships existed between travel motivation and sample characteristics. Firstly, factor 1 – “New Zealand stimuli” – had a significant relationship with level of education. Tourists with a lower level of education were more easily motivated by this factor. Secondly, factor 5 – “escape” – was found to have a significant difference among different lengths of stay in New Zealand. “Escape” played a more important role when tourists chose to stay longer. Thirdly, travel purpose was found to be different in terms of factor 2 “safety and cleanliness”, factor 4 “exploration” and factor 7 “adventure and excitement”. Tourists with the purposes of taking wedding photos, holding weddings, and honeymooning were more motivated by these factors...|$|R
