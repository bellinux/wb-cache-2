5000|$|Figure 1(a) shows a {{side view}} of a typical net in an {{integrated}} circuit. Each net will include at least one driver, which must contain a source or <b>drain</b> <b>diffusion</b> (in newer technology implantation is used), {{and at least one}} receiver, which will consist of a gate electrode over a thin gate dielectric (see Figure 2 for a detailed {{view of a}} MOS transistor). Since the gate dielectric is so thin, only a few molecules thick, a big worry is breakdown of this layer. This can happen if the net somehow acquires a voltage somewhat higher than the normal operating voltage of the chip. (Historically, the gate dielectric has been silicon dioxide, so most of the literature refers to gate oxide damage or gate oxide breakdown. As of 2007, some manufacturers are replacing this oxide with various high-κ dielectric materials {{which may or may not}} be oxides, but the effect is still the same.) ...|$|E

40|$|In this work, OFF-state {{breakdown}} {{characteristics of}} shallow trench isolation (STI) -type drain extended NMOS (DeNMOS) devices with different drain structures are studied and compared. The drain structures include deep-drain structure and structures with heavy doping on STI-sidewall regions. These devices show improved ON-state resistance without degrading breakdown voltage. Devices with higher doping underneath the <b>drain</b> <b>diffusion</b> region exhibit stronger bipolar triggering and higher snapback in their breakdown characteristics, thereby sustaining higher drain current levels before device failure. The devices with heavy doping {{only on the}} STI-sidewall show intermediate snapback characteristics between conventional and deep-drain devices in the breakdown region. Therefore, this work provides physical insights into the impact of different drain doping profiles on low-voltage I-V characteristics and high current drain breakdown characteristics of STI-DeMOS devices for different drain doping profiles...|$|E

[...] The biofilm {{on the walls of}} the drain field trenches will use atmospheric oxygen in the trenches to catabolize organic compounds in septic tank effluent.

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} the transconductance-to-current ratio (gm/ID) methods for the threshold voltage extraction using two popular threshold voltage criteria applicable to advanced bulk and SOI MOSFETs, namely: {{the condition of}} the maximum of the second derivative of the inversion charge and of the equality of the drift and <b>diffusion</b> <b>drain</b> current components. Using analytical modeling, we derive the first-order electrical parameters matching these two physical conditions and show that in the ideal MOSFET they do not coincide. The first corresponds to the point on the gm/ID versus gate voltage (Vg) curve where d(gm/ID) /dVG exhibits a minimum and where the ratio of gm/ID to its maximum value is equal to 2 / 3, whereas the second is met at the point where this ratio equals 1 / 2. The gm/ID methods for the VTH extraction using the above two criteria and their correlation with other methods are discussed. Since our modeling is based on the unified charge control model, its predictions are expected to be valid for both bulk and SOI MOSFETs. Experimental and simulation results for advanced SOI MOSFETs are used to validate modeling derivations and clarify practical applicability and limitations of the gm/ID methods...|$|R
40|$|The {{threshold}} voltage (VTH) {{is a fundamental}} parameter for any MOSFET, characterizing the transition from weak to strong inversion, i. e., from the exponential to linear charge control regimes. Thus accurate and reliable determination of the VTH value {{is very important for}} CMOS design and modeling, and becomes increasingly important as the gate oxide thickness as well as power supply voltage scale down. Traditionally, the {{threshold voltage}} of a MOSFET has been defined as gate voltage needed to provide the critical surface potential equal to twice the Fermi potential in the semiconductor body. However, this VTH criterion is inadequate in the modern MOSFETs featuring ultra-thin or high-k gate dielectrics [1], and it is meaningless in the case of advanced silicon-on-insulator (SOI) MOSFETs with undoped silicon body [2]. Thus a variety of different threshold criteria have been proposed for these devices [1], [2]. As a result, the VTH value turns out dependent on the particular VTH criterion [2]. Presently there are many VTH determination methods, which differ by the underlying VTH criteria, extraction procedures and sensitivity to parasitic effects. Thus it is highly desirable to have a clear physical understanding of these methods. In this work, we review the existing VTH criteria and demonstrate that, in case of nano-scale MOSFETs with ultra-thin gate dielectrics or/and undoped SOI thin body, featuring gradual transition between weak and strong inversion, the most physically adequate VTH criteria are: (i) the maximum of the second derivative of the inversion charge with respect to the gate voltage (d 2 Qinv/dVg 2), corresponding to the inflection point in the rate of the inversion charge growth, and (ii) the equality between the drift and <b>diffusion</b> <b>drain</b> current (ID) components, Idiff=Idrift. The experimental methods for the VTH extraction based on these criteria are examined. Particular attention is given to the recently proposed method, using the transconductance-to current ratio (gm/ID), in which VTH is evaluated from the gate voltage of the minimum of the d(gm/ID) /dVg versus gate voltage function [3]. Using analytical modeling, it is shown that the VTH criterion of the d(gm/ID) /dVg method is the maximum of d 2 Qinv/dVg 2, just as of the popular transconductance change method, in which VTH is defined from the position of the maximum of the transconductance derivative (dgm/dVg≡d 2 Id /dVg 2) [4]. However, though dgm/dVg and d(gm/ID) /dVg methods rely on the same VTH criterion, they feature different sensitivity to the mobility variation with gate voltage and drain voltage value. With analytical modeling and experimental data for advanced SOI FinFETs and ultra-thin-body SOI MOSFETs, it is demonstrated that the d(gm/ID) /dVg method is much less sensitive to the Vg-dependent mobility and drain voltage value, and thus is more reliable than the dgm /dVg method. Furthermore, it is found that at the point of the minimum of d(gm/Id) /dVg, at vanishingly small drain voltage and ideal MOSFET operation, the value of gm /Id is equal to 2 / 3 of its maximum value. This can be used as alternative quick method for the VTH extraction corresponding to the criterion of the maximum of d 2 Qinv/dVg 2. At the same time, at the condition Idiff=Idrift, the ratio of gm /Id to its maximum value is found to be 1 / 2. The difference between the two VTH extractions in the ideal MOSFET is estimated to be ~ 1. 2 kT/q. However, such VTH extractions are possible only when the gm /Id (Vg) curve has a clearly defined plateau in the range of the maximum, whereas it is frequently distorted, for example, due to gate-induced drain leakage current, short-channel effects, or Vg-dependent mobility. Thus the d(gm /Id) /dVg method seems to be more preferable...|$|R
