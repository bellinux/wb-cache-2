40|$|The <b>girls</b> <b>from</b> mountainous regions had {{below average}} height {{compared}} to the corresponding population of lowland areas, where the average growth was revealed. Body weight was identical. Chest circumference corresponds to below average level in <b>girls</b> <b>from</b> lowland region {{as compared with the}} low level in <b>girls</b> <b>from</b> mountainous areas. Physical development of 15 -year-old girls was more compromised, both as a separate consideration and comparative characteristics. Age of menarche in <b>girls</b> <b>from</b> Uzhhorod was observed 2 months earlier. A significant difference in the rates of secondary sexual characteristics Te and Pu is identified, with a prevalence of le­vels in the group of <b>girls</b> <b>from</b> lowland regions. Body mass index was also significantly higher in <b>girls</b> <b>from</b> low-lying ­areas, which is consistent with the body weight of the surveyed girls. There were significant differences between the groups of <b>girls</b> <b>from</b> mountainous and lowland regions on the following parameters: calcium levels, 2 -fold increased levels of total bilirubin, 1. 5 -fold — low-density lipoprotein, 1. 5 -fold — very low-density lipoproteins, 1. 6 -fold — atherogenic index. An increase with the absolute dominance was observed in terms of the le­vels of triglycerides and gamma-glutamyl transferase. Thyroid-stimulating hormone level was lower than the reference one in the <b>girls</b> <b>from</b> the mountain region, compared with <b>girls</b> <b>from</b> low-lying areas. The study of LU lutein showed reduction by 3 times in <b>girls</b> <b>from</b> mountain region as {{compared to the}} data of <b>girls</b> <b>from</b> lowland area. FSU levels (average monthly) were increased among <b>girls</b> <b>from</b> a mountain region. We have considered the 2 nd level of the hormone provision of sexual deve­lopment — ovaries, studied estradiol (E 2) concentration in the blood. E 2 levels in both groups were in reference ranges, with a tendency to the lower limit at 1. 7 -fold prevalence in the <b>girls</b> <b>from</b> mountain region, which corresponds inversely with a proportional ratio of PRL level in the studied groups and the intensity of their influence on the development of secondary sexual characteristics at puberty. Significant increase in cortisol levels, when compared in the groups, is associated with an increased synthesis of triglycerides, very low-density lipoproteins...|$|R

40|$|Menarcheal age was {{studied in}} 900 girls, {{half of which}} were from middle class {{families}} {{and the other half}} from low income class families from the Niger delta region of Nigeria.

40|$|This study compares {{adolescent}} females 2 ̆ 7 {{experiences in}} coeducational versus single-sex high schools, especially related {{to issues of}} adult-role expectations, achievement, peer-relationships, self-image, and body-image. To examine these issues, a variety of measures were included in a questionnaire which was administered to 335 girls in grades nine through twelve from independent schools (3 coeducational and 4 single-sex) in New York City and suburban New Jersey. ^ <b>Girls</b> <b>from</b> the two school types reported similar adult-role expectations and peer-relationships. However, <b>girls</b> <b>from</b> single-sex schools {{were more likely than}} the coeducated girls to say that they were 2 ̆ 2 good at math 2 ̆ 2. <b>Girls</b> <b>from</b> coeducational schools were more oriented toward sports achievement than <b>girls</b> <b>from</b> single-sex schools. The coeducated girls also reported having more strained family relations and poorer impulse control than the girls in single-sex schools. Although there were no differences in the overall body-image of <b>girls</b> <b>from</b> the two school types, <b>girls</b> <b>from</b> single-sex schools were leaner and more likely to diet than the <b>girls</b> <b>from</b> coeducational schools. ^ The results indicate that school gender composition is related to various aspects of adolescent females 2 ̆ 7 experiences. It is suggested that differing effects of gender composition may be found when examining schools with less homogeneous populations than the schools in this study and that other school contextual factors may be related to adolescent functioning. The differences between girls 2 ̆ 7 experiences in coeducational and single-sex schools may be useful information for teachers and administrators when designing the most beneficial academic programs. ...|$|R

5|$|Although Kwee was {{a staunch}} {{supporter}} of realism in literature, Drama dari Krakatau includes {{a degree of}} mysticism, {{as evidenced by the}} apparent connection between the statue in the cave and the eruption of Krakatoa.
