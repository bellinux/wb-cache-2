To halt degradation and loss of the <b>forest</b> coffee <b>genetic</b> <b>resources,</b> the Ethiopian Government has established in-situ conservation areas in the south and southwestern montane rain forest regions of the country. However, there are several thousands {{of people who have been}} and still are dependent on the wild coffee populations from these forests for direct consumption and/or market sales. Thus, policy makers need to consider the needs and economic options of the local people in the periphery, so as to create a win-win relationship between conservation and local agricultural development. This paper substantiates the interface between the <b>forest</b> coffee <b>genetic</b> <b>resources</b> and the local agriculture by exploring the economic importance to farm families of wild coffee from the Geba-Dogi forest coffee conservation area, Southwest Ethiopia. A random sample of 121 farm families was used in this empirical study. Descripitive results demonstrate the very different resource use behavior of the population and the diversity of the (local) people living in the periphery in terms of socioeconomic interests, skills, culture, demographic history, resource use behavior and wealth. Probit regression indicates that household collection of wild coffee from the protected site is positively and significantly associated with family size, ownership of adjacent farm plot, and maleheadship of the household. Number of economically active (adult) labor in the family, distances to the nearest market town and the edge of protected site are found to exert significant disincentives to wild coffee collection portfolio in the peasant household economy...|$|R

Therefore, {{understanding of the}} status of <b>genetic</b> <b>resource</b> of <b>forest</b> trees is imperative before any forest gene conservation can be designed. One of the fundamental requirements for conservation and use of <b>forest</b> tree <b>genetic</b> <b>resources</b> is understanding the biological dynamics of genetic variation within and between species. Considerable variation exists among tree species with respect to the extent of genetic diversity and the way such diversity is organised within and among populations.

40|$|Abstract. Since few {{forest tree}} gene {{conservation}} activities {{have been carried}} out in the Azores islands with its unique flora, it is urgent to develop a strategy for the management of the Azorean <b>forest</b> tree <b>genetic</b> <b>resources.</b> Safeguarding the potential for adaptation was identified as the prime objective for gene conservation of tree species in the Azores. Three species were identified of potential interest for tree genetic improvement. Prunus lusitanica spp azorica was selected due to its rarity and is close to extinction. Piconia azorica and Juniperus brevifolia spp azorica were selected based on their high wood quality and the interest in these trees by the Azorean Forest Service. Combined gene conservation and breeding was suggested for these species. The breeding of all of these species will follow the Multiple Population Breeding System concept. Open-pollinated seed will be collected for establishment of seedling seed orchards for each ecogeographic zone (cf Figure 4). Culling of trees with undesired characteristics will be carried out before seed collection. Seeds will be used for establishment of new progeny plantations. For Prunus lusitanica spp azorica only 1 - 2 seedling seed orchards are suggested. For the two other species several seedling seed orchards are suggested. For tree species not included in the breeding programme, in situ subpopulations are recommended...|$|R
