50|$|A {{reverse gear}} {{implemented}} this way makes a loud whining sound, {{which is not}} normally heard in the <b>forward</b> <b>gears.</b> The teeth on the <b>forward</b> <b>gears</b> of most consumer automobiles are helically cut. When helical gears rotate, there is constant contact between gears, which results in quiet operation. In spite of all <b>forward</b> <b>gears</b> being always meshed, they do not make a sound {{that can be easily}} heard above the engine noise. By contrast, most reverse gears are spur gears, meaning that they have straight teeth, in order to allow for the sliding engagement of the idler, which is difficult with helical gears. The teeth of spur gears clatter together when the gears spin, generating a characteristic whine.|$|R

In transmissions with reverse directly below fifth, {{there may be a}} mechanical lock-out preventing selection of reverse other than from neutral, thus preventing a driver used to a six-speed transmission from engaging reverse while trying to select sixth.|$|R
30|$|<b>Gear</b> <b>units</b> {{are often}} used in various {{industrial}} applications. Consequently, it is of utmost significance to identify fault symptoms of a <b>gear</b> <b>unit</b> at an early stage. It is vibration signals that are primarily used to identify faults but they are always complex {{and it is difficult}} to identify faults in <b>gear</b> <b>units</b> on the basis of vibration signals.

With too much noise, the useful information is corrupted to such an extent that it is impossible to establish the condition or that a wrong conclusion is made.|$|R

40|$|M. Ing. Reliability is {{basically}} the measure of performance, it is {{the probability that a}} system or component will perform its required task without failure under certain conditions for a given period of time [1]. As systems have become more complex in recent time the need for reliability within that system has become more and more important, safety, productivity and profit are three factors that have also demanded an increased level of reliability [2]. The reliability of an industrial <b>gear</b> <b>unit</b> comes from the reliability of all the individual components within the <b>gear</b> <b>unit.</b> Bearing lives are often the limiting factor of a <b>gear</b> <b>unit</b> and more often than not the lubrication becomes contaminated through insufficient maintenance practices, operational practices and harsh environments. This then results in the premature bearing failures within the <b>gear</b> <b>unit.</b> If the <b>gear</b> <b>unit’s</b> “health” can be monitored and imminent failures are known then the unit can be taken out of service and replaced or repaired prior to failure and during scheduled maintenance periods, this will then reduce overall repair costs and drastically reduce unscheduled maintenance time and cost...|$|R

Although a <b>gear</b> <b>unit</b> is a complex dynamic model, its movement is usually periodical; faults and damages represent a disturbing quantity or impulse.

30|$|Many {{damages and}} faults can cause {{problems}} in <b>gear</b> <b>unit</b> operation. A {{crack in the}} tooth root is probably the least desirable among them.
