A total of 170 HIV-seropositive adults presenting with herpes zoster (confirmed by direct fluorescent-antigen testing and/or viral culture) were enrolled and randomized to receive a 10 -day course of orally administered sorivudine (40 mg once daily plus acyclovir placebos) or acyclovir (800 mg five times daily plus sorivudine placebo). Patients were monitored daily to document the events of cutaneous healing, pain, zoster-related complications, and drug-related adverse events. Patients were reassessed on days 21 and 28 and then once monthly for 1 year. The primary efficacy endpoint was time to the cessation of new vesicle formation. Secondary efficacy endpoints included times to other events of cutaneous healing, resolution of pain, and <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>dissemination</b> and zoster recurrence. In a multivariate analysis, sorivudine was superior to acyclovir for reducing the times to the cessation of new vesicle formation (relative risk [RR] = 1. 54, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 1. 00 to 2. 36; P = 0. 049) and total lesion crusting (RR = 1. 48, 95 % CI = 1. 07 to 2. 04; P = 0. 017). In a univariate analysis, there was a trend favoring sorivudine for the cessation of new vesicle formation (median of 3 versus 4 days; P = 0. 07) and a significant advantage for time to total lesion crusting (median of 7 versus 8 days; P = 0. 02). The time to the resolution of zoster-associated pain, the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>dissemination,</b> and the frequency of zoster recurrence were not different between the two treatment groups. Both drugs were well tolerated. Sorivudine is an effective drug for the treatment of herpes zoster in HIV-infected patients and results in accelerated cutaneous healing when compared with acyclovir therapy...|$|E

40|$|What is {{the effect}} of {{democratic}} competition on the power of elites to frame public opinion?We address this issue first by defining the range of competitive contexts that might surroundany debate over a policy issue. We then offer a theory that predicts how audiences, messages, and competitive environments interact to influence the magnitude of framing effects. These hypotheses are tested using experimental data gathered on the opinions of adults and college students toward two policy issues—–the management of urban growth and the right of an extremist group to conduct a rally. Our results indicate that framing effects depend more heavily on the qualities of frames than on their <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>dissemination</b> and that competition alters but does not eliminate the influence of framing. We conclude by discussing the implications of these results for the study of public opinion and democratic political debate. The past quarter century of scholarship on publicopinion has shown that citizens ’ attitudes canbe influenced significantly by how elites frame their communications in the mass media. In the par-lance of this research, a speaker “frames ” an issue by encouraging readers or listeners to emphasize certain considerations above others when evaluating that issue. A framing “effect ” occurs when individuals arrive at different positions on the issue, depending on the pri-ority given to various considerations (Druckman and Nelson 2003 : 730). For example, a newspaper editorial defending a hate group rally in terms of the group’s free speech rights may move readers to favor allowing the rally by causing them to weigh speech concerns more heavily when assessing the issue. Alternatively, an editorial challenging the rally as a threat to public safety may lead readers to give priority to maintaining social order and turn them against the rally (Nelson, Clawson, and Oxley 1997). Such studies raise questions about the capacity of citizens to provide autonomous input into the demo-cratic process. If public preferences can be arbitrar-ily manipulated by how issues are framed, there can be no legitimate representation of public interests or meaningful discussion of government responsivenes...|$|E

We prospectively evaluated the diagnostic value of PCR {{in comparison with}} CSF cytomorphology and MRI for diagnosing meningeal dissemination in PCNSL. METHODS: We evaluated 282 patients from a multicenter therapy study for PCNSL {{for the presence of}} meningeal dissemination: 205 with CSF cytomorphology, 171 with PCR of the rearranged immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes in CSF, and 217 with cranial MRI. RESULTS: Meningeal dissemination was found in 33 of 205 patients (16 %) by cytomorphology, in 19 of 171 (11 %) patients evaluated by PCR, and in 8 of 217 patients (4 %) by MRI. Considering either of these methods, the relative <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> meningeal <b>dissemination</b> was 17. 4 % (49 of 282 patients). PCR was monoclonal in 6 of 19 (32 %) samples with positive cytomorphology, 1 of 13 samples (8 %) with suspicious cytology, and in 10 of 105 (10 %) cytologically negative samples. In 11 samples with positive and 12 with suspicious cytology, PCR showed only a polyclonal pattern. The probability <b>of</b> meningeal <b>dissemination</b> detection was higher in cases with CSF pleocytosis (> 5 /microL) with an OR of 2. 48 (95 % CI 1. 15 - 5. 34, p = 0. 018).

CONCLUSIONS: We found a low rate <b>of</b> meningeal <b>dissemination</b> in primary CNS lymphoma in this large prospective study. The rate of discordant PCR and cytomorphologic results was high. Thus, the methods should be regarded as complementary. CSF pleocytosis had predictive value for meningeal dissemination detection...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Prescription {{practices}} {{have been shown}} to influence the emergence of anti-malarial drug resistance. Thus efforts in this study were devoted to evaluating the prescribing practices prior to introduction of the artemisinin based combination therapy (ACT) in Nigeria and its potential contribution to emergence of chloroquine resistant malaria in south-west Nigeria, in order to forestall a similar situation with the ACT. Methods A retrospective quantitative study was designed to examine case records of patients treated for malaria in either a government or a private hospital in Ibadan, south-west Nigeria, over a 20 -year period, cutting across three phases of resistance to chloroquine in Nigeria: pre-resistance, emerging resistance and <b>dissemination</b> <b>of</b> resistance. Patient prescriptions were examined for use of anti-malarial drugs, sub-therapeutic doses of chloroquine, co-administration of anti-histamines with chloroquine. Descriptive statistics <b>of</b> <b>frequency</b> and percentage were used to describe trends in the parameters assessed using EPI-info. Results Case record files of 2, 529 patients were examined. Chloroquine was the main drug used in treatment of malaria throughout the periods studied, with <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> prescription at both sites ranging from 91. 4 % to 98. 3 % during the pre-resistance years. It was administered as standard doses during the pre resistance years. Anti-histamines, especially promethazine, were routinely co-administered with chloroquine at this period too. However, the practice of prescribing sub-therapeutic doses of chloroquine at the private health care facility coincided with the latter phase of emerging resistance and phase <b>of</b> <b>dissemination</b> <b>of</b> resistance. <b>Frequency</b> <b>of</b> prescription of sub-therapeutic doses increased from 6. 7 % in 1983 (pre-resistance years) to 43. 6 % in 1997 (<b>dissemination</b> <b>of</b> resistance phase) at the private health care facility. <b>Frequency</b> <b>of</b> co-administration of anti-histamines with chloroquine also reduced during the period <b>of</b> <b>dissemination</b> <b>of</b> resistance. Conclusion The results from this study describe a lack of adherence to national treatment guidelines, especially in the private sector, and a relationship between prescription practices and <b>dissemination</b> <b>of</b> drug resistant falciparum malaria. As Nigeria adopts the use of ACT, there is an urgent need to improve malaria treatment practices in Nigeria in order to prolong the clinical shelf-life of the combination. </p...|$|R

40|$|Borrelia burgdorferi, the {{etiologic}} agent of Lyme disease, is genetically heterogeneous. Previous {{studies have shown}} a significant association between the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> hematogenous <b>dissemination</b> in Lyme disease patients and the genotype of the infecting B. burgdorferi strain. Comparative transcriptional profiling of two representative clinical isolates with distinct genotypes (BL 206 and B 356) was undertaken. A total of 78 open reading frames (ORFs) had expression levels that differed significantly between the two isolates. A number of genes with potential involvement in nutrient uptake (BB 0603, BBA 74, BB 0329, BB 0330, and BBB 29) have significantly higher expression levels in isolate B 356. Moreover, nearly 25 % of the differentially expressed genes are predicted to be localized on the cell surface, implying that these two isolates have cell surface properties that differ considerably. One of these genes, BBA 74, encodes a protein of 257 amino acid residues that {{has been shown to}} possess porin activity. BBA 74 transcript level was > 20 -fold higher in B 356 than in BL 206, and strain B 356 contained three- to fivefold more BBA 74 protein. BBA 74 was disrupted by the insertion of a kanamycin resistance cassette into the coding region. The growth rates of both wild-type and mutant strains were essentially identical, and cultures reached the same final cell densities. However, the mutant strains consistently showed prolonged lags of 2 to 5 days prior to the induction of log-phase growth compared to wild-type strains. It is tempting to speculate that the absence of BBA 74 interferes with the enhanced nutrient uptake that may be required for the entry of cells into log-phase growth. These studies demonstrate the value of comparative transcriptional profiling for identifying differences in the transcriptomes of B. burgdorferi clinical isolates that may provide clues to pathogenesis. The 78 ORFs identified here are a good starting point for the investigation of factors involved in the hematogenous <b>dissemination</b> <b>of</b> B. burgdorferi...|$|R

Local endoscopic therapies are promising treatment options for superficial lesions; however, for deeper lesions, surgical resection {{is considered to}} be the treatment of choice. To contribute to therapeutic decision-making, we retrospectively analysed the outcome of transhiatal esophagectomy in 120 patients with pathologically proven HGD (n= 13) or T 1 -adenocarcinoma (n= 107) of the distal esophagus or gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ). Tumors were subdivided into six different depths of invasion ('T 1 -mucosal' m 1 -m 3, 'T 1 -submucosal' sm 1 -sm 3), and the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> lymphatic <b>dissemination</b> and time to locoregional and/or distant recurrence were analysed. Only one of the 79 T 1 m 1 - 3 /sm 1 tumors (1 %) showed lymph node metastases as compared with 18 out of 41 T 1 sm 2 - 3 tumors (44 %). There was a significant difference in recurrence-free period between T 1 m 1 -m 3 /sm 1 versus T 1 sm 2 -sm 3 tumor patients (P log rank < 0. 0001), with 5 -year recurrence-free percentages of 97 % and 57 %, respectively. In multivariate analysis including age, gender, tumor differentiation grade, N-stage and depth of invasion, only N-stage was an independent prognostic factor for recurrence-free period (hazard rate= 5. 9, 95 % CI 1. 7 - 20. 7). However, if N-stage was excluded from analysis, only depth of invasion (T 1 sm 2 - 3 versus T 1 m 1 -m 3 /sm 1) was an independent prognostic factor for recurrence-free period (hazard rate= 7. 5, 95 % CI 2. 0 - 27. 7).
