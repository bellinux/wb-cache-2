Dry Valley went on, stumbled down the front steps, out the gate and down the road into a mesquite thicket at the edge of town. He sat down in the grass and laboriously plucked the spines from a prickly pear, one by one. This was his attitude of thought, acquired in the days when his problems were only those of wind and wool and water.|$|R
50|$|Abiotic {{stress is}} a {{naturally}} occurring factor that cannot {{be controlled by}} humans. One example of two stressors that are complimentary to each other is wind and drought. Drought dries out the soil and kills the plants that are growing in the soil. After this occurs, the soil is left barren and <b>dry.</b> Wind can <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> the soil and carry for miles. Irrigation can keep this from happening, {{but it is not}} possible to irrigate some areas.|$|R

50|$|Wallace Run {{begins in}} a valley in the Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 163 in western Union Township. The {{headwaters}} are situated on the southern side of the Allegheny Plateau. Foxy Hollow is {{to the south of}} the headwaters and Bear Knob is to the east. The stream flows northeast past <b>Dry</b> Hollow and <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> Rock Cabin Run on the left. The stream continues northeast, passing Grindstone Gap on the right and <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> Birch Lick Run on the left. After this, the creek flows around Ganderstep Knob, <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> its north branch. It turns southeast exists the township. Wallace Run then enters Boggs Township and its valley becomes shallower. The stream passes Gum Stump and begins to parallel Pennsylvania Route 144 for several miles to its mouth, passing the community of Runville along the way. Wallace Run enters Bald Eagle Creek at the community of Wingate, a short distance upstream of Milesburg.|$|R
2500|$|Prior to the New Hampshire primary, the [...] "Canuck letter" [...] was {{published}} in the Manchester Union-Leader. The letter, whose authenticity was later brought into question, claimed that Muskie had made disparaging remarks about French-Canadians. Subsequently, the paper published an attack on the character of Muskie's wife Jane, reporting that she drank and used off-color language. Muskie made an emotional defense of his wife in a speech outside the newspaper's offices during a snowstorm. Though Muskie later stated that what had appeared to the press as tears were actually melted snowflakes, the press reported that Muskie broke down and cried. [...] Muskie did worse than expected in the primary, while McGovern came in a surprisingly close second. While Muskie's campaign funding and support <b>dried</b> <b>up,</b> McGovern <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> valuable momentum in the following months.|$|R
5000|$|While {{traveling}} {{towards the}} Indian Ocean, the <b>dry</b> cold wind <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> some {{moisture from the}} Bay of Bengal and pours it over peninsular India and parts of Sri Lanka. Cities like Madras, which get less rain from the Southwest Monsoon, receives rain from this Monsoon. About 50% to 60% of the rain received {{by the state of}} Tamil Nadu is from the Northeast Monsoon. In Southern Asia, the northeastern monsoons take place from December to early March when the surface high-pressure system is strongest. [...] The jet stream in this region splits into the southern subtropical jet and the polar jet. The subtropical flow directs northeasterly winds to blow across southern Asia, creating dry air streams which produce clear skies over India. Meanwhile, a low pressure system develops over South-East Asia and Australasia and winds are directed toward Australia known as a monsoon trough.|$|R
6000|$|I {{did my best}} in {{the small}} time allowed me to make {{something}} like a man, or rather I should say something like a boy, of the poor creature, Ransome.

For as the wolverine was older than the mouse, he was accustomed to speak to her in this manner. However, the mouse was used to it and only answered: 'I think you had better stay here till it is done, and if there is any alteration needed I can make it.'

40|$|During a {{dust storm}} event, loose sand/dust from a <b>dry</b> area is <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> and {{tossed into the}} air. These {{particles}} get together and form a layer of dust. These layers carry large amount of dust {{from one place to}} another and affect global meteorological conditions. The present study addresses detection, migration, altitude measurements and spread of two intense dust storm outbreaks events over the Arabian Sea region using multi-satellite observations. The first event occurred on 15 th October 2008 when intense plumes of dust blew over Arabian Sea from the south coast of Pakistan. The second event of the dust storm originated in Arabian desert on March 25 th. The plume extended hundreds of kilometers across southern shore of Oman, over Arabian Sea to the coast of Pakistan. The dust storm lasted over the Arabian Sea till 30 th March. MODIS sensors on both Terra and Aqua Satellites captured images of both events. From the difference in emissive/transmissive nature of the mineral aerosol, suspended dust is distinguished from the ground scene. The algorithms based on split window brightness temperature difference, relations among reflectance at different wavelengths and their ratios and normalized difference indices like Normalized Difference Dust Index (NDDI) ...|$|R
