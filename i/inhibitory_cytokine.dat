5000|$|IL-10 {{inhibits}} the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and INF-gamma, thus {{suppressing the}} proliferation of T-cells, NK cells, and AM. IL-10 shares similar immunomodulating mechanisms to TGF-β. It is thought that both cytokines reduce the rate of apoptosis in human alveolar macrophages, thus indirectly enhancing alveolar macrophage-mediated inhibition of T-cell proliferation. There is {{a significant increase in}} the basal rate of apoptosis upon activation by bacterial products. Apoptosis is particularly regulated by the presence of cytokines: IFN-γ increases the rate of apoptosis, whereas IL-10 and TGF-β decrease it. However, IL-10 has counterproductive effects on the immune system, and has been shown to actually promote infection by foreign pathogens. The role of IL-10 in bacterial and parasitic infection has been discovered as a strategy to evade host immune systems. [...] There are bacteria which parasitize AMs by invading through their membranes, and thrive by growing and replicating inside of them, exploiting AMs as host cells. Normally, this infection can be eliminated by T-cells, which activate enzymes in alveolar macrophages that destroy the bacteria; but these bacteria have been shown to alter the cytokine signaling network to their advantage. As an <b>inhibitory</b> <b>cytokine,</b> IL-10 facilitates the infection of human alveolar macrophages and monocytes by completely reversing the protective effect of IFN-γ against intracellular Legionella pneumophila replication. Yersinia enterocolitica has also been shown to releases virulence antigen LcrV, which induces IL-10 through Toll-like receptor-2 and CD14 (an accessory surface protein of TLR4-mediated LPS-signaling), resulting in the suppression of IFN-γ and TNF-alpha suppression.|$|E
50|$|Foxp3 is a {{recruiter}} of other anti-tumor enzymes such as CD39 and nullCD8. The overexpression of CD39 {{is found in}} patients with multiple cancer types such as nullmelanoma, leukemia, pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, and ovarian cancer. This overexpression may be protecting tumorous cells, allowing them to create their “escape phase”. A cancerous tumor’s “escape phase” is where the tumor grows quickly and it becomes clinically invisible by becoming independent of the extracellular matrix and creating its own immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. The consequences of a cancer cell reaching the “escape phase” {{is that it allows}} it to completely evade the immune system, which reduces the immunogenicity and ability to become clinically detected, allowing it to progress and spread throughout the body. Some cancer patients have also been known to display higher numbers of mutated CD4+ cells. These mutated cells will then produce large quantities of TGF-β and IL-10, (a Transforming Growth Factor β and an <b>inhibitory</b> <b>cytokine</b> respectively,) which will suppress signals to the immune system and allow for tumor escape. In one experiment a 15-mer synthetic peptide, P60, was able to inhibit Foxp3’s ability to function. P60 did this by entering the cells and then binding to Foxp3, where it hinders Foxp3’s ability to translocate to the nucleus. Due to this, Foxp3 could no longer properly suppress the transcription factors nullNF-kB and NFAT; both of which are protein complexes that regulate transcription of DNA, cytokine production and cell survival. This would inhibit a cell’s ability to perform apoptosis and stop its own cell cycle, which could potentially allow an affected cancerous cell to survive and reproduce.|$|E

25|$|One major {{difference}} between regulatory T cells and effector T cells is that regulatory T cells typically serve to modulate and deactivate the immune response, while effector T cell groups usually begin with immune-promoting cytokines and then switch to <b>inhibitory</b> <b>cytokines</b> later in their life cycle.

However, when cocultured monocytes, but not OC precursors, with MM cells, we made a novel observation that MM cells inhibited receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) -induced increase of OC differentiation, OC gene expression, signaling pathways and bone resorption activity. Our results showed that MM cells produced multiple <b>inhibitory</b> <b>cytokines</b> of osteoclastogenesis, such as IL- 10, which activated STAT 3 signaling and induce OC inhibition. However, cocultures of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) reversed MM-induced OC inhibition. We found that MM cells increased production of MCP- 1 from BMSCs and BMSC-derived MCP- 1 enhanced OC formation. Mechanistic studies showed that IL- 10 downregulated RANK expression in monocytes and thus, inhibited RANKL-induced OC formation. In contrast, MCP- 1 upregulated RANK expression and thus, enhanced OC formation. Overall, our studies {{for the first time}} demonstrated that MM cell have inhibitory effects on osteoclastogenesis by producing <b>inhibitory</b> <b>cytokines.</b> Our results further indicate that activation of osteoclastogenesis in bone marrow requests the crosstalk of MM cells, BMSCs and their produced cytokines.

30|$|Consistent {{with the}} notion that {{telomerase}} is subject to membrane receptor-mediated extracellular micro-environmental regulation (Ogawa et al., 2006; DamLe et al., 2012; Jacob et al., 2016), in this study, we demonstrate that BMPRII receptor is involved in mediating recombinant human BMP 7 inhibition of telomerase activity and telomere maintenance in cultured human breast cancer cells, resulting in cancer cell senescence and death. Our data demonstrate that telomerase maintenance of telomeres in tumor cells is subject to regulation by extracellular cytokine and that the BMP 7 pathway plays {{a significant role in the}} negative regulation of telomerase activity and telomere maintenance in cancer. The maintenance of telomeres by telomerase in cancer is therefore likely to be reprogrammable by a defined extracellular environment, probably by a combination of extracellular factors with BMP 7 to be an <b>inhibitory</b> <b>cytokine</b> of telomerase-mediated telomere homeostasis.|$|E

We had a test about the effect of the modified anti-inflamma-tory steroidal antedrug on anti-inflammatory activity. The present study evaluated their ability to inhibit cytokine-induced NO and IL- 8 produc-tion in human alveolar epithelial cells. We also investigated their ability to enhance the expres-sion of <b>inhibitory</b> <b>cytokine</b> receptor, interleukin 22 receptor (IL- 22 R) in human alveolar epithelial cells. Our results showed that FP-ISO- 21 AC sh- owed higher ability to inhibit the cytokine - in-duced production of NO than PRED.

The above cells have Tumor Associated Antigens (TAAs), such as NK target structure (NKTS) and heat shock cognate (hsc), and are NK-sensitive.

In this study, we revealed that IL- 10 downregulated the expression of the NK target structure, reduced NK sensitivity, and downregulated the expression of MHC class I, which probably facilitated the tumor cells' escape from the attack of the CTL. In addition, IL- 10 downregulated the ?expression of heat shock protein which either 1), constituted a relay line in which the peptides were generated in the cytosol by the action of the proteases, until they were finally accepted by MHC class I molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum; or 2), bound to peptides that expressed themselves on the cell surface. In other words, IL- 10 downregulated the processing of peptides and the presentation of antigens.

Multiple layers of suppressive components including regulatory T (TReg) cells, suppressive antigen-presenting cells, and <b>inhibitory</b> <b>cytokines</b> form suppressive networks in the ovarian cancer microenvironment. It has been demonstrated that as a major suppressive element, TReg cells infiltrate tumor, interact with several types of immune cells, and mediate immune suppression through different molecular and cellular mechanisms. In this paper, we focus on human ovarian cancer and will discuss the nature of TReg cells including their subsets, trafficking, expansion, and function. We will briefly review the development of manipulation of TReg cells in preclinical and clinical settings. 1...|$|R
40|$|AIMS: The anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmatic autoantibody-associated vasculitides (AASV) are {{diseases}} of relapsing-remitting inflammation. Here we explore the cytokine profile in different phases of disease, looking for pathogenic clues of possible prognostic value. Results: Interleukin (IL) - 6, IL- 8 and IL- 10 were significantly elevated in plasma. Patients {{in the stable}} phase who subsequently developed adverse events had higher IL- 8 values. Patients in the stable phase who relapsed within 3 months had lower IL- 10 values and higher IL- 6 levels. Conclusions: Patients with AASV have raised circulating cytokine levels compared with healthy controls, even during remission. Raised IL- 8 seems associated with poor prognosis. Lower levels of IL- 10 {{and higher levels of}} IL- 6 herald a greater risk of relapse. Patients with systemic vasculitis in clinical remission have persistent disease activity, kept under control by <b>inhibitory</b> <b>cytokines...</b>|$|R
