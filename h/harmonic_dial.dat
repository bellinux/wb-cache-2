40|$|The diurnal {{anisotropy}} {{of cosmic}} ray intensity {{for the time}} period  2001 to 2014 is studied, covering the maximum and the descending phase of solar cycle  23, the minimum between solar cycles  23 and  24, and the ascending phase and maximum of solar cycle  24. Cosmic ray intensity data from 11 neutron monitor stations located at different places around the Northern Hemisphere obtained from the high-resolution Neutron Monitor Database (NMDB) were used. Special software was developed for the calculations of the amplitude and the phase of the diurnal anisotropy vectors on annual and monthly basis using Fourier analysis and {{for the creation of}} the <b>harmonic</b> <b>dial</b> diagrams. The geomagnetic bending for each station was taken into account in our calculations determined from the asymptotic cones of each station via the Tsyganenko 96 (Tsyganenko and Stern, 1996) magnetospheric model. From our analysis, it was resulted that there is a different behavior of the diurnal anisotropy vectors during the different phases of the solar cycles depending on the solar magnetic field polarity. The latitudinal and longitudinal distribution of the cosmic ray diurnal anisotropy was also examined by grouping the stations according to their geographic coordinates, and it was shown that diurnal variation is modulated not only by the latitude but also by the longitude of the stations. The diurnal anisotropy during strong events of solar and/or cosmic ray activity is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{morphology}} {{of magnetic}} storms {{that has been}} investigated by [...] S. Chapman since 1918 was further extended with more material as regards [...] both the number of storms {{and the number of}} observatories, Three [...] hundred and forty-six magnetic storms having sudden commencements were [...] selected for the years 1902 to 19 ^ 5 - These 3 ^ 6 storms were classified [...] by a new method based on the most notable characteristic of the stormtime [...] variation observed in low and middle latitudes, namely, a worldwide [...] diminution in the horizontal force; hence the maximum diminution [...] in the horizontal force averaged over these latitudes was used as a [...] measure to indicate the intensity of magnetic storms. The 3 ^ 6 storms [...] here selected were classified into three intensity groups: (l.) weak, [...] (2) active, and 3) great storms [...] The numbers of storms classed in [...] these categories are 136, 136 and kj, respectively. In the present [...] thesis the investigation on the 136 weak magnetic storms is described. [...] (in the previous study made by Chapman forty storms of moderate intensity [...] were used.) The number of magnetic observatories used in, the present [...] study was also widely extended from eleven (in the previous work) to [...] twentyfive. Seven observatories in the southern hemisphere distributed [...] between geomagnetic latitudes 12 ° and 48 ° were included in these twentyfive [...] observatories„ The geomagnetic latitudes of the eighteen northern [...] observatories range from 20 ° to 80 °, [...] [...] Several improvements were also made in the treatment of the magnetic [...] data. One of the improvements is that hour-to-hour differences [...] derived from the hourly values of the three magnetic elements, the [...] horizontal force, declination and the vertical, force, were used, [...] instead of the ordinary hourly values as given in observatory reports. [...] [...] With the 136 weak magnetic storms the storm-time variations of the [...] three elements for the four pre-storm hours and the first seventy-two [...] hours from the storm commencement were determined for eight groups of [...] observatories, whose mean geomagnetic latitudes are 28 ° S, 21 °, 28 °, [...] k 2 °, 52 °, 59 °, 65 ° and 80 °; the first group being in the southern, [...] the rest in the northern hemisphere. Thus the average features of the [...] storm-time variations at various latitudes were able to be studied [...] more closely. In determining these storm-time changes the daily [...] variations on quiet days uncorrected for the non-cyclic variation [...] were removed from the original data in order to allow for this latter [...] variation. [...] [...] Then the disturbance local-time inequality for the first, second [...] and third storm days was examined for each magnetic element for each [...] of the groups of observatories. The vectograms of these variations [...] were also drawn. Besides confirming, on the whole, the views expressed [...] in Chapman's discussions on the storm-time as well as the disturbance [...] local-time inequality, the present results revealed more detailed [...] features of these variations at various latitudes. [...] The disturbance local-time inequality for each element for each [...] group of observatories was further studied for shorter intervals of [...] storm-time, that is, for four 6 -hour intervals in each of the first [...] and second days and for three 8 -hour intervals in the third storm [...] day. The results were harmonically analyzed to determine the diurnal [...] (2 ^-hour) and the semi-diurnal (12 -hour) components of these variations. [...] The diurnal component was illustrated by harmonic, dials, by which [...] means the decay of the amplitude of these variations and the change of [...] their phases with storm-time were clearly demonstrated. It was found that the phases of the disturbance diurnal equality in declination [...] and the vertical force have certain definite relations with that in [...] the horizontal force at each latitude, and that if the results for [...] declination and the vertical force are combined -with those for the [...] horizontal force with some appropriate modifications in their amplitudes [...] and phases, and if such averages are further combined among [...] the groups of observatories in low and middle latitudes, the averaged [...] <b>harmonic</b> <b>dial</b> so obtained is much more regular than those for individual [...] elements or for smaller groups. The rates of growth and decay of [...] the storm-time change and the disturbance local-time inequality [...] were compared., The results indicate that these two variations vary [...] at rates that are materially different in their course. [...] Detailed descriptions and discussions on these results, the final [...] objects of the present study and plans for its future extension, are [...] given in the present thesis...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} known for some years that the {{intensity}} variations in sidereal time observed by muon detectors at moderate underground depths are sensitive to the polarity of the interplanetary magnetic field (ipmf) near the Earth. There are differences in the response to these anisotropies as observed in the Norhtern and southern hemispheres. When fully understood, the nature of the anisotropy seems likely to provide information on the 3 -dimensional structure of the heliomagnetosphere, its time variations, and its linking with the local interstellar field. The summation <b>harmonic</b> <b>dials</b> for the sidereal diurnal variation during 1958 to 1982 show that there is a strong dependence on whether the ipmf near the Earth is directed outwards from the Sun or inwards it...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe sensitivity of planetary waves to various initial conditions and thermal forcing is examined using a linear global primitive equation spectral model. Initial conditions are obtained by switching on a analytic heat source and then integrating the model equations out to 30 days. An averaging procedure {{is used to}} eliminate any transient modes which remained after integration so that the initial conditions represent steady state solutions. Additional integrations are performed in which 'errors' are introduced into the forcing and initial conditions. Results of the amplitude plots study are examined using polar phase vs amplitude plots (<b>harmonic</b> <b>dials)</b> of various spherical harmonics. Results indicate that planetary waves are not sensitive to errors in the forcing or initial conditions. However, this lack of sensitivity is most likely due to the simplified initial conditions used in the model {{rather than to the}} inherent sensitivity of planetary waves.

40|$|In 1961 a {{magnetic}} observatory was established at Freetown, Sierra Leone (13 º 13 'W, 8 º 28 'N) {{just north of}} the dip equator. Records for H, D and Z for the period July 1961 to June 1965, covering the recent minimum in sunspot activity, have been analysed by the method due to Chapman and Miller to give the first four solar and luni-solar harmonics of the daily variation. The data was divided into three seasonal sets and two groups, firstly the International Quiet Days and secondly all days having magnetic activity index Ci ≤ 1. 2. Probable errors for all harmonics have been determined and plotted on the <b>harmonic</b> <b>dials.</b> The seasonal changes of the solar terms show a movement of the equatorial current system in opposition to the sun with a larger shift during the northern summer months than during the northern winter months. The seasonal variations of the lunar terms show similar changes indicating that the lunar ionospheric current system behaves in a similar way to the solar current system. The occurrence of pulsations in the horizontal intensity of period approximately two minutes has been analysed for the year from March 1962 to February 1963. Two maxima were found, one at dawn and the second at noon. The dawn maxima was absent during northern winter months. A short field survey was undertaken to enable the plotting of magnetic charts for Sierra Leone. Measurements were also made of the daily variations at three field stations in Sierra Leone which confirmed the day-to-day variability of the daily variations of the equatorial ionospheric current system...|$|R
