2500|$|On {{the morning}} of the {{dedication}} of Lombardi Avenue, Lombardi remarked to his 37-member entourage that he was pleased to have <b>gotten</b> <b>them</b> all up to attend morning Mass. Lombardi was also a 4th degree in the Knights of Columbus.|$|E
2500|$|At 6–5, things {{looked a}} little more {{promising}} for the visitors. The two-game win streak they took into the game had <b>gotten</b> <b>them</b> over a [...]500 first half. Momentum clearly was on their side, and the Giants had not beaten the Eagles since the opening game of the 1975 season, three years prior. Still, the Giants were a decent team, and the Eagles knew they could not relax.|$|E
2500|$|Relations {{between new}} {{producer}} Freiberger and the Year One veterans were strained. Landau complained about stories he felt were light-weight or absurd {{when compared to}} the previous year's efforts. He wrote on the cover of a script: [...] "I'm not going out on a limb for this show because I'm not in accord with what you're (Freiberger) doing as a result... etc. I don't think I even want to do the promos—I don't want to push the show any more as I have in the past. It's not my idea of what the show should be. It's embarrassing to me if I am not the star of it and in the way I feel it should be. This year should be more important to it, not less important to it... I might as well work less hard in all of them." [...] Johnny Byrne said that Freiberger was a good man and good producer, but not good for Space: 1999. He had <b>gotten</b> <b>them</b> a second year after the cancellation, but the changes he made did not benefit the programme.|$|E
50|$|Prisoner functionaries could often {{help other}} prisoners by <b>getting</b> <b>them</b> into better barracks, <b>getting</b> <b>them</b> {{assigned}} to lighter work. On occasion, to <b>get</b> <b>them</b> removed from transport lists or even <b>get</b> <b>them</b> new identities {{in order to}} protect them from persecution. This assistance was generally limited to the prisoners in the functionary's own group (fellow citizen or political comrade). The prisoner functionaries were in a precarious hierarchy between their fellow inmates and the SS. This situation was intentionally created, as revealed in a speech by Heinrich Himmler.|$|R

2500|$|At 10:00am, October 28, Kennedy {{first learned}} of Khrushchev's {{solution}} to the crisis to remove the 15 Jupiters in Turkey and the Soviets would remove the rockets from Cuba. Khrushchev had made the offer in a public statement {{for the world to}} hear. Despite almost solid opposition from his senior advisers, Kennedy quickly embraced the Soviet offer. [...] "This is a pretty good play of his," [...] Kennedy said, according to a tape recording that he made secretly of the Cabinet Room meeting. Kennedy had deployed the Jupiters in March of the year, causing a stream of angry outbursts from Khrushchev. [...] "Most people will think this is a rather even trade and we ought to take advantage of it," [...] Kennedy said. Vice President Lyndon Johnson was the first to endorse the missile swap but others continued to oppose the offer. Finally, Kennedy ended the debate. [...] "We can't very well invade Cuba with all its toil and blood," [...] Kennedy said, [...] "when we could have <b>gotten</b> <b>them</b> out by making a deal on the same missiles on Turkey. If that's part of the record, then you don't have a very good war." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "By {{the rudder}} to Noah's Ark, I {{think you are}} right!" [...] burst out Tom. [...] "Why, it's as plain as the nose on your face! Don't you {{remember}} how worried Barton Pelter looked when we told him the bonds were missing, and how he asked us at the moving picture show if we had <b>gotten</b> <b>them</b> back yet? More than likely he knew how this safe was fixed-- he used to come here, you know, to see his uncle----" ...|$|E

60|$|Dave {{told all}} that he knew, and the man listened eagerly. Then Snogger told {{something}} of his life's history, {{how he and his}} wife had quarreled and how some neighbors had <b>gotten</b> <b>them</b> to separate. He had drifted to the West, and remained there for three years. Then he had gone back to look for his wife, but had found out that she was dead. He could get no trace of his little boy, and finally had gone West again. At first he had carried himself straight, but presently he had gotten in with the wrong set and had drank and gambled, and left Mr. Endicott to go to work for Mr. Merwell.|$|E

60|$|The Glass Cat, {{although}} it had some disagreeable ways and manners, nevertheless realized that Trot and Cap'n Bill were its friends and so was quite disturbed at the fix it had <b>gotten</b> <b>them</b> into by leading them to the Isle of the Magic Flower. The ruby heart of the Glass Cat was cold and hard, but still it was a heart, {{and to have a}} heart of any sort is to have some consideration for others. But the queer transparent creature didn't want Trot and Cap'n Bill to know it was sorry for them, and therefore it moved very slowly until it had crossed the river and was out of sight among the trees of the forest. Then it headed straight toward the Emerald City, and trotted so fast that it was like a crystal streak crossing the valleys and plains. Being glass, the cat was tireless, and with no reason to delay its journey, it reached Ozma's palace in wonderfully quick time.|$|E
60|$|Debi Sing {{fixed the}} seat of his {{authority}} at Dinagepore, where, as soon as he arrived, he did not lose a moment in doing his duty. If Mr. Hastings can forget his covenant, you may easily believe that Debi Sing had not a more correct memory; and accordingly, as soon as he came into the province, he instantly broke every covenant which he had entered into as a restraint on his avarice, rapacity, and tyranny, which, from the highest of the nobility and gentry to the lowest husbandmen, were afterwards exercised, with a stern and unrelenting impartiality, upon the whole people. For, notwithstanding the province before Debi Sing's lease was, from various causes, in a state of declension, and in balance for the revenue of the preceding year, at his very first entrance into office he forced from the zemindars or landed gentry an enormous increase of their tribute. They refused compliance. On this refusal he threw the whole body of zemindars into prison, and thus in bonds and fetters compelled them to sign their own ruin by an increase of rent which they knew they could never realize. Having thus <b>gotten</b> <b>them</b> under, he added exaction to exaction, so that every day announced some new and varied demand, until, exhausted by these oppressions, they were brought to the extremity to which he meant to drive them, the sale of their lands.|$|E
