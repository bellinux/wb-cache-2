40|$|Airlines and Air Navigation Service Providers {{are united}} in their goal to reduce fuel consumption. While changes to flight {{operations}} and technology investments {{are the focus of}} a number of studies, our study is among the first to investigate an untapped source of aviation fuel consumption: excess contingency fuel loading. Given the downside risk of fuel exhaustion of diverting to an alternate airport, airline dispatchers may load excess fuel onto an aircraft. Such conservatism comes at a cost of consuming excess fuel, as fuel consumed is a function of, among other factors, aircraft weight. The aim {{of this paper is to}} quantify, on a per-flight basis, the fuel burned due to carrying fuel beyond what is needed for foreseeable contingencies, and thereby motivate research, federal guidance, and investments that allow airline dispatchers to reduce <b>fuel</b> <b>uplift</b> while maintaining near zero risks of fuel exhaustion. We merge large publicly available aviation and weather databases with a detailed dataset from a major US airline. Upon estimating factors that capture the quantity fuel consumed due to carrying a pound of weight for a range of aircraft types, we calculate the cost and greenhouse gas emissions from carrying unused fuel on arrival and additional contingency fuel above a conservative buffer for foreseeable contingencies. We establish that the major US carrier does indeed load fuel conservatively. We find that 4. 48 % of the fuel consumed by an average flight is due to carrying unused fuel and 1. 04 % of the fuel consumed by an average flight is due to carrying additional contingency fuel above a reasonable buffer. We find that simple changes in flight dispatching that maintain a statistically minimal risk of fuel exhaustion could result in yearly savings of 338 million lbs of CO 2, the equivalent to the fuel consumed from 4760 flights on midsized commercial aircraft. Moreover, policy changes regarding maximum fuel loads or investments that reduce uncertainty or increase the ability to plan flights under uncertainty could yield far greater benefits...|$|E

Customs Officers from the nearby Port of Bluff provide official security services when aircraft are <b>uplifting</b> <b>fuel.</b> Virgin Australia and Qantas are also looking to use Invercargill as a standby technical stopping point for their Queenstown service to Australia, once again due to the benefit of the airport's longer runway.|$|R
500|$|Kaitlyn Hodnicki from Stature {{magazine}} {{was impressed with}} the song, calling it one of the album's more upbeat tracks, which [...] "blooms into another epic soundscape led by [...] vocals and some brilliantly used electronic elements". She felt that the fans' vocal contribution to the song harks back to previous album This Is War without sounding [...] "clich√© or overdone". Sarah O' Hara from Lowdown also responded positively to the track, writing that [...] "glorious chants <b>fuel</b> the <b>uplifting</b> 'Do or Die'". In a mixed review, John Watt from Drowned in Sound called the song [...] "half-baked synth-rock." [...] Markos Papadatos from Digital Journal rated it an A and wrote that [...] "the band soars as whole on this tune", calling Leto's vocals [...] "raw, powerful and captivating." ...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the major}} {{operating}} cost items of an airline company is fuel, which can amount to approximately 20 % of its overall operating cost. This paper presents a decision support model that determines the amount of <b>fuel</b> to be <b>uplifted</b> by a plane at each station along its route over a predetermined planning horizon so as to minimise overall fuel costs. The aforementioned fuel management problem is modelled as a multiple period capacitated inventory problem and solved using linear programming. An example application illustrates the applicability of this model to Middle East Airline's (MEA) operations and summarises the dollar savings obtained by applying it over a one week planning horizon.
