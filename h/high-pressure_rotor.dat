25|$|The turbine {{consists}} of one <b>high-pressure</b> <b>rotor</b> and four low-pressure ones. Five low-pressure separators-preheaters {{are used to}} heat steam with fresh steam before being fed to {{the next stage of}} the turbine. The uncondensed steam is fed into a condenser, mixed with condensate from the separators, fed by the first-stage condensate pump to a chemical purifier, then by a second-stage condensate pump to four deaerators where dissolved and entrained gases are removed; deaerators also serve as storage tanks for feedwater. From the deaerators, the water is pumped through filters and into the bottom parts of the steam separator drums.|$|E

Fault characteristics which is raised by Steam Flow Excitations is reproduced by acceleration constant speed test and load test. Steam flow mechanism of excitation caused by vibration fault and fault-sensitive parameter are analyzed, measures reducing unit vibration has been proposed in line with the conditions. Test results show that: the vibrations caused by the vapor stream excitation occurs mainly in the <b>high-pressure</b> <b>rotor</b> steam inlet end.

40|$|Abstract. A dual-rotor {{calculation}} model which can expand freely in the axial direction is established in this paper, {{and the effects}} of one-dimensional axial temperature distribution on critical speeds of the dual-rotor system are analyzed with finite element method. The temperature distribution of the dual-rotor system is given referring to that of similar aero-engine rotor system. Assuming that the left end temperature remains at 0 ℃, and the highest temperature on the section of the high-pressure turbine disk is 0 ℃, 200 ℃, 400 ℃, 600 ℃, and 800 ℃ respectively, the critical speeds of the dual-rotor system are calculated, analyzed and compared. Calculation results show that, with the increase of the highest temperature of the dual-rotor system, the reduction percentage of the critical speeds increases, and the impact on the first critical speed is most obvious. When the highest temperature is 800 ℃, the first critical speed of the rotor system excited by the low-pressure rotor reduces 13. 13 %, and that excited by the <b>high-pressure</b> <b>rotor</b> reduces 13. 49 %...|$|E
40|$|Although forces {{outside our}} control shape our industry, {{turbomachine}} sealing research, design, and customer agendas established in 1978 by Ludwig, Campbell, and Smith {{in terms of}} specific fuel consumption and performance remain as objectives today. Advances have been made because failures {{of the space shuttle}} main engine turbomachinery ushered in a new understanding of sealing in high-power-density systems. Further, {{it has been shown that}} changes in sealing, especially for <b>high-pressure</b> <b>rotors,</b> dramatically change the performance of the entire engine or turbomachine. Maintaining seal leakages and secondary flows within engine design specifications remains the most efficient and cost effective way to enhance performance and minimize maintenance costs. This three-part review summarizes experiences, ideas, successes, and failures by NASA and the U. S. aerospace industry in secondary flow management in advanced turbomachinery.

40|$|Numerical and {{experimental}} studies are {{performed on the}} influence of several key parameters on the aerodynamic exitation of a <b>high-pressure</b> turbine <b>rotor</b> blade row due to the upstream stator row. In order to change the vane passing frequency two stators with similar vane shapes and identical exit Mach number and exit flow angle are used. To be able to separate subsonic and transonic stator induced flow distortions data is recorded at two different flow regimes. The axial gap between stator and rotor is varied as well. Experiments were run in a closed loop high speed annular wind tunnel. Unsteady velocity data were measured with a three-dimensional Laser-Two-Focus anemometer between stator and rotor and downstream of the rotor. The unsteady part of the instantaneous velocity, the gust, is split into streamwise, transverse and radial components and harmonically decomposed. This data is compared to numerical results obtained with a quasi 3 D method (UNSFLO) and analysed regarding two aspects: the dependency of the gust on the changed parameters and the impact of the gust on the forcing function (blade excitation pressures) ...|$|R
40|$|LecturePg. 55 - 64 The rotordynamic and leaking {{characteristics}} of {{two types of}} gas damper seals, honeycomb seal and pocket damper seal, were experimentally evaluated on a rotating test rig. The effect of supply pressure, preswirl, and seal eccentricity on seal dynamic performance was investigated in the tests. The pressurized working gas flowed through the seal and exhausted to atmospheric conditions. The maximum seal supply pressure was limited to 500 psia. By simulating the rotor experimental unbalance response and amplification factors based on a well-established rotor model, the equivalent stiffness and damping coefficients were estimated for tested gas damper seals. Experimental results confirm that both honeycomb and pocket damper seals provide high positive effective damping. On the other hand, the pocket damper seal increases the first critical speed. A correlation study was performed between the identified rotordynamic coefficients and predictions obtained from existing theoretical models for both honeycomb and pocket damper seals. In this paper is discussed as well a damper seal design {{and its impact on}} the rotordynamic performance of an industrial <b>high-pressure</b> compressor <b>rotor...</b>|$|R

In order to assess the release of Zn within {{the first half of}} the 7 -day exposure, the cell medium was sampled after 3  days of cell exposure, then the cell medium was replaced with a fresh one and again sampled after another 4  days (at the end of the exposure). The selection of the sampling time was in line with the cell viability assessment (NRU assay). Prior to the analysis, 0.75 mL of concentrated nitric acid (65  % HNO 3, pro analysis, Carlo Erba Reagenti, Arese, Italy) was added to 0.75 mL of the cell medium from each of the test vessels. The samples were digested in the Milestone Ethos E (Bergamo, Italy) microwave lab station equipped with an SK- 10 <b>high-pressure</b> segmented <b>rotor</b> and 3  mL quartz microsampling inserts. The digestion was conducted at 180  °C and 600  W power, with step 1 (heating) lasting 15  min, step 2 (constant temperature) lasting 10  min, and cooling to 60  °C lasting 45  min. The total Zn concentrations in the samples were measured by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS; Perkin-Elmer AAnalyst 100, Waltham, MA, USA).|$|R
40|$|This degree {{project in}} applied physics studies the tip gap flows over the rotor blades of a <b>high-pressure</b> turbine. The <b>rotor</b> blade {{used in the}} study has an {{improved}} design that utilizes both a cavity tip and an uneven profiling to reduce turbine loss. The designed rotor blade is shown to admit a 21 % lower leakage mass flow rate across the tip gap than a reference rotor blade with a flat tip. By studying the designed rotor blade using transient CFD, the flow field of the tip gap region has been studied through one blade passage. The flow field characteristics of particular interest are the leakage mass flow rate across the tip gap region, which is proportional to turbine loss, and the characteristic vortices that reside within the cavity tip. By using post-processing scripts, the leakage mass flow rate has been calculated for every time step across one blade passage, showing a strong time dependence. The characteristic vortices are found using two different vortex detection algorithms, and their respective vorticity magnitude is shown to depend on the leakage mass flow rate. The simulation shows that the vorticity magnitude is increasing above a threshold of leakage mass flow rate, and that it is decreasing under this threshold. This effect is shown to destabilize the leakage mass flow rate, increasing its amplitude over its period of one blade passage...|$|R
40|$|In current design {{methods for}} gas {{turbines}} {{there are important}} features of the flow which are not yet {{within the scope of}} the available prediction methods for both the calculation of surface pressures and heat transfer rates. Such features include the prediction of three-dimensional viscous flowfields, the accurate location and strengths of the secondary flow regimes in a turbine passage, and allowance for time-dependent variations. It is the understanding of the time-varying phenomena which {{is the subject of this}} study. Such phenomena occur due to the periodic interaction between stages in a turbine, either that of a nozzle guide vane on a rotor downstream or vice-versa. In most contemporary designs of turbines the effects are due primarily to the wakes from the trailing-edge of the upstream airfoil, and to any associated shock structures resulting from transonic exit flow Mach numbers. The present investigation is concerned with furthering knowedge of these wake and shock interactions, using a method of simulation established in the Isentropic Light Piston Tunnel and Oxford. Measurements of heat transfer rates and pressures are presented, supported by flow visualisation methods such as surface oil-dots and schlieren photography, for two examples of <b>high-pressure</b> turbine <b>rotor</b> blades. The majority of analysis deals with the first of these (a highty-loaded transonic profile) whilst the second blade (designed for use in a large civil engine) is included for investigation of the effects of flow unsteadiness on the film cooling process The transition process is examined in detail by use of wide bandwith heat transfer measurements, and a new method derived for modelling this process. It has been possible to observe the effect of the enhanced turbulence in the simulated nozzle guide vane wake and effects due a shock-boundary layer interaction. The reaction of the blade boundary layers to these disturbances is identified, and trajectories of disturbed events tracked along the blade surfaces. The measurements which have been taken allow for some aspects of wake and shock interactions to be included in the design process for turbine blading. A better understanding has been obtained of how these types of transient flow regimes affect the boundary layers on the blade surfaces. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} {{recent studies have}} shown that {{combustor}} exit temperature distortion can cause excessive heat load of <b>high-pressure</b> turbine (HPT) <b>rotor</b> blades. The heating of HPT rotor blades can lead to thermal fatigue and degrade turbine performance. In order to explore the influence of hot streak temperature ratio on the temperature distributions of HPT airfoil surface, three-dimensional multiblade row unsteady Navier-Stokes simulations have been performed in a vaneless counter-rotating turbine (VCRT). The hot streak temperature ratios from 1. 0 (without hot streak) to 2. 4 were used in these numerical simulations, including 1. 0, 1. 2, 1. 6, 2. 0, and 2. 4 temperature ratios. The hot streak is circular in shape with a diameter equal to 25 % of the span. The center of the hot streak is located at 50 % of span and 0 % of pitch (the leading edge of the HPT stator vane). The predicted results show that the hot streak is relatively unaffected as it migrates through the HPT stator. The hot streak mixes with the vane wake and convects towards the pressure surface (PS) of the HPT rotor when it moves over the vane surface of the HPT stator. The heat load of the HPT rotor increases with the increase of the hot streak temperature ratio. The existence of the inlet temperature distortion induces a thin layer of cooler air in the HPT rotor, which separates the PS of the HPT rotor from the hotter fluid. The numerical results also indicating the migration characteristics of the hot streak in the HPT rotor are predominated by the combined effects of secondary flow and buoyancy. The combined effects that induce the high-temperature fluid migrate towards the hub on the HPT rotor. The effect of the secondary flow on the hotter fluid increases as the hot streak temperature ratio is increased. The influence of buoyancy is directly proportional to the hot streak temperature ratio. The predicted results show that the increase of the hot streak temperature ratio trends to increase the relative Mach number at the HPT rotor outlet, and decrease the relative flow angle from 25 % to 75 % span at the HPT rotor outlet. In the other region of the HPT outlet, the relative flow angle increases when the hot streak temperature ratio is increased. The predicted results also indicate that the isentropic efficiency of the VCRT decreases with the increase of the hot streak temperature ratio...|$|R
