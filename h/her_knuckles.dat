5000|$|In {{one scene}} from the video, Idol forces the barbed-wire wedding ring onto the bride's finger and cuts <b>her</b> <b>knuckle.</b> Lister insisted that <b>her</b> <b>knuckle</b> {{actually}} be cut {{in order for the}} scene to appear more realistic. MTV initially removed this {{scene from the}} video. Also controversial were the apparent Nazi salutes made by the crowd toward the couple.

60|$|She {{leaned across}} the table, on which she had once more plumped her elbows. She {{looked at him in}} a way he had once found fascinating--her chin thrown forward, her cheeks {{supported}} by <b>her</b> <b>knuckles.</b> Little specks of her boa fell into her untouched teacup.|$|E

6000|$|... 'I'd no spirits for mischief,' she answered, with mock pitifulness, {{twinkling}} up her eyes, {{and rubbing}} them with <b>her</b> <b>knuckles</b> {{as if she}} were crying.

60|$|When she exerted the {{pressure}} {{she cried out}} with pain, for she had succeeded only in hurting herself. Billy grinned at her futility.

60|$|She {{opened the}} door and looked across the alley, and saw with some {{satisfaction}} that his blind was illuminated.

So simultaneous were the two happenings that it actually appeared as though the closing of the door had blown Mr. Wilks's lamp out. It was a night of surprises, but after a moment's hesitation she stepped over and tried his door. It was fast, and there was no answer to <b>her</b> <b>knuckling.</b> She knocked louder and listened.

60|$|By {{this time}} she had crept to the slumbering boy's side, with the candle, shaded, in her hand.

60|$|Meanwhile Ruth, {{having given}} vent to a sob of relief {{when the man}} left her, ran towards home {{as fast as she}} could, never pausing till she reached the Miss Seawards' door, which chanced to be a little nearer than her own.

60|$|The woman put <b>her</b> <b>knuckles</b> {{into her}} eyes, and wailed {{out that it}} was all for her poor children, and Cicely reproved him for his roughness, and as the woman kept close behind them, wailing, moaning, and persuading, the boy and girl were wrought upon at last to give her leave to wait outside the gate of the inn garden, while they saw whether it was {{possible}} to admit her or her basket.|$|E
