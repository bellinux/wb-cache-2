500|$|On March 5, 2009 at the O2 Arena, Jackson {{announced}} that he was to perform 10 concerts as part of a comeback. Jackson suggested likely post-show retirement by stating: [...] "I {{just wanted to say that}} these will be my final show performances in London. When <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> is it, it really means this is it, this will be the final curtain call." [...] On March 11, two days before pre-sale began, an extra 40 dates were added to meet high demand, bringing the number of shows to 50— five of these dates were reserved in their entirety for the public sale. Jackson's 50 dates would make the concerts the longest residency at the arena. In May 2009, the show was originally set to have begun on July 8, 2009, and finished on March 6, 2010.|$|E
500|$|Jack Matlock, US {{ambassador}} to the Soviet Union during its final years, said that the West gave a [...] "clear commitment" [...] not to expand, and declassified documents indicate that Soviet negotiators were given the oral impression by diplomats like Hans-Dietrich Genscher and James Baker that NATO membership was off the table for countries such as Czechoslovakia, Hungary, or Poland. In 1996, Gorbachev wrote in his Memoirs, that [...] "during the negotiations on the unification of Germany they gave assurances that NATO would not extend its zone of operation to the east," [...] and repeated this view {{in an interview in}} 2008. However, in 2014, Gorbachev said [...] "The topic of ‘NATO expansion’ was not discussed at all , and it wasn’t brought up in those years. <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> with full responsibility. Western leaders didn’t bring it up, either." [...] Eduard Shevardnadze, foreign minister of the Soviet Union between 1985 and 1991, has always maintained that [...] "NATO’s expansion beyond German borders never came up for negotiation." [...] According to Robert Zoellick, a State Department official involved in the Two Plus Four negotiating process, no formal commitment regarding enlargement was made.|$|E

500|$|On January 19, 2012, Stallone {{stated that}} the film was being aimed at a PG-13 audience. Unlike the first film (which was {{restricted}} to viewers over age 17), this {{would have made the}} sequel available to all viewers over 13 years of age (and younger children, with parental consent). The reported change received a negative reception. Speaking to Ain't It Cool News about the change, Stallone said [...] "The PG-13 rumor is true, but before your readers pass judgement, trust me when <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> film is large in every way and delivers on every level." [...] It was reported that the change was requested by Norris before he would take part in the film, because he did not appreciate the swearing in the script. However, these plans for a more family-friendly rating did not succeed and the finished film was rated R. When the adult-oriented rating was confirmed shortly before release, West stated that [...] "the shooting style and the dialogue, from day one, it was R-rated." [...] However, the visual effects supervisor said that The Expendables 2 was shot as a PG-13 film, with all bullet wounds being dust-hits. Once it was decided that the film would be R-rated, blood, decapitations, eviscerations and severed limbs were digitally added in post-production.|$|E
500|$|Stockhausen's two early Electronic Studies (especially the second) had a {{powerful}} influence on the subsequent development of electronic music in the 1950s and 1960s, particularly {{in the work of}} the Italian Franco Evangelisti and the Poles Andrzej Dobrowolski and Włodzimierz Kotoński [...] The influence of his Kontra-Punkte, Zeitmasse and Gruppen may be seen in the work of many composers, including Igor Stravinsky's Threni (1957–58) and Movements for piano and orchestra (1958–59) and other works up to the Variations: Aldous Huxley In Memoriam (1963–64), whose rhythms [...] "are likely to have been inspired, at least in part, by certain passages from Stockhausen's Gruppen" [...] Though music of Stockhausen's generation may seem an unlikely influence, Stravinsky said in a 1957 conversation: I have all around me the spectacle of composers who, after their generation has had its decade of influence and fashion, seal themselves off from further development and from the next generation (as <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>this,</b> exceptions come to mind, Krenek, for instance). Of course, it requires greater effort to learn from one's juniors, and their manners are not invariably good.

The same day, Spears uploaded {{a picture of the}} cover art to her Twitter account. Kesha told MTV News, [...] "I'm a massive fan of both the ladies I share the track with. I wrote 'TTWE' for Britney [...] and she killed it and I loved it, but I just thought a supergroup of three hot, strong women could just take over the airwaves." [...] The remix adds heavier bass during the beginning, and starts with Minaj rapping with intensity about a female hater, in lines such as [...] "Told you they'd revive your career, but somebody lied/ I ain't talkin' poultry when <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> chicken's fried." [...] This continues by Spears singing the first verse, after which Minaj says [...] "It's Britney, bitch. I'm Nicki Minaj and that's Kesha!", and the first chorus is sung by the latter. Spears continues with the song and is accompanied by Kesha {{towards the end of the}} second verse and the bridge. The remix also features a dubstep breakdown, reminiscent of [...] "Hold It Against Me".|$|E

[...] He {{also referred to}} [...] "Fast Lane" [...] {{as one of the}} highlight songs of the album. Rolling Stone gave a positive review. According to Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone, [...] "Eminem kicks 'Fast Lane' 1999-style, reconnecting with the hungry young lunatic who sounded like he only had a stanza to blow us away or it was back to the auto plant." [...] Dolan also commented on the infamous lyric [...] "I hope that I don't sound too heinous when <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>this,</b> Nicki Minaj, but I wanna stick my penis in your anus," [...] saying that Eminem has been much more heinous before. According to Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly, Royce da 5'9" [...] performs extremely well on the [...] "hard-hitting" [...] song, even calling him a [...] "lyrical beast". Although music website Consequence of Sound gave a rather mixed review on the EP as a whole, editor Winston Robbins favored [...] "Fast Lane" [...] and said that it is [...] "hands down one of the best hip-hop tracks of 2011" [...] and that the rapping is [...] "second to none".|$|E

[...] According to Hürriyet Daily News Semih Idiz, some Turkish citizens are even suggesting that those involved with the Mavi Marmara incident should also bring charges against the Turkish state for playing a prominent role in supporting the Mavi Marmara's mission and for failing to prevent the death of nine Turks on the ship.|$|E
2500|$|The {{announcement}} of Jackson's first 10 performances {{was made by}} the singer himself, during a press conference at the O2 Arena on March 5, 2009. As many as 7,000 fans and 350 reporters awaited the singer's arrival, many donning Jackson-related clothing. The singer commented at the conference, [...] "I {{just wanted to say that}} these will be my final show performances in London. When <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> is it, it really means this is it", adding that it was his [...] "final curtain call", although he may have just been referring to performing in London. Organizers touted the residency as, [...] "dramatic shows [...] promise an explosive return with a band of the highest calibre, a state-of-the-art stage show and incredible surprise support acts". Hours before the press conference, promotional posters for the residency were displayed around London. Further promotion took up an entire commercial break period on ITV London during Dancing on Ice, the first time this has ever happened for a musical artist. The advert, which cost £1 million to air, was viewed by 11 million people.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2007 Beat the Blizzard webzine's article, {{the writer}} Jan Lindsø states that [...] "any metal fans {{are of the}} opinion that Christians should 'not be allowed' to use the black metal {{aesthetics}} musically since they do not inherit this evil and perhaps misantropic [...] trait that many people say is necessary in order to be convincing as black metal musicians". Kittil Kittilsen, who left Mayhem in 1988 after becoming a born-again Christian, expressed his concern for the unblack metal musicians: [...] "I think they're completely off the mark. I cannot seriously understand how they even manage to do it. They have missed the target completely. I mean, {{if you want to be}} a Christian, be it with all you've got, and if you want to be metal, be it with all you've got. If those people really took their faith seriously, and followed the instructions of the One they profess to believe in, they would never be found in a context like that. They are on collision course with Christian life and teaching. <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> because of my own experience, and because of what is written in the Bible; rock music, metal music has nothing at all to do in a Christian setting!" ...|$|E

2500|$|For {{the third}} convention, the city hall in Syracuse, New York was {{selected}} as the site. Because Syracuse was nearer to Seneca Falls (two days' travel by horse, several hours' journey by rail), more of the original signers of the Declaration of Sentiments were able to attend than the previous two conventions in Massachusetts. Lucretia Mott was named president; at one point she felt it necessary to silence a minister who offended the assembly by using biblical references to keep women subordinate to men. A letter from Elizabeth Cady Stanton was read and its resolutions voted on. At sessions taking place September 8–10, 1852, Susan B. Anthony and Matilda Joslyn Gage made their first public speeches on women's rights. Ernestine Rose spoke denouncing duties without rights, saying [...] "as a woman has to pay taxes to maintain government, she has a right to participate in the formation and administration of it." [...] Antoinette Brown called for more women to become ministers, claiming that the Bible did not forbid it. Ernestine Rose stood up in response, saying that the Bible should not be used as the authority for settling a dispute, especially as it contained much contradiction regarding women. Elizabeth Oakes Smith called for women to have their own journal so that they could become independent of the male-owned press, saying [...] "We should have a literature of our own, a printing press and a publishing house, and tract writers and distributors, as well as lectures and conventions; and yet <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> to a race of beggars, for women have no pecuniary resources." [...] Antoinette Brown lectured about how masculine law can never fully represent womankind. Lucy Stone wore a trousered dress often referred to as [...] "bloomers", a more practical style she had picked up during the summer after meeting Amelia Bloomer. She spoke to say [...] "The woman who first departs from the routine in which society allows her to move must suffer. Let us bravely bear ridicule and persecution {{for the sake of the}} good that will result, and when the world sees that we can accomplish what we undertake, it will acknowledge our right."
