In this paper we discuss imposed methods to charge infrastructure used in Slovakia and abroad. Further analysed are various <b>electronic</b> <b>toll</b> systems applied in chosen Central European country and Slovakia. All the <b>electronic</b> <b>toll</b> systems used in the Slovak Republic and Poland are successively analysed. The last section of this thesis focuses on the <b>electronic</b> <b>toll</b> system in Slovakia and its impact on road freight transport via comparison of fixed transport route costs using highway signs and <b>electronic</b> <b>toll</b> collection...|$|R

40|$|Diploma thesis {{presents}} {{information about}} <b>electronic</b> <b>toll</b> {{system in the}} Czech Republic with the gist being aimed on economy and effectiveness of the system in use. The theme is discussed in separate parts, where the first part consists of explanation of basic terms about road infrastructure, toll system and its functionality in the Czech Republic. Next part is revealing information about public sector and its economy, efficiency and effectiveness that are essential for measuring public sector, and its administrative costs. In the analytical part is evaluated economy of <b>electronic</b> <b>toll</b> with the usage of findings from administrative costs of <b>electronic</b> <b>toll</b> and with its earning. <b>Electronic</b> <b>toll</b> is analyzed as well from the view where are put into comparison domestic and foreign and their weight on the toll and as well from {{the view of the}} amount of truck carriers that were using Czech road system before and after <b>electronic</b> <b>toll</b> was introduced.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{tests the}} {{hypothesis}} that the salience of a tax system affects equilibrium tax rates. To do this, I analyze how toll rates change after <b>toll</b> facilities adopt <b>electronic</b> <b>toll</b> collection. Unlike manual toll collection, in which the driver must hand over cash at the <b>toll</b> collection plaza, <b>electronic</b> <b>toll</b> collection automatically debits the toll amount as the car drives through the toll plaza, thereby plausibly decreasing the salience of the toll. I find robust evidence that toll rates increase following the adoption of <b>electronic</b> <b>toll</b> collection. My estimates suggest that, in steady state, toll rates are 20 to 40 percent higher than they would have been without <b>electronic</b> <b>toll</b> collection. Consistent with {{the hypothesis that}} decreased tax salience is responsible for the increase in toll rates, I also find evidence that the short run elasticity of driving with respect to the actual toll declines (in absolute value) following the adoption of <b>electronic</b> <b>toll</b> collection. I consider a variety of alternative explanations for these results and conclude that these are unlikely to be able to explain the findings.

The {{goal of this}} project was to identify appropriate technologies and conditions to implement open road <b>electronic</b> <b>toll</b> collection systems {{in the form of}} public-private partnerships on California's highway system. This research pursued two major objectives and provided practical guidelines and recommendations regarding Open Road <b>Electronic</b> <b>Toll</b> Collection technologies. The six deliverable document have been concatenated into one document.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{tests the}} {{hypothesis}} that the salience of a tax system affects equilibrium tax rates. I analyze how toll rates change after <b>toll</b> facilities adopt <b>electronic</b> <b>toll</b> collection, under which tolls are automatically deducted as the car drives through the toll plaza, eliminating the need to hand over cash. A survey I conducted indicates that drivers are much less aware of toll rates when they pay electronically. I find that, in steady state, toll rates are 20 to 40 percent higher than they would have been without <b>electronic</b> <b>toll</b> collection. Two additional findings support {{the hypothesis that}} <b>electronic</b> <b>toll</b> collection increases the toll rate by decreasing its salience: following adoption of <b>electronic</b> <b>toll</b> collection, the short run elasticity of driving with respect to the toll declines (in absolute value), and toll setting behavior becomes less sensitive to the local election calendar. I consider a variety of alternative explanations for these results and conclude that these are unlikely to be able to explain the findings.
