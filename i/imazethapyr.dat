The chemical structures of these chemicals all closely resemble one another, with the compounds containing an identical imidazolinone ring structure with a carboxylic acid group {{attached to the}} backbone. They vary only in the attached ring structure. These six herbicides kill plants by inhibiting acetohydroxy acid synthase (AHAS). AHAS is the first enzyme in the branched-chain amino acid pathway that eventually ends in the synthesis of amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine.|$|E

40|$|<b>Imazethapyr</b> was {{recently}} approved {{for use in}} rice, but limited information is available regarding its efficacy, environmental fate or potential red rice resistance. Therefore, experiments were conducted to 1) {{determine the effect of}} flooding time, and stage of <b>imazethapyr</b> application in red rice control, 2) assess the acetolactate synthase resistance to <b>imazethapyr</b> on red rice ecotypes, 3) determine the relative photolysis of <b>imazethapyr,</b> and 4) determine the effect of soil and moisture on <b>imazethapyr</b> adsorption and availability. When <b>imazethapyr</b> was applied in sequential application of PRE followed by a POST application, to achieve > 95 % red rice control, flood needed to be established within 14 DAT when <b>imazethapyr</b> was applied EPOST, and 7 DAT when <b>imazethapyr</b> was applied LPOST. Delaying the flood up to 21 DAT reduced rice grain yield for both EPOST and LPOST application timings. Based on enzymatic activity, the mean I 50 values were 1. 5, 1. 1, 1. 5, 1. 6, 20. 8, and 590. 6 mM of <b>imazethapyr,</b> respectively, for LA 5, MS 5, TX 4, ??Cypress??, ??CL- 121 ??, and ??CL- 161 ??. CL- 161 was 32 times more resistant than CL- 121, and at least 420 times more resistant than the average of the red rice ecotypes and ??Cypress??. Results from the ALS assay showed that red rice ecotypes and Cypress had high susceptibility to <b>imazethapyr</b> when compared with the tolerant CL- 121 and the resistant CL- 161. Measurable enzymatic tolerance to ALS-inhibiting herbicides has not yet developed in these red rice ecotypes. <b>Imazethapyr</b> quantum yield (fI) was 0. 023 ?? 0. 002 while the hydroxyl radical rate constant (I OH k??) was 2. 8 ?? 0. 44 x 1013 M- 1 h- 1. These results show that <b>imazethapyr</b> is susceptible to both direct and indirect photolysis. The results also show that <b>imazethapyr</b> photolysis in paddy water will be affected by turbidity due to its impact on the availability of sunlight to drive direct and indirect photolysis reactions. <b>Imazethapyr</b> was more available and more concentrated in sandy soil.

40|$|O <b>imazethapyr</b> está sendo amplamente utilizado no Rio Grande do Sul desde o desenvolvimento da Tecnologia Clearfield® (CL) em arroz, em uma mistura formulada de <b>imazethapyr</b> + imazapic (75 + 25 g L- 1). No entanto, com o uso dessa tecnologia, surgiu o problema da persistência do herbicida no solo, afetando cultivos não tolerantes em sucessão com diferentes intensidades. A fitointoxicação está relacionada, dentre vários fatores, à localização do herbicida no perfil do solo. O presente trabalho teve por objetivo determinar o posicionamento do <b>imazethapyr</b> em profundidade, no perfil de um solo de várzea cultivado com arroz, frente a dois tipos de manejo. Foram coletadas amostras de solos, em diferentes profundidades (0 - 5, 5 - 10, 10 - 15 e 15 - 20 cm), do solo de várzea sob dois sistemas de manejo: plantio convencional (PC) e plantio direto (PD), em uma área onde havia sido utilizado arroz CL por dois anos e no terceiro ano, arroz não tolerante. A concentração do herbicida no solo foi analisada por HPLC-DAD. Há maior concentração de <b>imazethapyr</b> na superfície do solo (0 - 5 cm), no sistema convencional, quando comparado com o sistema de plantio direto, e o herbicida lixiviou até 20 cm nos dois sistemas. No PC, ocorreu uma distribuição uniforme do <b>imazethapyr</b> nos primeiros 15 cm de solo, enquanto que, no PD, constatou-se acúmulo de <b>imazethapyr</b> nas camadas de 5 - 10 e 10 - 15 cm. <b>Imazethapyr</b> {{has been}} widely used in Rio Grande do Sul since the {{development}} of Clearfield TechnologyTM(CL) on rice, in a formulated mixture of <b>imazethapyr</b> + imazapic (75 + 25 g L- 1).

The AR 1 and MS 1 populations were cross-resistant to bispyribac-sodium; however, AR 2 was sensitive to bispyribac-sodium. The AR 1, AR 2, and MS 1 populations were > 94, > 94, and 3. 3 times, respectively, more resistant to imazamox; > 94, 30, and 9. 4 times, respectively, more resistant to penoxsulam; and 15, 0. 9, and 7. 2 times, respectively, more resistant to bispyribac-sodium compared to a susceptible population. Addition of malathion to penoxsulam reduced dry weight of all populations and increased mortality of AR 2 and MS 1 populations compared to penoxsulam alone.

The research objective with this work was to determine the persistence of <b>imazethapyr,</b> imazapic and their mixture in three soils in the Brazilian state of Tocantins. Three experiments were conducted in a completely randomized design with four replications, each corresponding to the evaluated soil (Haplic Plinthosol (FX), red-yellow Latosol (LVA) and Haplic Gleysol (GX)). The treatments were arranged in a split plot design, with the allocated plots herbicides (<b>imazethapyr</b> and imazapic alone and commercial mixture) and the plots allocated the 11 evaluation times (1, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120, 135, 150 days after treatment (DAT)), and a control without application. Contacted up long residual effect of <b>imazethapyr</b> and commercial mixture of <b>imazethapyr</b> and imazapic, regardless of assessed soil. After 150 days of applying herbicides or the commercial mixture, their residues in the soil also inhibited approximately 94 % of the mass of the dry matter accumulation of the indicator plants. When imazapic was applied alone, there was a higher dry matter accumulation of the indicator plants, indicating less residual effect of this herbicide in the soil and this was attributed to the lower dose of this herbicide applied. The attributes of the soil pH, texture and iron oxides were what most affected the persistence of the herbicides. It can be concluded that the persistence of <b>imazethapyr</b> and imazapic is too long in the Brazilian state of Tocantins soils and the use of these herbicides in the region should be avoided due to the high risk of the occurrence of carryover,or be well planned, as land use in rotation for susceptible crops...|$|E

The presence of humic acids in the solution reduced the rate of photodegradation for all three herbicides, with higher concentrations of humic acids generally having greater effect. Photodegradation of <b>imazethapyr</b> was the least sensitive to humic acids. The enantioselectivity of photodegradation was investigated using imazaquin, with photodegradation occurring at the same rate for both enantiomers.

A secondary experiment was designed to test the effect of <b>imazethapyr</b> application timing and rate on plant height, fresh weight, and dry weight in Eagle Lake and Beaumont, TX in 2010 with a greenhouse experiment in College Station, TX in 2009. 	 The 2008 and 2009 field trials were planted at three different densities, (28, 39, and 50 kg ha- 1) with two different planting dates representing the months of March and April. Herbicide treatments consisted of four 1 - to 2 -leaf rates of <b>imazethapyr</b> that included 0. 035, 0. 07, 0. 105, and 0. 14 kg ha- 1, followed by two 4 - to 6 -leaf rates of <b>imazethapyr</b> of 0. 07 and 0. 105 kg ha- 1. Rice showed injury symptoms two weeks after the second application of <b>imazethapyr</b> but was able to recover soon after nitrogen fertilizer application and flood establishment. Grain yield was not significantly different in plots that received a full labeled rate of <b>imazethapyr</b> or more for either location in either year. 	The 2009 greenhouse study and 2010 field studies included treatments that had one early post at 1 - to 2 -leaf and one of two different late post applications that included either a 3 - to 4 -leaf or a 5 - to 6 -leaf treatment. The three rates included in the early 1 - to 2 -leaf application were 0, 0. 035 and 0. 07 kg ai ha- 1. The four rates included in the late application were 0, 0. 07, 0. 105, and 0. 14 kg ai ha- 1. Plants treated with the labeled rate, 0. 07 to 0. 105 kg ai ha- 1 at each 1 - to 2 -leaf and 3 - to 6 -leaf stage, showed no significant differences in yield, or quality; however, significant differences were recorded in height. According to this data, hybrid rice seems to be tolerant to <b>imazethapyr</b> applications and timings...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge of the {{potential}} for herbicide residues to persist and damage rotational crops is important when developing and recommending weed management strategies. Peanut growers have begun using the imidazolinone herbicides imazapic (Cadre) and <b>imazethapyr</b> (Pursuit). These residual herbicides control a broad spectrum of broadleaf weeds plus nutsedge species. Cotton, which can be injured by residues of imidazolinone herbicides, commonly is rotated with peanut in North Carolina and across the southeastern production region. Field experiments were conducted in North Carolina {{to determine the effects of}} imazapic and <b>imazethapyr</b> applied to peanut on the growth and yield of cotton planted the following year.
