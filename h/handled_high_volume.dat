40|$|Radio-frequency {{identification}} (RFID) {{is the use}} of {{a wireless}} non-contact system that uses radio-frequency electromagnetic fields to transfer data from a tag attached to an object, for the purposes of automatic identification and tracking. RFID offers a number of advantages over previous ID systems. For example, unlike barcodes, RFID tags don't require "line of sight" to the tag reader, while barcode scanners need to directly "see" to read the barcode. Standard barcodes only identify the manufacturer and product, not unique items, and RFID allows for individual items to have a unique identifier and can identify many items at once. We presented a new novel approach for inference and compression over the RFID Stream. It address the problem occur in previous work such as incomplete data, <b>handle</b> <b>high</b> <b>volumes</b> of data, and lack in identifying location of objects. This low-level substrate offers accurate interpretation of incomplete and noisy raw data. In particular, it infers locations of unobserved objects and inter-object relationships using probabilistic algorithms. To <b>handle</b> <b>high</b> data <b>volume,</b> it performs online interpretation, enabling online compression by identifying and discarding redundant dat...|$|R
50|$|Therefore, the {{programmability}} {{of complex}} relationships for {{large numbers of}} users and <b>handling</b> <b>high</b> <b>volume</b> of products and information in parallel is æternity's strong suit. Only the parties who participated in a smart contract know about the contents of that smart contract. When a channel is settled on-chain, {{the only way it}} changes the Blockchain state is by changing account balances. No contract state is stored on-chain, so all channels are independent from each other. Transaction speed is limited only by bandwidth, so the æternity system can scale as well as or even better than known centralized solutions available today.|$|R

Their design has considered the requirements of hydraulic and environmental safety, the environmental and landscape integration and the relationship with local communities. All rolling tanks will be held clean and without materials and wastes and will be subjected to periodic cutting of lawns. The excavations {{for the construction of}} rolling tanks and ancillary works require the movement of large quantities of land for which a balance has been made between the land to be reused in the arrangement of slopes, embankments, artifacts and landscaping items and the land to be disposed in landfills.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen rapid growth of online {{services}} that rely on large-scale server clusters to <b>handle</b> <b>high</b> <b>volume</b> of requests. Such clusters must adaptively control the CPU utilizations of many processors {{in order to maintain}} desired soft real-time performance and prevent system overload in face of unpredictable workloads. This paper presents DUC-LB, a novel distributed utilization control algorithm for cluster-based soft real-time applications. Compared to earlier works on utilization control, a distinguishing feature of DUC-LB is its capability to handle system dynamics caused by load balancing, which is a common and essential component of most clusters today. Simulation results and control-theoretic analysis demonstrate that DUC-LB can provide robust utilization control and effective load balancing in large-scale clusters. 1...|$|R
50|$|In late 2004 {{the leaders}} of the 4 {{participating}} countries; Benjamin Mkapa (Tanzania), Joaquim Chissano (Mozambique), Bingu wa Mutharika (Malawi) and Levy Mwanawasa (Zambia) managed to sign a Memorandum of Understanding to make the Mtwara Development Corridor a reality. The aim of the corridor was to create competitive transport links for the region to help boost the informal and formal industry. The project was to help regional integration to facilitate growth in agriculture, fisheries, tourism and the minning sector. The development project involved building and rehabilitating over 800 km of roads and involved the construction of Unity Bridge. Furthermore the ports of Mtwara and Mbamba Bay were to be upgraded to <b>handle</b> <b>high</b> <b>volumes</b> of cargo.|$|R

30|$|Messages are {{represented}} as Erlang tuple data structures that consist of message identifier, a sender identifier, a message {{body and a}} timestamp. We implemented two message filtering rules that apply the principle of combining static with temporal filtering, as discussed in Section 3. Both rules were coded so that they execute in constant memory space. This makes possible to <b>handle</b> <b>high</b> <b>volumes</b> of message traffic without exceeding the phone’s available memory. All received messages are stored in an ordered list that is reordered each time a new message is received, using {{a modified version of}} the Quicksort algorithm. The list is pruned periodically by applying the sliding time window principle, i.e., removing broadcast messages over 2 minutes old and team messages over 5 minutes old.|$|R

Hence, the need for a methodology able to <b>handle</b> <b>high</b> <b>volumes</b> of data in terms of both cardinality (due to the high number of uncertainties included in the analysis) and dimensionality (due to the complexity of systems) arises.

50|$|The station {{opened with}} the opening of the South Wales Railway to serve what was then a growing suburb. In the early 20th Century, over 400,000 tickets were issued each year (due in part to close {{proximity}} to the Ely Racecourse), and the station also <b>handled</b> <b>high</b> <b>volumes</b> of freight from the Ely Paper Mills and Creswell's Brewery. After the 1923 grouping of railway companies, the suffix 'Main Line' was added (the Great Western Railway added suffixes to many stations in South Wales at around this time to ease confusion). Despite its earlier popularity, the station's profits slumped in the postwar years. After April 1959, only four trains per day (two in each direction) called at Ely Main Line, and the weekend services with withdrawn.|$|R
50|$|Starting in the 1960s, {{parts of}} the route were {{expanded}} to four lanes. A section of freeway was built in Burlington and expressway in Glenwood.

In the 1990s and 2000s, the highway between Ottumwa and West Burlington was widened to four lanes as part of a project to improve the Des Moines-to-Burlington corridor.
