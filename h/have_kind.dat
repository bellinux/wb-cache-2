500|$|Simple {{movements}} {{were developed by}} their choreographers, including Leeanne Ashley, to accompany each song because, as The New York Times reported, they believed [...] "in the power of basic movements to enchant young children". [...] According to reporter Anders Wright, they intentionally made mistakes in their dance moves {{in order to identify}} more with their young audience. [...] The group incorporated more dancing into their performances after the birth of Field's oldest daughter in 2004. [...] "So [...] Wiggles <b>have</b> <b>kind</b> of become a bit more, dare I say, girly. Dorothy (the Dinosaur) does ballet now and we dance as well a lot more than we did", Field reported. [...] In later years, corresponding with Field's developing interests in acrobatics and gymnastics, they added these elements to their stage shows, including, as Field reported, hiring several world-class athletes such as former trampoline champion Karl Shore. [...] Watkins, whom Paul Field called [...] "a dancer of many disciplines", was initially hired as a member of their troupe and referred to herself as [...] "mainly a dancer".|$|E

Rather than wallowing in [...] "the hard stuff", the record's theme reflects on looking for solutions and happiness. In an interview with MTV News, Lee said about the album's title: I feel like I {{have the ability to}} do a lot of things I couldn't do before, for a number of reasons......A lot of doors <b>have</b> <b>kind</b> of been opened in my life—not just since everything has happened for us. The singer also felt the band [...] "broke the doors" [...] and tried doing different things, which was also an inspiration for the title. Simon Cosyns of The Sun labelled the record's artwork—which sees Lee in front of an open door—as [...] " [...] the dark Evanescence image intact, with sinister fairytale scenes, elaborate Victorian gothic arches, illuminated typography and elaborate flowing dresses". Dane Prokofiev of PopMatters praised the album cover, calling it [...] " [...] gother-looking piece." ...|$|E

500|$|A Very Merry Unauthorized Children's Scientology Pageant {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} the press. [...] A review in The New York Times described the musical {{as having a}} [...] "crude, faux-naïf sensibility", and stated that it [...] "provides a cult-hit blueprint for a young generation that prefers its irony delivered with not a wink but a blank stare." [...] A 2003 review in New York City's The Village Voice compared the show to The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui, stating: [...] "Just as Ui doesn't explain the complex phenomenon of the Third Reich, Scientology Pageant doesn't probe the psychology of cults; instead, both demystify subjects whose appeal stems {{in no small part}} from the mystique their acolytes have attributed to them." [...] Though most of the media reception of the musical was positive, New York Church of Scientology President John Carmichael did not <b>have</b> <b>kind</b> words for the production. [...] Carmichael asserted that L. Ron Hubbard was portrayed in the play as [...] "an authoritarian demagogue whose methods create emotionless followers." [...] Other critics complained that the young members of the cast were portraying characters and depicting content that they could not understand.|$|E
500|$|For the 30th {{anniversary of}} The Joshua Tree, U2 staged a 2017 concert tour in North America, Europe, and Latin America, {{on which the}} album was played in its {{entirety}} at each show. It {{was the first time}} the group toured in promotion of an album from their back catalogue, rather than a new release. As part of the tour, U2 headlined the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Manchester, Tennessee in June. In rationalising the tour, the Edge cited the 2016 US presidential election and other world events for what he judged to be renewed resonance of The Joshua Trees subject matter. He said that in looking at the record's anniversary, [...] "things <b>have</b> <b>kind</b> of come full circle, if you want. That record was written in the mid-Eighties, during the Reagan–Thatcher era of British and U.S. politics. It was a period when there was a lot of unrest. Thatcher was in the throes of trying to put down the miners' strike; there was all kinds of shenanigans going on in Central America. It feels like we're right back there in a way. I don't think any of our work has ever come full circle to that extent. It just felt like, 'Wow, these songs have a new meaning and a new resonance today that they didn't have three years ago, four years ago.'" ...|$|E

60|$|And then there's the Education Question--not that I can {{see that}} there's {{anything}} to worry about in that direction. To my mind, education is an absurdly over-rated affair. At least, one never took it very seriously at school, where everything was done to bring it prominently under one's notice. Anything that is worth knowing one practically teaches oneself, and the rest obtrudes itself sooner or later. The reason one's elders know so comparatively little is {{because they have to}} unlearn so much that they acquired by way of education before we were born. Of course I'm a believer in Nature-study; as I said to Lady Beauwhistle, if you want a lesson in elaborate artificiality, just watch the studied unconcern of a Persian cat entering a crowded salon, and then go and practise it for a fortnight. The Beauwhistles weren't born in the Purple, you know, but they're getting there on the instalment system--so much down, and the rest when you feel like it.
