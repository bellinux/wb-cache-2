Several paratypes have also been referred: a jugal, a toothless lower jaw fragment, centra from vertebrae, the distal <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> scapula, the proximal <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> second phalanx <b>of</b> the left wing finger and the proximal <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> left femur, <b>of</b> which, however, the head has broken off. The remains were found at the Shakh-Shakh locality.|$|R
5|$|A {{ceremony}} at the Cenotaph in Whitehall, London on 4 August 2004, marked the 90th anniversary of Britain's entry into the First World War. Allingham attended, together with three other First World War veterans, William Stone, Fred Lloyd and John Oborne. Allingham also marched past the Cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday in 2005 and laid wreaths at memorials in Saint-Omer on Armistice Day. That {{was the last time}} a First World War veteran marched past the Cenotaph and it marked the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> era. No First World War veterans were present at the Cenotaph for the 2006 Remembrance Sunday Parade.|$|E
5|$|A {{still more}} {{resonant}} {{aspect of his}} legacy was the uniform rewriting of Roman law, the Corpus Juris Civilis, which is still the basis of civil law in many modern states. His reign also marked a blossoming of Byzantine culture, and his building program yielded such masterpieces as the church of Hagia Sophia. A devastating outbreak of bubonic plague in the early 540s marked the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> age of splendour.|$|E
5|$|According to the Holy Land Handicraft Cooperative Society, the blowing {{technique}} employed is {{the same}} as was used by the ancient Phoenicians, though archaeologists and historians of glass agree that glassblowing was not common until the last few centuries BCE. Molten glass is withdrawn from a furnace on the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> iron pipe, which is blown into as a metal tool called a kammasha is used to shape the glass. It is returned to the furnace and reshaped by the same process before being detached from the pipe and placed into a cooling chamber.|$|E

5|$|Bose {{commented that}} Ganguly's {{greatest}} legacy {{lay in his}} influence on the younger and budding generation of cricketers. Ganguly felt that every young player should play two years of domestic cricket before being selected for international assignments. He also said that every newcomer should be given at least five games to prove himself. Later he explained that being at the receiving <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> unfair decision against him, that threatened to ruin his international cricket career, it enabled him to understand the insecurities of other newcomers in the team better than his predecessors. Ganguly had always backed the influence and contribution of younger players of the team.|$|E
5|$|Growth in the Northeast was {{accompanied}} by the creation of moral reform organizations, such as Sunday schools, temperance associations, tract and Bible societies, and orphanages. The proliferation of voluntary organizations was encouraged by postmillennialism, {{the belief that the}} Second Coming of Christ would occur at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> era of peace and prosperity fostered by human effort. The 1815 General Assembly recommended the creation of societies to promote morality. Organizations such as the American Bible Society, the American Sunday School Union, and the American Colonization Society, while theoretically interdenominational, were dominated by Presbyterians and considered unofficial agencies of the Presbyterian Church.|$|E
5|$|In Budapest Tales (1976), Szabó traded his earlier, complex {{narrative}} structures, {{characterized by}} flashbacks and dreams, {{for a more}} linear one. At the same time, he traded the literal representation of history for an allegorical one. The film follows a disparate {{group of people who}} come together on the outskirts of an unnamed city at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> unnamed war to repair a damaged tram and ride it into the city. Allegorically, the film was interpreted by critics variously as representing Hungarian history specifically or universal human responses to war and reconstruction more generally.|$|E

5|$|In DNA, fraying {{occurs when}} non-complementary regions exist at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{otherwise}} complementary double-strand of DNA. However, branched DNA can occur if a third strand of DNA is introduced and contains adjoining regions able to hybridize with the frayed {{regions of the}} pre-existing double-strand. Although the simplest example of branched DNA involves only three strands of DNA, complexes involving additional strands and multiple branches are also possible. Branched DNA {{can be used in}} nanotechnology to construct geometric shapes, see the section on uses in technology below.|$|E
5|$|Kaniakapūpū {{is located}} at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> unmarked trail off the Pali Highway. The {{property}} is near the Luakaha Falls, and the surrounding area and trail leading up to the site are covered by a forest of invasive bamboo. Periodic clearing is necessary in order to halt the deteriorating effects of invasive root growth. The trail and ruins, which are located in a protected watershed, are officially off-limits to the public, although state DLNR officials do not regularly monitor the site. Trespassers are subjected to citations if caught.|$|E
5|$|Spiritual Machines {{has been}} noted as being the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> era for Our Lady Peace, {{as it was the}} last album {{produced}} by the band's longtime producer Arnold Lanni, the last to feature original guitarist Mike Turner in full, and the last studio album to feature art model Saul Fox on its cover. It was also the last album to feature Maida's high-falsetto singing voice prominently. The album peaked at number five in Canada, where it is certified double platinum.|$|E

5|$|St Andrew's Castle {{was built}} to defend Southampton Water, {{a body of water}} which linked the Solent to the {{important}} port of Southampton. It was positioned by the shore, on what is now Hamble Common, to the south of the village of Hamble-le-Rice. It was located at one <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> old Iron Age ditch—the area had previously been occupied during this period, when a promontory hillfort, Hamble Common Camp, was built just along the coast. Construction took place between 1542 and 1543, but the fortification may not have been fully completed until after Henry's death in 1547.|$|E
5|$|The 1939–40 {{season was}} Bradman's most {{productive}} ever for SA: 1,448runs {{at an average}} of 144.8. He made three double centuries, including 251 not out against NSW, the innings that he rated the best he ever played in the Sheffield Shield, as he tamed Bill O'Reilly {{at the height of his}} form. However, it was the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> era. The outbreak of World War Two led to the indefinite postponement of all cricket tours, and the suspension of the Sheffield Shield competition.|$|E
5|$|The 1990 {{season and}} Super Bowl win marked the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> era for the Giants. Parcells had grown restless as {{coach of the}} Giants and yearned for {{complete}} control of the team. Knowing that he would not get that opportunity with George Young as GM, Parcells decided in the spring of 1991 to leave the Giants for a career in broadcasting.|$|E

5|$|The Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 {{appropriated}} {{funding for}} the Interstate Highway System, to construct a vast network of freeways across the country. By 1957, AASHO had decided to assign a new grid to the new routes, to be numbered in the opposite directions as the U.S. Highway grid. Though the Interstate numbers were to supplement, rather than replace, the U.S. Route numbers, in many cases (especially in the west) the US highways were rerouted along the new Interstates. Major decommissioning of former routes began with California's highway renumbering in 1964. The 1985 removal of US66 is often seen as the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> era of US highways.|$|E
5|$|The Tobruk {{garrison}} received {{supplies from}} the Royal Navy and Rommel {{was unable to}} take the port. This failure was significant; his front line positions at Sollum were at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> extended supply chain that stretched back to Tripoli and was threatened by the Tobruk garrison. The substantial commitment required to invest Tobruk prevented him from building up his forces at Sollum, making further advances into Egypt impractical. By maintaining possession of Tobruk, the Allies had regained the initiative.|$|E
5|$|The {{fall of the}} Lekapenoi signalled the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> era {{in terms}} of personalities, but Kourkouas's expansionist policy continued: he was succeeded as Domestic of the Schools by Bardas Phokas the Elder, {{followed}} by Nikephoros Phokas, who reigned as emperor in 963–969, and finally, by Kourkouas's own great-nephew, John Tzimiskes, who reigned as emperor in 969–976. All of them expanded the Byzantine frontier in the East, recovering Cilicia and northern Syria with Antioch, and converting the Hamdanid emirate of Aleppo into a Byzantine protectorate.|$|E
