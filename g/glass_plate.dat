5|$|One of the episode's scenes {{involves}} an infected woman {{jumping out of}} the building onto a van in an attempt to spread the virus further. To simulate her 160-feet fall, stuntwoman Angela Uyeda was placed in a crane 10 to 15 feet above the van and asked to jump onto the van below. The crew removed the roof structure on the van, and carefully rigged it to cave-in upon impact but also make it as painless as possible for Uyeda. To achieve this, they modified the ribs that supported the roof by placing them on pins that would snap, and also added a three-millimeter <b>glass</b> <b>plate</b> that would snap between two sheets of black hard nylon-type plastic to further emphasize the distance she jumped.|$|E
5|$|Albert A. Michelson and Edward W. Morley (1886) {{repeated}} Fizeau's {{experiment with}} improved accuracy, addressing several concerns with Fizeau's original experiment: (1) Deformation of the optical components in Fizeau's apparatus could cause artifactual fringe displacement; (2) observations were rushed, since the pressurized {{flow of water}} lasted only a short time; (3) the laminar flow profile of water flowing through Fizeau's small diameter tubes meant that only their central portions were available, resulting in faint fringes; (4) there were uncertainties in Fizeau's determination of flow rate across {{the diameter of the}} tubes. Michelson redesigned Fizeau's apparatus with larger diameter tubes and a large reservoir providing three minutes of steady water flow. His common path interferometer design provided automatic compensation of path length, so that white light fringes were visible at once as soon as the optical elements were aligned. Topologically, the light path was that of a Sagnac interferometer with an even number of reflections in each light path. This offered extremely stable fringes that were, to first order, completely insensitive to any movement of its optical components. The stability was such that it was possible for him to insert a <b>glass</b> <b>plate</b> at h or even to hold a lighted match in the light path without displacing the center of the fringe system. Using this apparatus, Michelson and Morley were able to completely confirm Fizeau's results.|$|E
25|$|The user {{interface}} {{consists of a}} <b>glass</b> <b>plate</b> covered in non-drying opaque black mastic, which constitutes a drawing surface upon which the user makes marks by scratching through the mastic, and therefore allowing light to pass through at that point. In front of the <b>glass</b> <b>plate</b> sits a vertical bank of twenty photocells that send signals to twenty amplifiers and bandpass filters, {{each with its own}} gain adjust control. It is akin to a ten-octave equalizer with two knobs per octave. The ANS is fully polyphonic and will generate all 720 pitches simultaneously if required (a vertical scratch would accomplish this).|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Glass {{plates and}} pseudo {{hexagonal}} prismatic ZSM- 5 crystals tethered with 3 -aminopropylsilyl (APS) groups, respectively, were prepared by treating them with 3 -aminopropyltriethoxysilane. Subsequent {{treatment of the}} APS-tethering <b>glass</b> <b>plates</b> with terephthaldi-carboxaldehyde led to facile assembly of benzaldehyde (BA) units over the <b>glass</b> <b>plates</b> via imine (–CHvN–) linkages. When the BA-tethering <b>glass</b> <b>plates</b> and the APS-tethering zeolite crystals were allowed to contact in boiling toluene, the ZSM- 5 crystals strongly adhered onto the <b>glass</b> <b>plates</b> {{in the form of}} closely packed monolayers with perfect one-dimensional orientation. q 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

25|$|His style {{combined}} {{traditional and}} modern motifs. Alonge took portraits outdoors {{with a large}} format, <b>glass</b> <b>plate</b> camera and a locally made studio backdrop. Using kerosene lanterns, he developed the <b>glass</b> <b>plate</b> negatives at night and contact printed the images on gaslight paper. Reading instruction booklets from Kodak and Ilford, he taught himself to mix his own chemicals and use sunlight to develop his prints. In 1940, Alonge began to retouch, sepia tone, and hand-color his photographs. When electricity came to Benin in 1945, {{he was able to}} take studio portraits and develop his photos indoors. Alonge's first camera was a Kodak Brownie; later, he used a Rolleiflex and other 35 mm cameras, and finally high-speed film.|$|E

25|$|On 8 July 1680, Hooke {{observed}} the nodal patterns {{associated with the}} modes of vibration of glass plates.

25|$|Some amateur {{telescope}} makers use {{a similar}} test called a Ronchi test that replaces the knife edge with a grating comprising several fine parallel wires or an etching on a <b>glass</b> <b>plate.</b> Other tests used include the Gaviola or Caustic test which can measure mirrors of fast f/ratio more accurately, and home-brew Interferometric testing made possible {{in recent years}} by affordable lasers, digital cameras (such as webcams), and computers.|$|E
25|$|Marbled and dappled {{patterns}}: Some {{of these}} patterns are clearly formed through the {{distortion of the}} original pattern during the slumping of the <b>glass</b> <b>plate</b> during melting. However, by using spiral and circular patterns of alternating colours producers were also able to deliberately imitate the appearance of natural stones such as sardonyx. This occurs most often on pillar-moulded bowls, which {{are one of the}} commonest glass finds on 1st century sites.|$|E

25|$|The <b>glass</b> <b>plate</b> {{can then}} be scanned left or {{right in front of}} the {{photocell}} bank in order to transcribe the drawing directly into pitches. In other words, it plays what one has drawn, similar to how a score is written. This process can be aided with a gear-motor drive (similar to an engineering lathe) or it can be moved manually. The scan speed is adjustable down to zero. The speed at which the score scans has no relation to pitch but serves only as a means of controlling duration.|$|E
25|$|A more {{successful}} series of calculators using a reflective DSM-LCD {{was launched in}} 1972 by Sharp Inc with the Sharp EL-805, which was a slim pocket calculator. This, and another few similar models, used Sharp's Calculator On Substrate (COS) technology. An extension of one <b>glass</b> <b>plate</b> needed for the liquid crystal display {{was used as a}} substrate to mount the needed chips based on a new hybrid technology. The COS technology may have been too costly since it was only used in a few models before Sharp reverted to conventional circuit boards.|$|E

25|$|The Library of Congress {{acquired}} {{these images}} as copyright deposits from about 1900 through 1930. The dates on them are dates of registration, not the dates when the photographs were taken. About two-thirds (1,608) {{of these images}} were not published in The North American Indian and therefore offer a different glimpse into Curtis's work with indigenous cultures. The original <b>glass</b> <b>plate</b> negatives, which had been stored and nearly forgotten {{in the basement of}} the Morgan Library, in New York, were dispersed during World War II.

25|$|Planar {{chromatography}} is {{a separation}} technique {{in which the}} stationary phase is present as or on a plane. The plane can be a paper, serving as such or impregnated by a substance as the stationary bed (paper chromatography) or a layer of solid particles spread on a support such as a <b>glass</b> <b>plate</b> (thin layer chromatography). Different compounds in the sample mixture travel different distances according to how strongly they interact with the stationary phase {{as compared to the}} mobile phase. The specific Retention factor (Rf) of each chemical can be used to aid in the identification of an unknown substance.|$|E
25|$|Glass {{plates were}} the medium for most {{original}} camera photography {{from the late}} 1850s until the general introduction of flexible plastic films during the 1890s. Although the convenience of the film greatly popularized amateur photography, early films were somewhat more expensive and of markedly lower optical quality than their <b>glass</b> <b>plate</b> equivalents, and until the late 1910s they were not available in the large formats preferred by most professional photographers, so the new medium did not immediately or completely replace the old. Because of the superior dimensional stability of glass, the use of plates for some scientific applications, such as astrophotography, continued into the 1990s, and in the niche field of laser holography, it has persisted into the 2010s.|$|E
