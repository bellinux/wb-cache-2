[...] Residual syndrome is a non-life-threatening disease which is displayed as toxic effects causing many of the same signs and symptoms that uremia displays. There are several hypotheses why residual syndrome is present. They are: (1) the accumulation of large molecular weight solutes that are poorly dialyzed (e.g. β2-Microglobulin), (2) the accumulation of protein-bound small molecular weight solutes that are poorly dialyzed (e.g. ρ-cresol sulfate and <b>indoxyl</b> sulfate), (3) accumulation of dialyzable solutes that are incompletely removed (e.g. sequestered solutes like phosphate in cells or insufficient elimination of other more toxic solutes), (4) indirect phenomena such as carbamylation of proteins, tissue calcification, or a toxic effect of hormone imbalance (e.g. Parathyroid hormone) and (5) the toxic effect by dialysis itself (e.g. removal of unknown important vitamins or minerals). Dialysis increases life span but patients may have more limited function. They gain physical limitations which include impairment of balance, walking speed and sensory functions. They also retain cognitive impairment such as impairment in attention, memory and performance of higher-order tasks. Patients have been maintained longer than three decades on dialysis, but unfortunately average mortality rates and hospitalizations are high. Also patient rehabilitation and quality of life is poor.|$|E
