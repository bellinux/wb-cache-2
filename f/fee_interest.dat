The sharing {{of the value of}} the residual claim between the owner of the leased fee and the leasehold and a lease extension clause triggered by redevelopment can enhance the value of the asset to both parties. The results suggest that employing such contractual terms in ground leases in the United States would lead to outcomes more consistent with the fee simple case.

The land was given to Bethlehem Steel Corporation, primarily to build and repair ships. After the owners of property in the condemned area were compensated, the District Court in the District of Maryland convened to determine what compensation if any the Mayor and City of Baltimore were entitled to for the alleys that were condemned. The Court granted the Mayor and City of Baltimore only nominal damages as just compensation for the alleys. The Court reasoned that the condemnation of the land to which the alleys abutted, removed any use of the alleys and thus, {{there was no need to}} replace the alleys. The Court also found that since the City held the land in the alleys in trust for the benefit of the public, its interest in the alleys were beneficial use interest. To receive just compensation however for condemnation, the City had to have a <b>fee</b> <b>interest.</b> The Mayor and City of Baltimore appealed to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.

40|$|In Florida, the {{ad valorem}} {{property}} tax {{is the single}} most important source of revenue for local governments. Considerable revenue is lost to local governments when property that should be taxed is not taxed because of mistaken application of the governmental immunity doctrine. Most governmentally owned property is used by the governmental entity for governmental purposes and remains nontaxable. However, when governmentally owned property is used by a nongovernmental person for a nonexempt use, the property no longer enjoys governmental immunity and is taxable. After all, such property is being used for private, profit-seeking purposes in competition with nongovernmentally owned property being used for similar purposes; the privately owned property is taxable, and so too is the governmentally owned property. It is a matter of compelling public interest that Florida 2 ̆ 7 s tax system is applied in a fair, evenhanded manner [...] that similarly situated taxpayers be taxed in the same manner. When property is being used for private, nonexempt purposes, it should be subject to ad valorem taxation, regardless of who owns the underlying <b>fee</b> <b>interest</b> in the property. Part II of this article briefly discusses the governmental immunity doctrine and the circumstances under which it has been waived. Part III explores the waiver of immunity from ad valorem taxation in Florida when governmentally owned property is used by a nongovernmental entity for a nonexempt use. Part IV discusses the role that the state and local governments play in Florida in the imposition and collection of sales tax.

40|$|Federal tax law {{has long}} {{provided}} a tax benefit for charitable contributions of easements for conservation purposes. A fundamental {{problem with this}} conservation easement tax expenditure is that the measure for the tax benefit – lost economic development value – is erroneous. Use of such an erroneous measure obscures the conservation benefits of the program by focusing attention and resources on divining a largely extraneous and unhelpful number. Further, to a considerable extent, the easement program is reflexively justified and understood based on this false measure, as if it represented the conservation value of the program. The Article argues that, in theory, the measure for the tax benefit should be changed to one that better approximates conservation value. This would help ensure that the program is efficient, {{in the sense that}} conservation benefits would exceed program costs. However, the theory must account for the fact that conservation value is not, at least not yet, readily susceptible to quantification for tax purposes. Accordingly, the Article also argues that a second-best approach would be to change the measure of the tax benefit to a more objective number – the fair market value of the underlying <b>fee</b> <b>interest</b> – not only to provide greater certainty but more importantly to shift administrative and legal resources and attention to where it should be: on the conservation benefits of the program. Finally, the Article argues that serious consideration should be given to converting the deduction to a credit, both to make the tax benefit more equitable and also to provide greater flexibility, by more easily allowing for different levels of tax benefit to be provided based on satisfaction of conservation criteria, which could and should evolve over time to account for society’s changing needs. In any event, irrespective of the details, the conservation easement tax expenditure should be designed to promote a concept of conservation value – an affirmative value – that represents the best use of the land. The value of the tax expenditure should no longer be defined by what is lost, but rather by what is gained...|$|E
