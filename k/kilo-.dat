5|$|Prefixes {{are added}} to unit names to produce {{multiple}} and sub-multiples of the original unit. All multiples are integer powers of ten, and above a hundred or below a hundredth all are integer powers of a thousand. For example, <b>kilo-</b> denotes a multiple of a thousand and milli- denotes a multiple of a thousandth, so there are one thousand millimetres to the metre and one thousand metres to the kilometre. The prefixes are never combined, so for example a millionth of a metre is a micrometre, not a millimillimetre. Multiples of the kilogram are named as if the gram were the base unit, so a millionth of a kilogram is a milligram, not a microkilogram.|$|E
25|$|The {{metric system}} has names to cover {{different}} ranges {{of the same}} measure. Instead of using names based on {{the context of the}} measure, the metric system mainly uses names made by adding prefixes, such as <b>kilo-</b> or milli-, as decimal multipliers to the base unit names. Thus, one kilogram is 1000grams and one kilometre is 1000metres.|$|E

5000|$|The SI prefix for a {{thousand}} is <b>kilo-,</b> officially abbreviated as k—for instance, prefixed to [...] "metre" [...] or its abbreviation m, kilometre or km signifies {{a thousand}} metres. As such, people occasionally represent numbers in a non-standard notation by replacing the last three zeros of the general numeral with [...] "K": for instance, 30K for 30,000.|$|E
50|$|Each prefix {{name has}} a symbol {{that is used}} in {{combination}} with the symbols for units of measure. For example, the symbol for <b>kilo-</b> is 'k', and is used to produce 'km', 'kg', and 'kW', which are the SI symbols for kilometre, kilogram, and kilowatt, respectively. Where Greek letters are unavailable, the symbol for micro 'µ' is commonly replaced by 'u'.|$|E

50|$|In {{computer}} science, the SI prefixes <b>kilo-,</b> mega- and giga- were historically used {{in certain}} contexts to mean either {{the first three}} powers of 1024 (1024, 10242 and 10243) contrary to the metric system in which these units unambiguously mean one thousand, one million, and one billion.

5000|$|The table {{below is}} based on the {{kilogram}} (kg), the base unit of mass in the International System of Units (SI). The kilogram is the only standard unit to include an SI prefix (<b>kilo-)</b> as part of its name. The gram (10−3 kg) is an SI derived unit of mass. However, the names of all SI mass units are based on gram, rather than on kilogram; thus 103 kg is a megagram (106 g), not a [...] "kilokilogram".|$|E

5000|$|The use of {{customary}} U.S. units {{can sometimes}} be awkward and the metric system makes these conversions simpler. In the metric system, {{there are only a}} small number of basic measures of relevance to cooking: the gram (g) for weight, the liter (L) for volume, the meter (m) for length, and degrees Celsius (°C) for temperature; multiples and sub-multiples are indicated by prefixes, two commonly used metric cooking prefixes are milli- (m-) and <b>kilo-</b> (k-). [...] Intra-metric conversions involve moving the decimal point.|$|E
5000|$|The {{kilometre}} (International spelling as {{used by the}} International Bureau of Weights and Measures; SI symbol: km; [...] or [...] ) or kilometer (American spelling) is a unit {{of length}} in the metric system, equal to one thousand metres (<b>kilo-</b> being the SI prefix for [...] ). It is now the measurement unit used officially for expressing distances between geographical places on land {{in most of the}} world; notable exceptions are the United States and the road network of the United Kingdom where the statute mile is the official unit used.|$|E
5000|$|The {{electronvolt}} {{is not a}} SI unit, and {{its definition}} is empirical (unlike the litre, the light-year and other such non-SI units), thus its value in SI units must be obtained experimentally. [...] Like the elementary charge on which it is based, {{it is not an}} independent quantity but is equal to 1  . It is a common unit of energy within physics, widely used in solid state, atomic, nuclear, and particle physics. It is commonly used with the metric prefixes milli-, <b>kilo-,</b> mega-, giga-, tera-, peta- or exa- (meV, keV, MeV, GeV, TeV, PeV and EeV respectively). Thus meV stands for milli-electronvolt.|$|E
50|$|A metric prefix is a unit prefix that precedes a {{basic unit}} of measure to {{indicate}} a multiple or fraction of the unit. While all metric prefixes in common use today are decadic, historically {{there have been a}} number of binary metric prefixes as well. Each prefix has a unique symbol that is prepended to the unit symbol. The prefix <b>kilo-,</b> for example, may be added to gram to indicate multiplication by one thousand: one kilogram is equal to one thousand grams. The prefix milli-, likewise, may be added to metre to indicate division by one thousand; one millimetre is equal to one thousandth of a metre.|$|E

Multiples of the kilogram are named as if the gram were the base unit, so a millionth of a kilogram is a milligram, not a microkilogram.|$|E
50|$|The unit symbol kb (lowercase 'b') is typographically {{similar to}} the {{international}} standard unit symbol for the kilobyte, i.e. kB (upper case 'B'). The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) recommends the symbol bit instead of b. The prefix <b>kilo-</b> is often used in fields of computer science and information technology with a meaning of multiplication by 1024 instead of 1000, contrary to international standards, {{in conjunction with the}} base unit byte and bit, in which case it is to be written as Ki-, with a capital letter K, e.g., 1 Kibit = 1024 bits. The decimal SI definition, 1 kbit/s = 1000 bit/s, is used uniformly in the context of telecommunication transmission speeds.|$|E
5000|$|The {{megabyte}} {{is commonly}} used to measure either 10002 bytes or 10242 bytes. The interpretation of using base 1024 originated as a compromise technical jargon for the byte multiples {{that needed to be}} expressed by the powers of 2 but lacked a convenient name. As 1024 (210) approximates 1000 (103), roughly corresponding to the SI prefix <b>kilo-,</b> it was a convenient term to denote the binary multiple. In 1998 the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) proposed standards for binary prefixes requiring the use of megabyte to strictly denote 10002 bytes and mebibyte to denote 10242 bytes. By the end of 2009, the IEC Standard had been adopted by the IEEE, EU, ISO and NIST. Nevertheless, the term megabyte continues to be widely used with different meanings: ...|$|E

50|$|Remembering that in PFM an AC bias of {{a certain}} {{frequency}} causes a deformation of the sample material at that same frequency the system {{can be considered as}} a driven harmonic oscillator. As such there exists a resonance as a function of driving frequency. This effect has been exploited in PFM to provide an enhancement in the PR signal, thus allowing for a higher signal-to-noise or similar signal-to-noise at lower driving bias amplitude. Typically this contact resonance is in the <b>kilo-</b> to mega-hertz range which is several times higher in frequency than the first free harmonic in air of the cantilever used. However a drawback is that the contact resonance is dependent not only on the dynamic response of the cantilever but also on the elastic modulus of the sample material immediately in contact with the probe tip and so therefore can change during scanning over different areas. This leads to a change in the measured PR amplitude and so is undesirable. One method of bypassing the inherent disadvantages of contact resonance PFM is to change the driving frequency in order to shadow or track the changes in the frequency of the contact resonance. This feature as developed by Asylum Research called Dual AC™ Resonance Tracking (DART) uses two limit frequencies {{on either side of the}} contact resonance peak and so can sense changes in the peak position. It is then possible to adapt the AC bias driving frequency correspondingly in order to maintain the signal boost that results from the contact resonance.|$|E
