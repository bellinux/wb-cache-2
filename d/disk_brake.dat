40|$|Abstract. In recent years, {{the bicycle}} {{has become an}} {{environmentally}} friendly transportation. The bicycle {{can be divided into}} mountain bicycle and highway bicycle. Safe driving is the prior consideration. The bicycle braking system can be divided into oil pressure <b>disk</b> <b>brakes</b> and mechanical <b>disk</b> <b>brakes.</b> The <b>brake</b> <b>disk</b> system is one indispensable component of the safe system. In accordance to overall weight consideration of the bike, the <b>brake</b> <b>disk</b> should also focus on the lightweight design. This paper discussed an innovative <b>brake</b> <b>disk</b> forming technology for 6061 aluminum alloy by the rigid-plastic finite element analysis. The simulation parameters include geometric shapes of the <b>brake</b> <b>disk</b> and mold, die temperature, and friction factors. The stress and strain in forming, brake deformation and vibration modal analysis of <b>brake</b> <b>disk</b> in riding were studied. The paper is expected to offer some precision bicycle <b>brake</b> <b>disk</b> manufacture knowledge for industry. 1...|$|R
