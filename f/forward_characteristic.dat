40|$|Although various {{silicon carbide}} (SiC) power devices with very high {{blocking}} voltages over 10 kV have been demonstrated, basic {{issues associated with}} the device operation are still not well understood. In this paper, the promise and limitations of high-voltage SiC bipolar devices are presented, taking account of the injection-level dependence of carrier lifetimes. It is shown that the major limitation of SiC bipolar devices originates from band-to-band recombination, which becomes significant at a high-injection level.

40|$|This note proves {{an upper}} {{bound for the}} {{fluctuations}} of a second-class particle in the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process. The proof needs a lower tail estimate for the last-passage growth model associated with the exclusion process. A stronger estimate has been proved for the corresponding discrete time model, so we take the needed estimate as a hypothesis. The process is initially in local equilibrium with a slowly varying macroscopic profile. The macroscopic initial profile is smooth in a neighborhood of the origin where the second-class particle starts off, and the <b>forward</b> <b>characteristic</b> from the origin is not a shock. Given these assumptions, {{the result is that}} the typical fluctuation of the second-class particle is not of larger order than n^{ 2 / 3 }(log n) ^{ 1 / 3 }, where n is the ratio of the macroscopic and microscopic space scales. The conjectured correct order should be n^{ 2 / 3 }. Landim et al. have proved a lower bound of order n^{ 5 / 8 } for more general asymmetric exclusion processes in equilibrium. Fluctuations in the case of shocks and rarefaction fans are covered by earlier results of Ferrari-Fontes and Ferrari-Kipnis. Comment: 15 page...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} new class of {{particle}} methods with deformable shapes that converge in the uniform norm without requiring remappings, extended overlapping or vanishing moments for the particles. The crux of the method is to use polynomial expansions of the backward characteristic flow to transport the numerical particles with improved accuracy: in the first order case the method consists of representing the transported density with linearly-transformed particles, the second order version computes quadratically-transformed particles, and so on. For programming purposes we provide explicit implementations of the resulting LTP and QTP schemes that only involve pointwise evaluations of the <b>forward</b> <b>characteristic</b> flow, and also come with local indicators for the accuracy of the corresponding transport scheme. Numerical tests using different transport problems demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed methods compared to standard particle schemes, and establish their robustness with respect to the remapping period. In particular, it is shown that QTP particles can be transported without remappings on very long periods of times, without hampering the accuracy of the numerical solutions. Finally, a dynamic criterion is proposed to automatically select the time steps where the particles should be remapped. The strategy does not require additional inter-particle communications, and it is validated by numerical experiments. Comment: This version is an important revision of the previous one...|$|E
