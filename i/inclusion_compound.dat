A deviation from the linear molecular geometry, for example, by C=C-double bonds in the molecule, leads to a less stable <b>inclusion</b> <b>compound.</b> Thus stearic acid (C18: 0) forms more stable urea adducts compared to oleic acid (C18: 1 cis -9) or linoleic acid (C18: 2 cis -9, cis -12). A branching in the fatty acid molecule or an autoxidation result in a large deviation from the straight-chain molecular structure, so that these compounds do not form urea adducts.
