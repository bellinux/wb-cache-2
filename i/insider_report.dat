According to a recent Business <b>Insider</b> <b>Report</b> article, Ken Koedinger, a professor of human-computer interaction and psychology at Carnegie Mellon University, says teachers can integrate cognitive tutoring software into the classroom. [...] He suggests that teachers {{use it in a}} computer lab environment or during classes. In its more current versions, cognitive tutors can understand the many ways that a student might answer a problem, and then assist the student at the exact time that the help is required. Further, the cognitive tutor can customize exercises specific to the student's needs.|$|E
5000|$|The Independent Press Standards Organisation {{received}} over 1,000 {{complaints about}} the piece, claiming it violated numerous Codes of Conduct including inaccuracy, harassment and discrimination. A Business <b>Insider</b> <b>report</b> strongly criticised the Daily Mail story as being [...] "distorted" [...] and {{could be construed as}} an attempt to harm the reputation and safety of the judges. In November 2016, the Bishop of Leeds, Nick Baines said the public should be [...] "very alarmed" [...] over the Daily Mail piece.

A week later, Zarinah Abdul Majid, the Muslim woman, and MAIS, the head body of Jais, produced a statement that refuted The Malaysian <b>Insider</b> <b>report</b> and accused it of sensationalising the news and producing disharmony among the communities. Zarinah said that Jais had in fact done the investigation in a proper manner with respect for her, her family and her guest.|$|E
40|$|In April 2010, {{new rules}} {{governing}} {{the reporting of}} securities trades by <b>insiders</b> of <b>reporting</b> issuers came into effect in Canada. These new rules were embodied in National Instrument 55 - 104, and in contemporaneous harmonized changes to Ontario’s Securities Act. Under the new regime, the deadline for filing <b>insider</b> <b>reports</b> has been shortened, from ten calendar days to five calendar days following a purchase or sale. When a draft of National Instrument 55 - 104 was first published for comment, the Canadian Securities Administrators linked this proposed timing change, among other things, {{to the practice of}} improper stock options backdating. The suggestion that <b>insider</b> <b>reporting</b> obligations might deter the practice of options backdating is intriguing. <b>Insider</b> <b>reporting</b> rules have historically been regarded primarily as a regulatory tool to detect or prevent the improper use of inside information by <b>insiders</b> of <b>reporting</b> issuers. For these requirements to perform an effective secondary role in combating improper options backdating, clear rules on the timing of reporting obligations and rigorous enforcement would be required. It is not clear that the administration and enforcement of current Canadian <b>insider</b> <b>reporting</b> rules, crafted with very different objectives in mind, provide an effective deterrent to improper options backdating. A review of the current rules and the mechanisms for their enforcement, together with a comparison with <b>insider</b> <b>reporting</b> regimes in other selected jurisdictions, reveals weaknesses in the Canadian approach and suggests ways in which the Canadian regime could be enhanced to deter or detect options backdating. ...|$|R

5000|$|Scott's Cheap Flights {{was created}} by Scott Keyes in late 2013 as a {{personal}} hobby to alert his friends when cheap fares arose. It gained prominence in 2015 thanks to a Business <b>Insider</b> <b>report</b> in 2015, which lead to his email newsletter going from 300 subscribers to 3000. After the increase in subscribers, Keyes transformed the email list from a hobby to a business. This service launched on August 23, 2015, and after three months, he had generated in excess of $6000. He would later earn a total of $24,376 from 1,687. As of November 2016, Scott had earned $963,234.48 and had 233,660 subscribers (of which 29,639 of them are paid).

40|$|This essay {{examines}} the aesthetics and rhetoric through which popular science delivers {{the message of}} brain-mind conflation—‘You are your brain’. Noting the entwinement of realist and imaginary visual tropes in popular scientific presentations of brain imaging, author seeks a correlative ‘counter-text’ to this discourse {{in one of the}} classic texts in psychiatric history, the memoirs of the paranoid nineteenth-century judge, Daniel Paul Schreber. In this juxtaposition of contemporary neuroscience and a century-old <b>insider</b> <b>report</b> from madness, the author sees two opposite fantasies about the biologization of the mind. In the end, Schreber’s is deemed the most ‘realist’, since his delusions highlight precisely the blind spots of popular neuroscience today, especially the eclipse of societal, collective meaning in strictly biologistic explanations of the mind...|$|E
40|$|Since BOBCATSSS-Symposia {{usually have}} an open minded atmosphere, they present a very good {{opportunity}} for an open and undogmatic discussion about the challenges of librarianship and information science.
