25|$|Evidence of Neolithic {{settlement}} can {{be found}} throughout the county. There are great burial mounds including the portal tombs and dolmens at Owning, Kilmogue-Harristown and Borrismore. There are passage graves at Clomantagh Hill and Knockroe. There were non-megalith single-grave burial tombs, Linkardstown-type Cists, excavated at Jerpoint West. These are late Neolithic and before the single-grave rite of the Bronze Age. A Neolithic house was identified in Granny near Waterford, making it the oldest house in County Kilkenny. The square house consisted of slot-trenches, internal <b>floor</b> <b>surfaces,</b> a hearth and wooden posts at each corner, one of the post-holes was radiocarbon-dated to 3997-3728 BC. A new form of early Neolithic pottery with a lip around {{the inside of the}} rim were found. This Granny pottery is similar to pottery found in the south-east of England.|$|E

40|$|When {{applying}} the radiant floor cooling system, {{it is important}} to prevent condensation on the <b>floor</b> <b>surface.</b> To solve this problem, a radiant floor cooling system integrated with the dehumidification system has been proposed and evaluated. In doing so, the relationship between the control variables in preventing <b>floor</b> <b>surface</b> condensation is first analyzed, and the control methods are evaluated through simulations. After analyzing the control stabilities of room air temperature, condensation control of the <b>floor</b> <b>surface,</b> and the operation time of PAC with the simulation results, the control method is determined and tested through model experiments. Through these experiments, the applicability of the radiant floor cooling system integrated with dehumidification system is confirmed after analysis of stability in room air temperature and changes in the condensation control variables for varying internal loads...|$|R

5000|$|A floor {{burnisher}} {{is a type}} {{of high-speed}} rotary floor machine that has a horizontally rotating head which attaches to a large, round burnishing pad which spins in a circle in one direction. The pad of a floor burnisher rotates between 1500-3000 RPM and will produce a [...] "wet-look" [...] shine on hard <b>floor</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The three main types of floor burnishers are electric, battery-powered and propane.|$|E
30|$|The comfort {{requirements}} of the <b>floor</b> <b>surface</b> temperature also have to be satisfied, because when the existing radiant floor heating panel is used for cooling, the <b>floor</b> <b>surface</b> used as the radiant cooling panel is {{in direct contact with}} the human body. Some studies and standards (Handbook American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers 2009; Olesen 2008; Standard American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air Conditioning Engineers 2004; International Organization for Standardization 2012; Babiak et al. 2009; International Organization for Standardization 2005; Zhang et al. 2001) suggest the lower limit for an acceptable <b>floor</b> <b>surface</b> temperature to be around 17 – 21  °C. The REHVA guidebook (Babiak et al. 2009) provides an acceptable minimum surface temperature (19  °C) as well as a method of calculating the cooling capacity for each panel type. The cooling capacity of a Radiant Floor Panel (RFP) calculated based on this method may be insufficient for space cooling when considering the simulation result for cooling load in the above research (Jeong et al. 2007), the acceptable minimum <b>floor</b> <b>surface</b> temperature, and the effective installation area of the RFP. Thus, it can be inferred that supplementary cooling equipment is required in addition to the RFP.|$|R

50|$|The {{footings}} and <b>floor</b> <b>surfaces</b> of {{the homestead}} were unearthed during archaeological test excavations in June 2000.

50|$|The {{theory of}} revolt {{is the most}} widely accepted.

30|$|Difference in the ‘baking’ {{temperatures}} {{between the}} <b>floor</b> <b>surface</b> samples and the − 20 -cm level samples would probably also cause {{the differences in}} the rock magnetic characters.

From the view of the rock magnetic properties, the <b>floor</b> <b>surface</b> samples seem to be much more preferable for high-fidelity archeointensity researches.|$|R
40|$|Whether {{going from}} a {{sidewalk}} to grass or going from a tiled kitchen floor to a carpeted living room floor, people are constantly encountering {{changes in the}} surfaces they walk on. Most people do not consciously attend to these changes in <b>floor</b> <b>surface</b> or to the changes they may make in their gait pattern before, during, or after a surface change. There have been numerous studies on normal gait and on changes in gait while stepping over obstacles, however, no research as been done to discover if there are changes in gait that occur prior {{to a change in}} <b>floor</b> <b>surface.</b> The {{purpose of this study was}} to gather normal data of anticipatory changes in gait that occur prior to a change in <b>floor</b> <b>surface.</b> By knowing what changes do occur in preparation for a change in <b>floor</b> <b>surface,</b> future studies can look at groups of individuals with abnormal gait to determine if the appropriate anticipatory changes are occurring. Forty-six subjects between the ages of 21 and 34 years were recruited from the Pacific University campus. Each subject walked barefoot at their normal, comfortable pace a minimum of two trials; one trial on a single surface condition and one trial on a changing surface. For each condition, 4 gait parameters were collected from the last full stride using a gait-evaluation mat. The single surface values were compared to the change in surface values for each subject. A statistically significant increase (p =. 0007) in stride velocity was found in the change in surface condition (mean = 138. 135 em/sec) compared to the single surface condition (mean = 132. 732 em/sec). There were no significant differences between single surface and change in surface conditions prior to a change in <b>floor</b> <b>surface</b> with stride length, step length (last step and second to last step), or step width. The results of our study suggest that velocity is the only one of the gait parameters examined that requires more variability in anticipation to a change in <b>floor</b> <b>surface</b> from solid to carpet...|$|R
30|$|Further, when {{a radiant}} floor cooling system (RFCS) is adopted for a {{residential}} building, the <b>floor</b> <b>surface</b> temperature comfort requirement must be satisfied, because {{the human body}} is in direct contact with the radiant floor cooling panel. This issue is of particular importance in countries with a sedentary or barefoot lifestyle, such as Korea. In Korea, where radiant floor heating has been used for a long time, it is an even more important issue, because Koreans are conventionally familiar with a warm <b>floor</b> <b>surface</b> temperature.|$|R
