5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s the {{government}} reined in inflation {{by making the}} peso equal in value to the U.S. dollar, and privatised numerous state-run companies, using part of the proceeds to reduce the national debt. However, a sustained recession {{at the turn of}} the 21st century culminated in a default, and the government again devalued the peso. By 2005 the economy had recovered, but a <b>judicial</b> <b>ruling</b> originating from the previous crisis led to a new default in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Mary's Club is {{the oldest}} strip club in Portland, Oregon, in the United States. In 1954 Roy Keller bought the {{business}} from Mary Duerst Hemming, who owned and operated Mary's as a piano bar beginning in the 1930s. Keller initially hired go-go dancers as entertainment during the piano player's breaks, later hiring them full-time because of their popularity. Topless dancers wearing pasties were introduced in 1955. The club also featured comics, musicians, singers and other acts. All-nude dancing began in 1985, after a <b>judicial</b> <b>ruling</b> against City of Portland ordinances banning it in venues which served alcohol.|$|E
5|$|Another related {{investigation}} {{involved the}} fate of the children of captured pregnant guerrillas, who were given up for adoption by the military junta. An estimated 500 children were involved. The investigation became controversial during the Kirchner administration, as those involved had become adults and some of them refused to participate in DNA testing. One of those cases was the Noble siblings case, involving the adopted sons of Ernestina Herrera de Noble, owner of the Clarín newspaper. The Kirchners advanced a bill in Congress to make the genetic testing of suspected victims mandatory. Although the measure had popular support, critics considered it a breach of the right to privacy, and politically motivated because of a dispute between Kirchner and the Clarín newspaper. The Noble siblings tests in 2011 were negative, and the case was closed in January 2016, after Kirchner left the presidency. Hilario Bacca, a confirmed son of disappeared guerrillas, appealed a <b>judicial</b> <b>ruling</b> that sought to change his name, asking to keep the name he had been using.|$|E

40|$|Are <b>judicial</b> <b>rulings</b> {{based solely}} on laws and facts? Legal {{formalism}} holds that judges apply legal reasons to the facts of a case in a rational, mechanical, and deliberative manner. In contrast, legal realists argue that the rational application of legal reasons does not sufficiently explain the decisions of judges and that psychological, political, and social factors influence <b>judicial</b> <b>rulings.</b> We test the common caricature of realism that justice is “what the judge ate for breakfast” in sequential parole decisions made by experienced judges. We record the judges’ two daily food breaks, which result in segmenting the deliberations of the day into three distinct “decision sessions. ” We find {{that the percentage of}} favorable rulings drops gradually from ≈ 65 % to nearly zero within each decision session and returns abruptly to ≈ 65 % after a break.

25|$|Although {{individual}} U.S. {{states have}} the primary regulatory power {{with regard to}} marriage, the United States Congress has occasionally regulated marriage. The 1862 Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act, which made bigamy a punishable federal offense in U.S. territories, {{was followed by a}} series of federal laws designed to end the practice of polygamy. In 1996 as a reaction to a state level <b>judicial</b> <b>ruling</b> prohibiting same-sex couples from marrying that may violate Hawaii's constitutional equal protection clause (Baehr v. Miike, 80 Hawai`i 341), Congress passed the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), section 3 of which defined marriage as a legal union of one man and one woman for the purpose of interpreting federal law. Under DOMA section 3, the federal government did not recognize same-sex marriages, even if those unions were recognized by state law. For example, members of a same-sex couple legally married in Massachusetts could not file joint federal income tax returns even if they filed joint state income tax returns. DOMA section 3 was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court in United States v. Windsor on June 26, 2013.|$|E
500|$|Hand {{has been}} {{called one of the}} United States' most {{significant}} judicial philosophers. A leading advocate of judicial restraint, he took seriously Alexander Hamilton's formulation that [...] "the judiciary ...may truly be said to have neither force nor will, but merely judgement." [...] Any <b>judicial</b> <b>ruling</b> that had the effect of legislating from the bench troubled Hand. In 1908, in his article [...] "Due Process of Law and the Eight-Hour Day", he attacked the 1905 Supreme Court ruling in Lochner v. New York, which had struck down a law prohibiting bakery staff from working more than ten hours a day. The Supreme Court went on to strike down a series of similar worker-protective laws {{on the grounds that they}} restricted freedom of contract. Hand regarded this principle as undemocratic. [...] "For the state to intervene", he argued, [...] "to make more just and equal the relative strategic advantages of the two parties to the contract, of whom one is under the pressure of absolute want, while the other is not, is as proper a legislative function as that it should neutralize the relative advantages arising from fraudulent cunning or from superior force." ...|$|E

2500|$|Likewise {{with the}} Executive Department, Edwin Corwin {{observed}} that the Court does sometimes rebuff presidential pretensions, but it more often tries to rationalize them.

The [...] "political question" [...] doctrine especially applies to questions which present a difficult enforcement issue.
