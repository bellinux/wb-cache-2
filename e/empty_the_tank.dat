40|$|A {{system for}} continuous, rapid {{deaeration}} of hydraulic oil {{has been built}} to replace a prior system that effected deaeration more slowly in a cyclic pressure/ vacuum process. Such systems are needed because (1) hydraulic oil has an affinity for air, typically containing between 10 and 15 volume percent of air and (2) in the original application for which these systems were built, there is a requirement to keep the proportion of dissolved air below 1 volume percent because a greater proportion can lead to pump cavitation and excessive softness in hydraulic-actuator force-versus-displacement characteristics. In addition to overcoming several deficiencies of the prior deaeration system, the present system removes water from the oil. The system (see figure) includes a pump that continuously circulates oil {{at a rate of}} 10 gal/min (38 L/min) between an 80 -gal (303 -L) airless reservoir and a tank containing a vacuum. When the circulation pump is started, oil is pumped, at a pressure of 120 psi (827 kPa), through a venturi tube below the tank with a connection to a stand-pipe in the tank. This action draws oil out of the tank via the standpipe. At the same time, oil is sprayed into the tank in a fine mist, thereby exposing a large amount of oil to the vacuum. When the oil level in the tank falls below the lower of two level switches, a vacuum pump is started, drawing a hard vacuum on the tank through a trap that collects any oil and water entrained in the airflow. When the oil level rises above higher of the two level switches or when the system is shut down, a solenoid valve between the tank and the vacuum pump is closed to prevent suction of oil into the vacuum pump. Critical requirements that the system is designed to satisfy include the following: 1) The circulation pump must have sufficient volume and pressure to operate the venturi tube and spray nozzles. 2) The venturi tube must be sized to <b>empty</b> <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> (except for the oil retained by the standpipe) and maintain a vacuum against the vacuum pump. 3) The tank must be strong enough to withstand atmospheric pressure against the vacuum inside and must have sufficient volume to enable exposure of a sufficiently large amount of sprayed oil to the vacuum. 4) The spray nozzles must be sized to atomize the oil and to ensure that the rate of flow of sprayed oil does not exceed {{the rate at which the}} venturi action can <b>empty</b> <b>the</b> <b>tank.</b> 5) The vacuum pump must produce a hard vacuum against the venturi tube and continue to work when it ingests some oil and water. 6) Fittings must be made vacuum tight (by use of O-rings) to prevent leakage of air into the system. The system is fully automatic, and can be allowed to remain in operation with very little monitoring. It is capable of reducing the air content of the oil from 11 to less than 1 volume percent in about 4 hours and to keep the water content below 100 parts per million...|$|E
40|$|WINICE is {{a project}} carried out by {{researchers}} at Aalto University and Lappeenranta University. The project aims at investigating wasterwater purification through formation of thin ice layers by natural freezing in regions with cold climate, such that the process is more energy efficient than existing common purification methods. The scope of the project includes purification of wasterwater through formation of thin pure ice sheet in a tank, cutting of the ice sheet into ice pieces, removal of the ice pieces and their transport for further processing. This thesis focuses on a method for collection of the ice pieces after they are cut into pieces. For the collection process, a floodgate located centrally along {{the width of the}} tank is opened to generate an outward flow of water, which causes the ice piece to move along with the water. The ice piece is separated and the water is then is pumped back into the tank for refreezing. The scope of this thesis is studying the feasibility of the removal process, effects of reducing ice sheet length on the time taken to extract the ice piece (reach time) and analysis of reach time as a function of ice piece’s initial from the floodgate. The simulation of the ice piece motion is divided in two parts: simulation of water flow under the influence of ice sheet of fixed length, and simulation of a rectangular ice piece motion using the imported water flow field. The ice piece motion simulation is done for several initial positions using flow fields corresponding to different ice sheet lengths. However, the final simulation flow field from an interpolated case of several cases is needed to account for several distortions in the reach time contours. It is found that the floodgate is capable of extracting ice pieces from even farthest positions in the tank and that most of the time to completely <b>empty</b> <b>the</b> <b>tank,</b> would be spent on removing the ice pieces at the farthest positions from the floodgate. This time can be further reduced by using a wider floodgate. There are oscillations observed in the reach time vs. distance plots. Regardless, an average trend is noticed {{for the majority of the}} domain. The nature of the trendline is a power function of the form t = Ar^B where t is the reach time, r is the distance of the initial position from the floodgate and A,B are constants. Further exploration of the relationship of A and B with different ice piece and flow parameters along with the experimental validation of this simulation is part of the future work...|$|E

40|$|The Department of Energy, Idaho Operations Office (DOE-ID) is in {{the process}} of closing two {{underground}} high-level waste (HLW) storage tanks at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) to meet Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulations and Department of Energy orders. Closure of these two tanks is scheduled for 2004 as the first phase in closure of the eleven 1. 14 million liter (300, 000 gallon) tanks currently in service at the Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center (INTEC). The INTEC Tank Farm Facility (TFF) Closure sequence consists of multiple steps to be accomplished through the existing tank riser access points. Currently, the tank risers contain steam and process waste lines associated with the steam jets, corrosion coupons, and liquid level indicators. As necessary, this equipment will be removed from the risers to allow adequate space for closure equipment and activities. The basic tank closure sequence is as follows: <b>Empty</b> <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> to the residual heel using the existing jets; Video and sample the heel; Replace steam jets with new jet at a lower position in the tank, and remove additional material; Flush tank, piping and secondary containment with demineralized water; Video and sample the heel; Evaluate decontamination effectiveness; Displace the residual heel with multiple placements of grout; and Grout piping, vaults and remaining tank volume. Design, development, and deployment of a remotely operated tank cleaning system were completed in June 2002. The system incorporates many commercially available components, which have been adapted for application in cleaning high-level waste tanks. The system is cost-effective since it also utilizes existing waste transfer technology (steam jets), to remove tank heel solids from the tank bottoms during the cleaning operations. Remotely operated directional spray nozzles, automatic rotating wash balls, video monitoring equipment, decontamination spray-rings, and tank -specific access interface devices have been integrated to provide a system that efficiently cleans tank walls and heel solids in an acidic, radioactive environment. Through the deployment of the tank cleaning system, the INEEL High Level Waste Program has cleaned tanks to meet RCRA clean closure standards and DOE closure performance measures. Design, development, and testing of tank grouting delivery equipment were completed in October 2002. The system incorporates lessons learned from closures at other DOE facilities. The grout will be used to displace the tank residuals remaining after the cleaning is complete. To maximize heel displacement to the discharge pump, grout was placed in a sequence of five positions utilizing two riser locations. The project is evaluating the use of six positions to optimize the residuals removed. After the heel has been removed and the residuals stabilized, the tank, piping, and secondary containment will be grouted...|$|E
