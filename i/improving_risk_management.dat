40|$|Using a {{non-parametric}} {{technique for}} data from 1995 to 2004, we investigate {{the cost and}} profit efficiency of 28 Chinese commercial banks. We examine the influence of ownership type, size, risk profile, profitability and key environmental changes on the bank efficiency using a Tobit regression. Consistent with the existing literature, we find that profit efficiency levels are well below those of cost efficiency. This suggests {{that the most important}} inefficiencies are on the revenue side. Our findings are also consistent with prior evidence on ownership and efficiency: joint-stock banks (national and city-based), on average, appear to be more cost- and profit-efficient than state-owned banks while medium-sized banks are significantly more efficient than small and large banks. These and other results suggest the need for speedier reforms to open the banking market, <b>improving</b> <b>risk</b> <b>management,</b> minimizing the government's capital subsidy and diversifying ownership of Chinese banks. ...|$|E

When applied in complex geological environments, it requires advanced processing capabilities to ensure useful accuracy in the source location and characterization.

We then illustrate and discuss the potential of the chosen methodology in the mining context. This methodology allows improvements in acoustic monitoring of large-scale underground mines by taking into account the intrinsic characteristics of propagation of the acoustic waves. Ongoing work on a dataset collected during the monitoring of a large-scale salt cavern collapse is also discussed.

The probability of large losses for a certain portfolio or option book is dominated by correlated moves of its different constituents – for example, a position which is simultaneously long in stocks and short in bonds will be risky because stocks and bonds usually move in opposite directions in crisis periods.

40|$|Brief {{introduction}} to the problem Risk management {{is one of the}} important management strategies that lead the success of major construction projects. Managing risks has become {{an important part of the}} management activities in construction industry. In Hong Kong, marine construction forms a major part of the construction business. In fact, it is appeared that marine construction exposes to serious risks in comparing to other types of construction work, which contributes the potential loss to both clients and contractors. There is a need for systematic risk management approaches that can help contractors for reducing and controlling risks thus to effectively improve project management. This paper focuses on contractor parties who work on marine construction work, and aims to identify critical risks and risk response techniques in managing marine projects. Questionnaire survey and structured interviews are conducted. It is found that “underwater conditions are different from tender assumptions” is the most common risk factor encountered in marine projects, “unavailability of materials, plant and labour” is the most impact to the project if risk is encountered. The most effective risk response technique to tickle risks encountered is “refer to previous experience”. Recommendations for <b>improving</b> <b>risk</b> <b>management</b> are also discussed...|$|E

40|$|While {{economic}} development has proven elusive in African pastoral systems, change is pervasive. The {{majority of the}} Kajiado Maasai, for example, have endured marked declines in per capita livestock holdings {{and other aspects of}} human welfare over the past 50 years. We surveyed 317 Borana house-holds to see if similar patterns occurred in southern Ethiopia, and our pre-dictions were largely confirmed. Once viewed as the epitome of sustainable pastoralism, the Borana system now confronts numerous challenges. De-cline in per capita cattle holdings has spurred household-level diversification to include maize cultivation and camel husbandry in some areas. Resource pressure has encouraged local annexation of some formerly common access grazing areas. Economic links between pastoral households and local towns still appear rare, however. Our results suggest that patterns of internally in-duced socioeconomic change due to population pressure in such semiarid systems are broadly predictable, and that development intervention prior-ities should reflect system dynamics and address emerging issues. A focus on <b>improving</b> <b>risk</b> <b>management</b> by facilitating household economic diversi-fication and restoring some aspects of opportunistic resource use may be the most appropriate development options among the Ethiopian Boran at this time...|$|E
