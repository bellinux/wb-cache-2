60|$|He {{glanced at}} the Captain, who nodded back. In a few moments the Doctor reappeared. <b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> and whispered to the Captain.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>down,</b> and Hal {{held up his}} hand. The new-comer {{grasped the}} youth's wrist, {{and in a moment}} Hal was upon the cellar floor.|$|E
60|$|Capper {{had taken}} Greensheve's {{position}} on the cope, and now <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> his hand, and, first one and then the other, pulled them up.|$|E
6000|$|With a spirit-laden weight did <b>he</b> <b>lean</b> <b>down</b> passionate: [...] Toll slowly. [...] They {{have almost}} sapped the wall,--they will enter therewithal [...] With no {{knocking}} at the gate.|$|R
2500|$|She {{asks him}} for a kiss to [...] "comfort me" [...] and when <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> <b>down</b> to kiss her she pulls him from the saddle and drowns him. She swims to the shore and thanks God that [...] "The dangers she o'ercame".|$|R
50|$|The Deputy is then {{seen in a}} {{hotel room}} reading {{newspaper}} articles on a computer, when he stumbles across one which shows Courtney and Clint on their wedding day. Suddenly, articles about the murder in the church flood the screen, before Bughuul's symbol and a loud buzzing appear and the screen cuts out. When <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> <b>down</b> to collect his bag, the reflection of the screen shows Bughuul standing in the bathroom doorway behind the Deputy. When the Deputy sees it and looks behind him, there is nothing there. Bughuul then appears in the reflection again, before walking forward and putting his finger to his lips. The Deputy slams the laptop screen closed.|$|R
60|$|He {{ran back}} and speedily brought up Phil's pole, and around it he wound the line, to {{strengthen}} it {{and hold the}} joints together. Then <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>down.</b>|$|E
60|$|Rochester signalled {{with his}} whip to Saton {{to wait for}} a moment. As soon as the other two were out of earshot, <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> from his saddle.|$|E
60|$|Thorne {{smiled at}} them and then, calling to Kristine, who was {{standing}} near the door, <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> and handed her a bottle which he took from an open case.|$|E
50|$|The story {{then returns}} to Mears and Petrie {{at the church}} in Guatemala two years later. It quickly becomes clear that {{they are on the}} run from the {{surviving}} vampires from Salem's Lot, who have been relentlessly pursuing them. Their supplies of holy water glow whenever a vampire is nearby. Realising that they have been tracked down yet again, Mears and Petrie return to their lodgings to collect their belongings. However, once there, Mears finds Susan lying in his bed. Now a vampire, she prepares to bite him as <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> <b>down</b> to kiss her, but he drives a stake through her heart. Filled with grief, he and Petrie leave, knowing that vampires will forever hunt them.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked up}} at Nicholas, on whose arm she <b>leaned.</b> <b>He</b> looked <b>down</b> with that {{peculiar}} smile of his which seemed to lie more in his eyes than on his lips, and muttered something about a day anywhere being, etcetera, etcetera.|$|R
50|$|Dino finds {{a book on}} {{the beach}} and picks it up. The title of the book is 'Death'. He writes his name and date of birth as {{instructed}} and starts to read the book. A seductress steps out of a jet ski and sits down next to him. Wearing a golden swimsuit she invites him for dinner at 7 pm. Dino is on time and goes over well prepared with wine and condoms. When he is about to open her dress she tells that she will be back within two minutes with more provocative clothing and surprises which he would love taking off. But Dino falls into a nap and wakes up with a sound. He sees her dead in the bathroom. When <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> <b>down</b> to examine her closely she opens her eyes and he understands that she was actually a soul whose wishes had been left unfulfilled and chases him to the beach. She starts running after Dino which seems that she is a ghost. The process goes the whole night and in the morning Dino is found dead in the beach. All are surrounded him, the girl comes and saves Dino and asks him to come along with her. Dino goes with her leaving his earthly body behind.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly Slone's {{sensitive}} ear vibrated to {{a thrilling}} sound. <b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> to place {{his ear to}} the sand. Rapid, rhythmic beat of hoofs made him leap to his feet, reaching for his lasso with right hand and a gun with his left.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hullo! {{some kind}} friend has {{brought me a}} new door-mat as a present," [...] and <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> and stroked the soft hair with much pleasure. Then he wiped {{his feet on the}} new mat and went into the palace to tell the Queen.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, what a {{wonderful}} piece of luck!" [...] he cried; [...] "here is a red rose! I have never seen any rose like it in all my life. It is so beautiful that I am sure it has a long Latin name"; and <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> and plucked it.|$|E
60|$|Sabatini turned {{slightly}} towards Ruth, {{as though}} expecting an introduction. His lips were half parted; {{he had the}} air of one {{about to make a}} remark. Then suddenly a curious change seemed to come over his manner. His natural ease seemed to have entirely departed. He stood stiff and rigid, and there was something forbidding in his face as {{he looked down at the}} girl who had glanced timidly towards him. A word--it was inaudible but it sounded like part of a woman's name--escaped him. He had the appearance, during those few seconds, of a man who looks through the present into a past world. It was all over before even they could appreciate the situation. With a little smile <b>he</b> had <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> towards Ruth.|$|R
6000|$|Barry, at last, gave way, and, {{gradually}} extricating {{himself from}} the bedclothes, put his feet down on the floor, and remained sitting {{on the side of}} his bed. <b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> his head <b>down</b> on his hands, and groaned inwardly; for he was very sick, and the fumes of last night's punch still disturbed his brain. His stockings and drawers were on; for Terry, when he put him to bed, considered it only waste of time to pull them off, for [...] "shure wouldn't they have jist to go on agin the next morning?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, ay," [...] said he, [...] "he {{passed me}} word of that. But, ye see, the boat'll set ye ashore {{at the town}} pier, and that's but a penny stonecast from Rankeillor's house." [...] And here <b>he</b> {{suddenly}} <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> and whispered in my ear: [...] "Take care of the old tod;* he means mischief. Come aboard till I can get a word with ye." [...] And then, passing his arm through mine, he continued aloud, as he set off towards his boat: [...] "But, come, what can I bring ye from the Carolinas? Any friend of Mr. Balfour's can command. A roll of tobacco? Indian feather-work? a skin of a wild beast? a stone pipe? the mocking-bird that mews {{for all the world}} like a cat? the cardinal bird that is as red as blood?--take your pick and say your pleasure." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O Gran," [...] says Jemmy {{with a full}} heart, [...] "I am not worthy!" [...] But <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> and did it. Then the faltering fingers {{made out}} to catch hold of my sleeve at last, and I believe he was a-trying to kiss me when he died.|$|E
60|$|Jocelyn Thew {{paid for}} his {{telephone}} call and walked leisurely {{out of the hotel}} with a smile upon his lips. The stimulus of danger was like wine to him. The little man was choosing a cigar at the stall. As <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> to light it, Jocelyn Thew's practiced eye caught the shape of a revolver in his hip pocket.|$|E
60|$|Carnally consented dubiously. The {{rock was}} about thirty {{feet in height}} and very steep, though there were several crevices and broken edges. Andrew ascended one of the latter, {{gripping}} it with hands and knees. Reaching a narrow ledge, <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> and gave his hand to Carnally, {{and when he had}} helped him up they stopped for a minute or two. They were weak and hungry, and there was an awkward bulge above.|$|E
60|$|As if impelled by a {{dark and}} {{sinister}} force, <b>he</b> slowly <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> to pull his bag from under the bed. He opened it, and drew out his Colt's automatic gun. Though the June day was warm this big worn metal weapon had a cold touch. He {{did not feel that}} he wanted to handle it, but he did. It seemed heavy, a thing of subtle, latent energy, with singular fascination for him. It brought up a dark flowing tide of memory. Lane shut his eyes, and saw the tide flow by with its conflict and horror. The feel of his gun, and the recall of what it had meant to him in terrible hours, drove away a wavering of will, and a still voice that tried to pierce his consciousness. It fixed his sinister intention. He threw the gun on the bed, and rising began to pace the floor.|$|R
60|$|She <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> {{and caught}} his hand; her touch was fiery hot.|$|R
60|$|Fra Girolamo <b>leaned</b> <b>down.</b> But {{no other}} word came for some moments.|$|R
6000|$|... 'God be thankit, I'm nae too late!' and a {{fisherman}} with great thigh-boots came hurriedly climbing over the rock. In an instant he recognised {{the gravity of}} the danger, and with a cheering 'Haud fast, mon! I'm comin'!' scrambled down till he found a firm foothold. Then with one strong hand holding the rock above, <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>down,</b> and catching Markam's wrist, called out to him, 'Haud to me, mon! Haud to me wi' ither hond!' ...|$|E
6000|$|The clergyman at my {{left was}} an old {{acquaintance}} of mine--clergyman now, but had spent {{the first half of}} his life in the camp and field, and as an instructor in the military school at Woolwich. Just at the moment I have been talking about, a veiled and singular light glimmered in his eyes, and <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> and muttered confidentially to me--indicating the hero of the banquet with a gesture,--'Privately--his glory is an accident--just a product of incredible luck.' ...|$|E
60|$|She {{entered his}} room collectedly. He was lying, neatly dressed, upon a couch with his {{shoulders}} raised against {{the end of}} it, for he had thrown the cushions which supported him upon the floor. As she came in, <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> {{in an attempt to}} recover them, and finding himself too late looked up guiltily. The fact that he could move with so much freedom was a comfort to the girl. She set the tray down on a table near him.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Presley <b>leans</b> <b>down</b> {{towards her}} husband in the temple scene of the music video.|$|R
60|$|Then she <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> to {{me until}} her splendid eyes looked {{straight}} into my dazzled ones.|$|R
60|$|The disheveled maid was no {{polished}} {{mistress of}} ceremonies. She <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> {{into the void}} and hailed Aline.|$|R
60|$|Volador seemed fit and fresh, {{for which}} he was thankful, for it was nearly twenty miles to the mountain, and he was, after all, a little {{uncertain}} about the speed of the policeman's horse, though the appearance of the beast, which he had seen in the hotel stable, did not suggest any great powers in this respect. It was, however, not the one Slaney usually rode, which he fancied might, perhaps, be significant. At length <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> and patted Volador's neck.|$|E
60|$|They {{had both}} risen to their feet. He {{was close to}} her now, and she felt herself {{caught up in a}} passionate wave of inertia, an {{absolute}} inability to protest or resist. His arms were clasped around her lightly and with exceeding gentleness. <b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>down.</b> She found herself wondering, even in that tumultuous moment, at the strange clearness of his complexion, the whiteness of his firm, strong teeth, the soft brilliance of his eyes, which caressed her even before his lips rested upon hers.|$|E
60|$|Hetty {{looked up}} at him and smiled through her tears, as she had done to Arthur that first evening in the wood, when she had thought he was not coming, and yet he came. It was a feebler relief, a feebler triumph she felt now, but the great dark eyes and the sweet lips were as {{beautiful}} as ever, perhaps more beautiful, for there was a more luxuriant womanliness about Hetty of late. Adam could hardly believe in the happiness of that moment. His right hand held her left, and he pressed her arm close against his heart as <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> towards her.|$|E
60|$|She {{began to}} shiver. Groves <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> {{and tried to}} peer through the keyhole. He {{rose to his feet}} hastily.|$|R
60|$|She <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> {{and picked}} up a sea-fishing rod. Jacob was terrified as he saw her swaying {{backwards}} and forwards.|$|R
60|$|Jo <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> to {{kiss the}} {{tranquil}} face, and with that silent kiss, she dedicated herself soul and body to Beth.|$|R
