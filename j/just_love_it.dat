Whitney correctly believes Babe has concocted Abi's pregnancy and confronts her, but Babe threatens {{to reveal her}} kiss with Mick so Whitney backs down. McGarty enjoyed the rivalry between Babe and Whitney, adding that it is [...] "so much fun to deliver all the sly little comments that [...] gives to Babe." [...] The actress praised Badland, branding her [...] "scary" [...] in character {{and said she was}} [...] "a bit frightened" [...] of her. Babe and Whitney clash again when Babe blames her for the Carter family's financial problems and tells her that she has [...] "ruined" [...] Lee's life. Babe is left annoyed when Whitney fights back against Babe. Kilkelly (Digital Spy) questioned whether Babe has [...] "finally met her match" [...] when she battles Whitney. Lindsay (Metro) praised the scene in which Babe blames Whitney for the family's financial problems and said, [...] "we <b>just</b> <b>love</b> <b>it</b> when scheming Aunt Babe gets put in her place".|$|E
500|$|The {{community}} of Stockton opposed filming in the area, as memories of Leigh's murder were still fresh {{and the details}} of the script were [...] "too close for comfort". When filmmakers arrived in Stockton in late August 1996, locations that had previously been reserved were suddenly no longer available. The local media treated them with hostility. Former Newcastle deputy mayor and Stockton resident Frank Rigby criticised the film during production, saying [...] "I would <b>just</b> <b>love</b> <b>it</b> to go away and so would everybody else." [...] Brian Joyce was also critical of the decision to film in the area, saying the filmmakers had to acknowledge the choice they had made in doing so. The situation was exacerbated by the filmmakers' denial that the film was specifically about Leigh, despite their choice of Stockton for filming. During production [...] in September 1996, Elfick told The Newcastle Herald that he was [...] "getting a bit bored" [...] of people mentioning Leigh's murder. While acknowledging that the comments were understandable, Elfick concluded, [...] "Unfortunately, that event happens all over Australia. We wanted to take the events of that murder and many other murders". He was also quoted in The Sydney Morning Herald as saying, [...] "The movie is bigger than the Leigh Leigh thing". Elfick hoped that people viewing the film would see it as a positive {{way of looking at the}} circumstances that led to Leigh's death, and that it would make people think and maybe stop something like that happening to someone in the future. Leigh's family were vehemently opposed to the film, saying that the filmmakers were [...] "feasting on an unfortunate situation", insensitively trivialising and exploiting her death, and portraying her negatively while doing so. One of Leigh's aunts wrote to The Newcastle Herald later that month, saying [...] "David Elfick doesn't seem to mind [...] free publicity even if it comes from the tragic and brutal assault, rape, and murder of a fourteen-year-old virgin, not as he called it: 'the Leigh Leigh thing which happens all over Australia.'" [...] Enright said that while Leigh's murder served as the inspiration, the completed film is about the way a small town reacts when one of its own members murders another.|$|E
500|$|One {{of their}} most notable episodes was [...] "Homer's Enemy", an episode {{designed}} to [...] "push the envelope conceptually." [...] The idea for [...] "Homer's Enemy" [...] was first conceived by Oakley, who thought that Homer should have an enemy. This evolved into {{the concept of a}} [...] "real world" [...] co-worker who would either love or hate Homer. The writers chose the latter as they thought it would have funnier results. The result was the character of Frank Grimes, a man who has had to work hard all his life with nothing to show for it and is dismayed and embittered by Homer's success and comfort in spite of his inherent laziness and ignorance. [...] "Homer's Enemy" [...] explores the comic possibilities of a realistic character with a strong work ethic placed alongside Homer in a work environment. In the episode, Homer is portrayed as an everyman and the embodiment of the American spirit; in some scenes, his negative characteristics and silliness are prominently highlighted. By the close of the episode, Grimes, a hard working and persevering [...] "real American hero," [...] is relegated to the role of antagonist; the viewer is intended to be pleased that Homer has emerged victorious. Oakley says the episode was [...] "hyper-meta" [...] and focused on [...] "parodying to some degree the Homer we don't like. That's {{one of the things that}} episode is supposed to illustrate– 'Homer gone wrong'. Although, I would argue that in 'Homer's Enemy' he's not even really even all that excessively stupid or immature, actually." [...] Weinstein said: [...] "We wanted to do an episode where the thinking was 'What if a real life, normal person had to enter Homer's universe and deal with him?' I know this episode is controversial and divisive, but I <b>just</b> <b>love</b> <b>it.</b> It really feels like what would happen if a real, somewhat humorless human had to deal with Homer. There was some talk [...] about the ending—we just did that because (a) it’s really funny and shocking, (2) we like the lesson of 'sometimes, you just can't win'—the whole Frank Grimes episode is a study in frustration and hence Homer has the last laugh and (3) we wanted to show that in real life, being Homer Simpson could be really dangerous and life threatening, as Frank Grimes sadly learned." [...] When the episode was first broadcast, many fans felt it was too dark, unfunny and that Homer was portrayed as overly bad-mannered. On the DVD commentary, Weinstein considers this episode one of the most controversial of the seasons he ran, as it involves sharp observational humor which many fans [...] "didn't get." [...] Weinstein talks about a [...] "generation gap"—the episode was originally panned by viewers, but has since become a favorite among fans who grew up with the show.|$|E

Ken is the last living member of the Daisuke clan, and wants more than anything to kill General Nataku. Genchu saved his life.

I'm so homely nobody will ever want to marry me--unless {{it might be a}} foreign missionary. I suppose a foreign missionary mightn't be very particular. But I do hope that some day I shall have a white dress. That is my highest ideal of earthly bliss. I just love pretty clothes. And I've never had a pretty dress in my life that I can remember--but of course it's all the more to look forward to, isn't it? And then I can imagine that I'm dressed gorgeously. This morning when I left the asylum I felt so ashamed because I had to wear this horrid old wincey dress. All the orphans had to wear them, you know. A {{merchant}} in Hopeton last winter donated three hundred yards of wincey to the asylum. Some people said it was because he couldn't sell it, but I'd rather believe that it was out of the kindness of his heart, wouldn't you? When we got on the train I felt as if everybody must be looking at me and pitying me. But I just went to work and imagined that I had on the most beautiful pale blue silk dress--because when you ARE imagining you might as well imagine something worth while--and a big hat all flowers and nodding plumes, and a gold watch, and kid gloves and boots. I felt cheered up right away and I enjoyed my trip to the Island with all my might. I wasn't a bit sick coming over in the boat. Neither was Mrs. Spencer although she generally is. She said she hadn't time to get sick, watching to see that I didn't fall overboard. She said she never saw the beat of me for prowling about. But if it kept her from being seasick it's a mercy I did prowl, isn't it? And I wanted to see everything that was to be seen on that boat, because I didn't know whether I'd ever have another opportunity. Oh, {{there are a lot more}} cherry-trees all in bloom! This Island is the bloomiest place. I <b>just</b> <b>love</b> <b>it</b> already, and I'm so glad I'm going to live here. I've always heard that Prince Edward Island was the prettiest place in the world, and I used to imagine I was living here, but I never really expected I would. It's delightful when your imaginations come true, isn't it? But those red roads are so funny. When we got into the train at Charlottetown and the red roads began to flash past I asked Mrs. Spencer what made them red and she said she didn't know and for pity's sake not to ask her any more questions. She said I must have asked her a thousand already. I suppose I had, too, but how you going to find out about things if you don't ask questions? And what DOES make the roads red?" ...|$|E
