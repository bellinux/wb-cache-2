There is also a battle mode in which the aim is to attack the karts of the other human players.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{the patent}} {{described}} several ways {{of creating the}} carbon filament including [...] "cotton and linen thread, wood splints, papers coiled in various ways", {{it was not until}} several months after the patent was granted that Edison and his team discovered a carbonized bamboo filament that could last over 1,200hours. The idea of using this particular raw material originated from Edison's recalling his examination of a few threads from a bamboo <b>fishing</b> <b>pole</b> while relaxing on the shore of Battle Lake in the present-day state of Wyoming, where he and other members of a scientific team had traveled so that they could clearly observe a total eclipse of the sun on July 29, 1878, from the Continental Divide.|$|E
2500|$|... "Gone fishin'" [...] â€“ The {{most notable}} of TNT's catchphrases. It is used {{whenever}} a team is {{knocked out of}} the playoffs (or a team {{failed to make the}} playoffs), and is usually accompanied by doctored photos of players on the team on fishing boats with analyst Kenny Smith. Reportedly, it {{has its roots in the}} 90s - when the Suns had a chance to eliminate a team, their gorilla mascot would have a <b>fishing</b> <b>pole</b> on hand to indicate the opponents would be [...] "gone fishin'". [...] Occasionally, Barkley or Smith will wear fishing hats when they anticipate a team's elimination from the playoffs. In addition to players, notable figures from the city of the eliminated team often show up (e.g., Condoleezza Rice, who was doctored into a Gone Fishin' photo after the Washington Wizards were eliminated from the 2005 playoffs). The catchphrase has gotten popular enough to warrant its own page on NBA.com and has also become a metaphor for being eliminated from the playoffs. TBS uses similar phrase for when a team gets knocked out of the MLB playoffs, called [...] "Gone huntin'", as most North American hunting seasons occur in mid-to-late fall.|$|E

2500|$|Steelhead trout (coastal rainbow trout) (Oncorhynchus mykiss irideus) {{occurred}} historically in Adobe Creek {{based on}} a report touting the trout in the Sportsman Gazetteer in 1877. This very early report makes rumors that Adobe Creek's trout were introduced extremely unlikely since the first trout hatcheries in California did not propagate any trout until the 1870s, and much of their production was shipped to hatcheries out of state. A physical specimen was collected in 1893 by Stanford Biology Professor W. W. Thoburn {{and is in the}} California Academy of Sciences collection. In 1898 John Otterbein Snyder collected steelhead trout specimens in San Antonio Creek (now Adobe Creek). A 1909 land office brochure promoted Los Altos for its [...] "never-failing mountain trout stream, trout caught a few feet from kitchen doors". The reaches upstream from Hidden Villa have been judged excellent trout spawning habitat. Josephine Duveneck wrote, [...] "Before the era of concrete, fish used to swim up to spawn and native trout lured many a small boy to seek out the deeper pools carrying his home-made <b>fishing</b> <b>pole</b> and can of worms." [...] Local historian Florence Fava also reported that [...] "the creeks which lace the (Hidden Villa) property and join Adobe Creek were originally full of fish". Steelhead often were caught using large wet flies with 2x tippet during the early 1970s. [...] Locations that held spawning steelhead included the large cement pieces downstream from the Foothill Junior College paint shop outflow and cut banks just below Interstate 280. [...] According to the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG), steelhead were caught by local fishermen during 1985, 1986 and 1987 in Mayfield Slough at the confluence of Matadero and Adobe Creeks. At least six steelhead were noted passing the tidal gates at Mayfield Slough in the Palo Alto Flood Basin in April 1987. There are many formidable obstacles to fish passage on Adobe Creek, including the culverts at the El Camino Real and Interstate 280 overpasses, a drop structure at the Foothill College bridge and the long concrete trapezoidal channel structure from El Camino Real northward to Highway 101. Additional barriers occur at the O'Keefe Lane and Hidden Villa bridges, and the creek suffers from significant bank erosion, failing channel stabilization structures, and sedimentation. Finally, the trash rack at the tidal gate at the mouth of Mayfield Slough is an intermittent complete barrier to fish passage when it is closed.|$|E

5000|$|The {{vessel was}} built in 1961 by Ditmar-Donaldson in Costa Mesa as a {{personal}} fishing boat for Gilbert C. Van Camp III, the CEO of the Van Camp Seafood Company and makers of [...] "Chicken of the Sea" [...] tuna. As a fishing boat, the Vantuna was configured for albacore fishing. The vessel held two large, 2500 gal live bait tanks and a 15-ton refrigerated fish hold. Metal racks attached to the stern provided platforms for fishermen close to the water's surface. They used long <b>fishing</b> <b>poles</b> with stainless steel leaders and barbless hooks. When large schools of albacore were located, live bait thrown into the water caused the fish {{to go into a}} feeding frenzy where they would bite anything, including the barbless hooks of the <b>fishing</b> <b>poles.</b> <b>Fish</b> that were hooked were quickly pulled onboard by the fisherman. The barbless hooks would easily fall out of the fish's mouth, and then the fish was moved into the refrigerated hold. Although this was his personal fishing boat, Mr. Van Camp took the fish he caught to the factory where they were used by his company.|$|R
