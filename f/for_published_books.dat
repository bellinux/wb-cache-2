5000|$|Last Unicorn Games {{was one of}} {{the first}} roleplaying {{companies}} to utilise the concept of releasing additional pages <b>for</b> <b>published</b> <b>books</b> via the web. LUG dubbed these [...] "Icon Links," [...] in reference to their overall [...] "Icon System" [...] game mechanics (the term Web Enhancement hadn't been invented yet). Unlike current web enhancements, which are simply additions that can be added to the end of a book, LUG took a unique approach, by planning the enhancements ahead of time, and printing a small Icon symbol at various points in a given book, informing the reader that additional material on the subject-at-hand was available on the company's website to read or download and print. These enhancements are now being stored online, and can be downloaded from Memory Icon, under the Icon Links section.|$|E
5000|$|... "Let's {{kill all}} the lawyers" [...] {{is a line}} from William Shakespeare's Henry VI, Part2, Act IV, Scene 2. The full quote is [...] "The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers". This quote is among one of Shakespeare's most famous quotes, {{as well as one}} of his most {{controversial}} quotes. [...] The quote has been the title of movies as well as the title <b>for</b> <b>published</b> <b>books.</b> [...] Shakespeare may be making a joke when character [...] "Dick The Butcher" [...] suggests one of the ways the band of pretenders to the throne can improve the country is to kill all the lawyers. Dick is a rough character, a killer as evil as his name implies, like the other henchmen, and this is his rough solution to his perceived societal problem. [...] There is some disagreement with the interpretation that one of Shakespeare's sympathetic characters would make a joke suggesting that killing lawyers would make the world better. [...] The Florida Bar Association contends the quote was a lawyer joke.|$|E
