5|$|In 1844, the London and Croydon Railway {{was given}} {{parliamentary}} authority to test an experimental pneumatic propulsion {{system on the}} railway (referred to {{at the time as}} the atmospheric-propulsion system). A pumping station was built on Portland Road; this created a vacuum in a pipe paralleling the railway tracks. A piston extended downwards from the trains into a slit in the pipe, meaning that trains were literally sucked towards the pumping station or blown away from it. The pumping station was built in a Gothic style, with a very tall ornate tower which served both as a chimney and as an <b>exhaust</b> <b>vent</b> for air pumped from the propulsion pipe.|$|E

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Key standards for manufactured homes provide a lower margin of safety against a carbon monoxide exposure incident than those for site-built homes, which are constructed at their permanent locations. For instance, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Code requires a minimum 3 -foot separation between air intakes and <b>exhaust</b> <b>vents,</b> while industry standards for site-built homes have required a greater distance for many years. The industry standards call for a greater separation between air intakes and <b>exhaust</b> <b>vents</b> to help reduce the risk that contaminants such as carbon monoxide will re-enter the home. Indoor air quality experts whom GAO interviewed stated that the exhaust of an improperly operating furnace combined with unique wind conditions could, in rare cases, present a risk of carbon monoxide exposure.

500|$|A half-hour later, Shinano {{was making}} 10 knots with a 13 degree list. At 06:00 her list had {{increased}} to 20 degrees after the starboard boiler room flooded, {{at which point}} the valves of the port trimming tanks rose above the waterline and became ineffective. The engines shut down for lack of steam around 07:00, and Abe ordered all of the propulsion compartments evacuated an hour later. He then ordered the three outboard port boiler rooms flooded in a futile attempt to reduce the carrier's list. He also ordered Hamakaze and Isokaze to take her in tow. [...] However, the two destroyers only displaced [...] between them, about one-fourteenth of Shinanos displacement and not nearly enough to overcome her deadweight. The first tow cables snapped under the strain and the second attempt was aborted for fear of injury to the crews if they snapped again. The ship lost all power around 09:00 and was now listing over 20 degrees. At 10:18, Abe gave the order to abandon ship; by this time Shinano had a list of 30 degrees. As she heeled, water flowed into the open elevator well on her flight deck, sucking many swimming sailors back into the ship as she sank. A large <b>exhaust</b> <b>vent</b> below the flight deck also sucked many other sailors into the ship as she submerged.|$|E

Commanded by Governor Tarkin, {{it is the}} Galactic Empire's [...] "ultimate weapon", a huge spherical space station over 100 kilometers in diameter capable of destroying a planet with one shot of its superlaser. The film opens with Princess Leia transporting the station's schematics to the Rebel Alliance to aid them in destroying the Death Star. Tarkin orders the Death Star to destroy Leia's home world of Alderaan {{in an attempt to}} press her into giving him the location of the secret Rebel base; she gives them the false location of Dantooine, but Tarkin has Alderaan destroyed anyway, as a demonstration of the Death Star's firepower and the Empire's resolve. Later, Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Chewbacca, Obi-Wan Kenobi, C-3PO, and R2-D2 are pulled aboard the station by a tractor beam, where they discover and manage to rescue Princess Leia. As they make their escape, Obi-Wan dies fighting Darth Vader, enabling the others to flee the station. Later, Luke returns as part of a fighter force to attack its only weak point: a ray-shielded particle <b>exhaust</b> <b>vent</b> leading straight from the surface directly into its reactor core. Luke was able to successfully launch his fighter's torpedoes into the vent, impacting the core and triggering a catastrophic explosion, which completely destroyed the station before it could use its superlaser weapon to annihilate its intended target, the rebel base on Yavin IV.|$|E

40|$|A set of {{full-scale}} experiments {{was conducted}} to study thermal and smoke control strategies using transverse ventilation system in a sloping urban traffic link tunnel (UTLT). Results showed {{that it is not}} the case that the slower the smoke spread longitudinally, the better the smoke being controlled. For transverse ventilation, within the smoke extraction compartment, the faster the smoke spread to the <b>exhaust</b> <b>vents</b> the faster the smoke being extracted from the tunnel. More importantly, the operation of the <b>exhaust</b> and supply <b>vents</b> for transverse ventilation in real time should take the effect of tunnel slope into consideration. For tunnel with a slope going uphill from upstream to downstream, supplying air from the downstream is recommended while supplying air from the upstream or directly to the fire located smoke compartment should be avoided. Additionally, for a given total smoke exhaust volume flow rate, increasing the number of <b>exhaust</b> <b>vents</b> is an effective way of controlling the smoke layer interface height. For the kind of tunnel as studied at hand, open the <b>exhaust</b> <b>vents</b> in the fire located compartment and its downstream smoke compartment is recommended...|$|R

40|$|The Fire Dynamics Simulator code {{is used to}} {{investigate}} the smoke movement in an atrium under fire scenario. At first, by comparing with experimental data of the atrium fire under low and high heat release rates, reasonable model constants of Cs and Prt and appropriate grid system are determined for simulating smoke movement in the atrium, the simulation results are in good agreement with those experimental data. Then, the performance of different smoke exhaust methods in the atrium is studied. Smoke filling processes are investigated under different natural and enhanced smoke exhaust methods. Simulated results show that natural smoke exhaust method is preferred when the smoke <b>exhaust</b> <b>vents</b> are located at {{the ceiling of the}} atrium. On the other hand, when the smoke <b>exhaust</b> <b>vents</b> are located {{on the walls of the}} atrium, the higher positions of the smoke <b>exhaust</b> <b>vents</b> are preferred. In addition, the influence of the fire source locations on the smoke spreading process is presented in this paper, three kinds of fire source locations are studied, they are central fire, side wall fire and corner fire.
