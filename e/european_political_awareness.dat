40|$|In {{the article}} the author {{analyzes}} {{the parameters of}} European political consciousness, i. e. European research field of political consciousness in qualitative and quantitative terms, which may be based on different indicators. The issue of emergence and development of European political consciousness becomes topical because firstly, its formation as the subjective dimension of European integration policy is not a spontaneous process and, secondly, European integration is carried out {{not only from the}} top but from the bottom, requiring deliberate interference of the public with the process; the public possesses the formed European political consciousness. Since the latter is a specific mental construct, the author offers to apply the triad «criteria ­ parameters – indicators». The characteristic that makes it possible to evaluate certain processes or phenomena in the system of Europeanness / Europeanism and specifies the quality system of views and opinions, which are realized in European behavior, is considered to be the criterion of European political consciousness. The European political consciousness parameters are seen to include the relevant historical memory, trends of public opinion and awareness regarding the European Union and position of its members in the European integration process, including the assessment of the existence and development of the EU; knowledge and views on the main EU institutions, assessing the importance of the main institutions of the EU and trust in them; a positive vision {{for the future of the}} European Union etc. The author considers the performance and objective characteristics and dimensions, including positive correlation of national and European levels of identity (European identity) and European behavior to be the indicatiors of <b>European</b> <b>political</b> <b>awareness.</b> On the basis of these indicators the control of the condition and trends of European political consciousness development will be carried out...|$|E

40|$|With the {{increasing}} {{turmoil in the}} international and domestic political realm, it is vital for college students, who are {{the next generation of}} leaders, to remain engaged with and attentive to politics. This research project attempts to gauge the approximate level of <b>political</b> <b>awareness</b> of residential, undergraduate students at Indiana Wesleyan University, a Midwestern Christian liberal arts university, in order to encourage activities that promote high level of <b>political</b> <b>awareness.</b> <b>Political</b> <b>awareness</b> is defined as the recognition of the functions of the US government, government actions (policies, laws, etc), and the current events which motivate those actions. To test <b>political</b> <b>awareness,</b> randomly selected participants took a survey consisting of self-assessment questions and objective knowledge-based questions to determine perceived and actual levels of <b>political</b> <b>awareness.</b> After collecting the data, the project analyzed overall levels of <b>political</b> <b>awareness</b> as well as compared levels of <b>political</b> <b>awareness</b> by gender, major, and year in school. Tentative results suggest that IWU students possess basic levels of <b>political</b> <b>awareness...</b>|$|R

40|$|The recent {{political}} events in Egypt, Libya, Yemen, and Tunisia (2011) have confirmed the key role of social networks (SNSs), {{as well as}} online political news in supporting citizens with their self-determination. Furthermore, “changes in the media landscape present new challenges for scholars interested {{in the relationship between}} the media and civil society. Additionally, the explosion of the Internet that started in advanced democracies and has spread through much of the globe provides new and unexplored pathways for communication. Moreover, the inclusion of the Internet in the media environment raises new questions for citizens, politicians, researchers, journalists, and government” (Oates, Owen & Gibson, 2006, p. 1). This study looks at the relationships between young people’s exposure to political news on the Internet and their <b>political</b> <b>awareness.</b> It develops and applies an index for political participation composed of several variables measuring political interest, discussion, knowledge, and participation. The survey among students in both countries was administered in Arabic and German, while the master questionnaire was developed in English. The survey was conducted between April and June 2010 in Egypt at Minia University and in Germany at Technical university of Dresden. The sample size was 1000 (500 in each country) students from several departments representing different academic fields: three departments of Engineering, three departments of Humanities and Social Science, and finally three departments of Natural Science. The study’s main research question was: “What is the impact of students’ exposure to political news on the Internet on their <b>political</b> <b>awareness</b> and civic activities?” The researcher started from the hypothesis that heavy use of political news on the Internet is positively related to <b>political</b> <b>awareness.</b> A further research question aimed at gauging the role of intervening variables such as gender and field of study for the relationship between the use of political news on the Internet and the level of <b>political</b> <b>awareness.</b> Results show that there is a positive relationship between using political online news and <b>political</b> <b>awareness.</b> German students’ <b>political</b> <b>awareness</b> for German students was higher than Egypt student’s <b>political</b> <b>awareness</b> (M= 63. 02, SD= 15. 65, comparing to M= 45. 72, SD= 17. 65 for Egyptians) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{goal of this}} diploma {{thesis is}} to define the <b>European</b> <b>political</b> parties. The thesis has been divided into five chapters, which are further subdivided. The reason why I have chosen this topic is quite simple - to analyse {{the current status of}} the <b>European</b> <b>political</b> parties and {{introduce}} them to wider audience not to be confused anymore with political groups in the European Parliament. In the first chapter the thesis brings a brief definition of the legal constitution of political groups in the European Parliament. For many years there has been confusion between the concept of a <b>European</b> <b>political</b> party and political group, so the thesis defines the political groups and its position in the European Parliament {{in order to create a}} basis for their differentiation from the <b>European</b> <b>political</b> parties. The second chapter is devoted to create a definition of the <b>European</b> <b>political</b> party and to bring the legal regulation of the <b>European</b> <b>political</b> parties. The thesis focuses also on the variability of their legal base in the treaties of the European Union (legal base before the Treaty of Lisbon, legal base in the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe and legal base in the Treaty of Lisbon). The third chapter is dedicated to legal issues of the <b>European</b> <b>political</b> parties. Emphasis was put on [...] ...|$|R
