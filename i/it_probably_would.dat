5|$|The {{adductor}} muscle of the jaw {{appears to have}} attached to the quadrate instead of the supratemporal fenestra. Both this and the other mastication muscles were likely weak, and Nigersaurus is estimated to have {{had one of the}} weakest bites of the sauropods. In addition, the small, nearly parallel nature of the tooth scratches and pits (caused by grit, which would not be obtained as often by high-browsers) indicate that it ate relatively soft, herbaceous plants such as low-growing ferns. Because of the lateral orientation of the teeth, <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> {{not have been able to}} chew. Nigersaurus wore its tooth crowns down faster than other dinosaurian herbivores, and its tooth replacement rate was the highest of any known dinosaur. Each tooth was replaced once every 14 days; the rate had previously been estimated lower. In contrast to Nigersaurus, sauropods with lower tooth replacement rates and broader tooth crowns are thought to have been canopy browsers.|$|E

25|$|The unique {{horizontal}} stabilizer design was free-floating; the attached small foreplane was directly {{controlled by the}} pilot and pulled the stabilizer up or down; so, it was aerodynamically, not mechanically controlled, and this resulted in sluggish pitch control, increasingly so at low speeds where airflow over the small foreplane was lessened, and if the project had developed further, <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> {{have been replaced by}} a conventional all-flying tailplane. The unpredictable behavior of the design often caused pilot-induced oscillations, with the sudden and erratic deployment of leading edge slats causing the aircraft to be nearly uncontrollable much of the time.|$|E
25|$|The {{explosive}} mechanism was a gas-enhanced device {{consisting of}} compressed butane in canisters employed with pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) {{to create a}} fuel-air explosive. The bomb was carried on a layer of concrete covered with a slab of marble to direct the blast upward. Despite the lack of sophistication and wide availability of its component parts, a gas-enhanced device can be a lethal weapon. These devices were similar to fuel-air or thermobaric weapons, explaining the large blast and damage. An after-action forensic investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) determined that the bomb was so powerful that <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> have brought down the building even if the sentries had managed to stop the truck between the gate and the building.|$|E

25|$|The Mark 6's contact {{exploder}} mechanism {{descended from}} the Mark 3 contact exploder. Both exploders had the unusual feature that the firing pin's travel was perpendicular to the torpedo's travel, so the firing pin {{would be subject to}} side loading when the torpedo struck its target. The Mark 3 exploder was designed when torpedo speeds were much slower (the Mark 10 torpedo's speed was 30 knots), but even then the Mark 3 prototypes had problems with the firing pin binding during the high deceleration when the torpedo collided with the target. The solution was to use a stronger firing spring to overcome the binding. The Mark 14 torpedo had a much higher speed (46 knots), so it would see significantly higher deceleration, but BuOrd apparently just assumed the contact exploder would work at the higher speed. There were no live-fire tests of the Mark 14 torpedo, so there were no-live fire tests of its contact exploder. If BuOrd had tried some live-fire tests of the contact exploder during peacetime, <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> have experienced some duds and rediscovered the binding problem.|$|E

The episode was only shown during certain animation festivals {{and was never}} aired on Cartoon Network or any television channel due to the characters swearing, even though the swear words were censored. Tartakovsky commented that [...] "standards didn't like it."

500|$|The wedding {{took place}} in 1908. According {{to a number of}} Mao's biographers, the {{ceremony}} would have likely followed traditional rural Hunanese custom. Thus, <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> have begun with a feast in the groom's home on the day before the ceremony, to which friends and relatives were invited. The next day, the bride would have been dressed in red, with a red veil over her face, and carried by red palanquin to the groom's family home. [...] There, her veil would have been removed, and she would have been expected to express unhappiness and dissatisfaction with the groom by publicly insulting him. According to tradition, a display of fireworks would probably have taken place, before both bride and groom would have kowtowed to each guest, to the groom's ancestral altar, to the spirits, and to one another, concluding the ceremony.|$|E
500|$|Make-up {{supervisor}} Michael Westmore {{had previously}} used makeup to age DeForest Kelley {{in the season}} premiere [...] "Encounter at Farpoint", but [...] "Too Short a Season" [...] proved a unique challenge as four stages of make-up were required to show Admiral Jameson de-aging. The initial stage to show Jameson at his oldest, involved Rohner wearing a bald-cap and wig plus latex prosthetics applied to his eyes, forehead, throat and jowls. That stage took up to four hours {{to apply to the}} actor. Westmore found himself worn out by the volume of work during this episode, as at the time the make-up team on the series included just him and Werner Keppler. On the second day of shooting the first stage make-up, Westmore arrived after Rohner had been in make-up for three hours only to find that he was only half finished. Keppler and Westmore rushed to get him so as not to delay the filming of the episode. Bowman later criticised the make-up used on Rohner, describing it as sub-par. Westmore said that [...] "if I was working on a film, and had several months to test Clayton's make-up beforehand, <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> have turned out more to my liking. With less than a week to work with, I don't think it turned out too badly." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Larry David. Kenny Kramer claimed that there {{actually}} was a [...] "Contest" [...] in which David and some friends of his took part, {{although he did not}} initially want to take part because he thought he could not win it. David won the contest. When David came up with using the idea for an episode of Seinfeld, he did not talk about it with Seinfeld for a considerable time, because he thought the episode was impossible for him to pitch. However, Seinfeld thought it was not offensive. The original script was not revealed until the night before the cast read-through. The first version written by David was not as clean as the one later broadcast. The note from the censor claimed that David should not use the word [...] "Masturbate". Julia Louis-Dreyfus thought that the episode would never go ahead due to the subject matter. Seinfeld decided {{it would be better to}} remove any references to what George actually did. Seinfeld claimed that what was noteworthy about [...] "The Contest" [...] was the [...] "Dovetailing" [...] of the stories. He claimed that <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> have been possible to have used the word [...] "masturbation" [...] in the episode (it is notable that in [...] "The Ticket"—an earlier episode in the same season—George says [...] "you must have a good story otherwise it's just masturbation") although it would have probably ended up not being as funny. Part of the opening scene of the episode contains some of the script that was originally meant to be used in [...] "The Seinfeld Chronicles", the original pilot episode.|$|E

500|$|The fort was {{replaced}} by a fortlet, also built using turf and timber, in AD105. Although the fortlet was built on the same site as the fort, it did not use the same foundation trenches. There were two construction phases of the fortlet, the second [...] dating to c.120 [...] featured gates, an oven, a well, a granary, a hypocaust a workshop, barracks, a commanders house, a courtyard building, and possibly a latrine. The barracks were built to accommodate 48 soldiers and even with administrative staff and officers, the garrison of the fortlet would have numbered less than 100. The first phase was laid out along the same lines as the second phase. The fortlet defences [...] as with most other fortlets [...] were designed to withstand attacks from brigands or hold off an enemy until reinforcements from the main army could arrive rather than withstand a determined attack. A civilian settlement or vicus grew around the fortlet in the early 2nd century. <b>It</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> have been home to those who benefited from trade with the garrison or hangers on of the soldiers. Since it is unlikely that a garrison of under 100 could have supported a vicus, {{it has been suggested that}} the fortlet was a commissary fortlet, one which was the administrative and logistical centre of part of the Roman army. With soldiers regularly arriving to collect pay and orders, a vicus could have been supported. The fortlet fell out of use in the mid 120s. The fort and fortlet of Castleshaw were superseded by the neighbouring forts at Manchester and Slack. The vicus was abandoned around the same time as the fortlet fell out of use.|$|E

Goldstone's revised view concerned the intentional targeting of civilians, not other war crimes alleged in the report to have been committed by Israel. Such other crimes included causing civilian casualties by using a disproportionate level of force and attacks on buildings concerning which there was no indication they were legitimate military targets.|$|E
