The main finding is that almost 60 percent of the directives are transposed late, i. e. after the deadline specified by the directive. There hence exists an <b>implementation</b> <b>deficit</b> in the Netherlands. Various legal and political variables combine to explain the time needed for transposition, the most important of which are the legal instrument used, the responsible ministry and the EU decision-making procedure...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{focuses on}} a chosen public policy issue, {{as a part of}} {{cultural}} policy, namely on an implementation of a project of new building of National library of Czech Republic in Prague, arisen from an international architecture competition. This thesis has a form of a case study paper and investigates all relevant events and circumstances of the case, as well as interested stakeholders.

The aim of this thesis is to provide complex insight into the case, to find the point of <b>implementation</b> <b>deficit</b> in the process and to identify the values and hidden motivations of stakeholders. The thesis is divided into three chapters. In the first chapter, there is a summary of theoretical knowledge about public policy and implementation process and its analysis.

40|$|In post-authoritarian Spain (1975 - 1999), {{policies}} against {{violence against}} women (referred to hereafter as AVAW policies) have been similar to AVAW policies elaborated in other European Union (EU) member states in recent decades. [1] Such measures have mainly been of two types: legal reforms, in order to declare violent actions against women unlawful acts which are punishable; and social services for victims of violence, for instance, refuges for battered women. In Spain, AVAW policies have reached only partial achievements because of the <b>implementation</b> <b>deficit</b> which exists in this policy area. Measures are formulated but weakly implemented. In this paper, I identify an additional problem (of lesser importance than the <b>implementation</b> <b>deficit)</b> regarding Spanish AVAW policies.

To understand the behaviour of the organizations in relation to the output we use sociological institutionalism. In addition we use the outcome of domestic change to understand the scope and the depth of the Europeanization.

40|$|Within the {{political}} science literature {{that deals with}} the implementation process a central part has long been what is sometimes called the <b>implementation</b> <b>deficit.</b> This means {{that the effect of}} a policy decision doesn´t turn out as it was originally intended. The often used explanation is that the policy decisions moves through many levels during its implementation where different actors can change or alter the decision in various degrees. This phenomenon has gradually become more and more attended within the legislative process in the European Union and has been addressed in numerous studies. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine the implementation of The Habitats Directive, as its embodied in regulatory documents, in the Swedish multi-level system. To concretize this purpose, I´ve used two research questions; [1] How well has The Habitats Directive been implemented in the regulatory documents? and [2] Which deviations from the Directive are there? To answer these questions I conduct an analysis of ideas of the regulatory documents that constitute the written implementation of the Directive. I compare the degree of consensus in the multi-level system based on two dimensions of the Directive, the Conservation dimension and the Habitats/Species dimension. The result shows that the agreement between the EU Directive and the implementation of the Authority level is probably greater than that on the Parliamentary level. This contradicts the theory that the implementation of the multilevel system creates a cumulative <b>implementation</b> <b>deficit</b> and the result can be a contribution to further understanding and interpreting the practical implementation of the Directive...|$|E

This paper discusses three possible explanations of the disappointing growth performance: (i) an insufficient reformmindedness of developing country governments, (ii) counterproductive policy recipes of the Washington Consensus and (iii) more deeply rooted barriers to growth related to institutional deficiencies prevailing in various developing countries. The empirical evidence for Arab countries and other developing countries provides little support to the first two hypotheses. By contrast, institutional development is shown {{to have a significant}} impact on policy-related variables and the growth performance of developing countries. For Arab countries as a group, institutional development is more advanced than for the control group of other developing countries. Yet, serious institutional deficiencies tend to constrain future growth in several Arab countries.

The use of {{strategies}} to aid performance when undertaking neuropsychological tasks {{is dependent on}} intact fronto-striatal circuitry, and growing evidence suggests impaired spon-taneous use {{of strategies}} in patients with obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). However, studies to date have not {{examined the effects of}} strategy training on task performance in OCD or in trichotillomania (compulsive hair-pulling, a condition that has been argued to share overlap with OCD in terms of phenomenology and co-morbidity). Method. The ability to generate novel visuospatial sequences using a computer interface was examined before and after undertaking optimal strategy training in 20 OCD patients, 17 tricho-tillomania patients, and 20 controls (matched for age, education, and IQ). Results. OCD patients failed to improve ability to generate novel sequences above baseline despite successfully completing strategy training to the same extent as other groups. In contrast, perform-ance of trichotillomania patients improved significantly after training to the same extent as controls. Groups did not differ on memory span, trial-by-trial action monitoring, or ability to generate novel visuospatial sequences prior to strategy training. Conclusions.

The Yudhoyono administration, from 2004 to 2014, adopted a strong vision for promoting sustainable development that burnished its international image.

During these years, the state’s responses to non-state actor sustainability initiatives that emerged including modest involvement in RSPO, establishing ISPO but with limited authority under the Ministry of Agriculture, and witnessing the high-profile of pledge signing of IPOP in the Paris Climate Conference. In 2014, with the new government under President Widodo’s administration, there emerged an increasing reluctance to entertain foreign interference, promoting economic nationalism, and demanding greater international recognition (Aspinall 2016). However, the Widodo administration exhibited inconsistency with unpredictable responses and ad-hoc management (Warburton 2016). Under this administration, the confusing responses to IPOP occurred alongside a suspicion that it had become a vehicle of foreign interests. Such issues related to sovereignty might stimulate the Indonesian state’s strong reaction with could result in repressive approach (Pramudya et al., 2017 b) However, the humble approach of UNDP in establishing InPOP that has similar programmes with IPOP resulted in a positive response from the state.

40|$|Designing and {{implementing}} the Reduced Emissions from Avoided Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) depend on mutually interlinked actors, policies and socioeconomic factors across global, {{national and local}} levels. Unpacking the interaction between REDD+ design and implementation processes could holistically identify sources of institutional impediments to the programme’s effectiveness {{in the context of}} sustainable development. This thesis examines the process of designing REDD+ rules at the global level and the implementation of these rules at the national and local levels in Kenya. The study develops and applies an integrated institutions and development analytical framework (IDAF) within which iterative document analysis, quantitative vulnerability indexing, project inventories and interviews are applied to gather empirical evidence. Results reveal that multilevel institutional impediments face REDD+ design and implementation. At the global level, resource endowment determines actors’ ability to design and implement methodological, financial and safeguard design rules for REDD+. However, due to resource limitation and reliance on REDD+ funds, the input of African States into the technical and institutional REDD+ design is weak. This creates gaps in technical capacity and funding required for implementing the global rules at the national level. In Kenya, the national implementation relies on expertise and funds from multilateral intermediaries but this support plays into national institutional gaps e. g. path dependency and sectoral competition for funds to create <b>implementation</b> <b>deficits.</b> Efforts to avoid ‘institutional complexities’ in delivering carbon funds confine REDD+ activities within the State-based forestry sector but exclude key land use sectors such as lands and agriculture. This sectorial exclusion subdues cross-sectorial expertise required for REDD+ implementation but most importantly, fails to attend to underlying drivers of deforestation such as resettlement and agricultural mechanisation. Even though delivery of carbon and associated funds are emphasised at the global/national levels, local level implementation of the Kasigau project relies more on delivery of pro-poor livelihoods that keep the poor out of forests. Benefit sharing mechanism with regards to livelihoods is a key source of interplay between REDD+ design and on-ground implementation but this interplay is a source of certain institutional conflicts: first, the interplay complicates multilevel institutional arrangements for REDD+. For supporting local livelihood needs, the local community favourably perceives the private actor implementing the Kasigau project but negatively perceives State regimes that have historically monopolised local resource decisions and benefits. This raises concerns as to whether the State, as the legitimate representative of local communities’ interests in REDD+, can ably do so as expected by the UNFCCC. Second, the interplay elicits carbon-livelihood tension. Projects avoid investing/implementation within poor communities whose livelihood status could complicate delivery of carbon funds. Projects target relatively richer areas endowed with humid forest resources at 0. 728; p< 0. 01, land title deeds at 0. 552; p< 0. 01 and better access to water at 0. 475; p< 0. 01. This raises concerns about emission leakage when deforestation shifts to forests hosted in poorer communities. Carbon-livelihood tension also renders equitable and pro-poor strategies in REDD+ ineffective. Strict carbon standards limit trade-offs between pro-poor livelihoods and forest protection especially when fluctuating carbon prices constrain funds needed for project operations and local livelihoods. This study presents one of the first multilevel scientific analyses of REDD+ and contributes empirical evidence to literature on REDD+ governance. It reveals that the main sources of REDD+ <b>implementation</b> <b>deficits</b> emanate from the global and national institutional processes. As such, ensuring equity and rights in REDD+ implementation is necessary but not sufficient for effective REDD+ implementation unless national level institutions are reformed and global carbon conditions and pricing harmonised with local livelihood needs. ...|$|R
40|$|There are diverse {{lessons that}} {{subnational}} projects {{designed to reduce}} emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) should learn from integrated conservation and development projects (ICDPs) working in developing country settings. This paper develops and applies a lesson learning framework to identify and analyse lessons that the Kasigau REDD+ project learns from a governmental ICDP (national park) and a nongovernmental ICDP (World Vision) that have been implemented in Taita-Taveta county, Kenya. Fieldwork and document reviews revealed 24 lessons drawn from {{both positive and negative}} ICDP experiences. At the design level, the REDD+ project maintained the commonly critiqued top-down intervening approach as used by the ICDPs, by excluding community input into its globally-linked design. At the implementation level, the REDD+ project promoted better community representation in project decisions and benefit sharing when compared to the ICDPs. A landscape approach, democratic institutional choices and pro-poor benefit sharing were the key interventions that enabled the REDD+ project to improve on the ICDP experiences. The usefulness of the ICDP experiences was however weakened by a lack of lesson sharing between projects. The REDD+ project relied mainly on the local community to communicate their ICDP experiences, but this led to partial <b>implementation</b> <b>deficits</b> because it promoted local participation interests over global mitigation goals. Further, community-driven lesson learning appeared to disconnect the project from State institutions. The community had negative perceptions of State involvement {{but at the same time}} the State is the legal custodian of most assets (such as land) required for REDD+ implementation. ICDP lessons are therefore necessary for effective REDD+ implementation but can only be useful if the process of adopting lessons is cognisant of relevant stakeholders such as the State...|$|R
40|$|Emerging {{climate change}} regimes, {{such as the}} {{mechanism}} for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+), are increasingly aiming to engage developing countries {{such as those in}} Africa, in sustainable development through carbon markets. The contribution of African countries to global climate negotiations determines how compatible the negotiated rules could be with the existing socioeconomic and policy circumstances of African countries. The aim {{of this paper is to}} explore the agency of Africa (African States) in the global climate change negotiations and discuss possible implications for implementing these rules using REDD+ as a case study. Drawing on document analysis and semi-structured expert interviews, our findings suggest that although African countries are extensively involved in the implementation of REDD+ interventions, the continent has a weak agency on the design of the global REDD+ architecture. This weak agency results from a number of factors including the inability of African countries to send large and diverse delegations to the negotiations as well lack of capacity to generate and transmit research evidence to the global platform. African countries also perceive themselves as victims of climate change who should be eligible for support rather than sources of technological solutions. Again, Africa’s position is fragmented across negotiation coalitions which weakens the continent's collective influence on the REDD+ agenda. This paper discusses a number of <b>implementation</b> <b>deficits</b> which could result from this weak agency. These include concerns about implementation capacity and a potential lack of coherence between REDD+ rules and existing policies in African countries. These findings call for a rethink of pathways to enhancing Africa’s strategies in engaging in multilateral climate change negotiations, especially if climate change regimes specifically targeted at developing countries are to be effective...|$|R

This <b>implementation</b> <b>deficit</b> is a result of several factors: the vague, blurred professional image of community policing (in many cases also for community police officers themselves), its open and indefinite nature, the way this work is often embeddedwithin police organizations, the limited capacities, skills and expertise of community police officers and the increasing managerial emphasis in the Dutch police on so-called core business tasks. The international institutionalizationof community policing during roughly the past 25 years has been so successful that inmany countries this policemodel is now regarded as ‘the organizing paradigm ’ (Bayley and Shearing, 1996; Oliver and Bartgis, 1998) and ‘the most important development ’ in public polic-ing (Skogan and Roth, 2004). Despite its widespread popularity, this police concept has attracted much scepticism and criticism. Even in the late 1980 s, Klockars (1988) showed that an important value of community policing lies at a rhetorical level. This raises the question of its practical value, an issue that has turned up time and again since then. Despite its popularity, in many Western Euro-pean countries during the last 10 years or so, the position of community policing has become rather ambiguous. This is clearly noticeable in the Nether...|$|E
40|$|With over 280 {{environmental}} laws designed to regulate economic activities and tackle pollution problems, EU actors have established an impressive environmental policy. While policy-making has been impressive, implementation {{has often been}} disappointing {{with the result that}} EU environmental policy now suffers from an 'implementation deficit' whereby policy intentions on paper are not carried out properly 'on the ground'. Until recently, many EU actors and analysts have focused on the initial stages of the policy process, in particular the dynamics of bargaining between Member States. Yet, the overall effectiveness of EU environmental policies depends upon actors 'on the ground' and how they apply the policies in practice. This research moves away from the conventional state-centrist approach and focuses instead on the subnational regions and their role in the overall success of EU environmental policies. The research investigates Scotland and Bavaria and assesses to what extent the two regions shape EU environmental policy implementation. To help with the investigation, the research establishes a 'multi-layered implementation map' which best captures the policy 'filtering' process. The map helps identify formal and informal determinants within the layers which either facilitate or obstruct policy implementation. The research not only compares implementation performances between the Member States and between the regions, it also compares the regions vertically with their 'mother' states and thereby highlights implementation obstacles which would remain undetected with the state-centrist approach. A case study illustrates in detail the formal and practical implementation of the EIA Directive in Scotland and Bavaria. The study confirms that subnational regions feature determinants which differ in many respects from national determinants and influence the effectiveness of EU environmental policies. By highlighting subnational regions and their role in the process, the research contributes {{to a better understanding of}} the <b>implementation</b> <b>deficit</b> and presents a more refined picture of the EU environmental policy 'reality'...|$|E
40|$|Student Number : 0513068 K - MA {{research}} report - School of Graduate School - Faculty of HumanitiesThe {{aim of this}} study it to evaluate the Gauteng Government’s attempt to implement a life skills education programme in all primary and secondary schools. A chosen strategy of the National HIV/AIDS/STD Strategic Plan for South Africa: 2000 - 2005, a universal programme of life skills and HIV/AIDS education in primary and secondary schools was identified as a vital means to contain South Africa’s HIV/AIDS epidemic. Broadly, the life skills and HIV/AIDS education programme is intended to “promote improved health seeking behaviour and [the] adoption of safe sex practices” (DOH, 2000) amongst school going youth. Responsibility for the implementation of this programme in all primary and secondary schools is decentralised to the provincial level. Accordingly, this study seeks to analyse and evaluate the Gauteng Provincial Government’s (GPG) progress in the implementation of the life skills programme. A case study design centered upon documentary analysis and key informant interviews was employed in order to capture the necessary and predominantly qualitative data. These data are analyzed using the conceptual framework developed through the work of Hildebrand and Grindle (1994 in Brijal and Gilson, 1997), and Brijal and Gilson (1997). This study found that numerous <b>implementation</b> <b>deficits</b> arising at the organisational, task network, public sector institutional and external environmental levels combined to hamper implementation of the life skills programme according to the time frames set out within the National Integrated Plan for Children Infected and Affected by HIV/AIDS. Nevertheless, this study also found that political stability in Gauten gprovince was a significant factor promoting steady and progressive programme implementation and expansion. To conclude, this study indicates that policy implementation requires numerous complimentary factors (for instance, a strong level of local service delivery capacity) to be in place in order for public HIV/AIDS policy implementation to be achieved in an efficient and sustainable manner...|$|R
40|$|Zimbabwe''s {{failure to}} address {{continuing}} central bank quasi-fiscal losses has interfered with both monetary {{management and the}} independence and credibility of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ). Realized quasi-fiscal losses are estimated to have amounted to about 75 percent of GDP in 2006. Because they were financed by creating money creation or issuing RBZ securities, they contributed to the four-digit inflation reached in 2006. The remedy for the current situation is clearly to eliminate the causes of losses by implementing measures to improve the cash-flow of the bank and restore its financial position.

40|$|In the European Union, ‘principles of good governance’ {{have been}} instituted across several sectors in {{response}} to criticisms from environmentalists, business and the public, because of alleged inefficiency, inadequate policy <b>implementation,</b> democratic <b>deficit</b> and environmental crisis. In fisheries, the pursuit of good governance has gained extra significance {{because it has been}} posited as a means to eliminate many of the problems that characterise the sector, including the overexploitation of fish stocks, marine ecosystem degradation and fishing community vulnerability. This article explores good governance reforms put in place to deal with the North Sea fisheries crisis, with particular reference to the newly instated North Sea Regional Advisory Council. First, I describe the current state of North Sea fisheries and the problems associated with European fisheries management. I then show how these problems were dealt with in the European Union's pre-reformed Common Fisheries Policy. Finally, I explore the changes introduced in fisheries after the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy, and suggest that the good governance of fisheries may not represent the panacea that some policy-makers and theorists maintain it is...|$|R
