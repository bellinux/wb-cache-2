25|$|Pistol grips, butt {{stocks and}} <b>fore-ends</b> {{have been made}} {{available}} in stained walnut, or in recoil reducing composite materials. Different pistol <b>fore-ends</b> are required for the octagonal versus the round versus the bull barrels. The <b>fore-ends</b> have had an assortment of either one or two screw attachment points, used for attaching the <b>fore-ends</b> to the barrel with its matching one or two attachment points. Universally, the <b>fore-ends,</b> in addition to attaching to the barrel, cover the single hinge pin that connects the barrel to the receiver.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} Contender is {{now known}} as the generation one (G1) Contender and was replaced by the G2 Contender in 1998. The new design is dimensionally the same as the original Contender, but uses an Encore-style trigger group. Due to the changes in the trigger mechanism, and to differences in the angle of the grip relative to the boreline of the gun, the buttstocks and pistol grips are different between the G1 and G2 Contenders and will not interchange. The G2 uses essentially the same barrels and <b>fore-ends</b> as the original Contender and barrels will interchange, with the only two exceptions being the G2 muzzleloading barrels, which will only fit the G2 frame, and the Herrett barrels/fore-ends, which are specific for use only on a G1 frame.|$|E
2500|$|The {{attempt to}} sink three old cruisers, {{to block the}} flow of traffic {{in and out of}} the Port of Bruges-Zeebrugge failed. The failure of the attack on the Zeebrugge mole {{resulted}} in the Germans concentrating their fire on the three blocking ships, , [...] and , which were filled with concrete. Thetis did not make it to the canal entrance, after it hit an obstruction and was scuttled prematurely. The two other ships were sunk at the narrowest point of the canal. The submarines C1 under Lieut. A.C Newbold and C3 under Lieut. R.D. Sandford were old, each with a volunteer crew of one other officer and four ratings. They had five tons of amatol packed into their <b>fore-ends</b> and were to be driven into the viaduct and then blown up, to prevent reinforcement of the German garrison on the mole. The crews were to abandon their submarines shortly before the collision with the viaduct, leaving the submarines to steer themselves automatically. During the passage from Dover, C1 parted with its tow and arrived too late to take part in the operation. Sandford, commanding C3, elected to steer his ship into the viaduct manually instead of depending on the automatic system.|$|E
50|$|The Condor Outback {{model has}} 20-inch barrels. It has rifle style sights, with a fixed blade front sight and a notched rear sight. It is {{chambered}} in 12-gauge or 20-gauge. It has been manufactured with two different finishes - walnut stock and <b>fore-end</b> with blued metal, and black hardwood stock and <b>fore-end</b> with nickel-plated metal.|$|R

50|$|The Mk 11 Mod 0 {{utilizes}} an Obermeyer 20 in match target barrel, {{along with}} a RAS (Rail Accessory System) <b>fore-end</b> made by KAC, consisting of an 11.35 in long match <b>fore-end.</b> The RAS allows for quick attachment/detachment of MIL-STD-1913 components. The aluminum <b>fore-end</b> makes no contact with the barrel forward of the receiver, allowing for extreme accuracy. The Mk 11 Mod 0 has an empty weight of 15.3 lb, and an overall length of 45.4 in. The civilian version, using the longer 24 in match barrel, is guaranteed to produce groupings of less than 1 in at 100 yd, or 0.3 angular mil, using factory match loads.|$|R
60|$|Immediately before her, {{in strange}} {{contrast}} to this lifeless landscape, lay the peopled mere, fringed around with dead reeds standing so {{still in the}} frosty air {{that they might have}} been painted things. On this mere half the population of Leyden seemed to be gathered; at least there were thousands of them, shouting, laughing, and skimming to and fro in their bright garments like flocks of gay-plumaged birds. Among them, drawn by horses with bells tied to their harness, glided many sledges of wickerwork and wood mounted upon iron runners, their <b>fore-ends</b> fashioned to quaint shapes, such as the heads of dogs or bulls, or Tritons. Then there were vendors of cakes and sweetmeats, vendors of spirits also, who did a good trade on this cold day. Beggars too were numerous, and among them deformities, who, nowadays, would be hidden in charitable homes, slid about in wooden boxes, which they pushed along with crutches. Lastly many loafers had gathered there with stools for fine ladies to sit on while the skates were bound to their pretty feet, and chapmen with these articles for sale and straps wherewith to fasten them. To complete the picture the huge red ball of the sun was sinking to the west, and opposite to it the pale full moon began already to gather light and life.|$|E
60|$|CRASH! It smashed with {{an immense}} report. It had fallen among the {{grounded}} Asiatic aeroplanes that lay among the turf and flower-beds near the river. They flew in scraps and fragments, turf, trees, and gravel leapt and fell; the aeronauts still lying along the canal bank were thrown about like sacks, catspaws flew across the foaming water. All {{the windows of}} the hotel hospital that had been shiningly reflecting blue sky and airships the moment before became vast black stars. Bang!--a second followed. Bert looked up and was filled with a sense of a number of monstrous bodies swooping down, coming down on the whole affair like a flight of bellying blankets, like a string of vast dish-covers. The central tangle of the battle above was circling down as if to come into touch with the power-house fight. He got a new effect of airships altogether, as vast things coming down upon him, growing swiftly larger and larger and more overwhelming, until the houses over the way seemed small, the American rapids narrow, the bridge flimsy, the combatants infinitesimal. As they came down they became audible as a complex of shootings and vast creakings and groanings and beatings and throbbings and shouts and shots. The fore-shortened black eagles at the <b>fore-ends</b> of the Germans had an effect of actual combat of flying feathers.|$|E

50|$|The SPR100 Sporting {{model has}} a {{nickel-plated}} receiver, walnut stock and <b>fore-end,</b> and screw-in choke tubes. The barrel is ported to reduce felt recoil.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fore-ends</b> tend to vary both in thickness, {{from the}} {{splinter}} <b>fore-ends</b> common on British side-by-side shotguns to the wide, flat bottomed beavertail <b>fore-ends</b> found on benchrest shooting guns, and in length, from the short AK-47 style {{to the long}} Mannlicher stock that runs {{all the way to}} the muzzle. Most common on sporting firearms is the half-stock, which extends roughly half the length of the barrel.|$|E
50|$|The {{top part}} of the fitted hammer forged barrels (until c. 1975) from Lyttleton, were encased by a handgueard, while M&S 1/3 MOA rear sights were installed. Parker Hale 1/4 MOA rear sights were {{available}} as an option. Stocks were made of unimpressive, but dense and strong beech wood. The handguard is absent from later models, which had significantly bulkier <b>fore-ends</b> to allow for an open barrel with effective cooling while still reducing potential fliers due to contact between the free floated barrel and the shooter's fingers. Accurate Musgrave-manufactured button rifled barrels (with a slightly longer, parallel nox) were usually matched with these stocks.|$|E
5000|$|Pump-action {{shotguns}}, {{also called}} [...] "slide-action repeating shotguns" [...] or [...] "slide-action shotguns" [...] are {{a class of}} shotguns that are distinguished {{in the way in}} which spent shells are extracted and fresh ones are chambered. The weapon has a single barrel above a tube magazine into which shells are inserted. New shells are chambered by pulling a pump handle (often called the forend) attached to the tube magazine toward the user, then pushing it back into place to chamber the cartridge (in a few cases this action is reversed). <b>Fore-ends</b> are replaceable, and modern ones may include a pistol grip for a more secure hold, picatinny rails, or a tactical light.|$|E
50|$|An {{upgraded}} {{version of the}} SPR100 has a nickel-plated receiver, walnut stock and <b>fore-end,</b> and screw-in choke tubes. This variant is a 12 gauge with a -inch barrel.|$|R

50|$|The {{most basic}} {{breakdown}} of stock types is into one-piece and two piece stocks. A one piece stock {{is a single}} unit from butt to <b>fore-end,</b> such as that commonly found on bolt action rifles. Two piece stocks use a separate piece for the butt and <b>fore-end,</b> such as that commonly found on break open shotguns, and lever-action rifles and shotguns. Traditionally, two piece stocks were easier to make, since finding a wood blank suitable for a long one piece stock is harder than finding short blanks for a two piece stock.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} Contender, {{now known}} as the generation one (G1) Contender, was replaced by the G2 Contender soon after the Encore came out. The G2 Contender is essentially dimensionally the same as the original Contender, but uses an Encore style trigger group. Due to the changes in the trigger mechanism, and to differences in the angle of the grip relative to the boreline of the gun, the buttstocks and pistol grips are different between the G1 and G2 Contenders and will not interchange.

60|$|Its {{detached}} <b>fore-end</b> remained jammed {{against that}} little island, Green Island {{it used to}} be called, which forms the stepping-stone between the mainland and Goat Island's patch of trees.|$|R
50|$|The {{surface of}} the barrel, receiver, and {{synthetic}} <b>fore-end</b> has a tire-tread pattern to make a non-slip surface. It also gives the gun a unique look, which is often criticized.|$|R
50|$|VARMINT-LAMINATEDThe same rifle as the VARMINT {{model with}} a more weather {{resistant}} laminated wooden stock with reduced drop at the heel, Monte Carlo style cheekpiece and with a strengthened <b>fore-end.</b>|$|R
50|$|There are {{two models}} of Gold Label. One has an American style pistol grip stock. The other has an English style {{straight}} grip stock. Both models have a splinter style <b>fore-end.</b>|$|R
50|$|When {{installed}}, barrels {{are often}} free-floated: i.e., installed {{so that the}} barrel contacts {{the rest of the}} rifle only at the receiver, to minimise the effects on impact point of pressure on the <b>fore-end</b> by slings, bipods, or the sniper's hands. The end of the barrel is usually crowned or machined to form a rebated area around the muzzle proper to avoid asymmetry or damage, and consequent inaccuracy. Alternatively, some rifles, such as the Dragunov or Walther WA2000, provide structures at the <b>fore-end</b> to provide tension on the barrel in order to counteract barrel drop and other alterations in barrel shape.|$|R
5000|$|The Gold Label has a {{stainless}} steel receiver and blued barrels. The stock and <b>fore-end</b> are made of AAA-grade American walnut. [...] At 6½ pounds, the Gold Label is relatively lightweight for a double barreled shotgun.|$|R
25|$|The {{most unusual}} {{feature of the}} Contender is how the barrel is {{attached}} to the frame. By removing the <b>fore-end,</b> a large hinge pin is exposed; by pushing this hinge pin out, the barrel can be removed. Since the sights and extractor remain attached to the barrel in the Contender design, the frame itself contains no cartridge-specific features. A barrel of another caliber or length can be installed and pinned in place, the <b>fore-end</b> replaced, and the pistol is ready to shoot with a different barrel and pre-aligned sights. This allowed easy changes of calibers, sights, and barrel lengths, with only a flat screwdriver being required for this change.|$|R
50|$|Coach Gun Supreme - The Coach Gun Supreme has {{screw-in}} choke tubes, and {{is equipped}} with a recoil pad. It features an AA-grade walnut stock and <b>fore-end.</b> Different versions have blued, nickel-plated, stainless steel receivers and barrels.|$|R
50|$|The Enfield Envoy {{was similar}} to the L39A1, but was {{produced}} with a higher standard of external finish for sale on the civilian market. It had a <b>fore-end</b> of broader cross section and a sporter style butt.|$|R
50|$|The Benelli Argo EL's {{receiver}} is finely engraved and gilded with {{scenes of}} wild animals. The craftsmanship {{is of the}} master engravers of the Cesare Giovanelli studio. The stock and <b>fore-end</b> are in walnut with a fine oil finish.|$|R
50|$|A maul is a long-handled hammer with a {{heavy metal}} head, either of lead or iron. Similar in {{appearance}} and function to a modern sledgehammer, it is sometimes shown as having a spear-like spike on the <b>fore-end</b> of the haft.|$|R
5000|$|The {{standard}} model SPR100 has a blued receiver, hardwood stock and <b>fore-end,</b> and a fixed choke. It is chambered in 12 gauge with a 28-inch barrel, or in 20 gauge or [...]410 bore with a 26-inch barrel. It weighs [...] pounds.|$|R
60|$|The man stooped {{over the}} case; handed barrels, stock, and <b>fore-end</b> to Strickland, who fitted all together, yawning dolefully. Then {{he reached down}} to the gun-case, took a solid-drawn cartridge, and slipped it into the breech of the '360 Express.|$|R
50|$|The Model 14's design {{incorporated}} several innovative concepts. Among {{them was}} a spiral magazine tube to prevent bullet tips from contacting the primer of the cartridge in front of them. This magazine moved with the <b>fore-end</b> when pumping the action. Loading was through {{an opening in the}} magazine itself located between the <b>fore-end</b> and the receiver. The bolt unlocked via a button pressed through the ejection port though firing the gun automatically unlocked the bolt. The Model 14 was a takedown rifle that featured a single knurled screw {{on the left side of}} the receiver that was withdrawn allowing the trigger group and buttstock to be removed from the bottom of the gun.|$|R
50|$|The REC7 uses a short-stroke gas piston {{designed}} by Barrett. It rides above the barrel and is housed inside the <b>fore-end.</b> The spring-loaded piston is a one-piece 17-4 stainless steel rod. The forward and rearward {{movement of the}} piston is approximately one inch.|$|R
