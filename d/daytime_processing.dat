40|$|The correct {{functioning}} of Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) hinges on effective temporal coordination of the metabolic processes that determine the {{supply and demand}} for carbon over the day/night CAM cycle. In general, light is considered a crucial input factor in sustaining the circadian rhythms of CO 2 uptake and release in CAM plants, probably by triggering different light sensitive sensors such as the red/far red absorbing phytochromes and the blue/UV-A absorbing cryptochromes. Moreover, light is considered essential for the <b>daytime</b> <b>processing</b> of nocturnally accumulated malic acid, as plants in continuous darkness maintain high levels of malic acid for several days. However, the interplay of the different components of the light spectrum (i. e. different wavelengths of light) with the key components of CAM, i. e. stomatal aperture, gas exchange, malic acid processing and carbohydrate partitioning is largely unknown. A 24 h experiment was conducted with the CAM plant Aechmea ‘Maya’ under an 18 h photoperiod but with 4 different wavelengths illuminated by LED, i. e. 470 (blue), 530 (green), 630 (orange - red) and 660 (red) nm administered at 10 µmol m- 2 s- 1. Control treatments consisted of an 18 h photoperiod under white light (100 µmol m- 2 s- 1) and continuous dark for 24 h. For each regime, gas exchange was monitored by IRGA and leaf samples were taken every 4 hours for the determination of organic acids, sugars and starch. The data was complemented with activity measurements in vitro of the key CAM enzymes PEPC and PEPCK, along with measurements of protein and transcript abundance of both enzymes over the diel cycle. By integrating measurements of the key components of CAM at the molecular, biochemical and physiological levels, a picture emerges of the complex interplay between light quality and the {{functioning of}} this photosynthetic specialization. status: publishe...|$|E

However, Zenker has its own technical and safety disadvantages and we note that, in contrast to the findings of Gala et al, successful immunostaining of Bouin fixed material for L 26 has previously been noted 3 and we get consistent, strong immunostaining for L 26. We have fixed mar-row biopsies in Bouin fluid for many years because of its excellent morphology in haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and for its ease of use. (Following three to six hours of fixation in Bouin, biopsies are decal-cified overnight in 10 % formic acid. A short <b>daytime</b> <b>processing</b> cycle allows H&E sec-tions to be reviewed late on the day following biopsy.) For immunohistochemistry we use antigen retrieval in antigen unmasking solu-tion (Vector Laboratories) with pressure cooking for two minutes before applying L 26 (Dako) followed by the avidin-biotin complex (ABC) technique. In addition to staining B cells, we note that L 26 may give weak to moderate staining of megakaryocytes, a find-ing we have also seen with B 5 fixed material. Nucleolar staining, described in epithelial and other cells types 4 and regarded as non-specific, may be seen in some marrow blast cells. Figure 1 shows L 26 staining of an infiltrate of hairy cell leukaemia in a Bouin fixed marrow biopsy. Gala et al indicate that there is limited information on the range of antibodies which stain in Bouin fixed marrow 1 so we have reviewed all the immu-nostains on our bone marrow biopsies for the past year. In addition to the antibodies described by Gala we have found successful staining for L 26, leucocyte common anti...|$|E
40|$|The neuroendocrine {{substance}} melatonin is {{a hormone}} synthesized rhythmically by the pineal gland {{under the influence}} of the circadian system and alternating light/dark cycles. Melatonin has been shown to have broad applications, and consequently becoming a molecule of great controversy. Undoubtedly, however, melatonin plays an important role as a time cue for the endogenous circadian system. This review focuses on melatonin as a regulator in the circadian modulation of memory processing. Memory processes (acquisition, consolidation and retrieval) are modulated by the circadian system. However, the mechanism by which the biological clock is rhythmically influencing cognitive processes remains unknown. We also discuss, how the circadian system by generating cycling melatonin levels can implant information about <b>daytime</b> into memory <b>processing,</b> depicted as day and nighttime differences in acquisition, memory consolidation and/or retrieval...|$|R
40|$|Carboxylic acids are {{ubiquitous}} in atmospheric particles, and they {{play an important}} role in the physical and chemical properties of aerosol particles. During measurements in coastal California in the summer of 2009, carboxylic acid functional groups were highly associated with trajectories from an industrial region with high organic mass (OM), likely from fossil fuel combustion emissions. The concentration of carboxylic acid groups peaked during daytime, suggesting a photochemical secondary formation mechanism. This daytime increase in concentration was tightly correlated with O 3 mixing ratio, indicating O 3 was the likely driver in acid formation. Based on the diurnal cycles of carboxylic acid and alkane groups, the covariation of carboxylic acid groups with O 3 , and the composition of the Combustion factor resulted from the factor analyses, gas-phase alkane oxidation by OH radicals to form dihyfrofuran followed by further oxidation of dihydrofuran by O 3 is the likely acid formation mechanism. Using the multi-day average of the daytime increase of carboxylic acid group concentrations and m/z 44 -based Aged Combustion factor, we estimated the lower-bound contributions of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formed in 12 -h <b>daytime</b> of <b>processing</b> in a single day to be 30 % of the carboxylic acid groups and 25 – 45 % of the Combustion factor concentration. These unique ambient observations of photochemically-driven acid formation suggest that gas-phase alkanes might be important sources of SOA formation in this coastal region...|$|R
40|$|Modelling {{studies were}} {{performed}} with the multiphase mechanism RACM- MIM 2 ext/CAPRAM 3. 0 i to investigate the tropospheric multiphase chemistry in deli- quesced particles and non-precipitating clouds using the SPACCIM model framework. Simulations using a non-permanent cloud scenario were carried out for two different environmental conditions focusing on the multiphase chemistry of oxidants and other linked chemical subsystems. Model results were analysed by time-resolved reaction flux analyses allowing advanced interpretations. The model shows significant effects of multiphase chemical interactions on the tropospheric budget of gas-phase oxidants and organic com- pounds. In-cloud gas-phase OH radical concentration reductions of about 90 % and 75 % were modelled for urban and remote conditions, respectively. The reduced in-cloud gas- phase oxidation budget increases the tropospheric residence time of organic trace gases by up to about 30 %. Aqueous-phase oxidations of methylglyoxal and 1, 4 -butenedial were identified as important OH radical sinks under polluted conditions. The model revealed that the organic C 3 and C 4 chemistry contributes with about 38 %/ 48 % and 8 %/ 9 % consid- erably to the urban and remote cloud / aqueous particle OH sinks. Furthermore, the simulations clearly implicate the potential role of deliquescent particles to operate as a reactive chemical medium due to an efficient TMI/HOx,y chemical processing including e. g. an effective in-situ formation of OH radicals. Considerable chemical differences be- tween deliquescent particles and cloud droplets, e. g. a circa 2 times more efficient <b>daytime</b> iron <b>processing</b> in the urban deliquescent particles, were identified. The in-cloud oxidation of methylglyoxal and its oxidation products is identified as efficient sink for NO 3 radicals in the aqueous phase...|$|R
