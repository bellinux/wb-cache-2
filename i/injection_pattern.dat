In order to fully exploit {{the potential of the}} abovementioned fuel <b>injection</b> <b>pattern</b> optimization, numerical simulation can play a fundamental role by allowing the creation of a kind of a virtual injection rate generator for the assessment of the corresponding engine outputs in terms of combustion characteristics such as burn rate, emission formation and combustion noise (CN). This paper is focused on the analysis of the effects of digitalization of pilot events in the <b>injection</b> <b>pattern</b> on Brake Specific Fuel Consumption (BSFC), CN and emissions for a EURO 6 passenger car 4 -cylinder diesel engine. The numerical evaluation was performed considering steady-state conditions for 3 key points representative of typical operating conditions in the low-medium load range. The optimization process was carried out through numerical simulation, by means of a suitable target function aiming to minimize BSFC and CN while not exceeding the target NOx emissions level. By means of a previously developed fuel injection system model, possible different injection patterns with high number of pilot injections were evaluated thus obtaining a kind of virtual injection rate generator, the outcomes of which were then used as input for a DIPulse combustion model in order to predict BSFC, combustion noise and emissions.

This ESS should help managing the PV plant to inject electricity into the grid according to the requirements of the grid System Operator. It is desired to obtain a final production not below 1300 kWh/kWp with a maximum ESS budget of 0. 9 €/Wp. The PV plant will be sited in Martinique Island and connected to the main grid. This grid is a small one where the perturbations due clouds in the PV generation are not negligible anymore. A software simulation tool, incorporating a model for the PV-plant production, the ESS and the required <b>injection</b> <b>pattern</b> of electricity into the grid has been developed in MS Excel. This tool has been used to optimize the relevant parameters defining the ESS so that the feed-in of electricity into the grid can be controlled to fulfill the conditions given by the System Operator. The inputs used for this simulation tool are, besides the conditions given by the System Operator on the allowed <b>injection</b> <b>pattern,</b> the production data from a similar PV-plant in a close-by location, and variables for defining the ESS.

40|$|In {{the last}} years, {{emissions}} standards for internal combustion engines {{are becoming more}} and more restrictive, particularly for NOx and soot emissions from Diesel engines. In order to comply with these requirements, OEMs have to face with innovative combustion concepts and/or sophisticate after-treatment devices. In both cases, the role of the Engine Management System (EMS) is increasingly essential, following the large number of actuators and sensors introduced and the need to meet customer expectations on performance and comfort. On the other hand, the large number of control variables to be tuned imposes a massive recourse to the experimental testing which is poorly sustainable in terms of time and money. In order to reduce the experimental effort and the time to market, the application of simulation models for EMS calibration has become fundamental. Predictive models, validated against a limited amount of experimental data, allow performing detailed analysis on the influence of engine control variables on pollutants, comfort and performance. 				In this paper, a simulation analysis on the impact of <b>injection</b> <b>pattern</b> and Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) rate on fuel consumption, combustion noise, NO and soot emissions is presented for an automotive Common-Rail Diesel engine.

Based on this engine, {{a research project}} in collaboration between Kohler Engines, Ricardo, Denso and Politecnico di Torino was carried out to exploit the potential of new technologies to meet the Stage IV and beyond emission standards. The prototype engine was equipped with a low pressure cooled EGR system, two stage turbocharger, high pressure fuel injection system capable of very high injection pressure and DOC+DPF aftertreatment system. Since the Stage IV emission standard sets a 0. 4 g/kWh NOx limit for the steady state test cycle (NRSC), that includes full load operating conditions, the engine must be operated with very high EGR rates (above 30 %) at very high load.

Separation of concerns, {{which allows}} {{programming}} the nun-functional aspects of an application {{in a more}} or less orthogonal manner from the functional code, is becoming a general trend in software development. The most widely used architectural pattern for implementing aspects involves indirection objects, raising a performance overhead at execution time. Thus, it appears as being an attractive challenge to be able to inject the code of aspects within the business components of an application in order to avoid indirection objects. With regard to two aspects (replication and protection), this paper replies to the following question: being given the code of an aspect as with an indirection-based implementation, is it possible to use a generic (aspect-independent) tool which would automatically inject this code within the application components? The results show that this injection process is feasible and can be automated through the handling of a specific <b>injection</b> <b>pattern.</b> ...|$|E
