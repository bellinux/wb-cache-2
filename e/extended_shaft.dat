25|$|Further {{development}} work {{was required to}} enable the mine to be worked systematically and the Rogers' Golden Gate produced 3,295 tons of quartz yielding 3,947 ounces of gold in 1900. The mine was worked with two stem engines of eight and ten horsepower, two sets of double winding gear, one steam pump, and one whip, valued at £850. In 1902 additional plant was erected including three steam engines {{with a total of}} 51 horsepower, one single and two sets of double winding gear. The straight shaft was done to 510 feet and the underlie of the <b>extended</b> <b>shaft</b> down to 531 feet. The mine kept 15 head of stamps at the Golden Gate mill constantly employed. The mine was partly tributed in 1904 with the tributers doing well. In 1906 Rogers' Golden Gate was the Golden Gate line's largest producer - 2,000 tons for 10,527 ounces by the tributers.|$|E
50|$|In 1947 Percy Kean Jnr. {{commissioned}} a mining engineer, Archibald Woodville Wilson {{to report on}} the prospects for King's freehold and M.L. 363 which included the Great <b>Extended</b> <b>shaft.</b> Wilson reported that the Great <b>Extended</b> <b>shaft</b> had definitely proved a large lode formation with 180m to 206m vertical depth, from 1.5m to 3.6m in width with phenomenally high metal values at 198m depth. Kean decided to go ahead with development and purchased the mining plant at the Louisa mine, near Maytown, on the Palmer River goldfields. By 1949 he had erected the steel headframe, recollared the shaft and installed the Vickers generator and a 220 h.p. MAN diesel engine from the Louisa, and a new winding engine. However attempts to dewater the mine were unsuccessful so he pumped out the nearby King's mine.|$|E
50|$|In 1924 Percy Kean Snr. {{acquired}} King's freehold and commenced dewatering King's shaft but {{the task}} proved {{too much for}} their machinery and finances. After World War 2, King's freehold and M.L.363, which included the neighbouring Great <b>Extended</b> <b>Shaft,</b> were taken over by Percy Kean Jnr., who decided to recommence operations. However water inflow was again a problem and Kean decided to pump out King's shaft. In 1951 Kean raised 50 tons of galena from King's mine and rather than re-equip King's mill he had his ore processed at Partridge's mill on Elphinstone Creek. However, with falling prices, Kean decided in 1953 to abandon both mines.|$|E

5000|$|One {{problem with}} scaling up any piston engine design is that {{eventually}} a point is reached where the crankshaft becomes a major engineering challenge. This {{was a problem}} that affected almost all engines of the [...] class, including BMW's own 18-cylinder BMW 802 project. For the 803 the engineers decided to avoid this problem by simply not using a common crankshaft, and driving a set of independent contra-rotating propellers. The front engine drove the front propeller directly, while the rear engine drove a number of smaller shafts that passed between the cylinders of the front engine before being geared back together to drive the rear prop. This layout resulted in a rather large gearbox {{on the front of}} the engine, and the front engine needing an <b>extended</b> <b>shaft</b> to [...] "clear" [...] the gearbox.|$|E

50|$|Gyratory {{equipment}} is divided to a {{top and a}} bottom unit. The unit on top consists of screening frames supported with rugged springs attached to the circular base, which allows free vibration of the top unit. Secondary support springs are attached to for heavy duty operation, preventing the vibration of the top unit from reaching the floor. The base of the machine (bottom unit) consists of top and bottom eccentric weights attached to a heavy duty motor. Minimum energy is consumed with the installation of double <b>extended</b> <b>shafts</b> on the motors, which are attached to both {{the top and bottom}} eccentric weights. Screen decks can be mounted on top of another within the machine assembly with spacing frames connected together via stainless steel quick release clamps.|$|R
40|$|Background: Transradial access {{reduces the}} {{incidence}} of access site complications of percutaneous revascularization procedures. However, in patients with peripheral vascular disease, the adoption of transradial approach for superficial femoral artery (SFA) angioplasty is usually prevented by {{the distance between the}} vascular access and the target lesions, thus SFA angioplasty is commonly performed by transfemoral approach. Recently, low-profile balloons with <b>extended</b> <b>shaft</b> length became available allowing to potentially address SFA lesions by transradial approach. As plain balloon angioplasty represents a valuable option for SFA in-stent restenosis treatment, we evaluated the feasibility of transradial approach in this clinical setting. Methods: Transradial balloon angioplasty of SFA diffuse in-stent restenosis was attempted in 12 patients aged 69. 4 + 5. 1 years. Six-French 125 cm long MP guiding catheters, 300 cm long 0. 018 guidewire and low-profile 4 Fr compatible 180 cm long shaft balloons (5 and 6 mm in diameter and 80 to 150 mm in length) were used.

40|$|Using single {{particle}} electron cryomicroscopy {{that does}} not impose icosahedral averaging, we determined {{the structure of the}} entire infectious Salmonella phage Epsilon 15 1, including both icosahedral and non-icosahedral components. At least three layers of condensed viral DNA were observed to pack in coaxial coils with local 25 Å hexagonal inter-strand spacing. At one of the fivefold vertices, a portal complex with twelve subunits replaces a capsid pentamer. A tail hub with six projecting trimeric tailspikes sits on the external face of the portal. Below the portal is a cylindrical protein core. An <b>extended</b> <b>shaft</b> of density fills the central channel of the protein core and the portal complex and appears to consist of about 90 nucleotides at the terminus of the packaged DNA poised for injection. Using an icosahedral symmetry imposed reconstruction, the fold of the capsid shell protein is seen to resemble the capsid protein fold of other tailed double-stranded DNA phages 2 – 5 and human herpesvirus 6. These common structural features suggest a common evolutionary origin among these viruses. Double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) phages are vectors for gene transfer among enteric bacteria, including important human pathogens 7. For all the well-studied tailed dsDNA phages,...|$|E

5000|$|The ZPN-1 was {{followed}} by an order for four improved N-class blimps that were delivered in 1954. These airships were designated ZP2N, and re-designated in 1954 as the ZPG-2. Three of the ZP2N airships were modified for an airborne early warning mission in the mid-1950s and were designated, originally, ZP2N-1W but at delivery were designated ZPG-2W.
