5|$|Greys Anatomy has {{received}} high viewership and ratings since its debut. The first four seasons {{of the program}} each {{ranked in the top}} ten among all viewers, reaching its peak Nielsen ratings in the second season, attracting an average of 19.44 million viewers per episode, and ranking at fifth place overall. Following the show's time-slot being relocated, overall rankings steadily declined, dropping below the top ten in its fifth season. Grey's Anatomy made its greatest fall from its sixth to seventh season, slipping from seventeenth place to thirty-first. The series is on a steady decline in terms of overall viewership and rankings, yet Grey's Anatomy still holds value in charts when numbers are pulled from the <b>digital</b> <b>video</b> <b>recorder</b> (DVR). It was the most recorded show between 2007 and 2011, based on cumulative totals, and has been for several years in a row.|$|E
5|$|The first {{handheld}} {{game console}} in the PlayStation series, the PlayStation Portable or PSP, sold {{a total of}} 80 million units worldwide by November 2013. Its successor, the PlayStation Vita, which launched in Japan on December 17, 2011 and in most other major territories in February 2012, had sold over 4 million units by January 2013. PlayStation TV is a microconsole and a non-portable variant of the PlayStation Vita handheld game console. Other hardware released {{as part of the}} PlayStation series includes the PSX, a <b>digital</b> <b>video</b> <b>recorder</b> which was integrated with the PlayStation and PlayStation 2, though it was short lived due to its high price and was never released outside Japan, as well as a Sony Bravia television set which has an integrated PlayStation 2. The main series of controllers utilized by the PlayStation series is the DualShock, which is a line of vibration-feedback gamepad having sold 28 million controllers as of June 28, 2008.|$|E
5|$|On December 29, 2006, Nielsen Media Research (NMR) {{reported}} {{the results of}} having, for the first time, monitored viewers who use a <b>digital</b> <b>video</b> <b>recorder</b> to record shows for later viewing. NMR reported that 30 Rock adds nearly 7.5% to its total audience every week {{as a result of}} viewers who use a DVR to record the show and then watch it within a week of its initial airing. A March 2007 report from MAGNA Global, based on NMR data about viewership ranked by among adults 25–54, shows that as of the time of the report 30 Rocks viewers have a median income of $65,000, high enough to place the show tied at 11th in affluence with several other shows. This is during a period where for the season 30 Rock is tied at number 85 in the 18–49 demographic. During its second season, 30 Rock ranked in fourth place, against all primetime programming, for television series which are watched by viewers with income above $100,000. Following Fey's popular impressions of Alaskan governor Sarah Palin on Saturday Night Live, the third-season premiere was seen by 8.5million viewers, making it the highest-viewed episode in the series. The premiere earned a 4.1 preliminary adults 18–49 rating, an increase of 21% from the second-season premiere.|$|E

The legislation would grant the Federal Communications Commission the authority to authorize a technology known as the broadcast flag.

25|$|DTTV is {{received}} either via a digital set-top box (STB), TV gateway or integrated tuner included with television sets, that decodes the signal received via a standard television antenna. Some set-top-boxes and TV gateways include <b>digital</b> <b>video</b> <b>recorder</b> (DVR) functionality. However, due to frequency planning issues, an aerial capable of receiving a different channel group (usually a wideband) {{may be required}} if the DTTV multiplexes lie outside the reception capabilities of the originally installed aerial. This is quite common in the UK; see external links.|$|E
25|$|The {{first episode}} of Broadchurch series one {{was seen by}} an average of 9.1 million viewers (31 percent {{audience}} share). This included 6.15 million live viewers (25.2 percent audience share), with another 716,000 viewers (4.4 percent) on time-delayed viewing via <b>digital</b> <b>video</b> <b>recorder,</b> timeshifted channels (+1), and similar media and technologies. It won its time-slot beating Mayday and Embarrassing Bodies. This was the best premiere episode of a weekday new drama series in the United Kingdom since ITV's Whitechapel debuted in January 2009. Only two other dramas, Life Begins (2002) and Doc Martin (2004), debuted with higher numbers since 2002.|$|E
25|$|Virgin TV branded its {{original}} high-definition (HD) <b>Digital</b> <b>Video</b> <b>Recorder</b> (PVR) service as V+. The service uses a PVR set-top box, with three tuners and a 160GB hard disk {{for up to}} 80 hours' recording. The presence of three tuners means that V+ can record two channels {{at the same time}} while viewers watch a third. This contrasts with most other PVR systems such as Sky+, which supports only two tuners. In December 2010 a 1TB TiVo HD PVR from Cisco was released, with a 500GB model released in May 2011. From late 2011, Samsung Electronics will join Cisco as a second supplier of TiVo STBs for Virgin Media.|$|E

5000|$|Some <b>digital</b> <b>video</b> <b>recorders</b> can now {{record to}} solid state flash memory cards (called flash camcorders). They {{generally}} use Secure Digital cards, can include wireless connections (Bluetooth and Wi-Fi), and can play SWF files. There are some <b>digital</b> <b>video</b> <b>recorders</b> that combine <b>video</b> and graphics {{in real time}} to the flash card, called DTE or [...] "direct to edit". These are used to speed-up the editing workflow in video and television production, since linear videotapes do not then need {{to be transferred to}} the edit workstation (see Non-linear editing system).|$|R
25|$|By {{the early}} 2000s, {{the number of}} {{consumer}} electronic devices in most homes greatly increased, along {{with the number of}} remotes to control those devices. According to the Consumer Electronics Association, an average US home has four remotes. To operate a home theater as many as five or six remotes may be required, including one for cable or satellite receiver, VCR or <b>digital</b> <b>video</b> <b>recorder</b> (DVR/PVR), DVD player, TV and audio amplifier. Several of these remotes may need to be used sequentially for some programs or services to work properly. However, as there are no accepted interface guidelines, the process is increasingly cumbersome. One solution used {{to reduce the number of}} remotes that have to be used is the universal remote, a remote control which is programmed with the operation codes for most major brands of TVs, DVD players, etc. In the early 2010s, many smartphone manufacturers began incorporating infrared emitters into their devices, thereby enabling their use as universal remotes via an included or downloadable app.|$|E
25|$|On 2 March 2011, Virgin {{released}} an iPlayer application for their TiVo <b>digital</b> <b>video</b> <b>recorder.</b> Unlike the previous implementation, the application streams {{over the internet}} rather than utilising Virgin's video-on-demand service, {{to comply with the}} BBC's then proposed syndication policy. The change also allows an increase in the amount of programmes available, from around 300 to 700 hours on average, bringing Virgin into line with the iPlayer on connected TV devices. At the same time, Virgin Media were also forced to remove direct access to BBC content on TiVo, meaning that instead of being able to access BBC content through its EPG, Virgin TiVo users instead had to go through the Apps and Games area or press the Red Button from a BBC channel. This access was reimplemented with the release of TiVo update 15.2 in late 2011, which integrated BBC iPlayer once again into the TiVo search and EPG after new guidelines on syndicated content were published by the BBC Trust.|$|E
