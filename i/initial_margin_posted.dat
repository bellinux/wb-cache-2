40|$|<b>Initial</b> <b>margin</b> {{requirements}} are becoming an increasingly common feature of derivative markets. However, while the valuation of derivatives under collateralisation (Piterbarg 2010, Piterbarg 2012), under counterparty risk with unsecured funding costs (FVA) (Burgard 2011, Burgard 2011, Burgard 2013) {{and in the}} presence of regulatory capital (KVA) (Green 2014) are established through valuation adjustments, hitherto <b>initial</b> <b>margin</b> has not been considered. This paper further extends the semi-replication framework of (Burgard 2013 a), itself later extended by (Green 2014), {{to cover the cost of}} <b>initial</b> <b>margin,</b> leading to Margin Valuation Adjustment (MVA). <b>Initial</b> <b>margin</b> {{requirements are}} typically generated through the use of VAR or CVAR models. Given the form of MVA as an integral over the expected <b>initial</b> <b>margin</b> profile this would lead to excessive computational costs if a brute force calculation were to be used. Hence we also propose a computationally efficient approach to the calculation of MVA through the use of regression techniques, Longstaff-Schwartz Augmented Compression (LSAC).

40|$|We use an {{extensive}} data set of bilateral {{credit default swap}} (CDS) positions to estimate the impact on collateral demand of new clearing and margin regula-tions. The estimated collateral demands includes both <b>initial</b> <b>margin</b> as well as frictional requirements associated with the movement of variation margin through the network of market participants. We estimate the impact on total collateral de-mand of more widespread <b>initial</b> <b>margin</b> requirements, increased novation of CDS to central clearing parties (CCPs), {{an increase in the}} number of clearing members, the proliferation of CCPs of both specialized and non-specialized types, collateral rehypothecation practices, and client clearing. System-wide collateral demand is increased significantly by the application of <b>initial</b> <b>margin</b> requirements for dealers, whether or not the CDS are cleared. Given these dealer-to-dealer <b>initial</b> <b>margin</b> requirements, mandatory central clearing is shown to lower, not raise, system-wide collateral demand, provided there is no significant proliferation of CCPs.

To then calculate the MVA, Kenyon and Green (2015) again propose to adapt Burgard and Kjaer’s semi-replication method. As with KVA, the evolution of a quantity–here the initial margin–has to be estimated for the expected lifetime of the portfolio. This is done through the calculation of VaR or ES, which may require a computationally expensive Monte Carlo simulation. According to their model, applying a regression technique makes the whole process become much faster.|$|R

40|$|Clearing {{is keeping}} track of {{transactions}} until they are settled. Standardized derivatives such as options and futures can be cleared through a clearinghouse {{if you are a}} clearing member. The clearinghouse step in as an intermediary between trades and manages all occurring counterparty risk. To be able to keep track of all transactions and also monitor members risk exposure a clearinghouse use advanced clearing software. Counterparty risk is mainly handled by collecting collateral from each clearing member, the initial collateral that a clearinghouse require from a member trading with derivatives, is called <b>initial</b> <b>margin.</b> <b>Initial</b> <b>margin</b> is calculated by a risk algorithm incorporated in the clearing software. Cinnober Financial Technology delivers clearing solutions to clearinghouses world wide, software providers to the _nancial industry have high demands on software quality. Ensuring high software quality can be done by performing various types of software testing. The goal of this thesis is to implement an extendable random testing framework that can test risk algorithm implementations that are part of a clearing system under development by Cinnober. By using the implemented framework, we aim to verify if the risk algorithm SPAN calculates fair <b>initial</b> <b>margin</b> amount. We also intend to increase the quality assurance of the risk domain that is responsible for all risk calculations. In this thesis we implement a random testing framework suitable for testing risk algorithms. Furthermore, we implement a framework extension for SPAN that is used to test the SPAN algorithm's <b>initial</b> <b>margin</b> calculations. The implementation consist of two main parts, the _rst being a random generation entity that feeds the clearing system with randomized input data. The second part is a veri_cation entity called test oracle, it is responsible for verifying the SPAN algorithm's calculation results. The random testing framework for risk algorithms was successfully implemented. By running the SPAN extension of the framework, we managed to _nd four issues related to the accuracy of the SPAN algorithm. This discovery led {{to the conclusion that the}} current SPAN algorithm implementation does not calculate fair <b>initial</b> <b>margin.</b> It also led to an immediate increase of quality assurance because the issues will be corrected.

30|$|In {{the present}} paper we apply this {{framework}} to the concrete setup of a bank engaged in bilateral trade portfolios. In this context, the discounted expectation of losses due to the default of counterparties or of the bank itself are respectively known as CVA (credit valuation adjustment) and DVA (debt valuation adjustment). Counterparty risk mitigants include the variation margin (VM), tracking the mark-to-market of client portfolios, and the <b>initial</b> <b>margin</b> (IM) set as a cushion against gap risk, which is the risk of slippage between the portfolio and its variation margin during liquidation periods. The cost of funding cash collateral for the variation margin is known as funding valuation adjustment (FVA), while the cost of funding segregated collateral <b>posted</b> as <b>initial</b> <b>margin</b> is the margin valuation adjustment (MVA). Contra-liability counterparts of the FVA and the MVA arise as the FDA (funding debt adjustment) and the MDA (margin debt adjustment).

We also find that the potential costs of individual or multiple dealer defaults for CCPs and their non-defaulting clearing members are likely to be small relative to their equity as long as CCPs factor into <b>initial</b> <b>margin</b> requirements the extent of tail risk and time variation in risk of different types of derivatives. Finally, clearing different types of OTC derivatives in a single CCP could reduce both margins and collective loss-absorbing resources. ...|$|R
