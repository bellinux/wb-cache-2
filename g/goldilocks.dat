5|$|Goldilocks's fate {{varies in}} the many retellings: in some versions, she runs into the forest, in some she is almost eaten by the bears but her mother rescues her, in some she vows {{to be a good}} child, and in some she returns home. Whatever her fate, <b>Goldilocks</b> fares better than Southey's vagrant old woman who, in his opinion, {{deserved}} a stint in the House of Correction, and far better than Miss Mure's old woman who is impaled upon a steeple in St Paul's church-yard.|$|E
5|$|The {{common use}} of the English {{language}} {{is an example of}} the American impact on Philippine society. It has contributed to the ready acceptance and influence of American pop cultural trends. This affinity is seen in Filipinos' love of fast food and American film and music. Fast food outlets are found on many street corners. American global fast food chain stalwarts have entered the market, but local fast food chains like <b>Goldilocks</b> and most notably Jollibee, the leading fast food chain in the country, have emerged and compete successfully against their foreign rivals.|$|E
5|$|While high {{metallicity}} {{is beneficial}} {{for the creation}} of terrestrial extrasolar planets, an excess amount can be harmful for life. Excess metallicity may lead to the formation {{of a large number of}} gas giants in a given system, which may subsequently migrate from beyond the system's frost line and become hot Jupiters, disturbing planets that would otherwise have been located in the system's circumstellar habitable zone. Thus, it was found that the <b>Goldilocks</b> principle applies to metallicity as well; low-metallicity systems have low probabilities of forming terrestrial-mass planets at all, while excessive metallicities cause a large number of gas giants to develop, disrupting the orbital dynamics of the system and altering the habitability of terrestrial planets in the system.|$|E

25|$|Baer's first acting {{role was}} in <b>Goldilocks</b> and the Three Bears at the Blackpool Pavilion in England in 1949. He began acting professionally in 1960 at Warner Bros., {{where he made}} {{appearances}} on television programs such as Maverick, Surfside 6, Hawaiian Eye, Cheyenne, The Roaring 20s, and 77 Sunset Strip. His career took off two years later, {{when he joined the}} cast of The Beverly Hillbillies.|$|E
25|$|The {{terrestrial}} example {{suggests that}} complex life requires {{water in the}} liquid state, and a central star's planet must therefore be at an appropriate distance. This {{is the core of}} the notion of the habitable zone or <b>Goldilocks</b> Principle. The habitable zone forms a ring around the central star. If a planet orbits its sun too closely or too far away, the surface temperature is incompatible with water being in liquid form.|$|E

25|$|Southey {{was also}} a {{prolific}} letter writer, literary scholar, essay writer, historian and biographer. His biographies include the life and works of John Bunyan, John Wesley, William Cowper, Oliver Cromwell and Horatio Nelson. The last has rarely been out of print since its publication in 1813 and was adapted for the screen in the 1926 British film, Nelson. He {{was also a}} renowned scholar of Portuguese and Spanish literature and history, translating a number of works from those two languages into English and writing a History of Brazil (part of his planned History of Portugal, which he never completed) and a History of the Peninsular War. Perhaps his most enduring contribution to literary history is the children's classic The Story of the Three Bears, the original <b>Goldilocks</b> story, first published in Southey's prose collection The Doctor. He also wrote on political issues, {{which led to a}} brief, non-sitting, spell as a Tory Member of Parliament.|$|E
500|$|Kurt Schwertsik's 35-minute opera Roald Dahl's <b>Goldilocks</b> premiered in 1997 at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall. The opera's {{setting is}} the Forest Assizes where Baby Bear stands accused of assaulting Miss Goldie Locks.

500|$|... "Goldilocks and the Three Bears" [...] and {{the older}} still [...] "The Story of the Three Bears" [...] are two {{variations}} of a 19th-century fairy tale. The original tale tells of a badly-behaved old woman who enters the forest home of three bachelor bears whilst they are away. She sits in their chairs, eats some of their porridge, and sleeps {{in one of their}} beds. When the bears return and discover her, she starts up, jumps from the window, and is never seen again. The other major version brings <b>Goldilocks</b> to the tale (replacing the old woman), and an even later version retained <b>Goldilocks,</b> but has the three bachelor bears transformed into Papa, Mama, and Baby Bear.|$|E
500|$|The TV show [...] {{featured}} an adaption of [...] "Goldilocks and the Three Bears" [...] in a Jamaican setting {{which featured}} {{the voices of}} Raven-Symoné as <b>Goldilocks,</b> Tone Loc as Desmond Bear, Alfre Woodard as Winsone Bear, and David Alan Grier as Dudley Bear.|$|E
500|$|In The Uses of Enchantment (1976), {{the child}} {{psychologist}} Bruno Bettelheim describes <b>Goldilocks</b> as [...] "poor, beautiful, and charming", and {{notes that the}} story does not describe her positively except for her hair. Bettelheim mainly discussed the tale in terms of Goldilock's struggle to move past Oedipal issues to confront adolescent identity problems.|$|E
500|$|The story makes {{extensive}} use of the literary rule of three, featuring three chairs, three bowls of porridge, three beds, and the three title characters {{who live in the}} house. There are also three sequences of the bears discovering in turn that someone has been eating from their porridge, sitting in their chairs, and finally, lying in their beds, at which point is the climax of <b>Goldilocks</b> being discovered. This follows three earlier sequences of <b>Goldilocks</b> trying the bowls of porridge, chairs, and beds successively, each time finding the third [...] "just right". Author Christopher Booker characterizes this as the [...] "dialectical three", where [...] "the first is wrong in one way, the second in another or opposite way, and only the third, in the middle, is just right." [...] Booker continues [...] "This idea that the way forward lies in finding an exact middle path between opposites is of extraordinary importance in storytelling". This concept has spread across many other disciplines, particularly developmental psychology, biology, economics and engineering where it is called the [...] "Goldilocks Principle".|$|E
500|$|In Rooster Teeth Productions RWBY, Yang Xiao Long is a carefree, {{reckless}} yellow-haired girl. She is a [...] "rule-breaker" [...] {{who likes}} teddy bears. She is {{an allusion to}} <b>Goldilocks</b> which is reflected in her name, translated from Chinese as [...] "sun", referring to the color yellow. Also, in her trailer, Yang confronts Hei [...] "Junior" [...] Xiong, whose name is Chinese for [...] "black bear." [...] Combining this with his nickname, he alludes to the Baby Bear.|$|E
500|$|In {{interviews}} {{during the}} tour, it was remarked by interviewers that the singer appeared similar to actors Bob Hoskins and Danny DeVito. Collins joked {{that all three}} of them could play the Three Bears from the story <b>Goldilocks</b> and the Three Bears. DeVito heard the idea, and contacted Collins and Hoskins about making a film. Collins researched bears, and a script was planned. Kim Basinger reportedly wished {{to play the role of}} [...] "Goldilocks". However, problems arose (mostly involving the script), and all three actors abandoned the film.|$|E
500|$|A {{commercial}} for the 2005 Hummer portrayed the Three Bears {{returning from a}} family trip to their very upscale home to discover {{all the elements of}} the traditional story. They race to their garage to check on the status of the family Hummers. Mama Bear and Papa Bear are relieved that both vehicles are still in place, but Baby Bear is distraught to find his missing as the camera cuts away to <b>Goldilocks</b> (in this version portrayed by a very attractive young woman) rakishly smiling as she makes her getaway in Baby Bear's Hummer down a scenic mountain road.|$|E
500|$|Once {{the little}} girl entered the tale, she {{remained}} [...] suggesting children prefer an attractive child in the story rather than an ugly old woman. The juvenile antagonist saw a succession of names: Silver Hair in the pantomime Harlequin and The Three Bears; or, Little Silver Hair and the Fairies by J.B. Buckstone (1853); Silver-Locks in Aunt Mavor's Nursery Tales (1858); Silverhair in George MacDonald's [...] "The Golden Key" [...] (1867); Golden Hair in Aunt Friendly's Nursery Book (ca. 1868); Silver-Hair and Goldenlocks at various times; Little Golden-Hair (1889); and finally <b>Goldilocks</b> in Old Nursery Stories and Rhymes (1904). Tatar credits Flora Annie Steel with naming the child (1918).|$|E
500|$|Some early {{sketches}} of Shrek's house were done between 1996 and 1997 using Photoshop, with the sketches showing Shrek first {{living in a}} garbage dump near a human village called Wart Creek. It was also thought one time that {{he lived with his}} parents and kept rotting fish in his bedroom. Donkey was modeled after Pericles (born 1994; also known as Perry), a real miniature donkey from Barron Park in Palo Alto, California. Raman Hui, supervising animator of Shrek, stated that Fiona [...] "wasn't based on any real person." [...] and he did many different sketches for her. He had done over 100 sculptures of Fiona before the directors chose the final design. In early development, the art directors visited Hearst Castle, Stratford upon Avon, and Dordogne for inspiration. Art Director Douglas Rogers visited a magnolia plantation in Charleston, South Carolina for inspiration of Shrek's swamp. Planned characters not used in the film include <b>Goldilocks</b> and Sleeping Beauty.|$|E
