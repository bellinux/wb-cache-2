The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) has {{developed}} the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) {{as a single}} set of <b>global</b> <b>accounting</b> guidelines. As the world's economy has become increasingly connected, {{the need for a}} single set of <b>global</b> <b>accounting</b> guidelines has become necessary. The United States has stated interest in adopting IFRS, although, at this time the United States has not adopted IFRS. This project reviews prior articles on the topic of <b>global</b> <b>accounting</b> convergence. Also, this project examines the Stock and Exchange Commission's (SEC) research on the United States role on <b>global</b> <b>accounting</b> convergence. The conclusion reached is that the United States should adopt IFRS. A single set of accounting guidelines provides greater transparency and consistent information for users of financial statements.

This working paper outlines a research project 2 {{on the role of}} the <b>Global</b> <b>Account</b> Manager in managing global business-to-business relationships.

40|$|Abstract. This paper uses two {{theoretical}} perspectives, {{information processing}} and resource dependency, to examine <b>global</b> <b>account</b> management (the co-ordination of activities involved in serving a single customer in multiple countries). It is hypothesized that <b>global</b> <b>account</b> management structures allow the multinational corporation (MNC) {{to increase its}} information processing capacity {{as well as its}} bargaining power vis-á-vis the global customer. Using data on 106 global accounts in 16 MNCs, we find support for both perspectives individually. Furthermore, evidence is presented for an interaction effect in which the effectiveness of structures for increasing information processing is conditional upon the presence of high customer dependence. 2 <b>GLOBAL</b> <b>ACCOUNT</b> MANAGEMENT IN MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS: THEORY AND EVIDENCE The coordination of customer management across national boundaries, commonly referred to as <b>global</b> <b>account</b> management, has {{emerged as one of the}} most prevalent corporate responses to the globalization of markets.
