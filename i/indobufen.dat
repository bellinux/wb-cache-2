40|$|Using an end-to-side microanastomosis of {{the left}} common carotid into the right common carotid of rats, {{implementing}} a potentially thrombogenic situation, we have investigated the possible antithrombotic effect of <b>indobufen,</b> a new antiplatelet drug. In eight of 15 untreated rats the anastomosis was totally obstructed by a single thrombus growing from the anastomotic wall. <b>Indobufen</b> treatment prevented thrombus formation completely in 14 of 15 rats (p less than 0. 02). In treated animals <b>indobufen</b> also produced a statistically significant reduction of ADP-induced platelet aggregation relative to basal values.

40|$|This study {{assessed}} the possible interactions of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor <b>indobufen</b> with one sulphonylurea, glipizide, and with two beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, {{one of which}} is extensively metabolised already in the first passage through the liver (propranolol) while the other essentially escapes biotransformation (atenolol). <b>Indobufen</b> was first given as a single 200 mg dose and then for a 5 day period in a dosage of 200 mg twice daily, to six healthy volunteers. Glipizide (5 mg), propranolol (80 mg) and atenolol (100 mg) were given as single doses before and during <b>indobufen</b> medication. The drug concentrations were measured by selective and sensitive h. p. l. c. methods. The findings suggest that the lipophilic acid <b>indobufen</b> can inhibit the metabolic inactivation of another lipophilic acid, glipizide, but does not interfere with the disposal of the two basic drugs, propranolol and atenolol. The increased glipizide concentrations following <b>indobufen</b> were associated with an enhanced blood glucose reduction. Hence, this interaction may be clinically relevant...|$|E
40|$|Indobufen&mdash;an {{inhibitor}} of platelets aggregation&mdash;has {{been used}} in 306 pa-tients with intermittent claudication due to peripheral vascular disease. Patients were treated and followed up for one year. One patient of every 3 treated with <b>indobufen</b> was treated with ASA, and a control group of patients receiving no treatment was also followed up. The authors studied {{by means of a}} treadmill exercise test the pain-free walking distance (PFWD), the global walking distance (GWD), and the recovery time after exercise. The treatment period was com-pleted by 290 patients: 204 claudicants, 51 claudicants with diabetes, and 35 with a short PFWD and GWD (> 150 m). <b>Indobufen</b> was more effective than ASA in improving the PFWD and GWD in all groups.

40|$|Background. The {{purpose of}} this randomized, {{double-blind}} study was to evaluate the efficacy of <b>indobufen,</b> a reversible inhibitor of platelet cyclooxygenase, {{in the prevention of}} embolic events of cardiac origin. Methods and Results. One hundred ninety-six patients with heart disease and at risk for cardiogenic embolism (90 with atrial fibrillation and 106 in sinus rhythm) were randomly assigned to receive <b>indobufen</b> (100 mg b. i. d.) or placebo. All patients were reexamined every 3 months {{for the duration of the}} study. The primary study end points were cerebral ischemic attack (stroke and transient ischemic attack), systemic embolism, pulmonary embolism, and fatal myocardial infarction. The median duration of treatment was 854 days in the <b>indobufen</b> group and 865 days in the placebo group. The frequencies of primary end points (fatal and nonfatal) were 6. 1 % and 17. 3 %, respectively, in the <b>indobufen</b> and placebo groups (p< 0. 05) for a reduction of 65 % in the risk of a primary event (indobufen/placebo relative risk, 0. 35; 95 % confidence limits, 0. 14 - 0. 89). Adverse drug reactions, mostly gastrointestinal or hemostasis disorders, occurred in 9. 2 % of indobufen-treated patients. Conclusions. The results of the study indicate that <b>indobufen</b> may reduce the risk of ischemic events in patients with heart disease associated with an increased risk of embolism.

40|$|A {{randomized}} {{clinical trial}} was undertaken {{to assess the}} efficacy of <b>indobufen</b> in inhibiting platelet adhesiveness in carotid thrombo-endarterectomy. The patients were treated under double-blind condi-tions with <b>indobufen</b> and with placebo, and were then assessed by means of scintigraphy with labelled platelets, ultrasonic tomography and angiography for a minimum follow-up period of 6 months. Haemato-logical and clinical assessments were also performed. The results ofthe study suggest that platelet accumulation in carotid endarterectomy may be an early sign of restenosis; anti-aggregant treatment with <b>indobufen</b> carried out {{at an early stage}} prior to surgery inhibited platelet accumulation.

40|$|Objective: To {{assess whether}} <b>indobufen,</b> a {{reversible}} inhibitor of platelet cyclooxygenase (Cox) activity, affects tissue factor (TF) in human monocytes and {{to investigate the}} relationship between Cox-derived products and TF. Methods: TF was evaluated in isolated adherent monocytes, both resting and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -stimulated, in terms of procoagulant activity, protein, and mRNA levels. The expression of TF surface antigen was determined in LPS-stimulated whole blood monocytes by flow cytometry. The levels of the stable thromboxane A 2 (TxA 2) metabolite, TxB 2, and of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) were measured in monocyte supernatant by immunoenzymatic techniques. Cox- 1 and Cox- 2 protein level, tyrosine phosphorylation, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP-kinase) activation were determined by Western blot analysis. Results: <b>Indobufen</b> prevents TF expression and activity both in isolated and in whole blood monocytes. Reduction of TxA 2 synthesis, coupled {{with a lack of}} effect on PGE 2 levels and prevention of ERK 1 / 2 phosphorylation are highlighted as the mechanisms through which <b>indobufen</b> negatively affects TF. Conclusions: Data show that <b>indobufen</b> down-regulates TF in monocytes. This novel activity, coupled with the antiplatelet effect of the drug, may add benefit for its use in the management of atherothrombosis. © 2005 European Society of Cardiology.

40|$|<b>Indobufen</b> is a {{reversible}} inhibitor of platelet prostaglandin G/H-synthase. To {{verify the}} dose {{dependence of the}} antiplatelet effect of <b>indobufen</b> on ex vivo and in vivo indexes of thromboxane (TX) biosynthesis and TXA 2 -dependent platelet function, we studied nine patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). This was a randomized, double-blind, crossover study in which each patient was treated with three different daily regimens (50 mg BID, 100 mg BID, and 200 mg BID) of <b>indobufen</b> for 1 week, with a 7 -day washout period between treatments. Urinary 11 -dehydro-TXB 2 excretion averaged 58. 2 +/- 21. 8 ng/h at baseline. TX metabolite excretion was reduced dose dependently by indobufen: by 67 % at 50 mg BID, 72 % at 100 mg BID, and 81 % at 200 mg BID. Platelet cyclooxygenase activity, ATP release, collagen-induced platelet aggregation, and bleeding time also were modified dose dependently by <b>indobufen.</b> Biochemical demonstration of suppressed platelet TXA 2 in vivo was accompanied by evidence of inhibited platelet function as assessed ex vivo.

40|$|Seventy-one {{patients}} with peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) were random-ized {{into two groups}} of different treatment modalities. The diagnosis of PAOD was estab-lished by history of intermittent claudication, clinical examination, and by Doppler pressure assessment or lower extremity arteriography. After a three-month washout period, 35 patients (Group 1) started treatment with <b>indobufen</b> (400 mg per day) and 36 patients (Group 2) with pentoxifylline (600 mg per day). Twenty-nine patients from each group completed six months of treatment. Both of the drugs significantly improved maximal and pain-free walking distances, but the effect of <b>indobufen</b> was more pronounced than that of pentoxifylline. Patients with PAOD exhibited signs of hyperco-agulation. Fibrinogen, D-dimer, and b-thromboglobulin concentrations did not change significantly following treatment in both of the groups.

40|$|The {{prescription}} {{of aspirin}} (acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)) {{to patients with}} a history of hypersensitivity to this drug could prove harmful. The aim {{of the study was to}} assess the antiplatelet activity and safety of a combined antiplatelet treatment with <b>indobufen</b> and clopidogrel in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients with hypersensitivity to aspirin, undergoing coronary stenting. Forty-two consecutive ACS patients treated with stent implantation were randomly assigned to receive clopidogrel 75 [*]mg daily (loading dose 300 [*]mg) plus <b>indobufen</b> 100 [*]mg twice a day (group A), or clopidogrel 75 [*]mg daily, after 300 [*]mg of loading dose (group B). Platelet activity and safety were monitored in both groups at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 18 months with laboratory and clinical evaluation. A lower value of max % platelet aggregation to arachidonic acid and collagen was found in group A compared to group B (31. 79 [*]±[*] 27. 33 vs. 73. 67 [*]±[*] 19. 92; p[*]<[*] 0. 0001 and 28. 53 [*]±[*] 21. 32 vs. 73. 58 [*]±[*] 17. 71; p[*]<[*] 0. 0001, respectively).

40|$|Non-valvular atrial {{fibrillation}} {{increases the risk}} of stroke by a factor of 5 and is present in about 15 % of patients with acute stroke. Its prevalence in the general population increases from 0. 5 % at 50 - 59 years to > 10 % at 80 - 99 years. In patients with non-valvular {{atrial fibrillation}} the risk of stroke increases with age, blood pressure and other evidence of cardiac disease. In addition, non-valvular atrial fibrillation is associated with a greater early mortality and a greater risk of recurrent stroke. The anticoagulant therapy to prevent early recurrent embolism is likewise controversial. Anticoagulant therapy appears to reduce this risk, but there is the danger of accentuating hemorrhagic infarction, especially in patients with large strokes. The effectiveness of antiplatelet drugs in patients with cardioembolic stroke is also not defined. The Studio Italiano Fibrillazione Atriale (SIFA) is a multicentric, randomized trial to assess the efficacy and safety of anticoagulant, warfarin, versus antiplatelet treatment, <b>indobufen,</b> a reversible inhibitor of platelet cyclo-oxygenase, in the prevention of recurrent cerebral ischemia and other systemic embolisms in non-valvular atrial fibrillation patients.

40|$|The {{effect of}} oral anticoagulation for primary and {{secondary}} prevention of stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) has been clearly shown in several studies. Still uncertain {{is the role of}} antiplatelet agents. The SIFA is a multicenter open randomized trial which aims to compare the efficacy and safety of an oral anticoagulant treatment (Warfarin to obtain an INR of 2. 0 – 3. 5) with an antiplatelet drug (<b>Indobufen,</b> a reversible cyclooxygenase inhibitor, 100 – 200 mg bid) in patients with NVAF and a recent (≤ 14 days) transient ischaemic attack or stroke. The study started in January 1991 and is expected to be completed by December 1994. Nine hundred and fifty patients entered the trial and were treated for 12 months. The primary outcome events were: non-fatal stroke (including cerebral haemorrhage), systemic embolism, non-fatal myocardial infarction or vascular death. An interim analysis carried out on the first 582 patients irrespectively from treatment groups showed an overall stroke rate (2. 9 %) and a frequency of primary end-points (7. 4 %) very similar to those observed in the anticoagulant arm of a recently published study (European Atrial Fibrillation Trial).

40|$|Two {{prospective}} randomized {{double blind}} clinical trials, performed in United Kingdom (UK) and in Italy (IT) showed that <b>Indobufen</b> (INB) reversible cyclooxygenase inhibitorl is as effective as, and safer than, {{the association of}} Aspirin plus Dipyridamole in preventing the occlusion of saphenous vein (SV) coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG). The power {{of each of the}} two trials was 80 % for a difference in graft occlusion of 10 %. We present the results of the analysis, carried out by properly combining the information given by the two trials in order to increase the precision of the estimates both of efficacy and of safety. The analysis was performed on total 934 patients who underwent 1 year angiography (2258 SV distal anastomosis). UK and IT patients had similar clinical characteristics, UK pts had higher number of grafts per patient and smaller vessel diameters, distal anastomosis occlusion rates were 19. 8 % (UK) and 20. 9 % (IT), small vessel diameter (< 1. 5 mm) and right coronary artery location adversely affected graft patency in both groups. Combined analysis showed that: al the Odds Ratio of distal anastomosis occlusion of INB vs ASA + DIP group is: OR= 1. 05 (95 % CL: 0. 85 – 1. 291 suggesting that the efficacy of the two treatments is comparable and b) INB had significantly fewer side effects than ASA + DIP.

40|$|There is no {{consensus}} on {{the efficacy of the}} antithrombotic drugs available for patients with intermittent claudication. A Medline and manual search was used to identify relevant publications. Uncontrolled or retrospective studies, double reports or trials without clinical outcomes were excluded. Included studies were graded as level 1 (randomised and double- or assessor-blind), level 2 (open randomised), or level 3 (non-randomised comparative). Mortality, cerebro- or cardiovascular events, amputations, arterial occlusions or number of revascularization procedures performed in the lower limbs, pain-free and total walking distance, ankle brachial index and calf blood flow, were the main outcomes considered. When feasible, end of treatment results, either continuous or binary, were combined with appropriate statistical methods. Mortality was significantly decreased by ticlopidine compared to placebo (common odds ratio 0. 68, 95 % C. I., 0. 49 - 0. 95); clopidogrel decreased vascular events in comparison to aspirin (odds ratio 0. 76, 95 % C. I., 0. 63 - 0. 92) in level 1 studies. Arterial occlusions and the number of revascularization procedures performed were statistically significantly decreased by aspirin and ticlopidine, respectively. A small but statistically significant improvement in pain-free walking distance was determined by picotamide, <b>indobufen,</b> low molecular weight heparins, sulodexide and defibrotide, in small studies. Clopidogrel and ticlopidine do reduce clinically important events in patients with intermittent claudication and could be added to the primary medical treatment of these patients.
