25|$|In the United States, {{competitive}} drifters {{are required}} to run US DOT-approved (road legal) tires similar to racing slicks in rubber composition, but with shallow treads included.

Professional drifting <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> point where grip is tuned into cars to be defeated. It makes for a faster drift necessary in the current professional climate. Tires typically used by drifters are around the DOT treadwear rating of 200.
