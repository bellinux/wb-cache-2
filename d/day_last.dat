25|$|Elizabeth Cole tells Hastings {{that she}} is a sister of Margaret Litchfield, who confessed to the murder of their father in one of the five cases. Margaret has died in Broadmoor Asylum and Elizabeth is stigmatised by the trauma. Three {{incidents}} occur in the next few days, showing the imprint of X. First, Hastings and others overhear an argument between the Luttrells. Shortly afterwards, Luttrell wounds his wife with a rook rifle, saying he mistook her for a rabbit. Mrs Luttrell recovers, and the incident has a good effect on their marriage. Next, Hastings is concerned that his daughter Judith spends time with Major Allerton, a married man. While Hastings and Elizabeth are out with birdwatcher Stephen Norton, Norton sees something through his binoculars that disturbs him. Hastings assumes {{it has to do with}} Allerton. When his attempts to persuade Judith to give Allerton up merely antagonise her, the worried father plans Allerton's murder. He falls asleep while waiting to poison Allerton, relieved he took no action when he awakes the next <b>day.</b> <b>Last,</b> Barbara Franklin, wife of Judith's employer Dr Franklin, dies the following evening. She was poisoned with physostigmine sulphate, an extract from the Calabar bean that her husband researches. Poirot's testimony at the inquest, that Mrs Franklin had been upset and that he saw her emerge from Dr Franklin's laboratory with a small bottle, persuades the jury to return a verdict of suicide.|$|E
500|$|Individuals {{had been}} visiting the castle {{since the end}} of the 17th century and this grew in {{importance}} through the 19th century. In 1858 Queen Victoria visited the 4th earl with great local celebrations. However, by 1885 it would appear the visitors were becoming a nuisance as the earl closed the castle to visitors, causing consternation in the town. A local report stated, [...] "One <b>day</b> <b>last</b> week eight American visitors who were staying at one of the principal hotels left somewhat hurriedly in consequence of their being unable to gain admission to the castle". It soon re-opened again and by 1900 had a ticket office and was employing a permanent guide. By 1936 Arthur Mee was enthusing not just that [...] "these walls have seen something of the splendour of every generation of our [...] story", with rooms [...] "rich in treasure beyond the dreams of avarice" [...] but also that [...] "their rooms are open to all who will". The collection of armoury on display at Warwick Castle is regarded as second only to that of the Tower of London.|$|E

I didn't like {{the thought of}} doing it like {{everyone}} else–maybe a mix through the back catalog and a few exclusive new tracks by some key artists... I wanted something more special. Then a while ago I met Emika, she’s making music herself on Ninja Tune. We sat together one <b>day</b> <b>last</b> summer {{and she told me}} about her last visit to Berghain. It was a regular Sunday morning and she noticed how everything in the building was resonating and vibrating and swinging and humming–she realized that there were lot of sounds coming from the building itself.

2500|$|This win was the 57th {{game between}} New Mexico and BYU. [...] BYU beat the Lobos 42-17 on Senior <b>Day</b> <b>last</b> year. [...] This game {{featured}} the MWC's leading passer, UNM's Porterie, and {{was expected to}} test BYU's secondary particularly after the Cougar's shootout with Tulsa. [...] The game was tied {{at the end of}} the third quarter with a 71-yard touchdown reception by the Lobo's running back, Ferguson, and a 2-point conversion after BYU jumped out to lead with a pick six by Kehl in the first 2 minutes of the game and took advantage of five turnovers and a blocked PAT by Criddle. [...] Overall, the Cougars showed balance and performed well in all aspects of the game on both sides of the ball. [...] Bryan Kehl was named the MWC Defensive Player of the Week with 10 tackles including a sack, a forced fumble, a fumble recovery, and an interception for a 36-yard touchdown.|$|E
2500|$|The footage shows {{interviewer}} Steve Murphy asking Dion the question: [...] "If {{you were}} the Prime Minister now, {{what would you have}} done about the economy, and this crisis, that Mr. Harper has not done?". [...] Dion had difficulty in understanding the question, repeatedly asking Murphy to clarify if he meant if Dion was Prime Minister now, next Tuesday on election <b>day,</b> <b>last</b> week, last month, 60 weeks ago, or two and a half years ago. [...] Eventually, after three start overs to the interview, Dion responded with what he would do if elected Prime Minister in the future. CTV initially agreed to restart the interviews and not air the false starts but changed their minds and announced that they felt it was their responsibility to show it. Harper responded to the clips by saying that [...] "When you're running a trillion-and-a-half-dollar economy you don't get a chance to have do-overs, over and over again" [...] and [...] "What this incident actually indicates very clearly is Mr. Dion and the Liberal Party really don't know what they would do on the economy", and when told that the difficulties were in part due to English being Dion's second language, Harper said: [...] "I don't think this is a question of language at all. The question was very clear. It was asked repeatedly".|$|E

2500|$|Based on [...] "reporting {{received}} from districts for assemblies held October 1, 2015, through September 30, 2016", {{at the end}} of September 2016 the Church of the Nazarene had 2,471,553 total members (a net increase of [...] 30,181 or 1.24 percent gain from the previous year). During that reporting period, 139,560 people became new members of the Church of the Nazarene, with 113,968 received by profession of faith and a further 25,592 coming from other denominations. With 626,811 members, the USA was the nation with the greatest number of Nazarenes, with 25.36% of all Nazarenes members of US congregations. Other nations with large Nazarene populations include Mozambique (202,118), Brazil (153,002), India (136,079), Haiti (134,236), Bangladesh (123,192), Guatemala (90,101), Mexico (70,700), Peru (67,394), Benin (56,036), and Ethiopia (50,361). In 2016, the Church of the Nazarene had the highest percentage presence in the nations of Barbados (where its members constitute 2.84% of the population), Cape Verde (1.54% of the population), Swaziland (1.42% of the population), Haiti (1.34% of the population) Mozambique (0.82% of the population), and Samoa (0.66% of the population). The highest percentage of Nazarene presence in the USA occurred in 2000, when there were 2.25 members for every 1,000 US people (0.25%). According to the Board of General Superintendents in December 2009, [...] "an average of 455 people came to Christ and joined the Church of the Nazarene every <b>day</b> <b>last</b> year".|$|E
2500|$|The Lakers were 3–0 {{in their}} first week back, {{including}} a win over the rival Celtics. Bryant was named the Western Conference {{player of the week}} after averaging 31.3 points, 7.7 rebounds and 6.0 assists. He scored 38 points while shooting at least 60% in consecutive games, {{the first time in his}} career; he also became the oldest player to accomplish the feat. Bryant said he was [...] "in attack mode since the [...] break", but was reacting to the defense to determine if he should score or be a playmaker. Howard was looking fresher since the break, yet still said he was [...] "not even close" [...] to physically being where he wanted to be. D'Antoni attributed his conditioning to his difficulty with running the pick and roll. On February 25, the Lakers lost 119–108 at Denver, failing to reach [...]500 for the first time since New Year's <b>Day.</b> <b>Last</b> in the NBA in points allowed off fast breaks, they were outscored by the Nuggets 33–3 on fast breaks. The Lakers' three-point shooting and turnovers contributed to their season's fast break woes. Their mediocre three-point shooting resulted in an increase in long rebounds, and they were among the worst in the league in turnovers and last in points allowed per game off turnovers. The Lakers were 9–4 in February, ending the month with a 29–30 record after entering it 20-26. Bryant was named Western Conference player of the month after averaging 23.9 points with 6.6 assists and 6.7 rebounds a game.|$|E
2500|$|Stocky, {{grinning}} Capt. Frank Monroe Hawks, famed publicity flyer, {{holder of}} nearly all informal city-to-city speed records in the U.S. and Europe, was not grinning one <b>day</b> <b>last</b> week when attendants at the Worcester, Massachusetts, airport pulled him from beneath his crashed Travel Air [...] "Mystery Plane" [...] Texaco 13. Day before he had hopped from Detroit (in 3 hr. 5 min.). lectured the Worcester Boy Scouts on the necessity of developing foolproof planes, but had delayed his departure until the next morning because of a soggy field. An escort plane had nosed up when it landed just ahead of Capt. Hawks. After attempting to take off from a short dirt road which cut diagonally across the airport, he headed his low-wing monoplane down the field, less than 700 ft. in length. Oozy ground sucked at the wheels, kept him from attaining the 70 m.p.h. required to zoom off. Toward {{the end of the}} runway, going about 50 m.p.h., the ship bounced off a low mound, cut through heavy undergrowth, somersaulted over a stone wall. Hawks cut the motor in time, and saved himself from cremation. Capt. Hawks's nose and jaw were fractured, his face badly battered, several of his big, white teeth knocked out. He lay unconscious in the hospital for hours. Said Harvard Medical School's famed plastic surgeon, Dr. Varaztad Hovhannes Kazanjian: [...] "I do not think his speech will be affected. The operation for restoring his face should leave scarcely a scar." [...] Capt. Hawks's good friend Will Rogers wired: [...] "Sure glad nothing broke but your jaw. That will keep you still for a while. If I broke my jaw, I could still wire gags. What's the matter with you anyhow; are you getting... brittle?" ...|$|E
