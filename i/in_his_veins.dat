25|$|This {{legal system}} of racial {{classification}} based on patrilineal descent had no parallel {{anywhere in the}} Spanish-ruled colonies in the Americas. In general, a son born of a sangley male and an indio or mestizo de sangley female was classified as mestizo de sangley; all subsequent male descendants were mestizos de sangley {{regardless of whether they}} married an India or a mestiza de sangley. A daughter born in such a manner, however, acquired the legal classification of her husband, i.e., she became an India if she married an indio but remained a mestiza de sangley if she married a mestizo de sangley or a sangley. In this way, a chino mestizo male descendant of a paternal sangley ancestor never lost his legal status as a mestizo de sangley no matter how little percentage of Chinese blood he had <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>veins</b> or how many generations had passed since his first Chinese ancestor; he was thus a mestizo de sangley in perpetuity.|$|E
25|$|In 1894, Boyce {{was elected}} to the Idaho state senate as a Populist from Shoshone County, Idaho. Boyce battled for the eight-hour day for miners, the {{establishment}} of an arbitration board to settle labor disputes, and an investigation of the 1892 mining war. He objected to appropriations for the state militia, charging that it was a tool used by the state and mine owners to suppress labor. He called for legislation to forbid employment of aliens, to outlaw yellow-dog contracts and prohibit company stores. In {{one of the most dramatic}} speeches he ever made, Boyce denounced the blacklist:Senate bill fifty six provides for no class, no special legislation, but under its provisions those relentless persecutors, known as corporations, are prevented when they discharge an employee from following him with a blacklist and depriving him of the means of earning an honest living in another part of the state….Why do you not produce some argument against it to show that it should not become a law? No, it is not necessary: you of the Republican party have the votes to kill the bill and that is all you desire. But remember these words: the laboring men of Idaho have asked you for bread and you give them a stone: we ask you for justice and you treat us with scorn, but the day is fast approaching when your action will be condemned by every man who has one drop of manly blood <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>veins.</b>|$|E

500|$|Welensky {{was born}} in Pioneer Street, Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia. His father, Michael Welensky (b. c. 1843), was of Lithuanian Jewish origin, hailing from a village near Wilno (today Vilnius); a trader in Russia and horse-smuggler during the Franco-Prussian War, he settled in Southern Rhodesia after first emigrating to the United States, {{where he was a}} saloon-keeper, and then South Africa. His mother, Leah (born Aletta Ferreira; c. 1865–1918), was a ninth-generation Afrikaner of Dutch ancestry. His parents, for whom Raphael or [...] "Roy" [...] was the 13th child, kept a [...] "poor white" [...] {{boarding}} house. Welensky's mother died when he was 11, being treated by Godfrey Huggins, a doctor who was later to become the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia. Although not of British ancestry, Welensky was intensely pro-British, a distinctive sentiment among Rhodesians. John Connell, in his foreword to Welensky's book 4000 Days, wrote: [...] "Welensky, who had not a drop of British blood <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>veins,</b> shared this pride and loyalty [...] to the full." ...|$|E

He spent nearly 45years in the Army but called it [...] "a regret" [...] {{that he never}} fought in a {{conventional}} battle—having been in a staff position in 1982 during the Falklands War and serving as a brigade commander in Northern Ireland during the Gulf War. He said that [...] "Fighting is what {{a young man with}} good red blood <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>veins</b> joins for. It is the ultimate test for the professional soldier". He has continued to voice opinions on military matters in his retirement. He delivered the annual Richard Dimbleby Lecture four months after leaving the Army. In the lecture, titled The Defence of The Realm in the 21st Century, he criticised the Ministry of Defence and questioned the MoD's understanding of the fundamental ethos of the armed forces. He was critical of the treatment of soldiers, calling some soldiers' accommodation [...] "frankly shaming" [...] and saying that the [...] "Armed Forces' contract with the nation... must be a two-way one", going on to say that [...] "military operations cost in blood and treasure, because risk-free soldiering, which some seem to think is possible, is simply a contradiction in terms". The MoD responded by saying that [...] "while we do not agree with everything Sir Mike has said, we are always the first to recognise—for example in relation to medical services and accommodation—that although we have delivered real improvements, there is more we can do".|$|E

His performance and his decision to portray a character with negative shades, breaking the stereotype hero image in Tamil cinema, were lauded by critics, with reviewers from Sify and Rediff terming the film as an [...] "out and out Ajith film" [...] that worked [...] "only because of Ajith".

2500|$|Rosenberg {{was born}} on 12 January 1893 in Tallinn in the Russian Empire, the capital of modern Estonia, to a family of Baltic Germans. His father, Waldemar Wilhelm Rosenberg, was a wealthy {{merchant}} from Latvia, and his mother, Elfriede (née Siré), was a teacher of French language in Tallinn. The Hungarian-Jewish journalist Franz Szell, who was apparently residing in Tilsit, Lithuania, spent a year researching in Latvian and Estonian archives before publishing in 1936 an open letter, with copies to Hermann Göring, Joseph Goebbels, German foreign minister Konstantin von Neurath, and others, accusing Rosenberg of having [...] "no drop of German blood" [...] flowing <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>veins.</b> Szell wrote that among Rosenberg's ancestors were only [...] "Latvians, Jews, Mongols, and French." [...] As {{a result of his}} open letter, Szell was deported by Lithuanian authorities on September 15, 1936. His claims were repeated in the 15 September 1937 issue of the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano.|$|E

It is also <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>vein</b> of younger boys discovering darker sides of life and it is left unclear whether the protagonist did the right thing or not.The title originates from a line in Gustave Flaubert's Madame Bovary: “Language is a cracked kettle on which we beat out tunes for bears to dance to, while all the time we long to move the stars to pity." ...|$|R
