25|$|About 52% of an oral or <b>intravenous</b> <b>dose</b> of {{moxifloxacin}} is metabolized via glucuronide and sulfate conjugation. The cytochrome P450 {{system is}} not involved in moxifloxacin metabolism, and is not affected by moxifloxacin. The sulfate conjugate (M1) accounts for around 38% of the dose, and is eliminated primarily in the feces. Approximately 14% of an oral or <b>intravenous</b> <b>dose</b> is converted to a glucuronide conjugate (M2), which is excreted exclusively in the urine. Peak plasma concentrations of M2 are about 40% those of the parent drug, while plasma concentrations of M1 are, in general, less than 10% those of moxifloxacin.|$|E

40|$|Preliminary {{data are}} given on the LD 50 of PdCl 2 {{following}} different routes of exposure {{and on the}} LD 50 of PtCl 4 following intravenous exposure. The retention, tissue distribution, and excretion of 103 Pd and 191 Pt in rats was determined following oral, intravenous, intratracheal, and inhalation exposure. The highest retention for both 103 Pd and 191 Pt was obtained following <b>intravenous</b> <b>dosing,</b> and the lowest retention occurred after oral dosing. Following a single oral dose, {{almost all of the}} 103 Pd and 191 Pt was excreted in the feces due to nonabsorption, whereas after <b>intravenous</b> <b>dosing,</b> similar quantities were excreted in both the urine and feces.

25|$|The usual <b>intravenous</b> <b>dose</b> is 10–20 mEq {{per hour}} and it is given slowly since it takes time for the {{electrolyte}} to equilibrate into the cells. When used in state-sanctioned lethal injection, bolus potassium injection affects the electrical conduction of heart muscle. Elevated potassium, or hyperkalemia, causes the resting electrical potential of the heart muscle cells to be lower than normal (less negative). Without this negative resting potential, cardiac cells cannot repolarize (prepare for their next contraction).|$|E
25|$|The {{half-life}} of moxifloxacin is 11.5-15.6 hours (single-dose, oral). About 45% of an oral or <b>intravenous</b> <b>dose</b> of moxifloxacin is excreted as {{unchanged drug}} (about 20% in urine and 25% in feces). A total of 96 ± 4% of an oral dose is excreted as either unchanged drug or known metabolites. The mean (± SD) apparent {{total body clearance}} and renal clearance are 12 ± 2L/h and 2.6 ± 0.5L/h, respectively. The CSF penetration of moxifloxacin is 70% to 80% in patients with meningitis.|$|E

25|$|Intravenous {{administration}} {{is the most}} reliable and rapid way to accomplish euthanasia, so can be safely recommended. A coma is first induced by intravenous administration of 20 mg/kg sodium thiopental in a small volume (10 ml physiological saline). Then, a triple <b>intravenous</b> <b>dose</b> of a nondepolarizing neuromuscular muscle relaxant is given, such as 20 mg pancuronium bromide or 20 mg vecuronium bromide (Norcuron). The muscle relaxant should preferably be given intravenously, to ensure optimal availability. Only for pancuronium dibromide, the agent may also be given intramuscularly in a dose of 40 mg.|$|E
25|$|Following on, Laborit {{considered}} whether chlorpromazine {{may have}} a role in managing patients with severe burns, Raynaud's phenomenon, or psychiatric disorders. At the Villejuif Mental Hospital in November 1951, he and Montassut administered an <b>intravenous</b> <b>dose</b> to psychiatrist Cornelia Quarti who was acting as a volunteer. Quarti noted the indifference, but fainted upon getting up to go to the toilet, and so further testing was discontinued (orthostatic hypotension is a possible side effect of chlorpromazine). Despite this, Laborit continued to push for testing in psychiatric patients during early 1952. Psychiatrists were reluctant initially, but on January 19, 1952, it was administered (alongside pethidine, pentothal and ECT) to Jacques Lh. a 24-year-old manic patient, who responded dramatically, and was discharged after three weeks having received 855mg of the drug in total.|$|E
2500|$|Respiratory {{depression}} {{is the most}} serious adverse reaction associated with opioid use, but it usually is seen {{with the use of a}} single, <b>intravenous</b> <b>dose</b> in an opioid-naïve patient. [...] In patients taking opioids regularly for pain relief, tolerance to respiratory depression occurs rapidly, so that it is not a clinical problem. Several drugs have been developed which can partially block respiratory depression, although the only respiratory stimulant currently approved for this purpose is doxapram, which has only limited efficacy in this application. Newer drugs such as BIMU-8 and CX-546 may be much more effective.|$|E

50|$|In {{people who}} do not require {{hospitalization}} and live in an area where there is a low prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, an oral fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin is an appropriate initial choice for therapy. In areas where there is a higher prevalence of fluoroquinolone resistance, it is useful to initiate treatment with a single <b>intravenous</b> <b>dose</b> of a long-acting antibiotic such as ceftriaxone or an aminoglycoside, and then continuing treatment with an oral fluoroquinolone. Oral trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is an appropriate choice for therapy if the uropathogen is known to be susceptible.
