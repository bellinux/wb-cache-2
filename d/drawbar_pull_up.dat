40|$|This article aims to {{experimentally}} {{determine how}} the tractor’s weight distribution changes during loading by <b>drawbar</b> <b>pull,</b> and how the tractor’s weight affects its <b>drawbar</b> <b>pull</b> properties. Drive wheel ballasting has {{a significant effect on}} the <b>drawbar</b> <b>pull</b> and wheel slip of the tractor - travelling gear losses. To achieve these objectives, we conducted experimental measurements on the tractor Case IH Magnum 370 CVX. The results show that higher <b>drawbar</b> <b>pull</b> is achieved in tractors with a higher weight. The measured increase of <b>drawbar</b> <b>pull</b> was 15, 8 kN between maximal and minimal weight (∆ 2320 kg). All variants show an equal percentage increase in the weight on the rear axle of the tractor (+ 6 %). Increasing the tractor’s weight affected the <b>drawbar</b> <b>pull</b> as well as the wheel slip. As the tractor’s weight increases, there is a smaller increase in wheel slip as the <b>drawbar</b> <b>pull</b> increases.

40|$|Abstract — The {{wheels of}} {{planetary}} rovers {{that are used}} in space explorations sometimes slip or lose contact with the ground while traversing a sandy terrain. In order to estimate the behavior of these rovers moving on loose soil, it is very im-portant to accurately estimate the <b>drawbar</b> <b>pull</b> of their wheels. Some wheel-soil interaction models based on terramechanics have been proposed for the estimation of the normal stress distribution and <b>drawbar</b> <b>pull</b> of such rovers. However, our experimental results (normal stress distributions are directly measured using a pressure sensor array, which is attached to the wheels of a rover) show that the distribution range of normal stress for small wheeled rovers obtained using the proposed method is considerably smaller than that obtained by using conventional method. Consequently, the <b>drawbar</b> <b>pull</b> estimated using conventional methods is inaccurate. Therefore, in this study, the normal stress distribution is directly measured using pressure sensors in order to estimate <b>drawbar</b> <b>pull</b> accurately. From the data obtained using the sensors, a soil parameter, which is generally very difficult to measure, is estimated. Then, the <b>drawbar</b> <b>pull</b> is estimated using this parameter. The <b>drawbar</b> <b>pull</b> estimated by using the proposed method is more accurate than that estimated using conventional methods. In this study, we propose a new method for the estimation of <b>drawbar</b> <b>pull</b> and also validate this method. I...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} wheeled vehicles traversing unknown terrain, and proposes {{an approach}} for identifying the unknown soil parameters required for vehicle driving force prediction (<b>drawbar</b> <b>pull</b> prediction). The predicted <b>drawbar</b> <b>pull</b> can potentially be employed for traversability prediction, traction control, and trajectory following which, in turn, improve overall performance of off-road wheeled vehicles.

With few measurements of wheel slip, i, vehicle sinkage, z, and <b>drawbar</b> <b>pull,</b> DP, samples, the algorithm is capable of identifying all the soil parameters required to predict vehicle driving forces over an entire range of wheel slip. The algorithm is validated with experimental data from a wheel-terrain interaction test rig. The identified soil parameters are used to predict the <b>drawbar</b> <b>pull</b> with good accuracy.

40|$|The {{scientific}} and effective prediction of <b>drawbar</b> <b>pull</b> {{is of great}} importance {{in the evaluation of}} military vehicle trafficability. Nevertheless, the existing prediction models have demonstrated lots of inherent limitations. In this framework, a multiple-kernel relevance vector machine model (MkRVM) including Gaussian kernel and polynomial kernel is proposed to predict <b>drawbar</b> <b>pull.</b> Nonlinear decreasing inertia weight particle swarm optimization (NDIWPSO) is employed for parameter optimization. As the relations between <b>drawbar</b> <b>pull</b> and its influencing factors have not been tested on real vehicles, a series of experimental analyses based on real vehicle test data are done to confirm the effective influencing factors. A dynamic testing system is applied to conduct field tests and gain required test data. Gaussian kernel RVM, polynomial kernel RVM, support vector machine (SVM) and generalized regression neural network (GRNN) are also used to compare with the MkRVM model. The results indicate that the MkRVM model is a preferable model in this case. Finally, the proposed novel model is compared to the traditional prediction model of <b>drawbar</b> <b>pull.</b> The results show that the MkRVM model significantly improves the prediction accuracy.

30|$|The problem is, when a rover with rigid wheels {{traverses}} loose soil, {{there is}} a possibility of extremely bad traction conditions. This means that slipping and sinking behaviors can occur. The wheels of the MER was sinking into the soil and could not move; a situation that is not easily rectified. When the rovers are traversing loose soil, we have to consider the condition of the ground under the wheels. The relation between the wheel and loose soil can be described using Terramechanics [4]. Using terramechanics, the entrance angle, which can indicate the depth that the wheel is sinking into the soil, is used to lead the <b>drawbar</b> <b>pull.</b> Many researchers are studied about Terramechanics [5]–[8]. Ding et al. summarized the most recent work on Terramechanics [9]. It is necessary to understand the range of the contacting angle between the wheel and loose soil for the derivation of <b>drawbar</b> <b>pull.</b> The contacting angle is shown using the entrance angle and the leaving angle. If the entrance angle can be detected while the rovers are traversing, the <b>drawbar</b> <b>pull</b> and the sinkage can be derived “real time”.

40|$|Improving the {{mobility}} of tracked vehicles in deep snow requires {{an increase in the}} knowledge and understanding of the design parameters which influence the tractive performance. This relates particularly to the new vehicle requirements of increased payload to vehicle weight ratio, improved fuel economy and reduced life cycle costs. It has been the aim of the research presented in this thesis to improve the understanding of how different vehicle design parameters affect the tractive performance of tracked vehicles in deep snow. A new tracked vehicle was developed to enable experimental studies of different vehicle design parameters in deep snow. The vehicle was skid steered with a hydrostatic transmission and driven by a five-cylinder diesel engine. The vehicle design made it possible to vary several vehicle design parameters in the field, one at a time, without affecting the others. To be able to compare vehicle tests from different snow conditions and also to be able to simulate vehicle performance in snow, the strength properties of the snow are required. A bevameter was developed to characterise the pressure-sinkage relationship, the response to unloading- reloading and the shear stress-shear displacement of the snow. The idea of using the bevameter technique was to measure the terrain data under loading conditions similar to those encountered by an off-road vehicle. The bevameter developed consisted of a hydraulic cylinder with a piston of one metre stroke through the cylinder. A hydraulic motor with a planetary gear was attached to {{the upper end of the}} rod piston, which exerted the turning torque in the shear test. The cylinder exerted the normal force in both the pressure-sinkage and the shear test. The most important finding was that the <b>drawbar</b> <b>pull</b> strongly increased when the initial rear track angle was reduced. This was due to both an increased thrust between the tracks and the snow and to a reduced track motion resistance. The increased performance originated from a reduced load transfer from the last roadwheel to the others when the initial rear track angle was reduced. The tractive performance increased continuously with decreasing initial rear track angle. The tractive performance not only increased when the idler made contact with the snow, thus increasing the track contact length, but increased continuously with a decrease in the initial rear track angle prior to the idler contacting the snow. Another important finding was that the <b>drawbar</b> <b>pull</b> increased when the centre of gravity was moved forward, especially when the idler was in the elevated position. An increased belly ground clearance and a reduced initial angle of the vehicle belly both provided improved mobility performance of the vehicle. This was due to both increased thrust and reduced belly resistance, which in both cases, originated from a vertical load transfer from the rear of the belly to the tracks. The experimental tests of the influence of the initial rear track angle on the tractive performance were compared with corresponding simulations using the Nepean Tracked Vehicle Performance Model for Microsoft Windows, (NTVPMwin). The simulation also showed an increased <b>drawbar</b> <b>pull</b> when the initial rear track angle was reduced.
