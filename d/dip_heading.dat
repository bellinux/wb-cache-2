50|$|The HBT showing neophilia is also controversial. Since animals show {{decreased}} <b>head</b> <b>dipping,</b> scientists {{conclude that}} it {{is a result of the}} animal becoming less fearful. However other studies have shown that after the amount of time with decreased <b>head</b> <b>dipping,</b> <b>head</b> <b>dipping</b> actually starts to increase meaning that animals might have gotten bored with the area and are now exploring the holes.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the hyper excitability caused by administration of Fluoxetine which is a highly prescribed antidepressant belonging to a Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor class. Behavioral activities were observed on Cage Crossing, Forced Swim Test, Open Field Test and <b>Head</b> <b>Dip</b> Test. These activities were observed on rodents after 60 days of oral Fluoxetine treatment and were compared with untreated control animals. The results clearly showed that Fluoxetine caused significant increase in number of <b>head</b> <b>dips</b> in <b>head</b> <b>dip</b> test, significant increase in number of cage crosses in cage crossing, significant increase in number of squares crossed in an open field apparatus and significant increase in struggling time in forced swim test. Thus overall results indicated hyper excitability in treated animals. Hence, outcomes suggest that Fluoxetine can lead to hyper excitation in behavior and produce anxiety and therefore strongly implies that Fluoxetine use may also require an anxiolytic drug to antagonize this hyper excitability...|$|R

60|$|The {{first thing}} noticed {{was that the}} birds were acting queerly, <b>dipping</b> their <b>heads</b> under water and keeping them there for a full minute or more at a time. That was also curious, for the water under them was too deep for feeding, and the eiders prefer to wait till the tide falls and then gather the exposed {{shellfish}} from the rocks, rather than to dive after them like a coot. Darkness came on speedily to hide the birds, who were still <b>dipping</b> their <b>heads</b> as if bewitched, and I went away no wiser for my watching.|$|R

After saluting him, I lit a cigarette, and, leaning on the neck of my horse, watched his efforts for some time with profound interest. He toiled away in silence for five or six minutes, then <b>dipped</b> his <b>head</b> in the water again, and, while carefully wringing the wet out, he remarked that my horse looked tired.|$|R
40|$|Anxiety is {{unpleasant}} {{feeling of}} apprehension or fearful concern. The disability and health costs caused by anxiety disorders {{are comparable to}} those of other common medical conditions such as, diabetes, arthritis or hypertension. According to various literatures available on Benincasa hispida, the present study was undertaken for evaluation of anxiolytic activity of alcoholic extract of Benincasa hispida on various behavioural models. A different dose of extract was tested on models like OFT, Hole Board and Mirror chamber. The medium and high dose (200 and 400 mg/kg b. w.) caused significant increase in central locomotion, while Numbers of rearings, Immobility time, Grooming time, Defecation and urination were not significantly reduced in OFT model. In Hole-board model, significant increase in latency to the 1 st <b>head</b> <b>dips,</b> number of <b>head</b> <b>dips</b> and time spent in <b>head</b> <b>dips</b> was observed. But in mirror chamber model, reduced latency to enter the mirrored chamber and increased both the number of entries; as well as the time spent in the mirrored chamber was noted.

30|$|In HBT, head-dipping is {{generally}} considered {{as a measure of}} exploitation which is somehow distinct from the motor activity. An increase count of <b>head</b> <b>dips</b> compared to control is considered as anxiolytic-like effect. HBT was performed in a box (40 [*]×[*] 40 [*]×[*] 25  cm) made by wood with 16 equidistant holes (D- 3  cm) was used in this experiment. Apparatus was kept at 35  cm above from the ground [14]. Mice were selected and grouped into 4 groups randomly (each group consists of 5 mice) and administered different samples accordingly. Mouse was kept on board, and its movement and <b>head</b> <b>dipping</b> in the hole was counted for 5  min duration. A single head-dip was counted when a mouse put into the hole at least up to the eye level; repeated dips into same hole were not consider as countable <b>head</b> <b>dips</b> if they can’t be separated by locomotion.|$|R

40|$|High novelty seeking is {{a complex}} {{personality}} attribute correlated with risk for substance abuse. There are many putative mouse models of some aspects of novelty seeking, but little is known of genetic similarities among these models. To assess the genetic coherence of “novelty seeking,” we compared the performance of 14 inbred strains of mice in five tests: activity in a novel environment, novel environment preference, <b>head</b> <b>dipping</b> on a hole-board, object preference, and a two-trial version of the spontaneous alternation task. Differences among strains were observed for all tasks, but performance in any given task was generally not predictive of performance in any other. To evaluate similarities among these tasks further, we selectively bred lines of mice for high or low <b>head</b> <b>dipping</b> on the hole-board. Similar to results from the inbred strain experiments, <b>head</b> <b>dipping</b> was not correlated with performance in the other measures but was genetically correlated with differences in locomotor activity. Using two approaches to estimating common genetic influences across tasks, we have found little evidence that these partial models of novelty seeking reflect the influence of common genes or measure a single, unified construct called novelty seeking. Based on the substantial influence of genetic factors, ease of implementation, and relative independence from general locomotion, <b>head</b> <b>dipping</b> on a hole-board is a good task {{to use in the}} domain of novelty seeking, but multiple tasks, including others not tested here, would be needed to capture the full genetic range of the behavioral domain...|$|R
