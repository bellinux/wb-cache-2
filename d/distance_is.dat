5|$|Storm {{spotters}} {{are trained}} to discern whether a storm seen from a <b>distance</b> <b>is</b> a supercell. They typically look to its rear, the main region of updraft and inflow. Under the updraft is a rain-free base, and the next step of tornadogenesis is {{the formation of a}} rotating wall cloud. The vast majority of intense tornadoes occur with a wall cloud on the backside of a supercell.|$|E

5000|$|The racing {{distance}} of the Hong Kong Derby has varied over the years. From 2000 to present, the <b>distance</b> has <b>been</b> 2000 metres, with the starting point {{in front of the}} Sha Tin grandstand. From 1977 to 1999, the race was held over 1800m.

5|$|Damping {{occurs at}} two {{different}} scales, {{with the process}} working more quickly over short ranges than over longer distances. Here, a short length {{is one that is}} lower than the mean free path of the photons. A long <b>distance</b> <b>is</b> one that is greater than the mean free path, if still less than the diffusion length. On the smaller scale, perturbations are damped almost instantaneously. On the larger scale, anisotropies are decreased more slowly, with significant degradation happening within one unit of Hubble time.|$|E
5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} {{arc welding}} uses a constant current power source, {{meaning that the}} current (and thus the heat) remains relatively constant, even if the arc distance and voltage change. This is important because most applications of GTAW are manual or semiautomatic, requiring that an operator hold the torch. Maintaining a suitably steady arc <b>distance</b> <b>is</b> difficult if a constant voltage power source is used instead, since it can cause dramatic heat variations and make welding more difficult.|$|E
5|$|If {{a spider}} walks under a P. schultzi female's capture web and the {{vertical}} <b>distance</b> <b>is</b> less than 8centimetres, the P. schultzi often drops onto the prey {{too fast for}} a human eye to follow. If the P. schultzi misses, it quickly returns up its safety line to its vantage point and looks for another chance - and seldom misses the second time. Most drops cover two to four centimetres, as longer drops are often obstructed by the web.|$|E
5000|$|The first universally {{accepted}} record was in 1876 when the American Frank Dodds rode 26.508 km on a penny-farthing. The first recorded <b>distance</b> <b>was</b> set in 1873 by James Moore in Wolverhampton, riding an Ariel 49" [...] high wheel bicycle, however, the <b>distance</b> <b>was</b> recorded at exactly 14.5 miles {{leading to the}} theory that the <b>distance</b> <b>was</b> just approximated and not accurately measured.|$|R

5|$|In {{the case}} of the weak interaction, fermions can {{exchange}} three distinct types of force carriers known as the W+, W−, and Z bosons. The mass of each of these bosons is far greater than the mass of a proton or neutron, which is consistent with the short range of the weak force. The force is in fact termed weak because its field strength over a given <b>distance</b> <b>is</b> typically several orders of magnitude less than that of the strong nuclear force or electromagnetic force.|$|E
5|$|Lance Murdoch is {{a parody}} of famous daredevils such as Evel Knievel and Matt Murdock, the alter ego of the Marvel Comics superhero Daredevil.

A departure from Ivy's previous studio albums Realistic (1995) and Apartment Life (1997), Long Distance was influenced by new wave, but maintained Ivy's signature blend of indie pop and indie rock music. Ivy collaborated with long-time producer Peter Nashel {{for two of the}} album's tracks, while the rest were written and produced entirely by members Andy Chase and Adam Schlesinger.|$|E
5|$|One {{of the key}} {{elements}} of Dream Drop <b>Distance</b> <b>is</b> {{the inclusion of the}} Dream Eaters. Whilst they generally serve as the main enemies of the game, up to three good Dream Eaters, known as Spirits, can be recruited per character to assist them in battle. Spirits can be created by combining Dream Fragments together with an item or spell, either via experimenting with combinations or using recipes found throughout the game. Characters can also link with Spirits to perform unique attacks. Along the way, the player can care for these Spirits by petting them, feeding them items, or playing mini-games with them, which can unlock new abilities for the Spirits.|$|E

5|$|Outer {{space is}} a {{convenient}} setting {{for measuring the}} speed of light because of its large scale and nearly perfect vacuum. Typically, one measures the time needed for light to traverse some reference distance in the solar system, such as the radius of the Earth's orbit. Historically, such measurements could be made fairly accurately, compared to how accurately the length of the reference <b>distance</b> <b>is</b> known in Earth-based units. It is customary to express the results in astronomical units (AU) per day.|$|E
5|$|Slow lorises have a {{round head}} because their skull is shorter {{than in other}} living strepsirrhine. Like other lorisids, its snout does not taper towards {{the front of the}} face as it does in lemurs, making the face appear less long and pointed. Compared to the slender lorises, the snout of the slow loris is even less pointed. As with other members of Lorisidae, its interorbital <b>distance</b> <b>is</b> shorter than in lemurs. The skull has {{prominent}} crests (ridges of bone). A distinguishing feature of the slow loris skull is that the occipital bone is flattened and faces backward. The foramen magnum (hole through which the spinal cord enters) faces directly backward. The brains of slow lorises have more folds (convolutions) than the brains of galagos.|$|E
5|$|The IEEE 802.3af Power over Ethernet (PoE) {{standard}} specifies a {{more elaborate}} power negotiation scheme than powered USB. It operates at 48VDC and can supply more power (up to 12.95W, PoE+ 25.5W) over a cable up to 100meters compared to USB2.0, which provides 2.5W {{with a maximum}} cable length of 5meters. This has made PoE popular for VoIP telephones, security cameras, wireless access points, and other networked devices within buildings. However, USB is cheaper than PoE provided that the <b>distance</b> <b>is</b> short and power demand is low.|$|E

5|$|The crystal {{structure}} of octaphenylrhodocene shows a staggered conformation (similar {{to that of}} ferrocene, and {{in contrast to the}} eclipsed conformation of ruthenocene). The rhodium–centroid <b>distance</b> <b>is</b> 1.904Å and the rhodium–carbon bond lengths average 2.26Å; the carbon–carbon bond lengths average 1.44Å. These distances are all similar to those found in the 1,2,3-tri-tert-butylrhodocenium cation described above, with the one difference that the effective size of the rhodium centre appears larger, an observation consistent with the expanded ionic radius of rhodium(II) compared with rhodium(III).|$|E
5|$|The {{distance}} to the Pleiades {{can be used as}} an important first step to calibrate the cosmic distance ladder. As the cluster is so close to the Earth, its <b>distance</b> <b>is</b> relatively easy to measure and has been estimated by many methods. Accurate knowledge of the distance allows astronomers to plot a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for the cluster, which, when compared to those plotted for clusters whose <b>distance</b> <b>is</b> not known, allows their distances to be estimated. Other methods can then extend the distance scale from open clusters to galaxies and clusters of galaxies, and a cosmic distance ladder can be constructed. Ultimately astronomers' understanding of the age and future evolution of the universe is influenced by their knowledge of the {{distance to}} the Pleiades. Yet some authors argue that the controversy over the {{distance to the}} Pleiades discussed below is a red herring, since the cosmic distance ladder can (presently) rely on a suite of other nearby clusters where consensus exists regarding the distances as established by Hipparcos and independent means (e.g., the Hyades, Coma Berenices cluster, etc.).|$|E
5|$|The {{most stable}} and dense form of {{selenium}} is gray {{and has a}} hexagonal crystal lattice consisting of helical polymeric chains, where the Se-Se <b>distance</b> <b>is</b> 237.3pm and Se-Se-Se angle is 130.1°. The minimum distance between chains is 343.6pm. Gray Se is formed by mild heating of other allotropes, by slow cooling of molten Se, or by condensing Se vapor just below the melting point. Whereas other Se forms are insulators, gray Se is a semiconductor showing appreciable photoconductivity. Unlike the other allotropes, it is insoluble in CS2. It resists oxidation by air and is not attacked by nonoxidizing acids. With strong reducing agents, it forms polyselenides. Selenium does not exhibit the changes in viscosity that sulfur undergoes when gradually heated.|$|E
