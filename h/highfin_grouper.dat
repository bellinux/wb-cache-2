5000|$|Pseudorhabdosynochus auitoe {{is part of}} {{a series}} of eight species of Pseudorhabdosynochus with similar names. All these species are {{parasitic}} on the <b>Highfin</b> <b>grouper,</b> Epinephelus maculatus. According to the author, names of the new species have been formed on the base of [...] "uitoe", the local name of the host, the <b>Highfin</b> <b>grouper,</b> and letters a-h, in accordance to International Code of Zoological Nomenclature articles 57.6 (one-letter difference) and 32.5.2.4.4 (no punctuation). The eight species sharing this etymology are P. auitoe, P. buitoe, P. cuitoe, P. duitoe, P. euitoe, P. fuitoe, P. guitoe, and P. huitoe.|$|E
40|$|Laticola dae n. sp. is {{described}} from specimens {{collected from the}} gill-filaments of the <b>highfin</b> <b>grouper</b> Epinephelus maculatus, a coral reef fish caught off Noumea, New Caledonia, South Pacific. The species is characterised by a spoon-shaped sclerotised male copulatory organ, with four thin walls and 73 - 108 mu m in outer length, and a sclerotised vagina in form of a disc, 16 - 22 mu m in diameter, with a smaller hemisphere on one side. Laticola Yang et al., 2006 was described to accommodate diplectanids from Lates calcarifer (Centropomidae); {{this is the first}} Laticola described from a serranid. Other diplectanids, including several species of Pseudorhabdosynochus Yamaguti, 1958, were also found on the same species of fish; specimens of L. dae represented about half of the diplectanids collected; all other species were rare...|$|E
40|$|Nine {{species were}} {{identified}} among 1500 monogeneans {{collected on the}} gills of 17 speckled blue groupers, Epinephelus cyanopodus, caught off New Caledonia, South Pacific. A new method for describing squamodiscs in tables is proposed. Diplectanids included one new species of Laticola, which was the most abundant species, and six species of Pseudorhabdosynochus, including four new species, which were differentiated mainly {{on the basis of}} morphology of the sclerotised vagina. Laticola cyanus n. sp. is characterised by its genital organs. Pseudorhabdosynochus cyanopodus n. sp. and P. podocyanus n. sp. both have a vagina with a large primary chamber. Pseudorhabdosynochus chauveti n. sp. has a vagina with a long, coiled primary canal. Pseudorhabdosynochus exoticus n. sp. has an aberrant discoid vagina and characters (tip of quadriloculate organ, lateral bar with hook), which differentiate it from all other species. The five previously cited species are strictly specific to E. cyanopodus and were abundant in large (> 585 mm) fish. In addition, Haliotrema sp. (Ancyrocephalidae) and Allobenedenia sp. (Capsalidae), both undescribed, were also found on large fish. Pseudorhabdosynochus duitoe Justine, 2007 and P. huitoe Justine, 2007, were collected in very small numbers, mainly in young (345 - 500 mm) fish; the type-host of these two species is the <b>highfin</b> <b>grouper,</b> E. maculatus, and their occurrence on E. cyanopodus was considered accidental and due to habitat overlap between the young speckled blue groupers and adult highfin groupers. It is hypothesized that the speckled blue groupers are infested by their own, strictly specific monogeneans, only when they encounter older members of their species during spawning aggregations. Spawning aggregations thus {{play a key role in}} infestation of coral reef fish by their monoxenic parasites such as monogeneans. Lists are given for other parasites of the speckled blue grouper, including digeneans, cestodes, nematodes, isopods and copepods, with new records from New Caledonia: 41 species of parasites are recorded...|$|E
