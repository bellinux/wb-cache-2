The buildings created according to those methods include Shukhov Tower (hyperbolic steel gridshell), the famous Philips Pavilion (1958) designed by Iannis Xenakis and Le Corbusier, the beautiful buildings constructed by Félix Candela using <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>paraboloid</b> <b>structure,</b> John F. Kennedy (JFK) Airport designed by architect Eero Saarinen, Geodesic Domes by R. Buckminster Fuller, Sydney Opera House by Jorn Utzon, striking constructions by the famous Swiss engineer Heinz Isler, the bus terminal by Eladio Dieste, seaside pavilions by the East German engineer Ulrich Muther and many other well-known buildings.|$|E
5000|$|Frederickson Field House 20000 sq ft {{facility}} {{was at the}} time of its construction (1959) the largest <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>paraboloid</b> <b>structure</b> on earth. The Frederickson construction company was in fact a pioneering company in the design and building of extremely thin-shell concrete buildings, of which Frederickson Field House was one. Another famous thin-shell conrete structure built by John Henry Frederickson was the First Christian Church, also in Oklahoma City. That building has an [...] "eggshell" [...] shaped roof that is actually thinner (in proportion) that a real eggshell.The Frederickson Field house venue held 3,400 for basketball. Asked why the scoreboard at the Field House was the first one to have a three digit placement for the team scores, Abe Lemons, the coach at the time, said come to the first game and you will find out. Teams rarely scored in the 100s at the time (late 1950s) but in the first game at the Field House OCU beat Florida State Univ by scoring 129 points in the game. The Chiefs were to be one on the highest scoring teams in the country, scoring over 100 points a game on many occasions. A Division I team the OCU teams were an Independent team until joining the Midwestern City Conference, now known as the Horizon League. OCU dropped to NAIA status in 1985. It was replaced with the more modern Henry J. Freede Wellness and Activities Center in 2000, and torn down in 2005.|$|E
5000|$|The Mausoleum {{of three}} leaders was {{established}} in the year 1963. It was built by architects Masood Ahmed and S.A. Zahiruddin. The Mausoleum of three leaders consists of a <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>paraboloid</b> <b>structure</b> that is erected over the three graves of the three political leaders. The three political leaders being A.K. Fazlul Huq, Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy and Khawaja Nazimuddin. The three leaders had died in separate dates but were all buried in the same area as all three of them had contributed significantly to East Pakistan and were all involved politically.A.K. Fazlul Huq was a very well known politician who was famous for his leadership qualities. One of his most important contributions was being involved with the Bengali Language Movement. Fazlul Huq along with Huseyn Suhrawardy had engaged in many political acts such as forming the United Front in the 1954 elections, with which they had gained victory by winning the most seats. Huseyn Suhrawardy and Fazlul Huq had also worked together to control the government of East Pakistan. However, it was rumored that Suhrawardy and Fazlul Huq had rivalry between them which had caused Fazul Huq to step down from politics.Suhrawardy was known to be the founder of the Bangladesh Awami League. He was also known to contribute significantly to the growth and development of East Pakistan. Suhrawardy became the Prime Minister of Pakistan in 1956 but was forced to resign in 1957. He was completely banned from politics by Ayub Khan (President of Pakistan).Khawaja Nazimuddin was the Prime Minister of Pakistan from 1951 to 1953. Suhrawardy had served as the Minister of Labor and also the Minister of Civil Supplies under Khawaja Nazimuddin.Even with all these achievements, it was rumored that these three political leaders had a rivalry with each other in terms of success. However, despite their rivalry, three of the political leaders were buried under the same roof of the mausoleum of the three leaders.|$|E

50|$|Apache Plaza has {{historic}} significance {{because it}} was one of the first enclosed malls in the US, opening in 1961. It was the second such center in the state of Minnesota, after Southdale. Its design, by architect Willard Thorsen, was state-of-the-art at the time. Apache had a spacious center court with a <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>paraboloid</b> roof (hyperboloid <b>structure).</b> The <b>paraboloids</b> were concrete shells, shaped like an inverted umbrella. Ten of these paraboloids made up the roof of the center court, which was ringed with Mondrian-inspired clerestory windows. The mall had more than 60 stores at its height, as well as a large monthly indoor antiques and collectables show and a bowling alley in the basement. In the early 1970s, the mall was still thriving, despite the opening of nearby Rosedale. The larger mall would contribute to the Apache's decline, with the relocation of the Apache's anchor stores to Rosedale.|$|R
50|$|These {{properties}} characterize <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>paraboloids</b> and {{are used}} {{in one of the}} oldest definitions of hyperbolic paraboloids: a <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>paraboloid</b> is a surface that may be generated by a moving line that is parallel to a fixed plane and crosses two fixed skew lines.

5000|$|A <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>paraboloid</b> (not to be {{confused}} with a hyperboloid) is a doubly ruled surface shaped like a saddle.
