40|$|Aerodynamic {{flow control}} in a cyclone is {{critical}} to its performance. Dust accumulation in a multi-cyclone is undesirable. This research investigated, the effects of laser-patterned Ethylene-Propylene-Diene Monomer (EPDM) roof in a commercial multi-cyclone system on its aerodynamic and dust accumulation characteristics. Our experimental data show that strategically designed concentric micro-dimples on the cyclone roof can improve both the aerodynamic performance and dust separation capability in the multi-cyclone system. With specific laser-patterned cyclone roof, up to 78 % reduction in dust adhesion was demonstrated {{in one of the}} cones (cone 9). With the 315 -μm diameter micro-dimples on EPDM roof, it was observed that dimples located close to the vortex finder caused an increase in the reverse airflows in the cyclone, thereby effecting entrainment of dust. The overall <b>dust</b> <b>separation</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the multi-cyclone system was at an average of 99. 9 % with the laser-textured roof, hence no adverse effect on the original cyclone system, in spite of the reported improvements in dust adhesion reduction...|$|E
40|$|The {{increase}} {{of renewable energy}} by combustion of biofuel will likely {{lead to an increase}} in the use of biofuels with high ash content. These fuels are more demanding from a combustion perspective. To facilitate combustion of these fuels in small combustion devices (50 kW – a few MW), there is a need of inexpensive dust cleaning devices. This is urgent to facilitate increased biofuel combustion without counteraction with the Swedish environmental goal Clean Air (which contain goals for particles in the air). Electrostatic filters for dust cleaning at heat and power plants are well established. However, the cost of these filters is often expensive to bear for a small plant. A few electrostatic filters for residential applications are available, but the experience is limited. In the capacity-area in between, i. e. small district heating plants, it is of special importance to find new cheap alternatives for an improved dust cleaning. The Norwegian company Applied Plasma Physics (APP) have products for dust- and odour-cleaning. APP also has the electrostatic filter called R_ESP (Residential Electrostatic Precipitator) for combustion of wood close to commercially available. The purpose of this report is to evaluate the electrostatic filter R_ESP at combustion of biofuels rich in ash, and by this contribute to increased knowledge about electrostatic precipitation at small-scale applications. A sub-goal is to separate 85 % of the particles in the flue gas. Experimental tests were performed at SP’s Energy laboratory. R_ESP was mounted downstream of a chimney, which was mounted on a multi-stoker/boiler. The multi-stoker has a nominal heat output of 65 kW at combustion of wood pellets. In this project pellets of bark or reed canary grass were fired. <b>Dust</b> <b>separation</b> <b>efficiency</b> over the R_ESP with respect to number concentration and size distribution was tested for several powers of the filter, during combustion of the two fuels. Combustion of bark was selected for a longer time test with respect to separation efficiency by particle mass. Number concentration and size distribution were measured in real time using an electrical low pressure impactor (ELPI) and mass concentration was measured by filter sampling. The combustion conditions were favourable, with low concentrations of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. The number concentration of particles was 2. 5 · 107 #/cmN 3 and 1. 9 · #/cmN 3 (normalised to 10 % O 2) at combustion of reed canary grass and bark respectively. The results show that the technique of R_ESP works well for cleaning of particles from efficient combustion of the ash-rich fuels reed canary grass and bark. The combustion device was run at 20 kW, which is a thermal output that may be present at a farm or a school. For such an application the existing R_ESP may be tested in field, but for larger plants a certain product development is needed. The objective to separate 85 % of the particles was reached at normal operation of the filter (60 W). Lowering the effect of the filter, {{a large part of the}} dust separation is maintained and at 20 W the separation was about 80 %. At combustion of bark a two-day test of dust separation with respect to mass was performed. It showed on a <b>dust</b> <b>separation</b> <b>efficiency</b> of 82 % at 30 W power of the electrostatic filter...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCyclone {{separators}} {{are widely}} used in the gas solid separation processes. Their dimensions and configurations have a great influence on their performance {{and they have been}} widely studied in literature. In this research, the impacts of using a ceramic wear liner inside the wall of a special dust collector cyclone, installed in the Golgohar mining and industrial company in Iran, is investigated. In this research some numerical calculations and software analysis, based on the CFD, have been carried out and the results have been compared with the results of the practical tests and recorded data. This comparison shows the conformity {{of the results of the}} practical tests and the calculated results. In this research, the flow is a two-phase, gas-solid, type and the collision of the solid materials, which are mainly iron material with 200 ∼ 700 micron dimensions, with the cyclone wall will increase the erosion. Therefore, to reduce the erosion a special ceramic wear liner is used as a protective layer for cyclone wall. Adding this protective layer has changed the geometry of the cyclone wall from different aspects; so the impacts of this type of liner on the performance and the separation efficiency of the dust collector cyclone should be investigated. The dilute two phase flow inside a cyclone is simulated using an Euler-Lagrange hybrid method. The gas phase is governed by the Navier-Stokes equations. This investigation can be a starting point for more research that can be result in producing more appropriate and efficient cyclones. For more accuracy, the comparison have been done for different speed of flow and the results show that this liner has a negative impact on the <b>dust</b> <b>separation</b> <b>efficiency</b> in this cyclone...|$|E

Cylindrical cyclone separators are popular in the industrial process due to the advantage that they are simple, compact, and inexpensive to manufacture.

40|$|For future {{development}} of automated sensor-based sorting in the mining industry, {{an improvement in}} the <b>separation</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the equipment is desirable. This could be achieved through {{a better understanding of}} the identification and separation aspects of the automated sorter. For automated sorters that undertake separation through the use of compressed air jets, the problem of poor <b>separation</b> <b>efficiency</b> has been linked with co-deflection losses. Co-deflection losses occur as particles meant to pass on to the ‘accept’ bin are co-deflected with the particles (which are to be deflected) meant to go to the ‘reject’ bin. To study co-deflection losses and suggest means of improving automated sorter <b>separation</b> <b>efficiency,</b> this research investigates the effects of particle size, shape, throughput, together with the proportion of particles (out of the total test batch) required to be deflected on <b>separation</b> <b>efficiency.</b> The effect of the air valve configuration on <b>separation</b> <b>efficiency</b> was also studied. Presented also is a mathematical model which could be used to predict automated sorter <b>separation</b> <b>efficiency.</b> All <b>separation</b> <b>efficiency</b> investigations were undertaken using a TiTech Combisense© (BSM 063) automated sorter. Samples of granite were sized into - 20 + 15 mm, - 15 + 10 mm and - 10 + 6 mm size fractions and grouped into cubic and flaky shape fractions. These fractions were then divided into two with one portion painted for colour <b>separation</b> <b>efficiency</b> investigations. The <b>separation</b> <b>efficiency</b> results confirmed earlier research indicating that particle size and the fraction requiring deflection affects <b>separation</b> <b>efficiency,</b> with <b>separation</b> <b>efficiency</b> decreasing with a decrease in particle size and an increase in throughput. It was observed that co-deflection loss occurs when correctly identified ‘accept’ particles are co-deflected due to their close proximity to ‘reject’ particles that are to be deflected. Observations from the tests indicate that an increase in the proportion of particles requiring deflection increases the probability of finding ‘accept’ particles in close proximity to ‘reject’ particles leading to co-deflections. Monte Carlo simulations were used to produce a random distribution of particles on the conveyor belt as would be obtained from actual investigations. From these simulations particle proximity relationships and particle co-deflections were studied. Results indicate that the Monte Carlo simulations under-predicts particle proximity associations. The effect of shape on co-deflection was investigated with results indicating that flaky shaped particles produce higher number of co-deflections compared to cubic shaped particles. It was also observed that the valve sensitivity determined from valve opening and closing times is of importance to the selectivity (precision) of the separating air jets. A mathematical <b>separation</b> <b>efficiency</b> model is presented which contains two variables, the belt loading (calculated using particle size, shape and throughput) and the particle fraction of the total test batch that are to be deflected (% deflection).

40|$|ABSTRACT. Solid-liquid {{separation}} of manure {{is a method}} to produce nutrient and dry matter rich fractions with higher volumetric methane potential {{than that of the}} original liquid manure. Centrifugation and chemical precipitation and flocculation are efficient options for such <b>separation.</b> Centrifugation <b>efficiency</b> depends on factors such as manure type, G-force, and dewatering volume, while chemical precipitation and flocculation depend on the amount and type of chemicals and polymers used. We assess all these factors in this study. The methane yields of the solids from centrifugation and precipitation were assessed by batch digestion. Dewatering volume and G-force had great influence on <b>separation</b> <b>efficiency</b> and on the chemical composition of the solids. Centrifugation transferred increasing amounts of nutrients and dry matter to the solid fraction as gravitational force increased to approximately 2200 G.
