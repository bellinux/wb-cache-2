5|$|Attempts {{by three}} tugs from Cardiff {{to remove the}} wreck were unsuccessful, but the next spring tide carried the {{midsection}} up the estuary onto Town Bar, opposite Padstow, where it was a hazard to shipping. A miner named Pope {{was called in to}} remove it: he used gelignite without success, though the explosion was reported to have broken many windows in the town. In 2010 a wreck, identified as almost certainly the Antoinette, surfaced on Town Bar. The Royal Navy Bomb <b>Disposal</b> <b>Unit</b> failed to demolish it and it was marked with a buoy; in March 2011 work started to demolish the remainder of it using saws.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} problem of the {{simultaneous}} design of a distribution etwork with plants and waste <b>disposal</b> <b>units,</b> and the coordination of product flows and waste flows within this network. The objective is to minimize the sum of fixed costs for opening plants and waste <b>disposal</b> <b>units,</b> and variable costs related to product and waste flows. The problem is complicated by (i) capacity constraints on plants and waste <b>disposal</b> <b>units,</b> (ii) service requirements (i. e. production must cover total demand) and (iii) waste, arising from production, to be disposed of at waste <b>disposal</b> <b>units.</b> We discuss alternative mathematical model formulations for the two-level distribution and waste disposal problem with capacity constraints. Lower bounding and upper bounding procedures are analyzed. The bounds are shown to be quite effective when embedded in a standard branch and bound algorithm. Finally, the results of a computational study are reported...|$|R

25|$|The {{assault craft}} {{departed}} from Olterra {{during the early}} hours of 8 December. At 2:15 AM, the first human torpedo reached the area of the boom defences. The motor launches and sentries inside the British base were quietly active and alert, conscious of the danger of a potential attack on the fleet at anchor. One of the security measures taken by the Royal Navy after the summer incursions of combat swimmers was the deployment at Gibraltar of an underwater bomb <b>disposal</b> <b>unit,</b> under the command of Lieutenant Lionel Crabb. A pattern of depth charges was dropped by the motor barges at an interval of three minutes. The craft of Visintini and Magro was apparently hit by one of the charges and destroyed when they were trying to find a breach in the steel net protecting the harbour. Their bodies were recovered by the British some days later and buried at sea with full honors. The second “pig” also endured the strong response of British defences after being uncovered by a searchlight. After a long chase by anti-submarine boats, the Italian crew decided to scuttle their craft and took shelter on board an American freighter. They discarded their swimsuits before submitting themselves to Gibraltar authorities. The last manned torpedo was {{caught in the middle of}} the general alarm across the stronghold, but managed to slip beneath the waters and fool the submarine chasers. The copilot, Leone, became missing during the pursuit and was never found; Cella, meanwhile, abandoned the craft elsewhere, thinking that he was still near Gibraltar or, in the best case, stranded close to the Spanish coast. With the idea of becoming a prisoner of war or being arrested and interned by Spanish authorities in mind, Cella surfaced, only to find that he was just a few meters away from Olterra. His torpedo was recovered by the Italians the following day. The two divers captured by the British told their interrogators that the attack was launched by submarine, successfully deceiving Allied intelligence. Nevertheless, the first human torpedoes mission ended in failure.|$|E

500|$|Beach {{maintained}} that the greatest challenge facing the crew was a seeming mundane activity, garbage disposal and cleaning: [...] "It was 84 days of strenuous work just keeping the ship clean. It was amazing how much dirt we created, so I {{had a field day}} every weekend. The crew started objecting until they saw how much trash we kept getting rid of. Then they couldn't object." [...] To remove trash without surfacing, Triton had a garbage <b>disposal</b> <b>unit</b> (GDU), a small inverted torpedo tube that ejected a weighted bag of refuse through the bottom of the ship. [...] However, if the GDU was temporarily out of commission due to repairs, as it was on 22 February, the after torpedo tubes were used, a less than optimum solution.|$|E

MAB quickly cordoned off the area and quietly diverted the public and passengers to other sections of the KIA complex. With the aid of a Robot Scanner, the Bomb <b>Disposal</b> <b>Unit</b> closed in to check the package and twice blasted it with shotgun pellets. A thorough check by one of the police from the Bomb <b>Disposal</b> <b>Unit</b> in special suit confirmed that the black plastic bag actually contained rubbish.

40|$|For {{purposes}} of the Hanford facility dangerous waste permit application, the US Department of Energy`s contractors are identified as ``co-operators`` and sign in that capacity (refer to Condition I. A. 2. of the Dangerous Waste Portion of the Hanford Facility Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Permit). Any identification of these contractors as an ``operator`` elsewhere in the application {{is not meant to}} conflict with the contractors` designation as co-operators but rather is based on the contractors` contractual status with the U. S. Department of Energy, Richland Operations Office. The Dangerous Waste Portion of the initial Hanford Facility Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Permit, which incorporated five treatment, storage, and/or <b>disposal</b> <b>units,</b> was based on information submitted in the Hanford Facility Dangerous Waste Permit Application and in closure plan and closure/postclosure plan documentation. During 1995, the Dangerous Waste Portion was modified twice to incorporate another eight treatment, storage, and/or disposal units; during 1996, the Dangerous Waste Portion was modified once to incorporate another five treatment, storage, and/or <b>disposal</b> <b>units.</b> The permit modification process will be used at least annually to incorporate additional treatment, storage, and/or <b>disposal</b> <b>units</b> as permitting documentation for these units is finalized. The units to be included in annual modifications are specified in a schedule contained in the Dangerous Waste Portion of the Hanford Facility Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Permit. Treatment, storage, and/or <b>disposal</b> <b>units</b> will remain in interim status until incorporated into the Permit. The Hanford Facility Dangerous Waste Permit Application {{is considered to be a}} single application organized into a General Information Portion (this document, DOE/RL- 91 - 28) and a Unit-Specific Portion. The scope of the Unit-Specific Portion is limited to individual operating treatment, storage, and/or <b>disposal</b> <b>units</b> for which Part B permit application documentation has been, or is anticipated to be, submitted. Documentation for treatment, storage, and/or <b>disposal</b> <b>units</b> undergoing closure, or for units that are, or are anticipated to be, dispositioned through other options, will continue to be submitted by the Permittees in accordance with the provisions of the Hanford Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order. However, the scope of the General Information Portion includes information that could be used to discuss operating units, units undergoing closure, or units being dispositioned through other options. Both the General Information and Unit-Specific portions of the Hanford Facility Dangerous Waste Permit Application address the contents of the Part B permit application guidance documentation prepared by the Washington State Department of Ecology and the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, with additional information needs defined by revisions of Washington Administrative Code 173 - 303 and by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments.
