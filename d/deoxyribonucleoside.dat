50|$|In {{mammalian}} cells, the phosphorylation of purine deoxyribonucleosides {{is mediated}} predominantly by two <b>deoxyribonucleoside</b> kinases, cytosolic deoxycytidine kinase and mitochondrial deoxyguanosine kinase.

Organisms with the genotype deoB−thy− or deoC−thy− are able to grow on low levels of thymine, whereas deoB+thy− or deoC+thy− strains require high levels of thymine for growth.

40|$|Our work {{focuses on}} the use of {{microorganisms}} to recover petroleum hydrocarbons that remain entrapped after current recovery technologies reach their economic limit. Capillary forces between the hydrocarbon and aqueous phases are largely responsible for trapping the hydrocarbons in the pores of the rock and large reductions in the interfacial tension between the hydrocarbon and aqueous phases are needed for hydrocarbon mobilization (1 - 3, 10, 11). Microorganisms produce a variety of biosurfactants (4), several of which generate the ultra low interfacial tensions needed for hydrocarbon mobilization (4, 5, 8). In particular, the lipopeptide biosurfactant produced by Bacillus mojavensis strain JF- 2 reduces the interfacial tension between hydrocarbon and aqueous phases to very low levels (< 0. 016 mN/m) (8) (9). B. mojavensis JF- 2 grows under the environmental conditions found in many oil reservoirs, i. e., anaerobic, NaCl concentrations up to 80 g l{sup - 1 }, and temperatures up to 45 C (6, 7), making it ideally suited for in situ applications. However, anaerobic growth of B. mojavensis JF- 2 was inconsistent and difficult to replicate, which limited its use for in situ applications. Our initial studies revealed that enzymatic digests, such as Proteose Peptone, were required for anaerobic growth of Bacillus mojavensis JF- 2. Subsequent purification of the growth-enhancing factor in Proteose Peptone resulted in the identification of the growth-enhancing factor as DNA or <b>deoxyribonucleosides.</b> The addition of salmon sperm DNA, herring sperm DNA, E. coli DNA or synthetic DNA (single or double stranded) to Medium E all supported anaerobic growth of JF- 2.

40|$|It {{is presumed}} that the dGTP and dATP needed for replicative DNA {{synthesis}} can be formed {{by way of}} either `salvage' pathways or biosynthesis de novo. This was examined by adding hydroxyurea to cultures of rat thymus cells to inhibit ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase, a key enzyme of the `de novo' pathway. Most of the inhibition of the incorporation of [Me- 3 H]thymidine and deoxy[5 - 3 H]cytidine by low concentrations of hydroxyurea (100 – 500 μm) was prevented by substrates of the salvage pathway (400 μm-deoxyguanosine and, to a lesser extent, 200 μm-deoxyadenosine). However, isotope-dilution studies indicated that the purine <b>deoxyribonucleosides</b> prevented inhibition by decreasing pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotide competitor pools. Evidence was obtained that a hydroxyurea-induced increase in the thymidine-competitor pool (probably dTTP) was prevented to an equal extent by deoxyguanosine and by the inhibitor of thymidylate synthase, deoxy- 5 -fluorouridine. These compounds had almost identical effects on hydroxyurea dose–response curves and on thymidine isotope-dilution plots. The evidence suggests that exogenous purine <b>deoxyribonucleosides</b> cannot prevent the inhibition by hydroxyurea of thymus-cell DNA synthesis. This could mean that, {{with respect to the}} metabolism of purine deoxyribonucleotides, ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase is tightly coupled to DNA polymerase in a multienzyme complex. The complex would not permit entry of exogenous metabolic intermediates into the `de novo' pathway, but would still be subject to the regulatory effects of these intermediates.

The {{purpose of the present}} study was to determine whether Chlamydia trachomatis obtains deoxyribonucleotides from the host cell. The study was aided by the finding that host and parasite DNA synthesis activity could be distinguished by their differing sensitivities to aphidicolin and norfloxacin. Results from isotope incorporation experiments indicated that any nucleobase or ribonucleoside that could serve as a precursor for host DNA synthesis could also be utilized by C. trachomatis for DNA replication. C. trachomatis utilized only those precursors which the host cell converted to the nucleotide level. Pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotides were efficient precursors for host DNA synthesis; however, they were not used by C. trachomatis. On the other hand, purine <b>deoxyribonucleosides</b> are rapidly catabolized by host cells, it is necessary to regulate their metabolism to determine whether they serve as direct precursors for C. trachomatis DNA synthesis. This was partially achieved by using a hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase-negative cell line and using deoxycoformycin and 8 -aminoguanosine as inhibitors of (deoxy) adenosine deaminase and purine nucleoside phosphorylase, respectively. The results indicated that purine <b>deoxyribonucleosides</b> are efficiently utilized for host cell DNA synthesis even if degradation pathways are inhibited and salvage to ribonucleotides is minimized. In sharp contrast, the purine <b>deoxyribonucleosides</b> were utilized by C. trachomatis as precursors for DNA synthesis only when host catabolic pathways and salvage reactions were intact. High-pressure liquid chromatographic analysis of nucleotide pools extracted from host cells pulsed with radiolabeled precursors suggests that infected cells transport and phosphorylate all deoxynucleosides as effectively as mock-infected control cultures.
