5000|$|In Austrian politics, a {{district}} (Bezirk) is a second-level {{division of the}} executive arm of the country's government. District offices are the primary point of contact between resident and state for most acts of government that exceed municipal purview: marriage licenses, driver licenses, passports, assembly permits, hunting permits, or dealings with public health officers for example all involve interaction with the <b>district</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>authority</b> (...)

50|$|In Austrian politics, a {{statutory}} city (German: Stadt mit eigenem Statut or Statutarstadt) is a {{city that}} is vested, in addition to its purview as a municipality, with the powers and duties of a <b>district</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>authority.</b> The city administration thus functions as both a municipal government and a branch of the executive arm of the national government. As resident of a statutory city would, for example, contact a city office and interact with city employees to apply for a driver license or a passport.|$|E

5000|$|Austria {{strictly}} speaking does not name <b>districts</b> but <b>district</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>authorities.</b> The German term for [...] "district commission" [...] and [...] "city," [...] Bezirkshauptmannschaft and Stadt, respectively, {{is part of}} the official proper name of each such entity. This means that there can be pairs of districts whose two proper names contain the same toponym. Several such pairs do in fact exist. There are, for example, two <b>district</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>authorities</b> sharing the toponym Innsbruck: the (statutory) city of Innsbruck and the Innsbruck district commission.|$|R

50|$|The March Constitution {{was never}} fully {{implemented}} and formally scrapped in 1851. Officially returning to full autocracy, the Emperor abolished {{the separation of}} powers. <b>Administrative</b> <b>districts</b> were merged with judicial venues; <b>district</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>authorities</b> with <b>district</b> courts. Intellectuals aside, few objections were raised. The bulk {{of the population was}} still living and working on manorial lands and was still used to the lord of the manor being head of some form of manorial court.|$|R
5000|$|The provinces do have {{substantial}} executive responsibilities, however. Much of the nation's executive powers and duties are discharged through its system of <b>district</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>authorities,</b> which are [...] "state" [...] rather than [...] "federal" [...] institutions {{according to the}} Federal Constitutional Law. The national government decides who can apply for a marriage permit, for example, but when actually applying for one the resident is interacting with a province employee in a province facility.|$|R
5000|$|The {{question}} of how to distribute responsibilities between national government and provicinal governments was resolved in 1925. As a consequence, the Federal Constitutional Law underwent its first material revision. The 1925 version stipulates that legislative authority is concentrated with the [...] "federal" [...] parliament but that [...] "state" [...] governments have significant roles to play in the administration of the country. In particular, <b>district</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>authorities</b> were transformed from [...] "federal" [...] to [...] "state" [...] institutions. District offices are the primary point of contact between resident and government for most matters exceeding municipal purview, meaning that the executive branches of the province governments are carrying out a large fraction of the tasks of the executive branch of the national government.|$|R
50|$|A high {{percentage}} of Norwegians identify themselves more by the district they live in or come from, than the formal administrative unit(s) whose jurisdiction they fall under. A significant {{reason for this is}} that the districts, through their strong geographical limits, have historically delineated the region(s) within which one could travel without too much trouble or expenditure of time and money (on foot or skis, by horse/ox-drawn cart or sleigh or dog sled, or by one's own small rowing or sail boat). Thus, dialects and regional commonality in folk culture tended to correspond to those same geographical units, despite any division into <b>administrative</b> <b>districts</b> by <b>authorities.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Großheppach {{was first}} {{identified}} as Hegnesbach in 1236. [...] Around 1350, the castle and village became a palatine fief under various feudal lords. Since 1456, {{parts of the}} village have been under Württemberg control; and since 1506, the entire village has belonged to Württemberg. [...] Immediately upon becoming part of Württemberg, Großheppach belonged to the Württemberg <b>administrative</b> <b>authority.</b> Later, it became part of Oberamt Schorndorf (an <b>administrative</b> <b>district</b> within Württemberg). [...] In 1807, it moved—like Endersbach—to Oberamt Waiblingen (a different <b>administrative</b> <b>district</b> within Württemberg).|$|R

In the theoretical part of the thesis, {{an analysis of the}} legal regulation of inspection activities as of June 30, 2015 is made. The empirical part of the thesis {{deals with the}} process of inspection and comparison of the procedures of the individual phases of inspection pursuant to Act No. 552 / 1991 Coll., on state inspection, and Act No. 255 / 2012 Coll., on inspection (Inspection Code). It further describes practical experience as well as the problems that the inspection workers of the Municipal Trade Licence Office had to deal with in the course of administrative activities in connection with the amendment of Inspection Code. In addition, the thesis deals with a questionnaire survey while its evaluation brings the answers to the question how business entities perceive inspection surveys conducted with regard to their business activities. For the reason of comprehensiveness, the development in the number of business entities in the <b>administrative</b> <b>district</b> of the <b>administrative</b> <b>authority,</b> number of inspection surveys conducted, their focus, and possible sanctions, are documented, monitored in the period of last 10 years. The work concludes with the summary of inspection activities {{from the point of view}} of the Municipal Trade Licence Office in Mladá Boleslav as well as from the point of view of business entities...|$|R

Rather, each province has its own regulation of bonds and the bond is usually administered by departments of land and resources at or above the county level in each province.|$|R
