However, the existing data on its genotoxicity is poor and controversial. The aim of this study was to assess in vitro the potential genotoxicity of <b>Fluo</b> in sole and its possible effect on CYP 450 modulation. Freshly isolated hepatocytes were exposed for 24 h to a range of <b>Fluo</b> concentrations from 0. 5 to 50 μM in both culture flasks and microplate wells. The ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity was measured as an indicator of the activity of the cytochrome P 450 1 A 1 (CYP 1 A 1). The genotoxic effects were evaluated by measuring both DNA strand breaks and DNA adducts by the alkaline comet assay and the postlabeling technique respectively. Calf thymus DNA was also exposed to <b>Fluo</b> in the presence of sole liver microsomes in order to check for <b>Fluo</b> DNA adduct formation. In sole hepatocytes, <b>Fluo</b> was shown to induce a decrease in the EROD activity in a concentration-dependent manner. A significant genotoxic effect was observed in terms of DNA strand breakage from an exposure concentration of 5 μM: despite a concentration-dependent effect was observed, it did not follow a linear dose-response. The response was similar whatever the way of exposure in flasks or in wells.

Teriflunomide has further been shown to trigger apoptosis of tumor cells and has thus been considered {{for the treatment of}} malignancy. In analogy to apoptosis of nucleated cells, erythrocytes may enter suicidal death or eryptosis, which is characterized by cell shrinkage and phospholipid scrambling of the cell membrane with translocation of phosphatidylserine to the erythrocyte surface. Triggers of cell membrane scrambling include energy depletion, oxidative stress and increase of cytosolic Ca 2 + activity ([Ca 2 +]i). The present study explored whether teriflunomide modifies eryptosis. Methods: Flow cytometry was employed to estimate phosphatidylserine abundance at the erythrocyte surface from annexin-V-binding, cell volume from forward scatter, and [Ca 2 +]i from <b>Fluo</b> 3 fluorescence. Results: Oxidative stress (60 min exposure to 0. 3 mM tert-butylhydroperoxide), energy depletion (removal of glucose for 48 hours), and exposure to the Ca 2 + ionophore ionomycin (1 µM, 60 min) all increased annexin-V-binding, decreased forward scatter and enhanced <b>Fluo</b> 3 fluorescence. Teriflunomide (5 µg/ml) did not significantly influence <b>Fluo</b> 3 fluorescence, forward scatter and annexin-V-binding under control conditions but significantly blunted the increase of annexin-V-binding following oxidative stress, energy depletion and ionomycin exposure.

We have used confocal microscopy together with two calcium-sensitive dyes [acetoxymethyl esters of <b>fluo</b> 3 (<b>fluo</b> 3 -AM) and rhod 2 (rhod 2 -AM) ] to analyze the cytosolic and nuclear calcium distribution in vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells studied at rest and after stimulation with receptor-dependent (angiotensin, vasopressin) and receptor-independent (KCl) stimuli. With <b>fluo</b> 3 -AM, the baseline fluorescence was located in the cytoplasm but was slightly higher in the nucleus.

Since little information is available regarding the action of melatonin on the heart, we studied the effects of melatonin on adult ventricular myocytes subjected to chemical hypoxia and reoxygenation.

Results: Cells subjected to 12. 5 min chemical hypoxia showed marked morphological changes, increased fluorescence intensity of DCDHF, DHR and <b>Fluo,</b> suggesting Ca 2 + accumulation and generation of H 2 O 2 and reactive oxygen species.

Objectives: In this study we used artemether as a new drug for treatment of visceral leishmaniasis. Materials and Methods: In the present study, BALB/c mice infected with Leishmania infantum (MHOM/TN/ 80 /IPI 1) were treated with the most effective dose of artemether assessed with In Vitro assay. Artemether was given in parenteral and oral forms. Parasite burdens in the spleen and liver were determined by homogenizing and counting the parasite rate and were compared with those in the untreated mice. To evaluate the apoptotic properties of artemether by FACS flowcytometry, annexin-V <b>FLUOS</b> staining was performe. Results: IC 50 of the drug on Leishmania infantum was determined to be 25 μg/mL after 24 h.

Many studies have addressed health risks posed by a life-time exposure to DBPs through chlorinated drinking water or through dermal or inhalation exposure routes. Experimental studies have revealed genotoxic and carcinogenic effects of some DBPs and epidemiological studies evidenced potential associations between chlorinated drinking water and bladder or colorectal cancer. In addition, a possible link between chlorinated drinking water and reproductive/developmental effects has been hypothesized. 	Many DBPs {{have been identified in}} treated water, which justifies the growing concern about the potential health effects of emerging unregulated DBPs, some of which appear to be more genotoxic, in some assays, than the regulated DBPs. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are among the most persistent contaminants detected in environmental samples such as river sediments and tap water. Water chlorination can lead to the formation of chlorinated derivatives of PAHs (Cl-PAHs) and the few available toxicological studies have shown that Cl-PAHs possess greater mutagenicity than the corresponding parent PAHs. 	The present study had two main objectives: 1) identification of the major chlorinated derivatives of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) and fluoranthene (<b>Fluo)</b> formed as chlorination by-products and 2) evaluation of their potential hazard to humans, through the characterization of their potential genotoxic effects in a human cell line. To synthesize chlorinated standards of PAHs, a newly two phase (water/n-hexane) method was developed for BaP and <b>Fluo.</b> 6 -Cl-BaP was obtained as the major chlorination product of BaP, and 3 -Cl-Fluo and 1, 3 -Cl 2 -Fluo of <b>Fluo.</b> The formation of these BaP and <b>Fluo</b> chlorinated derivatives was also observed under WTPs chlorination conditions after at 0. 5 until 24 h of exposure. The effects of equimolar concentrations of 6 -Cl-BaP vs. BaP and of 3 -Cl-Fluo/ 1, 3 -Cl 2 -Fluo vs. <b>Fluo</b> on cell viability and DNA integrity were assessed by the neutral red uptake (NR) and the comet assay, respectively. Exposure of HepG 2 cells to a dose-range of 6 -Cl-BaP and BaP showed that both compounds are cytotoxic above 50 µM and that, at the equimolar doses of 100 and 125 µM, 6 -Cl-BaP is able to induce a significantly higher level of DNA damage than BaP. On the other hand, no changes of cell viability were observed after exposure to several concentrations of <b>Fluo</b> and its derivatives. Likewise, none of the compounds was able to significantly induce DNA damage. In conclusion, the present data confirmed that chlorinated derivatives of BaP and <b>Fluo</b> are formed during WTPs chlorination procedures and allowed the identification of their major chlorinated derivatives that should be further analysed in drinking water. On the other hand, the results from the comet assay evidenced a higher DNA damaging effect of Cl-BaP comparatively to its parent compound, suggestive of a more potent genotoxic effect. In spite of the negative results found for <b>Fluo</b> and its chorinated products, further genotoxicity studies are still needed to allow a definite conclusion. Although health risks of DBPs are small compared to health risks of waterborne diseases, the identification of hazardous Cl-PAHs in water emphasizes the need of development of new and safer water disinfection methods...|$|R

The nature of the pathways involved in the sarcolemmal Ca(2 +) entry and in the SR Ca(2 +) leak is still a matter of debate, but several lines of evidence suggest that these Ca(2 +) fluxes are up-regulated in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. We investigated here SR calcium permeation at resting potential {{and in response to}} depolarization in voltage-controlled skeletal muscle fibers from control and mdx mice, the mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Using the cytosolic Ca(2 +) dye Fura 2, we first demonstrated that the rate of Ca(2 +) increase in response to cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) -induced inhibition of SR Ca(2 +) -ATPases at resting potential was significantly higher in mdx fibers, which suggests an elevated SR Ca(2 +) leak. However, removal of external Ca(2 +) reduced the rate of CPA-induced Ca(2 +) increase in mdx and increased it in control fibers, which indicates an up-regulation of sarcolemmal Ca(2 +) influx in mdx fibers. Fibers were then loaded with the low-affinity Ca(2 +) dye <b>Fluo</b> 5 N-AM to measure intraluminal SR Ca(2 +) changes. Trains of action potentials, chloro-m-cresol, and depolarization pulses evoked transient <b>Fluo</b> 5 N fluorescence decreases, and recovery of voltage-induced <b>Fluo</b> 5 N fluorescence changes were inhibited by CPA, demonstrating that <b>Fluo</b> 5 N actually reports intraluminal SR Ca(2 +) changes. Voltage dependence and magnitude of depolarization-induced SR Ca(2 +) depletion were found to be unchanged in mdx fibers, but the rate of the recovery phase that followed depletion was found to be faster, indicating a higher SR Ca(2 +) reuptake activity in mdx fibers. Overall, CPA-induced SR Ca(2 +) leak at - 80 mV was found to be significantly higher in mdx fibers and was potentiated by removal of external Ca(2 +) in control fibers.

40|$|Background/Aims: The human {{epidermal}} {{growth factor}} receptors tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib {{has been shown to}} trigger suicidal death or apoptosis of tumor cells and is thus used for the treatment of malignancy. Side effects of lapatinib include anemia, which could, at least in theory, result from stimulation of eryptosis, the suicidal death of erythrocytes which is characterized by cell shrinkage and phospholipid scrambling of the cell membrane leading to phosphatidylserine translocation to the erythrocyte surface. Mechanisms involved in the triggering of eryptosis include oxidative stress, increase of cytosolic Ca 2 + activity ([Ca 2 +]i), and ceramide. The present study explored, whether lapatinib induces eryptosis. Methods: Phosphatidylserine exposure at the cell surface was estimated from annexin-V-binding, cell volume from forward scatter, [Ca 2 +]i from <b>Fluo</b> 3 -fluorescence, abundance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from DCFDA dependent fluorescence, and ceramide abundance utilizing labelled specific antibodies. Results: A 48 hours exposure of human erythrocytes to lapatinib (≥ 1 µg/ml) significantly increased the percentage of annexin-V-binding cells, and significantly decreased forward scatter. Lapatinib (7. 5 µg/ml) did not significantly modify DCFDA fluorescence and ceramide abundance. Lapatinib slightly, but significantly decreased <b>Fluo</b> 3 -fluorescence (≥ 5 µg/ml). Lapatinib (7. 5 µg/ml) enhanced the annexin-V-binding {{in the presence of the}} Ca 2 + ionophore ionomycin (1 µM) without significantly modifying <b>Fluo</b> 3 fluorescence in the presence of ionomycin. The effect of lapatinib on forward scatter but not on annexin-V-binding was significantly blunted by removal of extracellular Ca 2 +. Conclusion: Lapatinib triggers cell shrinkage and phospholipid scrambling of the erythrocyte cell membrane, an effect occurring despite decrease of cytosolic Ca 2 + activity...|$|R
40|$|Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons (PAHs) {{are among the}} most persistent and toxic organic micropollutants present in water and several of them are mutagenic and carcinogenic. Although {{it has been shown that}} chlorinated derivatives of PAHs (Cl-PAHs) may be formed during the water chlorination procedure, little is known about their potential genotoxic and carcinogenic effects. The objectives of the present work were to prepare and characterize the major chlorinated derivatives of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) and fluoranthene (<b>Fluo),</b> to develop an analytical methodology for their quantification in water samples and to analyse their potential genotoxicity. Chlorinated standards were prepared by a newly developed two phase method (water/n-hexane) using sodium hypochlorite. 6 -Chloro-benzo[a]pyrene was selectively obtained from BaP, while 1, 3 - dichloro-fluoranthene and 3 -chloro-fluoranthene were obtained from <b>Fluo.</b> All products were isolated and characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry. The formation of BaP- and Fluo-chlorinated derivatives under aqueous chlorination conditions was observed using a SPE-HPLC-FLD methodology. In addition, the cytotoxic and genotoxic activities of the three chlorinated derivatives were analyzed in comparison to their parent compounds, in a human-derived hepatoma cell line using the neutral red uptake and comet assays, respectively. The results showed that, at the equimolar doses of 100 and 125 μM, 6 -Cl-BaP was able to induce a significantly higher level of DNA damage than BaP, suggesting a more potent genotoxic effect. In contrast, neither <b>Fluo</b> nor its chlorinated derivatives were genotoxic in the same cell line. The identification of new and possibly hazardous water chlorination by-product from PAHs emphasizes the need to minimize total organic carbon content of raw water and the implementation of safer water disinfection methods...|$|R
40|$|To explain {{disparate}} decay {{rates of}} cytosolic Ca 2 + and structural {{changes in the}} thin filaments during a twitch, we model {{the time course of}} Ca 2 + bound troponin (Tn) resulting from the free Ca 2 + transient of fast skeletal muscle. In fibers stretched beyond overlap, the decay of Ca 2 + as measured by a change in <b>fluo</b> 3 fluorescence is significantly slower than the intensity decay of the meridional 1 / 38. 5 nm- 1 reflection of Tn; this is not simply explained by considering only the Ca 2 + binding properties of Tn alone (Matsuo, T., Iwamoto, H., and Yagi, N. (2010). Biophys. J. 99, 193 - 200). We apply a comprehensive model that includes the known Ca 2 + binding properties of Tn {{in the context of the}} thin filament with and without cycling crossbridges. Calculations based on the model predict that the transient of Ca 2 + bound Tn correlates with either the <b>fluo</b> 3 time course in muscle with overlapping thin and thick filaments or the intensity of the meridional 1 / 38. 5 nm- 1 reflection in overstretched muscle. Hence, cycling crossbridges delay the dissociation of Ca 2 + from Tn. Correlation with the <b>fluo</b> 3 fluorescence change is not causal given that the transient of Ca 2 + bound Tn depends on sarcomere length, whereas the fluo- 3 fluorescence change does not. Transient positions of tropomyosin calculated from the time course of Ca 2 + bound Tn are in reasonable agreement with the transient of measured perturbations of the Tn repeat in overlap and non-overlap muscle preparations...|$|R

40|$|Background/aims: Geldanamycin, a benzoquinone {{ansamycin}} antibiotic, and its analogues induce apoptosis of {{tumor cells}} {{and are thus}} considered {{for the treatment of}} cancer. Similar to apoptosis of nucleated cells, erythrocytes may enter eryptosis, the suicidal erythrocyte death characterized by cell shrinkage and by cell membrane scrambling with phosphatidylserine-exposure at the erythrocyte surface. Triggers of eryptosis include increase of cytosolic Ca 2 +-concentration ([Ca 2 +]i) and formation of ceramide. The present study explored, whether geldanamycin modifies [Ca 2 +]i, ceramide formation, cell volume and phosphatidylserine abundance at the erythrocyte surface. Methods: Erythrocyte volume was estimated from forward scatter, phosphatidylserine-abundance from annexin V binding, hemolysis from hemoglobin release, ceramide formation from binding of fluorescent antibodies and [Ca 2 +]i from <b>Fluo</b> 3 -fluorescence. Results: A 48 hours exposure to geldanamycin significantly decreased forward scatter (≥ 5 µM), significantly increased annexin-V-binding (≥ 25 µM), but did not significantly modify <b>Fluo</b> 3 -fluorescence (up to 50 µM). The annexin-V-binding following geldanamycin treatment was not significantly modified by removal of extracellular Ca 2 + but was paralleled by significantly increased ceramide formation (50 µM). Conclusions: Geldanamycin stinulated eryptosis, an effect at least partially due to ceramide formation...|$|R

In neurons beginning to extend neurites, depolarization led to pronounced {{increases in}} nuclear and nucleolar Ca 2 + levels severalfold greater than corresponding increases in the cytoplasm. The nucleolar Ca 2 + signal often exceeded that of the nucleus, indicating regional heterogeneity of the nucleus. The subcellular calcium transients were dependent on extracellular Ca 2 + {{and the level of}} depolarization, indicating the importance of transmembrane Ca 2 + fluxes in triggering the nuclear events. After neurite extension, the nuclear Ca 2 + signals were attenuated and never exceeded cytoplasmic levels. These results indicate that activity-dependent modulation of intranuclear Ca 2 + levels is greater in DRG neurons during early neurite extension. Given the importance of Ca 2 + in gene expression, the results may be relevant to Ca(2 +) -dependent nuclear events responsible for axonal regeneration...|$|R
