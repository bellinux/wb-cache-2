5|$|While {{the route}} to the falls from Eagle on the Hill was on public land, the {{alternative}} route along the gully was through private properties. Nevertheless, many visitors chose this route, and a combination of public demand and a desire <b>from</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> landowners for improved access to and from their propertiesespecially from the Mügge familyled to pressure to build a road through the gully. Although there was opposition <b>from</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> locals, the Waterfall Gully road {{was built in the}} late 1880s.|$|E
5|$|Mathias' {{candidacy}} consideration did not endear him to {{the conservative}} wing of the Maryland Republican Party organization. In June 1976, he lost a vote by state Republicans to determine who would represent Maryland on the platform committee at the 1976 Republican National Convention. Instead, the group chose George Price, a conservative member of the Maryland House of Delegates from Baltimore County. At one point, Mathias was close to being denied attendance to the convention altogether as an at-large delegate, but a last minute compromise ensured all Republican congressional representatives seats as at-large delegates. Mathias maintained a low profile during the convention, and received harsh criticism <b>from</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conservative delegates from Maryland who attended.|$|E

Basiliscus, however, failed to fulfill the promises he made to the two generals; furthermore, they received letters <b>from</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leading ministers at the court, urging them to secure the return of Zeno, for the city now preferred a restored Isaurian to a Miaphysite whose unpopularity increased with the fiscal rapacity of his ministers.|$|E
5|$|The FEFAP field surveys, {{excavations}} and exhumations spanned {{more than}} 10years. The {{results of this}} study from King William Island and Beechey Island artefacts and human remains showed that the Beechey Island crew had most likely died of pneumonia and perhaps tuberculosis, which was suggested by the evidence of Pott's disease discovered in Braine. Toxicological reports pointed to lead poisoning as a likely contributing factor. Blade cut marks found on bones <b>from</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crew were seen as signs of cannibalism. Evidence suggested that a combination of cold, starvation and disease including scurvy, pneumonia and tuberculosis, all made worse by lead poisoning, killed everyone in the Franklin party.|$|E

The Picumninae piculets have a pantropical distribution, with species in Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Neotropics, with the greatest diversity being in South America. The second piculet subfamily, Nesoctitinae, has a single member, the Antillean piculet, which is restricted to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. The wrynecks (Jynginae) are found exclusively in the Old World, with the two species occurring in Europe, Asia, and Africa.|$|E
5|$|After the nationalization, {{the company}} started a {{renovation}} {{process of the}} infrastructure and rolling stock. Combined with a municipal policy of low fares, the company started going with a loss. Five new trams were delivered from 1948 to 1952, and built at the depot at Holtet, with used equipment <b>from</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> older trams. An additional nine new trams were delivered between 1952 and 1955. Five additional trams were rebuilt from 1955 to 1960, by which time all the narrow trams had been rebuilt or retired. The use of a unique voltage gave operational difficulties, as fuses could regularly blow at Oslo Hospital if errors were made while switching from the one supply to the other. In addition, all the trams were custom-built with extra equipment with limited spare parts. All the trams delivered during the 1950s were built so they could later be converted to only use 600 volt supply. The depot was expanded in 1952.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{reported}} that players rarely {{need to use}} Undead Nightmare new weapons. Whitehead (Eurogamer) said that Marston's firearms are mostly indistinguishable apart from the blunderbuss, which is only useful when the player is overrun by zombies. GameSpot added that the game's combat is repetitive and less fun in the expansion, as zombies barely pose a threat. The zombies, without guns, cover, horses, lack the complexities of cowboys and, apart <b>from</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> special zombie types, are only a threat at short distances. The reviewer found little variation between weapons when firing at close range, which {{is more effective than}} aiming at a distance. The fun of the new guns quickly faded for the critic, who found little incentive to use traditional gunfight strategies. Whitehead (Eurogamer) too noted that the base game relied on its use of cover during gunfights, which the expansion jettisons altogether. Thus the player is forced into the technique of backtracking and turning to use the time-slowing Dead Eye mode to clear zombies with headshots. The reviewer also found the controls clumsy and often tripped on piles of zombie bodies or became stuck in doorways. While the idea of zombie animals scared Whitehead, he was both relieved and disappointed to find that bears and cougars, like the humans, died with a single bullet.|$|E

5|$|Ise was {{attacked}} by 80-odd aircraft from the fourth wave, but they failed to inflict any serious damage. She dodged 11 torpedoes and was only hit by a bomb once, on the bulge outboard of the port catapult. Some 34 other bombs near missed her, spraying her with splinters and ruptured some hull plates that contaminated some fuel oil and caused leaks in her port boiler rooms. While an exact total of her casualties is not available, {{it has been estimated}} that 5 men were killed and some 111–121 crewmen were wounded during this attack. Hyūga was unsuccessfully attacked by an American submarine at 18:43. Around 19:00 Ozawa learned about a force of destroyers and cruisers that drove off the Japanese destroyers rescuing survivors <b>from</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> carriers lost earlier in the day and sank Chiyoda. He ordered the Fourth Carrier Division to reverse course and engage the Americans, but the battleships were unable to find them, and Ozawa ordered them to reverse course and head for Amami Ōshima. When they arrived on 27 October, Ozawa transferred to Hyūga and hoisted his flag aboard her. While en route for Kure, the division was unsuccessfully attacked by another submarine.|$|E
5|$|New {{purchases}} {{of the game}} are provided with a one-time use card granting access code that unlocks the game's Cerberus Network, an online downloadable content and news service that enables bonus content for the game. However, users who bought the game used {{would have to pay}} for the Cerberus Network separately if they wanted access to the new content. This policy allows publishers to combat the used-game market; companies like GameStop have allowed costumers to sell used games back to the retailer so that the company can resell them at a small discount to other customers, but the publisher does not make a profit. BioWare online development director Fernando Melo revealed that 11% of all Mass Effect 2s downloadable content revenue came from the Cerberus Network. The policy attracted criticism <b>from</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fan community, who have criticized downloadable content as being overpriced and an incentive for developers to leave items out of the initial release.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} {{separate}} efforts {{to establish a}} Naval Academy football team in 1879. The first was guided by first-classman J.H. Robinson, who developed it as a training regiment {{to help keep the}} school's baseball team in shape. The team played the sport under rules that made it much closer to soccer, where the players were permitted only to kick the ball in order to advance it. The second effort, headed by first-classman William John Maxwell was more successful in its efforts. Maxwell met with two of his friends, Tunstall Smith and Henry Woods, who played for the Baltimore Athletic Club and officially challenged their team to a game with the Naval Academy. A team was formed from academy first-classmen, which Maxwell led as a manager, trainer, and captain. The team would wake up and practice before reveille and following drill and meals. The squad received encouragement <b>from</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> faculty, who allowed them to eat a late dinner and skip final drill for additional practicing. This was against the direct orders of the school superintendent, who had banned football and similar activities.|$|E
