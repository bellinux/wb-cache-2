Despite changes in performance method, the Orb maintained their colourful light shows and psychedelic imagery in concert.

5|$|Artists Mike Marsicano and Kurt Bickenbach played {{critical}} {{roles in}} the creation of the game's aircraft models, which were built in 3D Studio. As reference material, the team photographed real planes at several airfields, and they received blueprints and datasheets from aircraft manufacturers. The game's Grob G103a Twin II sailplane was based directly on the one that Blackley owned at the time. The sophistication of the real-time CFDs complicated the 3D modeling process, as the planes required accurate geometry to fly properly. While attempting to meet this goal, however, Bickenbach said that the models he created were overly detailed, which caused the team to struggle with performance issues related to the high number of polygons. Reducing the number altered the plane's shape, which in turn reduced its flight realism; this necessitated a balance between performance and accuracy. To obtain audio for the planes, Greg LoPiccolo and Tom Streit—former bassist and road manager, respectively, of the band Tribe—visited a Florida importer of Russian aerobatic aircraft. The two placed microphones inside the cockpits and next to the engines, and they flew each plane at multiple speeds while recording with a <b>digital</b> <b>audio</b> <b>tape</b> machine. Combining this material with digital recordings of wind sounds, the team fashioned a physics-based sound system: sounds of the wind and engine are altered in real-time based on wind speed in the game.|$|E

500|$|In the Orb's early DJ {{events in}} the 1980s, Paterson and Cauty {{performed}} with three record decks, a cassette player, and a CD player {{all of which were}} mixed through an Akai 12-track mixer.

During promotional tours for Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld and U.F.Orb, they performed using a <b>digital</b> <b>audio</b> <b>tape</b> machine and experimented with other media sources such as dubplates. The tape machines held individual chords, rhythms, and basslines for each composition, allowing the Orb to reprocess them and mimic the act of DJ-ing. Members could then easily improvise with these samples and manipulate them using sound effect racks. Often, the Orb had a live musician accompanying them, such as Steve Hillage on guitar.

[...] I also loved all the remixes he did for me and I was interested in fusing a kind of futuristic sound but also using lots of Indian and Moroccan influences and things like that, and I wanted it to sound old and new at the same time", Madonna said. The singer drew inspiration from Bernardo Bertolucci's 1990 British-Italian drama film, The Sheltering Sky, which dealt with a couple trying to save their marriage during a trip to Africa. She wanted to have the [...] "whole Moroccan/orchestral/super-romantic/man-carrying-the-woman-he-loves-across-the-desert vibe" [...] for the track. Still continuing work with Leonard on some of the tracks, Madonna asked him to give her a composition with [...] "tribal feel, something really lush and romantic".

The vocal sample was of a man uttering the words [...] "you see", later confirmed by him to be actor Jesse Pearson. Both McKuen and Kerr received co-writing credits on [...] "Drowned World/Substitute for Love" [...] due to the inclusion of the sample, and also because thematically the track follows a plotline that transpired in [...] "Why I Follow the Tigers".

500|$|... "Nothing Really Matters" [...] {{was written}} by Madonna and American {{producer}} and songwriter Patrick Leonard, and was produced by herself alongside British producers William Orbit and Marius De Vries.

It took me on a search for answers to questions I'd never asked myself before," [...] she said to Q magazine in 2002. Madonna begun writing the song with Leonard during developing her album Ray of Light. However, unlike their previous work dynamics, Leonard gave little input during studio sessions and only co-wrote four songs for the album, including [...] "Nothing Really Matters". As a result, Madonna did not want him to produce the track. Her manager Guy Oseary then telephoned Orbit, and suggested that the latter send some songs to Madonna.

In digital recording, the analog signal of video or sound is converted into a stream of discrete numbers, representing the changes in chroma and luminance values (video) orair-pressure (audio) through time, thus making an abstract template for the original sound or moving image.

Three of the songs, [...] "The Power of Good-Bye", [...] "To Have and Not to Hold" [...] and [...] "Little Star", appear on the album. Madonna then began writing songs with Leonard, who had produced many songs for Madonna in the late 1980s.

40|$|Background: The {{treatment}} of oral cancer {{is complex and}} lengthy. Curative treatment implies a combination of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The main goal of treatment is to guarantee long-term tumour free survival with as little functional and cosmetic damage. Despite progress in developing these strategies, cancers of the oral cavity continue to have high mortality rates that have not improved dramatically {{over the past ten}} years. Aim: The aim {{of this study was to}} uniquely explore the dynamic changes in the physical, psychological, social and existential experiences of newly diagnosed patients with oral cancer at two points across their cancer illness trajectory i. e. at the time of diagnosis and at the end of treatment. Methodology: A qualitative prospective longitudinal design was employed. Non-probability purposive sampling allowed the recruitment of 10 participants. The principal data collection method used was a <b>digital</b> <b>audio</b> <b>taped</b> semi-structured interview along with drawings produced by the participants. Analysis: Data was analysed using latent content analyses. Summary: Three ‘dynamic’ themes, physical, psychosocial and existential experiences were revealed that interact and influence each other in a complex and compound whole. These experiences are present at different degrees and throughout the entire trajectory of care. Patients have a number of specific concerns and challenges that cannot be compartmentalised into unitary or discrete aspects of their daily lives. Conclusion & Implications: An understanding of the patient’s experience of their illness at all stages of the disease trajectory, is essential to inform service providers’ decision making if the delivery of care is to be client centred. Dynamic and fluctuating changes in the patient’s personal experience of the cancer journey require dynamic, energetic and timely input from health care professionals...|$|R

The band, however, failed to promote the CD any further and it had been largely lost to the public until its internet re-release in 2010. The dawning of 2002 marked the end of Puafua's live performances and recordings, the band giving up a marquee slot at the famed Cabooze bar, a slot formerly held by The Big Wu for whom Puafua was an opening act in its early days. A standing room only crowd at the Uptown Bar and Grill witnesses the extremely under-publicized farewell show on December 1, 2001.

2500|$|Absolute pitch (AP) is {{the ability}} to produce or {{recognize}} specific pitches without reference to an external standard. People boasting AP have internalized pitch references, and thus are able to maintain stable representations of pitch in long-term memory. AP is regarded as a rare and somewhat mysterious ability, occurring in as few as 1 in 10,000 people. A method commonly used to test for AP is as follows: subjects are first asked to close their eyes and imagine that a specific song is playing in their heads. Encouraged to start anywhere in the tune they like, subjects are then instructed to try to reproduce the tones of that song by singing, humming, or whistling. Productions made by the subject are then recorded on <b>digital</b> <b>audio</b> <b>tape,</b> which accurately preserves the pitches they sing avoiding the potential pitch and speed fluctuations of analog recording. Lastly, the subjects' productions are compared to the actual tones sung by the artists on the CDs. Errors are measured in semitone deviations from the correct pitch. This test, however, does not determine whether or not the subject has true absolute pitch, but rather is a test of implicit absolute pitch. Where true absolute pitch is concerned, Deutsch and colleagues have shown that music conservatory students who are speakers of tone languages [...] have a far higher prevalence of absolute pitch than do speakers of nontone languages such as English. For a test of absolute pitch see the [...] developed by Deutsch and colleagues at the University of California San Diego.|$|E
