50|$|Lorentz force {{flowmeters}} {{are usually}} classified in several main conceptual setups. Some of them designed as static <b>flowmeters</b> <b>where</b> the magnet system is at rest and one measures the force acting on it. Alternatively, {{they can be}} designed as rotary <b>flowmeters</b> <b>where</b> the magnets are arranged on a rotating wheel and the spinning velocity {{is a measure of}} the flow velocity. Obviously, the force acting on a Lorentz force flowmeter depends both on the velocity distribution and on the shape of the magnet system. This classification depends on the relative direction of the magnetic field that is being applied respect to the direction of the flow. In Figure 3 one can distinguish diagrams of the longitudinal and the transverse Lorentz force flowmeters.|$|R
