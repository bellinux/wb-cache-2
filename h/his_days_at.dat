Through DLC, the WWE Hall of Fame showcase contains what if matches and some from WCW; these matches were announced on Oct 7th 2015 and to be released alongside the Deluxe Editions of the video game.|$|E
5|$|The Students' Building was {{designed}} by the New York City architecture firm of McKim, Mead & White, representing their only project at Vassar College. The plans were drawn up by young architect Joseph Herenden Clark, a recent graduate of the Columbia School of Architecture who, upon hearing the requirement that the structure be made from brick with white trim and a slate roof, recalled Christ Church in Alexandria, Virginia. Clark had studied Christ Church, which George Washington attended, during <b>his</b> <b>days</b> <b>at</b> Columbia. He trekked to Alexandria to study the interior and exterior {{of the church and}} ultimately the designs for the Students' Building, his first public plan, were inspired by its architecture and features. Bishop and Company were contracted to construct the Students' Building, an example of the Southern colonial revival style. It sits on the north edge of campus due south of the college's North Gate and southeast of residential quad dorms like Lathrop House. Noyes House was built in 1958 and rests immediately to the southeast of the Students' Building.|$|E

5|$|Though Manekshaw {{initially}} {{thought of}} pursuing {{a career as}} a medical doctor, he later joined the first intake of the Indian Military Academy (IMA) when it was established in 1932. Right from <b>his</b> <b>days</b> <b>at</b> IMA, he proved to be witty and humorous in nature. He was first attached to the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Scots, and later posted to the 4th Battalion of the 12th Frontier Force Regiment, commonly known as the 54th Sikhs. During action in World War II, he was awarded the Military Cross for gallantry. Following the partition of India in 1947, he was reassigned to the 16th Punjab Regiment. Manekshaw was seconded to a planning role during the 1947 Indo-Pakistani War and the Hyderabad crisis, and as a result he never commanded an infantry battalion. He was promoted to the rank of brigadier while serving at the Military Operations Directorate.|$|E
5|$|In summer 2007, he {{was offered}} a {{short-term}} deal with League Two side Bradford City following a successful trial, teaming back up with Stuart McCall, who Nix knew from <b>his</b> <b>days</b> <b>at</b> Sheffield United. He made his Bradford debut against Wolverhampton Wanderers in a League Cup game scoring his first senior goal. His league debut came three days later in the first league game to be played at Shrewsbury Town's new ground the New Meadow. He was offered a longer term deal at City, before becoming a regular first team player. His first league goal was a long-range equaliser as Bradford drew 1–1 with Chesterfield on 8 December 2007 before he added a second in successive games in a 2–1 defeat to Peterborough United. His goals helped to win him a contract extension in January {{until the end of}} the 2007–08 season. Later that month he improved his run of goals by scoring in three successive matches to help Bradford to five points from three games within the space of eight days. Nix stayed in the team for the remainder of the season, but it was not until April that he scored again, with a long-range volley against Brentford, as he bid for a new contract for the 2008–09 season. On 29 April 2008, Nix was offered a new deal, which he signed the following week to remain at Bradford for another season.|$|E

25|$|Critics {{have noted}} that Twin Peaks began the trend of {{accomplished}} cinematography now commonplace in today's television dramas. Lynch and Frost maintained tight control over the first season, handpicking all of the directors, including some Lynch had known from <b>his</b> <b>days</b> <b>at</b> the American Film Institute (e.g., Caleb Deschanel and Tim Hunter) and some referred to him by those he knew personally. Lynch and Frost's control lessened in the second season, corresponding with what is generally regarded as {{a decrease in the}} show's quality once the identity of Laura Palmer's murderer was revealed.|$|E
25|$|In early education, in training, and in <b>his</b> <b>days</b> <b>at</b> Oxford {{as student}} {{and later as}} master, John Duns Scotus deepened the {{understanding}} of the real and the concrete.

Thus John Duns Scotus joined his predecessor, Bonaventure on a similar interpretation of the function and mission of Jesus Christ given by Francis, that Christ is the highest grace God offers His creatures, and their response controls their attitude to God.|$|E

25|$|The 20-year-old McCulloch {{made his}} Ranger's debut immediately, {{replacing}} Frank Saul in the team, {{playing in a}} 5–2 home win over Birmingham City on 17 October 1970 and scoring the fifth goal.
