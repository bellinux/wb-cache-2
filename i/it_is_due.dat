5|$|Hereditary copper {{accumulation}} {{has been}} described in Bedlington Terriers, where it generally only affects the liver. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>due</b> to mutations in the COMMD1 (or MURR1) gene. Despite this findings, COMMD1 mutations could not be detected in humans with non-Wilsonian copper accumulation states (such as Indian childhood cirrhosis) to explain their genetic origin.|$|E
5|$|Cooper's colleague, Albert Rosenfield (Miguel Ferrer) {{wishes to}} conduct a further {{post-mortem}} on Laura's body, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>due</b> to be released for the funeral that day. As the argument grows more heated, Truman ends it by punching Rosenfield and knocking him down. Later, Rosenfield shares what he has found; Laura had been bound when she was killed, had been addicted to cocaine, and had been clawed by a bird. An unidentified plastic shard was also found in her stomach.|$|E
5|$|Fur-bearing trout are fictional {{creatures that}} are purportedly found in Arkansas, {{northern}} North America, and Iceland. The basic claim (or tall tale) {{is that the}} waters of lakes and rivers {{in the area are}} so cold that they evolved a thick coat of fur to maintain their body heat. Another theory says that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>due</b> to four jugs - or two bottles - of hair tonic being spilled into the Arkansas River.|$|E

5|$|In a {{paper by}} Carlos and Raul de la Fuente Marcos {{evidence}} is shown {{for a possible}} bimodal distribution of the distances to the ascending nodes of the ETNOs. This correlation {{is unlikely to be}} the result of observational bias since it also appears in the nodal distribution of large semi-major axis centaurs and comets. If <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>due</b> to the extreme TNOs experiencing close approaches to Planet Nine, it is consistent with a planet with a semi-major axis of 300–400 AU.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect can}} also be derived by using either the exact Schwarzschild metric (describing spacetime around a spherical mass) or the much more general post-Newtonian formalism. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>due</b> to the {{influence}} of gravity on the geometry of space and to the contribution of self-energy to a body's gravity (encoded in the nonlinearity of Einstein's equations). Relativistic precession has been observed for all planets that allow for accurate precession measurements (Mercury, Venus, and Earth), as well as in binary pulsar systems, where it is larger by five orders of magnitude.|$|E
5|$|The {{orientation}} of Earth's axis and equator are not fixed in space, but rotate about the poles of the ecliptic with {{a period of}} about 26,000 years, a process known as lunisolar precession, as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>due</b> mostly to the gravitational effect of the Moon and Sun on Earth's equatorial bulge. Likewise, the ecliptic itself is not fixed. The gravitational perturbations of the other bodies of the Solar System cause a much smaller motion of the plane of Earth's orbit, and hence of the ecliptic, known as planetary precession. The combined action of these two motions is called general precession, and changes the position of the equinoxes by about 50 arc seconds (about 0.014°) per year.|$|E
