5|$|Great Auk calls {{included}} low croaking and a <b>hoarse</b> scream. A captive {{great auk}} was observed making a gurgling noise when anxious. It {{is not known}} what its other vocalizations were, but {{it is believed that}} they were {{similar to those of the}} razorbill, only louder and deeper.|$|E
5|$|Loss of {{function}} of the vagus nerve (X) {{will lead to a}} loss of parasympathetic innervation to {{a very large number of}} structures. Major effects of damage to the vagus nerve may include a rise in blood pressure and heart rate. Isolated dysfunction of only the vagus nerve is rare, but can be diagnosed by a <b>hoarse</b> voice, due to dysfunction of one of its branches, the recurrent laryngeal nerve.|$|E
50|$|The song of {{disconnected}} short phrases {{suggests an}} American robin's but is <b>hoarser</b> and rather monotonous. The call {{is described as}} pit-er-ick.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Wolves tear your throats!' muttered Sikes, {{grinding}} his teeth. 'I wish I {{was among}} some of you; you'd howl the <b>hoarser</b> for it.' ...|$|R
60|$|His breath came quicker, {{his voice}} grew <b>hoarser,</b> and he {{crouched}} lower. All his body except his rigid arms quivered {{with a wonderful}} muscular convulsion.|$|R
5|$|When {{taking off}} from the ground the flight is ungainly, with much {{flapping}} of wings. The bird's black wingtips are visible while {{it is in the}} air and once it gathers speed, its flight is much more graceful and it often ascends to great heights. Here it may be barely discernible as it wheels in great circles, sometimes emitting its <b>hoarse</b> cry.|$|E
5|$|After grave {{difficulties}} in rehearsal, Tristan und Isolde premiered at the National Theatre Munich on 10 June 1865, the first Wagner opera premiere in almost 15 years. (The premiere {{had been scheduled}} for 15 May, but was delayed by bailiffs acting for Wagner's creditors, and also because the Isolde, Malvina Schnorr von Carolsfeld, was <b>hoarse</b> and needed time to recover.) The conductor of this premiere was Hans von Bülow, whose wife, Cosima, had given birth in April that year to a daughter, named Isolde, a child not of Bülow but of Wagner.|$|E
5|$|Black-shouldered kites are {{generally}} silent, {{except in the}} breeding season when their calls, though weak, can be persistent. They primarily utter clear whistled 'chee, chee, chee' calls in flight and while hovering, or a <b>hoarse</b> wheezing 'skree-ah' when perched. The call has been confused {{with that of a}} silver gull. A short high whistle is the primary contact call between a pair, while a harsh scraping call is the most common call used by females and large young, and brooding females call to their young with a deep, soft, frog-like croak.|$|E
60|$|But vain was {{all their}} <b>hoarsest</b> bass, Their old {{experience}} out of place, And spite of croaking and entreating, The vote was carried in marsh-meeting.|$|R
6000|$|But if {{when any}} one died [...] Came keeners <b>hoarser</b> than rooks, [...] He bade them give over their keening; [...] For {{he was a}} man of books.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes--yes, I did," [...] jerked out Hardman in a <b>hoarser,</b> lower voice. Something {{about his}} lifelong foe appalled him. He was abject. No {{confession}} of his guilt was needed.|$|R
5|$|McKay {{stated that}} he {{believed}} Kimball could still serve as an apostle even if he underwent a complete laryngectomy and advised him {{to go forward with}} the procedure. Martin subsequently surgically removed one of Kimball's vocal cords and half of the other, leaving him barely able to speak above a <b>hoarse</b> whisper. After several weeks of enforced silence, Kimball slowly recovered, and by November 1957, he was allowed by his physician to resume speaking in public. Kimball's voice remained raspy throughout the rest of his life, and he usually wore an ear-mounted microphone to help magnify his voice, even when he was speaking at normal microphone-equipped pulpits.|$|E
5|$|TBI is {{frequently}} difficult to diagnose and treat. Early diagnosis {{is important to}} prevent complications, which include stenosis (narrowing) of the airway, respiratory tract infection, and damage to the lung tissue. Diagnosis involves procedures such as bronchoscopy, radiography, and x-ray computed tomography to visualize the tracheobronchial tree. Signs and symptoms vary based on the location and severity of the injury; they commonly include dyspnea (difficulty breathing), dysphonia (a condition where the voice can be <b>hoarse,</b> weak, or excessively breathy), coughing, and abnormal breath sounds. In the emergency setting, tracheal intubation {{can be used to}} ensure that the airway remains open. In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to repair a TBI.|$|E
5|$|Both Newt Lee, {{after the}} {{discovery}} of Phagan's body, and the police, just after 4a.m., had unsuccessfully tried to telephone Frank early on Sunday, April 27. The police contacted him later that morning and he agreed to accompany them to the factory. When the police arrived after 7a.m. without telling the specifics of {{what happened at the}} factory, Frank seemed extremely nervous, trembling, and pale; his voice was <b>hoarse,</b> and he was rubbing his hands and asking questions before the police could answer. Frank said he was not familiar with the name Mary Phagan and would need to check his payroll book. The detectives took Frank to the morgue to see Phagan's body and then to the factory, where Frank viewed the crime scene and walked the police through the entire building. Frank returned home about 10:45a.m. At this point, Frank was not considered a suspect.|$|E
60|$|His {{voice had}} grown <b>hoarser</b> and more spent with the {{inevitable}} reaction {{after the long}} and sustained effort, but the vigour of the spirit was untouched, the fervour, the enthusiasm.|$|R
6000|$|Of {{changing}} sentinels {{the distant}} hum, [...] The mirth of feasts, the clang of burnish'd arms, [...] The braying trumpet, and the <b>hoarser</b> drum, [...] Unite {{in concert with}} increas'd alarms.|$|R

5|$|On Thursday, December 12, 1799, Washington {{spent several}} hours {{inspecting}} his plantation on horseback, in snow, hail, and freezing rain; that evening, he ate his supper without changing from his wet clothes. He awoke {{the next morning}} with a severe sore throat and became increasingly <b>hoarse</b> as the day progressed, yet still rode out in the heavy snow, marking trees for cutting on the plantation. Some time around 3a.m. that Saturday, he suddenly awoke with severe difficulty breathing and almost completely unable to speak or swallow. He was {{a firm believer in}} bloodletting, which was a standard medical practice of that era, and he had used it to treat various ailments of slaves on his plantation. He ordered estate overseer Albin Rawlins to remove nearly a pint of his blood.|$|E
5|$|Western jackdaws are voluble birds. The main call, {{frequently}} {{given in}} flight, is a metallic and squeaky chyak-chyak or kak-kak. This is a contact or greeting call. A feeding call made by adults to call young, or males when offering food to their mates, has been transcribed as kiaw or kyow. Females in return give a more drawn out version when begging for food from males, written as kyaay, tchaayk or giaaaa. Perched birds often chatter together, and before settling for the night, large roosting flocks make a cackling noise. Western jackdaws {{also have a}} <b>hoarse,</b> drawn-out alarm call, arrrrr or kaaaarr, used when warning of predators or when mobbing them. Nestlings begin making a soft cheep at about a week of age. As they grow, their voice becomes louder until their call is a penetrating screech around day 18. After this, the voice deepens and softens. From day 25, the young cease calling and become silent if they hear an unfamiliar noise. The European jackdaw can be trained to imitate human speech.|$|E

60|$|There {{was another}} <b>hoarser</b> scream, {{and when it}} died away a low thudding sound crept out of the darkness. Austin swept his gaze upriver, but could only see the shadowy mangroves, for the moon had not come through yet.|$|R
60|$|His {{voice had}} been growing <b>hoarser,</b> {{and there was an}} uncomfortable silence when he stopped. This was not what the men had expected, and {{everybody}} seemed to feel that there was something wrong. Then Ingleby looked at Leger with a little bitter smile.|$|R
6000|$|... "I couldn't {{think of}} taking you by storm like this," [...] Captain Griffiths replied, with a wistfulness which only made his voice sound <b>hoarser</b> and more unpleasant. [...] "It is most kind of you, Lady Cranston. Perhaps you {{will give me}} another opportunity." ...|$|R
25|$|Following {{his final}} guest {{appearance}} on SNL on October 25, 1997 {{there was a}} visible decline in Farley's health. Farley's <b>hoarse</b> voice and flushed skin were the subject of public scrutiny. In {{the final years of}} his life, Farley had sought treatment for obesity and drug abuse on 17 occasions.|$|E
25|$|Pharyngitis is {{inflammation}} {{of the back of}} the throat, known as the pharynx. It typically results in a sore throat and fever. Other symptoms may include a runny nose, cough, headache, a <b>hoarse</b> voice. Symptoms usually last three to five days. Complications can include sinusitis and acute otitis media. Pharyngitis is typically a type of respiratory tract infection.|$|E
25|$|Esophageal {{cancer is}} cancer {{arising from the}} esophagus—the food pipe that runs between the throat and the stomach. Symptoms often include {{difficulty}} in swallowing and weight loss. Other symptoms may include pain when swallowing, a <b>hoarse</b> voice, enlarged lymph nodes ("glands") around the collarbone, a dry cough, and possibly coughing up or vomiting blood.|$|E
60|$|The riot {{round the}} Tree roared itself through its wonted events. Class after {{class of the}} {{undergraduates}} filed in and sank upon the grass below the terraces and parterres of brilliantly dressed ladies within the quadrangle of seats; the alumni pushed themselves together {{against the wall of}} Holder Chapel; the men of the Senior class came last in their grotesque variety of sweaters and second and third best clothes for the scramble at the Tree. The regulation cheers tore from throats that grew <b>hoarser</b> and <b>hoarser,</b> till every class and every favorite in the faculty had been cheered. Then the signal-hat was flung into the air, and the rush at the Tree was made, and the combat' for the flowers that garlanded its burly waist began.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hang, Freshie!" [...] {{bellowed}} {{a freshman}} from the topmost row. It was {{acceptance of the}} challenge, the battle-cry flung down to the Sophs. A roar arose from the pit. The freshmen, outnumbering the sophomores, drowned the roar in a <b>hoarser</b> one. Then both sides settled back in ominous waiting.|$|R
60|$|Another rumble, <b>hoarser</b> {{and more}} ominous than before, lifted itself and hushed the robins and the squirrels. When abreast of them, {{it sounded like}} a {{railroad}} train on a distant trestle. A third rumble, which approached a roar and was of greater duration, began from above and passed by.|$|R
25|$|Throat cancer usually {{begins with}} {{symptoms}} that seem harmless enough, like an enlarged lymph node {{on the outside}} of the neck, a sore throat or a <b>hoarse</b> sounding voice. However, in the case of throat cancer, these conditions may persist and become chronic. There may be a lump or a sore in the throat or neck that does not heal or go away. There may be difficult or painful swallowing. Speaking may become difficult. There may be a persistent earache. Other possible but less common symptoms include some numbness or paralysis of the face muscles.|$|E
25|$|Affected {{individuals}} can exhibit growth retardation, short stature, premature graying of hair, hair loss, wrinkling, prematurely aged faces, beaked noses, skin atrophy (wasting away) with scleroderma-like lesions, {{loss of fat}} tissues, abnormal fat deposition leading to thin legs and arms, and severe ulcerations around the Achilles tendon and malleoli. Other signs include change in voice, making it weak, <b>hoarse,</b> or high-pitched; atrophy of gonads, leading to reduced fertility; bilateral cataracts (clouding of lens); premature arteriosclerosis (thickening and loss of elasticity of arteries); calcinosis (calcium deposits in blood vessels); atherosclerosis (blockage of blood vessels); type 2 diabetes; loss of bone mass; telangiectasia; and malignancies. In fact, the prevalence of rare cancers, such as meningiomas, are increased in individuals with Werner syndrome.|$|E
25|$|This glossy all-black crow has a {{heavy black}} bill with an arching culmen (upper {{edge of the}} mandible) and has a fine tip. The {{feathers}} have a purple gloss throughout. The tail of the Indian jungle crow is rounded and the legs and feet are stout. The Himalayan japonensis (in this sense including western intermedius and eastern tibetosinensis) has a slightly wedge-shaped tail and a voice is a guttural and grating graak (intermedius) or a <b>hoarse</b> kyarrh (tibetosinensis). The calls of the Indian jungle crow are not unlike that of the house crow but are harsher. In Sri Lanka, the house crow lacks the light grey neck but the neck is slimmer than in the jungle crow. The sexes are indistinguishable.|$|E
6000|$|... "His Government!" [...] echoed Bunker, with a <b>hoarser</b> laugh; [...] "hear him!--HIS Government!
