5|$|Both {{males and}} females utilize calls <b>in</b> <b>alarm</b> situations, {{especially}} in territorial disputes and encounters with predators. Males alone produce the cheer call, which can sound indistinct. In southern regions of their range, the sound males use <b>in</b> <b>alarm</b> disputes is a ringing pink or p'dink sound. Females {{are the only ones}} that can perform the paired dit-dit or chatter sounds. The former can be used in territorial disputes with predators, and with at least northern populations the songs are used in alternation with the males cheer chant. The chatter is used exclusively with territorial encounters with male song, and the song can either follow or overlap her mate's song.|$|E
5|$|While an Australian Cattle Dog {{generally}} works silently, it will bark <b>in</b> <b>alarm</b> or {{to attract}} attention. It has a distinctive intense, high-pitched bark. Barking {{can be a}} sign of boredom or frustration, although research has shown that pet dogs increase their vocalisation when raised in a noisy environment. It responds well to familiar dogs, but when multiple dogs are present, establishing a pecking order can trigger aggression. It is not a breed that lives in a pack with other dogs.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} usually found in small groups, {{although}} substantial flocks can form at favoured sites. It walks well, without waddling, {{and although it}} normally feeds by upending, it can dive if necessary. It does not often perch in trees, unlike other whistling ducks. It flies at low altitude with slow wingbeats and trailing feet, in loose flocks rather than tight formation. It feeds {{during the day and}} at night in fairly large flocks, often with other whistling duck species, but rests or sleeps in smaller groups {{in the middle of the}} day. They are noisy and display their aggression towards other individuals by throwing back their heads. Before taking off <b>in</b> <b>alarm,</b> they often shake their head sideways.|$|E

5|$|In the {{improved}} vigilance effect, groups {{are able to}} detect predators sooner than solitary individuals. For many predators, success depends on surprise. If the prey is alerted early in an attack, they have an improved chance of escape. For example, wood pigeon flocks are preyed upon by goshawks. Goshawks are less successful when attacking larger flocks of wood pigeons than they are when attacking smaller flocks. This is because the larger the flock size, {{the more likely it}} is that one bird will notice the hawk sooner and fly away. Once one pigeon flies off <b>in</b> <b>alarm,</b> the rest of the pigeons follow. Wild ostriches in Tsavo National Park in Kenya feed either alone or in groups of up to four birds. They are subject to predation by lions. As the ostrich group size increases, the frequency at which each individual raises it head to look for predators decreases. Because ostriches are able to run at speeds that exceed those of lions for great distances, lions try to attack an ostrich when its head is down. By grouping, the ostriches present the lions with greater difficulty in determining how long the ostriches' heads stay down. Thus, although individual vigilance decreases, the overall vigilance of the group increases.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} calls are a loud pia-ow or may-awe. The {{frequency}} of calling increases before the Monsoon season {{and may be}} delivered <b>in</b> <b>alarm</b> or when disturbed by loud noises.

25|$|An {{addressable}} system gives each detector {{an individual}} number, or address. Addressable systems allow {{the exact location}} of an alarm to be plotted on the FACP, while allowing several detectors to be connected to the same zone.

25|$|Primary batteries, or primary cells, {{can produce}} current {{immediately}} on assembly.

Disposable primary cells cannot be reliably recharged, since the chemical reactions are not easily reversible and active materials may not return to their original forms. Battery manufacturers recommend against attempting to recharge primary cells. In general, these have higher energy densities than rechargeable batteries, but disposable batteries do not fare well under high-drain applications with loads under 75 ohms (75 Ω). Common types of disposable batteries include zinc–carbon batteries and alkaline batteries.|$|E

25|$|Encosternum delegorguei are {{collected}} {{just before dawn}} when they are least active and are easier to catch. They are caught carefully, {{taking care not to}} kill them. The chemicals released by the bugs can often stain the hands of collectors orange if they collect them barehanded. The bugs which died during collection are carefully separated from live bugs. This is because the chemicals stored in the stink glands are unpalatable - being extremely bitter. As dead bugs can not release the remaining chemicals in their bodies, they are deemed unsuitable for consumption and discarded. The remaining live bugs are placed in a bucket {{with a small amount of}} warm water. This is then carefully agitated so as to make them release all their defense chemicals <b>in</b> <b>alarm.</b> This is repeated several more times until their stink glands are drained.|$|E
25|$|At {{any time}} of the year, but {{especially}} when the rains commence, a male will spend hours calling from a conspicuous perch. A clear, somewhat variable, whistled phrase of three to five syllables is typical, which may be rendered as tseep-tseeoo, teeoo-teewee or chiwiki-chiwi. The song may be changed after each 20 or so repetitions. During some intermissions the wings are audibly fluttered in the few seconds between phrases. This results in a quick prrrrt or phrrrp rattle, and may lift the bird off its perch. The crest is also lifted during display. It may alternatively sing a rudimentary song consisting of whistles, tweets and trills (distinguishable as imitated calls), during short flights over the grass or during an upward spiraling flight, before it planes down. Race malbranti in particular, may sing during a straight and direct display flight and clap its wings above its back. Perched males may also string together fragments of the songs of various grassland birds. It utters peewit, tweekiree or pree, pree notes <b>in</b> <b>alarm.</b>|$|E
25|$|Since {{appeasement}} only {{appeared to}} encourage the Japanese crew, who were joined by their compatriots from a nearby shipwreck, the Portuguese authorities hardened their stance lest the Japanese tried to take over Macau. On November 30, the Japanese gang got into a serious brawl. When the Portuguese ouvidor (magistrate) came to stop the fight, he got injured and his retainers killed. Church bells were sounded <b>in</b> <b>alarm</b> following this incident, and Captain-major André Pessoa arrived at the scene with all available armed reinforcements. The Japanese fled and took refuge in two houses, which were quickly surrounded by Portuguese soldiers. Pessoa offered quarter {{to those who would}} surrender, but 27 of those in the first house refused and were gunned down when they were forced out of the house by fire. The Jesuits and the Bishop of Macau intervened as Pessoa prepared to storm the second house, and the Japanese there, numbering around 50, were induced to surrender on the promise of life and freedom. However, Pessoa had the suspected ringleaders strangled in jail, while the rest were allowed to leave Macau after signing an affidavit absolving the Portuguese from all blame.|$|E

500|$|Hugh Seymour {{was born}} in 1759 {{into one of the}} wealthiest {{families}} in England, as the fifth son of Francis Seymour-Conway, 1st Marquess of Hertford, and his wife Isabella Fitzroy (Hugh retained the surname [...] "Seymour-Conway" [...] until his father's death in 1794, at which point he shortened it to Seymour). He was initially educated at Bracken's Academy in Greenwich, where he met lifelong friend John Willett Payne, before joining the Navy at age 11 at his own insistence. Seymour became a captain's servant on the yacht William & Mary, and two years later moved to HMS Pearl under his relation Captain John Leveson-Gower, stationed off Newfoundland. After several short commissions, including service in the West Indies under George Rodney, Seymour was attached to HMS Alarm as a midshipman in the Mediterranean. Apart from a brief spell in HMS Trident, Seymour remained on her for several years, becoming a lieutenant in 1776. By 1776 the American Revolutionary War was underway, and Seymour continued <b>in</b> <b>Alarm</b> until he was made a commander in 1778, taking command of the xebec HMS Minorca.|$|E

2500|$|The word [...] "conventional" [...] is slang used to {{distinguish}} the method used {{to communicate with the}} control unit in newer addressable systems. So called [...] "conventional detectors" [...] are smoke detectors used in older interconnected systems and resemble electrical switches by their way of working. These detectors are connected in parallel to the signaling path so that the current flow is monitored to indicate a closure of the circuit path by any connected detector when smoke or other similar environmental stimulus sufficiently influences any detector. The resulting increase in current flow (or a dead short) is interpreted and processed by the control unit as a confirmation of the presence of smoke and a fire alarm signal is generated. In a conventional system, smoke detectors are typically wired together in each zone and a single fire alarm control panel usually monitors a number of zones which can be arranged to correspond to different areas of a building. In the event of a fire, the control panel is able to identify which zone or zones contain the detector or detectors <b>in</b> <b>alarm,</b> but can not identify which individual detector or detectors {{are in a state of}} alarm.|$|E
