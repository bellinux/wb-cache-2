2500|$|As the {{electric}} utility industry continued to prosper and expand, Couch began to devote some {{attention to his}} <b>earlier</b> <b>interest,</b> locomotives and the railway. A group of investors, led by Couch, gained control of the Louisiana and Arkansas Railway and the Louisiana Navigation & Railway Company {{for a total of}} $27 million. [...] Following Interstate Commerce Commission approval, Couch became president of the Kansas City Southern Railway in 1927, and merged all three railways into the K.C.S.-L. System. [...] He created a syndicate of ownership and operators, among those, younger brother Peter Couch, assumed the role of vice-president and general manager. [...] Couch finally had his railway empire that he dreamt of as a child. This organized system, spanning four states, provided direct access from the Midwest to the Gulf Coast. Thousands of jobs were created through railway employment and small businesses that sprouted with the birth of new communities that formed along the railway thoroughfares.|$|E

50|$|His {{reputation}} in oceanography was primarily {{founded on a}} set of papers on non-linear interactions in ocean waves. In these he adapted Feynman diagram formalism to classical random wave fields.

This led him to review the field of plasma physics, rekindling an <b>earlier</b> <b>interest</b> in Quantum Field Theory.|$|E
