40|$|The fish {{samples were}} cleaned up by Florisil, then {{analyzed}} by GC-EI-MS to determine eight phthalic acid esters, diethyl phthalate (DEP), dipropyl phthalate (DPrP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), {{butyl benzyl phthalate}} (BBP), dipentyl phthalate (DPeP), dicyclohexyl phthalate (DCHP), <b>dihexyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> (DHP) and diethyl hexyl phthalate (DEHP). The external standard and internal standard method were compared, and the pretreatment method was optimized. Especially, the problem of analytical blank control in this experiment was discussed carefully. The linear range of the method was 50. 0 similar to 800 mu g. L- 1, and the linear cor relation coefficient (R) was higher than 0. 99986. The relative standard deviation of the method was less than 12. 7 % with the recovery values ranging from 74 % to 113 %. The limit of detection was lower than 3. 66 mu g. L- 1. The linear range, accuracy, precision and limit of detection of this method can satisfy the request of simultaneous analysis of PAEs in fish by GC-EI-MS...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{occurrence}} {{and distribution}} of organic pollutants were investigated and their initial aquatic ecological risks were assessed in water of the Yangtze River Estuary (YRE). A total of 18 samples were collected from South Branch of YRE during the flood season in August 2012. Out of 956 organic compounds, 23 organic pollutants were detected by GC-MS and NAGINATATM software which were dominated by phthalate esters (PAEs), petroleum hydrocarbons (PHCs) and substituted benzenes. The total concentration of detected 23 organic pollutants varied from 0. 585 to 53. 7 μg/L in the studied sites. Moreover, the total amounts of PAEs (∑PAEs), PHCs (∑PHCs) and substituted benzenes (∑substituted benzenes) were {{in the range of}} 0. 184 - 53. 344 μg/L, 0 - 0. 164 μg/L, and 0. 196 - 1. 559 μg/L, respectively. The study revealed that PEC/PNEC ratios of 8 organic pollutants were higher than 1 (PEC: Predicted environmental concentration; PNEC: Predicted no effect concentration), while 3 of them Bis(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate, octadecane and nonadecane were found to be > 100 and the remaining organic pollutants including diisobutyl phthalate, tridecane, <b>dihexyl</b> <b>phthalate,</b> methyl palmitate and methyl stearate ranged from 1 to 100. These results indicated significant ecological risks of the specific organic pollutants to the aquatic environment of YRE...|$|E
