25|$|Adult sloth bears may {{travel in}} pairs, with the males being gentle with cubs. They may fight for food. They {{walk in a}} slow, shambling motion, with their feet being set down in a noisy, {{flapping}} motion. They are capable of galloping faster than running humans. Although they appear slow and clumsy, both young and adult sloth bears are excellent climbers. They climb to feed and to rest, though not to escape enemies, as they prefer to stand their ground. Sloth bear mothers carry cubs up to 9 months old on their backs instead of sending their cubs up trees as the primary defense against attacks by predators, such as tigers, leopards, and other bears. They are capable of climbing on smooth surfaces and hanging upside down like sloths. They are good swimmers, and primarily enter water to play. To mark their territories, sloth bears scrape trees with their forepaws, and rub against them with their flanks. Sloth bears have a great vocal range. Gary Brown, in his Great Bear Almanac, lists over 25 different sounds in 16 different contexts. Sounds such as barks, screams, grunts, roars, snarls, whickers, woofs, and yelps are made when angered, threatening, or when fighting. When hurt or afraid, they shriek, yowl, or whimper. When feeding, sloth bears make loud <b>huffing</b> <b>and</b> sucking noises, which can be heard over 100 m away. Sounds such as gurgling or humming are made by bears resting or sucking their paws. Sows emit crooning sounds to their cubs. The species is the most vociferous when mating, and make loud, melodious calls when doing so. Sloth bears do not hibernate. They make their day beds out of broken branches in trees, and rest in caves during the wet season. Sloth bears are the most nocturnal of bears, though sows become more active in daytime when with cubs.|$|E

40|$|With {{superheated}} steam {{there is no}} direct relationship between temperature and pressure, and it can exist at a wide range of temperatures. Superheated steam with high degree(> 50 °C) of superheat has similar thermal physical characteristics with ideal gas and the heat transfer coefficient is 1 / 150 - 1 / 250 as much as that of saturated steam during heat transferring. It could release less energy and transmitted longer distances than that of saturated steam in heavy oil reservoirs. Numerical simulation shows that under the condition of carrying the same heat, {{superheated steam}} <b>huff</b> <b>and</b> puff enlarged the heating radius by about 10 m, oil production increment by 1463 t, oil steam ratio increase by 0. 7. Superheated steam <b>huff</b> <b>and</b> puff was put into Kazakstan’s heavy oil reservoir after saturated steam <b>huff</b> <b>and</b> puff and the average daily oil production was 2 - 4 times that of saturated steam <b>huff</b> <b>and</b> puff, which improved heavy oil production effectively.

40|$|A novel {{method for}} hydrate {{production}} named "Five-spot thermal <b>huff</b> <b>and</b> puff (HP- 5 S) '' is designed and employed {{to investigate the}} behaviors of hydrate dissociation in the Cubic Hydrate Simulator (CHS). This method uses the thermal <b>huff</b> <b>and</b> puff method in a five-spot well system. In addition, the experiments with the methods of the five-spot thermal <b>huff</b> <b>and</b> puff in conjunction with depressurization (HP- 5 S-D), the heat stimulation with a five-spot well (HS- 5 S), the heat stimulation in conjunction with depressurization with a five-spot well (HS- 5 S-D), the thermal <b>huff</b> <b>and</b> puff (HP), <b>and</b> the <b>huff</b> <b>and</b> puff in conjunction with depressurization (HP-D), are also carried out in this work. The energy efficiencies, thermal efficiencies, gas recoveries, and average gas production rates are used to evaluate these production methods. The analysis of hydrate decomposition shows that the thermal <b>huff</b> <b>and</b> puff method in a five-spot well system is superior {{to that in a}} single vertical well on the aspects of the energy efficiency, thermal efficiency, gas recovery, and average gas production rate. The HP- 5 S-D method, which can obtain the highest gas recovery, thermal efficiency, and energy efficiency, is the optimal method for hydrate production in this work. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The thermal <b>huff</b> <b>and</b> puff process is analyzed, and it is concluded that each <b>huff</b> <b>and</b> puff cycle includes three stages: heat injection, soaking, and gas production The injected heat spreads out from the injection point. The region impacted by heat diffusion enlarges as the number of <b>huff</b> <b>and</b> puff cycles increases and eventually reaches the largest impact region.
