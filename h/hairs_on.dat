5|$|Cyathus helenae is {{distinguished}} from the more common C.striatus by its faint inner-surface plication (C.striatus has a more pronounced plication), the nodular arrangement of the <b>hairs</b> <b>on</b> the outer surface, and microscopically by the spore shape – ellipsoid in C.striatus, ovoid or spheroidal in C.helenae.|$|E
50|$|Markus J. Rantala of the Department of Biological and Environmental Science, University of Jyväskylä, Finland, {{said the}} {{existence}} of androgen dependent <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> men {{could be explained by}} sexual attraction whereby <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> the genitals would trap pheromones and <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> the chin would make the chin appear more massive.|$|R

50|$|The Northern Sumatran {{rhinoceros}} is {{the largest}} subspecies. It has longer <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> the ears and longer horns. However, it may have less <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> the body than the Western Sumatran rhinoceros.|$|R
5|$|The {{little brown}} bat can be {{distinguished}} from the Indiana bat {{by the absence of}} a keel on the caclar and long <b>hairs</b> <b>on</b> the hind feet that stretch longer than the toes. Compared to the long-legged bat, the brown bat has a shorter tibia and lesser amounts of ventral wing hair in addition to the lack of a keel on the caclar.|$|E
5|$|The small, rounded {{ears are}} covered with dense golden <b>hairs</b> <b>on</b> the outer and with reddish brown <b>hairs</b> <b>on</b> the inner surface. The mystacial vibrissae (whiskers on the upper lip) are long, usually {{extending}} a little beyond the ears when laid back against the head, but the superciliary vibrissae (whiskers above the eyes) are short and do not extend beyond the ears. The upper surface on the forefeet is covered with brown fur, and there is white or silvery fur on the digits. Ungual tufts (fur around the bases of the claws) are present on the second through fourth digits. On the short, fairly broad hindfeet, the upper side is covered densely with silvery to white hairs near {{the tips of the}} feet and toes, and with brown fur otherwise. No other oryzomyine has such brown fur on its hindfeet. The second through fourth digits have long silvery-white ungual tufts, but those on the first digit are short. On the sole, the pads are very large. Among oryzomyines, only Oecomys and the extinct Megalomys have similarly large pads between their digits. There is a dense cover of short brown <b>hairs</b> <b>on</b> both the upper and lower sides of the tail. Unlike in Eremoryzomys, the tail is the same color above and below. The tail ends in a tuft, an unusual feature among oryzomyines.|$|E
5|$|A {{medium-sized}} gray bat, Myotis escalerai {{is similar}} to Myotis nattereri. The fur is long and soft; with a brown tone on the back, and the brighter underparts approaching white. The feet are dark gray. Much of the face is pink, and the muzzle is pointed, with long <b>hairs</b> <b>on</b> the upper lip resembling a moustache. The long ears are brown to gray. The tragus, a projection {{on the inner side}} of the outer ear, is long and reaches {{to the middle of the}} ear and colored gray to yellow, becoming darker from the base towards the tip. According to several authors, it differs from M.nattereri in showing a distinct fringe of <b>hairs</b> <b>on</b> the tail membrane, but bat specialist A.M. Hutson writes that this feature does not distinguish the two species. In addition, the presence of an S-shaped spur on the uropatagium (membrane between the hind legs), which approaches the middle of the membrane, is a distinctive feature of this species. With its broad wings, low flight, and rapid wingbeats, the species is capable of precise, agile flight.|$|E

5|$|Angle {{made his}} debut for Mexican {{promotion}} Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide (AAA) on August 5, 2012 at Triplemanía XX, where he {{teamed up with}} Jeff Jarrett as Team Dorian Roldán in a hair vs. hair match, where they faced Team Joaquín Roldán (Electroshock and L.A. Park), with the Roldáns' <b>hairs</b> <b>on</b> the line. Electroshock won the match for his team by pinning Angle, forcing Dorian to have his head shaved bald. However, after the match, Angle, Jarrett and Dorian overpowered the winners and shaved Joaquín bald.|$|E
5|$|Aquatic beetles use several {{techniques}} for retaining air beneath the water's surface. Diving beetles (Dytiscidae) hold air between the abdomen and the elytra when diving. Hydrophilidae have <b>hairs</b> <b>on</b> their under surface that retain {{a layer of}} air against their bodies. Adult crawling water beetles use both their elytra and their hind coxae (the basal segment of the back legs) in air retention, while whirligig beetles simply carry an air bubble down with them whenever they dive.|$|E
5|$|In the wild, X.bracteatum can be {{distinguished}} from X.bicolor in Tasmania by its broader leaves and cobwebby <b>hairs</b> <b>on</b> the stems, and from X.macranthum in Western Australia by the flower head colour; the latter species has white flower heads whereas those of X.bracteatum are golden yellow. Xerochrysum subundulatum from alpine and subalpine areas of New South Wales, Victoria, and Tasmania is rhizomatous, and has markedly pointed orange bracts. The eastern Australian species X. viscosum may {{be distinguished}} by its rough and sticky leaves.|$|E

5|$|Joseph Maiden {{described}} variety lucida in 1902, and Bailey described variety glabrescens in 1913. Both had diagnosed their varieties on {{the basis}} of their hairlessness. Maiden described a taxon totally devoid of hair, while Bailey described his as nearly glabrous (hairless). As Bailey's description more closely matched Dixon's findings (that these variants were only partly and not completely hairless), Dixon retained Bailey's name and reclassified it as Ficus rubiginosa forma glabrescens in 2001 as it differed only in the lack of <b>hairs</b> <b>on</b> new growth from the nominate form.|$|E
5|$|The larva is a {{voracious}} predator. Within a {{few minutes}} of seizing its prey with its jaws and injecting it with venom and enzymes, it begins to suck out the digestion products. The larva is extremely sensitive to ground vibrations, the low-frequency sounds made by an insect crawling across the ground; the larva locates the source of the vibrations by the differences in timing of the arrival of waves detected by receptors, tufts of <b>hairs</b> <b>on</b> the sides of the two hindmost thoracic segments.|$|E
5|$|The queen {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to the worker, {{but they are the}} largest members of the colony. The hair is more abundant, and the head is broader. The mandibles are shorter and broader, although they are still as long as the head. The wings are yellowish in colour and translucent in appearance. Males are the smallest members of the colony and can be easily identifiable by their perceptibly smaller mandibles. The <b>hairs</b> <b>on</b> males are the longest and most abundant among the worker and queen castes, with a long and broad head.|$|E

60|$|That's a {{funny thing}} for hair to do--rise up all of a sudden--isn't it? But that is just what the <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> Farmer Brown's boy's head did the day he went fishing in the Laughing Brook and had no luck at all. There are just two things that make hair rise--anger and fear. Anger {{sometimes}} makes the <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> the back and neck of Bowser the Hound and of some other little people bristle and stand up, {{and you know the}} <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> the tail of Black Pussy stands on end until her tail looks twice as big as it really is. Both anger and fear make it do that. But there is only one thing that can make the <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> the head of Farmer Brown's boy rise, and as it isn't anger, of course it must be fear.|$|R

5|$|Cyathus olla bears a {{resemblance}} to a miniature bird's nest containing eggs, hence the common name bird's nest fungi. The fruiting body, or peridium, is roughly funnel-shaped, 10–18mm tall and 8–12mm wide. It is greyish yellow or greyish brown to fawn-colored {{and covered with}} even, fine-textured <b>hairs</b> <b>on</b> the outside surface. The inner surface is silver grey and smooth, often with faint transverse ridges. Cyathus olla is thick-walled, and flared outwards at the rim; the rim is typically wavy in outline. The 'eggs', or peridioles, typically number 8 to 10 in the cup, and they are white or grey in color, with a diameter of 2–4mm—conspicuously larger than other Cyathus species. They are covered with a thin membrane called a tunica.|$|E
5|$|In summer, the fur of the Djungarian hamster on {{the back}} changes from ash-grey to dark brown, or {{sometimes}} pale brown with a tint. The face changes to grey or brown, while the mouth area, the whisker area, and the ears are slightly brighter. The outer ears and the eyes have black edges. The rest of the head is dark brown or black. From the head to the tail runs a black-brown dorsal stripe. The throat, belly, tail and limbs are white. The ears are grey with a pinkish tint with scattered black hairs. The <b>hairs</b> <b>on</b> the underside are completely white.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the family}} Theraphosidae, which {{includes}} tarantulas and baboon spiders, have urticating <b>hairs</b> <b>on</b> their abdomens and use their legs to flick them at attackers. These hairs are fine setae (bristles) with fragile bases and a row of barbs on the tip. The barbs cause intense irritation {{but there is no}} evidence that they carry any kind of venom. A few defend themselves against wasps by including networks of very robust threads in their webs, giving the spider time to flee while the wasps are struggling with the obstacles. The golden wheeling spider, Carparachne aureoflava, of the Namibian desert escapes parasitic wasps by flipping onto its side and cartwheeling down sand dunes.|$|E

5|$|Myotis alcathoe is the {{smallest}} European Myotis species. The fur is brownish on the upperparts, with a reddish tone in old specimens, and a slightly paler gray-brown below. Younger animals may be completely gray-brown. The brown fur distinguishes adult M.alcathoe from other whiskered bats, but juveniles cannot be unambiguously identified {{on the basis of}} morphology. M.alcathoe is similar to Daubenton's bat (Myotis daubentonii) and M.emarginatus in color. On the upper side of the body, the hairs are 6 to 8mm long and have dark bases and brown tips. The <b>hairs</b> <b>on</b> the lower side of the body are only slightly paler at the tip than at the base.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys albiventer is a {{large and}} long-tailed Oryzomys. The upperparts are brightly ochraceous, {{becoming}} grayer toward the front. The <b>hairs</b> <b>on</b> the underparts are pale gray near the bases and white in the outer half, so that the underparts appear pale grayish according to Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales (not white as claimed by Merriman). The tail is dark above and light below. The skull and molars are relatively robust. O.albiventer has broad zygomatic arches (cheekbones), long incisive foramina (perforations of the palate between the incisors and the molars), and long nasal bones that extend behind the premaxillary bones. Compared to its lowland relative O.couesi mexicanus, O.albiventer is larger and more brightly colored and has larger molars but narrower incisive foramina.|$|E
5|$|Species of Voalavo are small, gray, mouse-like rodents, {{among the}} {{smallest}} nesomyines. They lack the distinctive tuft of long <b>hairs</b> <b>on</b> the tail that {{is characteristic of}} Eliurus. The tail is long and females have six mammae. In Voalavo, there are two glands on the chest (absent in Eliurus) that produce a sweet-smelling musk in breeding males. In the skull, the facial skeleton is long and the braincase is smooth. The incisive foramina (openings in the front part of the palate) are long and the bony palate itself is smooth. The molars are somewhat hypsodont (high-crowned), though less so than in Eliurus, and the third molars are reduced in size and complexity.|$|E
