5|$|Heat {{levels on}} the speeder must be monitored, as {{although}} there are no set top speeds for the vehicles, they can explode <b>if</b> <b>allowed</b> to overheat. Heat builds up from acceleration and from collisions. To counteract this, the player may activate the onboard cooler, however, this will slow the vehicle down. Designated cooling strips along the track and the Ice power-up can cool the vehicle without a speed penalty, allowing the player to continue accelerating.|$|E

In The Office Wife (1930), several of Joan Blondell's disrobing maneuvers were strictly forbidden and the implied image of the actress being naked just off-screen was deemed too suggestive even though it relied upon the audience using their imaginations, so post-Code releases of the film had scenes which were blurred or rendered indistinct, <b>if</b> <b>allowed</b> at all.|$|E

5|$|Near {{the surface}} of the Earth, its {{magnetic}} field can be closely approximated by the field of a magnetic dipole positioned {{at the center of the}} Earth and tilted at an angle of about 11° with respect to the rotational axis of the Earth. The dipole is roughly equivalent to a powerful bar magnet, with its south pole pointing towards the geomagnetic North Pole. This may seem surprising, but the north pole of a magnet is so defined because, <b>if</b> <b>allowed</b> to rotate freely, it points roughly northward (in the geographic sense). Since the north pole of a magnet attracts the south poles of other magnets and repels the north poles, it must be attracted to the south pole of Earth's magnet. The dipolar field accounts for 80–90% of the field in most locations.|$|E
5|$|The Buckeye is {{the only}} purely American breed to sport a pea comb, and this, {{combined}} with its stocky build, makes it a supremely cold hardy chicken. Other breeds of fowl developed in the U.S. (such as the Ameraucana) may sport pea combs, but these chickens were primarily created from foreign birds. It also bears some traits of Game fowl in frame and disposition, being assertive in character {{and a very good}} forager. Generally calm, the cock birds in rare cases may become aggressive. Despite its game heritage, it tolerates confinement well, although it will be much happier and produce better <b>if</b> <b>allowed</b> to range on grass. The Buckeye is said by breeders to be disinclined towards feather picking. A good meat producer and layer of between 150 and 200 eggs per year, the Buckeye is a dual purpose chicken wellsuited to small farmyard and backyard flocks.|$|E

25|$|Ammonium {{carbamate}} {{solutions are}} notoriously corrosive to metallic construction materials, even more resistant forms of stainless steel—especially in the hottest {{parts of the}} plant such as the stripper. Traditionally corrosion has been minimized (although not eliminated) by continuously injecting {{a small amount of}} oxygen (as air) into the plant to establish and maintain a passive oxide layer on exposed stainless steel surfaces.
