5|$|Lithium {{is found}} in trace amount in {{numerous}} plants, plankton, and invertebrates, at concentrations of 69 to 5,760 parts per billion (ppb). In vertebrates the concentration is slightly lower, and nearly all vertebrate tissue and body fluids contain lithium ranging from 21 to 763 ppb. Marine organisms tend to bioaccumulate lithium more than terrestrial organisms. Whether lithium has a physiological role <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> organisms is unknown.|$|E

5|$|Other {{groups of}} archaea use {{sunlight}} {{as a source}} of energy (they are phototrophs). However, oxygen–generating photosynthesis does not occur <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> organisms. Many basic metabolic pathways are shared between all forms of life; for example, archaea use a modified form of glycolysis (the Entner–Doudoroff pathway) and either a complete or partial citric acid cycle. These similarities to other organisms probably reflect both early origins in the history of life and their high level of efficiency.|$|E

5|$|Coconut crabs {{live in the}} Indian Ocean and {{the central}} Pacific Ocean, with a {{distribution}} that closely matches that of the coconut palm. The western limit {{of the range of}} B. latro is Zanzibar, off the coast of Tanzania, while the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn mark the northern and southern limits, respectively, with very few population in the subtropics, such as the Ryukyu Islands. There is evidence that the coconut crab once lived on the mainlands of Australia and Madagascar and on the island of Mauritius, but it no longer occurs <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> places. As they cannot swim as adults, coconut crabs must have colonised the islands as planktonic larvae.|$|E
