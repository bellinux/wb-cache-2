5|$|Skye {{tries to}} defend them both, {{but when the}} team finds {{evidence}} that Lydon was paid substantially for the information, she turns on him and cooperates with the agents. The team tracks the buyer, Raina, to a Project Centipede facility in Hong Kong, where they are draining Chan's fire-resistant platelets against his will, to use as stabilizers for the extremis serum within their super-soldiers. Chan, angry with this betrayal and with S.H.I.E.L.D. for constricting him, attacks both. He kills, among others, Quan and the Centipede head doctor Debbie. Realizing that Chan can't be reasoned with, Coulson and May inject him with a large dose of extremis, causing him to explode. Lydon, convinced that what he <b>did</b> <b>is</b> harming people, helps by using his hacking skills to direct the blast through the ventilation and out {{the top of the}} building, while the others escape to safety.|$|E
5|$|In {{that same}} year, Edmund Grey, {{the son of}} a Marick family maid and gardener, returns to town to see his {{childhood}} friend, Angelique. Dimitri is furious to see Edmund again since he had stolen money from Dimitri's father to pay for his education. Dimitri is stunned when Edmund informs him that they are half-brothers. Edmund had discovered this when he found a will of Hugo Marick that states he is not only his illegitimate son, but that he is the lawful heir to Wildwind. Helga had planted the will because she believed Dimitri was going to leave Angelique for Erica. When Dimitri assures Helga he will stay with Angelique, she destroys the will {{in order to keep the}} estate for her daughter. Edmund accuses Dimitri of stealing the will and files a lawsuit to have Hugo's body exhumed in order to perform a DNA test. Dimitri believes Edmund is lying about everything and is infuriated by the lawsuit. The hatred between the two deepens even more. Eventually, the truth about what Helga <b>did</b> <b>is</b> revealed and she dies. Dimitri and Edmund agree to put the past behind them and they bond as brothers. They develop an extremely close and loving relationship, but they also continue to have a standing rivalry.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause of}} <b>DID</b> <b>is</b> unknown and widely debated, with debate {{occurring}} between supporters of different hypotheses: that <b>DID</b> <b>is</b> {{a reaction to}} trauma; that <b>DID</b> <b>is</b> produced by inappropriate psychotherapeutic techniques that cause a patient to enact {{the role of a}} patient with DID; and newer hypotheses involving memory processing that allows for the possibility that trauma-causing dissociation can occur after childhood in DID, as it does in PTSD. It has been suggested that all the trauma-based and stress-related disorders be placed in one category that would include both DID and PTSD. Disturbed and altered sleep has also been suggested as having a role in dissociative disorders in general and specifically in DID, alterations in environments also largely affecting the DID patient.|$|E

Emma makes a deal with Regina in which she leaves but still visits Henry on occasion.|$|E
25|$|Once La Rue {{was engaged}} with the Grande chapelle, he made two trips to Spain. On the second trip, in 1506, he was shipwrecked in the English Channel, and spent three {{months at the}} court of Henry VII of England. After two more years in Spain, {{in the service of}} Juana of Castile – Joanna the Mad – he {{returned}} to the Netherlands in 1508, probably because Juana had been forced out of power (her husband, Philip, had died of typhus in 1506). Juana was inconsolable, unable to leave the corpse of her dead husband, and had become quite insane; why La Rue stayed as long as he <b>did</b> <b>is</b> not known, but it is not impossible that his dark, intensely expressive music {{was one of the few}} things that brought her solace. In addition, he was treated well. Juana promoted him to premier chapelain, the head of the chapel, and paid him twice what the other singers received; paying the singers was apparently the one of the only practical administrative matters she was able to do during the period of her madness.|$|E

25|$|After {{trying to}} escape the dollhouse in the season five finale, Charles punishes Emily, Hanna, Spencer, Aria, and Mona, {{subjecting}} them to various types of torture while Alison, Ezra, Caleb, and Toby {{try to find a}} way to help find the girls. Andrew becomes a suspect after being reported missing. Realizing what Charles is planning to do with Alison, the Liars hatch a plan to get out of the dollhouse by setting his vault on fire. The plan worked successfully, and the girls get out of the dollhouse where they are met by Alison, Ezra, Caleb, Toby, and the police. Andrew is arrested and accused of kidnapping the girls. However, the girls are far from okay, as they all suffer from PTSD from their time in captivity. Another girl, Sara Harvey, who went missing the same time Ali <b>did,</b> <b>is</b> found in the dollhouse, reportedly having been held there for two years. Unable to deal with her home life, she runs away and stays with Emily for a while. Meanwhile, Ali tries to get answers out of her dad about Charles DiLaurentis, but he insists there is no one of that name in their family; however, Jason remembers Charles as his imaginary friend when he was a kid. Later, Andrew is released from police custody because of lack of evidence, and the Liars realize that he isn't Charles after all.|$|E
25|$|Croydon is {{a gateway}} to the south from central London, and {{therefore}} {{has a number of}} major roads running through it. Purley Way on the A23 road was built to by-pass Croydon town centre on which the A23 once <b>did,</b> <b>is</b> one of the busiest roads in the borough, and has been the site of several major retail developments including one of only 18 IKEA stores in the country, built {{on the site of the}} former power station. It carries on to Brighton Road which is the main route running towards the south from Croydon to Purley and continues on the A23. The centre of Croydon is very congested, and the urban planning has since become out of date and quite inadequate, due to the expansion of Croydon's main shopping area and office blocks. Wellesley Road, is a dual carriageway that cuts through the centre of the town, and makes it hard to interchange between the civic centre's two railway stations. Croydon Vision 2020 includes a plan for a more pedestrian-friendly replacement. It has also been named as one of the worst roads for cyclists in the area. Construction of the Croydon Underpass beneath the junction of George Street and Wellesley Road/Park Lane during the early Sixties started, with the main aim to prevent traffic congestion on Park Lane, situated above the underpass. The Croydon Flyover on the other hand is situated near the underpass and next to Taberner House. It mainly leads traffic on to Duppas Hill, towards Purley Way with the intention for easy links with Sutton and Kingston upon Thames further afield. The major junction on the flyover is for Old Town, which is also a large three-lane road.|$|E

500|$|And the Band Played On was {{critically}} acclaimed {{and became a}} best-seller. Judith Eannarino of the Library Journal called it [...] "one {{of the most important}} books of the year", upon its release. It made Shilts both a star and a pariah for his coverage of the disease and the bitter politics in the gay community. He described his motivation to undertake the writing of the book in an interview after its release, saying, [...] "Any good reporter could have done this story, but I think the reason I did it, and no one else <b>did,</b> <b>is</b> because I am gay. It was happening to people I cared about and loved." [...] The book was later adapted into an HBO film of the same name in 1993. Shilts was tested for HIV while he was writing the book; he died of complications from AIDS in 1994.|$|E
500|$|This {{objection}} {{is fundamentally}} an argument {{by lack of}} imagination, or argument from incredulity: a certain explanation is seen as being counterintuitive, and therefore an alternate, more intuitive explanation is appealed to instead. Supporters of evolution generally respond by arguing that evolution {{is not based on}} [...] "chance," [...] but on predictable chemical interactions: natural processes, rather than supernatural beings, are the [...] "designer." [...] Although the process involves some random elements, it is the non-random selection of survival-enhancing genes that drives evolution along an ordered trajectory. The fact that the results are ordered and seem [...] "designed" [...] is no more evidence for a supernatural intelligence than the appearance of complex natural phenomena (e.g. snowflakes). It is also argued that there is insufficient evidence to make statements about the plausibility or implausibility of abiogenesis, that certain structures demonstrate poor design, and that the implausibility of life evolving exactly as it <b>did</b> <b>is</b> no more evidence for an intelligence than the implausibility of a deck of cards being shuffled and dealt in a certain random order.|$|E
500|$|On 13 December 2013 Choudary led a {{march in}} Brick Lane, {{organised}} by the east London-based Sharia Project, demanding {{a ban on}} alcohol being sold by Muslim establishments.

In the event, only a few dozen protesters took part in the march. Choudary afterwards explained its purpose: “What we <b>did</b> <b>is</b> we posted a notice to the shop owners saying that under Sharia and under the Koran the sale of alcohol is prohibited and if one were to also drink alcohol, that would be 40 lashes. We were there to teach them that just because they are living among non-Muslims is no excuse because Sharia law will be implemented in Britain, and so they should be aware that just because it is not Sharia today, they can’t just do whatever they like.” Choudary said that the Shariah Project group would be arranging many more such rallies.|$|E

500|$|Inside Zimbabwe, the {{reaction}} was hostile to the players. Zimbabwe's Minister of Information, Jonathan Moyo, called Olonga an [...] "Uncle Tom" [...] who had [...] "a black skin and a white mask". Zanu PF information secretary Nathan Shamuyarira claimed they were forced into it by the British media, and [...] "No true Zimbabwean would have joined in," [...] but [...] "Olonga is not a Zimbabwean, he is a Zambian". Olonga was charged with treason, an offence punishable by death. MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai released a statement {{in support of the}} protest. He was charged with treason, although the charge was later dropped. Givemore Makoni, the President of Takashinga Cricket Club where Olonga played said [...] "It is disgraceful what Henry Olonga and Andy Flower have done. Taking politics on to the playing field is a thing the International Cricket Council and all sports organisations have been trying to avoid," [...] and that [...] "by taking politics on to the field and bringing the game into disrepute Henry appears to have breached Takashinga's code of conduct". Olonga was immediately suspended and later sacked by Takashinga Cricket Club. Stephen Mandongo, the President of the Zimbabwe Cricket Union also condemned the protest, saying [...] "What Flower and Olonga <b>did</b> <b>is</b> very wrong. They have jeopardised our reputation when given this once in a lifetime chance to host the World Cup ... It would be wrong if they wore black armbands again." [...] They referred the matter to the International Cricket Council, who deemed that they had taken a political action, but refused to charge them with a formal offence. Instead, they released a statement reiterating the apolitical nature of the organisation, and asked the players not to wear black armbands {{for the rest of the}} tournament, with the threat of more serious punishment if they continued to wear them.|$|E
2500|$|<b>DID</b> <b>is</b> also {{controversial}} {{within the}} legal system, {{where it has}} been used as a rarely successful form of the insanity defense. [...] The 1990s showed a parallel increase in the number of court cases involving the diagnosis. DID became a popular diagnosis in the 1970s, '80s, and '90s, but it is unclear whether the actual rate of the disorder increased, whether it was more recognized by health care providers, or whether sociocultural factors caused an increase in therapy-induced (iatrogenic) presentations. [...] The unusual number of diagnoses after 1980, clustered around a small number of clinicians, and the suggestibility characteristic of those with DID, support the hypothesis that <b>DID</b> <b>is</b> therapist-induced. The unusual clustering of diagnoses has also been explained as due to a lack of awareness and training among clinicians to recognize cases of DID.|$|E

2500|$|The {{psychiatric}} history frequently contains multiple previous {{diagnoses of}} various disorders and treatment failures. The most common presenting complaint of <b>DID</b> <b>is</b> depression, with headaches being a common neurological symptom. Comorbid disorders can include substance abuse, eating disorders, anxiety, {{posttraumatic stress disorder}} (PTSD), and personality disorders. [...] A significant percentage of those diagnosed with DID have histories of borderline personality disorder and bipolar disorder. Further, data supports {{a high level of}} psychotic symptoms in individuals with DID, and that both individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia and those diagnosed with DID have histories of trauma. Other disorders that {{have been found to be}} comorbid with DID are somatization disorders, major depressive disorder, as well as history of a past suicide attempt, in comparison to those without a DID diagnosis. Individuals diagnosed with DID [...] demonstrate the highest hypnotizability of any clinical population.
