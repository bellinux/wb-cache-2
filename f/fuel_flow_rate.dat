50|$|PPTs {{have much}} higher exhaust {{velocities}} than chemical propulsion engines, {{but have a}} much smaller <b>fuel</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate.</b> From the Tsiolkovsky equation stated above, {{this results in a}} proportionally higher final velocity of the propelled craft. The exhaust velocity of a PPT is of the order of tens of km/s while conventional chemical propulsion generates thermal velocities in the range of 2-4.5 km/s. Due to this lower thermal velocity, chemical propulsion units become exponentially less effective at higher vehicle velocities, necessitating the use of electric spacecraft propulsion such as PPTs. It is therefore advantageous to use an electric propulsion system such as a PPT to generate high interplanetary speeds in the range 20-70 km/s.|$|E

The operating fuel injection was at the pressures between 0. 2 and 0. 4 MPa and the temperatures {{in a range of}} 40 – 80 °C. A fuel injector test cell with electronic control for injection pulse, timing and pressure was set to 120 Hz and 60 min injection duration to drive three single-hole 0. 34 mm nozzle diameter injectors. The fuels were injected into a known volume flask at quiescence atmospheric pressure and weighed to attain the <b>fuel</b> mass <b>flow</b> <b>rates.</b> By this manner, the discharge coefficient can be calculated by the assumptions of quasi steady, incompressible and one dimensional flow through each injector. When operating at 40 °C injection temperature, ethanol delivered greater fuel amounts than gasoline resulting in higher discharge coefficients.

5000|$|Liquid gasoline, being denser than air, is {{slower than}} air {{to react to}} a force applied to it. When the {{throttle}} is rapidly opened, airflow through the carburetor increases immediately, faster than the <b>fuel</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> can increase. This transient oversupply of air causes a lean mixture, which makes the engine misfire (or [...] "stumble")—an effect opposite to that which was demanded by opening the throttle. This is remedied {{by the use of}} a small piston or diaphragm pump which, when actuated by the throttle linkage, forces a small amount of gasoline through a jet into the carburetor throat. This extra shot of fuel counteracts the transient lean condition on throttle tip-in. Most accelerator pumps are adjustable for volume or duration by some means. Eventually, the seals around the moving parts of the pump wear such that pump output is reduced; this reduction of the accelerator pump shot causes stumbling under acceleration until the seals on the pump are renewed.|$|E
5000|$|Induced drag must {{be added}} to the {{parasitic}} drag to find the total drag. Since induced drag is inversely proportional to the square of the airspeed (at a given lift) whereas parasitic drag is proportional to the square of the airspeed, the combined overall drag curve shows a minimum at some airspeed - the minimum drag speed (VMD). An aircraft flying at this speed is operating at its optimal aerodynamic efficiency. According to the above equations, the speed for minimum drag occurs at the speed where the induced drag is equal to the parasitic drag. This is the speed at which for unpowered aircraft, optimum glide angle is achieved. This is also the speed for greatest range (although VMD will decrease as the plane consumes fuel and becomes lighter).The speed for greatest range (i.e., distance travelled) is the speed at which a straight line from the origin is tangent to the <b>fuel</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> curve. The curve of range versus airspeed is normally very flat and it is customary to operate at the speed for 99% best range since this gives about 5% greater speed for only 1% less range. (Of course, flying higher where the air is thinner will raise the speed at which minimum drag occurs, and so permits a faster voyage for the same amount of fuel. If the plane is flying at the maximum permissible speed, then there is an altitude at which the air density will be what is needed to keep it aloft while flying at the angle of attack that minimizes the drag. The optimum altitude at maximum speed, and the optimum speed at maximum altitude, may change during the flight as the plane becomes lighter.) ...|$|E
50|$|As {{the motor}} burns, the {{increase}} in diameter of the fuel port results in an increased <b>fuel</b> mass <b>flow</b> <b>rate.</b> This phenomenon makes the oxidizer to fuel ratio (O/F) shift during the burn. The increased <b>fuel</b> mass <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> can be compensated for by also increasing the oxidizer mass <b>flow</b> <b>rate.</b> In addition to the O/F varying {{as a function of}} time, it also varies based on the position down the fuel grain. The closer the position is {{to the top of the}} fuel grain, the higher the O/F ratio. Since the O/F varies down the port, a point called the stoichiometric point may exist at some point down the grain.|$|R
40|$|This {{analysis}} {{addresses the}} propagation of spiral edge flames found in von Kármán swirling flows induced in rotating porous-disk burners. In this configuration, a porous disk is spun at a constant angular velocity in an otherwise quiescent oxidizing atmosphere. Gaseous methane is injected through the disk pores and burns in a flat diffusion flame adjacent to the disk. Among other flame patterns experimentally found, a stable, rotating spiral flame is observed for sufficiently large rotation velocities and small <b>fuel</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> {{as a result of}} partial extinction of the underlying diffusion flame. The tip of the spiral can undergo a steady rotation for sufficiently large rotational velocities or small <b>fuel</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates,</b> whereas a meandering tip in an epicycloidal trajectory is observed for smaller rotational velocities and larger <b>fuel</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates.</b> A formulation of this problem is presented in the equidiffusional and thermodiffusive limits within the framework of one-step chemistry with large activation energies. Edge-flame propagation regimes are obtained by scaling analyses of the conservation equations and exemplified by numerical simulations of straight two-dimensional edge flames near a cold porous wall, for which lateral heat losses to the disk and large strains induce extinction of the trailing diffusion flame but are relatively unimportant in the front region, consistent with the existence of the cooling tail found in the experiments. The propagation dynamics of a steadily rotating spiral edge is studied in the large-core limit, for which the characteristic Markstein length is much smaller than the distance from the center at which the spiral tip is anchored. An asymptotic description of the edge tangential structure is obtained, spiral edge shapes are calculated, and an expression is found that relates the spiral rotational velocity {{to the rest of the}} parameters. A quasiestatic stability analysis of the edge shows that the edge curvature at extinction in the tip region is responsible for the stable tip anchoring at the core radius. Finally, experimental results are analyzed, and theoretical predictions are tested...|$|R

The flow field is calculated using 2 D Navier–Stokes equations (momentum, species and energy equations).

40|$|In lean {{premixed}} combustors of {{gas turbine}} engines, fuel-air mixing is considered vital for controlling pollutant emissions {{as well as}} combustion instability. Enhancement in mixing may be obtained by modulating the <b>fuel</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate.</b> Modulation of fuel flow is also a useful technique to actively control combustion instabilities arising from the pressure oscillations in the combustor and thrust augmenters.

The primary objectives are to investigate the pilot flame dynamics and to provide bases {{for the study of}} the interaction mechanisms between the pilot flame and the main flame. Dynamic pressures are measured by dynamic pressure transducers. A high speed camera with CH∗ bandpass filter is used to capture the pilot flame dynamics. The proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is used to further analyze the high speed images. With the increase of the pilot <b>fuel</b> mass <b>flow</b> <b>rate,</b> the pilot flame changes from stable to unstable state gradually.
