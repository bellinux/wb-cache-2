500|$|It {{was unclear}} if Jodie Foster (Clarice Starling) and Anthony Hopkins (Hannibal Lecter) would reprise their {{respective}} roles {{for which they}} won Academy Awards in The Silence of the Lambs (best actress/actor). It {{became apparent that the}} producers and the studio could do without one of the original [...] "stars" [...] (and would go on to find a replacement). The withdrawal of both Foster and Hopkins could possibly have been terminal for the project, however. De Laurentiis confirmed this after the film's release: [...] "First and foremost, I <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> no movie without Anthony Hopkins." ...|$|E

The bridge's closure increases the distance between New Harmony and Crossville, Illinois by about ten miles.|$|E
500|$|Above the waterline, {{there was}} little {{evidence}} of the collision. The stewards in the first class dining room noticed a shudder, which they thought might {{have been caused by}} the ship shedding a propeller blade. Many of the passengers felt a bump or shudder – [...] "just as though we went over about a thousand marbles", as one survivor put it – but did not know what had happened. Those on the lowest decks, nearest the site of the collision, felt it much more directly. Engine Oiler Walter Hurst recalled being [...] "awakened by a grinding crash along the starboard side. No one was very much alarmed but <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> struck something". Fireman George Kemish heard a [...] "heavy thud and grinding tearing sound" [...] from the starboard hull.|$|E

So we boarded the sequence to the music, and it felt like such a better ending than any song we could have written on our own." [...] The writers gave it a freeze-frame shot for the ending.

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Freedom" [...] was {{directed}} by Sean De Sparengo, and filmed in London in July 2011. It took one day to film, and is primarily set in an underground club with red lighting, reminiscent of that featured in the group's 2002 single [...] "Freak like Me". De Sparengo commented on the concept and visual attributes of the video, saying: [...] "One {{of the interesting things}} for the concept for this video is that we <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to make everything look incredibly beautiful. It was about making a video where the Sugababes felt like they were {{at the top of their}} game." [...] The video made its premiere in August 2011.

500|$|As {{a senior}} in 1971, Bell led Troy High to a 10–0 record. [...] In the season opener, Bell broke off tackle and rushed 70yards for a {{touchdown}} {{the first time he}} got the ball. [...] He scored touchdowns in three of his first four carries, though one was nullified by a penalty. [...] Bell rushed for 190yards and threetouchdowns in the season opener. [...] The opposing coach said, [...] "It was the same old story. [...] We <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to stop Bell and yet we still couldn't do it. [...] That boy is a great football player." [...] Bell again won first-team All-Ohio honors, but he lost the Associated Press 1971 Ohio AAA high school back of the year award.

500|$|Ford {{continued}} to excel as a pass-rusher in 1951, when the Browns again {{advanced to the}} NFL Championship Game but lost to the Rams. He recovered four fumbles during the season and was named a first-team All-Pro by both the Associated Press (AP) and the United Press International (UPI). He was also named to the Pro Bowl, the NFL's all-star game. Ford's dominating play allowed Brown to assign him to two offensive linemen, giving Cleveland the latitude to put four men {{on the line and}} use three linebackers in what is now known as the 4–3 defense. Cleveland's defensive coach Blanton Collier later recalled the thinking behind moving Ford: [...] "We <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to get him in closer where his talents as a pass rusher could best be utilized. [...] So we moved both tackles in and dropped the linebackers off the outside. [...] It may have been the beginning of today's 4–3 defense." [...] Collier also noted that [...] "Len was very aggressive and had that touch of meanness in him that you find in most defensive players." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with MTV, Halo developer Bungie's former content manager Frank O'Connor said that {{the inclusion of the}} Arbiter as a playable character in Halo2 {{was supposed to be a}} [...] "secret on the scale of a Shyamalan plot twist" [...] and explains that Bungie was able to keep the public uninformed about this until the game's release, to the point that O'Connor never even considered including it on the weekly development updates posted at Bungie's webpage. O'Connor also stated that Bungie [...] "had some other things that were secrets within secrets" [...] and claimed that there was material related to the Arbiter that was kept secret during the development of Halo3 because [...] "There is an aspect of the Arbiter's character that is still secret to this day and will remain so for a good reason." [...] Story director Joseph Staten said that the purpose of introducing the Arbiter was [...] "to offer another, compelling point of view on a war where telling friend from foe wasn't always clear-cut. We <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> a trilogy on our hands, so we were looking past the shock of playing as the enemy [...] ".|$|E
500|$|The top six {{finishers}} in the Interzonal {{would qualify}} for the Candidates Tournament. Most observers doubted that a 15-year-old with no international experience could finish among the six qualifiers at the Interzonal, but Fischer told journalist Miro Radoicic, [...] "I can draw with the grandmasters, and there are half-a-dozen [...] in the tournament I reckon to beat." [...] Despite some {{bumps in the road}} and a problematic start, Fischer succeeded in his plan: after a strong finish, he ended up with 12/20 (+6−2=12) to tie for 5–6th. The Soviet grandmaster Yuri Averbakh observed, In the struggle at the board this youth, almost still a child, showed himself to be a full-fledged fighter, demonstrating amazing composure, precise calculation and devilish resourcefulness. I was especially struck not even by his extensive opening knowledge, but his striving everywhere to seek new paths. In Fischer's play an enormous talent was noticeable, and in addition one sensed an enormous amount of work on the study of chess. Soviet grandmaster David Bronstein said of Fischer's time in Portorož: [...] "It was interesting for me to observe Fischer, but for a long time I couldn't understand why this 15-year-old boy played chess so well". Fischer became the youngest person ever to {{qualify for the}} Candidates and the youngest ever grandmaster at 15 years, 6 months, 1 day.

500|$|Reprise Records {{president}} Howie Klein {{spent a lot}} of time in {{the studio}} with the band during recording, and recalled that, [...] "What I realized immediately is that they had seemed to mature in their musical direction. It wasn't just more of the same. [...] There was so much growth in the band." [...] The musical maturation displayed on Nimrod was partially inspired by Bikini Kill's Reject All American (1996), which encouraged Armstrong to balance [...] "rough punk rock songs" [...] and [...] "delicate pretty songs". [...] Armstrong wrote [...] "Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)" [...] in 1990 and did not show the song to his bandmates until the Dookie recording sessions in 1993. [...] During the sessions, the song was determined to be too different from the rest of the songs on Dookie, and producer Rob Cavallo was unsure of how to structure the recording, like [...] "Haushinka" [...] that was recorded for dookie, but omitted. [...] When the time came to record Nimrod, Armstrong decided to use the song, and Cavallo suggested they add strings to the track. [...] He sent the band to play foosball in another room while he recorded the strings, which took [...] "like fifteen, twenty minutes, maybe a half an hour at the most." [...] Cavallo reflected on his decision to add the strings [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> done the right thing. [...] I knew it was a hit the second I heard it." ...|$|E
500|$|Series creator Chris Carter {{felt this}} was one of his {{favorite}} episodes to write, as he found it interesting to explore how the character of Fox Mulder would react to the death of his father. Carter had recently lost a parent himself when he began work on the episode. Frank Spotnitz said of the episode [...] "The expectations were very high coming after a summer's worth of anticipation to see how Mulder got out of the boxcar. We <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to answer that question and still leave an intriguing enough dilemma {{at the end of the}} show to bring viewers back for the third and final part. I also thought it was a big gamble to do all that Indian mysticism stuff. I thought a lot of people would not necessarily respond to that. So I was nervous about that, but very excited about the Scully storyline and the way all of that played out with Mulder and Skinner." [...] Carter attended Navajo chants and rituals to ensure the accuracy of the events in this episode, after being alerted to inaccuracies in the previous episode by Navajo scholars. A sand painter was brought in to create the two sand paintings for the Blessing Way sequence, which took an entire day to create. The scenes set in New Mexico were filmed in the same Vancouver quarry that had been used as a stand-in in the previous episode, [...] "Anasazi", the repainting of which required only minor touch-ups.|$|E
500|$|Burger King's {{creative}} {{control over}} the game impacted its development defined {{as a set of}} rules. The first rule was that there was only one King character. In response, the developers had the idea of the Xbox avatars playing the game and finding the crown to become the King. This idea was rejected by Burger King who said players could not become the King. The developers' next idea was to have one person be the King and the other players lay traps to interfere with his deliveries, but this idea was again rejected by Burger King because the King could not be exposed to any danger. With the usual hazards and competition elements of the video games removed, the developers decided upon a stealth format with no human opponents. In order to better capture the accuracy and authenticity of the King's movements, the King was flown to Britain for motion capture for the game's production. Blitz Games' Edward Linley described Sneak King as the riskiest game concept of the project because it [...] "is the appearance and antics of the King himself that give the game its humor and life; without him, the game simply wouldn't work. Until we had the finished King model and motion capture in the game, we couldn't be certain the concept would gel. Fortunately, the moment he went in, we <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> created something truly unique." [...] Sneak Kings programming code consists of 60,000 active lines with another 43,000 developer comment lines. The game's instruction manual does not include a list of credits.|$|E

500|$|Before {{production}} began, {{the production}} team sought out Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, or Korean vocal talents. Tia Carrere {{was an early}} candidate to voice the title character, and Lea Salonga, {{who had been the}} singing voice of Princess Jasmine in Aladdin, was also cast as Mulan's speaking voice, but the directors did not find her attempt at a deeper speaking voice when Mulan impersonated Ping convincing, so Ming-Na Wen was brought in to speak the role. Salonga returned to provide the singing voice. Wen herself landed the role after the filmmakers listened to her narration at the beginning of The Joy Luck Club. Coats reflected on her decision, stating [...] "When we heard Ming-Na doing that voice-over, we <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> our Mulan. She has a very likable and lovely voice, and those are the qualities we were looking for." [...] For the role of Mushu, Disney was aiming for top Hollywood talent in the vein of Robin Williams's performance as the Genie, and approached Eddie Murphy, who at first balked during recording in the Disney studios, and asked to record the voice in his basement at his Bubble Hill mansion in Englewood, New Jersey. For the speaking voice of Captain Li Shang, B. D. Wong was hired, although his singing voice, for the song [...] "I'll Make a Man Out of You", was performed by Donny Osmond, who had originally auditioned as the speaking voice of the title character in Hercules. Osmond's casting originated from a suggestion from the casting director, and throughout recording, Osmond studied Wong's dialogue tapes, and aimed to match his inflections and personality. Osmond commented that his sons decided that he had finally [...] "made it" [...] in show business when he was in a Disney film. Likewise for the role of Grandmother Fa, June Foray provided for the speaking voice, and Marni Nixon supplied the singing voice.|$|E
