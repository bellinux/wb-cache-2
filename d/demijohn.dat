50|$|Amateur winemakers {{often use}} glass carboys in the {{production}} of their wine; these vessels (sometimes called <b>demijohns)</b> have a capacity of 4.5-54 L. The kind of vessel used depends on the amount of wine that is being made, the grapes being used, and the intentions of the winemaker.|$|R
50|$|The Pitkin Glass Factory was {{established}} in 1783, after the Pitkin family (Captain Richard Pitkin and his sons) worked from 1775-1781 supplying gunpowder to the Continental Army {{at a loss to}} them.

'If, sir, in {{the state}} to which the ever {{uncertain}} fortunes of war have reduced you, either I or anything which this island produces could afford assistance or relief, it would afford me a real pleasure.

The circumstance resulted in the seizure of the distillery by the government.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hope Norton's there," [...] he panted {{a little}} later, {{resisting}} Martin's effort to relieve {{him of the}} two <b>demijohns.</b> [...] "Norton's an idealist--a Harvard man. Prodigious memory. Idealism led him to philosophic anarchy, and his family threw him off.

50|$|Brookfield Glass Company {{began in}} 1864 as Bushwick Glass Works, a bottle {{manufacturing}} company. Its founder was James Madison Brookfield. In 1864, Martin Kalbfleisch, {{the owner of}} Bushwick Chemical Works built the factory to produce <b>demijohns</b> used for storing acid produced at his factory. Brookfield was appointed the owner.

50|$|Garrafeira is {{an unusual}} and rare {{intermediate}} vintage-dated style of port made from the grapes of a single harvest that combines the oxidative maturation of years in wood with further reductive maturation in large glass <b>demijohns.</b> It is required by the IVDP that wines spend some time in wood, usually between three and six years, followed by at least a further eight years in glass, before bottling. In practice the times spent in glass are much longer. The style is most {{closely associated with the}} company Niepoort, although others do exist. Their dark green <b>demijohns,</b> affectionately known as bon-bons, hold approximately 11 L each. Some connoisseurs describe Garrafeira as having a slight taste of bacon, although many people will neither notice nor understand such a description; the reason being that, during the second phase of maturation, certain oils may precipitate, causing a film to form {{across the surface of the}} glass that can be tasted by those who are accustomed to the difference between Garrafeira and other forms of port.|$|R
5000|$|McCurdy's final robbery {{took place}} on October 4, 1911 near Okesa, Oklahoma. McCurdy and two accomplices planned to rob a Katy Train after hearing that it {{contained}} $400,000 in cash that was intended as royalty payment to the Osage Nation. However, McCurdy and the men mistakenly stopped a passenger train instead. The men were able to steal only $46 from the mail clerk, two <b>demijohns</b> of whiskey, an automatic revolver, a coat and the train conductor's watch. A newspaper account of the robbery later called it [...] "one of the smallest {{in the history of}} train robbery." [...] McCurdy was disappointed by the haul and returned to Revard's ranch on October 6 where he began drinking the <b>demijohns</b> of whiskey he stole. By this time, he was also ill with tuberculosis (which he developed after working in mines), a mild case of pneumonia and trichinosis. He stayed up drinking with some of the ranch hands before going to sleep in the hayloft the following morning. Unbeknownst to McCurdy, he had been implicated in the robbery and a $2,000 reward for his capture was issued.|$|R
50|$|In 1892, {{the owner}} of a spring in Elm that had long been hailed as {{beneficial}} was found to be rich in iron. The owner opened a bath house and sold the water bottled in <b>demijohns,</b> but the bath house was destroyed in an avalanche in 1907. In 1898, a new Kurhaus was opened, which flourished until World War I. Today, it is used as a retirement centre. In 1929, the company Mineralquellen Elm AG was founded to bottle the spring water, and this continues to this day.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was {{a lively}} {{scrimmage}} {{for a few}} minutes, as we both warmed to our work, Joe thrashing away with his whip on one side, and I on the other flourishing the <b>demijohn</b> in which we had carried some cider for the supper.|$|E
6000|$|With sundry winks {{and horrible}} giggles {{peculiar}} to the dumb, the vegetable <b>demijohn</b> was now tapped; the old fellow looking round cautiously, and pointing at it; {{as much as}} to intimate that it contained something which was [...] "taboo," [...] or forbidden.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes;--he's there again," [...] said Miss <b>Demijohn</b> to her aunt. [...] "He comes {{mostly on}} Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. What {{he can be}} coming about is more than I can guess. Crocker says it's all true love. Crocker says that the Duca says--" ...|$|E
60|$|I have {{forgotten}} {{to say that}} we found the barnacled cask nearly filled with a most delicious wine which none of us can name. As soon as the gale moderated Mr. Pike had the cask brought aft and broached, and now the steward and Wada have it all in bottles and spare <b>demijohns.</b> It is beautifully aged, and Mr. Pike is certain that it is some sort of a mild and unheard-of brandy. Mr. Mellaire merely smacks his lips over it, while Captain West, Margaret, and I steadfastly maintain that it is wine.|$|R
5000|$|Arc International was {{established}} in 1825 {{in the village of}} Arques in northern France by Alexander des Lyons de Noircarm, who began production by manufacturing glass storage containers known as [...] "dame-jeanne" [...] (<b>demijohns</b> in English), which were popular at that time. In subsequent years, the company diversified into consumer cooking and dining glassware. By the 1960s, the company had mastered the process of manufacturing stemware and other finer glassware products. One of Arc's signature products is the thick-walled ten-sided [...] "working glasses" [...] that were a workhorse in French kitchens after their introduction in 1978.|$|R
50|$|In 1885, {{the area}} {{was found to have}} a mineral spring, thought to be {{beneficial}} in healing a large number of diseases. Mrs. Elmira Connelly opened her spring to others, and before long people were arriving by horse and wagon, and by train, to cart water away in five-gallon <b>demijohns.</b> The popularity of Mrs. Connelly's mineral spring led to the construction of the Connelly Mineral Springs Hotel, a 50-room hotel that was built along the railroad tracks, and near the mineral spring discovered by Mrs. Connelly. As the town grew, it became known as Connelly Springs, and was incorporated as such on May 4, 1920.|$|R
