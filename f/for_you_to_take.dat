2500|$|On October 1, 2011, Douglas County, Colorado, sheriff's deputies arrested Davis in Highlands Park, Colorado, at the Town Center in Highlands Ranch, for third-degree {{assault and}} disorderly conduct, both misdemeanors, {{stemming}} from a dispute between Davis and 50-year-old Jeff Maes about a parking space. Maes and his family got to a parking spot first and parked in it. A witness told police that Davis then confronted Maes and said, [...] "I was waiting for that spot and it wasn't right <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> it." [...] When Maes refused to move, Davis struck Maes. The blow sent Maes to the ground. Davis was released on a $1,750 bail bond. When prosecutors later learned that Maes may have suffered a broken vertebra in the incident, they increased one {{of the charges against}} Davis to second-degree assault (a felony), a crime of violence that carries a five-year mandatory minimum, and Davis's bond was raised to $10,000. Neither Maes nor a third man present at the scene have been charged in the incident. Davis later pleaded guilty to misdemeanor third-degree assault and received a two-year probationary sentence.|$|E
2500|$|Aguirre {{describes}} the SEC as an agency created {{to protect the}} public from Wall Street, but now protects Wall Street from the public, and calls it a revolving door, where people move from SEC positions to highly lucrative positions on Wall Street and also in reverse. [...] "All the agencies have to some extent or another a revolving door [...] But at the SEC, what you rotate into is an enormous salary leap. SEC managers may make $200,000. That same person may make $2 million as a starting salary on the outside and can move up from there. Now, when he leaves, I'm not sure he's worth $2 million as a lawyer, but he takes his Rolodex with him and that Rolodex is gold. The system maintains itself, because those that stay know their turn will come if they play the game. They see a director or associate director move onto a $2 million job with a Wall Street law firm. Then, the departed employee calls back to his former colleagues and says, 'you know I really don't think there is much of a case against so-and-so, I'd like <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a look at it.' And the case goes away; the system goes on in perpetuity." [...] Two of Aguirre's supervisors left the SEC for lucrative positions at private law firms. Paul Berger works at Debevoise and Plimpton. After failing to investigate the Bernie Madoff ponzi scheme, Linda Chatman Thomsen left her position as SEC Enforcement Director to become a partner at Davis Polk & Wardwell, where according to the Wall Street Journal, she would be part of its [...] "white-collar defense group". Robert Khuzami, who succeeded her, worked as a prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan's Southern District of New York, then went to Deutsche Bank for several years before returning being named SEC Enforcement Director.|$|E

6000|$|... "No, no," [...] Bill Haden said, {{and the men}} round for {{the most}} part echoed his words. [...] "'Taint fair <b>for</b> <b>thee</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> t' lad at his word. He be roight. I hadn't ought to ha' matched Flora no more. She ha' been a good bitch in her time, but she be past it, and I'll own up that thy pup ha' beaten her, and pay thee the two pounds I lay on her, if ee'll let this matter be." ...|$|R
6000|$|Presently Eric saw where Little John stood {{among the}} others, a head and {{shoulders}} above them all, and he called to him loudly, [...] "Halloa, thou long-legged fellow in scarlet! Broad are thy shoulders and thick thy head; is not thy lass fair enough <b>for</b> <b>thee</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> cudgel in hand for her sake? In truth, I believe that Nottingham men do turn to bone and sinew, for neither heart nor courage have they! Now, thou great lout, wilt thou not twirl staff for Nottingham?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, thank you," [...] she returned. [...] "I'm {{going out}} with Mary. We're going to buy some things <b>for</b> <b>you</b> boys <b>to</b> <b>take</b> along when <b>you</b> go <b>to</b> that {{boarding}} school." ...|$|R

6000|$|Milt was {{apparently}} struggling to say something. After several bobs {{of his head}} he ventured, [...] "You're so wet! I'd like <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> my raincoat." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} it to her, but to no one else. If I might advise you, I {{would say that it}} will be well <b>for</b> <b>you</b> now <b>to</b> <b>take</b> some rest. <b>You</b> are agitated, and--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was very}} wrong, Mark; very wrong indeed," [...] Millicent broke in. [...] "You {{had no right}} to run such a terrible risk; {{it would have been better}} <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> have <b>taken</b> the {{diamonds}} and thrown them into the Thames." ...|$|R
6000|$|But however disabled, {{her friend}} resumed: [...] "The only safe way <b>for</b> <b>you</b> is <b>to</b> <b>take</b> {{the ground that}} {{so long as you}} wear your husband's name you must honor it, no matter how cruel and {{indifferent}} <b>to</b> <b>you</b> he has been." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! {{but he must}} try.--Come, McGovery, there's Biddy waiting <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> her out; and here's Shamuth waiting--you don't think, man, he'd begin till you're ready." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now you {{had better}} see to the packing of your valise. It will not be {{necessary}} <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> many things, as you can equip yourself in London." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, my dear Colonel Bishop, it is <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> {{first choice}} from this dainty nosegay, and {{at your own}} price. After that we'll send the rest to auction." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, after I {{talked with}} you at noon, about teasing Caleb, <b>you</b> began <b>to</b> treat him very kindly. That gave {{me a great deal}} of pleasure. I saw that your heart was {{somewhat}} changed in regard <b>to</b> Caleb; <b>for</b> <b>you</b> seemed <b>to</b> <b>take</b> pleasure in making him happy, while before you took delight in making him miserable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm glad <b>you</b> like it, <b>for</b> I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> me <b>to</b> {{one of the}} new concerts some night. I {{really need}} some music to put me in tune. Will you, please?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, as I {{must stay}} at the Earl of Wessex to-night, for I cannot {{possibly}} catch the train, I {{think it would be}} safer <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> let me <b>take</b> care of you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Stoop {{down behind}} the breastwork," [...] Jethro shouted, [...] "until they are near enough <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> aim. Have your spears ready to check their onslaught when they charge." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{prisoner}} is undefended, Sam," [...] {{said the}} court. [...] "The square {{thing to do}} would be <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> him aside and {{do the best you can}} for him." ...|$|E

60|$|Nina. 'T is strange; here in {{this dark}} cell, tho' fettered and alone, I feel a deeper joy than when a proud and envied bride I dwelt in my deserted home. For here his foot hath trod; these walls have echoed to the voice I love; these chains so cold and heavy I more gladly wear than e'en the costly gems once clasped upon these arms, for they were his. Here his sad tears fell perchance for his captivity; but I can smile and bless the hour when I could win thy freedom, Adrian, with my poor liberty. Hark--they come. Is it to claim the vow I made to yield my bosom to the dagger meant for his? I am ready. [Enter Don Felix.] Alone, my lord; methought it were too sad a task <b>for</b> <b>thee</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> my life. Well, be it so; you claim my vow.

6000|$|... "Of course!" [...] and Leger laughed again. [...] "You can't be a {{reformer}} <b>for</b> nothing; <b>you</b> have <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the rough with the smooth--though there is, as a rule, {{very little of}} the latter." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Thank <b>you</b> <b>for</b> {{offering}} <b>to</b> <b>take</b> care of him, friend," [...] said Romola, rather penitent for her doubting glance. Then leaning to Baldassarre, she said, [...] "Pray {{wait for}} me till I come again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Quite so,' he said, 'and {{now you see}} {{the result}} of this miserable self-indulgence.

Instead of feeling thankful you complain of the brief unpleasantness that accompanies its consumption, and now, in the teeth of my instructions, you give it up. I must say the ways of patients are a constant marvel to me.' ...|$|R
