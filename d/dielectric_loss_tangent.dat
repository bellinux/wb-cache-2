40|$|At {{microwave}} frequencies, conductor losses due to {{the bottom}} electrode resistance severely limit the performance of metal-insulator-metal capacitors that employ tunable dielectric thin films.

To measure the electrical impedance of a crystal, its surfaces have first to be metallized. For very thin samples, this metallization may influence the resonances and alter the property identification.

30|$|In this work, {{the high}} ε′ and ε″ values should be {{ascribed}} to the good conductivity of CoFe@C composites. According to Cao’s electron-hopping model, the well-conductivity CoFe@C allows electrons to migrate and hop, and thus can greatly consume the electromagnetic energy, leading to enhanced <b>dielectric</b> <b>loss</b> [48 – 51]. Moreover, two peaks at f[*]=[*]~[*] 5.2 and ~[*] 11.1  GHz (Additional file  1 : Figure S 2) from the Cole-Cole plots indicate the existence of dual relaxation behaviors in CoFe@C samples. These relaxations are probably derived from the surface functions, defects, and interfacial polarizations in CoFe@C composites. In addition, the magnetic loss also contributes to the electromagnetic wave attenuation of CoFe@C composites. Eddy current effects, natural resonance, and exchange resonance are three key wave loss sources in the microwave region. As shown in Additional file  1 : Figure S 3, the μ″(μ′)− 2 f−[*] 1 for CoFe@C is not a constant value, suggesting eddy current is not the dominating magnetic loss mechanism. Instead, two peaks at ~[*] 3 and 12.5  GHz can be found and are indexed to natural resonance and exchange resonance. We also calculated the <b>dielectric</b> <b>loss</b> <b>tangents</b> (tan δE[*]=[*]ε″/ε′) and magnetic <b>loss</b> <b>tangents</b> (tan δM[*]=[*]μ″/μ′) of CoFe@C and CoFe 2 O 4, in which the maximum values of tan δE and tan δM are 0.706 and 1.370, respectively (Additional file  1 : Figure S 4).
