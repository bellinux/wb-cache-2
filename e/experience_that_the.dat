5|$|The {{operation}} did {{not give}} the Allies any tactical or strategic advantage; Howard notes that it provided experience for the planners in handling deception and for the Twenty Committee in proving the worth of double agents. Terry Crowdy, writing in 2008, argued that any <b>experience</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> LCS attained was limited {{by the lack of}} guidance from Cairo and knowledge of double agents. Dudley Clarke had already shown that the most effective method of deception involved the use of agents and faked wireless traffic, rather than major training and troop movements. Hardboiled was the first deception plan aimed at Norway. It led into several others, including Operation Tindall and Operation Solo, culminating in the 1944 Operation Fortitude North, one of the Allies' largest and most successful deceptions.|$|E

Limited studies on children who have lost a parent show that 10–15% experience depression and a few develop childhood traumatic grief (the inability to recall any positive memories of the deceased parent). Military psychiatrist Stephen Cozza speculates, based upon his <b>experience,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> long-term effects {{of having a}} parent killed during war would be more traumatic and {{difficult to deal with}} than typical causes of parental death.|$|E

In the plot Herbert's 1965 novel Dune, sandworms provide the danger and mystery of terra incognita, and the transformational <b>experience</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> protagonist Paul Atreides must go through to triumph over his enemies. Herbert believed great power and knowledge must come at some sort of price, and so Paul must risk being devoured by a sandworm and then madness after consuming sandworm extract (the Water of Life).|$|E
25|$|Undergraduates {{agree to}} adhere to an {{academic}} integrity policy called the Honor Code, established in 1893. Under the Honor Code, faculty do not proctor examinations; instead, the students proctor one another and must report any suspected violation to an Honor Committee made up of undergraduates. The Committee investigates reported violations and holds a hearing if it is warranted. An acquittal at such a hearing results {{in the destruction of}} all records of the hearing; a conviction results in the student's suspension or expulsion. The signed pledge required by the Honor Code is so integral to students' academic <b>experience</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Princeton Triangle Club performs a song about it each fall.

25|$|In the {{tactical}} arena the Germans held significant leads against the Soviets. While the Soviets {{were not as}} primitive in aircraft design quality as believed, it was in tactical deployment, combat tactics, and training, along with accumulated <b>experience</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Germans held qualitative superiority. In particular, the German Finger-four tactic was better and more flexible than the Vic formation adopted by the Soviets. Moreover, all German fighters possessed radios, so they could communicate with each other. Soviet aircraft lacked this, and pilots had to communicate with hand signals. Despite repeated warnings in the Winter War and Soviet–Japanese Border Wars, little to no investment was made in signals or air-to-air communications. During the later conflict, radios were not used and were thus removed. This was mostly because Soviet radios were too heavy and effected combat performance, while the Germans developed light radios.|$|E
25|$|Taking {{advantage}} of Roman military disarray, {{a vast number}} of barbarian peoples overran much of the empire. The Sarmato-Gothic alliance of the lower Danube carried out major invasions of the Balkans region in 252, and in the periods 253-8 and 260-8. The Peucini Bastarnae are specifically mentioned in the 267/8 invasion, when the coalition built a fleet in the estuary of the river Tyras (Dnieper). The Peucini Bastarnae would have been critical to this venture since, as coastal and delta dwellers, they would have had seafaring <b>experience</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> nomadic Sarmatians and Goths lacked. The barbarians sailed along the Black Sea coast to Tomis in Moesia Inferior, which they tried to take by assault without success. They then attacked the provincial capital Marcianopolis (Devnya, Bulg.), also in vain. Sailing on through the Bosporus, the expedition laid siege to Thessalonica in Macedonia. Driven off by Roman forces, the coalition host moved overland into Thracia, where finally it was crushed by emperor Claudius II (r. 268-70) at Naissus (269).|$|E

500|$|The {{next phase}} of the {{campaign}} involved the advance of Australian forces along the coast towards Sio, about [...] from Finschhafen. Following the capture of Gusika, {{the responsibility for the}} first part of the advance to Sio was taken over by the infantry of the 4th Brigade, under the command of Brigadier Cedric Edgar. They were brought forward from Finschhafen early in December where they had been undertaking garrison duties and on 5 December, the 22nd Infantry Battalion began the advance, crossing the Kalueng River. Lacking the <b>experience</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 2nd AIF units had, the Militia battalions advanced more cautiously than they might otherwise have done so. They were supported by American landing craft equipped with rockets, which bombarded Japanese positions along the coast, while the expansion of the airfield around Finschhafen and the establishment of a naval facility there enabled the Allies to use Consolidated PBY Catalina aircraft and PT boats to further attack Japanese resupply efforts.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{response}} to Ghosts I–IV was generally favorable, {{with an average}} rating of 69/100 based on 12reviews on Metacritic.

[...] PopMatters gave the album an 8 out of 10 and described the album as [...] "36 tracks, but no songs", {{and went on to}} call it [...] "dark, brooding haunting." [...] Pitchfork criticized the album by saying [...] "nearly every one of the untitled instrumental sketches here feels emaciated and half-finished", and gave the work a 5.0 out of 10.0.

Robert Niles of Theme Park Insider agreed that {{the highlight of the}} attraction was the penguin exhibit. Niles described the dispatch procedure as crucial to the ride: [...] "if SeaWorld can dispatch a quartet of ride vehicles every minute or so, as designed, fans will find this a fun ride". In a later article Niles highlighted some guests' criticisms of the ride, describing it as [...] "lacking an engaging story and not delivering enough on-ride views of the attraction's stars -- SeaWorld's penguins". However, he argues that SeaWorld's promotions were too photorealistic creating [...] "expectations for an <b>experience</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ride did not deliver, perhaps setting up many of those visitors for disappointment".|$|E
500|$|Miyamoto {{was also}} {{hesitant}} {{to work with}} Itoi {{at a time when}} companies were pushing major celebrity product endorsements, as Itoi's involvement would be for such a game. When the two met next, Miyamoto brought the documentation from a text adventure game and told Itoi {{that he would have to}} write similar documentation himself. Miyamoto said that he knew from his own <b>experience</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> game would only be as good as the effort Itoi invested, and that he knew Itoi could not invest the appropriate time with his full-time job. Itoi restated his interest and reduced his workload, so Miyamoto assembled a development team. Upon assessing for compatibility, they began production in Ichikawa, Chiba. Itoi had said earlier that he wanted his work environment to feel like an extracurricular club consisting of volunteers and working out of an apartment, which Miyamoto tried to accommodate. Itoi wrote the game's script and commuted from Tokyo, a process he found [...] "exhausting". Even with asking Itoi to prioritize the development process, Miyamoto received criticism of acquiescing to celebrity and of hiring a copywriter not up for the task. Miyamoto said that his decision to pursue the project was based on his confidence in Itoi.
