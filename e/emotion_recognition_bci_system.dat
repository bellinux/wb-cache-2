40|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) may {{be associated}} with impaired perception of facial <b>emotions.</b> However, <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> mediated by bodily postures has never been examined in these patients. Moreover, several studies have suggested a relation between <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> impairments and alexithymia. This is in line with the idea that the ability to recognize emotions requires the individuals to be able to understand their own emotions. Despite a deficit in <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> has been observed in MS patients, the association between impaired <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> and alexithymia has received little attention. The aim of this study was, first, to investigate MS patient’s abilities to recognize emotions mediated by both facial and bodily expressions and, second, to examine whether any observed deficits in <b>emotions</b> <b>recognition</b> could be explained by the presence of alexithymia. Thirty patients with MS and 30 healthy matched controls performed experi- mental tasks assessing <b>emotion</b> discrimination and <b>recognition</b> of facial expressions and bodily postures. Moreover, they completed questionnaires evaluating alexithymia, depression, and fatigue. First, facial <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> and, to a lesser extent, bodily <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> can be impaired in MS patients. In particular, patients with higher disability showed an impairment in <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> compared with patients with lower disability and controls. Second, their deficit in <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> was not predicted by alexithymia. Instead, the disease’s characteristics and the performance on some cognitive tasks significantly correlated with <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition.</b> Impaired facial <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> is a cognitive signature of MS that is not dependent on alexithymia...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - Previous {{research}} has demonstrated the importance of <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> ability in negotiations and leadership, but scant {{research has}} investigated the role of <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> ability in service contexts. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to propose and test a compensatory model in which service employees&# 039; <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> ability helps enhance their job performance, particularly when employees score low on the agreeableness personality dimension or have low cognitive ability. Design/methodology/approach - With a two-wave multisource dataset collected from a service center of a large retail bank, multiple regression analysis was used to test the moderating roles of agreeableness and cognitive ability on the relationship between service employees&# 039; <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> ability and their performance. Findings - Service employees&# 039; <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> ability helped enhance their job performance. However, the positive effect of <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> ability on job performance was only statistically significant when employees&# 039; agreeableness or cognitive ability was low. Practical implications - The findings have important implications for how service organizations select and recruit employees. In particular, service employees with low agreeableness or cognitive ability may still be able to perform well when possessing high <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> ability. Therefore, <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> ability should be considered in the selection and recruitment process. Originality/value - Going beyond self-report measures of <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> and using a performance measure from organizational records, this study is one of the first to examine how <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> ability interacts with personality and cognitive ability in predicting service employees&# 039; effectiveness in a service organization...|$|R

30|$|To further {{improve the}} {{performance}} of speech <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition,</b> an effective <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> model needs to be constructed. Currently, some classifiers are extensively used in speech <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition,</b> including Gaussian mixture model (GMM) [11], artificial neural network (ANN) [12], support vector machine (SVM), etc. Among them, the SVM has a unique advantage in solving nonlinear, small sample, and high dimensional pattern recognition problems, so it is widely used in speech <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> [13, 14]. In [15], Zhang et al. proposed an improved leaping algorithm to optimize the SVM classifier, and this algorithm was applied to speech <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition.</b> In [16], an integrated system of hidden Markov model (HMM) and SVM, combining advantages on capability of dynamic time warping of HMM and pattern recognition of SVM, had been proposed to implement emotion classification, which achieved an 18.3 % improvement compared to the method using HMM in the experiment of speaker independent emotion classification. Work in [17] applied the GMM-MAP/SVM generative models and discriminative models to speech <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition,</b> which increased the average <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> by 6.1 % compared to the method using SVM.

40|$|Most <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> {{systems do}} not perform {{real-time}} <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> due to latencies caused by phrase segmentation and resource-intensive feature acquisition, etc. To address this issue, we present an <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> approach that can estimate speaker emotions with much lower latency. The proposed approach does {{not rely on}} phrase-level features to recognize speaker emotion; rather, it estimates the speaker’s emotional state {{over the course of}} the utterance incrementally, using a shifting n-word window on the basis of easily computable features.

In Study 2, individual differences in chronic regulatory focus were assessed and attention allocation was measured using eye tracking during the facial <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> task. Results indicated that the positive relation between a promotion focus and facial <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> is mediated by shorter fixation duration on the face which reflects a pattern of attention allocation matched to the eager strategy in a promotion focus (i. e., striving to make hits).

Initially a set of context stimuli containing visual scenes considered to represent 5 of the basic emotions (e. g.

The study then assessed <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> in healthy young (N= 21) and older (N = 19) adults across 6 <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> tasks, assessing how <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> performance differs when emotional stimuli are presented uni-modally, cross-modally, within-modally and simultaneously cross and within modally (e. g.

Age differences were observed in the uni-modal face and uni-modal auditory <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> conditions. However these age differences were eliminated when perception was enhanced, through the incorporation of congruent cross-modal auditory and withinmodal context emotional cues when identifying facial expressions. The greatest benefit to accurate perception in both groups was found when emotional faces were accompanied by both congruent auditory and context stimuli simultaneously. This suggests that <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> difficulties in older adults may only be evident when sufficient sensory cues are not available and therefore more ecologically valid tasks that enhance the sensory experience may translate better to <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> performance that would be expected in everyday life.

40|$|Deficits {{in social}} {{adaptive}} functioning are a defining criterion of intellectual disability (ID) (American Psychiatric Association, 2013), {{and a key}} predictor of social inclusion and subsequent quality of life (Kozma, Mansell, & Beadle-Brown, 2009). Impairment in facial <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> is often cited as the component skill responsible for the social difficulties observed. This position has been formally conceptualised by the emotion specificity hypothesis (ESH; Rojahn, Rabold, & Schneider, 1995), which proposes that individuals with ID manifest a specific deficit in facial <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> beyond that which {{can be explained by}} difficulties in general intellectual functioning. Despite apparent widespread acceptance, there is not yet sufficient evidence to substantiate these claims. Moore (2001) proposes that emotion perception capacities may be intact in people with ID, and that reported deficits are instead, due to <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> tasks making extensive cognitive demands that disadvantage those with lesser cognitive abilities. The aim {{of the present study was}} to clarify the nature of facial <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> abilities in adults with mild ID. To this end, the Kinetic <b>Emotion</b> <b>Recognition</b> Assessment (KERA), a video-based measure of facial <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition,</b> was developed and a pilot study completed. The measure was designed to assess <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> abilities, while attempting to reduce information-processing demands beyond those required to perceive the emotional content of stimuli. The new instrument was assessed for its psychometric properties in individuals with ID and neurotypical control participants. Initial findings supported the interrater reliability and overarching construct validity of the measure, offering strong evidence in favour of content, convergent and predictive validity. Item difficulty and discrimination analysis confirmed that the KERA included items of an appropriate level of difficulty to capture the range of <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> capacities expected of individuals with mild ID. The secondary focus of the study was to assess how subtle methodological changes in the assessment of <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> ability may affect <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> performance, and in turn provide insight into how we might reinterpret existing ESH literature. To this end, the KERA was also applied in an investigation of the potential moderating effects of dynamic cues and emotion intensity, in addition to the assessment of the ESH. The results offer strong evidence that individuals with ID experience relative impairment in <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> abilities when compared with typically developing controls. However, it remains to be seen whether the observed difficulties are specific to emotional expression or associated with more generalised facial processing. Preliminary findings also suggest that like their typically developing peers, individuals with ID benefit from higher intensity emotional displays; while in contrast, they observe no advantage from the addition of movement cues. Finally, the overarching motivation for the reassessment and improved measurement of the ESH, was in the interests of improving real-world outcomes associated with <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> capacities. Accordingly, <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> data were also interpreted in the context of three measures of social functioning to explore the link between social competence and <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> ability.

30|$|In recent years, speech <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> {{has been}} widely applied {{in the field of}} human-computer {{interaction}} [1 – 3]. <b>Emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> helps machine understand and learn human emotions. However, the performance of the <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> is still far from the expectation of researchers. In speech <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition,</b> there are mainly two difficulties [4] that are how to find effective speech emotion features, and how to construct a suitable speech <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> model. In previous studies, some effective feature parameters were extracted for emotional recognition tasks. Zhao et al. adopted the pitch frequency, short-term energy, formant frequency, and chaotic characteristics to construct 144 dimensional emotion feature vector for recognition [5]. Cao et al. combined the feature parameters such as energy, zero crossing rate, and first-order derivative for speech <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition,</b> and encouraging results were obtained in comparison with other methods [6]. In [7], the first 120 Fourier coefficients of the speech signal were extracted, and the recognition rate of 79.51 % was obtained using Germany Berlin speech emotion database with 6 emotions. In [8], some new harmonic and Zipf-based features for better speech emotion characterization in the valence dimension were proposed for better emotional class discrimination. In [9], Prosody features and voice quality information were combined in <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition.</b> The methods mentioned above improve the performance of <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> by feature fusion. However, feature fusion may lead to high dimension and redundancy of features, so it is vital to filter out the characteristic parameters of higher distinguish ability. Fisher criterion is a classical linear decision method, which can achieve satisfying results in selecting features. Huang et al. used the Fisher discriminant coefficient to screen out 10 dimensional features from 84 dimensional features for the identification of 5 emotions [10], which increased the <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> by 8 %.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{findings}} have uncovered {{another layer of}} complexity {{with regards to the}} psychophysiology of emotion. Higher resting blood pressures {{have been shown to be}} related to increased difficulties with appraising and responding to emotionally laden stimuli. This phenomenon suggests an intimate link between cardiovascular functioning and emotion regulation, and has been termed cardiovascular emotional dampening. Much is unknown about cardiovascular emotional dampening, including its physiological underpinnings and its relationship to emotion regulation. The present study seeks to replicate previous findings from the literature, and explore the relationships between cardiovascular emotional damping, heart rate variability, and emotion regulation via general response style. Eighty-eight (52 women and 36 men) healthy undergraduate students were asked to complete a series of self-report inventories related to state affect, alexithymia, behavioral avoidance, and behavioral approach. They were then asked to complete an initial 10 minute baseline recording of heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration. Following the recording, participants completed an <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> protocol which consisted of a facial <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> task and a sentence based <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> task. After the <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> protocol was completed, participants completed a final 10 minute recording of heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration. Women performed better than men on the <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> task. Resting diastolic and systolic blood pressures were unrelated to <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> accuracy. Moreover, <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> accuracy could not be predicted from resting diastolic blood pressure, resting systolic blood pressure, self-reported positive affectivity, self-reported negative affectivity, or alexithymia regardless of sex. Likewise, heart rate variability, behavioral avoidance, and behavioral approach were unrelated to <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> accuracy. <b>Emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> accuracy could not be predicted with the inclusion of the additional three aforementioned variables. The findings of this study highlight the subtle nature of the phenomenon, and the need for more refined research methodologies. Limitations and future directions are discussed.   M. A...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of previous {{research into the}} relationship between <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> and healthy adult aging finds an age-related decline in facial <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> accuracy in individuals over 60. However, this apparent age-related decline in <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> accuracy {{is at odds with}} research in other areas. One possible explanation for this inconsistency is that experimental tasks of the {{majority of}} studies into <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> and healthy adult aging lack ecological validity and thus their findings are not applicable to real life. The current study, like only a few before, aims to explore the relationship between facial <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> and healthy adult aging with the use of more ecologically valid tasks. <b>Emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> accuracy was assessed in 21 younger (19 – 25 years) and 19 older adults (60 – 87 years) on 3 tasks of lower ecologically validity involving the recognition of a uni-modal emotional stimulus (e. g. faces only, voices only, or context only), and 3 tasks of higher ecologically validity involving facial <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> while multiple congruent stimuli were presented (e. g. faces x voices, faces x context, & faces x voices x context). The study found that older participants were worse at recognising emotion in 2 out of 3 lower ecologically valid tasks (e. g. faces and voices only). In contrast, no age differences were found in the 3 higher ecologically valid tasks and accuracy in both age groups increased. Facial <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> accuracy was highest on the faces x voices x context task with {{no significant difference between the}} faces x voices and faces x context tasks. The findings are discussed in relation to previous research into <b>emotion</b> <b>recognition</b> and healthy adult aging, other psychological areas, and the real world implications of the current findings...|$|R
