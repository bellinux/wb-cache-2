50|$|The nest, being {{suspended}} from thorny trees and overhanging water, is protected from many predators, but nest predation by crows is not unusual. Brood {{may also be}} destroyed by lizards such as Calotes versicolor or rodents such as Vandeleuria oleracea which may take over the nest. Nests may sometimes be taken over and used for nesting by munias and <b>Indian</b> <b>silverbills</b> (Euodice malabarica).|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} found in the {{duodenum}} and small intestine of both the <b>Indian</b> <b>silverbill</b> (Lonchura malabarica) and the scaly breasted munia (Lonchura punctulata).|$|E
50|$|The call is {{a high-pitched}} chitter and sharp chi-tit like <b>Indian</b> <b>silverbill,</b> and the male’s song is a musical goldfinch-like melody with twitters and trills.|$|E
50|$|The {{most ancient}} {{evolutive}} group comprises African (African silverbill), Asian (<b>Indian</b> <b>silverbill)</b> and Australian (diamond firetail); {{this suggests that}} the whole Estrildids radiation might have originated around India.|$|E

50|$|The {{similarities}} {{within this}} {{group and the}} existence of subspecies with differing vocalisations and plumage mean that some races may be elevated to species status. African and <b>Indian</b> <b>silverbill</b> are now usually considered distinct species, and the two races of black-throated munia are often also split.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] African {{silverbill}} [...] (Euodice cantans) {{is a small}} passerine bird formerly considered conspecific {{with the}} Asian species <b>Indian</b> <b>silverbill,</b> (Euodice malabarica). This estrildid finch is a common resident breeding bird in dry savanna habitat, south of the Sahara Desert. This species has also been introduced to other countries such as Portugal, Qatar and United States.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Indian</b> <b>silverbill</b> or {{white-throated munia}} (Euodice malabarica) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird found in the Indian Subcontinent and adjoining regions that was formerly considered to include the closely related African silverbill (Euodice cantans). This estrildid finch is a common resident breeding bird in the drier regions of the Middle East and the Indian Subcontinent. It has also been introduced into {{many other parts of}} the world and has become established in some areas. They forage in small flocks in grassland and scrub habitats.|$|E
50|$|The adult <b>Indian</b> <b>silverbill</b> is 11-11.5 cm {{long and}} has a conical silver-grey bill, buff-brown upperparts, white underparts, buffy flanks and dark wings. The tail is black and the wings are dark {{contrasting}} with a white rump. The sexes are similar, but immatures have buff underparts and a shorter tail. The tail appears pointed as {{the length of the}} feathers reduces from the centre outwards. It feeds mainly on seeds, but also takes insects and has been known to visit nectar bearing flowers, such as those of Erythrina trees.|$|E

50|$|In early literature, African {{silverbill}} (Euodice cantans) and <b>Indian</b> <b>silverbill</b> (E. malabarica) {{were treated}} as conspecific. In 1943, Jean Théodore Delacour firmly united both species in his revision of the Estrildinae. However, in 1964, James M. Harrison first studied the two in a strictly comparative manner and concluded that they were two separate species. He discovered that although the call notes were similar, the songs are distinctly different in form, but sharing a common pattern. They are sympatric {{in the south of}} the Arabian Peninsula and there is no record of natural hybridization. From Harrison's personal observation of birds in captivity, each of the two forms evinced a preference for its own kind. In 1985, Kakizawa and Watada confirmed Harrison's conclusion. They confirmed the genetic difference of the two species by the means of protein electrophoresis. In 1990, Sibley and Monroe accept the two as distinct species. Molecular sequence divergence studies indicate that this species along with the Indian siverbill are basal, having diverged from the common ancestors of other Lonchurae about 11 MYA. This and other evidence including differences in the arrangement of down in chicks and behaviour leads some authors to placing them in the separate genus Euodice.|$|E
