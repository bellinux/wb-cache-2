500|$|After her {{dramatic}} role in Winter's Bone, Lawrence {{looked for}} something less serious, {{and found it}} with her first high-profile releaseâ€”Matthew Vaughn's superhero film [...] (2011)â€”a prequel to the X-Men film series. She portrayed the shapeshifting mutant Mystique, a role played by Rebecca Romijn in the earlier films. Vaughn cast Lawrence, as he thought {{that she would be}} able to portray the weakness and strength involved in the character's transformation. Lawrence lost weight for the part, and for Mystique's blue form had to undergo an eight-hour makeup, as Romijn had done on the other films. She was intimidated in the role as she admired Romijn.

There are some great, pithy lines and others whose attempt at profundity ring false". Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars and wrote, [...] "Clive Owen makes a semi-believable hero, not performing too many feats that are physically unlikely.

[...] Raymund Flandez for The Wall Street Journal was equally positive regarding Chenoweth's role, praising her [...] "powerful voice", [...] "kittenish mien" [...] and [...] "commanding presence". Flandez deemed the performance of [...] "Somebody to Love" [...] the show's best number since [...] "Don't Stop Believin debuted in the pilot episode.

Yvonne Zipp of The Christian Science Monitor noted that it was [...] "the most brutal of the trilogy" [...] and that [...] "Collins doesn't take war lightlyâ€“ her characters debate the morality involved in tactics used to try to overthrow the rotting, immoral government, and they pay a high cost for those tactics." [...] Katie Roiphe of The New York Times wrote that [...] "it is the perfect teenage story with its exquisitely refined rage against the cruel and arbitrary power of the adult world."
