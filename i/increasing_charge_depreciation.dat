40|$|This paper {{examines}} the economic incentives for unregulated companies, in late nineteenth-century Britain, to disclose in their published accounts {{the fact that}} they had <b>charged</b> <b>depreciation.</b> We argue that the disclosure will be positively associated with whether a company has outside shareholders and long-term debtholders, profitability, extent of depreciable assets, appointment of a professional auditor, and size. These hypotheses are tested using 150 British companies from the years 1880 / 81, 1889 / 90 and 1899 / 01. Our results indicate that whether <b>depreciation</b> was <b>charged</b> is related to profitability and, to a lesser extent, to the presence of outside shareholders, long-term debt holders and the appointment of a professional auditor. However, the amount of <b>depreciation</b> <b>charged</b> is related only to profitability and appears to be opportunistically determined. accounting history, depreciation, dividends, profits, positive accounting theory,...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{the article}} is {{analysis}} {{of the world and}} domestic tendencies of capital taxation and justification of directions of improvement of capital taxation in Ukraine. The study was carried out with division of taxation of human and material capital. Taxation of human capital in Ukraine is moderate, compared to OECD countries, however, its main load lies on employers, unlike in OECD countries, where it is distributed proportionally between employers and employees. Taking into account a high level of shadow income of the citizens, {{it is too early to}} perform this re-distribution in Ukraine, that is why it is expedient to reduce rates of the single social contribution by employers, at the same time increasing the level of natural resources taxation, which, in Ukraine, is one of the lowest in the world. Ukraine, compared to OECD countries, is characterised with a higher level of profit taxation, which has a negative impact on increasing own capital and restoration of fixed assets. Taking into account tendencies to reduction of both standard and implicit rates of profit tax abroad, we offer to develop a mechanism of reduction of the implicit profit tax rate through improvement of the mechanism of <b>charging</b> <b>depreciation</b> and strengthening regulating effects of the profit tax on profit in the context of restoration of the fixed assets. The prospect of further studies is justification of proposals regarding changing the mechanisms of <b>charging</b> <b>depreciation</b> and profit taxation preferences...|$|R

By using dynamic optimization we show that an optimal strategy exists, and we provide an analytical expression for the optimal <b>depreciation</b> <b>charges.</b> <b>Depreciation</b> <b>charges</b> initially decrease over time, and after a number of periods the firm enters a steady state where depreciation is constant and equal to replacement investments. This way, the optimal solution trades off the benefits of accelerated depreciation (because of discounting) and of constant depreciation (because of the progressive tax system). We show that the steady state will be reached sooner when the initial tax base is lower or when the discounting effect is stronger. ...|$|R

Gradually there was a change of approach to interpretation of the concept "depreciation". Within the French school allocated concept of broad and narrow depreciation, two options of a covering of depreciation expenses were offered, research of influence of fiscal policy on depreciation was conducted. The German school connected <b>charge</b> of <b>depreciation</b> with depreciation of property and need of formation of a sinking fund. Within maneuvers of Anglo-American school considered that depreciation has to be charged at the expense of profit in the sum only approximately equal to wear. Within domestic scientific thought, two main schools adhering to various opinions were allocated. For elaboration of uniform approach during the Soviet period in accounting there were accounts "Sinking fund", "Depreciation of fixed assets" that allowed to track a special-purpose character of use of a sinking fund. That is not true for operating book of account...|$|R

40|$|AbstractContemporary {{applications}} {{are changing the}} failure mechanisms of lead acid batteries. Sulfation at the negative electrode, acid stratification, and dendrite formation now precede positive electrode failures such as grid corrosion and active material shedding. To attenuate these failures, carbon has been explored as a negative electrode additive to <b>increase</b> <b>charge</b> acceptance, eliminate sulfation, and extend cycle life. Frequently, however, carbon incorporation decreases paste density and hinders manufacturability. Discrete carbon nanotubes (dCNT), also known as Molecular Rebar®, are lead acid battery additives which can be stably incorporated into either electrode to <b>increase</b> <b>charge</b> acceptance and cycle life with no change to paste density and without impeding the manufacturing process. Here, full-scale automotive batteries containing dCNT in the negative electrode or both negative and positive electrodes are compared to control batteries. dCNT batteries show little change to Reserve Capacity, improved Cold Cranking, <b>increased</b> <b>charge</b> acceptance, and enhanced overall system efficiency. Life cycle tests show > 60 % increases when dCNT are incorporated into the negative electrode (HRPSoC/SBA) and up to 500 % when incorporated into both electrodes (SBA), with water loss per cycle reduced > 20 %.
