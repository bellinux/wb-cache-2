The trouble of all this was, that, as Mrs. Red was a notable body, and got up to begin her <b>housekeeping</b> <b>operations,</b> and woke up all her children, at four o'clock in the morning, the good people often were disturbed by a great rattling and fuss in the walls, while yet it seemed dark night.

40|$|The {{literature}} on the optimization of container terminal logistics has recently focused on space assignment and equipment management within the yard sub-system. Yet, to our knowledge, no models have been proposed for housekeeping, i. e. the process according to which a container is moved from one yard position to another during its stay in the terminal’s storage area. Housekeeping has only been addressed as a conceptual choice lying behind yard operating rules when dealing with empirical investigations for intelligent yard stacking. Here we propose a queuing-based representation of the current housekeeping process in a real container terminal and solve it by discrete-event simulation to i) assess {{the efficiency of the}} <b>housekeeping</b> <b>operations</b> under unforeseen events or process disturbances and ii) estimate the related productivity and waiting phenomena which, in turn, affect the vessel turn-around time.

The schedule is passed to the execution function which drives MSSS to perform it.

This new technology concept will minimize the cost of the hardware and software applicable to the libraries. At the same time cloud computing can simplify the different functions and activities within shorter period to time. The cloud computing is composed of three service models (Software as a Service, Platform as a Service and Infrastructure as a Service) and four deployment Models (Private Cloud, Community Cloud, Public Cloud and Hybrid Cloud).

The present study explores how these developments may affect the operations of genebanks and, consequently, how genebank agendas may change. It is argued that the new developments {{are more likely to have}} an impact on the user-oriented activities than the <b>housekeeping</b> <b>operations</b> of genebanks. To better facilitate the user community, genebanks may have to strengthen their core business, in particular, by improving quality management procedures and by providing access to a wider diversity of a crop's gene pool. In addition, genebanks may have to provide novel services, such as the introduction of specific user-oriented collection types, including research populations and genetically purified lines, and the development of novel information services, including plant genetic resources portals that should guide users to the information and materials of specific interest.

ABCD software repackages different modules of BIREME documentation technology, as a suite. It is a DBMS with capabilities to manage all database functions in an information handling scenario similar to what (Win) ISIS did on earlier computing systems. It provides for definition of database structures, indexing, searching and formatting output and covers library <b>housekeeping</b> <b>operations</b> like acquisition and circulation.

The paper also discuss major functional upgrades in ABCD 2. 0 facilitating use of numerous features of the underlying CISIS-technology, the power of ABCD as a digital library solution to retrieve specific piece of information instead of a document, and its UNICODE (UTF- 8) compliance that will enable use in non-Latin alphabet environments such as Arab, Sanskrit, Amharic, Persian etc. The severe challenges that projects like ABCD which work for the target group of small organisations in very-low-resources environments may face; both in finances and skills are also outlined...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} the DSPSE Satellite Controller (DSC) is baselined as a {{single-string}} satellite controller. The DSC performs two main functions: health and maintenance of the spacecraft; and image capture, storage, and playback. The DSC contains two processors: a radiation-hardened Mil-Std- 1750, and a commercial R 3000. The Mil-Std- 1750 processor performs all <b>housekeeping</b> <b>operations,</b> while the R 3000 is mainly used to perform the image processing functions associated with the navigation functions, as well as performing various experiments. The DSC also contains a data handling unit (DHU) used to interface to various spacecraft imaging sensors and to capture, compress, and store selected images onto the solid-state data recorder. The development of the DSC evolved from several key requirements; the DSPSE satellite was to do the following: (1) have a radiation-hardened spacecraft control system and be immune to single-event upsets (SEU's); (2) use an R 3000 -based processor to run the star tracker software that was developed by SDIO (due to schedule and cost constraints, {{there was no time}} to port the software to a radiation-hardened processor); and (3) fly a commercial processor to verify its suitability for use in a space environment. In order to enhance the DSC reliability, the system was designed with multiple processing paths. These multiple processing paths provide for greater tolerance to various component failures. The DSC was designed so that all housekeeping processing functions are performed by either the Mil-Std- 1750 processor or the R 3000 processor. The image capture and storage is performed either by the DHU or the R 3000 processor...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the ways that}} libraries have employed computers to assist with <b>housekeeping</b> <b>operations.</b> It considers the relevance of such applications to company libraries in the construction industry, and describes more specifically {{the development of an}} integrated cataloguing and loan system. A review of the main features in the development of computerised ordering, cataloguing and circulation control systems shows that fully integrated packages are beginning to be completed, and that some libraries are introducing second generation programs. Cataloguing is the most common activity to be computerised, both at national and company level. Results from a sample of libraries in the construction industry suggest that the only computerised housekeeping system is at Taylor Woodrow. Most of the firms have access to an in-house computer, and some of the libraries, particularly those in firms of consulting engineers, might benefit from computerisation, but there are differing attitudes amongst the librarians towards the computer. A detailed study of the library at Taylor Woodrow resulted in a feasibility report covering all the areas of its activities. One of the main suggestions was the possible use of a computerised loans and cataloguing system. An integrated system to cover these two areas was programmed in Fortran and implemented. This new system provides certain benefits and saves staff time, but at the cost of time on the computer. Some improvements could be made by reprogramming, but it provides a general system for small technical libraries. A general equation comparing costs for manual and computerised operations is progressively simplified to a form where the annual saving from the computerised system is expressed in terms of staff and computer costs {{and the size of the}} library. This equation gives any library an indication of the savings or extra cost which would result from using the computerised system...|$|R

40|$|Parallel Discrete Event Simulation is a {{well known}} {{technique}} for executing complex general-purpose simulations where models are described as objects the interaction of which is expressed through the generation of impulsive events. In particular, Optimistic Simulation allows full exploitation of the available computational power, avoiding the need to compute safety properties for the events to be executed. Optimistic Simulation platforms internally rely on several data structures, which are meant to support operations aimed at ensuring correctness, inter-kernel communication and/or event scheduling. These <b>housekeeping</b> and management <b>operations</b> access them according to complex patterns, commonly suﬀering from misuse of memory caching architectures. In particular, operations like log/restore access data structures on a periodic basis, producing the replacement of in-cache buﬀers related to the actual working set of the application logic, producing a non-negligible performance drop. In this work we propose generally-applicable design principles for a new memory management subsystem targeted at Optimistic Simulation platforms which can face this issue by wisely allocating memory buﬀers depending on their actual future access patterns, {{in order to enhance}} event-execution memory locality. Additionally, an application-transparent implementation within ROOT-Sim, an open-source generalpurpose optimistic simulation platform, is presented along with experimental results testing our proposal...|$|R
