"I {{wanted to}} learn about Christ– about the Old Testament, which had been his Bible, and the New Testament, which was the Bible about him; {{about the history of}} the church, which had been founded on the faith that through him God had not only {{revealed}} his innermost nature and his purpose for the world, but had released into the world a fierce power to draw people into that nature and adapt them to that purpose... No intellectual pursuit had ever aroused in me such intense curiosity, and much more than my intellect was involved, much more than my curiosity aroused. In the unfamiliar setting of a Presbyterian church, of all places, I had been moved to astonished tears which came from so deep inside me that to this day I have never fathomed them, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> more about the source of those tears and the object of that astonishment." ...|$|E

6000|$|Don't {{be alarmed}} at my pencil--I {{am not in}} bed but only bundled-up [...] on the piazza by order of the doctor.... I started for New York [...] feeling a good deal knocked up, but hoping to get better from the [...] change; I was to stay there over Sunday and see Dr. Metcalfe, who [...] has a high {{reputation}} and {{was a friend of}} my father's. I left a [...] request at his office that he would come to me on Sunday P.M.; but [...] in the meantime my cousin Mrs. Minturn Post, with whom I was [...] staying, urged upon me her physician, Dr. Taylor, who came on [...] Saturday night, just as I was going to bed, and, after sounding my [...] lungs, told me very dreadful things about them. As his verdict was [...] worse than Metcalfe's proved I will tell you what he said first. He [...] began very solemnly: [...] "My dear young lady, your right lung is [...] diseased; all your hemorrhages have come from there. It must have [...] been bad {{for at least a year}} before they began. You must go to [...] Europe as soon as possible." [...] This was not cheerful, as I had been [...] idiot enough to believe some time ago such a different explanation. [...] But of course <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> what he absolutely thought, and [...] told him I wasn't a bit afraid. If there weren't tubercles was I [...] curable and if there were was I hopeless? I asked him for the [...] very worst view he had conscientiously to take, but didn't mean [...] definitely to ask how long I should live, and so was rather [...] unprepared for his reply of [...] "Two or three years." [...] I didn't however [...] wish to make him regret his frankness, so I said, [...] "Well, Doctor, [...] even if my right lung were all gone I should make a stand with my [...] left," [...] and then, by way of showing how valiant the stand would be, [...] fainted away. This, I should say, was owing a good deal to my [...] previous used-up condition from want of sleep. It made him at any [...] rate hasten to assure me that there was every possibility of my [...] case being not after all so bad--with which he took his departure; [...] to my great relief as I didn't think him at all nice. His grammar [...] was bad, and he made himself generally objectionable.|$|E

Did I pass a speaker at some corner, hatless, perspiring, pointing Utopias {{in the air to}} restless hungry eyes, at once I saw myself, a Demosthenes swaying multitudes, a statesman holding the House of Commons spellbound, the Prime Minister of England, worshipped by the entire country. Even the Opposition papers, had I known of them, I should have imagined forced to reluctant admiration. Did the echo of a distant drum fall upon my ear, then before me rose picturesque fields of carnage, one figure ever conspicuous: Myself, well to the front, isolated. Promotion in the British army of my dream being a matter purely of merit, I returned Commander-in-Chief. Vast crowds thronged every flag-decked street. I saw white waving hands from every roof and window. I heard the dull, deep roar of welcome, as with superb seat upon my snow-white charger--or should it be coal-black? The point cost me much consideration, so anxious was I that the day should be without a flaw--I slowly paced at the head of my victorious troops, between wild waves of upturned faces: walked into a lamp-post or on to the toes of some irascible old gentleman, and awoke. A drunken sailor stormed from between swing doors and tacked tumultuously down the street: the factory chimney belching smoke became a swaying mast. The costers round about me shouted [...] "Ay, ay, sir. 'Ready, ay, ready." [...] I was Christopher Columbus, Drake, Nelson, rolled into one. Spurning the presumption of modern geographers, I discovered new continents. I defeated the French--those useful French! I died in the moment of victory. A nation mourned me and I was buried in Westminster Abbey. Also I lived and was created a Duke. Either alternative had its charm: personally I was indifferent. Boys who on November the ninth, as explained by letters from their mothers, read by Doctor Florret with a snort, were suffering from a severe toothache, told me on November the tenth of the glories of Lord Mayor's Shows. I heard their chatter fainter and fainter as from an ever-increasing distance. The bells of Bow were ringing in my ears. I saw myself a merchant prince, though still young. Nobles crowded my counting house. I lent them millions and married their daughters. I listened, unobserved in a corner, to discussion on some new book. Immediately I was a famous author. All men praised me: for of reviewers and their density I, in those days, knew nothing. Poetry, fiction, history, I wrote them all; and all men read, and wondered. Only here was a crumpled rose leaf in the pillow on which I laid my swelling head: penmanship was vexation to me, and spelling puzzled me, so that I wrote with sorrow and many blots and scratchings out. Almost I put aside the idea of becoming an author.|$|E
6000|$|... 'We left Syra {{the morning}} after our arrival on Saturday the 4th. [...] This we did (first) because {{we were in a}} hurry to do {{something}} and (second) because, coming from Alexandria, we had four days' quarantine to perform. We were all mustered along the side while the doctor counted us; the letters were popped into a little tin box and taken away to be smoked; the guardians put on board to see that we held no communication with the shore - without them we should still have had four more days' quarantine; and with twelve Greek sailors besides, we started merrily enough picking up the Canea cable. [...] . To our utter dismay, the yarn covering began to come up quite decayed, and the cable, which when laid should have borne half a ton, was now in danger of snapping with a tenth part of that strain. We went as slow as possible in fear of a break at every instant. My watch was from eight to twelve in the morning, and during that time we had barely secured three miles of cable. [...] Once it broke inside the ship, but I seized hold of it in time - the weight being hardly anything - and the line for the nonce was saved. Regular nooses were then planted inboard with men to draw them taut, should the cable break inboard. A-, who should have relieved me, was unwell, so I had to continue my look-out; and about one o'clock the line again parted, but was again caught in the last noose, with about four inches to spare. Five minutes afterwards it again parted and was yet once more caught. Mr. Liddell (whom I had called) could stand this no longer; so we buoyed the line and ran into a bay in Siphano, waiting for calm weather, though I was by no means of opinion that the slight sea and wind had been the cause of our failures. - All next day (Monday) we lay off Siphano, amusing ourselves on shore with fowling pieces and navy revolvers. I need not say we killed nothing; and luckily we did not wound any of ourselves. A guardiano accompanied us, his functions being limited to preventing actual contact with the natives, for they might come as near and talk as much as they pleased. These isles of Greece are sad, interesting places. They are not really barren all over, but they are quite destitute of verdure; and tufts of thyme, wild mastic or mint, though they sound well, are not nearly so pretty as grass. [...] Many little churches, glittering white, dot the islands; most of them, I believe, abandoned during the whole year {{with the exception of one}} day sacred to their patron saint. The villages are mean, but the inhabitants do not look wretched and the men are good sailors. There is something in this Greek race yet; they will become a powerful Levantine nation in the course of time. - What a lovely moonlight evening that was! the barren island cutting the clear sky with fantastic outline, marble cliffs on either hand fairly gleaming over the calm sea. Next day, the wind still continuing, I proposed a boating excursion and decoyed A-, L-, and S- into accompanying me. We took the little gig, and sailed away merrily enough round a point to a beautiful white bay, flanked with two glistening little churches, fronted by beautiful distant islands; when suddenly, to my horror, I discovered the ELBA steaming full speed out from the island. Of course we steered after her; but the wind that instant ceased, and we were left in a dead calm. There was nothing for it but to unship the mast, get out the oars and pull. The ship was nearly certain to stop at the buoy; and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> how to take an oar, so here was a chance with a vengeance! L- steered, and we three pulled - a broiling pull it was about half way across to Palikandro - still we did come in, pulling an uncommon good stroke, and I had learned to hang on my oar. L- had pressed me to let him take my place; but though I was very tired at the end of the first quarter of an hour, and then every successive half hour, I would not give in. I nearly paid dear for my obstinacy, however; for in the evening I had alternate fits of shivering and burning.' ...|$|E
