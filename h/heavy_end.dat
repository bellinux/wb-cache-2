Mary divorced Les Paul and later married her old school friend from Monrovia, California, namely Don Hatfield, who owned a large construction company in California. He is still with us, and I see him occasionally. Doing great, but he misses Mary.|$|E
500|$|Peart's {{drumming}} {{skill and}} technique are well-regarded by fans, fellow musicians, and music journalists. His influences are eclectic, ranging from Pete Thomas, John Bonham, Michael Giles, Ginger Baker, Phil Collins, Steve Gadd, Stewart Copeland, Michael Shrieve and Keith Moon, to fusion and jazz drummers Billy Cobham, Buddy Rich, Bill Bruford and Gene Krupa. The Who {{was the first}} group that inspired him to write songs and play the drums. Peart is distinguished for playing [...] "butt-end out", reversing stick orientation for greater impact and increased rimshot capacity. [...] "When I was starting out", Peart said, [...] "if I broke the tips off my sticks I couldn't afford to buy new ones, so I would just turn them around and use the other end. I got used to it, and continue to use the <b>heavy</b> <b>end</b> of lighter sticks – {{it gives me a}} solid impact, but with less 'dead weight' to sling around." ...|$|E

5000|$|Sōzu {{is a type}} {{of water}} {{fountain}} used in Japanese gardens. It consists of a segmented tube, usually of bamboo, pivoted to one side of its balance point. At rest, its <b>heavier</b> <b>end</b> is down and resting against a rock. A trickle of water into {{the upper end of the}} tube accumulates and eventually moves the tube's centre of gravity past the pivot, causing the tube to rotate and dump out the water. The <b>heavier</b> <b>end</b> then falls back against the rock, making a sharp sound, and the cycle repeats. This noise is intended to startle any herbivores such as deer or boars which may be grazing on the plants in the garden.|$|R

There was also a gas flare to burn the by product propane. This material was an imputirtiy in the propylene. Normally it was condensed, stored in high pressure tanks and sold.

60|$|In {{the clear}} water Joe {{could see the}} cunning trap which had caused the death of Bill, and insured the captivity of himself and his brother. The crafty savages had trimmed a six-inch sapling and {{anchored}} it under the water. They weighted the <b>heavy</b> <b>end,</b> leaving the other pointing upstream. To this last had been tied the grapevine. When the drifting raft reached the sapling, the Indians concealed in the willows pulled hard on the improvised rope; {{the end of the}} sapling stuck up like a hook, and the aft was caught and held. The killing of the helmsman showed the Indians' foresight; even had the raft drifted on downstream the brothers would have been helpless on a craft they could not manage. After all, Joe thought, he had not been so far wrong when he half fancied that an Indian lay behind Shawnee Rock, and he marveled at this clever trick which had so easily effected their capture.|$|E

He has to learn to trust absolutely to his rider; till he does, the risk is always great in thick bush, where a fellow must try different passages, and put back and forward, and pick his way by hair's-breadths.|$|E
