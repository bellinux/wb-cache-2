As a result of official pressure, many Romanian noblemen converted to Catholicism. For example, {{the members of the}} powerful Drágffy family turned Catholic in the 15thcentury. The Ottomans raided Transylvania {{for the first time in}} 1394. Sigismund I of Hungary (13871437) organized a crusade against them, but the battle of Nicopolis (now Nikopol, Bulgaria) ended in disaster for the Christian forces in 1396.|$|E
25|$|Simeon I {{was content}} with results and {{considered}} {{that he had}} superiority over the Byzantine Empire. Despite the success, he {{realized that there was}} still a lot to do before prevailing over the Empire for good. He needed his own political and ideological base, and he consequently launched an ambitious construction program in Preslav so that it could rival Constantinople. In the meanwhile, Simeon <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>also</b> imposed his authority over Serbia in return for recognizing Petar Gojniković as its ruler. That was an important move towards reducing Byzantine influence over the Western Balkans.|$|E
500|$|Thutmose I was {{originally}} buried and then reburied in KV20 {{in a double}} burial with his daughter Hatshepsut rather than KV38 which {{could only have been}} built for Thutmose I during the reign of his grandson Thutmose III based on [...] "a recent re-examination of the architecture and contents of KV38." [...] The location of KV20, if not its original owner, had long been known since the Napoleonic expedition of 1799 and, in 1844, the Prussian scholar Karl Richard Lepsius had partially explored its upper passage. However, all its passageways [...] "had become blocked by a solidified mass of rubble, small stones and rubbish which had been carried into the tomb by floodwaters" [...] and {{it was not until the}} 1903-1904 excavation season that Howard Carter, after 2 previous seasons of strenuous work, was able to clear its corridors and enter its double burial chamber. Here, among the debris of broken pottery and shattered stone vessels from the burial chamber and lower passages were the remnants of two vases made for Queen Ahmose Nefertari which formed part of the original funerary equipment of Thutmose I; one of the vases contained a secondary inscription which states that Thutmose II [...] " [...] as his monument to his father." [...] Other vessels which bore the names and titles of Thutmose <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>also</b> been inscribed by his son and successor, Thutmose II, as well as fragments of stone vessels made for Hatshepsut before she herself became king as well as other vessels which bore her royal name of 'Maatkare' which would have been made only after she took the throne in her own right.|$|E
40|$|As a {{topic of}} my {{rigorous}} essay, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> chosen an issue of arbitration procedure in a domestic and international commercial intercourse. As I was working on my rigorous essay, at first, I wrote a short general information on international and domestic arbitration procedure, kinds of arbitration procedures, focused on institutional arbitration procedure and mentioned the most important arbitration courts as well. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>also</b> assessed positive and negative aspects of arbitration procedure and named centres where international and domestic arbitrations are proceeded. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>also</b> dealt an issue of submission (in the chapter 5, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> focused on a problem of making a valid submission, as there were some institutions {{in the past that}} were abusing arbitrary rights of clients they accused and violated arbitration law). <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>also</b> focused on arbitrability in general, how this is processed and the way some specific cases concerning e. g. labour law, Land registry inscription and exchange cases are solved using this method. Next, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>also</b> analyzed the way other courts` decisions are accepted and executed and finally, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>also</b> mentioned the newest arbitration method online arbitration. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> divided my rigorous essay into ten parts (including introduction, conclusion and list of literature I used for my essay) [...] . ...|$|R

500|$|The musical {{covers and}} {{performances}} for the episode were mostly well received by critics and fans alike. Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly stated that her favorite was [...] "Silly Love Songs" [...] by Paul McCartney, {{performed by the}} Warblers. In {{a review of the}} performance, she wrote, [...] "This is much more Warbler-esque than 'When I Get You Alone'. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>also</b> been worried we wouldn't get our weekly dose of dorky Warbler dance moves. Plus, major points for the blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment when Blaine sang the love 'won't come at all' line to Santana. It was probably my personal biggest laugh-out-loud moment of the episode." [...] She gave the performance an [...] "A". She also praised Puck's performance of [...] "Fat Bottomed Girls", and opined, [...] "In general, I'm in love with Mark Salling's voice. He's right up there with Artie [...] in my book. And this song was smothered in awesome sauce. Bonus points for Puck's sort-of-feminine head bob, Brittany's background groovin', the club's reactions to him singing to Lauren, and Mr. Schu's mild eye-roll." [...] She went on to give the performance an [...] "A−". Kristin Coachman of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer was a bit more critical of Puck's cover of the song: [...] "This week Mark Salling [...] is singing Queen's 'Fat Bottomed Girls'. I know this song fits in with Puck's storyline for the episode, but I feel like the song was in the wrong key for him. At times it sounded like he was straining to hit the higher notes. Because of this, I have to wonder if the backing vocals are purposely drowning his voice out. It seems depending on the song selection for him, Salling's vocal performances continue to be very hit or miss this season." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{could have}} done lots more, put in much more work and {{developed}} more pictures, but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>also</b> a desire to say what I felt about life. Simple things like a little picture in the window or {{the corner of the}} studio or an old stove in the kitchen have always been fascinating to me. They are very much alive, these flowers and grasses with the dew on them. Stieglitz always said, [...] "What have you got to say?" [...] I think in a few small cases I've said a few things, expressed how I felt, trying to show the horror of poverty or the beauty of black people. I think that in photography what you've done is what you've had to say. In everything this has been the message of my life. A simple supper, being with someone you love, seeing a deer come around to eat or drink at the barn - I like things like that. If I could make one true, quiet photograph, I would much prefer it to having a lot of answers.|$|E
