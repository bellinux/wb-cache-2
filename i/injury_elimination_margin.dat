40|$|Background: Although disability-free life {{expectancy}} {{has been investigated}} in Japan, gains from elimination of diseases and injuries have not been examined. Methods: We used data from the 2007 Japanese national health statistics to calculate {{the number of years}} with and without activity limitation that could be expected from eliminating 6 selected diseases and injuries. Results: At birth, the number of expected years of life without and with activity limitation was 70. 8 and 8. 4, respectively, in males and 74. 2 and 11. 8 in females. More than 1. 0 expected years without activity limitation were gained from eliminating malignant neoplasms and cerebrovascular diseases; smaller gains were observed after eliminating other diseases and <b>injuries.</b> <b>Elimination</b> of cerebrovascular diseases, dementia, and fracture decreased expected years with activities of daily living (ADL) limitation, and elimination of shoulder lesions/low back pain decreased expected years with non-ADL limitation. Conclusions: Elimination of diseases and injuries increased expected years with and without activity limitation among Japanese, which suggests that improved prevention of those diseases and injuries—including cerebrovascular diseases and dementia—would result in longer disability-free {{life expectancy}} and fewer years of severe disability...|$|R

40|$|Repair after acute lung <b>injury</b> {{requires}} <b>elimination</b> of {{granulation tissue}} from the alveolar airspace. We hypothesized that during lung repair, signals capable of inducing {{the death of}} the two principal cellular elements of granulation tissue, fibroblasts and endothelial cells, would be present at the air-lung interface. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from patients during lung repair induced both fibroblast and endothelial cell death, while fluid obtained at the time of injury or from patient controls did not. The mode of cell death for endothelial cells was apoptosis. Fibroblast death, while morphologically distinct from necrosis, also differed from typical apoptosis. Only proliferating cells were susceptible to the bioactivities in lavage fluid, which were trypsin sensitive and lipid insoluble. Histological examination of lung tissue from patients after lung injury revealed evidence of apoptotic cells within airspace granulation tissue. Our results suggest that cell death induced by peptide(s) present at the air-lung interface may participate in the remodeling process that accompanies tissue repair after injury...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the initial {{effects of the}} introduction of Universal Primary Education (UPE) in January 1997 on {{the quantity and quality}} of education obtained by children in Uganda. Using regression discontinuity and difference-in-difference estimation techniques, the effects of school fee <b>elimination</b> on these <b>margins</b> are identified. The differential effects of the introduction of UPE across socioeconomic groups are examined. The results suggest that UPE increases the probability of a child entering school before age 8 by about 9 %. However, the introduction of UPE caused a 10 % fall in the probability that a publicly-schooled child of a given age and socioeconomic characteristics was able to complete a simple reading test contained in the 2001 Demographic and Health Survey Education Supplement. The elimination of school fees is found to have reduced dropout rates for boys but not for girls...|$|R
40|$|The {{carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) laser has been {{utilized}} for preliminary intraoperative cardiovascular applicatioris, including coronary endarterectomy and ventricular eitdocardiectomy. CO 2 lasers used for these applications have been operated in the continuous wave, chopped or pulsed mode at low peak powers. To evaluate {{the extent of}} boundary tissue injury, continuous, chopped and pulsed energy delivery of CO 2 laser emission was used to bore through 192 5 mm thick myocardial slices in air. Continuous, chopped and pulsed delivery at a peak power of 500 W or less failed to eliminate light microscopic or ultrastructural signs of thermal injury. Only when a high energy CO 2 laser (pulse energy 80 to 300 mJ, pulse duration 1 μs) was used at a peak power greater than 80 kW were all signs of thermal injury eliminated; furthermore, high peak power prevented thermal injury only when the beam was focused to achieve a peak power density greater than 60 kW/mm 2 Under these conditions, pathologic findings were identical to those observed using excimer wavelengths. The results of these experiments indicate that: 1) conventional CO 2 lasers fail to minimize boundary tissue <b>injury,</b> 2) <b>elimination</b> of thermal <b>injury</b> during intraoperative laser ablation requires that CO 2 laser energy be focused to achieve a peak power density greater than 60 kW/mm 2, and 3) <b>elimination</b> of thermal <b>injury</b> can be achieved {{at a variety of}} wavelengths, provided that an appropriate energy profile is employed...|$|R
40|$|No cure is {{available}} for human spinal cord <b>injury.</b> Cell <b>elimination</b> by localized radiation therapy that is timed within 2 - 3 weeks postinjury can facilitate repair of structure and function in transected rat spinal cord. In pilot studies in contusion spinal cord injury, a model similar to crush/fracture injury in human, {{we did not observe}} the expected beneficial effects of radiation therapy. Long forgotten data show that in contusion/crush injury, fluid accumulation from hemorrhage is critical. Alfred Reginald Allen observed that the most devastating sequelae in contusive injury are secondary to fluid accumulation which could be alleviated by surgical intervention, midline slits (myelotomy) at the lesion site. Here, we tested whether release of fluid buildup by microsurgery (partial myelotomy) would affect the structural outcome of radiation therapy in the severely contused rat spinal cord. Surgical intervention alone significantly enhanced tissue and functional preservation in the contused cord, thus confirming Allen's observations. Combining partial myelotomy with radiation therapy that is specifically timed postinjury elicited substantial beneficial therapeutic outcome; it led to significant increase in tissue repair/preservation compared with the group that received surgical intervention only, as determined by histology and in vivo MRI. Altogether, the combined treatments led to a 1. 8 fold increase in tissue repair/preservation as compared with the contused group. The data suggest that a clinical protocol could be developed to treat acute human spinal cord injury through conventional clinical procedures, a combination of microsurgical manipulation and radiation therapy. These also suggest it is imperative to first prevent the secondary damage caused by fluid accumulation for a cure to be possible...|$|R
40|$|The pharmacologic {{interventions}} {{for treatment of}} acute repetitive seizures and those for treatment of status epilepticus are similar. The choice of treatment {{should be based on}} the drug’s onset of action, spectrum of anticonvulsant activity, route and ease of administration, <b>elimination</b> half-life, therapeutic <b>margin</b> of safety, and redistribution from the central nervous system. Treatment should be initiated early in patients who are prone to seizure clusters or prolonged partial seizures that may generalize or progress to status epilepticus. Benzodiazepines have become first-line drugs for treatment of acute seizures and status epilepticus, followed by phenytoin/fosphenytoin and phenobarbital. Short-acting benzodi-azepines, including diazepam, lorazepam, clonazepam, and midazolam, can decrease the frequency of emergency department visits if given at the appropriate times. The recently approved intravenous formulation of valproate may be of use in chil-dren receiving oral valproate who develop breakthrough seizures caused by subtherapeutic plasma levels that are secondary to missed doses or an inability to tolerate oral valproate. (J Child Neurol 1998; 13 (Suppl 1) :S 23 -S 26). Seizures and status epilepticus are among the most common neurologic emergencies in children and adolescents.

40|$|In this paper, a {{metastability}} immune warning flip-flop (FF) is proposed, {{which consists}} of an edge detector, a warning window generator, and a warning detector along with a traditional FF. The delayed data are monitored during the warning window to flag a warning signal before the data enter the erroneous zone. In this scheme, the warning window is independent of input clock frequency and hence is suitable for frequency scaling application. A 16 -bit Kogge-stone adder is implemented in 65 -nm technology, which uses warning FF for dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS). The warning FF-based DVFS allows <b>elimination</b> of safety <b>margins</b> and operates till the point of first warning of the adder without any erroneous results. The experiments were conducted with different supply voltages, phase-shifted clocks, and process conditions. The circuit is helpful to determine when to stop further reduction in supply voltage by producing the warning signal with predefined timing slacks in DVFS application. The test chip results demonstrate that the proposed circuit can track the critical path delay of 2. 4 - 7. 5 ns at warning voltage of 1. 15 - 0. 72 V, respectively. The measured results from 10 different chips show {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed concept across process variation...|$|R
40|$|Following axotomy, {{the contact}} between motoneurons and muscle fibers is disrupted, {{triggering}} a retrograde reaction at the neuron cell body within the spinal cord. Together with chromatolysis, {{a hallmark of}} such response to <b>injury</b> is the <b>elimination</b> of presynaptic terminals apposing to the soma and proximal dendrites of the injured neuron. Excitatory inputs are preferentially eliminated, leaving the cells under an inhibitory influence during the repair process. This is particularly important to avoid glutamate excitotoxicity. Such shift from transmission to a regeneration state is also reflected by deep metabolic changes, seen by the regulation of several genes related to cell survival and axonal growth. It is unclear, however, how exactly synaptic stripping occurs, but there is substantial evidence that glial cells {{play an active role}} in this process. In one hand, immune molecules, such as the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I, members of the complement family and Toll-like receptors are actively involved in the elimination/reapposition of presynaptic boutons. On the other hand, plastic changes that involve sprouting might be negatively regulated by extracellular matrix proteins such as Nogo-A, MAG and scar-related chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans. Also, neurotrophins, stem cells, physical exercise and several drugs seem to improve synaptic stability, leading to functional recovery after lesion.

40|$|CLAMP (Climate Leaf Analysis Multivariate Program) is a {{powerful}} paleoclimate proxy {{with the ability to}} yield quantitative data on past temperatures, precipitation, growing season length, and humidity, as well as enthalpy (a property of a parcel of air that is useful in studies of paleoaltimetry). Commonly quoted uncertainties in CLAMP predictions relate to the statistical uncertainty inherent in the combined quality of the modern calibration data sets and the relationship of foliar architecture to the various climate parameters. This minimum uncertainty assumes that the fossil assemblage represents faithfully the foliar physiognomy of the source vegetation. Taphonomic processes degrade this physiognomic fidelity. Differential selection for size, shape, and species composition during transport and post-depositional processes biases the physiognomic profile of the fossil assemblage. The sensitivity of CLAMP precision to taphonomic filtering was assessed empirically using a modern data set from the Crimean Peninsula as a proxy fossil site. <b>Elimination</b> of leaf <b>margin,</b> apex, base, size, and shape character-state categories, singly and in combination, changed the predictive capability of CLAMP. Loss of margin characters had the greatest effect, particularly on temperature-related variables (mean annual, warm-month mean and cold-month mean temperatures, length of the growing season, and enthalpy). Taphonomic selection against large leaf sizes had little effect even on moisture-related estimates (precipitation during the growing season, mean monthly growing season precipitation, precipitation during the three wettest and driest months, relative humidity). Loss of taphonomically sensitive characters (apex, base, or shape) also had little effect on CLAMP predictions. Copyright © 2005, SEPM (Society for Sedimentary Geology) ...|$|R
40|$|This study investigates whether ozone could confer {{protection}} from hepatic ischemia reperfusion by modifying {{the accumulation of}} adenosine and xanthine during ischemia. A significant increase in both adenosine and xanthine accumulation was observed {{as a consequence of}} ATP degradation during hepatic ischemia. Adenosine exerts a protective effect on hepatic ischemia reperfusion <b>injury</b> since the <b>elimination</b> of endogenous adenosine accumulation with adenosine deaminase increased the hepatic injury associated with this process. On the other hand, the high xanthine levels observed after ischemia could exert deleterious effects during reperfusion due to reactive oxygen species generation from xanthine oxidase. The administration of allopurinol, an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase, attenuated the increase in reactive oxygen species and transaminase levels observed after hepatic reperfusion. Ozone treatment in liver maintained adenosine levels similar to those found after ischemia but led to a marked reduction in xanthine accumulation. In order to evaluate the role of both adenosine and xanthine, we tried to modify the protection conferred by ozone, by modifying the concentrations of adenosine and xanthine. The metabolization of endogenous adenosine after ischemia abolished the protective effect conferred by ozone. When xanthine was administered previous to ozone treatment, the protection conferred by adenosine disappeared, showing both postischemic reactive oxygen species and transaminase levels similar to those found after hepatic ischemia reperfusion. Ozone would confer protection against the hepatic ischemia reperfusion injury by the accumulation of adenosine that in turns benefits the liver and by blocking the xanthine/xanthine oxidase pathway for reactive oxygen species generation.

40|$|The {{hepatitis}} C virus (HCV) is {{the major}} cause of liver disease and {{it is estimated that}} around 170 millions of people are infected worldwide. The available therapy is a combination of pegylated-interferon-alpha, ribavirin and since 2011, also NS 3 / 4 A protease inhibitors boceprevir and telaprevir. The standard treatment is associated with considerable side effects and does not cure all patients. Several vaccine candidates, prophylactic and therapeutic, are in the developing phase, but none of them so far have proven to be able to prevent or clear the HCV infection. Thus there is a vital need for an alternative approach for chronically infected HCV patients who do not respond to the standard treatment. Chronic HCV infection leads to severe liver inflammation and subsequent cirrhosis and hepatocarcinoma. T cell failure has been indicated as the main reason of viral persistence. On the contrary, an efficient T cell response has been suggested to hold the key to HCV resolution. In particular, antiviral T cells that are polyfunctional are associated with effective control of HCV replication. The present thesis investigated two different approaches to generate HCV-specific polyfunctional T cells and their potential to reduce HCV RNA+ hepatoma cells and to reduce HCV antigen+ tumor growth was assessed subsequently. Here the two approaches are based on the idea on T cell receptor (TCR) transfer that enables introduction of HCV-antigen specificity from one T cell to another, and DNA vaccination that is enhanced by electroporation. Paper I and II demonstrated that HCV NS 3 (NS 31073 - 1081) and NS 5 A (NS 5 A 1992 - 2000) -specific TCR isolated from HLA-A 2 transgenic mice can be transferred to human T cells. Such HCV-specific redirected human T cells demonstrate a different mechanism of action associated with their antigen specificity. NS 3 -specific TCRs were polyfunctional with potent lytic activity capable to eliminate human hepatoma HCV replicon cells replicating HCV subgenomic RNA, whilst the NS 5 Aspecific TCRs instead ware mainly IFN-γ producers and less cytolytic. This has an interesting implication as the latter may spare the host from unwanted cell <b>injury</b> during <b>elimination</b> of HCV-infected cells. Paper III explored the potential of the NS 5 A DNA vaccine used in paper II. This pre-clinical study showed that one single injection of the vaccine followed by electroporation could give rise to a polyfunctional T cell response in both wild-type and NS 5 A-transgenic mice, thought the latter group showed signs of tolerance. A series of truncated NS 5 A vaccine constructs revealed the locations of the protective antigen that gives the protective immunity. In this study, new murine MHC-I restricted CTL epitope were also identified, which enables immunological studies in HCV transgenic mouse models. These findings provide evidence that high-magnitude and high-quality T cell response able to assist the immune control of HCV can be engineered in vitro and by therapeutic vaccination. It has implications for development of HCV treatments for patients who cannot be cured by antiviral therapy. The TCRreagents may also serve as tools to gain better understanding of HCV immunology...|$|R
