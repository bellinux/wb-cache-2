5|$|The {{early years}} of the twentieth century saw tone {{clusters}} elevated to central roles in pioneering works by ragtime artists <b>Jelly</b> <b>Roll</b> Morton and Scott Joplin. In the 1910s, two classical avant-gardists, composer-pianists Leo Ornstein and Henry Cowell, were recognized as making the first extensive explorations of the tone cluster. During the same period, Charles Ives employed them in several compositions that were not publicly performed until the late 1920s or 1930s. Composers such as Béla Bartók and, later, Lou Harrison and Karlheinz Stockhausen became proponents of the tone cluster, which feature in the work of many 20th- and 21st-century classical composers. Tone clusters play a significant role, as well, in the work of free jazz musicians such as Cecil Taylor and Matthew Shipp.|$|E

50|$|Specific dangers {{associated}} with lithium-ion battery recycling processes are: electrical dangers, chemical dangers, burning reactions, {{and their potential}} interactions.

40|$|In many {{commercial}} cells, long tabs at both cell sides, {{leading to}} uniform potentials along the spiral direction of wound <b>jelly</b> <b>rolls,</b> are rarely seen {{because of their}} high manufacturing cost. More often, several metal strips are welded at discrete locations along both current collector foils. With this design, the difference of electrical potentials is easily built up along current collectors in the spiral direction. Hence, the design features of the tabs, such as number, location and size, can be crucial factors for spiral-shaped battery cells. This paper presents a Li-ion battery cell model having a 3 -dimensional spiral mesh involving a wound jellyroll structure. Further results and analysis will be given regarding impacts of tab location, number, and size...|$|R
40|$|During evolution, the {{effective}} interactions between re. yidues in a protein {{can be adjusted}} through mutations to allow the protein to fold to its native structure on an adequate time scale. We seek to address the question: Are there some structures that can be better optimized than others? Using exhaustive enumeration of the compact conformations of short proteins confined to simple lattices, wefind that the best structures are those that contain contacts rare in random structures, indicating the importance of nonlocal contacts for assisting the folding process. Certain structural motifs such as long p-hairpins, Greek-key motifs, and <b>jelly</b> <b>rolls,</b> commonly found in proteins of known structure, have {{a high degree of}} optimizability. Contrary to what might be expected, positive correlations between the various interactions reduce optimizability. The optimization procedure produces a correlated energy landscape, which might assist folding. 0 1995 John Wiley d Sons, Inc...|$|R
40|$|We report {{here the}} crystal {{structure}} of the minimal ligand-binding segment of the Staphylococcus aureus MSCRAMM, clumping factor A. This fibrinogen-binding segment contains two similarly folded domains. The fold observed is a new variant of the immunoglobulin motif that we have called DE-variant or the DEv-IgG fold. This subgroup includes the ligand-binding domain of the collagen-binding S. aureus MSCRAMM CNA, and many other structures previously classified as <b>jelly</b> <b>rolls.</b> Structure predictions suggest that the four fibrinogen-binding S. aureus MSCRAMMs identified so far would also contain the same DEv-IgG fold. A systematic docking search using the C-terminal region of the fibrinogen γ-chain as a probe suggested that a hydrophobic pocket formed between the two DEv-IgG domains of the clumping factor as the ligand-binding site. Mutagenic substitution of residues Tyr 256, Pro 336, Tyr 338 and Lys 389 in the clumping factor, which are proposed to contact the terminal residues 408 AGDV 411 of the γ-chain, resulted in proteins with no or markedly reduced affinity for fibrinogen...|$|R

5000|$|The name [...] "jelly roll" [...] {{was first}} used for the {{structure}} composed of an elaboration on the Greek key motif by Jane S. Richardson in 1981 and was intended to reflect the structure's resemblance to a <b>jelly</b> or Swiss <b>roll</b> cake. The structure {{has been given a}} variety of descriptive names, including a wedge, beta barrel, and beta roll. The edges of the two sheets do not meet to form regular hydrogen bonding patterns, and so it is often not considered to be a true beta barrel. Cellular proteins containing jelly roll-like structures may be described as a cupin fold, a JmjC fold, or a double-stranded beta helix.|$|R

The leader of New Orleans' Camelia Brass Band, D'Jalma Ganier, taught Louis Armstrong to play trumpet; Armstrong would then popularize the New Orleans style of trumpet playing, and then expand it. Like <b>Jelly</b> <b>Roll</b> Morton, Armstrong is also credited with the abandonment of ragtime's stiffness in favor of swung notes.
