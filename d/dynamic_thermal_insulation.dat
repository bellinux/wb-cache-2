Improving the {{detection}} of <b>thermal</b> <b>insulation</b> in buildings –which includes the development of models for heating and ventilation processes and fabric gain- could significantly increase building energy efficiency and substantially contribute to reductions in energy consumption and in the carbon footprints of domestic heating systems. <b>Thermal</b> <b>insulation</b> standards are now contractual obligations in new buildings, although poor energy efficiency is often a defining characteristic of buildings built before the introduction of those standards. Lighting, occupancy, set point temperature profiles, air conditioning and ventilation services all increase the complexity of measuring insulation efficiency.

The identification of <b>thermal</b> <b>insulation</b> failure can help to reduce energy consumption in heating systems.
