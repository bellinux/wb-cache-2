2500|$|Moscoe {{has often}} called for {{reforms in the}} Toronto Police Service, {{particularly}} as regards the force's relations with racial minority groups.

He was {{a founding member of}} Metro Toronto's Council Action Committee to Combat Racism but resigned in January 1991, saying that it had rendered itself ineffectual by declining to make police issues a priority. Metro Chairman Alan Tonks, who established the committee, argued that an emphasis on police issues would duplicate the work of the Metro Police Commission and reduce police morale. Moscoe sought an appointment to the Police Commission in late 1990, but withdrew his name after failing to win Tonks's support.|$|E
