5000|$|These {{documents}} are of historical interest, as representing the attitudes regarding {{the training of}} <b>emergency</b> <b>ascents</b> circa 1978: ...|$|R
25|$|Controlled <b>emergency</b> <b>ascents</b> {{are almost}} always a {{consequence}} of loss of breathing gas, while uncontrolled ascents are usually {{the result of a}} buoyancy control failure.|$|R
25|$|<b>Emergency</b> <b>ascents</b> may be {{classified}} as independent action, where no assistance required from another diver, and dependent action, where assistance is provided by another diver.|$|R
25|$|An <b>emergency</b> <b>ascent</b> {{implies that}} the diver {{initiated}} the ascent intentionally, and made {{the choice of the}} procedure. Ascents that are involuntary or get out of control unintentionally are more accurately classed as accidents.|$|E
25|$|Another form of ascent {{which may}} be {{considered}} an <b>emergency</b> <b>ascent</b> is a tethered-ascent – where the diver has unintentionally lost full control of buoyancy due {{to a loss of}} ballast weight, and controls ascent rate by use of a ratchet dive reel {{with the end of the}} reel line secured to the bottom.|$|E
25|$|Emergency ascents may be broadly {{categorized}} as independent ascents, where the diver is alone and manages the ascent alone, and dependent ascents, where the diver is assisted by another diver, who generally provides breathing gas, {{but may also}} provide transportation or other assistance. <b>Emergency</b> <b>ascent</b> usually refers to cases where the distressed diver is at least partially able {{to contribute to the}} management of the ascent.|$|E
50|$|Controlled <b>emergency</b> <b>ascents</b> {{are almost}} always a {{consequence}} of loss of breathing gas, while uncontrolled ascents are usually {{the result of a}} buoyancy control failure.|$|R
25|$|Controlled <b>emergency</b> {{swimming}} <b>ascent</b> (CESA) is an <b>emergency</b> swimming <b>ascent</b> {{which remains}} {{under control and}} which is performed at a safe ascent rate, with continuous exhalation at a rate unlikely to cause injury to the diver by lung over-expansion.|$|R

25|$|The most {{frequent}} root cause for diving fatalities {{is running out}} of or low on gas. Other factors cited include buoyancy control, entanglement or entrapment, rough water, equipment misuse or problems and <b>emergency</b> <b>ascent.</b> The most common injuries and causes of death were drowning or asphyxia due to inhalation of water, air embolism and cardiac events. Risk of cardiac arrest is greater for older divers, and greater for men than women, although the risks are equal by age 65.|$|E
25|$|If {{the weights}} have {{a method of}} quick release, they can provide a useful rescue mechanism: they can be dropped in an {{emergency}} to provide an instant increase in buoyancy which should return the diver to the surface. Dropping weights {{increases the risk of}} barotrauma and decompression sickness due to the possibility of an uncontrollable ascent to the surface. This risk can only be justified when the emergency is life-threatening or the risk of decompression sickness is small, {{as is the case in}} free diving and scuba diving when the dive is well short of the no-decompression limit for the depth. Often divers take great care to ensure the weights are not dropped accidentally, and heavily weighted divers may arrange their weights so subsets of the total weight can be dropped individually, allowing for a somewhat more controlled <b>emergency</b> <b>ascent.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} years of scuba, each diver carried a single second-stage regulator, {{and in the case of}} an out of air {{emergency}} the buddy pair would make an <b>emergency</b> <b>ascent</b> to the surface while the two divers took turns buddy breathing from the mouthpiece of remaining functional scuba set. [...] Though this system worked effectively enough in a swimming pool or in open water practice sessions, and sometimes worked for skilled and disciplined divers in actual emergencies, in some cases the stress and physical difficulties of the situation caused this system to fail. [...] To simplify the procedure for air sharing, the recreational diving industry moved to a configuration that provided each diver an additional second-stage regulator, as a backup to the primary; the backup is known variously as the [...] "octopus stage", [...] "backup", [...] "secondary" [...] or [...] "safe second" [...] (obsolescent). The term octopus came about because with several regulator and other hoses hanging from the first stage, the unit started to look a bit like an octopus. [...] Two general systems have evolved for carrying and deploying the backup demand valve – one more prevalent in recreational diving and the other commonly found in technical diving (although some crossover exists). In both systems, each diver carries two demand valves. They may be attached to the first-stage regulator of a single tank or to two first stage regulators of twin cylinders. The primary regularor is used for normal breathing during the dive and the secondary regulator ("octopus") is a backup for oneself or for the out-of-air buddy.|$|E

5000|$|Few {{issues of}} diver {{training}} {{have been more}} controversial than the teaching of <b>emergency</b> <b>ascent</b> procedures.

25|$|Barotrauma of ascent {{is caused}} by {{pressure}} differences between the decreasing ambient pressure and the internal pressure of gas filled spaces of the diver's body. The two organs most susceptible to barotraumas of ascent are the ears and lungs, and both will normally equalize automatically. Problems may arise in the middle ear if the Eustachian tubes become blocked during the dive, and the lungs can be injured if the diver forcibly holds his or her breath during ascent, which can occur during an <b>emergency</b> free <b>ascent.</b> As lung overexpansion injury is potentially life-threatening, entry level diver training emphasizes developing the habits of not holding one's breath while diving on scuba, and slow continuous exhalation during simulated <b>emergency</b> swimming <b>ascents.</b> Techniques for clearing blocked Eustachian tubes during ascent are also generally taught at entry level.|$|R
