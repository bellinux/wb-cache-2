40|$|Shock-wave {{profiles}} of sapphire (single-crystal Al 2 O 3) with seven crystallographic orientations were measured with time-resolved VISAR interferometry at shock stresses {{in the range}} 16 to 86 GPa. Shock propagation was normal {{to the surface of}} each cut. The angle between the c-axis of the hexagonal crystal structure and the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>shock</b> propagation varied from 0 for c-cut up to 90 degrees for m-cut in the basal plane. Based on published shock-induced transparencies, shock-induced optical transparency correlates with the smoothness of the shock-wave profile. The ultimate goal was to find the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>shock</b> propagation in sapphire that is most transparent as a window. Particle velocity histories were recorded at the interface between a sapphire crystal and a LiF window. In most cases measured wave profiles are noisy as a result of heterogeneity of deformation. Measured values of Hugoniot Elastic Limits (HELs) depend on <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>shock</b> compression and peak shock stress. The largest HEL values were recorded for shock loading along the c-axis and perpendicular to c along the m-direction. Shock compression along the m- and s-directions is accompanied by the smallest heterogeneity of deformation and the smallest rise time of the plastic shock wave. m- and s-cut sapphire most closely approach ideal elastic-plastic flow, which suggests that m- and s-cut sapphire are probably the orientations that remains most transparent to highest shock pressures. Under purely elastic deformation sapphire has very high spall strength, which depends on load duration and peak stress. Plastic deformation of sapphire causes loss of its tensile strength.

40|$|The {{nonlinear}} {{evolution of}} unstable C-type shocks in weakly ionized plasmas is studied {{by means of}} time-dependent magnetohydrodynamical simulations. This study is limited to shocks in magnetically dominated plasmas (in which the Alfvén speed in the neutrals greatly exceeds the sound speed), and microphysical processes such as ionization and recombination are not followed. Both two-dimensional simulations of planar perpendicular and oblique C-type shocks, and fully three-dimensional simulation of a perpendicular shock are presented. For the cases studied here, the instability results {{in the formation of}} dense sheets of gas elongated in the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>shock</b> propagation, and oriented perpendicular to the magnetic field. The formation of a weak J-type front is associated with the growth of the instability from an equilibrium shock structure. After saturation, the magnetic field structure consists of arches which bow outwards in the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>shock</b> propagation, and which are anchored by the enhanced ion-neutral drag in the dense sheets. In analogy to the magnetic buoyancy (Parker) instability, saturation occurs when the magnetic tension in the distorted field lines is balanced by drag in the sheets. For the magnetically dominated shocks studied here, the distortions in the magnetic field which produce saturation are very small. Nonetheless, the enhancements of the ion and neutral densities in the sheets is very large, between two and three orders of magnitude compared to the preshock values. At these high densities, recombination processes may be important. The sheets evolve slowly in time, so that shocks propagating in a homogeneous medium may leave behind a network of intersecting filaments and sheets of dense gas elongated in the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>shock</b> propagation and perpendicular to the mean field. The temperature structure and emission properties of unstable C-type shocks in the nonlinear regime are presented in a companion paper (Neufeld & Stone 1997) ...|$|E

Interplanetary shocks {{observed}} at the Ulysses spacecraft as it traveled from the ecliptic plane {{to the southern}} solar pole have been identified and analyzed using both magnetic field and plasma measurements.

40|$|AbstractThe {{subject of}} is paper {{is a concept}} of memory in {{hysteretic}} systems. The authors take a critical stand on the analysis of this term in Setterfield (2008) and they suggest amendments to the existing approach. This paper detects two deficiencies in Setterfield's approach. The first deficiency is a complete absence of reflection of a distinction between direct shocks and indirect shocks, an idea inspired by Amable (1993, 1994), which results in the misleading practice of ordering the memory types of unit-root systems and “true” hysteretic systems on one classificatory scale. The second deficiency of Setterfield's treatment consists in missing distinguishing of the cases when shocks are applied in only one direction from the cases when the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>shocks</b> gets reversed exogenously. The presented paper combines both aspects (<b>shock</b> typology, <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>shocks)</b> to analyze the notion of memory in separate groups. The authors apply a two-criterion approach resulting in detection of three groups of Katzner-type memory, based on Katzner (1993), and three groups of Cross-type memory, drawing upon Cross (1994). The authors point out {{that in spite of}} a common ground of the Cross-type memory phenomenon and (ir) reversibility phenomenon, both analytical groups are based on fundamentally different criteria: (non-) identity of the path before and after the un-shock in the former case, (non-) identity of the initial and final short-run and long-run equilibrium value of the output variable in the latter case...|$|R

40|$|Sapphire (single-crystal Al 2 O 3) is a {{representative}} Earth material {{and is used}} as a window and/or anvil in shock experiments. Pressure, for example, at the core-mantle boundary is about 130 gigapascals (GPa). Defects induced by 100 -GPa shock waves cause sapphire to become opaque, which precludes measuring temperature with thermal radiance. We have measured wave profiles of sapphire crystals with several crystallographic orientations at shock pressures of 16, 23, and 86 GPa. At 23 GPa plastic-shock rise times are generally quite long (~ 100 ns) and their values depend sensitively on the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>shock</b> propagation in the crystal lattice. The long rise times are probably caused by the high strength of inter-atomic interactions in the ordered three-dimensional sapphire lattice.

Single crystals and layered bi-materials consisting of grains with alternating orientations relative to the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>shock</b> propagation [...] specifically [100], [111], or low-symmetry orientations [...] are impacted to peak shock stresses on the order of 5 GPa. The [111] orientation [111] is observed to be stiffest both plastically and elastically, while the [100] orientation is found to be most compliant. Layered bi-materials that only demonstrate pure longitudinal waves exhibit average shock stresses, entropy production, and internal energy in between values computed for their single crystal constituents. Layered bi-materials that generate both quasi-longitudinal and quasi-transverse waves results in lower peak stresses and higher internal energy than their single crystal constituents. In bi-material systems, stress fluctuations decrease in frequency with increasing layer thickness, and peak stress amplitudes increase with layer thickness. Average dissipation depends on orientation but is relatively insensitive to layer thickness.

Within transport simulations, it is shown that shock fronts perpendicular to beam axis form in head-on reactions. The fronts separate hot compressed matter from normal. As impact parameter increases, the angle of inclination of the fronts relative to beam axis decreases, and in-between the fronts a weak tangential discontinuity develops. Hot matter exposed to the vacuum in directions perpendicular to shock motion (and parallel to fronts), starts to expand sideways, early within reactions. Expansion in the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>shock</b> motion follows after the shocks propagate through nuclei, but due to the delay does not acquire same strength.

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{importance}} of magnetic-field-oriented thermal conduction in the interaction of supernova remnant (SNR) shocks with radiative gas clouds and in determining the mass and energy exchange between the clouds and the hot surrounding medium. We perform 2. 5 D MHD simulations of a shock impacting on an isolated gas cloud, including anisotropic thermal conduction and radiative cooling; we consider the representative case of a Mach 50 shock impacting on a cloud ten-fold denser than the ambient medium. We consider different configurations of the ambient magnetic field and compare MHD models {{with or without the}} thermal conduction. The efficiency of the thermal conduction in the presence of magnetic field is, in general, reduced with respect to the unmagnetized case. The reduction factor strongly depends on the initial magnetic field orientation, and it is minimum when the magnetic field is initially aligned with the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>shock</b> propagation. The thermal conduction contributes to suppress hydrodynamic instabilities, reducing the mass mixing of the cloud and preserving the cloud from complete fragmentation. Depending on the magnetic field orientation, the heat conduction may determine a significant energy exchange between the cloud and the hot surrounding medium which, while remaining always at levels less than those in the unmagnetized case, leads to a progressive heating and evaporation of the cloud. This additional heating may contrast the radiative cooling of some parts of the cloud, preventing the onset of thermal instabilities.

The understanding gained from this small-scale study will help to interpret the behaviour of systems with many 10 ’s or 100 ’s of clouds. We observe a wide variety of behaviour in the interactions studied, which is de-pendent on the initial positions of the clouds and the orientation and strength of the magnetic field. We find: i) some clouds are stretched along their field-lines, whereas others are confined by their field-lines; ii) upstream clouds may accelerate past down-stream clouds (though magnetic tension can prevent this); iii) clouds may also change their relative positions transverse to the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>shock</b> propagation as they “sling-shot ” past each other; iv) downstream clouds may be offered some protection from the oncoming flow as a result of being in the lee of an upstream cloud; v) the cycle of cloud compression and re-expansion is generally weaker when there are nearby neighbouring clouds; vi) the plasma β in cloud material can vary rapidly as clouds collide with one another, but low values of β are always transitory.

40|$|This Thesis {{presents}} numerical {{simulations of}} shocks interacting with regions containing multiple individual clouds. Firstly, the hydrodynamic interaction is presented. It {{is the first}} study to include 100 s of clouds in a clumpy region which `mass-load' the flow. The 'mass-loading' reduces the Mach number of the shock and leads {{to the formation of}} a dense shell. In cases in which the `mass-loading' is sufficient the flow slows enough that the shock degenerates into a wave. The shock does not decelerate below a minimum velocity determined by properties of the region. Despite the turbulence generated behind the shock, the initial mass loss from the clouds is weaker. Nevertheless, the shell is found to regulate the cloud lifetimes such that all clouds are destroyed in similar time. The one exception occurs when a few high density clouds are distributed among lower density ones. Secondly, 2 D adiabatic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a shock interacting with groups of two or three cylindrical clouds are presented. We find (i) some clouds are stretched along their field lines, whereas others are confined by their field lines; (ii) upstream clouds may accelerate past downstream clouds; (iii) clouds may also change their relative positions transverse to the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>shock</b> propagation as they `slingshot' past each other; (iv) downstream clouds may be offered some protection from the oncoming flow as a result of being in the lee of an upstream cloud; (v) the cycle of cloud compression and re-expansion is generally weaker when there are nearby neighbouring clouds. This small-scale study helps to interpret the behaviour of systems with 100 s of clouds. Infinitely wide regions can be interpreted via interactions between individual clouds, but in regions of finite width shocks driven from the sides of the region have different field-flow orientations - individual clouds can experience evolving field morphology. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{performed}} {{a set of}} cosmological simulations of major mergers in galaxy clusters to study the evolution of merger shocks and the subsequent injection of turbulence in the post-shock region and in the intra-cluster medium (ICM). The computations were done with the grid-based, adaptive mesh refinement hydro code Enzo, using an especially designed refinement criteria for refining turbulent flows {{in the vicinity of}} shocks. A substantial amount of turbulence energy is injected in the ICM due to major merger. Our simulations show that the shock launched after a major merger develops an ellipsoidal shape and gets broken by the interaction with the filamentary cosmic web around the merging cluster. The size of the post-shock region along the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>shock</b> propagation is about 300 kpc h^- 1, and the turbulent velocity dispersion in this region is larger than 100 km s^- 1. Scaling analysis of the turbulence energy with the cluster mass within our cluster sample is consistent with M^(5 / 3), i. e. the scaling law for the thermal energy in the self-similar cluster model. This clearly indicates the close relation between virialization and injection of turbulence in the cluster evolution. We found that the ratio of the turbulent to total pressure in the cluster core within 2 Gyr after the major merger is larger than 10 %, and it takes about 4 Gyr to get relaxed, which is substantially longer than typically assumed in the turbulent re-acceleration models, invoked to explain the statistics of observed radio halos. Striking similarities in the morphology and other physical parameters between our simulations and the "symmetrical radio relics" found at the periphery of the merging cluster A 3376 are finally discussed. In particular, the interaction between the merger shock and the filaments surrounding the cluster could explain the presence of "notch-like" features {{at the edges of the}} double relics.

This <b>shock</b> has been made visible via NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer. The formation <b>of</b> this bow <b>shock</b> {{can be explained by}} a mass loss rate of about 1.1 × 10−7 times the mass of the Sun per year, which equals the mass of the Sun every nine million years.|$|R
50|$|A simple {{shock tube}} is a tube, {{rectangular}} or circular in cross-section, usually constructed of metal, {{in which a}} gas at low pressure and a gas at high pressure are separated using some form of diaphragm. See, for instance, texts by Soloukhin, Gaydon and Hurle, and Bradley. The diaphragm suddenly bursts open under predetermined conditions to produce a wave propagating through the low pressure section. The shock that eventually forms increases the temperature and pressure of the test gas and induces a flow in the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>shock</b> wave. Observations {{can be made in}} the flow behind the incident front or take advantage of the longer testing times and vastly enhanced pressures and temperatures behind the reflected wave.|$|R
30|$|The {{response}} of NIM to WADD shock is only 0.01 {{in the current}} period, but it increases over time and reaches 0.05 at the first quarter. Then, it descends gradually to 0 near the 10 th quarter. After five quarters, NIM increases cumulatively by about 12.5  % caused by WADD <b>shock.</b> The effect <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> RA <b>shock</b> has changed from the 3 rd quarter to the 4 th quarter. The {{response of}} NIM to RA shock has declined persistently until reaching the lowest point − 0.03 at the 4 th quarter. Compared with WADD and RA, IIE has a more significant impact on NIM. The response of NIM to IIE shock gets to the maximum 0.075 at the 3 rd quarter and falls quickly thereafter.|$|R
