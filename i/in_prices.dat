5|$|Initially, oil {{production}} {{was conducted by}} many small producers. The early exploration and production frenzy produced an unstable supply of oil, which often resulted in overproduction. In the early years, a few major finds led to easy availability and major drops <b>in</b> <b>prices,</b> but were followed by limited exploration and a sudden spike <b>in</b> <b>prices</b> as production dwindled. The situation led exploration to spread into the neighboring states of Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Arkansas, who competed with Texas for dominance in {{oil production}}. The strike at Glenn Pool near Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1905 established Tulsa as the leading U.S. oil production center until the 1930s. Though Texas soon lagged behind Oklahoma and California, {{it was still a}} major producer.|$|E

5|$|Another {{effect of}} the common European {{currency}} is that differences in prices—in particular in price levels—should decrease because {{of the law of}} one price. Differences <b>in</b> <b>prices</b> can trigger arbitrage, i.e., speculative trade in a commodity across borders purely to exploit the price differential. Therefore, prices on commonly traded goods are likely to converge, causing inflation in some regions and deflation in others during the transition. Some evidence of this has been observed in specific eurozone markets.|$|E
5000|$|The price {{elasticity}} of supply (PES) measures the responsiveness of quantity supplied to changes <b>in</b> <b>price,</b> as the percentage change in quantity supplied induced by a one percent change <b>in</b> <b>price.</b> It is calculated for discrete changes as [...] and for smooth changes of differentiable supply functions as [...] Since supply is usually increasing <b>in</b> <b>price,</b> the {{price elasticity}} of supply is usually positive. For example, if the PES for a good is 0.67 a 1% rise <b>in</b> <b>price</b> will induce a two-thirds increase in quantity supplied.|$|R

According to the equation, PED is - 1. 19 for widgets, which means that an increase <b>in</b> <b>price</b> of $ 1 {{would result in a}} contraction of demand of $ 1. 19. Since the change <b>in</b> <b>price</b> corresponds with a more than proportionate change in demand, PED is said to be elastic.

5|$|Democrats ran {{a strong}} {{candidate}} in former lieutenant governor John G. Warwick. To drive their point home, they hired young partisans {{to pretend to}} be peddlers, who went door to door offering 25-cent tinware to housewives for 50 cents, explaining the rise <b>in</b> <b>prices</b> was due to the McKinley Tariff. In the end, McKinley lost by 300 votes, but the Republicans won a statewide majority and claimed a moral victory.|$|E
5|$|Further work on {{the model}} has shown that a slight {{difference}} in assumptions can produce completely different results. For example, Eaton and Grossmann showed that if the firms compete <b>in</b> <b>prices</b> rather in quantities (Bertrand competition rather than Cournot) then the optimal policy is an export tax rather a subsidy – a policy rarely used in practice, politically unpopular and contrary to protectionist sentiment which generally touted New Trade Theory models as an argument for their favored policies.|$|E
5|$|Other economists {{believe that}} these {{elements}} cannot completely explain the dramatic rise and fall in tulip prices. Garber's theory has also been challenged for failing to explain a similar dramatic rise and fall <b>in</b> <b>prices</b> for regular tulip bulb contracts. Some economists also point to other factors associated with speculative bubbles, such as a growth in the supply of money, demonstrated {{by an increase in}} deposits at the Bank of Amsterdam during that period.|$|E
50|$|In economics, {{the total}} revenue test {{is a means}} for {{determining}} whether demand is elastic or inelastic. If an increase <b>in</b> <b>price</b> causes an increase in total revenue, then demand {{can be said to}} be inelastic, since the increase <b>in</b> <b>price</b> does not have a large impact on quantity demanded. If an increase <b>in</b> <b>price</b> causes a decrease in total revenue, then demand can be said to be elastic, since the increase <b>in</b> <b>price</b> has a large impact on quantity demanded.|$|R

5000|$|A {{deflationary spiral}} is a {{situation}} where decreases <b>in</b> <b>price</b> lead to lower production, which in turn leads to lower wages and demand, which leads to further decreases <b>in</b> <b>price.</b> Since reductions <b>in</b> general <b>price</b> level are called deflation, a deflationary spiral occurs when reductions <b>in</b> <b>price</b> lead to a vicious circle, where a problem exacerbates its own cause [...] In science, this effect is also known as a positive feedback loop. Another economic example of this principle is a bank run.|$|R
5|$|The {{increases}} of the 1630s corresponded with {{a lull in}} the Thirty Years' War. In 1634/5 the German and Swedish armies lost ground in the South of Germany; then Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand of Austria moved north. After the Peace of Prague (1635) the French (and the Dutch) decided to support the Swedish and German protestants with money and arms against the Habsburg empire, and to occupy the Spanish Netherlands in 1636. Hence market prices (at least initially) were responding rationally to a rise in demand. However, the fall <b>in</b> <b>prices</b> was faster and more dramatic than the rise. Data on sales largely disappeared after the February 1637 collapse <b>in</b> <b>prices,</b> but a few other data points on bulb prices after tulip mania show that bulbs continued to lose value for decades thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Factory-based {{industry}} {{accounted for}} an estimated 29.7% of GDP in 2009. More than 75% of Cameroon's industrial strength is located in Douala and Bonabéri. Cameroon possesses substantial mineral resources, {{but these are not}} extensively mined (see Mining in Cameroon). Petroleum exploitation has fallen since 1986, but this is still a substantial sector such that dips <b>in</b> <b>prices</b> have a strong effect on the economy. Rapids and waterfalls obstruct the southern rivers, but these sites offer opportunities for hydroelectric development and supply most of Cameroon's energy. The Sanaga River powers the largest hydroelectric station, located at Edéa. The rest of Cameroon's energy comes from oil-powered thermal engines. Much of the country remains without reliable power supplies.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, formal futures markets {{appeared}} in the Dutch Republic during the 17th century. Among the most notable centered on the tulip market, {{at the height of}} Tulipmania. At the peak of tulip mania, in February 1637, some single tulip bulbs sold for more than 10 times the annual income of a skilled craftsworker. Research is difficult because of the limited economic data from the 1630s—much of which come from biased and very speculative sources. Some modern economists have proposed rational explanations, rather than a speculative mania, for the rise and fall <b>in</b> <b>prices.</b> For example, other flowers, such as the hyacinth, also had high initial prices {{at the time of their}} introduction, which immediately fell. The high asset prices may also have been driven by expectations of a parliamentary decree that contracts could be voided for a small cost—thus lowering the risk to buyers.|$|E

5|$|When {{the price}} {{elasticity}} {{of demand for}} a good is unit (or unitary) elastic (Ed = -1), the percentage change in quantity demanded is equal to that <b>in</b> <b>price,</b> so a change <b>in</b> <b>price</b> will not affect total revenue.|$|R
5|$|In {{response}} to the rise <b>in</b> <b>prices</b> – 14% in the twelve months to September 2008, compared with a target of 2.5% – the Central Bank of Iceland held interest rates high (15.5%). Such high interest rates, compared with 5.5% in the United Kingdom or 4% in the eurozone for example, encouraged overseas investors to hold deposits in Icelandic krónur, leading to monetary inflation: the Icelandic money supply (M3) grew 56.5% in the twelve months to September 2008, compared with 5.0% GDP growth. The situation was effectively an economic bubble, with investors overestimating the true value of the króna.|$|E
5|$|The 1637 {{event was}} popularized in 1841 {{by the book}} Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds, written by British {{journalist}} Charles Mackay. At one point 12 acres (5 ha) of land were offered for a Semper Augustus bulb. Mackay claims that many such investors were ruined by the fall <b>in</b> <b>prices,</b> and Dutch commerce suffered a severe shock. Although Mackay's book is a classic, his account is contested. Many modern scholars feel that the mania was not as extraordinary as Mackay described and argue that not enough price data are available to prove that a tulip bulb bubble actually occurred.|$|E
5|$|The {{conversion}} to meat was unfavorable for the Auxois, however. The Percheron was preferred {{for the quality}} of the meat and the Ardennais and closely related Auxois were considered to have some of the lowest quality meat. In addition, the promised market for horse meat did not materialize, and French slaughterhouses were overwhelmed by imports of cheap horses from the Americas and Eastern Europe. Because of this lack of profitability, the population of most French breeds, including the Auxois, continued to decline until 1994. The collapse <b>in</b> <b>prices</b> then forced the National Stud to redirect its draft horse-related activities.|$|E
50|$|According to {{standard}} theory, a decrease <b>in</b> <b>price</b> will result <b>in</b> less supply and more demand,while an increase <b>in</b> <b>price</b> {{will do the}} opposite. This works well for most assets but it often works in reverse for stocks due to the mistake many investors make of buying high {{in a state of}} euphoria and selling low in a state of fear or panic {{as a result of the}} herding instinct. In case an increase <b>in</b> <b>price</b> causes an increase in demand, or a decrease <b>in</b> <b>price</b> causes an increase in supply, this destroys the expected negative feedback loop and prices will be unstable. This can be seen in a bubble or crash.|$|R

5|$|While Mackay's account {{held that}} {{a wide array of}} society was {{involved}} in the tulip trade, Goldgar's study of archived contracts found that even at its peak the trade in tulips was conducted almost exclusively by merchants and skilled craftsmen who were wealthy, but not members of the nobility. Any economic fallout from the bubble was very limited. Goldgar, who identified many prominent buyers and sellers in the market, found fewer than half a dozen who experienced financial troubles in the time period, and even of these cases {{it is not clear that}} tulips were to blame. This is not altogether surprising. Although prices had risen, money had not changed hands between buyers and sellers. Thus profits were never realized for sellers; unless sellers had made other purchases on credit in expectation of the profits, the collapse <b>in</b> <b>prices</b> did not cause anyone to lose money.|$|E
5|$|A {{few years}} after the strike, the world's silver market dropped, causing the {{foreclosure}} {{of many of the}} mines. To compensate for the drop <b>in</b> <b>prices,</b> the mines' stockholders reduced the wages of the miners. Instead of striking again, the miners accepted this. In addition, the miners inadvertently dug below the water table, and the mine shafts began filling with water faster than it could be pumped out. By 1884, most of the mines were idle or closed; the last was officially closed in 1891, although lessees of the mines continued to operate them past that year. Many merchants went bankrupt and left town. The Silver Reef mines produced about $8million worth of silver ore. Between 1891 and 1901, another $250,000 worth was mined. Several people attempted to restart mining operations in 1898, 1909, 1916, and 1950, but none of these attempts were successful. After Silver Reef's mines were closed, many of the buildings were purchased for their lumber and building stone. One buyer dismantled the building he bought and discovered $10,000 in gold coins. News of the find spread quickly, and most of the buildings in Silver Reef were demolished in hopes of discovering more gold, but none was found.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of John's reign {{there was a sudden}} change <b>in</b> <b>prices,</b> as bad harvests and high demand for food {{resulted}} in much higher prices for grain and animals. This inflationary pressure was to continue {{for the rest of the}} 13th century and had long-term economic consequences for England. The resulting social pressures were complicated by bursts of deflation that resulted from John's military campaigns. It was usual at the time for the king to collect taxes in silver, which was then re-minted into new coins; these coins would then be put in barrels and sent to royal castles around the country, to be used to hire mercenaries or to meet other costs. At those times when John was preparing for campaigns in Normandy, for example, huge quantities of silver had to be withdrawn from the economy and stored for months, which unintentionally resulted in periods during which silver coins were simply hard to come by, commercial credit difficult to acquire and deflationary pressure placed on the economy. The result was political unrest across the country. John attempted to address some of the problems with the English currency in 1204 and 1205 by carrying out a radical overhaul of the coinage, improving its quality and consistency.|$|E

5|$|In Essai, Cantillon {{provided}} an advanced version of John Locke's quantity theory of money, focusing on relative inflation and {{the velocity of}} money. Cantillon suggested that inflation occurs gradually and that the new supply of money has a localised effect on inflation, effectively originating the concept of non-neutral money. Furthermore, he posited that the original recipients of new money enjoy higher standards of living {{at the expense of}} later recipients. The concept of relative inflation, or a disproportionate rise <b>in</b> <b>prices</b> among different goods in an economy, is now known as the Cantillon effect. Cantillon also considered changes in the velocity of money (quantity of exchanges made within a specific amount of time) influential on prices, although not to the same degree as changes in the quantity of money. While he believed that the money supply consisted only of specie, he conceded that increases in money substitutes—or bank notes—could affect prices by effectively increasing the velocity of circulating of deposited specie. Apart from distinguishing money from money substitute, he also distinguished between bank notes offered as receipts for specie deposits and bank notes circulating beyond the quantity of specie—or fiduciary media—suggesting that the volume of fiduciary media is strictly limited by people's confidence in its redeemability. He considered fiduciary media a useful tool to abate the downward pressure that hoarding of specie has on the velocity of money.|$|E
5|$|In South America, {{especially}} in Patagonia, {{there is an}} active modern sheep industry. Sheep keeping was largely introduced through immigration to the continent by Spanish and British peoples, for whom sheep were a major industry during the period. South America has {{a large number of}} sheep, but the highest-producing nation (Brazil) kept only just over 15 million head in 2004, far fewer than most centers of sheep husbandry. The primary challenges to the sheep industry in South America are the phenomenal drop in wool prices in the late 20th century and the loss of habitat through logging and overgrazing. The most influential region internationally is that of Patagonia, which has been the first to rebound from the fall in wool prices. With few predators and almost no grazing competition (the only large native grazing mammal is the guanaco), the region is prime land for sheep raising. The most exceptional area of production is surrounding the La Plata river in the Pampas region. Sheep production in Patagonia peaked in 1952 at more than 21 million head, but has steadily fallen to fewer than ten today. Most operations focus on wool production for export from Merino and Corriedale sheep; the economic sustainability of wool flocks has fallen with the drop <b>in</b> <b>prices,</b> while the cattle industry continues to grow.|$|E
5|$|Ownership of the {{continuous}} park blocks {{was not without}} dispute, however. After Lownsdale died without a will, and then his wife Nancy died, his estate challenged that his plat didn't require the central section to be dedicated to public use since Nancy had not signed over legal title to the land. The courts agreed in 1865. Benjamin Stark reneged on the donation of two north central park blocks to the city, instead offering to sell them for $138,000. Captain John H. Couch deeded his section, which became the North Park Blocks to the city on January 25, 1865, only ten days after receiving the federal patent for the land. Six of the South Park Blocks were lost to private parties in the 1870s, and elected city officials were unwilling to spend the asking price of $6,000 per block to purchase them so soon after the city had bought the land for Washington Park. Only a year later, a proposal to acquire the six blocks for $92,000 was brought by the city council, showing the increase <b>in</b> <b>prices</b> in that year.|$|E
