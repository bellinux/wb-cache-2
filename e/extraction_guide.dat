40|$|We have {{constructed}} a Doppler-shifter-type pulsed ultra-cold neutron (UCN) source at the Materials and Life Science Experiment Facility (MLF) of the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC). Very-cold neutrons (VCNs) with 136 -m/s velocity in a neutron beam supplied by a pulsed neutron source are decelerated by reflection on a m= 10 wide-band multilayer mirror, yielding pulsed UCN. The mirror is {{fixed to the}} tip of a 2, 000 -rpm rotating arm moving with 68 -m/s velocity {{in the same direction as}} the VCN. The repetition frequency of the pulsed UCN is 8. 33 Hz and the time width of the pulse at production is 4. 4 ms. In order to increase the UCN flux, a supermirror guide, wide-band monochromatic mirrors, focus guides, and a UCN <b>extraction</b> <b>guide</b> have been newly installed or improved.

Among various strategies, the interfacial engineering and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect of metal nanoparticles (NPs) are promising and efficient ways to maximize performance of PSCs. Interfacial engineering can passivate charge trap sites, control energy level alignment, enhance charge <b>extraction,</b> <b>guide</b> active layer morphology, improve materials compatibility, alter work functions of anode and cathode. In addition, SPR effect of metal NPs {{can be an effective}} way to store the incident light energy in localized surface plasmon modes and enhance the photogeneration of excitons. Here, I present various interfacial engineering strategies employing novel charge transport layer, such as combined layer of metal oxide/ionic liquids (IL) and metal oxide/conjugated polyelectrolyte (CPE). Ionic dipoles within IL layer effectively influenced the work function of the metal oxide and thus the electron injection/transport barrier between the conduction band of metal oxide and the LUMO of active layer could be efficiently reduced. In addition, spontaneously oriented interfacial dipoles within the CPE layer lower the energy barrier for electron injection/transport and reduce the interfacial contact resistance and inherent incompatibility between the hydrophilic metal oxide and hydrophobic active layers. Surface modification of metal oxide with fullerene-based self-assembled monolayer (FSAM) reduced the contact resistance and inherent incompatibility at the metal oxide/active layer interface, resulting in an improved device performance. I also present various plasmonic materials, such as carbon dot-supported silver NPs (CD-Ag NPs), silica-coated Ag NPs (Ag@SiO 2), and solvent-mediated Ag NPs (Ag@NMP) for high-performance PSCs. Compared to previous plasmonic materials, CD-Ag NPs led to broad light absorption originating from the ensemble of plasmon coupling effect caused by clustering Ag NPs in CD-Ag NPs. Furthermore, incorporating Ag@SiO 2 between hole transport layer and active layer led to remarkable improvement in device efficiency caused by increased light absorption and scattering via enhanced electric field distribution. These versatile and effective methods using interfacial engineering and plasmonic materials may offer possibility to commercialize organic optoelectronic devices. ope...|$|E

40|$|The {{number of}} occurrences of an old phenomenon, {{expropriation}} of foreign-owned property, had peaked in the 1970 s, and virtually every significant oil-producing developing country had nationalized its oil. Nationalization again was {{on the rise in}} the 2000 s. Using novel data, this paper examines nationalization and its effect on productivity. First, we document historical global trends in expropriations, and examine the effect from the 1960 s to the 1990 s in a sample of oil-producing developing countries. We show that nationalization brings significant productivity losses. Then, we focus on Venezuela, presenting new extensive and detailed data. In Venezuela, productivity fell sharply immediately ahead of nationalization. We suggest a less-explored channel through which nationalization affects productivity: in anticipation of nationalization, producers reduce exploration, lower employment, and increase <b>extraction.</b> <b>Guided</b> by a quantitative dynamic partial equilibrium framework for nonrenewable resources disciplined by features of the Venezuelan data, we then examine the effect of nationalization on productivity.
