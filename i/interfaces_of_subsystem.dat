40|$|International audienceAdvances {{in digital}} {{technologies}} have contributed for {{significant reduction in}} accidents caused by hardware failures. However, the growing complexity of functions performed by embedded software has {{increased the number of}} accidents caused by software faults in critical systems. Moreover, due to the highly competitive market, software intensive subsystems are usually developed by different suppliers. Often these subsystems are required to interact with each other in order to provide a collaborative service. Testing approaches for subsystems integration support verification of the quality of service, focusing on the subsystems interfaces. The increasing complexity and tight coupling <b>of</b> real-time <b>subsystems</b> make integration testing unmanageable. The ad-hoc approach for testing is becoming less effective and more expensive. This article presents an integration testing approach denominated InRob, designed to verify the interoperability and robustness related to timing constraints of real-time embedded software. InRob guides the construction of services, based on formal models, aiming at the specifications of interoperability and robustness of test cases related to delays and time-outs of the messages exchanged in the <b>interfaces</b> <b>of</b> interconnected <b>subsystems.</b> The proposed formalism supports automatic test cases generation by verifying the relevant properties in the service behavioral model.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 86 - 89) This graduate thesis report {{represents the}} findings of the initial test and evaluation conducted on an experimental frequency agile search radar. The radar was developed by U. S. Navy civilian engineers. The experimental system was implemented through the <b>interfacing</b> <b>of</b> radar <b>subsystems</b> from past military projects. These subsystems include the following: (1) a transmitter/receiver from an aircraft fire control system (2) a patrol search radar system (3) a guided missile display system. The purpose of this graduate thesis was to investigate the radar system performance through the consideration of the following: (1) the concepts of frequency agility (2) experimental system theory of operation (3) laboratory radar measurements and discussion of subsequent results. Based on these considerations, the following conclusions about the radar system performance were reached: (1) the jitter of the PRF is not random and is therefore an ineffective anti-jamming device (2) the operation of the transmitter (magnetron) is unstable in the long pulse mode (PRF of 500) and is therefore likely to become unstable in the short pulse mode (PRF of 1000). Due to constraints of time and equipment in this study, several system measurements were not conducted. It is therefore recommended that the following series of measurements be considered at a future time: (1) laboratory testing to determine fast tuned AFC performance and the antenna gain (2) field testing to determine system performance under real conditions of clear, clutter, and ECM environments...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{a set of}} tools that provide automatic support for application {{of some of the}} traditional soft-ware engineering practices when developing with Simulink. The tools are the: Signature Tool, Reach/Coreach Tool, Data Store Push-Down Tool, and Auto Layout Tool. The Signature Tool extracts the <b>interface</b> <b>of</b> a Simulink <b>subsystem,</b> identifying the subsystem’s explicit, and implicit data flow mechanisms, empowering developers to use the implicit mechanisms more effectively. The Reach/Coreach Tool identifies data and control flow dependencies in a Simulink model and uses the information for model slicing. The view of de-pendencies offered by the tool significantly eases the comprehension of large models. The dependencies can also serve as indicators of alternative designs, and facilitate more effective testing and verification. The Data Store Push-Down Tool restricts the scope of Simulink’s data stores thereby providing improved encapsulation, and increasing modularity. Finally, the Auto Layout Tool significantly decreases the manual effort develop-ers spend in achieving proper layout of models during design and refactoring, and can be used by automated refactoring and transformation tools. ...|$|R

The rover is a highly autonomous six-wheeled terrain vehicle on the surface of the moon. The rover has 3 pair of “eyes”: navigation cameras and panoramic cameras, both mounted on a mast, hazard avoidance cameras mounted on the lower portion on the front of the rover. The cameras work in cooperation by providing a complementary view of the terrain and aid in rover navigation and also perform science investigations. Additionally, the rover has a robotic arm which has flexibility through three joints: shoulder, elbow and wrist. The robotic arm enables the scientific instrument at the end of the arm to extend, bend, and angle precisely against a rock or soil to analyze the elemental composition of them. Beijing Aerospace Control Centre (BACC), as the control centre of the China Lunar Exploration Project, faces big challenges to operate the China’s first lunar rover.

CSW also defines the types of components that can be constructed and their roles. The use of common component types and shared middleware services allows standardized software interfaces for the components. A software system called the TMT Interface Database System was constructed to support the documentation <b>of</b> the <b>interfaces</b> for components based on CSW.

First, the global characteristics of LTSs are emphasized, Second, LTSs {{are identified as}} those technical systems {{that are able to}} structure social perception of space and time. Finally, LTSs are defined as systems constituted at the <b>interface</b> <b>of</b> several <b>subsystems.</b> These claims are illustrated with several examples. More attention should be devoted to the interaction mechanisms between the various factors that shape the development patterns of LTSs. An approach based on composition of factors is therefore stressed. We were the first to say that in order to represent the new and the future we need totally new words and totally new relations among those words. -Alexei Kruchenykh (1913) i Large technical systems (LTSs) have always been closely interrelated with the type of social organization in which they evolve. These systems, whether they be transport systems such as railways or energy distribution systems such as electricity networks, have exerted and exert a powerful and lasting influence on all levels of organization of modern societies. These systems themselves are also social constructions. They are modeled by existing social forms that shape both their technical structure and their social applications. That is why analyzing the interactions between social forms and technolog-ical systems is a difficult task for which neither the deterministic approach nor the voluntarist approach is wholly satisfactory. In this article, I first propose and discuss a very restricted definition of LTSs. In the second and third parts, by capitalizing on models introduced by Hugh Aitken, I propose to draw more attention to the interaction mechanisms among the various factors that shape the development patterns of LTSs.
