Secondly, we address the impact of disturbance in an epidemic model, where the aim of the control strategy is to eradicate an endemic pathogen, or to prevent the invasion of a pathogen into a susceptible population. The movement of individuals between patches is modelled as both a constant rate, and a function which is increasing with population density. Finally, we discuss the `optimal' control strategy in this context.|$|E

40|$|In running waters, {{chemical}} cues {{have generally}} been assumed to always come from upstream locations. Here, we present ¢eld and laboratory evidence that Gammarus pulex can use chemical cues from down- stream predators to adaptively adjust drifting behaviour.

In a subsequent laboratory experiment, Gammarus actively avoided live trout and trout chemicals placed downstream in an arti¢cial stream, whereas no e¡ects were found <b>in</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> or visual cues. We suggest that the mechanism explaining the ability of Gammarus to detect downstream predators is use of back£ows, which locally transport ¢sh chemicals against the main £ow.

40|$|This paper uses a {{mathematical}} framework {{to investigate the}} impact of increased movement in response to disturbance caused by disease control strategies. Implementation of invasive disease control strategies such as culling may cause species to disperse beyond their natural range, thus aiding the spread of infection to otherwise infection free areas. Both linear and non-linear dispersal functions are compared with constant per capita dispersal in a coupled two patch SI model. For highly virulent or infrequently transmitted pathogens, {{it is found that}} an increase of dispersal due to control requires a higher level of disease control than in the constant dispersal model. Patches which may be sources or reservoirs of infection are investigated and it is found that if dispersal increases <b>in</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>control,</b> then all patches, reservoir or not, must be targeted. The single host two patch model is then extended to a two host wildlife/livestock system with one species ‘wildlife' free to move between patches and the other ‘livestock' confined. In the two host case, control of one species alone will only achieve successful pathogen exclusion if that species is a reservoir for infection...|$|E
