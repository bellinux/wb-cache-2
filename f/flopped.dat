5|$|Aarakshan (2011), a socio-drama {{based on}} the issue of caste based {{reservations}} in Indian, was Bajpayee's next film. The film sparked controversy in some groups and was banned in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Andhra Pradesh before its theatrical release. Trade journalists had high expectations for the film, but it ultimately <b>flopped</b> at the box office. Bajpai's followup was the thriller Lanka (2011).|$|E

Woods produced several more plays; none were hits and {{when he died in}} 1951, he was bankrupt and living in a hotel.|$|E

5|$|After the {{critical}} success of Karma, the couple returned to India in 1934. Although the Hindi {{version of the}} film, released in India in 1934, <b>flopped</b> without a trace, Himanshu Rai had established the required networks in Europe, {{and was able to}} start a film studio named Bombay Talkies, partnering with Niranjan Pal, a Bengali playwright and screenwriter who he had met previously in London, and Franz Osten, who directed several of Rai's films.|$|E
5|$|Funding was {{a problem}} from the outset. No {{producer}} was willing to finance the film, as it lacked stars, songs and action scenes. On learning of Ray's plan, one producer, Mr Bhattacharya of Kalpana Movies, contacted Bandopadhyay's widow to request the filming rights and get the film made by Debaki Bose, a well-established director. The widow declined as she had already permitted Ray to make the film. The estimated budget for the production was 70,000 (about US$14,613 in 1955). One producer, Rana Dutta, gave money to continue shooting, but had to stop after some of his films <b>flopped.</b>|$|E
30|$|According to [17], the QR {{decomposition}} {{of the channel}} matrix H∈C^M × M needs (8 M^ 3 + 6 M^ 2) <b>flops.</b> In the case H∈C^ 4 × 4, this computation complexity is equivalent to 608 <b>flops.</b> Also, computational complexity required for calculations of Eqs. (9) (10) is equivalent to 120 <b>flops</b> and that of (15) to (21) is 50 <b>flops.</b> The remaining calculations equal to 30 <b>flops.</b> As a result, the total computational complexity required by the simple or adaptive STBC-CQ-PNC is 808 <b>flops</b> for each.|$|R

50|$|A {{ring counter}} with 15 sequentially-ordered states {{is an example}} of a state machine. A 'one-hot' {{implementation}} would have 15 flip <b>flops</b> chained in series with the Q output of each flip <b>flop</b> connected to the D input of the next and the D input of the first flip <b>flop</b> connected to the Q output of the 15th flip <b>flop.</b> The first flip <b>flop</b> in the chain represents the first state, the second represents the second state, and so on to the 15th flip <b>flop</b> which represents the last state. Upon reset of the state machine all of the flip <b>flops</b> are reset to '0' except the first in the chain which is set to '1'. The next clock edge arriving at the flip <b>flops</b> advances the one 'hot' bit to the second flip <b>flop.</b> The 'hot' bit advances in this way until the 15th state, after which the state machine returns to the first state.|$|R

5|$|It did {{not seem}} to Dietz as if there was any {{relationship}} between critical praise and audience enthusiasm for January films. The best-rated, Disney's 2004 animated musical Teacher's Pet, was a commercial failure, as was 2001's The Pledge. Cloverfield, the third entry, was a success, and behind it Freedom Writers had ridden its good reviews to do some modest box office in 2007; however How She Move had <b>flopped</b> that same year.|$|E

5|$|In 1990, the IRS seized most of Nelson's assets, {{claiming}} that he owed US$32,000,000. In addition to the unpaid taxes, Nelson's situation was worsened by the weak investments he had made during the early 1980s. In 1978, after he fired Reshen, Nelson was introduced by Dallas lawyer Terry Bray to the accounting firm Price Waterhouse. To repay the debt Reshen had created with the IRS, Nelson was recommended to invest in tax shelters that ultimately <b>flopped.</b> While the IRS disallowed his deductions for 1980, 1981 and 1982 (at a time that Nelson's income multiplied), due to penalties and interests, the debt increased {{by the end of}} the decade.|$|E
5|$|Born into a wealthy, anglicized Indian family, Devika Rani {{was sent}} to {{boarding}} school in England at age nine {{and grew up in}} that country. In 1928, she met Himanshu Rai, an Indian film-producer, and married him the following year. She assisted in costume design and art direction for Rai's experimental silent film A Throw of Dice (1929). Both of them then went to Germany and received training in film-making at UFA Studios in Berlin. Rai then cast himself as hero and her as heroine in his next production, the bilingual film Karma (1933), made simultaneously in English & Hindi. The film premiered in England in 1933, elicited interest there for a prolonged kissing scene featuring the real-life couple, and <b>flopped</b> badly in India. The couple returned to India in 1934, where Himanshu Rai established a production studio, Bombay Talkies, in partnership with certain other people. The studio produced several successful films over the next 5-6 years, and Devika Rani played the lead role in many of them. Her on-screen pairing with Ashok Kumar became popular in India.|$|E

5|$|The {{partnership}} with Gilbert {{had been so}} profitable that Carte and his wife sought to reunite the author and composer, eventually succeeding {{with the help of}} Tom Chappell, their music publisher. Their next opera, Utopia Limited (1893), ran for 245 performances, barely covering the expenses of the lavish production, although it was the longest run at the Savoy in the 1890s. Sullivan came to disapprove of the leading lady, Nancy McIntosh, and refused to write another piece featuring her, while Gilbert insisted that she must appear in his next opera. Instead, Sullivan teamed up again with his old partner, F. C. Burnand. The Chieftain (1894), a heavily revised version of their earlier two-act opera, The Contrabandista, <b>flopped.</b> Gilbert and Sullivan reunited one more time, after McIntosh announced her retirement from the stage, for The Grand Duke (1896). This also failed, and Sullivan never worked with Gilbert again, although their operas continued to be revived with success at the Savoy.|$|E
