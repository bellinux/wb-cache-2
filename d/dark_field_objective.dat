40|$|We have {{developed}} a simple and rapid technique for measuring the action spectra for phototaxis of populations of microorganisms and applied it to halobacteria. A microscope with a dark-field condenser was used to illuminate the cell suspension in a sealed chamber with light of wavelength greater than 750 nm; in this region of the spectrum, the halobacteria show no phototactic response. A 150 -micron spot of light from a xenon arc lamp, whose wavelength and intensity can be varied, was projected through the objective lens {{into the center of}} the <b>dark</b> <b>field.</b> The <b>objective</b> lens imaged this measuring spot through a 780 -nm cut-off filter on an aperture in front of a photomultiplier. The intensity of the scattered 750 -nm light, and therefore the photomultiplier current, is proportional to the number of cells in the measuring spot. A third lamp provided background light of variable wavelength and intensity through the dark-field condenser. To minimize secondary effects due to large changes in cell density, we recorded the initial changes in the photomultiplier current over 1 min after the actinic light had been switched on. By plotting the rate of change against wavelength, we obtained action spectra after the proper corrections for changes in light intensity with wavelength were applied and saturation effects were avoided...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo further {{enhance the}} {{correction}} reliability of flat panel detector (FPD) in Cone-Beam CT (CBCT), a monitoring and correction method for <b>dark</b> <b>field</b> fluctuations is proposed. To monitor <b>dark</b> <b>field</b> fluctuations, {{the method of}} local shielding FPD is used. Based on the variation of extreme values of <b>dark</b> <b>field</b> in local shielding region, whether there are <b>dark</b> <b>field</b> fluctuations in the projection images is judged. When the <b>dark</b> <b>field</b> fluctuations exist, judge <b>dark</b> <b>field</b> value of each line that is whether within the allowable range, and only correct the lines with abnormal <b>dark</b> <b>field</b> fluctuations. To ease FPD correction, a treatment method without gain correction for projection images is proposed. This method {{does not need to}} generate gain correction image, so does not have the gain correction step, and can directly calculate the images for CBCT reconstruction. The experiment results show that our proposed method is feasible and effective in practice...|$|R

25|$|<b>Dark</b> <b>field</b> {{microscopy}} is {{a technique}} for improving the contrast of unstained, transparent specimens. <b>Dark</b> <b>field</b> illumination uses a carefully aligned light source to minimize the quantity of directly transmitted (unscattered) light entering the image plane, collecting only the light scattered by the sample. <b>Dark</b> <b>field</b> can dramatically improve image contrast – especially of transparent objects – while requiring little equipment setup or sample preparation. However, the technique suffers from low light intensity in final image of many biological samples {{and continues to be}} affected by low apparent resolution.|$|R
30|$|Intensity imaging is {{primarily}} of two types: bright <b>field</b> and <b>dark</b> <b>field.</b> In bright field illumination, the sensor captures {{most of the}} directly reflected light.

This results in a dark appearance of the surface, but some defects appear bright in the image. <b>Dark</b> <b>field</b> view requires more intense lighting. Requirement of about eight times compared to bright field lighting has been reported [21].|$|R

5000|$|An iSCAT {{microscope}} requires illumination of {{the sample}} and collection of reflected and scattered light, which interfere at the detector. The concept is different compared to <b>dark</b> <b>field</b> microscopy, {{in the sense that}} iSCAT doesn't reject the reflected (background) light. The signal has therefore three main components: (1) reflected light, which dominates the iSCAT image and which is reduced to a minimum in <b>dark</b> <b>field</b> microscopy; (2) scattered light, which is negligible in iSCAT but the main signal in a <b>dark</b> <b>field</b> image; (3) interference term, which modulates the signal originating from reflection proportional to the scattering amplitude. iSCAT signal scales linearly with the scattering amplitude and thus particle's volume (it is V^2 in case of <b>dark</b> <b>field</b> scattering detection). The basic design of an interferometric detection has been explored for decades in interference reflection microscopy and differential interference contrast microscopy. The major difference between those techniques and iSCAT is that the latter uses a coherent light source, which increases the interferometric contrast.Biological applications: ...|$|R

The <b>dark</b> <b>field</b> contrast modality is hence a valuable tool for materials science based on neutron imaging. This is underlined by the success of the method, despite its current limitation to qualitative scattering information. Here it is demonstrated how a wavelength dispersive approach allows such drawbacks to be overcome by providing quantitative structure size information and hence can introduce novel possibilities and insights for materials science...|$|R
