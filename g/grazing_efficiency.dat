40|$|The {{objective}} of this experiment was to evaluate the ingestive behaviour, herbage intake and <b>grazing</b> <b>efficiency</b> of beef cattle steers grazing on Panicum maximum Jacq. cv. Tanzania subjected to different rotational stocking intensities. Treatments corresponded to two post-grazing conditions (residues of 25 and 50 cm) associated with a pre-grazing condition of 95 % sward canopy light interception during regrowth (LI). The grazing time increased linearly with {{the duration of the}} occupation period (475 to 630 minutes/day). On paddocks grazed down to a residue of 25 cm, the bite rate increased linearly along the occupation period, with an average of 42. 5 bites/minute. On paddocks grazed down to a residue of 50 cm, the bite rate was stable and equal to 39 bites/minute. There was no difference in herbage intake between grazing intensities. However, grazing at 25 cm residue resulted in greater herbage removal (68. 0 vs. 45. 6 %) and greater <b>grazing</b> <b>efficiency</b> (90. 4 vs. 49. 8 %) than grazing at 50 cm residue. Post-grazing residues of Tanzania guineagrass under rotational stocking management may be set at either 25 or 50 cm, since the herbage intake was not affected within this grazing intensity range.

30|$|Given the {{porosity}} {{of their}} borders, wildlife and livestock graze {{inside and outside}} of protected areas in East Africa (Peden 1987; Reid et al. 2001,Reid et al. 2003; Western 1982; Western et al. 2009). We therefore need to build our understanding of wildlife–livestock competition to better manage the mixed grazing, farming, and wildlife landscapes of East Africa. Despite common misperceptions, evidence, as described above, suggests that wildlife–livestock competition does not lead to competitive exclusion and may have a smaller impact on wildlife and livestock populations than factors external to the wildlife–livestock interaction. Other factors such as drought, habitat/pasture loss due to agriculture, disease, and hunting/predation are likely to more significantly influence the viability of wildlife and livestock populations (Homewood et al. 2001). Still competition undoubtedly occurs with an effect on the grazing strategies and <b>grazing</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of these populations. As discussed previously, we cannot infer competition simply from the sharing of a preferred resource or space (dietary or habitat overlap). The resource must be the same, limiting, and negatively affected by the activities of the other species. Where {{attempts have been made to}} move beyond diet/habitat overlap, researchers have relied on experimental designs where wildlife and livestock are enclosed in fenced pastures. For example, the effects of wildlife and livestock on vegetation are often conducted through timed runs within experimental blocks measuring a few hectares (Odadi et al. 2007; Young et al. 1998). While such work provides insights on the mechanisms behind competition, they provide little information about the nature of wildlife–livestock interactions in less-controlled, real-world situations where pastoral livestock and wildlife are highly mobile and the variability of external factors are strongly felt.|$|R

The underlying factors for their food selectivity and <b>grazing</b> <b>efficiency</b> are however far from well known. For instance, their patchy distribution in the marine environment is well documented but how meiofaunal organisms cope with the spatial distribution/accessibility of the available food resources is less clear. In the present study a laboratory experiment was conducted to test the <b>grazing</b> <b>efficiency</b> of Paramphiascella fulvofasciata (Copepoda, Harpacticoida) on the epipelic diatom Seminavis robusta applied in recipients of different area and in various concentrations. Diatoms were enriched in the stable isotope 13 C in order to trace food uptake and copepods were left to graze for 4  days.

On the contrary, {{there was no significant}} effect of the area per se where the copepods could graze upon. The lack of a significant effect of area is mainly due to the high variability in uptake that was recorded in some treatments. Although P. fulvofasciata is a very motile copepod, known as endobenthic and epibenthic species, it was able to concentrate on food uptake {{at the bottom of the}} experimental unit as there was no significant difference in uptake between treatments with different water heights in the units.

Adotou-se delineamento {{experimental}} em blocos ao acaso, com parcelas subdivididas (os genótipos representaram as parcelas e os ciclos de pastejo, as subparcelas) e quatro repetições. As massas de lâmina foliar total, verde e senescente pré-pastejo foram analisadas em seis repetições. O acúmulo e a eficiência de pastejo de lâmina foliar verde foram avaliados em delineamento em blocos casualizados, com quatro repetições. Os genótipos CE 08 A. D. e Elefante B apresentaram maiores massas de lâmina foliar total (1. 374 kg de MS/ha) e verde pré-pastejo (737 kg de MS/ha) e maior acúmulo (654 kg de MS/ha/ 44 dias) e eficiência de pastejo de lâmina foliar verde (80 %). No HV- 241, a alta eficiência de pastejo (100 % do acúmulo lâmina foliar verde) esteve associada ao baixo acúmulo de lâmina foliar verde (155 kg de MS/ha/ 44 dias). A menor eficiência de pastejo foi observada no Hexaplóide (59 % do acúmulo de lâmina foliar verde), possivelmente em virtude das altas perdas sob pastejo (30 % da massa de lâmina foliar total pré-pastejo). A massa de lâmina foliar verde diminuiu mais acentuadamente até o segundo dia de pastejo, enquanto as perdas de lâmina foliar total foram maiores no 2 º e 3 º dias de pastejo. Os genótipos CE 08 A.

The leaf blade of the tiller close to feces also achieved lower de foliation (1. 64) than that in the tiller distant from feces (3. 97).

The grazing pressure of the zooplankters, dominated by r-strategists, was highly variable; and zooplankter-species replacement by those of different <b>grazing</b> <b>efficiencies</b> promoted changes in the phytoplankton structure and nanoplankton biomass. Plankton samples were taken thrice weekly at two sampling stations in the Salado River lower sector (Buenos Aires province, Argentina). Since almost one-third of the country´s agricultural and cattle productions come from the Salado-River basin, limnological {{research has been conducted}} there during recent decades. The objectives of this study were to determine the succesional changes in the zooplankton biomass and the relationship of that biomass to physical parameters and palatable phytoplankton species and to evaluate the observational time scale. To estimate grazing we employed three models and also the relationship between the zoo- and nanoplankton biomasses. The seasonal temperature and conductivity changes indicated three clearly different periods and were the main parameters driving the seasonal succession of the zooplankton. During the first period, the total zooplankton biomass was less than in the other two, with the tintinnids predominating. Later, the rotifers became prevalent, with a predomination by Brachionus plicatilis and Keratella tropica. A top-down effect on the total phytoplankton biomass by the zooplankton was not detected, though a diminution in the values for certain palatable algae was observed. The biomass of the nanoplankton species was significantly related to the total zooplankton biomass, with the highest rotifer values being associated with an exponential decrease in the nanoplankton biomass.

Grazing systems in harsh environments are common throughout the world, and animal production is {{the mainstay of}} the livelihoods of many resource-poor farmers. The energy cost of the various activities {{involved in the process}} of harvesting the pasture to transform it into animal product can be estimated through an energy balance. This cost would be the difference between the metabolizable energy intake (MEI) and the energy expenditures for maintenance (MEm), temperature regulation (MEtr), and the energy for production (MEp). Each of the ME has its own net energy (NE) and its associated efﬁciency (K). When MEI > MEm þMEtr þMEp; the difference is attributable to the energy dissipated during <b>grazing.</b> The <b>efﬁciency</b> of converting the energy consumed into animal products depends on the magnitude of the dissipation. The inefﬁciency is associated with the energy spent in locomotion and the stress produced when there is low availability of energy in the pasture.

40|$|Dairy {{production}} in the US has experienced a marked increase {{in the size of}} dairy operations over time. Even as total production has grown over time, smaller operations have been disappearing. Consequently, the viability of smaller dairy farms has become an important policy concern in regions like the Mid-Atlantic where small dairy farms account for a significant share of farm enterprises. Previous studies suggest that dairy farming based on intensive (rotational) grazing, as opposed to traditional confined-feeding operations, may make it possible for smaller operations to remain economically viable. However, the short term nature of the data used in these studies limits the robustness of these findings. We utilize a unique panel of financial data collected during a 15 -year-long extension program in Maryland, which allows us to investigate relative performances of intensive grazing operations with more robustness and more in depth than previous studies. We compare technical efficiency, profitability, and risk in intensive grazing and confinement dairy operations. Using year-by-year data envelopment analysis, we assess returns to scale and compare intensive grazing and confinement systems in terms of technical efficiency. A test of returns to scale suggested by Simar and Wilson (2002) shows that constant returns to scale cannot be rejected, indicating that smaller farms are not necessarily at disadvantage at least in the observed range of operation scale in our data. A comparison of technical efficiency using non-parametric tests and regression indicates that grazers are as technically efficient as conventional confinement operators. A test of second order stochastic dominance suggested by Barrett and Donald (2003) shows that profitability is less risky in intensive grazing than in confinement operations. Overall, these results indicate that intensive (rotational) grazing is a promising approach for improving both the economic and environmental sustainability of dairy farming in regions like the Mid-Atlantic where the climate allows a relatively lengthy grazing season. dairy, intensive grazing, rotational <b>grazing,</b> technical <b>efficiency,</b> stochastic dominance, Farm Management, Livestock Production/Industries, Productivity Analysis, Q 12, Q 16,...|$|R

Using a modelling approach, we tested the hypothesis that the increase in light from winter to spring induces a decrease in diatom nutritional status (i. e., an increase in the C:N and C:P ratios), thereby reducing their palatability and allowing them to bloom. To this end, a formulation describing the Stoichiometric Modulation of Predation (SMP) has been implemented in a simplified version of the European Regional Seas Ecosystem Model (ERSEM). The model was coupled with the General Ocean Turbulence Model (GOTM), implemented at the station L 4 and run for 10 years (2000 – 2009).

40|$|International audienceThe use of Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) for archaeological {{purposes}} {{is becoming}} more prevalent in order to detect and to document remains located in forested areas. One of the main interests of airborne laser scanning {{is to put the}} archaeological information in their context, and to allow {{a better understanding of the}} relation between each item and its environment. This concept of archaeological landscape generally results in a too large amount of data to permit a manual analysis. This paper describes an approach for the automatic detection of elementary archaeological grazing structures, found in high concentration in some places of Auvergne (France). These elementary structures are generally connected, creating complex archaeological grazing sets. The detection process is based on the design of a model of an elementary grazing structure.

40|$|A {{literature}} {{synthesis of}} phytoplankton growth (μ) and grazing (m) rate estimates from dilution experiments reveals that microzooplankton account for most phytoplankton mortality in the oceans, averaging 60 – 75 % of daily phytoplankton production (PP) across {{a spectrum of}} open-ocean and coastal systems. For reasonable estimates of gross growth efficiency (GGE= 30 – 40 %), such impacts imply that secondary production rates of microzooplankton (MP 2 °) are typically in the range 21 – 34 % of PP. However, multiple trophic transfers within the microbial community can further enhance total microzooplankton production by an additional third to a half (MPtot= 28 – 55 % of PP). These estimates are 2 – 5 times typical values for bacterial production (10 – 15 % of PP). Thus, in aggregate and on average, microzooplankton consume substantially more (6 – 7 times) production from phytoplankton than from heterotrophic bacteria. High grazing impacts and relatively high GGEs are consistent with population growth rates for microzooplankton and phytoplankton that are roughly equivalent under ambient conditions, which may be requisite for <b>grazing</b> regulation.

The mission is based on the technically robust design of the Gravity and Extreme Magnetism SMEX (GEMS) which completed a Phase B study and Preliminary Design Review in 2012. The GEMS mission is enabled by time projection detectors sensitive to the photo-electric effect. Prototype detectors have been designed, and provide engineering and performance data which support the mission design. The detectors are further characterized by low background, modest spectral resolution, and sub-millisecond timing resolution. The mission also incorporates high <b>efficiency</b> <b>grazing</b> incidence X-ray mirrors, design features that reduce systematic errors (identical telescopes at different azimuthal angles with respect to the look axis, and mounted on a rotating spacecraft platform), and a moderate capability to perform Target of Opportunity observations. The mission operates autonomously in a low earth, low inclination orbit with one to ten downlinks per day and one or more uplinks per week. Data and calibration products will be made available through the High Energy Astrophysics Science and Archival Research Center (HEASARC) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to evaluate the patterns of defoliation in plants of various heights in the same pasture of Brachiaria decumbens cv. Basilisk under continuous stocking with cattle. Four plant heights were evaluated (10, 20, 30 and 40 cm) in the same managed sward, with mean height equal to 25 cm. A randomized blocks design was used, with two replications. Defoliation frequency increased linearly along with plant height in the same pasture. Defoliation intensity, number of defoliations in leaf blade and percentage of leaf blade grazed per tiller also increased linearly along with plant height. The defoliation interval decreased linearly according to plant height. The quadratic model was adequately fitted into <b>grazing</b> <b>efficiency</b> data, reaching the highest value (98 %) at the sward site with 35 cm plants. The percentage variation in signal grass height showed a negative linear response with initial plant height. The structure of the pasture, characterized by the diversity in plant heights, is simultaneously the cause and consequence of the variability in defoliation patterns in individual tillers, which occur on the horizontal plane of the pasture.   <br /...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the dry matter production of elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum) genotypes, managed under intermittent stocking. A completely randomized design was used, with two genotypes and three replicates. The treatments consisted of factorial combinations (2 x 2 x 2) of genotypes ('BRS Kurumi ' and the clone CNPGL 00 ‑ 1 ‑ 3), two light interception levels (LI) {{at the onset of}} grazing (90 and 95 %), and two post‑grazing canopy heights (30 and 50 cm). A total of 24 Holstein x Zebu crossbred heifers were used. The stocking density varied in order to finish the grazing periods in two days. The interval between the defoliation, based on 95 % LI, resulted in a higher leaf mass per grazing cycle. The post‑grazing height of 30 cm did not affect the number of grazing cycles but provided a greater herbage accumulation rate. The cultivar BRS Kurumi has higher pasture growth, lower rest period, and greater number of grazing cycles, which results in increased forage production in the growing season.

40|$|Evaluating {{greenhouse}} gas (GHG) emissions at farm level {{is an important}} tool to mitigate climate change. Livestock account for 80 % of the total GHG emissions in Uruguay, and beef cow-calf systems are possibly the largest contributors. In cow-calf grazing systems, optimizing forage allowance and grazing intensity may increase pasture productivity, reproductive performance, beef productivity, and possibly reduce GHG emissions. This study estimated GHG emissions per kg of live weight gain (LWG) and per hectare from 20 cow-calf systems in Uruguay, with different management practices. The GHG emissions were on average 20. 8 kg CO 2 -e. kg LWG- 1, ranging from 11. 4 to 32. 2. Beef productivity and reproductive efficiency were the main determinants of GHG emissions. Five farm clusters were identified with different productive and environmental efficiency by numerical classification of relevant variables. Improving <b>grazing</b> <b>efficiency</b> by optimizing the stocking rate and forage production can increase beef productivity by 22 % and reduce GHG emissions per kg LWG by 28 % compared to “low performance ” management. Further improvements in reproductive efficiency can increase productivity by 41 % and reduce GHG emissions per kg LWG by 23 %, resulting in a “carbon smart” strategy. However, the most intensified farms with highest stocking rate and beef productivity, did not reduce GHG emissions per kg LWG, while increased GHG emissions per ha compared to the carbon smart.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the effects of restricting access time to pasture and time of grazing allocation on grazing behaviour, daily dry matter intake (DMI), rumen fermentation, milk production and composition in dairy cows. Twenty-one autumn-calving Holstein cows were assigned to one of the following 3 treatments: providing access to a daily strip of pasture for either 8 h between 07 : 00 and 15 : 00 h (T 7 – 15), 4 h between 07 : 00 and 11 : 00 h (T 7 – 11), or 4 h between 11 : 00 and 15 : 00 h (T 11 – 15). The experimental period consisted of 3 weeks of adaptation and 6 weeks of measurements. Cows were offered a daily herbage allowance of 18 kg DM/cow to ground level, 6. 1 kg DM/day of a ground sorghum grain-based supplement and 5. 2 kg DM/day of maize silage. Milk yield was greater for cows with 8 h access time to the pasture (25. 4 vs. 24. 1 for 8 and 4 h access time, respectively). Milk yield was not different between cows that access early (T 7 – 11) or late (T 11 – 15) to the grazing session. Milk protein yield was greater for cows with 8 h access time (0. 75 kg/d) vs. 4 h access time treatments (0. 72 kg/d). Cows with late access time to grazing in the morning produce more protein (0. 74 kg/d) than cows with early access to the pasture (0. 70 kg/d). Duration of access had a significant effect on herbage DMI (8. 3 vs. 6. 6 kg/d, for 8 and 4 h access, respectively), but there was no significant effect of time of grazing allocation. Intakes of concentrate and maize silage DM did not differ between treatments. Pasture depletion rate was significantly slower when cows had access to the pasture for 8 h compared with 4 h (0. 04 vs. 0. 09 cm/h), but was not affected by allocation time in the 4 -h treatments. Cows grazed for significantly longer in treatment T 7 – 11 than T 11 – 15, achieved significantly more biting and non-biting grazing jaw movements. However, because herbage DMI did not differ between treatments T 7 – 11 and T 11 – 15, it appears that cows <b>grazed</b> more <b>efficiency</b> on treatment T 11 – 15. The present study showed that reducing the period of access to pasture from 8 to 4 h decreases DMI and milk production. Cows that started their 4 -h grazing session later in the morning (T 11 – 15) produced more protein than cows that started earlier (T 7 – 11), probably as a consequence of a larger bite mass and a tendency for higher intake rate. Rumen pH of cows grazing on treatment T 11 – 15 declined faster than in cows on T 7 – 11, which is in accordance with the higher VFA and ammonia rumen concentrations observed after the grazing session started...|$|R
40|$|As {{ruminants}} {{are able}} to digest fibre efficiently and assuming that competition for feed v. food use would intensify in the future, cereals and other field crops should primarily be destined to cover the dietary needs of humans and monogastric animals such as poultry and pigs. Farming systems with a reduced or absent concentrate supplementation, as postulated by organic agriculture associations, require adapted dairy cows. The aim of this experiment {{was to examine the}} impact of concentrate supplementation on milk production, grazing and rumination behaviour, feed intake, physical activity and blood traits with two Holstein-Friesian cow strains and to conclude the consequences for sustainable and organic farming. The experiment was a cross-over study and took place on an organic farm in Switzerland. In all, 12 Swiss Holstein-Friesian (HCH) cows and 12 New Zealand Holstein-Friesian (HNZ) cows, which were paired according to lactation number, days in milk and age for primiparous cows, were used. All cows grazed full time and were supplemented either with 6 kg/day of a commercial, organic cereal-grain mix or received no supplement. After an adaptation period of 21 days, a measurement period of 7 days followed, where milk yield and composition, pasture dry matter intake estimated with the n-alkane double-indicator technique, physical activity based on pedometer measurements, grazing behaviour recorded by automatic jaw movement recorder and blood samples were investigated. Non-supplemented cows had a lower milk yield and supplemented HCH cows produced more milk than supplemented HNZ cows. Grazing time and physical activity were greater for non-supplemented cows. Supplementation had no effect on rumination behaviour, but HNZ cows spent longer ruminating compared with HCH cows. Pasture dry matter intake decreased with the concentrate supplementation. Results of blood analysis did not indicate a strong negative energy balance for either non-supplemented or supplemented cows. Minor differences between cow strains in this short-term study indicated that both cow strains are equally suited for an organic pasture-based production system with no concentrate supplementation. Many factors such as milk yield potential, animal welfare and health, <b>efficiency,</b> <b>grazing</b> behaviour and social aspects influence the decision to supplement grazing dairy cows with concentrates...|$|R

The results show a clear increase of aufwuchs biomass in the 0.9  µg g− 1  OC treatment compared to the lower LCH treatments and the control. As the mortality remained low within this treatment, an effect due to mortality (density mediated), as in the highest LCH treatment, can be excluded {{and the cause of}} the decreased <b>grazing</b> <b>efficiency</b> must be an effect on the feeding behaviour (trait-mediated effect), which matches well with the results of dry weight and triglyceride levels. Unfortunately, the data distribution in the LCH batch experiment prevented a clear statistical deduction of this indirect effect of LCH on aufwuchs. However, due to the obvious differences of the POC between the control and the two highest LCH treatments, an NOECAufwuchs at 0.09  µg g− 1  OC and an LOECAufwuchs at 0.9  µg g− 1  OC were at least estimated (Table  7). This indirect effect of LCH on the aufwuchs biomass was finally not clearly visible in the AIS experiment, due to the unknown initially reduced aufwuchs growth in treatment 1.4  µg g− 1  OC and the very high aufwuchs growth in treatment 0.007  µg g− 1  OC, which finally masked any statistical deduction of indirect LCH effects on the aufwuchs. However, the clear POC difference between the control and the highest LCH treatment at least indicate the presence of this indirect effect.|$|E
40|$|Information on the {{physiological}} ecology of grass-dominant pastures {{has made a}} substantial contribution {{to the development of}} practices that optimise the amount of feed harvested by grazing animals in temperate livestock systems. However, the contribution of ecophysiology is often under-stated, and the need for further research in this field is sometimes questioned. The challenge for ecophysiolgists, therefore, is to demonstrate how ecophysiological knowledge can help solve significant problems looming for grassland farming in temperate regions while also removing constraints to improved productivity from grazed pastures. To do this, ecophysiological research needs to align more closely with related disciplines, particularly genetics/genomics, agronomy, and farming systems, including systems modelling. This review considers how ecophysiological information has contributed to the development of grazing management practices in the New Zealand dairy industry, an industry that is generally regarded as a world leader in the efficiency with which pasture is grown and utilised for animal production. Even so, there are clear opportunities for further gains in pasture utilisation through the refinement of grazing management practices and the harnessing of those practices to improved pasture plant cultivars with phenotypes that facilitate greater <b>grazing</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Meanwhile, sub-optimal persistence of new pastures continues to constrain productivity in some environments. The underlying plant and population processes associated with this have not been clearly defined. Ecophysiological information, placed in the context of trait identification, grounded in well-designed agronomic studies and linked to plant improvements programmes, is required to address this...|$|E
40|$|Eutrophication {{has been}} one of the largest {{environmental}} problems in aquatic ecosystems during the past decades, leading to dense, and often toxic, cyanobacterial blooms. In a way to counteract these problems many lakes have been subject to restoration through biomanipulation. Here we combine 13 years of monitoring data with experimental assessment of <b>grazing</b> <b>efficiency</b> of a naturally occurring zooplankton community and a, from a human perspective, desired community of large Daphnia to assess the effects of an altered trophic cascade associated with biomanipulation. Lake monitoring data show that the relative proportion of Daphnia spp. grazers in June has increased following years of biomanipulation and that this increase coincides with a drop in cyanobacterial biomass and lowered microcystin concentrations compared to before the biomanipulation. In June, the proportion of Daphnia spp. (on a biomass basis) went from around 3 % in 2005 (the first year of biomanipulation) up to around 58 % in 2012. During months when the proportion of Daphnia spp. remained unchanged (July and August) no effect on lower trophic levels was observed. Our field grazing experiment revealed that Daphnia were more efficient in controlling the standing biomass of cyanobacteria, as grazing by the natural zooplankton community never even compensated for the algal growth during the experiment and sometimes even promoted cyanobacterial growth. Furthermore, although the total cyanobacterial toxin levels remained unaffected by both grazer communities in the experimental study, the Daphnia dominated community promoted the transfer of toxins to th...|$|E
40|$|Grazing {{management}} strategies affect not only herbage accumulation {{but also the}} efficiency of grazing. This study aimed to evaluate herbage accumulation (leaf, stem and dead material), <b>grazing</b> <b>efficiency</b> and losses of mulato grass (a Brachiaria ruziziensis × Brachiaria brizantha cv. Marandu hybrid) subjected to strategies of rotational stocking management. Treatments consisted of combinations between two post-grazing heights (15 and 20 cm) and two pre-grazing conditions (95 % and maximum canopy light interception (LI)) assigned to experimental units (1200 -m² paddocks) according to a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement and a randomized complete block design, with four replications. The experiment was carried out from Jan 2008 to Mar 2009. Season of the year influenced almost all studied variables, resulting in a common pattern of response that was determined by pre- and post-grazing management targets. Herbage accumulation was greater on swards managed at 95 %, with higher accumulation of leaves and lower accumulation of stem and dead material in relation to those managed at maximum LI (99 %) during the entire experimental period. On the other hand, herbage removal by grazing was larger on swards managed at 99 % LI, which was compensated for by the smaller number of grazing cycles and larger losses due to grazing under those circumstances. Under rotational stocking, the pre-grazing LI of 95 % and post-grazing height of 20 cm resulted in efficient grazing and high producing leafy pastures, highlighting the potential of Mulato grass pastures for animal production...|$|E
40|$|Various axenic {{strains of}} Microcystis aeruginosa {{were found to}} have {{different}} short term toxic effects on Daphnia magna. One of these toxic manifestations, the “blocking ” effect, markedly reduced the food uptake by the daphnids. In addition, several of the Microcystis strains are lethal for juvenile and adult daphnids. No correlations were found between the blocking of ingestion, lethality to daphnids, and the “mouse-killing ” factors of Microcystis. Thus, several toxic principles are responsible for the different short term toxic manifestations. Microcystis aeruginosa is commonly involved in freshwater blooms. On many occasions such blooms have been followed by a mass poisoning of livestock and wild life (mammals and birds). These toxigenic blooms have been reported from many countries (Schwimmer and Schwimmer 1969; Carmichael 198 1; Codd 1984). Studies of Microcystis toxins have shown that more than a single toxic principle is involved (Foxall and Sasner 198 l), with different toxic manifestations (Codd and Carmichael 1982; Slatkin et al. 1983), different species specificities (Foxall and Sasner 198 l), various molecular weights (Runnegar and Falconer 198 l), and different amino acid composition (Santikarn et al. 1983). Increasing attention has been given to the relationship between M. aeruginosa and aquatic grazers such as Daphnia magna (Lampert 198 1, 1982).

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{potential}} {{carrying capacity}} of tropical pastures depends {{not only on}} the productivity of the forage species and the amount of forage on offer, but also on the efficiency with which the produced herbage is harvested by the grazing animal. This study was conducted to assess the yield and <b>grazing</b> <b>efficiency</b> on ‘Guaçu ’ elephantgrass (Pennisetum purpureum Schum.) and ‘Tanzania- 1 ’ guineagrass (Panicum maximum Jacq.) pastures under rotational stocking. Forage accumulation, daily accumulation rates, grazing losses, bulk density, and utilization efficiency were measured. Treatments (forages) were replicated four times in a completely randomized design. Total forage dry matter (DM) yield over 214 days of grazing were 23850 and 15000 kg ha- 1, for the elephantgrass and the guineagrass, respectively, using 250 kg N ha- 1 in split applications after each grazing. Mean forage accumulation per grazing cycle was 7950 and 5010 kg ha- 1 and mean daily accumulation rates were 137 and 86 kg- 1 ha- 1 d- 1 for P. purpureum and P. maximum, respectively. Grazing losses per cycle averaged 1040 and 880 kg ha- 1, for grazing efficiencies of 52 and 37 % for the Pennisetum and the Panicum, respectively. Mean seasonal stocking rate was 5. 1 AU (animal unit = 500 kg LW) per ha on P. purpureum and 3 AU ha- 1 on P. maximum pastures. For both species, productivity potential resides on the high pasture carrying capacity, particularly when there are no soil fertility limitations during the warm/rainy season. Based on growth potential and stem elongation characteristics, ‘Guaçu ’ requires better managemen...|$|E
40|$|Both {{surface texture}} and littorinid grazing {{are known to}} {{influence}} the establishment of many shallow-water benthic hard-bottom communities. However, {{the effects of these}} factors and their interactions have not yet been investigated in a quantifiable manner. This investigation aims to assess the interactive effect of both factors in a strictly standardized manner. Natural recruitment by diatoms, the barnacle Balanus improvisus and the tube-building polychaete Polydora sp. was monitored under a 2 -factorial treatment: grazing by the periwinkle Littorina littorea (Factor 1; 2 levels: I or no snails per plate) on artificial recruitment plates of different initial surface rugosities (Factor 2; 5 levels: smooth, 0. 1, 0. 5, 1 and 5 mm rugosity elements), In the absence of grazers, barnacle recruitment decreased with increasing initial rugosity, polychaete recruitment peaked at intermediate rugosities, and diatoms exhibited contrasting recruitment patterns in an in vitro and an in situ experiment. When preferred recruitment sites coincided for Polydora and B. improvisus, a competition for space could be inferred from a negative correlation between the 2 species. However, when the overlap of requirements weakened on the 5 rugosities, the relationship was positive, but was not statistically significant. <b>Grazing</b> <b>efficiency</b> by L. littorea depended on initial rugosity, generally showing minimum values on intermediate rugosities which is attributable to a mismatch between radula dimensions and surface structures in these rugosity classes. Additionally, grazing effects tended to increase with higher prey densities.
