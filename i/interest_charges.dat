25|$|The 1976 coup {{ushered in}} {{what would become the}} costliest, most {{consequential}} wave of corruption in Argentina up to that point. The Economy Minister during most of the dictatorship, José Alfredo Martínez de Hoz, advanced twin anti-labor and financial deregulation policies that interrupted industrial development and upward social mobility while sharply increasing the nation's debt burden. Industrial output thus fell by 20%, real wages by at least 36%, and the public debt soared from US$8 billion to US$45 billion; by 1983, <b>interest</b> <b>charges</b> alone reached US$6.5 billion, creating a balance of payments crisis that weakened the economy for years.|$|E
25|$|Others, such as {{corporate}} directors, may {{be held to}} a {{fiduciary duty}} similar in some respects {{to that of a}} trustee. This happens when, for example, the directors of a bank are trustees for the depositors, the directors of a corporation are trustees for the stockholders or a guardian is trustee of their ward's property. A person in a sensitive position sometimes protects themselves from possible conflict of <b>interest</b> <b>charges</b> by setting up a blind trust, placing their financial affairs {{in the hands of a}} fiduciary and giving up all right to know about or intervene in their handling.|$|E
500|$|The {{manner in}} which the program was {{canceled}} led to years of litigation between the contractors and the Department of Defense over breach of contract. On 1 June 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the U.S. Navy was justified in canceling the contract. [...] The ruling also required the two contractors to repay the U.S. government more than US$1.35 billion, plus <b>interest</b> <b>charges</b> of US$1.45 billion. Boeing, which had merged with McDonnell Douglas, and General Dynamics vowed to appeal the ruling. [...] In September 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court said it would hear the two companies' arguments, that the government canceled the project improperly and that the use of a state secrets claim by the U.S. prevented them from mounting an effective defense. [...] In May 2011, the Supreme Court set aside the Appeals Court decision and returned the case to federal circuit court. [...] In January 2014, the case was settled with Boeing and General Dynamics agreeing to pay $200 million each to the U.S. Navy.|$|E

(According {{to another}} source—International Business Publications—the [...] "common view of riba among {{classical}} jurists" [...] of Islamic {{law and economics}} during the [...] "Islamic Golden Age" [...] was that <b>interest</b> <b>charges</b> on loans of [...] gold and silver currencies were unlawful, but applying [...] "interest to fiat money -- currencies made up of other materials such as paper or base metals -- to an extent" [...] was not riba.

50|$|A {{specific}} type of flexible mortgage common in Australia and the United Kingdom is an offset mortgage. The key feature of an offset mortgage {{is the ability to}} reduce the <b>interest</b> <b>charged</b> by offsetting a credit balance against the mortgage debt, with <b>interest</b> <b>charged</b> based on the outstanding net debt. Some lenders have a single account for all transactions, this {{is often referred to as}} a current account mortgage.|$|R
5000|$|The sum of {{the daily}} {{balances}} of the previous two cycles is used, but <b>interest</b> is <b>charged</b> on that amount only over the current cycle. This can result in an actual <b>interest</b> <b>charge</b> that applies the advertised rate to an amount that does not represent the actual amount of money borrowed over time, much different that the expected <b>interest</b> <b>charge.</b> The <b>interest</b> <b>charged</b> on the actual money borrowed over time can vary radically from month-to-month (rather than the APR remaining steady). For example, a cardholder with an average daily balance for the June, July, and August cycles of $100, 1000, 100, will have interest calculated on 550 for July, which is only 55% of the expected interest on 1000, and will have interest calculated on 550 again in August, which is 550% higher than the expected interest on the money actually borrowed over that month, which is 100.|$|R

2500|$|Another alleged {{deficiency}} of interest on loans {{is that it}} [...] "lends itself to speculation" [...] as lenders seek higher interest rates (allegedly) borrowing at low interest rates to lend at higher ones.

2500|$|The {{opposition}} view in {{that time}} was presented by William Andrew Paton and Russell Alger Stevenson in their Principles of Accounting (1919). To these writers, <b>interest</b> <b>charges,</b> whether contractual or non-contractual, are distribution-of-income, not expense, items. But, they say, if these charges are to be made at all, the logical procedure would be to distribute among the factory products the normal return on all the capital invested, not that on the fixed assets only. With this last contention, at least, the reviewer is inclined to agree. But Professors Paton and Stevenson appear {{to believe that the}} problem in hand is being solved on other than logical ground. For they say: [...] "The use of <b>interest</b> <b>charges</b> in cost accounts on anything like a rational basis is a procedure which faces almost insurmountable practical obstacles. It is probably this fact rather than the logic of the case that is causing cost accountants to begin to recover from the interest obsession" ...|$|E

2500|$|Mirakhor and Krichene {{argue that}} <b>interest</b> <b>charges</b> on debts {{lead to the}} {{creation}} of a secondary market for debt.

Umer Chapra also argues that [...] "the erratic behaviour of interest rates" [...] has caused [...] "three decades" [...] of [...] "turbulence in the financial markets", citing Nobel Laureate in economics Milton Friedman.|$|E
2500|$|In the 13th century Cardinal Hostiensis {{enumerated}} thirteen {{situations in}} which charging interest was not immoral. [...] The {{most important of these}} was lucrum cessans (profits given up) which allowed for the lender to charge interest [...] "to compensate him for profit foregone in investing the money himself." [...] This idea is very similar to opportunity cost. Many scholastic thinkers who argued for a ban on <b>interest</b> <b>charges</b> also argued for the legitimacy of lucrum cessans profits (e.g. Pierre Jean Olivi and St. Bernardino of Siena). However, Hostiensis' exceptions, including for lucrum cessans, were never accepted as official by the Roman Catholic Church.|$|E
2500|$|If {{the short}} {{position}} {{begins to move}} against the holder of the short position (i.e., {{the price of the}} security begins to rise), money is removed from the holder's cash balance and moved to their margin balance. [...] If short shares continue to rise in price, and the holder does not have sufficient funds in the cash account to cover the position, the holder begins to borrow on margin for this purpose, thereby accruing margin <b>interest</b> <b>charges.</b> [...] These are computed and charged just as for any other margin debit. Therefore, only margin accounts can be used to open a short position.|$|E

2500|$|Information on {{economic}} performance on CANDU is somewhat lopsided; {{the majority of}} reactors are in Ontario, {{which is also the}} [...] "most public" [...] among the major CANDU operators, so their performance dominates the available information. Based on Ontario's record, the economic performance of the CANDU system is quite poor. Although much attention has been focussed on the problems with the Darlington plant, every CANDU design in Ontario went over budget by at least 25%, and average over 150% higher than estimated. Darlington was the worst, at 350% over budget, but this project was stopped in-progress thereby incurring additional <b>interest</b> <b>charges</b> during a period of high interest rates, which is a special situation that was not expected to repeat itself.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Interest</b> <b>charges</b> {{vary widely}} from card issuer to card issuer. Often, there are [...] "teaser" [...] rates {{in effect for}} initial periods of time (as low as zero percent for, say, six months), whereas regular rates can {{be as high as}} 40 percent. In the U.S. there is no federal limit on the {{interest}} or late fees credit card issuers can charge; the interest rates are set by the states, with some states such as South Dakota, having no ceiling on interest rates and fees, inviting some banks to establish their credit card operations there. Other states, for example Delaware, have very weak usury laws. The teaser rate no longer applies if the customer does not pay their bills on time, and is replaced by a penalty interest rate (for example, 23.99%) that applies retroactively.|$|E
2500|$|One {{area where}} {{complaints}} about <b>interest</b> <b>charges</b> has gone beyond revealed truth as interpreted by Islamic scholars concerns the external debt of developing countries, where {{in some cases}} the borrowers have already paid the sum they borrowed [...] "several times, but the debt grows faster than they can repay it". Some heavily indebted countries include Afghanistan, Comoros, Guinea, Malawi, São Tomé and Príncipe. The movement for debt forgiveness (Jubilee 2000) does not argue that interest itself is sinful but that both interest and principle of large external loans should be forgiven because: debt repayment would be better spent on poverty reduction, lenders should have known that the borrowing countries poor inhabitants are not responsible for the debt because it was lent to dictators or oppressive regimes, with much of the money was lost to corruption and [...] wasteful projects.|$|E
