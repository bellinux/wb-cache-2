The fused filament fabrication (FFF) is the lowest cost AM process and is capable of producing only thermoplastic components. Powder injection molding (PIM) is a high volume low cost manufacturing technique for producing complex high precision parts from ceramic or metal powders. This research focuses on applying PIM material systems to the FFF process. Enabling the printing of a high powder loaded thermoplastic binder system which is capable of being printed by FFF methods, and be processed and sintered into a metal component. This new 3 d printing process would be much less expensive than current AM of metal materials because of FFF’s low cost and low post processing costs to produce densified parts. To achieve this, the goal was to develop a powder-polymer feedstock that could be made into FFF filament, 3 D printed, solvent <b>debound,</b> thermally <b>debound,</b> and sintered. Materials for developing the feedstock were selecting from existing FFF and PIM polymers and powders. The developed feedstock was varied to improve ease of printing. The feedstocks were then tested to determine their ability to perform the intended processing steps. The results from experimentation showed FFF printing of materials with a high powder loading of 54. 9 vol% was possible, and the printed parts can be solvent and thermally <b>debound.</b> Preliminary sintering testing indicated densification occurred but was hindered by improper processing parameters...|$|E

A resin-bonded part is formed by a rapid prototyping technique and then <b>debound</b> and infiltrated by a second aluminum alloy under a nitrogen atmosphere. During thermal processing, the aluminum reacts with the nitrogen and is partially transformed into a rigid aluminum nitride skeleton, which provides the structural rigidity during infiltration. The simplicity and rapidity of this process in comparison to conventional production routes, combined with the ability to fabricate complicated parts of almost any geometry and with high dimensional precision, provide an additional means to manufacture aluminum components...|$|E

A four-step process was used to mix hydride-dehydride titanium alloy (processed) powder (Ti- 6 Al- 4 V) with a polyethylene glycol (PEG) based water soluble binder system. The rheological properties, including flow behaviour index, flow activation energy, fluidity and melt flow index of the homogeneous feedstock, were determined with a capillary rheometer.

40|$|Metal Injection {{moulding}} (MIM) is {{a development}} of the traditional powder metallurgy (PM) process and is rightly regarded as a branch of that technology.

40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesThis thesis {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between the commercial insurance industry, global environmental change (GEC) and what Beck (1992; 1999) termed the 'risk society'. In recent decades, there have been growing concerns that many of the risks impacting contemporary society have undergone fundamental changes. Many of these risks are increasingly being linked to the unintended consequences of humankind's remarkable progress in science and technology, and have been described as <b>debounded,</b> given that they so often transcend both geographical and temporal boundaries (Beck 1992). Within the risk society, the commercial insurance industry - which relies on statistical (actuarial) analysis to help it assess and manage its risk exposure - has been described as demarcating the frontier barrier between bounded (i. e. insurable) and <b>debounded</b> (i. e. uninsurable) risk. However, this claim has been a highly contested one, leading to calls for more empirical data to help clarify how commercial insurance is actually responding under conditions of uncertainty. Of all the <b>debounded</b> risks, GEC has {{emerged as one of the}} risk society's most recognisable. Now understood to be a result of the anthropogenic emission of greenhouse gasses, particularly since the onset of the industrial revolution, its impacts have risen so sharply in recent decades that it has prompted claims that Earth has moved away from the era of the Holocene and into the Anthropocene (Crutzen 2002). Given that at least 40 % of the cost of environmental catastrophes is now borne by commercial insurance, GEC provides an excellent opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of how the industry is responding to <b>debounded</b> risk at the risk society's frontier barrier. Early commentators suggested that the commercial insurance industry would be well motivated to respond proactively to GEC, by taking a more mitigative approach to managing its drivers at both the global and local levels. However, the industry, so far, has been described as more adaptive of its own business activities than mitigative. This raises questions about whether such claims are true across all three of the insurance industry's activities - as risk carriers, risk managers and as investors, why they have responded in such ways, and what implications this has for broadening our understanding of the complex relationship between commercial insurance, <b>debounded</b> risk and the risk society's frontier barrier. To consider these questions, a collective case study was undertaken with a variety of commercial insurance companies, re-insurers, asset managers, clients, brokers, industry associations and regulators across South Africa, Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Belgium. The research identified how commercial insurers have indeed responded more by adaptation of their business activities than mitigation of the drivers of GEC. This is mainly through the use of defensive underwriting to help them manage their exposure. However, the research extends this analysis by highlighting some of the nuances of the industry's response. This includes its focus on centralisation, the influence of the existing paradigm framing its understanding of risk, and by highlighting the irony that the area of insurers' activities, initially believed to be most suited for responding to GEC (i. e. their investment portfolios), have, in practice, been the area recording the least response. In exploring why this is so, the study draws on understandings of the Anthropocene to argue that commercial insurers are finding their existing risk assessment tools progressively out-dated in a world where risk is no longer as predictable as it once was. This is further compounded by increasingly plural access to the risk society's science and technologies, which, in some instances, are undermining the role commercial insurance plays as society's primary financial risk manager. This raises questions around the role commercial insurance plays in demarcating the risk society's frontier barrier which, ultimately, has far broader implications for why so many of society's institutions are struggling to adapt to risk in the 21 st Century...|$|R

In this work, spray freeze granulation of submicron alumina is performed {{to explore the}} possibility of industrial-scale production of dense alumina via spark plasma sintering. Powder pretreatment such as sedimentation and the selection of granules with the appropriate size are employed for the maximum use of the high qualified as-prepared granules and granule sliding, which would provide a guidance for the industrial-scale production. <b>Debound</b> granules were densified via SPS and the corresponding sintering behaviors such as the recorded shrinkage and shrinkage rate were discussed. The comparison of sintering behaviors between granulated and as-received powder are conducted to identify the role of spray freeze granulation in sinterability for dense alumina. The Vickers hardness (Hv) and the fracture toughness (KIC) of the freeze granulated body are higher than the corresponding properties of the as-received body due to the more homogenous microstructure with little agglomeration in the particle packing after freeze granulation...|$|E

Production of these materials involves tailoring the size of powders to attain the correct green pore size for a given packing density through various combinations of presintering, milling, or sieving. Powders were slurry cast into soft tooling to create complex shapes and test pellets, which were then <b>debound</b> and vacuum sintered to the desired density and pore size. With these techniques, densities as low as 35 % may be attained. In the case of spherical powders, the pore size can be accurately predicted using a particle packing equation.

40|$|Several {{recent works}} have {{emphasised}} new relations of hierarchy within international society, primarily involving the claim by certain Western {{states of the}} authority to intervene in particular territories {{in order to build}} state capacity and the institutions of sound liberal democratic governance. While several scholars have identified these new hierarchies, few have provided a satisfactory account of what informs their formation and reproduction. This article investigates why new hierarchies have emerged within international society, arguing that they are underpinned by a 'liberal social logic of risk', which simultaneously constructs liberal democracies as inherently peaceful and prosperous and non-liberal or weak states as inherently risky and dangerous. Confronted by new forms of <b>debounded</b> security risks, Western societies have sought to manage these risks via interventions in identified 'risky zones' aimed at building liberal political and economic institutions. This argument is illustrated by the example of Australia's new interventionist development agenda in the Asia-Pacific, notably its leading role in the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI). This interventionist agenda is, in effect, a new mechanism of regional risk management that informs new modes of hierarchical governance in the Asia-Pacific...|$|R
40|$|Foams are {{advanced}} materials with controlled meso- and micro-structure, with huge potential {{in a variety}} of applications such as in the biomedical and automotive sectors. One promising technique for the production of Ti foams is Metal Injection Moulding in combination with Space Holders (MIMSH). Most existing work in the literature on MIM-SH foams reports very long debinding and dissolution periods that can extend for more than two days. In this paper, the effect on process speed of different water debinding and dissolution techniques of MIM-SH Ti foams will be investigated. Furthermore, the temperature influence on the debinding and dissolution behaviour of a PEG based binder and KCl space holder will be examined. In addition, some <b>debound</b> samples will be sintered in order to verify their suitability for the production of Ti foams. The results show that a heated ultrasonic bath is the fastest and most effective technique in removing the PEG and space holder, while increasing the temperature increased the removal rate up to a certain temperature (80 °C) where a significant swelling occurred, leading to a slower removal rate.

40|$|Selective laser {{sintering}} {{has been used}} to fabricate an aluminium alloy powder preform which is subsequently <b>debound</b> and infiltrated with a second aluminium alloy. This represents a new rapid manufacturing system for aluminium {{that can be used to}} fabricate large, intricate parts. The base powder is an alloy such as AA 6061. The infiltrant is a binary or higher-order eutectic based on either Al-Cu or At-Si. To ensure that infiltration occurs without loss of dimensional precision, it is important that a rigid skeleton forms prior to infiltration. This can be achieved by the partial transformation of the aluminium to aluminium nitride. In order for this to occur throughout the component, magnesium powder must be added to the alumina support powder which surrounds the part in the furnace. The magnesium scavenges the oxygen and thereby creates a microclimate in which aluminium nitride can form. The replacement of the ionocovalent Al 2 O 3 with the covalent AlN on the surface of the aluminium powders also facilitates wetting and thus spontaneous and complete infiltration.

40|$|Strengthening or {{retrofitting}} existing {{structures in}} order to increase their ductility and improve their seismic response has traditionally been accomplished using conventional materials and construction techniques. Composite materials of a polymeric matrix reinforced with long fibres (FRP) have emerged as an alternative to these methods. To view the performance of these reinforcements when seismic loads are applied, this work studies the structural response of a frame joint when a horizontal load is applied to it. Under a seismic load, joints are one of the weakest parts of these structures. The response of a plain concrete frame joint is compared with the response obtained when it is reinforced using FRP. Different configurations of FRP reinforcements are considered to compare their behaviour. The structural response of all structures considered is obtained with a numerical simulation. This is done using the finite element method. Composites are treated using the mixing theory, which obtains the composite behaviour by means of the composition of each component material properties. Each component is simulated with its own constitutive equation. The anisotropy usually found in composite components is treated using a mapped space theory. The <b>debounding</b> effects found in composite materials are treated using the formulation developed by E. Car and S. Oller [Car, 2000]. The results obtained validate the use of FRP reinforcements to improve frames seismic response. The structure load capacity is increased in a 20 % when lateral reinforcements are applied to the joint. This can avoid the structure to collapse in a seismic case.

40|$|Hot-dip {{galvanizing}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} used methods to apply zinc-based coatings on steels in order to provide sacrificial protection against corrosion over all the steel surface. The efficiency of the protection is affected by the coating mechanical response to loading: cracking and coatings delamination during forming and/or during service could decrease the corrosion resistance and could allow the contact between the environment and the substrate (the steel). The aim of this work is the analysis of the hot dip zinc coated steel plates mechanical properties by means of a non-standardized bending test performed minimizing both the bending moment differences along the bending axis and the interactions between the clamping system and the specimen coating. Bending tests are performed both on non-coated and on hot dip zinc coated plates, correlating the measured variables (applied load and crosshead displacement) with the bending moment and the specimen bending angle. Tests are characterised by a good repeatability. Results show that the main damaging mechanisms depend on the different mechanical behaviour of the intermetallic phases and on their thickness. For all the investigated coating conditions, radial cracks are observed. They initiate corresponding to the Γ phase and propagate up to the ζ−η interface. The coating thickness increase implies both an increase of the importance of the cracks in δ and ζ phases and the presence of cracks at ζ−δ interfaces. As a consequence, the increase of coating thickness implies an increase of the susceptibility to a coating-steel <b>debounding</b> damage mechanism, with a consequent loose of the coating adhesion and a decreasing of the capability of the zinc coating to improve the steel corrosion resistance. ...|$|R

An {{investigation}} into the solvent and thermal debinding behaviour of a typical paraffin wax-polymer binder system for titanium alloy Ti- 6 Al- 4 V powder injection moulding (PIM) feedstock was conducted. Details of the mixing parameters, powder loading, temperature and mixing speed were evaluated for optimal compounding of the feedstock. The feedstock was injection moulded into 22 mm diameter by 3 mm thick disks. Debinding is conducted in two stages, an initial solvent debinding step to remove the waxes, followed by a thermal debinding step to remove the polymers.

The experimental results indicate that the oxygen content in the as-sintered condition increased to almost double than that of the powder state (from 0. 08 to 0. 14 - 0. 16 wt. %) and the carbon increased by one third to half (from 0. 06 to 0. 08 - 0. 09 wt. %). This consequently resulted in a shift of the phase transformation temperature to lower values and consequently broadened the reversible austenite to martensite transformation. The uptake of oxygen and carbon during the process led to the formation of the well-known Ti 4 Ni 2 Ox and TiC precipitate phases which were evident from grey-scale images of back-scattered SEM...|$|E
40|$|Problem statement: Titanium alloy (Ti 6 Al 4 V) {{has been}} widely used as an implant for {{biomedical}} application. In this study, the implant had been fabricated using high technology of Powder Injection Molding (PIM) process due to the cost effective technique for producing small, complex and precision parts in high volume compared with conventional method through machining. Approach: Through PIM, the binder system {{is one of the}} most important criteria in order to successfully fabricate the implants. Even though, the binder system is a temporary, but failure in the selection and removal of the binder system will affect on the final properties of the sintered parts. Therefore, the binder system based on palm oil derivative which is palm stearin had been formulated and developed to replace the conventional binder system. Results: The rheological studies of the mixture between the powder and binders system had been determined properly in order to be successful during injection into injection molding machine. After molding, the binder held the particles in place. The binder system had to be removed completely through debinding step. During debinding step, solvent debinding and thermal pyrolysis had been used to remove completely of the binder system. The <b>debound</b> part was then sintered to give the required physical and mechanical properties. The in vitro biocompatibility also was tested using Neutral Red (NR) and mouse fibroblast cell lines L- 929 for the direct contact assay. Conclusion: The results showed that the properties of the final sintered parts fulfill the Standard Metal Powder Industries Federation (MPIF) 35 for PIM parts except for tensile strength and elongation due to the formation of titanium carbide. The in vitro biocompatibility on the extraction using mouse fibroblast cell line L- 929 by means of NR assays showed non toxic for the sintered specimen titanium alloy parts...|$|E
40|$|Porous pseudo-elastic NiTi alloy with {{a nearly}} three-dimensionally {{interconnected}} pore structure with structural characteristics that show promise for implant applications {{has been successfully}} fabricated by the metal injection moulding (MIM) process, followed by transient liquid phase sintering, using a mixture of Ni and Ti elemental powders. Three different powder volume fractions ranging from 65. 5 to 69. 5 vol% with a nominal Ni-Ti composition of SO. 9 at%Ni were mixed with a binder system, comprising a mainly water-soluble binder system known as polyethylene-glycol (PEG), in a new technique using a speed mixer, principally incorporating a dual asymmetric centrifuge (DAC). The powder-binder mixture was then analysed using a capillary rheometer at various temperatures and shear rates. It {{was found that the}} feedstock exhibited pseudo-plastic behaviour, which is favourable for the MIM process. A temperature range of 120 °- 130 °C was considered as the optimum operating condition for the injection moulding process. The parts were moulded into cylindrical shapes, leached in warm water (60 °C for 10 hours), thermally <b>debound</b> in argon and subsequently sintered in a vacuum furnace at different temperatures ranging from 950 °C to 1250 °C and with different holding times. The physical, thermal and mechanical behaviour of the as-sintered parts, in terms of pore morphologies, phase constituent analysis, phase transformation temperatures and load-unload compression test, were systematically investigated. The binder system used in MIM not only serves as a temporary vehicle to support the metal powder, particularly during mixing, injection and debinding, but also can act as a pore former, particularly during the water leaching and thermal debinding processes which finally facilitate the enlargement of pore channels during the subsequent sintering process. On sintering, the particles bond together first into a network, forming several inter-metallic phases such as NiTiz, NiTi, Ni 3 Ti and Ni 4 Ti 3, with fine scale porosity in that network due to Kirkendall effects. The formation of a transient liquid phase (TLP) close to the eutectic composition leads to rapid bonding. This liquid covers the surface of Ni particles by capillary force and consequently enlarges the pore channels. As the alloy homogenises, this liquid phase disappears, and asymmetric diffusion of the nickel into the titanium particle network results in swelling and macroscopic expansion of the structure. Increasing the sintering temperature and holding time enhances the inter-diffusion between the elemental powders, leading to a major fraction of the desired B 2 NiTi phase, whilst minimizing other secondary phases such as Niz Ti, Ni 3 Ti and Ni 4 Ti 3, which are known to be brittle and unresponsive to pseudo-elasticity. For all the processing conditions employed, the variation of porosity, as well as the average pore size, was very small; 3 S- 4 S% and 80 - 120 ~m, respectively. However, it seems that the use of greater powder loading (69. Svol%) and greater sintering temperature (> 10 S 0 °C) was remarkable in terms of better isotropic dimensional changes after sintering, due to greater inter-particle friction, and low impurity content, due to the smaller amount of binder used and the greater amount of transient liquid, leading to better phase homogenisation. As a result, the ductility of the porous samples was enhanced remarkably (maximum strength and strain are> 400 MPa and> 30 %, respectively), and is slightly higher than with other PM routes such as SHS and HIP techniques using a mixture of elemental Ni and Ti powders. The porous samples also exhibited a quite promising pseudo-elasticity; the elastic deformation for all samples was around 10 % strain and> 80 % unloading recovery at room temperature for the load-unload compression up to 8 % strain, and the recovery was nearly completed (< 5 % plastic strain) after the samples were heated above Aj temperature. The result is much higher than that of the conventional elastic deformation of ordinary alloys. Further, the average stiffness calculated from the stress-strain curves was around 2 - 3 GPa during loading and S- 8 OPa during unloading, very close to that of cancellous bone(< 3 GPa), which makes these alloys attractive as bone implants in biomedical applications.
