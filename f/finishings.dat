5|$|At the time, the Princess was {{considered}} a showpiece of elegance and modernity. It was the first building west of Winnipeg to be faced with marble. The Edmonton Journal remarked {{on the quality of}} the “photoplay house’s” <b>finishings,</b> remarking on the solid marble facade, frescoes, brass mirrors and the abundance of gold leaf decoration. On the technical side, two modern projectors were housed in their own fireproof machine room. The Princess was serviced by a freight elevator, which was an unusual feature for a building of its size, and the theatre lighting was indirect and gentle on theatregoers’ eyes. The Journal was also impressed by three novel firsts for a movie theatre in Edmonton: an electric ticketing machine, an “electric time-projecting clock”, and a refrigerated drinking fountain. Perhaps most importantly, the forced air ventilation system was capable of filtering, heating, and cooling air and featured dedicated intake and output fans making the Princess by far the most comfortable theatre in Edmonton.|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the present work is to improve the comfort, in {{orthopaedic}} footwear associated with orthosis, applying new materials and new finishing.

This desideratum will be reached through the selection and application of advanced materials, such, breathable membranes and fabric finished with anti-fungal and anti-bacteria treatments. In this work, midsole water release parameters were evaluated, as tensile strength, water vapour permeability, resistance of fabric to penetration by water were determined for the hydrophilic membranes. A new lining with breathable membrane and anti-odour finishing has been developed and tested. Water vapour permeability of the new lining was compared with a commercial leather lining, commercial lining with breathable membrane AquaStopT, breathable membrane and weave fabric.

Conventionally, finishing is delayed for 24 hours to one week to allow for optimal setting and ultimate strength of the cement. Forty-five recently extracted human maxillary canines were used. Teeth were divided among 3 groups: a control group (n= 15, no finishing), an immediate finishing group (n= 15, high-speed cutting of the cores performed five minutes after cementation) and a delayed finishing group (n= 15, high-speed finishing performed 48 hours post-cementation). Tensile load to failure was applied using an Instron® at a crosshead speed of 0. 05 inches/minute. A statistical test of equivalence was performed. The average retention force associated with failure after immediate finishing was {{not found to be}} inferior to delayed finishing failure force. In fact, post-hoc comparisons indicated that immediate finishing has statistically significant greater mean retentive force when compared to this force for delayed finishing at p = 0. 00001...|$|R

A frequency study was made on the internal forklift. For that we used a predefined sheet where we once a minute registered what it were doing. With a stopwatch we registered how long time the operators spend in the storage. We also did interviews with the personnel to get their opinion on these matters. The study was conducted during a four day period, where these methods were used to study the work in the factory. The result that emerged are divided after which line/function the personnel worked on. The stopwatch survey showed that the personnel on hang 1 line spend time in the storage which they don’t suppose to do, according to their work assignment.

40|$|To {{study the}} {{possibility}} of using a composite material made from palm fruit fibre and sawdust as a building material, the modulus of elasticity, fracture load and the maximum deflection of mahogany sawdust and palm fruit fibre-kotolyn veneer composites have been determined using the static bending test. The sawdust particles were sieved into different particle sizes (d) : coarse (1. 1 mm≤d≤ 4. 8 mm), medium (0. 8 mm≤d≤ 1. 1 mm) and fine (d≤ 0. 8 mm). Briquettes were made from the sawdust of approximately same particle sizes mixed with palm fibre in different weights proportions, using ‘wood’ glue as a binder. The briquettes were then sandwiched between two pieces of Kotolyn veneer to form the composites. They were then subjected to bending tests. The composite materials made from 100 wt% of coarse size sawdust recorded the highest fracture load and modulus of elasticity of 48. 00 × 102 N and 2. 23 × 106 Nm- 2, respectively. Among the composites containing both fibre and sawdust, the 90 % wt coarse size- 10 wt% fibre recorded the highest fracture load and modulus of elasticity of 30. 90 × 102 N and 1. 07 × 106 Nm- 2. Mechanical strength of the composite decreased with decreasing fibre content. The maximum deflection, however, increased with increasing fibre content.

But pray, who denies the unparalleled villainy of the papists in that bloody massacre? I have enquired, why it was not acted, and heard it was stopt by the interposition of an ambassador, who was willing to save the credit of his country, and not to have the memory of an action so barbarous revived; but that I tempted my friend to alter it, is a notorious whiggism, to save the broader word. The [...] "Sicilian Vespers" [...] I have had plotted by me above these seven years: the story of it I found under borrowed names in Giraldo Cinthio; but the rape in my tragedy of [...] "Amboyna" [...] was so like it, that I forbore the writing. But what had this to do with protestants? For the massacrers and the massacred were all papists.|$|E
