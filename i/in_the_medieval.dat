5|$|By {{the end of}} the 13th century a large prison {{had been}} built in the castle; this was {{probably}} constructed in the north-west corner of the Lower Court, overlooked by the Prison Tower.

5|$|Like {{some other}} birds, the Columbidae have no gall bladders.

In fact, however, they do have gall (as Aristotle had earlier realised), which is secreted directly into the gut.|$|E

5|$|There is {{difficulty}} in labeling the trobairitz as either amateurs or professionals.

5|$|According to {{historian}} Charles Coulson {{the accumulation}} of wealth and resources, such as food, led {{to the need for}} defensive structures. The earliest fortifications originated in the Fertile Crescent, the Indus Valley, Egypt, and China where settlements were protected by large walls. Northern Europe was slower than the East to develop defensive structures and {{it was not until the}} Bronze Age that hill forts developed and began to spread across Europe. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>medieval</b> period castles were influenced by earlier forms of elite architecture, contributing to regional variations. Importantly, while castles had military aspects, they contained a recognisable household structure within their walls, reflecting the multi-functional use of these buildings.|$|E
