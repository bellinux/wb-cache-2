5000|$|In 1977 Norman {{recorded}} Something New {{under the}} Son a blues-rock concept album that some regard as his tour de force, and as [...] "one of the roughest, bluesiest, and best {{rock and roll}} albums of his career or the whole industry", that took its title from [...] "an ironic inversion of a phrase in Ecclesiastes", namely: [...] "there is nothing new under the sun" [...] (Ecclesiastes 1:9b). While Norman explicitly denied this album was autobiographical in the accompanying lyric songbook, many years later some critics challenged this claim, arguing [...] "Norman was struggling through his own divorce and identity crisis at the time". In 1999 Norman responded by arguing that when he completed the album, he was happily married and {{that several of the}} songs were written before he had met his wife. [...] Norman indicated that the songs chronicled [...] "Pilgrims" [...] journey into faith. On this album Norman deliberately [...] "took lots of musical & lyrical parts from old blues songs and from Bob Dylan songs". Norman acknowledged a deliberate similarity between his Something New Under the Son and Bob Dylans 1965 album Bringing It All Back Home, including a deliberate endeavor to replicate Bringing It All Back Homes iconic album cover on the inner sleeve of the original Something New Under the Son LP album. Jesus Music historian David Di Sabatino described the album as [...] "Musically reminiscent of The Rolling Stones Exile on Main Street (1972) .... The albums artwork is an excellent attempt to parallel Bob Dylans Bringing It All Back Home (1966). [...] "Nightmare #97" [...] makes excellent use of Stagger Lee intro (cf. [...] "Bob Dylans 115th Dream"). With the song [...] "Let That Tape Keep Rolling" [...] Norman pays homage to Mick Jagger and Van Morrison. Norman explained the philosophy behind this album:The album is called Something New Under the Son. Well my music is not new. [...] "Theres nothing new under the sun", Solomon said and my album is not new. Im not trying to say that my album is new under the sun but <b>Im</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> say that we are something new under the Son. When were born again were a new creature and old things pass away, so on my album I wanted to put some remnants from the past. There are little bits and pieces in the music that some people might recognise have been on other albums before. Just a word there, a little sentence or some musical riff or lick {{and a lot of people}} have figured out what they are and when you listen to it you say [...] "wait a minute, I think Ive heard that before!"

5000|$|There was a brawl on pit road {{involving}} Jeff Gordon, Brad Keselowski and Kevin Harvick. Keselowski and Harvick {{were parked}} in the post-race impound area where the cars that finished second through sixth are held for post-race inspection. Gordon pulled his car and parked it right beside Brads car. He got out and had a level-headed conversation with {{the driver of the}} No. 2 Ford that seemed to make him more angry. As Keselowski was putting on his Miller Lite cap, Kevin proceeded to shove him towards Gordon and all hell broke loose. Multiple pit crews from the three racing stables as well as Paul Menards crew were involved (Keselowskis spot in the impound area was in the pit stall of the No. 27 car). ESPNs Jamie Little was {{caught in the middle of}} it. “We’re racing for the win,” said Keselowski of the on track contact. “trying to wreck him, just racing hard. He left a hole and you know, everything you watch in racing, you leave a hole, you’re supposed to go for it. It closed back up and we made contact. I don’t want to ruin anyone’s day. I want to win the race and that was our opportunity. Just didn’t come together.” “I spun the tires a little bit but I got a pretty decent start and we went down into one and I just wanted to get to the outside of the 48 Johnson and out of nowhere, I got slammed by the 2 and it cut my left rear tire. Hes just a dipshit," [...] Gordon said in a nationally televised interview on ESPN. [...] "I dont know how hes ever won a championship. Im just sick and tired of him. ... That was a huge race for us. Im proud of Jimmie Johnson for winning that race. I didnt want that you-know-what (Keselowski) to win that race. ... (Keselowski) gets himself in this position himself and as far as Im concerned hes got to pay the consequences. … Its total crap. The kid is just doing stuff way over his head." [...] “Im not trying to sit here and sugarcoat it and try to be The Intimidator,’’ Keselowski said. “Thats not what <b>Im</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> say. My expectation is if theres a gap, theyll go for it. If theres a gap, Ill go for it. If it closes up, theres contact, then thats racing. And thats what happened today. Will those guys race me hard or harder than others? Absolutely, Im certain they will. But thats just part of it. I cant fault them for that. I just feel like I have to go for the gap if its there, and I have to race the way I race or I wont even be in NASCAR. Id rather have enemies in NASCAR than have friends and be sitting at home.’’ “If you’re going to drive like that, you better be willing to fight,’’ Harvick said he told Keselowski. “He was going to stand behind his guys. Jeff Gordon deserved to at least have a face-to-face conversation with him. I wasn’t standing up for anybody. (Keselowski) just ran over (Gordon). He was standing back behind all his guys, not wanting to defend what he did. I said, ‘You’re the problem, get in your own fight.’ ‘’ Robin Pemberton, NASCARs senior vice president of competition, said that series officials will review what took place to determine what, if any, penalties will be issued. “Holding onto each other and grabbing… thats one thing. When punches are landed, its a different scenario," [...] Pemberton said.|$|E

McCartney originally played his guitar part slower and in a lower key, which West later speeded up for the finished release, thus causing McCartneys voice to sound much higher than its normal tone.

40|$|This article takes a constructivist {{approach}} {{to explain the}} complicated political actions taken by the Ecuadorian Highland Indigenous Movement (IM) under a democratic regime since 1979. The characteristics of IM’s political actions can be summarized in three points. Firstly, IM {{did not intend to}} take political power in the 1980 s. Secondly, the first action IM took to come into power was extra-legal: creating the Indigenous-Popular Congress (IPC) which was expected to substitute the legislature in 1991. Finally, since 1996, IM has participated in elections without giving up extra-legal actions which appeared in 1997 and 2000. The constructivist approach focuses on the process how IM shaped its norms which set standards of behavior and works better than the earlier literatures’ hypotheses. // Since its foundation in the early 1970 s, IM was worried that once it got involved in party politics in which socially dominant whites ruled, the movement would be manipulated and would eventually disintegrate. This is why <b>IM</b> did not <b>try</b> <b>to</b> reach political power via elections in the 1980 s and firstly developed its norm which justified boycotting national elections and establishing IPC as a parallel legislature body. // In the 1992 election, indigenous electorates went to vote, which meant the boycott failed. From this experience IM accepted the electoral way to reach political power, but maintained the plan to construct IPC. While situating the election as short-term strategy, it redefined creating IPC as long-term one. In this way IM made normative ground to support legal and extra-legal actions simultaneously...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{presents the}} results of the Spent Nuclear Fuel Project (SNFP) Information Management Planning Project (IMPP), a short-term project that identified information management (IM) issues and opportunities within the SNFP and outlined a high-level plan to address them. This high-level plan for the SNMFP IM focuses on specific examples from within the SNFP. The plan`s recommendations can be characterized in several ways. Some recommendations address specific challenges that the SNFP faces. Others form the basis for making smooth transitions in several important IM areas. Still others identify areas where further study and planning are indicated. The team`s knowledge of developments in the IM industry and at the Hanford Site were crucial in deciding where to recommend that the SNFP act and where they should wait for Site plans to be made. Because of the fast pace of the SNFP and demands on SNFP staff, input and interaction were primarily between the IMPP team and members of the SNFP Information Management Steering Committee (IMSC). Key input to the IMPP came from a workshop where IMSC members and their delegates developed a set of draft IM principles. These principles, described in Section 2, became the foundation for the recommendations found in the transition plan outlined in Section 5. Availability of SNFP staff was limited, so project documents were used as a basis for much of the work. The team, realizing that the status of the project and the environment are continually changing, <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> keep abreast of major developments since those documents were generated. To the extent possible, the information contained in this document is current as of the end of fiscal year (FY) 1995. Programs and organizations on the Hanford Site as a whole are <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> maximize their return on IM investments. They are coordinating <b>IM</b> activities and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> leverage existing capabilities. However, the SNFP cannot just rely on Sitewide activities to meet its IM requirements.
