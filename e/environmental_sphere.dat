5000|$|The technocratic, [...] "post-democratic" [...] {{tendency}} {{ushered in}} with the neoliberal transition towards governance-beyond-the-state (henceforth governance) has therefore been reinforced by consensus politics. And as the <b>environmental</b> <b>sphere</b> has been a particularly privileged site for experimentation in neoliberal governance, so too is it particularly vulnerable to the post-political tendency. The neoliberal shift in environmental policy implementation was signalled in the 1990s by the growing influence of New Public Management (NPM) and increasing preference for new environmental policy instruments (NEPIs). Meanwhile, one need only point to the predominance of quantitative measures such as Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) or the vast regulatory apparatuses associated with the new and burgeoning carbon markets as evidence of what Mitchell Dean has labelled [...] "post-democratic" [...] concern with metricisation, accountancy, auditing and benchmarking.|$|E

5000|$|Governance makes {{problematic}} state-centric {{notions of}} regulation, recognising {{that there has}} been a shift to power operating across several spatial scales. Similarly, counter-mapping problematises state distribution of cartography, advocating bottom-up participatory mapping projects (see GIS and environmental governance). Counter-mapping initiatives, often without state assistance, attempt to exert power. As such, counter-mapping conforms to Jessop's notion of [...] "governance without government". Another characteristic of governance is its [...] "purposeful effort to steer, control or manage sectors or facets of society" [...] towards a common goal. Likewise, as maps exude power and authority, they are a trusted medium with the ability to 'steer' society in a particular direction. In brief, cartography, once the tool of kings and governments, is now being used as a tool of governance - to advocate policy change from the grassroots. The <b>environmental</b> <b>sphere</b> is one context in which counter-mapping has been utilised as a governance tool.|$|E
5000|$|This {{trend is}} {{particularly}} {{visible in the}} <b>environmental</b> <b>sphere.</b> According to Gert Goeminne and Karen François, more concerning still than the increasing [...] "colonisation" [...] of this sphere by science {{is that it is}} a radically depoliticised version of science that is doing the colonising. Drawing heavily from Bruno Latour, Goeminne and François' work serves to problematise the representational work done by science: science is neither a neutral conductor of material reality that produces “facts”, nor should its legitimacy to speak on behalf of nature escape scrutiny. By contrast, ‘…the fact-value divide of the Modern Constitution acts to obscure the work of composition that goes into the construction of a matter of fact’, thus giving way to the post-political configuration, in which politics is reduced to 'the administration and management of processes whose parameters are defined by consensual socio-scientific knowledges'. In environmental politics, then, 'disagreement is allowed, but only with respect to the choice of technologies, the mix of organisational fixes, the details of the managerial adjustments, and the urgency of the timing and implementation'. Regarding global climate adaptation and mitigation, that debate over climate scientists' varying interpretations of crucial tipping points diverts attention from questions of [...] "climate justice" [...] is a case in point.|$|E

The sustainability of the way fossils are treated at the sites is examined, compared and discussed.

Sutherland, like most small rural towns in the Central and Western Karoo, is/was {{in the process of}} decline. Rural tourism is seen as a solution to curb the process of decline. The study investigates this assumption by analyzing the positive and negative impacts of tourism on the economic, social and <b>environmental</b> <b>spheres</b> of Sutherland and looks at concomitant structural changes. Special emphasis is placed on the changing nature of Sutherland’s reason for existence and the dualistic processes of degradation on the one side and tourism development on the other.

40|$|The Tlingit Aboriginal tourism {{enterprise}} named Icy Strait Point in Hoonah, Southeast Alaska {{is used as}} a {{case study}} to develop the new concept of Sustainable Social-Environmental Enterprise (SSEE). SSEE is defined as an innovative enterprise that has dynamic operational strategies while still maintaining its corporate core values and integrating social, environmental, cultural, economic and political (SECEP) sustainabilities in its operations. The SSEE framework assesses enterprises according to five domains of sustainability: social, environmental, cultural, economic, and political. Applying this framework, we find that while social, economic, and cultural sustainability goals have been achieved in a relatively short time by the Aboriginal tourism enterprise in Hoonah, the political and <b>environmental</b> <b>spheres</b> of sustainability are constrained by the dominant influence of the multinational cruise ship industr y over tourism development. Thus, for an emerging tourism enterprise to be sustainable, we suggest each of these livelihood dimensions needs to achieve "a safe operating space" that is adaptable over time and to changing social and environmental circumstances...|$|R

Indeed, competition with China for bluestone products and with India for sandstone pavement is very important due the fact of the very competitive prices for foreign products.

Stakeholders' positions on the role that GMOs play in trends of the state of agriculture and environment in Catalonia are analysed. The application of the Driving forces -Pressures - State - Impact - Responses (DPSIR) framework in this case study highlights its potential for organising and structuring information. However, the model can be ambiguous when used as an analytical tool in value-laden complex situations. Thus, GM agriculture is sometimes seen as a pressure on the agro-environment and sometimes as a modernising response to an economic and environmental crisis. A redefinition of the DPSIR categories is proposed, aiming to reflect on these situations by better acknowledging different legitimate perspectives and narratives.
