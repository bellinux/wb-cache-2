The objectives of this research are, firstly, to identify the projection of work safety and health implementation program in PT. PJB UP BRANTAS. Secondly, to identify the employees’ work productivity level in PT. PJB UP BRANTAS, third, to identify {{whether there is a}} relationship between the implementation of work safety and health program against employees’ work productivity, fourth, to identify the most influencing work safety and <b>health</b> <b>variable</b> against work productivity variable. In this research, the author sets two hypotheses. First, it is assumed that there is a significant influence between the implementation of work safety and health program on employees’ work productivity in operational and maintenance division of PT. PJB UP BRANTAS. Second, it is assumed that work safety variables are more influencing than employees’ work productivity variables. Analysis tools which used in this research are including scale range and multiple linear regression. Based on the result of scale range analysis we can see that the average score for work safety implementation variable is 97. 5 and for the work <b>health</b> implementation <b>variable</b> is 87. 3. Thus, we can conclude that the implementation of work safety and health program in PT. PJB UP BRANTAS can be categorized as good, and the average score for work productivity variable is 72. 3, so we can conclude that work productivity in PT. PJB UP BRANTAS can be categorized as high. On simultaneous test that we performed by using F test, we can conclude that the F count 23. 951 is larger than F table of 3. 354, which means that the implementation of work safety and <b>health</b> <b>variable</b> has significant influence on employees’ work productivity level in operational and maintenance division of PT. PJB UP BRANTAS. Based on multiple linear regression test we can see that work safety variable has score of 0. 622 and work <b>health</b> <b>variable</b> has score of 0. 382, which means that both work safety and <b>health</b> <b>variable</b> has a significant influence on work productivity.

Regarding the short-term and long- term complications as well as expensive costs of this disease, the present study aimed to determine the life quality of these patients compared to non-diabetic people and ultimately, a structural model was presented. methods: This analytical study was carried out on 250 diabetic and 250 non-diabetic patients in Yazd. The standard life quality questionnaire (whoqol-bref) was utilized as the data collection tool containing a total of 26 questions and 4 domains of physical health, mental health, social health and environmental health. The study data were analyzed using SPSS software (ver. 16) and Amos(21). Results: The study results demonstrated a significant difference between life quality of diabetic patients and healthy subjects (p< 0. 001), and the mean score of all the different domains of questionnaire proved to be lower in patients than healthy subjects. Path coefficients in the structural equation model proved to be significant (p< 0. 001).

DESIGN [...] Regional health authorities were ranked according to each of the HLS <b>health</b> <b>variables</b> which varied significantly between authorities. The HLS <b>health</b> <b>variables</b> were regressed on a selection from the range of routinely available morbidity and socioeconomic indicators available from the 1981 census.

40|$|ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE To analyze if {{demographic}} and socioeconomic factors and {{factors related to}} health and health services are associated with frailty in community-dwelling older adults. METHODS This is a cross-sectional study with 339 older adults (60 years old or more) living in Juiz de Fora, State of Minas Gerais, Brazil, in 2015. A household survey was carried out and frailty was evaluated using the Edmonton Frail Scale. For {{the analysis of the}} factors associated with outcome, a theoretical model of determination was constructed with three hierarchical blocks: block 1 with {{demographic and}} socioeconomic characteristics, block 2 with the health of the older adult (divided into three sub-levels: 2. 1 self-reported <b>health</b> <b>variables,</b> 2. 2 self-perceived <b>health</b> <b>variables,</b> and 2. 3 geriatric syndromes), and block 3 with characteristics related to health services. The variables were adjusted in relation to each other within each block; those with significance level ≤ 0. 20 were included in the Poisson regression model and adjusted to a higher level, considering a level of significance of 5 %. RESULTS The prevalence of frailty among older adults was 35. 7 % (95 %CI 30. 7 – 40. 9). Of the total, 42. 2 % did not present frailty; 22. 1 % were apparently vulnerable. Among the frail ones, 52. 9 % presented mild frailty, 32. 2 % moderate frailty, and 14. 9 % severe frailty. Frailty was associated with difficulty walking, need for an auxiliary device to walk, presence of caregiver, depressive disorders, and functional dependence to perform instrumental activities of daily living.
