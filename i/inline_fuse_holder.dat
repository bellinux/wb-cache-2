50|$|Automotive fuses {{are used}} to protect the wiring and {{electrical}} equipment for vehicles. There are several different types of automotive fuses and their usage is dependent upon the specific application, voltage, and current demands of the electrical circuit. Automotive fuses can be mounted in <b>fuse</b> blocks, <b>inline</b> <b>fuse</b> <b>holders,</b> or <b>fuse</b> clips. Some automotive fuses are occasionally used in non-automotive electrical applications. Standards for automotive fuses are published by SAE International (formerly known as the Society of Automotive Engineers).|$|R
50|$|Cutouts are {{typically}} mounted about 20 degrees off vertical {{so that the}} center of gravity of the <b>fuse</b> <b>holder</b> is displaced and the <b>fuse</b> <b>holder</b> will rotate and fall open under its own weight when the fuse blows. Mechanical tension on the fuse link normally holds an ejector spring in a stable position. When the fuse blows, the released spring pulls the stub of the fuse link out of the <b>fuse</b> <b>holder</b> tube to reduce surge duration and damage to the transformer and <b>fuse</b> <b>holder.</b> This quenches any arc in the <b>fuse</b> <b>holder.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>fuse</b> <b>holder</b> may be {{replaced}} by a solid blade, which would allow the <b>fuse</b> <b>holder</b> assembly {{to be used as a}} switch only.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>fuse</b> <b>holder,</b> {{also called}} the [...] "fuse tube" [...] or [...] "door", an {{insulating}} tube which contains the replaceable fuse element. When the contained fuse melts ("blows"), the <b>fuse</b> <b>holder</b> drops out of the upper contact, breaking the circuit, and hangs from a hinge on its lower end. This hanging <b>fuse</b> <b>holder</b> provides a visible indication that the fuse has operated and assurance that the circuit is open. The circuit can also be opened manually by pulling out the <b>fuse</b> <b>holder</b> using a hot stick.|$|R

40|$|Circuit breakers, {{disconnectors}}, fuse disconnectors and <b>fuse</b> <b>holders</b> {{installed in}} LV electric panels sometimes suffer overheating, mainly due to inadequate dissipation {{of the heat}} generated. A theoretical and experimental investigation is attempted of the mechanisms that can affect heat transfer to a component-conductor system, as well the mass and the external surface area of the component. The resulting system of differential equations is solved using the Laplace transform in the s-plane. The time-dependent temperature distribution in the component-conductor system is provided by an analytical expression, and a simple formula is given for the component's stabilised temperature. Results from the models are compared with experimental measurements performed on a <b>fuse</b> <b>holder</b> and are shown to be consistent. The model accuracy is also investigated. It is convincingly shown that excessive (or additional) external surface area of the component's metallic parts reduces the component temperature. Above a certain level, this can make the component act as a cooler of the conductor. In addition, an increase of the component's mass slows temperature stabilisation. The proposed model could effectively support component design as it involves all the technical characteristics of the system, so that the requirements of international standards are fulfilled {{in relation to the}} prevention of overheating. © IEE, 2005...|$|R
50|$|The <b>fuse</b> <b>holder</b> on a cutout {{can also}} be {{replaced}} with a mechanism designed {{to function as a}} sectionalizer, to be used on a distribution line downstream from autoreclosing circuit breakers. Autoreclosers sense and briefly interrupt fault currents, and then automatically reclose to restore service. Meanwhile, downstream sectionalizers automatically count current interruptions by the recloser. When a sectionalizer detects a preset number of interruptions of fault current (typically 3 or 4) the sectionalizer opens (while unenergized) and remains open, and the recloser restores supply to the other non-fault sections.|$|R
50|$|The mine {{consisted}} of a large cylindrical main body containing a 60 mm mortar shell linked by a steel tube to a <b>fuse</b> <b>holder</b> which held either a pressure fuse or a pull fuse for use with tripwires. A rectangular thin metal plate positioned halfway up {{the main body of}} the mine provides additional support. When the fuse is triggered, a flash travels along the steel tube to the base of the main body, where it ignites a 0.8 g black powder charge, launching the mortar shell from the mine and igniting a pyrotechnic delay.|$|R
5000|$|Each <b>fuse</b> <b>holder</b> {{typically}} has an attached {{pull ring}} {{that can be}} engaged by a hook {{at the end of}} a fiberglass hot stick operated by a lineworker standing on the ground or from a bucket truck, to manually open the switch. While often used for switching, the standard cutout shown is not designed to be manually opened under load. For applications where the switch is likely to be used to interrupt power manually, a [...] "load break" [...] version is available that has an attachment to quench the arc.|$|R
5000|$|The larger end cap (the [...] "bottom" [...] of the bottle) has at its centre a small {{spring-loaded}} button {{retained by}} a thin wire, {{which serves as a}} [...] "fuse blown" [...] indicator. When the fuse blows, the wire breaks and the indicator button is ejected by the spring. A missing or displaced indicator thus pinpoints a blown fuse. The removable part of the <b>fuse</b> <b>holder</b> has a small window to allow inspection of the indicator without removal of the fuse. The indicator button usually has a coloured dot indicating the fuse rating (see table).|$|R
5000|$|The {{smaller end}} cap (the [...] "top" [...] of the bottle) has a {{diameter}} that {{varies with the}} fuse rating: higher ratings have wider end caps. The fixed part of the <b>fuse</b> <b>holder</b> contains a (usually colour-coded) gauge ring, which will accept end caps {{up to a certain}} diameter. It is therefore not possible to fit a fuse of a higher rating than allowed for by the gauge ring. The size of the gauge ring is determined by the current rating of the circuit to be protected. Gauge rings are intended to be changed only by authorized personnel.|$|R
50|$|Some {{manufacturers}} commonly design higher joule-rated surge protectors {{by connecting}} multiple MOVs in parallel. Since individual MOVs have slightly different non-linear responses {{when exposed to}} the same overvoltage, any given MOV might be more sensitive than others. This can cause one MOV in a group to conduct more (a phenomenon called current hogging), leading to overuse and eventually premature failure of that component. If a single <b>inline</b> <b>fuse</b> is placed in series with the MOVs as a power-off safety feature, it will open and fail the surge protector even if remaining MOVs are intact. Thus, the effective surge energy absorption capacity of the entire system {{is dependent on the}} MOV with the lowest clamping voltage and the additional MOVs do not provide any further benefit. This limitation can be surmounted by using carefully matched sets of MOVs, but this matching must be carefully coordinated with the original manufacturer of the MOV components.|$|R
5000|$|In {{peaceful}} situations {{one would}} want equipment {{to shut down}} {{so it is not}} damaged. In a battle or emergency, where the survival of the vessel (or other protected asset) is dependent upon the continued operation of the equipment, it is sometimes wiser to risk equipment damage than have the equipment shut down when it is needed. For example, the electrical drives to elevate and traverse the guns of a combat warship may have [...] "battleshort" [...] fuses, which are simply copper bars of the correct size to fit the <b>fuse</b> <b>holders,</b> as failure to return fire in a combat situation may cause loss of the ship and crew and damaging or overheating of the electrical motors is a preferable alternative.|$|R

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] In electric utility, overcurrent and overvoltage transients in switching operations often cause severe damage on the power system equipments. In this study, Alternative Transients Program -Electromagnetic Transients Program (ATP-EMTP) was employed for a general utility system modeling. A certain 161 kV: 34. 5 kV Ameren UE substation in the Potosi area was discussed. The system consisting of the generators, the transformers, the switches, a circuit breaker, a capacitor bank, a <b>fuse</b> <b>holder,</b> the transmission lines, the cables and the loads is modeled by means of provided measured data. Some non-ideal components are modeled and explained in detail in order to explain some possible complex transient behavior including inrush current, harmonic resonance, ferroresonance, reignition of the circuit breaker and other high frequency resonance effects. In the particular system, failure of a 4. 5 MVAR capacitor bank happened due to an improper switching operation. The simulation results for the capacitor bank phase currents and voltages suggest that excessive switching transients due to inrush current, associated with energizing an idle transformer; oscillatory transients involving the transformer and cable parasitic capacitances upon closure of the circuit breaker; and reignition associated with a wrong circuit breaker closing followed by the opening command by protections {{may play a role in}} the failure of the <b>fuse</b> <b>holder</b> and capacitor bank...|$|R
2500|$|In North America, fuses {{were used}} in {{buildings}} wired before 1960. These Edison base fuses would screw into a fuse socket similar to Edison-base incandescent lamps. [...] Ratings were 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 amperes. To prevent installation of fuses with an excessive current rating, later fuse boxes included rejection features in the fuse-holder socket, commonly known as Rejection Base (Type S fuses) which have smaller diameters that {{vary depending on the}} rating of the fuse. This means that fuses can only be replaced by the preset (Type S) fuse rating. This is a North American, tri-national standard (UL 4248-11; CAN/CSA-C22.2 NO. 4248.11-07 (R2012); and, NMX-J-009/4248/11-ANCE). Existing Edison fuse boards can easily be converted to only accept Rejection Base (Type S) fuses, by screwing-in a tamper-proof adapter. [...] This adapter screws into the existing Edison <b>fuse</b> <b>holder,</b> and has a smaller diameter threaded hole to accept the designated Type S rated fuse.|$|R
50|$|Bad {{contacts}} are {{the cause}} of failure or poor performance {{in a wide variety}} of electrical devices. For example, corroded jumper cable clamps can frustrate attempts to start a vehicle that has a low battery. Dirty or corroded contacts on a <b>fuse</b> or its <b>holder</b> can give the false impression that the fuse is blown. A sufficiently high contact resistance can cause substantial heating in a high current device. Unpredictable or noisy contacts are a major cause of the failure of electrical equipment.|$|R
