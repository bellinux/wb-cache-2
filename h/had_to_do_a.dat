5|$|Fifteen {{years after}} its last album, in November 2008, Guns N' Roses {{released}} Chinese Democracy exclusively via the electronics retailer Best Buy. Rose did {{not contribute to the}} album's promotion; by December, he had reportedly been missing for at least two months and had not returned phone calls or other requests from his record label. In a subsequent interview, Rose stated that he felt he had not received the necessary support from Interscope Records. A year after the album's release, in December 2009, Guns N' Roses embarked on another two-and-a-half years of touring, including a headlining performance at Rock in Rio 4. Rose was subsequently sued by former band manager Irving Azoff, who sought $1.87million in unpaid fees related to the tour. In a countersuit, Rose alleged Azoff had deliberately mismanaged the band and their album's promotion to force him to join his former bandmates for a reunion tour. Both cases were settled. According to Rose in 2011, part of the settlement agreement dictated that Rose and the current Guns N' Roses <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> number of performances with Azoff's company Live Nation as the promoter.|$|E
25|$|When Botvinnik {{finished}} the school curriculum, he was below the minimum age for the entrance examinations for higher education. While waiting, he qualified {{for his first}} USSR Championship final stage in 1927 as the youngest player ever at that time, tied for fifth place and won the title of National Master. He wanted to study Electrical Technology at the Leningrad Polytechnical Institute and passed the entrance examination; however, there was a persistent excess of applications for this course and the Proletstud, which controlled admissions, had a policy of admitting only children of engineers and industrial workers. After an appeal by a local chess official, he was admitted in 1928 to Leningrad University's Mathematics Department. In January 1929, Botvinnik played for Leningrad in the student team chess championship against Moscow. Leningrad won and the team manager, who was also Deputy Chairman of the Proletstud, secured Botvinnik a transfer to the Polytechnic's Electromechanical Department, where {{he was one of}} only four students who entered straight from school. As a result, he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> whole year's work in five months, and failed one of the examinations. Early in the same year he placed joint third in the semi-final stage of the USSR Championship, and thus failed to reach the final stage.|$|E

500|$|For the CGI used {{throughout}} the film, companies Rhythm & Hues (R) and Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) developed {{different parts of the}} film. R focused on the animation of the animals, while ILM completed the final scene of the ark rushing through Washington D.C. Lindy De Quattro, the ILM associate visual effects supervisor, revealed that [...] "This is the first time where we <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> whole series of shots that were happening mid-day, where {{you were going to get}} a really long look at the water and what it was doing." [...] The company initially experienced problems creating the water effects and had to develop new tools which would choreograph the movements of the water. In addition, ILM used similar tools that were used on their prior film Poseidon. Lighting was also an issue as the characters on the ark had been filmed on a greenscreen stage, and the visual effects company had to ensure that the lighting matched that of the characters and the outside setting. Details were added to the ark for long-distance shots to make the design of the ark more appealing and relate the ark's size to scale in comparison to the amount of water. To complete the scene, ILM used thirty to sixty crew members and produced 200 shots over a yearlong period between April 2006 and May 2007.|$|E

500|$|Another VFX {{supervisor}} from Zoic Studios, Andrew Orloff, {{believed the}} episode's special effects were {{possibly the most}} difficult of the season. He wrote, [...] "Originally, {{it was supposed to be}} a practical effect but they couldn't get it to fall in a natural way, so what we had to do was shoot the practical elements in pieces and we put them all together and timed all those plates and ended up rebuilding a significant part of it and tying it all together in CG. So we took a cyberscan of the guy's body, and on top of all the practical elements we used as a base, we had a matte painting, a reveal matte painting of the cracks that ran through the body, 3D particles of large chunks of ash falling out, 3D particles of small ash bits floating down, residual dust flying off of it and, at one point, his head falls off and crashes to the ground as ash. So we <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> full-CG head and tumble it down the body. That was pretty complicated and entailed lots of R there was 2D work in After Effects, tracking, retiming, we did a lot of CG lighting for the body parts in Maya/mental ray and all of the particles were a combination of Maya software, and rendered in Maya/mental ray." ...|$|E
500|$|Conrad {{first met}} MacFarlane while {{recording}} a [...] clip {{for the season}} five episode [...] "Prick Up Your Ears".

In an interview with People, she revealed that she has no plans on getting into acting, and even calls herself an [...] "awful actor" [...] and admits that she cannot memorize lines. However, she enjoyed recording for this episode and hired an acting coach to help her get through the lines. Even though she enjoyed the experience, she said that [...] " [...] not really something I'm interested in." [...] She <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> lot of research before recording, because [...] "there {{were a lot of}} facts and a lot of big words" [...] and she [...] "had to say it as if it was coming to [...] very easily."

500|$|The {{development}} {{team for}} Mega Man consisted of only six people. Inafune (credited as [...] "Inafuking") designed and illustrated {{nearly all of}} the game's characters and enemies, as well as the Japanese Rockman logo, box art, and instruction manual. He was also responsible for rendering these designs into graphical sprite form. [...] "We didn’t have [...] people, so after drawing character designs, I was actually doing the dotting (pixelation) for the Nintendo," [...] Inafune stated. [...] "Back then, people weren’t specialized and we <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> lot of different things because there was so few people, so I really ended up doing all the characters." [...] Inafune was influenced by the eponymous protagonist of Osamu Tezuka's manga Astro Boy in his Mega Man designs. Mega Man is colored blue due to the NES console's technical limitations: the color has the most shades in the console's limited 56-color palette, and the expanded selection was used to enhance Mega Man's detail. Although he is often credited for designing the character, Inafune insists that he [...] "only did half of the job in creating him", as his mentor developed the basic character concept before Inafune's arrival. The basic sprites for Roll and Dr. Light were created before Inafune joined the project, and the designs for Cut Man, Ice Man, Fire Man, and Guts Man were in process. Aside from normal enemies, Inafune's first character was Elec Man, inspired by American comic book characters. The artist has commented that Elec Man has always been his favorite design. The designs for Dr. Light and Dr. Wily were based on Santa Claus and Albert Einstein, respectively; the latter character was meant to represent an archetypal [...] "mad scientist".|$|E

500|$|After the film's {{release and}} unusually strong box office {{performance}} over {{its first two}} weeks, it was debated as the one film capable of surpassing Titanics worldwide gross, and its continued strength perplexed box office analysts. Other films in recent years had been cited as contenders for surpassing Titanic, such as 2008's The Dark Knight, but Avatar was considered the first film with a genuine chance to do so, and its numbers being aided by higher ticket prices for 3D screenings did not fully explain its success to box office analysts. [...] "Most films {{are considered to be}} healthy if they manage anything less than a 50% drop from their first weekend to their second. Dipping just 11% from the first to the third is unheard of," [...] said Paul Dergarabedian, president of box-office analysis for Hollywood.com. [...] "This is just unprecedented. I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> double take. I thought it was a miscalculation." [...] Analysts predicted second place for the film's worldwide gross, but most were uncertain about it surpassing Titanic because [...] "Today's films flame out much faster than they did when Titanic was released." [...] Brandon Gray, president of Box Office Mojo, believed in the film's chances of becoming the highest-grossing film of all time, though he also believed it was too early to surmise because it had only played during the holidays. He said, [...] "While Avatar may beat Titanics record, it will be tough, and the film is unlikely to surpass Titanic in attendance. Ticket prices were about $3 cheaper in the late 1990s." [...] Cameron said he did not think it was realistic to [...] "try to topple Titanic off its perch" [...] because it [...] "just struck some kind of chord" [...] and there had been other good films in recent years. He changed his prediction by mid-January. [...] "It's gonna happen. It's just a matter of time," [...] he said.|$|E
500|$|The Wellingtons dug in at {{the centre}} of the position, with the Aucklands on their right and the Canterburys on the left. The {{expected}} counter-attack started at 05:00 with an artillery bombardment. As the Turkish troop approached the brigade lines, at 09:20 an order to withdraw was given. As the regiment, the Canterburys and the cameliers started to retire, it allowed the Turks to reach the crest of Hill 3039. It was then realised the order was mistaken, and the brigade officers rallied their man and charged back, forcing the Turks back down the hill. Further Turkish counter-attacks continued throughout the day, and at 16:00 a troop from the 9th Squadron on the right flank, when the Turkish got close to their lines, <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> counter-attack of their own. By now it was appreciated that the division could not achieve their objectives, and a withdrawal back towards the Jordan river was ordered. By 22:30 the wounded had been evacuated and the regiment pulled back unopposed, reaching Ain Es Sir at 04:00 the next day. Turkish troops then closed on their position, but that evening the 6th Squadron rejoined the regiment. A line of observation posts were then established to monitor the approaching Turks. The regiment made plans to hold them off until the division passed through the village, and then withdraw back across the river. At 03:45 on 1 April, the 2nd Squadron formed a skirmish line to the north of Ain Es Sir, the 9th Squadron another line to the south-east, while the 6th Squadron were the reserve. By 07:00 the brigade, bringing up the rear, reached the village. Once they had passed them the 6th Squadron joined the end of the line. At 07:45 the 2nd Squadron opened fire on Turkish troops coming from the north, while the 9th Squadron withdrew, followed soon after by the 2nd Squadron. As they entered the village, enemy troops in the hills opened fire on them. The squadron immediately counter-attacked, supported by two troops from the 9th Squadron. The remainder of the regiment stopped [...] to the south, forming a defensive line. The Turkish troops in the hills were soon dealt with by the 2nd Squadron, and as they withdrew, the regiment was able to provide covering fire. Finally, just after 20:00, they arrived back at Shunet Nimrin, and camped for the night. Their casualties during the raid were fourteen dead and eight wounded.
