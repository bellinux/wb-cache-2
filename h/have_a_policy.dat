Some health care organizations may <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>policy</b> regarding the disclosure of unanticipated events. The amount of information presented to those affected {{is dependent on the}} family's readiness and the organization's culture. The employee disclosing the event to family requires support from risk management, patient safety officers and senior leadership. Disclosures are objectively documented in the medical record.|$|E
25|$|Political party {{candidates}} were selected within party elections, or were elected by party bodies, {{and they are}} the party's sole official candidates. All parliamentary parties <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>policy</b> to support only one candidate, and if their member announces an independent nomination, he or she automatically loses their party membership. Parliamentary parties that do not candidate their member for the president, usually publicly support someone. These parties can be listed on the electoral list for the president, but sometimes their support is just a public endorsement. Regional-right wing HDSSB supported independent candidate Milan Bandić, and regional-centrist PGS supported independent Nadan Vidošević.|$|E
25|$|As President Bush's AIDS Coordinator, Tobias was {{responsible}} for setting policy detailing which countries would receive monies from various US agencies, how much, and what the rules governing assignment of those funds would be. As AIDS Coordinator, he discussed the rules {{in an interview with}} PBS' Frontline where he detailed a legal requirement that recipients of U.S. aid denounce prostitution:The Congress I think very appropriately has put into the legislation that created this program that organizations, in order to receive money, need to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>policy</b> opposed to prostitution and sex trafficking. I don't think it's too difficult for people to be opposed to prostitution and sex trafficking, which are in fact two contributing causes to the spread of HIV/AIDS. I think when organizations initially became aware of that requirement, some organizations were concerned about what the implications of that might be, but we implemented that in the first year with non-U.S. organizations. We're now implementing that requirement with U.S. organizations. And so far, I really know of no problems that we've had on the ground.|$|E

25|$|The {{history of}} Pakistani {{interest}} into nuclear science {{goes back to}} late 1948 when {{a large number of}} scientists, mathematicians, chemists, and physicists moved to Pakistan from India on the request of Prime minister Liaqat Ali Khan. The research in nuclear technology was encouraged by Mark Oliphant who, in 1948, wrote a letter to Muhammad Ali Jinnah to engage research in the peaceful use of nuclear technology. According to Mark Oliphant, no other Muslim scientist was available in the South Asia other than Rafi Muhammad Chaudhry, who could prove useful for the newly independent country in the field of nuclear technology. A letter was directed to Chaudhry, who migrated to Pakistan in 1948 and established High-Tension Laboratory in 1952. On 8 December 1953, US President Dwight Eisenhower launched the Atoms for Peace program, where Pakistan {{was one of the first}} countries to sign the treaty. On 8 December 1953, the Pakistani media welcomed the proposed peaceful use of atomic energy, but Foreign minister Sir Zaf-rulla Khan stated that Pakistan did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>policy</b> towards the atom bomb. In 1956, Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) was founded and its first chairman was Nazir Ahmad, and Science Advisor to the Prime minister, Salimuzzaman Siddiqui served agency's first Technical (member). In 1958, the PAEC drafted a proposal to the military government of Field Marshal Ayub Khan for the acquisition of either the Canadian NRX heavy water reactor or the CP-5 reactor, at the Argonne National Laboratory. However, Ayub Khan's military government vetoed the proposal.|$|E

The parties show similarities with ones in the dark culture, being based on {{a more or less}} strictly enforced dress code; most often clothing made of latex, leather or vinyl/PVC, lycra and so on., emphasizing the body's shape and the primary and secondary sexual characteristic. The requirement for such dress codes differ.

2500|$|According to Swiss law, the ICRC {{is defined}} as a private association. Contrary to popular belief, the ICRC is not a {{non-governmental}} organization in the most common sense of the term, nor is it an international organization. As it limits its members (a process called cooptation) to Swiss nationals only, it does not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>policy</b> of open and unrestricted membership for individuals like other legally defined NGOs. The word [...] "international" [...] in its name does not refer to its membership but to the worldwide scope of its activities as defined by the Geneva Conventions. The ICRC has special privileges and legal immunities in many countries, based on national law in these countries or through agreements between the Committee and respective national governments.|$|E
2500|$|BDSM {{actions can}} often take place during a {{specific}} {{period of time}} agreed to by both parties, referred to as [...] "play", a [...] "scene", or a [...] "session". Participants usually derive pleasure from this, {{even though many of}} the practices—such as inflicting pain or humiliation or being restrained — would be unpleasant under other circumstances. Explicit sexual activity, such as sexual penetration, may occur within a session, but is not essential. Such explicit sexual interaction is, for legal reasons, seen only rarely in public play spaces, and it is sometimes specifically banned by the rules of a party or playspace. Whether it is a public [...] "playspace"—ranging from a party at an established community dungeon to a hosted play [...] "zone" [...] at a nightclub or social event—the parameters of allowance can vary. Some <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>policy</b> of panties/nipple tape for women (underwear for men) and some allow full nudity with explicit sexual interaction allowed.|$|E

2500|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, the ICRC {{is not a}} {{sovereign}} entity like the Sovereign Military Order of Malta and also {{it is not an}} international organization, neither of non-governmental nor of governmental type. The ICRC limits its membership to Swiss nationals only, and also [...] it does not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>policy</b> of open and unrestricted membership for individuals as its new members are selected by the Committee itself (a process called cooptation). However, since the early 1990s, the ICRC employs persons {{from all over the world}} to serve in its field mission and at Headquarters. In 2007, almost half of ICRC staff was non-Swiss. The ICRC has special privileges and legal immunities in many countries, based on national law in these countries, based on agreements between the ICRC and the respective governments, or, in some cases, based on international jurisprudence (such as the right of ICRC delegates not to bear witness in front of international tribunals).|$|E
2500|$|The {{success of}} the Conservative Party in reorganising itself was {{validated}} by its victory at the 1951 general election. Winston Churchill, the party leader, brought in a Party Chairman to modernise the creaking institution. Lord Woolton was a successful department store owner and wartime Minister of Food. As Party Chairman 1946–55, he rebuilt the local organisations {{with an emphasis on}} membership, money, and a unified national propaganda appeal on critical issues. To broaden the base of potential candidates, the national party provided financial aid to candidates, and assisted the local organisations in raising local money. Lord Woolton emphasised a rhetoric that characterised the opponents as [...] "Socialist" [...] rather than [...] "Labour". The libertarian influence of Professor Friedrich Hayek's 1944 best-seller Road to Serfdom was apparent in the younger generation, but that took another quarter century to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>policy</b> impact. By 1951, Labour had worn out its welcome in the middle classes; its factions were bitterly embroiled. Conservatives were ready to govern again.|$|E

[...] The IACHR also stated that: [...] "The Commission is of the view that the new regime did not have, and does not now <b>have,</b> <b>a</b> <b>policy</b> of violating the right to life of political enemies, including among the latter the former guardsmen of the Government of General Somoza, whom a large sector of the population of Nicaragua held responsible for serious human rights violations during the former regime; proof of the foregoing is the abolition of the death penalty and the high number of former guardsmen who were prisoners and brought to trial for crimes that constituted violations of human rights." ...|$|E
