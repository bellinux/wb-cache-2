500|$|Todd Martens {{from the}} Los Angeles Times stated that [...] "Celebration" [...] {{works as a}} throwaway, midsummer dance pop number. However, {{he felt that the}} song had modest goals, [...] "at least by Madonna's standards. Even when it gets a bit risque [...] silliness rules the day. She invites us 'to the dance of life,' and coasts over the chorus." [...] He went on to add that the song [...] "is an {{effective}} look back, a gliding, reassuring number that she [...] hasn't forgotten her beginning. But rather than instill a sense of nostalgia, everything feels a bit obligatory. The sound of an artist, hopefully, ready for the next chapter." [...] Michael Slezak from Entertainment Weekly called the song [...] "unapologetically dance-y" [...] but felt [...] "disappointed that lyrically, Madonna seems to be revisiting the 'Party! Get on the floor!' theme <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>umpteenth</b> <b>time</b> without even the slightest bit of linguistic flair." [...] Chris Williams from Billboard said that [...] "Madonna's latest single won't start any new trends, but it does return the singer to her dance-floor roots."

2500|$|In {{the palace}} courtyard, {{the common people}} fear {{the arrival of the}} Moors (Scene 1), and the king tries to reassure them, {{inviting}} them to seek refuge in the palace. Suddenly, unexpected shouts of victory are heard (Scene 2). A herald enters and describes in detail the total defeat of the Moors, leading behind him a band of captive enemies, including two kings (Scene 3). When the King of Castile asks who is responsible, an officer tells him that Don Diegue wants to lead the victor into his presence in person. The king realises that it is Rodrigue, who is hailed as a saviour by everyone present (Scene 4). Rodrigue is then introduced by his father and welcomed into the arms of the king. Rodrigue says that, driven to despair by the tragedy that has divided him from Chimène, he had sought an honourable death in battle. The king tries to console him, suggesting that Chimene – who is still in love with him – might have second thoughts about her revenge, given the valour her beloved has just shown. The scene ends in choruses and dances of victory, during which Rodrigue is proclaimed [...] "El Cid" [...] (Scene 5). As the celebrations end, Chimène reappears. Having learned of Rodrigue's exploits, she fears she will now fail to achieve her revenge. In fact, the king wants to declare Rodrigue above the law, but the other knights are opposed, offering to take up the challenge on her behalf against the [...] "Cid" [...] in a trial by combat.

40|$|Authoring of Adaptation in the GRAPPLE project”: {{it could}} have been the title of a master thesis about {{authoring}} adaptive applications <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>umpteenth</b> Adaptive Hypermedia System. To some extend, indeed it is, since this thesis is about the authoring process of adaptive applications. It is my very pleasure, however, to be able to say that in this thesis we describe a new dimension that has been added to this authoring process by the GRAPPLE project. The merit of this new dimension lies in the fact that it enables adaptive applications to be specified in a generic way, which, in turn, allows adaptive applications to become interoperable. Since I have entered the GRAPPLE project when it had been running for exactly a year, when I started my graduation process there were many develpments in progress but not so many were thoroughly documented and completely decided upon. We could thus say that I suffered from a genuine ‘cold start’, but fortunately there were three people that have been always willing to help me, answer all my (numerous) questions and discuss the issues that I –sometimes mistakenly- perceived. Therefore, I would like to thank Paul De Bra for his guidance and ability to relate everything together. I also would like to thank Kees van der Sluijs very much, who was my tutor in its broadest sense, who has had an enormous amount of patience with me, and who helped me to put everything in perspective over and over again. And finally I would like to thank David Smits, my roommate and GALE-genious, for his advice and ideas on more than just my technological questions...|$|R
