40|$|Using {{data from}} the credit default swap (CDS), {{corporate}} bond, and equity markets, we construct several measures <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> and examine the spill-over <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> shocks across these markets. Based on the principal component analysis <b>of</b> multiple <b>liquidity</b> measures, we {{show that there is}} a dominant first principal component in each of the markets. However, the linkage <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> shocks varies between different markets. In particular, there is a common component between the equity and both CDS and bond markets, but not between the CDS and bond market. Moreover, the vector autoregression results show that while there is spill-over <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> shocks between equity and CDS markets, surprisingly there is no clear spill-over <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> shocks between equity and bond markets.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the impact of {{illiquidity}} on prices by exploring the theoretical boundaries of illiquidity discounts for bonds. The focus of this paper is on the theoretical boundaries of the value <b>of</b> <b>liquidity,</b> not the value <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> alongside the value of credit quality. Nevertheless, the theoretical bounds of the value <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> have important implications for current markets. The price impact of illiquidity is modeled as the value of a lookback option {{over the course of the}} illiquid period. Significant differences in the value <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> for bonds, as opposed to the value <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> for stocks, are discovered. Liquidity is not as valuable for bonds as it is for stocks, because of the interest income generated by holding a bond.

40|$|The pricing <b>of</b> total <b>liquidity</b> risk is {{studied in}} the {{cross-section}} of stock returns. The study {{suggests that there is}} a positive relation between total volatility <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> and expected returns. Our measure <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> is based on Amihud (2002) and its volatility is measured using daily data. Furthermore, we document that total volatility <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> is priced in the presence <b>of</b> systematic <b>liquidity</b> risk: the covariance of stock returns with aggregate <b>liquidity,</b> the covariance <b>of</b> stock <b>liquidity</b> with aggregate liquidity, and the covariance <b>of</b> stock <b>liquidity</b> with the market return. The separate pricing of total volatility <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> indicates that idiosyncratic liquidity risk is important in the cross section of returns. This result is puzzling in light of Acharya and Pedersen (2005) who develop a model in which only systematic liquidity risk affects returns. The positive correlation between the volatility <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> and expected returns suggests that risk averse investors require a risk premium for holding stocks that have high variation in liquidity. Higher variation in liquidity implies that a stock may become illiquid with higher probability {{at a time when it}} is traded.

The Liquidity Adjusted Capital Asset Pricing model provides a unified framework for the testing <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> risks.

40|$|The present {{article focuses}} on the {{internal}} factors which have potential infl uence on the <b>liquidity</b> <b>of</b> the Slovenian banking sector. Unlike other studies, this paper uses multiple dependent variables, encompassing different views on liquidity and leading to higher complexity. These include the creation <b>of</b> <b>liquidity,</b> its outfl ow, net change and total reallocation, determined {{on the basis of}} a specifi c method <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> measurement – the gross liquidity fl ows. The chosen independent variables include various items of internal character such as loans, deposits, profi t, capital and the size of the bank. Robust regression analyses are performed. The results indicate that internal factors have the greatest infl uence on the creation <b>of</b> <b>liquidity,</b> where almost all the variables considered were signifi cant. Used factors do not only affect liquidity creation, often investigated by authors, but affect other dimensions <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> as well. A signifi cant item which played a role in multiple dimensions <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> was the value of loans and the size of the bank (total assets). The models have shown that any given factor only has an infl uence on the creation <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> without infl uencing its outfl ow and vice versa. Thus, when looking for determinants only for the creation or only for the outfl ow <b>of</b> <b>liquidity,</b> the results need not necessarily comprehensively show the infl uence of the given factors, and can lead to erroneous conclusions. It is therefore suitable to include multiple views on the value <b>of</b> <b>liquidity,</b> since the infl uence of a factor can be more dominant in a different dimension <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> and affect the fi nal value...|$|R

40|$|The effect <b>of</b> {{leverage}} on <b>liquidity</b> is a {{tool for}} analysing the level <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> for a given production process. It measures {{the sensitivity of the}} level <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> that results from changes in the volume of production and unit operating margin. A commercial activity is liquid at the moment when all costs are covered by revenues. However, not all of the cash flows from production influence liquidity levels. The estimated costs do not directly influence the level <b>of</b> <b>liquidity.</b> Therefore, two indicators are to be taken into consideration: the elasticity <b>of</b> ongoing <b>liquidity</b> - fixed costs include estimated costs, and, the elasticity <b>of</b> immediate <b>liquidity</b> - fixed costs only include costs that are payable. The coefficients of leverage <b>of</b> ongoing <b>liquidity</b> and <b>of</b> leverage <b>of</b> immediate <b>liquidity</b> in relation to the operating margin have a behaviour that is identical to that calculated in relation to production. If the productive capacity remains unchanged, the regulation of the change in elasticity of the costs and of its influence on the unitary operating margin is the sole parameter available to the entrepreneur to maintain the <b>liquidity</b> <b>of</b> the company at the desired level. But, if the productive capacity is variable, the entrepreneur can use the volume of sales to control liquidity but then the transformation of the production process must be analysed so as to adjust the relevant elements to retain in the operating structure the degree <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> wished for. ...|$|R

However, latent liquidity exhibits greater consistency in terms of its relationships with bond characteristics, over time.
