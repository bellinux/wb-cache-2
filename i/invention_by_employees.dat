30|$|In {{line with}} the freedom of research, a number of facilitations and {{privileges}} {{having to do with}} planning and construction are available to the original “inventors” of service robots. These range from a special protection of their <b>inventions</b> <b>by</b> means of <b>employee</b> <b>invention</b> rights and copyright, to the granting of patent and trademark protection. However, these privileges end when a service robot ceases to be an object of pure research and is to be put on the market, instead. When a robot is put into circulation, the notion of protecting the researcher is superseded by concern {{for the safety of the}} general public.|$|R
30|$|Germany (and {{several other}} countries, {{including}} the UK, Denmark, and Belgium) has introduced legislation {{that supports the}} commercialization of publicly funded research at universities. In Germany, {{an amendment to the}} German Employed Inventor's Act in 2002 revoked the long-standing privilege for employees of universities, which allowed university researchers to take possession of patent rights to their inventions (‘professor privilege’). Now, universities can lay claim to <b>inventions</b> created <b>by</b> their <b>employees</b> with government funding on their campuses. Even though Germany and other European countries were aiming at a similar positive effect on spin-off creation as the Bayh-Dole Act (1980) in the USAf, the effect remained far behind expectations (Siepmann 2004).|$|R
40|$|Most inventions in the Netherlands {{have been}} made <b>by</b> <b>employees.</b> Section 10 in the former patent act (Octrooiwet 1910) {{regulated}} the subject. Subsection 1 gave the employer the right {{to apply for a}} patent for an <b>invention</b> made <b>by</b> an <b>employee.</b> The employee got the right to compensation for the loss of the patent, however, how to determine a fair amount of compensation was not clearly defined in the patent act. This had two causes: 1 the text of subsection 2 was unclear; 2 the assumption that the parties would have considered the chance of an employee producing an invention in the parties dealings about salary. This assumption is contrary to the reality. Compensation for the employee is coercive law (Subsection 3). Employees seldom bring an action for compensation, and if they do the courts award low compensations. Thus the costs and the risk of losing the case are high for an employee. The case law of the Supreme Court (Hoge Raad) is unclear: compensation depends strongly on the circumstances of the case. The law in regard to compensation is unjust to the employee, a labour law approach predominates and the employee sometimes receives a supplement to his or her salary. A patent law approach, in which the employee should share in the possible profits resulting from the exploitation of the invention, is rejected. The Dutch government wants to promote innovation and inventions. However Dutch law lacks clear regulation for the compensation of employed inventors. The Dutch parliament clearly expressed the view that all employees in a company should be stimulated to invent during the debate on the new patent act (Rijksoctrooiwet 1995) in 1994. In the new act section 10 Octrooiwet 1910 was changed: <b>inventions</b> made <b>by</b> an <b>employee</b> are owned <b>by</b> the employee; an <b>invention</b> made <b>by</b> an <b>employee</b> with special knowledge, and a research and development contract, belongs to his employer (section 12 subsection 1); an <b>invention</b> made <b>by</b> an academic at an university belongs to the university (subsection 3). The subsections 6 and 7 relative to the compensation hold the same wording as in the former patent act. The goal of stimulating all employees is not achieved, because subsection 5 allows the parties to transfer future inventions in writing. (subsection 5). Subsection 3 is also a violation of the fundamental rights awarded to academics by the International Treaty on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (section 15 subsections 1 and 3), which was ratified by the Netherlands in 1979. The number of European patents pro inhabitant or pro industrial worker in Germany is considerably higher than in the Netherlands. This is a consequence of a special act for employed inventors (Arbeitnehmererfindungsgesetz). An <b>invention</b> made <b>by</b> an employed inventor belongs to him or her. His or her employer has the right to claim the invention if it is a service invention. The conditions for a service invention are: the promotion of the <b>invention</b> <b>by</b> the employer due to providing time, means or experience to the employee; the invention has to be made during the agreement. The employer has to pay compensation for the claimed invention and the employee receives a part of the profits made during the exploitation of the invention. The byelaws to this act make the determination of the amount of the compensation in most cases obvious. Most disputes are settled by an arbitration board of the German Patent office. The justification of the compensation is the employee’s right to share in the monopoly resulting from his or her invention. The incentives to invent provided by the German act, and justice for the employed inventor, are strong arguments for the Dutch legislators to follow the principals of the German act. This recommendation is elaborated as a proposal for an act in this thesis. Technology, Policy and Managemen...|$|R
50|$|Shop right, in United States patent law, is {{an implied}} license under which a firm may use a {{patented}} <b>invention,</b> invented <b>by</b> an <b>employee</b> {{who was working}} {{within the scope of}} their employment, using the firms' equipment, or inventing at the firms' expense. Even if the employee never assigned rights to the firm, a court of law may find that the firm has the right {{to make use of the}} invention, and thus can not be sued <b>by</b> the <b>employee</b> for patent infringement. This will allow the firm to attempt to capitalize on the value of the patent, as the firm is allowed to use the object of the patent in the routine operation of its business without royalty payments. Shop right is non-transferable. It only inures to the benefit of the employer and can not be sold by that employer to an unrelated party, except in a sale of the business as a whole.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} value of patented inventions originating from Germany and the correlates of their value, using German employee inventors' compensation records. These proprietary company records, collected {{in compliance with the}} German Employee's Invention Act of 1957, provide estimates of {{the value of}} all patentable <b>inventions</b> made <b>by</b> <b>employees</b> of German enterprises and represent a novel and unique source of data. Prior economic research in this area has been hampered by the scarcity of direct measures of innovative output. The use of employee inventor records enables the collection of a much larger sample of point estimates of patent value than has been assembled previously. This study represents the first research to utilize a direct measure of innovative output that incorporates a representative sample of granted patents and introduces several new correlates of patent value. The improved estimation and prediction of patent value is not only important for assessing the productivity of research and development and guiding innovation policy, but also provides a window into the process of technological change. 1 Financial support for this research was provided by grant No. 007 -I- 7 / 00 from the Center for German and European Studies at the University of California at Berkeley. Assistance in constructing correlates of patent value is being provided by Aurigin Systems. Draft for the U. C. Berkeley Seminar on Innovation and Technological Change 1. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{small sample}} of 38 Advanced Technology Projects funded between 1993 and 1996 are {{surveyed}} to explore the reasons for university non-participation, or, in the cases where they did participate, whether the partnerships encountered any difficulties from their participation. 32 percent report that intellectual property issues were an insurmountable barrier to university participation. Such barriers are more likely when the ATP share of funding is high and when the expected duration of the research is relatively short. They are also somewhat more likely for projects involving chemical technology, and when industrial participants have had previous experience with universities as research partners. These difficulties over IP may arise because the cultures in the two institutional forms differ, or because the original ATP guidelines do not recognize {{the existence of the}} Bayh-Dole Act (which grants universities title to <b>inventions</b> made <b>by</b> their <b>employees</b> using outside funding) ...|$|R
40|$|Section 39 (1) of the Patents Act 1977 {{governs the}} {{ownership}} of <b>inventions</b> devised <b>by</b> <b>employees</b> {{in the course of}} their employment. Introduced 'to codify in a few lines the accumulated common law experience' prior to 1977, it does not expressly differentiate between employment fields, and has been widely assumed to apply indiscriminately, without regard to the particular context of employment. The purpose of this article is to revisit that assumption. In the argument made, section 39 (1) was built around a private sector paradigm, the courts' departure from which is supported by a 'rational reason' in the Shanks v Unilever plc [2010] EWCA Civ 1283, [2011] RPC 12 sense. If accepted, such an argument would open the way to the kind of reasoning adopted by the Federal Court of Australia in University of Western Australia v Gray (2009) 179 FCR 346, where the nature of academic employment was held to require that <b>inventions</b> devised <b>by</b> academics be treated differently from those devised by their corporate counterparts. It would also enable the courts to acknowledge the special issues raised by the recognition of exclusionary rights of 'property' in respect of academic and professional inventions, the possibility of morality- and policy-based limits on such rights and the inappropriateness and undesirability of an ownership regime based on a paradigm in which not all employment relationships can be readily or satisfactorily accommodated. Such considerations have particular weight if that paradigm is to become the means for 'sewing the fly buttons on' a statute regarded by post- 1977 courts as having been poorly drafted, as it raises the risk of the common law principles which section 39 (1) was intended to enshrine becoming subverted by parliamentary caprice. © The Author 2012.

40|$|In its Seventy-First Session, the Nevada Legislature {{enacted a}} new statute, S. B. 558, {{granting}} employers complete ownership of any work-related <b>inventions</b> created <b>by</b> their <b>employees,</b> {{regardless of whether}} the employer contributed any resources whatsoever to the inventive process. This stunning reversal of longstanding common law was little noticed by the public, and was debated only superficially in the state legislature before receiving its overwhelming vote of approval. This Article examines Nevada 2 ̆ 7 s new employee invention statute from the perspectives of common law and public policy. It compares Nevada 2 ̆ 7 s new statute with the traditional common law rules governing employee inventions, {{as well as with the}} statutory schemes developed in other states. The analysis leads to the conclusion that Nevada 2 ̆ 7 s statute is unique, in that it deprives employees of their common law rights, whereas other states have, at a minimum, preserved those rights, and, in many cases, have enhanced those rights through pro-employee legislation. Although the ostensible purpose of S. B. 558 was to attract more high-technology businesses to Nevada, the new law is unlikely to achieve the economic objectives articulated in its legislative history. On the contrary, it is likely to exact substantial social and economic costs by depriving Nevada 2 ̆ 7 s technological innovators of the fruits of their creative efforts while increasing the volume of commercial litigation in Nevada 2 ̆ 7 s courts...|$|R
