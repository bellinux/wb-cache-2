5|$|As {{well as a}} fencing and archery enthusiast, Parsons {{was also}} a keen shooter; he often hunted jack rabbits and cotton tails in the desert, and was amused by mock dueling with Forman while on test sites with rifles and shotguns. Upon proposing to his first wife Helen, he gifted her a pistol. Parsons enjoyed playing pranks on his colleagues, often through detonating {{explosives}} such as firecrackers and smoke bombs, and was known to spend <b>hours</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> in the bathtub playing with toy boats while living at the Parsonage.|$|E
5|$|Bundy was {{regarded}} {{by many of}} his young female victims as handsome and charismatic, traits that he exploited to win their trust. He typically approached them in public places, feigning injury or disability, or impersonating an authority figure, before overpowering and assaulting them at more secluded locations. He sometimes revisited his secondary crime scenes for <b>hours</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> grooming and performing sexual acts with the decomposing corpses until putrefaction and destruction by wild animals made further interaction impossible. He decapitated at least 12 of his victims, and kept some of the severed heads in his apartment {{for a period of}} time as mementos. On a few occasions, he simply broke into dwellings at night and bludgeoned his victims as they slept.|$|E
5|$|Resident {{killer whales}} {{in the eastern}} North Pacific have a {{particularly}} complex and stable social grouping system. Unlike any other mammal species whose social structure is known, residents live with their mothers for their entire lives. These family groups are based on matrilines consisting of the eldest female (matriarch) and her sons and daughters, and the descendants of her daughters, etc. The average size of a matriline is 5.5 animals. Because females can reach age 90, {{as many as four}} generations travel together. These matrilineal groups are highly stable. Individuals separate for only a few <b>hours</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> to mate or forage. With one exception, the killer whale named Luna, no permanent separation of an individual from a resident matriline has been recorded.|$|E

5|$|This is {{the most}} common type of {{thunderstorm}} development. Mature thunderstorms are found near the center of the cluster, while dissipating thunderstorms exist on their downwind side. Multicell storms form as clusters of storms but may then evolve into one or more squall lines. While each cell of the cluster may only last 20minutes, the cluster itself may persist for <b>hours</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time.</b> They often arise from convective updrafts in or near mountain ranges and linear weather boundaries, such as strong cold fronts or troughs of low pressure. These type of storms are stronger than the single-cell storm, yet much weaker than the supercell storm. Hazards with the multicell cluster include moderate-sized hail, flash flooding, and weak tornadoes.|$|E
5|$|Maya Lahan {{was born}} in York on 20 September 1975. She became the girlfriend of John Bateman (Richard Armitage) whilst {{attending}} Leeds University. Maya was once aspired to open her own Tapas bar. When John became stuck in Dakar, he worked with Vaughn Edwards (Iain Glen) as a courier {{in order to get}} back home, but Maya remained unaware of his activities. Vaughn remembered that during their time, John would talk to him about Maya for <b>hours</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time.</b> However, after he was involved in the bombing of a British Embassy in 1995, John was forced to leave Maya and murder friend Lucas North, and since started masquerading as him. In the belief that John died, Maya got on with her life, becoming a doctor and enters a relationship with Vaughn (whom she knows as Michael).|$|E
5|$|Rancho Grande {{was located}} at a {{mountain}} pass in {{a branch of}} the Andes known as the Venezuelan Coastal Range, which was an important migration route for butterflies, and the station proved very lucrative in the study of insects. During his work at Rancho Grande, Beebe broke his leg in a fall from a ladder, and the forced immobility which resulted from having his leg in a cast presented him with a new opportunity for observing the area's wildlife. At his request, he and his chair were transported into the nearby jungle, and as he sat motionless the wild animals around him soon began to go about their business without noticing his presence. His immobility also presented him with the opportunity to spend <b>hours</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> observing a pair of bat falcons through binoculars, documenting the behavior of their two chicks and every prey item fed to them by their parents. His observations documented several behaviors which were new to science, including the first documented example of play in birds.|$|E

5|$|The Apache's first {{operational}} {{tour was}} {{as part of}} 16 Air Assault Brigade in Afghanistan; there were eight Apache AH1s deployed in Afghanistan in February 2007. These were drawn from No. 656 Squadron and No. 664 Squadron of 9 Regiment AAC, based at Dishforth Airfield. Unlike their American counterparts in Afghanistan, the Apache AH1 is deployed with its Longbow Fire Control Radar to enable the pilot to better manage traffic in their airspace. Initially pilots had to often fly for 16–18 <b>hours</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> due to the low number of Apaches in the theatre; typically each Apache would be stationed in Afghanistan for eight weeks before returning to Britain for roughly eight weeks of maintenance. On 22 May 2006, a UK Apache operating in Afghanistan's Helmand province used a Hellfire missile to destroy an abandoned French vehicle to protect sensitive equipment.|$|E

25|$|Turtles {{can rest}} or sleep {{underwater}} for several <b>hours</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> but submergence time is much shorter while diving for food or to escape predators. Breath-holding ability {{is affected by}} activity and stress, which is why turtles quickly drown in shrimp trawlers and other fishing gear. During the night while sleeping and {{to protect themselves from}} potential predators, the adults wedge themselves under rocks below the surface and under ledges in reefs and coastal rocks. Many green sea turtles have been observed in returning to the same sleeping location night after night.|$|E
25|$|With {{an overall}} {{propulsion}} power of 22,000hp, Moskva {{was at the}} time the most powerful diesel-electric icebreaker in the world. She was second only to the nuclear-powered Lenin which, at 44,000hp, had twice the power of the Moskva-class icebreakers. While the most powerful western icebreaker at the time, the 1955-built USS Glacier, had two propulsion motors rated at 10,500hp each and was thus nearly as powerful as Moskva, the American icebreaker could maintain this power level only for a period of four <b>hours</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> and the total continuous rating was only 16,900hp.|$|E

25|$|Weißheimer {{moved back}} to Weimar after the theatre season. He and Liszt were musically like-minded and so Weißheimer was {{accepted}} by Liszt as a student in composition.

Here, in Altenburg, Weimar, home of Liszt's close friend Princess Carolyne zu Sayn-Wittgenstein of Sayn-Wittgenstein, Weißheimer was introduced to a new musical world. While here he met his friend, Peter Cornelius, who had also come to Weimar in 1860, and was introduced to Felix Draeseke, Hans von Bronsart, Carl Tausig, the Bohemian Smetana, Franz Bendel, Gruère and Hans von Bülow among other notables.|$|E
25|$|Divers only {{spend a few}} <b>hours</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> {{on these}} fast but exposed boats. The boats are usually {{relatively}} small so they can easily be transported on roads and launched at a convenient site depending on the weather. Boats of this size can be launched from slipways or through the surf on suitable beaches. The smaller models are suitable for amateur divers, as they can only transport a few divers. The larger boats can carry enough divers to be viable for professional use. These boats will generally carry basic safety equipment such as marine VHF radio, small boat safety gear, lifejackets and first aid oxygen administration equipment.|$|E
