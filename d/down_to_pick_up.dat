5|$|That evening, Anya {{falls asleep}} on Giles' sofa while Spike takes a mugful of {{blood from the}} refrigerator. Xander enters Giles' {{apartment}} as Spike, his mouth wet with blood, bends <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> something that he dropped {{in front of the}} sofa where Anya sleeps. Inferring that Spike bit and drank from Anya, Xander pummels him ferociously until Anya wakes and stops him; excited that he fought to defend her, Anya gestures that they should go have sex.|$|E
25|$|When the {{helicopter}} landed, Cleland jumped out, {{followed by the}} two soldiers. They ducked beneath the rotors and turned to watch the liftoff. Cleland reached <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> a grenade that he believed had popped off his flak jacket. It exploded and the blast slammed him backward, shredding both his legs and one arm.|$|E
25|$|When Hrólfr {{heard that}} Aðils refused to pay, {{he set off}} to Uppsala. They brought the ships to the river Fyris and rode {{directly}} to the Swedish king's hall at Uppsala with his twelve berserkers. Yrsa welcomed them and led them to their lodgings. Fires were prepared for them and they were given drinks. However, so much wood was heaped on the fires that the clothes started to burn away from their bodies. Hrólfr and his men had enough and threw the courtiers on the fire. Yrsa arrived and gave them a horn full of gold, the ring Svíagris {{and asked them to}} flee. As they rode over the Fyrisvellir, they saw Aðils and his men pursuing them. The fleeing men threw their gold on the plain so that the pursuers would stop to collect the gold. Aðils, however, continued the chase on his horse Slöngvir. Hrólfr then threw Svíagris and saw how Aðils stooped <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> the ring with his spear. Hrólfr exclaimed that he had seen the mightiest man in Sweden bend his back.|$|E

5|$|ML Pin {{recalled}} {{in his autobiography}} that although {{his mother was a}} kind and loving figure, his father was rather strict and acted more like a teacher than a father, and that he was often fearful of him. A loyal servant of the crown, MR Pia introduced ML Pin to King Vajiravudh when he was seven years old. Another often-recounted story from his childhood is that of how, before having learned to count, when his mother asked him to gather half a bunch of betel leaves for her, ML Pin set <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> one leaf with each hand at a time, separating them equally into two piles.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{distinctive}} episodes is when they drop a book and when they bend <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> it <b>up,</b> someone else <b>picks</b> it <b>up</b> too. The people who <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> the book start dating, introducing Lea Michaela A. Cabili and Mikee Gabriel.|$|R
500|$|His despair gone, Bemis contentedly sorts {{the books}} he {{looks forward to}} reading for years to come. Just as he bends <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> the first book, he stumbles, and his glasses fall off and shatter. In shock, {{he picks up the}} broken remains of the glasses he is {{virtually}} blind without, and says, [...] "That's not fair. That's not fair at all. There was time now. There was—was all the time I needed…! It's not fair! [...] It's not fair!" [...] and bursts into tears, surrounded by books he now can never read.|$|E
2500|$|The Chargers then {{countered with}} a 72-yard drive ending with Benirschke's 27-yard field goal. The Raiders defense was {{exhausted}} and they implored their offense by saying [...] "don't {{let them have}} the damn ball back"! The Raiders then held onto the ball for the last 6:52 of the game on a 15-play drive (12 runs, one pass, two quarterback kneels), with Plunkett scrambling twice on third <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> key first downs, to clinch the victory.|$|E
2500|$|King {{made a great}} {{start to}} his Premier League career as he opened up with an 8–1 victory over Sky {{wildcard}} Wayne Mardle. He {{then went on to}} record three more victories on the bounce beating James Wade 8–1, John Part 8-2 and Jelle Klaasen 8–4. He then faced defending champion Phil Taylor in Newcastle, recording a 7–7 draw despite leading 7–5 with both players averaging over 100. King's form then dropped, only winning two more games in Birmingham and Glasgow against Mardle and Wade respectively. King was also a controversial figure during the tournament, often letting the crowd get to him and affect his mood and darts. During a 2009 Premier League match with Taylor, he threw a dart over Taylor as he stooped <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> his flight. During the post-match interview, neither of them would look at each other. Another Premier League crowd at Newcastle in 2010 appeared to shake him with taunts that resulted in him stopping mid-throw and making gestures towards the fans. Five-time world champion Eric Bristow claimed that King [...] "needs a strait jacket" [...] after the performance. His final position of 4th in the league was influenced by the illness of Mardle, as he was withdrawn from the competition. Therefore, all results that included Mardle were annulled, including King's two victories over Mardle. King's fourth place in the overall league meant that he faced Taylor in the play-off semi-finals at the Wembley Arena. King won 10–6 to end Taylor's winning streak in Premier League competitions. Despite this victory he was to finish runner-up as he lost the final 13–8 to Wade, who beat Raymond van Barneveld 10–8 in the other semi-final. Wade led King 8–2 before a mini comeback from King but Wade was able to see the game out to claim his maiden Premier League Darts title.|$|E

25|$|The Celtic Tiger {{started in}} the mid-1990s and boomed until 2001, when it slowed <b>down,</b> only <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> again in 2003.

60|$|She {{threw the}} bomb. It sailed in an arc, an expert, rolling and {{bouncing}} {{to the entrance}} of the bunker. Two Wounded Soldiers stood uncertainly by the brick pile.

50|$|Finally, {{their worst}} {{nightmare}} comes true when the SD and Dutch plain-clothed police raid the warehouse (4 August 1944). As {{all of the}} Jews are being led away one by one it shows what camps and years did they die at.

60|$|Breakfast done, the snow-bobbins hopped <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> the crumbs.

50|$|A notable feature {{now found}} on some {{off-shore}} wind turbines {{is a large}} sturdy helicopter-hoisting platform built {{on top of the}} nacelle, capable of supporting service personnel and their tools, winched <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the platform from a helicopter hovering above it. Wind turbine rotors are stopped, feathered and locked before personnel are dropped <b>down</b> <b>to</b> or <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> from the platforms.|$|R
40|$|Excerpt] An {{interesting}} question was recently posed by a guest speaker to undergraduate {{students in a}} strategic management course: “If you saw trash {{on the floor of}} your student cafeteria and lounge, would you bend <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> it <b>up?</b> If you don 2 ̆ 7 t see the trash now, why should I trust that you will begin to see it when it is in my hotel cafeteria or lobby?...|$|R

60|$|Another cutter {{shot from}} Drummond's hand and struck Driscoll's side. He stooped, and Thirlwell {{thought he was}} falling but {{saw that he had}} bent <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> his ax. Next moment the blade flashed in a long sweep and Drummond sprang behind the anvil, which {{occupied}} the middle of the floor. He had another cutter and held it back, with his arm bent, ready to launch it at Driscoll's head, but Thirlwell imagined he was pressed too hard to feel sure of his aim and {{wanted to get out of}} his antagonist's reach. It was plain that the situation was dangerous, but Thirlwell knew he could not stop the men by shouting, and the fight would probably be over before he reached the shack. He had, however, forgotten the smith, who pulled a glowing iron from the fire.|$|E
60|$|It is evident, then, {{that all}} {{authority}} in such things is bad. People sometimes inquire what {{form of government}} is most suitable for an artist to live under. To this question {{there is only one}} answer. The form of government that is most suitable to the artist is no government at all. Authority over him and his art is ridiculous. It has been stated that under despotisms artists have produced lovely work. This is not quite so. Artists have visited despots, not as subjects to be tyrannised over, but as wandering wonder-makers, as fascinating vagrant personalities, to be entertained and charmed and suffered to be at peace, and allowed to create. There is this to be said in favour of the despot, that he, being an individual, may have culture, while the mob, being a monster, has none. One who is an Emperor and King may stoop <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> a brush for a painter, but when the democracy stoops down it is merely to throw mud. And yet the democracy have not so far to stoop as the emperor. In fact, when they want to throw mud they have not to stoop at all. But there is no necessity to separate the monarch from the mob; all authority is equally bad.|$|E

With a single, Montreal's Wallace Johnson broke up {{what would have been}} the first perfect game in Reds history. According to teammate Tom Browning, Robinson was pitching with pain in his elbow so severe that he could not <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> a ball from the ground without squatting <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> it <b>up.</b> Browning would throw the Reds' first perfect game four months later.|$|R
