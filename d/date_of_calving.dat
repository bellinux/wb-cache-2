Nineteen dairy cows, with confirmed pregnancy, were selected by body weight, body condition score (BCS), number of lactation, and milk yield in previous lactation, and randomly distributed among two groups, one to receive organic (n = 9) and the other the inorganic (n = 10) source of Zn, Cu and Se. Diets were formulated to meet the nutritional requirements of animals from 60 days before the expected <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>calving</b> up to 80 days of lactation.

A whole cell ETEC vaccine containing fimbrial antigens of polyvalent strains based on field serotypes was produced. The efficacy of ETEC vaccine used to control neonatal colibacillosis of dairy calves was studied in experimental animals and field trials. Five pregnant dairy cow were used for experimental study. Three animals were injected subcutaneously with 5 ml vaccine at 6 weeks and again 2 weeks before expected <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>calving,</b> others were left unvaccinated as control. Two calves born from vaccinated cows were given colostrum and milk from their own mothers. A calf born from vaccinated cow was not given colostrum, but milk from other vaccinated cow at day 8. Three day old calves receiving colostrum of vaccinated cows were challenged with 2 ml either ETEC K 99 or F 41 suspension containing 108 colony forming units per ml did not show clinical signs of diarrhoea and their body weight increased progressively. Whereas, a calf born from unvaccinated group was challenged with ETEC K 99 developed clinical sign of diarrhoea at 15 hours later and died at 8 days post-inoculation. A calf born from unvaccinated cow was challenged with ETEC F 41 developed watery diarrhoea, it did not die, but its body weight relatively did not increase.

40|$|Reproductive rate is an {{important}} component of economic success in livestock production. Parturition interval (IEP) is a direct measure of the productivity of the animal. Long IEP reduce the number <b>of</b> <b>calves</b> produced per year. The objective {{this study was to determine}} the distribution of parturitions across month and to evaluate factors affecting IEP. The data included 7, 588 parturitions of Murrah, Mediterranean and Carabobo buffalo from 10 herds in Southern and South-eastern Brazil. The analysis of distribution of parturitions evaluated the effects of month, year and their interaction on birth <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>calves</b> by using a Chi-Square test in SAS PROC FREQ (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Parturition intervals (n = 2, 630) were evaluated using analysis of variance in SAS PROC GLM. The model for IEP included the fixed effects of season (December to May = 1, June to November = 2), year, season x year, sex of the preceding parturition, age of weaning of the previous calf, and herd. All sources of variation were significant (P< 0. 0001) except sex of the preceding parturition (P < 0. 85). The mean IEP was 446. 7 ± 10. 4 days, for seasons 1 and 2 IEP were 419. 8 ± 11. 3 and 473. 6 ± 40. 7 days, respectively, a difference of 54 days.

40|$|Birth {{synchrony}} is {{well documented}} among ungulates and is hypothesised to maximize neonate survival, either by minimizing the risk of predation through predator swamping or by synchronising birthing with increased seasonal food availability. We used encapsulated vaginal implant transmitters to locate and capture neonatal moose calves and document the seasonal and diel timing of parturition in two adjacent study areas with different predation pressure in central Ontario, Canada. We tested the hypothesis that predation promotes earlier and more synchronous birth of moose calves. Across both areas, proportionately more births occurred during the afternoon and fewer than expected occurred overnight.

40|$|While allonursing, the {{provision}} of milk to non-offspring by females, involves a potential cost to their own offspring, allosuckling, the suckling from females {{other than their own}} mothermay allow offspring to compensate for previous deficiencies in maternal milk. We tested this hypothesis in farmed guanacos. Under the compensation hypothesis we predicted that mothers <b>of</b> <b>calves</b> exhibiting allosuckling should be in poorer physical condition and should exhibit relatively low acceptance rates to filial sucking attempts compared to mothers whose calf did not allosuckle. We also predicted that calves exhibiting frequent allosuckling should show similar or greater rates of gain in body weight, but similar total (or final) weight in the long term than calves that nursed from their mothers exclusively. We examined the potential effects of sex and order <b>of</b> birth <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>calves</b> on allosuckling, and the effect of female success during agonistic encounters with other females on allonursing. Two stable groups of 15 and 14 mother– offspring pairs of farmed guanacos were studied from birth to approximately 3 months of age. Allosuckling events comprised 5. 7 % of all suckling events. Allonursing was performed by 52 % of dams and 62 % <b>of</b> <b>calves</b> exhibited allosuckling. We found similar gain rates in body weight and total weight at 60 days of age between allosuckling calves and filial sucking <b>calves,</b> irrespective <b>of</b> whether their mothers allonursed or not (P > 0. 1). Body weight of mothers whose calf allosuckled was significantly lower than that <b>of</b> mothers whose <b>calves</b> nursed from them exclusively (P = 0. 02). In addition, the percentage of acceptance of filial suckling bouts was significantly lower for allosuckling calves (P = 0. 004).

40|$|The European dairy {{industry}} faces an increasingly uncertain world. There is uncertainty about subsidy payment levels and compliance conditions, global competition, price variability, consumer demand, carbon footprints, water quality, biodiversity, landscapes, animal welfare, food safety, etc. The future is uncertain because it cannot be reliably predicted; therefore the industry must adopt production systems {{that will be}} financially robust {{over a wide range}} of possible circumstances. Adding to the uncertainty is a lack of consensus regarding the specific characteristics of these sustainable production systems. In this interdisciplinary research project we developed a profit maximizing whole-farm model and employ it to identify robust milk production systems for Northern Ireland under varying market, policy and farm family conditions. The milk production systems incorporated into the model involve variations in <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>calving,</b> quantity of concentrate fed, and nature of forage utilized. The model also incorporates a disaggregated specification of time use within farm households and links intra-household resource allocation to the process of agricultural technology adoption.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to estimate effects of environmental sensitivity of milk production traits for several environmental parameters and to investigate the impact of combining traits with different environmental sensitivity in an economic index. Variance components and breeding values were estimated for milk, fat, and protein yield, and fat and protein percentage by applying a random regression on values of an environmental parameter for each sire. Fourteen environmental parameters were defined and fitted to data consisting of 151, 696 heifers in 6780 herds in The Netherlands with first-lactation records for milk production, somatic cell count, body condition score, and number of inseminations. Milk, fat, and protein yield showed environmental sensitivity in combination with 12 environmental parameters. Herd-year averages of protein, body condition score, age at calving, calving interval, and peak <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>calving</b> explained most genotype by environment interaction, mainly resulting from scaling effects. Almost all genetic correlations across environments were 0. 99 or higher. Although heterogeneity of genetic variances was considerable, heterogeneity of heritabilities was limited.

After calving, a significant decrease of respiratory burst and nitric oxide concentration were observed in comparison with the pre-calving values but not with the post-calving samplings. Total proteins, β- and γ-globulins showed a progressive and significant increase in concentration after calving, in comparison with pre-calving values. The results of the study confirmed that a decrease of immune functions can be observed in commercial dairy herds in the first four weeks after calving.

40|$|Aim: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to find out the relationship of prepartum udder and teat measurements with subsequent milk production traits in primiparous Nili-Ravi buffaloes. Materials and Methods: A total of 12 Nili-Ravi buffalo heifers were selected from Buffalo Farm, Central Institute for Research on Buffaloes, Regional Station- Bir Dosanjh, Nabha, Patiala, Punjab. The udder length (UL), udder width (UW), udder depth, teat length (TL), teat diameter (TD), and teat distances were measured at fortnightly interval from 60 days prepartum until calving. After calving, 60 days total milk yield (TDMY), peak yield (PY), and days taken to attain PY (DPY) were also recorded. The correlation coefficients of various prepartum udder and teat measurements since 60 days prepartum to calving with 60 days TDMY, PY, and DPY were calculated to find out the relationship between the traits in primiparous Nili-Ravi buffaloes. Results: The result envisaged that all udder and teat measurements were increased gradually toward the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>calving</b> in primiparous buffaloes. The UL, UW, left fore (LF) and right rear (RR) TL, RRTD, and the distance between LF to left rear (LR) teat were positively correlated with 60 days TDMY.

Because for Jægersborg the birth <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> the cales were unknown, UK-field was used for the translation to the situation in Jægersborg (UK-field), while UK-DNA was used as the best possible estimation for the distribution of the mating success among stags on Rhum. The results of this pilot study suggest that the distribution of mating success among stags is more skewed in a poor habitat when compared to a rich one, This suggests that the extremely skewed distribution of the mating success among stags on Rhum found in other studies, is likely to be valid for a poor habitat, but not for a rich one. ...|$|R

At the same time of blood sampling, fat thickness of pelvic region was measured with an ultrasound scanner equipped with a 5 MHz transducer. Blood was analysed for acute phase response (ceruloplasmin, haptoglobin, albumin aad zinc), metabolic (b-OHB, glucose, NEFA, cholesterol,urea, haemoglobin, total proteins and cortisol) and oxidoreductive status (paraoxonase, SOD, GPx and glutathione). Data were analysed with a factorial model (GLM) with fixed effects for time (7 levels), farm (2 levels) and their interaction. Correlation coefficients between the analysed parameters and the levels of significance were calculated with 2 tails Pearson test. Statistical analysis allowed to separate the markers influenced by time of sampling from that influenced by farm, and to select the best predictors of metabolic and oxidative stress around parturition, i. e. total proteins, urea, haptoglobin, cholesterol, BOHB, NEFA, paraoxonase and SOD. The present work also allowed to underline the relationships between stress post partum and oxidoreductive status. Animals presenting impaired body conditions at the beginning of lactation showed an highest probability to develop oxidative stress. In particular the correlation analysis showed significant relationship between fat thickness and albumin, ceruloplasmin, cholesterol, GPx and glutathione...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out at the Livestock Experiment Station, Bhunikey (Pattoki), District Kasur, Pakistan. Forty exotic cows (20 each of Holstein Friesian and Jersey breed) in their last {{trimester}} of pregnancy were randomly selected. These cows {{were divided into two}} equal groups. Animals of group-I served as control and were injected with 20 ml sterile normal saline intramuscularly, while each cow in group-II was treated with vitamin E-selenium (vitamin E acetate 50. 0 mg and sodium selenite 0. 5 mg/ml) twice (20 ml at each time) with one-week interval. First injection was given at about 40 - 60 days prior to the expected <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>calving.</b> Calves born to the experimental cows were monitored to study the carry over effect of treatment, if any, from dams to the calves. The reproductive parameters, viz. placental expulsion period, uterine involution period, postpartum insemination interval, service period and number of services per conception in the cows of treated group were significantly (P< 0. 05) lesser compared with those of the control group. However, the differences in production parameters, i. e., lactation milk yield, lactation length and wet average between the two groups were statistically non significant. The same was true for birth weight, weaning weight and growth rate upto weaning between calves of the two groups. In conclusion, it appears that administration of vitamin E-selenium before calving may be beneficial in improving the postpartum reproductive parameters in exotic cows. However, number of animals used in each group was too small to draw any definite conclusion.

40|$|A {{total of}} 32 Sahiwal cows {{in the last}} {{trimester}} of pregnancy {{were used to determine}} the effect of different immunopotentiators on their postpartum reproductive performance. The cows were divided into four groups. Group- 1 served as untreated control, while groups 2, 3 and 4 were treated with levamisole hydrochloride (0. 5 mg/Kg body weight orally), vitamin E-selenium (10 ml intramuscularly per cow) and BCG vaccine (0. 5 ml subcutaneously per cow), respectively. These immunopotentiators were given twice with one week interval at about 60 days prior to expected <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>calving.</b> Various reproductive parameters during subsequent postpartum period, i. e., placental expulsion period (hours), uterine involution period (days), postpartum estrus interval (days), number of services per conception and service period (days) were studied. It was noted that duration of all these parameters (mean ± SE) were longest in cows of untreated control group (10. 56 ± 0. 57, 52. 38 ± 1. 38, 125. 38 ± 25. 79, 2. 63 ± 0. 50 and 286. 88 ± 39. 04, respectively) and shortest in the cows of vitamin-E selenium treated group (8. 88 ± 0. 30, 31. 13 ± 0. 52, 70. 00 ± 15. 92, 1. 50 ± 0. 19 and 115. 00 ± 19. 75, respectively). Two reproductive parameters, i. e., postpartum estrus interval and number of services per conception were non-significantly lesser in the cows of treated groups as compared to those of untreated control. Three reproductive parameters, i. e., placental expulsion period, uterine involution period and service period were reduced significantly (p< 0, 05) in vitamin-E selenium and BCG treated groups as compared to control.

40|$|Problem statement: The {{transition}} period {{is the most}} stressful time in the production cycle&# 13; of a dairy cow because of depressed feed intake, endocrine and metabolic changes at parturition. The&# 13; aim {{was to determine the}} effect of rumen acid load on postpartum performance and metabolic&# 13; parameters in transition Holstein cows. Approach: The Acidogenicity Values (AV) of the diets were&# 13; determined using an In-vitro essay. Thirty late pregnant multiparous Holstein cows with the average&# 13; yielding of 9800 Kg/year were housed. Three weeks before the expected <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>calving,</b> cows were&# 13; randomly assigned to receive either: (a) High AV (AV 11. 9) diet (n = 16) (b) Low AV (AV 10. 7) diet&# 13; (n= 14). Blood samples were collected from the coccygeal vein once a week at a consistent time after&# 13; morning feeding from d 10 till d 42 postpartum and were analysed for Beta Hydroxybutyrate (BHB),&# 13; Non-Esterified Fatty Acids (NEFAs), glucose and Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN). Milk samples were&# 13; collected from each milking once per week and composited for subsequent analysis of milk&# 13; composition. Results: Overall subsequent milk yield of animals in high AV was higher compared to&# 13; the other group (41. 9 and 37. 8 kg). Although milk fat percentage of the low AV group was higher than&# 13; the other group (3. 7 and 3. 5 %), however there was no significant effect of the diets on milk protein. &# 13; Plasma NEFA and BHBA was reduced significantly in animals receiving the high AV diet. Although&# 13; the concentration of glucose was markedly higher in high AV animals, however the BUN&# 13; concentration was lower compare to the low AV group. Conclusion: The results of the present study&# 13; demonstrated that high grain prepartum diets have dramatic impact on postpartum performance and&# 13; blood metabolic parameters...|$|E
40|$|Because peripartal {{production}} {{diseases are}} prevalent in dairy cows, early recognition is crucial. Several studies reported metabolic variables as risk predictors for subsequent diseases. To improve on-farm testing {{and application of}} those methods, the sampling procedure should take into account variation in gestation length. Furthermore, additional variables indicating cows at risk of any production disease should be sought. Therefore, the objective was to characterize differences between cows with and without postpartum production disease (retained fetal membranes, ketosis, hypocalcemia, abomasal displacement, metritis, mastitis) by prepartum measurement of serum nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) and plasma insulin-like growth factor (IGF) -I concentrations relative to the artificial insemination (AI) that established pregnancy. Blood was collected from 41 Holstein Friesian cows on 235 to 241, 242 to 248, 249 to 255, 256 to 262, 263 to 269, 270 to 276, 277 to 283, and 284 to 290 d after AI. Health status was assessed daily for 3 wk after calving; 25 cows (66 %) {{had at least one}} production disease. Cows developing postpartum diseases had higher mean serum NEFA concentrations (450 ± 26 μmol/L; mean ± SE) and lower plasma IGF-I concentrations (78 ± 6 ng/mL) prepartum compared with healthy cows (259 ± 19 μmol/L and 117 ± 8 ng/mL, respectively). In conclusion, because of substantial variation among cows in gestation length, blood samples should be collected and studies performed on risk prediction relative to AI rather than expected <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>calving.</b> As the somatotropic axis {{is one of the key}} regulators of metabolic adaption for onset of lactation, IGF-I might be a useful variable to differentiate between cows susceptible to production diseases and cows that are able to adapt adequately within the transition period and remain healthy...|$|E
