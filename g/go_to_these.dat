[...] This was contradicted by Script coordinator Cath-Anne Ambrose who said [...] "I had to get Froot Loops cleared , and so the guy calls me back and says, 'Well {{how do you feel}} about Eggo Waffles? Would you consider using Eggo Waffles instead of Froot Loops?' So I <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> guys [...] and ask, 'How do you feel about waffles?' And they're like, 'No! It's Froot Loops! It's a time loop! No!' Waffle sales were down." ...|$|E
500|$|According to the Los Angeles Times, Lewis was {{inspired}} by house parties at Jonathan Wilson's Laurel Canyon home. [...] "We'd <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> jams in the canyon. They're fantastic. Jonathan invites older session musicians from the real Laurel Canyon era, and younger {{people who are just}} starting their bands who happen to live in the canyon, and we all get together and sing Grateful Dead covers and J. J. Cale songs." [...] Lewis herself has said that it [...] "rocks a little harder," [...] in contrast to Rabbit Fur Coats folk rock influences. Lewis also used Rilo Kiley's Under the Blacklight, which was notably polished compared to the band's earlier work, [...] "as a reference point to go in the complete opposite direction". She explained that every song she writes is [...] "a response to the thing that I've written before". [...] "It's even as simple as, 'OK, I've written a ballad, now I want to push myself to write something that's up tempo.' If I'm writing about myself, well, that subject can be tiresome, so then I focus on character-driven songs. So I'm always doing this back-and-forth just to keep myself interested." ...|$|E

500|$|Caribbean Sound Basin housed three {{separate}} studios and several amenities, including a swimming pool, gym, sauna, photographic studio, and bedroom suites. In contrast to most recording studios, its interior was spacious and exposed to natural light. At the studio complex, Raphael, D'wayne, and Riley recorded extensively {{into the night}} {{and went out to}} enjoy the nightlife, before returning to the studio. They often dimmed the lights, burned incense, and drank wine to set the mood when recording, which D'wayne explained in Musician, [...] "We try to make it real calm and mellow. 'Cause {{you want to be able}} to get into what you're singing." [...] They also immersed themselves in the local dancehall scene and attended late-night block parties that lasted until dawn. D'wayne later recalled his nightlife experiences with the group in Maravel: [...] "We'd heard dancehall, but we didn't really know anything about it before going there. We would <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> block parties and you could hear them from almost a mile away. You'd just park on the street and walk to the party along with four or five thousand other people, all partying with these giant speakers all over the place. And this happened just about every weekend." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mr. Bungle {{were known}} for their {{characteristically}} unconventional stage shows, where the band members would dress up in costumes and masks. In {{the early stages of}} their career they would often wear a uniform of mechanic's jumpsuits along with masks such as Madonna, Richard Nixon, Darth Vader, an executioner's hood or plastic clown or gimp masks. Bassist Trevor Dunn claimed that initially the reason for the dressing up was to assure anonymity. Regarding their heavy usage of clown and carnival themes, Trey Spruance explained [...] "The thing is, every now and then while driving around aimlessly as teenagers blasting Sodom’s Obsessed by Cruelty album at 3AM, Patton and I would run across these redneck carnivals popping-up overnight on the periphery of town, in the middle of nowhere. We called them “Satanic Carnivals” due to their unexplained phantasmic arrival, and their pointless neon lights no one was around to appreciate as they sparkled up against the dreary fog. The next night, when they'd be open, we’d actually <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> god-damned things. There was certainly a malice to the toothless meth-heads running the barely-functioning rides, and the fights that would break out among drunken loggers, but it was all pretty standard fare — no evil clowns." ...|$|E
