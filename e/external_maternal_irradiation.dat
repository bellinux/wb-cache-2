40|$|The {{main source}} of data used to assess genetic risks of {{radiation}} exposure for humans has been derived from experiments analysing the male germline, while the effects of <b>maternal</b> <b>irradiation</b> remain poorly understood. This project therefore aims to analyse the long term genetic effects of acute <b>maternal</b> <b>irradiation.</b> To investigate the effects of acute irradiation on genome stability in the germline of directly exposed females, adult BALB/c and CBA/Ca mice were exposed to 1 Gy of acute X-rays and mated with control males 2 - 5 days following exposure, enabling analyses of offspring that were conceived from irradiated dictyate oocytes in maturing follicles. The data revealed that frequency of mutation at expanded simple tandem repeat (ESTR) loci in the germline of directly exposed females {{did not differ from}} that in control families. To address the effect of parental irradiation on transgenerational instability, ESTR mutation frequency was also established in the germline and somatic tissues of first-generation offspring of exposed adult males and females using single-molecule PCR. The breeding scheme used implied that the offspring of irradiated males and females were derived from irradiated post-meiotic stages spermatozoa and meiotically arrested dictyate oocytes in maturing follicles, respectively. While the frequency ESTR mutation in the offspring of irradiated males was significantly elevated, <b>maternal</b> <b>irradiation</b> did not affect the F 1 stability. The results of this project therefore show that, {{in sharp contrast to the}} paternal exposure to ionising radiation, the transgenerational effects of <b>maternal</b> high-dose acute <b>irradiation</b> are likely to be negligible. The analysis of transcription profiles of first-generation offspring of irradiated males and females reveals drastically different patterns of gene expression profiles in both groups. Specifically, a substantial number of genes significantly deregulated in the offspring of irradiated males belong to functional groups directly involved in maintaining the stability of the genome. In contrast, in the offspring of irradiated females none of the significantly deregulated genes can be implicated in the maintenance of genome stability. The work presented here therefore provide new evidence for striking differences in the manifestation of long-term effects of paternal and maternal acute exposure to ionising radiation in mice...|$|R

A 20% increase in microcephaly frequency was seen in children with in-utero radiation exposure during the first trimester of the pregnancy (Miller 1956, 1968). Sensitivity to these radiations was seen to be predominantly high during the 7-15th week of gestation.|$|R

40|$|The seed {{biology of}} two ecologically and genetically {{important}} sympatric wild rice species from northern Australia was compared – perennial Oryza rufipogon Griff. and annual Oryza meridionalis N. Q. Ng. The {{aim was to}} determine mechanisms of dormancy exhibited at seed shed and to identify factors that trigger or inhibit germination. This information was used to investigate the ecology of in situ Oryza populations in introduced para grass swards (Urochloa mutica (Forssk.) T. Q. Nguyen) and to understand interactions between the two sympatric Oryza species. Primary dormancy in the two species is similar, namely, non-deep physiological dormancy, determined by <b>external</b> <b>maternal</b> structures and broken by warm temperature treatments equivalent to dry season soil temperatures. Light quality, smoke water, gibberellic acid and nitric acid treatments had minor influences on germination. Changes to the soil profile and aboveground biomass structure due to swards of U. mutica significantly affected emergence of O. meridionalis. Thus the influence of soil temperature explains the results of previous field studies in which biomass or litter on the soil surface prevented germination. This has implications for biodiversity management on monsoonal floodplains of northern Australia, where introduced pasture species produce greater biomass than native grasslands, reduce soil temperatures and are displacing native rices. There were differences between the Oryza species – dormancy was more quickly broken in annual O. meridionalis, reflecting the reduced need for investment in seed bank persistence for annual species in annually inundated and climatically reliable wetlands...|$|R
40|$|Scarlett of Gone {{with the}} Wind by Margaret Mitchell and Sethe from Toni Morrison's Beloved at first seem like two starkly {{different}} characters, aside from living {{during the same}} period. Scarlett is a white Southern belle, while Sethe, a black woman, is a slave, but both women {{live in a society}} that restricts them because of their gender. And both are judged by their peers for their mothering choices. Although they both have three children and mother outside their society's ideas on how to raise them, Sethe's act of infanticide receives attention from both her peers and critics, while Scarlett's quiet, reserved love towards her children is judged harshly by society but receives little attention from critics. Exploration of their mothering in these novels reveals that what is criticized in both cases is actually the kind of mothering that both women have been taught by their own mothers. / Even though they come from opposite social standings, both of these characters struggle to raise their children in response to the maternal influences in their own lives. Although Scarlett is born into a wealthy family, she has fewer choices as a mother than one may think a member of the Southern aristocracy would. Conversely, Sethe, who is born into slavery, seeks freedom in order to mother her children on her terms. Both women are also influenced by <b>external</b> <b>maternal</b> influences upon their own mothering roles, and their maternal guides are not positive. Scarlett learns to reserve her love from her mother and shows her love for her children through hard work and feeding her family. Sethe has various maternal models that all teach her violence as a form of love, which she goes on to use against her own children in an attempt to save them from slavery. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{investigation}} {{aimed at}} assessing levels {{of exposure to}} cadmium, lead and mercury, and the related imminent risks for women of reproductive age and upcoming children due to perinatal exposure. Study was conducted on in total 406 healthy women who gave birth at term by vaginal delivery in a clinical hospital in Zagreb. We measured the concentrations of toxic metals and essential micronutrients iron, zinc, copper, and selenium in placental tissue, maternal venous blood, and umbilical cord blood using standard analytical techniques (AAS and ICP-MS) in relation to cigarette smoking and dietary habit. In placentas of smokers vs. non-smokers, cadmium doubled; lead increased, birth weight, length and placental ratio decreased, and both metals negatively correlated with birth weights. Zinc increased, and iron and copper did not change. In maternal blood of smokers, cadmium was {{twice as high as}} in non-smokers and correlated with smoking in pregnancy. Cadmium in cord blood was about ten times lower regardless of exposure to tobacco smoke. There were no differences between smoking and non-smoking in lead concentrations in maternal and cord blood, as well as in iron, zinc, copper and selenium in maternal and cord serum. Mercury in maternal and cord blood and selenium in maternal and cord serum increased linearly with dietary intake of fish. Levels of progesterone and estradiol were assayed in placental tissue ex vivo (using enzyme-immunometric method), correlated, and no differences were found in relation to tobacco smoke exposure. We confirmed that human placenta presents a useful and unique tissue sample in human biological monitoring of <b>external</b> <b>maternal</b> and internal environment for foetal development. Exposure levels to toxic metals in women of Zagreb metropolitan area and Zagreb County are similar to those in other big cities in continental parts of Europe, and do not pose a serious threat for unborn child. Tobacco smoke exposure, due to cadmium accumulation, may have adverse effects on placental function in essential micronutrient transport – as we showed for zinc – with consequent decreases in birth weight and birth length...|$|R

40|$|Summary. Ovariectomy and/or {{adrenalectomy}} of guinea-pigs did {{not significantly}} affect the plasma concentration oftotal unconjugated oestro-gens throughout pregnancy when compared to intact animals. This indicates that oestrogen production in the pregnant guinea-pig is predo-minantly extra-ovarian. The plasma concentrations of progesterone in animals ovariectomized between Day 3 and Day 5 post coitum (p. c.) and treated with Norgestrel to maintain pregnancy increased appreciably only after Day 30 p. c., and rose to levels {{not significantly different from}} those in animals ovariectomized later in pregnancy or in intact controls. This confirms the findings of other workers that the secretion of pro-gesterone by extra-ovarian sites (the placentae) is important only {{during the second half of}} gestation. In Norgestrel-treated animals, masculiniza-tion of the <b>maternal</b> <b>external</b> genitalia was not seen during pregnancy but developed within 5 days after parturition...|$|R
40|$|A diverse {{microbial}} population colonizes the sterile mammalian gastrointestinal tract {{during and after}} the birth. There is increasing evidence that this complex microbiome plays {{a crucial role in the}} development of the mucosal immune system and influences newborn health. Microbial colonization is a complex process influenced by a two-way interaction between host and microbes and a variety of <b>external</b> factors, including <b>maternal</b> microbiota, birth process, diet, and antibiotics. Following this initial colonization, continuous exposure to host-specific microbes is not only essential for development and maturation of the mucosal immune system but also the nutrition and health of the animal. Thus, it is important to understand host-microbiome interactions within the context of individual animal species and specific management practices. Data is now being generated revealing significant associations between the early microbiome, development of the mucosal immune system, and the growth and health of newborn calves. The current review focuses on recent information and discusses the limitation of current data and the potential challenges to better characterizing key host-specific microbial interactions. We also discuss potential strategies that may be used to manipulate the early microbiome to improve production and health during the time when newborn calves are most susceptible to enteric disease...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} and re-estimate the effects of breastfeeding patterns, women's nutritional and health status, and energy expenditure on the timing of resumption of postpartum fecundability (i. e. resumption of postpartum menses) using all the relevant information in the Instituto de Nutrición de Centroamérica y Panamá longitudinal study and a more adequate estimation procedure (hazard models). The data used in this study come from a Longitudinal Study carried out in Guatemala between 1967 and 1979. In this article we use a multi-state hazard model that recognizes different pathways and states in the process of returning to the postpartum fecundability. The model relies on the existence of five states (fully breastfeeding, partial breastfeeding, weaning, infant mortality and menses). It also includes explicitly maternal nutrition and women's energy expenditure as strategic elements of the model. The study shows that the estimated effects of breastfeeding patterns, maternal nutrition and women's work patterns (energy expenditure) on resumption of fecundability in rural Guatemala are strong and significant. The contribution of this paper is to show that application of hazard models with multiple states provides estimates that are consistent with hypotheses relating lactation patterns, maternal nutritional status and <b>maternal</b> <b>external</b> stressors to processes tha...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundOne unique {{concern of}} {{vascular}} surgeons and trainees is radiation exposure {{associated with increased}} endovascular practice. The safety of childbearing is a particular worry for current and future women in vascular surgery. Little is known regarding actual fetal radiation exposure. This multi-institutional study aimed to evaluate the radiation dosages recorded on fetal dosimeter badges and compare them to external badges worn by the same cohort of women. MethodsAll women who declared pregnancy with potential radiation exposure were required to wear two radiation monitors at each institution, one outside and the other inside the lead apron. <b>Maternal</b> (<b>external)</b> and fetal monitor dosimeter readings were analyzed. Maternal radiation exposures prior to, during, and postpregnancy were also assessed to determine any associated behavior modification. ResultsEighty-one women declared pregnancy from 2008 to 2011 and 32 had regular radiation exposure during pregnancy. Maternal whole-body exposures ranged from 21 - 731 mrem. The average fetal dosimeter recordings for the cohort rounded to zero. Only two women had positive fetal dosimeter recordings; one had a single recording of 3 mrem and the other had a single recording of 7 mrem. There {{was no significant difference}} between maternal exposures prior to, during, and postpregnancy. ConclusionsLack of knowledge of fetal radiation exposure has concerned many vascular surgeons, prompting them to wear double lead aprons during pregnancy, and perhaps prevented numerous other women from entering the field. Our study showed negligible radiation exposure on fetal monitoring suggesting that with the appropriate safety precautions, these concerns may be unwarranted...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} was to test a model for the prediction and identification of paternal risk factors. Forty seven couples expecting their first child were the subjects. Questionnaires which assessed paternal expectations regarding parenthood and prenatal marital satisfaction were administered in the third trimester of their wife 2 ̆ 7 s pregnancy. Two months postpartum, a second questionnaire was administered which included measures of paternal violated expectations, paternal postpartum marital satisfaction, paternal stress, infant temperament, maternal marital satisfaction, maternal postpartum depression, the presence of <b>external</b> support and <b>maternal</b> change in employment status. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to identify which variables significantly predicted the presence of postpartum paternal stress. In general, two hypotheses were supported. Paternal postpartum stress was predicted by (1) higher quality of paternal marital satisfaction assessed prenatally, and (2) infants 2 ̆ 7 whose temperaments were paternally assessed as slowly adaptable, less persistent, and more distractable. Statistically significant bivariate correlations were also identified among the predictor variables. Paternal prenatal marital satisfaction was positively correlated with maternal and paternal postpartum marital satisfaction, and a higher incidence of paternal violated expectations. A higher quality of maternal marital satisfaction was correlated with a lower incidence of maternal postpartum depression. Various infant temperament subscales were correlated with other temperament subscales and with some of the predictor variables.

40|$|Background: The {{degree of}} Maternal and Child Health (MCH) {{is still a}} major problem in health {{development}} in Indonesia. Onefactor that may be an obstacle in solving this problem is thelimited cost. In this context, planning and cost utilization areessential to improve so that they can produce a great impactfor the improvement of MCH. Therefore, in-depth informationabout the MCH financing situation in regions as an input todevelop efficient activities in improving MCH status is needed. Objective: To analyze health financing situation of MCH programin 2010 which sourced from government and to make policyrecommendations related to the program in Sabu Raijua District,East Nusa Tenggara Province. The situation in question isavailability, budget planning process, expenditure accuracy,and fund flow rate. Method: This was a descriptive research with a case studystrategy. Result: The total cost of MCH program was IDR 450, 787, 500. It was not sufficient to provide basic health services forpregnant women from early pregnancy until postpartum period. The budget proportion from the central, provincial, and districtgovernments amounted to 79. 63 %, 3. 56 %, and 16. 78 %,respectively. Cost allocation of the district budget was 0. 80 %. Planning activities of MCH program was from the district budgetthrough the development planning meeting (Musrenbang). Proposed activities in Musrenbang were dominated by physicalactivities. The cost of MCH program was spent more on directactivities and operational cost in villages and sub districts. Theimplementation of the activities was not supported by facilitiesand adequate human resources. The MCH fund disbursementfrom the central government was conducted in October-November while from the provincial and district governmentswere in July to August. Conclusion: The governments commitment was still low infinancing MCH program as a priority program due to budgetdecentralization. Musrenbang activities had not demonstratedsignificant impacts on quality activities improvement and budgetallocations from the district budget. Availability of personneland health facilities greatly affected the performance of MCHprogram.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} pregnancy outcome, {{risk factors}} for pregnancy complications, genital infections among pregnant women, health seeking behavior and causes of deaths among women of reproductive age in a low income country. Methods: Risk factors and pregnancy outcomes were studied prospectively in a cohort comprising 8 % of all pregnant women registered for antenatal care (ANC) in the county of Praia, Cape Verde. The specific materrial and fetal {{risk factors for}} perinatal death were assessed in an area-based case-control study in the same area. In a cross-sectional survey, 350 subjectively healthy pregnant women in the Praia county were examined to assess the prevalence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG), Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Bacterial vaginosis. Different laboratory techniques, including PCR method, were used to detect CT and NG. Sociodemographic risk factors for genital infections were investigated. Through verbal autopsy lay persons were interviewed regarding the perceived causes and contributing factors of a death of {{a family member or}} friend. Thereby, and using hospital data when available, the cause of death of fertile age women was assessed, and the theoretical avoidability estimated. This study comprised 80 % of the Cape Verde's female population. Results: Adverse outcome complicated 32 % of the pregnancies, low birth weight (LBW) 9 %, and preterm birth 13 %. Alleged risk factors were registered in 74 % of all pregnancies, high risk factors in 9 %. Eighty-three percent of the affected, and 70 % of the unaffected pregnancies, had presented risk factors. Young age, nulliparity, and previous LBW infant associated significantly with LBW. Previous hypertension and seizures related to preterm birth. The perinatal mortality rate was 37 - 46 per 1, 000 births. First pregnancy, previous hypertensive disease, previous perinatal death, pre-eclampsia, breech delivery, male infant, and postpartum maternal fever were significantly associated with perinatal death. The detection rates of NG, CT, and BV were 5 %, 13 % and 31 %, respectively. PCR technique yielded higher detection rates than did microscopy and culture (NG), or direct immuno-fluorescence (CT). Young age and currently living alone were significant risk factors for infection. Common diagnoses among deceased fertile age women were cardiovascular disorders, <b>external</b> causes, <b>maternal</b> causes, infectious diseases and neoplasms. The maternal mortality ratio (MMR) was 127 per 100, 000 live births. The vast majority of severely ill female patients were treated at the appropriate health service level, but 17 % delayed their arrival to a health facility intentionally. Conclusions: The studied ANC risk classification is not effective. Several significant risk factors were demonstrated, but the sample sizes prohibited the assessment of rare risk factors. Preterm births, postpartum matemal fever and high prevalence of chlamydial genital infection raise suspicions of widespread genital infections in the pregnant population. Routine genital examinations of pregnant women, and laboratory facilities for CT detection are recommended. The MMR was three times higher than estimated, due to misclassification. Future surveys on maternal deaths need to investigate all female deaths in the reproductive ages. Traffic accidents and gender violence are public health matters of importance.

40|$|Abstract Background Maternal {{mortality}} remains poorly researched in Africa, and {{is likely}} to worsen dramatically as a consequence of HIV/AIDS. Methods The 2001 census of South Africa included a question on deaths in the previous 12 months, and two questions on <b>external</b> causes and <b>maternal</b> mortality, defined as "pregnancy-related deaths". A microdata sample from the census permits researchers to assess levels and differentials in maternal mortality, in a country severely affected by high death rates from HIV/AIDS and from external causes. Results After correcting for several minor biases, our estimate of the Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) in 2001 was 542 per 100, 000 live births. This level is much higher than previous estimates dating from pre-HIV/AIDS times. This high level occurred despite a relatively low proportion of maternal deaths (6. 4 %) among deaths of women aged 15 – 49 years, and was due to the astonishingly high level of adult mortality, some 4. 7 times higher than expected from mortality below age 15 or above age 50. The main reasons for these excessive levels were HIV/AIDS and external causes of deaths. Our regional estimates of MMR were found to be consistent with other findings in the Cape Town area, and with the Agincourt DSS. The differentials in MMR were considerable: 1 to 9. 2 for population groups (race), 1 to 3. 2 for provinces, and 1 to 2. 4 for levels of education. Relationship with income and wealth were complex, with highest values for middle income and middle wealth index. The effect of urbanization was small, and reversed in a multivariate analysis. Higher risks in provinces were not necessarily associated with lower income, lower education or higher proportions of home delivery, but correlated primarily with the prevalence of HIV/AIDS. Conclusion Demographic census microdata offer the opportunity to conduct an epidemiologic analysis of maternal mortality. In the case of South Africa, the level of MMR increased dramatically over the past 10 years, most likely because of HIV/AIDS. Indirect causes of maternal deaths appear much more important than direct obstetric causes. The MMR appears no longer to be a reliable measure of the quality of obstetric care or a measure of safe motherhood. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Multi-attribute utility {{measures}} are preference-based health-related {{quality of life}} measures {{that have been developed}} to inform economic evaluations of health care interventions. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare the empirical validity of two multi-attribute utility measures (EQ- 5 D and SF- 6 D) based on hypothetical preferences in a large maternity population in England. Methods Women who participated in a randomised controlled trial of additional postnatal support provided by trained community support workers represented the study population for this investigation. The women were asked to complete the EQ- 5 D descriptive system (which defines health-related quality of life in terms of five dimensions: mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression) and the SF- 36 (which defines health-related quality of life, using 36 items, across eight dimensions: physical functioning, role limitations (physical), social functioning, bodily pain, general health, mental health, vitality and role limitations (emotional)) at six months postpartum. Their responses were converted into utility scores using the York A 1 tariff set and the SF- 6 D utility algorithm, respectively. One-way analysis of variance was used to test the hypothetically-constructed preference rule that each set of utility scores differs significantly by self-reported health status (categorised as excellent, very good, good, fair or poor). The degree to which EQ- 5 D and SF- 6 D utility scores reflected alternative dichotomous configurations of self-reported health status and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale score was tested using the relative efficiency statistic and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Results The mean utility score for the EQ- 5 D was 0. 861 (95 % CI: 0. 844, 0. 877), whilst the mean utility score for the SF- 6 D was 0. 809 (95 % CI: 0. 796, 0. 822), representing a mean difference in utility score of 0. 052 (95 % CI: 0. 040, 0. 064; p p p Conclusion This study provides evidence that the SF- 6 D is an empirically valid and efficient alternative multi-attribute utility measure to the EQ- 5 D, and is capable of discriminating between <b>external</b> indicators of <b>maternal</b> health. </p...|$|R

Methods: Cannulas {{were placed in the}} <b>maternal</b> <b>external</b> jugular and the fetal internal jugular and carotid artery in 8 pregnant monkeys at 120 - 130 days gestation. ZDV (3. 5 mg/kg) was administered to 5 monkeys and ZDVG (3. 5 mg/kg) to 3 monkeys as single intravenous bolus infusions through the maternal catheter. Maternal and fetal blood samples were collected every 20 min for the first 2 h and then every hour for the next 4 h. Maternal and fetal concentrations ofZDV and ZDVG were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with ultraviolet (UV) detection. Results: In monkeys who received ZDV, the terminal half-life (T 1 / 2) for ZDV was 37 -+ 15 and 33 -+ 13 min in the maternal and fetal compartments, respectively. The apparent T 1 / 2 for maternal ZDVG was 124 + _ 44 and 142 +- 50 min in the maternal and fetal compartments, respectively. Peak levels of ZDV and ZDVG in the fetal compartment were reached 40 min after injection. The mean fetal/maternal concentration ratios for ZDV and ZDVG ranged from 0. 20 -+ 0. 20 at 20 min to a maximum of 0. 74 + 1. 0 at 120 min and from 0. 28 + 0. 08 at 20 min to 1. 4 _+ 1. 3 at 180 min, respectively. In monkeys who received ZDVG, the T 1 / 2 for ZDVG in the maternal and fetal compartments was 47 _+ 26 and 119 _+ 164 min, respectively. ZDVG reached its peak in the fetal compartment at 60 min post-injection. The fetal/maternal ratio ranged from 0. 08 -+ 0. 11 at 20 min to 4. 2 -+ 4. 2 at 180 min post-injection. Conclusions: These data demonstrate that 1) ZDV and ZDVG rapidly cross the placenta to the fetal compartment, 2) ZDV crosses more rapidly than ZDVG, and 3) some metabolism of ZDV to ZDVG occurs in the fetal compartment.

40|$|Background: Verbal autopsy (VA) is {{a health}} {{surveillance}} technique used in low and middle-income countries to establish medical {{causes of death}} (CODs) for people who die outside hospitals and/or without registration. By virtue of the deaths it investigates, VA is also an opportunity to examine social exclusion from access to health systems. The aims were to develop a system to collect and interpret information on social and health systems determinants of deaths investigated in VA. Methods: A short set of questions on care pathways, circumstances and events at and {{around the time of}} death were developed and integrated into the WHO 2012 short form VA (SF-VA). Data were subsequently analysed from two census rounds in the Agincourt Health and Socio-Demographic Surveillance Site (HDSS), South Africa in 2012 and 2013 where the SF-VA had been applied. InterVA and descriptive analysis were used to calculate cause-specific mortality fractions (CSMFs), and to examine responses to the new indicators and whether and how they varied by medical CODs and age/sex sub-groups. Results: One thousand two hundred forty-nine deaths were recorded in the Agincourt HDSS censuses in 2012 – 13 of which 1, 196 (96  %) had complete VA data. Infectious and non-communicable conditions accounted for the majority of deaths (47  % and 39  % respectively) with smaller proportions attributed to <b>external,</b> neonatal and <b>maternal</b> causes (5  %, 2  % and 1  % respectively). 5  % of deaths were of indeterminable cause. The new indicators revealed multiple problems with access to care at the time of death: 39  % of deaths did not call for help, 36  % found care unaffordable overall, and 33  % did not go to a facility. These problems were reported consistently across age and sex sub-groups. Acute conditions and younger age groups had fewer problems with overall costs but more with not calling for help or going to a facility. An illustrative health systems interpretation suggests extending and promoting existing provisions for transport and financial access in this setting. Conclusions: Supplementing VA with questions on the circumstances of mortality provides complementary information to CSMFs relevant for health planning. Further contextualisation of the method and results are underway with health systems stakeholders to develop the interpretation sequence as part of a health policy and systems research approach.
