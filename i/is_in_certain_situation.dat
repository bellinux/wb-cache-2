40|$|The {{apparent}} `fractal' {{properties of}} TCP data traffic have recently attracted considerable interest. Most prominently, fractional Brownian motion (FBM) {{has been used}} to model the long range dependence of traffic traces through self-similarity. Traffic being by nature a process of positive increments, though, a multifractal approach appears more natural. In this study, various traces of TCP traffic have been analyzed from both points of view. Though evidence for statistical self-similarity <b>is</b> present <b>in</b> <b>certain</b> `aspects' of the traffic, the multifractal scaling behavior is much more convincing. Furthermore, crucial LAN specific characteristics of data traffic are revealed by the multifractal analysis (MA) only. TCP traffic at Berkeley and at CNET, e. g., looks entirely different from a multifractal point of view while showing about the same self-similarity parameter H. As a further example, MA suggests that Lévy stable motion <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>certain</b> <b>situations</b> a more accurate model than FBM. In [...] ...|$|R
