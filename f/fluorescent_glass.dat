The fluorescence intensity of the prepared composite resin increased with increase of Eu 2 O 3 content in the glass filler and with filler/resin ratio in the resin. Despite the clear fluorescence, the effect of Eu 2 O 3 on the color change of composite resin was quite small - even when up to 10 wt% Eu 2 O 3 was added to the glass filler.

The exposure doses of the left and right lenses were 3. 13 mGy for the left lens and 3. 22 mGy for the right lens. An exponential dose reduction to the distance from PTV was confirmed.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that surface {{properties}} at nano-scale are determinant in a number of applications, such as sensors, biomedical and optical devices. Nevertheless, relations between surface treatment parameters and their effects on topography at the nano-scale, surface energy or light reflectivity are often poorly understood. In this study, a non <b>fluorescent</b> <b>glass</b> material (Knittel) was selected and subjected to ion implantation treatments with different parameters and species, including Ar, Ne, C, N, CO and NH 2. The resulting surface topography at the nano-scale was studied by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and the surface energy was evaluated with the contact angle method. Additionally, the modifications induced on optical properties, i. e. reflection, were evaluated with two different wavelength lasers. The results showed remarkable differences in surface nano-topographies and contact angles (from 15 ° to 70 °) that were obtained. Furthermore, the effects of ion implantation parameters had also very significant consequences on background noise effects, of great importance for optical properties. It was found that the best implantation treatment corresponded to N 2 + ions implanted to a dose of 3 × 1017 ions/cm 2 at an energy of 30 keV. This treatment resulted in a adequate contact angle, producing a nano-textured surface with potential features for a good attachment and orientation of deposited bio-molecules, and a very low background fluorescence, hence allowing a high degree of scanning sensitivity, for application on DNA microarrays.

This dissertation focuses on green chemistry methods to replace existing techniques of metal treatment as well as treated or untreated metal surface analysis and low-temperature sol-gel preparation of a fluorescent frequency converter. Conventional metal surface pretreatments frequently use some form of chromium (VI), a carcinogen. Several chrome-free metal pretreatments were formulated using the sol-gel process. These sol-gel pretreatments were thin, showed extensive crosslinking (6 H+ hardness on cold-rolled steel), and performed comparably to the chromated pretreatment in corrosion tests as well as outperforming the chromated pretreatment in electrochemical impedance testing (10 7 ohm cm 2 greater at 10 mHz). Galvanized steel is frequently treated with a chromate conversion coating, another source of chromium (VI). An antifingerprint primer (AFP) was developed using aqueous emulsions of organic resins, water, organic HAPs (hazardous air pollutants) -free cosolvents, and corrosion inhibitors. AFP test panels passed alkali resistance testing (no coating removed in 2 wt% sodium phosphate solution at 65 °C for 2 min) followed by salt spray testing (< 5 % surface corrosion after 120 h in 35 °C, 98 % humidity, 5 wt% salt spray). Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) was investigated as a possible tool for qualitative determination of metal alloys and their pretreatments. It was shown that this method could be used to distinguish between three aluminum alloys (2024 -T 3 /bare, 2024 -T 3 /clad, and 7075 -T 6) as well as to distinguish between an untreated aluminum surface, a chromated surface, and a chrome-free AFP coating.

The coating increased the temperature at which significant oxidation of the iron particles occurred by about 20 [...] 30 °C while not affecting the interior structure of the iron particles. <b>Fluorescent</b> <b>glass</b> can be formed by doping the glass with a fluorescent material at high (∼ 1500 °C) temperatures.

40|$|Concrete as {{a primary}} {{building}} construction material is the most consumed man-made material {{in the world and}} also {{is one of the most}} consuming landfills waste materials. Production of cement (hydraulic binder) is an energy-intensive and highly polluting process which contributes about 5 - 8 % to global CO 2 emissions and accounts for 3 % of total (5 % of industrial) energy consumption worldwide. The aggregates constitute approximately 80 % of concrete volume. The disposal of the construction and demolition (C&D) waste is becoming increasingly difficult and expensive and also environmental concerns are increasingly limiting the option of landfilling such waste. Recycled aggregate is a valuable resource; value-added consumption of recycled aggregate, as replacement for virgin aggregate in concrete, can yield significant energy and environmental benefits. Glass is also one of the most popular materials due to progressive growth of urbanization nowadays. Disposal of glass waste and especially of non-recycled waste glass is a complex problem for many countries in the world. Waste glass as powder milled to certain surface specific area in order to accelerate beneficial chemical reactions in concrete offers desired chemical composition and reactivity for use it as a supplementary cementitious material (SCM) for enhancing the chemical stability, pore system characteristics, moisture resistance and durability of concrete. The beneficial effects of milled waste glass can enhance the residual cement occurring on the surface of recycled aggregates, thus improving the performance characteristics of recycled aggregate concrete (Nassar and Soroushian, 2012). In present study is investigated the approach of optimized utilization of concrete aggregate wastes (CAW) in concrete. An experimental study was carried out to investigate the effects on the mechanical properties of concrete with CAW obtained from crushed concrete specimens (from previous studies with cement substitution at level of 30 % with waste borosilicate (DRL) glass chippings obtained from fluorescent lamps and ground into powder with specific surface area of 2310 cm 2 /g, waste glass suspension and coal/wood ashes (Kara, 2012)) after they have been stored as concrete waste. A total of 15 different concrete mixes were prepared. Concrete cubes’ strength tests were carried out after 7, 28, 56, 84 and 112 days.

The packing density of cementious materials is an important property governing the rheological and strength performance of the cement paste.
