40|$|As urban {{population}} is expanding constantly, {{the construction of}} <b>edifices</b> on the earthquake active area is also increasing. Due to aesthetic appearance, most of the <b>edifices</b> in the present era are asymmetric in nature. But when symmetric <b>edifices</b> are subjected to earthquake, their behaviors are not complex as compared to asymmetric <b>edifices.</b> Hence, for safety purpose, there is need to study the complex behavior of asymmetric <b>edifices</b> by conducting performance evaluation. In the present study, the performance evaluation of four RC <b>edifices</b> is done using N 2 method. An effort is made to calculate the correction factors for displacements {{to account for the}} effect of torsion.

5|$|In {{countries}} like Canada {{it is possible}} that small precursor earthquake swarms might go undetected, particularly if no events were observed; more significant events in larger swarms would be detected but only a minor subdivision of the swarm events would be complex to clarify them with confidence as volcanic in nature, or even associate them with an individual volcanic <b>edifice.</b>|$|E
5|$|In late 1984, geologists {{noticed that}} seismic {{activity}} in the area had begun to increase. Increased fumarole activity, deposition of sulfur on {{the summit of the}} volcano, and phreatic eruptions also alerted geologists to the possibility of an eruption. Phreatic events, when rising magma encounters water, continued well into September 1985 (one major event took place on September 11, 1985), shooting steam high into the air. Activity began to decline in October, probably because the new magma had finished ascending into Nevado del Ruiz's volcanic <b>edifice.</b>|$|E
