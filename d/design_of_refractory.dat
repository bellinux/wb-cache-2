Illustration is focused on the case of SiC-based refractory lining used in Waste to Energy Plant (WTEP). A multi-physical coupled analysis is proposed to elaborate degradation roots and to build a dedicated thermo-chemo-mechanical model. This model accounts for the reactive transport of oxygen through the gases within the porosity, and for the swelling and porosity clogging up induced by SiC oxidation. Two geometries of lining tiles are modeled and a computation of one year in-service is performed. It is demonstrated that the simulations reproduce well the localization of the degradations and allow highlighting the geometry effects on the lining behavior...|$|E

This work also sheds light on the unresolved controversy of possible phase transition before melting and identifies specific mechanisms responsible for the material’s high melting point. This study benefits {{from the use of}} two very recent techniques: (i) a new small-cell coexistence method that enables the accurate and efficient determination of the melting points from ab initio calculations alone; (ii) the experimental determination of solid structure at high temperatures by high-temperature synchrotron X-ray diffraction of laser-heated aerodynamically levitated samples...|$|E
40|$|Thermal shock {{resistance}} {{is a key}} property <b>of</b> <b>refractory</b> materials. Its determination and prediction {{is essential for the}} <b>design</b> <b>of</b> structural <b>refractories</b> as well as lining materials. Young’s modulus of elasticity (E) is a crucial parameter for the calculation of thermal {{shock resistance}}. For all investigated carbon-bonded alumina composition a significant increase of E was observed. This increase was attributed to a mismatch of the coefficient of thermal expansion of the composite constituents. Besides others, the graphite content as well as the maximum alumina particle size were identified as crucial factors influencing E(T). Furthermore, the influence of the porosity on E was shown and existing models were fitted to the experimental data for future predictions of E. Finally a metal melt filter structure was investigated to investigate the relationship between its strut Young’s modulus and the structures’ E at high temperatures. Further research should address the filter topic since it was uncertain how to find the normal modes of those structures...|$|R
40|$|A {{steady-state}} finite-difference {{heat transfer}} mathematical model was derived {{to determine the}} temperature distribution in the metal layer and the hearth of a cylindrical electrical-resistance smelter. The temperature distribution {{is required for the}} redesign <b>of</b> the <b>refractory</b> materials and their positions in the hearth to insure that the metal layer is kept molten at normal smelting temperatures and that mechanical and structural integrity of the hearth is maintained. An extensive literature search revealed that no previously defined model of this type existed and that consideration of a three-dimensional model was {{beyond the scope of this}} work. The literature search also verified that the metal layer and the hearth could be modeled independently of the slag layer. The finite-difference heat transfer model was then developed by defining nine different types of nodes in the model and deriving steady-state heat transfer equations for each type of node. An algorithm was then developed for the solution of the non linear dependent set of simultaneous equations. Beyond the scope of this work, ninety percent of a Fortran 11 77 computer program was written and compiled employing the algorithm. It is recommended that the computer program be finished, debugged, and that various combinations <b>of</b> <b>refractory</b> material types and positions be tried to determine the optimum <b>design</b> <b>of</b> the <b>refractory</b> hearth.

40|$|International audienceThe {{mechanical}} properties of refractory castables {{at room temperature}} are critical parameters for selecting suitable operating conditions for the structural <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>refractory</b> components. In this work, high alumina refractory castables based on the alumina-rich zone of the Al 2 O 3 -MgO-CaO ternary phase equilibrium diagram were prepared by adding synthetic spinel, periclase and dolomite via three processing routes. Bending strength studies at room temperature under several thermal treatments and {{the analysis of the}} elastic modulus of the refractories and their matrices point to two different mechanical behaviours. From room temperature to 1000 °C the refractory castables present a pronounced non-linear stress-strain behaviour both in the uniaxial tensile and compressive modes, as a result of damage to the microcrack network. Above 1000 °C the refractory castables begin to sinter owing to a transitory liquid phase, the crystallization of calcium aluminate cement phases (such as CA 2 and CA 6, for example) and the self-forming spinel phase (refractory castables with periclase or dolomite additions).

40|$|International audienceMany {{refractory}} linings {{of structures}} used in steel making industry {{are made of}} masonries containing joints with or without mortar between bricks. These joints {{play an important role}} in the thermo-mechanical behaviour of the masonry. So, it is necessary to take them into account during a numerical computation of a structure containing a refractory masonry. Since such masonries are built with hundreds of bricks, it is very time expensive to model each joint and each brick in a finite element computation. Therefore, the masonries are modelled by a homogeneous material that has a behaviour equivalent to that of the set of brick and joint. The thermo-mechanical properties of this equivalent material were determined using a periodic homogenization method. They are temperature dependent and depend also on the joint states (open or closed in the two directions). This approach was used in different applications: - A simplified steel ladle to show the influence of different parameters: presence or not of joints, dry joints/mortar joints, thickness of mortar joints, masonry design (parallel, fish bone or radial), refractory material properties, - A hearth of a blast furnace to determine the stresses in the outer steel shell, - A heating wall of a coke oven to determine the maximum pressure that the coal can apply on it during cocking.

40|$|Refractory {{materials}} used in various areas of the {{iron and steel industry}} need to face severe challenges to meet critical operational parameters at high temperatures. Hence, the attention of refractory manufacturers has shifted towards unshaped refractories to substitute for conventional and shaped ones. Castables lead in all the areas among the different unshaped refractories. Refractory castables (which are used by casting method) are premixed combinations of refractory grain, matrix components, bonding agents, and additives. The proportions are varied accordingly to achieve the desired properties. Again flowability of the castables is very important for application (casting) purposes and their final performances. Better flow of any castable allows making a good lining and makes it possible too line an intricate shape. This flowability is dependent on the particle size distribution and packing of the castable system. But better flowing mass may indicate higher sphericity of particles, resulting lower strength, which is not acceptable for refractory application. Hence <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>refractory</b> castable system is challenging as it required opposing character of flowability with higher strengths. The present work targets to study the development of refractory castable system with particle size distribution (PSD) as per well-known Dinger Funk model for continuous distribution and study the developed properties of the castables for their flowability and various characteristics developed at different temperatures...|$|E

In this paper, biooxidation <b>of</b> <b>refractory</b> gold ore by mixed moderate thermophiles culture in airlift bioreactor {{has been well}} studied. Firstly, a laboratory scale airlift bioreactor unit has been designed for bacterial preoxidation <b>of</b> <b>refractory</b> gold ore, a mixed moderate thermophilic culture was incubated. The orthogonal experiment was performed to investigate the effects of particle size, pulp density, aeration rate and initial pH. The results showed that when particle size 37 micrometer，pulp density 5 %，aeration rate 4 dm 3 ·s- 1 and initial pH 1. 2, the arsenic leaching rate achieved to 93. 5 %. On {{the base of the}} airlift bioreactor unit, a continuous airlift bioreactor was <b>designed.</b> The preoxidation <b>of</b> <b>refractory</b> gold ore by a mixed culture of moderately thermophilic bacteria also was investigated in this equipment.

40|$|Rigid fibrous {{refractory}} insulations (TPS tiles) {{are integral}} components of many spacecraft thermal protection systems. These materials {{are composed of}} refractory fibers With diameters {{on the order of}} 1 to 15 micrometers. They are lightweight and have an open, highly porous microstructure. Typical densities are less than 500 kilograms per cubic meters, and porosities generally exceed 0. 8. Because of their open porosity, these materials are permeable to gas glow. There are numerous instances in which internal gas transport in a thermal protection system could be important; examples include the penetration of hot boundary-layer gases into the insulation, the flow of decomposition (pyrolysis) products from the interior, the use of convective flows to mitigate ice formation caused by cryopumping, and the <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>refractory</b> vents for pressure equilibration during atmospheric entry. Computational analysis of gas flow through porous media requires values of permeability which have not previously been available for the rigid fibrous insulations used in thermal protection systems. This paper will document measurements of permeability for a variety of insulations from NASA's LI, FRCI, and AETB families of lightweight ceramic ablators. The directional anisotropy of permeability and its dependence on gas pressure and material density will be presented. It will be shown that rarified-flow effects are significant in the flow through such materials. Connections will be drawn between the insulation microstructure and permeability. The paper will also include representative computations of flow through rigid fibrous insulations...|$|E
40|$|High-entropy alloys (HEAs) are {{described}} as alloys containing multi-principal elements in equal or close to equal atomic percentage. HEAs are considered as potential structural materials for high-temperature applications; where alloy design and optimization of mechanical properties is extremely critical. In this regard, achieving both high strength and high tensile ductility is still a great challenge. Compared to conventional alloys, HEAs have high configurational entropy, which tends to stabilize the solid solution formation, mainly face-centered-cubic (fcc) and/or body-centered-cubic (bcc) solid solutions. Generally, fcc-type HEAs are ductile but soft, while bcc-type HEAs are hard but brittle.     One part of this work is to understand the solid solubility in HEAs. The need for single-phase solid solution and controlling the formation of TCP/GCP phases, is addressed through the molecular orbital approach. The output {{of this approach is}} the Md parameter, the d-orbital energy level, which can well describe the solubility limit in fcc HEAs comprising of only 3 d transition metals. However, Md alone cannot describe the solid solubilities in fcc HEAs, which also contain 4 d elements. Alloying of 4 d elements with 3 d elements will cause a large increase of bond order, Bo, which is the measure of the strength of covalent bonds. The use of two-parameter Md - Bo plot can improve the prediction of solid solubility limit when 4 d elements are alloyed, but needs further work. The Md approach for bcc HEAs containing 4 d elements is also encouraging, but requires more evidence to support this alloy design approach. The second part of this work is to ductilize HEAs containing group IV (Ti, Zr, Hf), V (V, Nb, Ta) and VI (Cr, Mo, W) refractory elements where inadequate ductility puts a limit on their mechanical performance for structural applications. A strategy is proposed here to design refractory HEAs with yield strength reaching 900 MPa, and importantly with sufficient ductility at room temperature. Ductility is introduced by maintaining the number of total valence electrons low, which can be controlled by adjusting the alloy compositions. These findings will shed light on the <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>refractory</b> HEAs with optimal mechanical properties...|$|E
40|$|Concretes whose {{structure}} and final properties are shaped during thermal pre-treatment or during life-service at elevated temperatures {{can be applied}} as construction material for thermal insulation and/or refractory linings in high-temperatureoperating plants. Refractory concretes designed with waste raw materials show satisfying performances in comparison with standard concretes. Sintering initiates microstructural changes within concrete. Concrete microstructure further develops with increasing temperature. Change progression can be monitored by means of destructive and non-destructive tests: either by investigating change of compressive strength or apparent porosity of concrete samples. Destructive tests, in this study, were applied in compressive strength investigation, while non-destructive tests were performed for results comparison. Experiment has been conducted on corundum (standard) concrete and recycled bauxite (experimental) concrete. Samples underwent thermal treatment from 110 to 1500 °C. Macroperformance of the final refractory concrete was correlated to the microstructural change detected by means of XRD and SEM analysis. Creep testing was conducted to prove sintering process. Results showed that recycled concrete has equal if not better properties in comparison with standard refractory concrete {{and can be used}} as thermoinsulation or refractory material. The results presented in this paper contribute to the idea of including other testing methods (i. e. nondestructive methods) in investigation of microstructural changes and sintering process of refractory concrete. At the same time results of this investigation highlight advantages of application of secondary raw materials in <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>refractory</b> materials. Although recycled aggregate concrete showed lower compressive strength and higher porosity than commercial concrete {{it should be noted that}} both porosity and compressive strength are within satisfying value range for high-temperature application, i. e. these concretes will not be used as structural materials but as thermal insulation linings. In such application refractoriness is the property which is more important than strength. Considering the fact that compressive strength is above 50 MPa (and above 20 MPa at 1500 °c) these concretes should be able to withstand load induced by other constructive parts of furnace and slag. Refractoriness test showed that bauxite-based recycled concrete is highly resistible on increasing temperatures and creep test showed initiation of sintering process. Corundum concrete can be used for temperature above 1500 °c. Due to the satisfying performances it is concluded that recycled concrete can be equally used as standard concrete. Even though it has slightly lower properties, accent should be on the financial and ecological benefit found in using of recycled material and savings of energy and natural resources...|$|E

40|$|Iron {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} resources in the lithosphere; 90 % of all metal ores extracted are based on iron. Many steps are included in the extraction of iron from ore, with extraction processes varying among different producers. Iron ore pellets are a prepared burden material for ironmaking in the blast furnace or by direct reduction. Such pellets can be sintered in a grate-kiln furnace system, in which the kiln is usually lined with mullite-containing bricks. These bricks degrade by various mechanisms, and need to be replaced regularly, which causes expensive production stops. Materials deposit in chunks on the lining in the kiln. These deposits comprise ~ 95 % hematite with oxides of alkali metals, alkaline earth metals and others, which originate mainly from pellets that have disintegrated, but also from fly-ash from the burner fuel used to heat the kiln. This study investigated the interaction of deposit materials with refractory lining bricks in kilns during the sintering process in iron ore pellet production. Results are obtained from laboratory scale experiments, and from samples collected from industrial kilns, both in-situ and during production stops. Refractory/deposit compatibility tests were performed in a laboratory furnace at various temperatures, for different holding times, and in a number of atmospheres. Deposit materials collected from three commercial lining bricks in production kilns were analysed in both powder and solid forms. Deliberate additions of alkali species (carbonates of potassium and sodium) were made in order to evaluate their influence on degradation mechanisms. Analysis using scanning electron microscopy, QEMSCAN (quantitative evaluation of minerals by scanning electron microscopy), x-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetry and in-situ mass spectrometry confirmed that alkali additions in the deposit materials dissolve mullite in the liner bricks, which accelerates degradation. Phases such as nepheline (Na 2 O·Al 2 O 3 · 2 SiO 2), kalsilite (K 2 O·Al 2 O 3 · 2 SiO 2), leucite (K 2 O·Al 2 O 3 · 4 SiO 2) and potassium β-alumina (K 2 O· 11 Al 2 O 3) were formed. Moreover, it was observed that potassium penetrates deeper into the lining material, and in larger amounts, than sodium, both on the laboratory scale and in industrial furnaces. Formations of alkalicontaining phases such as the feldspathoid minerals kalsilite and nepheline are coupled with an expansion in the lining material, observed by dilatometry, which causes structural spalling that appears as cracks in some of the refractory/deposit compatibility tests. Grains of hematite with sizes between 50 - 100 μm remain on the original surface of the brick, whereas micrometer-scale hematite migrates through capillary infiltration (in pores, brick joints and cracks) and diffusion, and appears in finer grains deeper in the lining material. The degradation mechanisms of the bricks in an iron ore pellet producing kiln are shown to involve these chemical reactions in combination with thermomechanical stresses. Recommendations are given regarding the choice of materials, the <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>refractory</b> liners in the kilns to extend the time between production stops necessary for repair.

40|$|Melting {{temperature}} calculation {{has important}} {{applications in the}} theoretical study of phase diagrams and computational materials screenings. In this thesis, we present two new methods, i. e., the improved Widom's particle insertion method and the small-cell coexistence method, which we developed in order to capture melting temperatures both accurately and quickly. We propose a scheme that drastically improves the efficiency of Widom's particle insertion method by efficiently sampling cavities while calculating the integrals providing the chemical potentials of a physical system. This idea enables us to calculate chemical potentials of liquids directly from first-principles {{without the help of}} any reference system, which is necessary in the commonly used thermodynamic integration method. As an example, we apply our scheme, combined with the density functional formalism, to the calculation of the chemical potential of liquid copper. The calculated chemical potential is further used to locate the melting temperature. The calculated results closely agree with experiments. We propose the small-cell coexistence method based on the statistical analysis of small-size coexistence MD simulations. It eliminates the risk of a metastable superheated solid in the fast-heating method, while also significantly reducing the computer cost relative to the traditional large-scale coexistence method. Using empirical potentials, we validate the method and systematically study the finite-size effect on the calculated melting points. The method converges to the exact result in the limit of a large system size. An accuracy within 100 K in melting temperature is usually achieved when the simulation contains more than 100 atoms. DFT examples of Tantalum, high-pressure Sodium, and ionic material NaCl are shown to demonstrate the accuracy and flexibility of the method in its practical applications. The method serves as a promising approach for large-scale automated material screening in which the melting temperature is a design criterion. We present in detail two examples of refractory materials. First, we demonstrate how key material properties that provide guidance in the <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>refractory</b> materials can be accurately determined via ab initio thermodynamic calculations in conjunction with experimental techniques based on synchrotron X-ray diffraction and thermal analysis under laser-heated aerodynamic levitation. The properties considered include melting point, heat of fusion, heat capacity, thermal expansion coefficients, thermal stability, and sublattice disordering, as illustrated in a motivating example of lanthanum zirconate (La 2 Zr 2 O 7). The close agreement with experiment in the known but structurally complex compound La 2 Zr 2 O 7 provides good indication that the computation methods described can be used within a computational screening framework to identify novel refractory materials. Second, we report an extensive investigation into the melting temperatures of the Hf-C and Hf-Ta-C systems using ab initio calculations. With melting points above 4000 K, hafnium carbide (HfC) and tantalum carbide (TaC) are among the most refractory binary compounds known to date. Their mixture, with a general formula Ta x Hf 1 -x C y, is known to have a melting point of 4215 K at the composition Ta 4 HfC 5, which has long been considered as the highest melting temperature for any solid. Very few measurements of melting point in tantalum and hafnium carbides have been documented, because of the obvious experimental difficulties at extreme temperatures. The investigation lets us identify three major chemical factors that contribute to the high melting temperatures. Based on these three factors, we propose and explore a new class of materials, which, according to our ab initio calculations, may possess even higher melting temperatures than Ta-Hf-C. This example also demonstrates the feasibility of materials screening and discovery via ab initio calculations for the optimization of "higher-level" properties whose determination requires extensive sampling of atomic configuration space. ...|$|E
