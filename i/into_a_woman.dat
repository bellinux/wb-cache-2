5|$|Myrrha {{has been}} {{interpreted}} as developing from a girl <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> {{in the course of}} the story: in the beginning she is a virgin refusing her suitors, in that way denying the part of herself that is normally dedicated to Aphrodite. The goddess then strikes her with desire to make love with her father and Myrrha is then made <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> in the grip of an uncontrollable lust. The marriage between her father and mother is then set as an obstacle for her love along with incest being forbidden by the laws, profane as well as divine. The way the daughter seduces her father illustrates the most extreme version a seduction can take: the union between two persons who by social norms and laws are strictly held apart.|$|E
5|$|In Korean mythology, a tiger and a bear {{prayed to}} Hwanung, {{the son of}} the Lord of Heaven, that they might become human. Upon hearing their prayers, Hwanung gave them 20 cloves of garlic and a bundle of mugwort, {{ordering}} them to eat only this sacred food and remain out of the sunlight for 100 days.

5|$|Williams {{had wanted}} to make a horror game for eight years prior to Phantasmagoria, and had started to design one on several occasions, but none came to fruition. She felt the {{computer}} game industry and software technology had not yet reached the point where an effective and frightening computer game could be made. As a result, she decided to wait until CD-ROMs were faster and could handle real actors, which she believed was crucial for a horror game because she felt the player {{had to be able to}} empathize with the character to fear for them. Williams had been considering several horror story ideas for years before making the game. In one, the heroine answers a magician's advertisement for an assistant and gets the job, but the magician turns out to be insane. Another was set in the past, with the female protagonist getting involved in the supernatural life of a magician character. That idea evolved <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> being married to a man who is drawn to a bizarre house that previously belonged to illusionists and is haunted by ghosts. The final story as it appears in the game has a contemporary setting, but combines elements from modern fiction, 19th century literature, and classic horror films of the 1950s.|$|E

Virginia Dare met the Indian princess Pocahontas in E.A.B. Shackleford's 1892 novel Virginia Dare: A Romance of the Sixteenth Century. Virginia Dare was the main {{character}} in Sallie Southall Cotten's 1901 book in verse The White Doe: The Fate of Virginia Dare. In the book, she is turned into a white doe by an Indian witch doctor after she rejects his advances. When her true love, an Indian warrior, shoots her with a silver arrow, she turns back <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> just before she dies in his arms. Cotten has asserted, however, that the tale of Dare as the White Doe had survived for some three centuries as part of colonial folklore. In the 1908 novel The Daughter of Virginia Dare, author Mary Virginia Wall made Pocahontas the daughter of Virginia Dare. In Herbert Bouldin Hawes' 1930 novel The Daughter of the Blood, Virginia Dare {{is involved in a}} romantic triangle with John Smith and Pocahontas.|$|E

500|$|... "What's Your Name" [...] is an midtempo electro song, and bases its melody on {{thrusting}} new wave-influenced synths.

Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune compared the song's synth riff {{to the music}} that was popular during the 1980s MTV generation, while John Soeder from The Plain Dealer noted its similarity to British duo the Eurythmics. Usher monotonously repeats the pick-up line hook, [...] "What's your name?", and thereby pays homage to his bachelor history.

The next scene depicts Shakira striking different poses inside a golden cage (with the sign [...] "Do Not Feed the Animal" [...] on top), clad in a skin-toned leotard. Shakira explained the usage of the golden cage in the video, saying that [...] "I just wanted to express what it feels like for a she-wolf to be in captivity. To be in a golden cage.

500|$|A {{murder of}} giant crows attacks the {{vegetable}} car during the drive, forcing Wirt to veer {{off into a}} cornfield and crash into a scarecrow pole, which scares off the crows. Crops then reveals that they have arrived at the [...] "big city," [...] {{which turns out to}} be an old-fashioned small farm community {{in the middle of the}} cornfield. While Wirt and Beatrice try to repair the car, Greg wanders off with Crops and they explore the city's gazebo garden party. Crops then bumps <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> made of cabbage. Crops apologizes and there's a sudden announcement that the party's scheduled entertainment has been cancelled. Greg tells Crops that he could fill in for the party with his guitar and singing abilities, and the woman finds herself flattered after learning that Crops is a musician. Back at the car, Wirt, who can't figure out how to fix the vehicle as all it is to him is a cluster of vegetables, and Beatrice, who recommends that all he had to do was turn the crank on the car's front bumper to start the engine, knock over the scarecrow as they leave with the car working. This summons the giant crows, as well as giant turkeys, who terrorize the city and its vegetable inhabitants. Wirt and Beatrice drive up and pick up Greg, while Crops continues to woo the woman with his music, unaware of the chaos around him, even as a crow attacks one of the members of the band he's performing with and as Wirt tries to get his attention. As Wirt, Greg, and Beatrice attempt to escape without Crops, they are set upon by the giant animals, who start to devour the vegetable car.
