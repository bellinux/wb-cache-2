500|$|The Byrds' {{recording}} of the song opens with a distinctive, Bach-inspired guitar introduction played by McGuinn and then, like Dylan's version, goes into the song's chorus. Although Dylan's version contains four verses, The Byrds only perform the song's second verse and two repeats of the chorus, followed by {{a variation on the}} song's introduction, which then fades out. The Byrds' arrangement of the song had been shortened during the band's rehearsals at World Pacific Studios in 1964, at the suggestion of Jim Dickson, in order to accommodate commercial radio stations, which were reluctant to play songs that were over two-and-a-half minutes long. Thus, while Dylan's version is five-and-a-half minutes long, The Byrds' runs just short of two-and-a-half minutes. The lead vocal on The Byrds' version of [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man" [...] was sung by McGuinn, who attempted to modify his singing style to fill what he perceived as a gap in the popular music scene of the day, somewhere between the vocal sound of John Lennon and Bob Dylan. The song also took on a spiritual aspect for McGuinn during the recording sessions, as he told The Byrds' biographer Johnny Rogan in 1997: [...] "I was singing to God and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> that God was the Tambourine Man and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> to him, 'Hey, God, take me for a trip and I'll follow you.' It was a prayer of submission." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1978, Ebony {{reported}} that Andrew Young {{and his family}} explored the possibility of {{moving out of the}} suite at the Waldorf-Astoria and into a house instead. Young, who was the first ambassador to live in the suite with [...] "young children", stated that [...] "he Waldorf is very nice, and its convenient, but I just have problems trying to bring up a small child in a hotel." [...] However, the search ultimately [...] "became a media issue" [...] and Young elected to stay in the suite. Nevertheless, he opined that [...] "eople tried to make it seem like <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> that the Waldorf wasn't good enough for us".|$|E

Lennon talked about the song in 1980: [...] "I was different all my life. The second verse goes, 'No one I think is in my tree.' Well, I was too shy and self-doubting. Nobody seems to be as hip as me is what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying.</b> Therefore, I must be crazy or a genius – 'I mean it must be high or low'", and explaining that the song was [...] "psycho-analysis set to music".|$|E
500|$|Cage {{underwent}} {{an artistic}} {{crisis in the}} early 1940s. His compositions were rarely accepted by the public, and he grew more and more disillusioned {{with the idea of}} art as communication. He later gave an account of the reasons: [...] "Frequently I misunderstood what another composer was saying simply because I had little understanding of his language. And I found other people misunderstanding what I myself was saying when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> something pointed and direct". At the beginning of 1946, Cage met Gita Sarabhai, an Indian musician who came to the United States concerned about Western influence on the music of her country. Sarabhai wanted to spend several months in the US, studying Western music. She took lessons in counterpoint and contemporary music with Cage, who offered to teach her for free if she taught him about Indian music in return. Sarabhai agreed and through her Cage became acquainted with Indian music and philosophy. The purpose of music, according to Sarabhai's teacher in India, was [...] "to sober and quiet the mind, thus rendering it susceptible to divine influences", and this definition became one of the cornerstones of Cage's view on music and art in general.|$|E

500|$|... "Like a Virgin" [...] {{was written}} by Billy Steinberg and Tom Kelly. The idea for the song {{originated}} when Steinberg was living at his father's vineyards in the Coachella Valley, and driving a red pickup truck one day. In {{an interview with the}} Los Angeles Times, Steinberg explained that the song was not written for Madonna or any female singer but was inspired by his personal experiences. At that time Steinberg had just come out of an emotionally challenging relationship, and he had met someone new. That inspired the lyrics for [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] about how he coped with the difficult situation. When he took the song to Kelly, they decided {{that it would be a}} sensitive ballad, however they could not decide how the word [...] "virgin" [...] would fit in it. Steinberg elaborated: [...] "I wasn't just trying to get that racy word virgin in a lyric. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> ... that I may not really be a virgin— I've been battered romantically and emotionally like many people— but I'm starting a new relationship and it just feels so good, it's healing all the wounds and making me feel like I've never done this before, because it's so much deeper and more profound than anything I've ever felt." ...|$|E
500|$|Livingstone proclaimed Dobson to be [...] "a tainted candidate" [...] {{and stated}} his {{intention}} {{to run for the}} Mayoralty as an independent candidate. Aware that this would result in his expulsion from Labour, he publicly stated that [...] "I have been forced to choose between the party I love and upholding the democratic rights of Londoners." [...] The polls indicated clear support for Livingstone among the London electorate, with his campaign being run by his Socialist Action associates. He gained the support {{of a wide range of}} celebrities, from musicians like Fatboy Slim, Pink Floyd, the Chemical Brothers, and Blur, artists like Damian Hirst and Tracey Emin, and those from other fields, among them Ken Loach, Jo Brand, and Chris Evans, the latter of whom donated £200,000 to the campaign; half of what Livingstone required. In March 2000, Livingstone agreed to make a public apology to the House of Commons, after he was criticised over his failure to properly register outside interests worth more than £150,000. The election took place in May 2000, at which Livingstone came first with 58% of first and second-preference votes; Conservative candidate Steven Norris came second and Dobson third. Livingstone started his acceptance speech with [...] "As <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> before I was so rudely interrupted 14 years ago..." ...|$|E
500|$|MercyMe's {{lead singer}} Bart Millard wrote [...] "Word of God Speak" [...] while touring {{in support of}} their single [...] "I Can Only Imagine". The travel was exhausting, and Millard commented in an {{interview}} that, {{on one of the}} nights on tour, he [...] "went to bed just really frustrated... It started feeling like everything <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> was the same. I just thought, I have nothing else to say. So I went to bed with that on my mind". After falling asleep, Millard woke up {{early in the morning and}} wrote several lines to the song in his journal before going back to sleep. Several weeks later, he was searching through his journal and found the notes again; when he went to the band's studio, he showed the notes to his producer, Pete Kipley. The two finished the lyrics to the song in less than thirty minutes, and recorded the piano track the same night; they also brought in someone to compose a string track for the song. Millard wanted [...] "Word of God Speak" [...] to contain only piano, avoiding the big production that could assure the song success on the radio, as he felt the simple production would mirror the lyrics.|$|E

500|$|Vernon {{recorded}} his lines {{in a separate}} recording studio {{than most of the}} album. Vernon described the studio as a [...] "tiny black room". He would record a line in the room, and then shortly later West would come in and play back what was recorded, and then discuss what needed to be changed. They repeated that process a few times until the song was finished. Vernon expressed a positive opinion of working with West, and though he called West demanding in some ways, he appreciated West's enthusiasm for music and the creativity produced by the recording sessions. The song was recorded around the death of Michael Jackson and the event had an effect of the recording crew of the song, and certain aspects of the song are influences by personal events that affected West throughout the years. In an interview with MTV, West said that the song was going to be last featured on the album, and commented that [...] "emotionally it just fit the crescendo of everything that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> and what I wanted to say to this girl. And it's also my favorite eight bars that I've ever written in my life. I think it's one of the greatest pieces of writing." ...|$|E
500|$|The song's {{usage of}} the word [...] "ironic" [...] {{attracted}} media attention for an improper application of the term; according to Jon Pareles of The New York Times, the song gives a distinct [...] "unironic" [...] sense in its implications. [...] According to the Oxford English Dictionary [...] "irony" [...] is [...] "a figure of speech in which the intended meaning {{is the opposite of}} that expressed by the words used". Thus, lyrics such as [...] "It's like rain on your wedding day" [...] and [...] "A traffic jam when you're already late" [...] are not ironic. Morissette commented about the writing of the song: [...] "For me the great debate on whether what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> in 'Ironic' was ironic wasn't a traumatic debate. I'd always embraced the fact that {{every once in a while}} I'd be the malapropism queen. And when Glen and I were writing it, we definitely were not doggedly making sure that everything was technically ironic". In 2014, Michael Reid Roberts penned for Salon.com a defense of the song's use of the term [...] "ironic", as the song cites situational ironies, which is defined as the [...] "state of affairs or event that seems deliberately contrary to what one expects and is often [...] amusing as a result", as some of the situations described in the lyrics could in fact be said to be [...] "ironic".|$|E
500|$|Two songs {{taken from}} the album ("Mandatory Suicide" [...] and [...] "South of Heaven") have become near {{constant}} fixtures in the band's live setlist, notching up appearances on the following: the live DVDs Live Intrusion, War at the Warfield, Still Reigning, Soundtrack to the Apocalypses deluxe edition's bonus live disc, and the live double album Decade of Aggression. [...] Lombardo guested with Finnish cellist group Apocalyptica on a live medley of the two tracks at 1998's Headbanger's Heaven festival in the Netherlands. Adrien Begrand of PopMatters described [...] "South of Heaven" [...] as [...] "an unorthodox set opener in theory", noting [...] "the song went over like a megaton bomb detonating the place: dozens of inverted crosses projected behind the high drum riser, the sinewy opening notes kicked in, followed by an overture of bass, cymbal crashes, and tom fills, {{leading up to the}} slowly building crescendo" [...] in a concert review. Lombardo remembers listening to a live rendition of [...] "South of Heaven" [...] and thinking, Man! There's just so much groove in that song.' To my kids <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying,</b> 'Listen to that! Listen to how groovy that is!' And it's heavy." [...] A live version of the track featured on the JÄGERMUSIC Rarities 2004 promotional CD, given away to attendees at the Spring 2004 Jägermeister Music Tour.|$|E

500|$|Although they {{initially}} {{worked well}} together, Simon and Groening's relationship became [...] "very contentious" [...] according to Groening. Simon never expected {{the show to}} be a success, often proclaiming to fellow staff members [...] "We're thirteen and out"—meaning that the show would be canceled after the thirteen episodes of the first season. Therefore, he also told the staff that they had creative freedom {{to do whatever they}} wanted to make The Simpsons as good a show as possible, regardless of network or public opinion, because he thought it inevitably would not be renewed; he elaborated in 2009 that [...] "really <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> that to take the pressure off of everyone. I was just saying let's just go out and make 13 episodes that are really good and really funny." [...] However, Groening interpreted it as meaning Simon was uncommitted and did not care whether the show was a success or not, as Simon's career would survive, whereas his own would not. In 2001, Groening described Simon as [...] "brilliantly funny and one of the smartest writers I've ever worked with, although unpleasant and mentally unbalanced." [...] According to John Ortved's book , when the show became successful Simon resented the media attention Groening received, particularly the praise for the show's writing; Simon felt that Groening's involvement was limited, and that he should have been the one receiving credit for the show. Simon later spoke well of Groening's influence, particularly on the show's positive tone.|$|E
500|$|By May 1999, {{the group}} was nearing {{platinum}} status for Dude Ranch and sales targets were higher for Enema of the State. The Los Angeles Times ran a Sunday feature on the band two days prior to release, noting that [...] "The musicians are sanguine about chances to repeat or exceed the sales of Dude Ranch, noting the always-shifting sands of pop culture and that they've already done better than they'd ever anticipated." [...] Momentum began to build when US radio stations received advance copies of Enema of the State. MCA issued Enema of the State on June 1, and the release peaked at number nine on the U.S. Billboard 200. The album chart was gripped by the Backstreet Boys' Millennium, but Enema of the State still managed to move 109,000 units that week. The band was supporting Lagwagon in Europe when MCA executives phoned the trio about rising record sales. Joey Cape, frontman of Lagwagon, remarked that [...] "They were selling, like, 90,000 records a day [...] <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> things like, 'What are you doing here? Go home! Why {{do you want to}} be on tour with Lagwagon right now?" [...] At a show shortly following the release of the album, DeLonge was approached by Noodles from The Offspring to congratulate him. [...] "He looks at me right in the eyes and he goes, 'You're next,'" [...] remembered DeLonge, who blushed and shook off the compliment.|$|E
