40|$|AbstractWhether {{the number}} of {{chemotherapy}} cycles required to obtain a first morphological remission affects {{prognosis of patients with}} acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains controversial. To clarify how achievement of early remission might influence outcome of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), we studied 220 consecutive adults with AML in first morphological remission who underwent transplantation after myeloablative or nonmyeloablative conditioning to investigate how {{the number of}} standard- or high-dose <b>induction</b> <b>courses</b> required to achieve remission impacted post-HCT outcome. Three-year estimates of overall survival were 65 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] 56 % to 73 %), 56 % (95 % CI, 43 % to 67 %), and 23 % (95 % CI, 6 % to 46 %) for patients requiring 1 course, 2 courses, or > 2 courses of induction therapy; corresponding relapse estimates were 24 % (95 % CI, 17 % to 31 %), 43 % (95 % CI, 31 % to 55 %), and 58 % (95 % CI, 30 % to 78 %), respectively. After covariate adjustment (minimal residual disease status, conditioning, age, cytogenetic disease risk, type of consolidation chemotherapy, pre-HCT karyotype, and pre-HCT peripheral blood count recovery), the hazard ratios for 2 or > 2 <b>induction</b> <b>courses</b> versus 1 induction were 1. 16 (95 % CI,. 73 to 1. 85, P = . 53) and 2. 63 (95 % CI, 1. 24 to 5. 57, P = . 011) for overall mortality, and 2. 10 (95 % CI, 1. 27 to 3. 48, P = . 004) and 3. 32 (95 % CI, 1. 42 to 7. 78, P = . 006), respectively, for relapse. These findings indicate that the number of <b>induction</b> <b>courses</b> required to achieve morphological remission in AML adds prognostic information for post-HCT outcome that is independent of other prognostic factors...|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{prospective}} phase II multicenter {{trial was}} {{performed with the}} aim to obtain less than 25 % nonrelapse mortality (NRM) after unrelated cord blood transplantation (UCBT) for adults with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) using a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen (RIC) consisting of total body irradiation (2 Gy), cyclophosphamide (50 mg/kg), and fludarabine (200 mg/m 2). From 2007 to 2009, 79 UCBT recipients were enrolled. Patients who underwent transplantation in first complete remission (CR 1) (n = 48) had a higher frequency of unfavorable cytogenetics and secondary AML and required more <b>induction</b> <b>courses</b> of chemotherapy to achieve CR 1 compared with the others. The median infused total nucleated cells (TNC) was 3. 4  × 107 /kg, 60 % received double UCBT, 77 % were HLA mismatched (4 / 6), and 40 % had major ABO incompatibility. Cumulative incidence of neutrophil recovery at day 60 was 87 % and the cumulative incidence of 100 -day acute graft-versus-host disease (II to IV) was 50 %. At 2 years, the cumulative incidence of NRM and relapse was 20 % and 46 %, respectively. In multivariate analysis, major ABO incompatibility (P =. 001) and TNC (< 3. 4  × 107 /kg; P =. 001) were associated with increased NRM, and use of 2 or more <b>induction</b> <b>courses</b> to obtain CR 1 was associated with increased relapse incidence (P =. 04). Leukemia-free survival (LFS) at 2 years was 35 %, and the only factor associated with decreased LFS was secondary AML (P =. 04). In conclusion, despite the decreased NRM observed, other RIC regimens with higher myelosuppression should be evaluated to decrease relapse in high-risk AML. (EUDRACT 2006 - 005901 - 67) ...|$|E
