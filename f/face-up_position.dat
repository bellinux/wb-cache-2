They are cut to ideal proportions with good optical symmetry, polish and a specific faceting pattern. When all these factors are present, {{the result is a}} repeatable, near perfect pattern of eight symmetrical arrows in the <b>face-up</b> <b>position</b> of the stone (called 'crown') and eight symmetrical hearts when viewed in the table-down position (called 'pavilion').|$|E
50|$|Dummy Rang, mostly {{referred}} to as Dummy only, is a variant of Double Sir, which is played between three players instead of four as in common rang games. The fourth player is a dummy player, that is why this game is termed as Dummy. In every game, the dummy player is set to be the partner of one player, rotated counter clock-wise. The cards of the fourth player are placed <b>face-up</b> <b>position,</b> and partner of the dummy player is responsible of dummy's turn.|$|E

40|$|Abstract We {{consider}} {{and compare}} the various different kinds of flow that may {{take place in the}} anterior chamber of a human eye. The physical mechanisms responsible for causing such flows may be classified as follows: (i) buoyancy-driven flow arising from the temperature difference between the anterior surface of the cornea and the iris, (ii) flow generated by the aqueous production of the ciliary body, (iii) flow generated by the interaction between buoyancy and gravity while sleeping while sleeping in a <b>face-up</b> <b>position,</b> (iv) flow generated by phakodenesis (lens tremor), (v) flow generated by Rapid Eye Movement (REM) during sleep.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This was a pilot {{randomised}} controlled trial (RCT) {{to investigate}} the effect of post-operative face-down positioning {{on the outcome of}} macular hole surgery and to inform the design of a larger definitive study. METHODS: In all, 30 phakic eyes of 30 subjects with idiopathic full-thickness macular holes underwent vitrectomy with dye-assisted peeling of the ILM and 14 % perfluoropropane gas. Subjects were randomly allocated to posture face down for 10 days (posturing group) or to avoid a <b>face-up</b> <b>position</b> only (non-posturing group). The primary outcome was anatomical hole closure. RESULTS: Macular holes closed in 14 of 15 eyes (93. 3 %; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 68 - 100 %) in the posturing group and in 9 of 15 (60 %; 95 % CI 32 - 84 %) in the non-posturing group. In a subgroup analysis of outcome according to macular hole size, all holes smaller than 400 μm closed regardless of posturing (100 %). In contrast, holes larger than 400 μm closed in 10 of 11 eyes (91 %; 95 % CI 58 - 99 %) in the posturing group and in only 4 of 10 eyes (40 %; 95 % CI 12 - 74 %) in the non-posturing group (Fisher's exact test P= 0. 02). CONCLUSION: Post-operative face-down positioning may improve the likelihood of macular hole closure, particularly for holes larger than 400 μm. These results support the case for a RCT...|$|E
2500|$|When an attacking monster targets {{a monster}} in Defense Position (horizontal orientation), then the attacking monster's ATK points will be {{compared}} with the defending monster's DEF points. If the attacking monster has more ATK points than the defending monster's DEF points, the defending monster is destroyed, but its owner will not receive any damage to their Life Points (unless the attacking monster possesses a [...] "Piercing Damage" [...] effect, in which case the defending player takes damage based on {{the difference between the two}} values). On the other hand, if the player attacks a defending monster whose DEF points are greater than their attacking monster's ATK points, neither monster is destroyed but the attacking player will take damage based on the difference between the two values. For example, if a monster with 1000 ATK attacks a defending monster with 1400 DEF, the attacking player will lose 400 Life Points. If the attacking monster's ATK points and the defending monster's DEF points are the same, neither monster is destroyed and neither player takes damage. If a monster in face-down Defense Position is targeted for an attack, it is automatically Flip Summoned into <b>face-up</b> Defense <b>Position.</b> The card will then remain face-up until it is either destroyed or tributed, or allowed to be flipped face-down again by a card effect.|$|R
5000|$|Throughout the series, other {{inconsistencies}} appear, {{some more}} drastic than others. Some cards are classified differently in Duel Monsters than the real-world game; for example, Flame Swordsman {{is a normal}} monster in the series, but is a fusion monster in the real-world game, and Spellbinding Circle was notably entirely redone as a [...] "trap with spell card properties", complete with a different function. Duelists are shown normal-summoning their monster cards in <b>face-up</b> defense <b>position,</b> while this is only possible in the real-world card game when permitted by the effects of certain spell or trap cards. Additionally, duelists often place their cards face-down in the graveyard, as opposed to face-up. In the Battle City story arc, the [...] "advanced rules" [...] also prevent Fusion monsters from immediately attacking when summoned, {{while there is no}} such provision in the real game. To avoid this rule in the anime, the spell card Quick-Attack was created. From the Waking the Dragons story arc onwards, no such provision exists, and the only difference from the real-world game rules is the starting amount of life points, which is reduced for brevity. Sometimes during a single duel a rule will seemingly be changed or ignored, usually for plot, dramatic, or in a few cases comedic effect. The same rules are continued into and updated for the follow-up series, Yu-Gi-Oh! GX, Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's, Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal, and Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V.|$|R

Methods: We performed a prospective interventional study of 19 eyes of 19 consecutive patients with posterior macular detachment due to ODP. All patients underwent PPV, posterior hyaloid peeling, fluid–air exchange, injection of 0. 05 mL of APC over the ODP and 15 % perfluoropropane (C 3 F 8) endotamponade. Postoperative measures included face-up positioning for 2 hours and then avoidance of the <b>face-up</b> <b>position</b> during the ensuing 10 days. All patients underwent complete ophthalmologic examination and optical coherence tomography preoperatively at 1  month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months postoperatively and then annually. Outcome measures were best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) by logMAR, improvement of quality of vision, macular attachment, and resolution of intraretinal schisis-like separation. Results: Preoperatively, the median BCVA was 0. 70 (range: 0. 30 – 1. 70) and all patients showed improved visual acuity after surgery; BCVA was 0. 22 (range: 0. 07 – 0. 52) at 12 months follow-up. All patients showed complete reabsorption of intraretinal fluid (median time: 3. 5  months [range: 2 – 8 months]) and macular attachment at the end of follow-up (median: 60  months [range: 12 – 144  months]), with stable or improved visual acuity. No reoperations were needed and no major adverse events were recorded. Conclusion: For macular detachment associated with ODP, the combination of PPV, posterior hyaloid peeling, APC, and C 3 F 8 tamponade is a highly effective alternative technique with stable anatomical and functional results.

25|$|During the Battle Phase of each turn, {{the player}} {{may choose to}} attack their {{opponent}} once with each monster in Attack <b>Position</b> (<b>face-up</b> in a vertical orientation), targeting one of the opponent's monsters or, if the opponent has no defending monsters, attacking them directly. When an attack is declared, the ATK points of the attacking monster is compared with the ATK or DEF points of the defending monster, depending on which position it is in. If both the attacking and defending monsters are in Attack Position, then the monster with the lowest ATK points is destroyed {{and sent to the}} Graveyard, with its owner losing Life Points based on {{the difference between the two}} monsters' ATK points. For example, if a monster with 1400 ATK destroys a monster with 1000 ATK, the owner of the losing monster will lose 400 Life Points. If both monsters have the same number of ATK Points, both monsters are destroyed and neither player takes damage. Monsters with 0 ATK cannot destroy anything, that is to say, if two monsters with 0 ATK battle, neither monster will be destroyed.|$|R
