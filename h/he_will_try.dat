Mulder asks Cahn to confront Detweiler, but Cahn is attacked and severely injured by the Dhole and placed in the hospital. Mulder then visits Berquist and says he thinks she has not been honest with him. Berquist reveals that she first suspected Detweiler when she saw him.

Further in the Delta Labs, the marine encounters the injured Swann. Swann informs the marine that Kelly has been working with Hell for possibly the whole time, and has been transformed by the demons.

NBA commissioner Adam Silver stated in a press conference regarding the decision that <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>try</b> to force Sterling to sell the Clippers, which would require the consent of Â¾ of the league's 29 other team owners. Silver later announced that the NBA would appoint a CEO to run the team.

500|$|The game's NPCs feature {{artificial}} intelligence (AI) systems that detect unscripted visual and aural cues. If an NPC sees or hears {{something out of}} place, it will react to this, depending {{on the level of}} its suspicions; if for a brief second, they will simply ignore it, but if for long enough, they will become alert to their surroundings and begin searching the area. NPCs will react to things such as clashing swords or the reaction in other NPCs' voices, as well as to visual changes to their environment, such as blood stains, opened doors and fallen bodies; players can avoid leaving visual clues by cleaning them up, such as hiding bodies. NPCs are divided between three categories - [...] "guards", [...] "servants", and [...] "non-human" [...] - whose reactions vary; guards will call out an alert if they spot the player and attack them; servants will run for help if they spot the player or a body; non-human NPCs will merely pursue and attack the player. [...] If a guard is significantly injured, <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>try</b> to escape and find help; some non-human NPCs will merely flee. Non-human characters range from giant spiders, feral creatures, to zombies and ghosts, with certain levels containing survival horror elements.|$|E
500|$|In November 2015, a fire, {{believed}} to have been left unattended by squatters, ignited the roof just before 4:00p.m. It took approximately six hours to extinguish the fire, during which 80% of the roof was damaged. Much of the roof collapsed, exposing the timber frame skeleton, and some rooms were completely destroyed. Moments before the building caught on fire, there were unconfirmed reports that a loud bang was heard. The Goulburn Heritage Group stated that they were [...] "upset and sickened" [...] by the fire, and Ferrara responded by saying that he was disappointed, and that the building was not insured. Ferrara has stated that <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>try</b> to preserve the building, and estimates the damage costs at $4 million to $5 million. In 2016, another fire occurred in a building {{at the rear of the}} main structure, causing extensive damage. The building, which was revealed to be the old hall built in 1932, was deemed not salvageable; it was subsequently scheduled for demolition. Following the fire, the council ordered Ferrara to secure both the site and loose building materials such as roof iron. The fire was treated as suspicious, as witnesses claim that two people wearing backpacks were running from the building just before the fire occurred. Following the second fire, a third fire occurred in the building, in which a large portion of the building was completely destroyed.|$|E
500|$|Many of the Topolino Snow White comics {{were the}} works of Romano Scarpa. His 1986 comic [...] "The Seven Dwarfs and King Arbor's Crystal" [...] (I Sette Nani e il cristallo di Re Arbor) {{provides}} explanation how the Queen would have survived her apparent death in the film (as some branches and bushes eased the fall and she was rescued by her loyal guards) and why she could not change back to her normal self (as her castle was burned down by the Huntsman and her book of magic is gone). In this story, Grimhilde (Grimilde) enlists the aid of her great admirer and past suitor, the evil King Arbor of Vegetalia, in a plot to use a magic crystal device to swap her old body with Snow White's. The intrigue is foiled by the dwarves who destroy the crystal, and the resigned Arbor allows the Witch to live with her, saying <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>try</b> to remember she was [...] "the most beautiful among queens". The uneasy relationship between Grimhilde and Abor continued in the comic [...] "The Seven Dwarfs and the Fountainhead" [...] (I Sette nani e la fonte meravigliosa), in which she desperately attempts to regain her youth, but instead only turns into a childlike version of her Witch form for a short time.|$|E

To help Meg, Quagmire gives her his copy of The Missing Piece to help give her a better perception of things, and sends her away feeling much better. He then walks into his bedroom, where two of his one-night stands await with an array of sex toys, {{and it turns out that}} all of Quagmire's seemingly erotic antics were actually in preparation for this tryst. One of the women asks Quagmire if he has the [...] "hwhip" [...] (with emphasis on the [...] "h") and Quagmire responds with disbelief.|$|E

Cartel member, Jordan Lee hounds the Ewings about their underhandedness and makes sure they know Seth Stone committed suicide {{as a result of the}} dealings. Soon thereafter, Sue Ellen nurses a hangover while watching the local news to see reports that Ewing oil sold off its holdings just before the nationalization.

Cartel member Vaughn Leland, who lost $20 million (equivalent to $ in [...] ) in the deal, reaches Ewing Oil offices to express his belief that J.R. duped him, but Jock refuses to offer any restitution.

J.R. assures his father and brother that such unethical behavior was beneath him. [...] Lucy Ewing spends time with her professor/boyfriend who is only interested in her for one reason. Attorney Alan Beam visits Kristin Shepard for ideas about how J.R. might have swindled everyone. Shepard suggests Hank Johnson may have information.

Beam asks her to try to get information from Johnson by pretending to still be J.R.'s secretary. Bobby talks with Miss Ellie about Pam who has flown to Corpus Christi to find her mother, Rebecca. They both think it is because she is grieving from the recent death of her father Digger. Sue Ellen apologized for her drunken behavior the prior night and laments that it gave J.R. fodder for his plans to re-institutionalize her. Bobby says <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>try</b> to keep J.R. from taking that action. J.R. tells Johnson to ignore Shepard's request for records and to shred them. [...] Sue Ellen sees a psychiatrist, Dr. Elby. She gets a reminder about drinking until you are unconscious and promises to stop. J.R. confronts Kristin about her mischief. He tries to bribe her to leave, but she does not accept the offer. J.R. spends some time with Sue Ellen. She alerts him that Bobby is going to speak up for her. He is not worried.
