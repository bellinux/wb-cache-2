[...] "These are just some of the challenges that our society is facing in the coming decade - crisis or no crisis. In the good times, tackling them was going to be difficult.

30|$|Learning base {{specialization}} methods {{restrict the}} search space {{to only one}} variability (of one face feature or identity). In Hierarchical approach, face features research is divided in two steps: a rough research of <b>face</b> <b>key</b> points and then a refined analysis of face feature by the mean of a specific model for each face feature (eyes, nose, mouth) [36 – 39]. Like the previous methods, those approaches consist in {{increasing the number of}} active models to be optimized in parallel, and then make the alignment system cumbersome. In Identity specification, the database identity variability is removed. Reference [15] claims that a generic AAM featuring pose, identity, illumination, and expression variability is less efficient than an AAM dedicated to one identity featuring only pose, illumination, and expression variability. Reference [40] suggests to perform an on-line identity adaptation on an image sequence, by means of a 3 D AAM construction, starting from the first image of the face without any expression. This method is not robust since the first image must be perfectly aligned to allow a good 3 D AAM modeling.|$|E
