25|$|The Denver area Regional Transportation District {{said that}} its FasTracks {{commuter}} rail {{program has been}} designed to limit exposure to freight traffic by using physical separation with separate freight and passenger tracks where possible and using temporal separation by running passenger trains during the day, and <b>freight</b> <b>at</b> night and between rush hours. The San Jose Mercury News reported that San Francisco Bay Area Caltrain commuters are much less likely to be in a head-on collision because opposing trains usually run on separate tracks, and runs <b>freight</b> only <b>at</b> night on a large portion of its route.

40|$|The {{geography}} of <b>freight</b> transportation evolves <b>at</b> various scales, {{but it is}} increasingly acknowledged that <b>freight</b> flows occurring <b>at</b> the local level {{are a result of}} global and regional economic processes. Internationally, distribution networks have expanded, namely through the division of production, manufacturing and consumption. This has been accompanied by a growth of the quantity of freight being shipped as well as by a complication of supply and distribution chains. Most of the {{geography of}} <b>freight</b> <b>at</b> this scale is derived from strategic considerations where issues such as production and subcontracting planning and the choice of hubs and routes are considered for implementing global supply chains. Locally, many activities concerned with freight distribution have been modified with new transport terminals and distribution centres in response to growing consumption {{as well as from the}} imperatives of fragmented supply chains. From their traditional location around central areas with prevalent port and rail linkages, transport terminals and distribution centres have shifted to peripheral locations where road and airport linkages are more prevalent. The geography of <b>freight</b> <b>at</b> this scale is mainly derived from operational considerations aimed at servicing the requirements of local distribution with well-known strategies such as just-in-tim...|$|R
