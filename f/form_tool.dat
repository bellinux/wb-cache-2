5000|$|Type of tool (a small drill {{or a large}} drill, {{high speed}} or carbide, a boxtool or recess, a thin <b>form</b> <b>tool</b> or wide <b>form</b> <b>tool,</b> a slide knurl or a turret {{straddle}} knurl).|$|E
50|$|A <b>form</b> <b>tool</b> is precision-ground into {{a pattern}} that resembles the part to be formed. The <b>form</b> <b>tool</b> {{can be used as}} a single {{operation}} and therefore eliminate many other operations from the slides (front, rear and/or vertical) and the turret, such as box tools. A <b>form</b> <b>tool</b> turns one or more diameters while feeding into the work. Before the use of form tools, diameters were turned by multiple slide and turret operations, and thus took more work to make the part. For example, a <b>form</b> <b>tool</b> can turn many diameters and in addition can also cut off the part in a single operation and eliminate the need to index the turret. For single-spindle machines, bypassing the need to index the turret can dramatically increase hourly part production rates.|$|E
50|$|The form is like shaped fist like {{a finger}} form itak gurgur because the <b>form</b> <b>tool</b> is quite simple the fingers clenched. That {{is why it}} is called pohulpohul (fist).|$|E
50|$|There are {{different}} types of <b>form</b> <b>tools.</b> Insert <b>form</b> <b>tools</b> {{are the most common}} for short- to medium-range jobs (50 to 20,000 pcs). Circular <b>form</b> <b>tools</b> are usually for longer jobs, since the tool wear can be ground off the tool tip many times as the tool is rotated in its holder. There is also a skiving tool {{that can be used for}} light finishing cuts. <b>Form</b> <b>tools</b> can be made of cobalt steel, carbide, or high-speed steel. Carbide requires additional care because it is very brittle and will chip if chatter occurs.|$|R

Directly after preparation of the powder components, the final or near-final shape of the <b>forming</b> <b>tool</b> is produced in a sintering process.

5000|$|On long-running jobs it {{is common}} to use a {{roughing}} tool on a different slide or turret station to remove the bulk of the material to reduce wear on the <b>form</b> <b>tool.</b>|$|E

5000|$|... #Caption: This <b>form</b> <b>tool</b> {{is for a}} {{shift knob}} on a motorcycle. O-rings went into the grooves after {{machining}} from 6061-T6 Aluminum. This tool has an 8-degree rake {{from top to bottom}} for clearance. This tool was designed for a 2G Brown & Sharpe screw machine.|$|E
50|$|The orbital {{riveting}} process uses a <b>forming</b> <b>tool</b> mounted at a 3 or 6Â° angle. The <b>forming</b> <b>tool</b> contacts {{the material and}} then presses it while rotating until the final form is achieved. The final form often has height and/or diameter specifications.|$|R
5000|$|A {{drawback}} {{when using}} <b>form</b> <b>tools</b> {{is that the}} feed into the work is usually slow, 0.0005" [...] to 0.0012" [...] per revolution depending on {{the width of the}} <b>tool.</b> Wide <b>form</b> <b>tools</b> create more heat and usually are problematic for chatter. Heat and chatter reduces <b>tool</b> life. Also, <b>form</b> <b>tools</b> wider than 2.5 times the smaller diameter of the part being turned have a greater risk of the part breaking off. [...] When turning longer lengths, a support from the turret can be used to increase turning length from 2.5 times to 5 times the smallest diameter of the part being turned, and this also can help reduce chatter. Despite the drawbacks, the elimination of extra operations often makes using <b>form</b> <b>tools</b> the most efficient option.|$|R

50|$|These cutters are {{a type of}} <b>form</b> <b>tool</b> and {{are used}} in hobbing {{machines}} to generate gears.

A hobbing machine is a specialised milling machine.|$|E
50|$|They {{are cutting}} tools {{typically}} used in milling machines or machining centres to perform milling operations (and occasionally in other machine tools). They remove material by their movement within the machine (e.g., a ball nose mill) or {{directly from the}} cutter's shape (e.g., a <b>form</b> <b>tool</b> such as a hobbing cutter).|$|E

40|$|<b>Forming</b> <b>tools</b> are {{subjected}} to high mechanical and thermal loads. Abrasive workpiece materials can cause accelerated abrasive wear. Especially aluminium alloys {{have a tendency to}} adhere on the tool surface. Therefore environmentally harmful and expensive lubricants and separators have to be used. Hard coatings can reduce tool wear and avoid adhesion but coating compositions which are proven to be effective on cutting tools for a long time fail rapidly when used on <b>forming</b> <b>tools.</b> <b>Forming</b> <b>tools</b> require special load resisting coatings and a design to fit the material properties of substrate and coating. The finite element method (FEM) was used in the current investigation to simulate and analyze the stress distribution in <b>forming</b> <b>tools.</b> Due to the lack of reliable material data of the coating materials the coating properties are evaluated by the comparison of experimental results with the numerical simulations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} two {{alternative approaches}} in mold making for micro forming processes. The quality of formed micro parts is mainly {{dominated by the}} process parameters and the surface characteristics of the applied <b>forming</b> <b>tools.</b> <b>Forming</b> dies with advanced micro structures can improve the result of forming processes compared to tools with smooth surfaces. Here an approach of micro ball end milling is described to generate the macro geometry {{as well as an}} engineered surface texture on micro <b>forming</b> <b>tools</b> in one machining step. In addition to the surface topography, the die material has a decisive influence on the forming result and durability of the <b>forming</b> <b>tool.</b> Therefore single crystalline diamond represents an promissing material for <b>forming</b> <b>tools,</b> because of its unique material characteristics. On the other hand single crystalline diamond requires unreasonable high efforts for its geometrical shaping. Therefore, this paper will introduce a new approach to machine single crystalline diamond by thermo-chemical material removal...|$|R
40|$|In this study, a <b>forming</b> <b>tool</b> {{that has}} an {{integrated}} structure was redesigned. Limitations on the end product variations and high purchase price were the most significant reasons for re-creating the tool structure. The {{aim of the research}} was to develop a <b>forming</b> <b>tool,</b> the construction of which is the nearest thing to simple and manufacturing costs are as low as possible. With the tool to be developed it could be possible to manufacture different kind of end products with minimal tool modifications. As a result of the development process, a modular structured <b>forming</b> <b>tool</b> was created, which makes production of different types of end products possible only by changing a few form giving components into the tool. Besides the flexibility on the end products, a significant cost advantage is attained in comparison to the integrated structure. The modular structure also significantly reduces the amount of components that are needed in the <b>tool.</b> Keywords: <b>Forming</b> <b>tool,</b> modular, manufacturing costs...|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} basic types of bending on a press brake, each {{is defined by}} the {{relationship}} of the end tool position to the thickness of the material. These three are Air Bending, Bottoming and Coining. The configuration of the tools for these three types of bending are nearly identical. A die with a long rail <b>form</b> <b>tool</b> with a radiused tip that locates the inside profile of the bend is called a punch. Punches are usually attached to the ram of the machine by clamps and move to produce the bending force. A die with a long rail <b>form</b> <b>tool</b> that has concave or V shaped lengthwise channel that locate the outside profile of the form is called a die. Dies are usually stationary and located under the material on the bed of the machine. Note that some locations do not differentiate between the two different kinds of dies (punches and dies.) The other types of bending listed use specially designed tools or machines to perform the work.|$|E

It featured the ACE report writer, used to extract data from the database and present it to users for easy reading. It also featured the PERFORM screen <b>form</b> <b>tool,</b> which allowed a user to interactively query and edit the data in the database. The final release of this product was version 3.30 in early 1986.|$|E
50|$|For the {{machining}} of complex shapes, {{it is common}} to use form tools. This contrasts with the cutting that is performed on an engine lathe where the cutting tool is usually a single-point tool. A <b>form</b> <b>tool</b> has the form or contour of the final part but in reverse, so it cuts the material leaving the desired component shape. This contrasts to a single-point tool, which cuts on one point at a time and the shape of the component is dictated by the motion of the tool rather than its shape.|$|E

40|$|A major aspect {{regarding}} {{the production of}} fiber reinforced materials are the expensive costs. This applies in particular {{for the production of}} <b>forming</b> <b>tools</b> in small quantities. Therefore, the overall goal of this study is the functional verification of an adaptronic <b>forming</b> <b>tool.</b> With the assistance of this device it is possible to mold the geometry of several components. Additionally there are further fields of application like the mobile operation. The main elements of the adaptronic <b>forming</b> <b>tool</b> are a frame, a shaping granulate and some silicon foils, which separates the granulate from the molded component. After the forming process, a vacuum is used to harden the granulate. Because of the permanent evacuation of the frame, the granulate is keeping the form. As part of this project such a <b>forming</b> <b>tool</b> is being designed and build. Furthermore some experiments were preformed to analyze the steadiness of different types of granulate. Finally some production tests were made and these build specimens were compared with the master form to see the deviation...|$|R
40|$|For {{lightweight}} construction of security relevant parts {{the use of}} high-strength aluminium alloys plays an increasing role. Hence, in <b>forming</b> processes <b>tools</b> are subject to severe stress. Especially abrasive wear and adhesive properties require the application of lubricants and separators. Due to environmental compatibility and enhanced energy efficiency a minimum of additives is wanted. For this reason the tribological system between tool and workpiece has {{to be influenced by}} appropriate surface treatment or coating techniques. For design of <b>forming</b> <b>tools,</b> surface properties and the resulting loading conditions have to be adapted. Appropriate coatings are selected and guidelines for the design of the <b>forming</b> <b>tools</b> are worked out by using numerical simulations...|$|R

40|$|In {{the sheet}} metal forming {{industry}} lubricants are applied in forming processes to expand the technological boundaries by reducing friction and wear. The friction between tool and sheet metal {{is crucial to the}} deep drawing process. Due to economic and ecological reasons the aim of the manufacturers is to reduce or even avoid the use of lubricants. Consequently, this approach enables both a shortening of the process chains and an essential saving of resources. The advantages of structured <b>forming</b> <b>tools</b> in lubricated processes concerning the reduction of the coefficient of friction by the appearance of lubricating micro pockets are well-known. However, without using any lubricant this effect does not work. In this case the contact area is reduced by structuring the <b>forming</b> <b>tool</b> which affects the tribological system. In this paper the influence of microstructures with different geometries and surface treatments (uncoated / a-C:H:Si-coating) on the coefficient of friction in dry metal forming of the alloy AA 5182 is compared to the frictional behaviour of unstructured <b>forming</b> <b>tools</b> using lubricant as reference. Before coating, the <b>forming</b> <b>tools</b> are machined by milling to generate tribologically effective microstructures. With the use of a strip drawing plant the effects of different surface microstructures and materials on the coefficient of friction are investigated...|$|R

40|$|Sheet {{metal forming}} {{is one of}} the major forming {{processes}} adopted for manufacturing of thin walled components (thickness < 3 mm) in aerospace and automobile industry. The final form and dimensions of the sheet metal components are affected by several factors such as material characteristics, thickness, bend radius, flange length, spring back, etc,. Among these, spring back is considered to be the major factor affecting the bend angle on the component. Thus, to achieve the nominal bend angle, it is necessary to predict the bend angle on the <b>form</b> <b>tool</b> with due consideration given to spring back. This work proposes a relation for the bend angle on the <b>form</b> <b>tool</b> with respect to the nominal bend angle on the component for a given sheet thickness and material. The relation was verified for Al 2024 alloy sheet metal components of thickness ranging between 1 - 2 mm, and the results were found to be very encouraging...|$|E
