25|$|Immediately after Grouping, new engines were {{numbered}} in {{the series}} used by their constituent company that had ordered them; including the onward transfer of older locomotives to the appropriate <b>duplicate</b> <b>list.</b> Subsequently the new numbering systems of 1923 and 1924 {{were used in the}} same way.|$|R

5000|$|Early {{members of}} the class were {{numbered}} in a continuous series of new numbers 395-406. Some later batches re-used numbers of withdrawn or duplicated locomotives.

Between 1908 and 1924, 54 locomotives were renumbered to the <b>duplicate</b> <b>list</b> by prefixing their existing number with a [...] "0".|$|R
