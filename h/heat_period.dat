5000|$|In older {{generation}} diesel-engine vehicles, unlike in a gasoline-engine vehicle, for a 'cold start' the operator did not simply turn {{the key to}} the [...] "start" [...] position and have the engine immediately start. Instead, the operator activated the glow plug(s) for a time first. Early diesels used the 'Thermostart' type glowplug in the inlet manifold. These take 20 seconds to achieve working temperature and the vehicle operator had to manually time (or guess) when the 20 seconds had elapsed. With in-cylinder glow plugs, technological improvements included a warning light on the dash to indicate how long the preheating should last. The preheating phase was also made to be automatically activated when the operator turned {{the key to the}} [...] "on" [...] position for a long duration; the glowplug relay switches the glowplugs on, and a light (see picture at right) on the instrument cluster illuminates. This process is called [...] "pre-heating" [...] or [...] "glowing". Many modern diesels automatically activate their glow plugs when the operator unlocks the vehicle or opens the door to the car, thus simplifying the process and shortening the time the operator has to wait before the engine will start. According to Bosch: [...] "Older engines with Thermostart manifold plugs used a glow period of up to 20 seconds whereas more modern engines use around a 6 to 8 second <b>heat</b> <b>period</b> and provide after glow at a reduced voltage." ...|$|E

The {{purpose of this}} paper is to investigate the tensile property of laminated epoxy resin composites reinforced by carbon fiber plain woven fabric with different <b>heating</b> <b>period</b> of time at relatively high temperature. For this purpose, the tensile tests of laminated resin composites are carried out at 150 °C and 180 °C with 15 minutes, 10 hours and 30 hours <b>heating</b> <b>period</b> of time, respectively. The reasons for the variations of tensile property of these composites with different <b>heating</b> <b>period</b> of time at 150 °C and 180 °C are analyzed. At 150 °C and 180 °C，with <b>heating</b> <b>period</b> of time increasing the tensile strength of samples keep the same level. However at 180 °C the average tensile strength of samples is decreased by 14. 95 % compared with that at 150 °C and the variation coefficient (CV) of tensile strengths at 180 °C is much more than that at 150 °C. These show that the tensile strength of resin laminated composites is sensitive at high temperature, although the tensile strength of resin laminated composites keeps the same level at same temperature with different <b>heating</b> <b>period</b> of time. The reason of the tensile strength of resin laminated composites decreased at high temperature is that resin has been damaged，which losing the adhesion of fiber and resin, so that these make resin and fiber can not bear the tensile load together.

40|$|Camel is a {{seasonal}} breeder and their reproduction is different {{as compared to}} other livestock as {{both male and female}} come into heat during the breeding season. The terminology used in case of males is “Thoot”, “Rutt ” or “Musth”. Usually the <b>heat</b> <b>period</b> is from November to March.

During <b>heat</b> <b>period</b> the male emits a black pigment from his pole gland (skin gland) which helps him to attract the females. The male camel has a specialized inflatable diverticulum of the soft palate called as ‘gula’. When the animal is angry or displaying this structure protrudes out from the mouth. The ‘gula’ is extruded when the camel is physically restrained and protrudes temporarily when the animal is chemically restrained (Flower, 1978). The gestation period in camels is 390 days with average birth weight 35 - 40 kgs. The adult camel weighs 450 - 750 kgs. Mating The act of mating in camels is called as “lakhana” in Rajasthan. Generally one stallion can cover 20 to 50 she camels in one season. More than 50 services should not be allowed in one breeding season.

40|$|The present {{investigation}} was undertaken to study certain factors affecting the productive and reproductive performances of crossbred dairy cows maintained at fifteen dairy farms in Chittagong metropolitan area, Bangladesh {{over from the}} years 1992 to 2005. The data consisted of phenotypic values of five dairy traits such as age at first calving(AFC), post partum <b>heat</b> <b>period</b> (PPHP), calving interval (CI), lactation length (LL) and lactation milk yield (LMY) of 480 different crossbreds of Friesian cows were studied. The analyses of variance indicated {{that the effect of}} the farm was significant (P≤ 0. 05) for all traits, whereas none of the traits influence by the season of birth. The calving years were significant (P≤ 0. 05) for CI, LL and LMY. Least-squares means illustrated that the effect of lactation number on PPHP, LL and LMY was significant (P≤ 0. 05).). It can be concluded that satisfactory management and appropriate genetic improvement strategies would result in improving performance of crossbred dairy cows...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparative}} study on productive and reproductive performance of crossbred and indigenous cows under the small holder dairying condition {{was conducted in}} Gaibandha district of Bangladesh. A sample of 96 dairy cows were selected randomly; of which 49 were crossbred cows and the other 47 were indigenous dairy cows from 50 small dairy farms. The productive performance (milk yield and lactation period) of crossbred cows were significantly (P= 0. 01) higher than the indigenous dairy cows. Post partum <b>heat</b> <b>period,</b> calving to first service and dry period of the indigenous cows were lower (but not significantly) than crossbred cows. But service per conception and calving interval of indigenous cows were significantly (P= 0. 01) lower than the crossbred cows. The cost benefit ratio of raising crossbred and indigenous dairy cows were 1 : 1. 13 and 1 : 1. 02 respectively. Although, reproductive performance of crossbred cows were better than indigenous cows but considering the other traits it may be concluded that the raising of crossbred cows were more economic than the raising of indigenous dairy cows...|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to compare the}} productive and reproductive performance of crossbred and indigenous cows {{as well as the}} relative profitability of crossbred and indigenous cows under small holder dairy farming. From this study it was seen that the milk yield and lactation period were 4. 10 litre/day and 266 day respectively in crossbred and 2. 28 litre/day and 220 days respectively in indigenous cows. The variation in the length of post partum <b>heat</b> <b>period</b> and calving to first services were not statistically significant between the crossbred & indigenous cows. The length of calving interval were statistically significant be to crossbred and indigenous cows. Among the costs (Feed cost, housing cost labor cost, housing cost labor cost, treatment cost and A. I. charge), except the housing costs all costs were statistically significant (P< 0. 01) between the crossbred and indigenous cows. The returns (sale proceeds of milk, value of cowdung, value of calf and price of empty gunny bags) of the crossbreds were higher than the indigenous cows...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} an {{analysis}} of temperatures of ground masses in the proximities of linear and slinky-type HGHE (horizontal ground heat exchanger). It evaluates and compares the potentials of HGHEs and ambient air. The reason and aim of the verification was to gain knowledge of the temperature course of the monitored low-temperature heat pump energy sources during <b>heating</b> <b>periods</b> and periods of stagnation and to analyse the knowledge {{in terms of the}} potential to use those sources for heat pumps. The study was conducted in the years 2012 – 2015 during three <b>heating</b> <b>periods</b> and three periods of HGHEs stagnation. The results revealed that linear HGHE had the highest temperature potential of the observed low-temperature heat pump energy sources. The average daily temperatures of the ground mass surrounding the linear HGHE were the highest ranging from 7. 08 °C to 9. 20 °C during the <b>heating</b> <b>periods,</b> and having the lowest temperature variation range of 12. 62 – 15. 14 K, the relative frequency of the average daily temperatures of the ground mass being the highest at 22. 64 % in the temperature range containing the mode of all monitored temperatures in a recorded interval of [4. 10, 6. 00] °C.

40|$|Purpose / Context - The {{winter in}} the severe cold area of China is long and cold, with a long <b>heating</b> <b>period.</b> In recent years, the indoor air {{temperature}} during heating in residential buildings kept increas-ing. In order to study the thermal comfort and adaptation in such an overheated environment, a field study {{was carried out in}} Harbin. Methodology / Approach - A tracking investigation was conducted during the <b>heating</b> <b>period</b> in 2013 - 2014. 10 apartments were selected from 9 buildings in 5 residential communities, with 20 par-ticipants. The indoor and outdoor air temperatures, as well as relative humidity were monitored con-tinuously, while the residents were interviewed on their thermal responses online every week. 308 valid questionnaires were collected. The <b>heating</b> <b>periods</b> were separated into three phases based on the outdoor temperature. Results - The results show that the mean indoor air temperatures in the early-, mid- and late-heating periods were 23. 6 °C, 24. 3 °C and 25. 0 °C, respectively, which were larger than or close to the upper limit recommended by thermal comfort standards, and slightly higher than the related thermal neutral temperatures. With the heating process, the mean clothing insulation of residents decreased. Open-ing windows and reducing clothing were mainly taken by the residents to adapt to the overheated environment. Key Findings / Implications - The neutral temperature rose with the mean air temperature increas-ing in the <b>heating</b> <b>period.</b> The lower limit of the temperature range in winter is to be suggested in heat-ing design to achieve a sustainable indoor environment. Originality - It was found that human thermal neutral temperatures in residential buildings changed with the indoor, and many evidences of thermal adaptation were got...|$|R
40|$|The Thermal Enhanced Vapor Extraction System (TEVES), which {{combines}} powerline frequency heating (PLF) and radio frequency (RF) heating with vacuum soil vapor extraction, {{was used to}} effectively remove volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) from a pit in the chemical waste landfill (CWL) at Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) within a two month <b>heating</b> <b>period.</b> Volume average temperatures of 83 {degrees}C and 112 {degrees}C were reached for the PLF and RF <b>heating</b> <b>periods,</b> respectively, within the 15 ft x 45 ft x 18. 5 ft deep treated volume. This resulted in the removal of 243 lb of measured toxic organic compounds (VOCs and SVOCs), 55 gallons of oil, and 11, 000 gallons {{of water from the}} site. Reductions of up to 99 % in total chromatographic organics (TCO) was achieved in the heated zone.
