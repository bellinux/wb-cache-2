25|$|When he went {{north to}} {{suppress}} the Phra Fang faction, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> monks in the north were lax and undisciplined. He invited ecclesiastical dignitaries from the capital to teach those monks and brought them back {{in line with the}} main teachings of Buddhism. Even though King Taksin had applied himself to reforming the Buddhist religion after its period of decline following the loss of Ayutthaya to Burma, gradually bringing it back to the normalcy it enjoyed during the Ayutthaya kingdom, since his reign was so brief {{he was not able to}} do very much.|$|E
25|$|While Master Tara Singh {{confused}} Rajagopalchari's offer {{with the}} Muslim League demand <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> any division of Punjab {{would leave the}} Sikhs divided between Pakistan and Hindustan. He espoused the doctrine of self-reliance, opposed partition and called for independence {{on the grounds that}} no single religious community should control Punjab. Other Sikhs argued that just as Muslims feared Hindu domination the Sikhs also feared Muslim domination. Sikhs warned the British government that the morale of Sikh troops in the British Army would be affected if Pakistan was forced on them. Since Hindus seemed more concerned about the rest of India than Punjab, Master Tara Singh refused to ally with them and preferred to approach the British directly. Giani Kartar Singh drafted the scheme of a separate Sikh state if India was divided.|$|E
25|$|The {{collection}} {{at that time}} went from the small four-toed forest-dwelling Orohippus from the Eocene through three-toed species such as Miohippus to species more like the modern horse. By looking at their teeth <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that,</b> as the size grew larger and the toes reduced, the teeth changed from those of a browser to those of a grazer. All such changes {{could be explained by}} a general alteration in habitat from forest to grassland. And, it is now known, that is what did happen over large areas of North America from the Eocene to the Pleistocene: the ultimate causative agent was global temperature reduction (see Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum). The modern account of the evolution of the horse has many other members, and the overall appearance of the tree of descent is more like a bush than a straight line.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> then, <b>that</b> she was {{struggling}} to preserve her composure.|$|R
60|$|Elizabeth was {{bending over}} her dog, but even Tavernake, unobservant though <b>he</b> was, <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> she was shaken.|$|R
6000|$|... "Maybe it's {{that crazy}} hermit," [...] {{suggested}} Whopper, {{and gave a}} little shiver. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> still <b>see</b> <b>that</b> impish face glaring at him. [...] "Be careful." ...|$|R
500|$|Victor was {{disappointed}} that Villatte had failed to block the Cádiz road for longer, {{but he was still}} confident that his main force could drive the Allies into the sea. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the bulk of the Spanish troops had taken station opposite Villatte and, on hearing reports that Barrosa Ridge was deserted, realised that here was an opportunity to take this commanding position. [...] Ruffin was ordered to occupy the heights while Leval struck at Graham's troops in the woods, and three squadrons of dragoons were sent around the Cerro to take the coastal track.|$|E
500|$|Frederick {{conducted}} a perfunctory reconnaissance of his enemy's position, {{accompanied by a}} forest ranger and an officer who had previously been stationed in Frankfurt. He also consulted a peasant who, though garrulous, was uninformed about military needs: the peasant told the King that a natural obstacle between the Red Grange (a large farmstead between Kunersdorf and Frankfurt's outer city) and Kunersdorf was unpassable; what the peasant did not know was that the Russians had been there long enough to construct a causeway linking these two sections. [...] Looking to the east through his telescope, Frederick saw some wooded hills, called the Reppen Forest, and he believed he could use them to screen an advance, much like he had done at Leuthen. [...] He did not send scouts to reconnoiter the land or question locals about {{the ground in the}} forest. [...] Furthermore, through his glass <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the Russians were facing west and north, and their fortifications were stronger on the west. He decided that all the Allies were facing northwest and that the forest was readily passable.|$|E
500|$|In August, Wilder-Neligan led his {{battalion}} {{during the}} early fighting of the Hundred Days Offensive, which began on 8 August 1918 with the Battle of Amiens. During the fighting for Lihons on 10 August, he brought his battalion up into close support using an unconventional method. He moved [...] forward of his unit, carrying a signalling lamp on his back, using it to transmit orders to his unit to halt or advance. By this method he brought his battalion into a position from which it could support his old unit, the 9th, with only one casualty. From his advanced position, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the flank of the 9th had been held up, and he sent his strongest company {{to assist in the}} capture of Crépey Wood. On the following day, Wilder-Neligan was placed in command of a force consisting of his own battalion and the 12th Battalion for the capture of Lihons itself. Despite heavy mist, he showed his clear grasp of the tactical situation when he realised that German counter-attacks were taking advantage of a gap between the forward troops, and quickly cleared it using supporting troops. During the fighting from 10 to 14 August, the 10th Battalion suffered 123 casualties.|$|E
60|$|Just then Dick {{came out}} of his door. Belding eyed him keenly. The only change <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> was <b>that</b> Dick had put on a hat and a pair of heavy gloves.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, what do {{you want}} to see me about, then?" [...] {{questioned}} Dave. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> readily <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the bully had something on his mind which troubled him greatly.|$|R
60|$|Bostil saw Lucy's {{golden hair}} {{whipping}} {{out from the}} flame-streaked mane. And then <b>he</b> <b>could</b> only <b>see</b> <b>that</b> red brute of a horse. Wildfire before the wind! Bostil thought of the leaping prairie flame, storm-driven.|$|R
2500|$|After {{encouraging}} legion X, Caesar went to {{the right}} wing. Things looked bad. [...] <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the men of XII Victrix were crammed so closely together in one mass by their standards {{that they could not}} fight effectively. [...] All (six) centurions of the fourth cohort were dead, its standard bearer killed and the standard missing. [...] Of the remaining cohorts, almost all the centurions were either wounded or killed; Baculus, the legion’s primipilus, a fine soldier, had received so many minor and serious wounds that he could barely stand. The Nervii were attacking vigorously from lower ground and pressing at the front and both flanks. [...] Caesar could see some men were shirking and {{trying to get to the}} rear; others were slowly ceasing effective resistance. There were no reserves. This was the crisis-point. [...] He took a shield from a soldier at the rear and {{went to the}} first line. [...] Calling his centurions by name, he ordered them to have the soldiers advance (signa inferre) and the maniples open up and extend. [...] As he tells it, his arrival brought hope and boosted the soldiers’ morale. Every man was now keen to do well in front of his general. As a result, the enemy assault was checked slightly.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> only partial {{intelligence}} of the case reached her.|$|E
60|$|An {{hour later}} he {{returned}} home; <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> {{his mother had}} been crying.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{it might}} have been worse," [...] {{declared}} Jack, as cheerfully as <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> because <b>he</b> <b>could</b> easily <b>see</b> <b>that</b> Gif {{was in a state of}} mind bordering on desperation. [...] "Nobody is seriously hurt, I hope?" ...|$|R
60|$|Pritchard {{stared at}} him. There was {{something}} amazing about this young man's attitude, something which <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not wholly grasp. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> too, <b>that</b> Tavernake's words were so few {{simply because he}} was trembling {{under the influence of}} an immense passion.|$|R
60|$|An icy blast {{that set}} them {{shivering}} went roaring through the wood, {{but they were}} too intent to heed it, and Curtis {{picked up one of}} the garments. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> only <b>that</b> it was a jacket, for darkness was closing in suddenly.|$|R
60|$|Martin was sore beset. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> Ruth {{was hanging}} eagerly upon his answer.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked up}} at him, and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> she was {{inclined}} to believe him.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> {{her mind}} was not clear. The perplexity was strong in her good-natured face. So he waited.|$|E
60|$|Ned did {{not much}} like being left alone, {{but he made}} no objections, since <b>he</b> <b>could</b> readily <b>see</b> <b>that</b> it was of the highest {{importance}} that they should learn if {{the man and his}} companion were watching for them.|$|R
60|$|He {{disappeared}} {{through a}} doorway and the fun-loving Rover sat down. He {{was in no}} easy frame of mind, for <b>he</b> <b>could</b> plainly <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the letter had disturbed the ranch owner greatly and {{that the man was}} suspicious.|$|R
60|$|Then the woodchopper {{came and}} looked upon {{the face of}} Sir Ewaine, and he beheld that it was white like to death. And <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>that</b> Sir Ewaine breathed, {{wherefore}} {{he thought that the}} wounded man was dead.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{you took}} their baggage away, didn't you?" [...] {{questioned}} Dave, for <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> {{the old man}} was holding something back.|$|E
6000|$|She was keenly interested, and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the {{previous}} clash {{between them was}} already forgotten. Her disappointment was plain as she confessed: ...|$|E
60|$|Joan recoiled {{from him}} in panic, tearing herself from his arms and going {{backward}} several steps. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> she was really frightened.|$|E
60|$|His foot {{had been}} {{slightly}} sprained when the shock came, {{but in the}} excitement he hardly noticed the pain. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> readily <b>see</b> <b>that</b> assistance was needed on all sides, {{and he was not}} slow to render all that lay in his power.|$|R
60|$|And in {{faithful}} Bertrand's deep-set eyes {{there came}} a strange, far-off look, almost of premonition, as if in his mind <b>he</b> <b>could</b> already <b>see</b> <b>that</b> lonely island rock in the Atlantic, and the great gambler there, eating out his heart with vain and bitter regrets.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't Fred get {{half the}} thrashing?" [...] {{questioned}} Randy Rover, quizzically, for <b>he</b> <b>could</b> readily <b>see</b> <b>that</b> his parent {{was not as}} angry as his words seemed to imply. [...] "I don't like to be selfish, you know. He can have {{more than his share}} if he wants it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{might run}} the car myself," [...] {{answered}} Dick. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the chauffeur was much worried over the news he had received.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr Palliser!" [...] said she;--and {{though she}} made no scene, though she merely glanced upon him once, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> he was wrong.|$|E
60|$|The smile deepened slightly. Little lines {{appeared}} {{at the sides of}} her eyes. So far from being annoyed, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> she was laughing.|$|E
60|$|He {{placed the}} lantern upon an upright sack of mealies, and {{carefully}} balanced it before <b>he</b> answered. Jess <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was {{taking time to}} consider.|$|R
60|$|But it {{was only}} {{occasionally}} that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> bear the fatigue of such excursions. Ordinarily he lay on a couch in the farmhouse kitchen, where <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> all <b>that</b> was going on there; while in warm summer weather he was wheeled outside, and lay {{in the shade of}} the great elm, in front of the house.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>could</b> already <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{should be}} able to extract no consent from her; he felt rather sick. [...] "It's {{extraordinary}} to me that you should n't be more afraid of being found out," [...] he said after a moment's reflection. [...] "There are two or three possible accidents." ...|$|R
