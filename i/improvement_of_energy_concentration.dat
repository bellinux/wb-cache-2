40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{research}} is to analyze the operation of gas-lift bubble-type vehicle and clarify the nature <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> <b>concentration</b> areas <b>of</b> working liquid fluctuation motion under the impact of external acoustic radiation. The effect of cultural liquid indignation inside the vehicle?s working volume has an indisputable advantage. This effect can be achieved without mechanical mixing devices and technological deficiencies arising out of their use. The construction <b>of</b> areas <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> <b>concentration</b> as confocal cylindrical caustic surfaces to the internal surface of bubble-type vehicle {{is caused by the}} present aberration of sound-waves, generated in the casing, {{as well as by the}} construction of the proper wave-size vehicle. In addition, the amount <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> <b>concentration</b> areas <b>of</b> working liquid motion can be increased under certain conditions at the expense of additional flat radial caustic surfaces. Totally, the dynamic state created eliminates the stagnant areas presence, dramatically increases the heat-mass exchange efficiency and the produce quality. Therefore, the coincidence resonance is the operating element of gas-lift bubble-type vehicle. ????? ???????????? ???????? ?????? ?????? ??????????? ???????????? ???????? ? ????????? ??????? ????????????? ??? ???????????? ??????? ?????????????? ???????? ??????? ???????? ??? ????????? ???????? ????????????? ?????????. ??????????? ?????? ??????????? ????????????? ???????? ?????? ???????? ?????? ???????? ????? ?? ????????????? ????????????, ??? ??????????? ??? ???????????? ?????????????? ????????? ? ??????????? ?? ???????????? ??????????? ???????????????? ????????. ?????????? ??? ???????????? ??????? ? ???? ???????????? ?????????? ??????????? ???????????? ???????? ?????????????? ??????? ??????????????? ????????? ?????????? ???????????? ? ??????? ???????? ???? ? ????????????? ???????????????? ????????? ??????? ????????. ??? ????????? ???????? ?????????? ??? ???????????? ??????? ???????? ??????? ???????? ????? ???? ????????? ?? ???? ?????????????? ??????? ?????????? ???????. ? ????? ???????????? ????????? ???????????? ????????? ????????? ??????? ????????? ???, ??????????? ???????? ????????????? ???????????????? ? ???????? ?????????????? ????????. ????? ???????, ??????? ????????? ??????????? ???????????? ???????? ?????????? ???????? ??????????...|$|R
