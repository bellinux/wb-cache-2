500|$|The {{transition}} between the top left, perhaps where the artist began, {{and the standard}} pattern, is somewhat awkward, leaving a rather bald spot (for an interlace pattern) {{to the left of}} the first curving yellow vertical. [...] The change in pattern pushes the halfway point of the upper panel rather off-centre to the right, whereas in the lower panel it falls slightly to the left of <b>dead</b> <b>centre.</b> [...] These vagaries in the design suggest that it was done freehand, without marking-out the pattern using compasses for example. [...] The lowest horizontal raised line is not straight, being higher at the left, probably because of an error in the marking or drilling of the holes in the cover board through which the ends of the cord run. [...] The simple twist or chain border in yellow between the two raised frames resembles an element in an initial in the Durham Gospel Book Fragment, an important earlier manuscript from Lindisfarne.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the crank}} {{is driven by}} the {{connecting}} rod, a problem arises when the crank is at top <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> (0°) or bottom <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> (180°). [...] At these points in the crank's cycle, a force on the connecting rod causes no torque on the crank. [...] Therefore, if the crank is stationary and happens to be at one of these two points, it cannot be started moving by the connecting rod. [...] For this reason, in steam locomotives, whose wheels are driven by cranks, the connecting rods are attached to the wheels at points separated by some angle, so that regardless of the position of the wheels when the engine starts, at least one connecting rod will be able to exert torque to start the train.|$|E

2500|$|The {{cylinders}} are double-acting, with steam {{admitted to}} {{each side of the}} piston in turn. In a two-cylinder locomotive, one cylinder is located {{on each side of the}} vehicle. The cranks are set 90° out of phase. During a full rotation of the driving wheel, steam provides four power strokes; each cylinder receives two injections of steam per revolution. The first stroke is to the front of the piston and the second stroke to the rear of the piston; hence two working strokes. Consequently, two deliveries of steam onto each piston face in the two cylinders generates a full revolution of the driving wheel. Each piston is attached to the driving axle on each side by a connecting rod, and the driving wheels are connected together by coupling rods to transmit power from the main driver to the other wheels. Note that at the two [...] "dead centres", when the connecting rod is on the same axis as the crankpin on the driving wheel, the connecting rod applies no torque to the wheel. Therefore, if both cranksets could be at [...] "dead centre" [...] at the same time, and the wheels should happen to stop in this position, the locomotive could not start moving. Therefore, the crankpins are attached to the wheels at a 90° angle to each other, so only one side can be at <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> at a time.|$|E

50|$|The {{operational}} characteristics of free-piston engines {{differ from those}} of conventional, crankshaft engines. The main difference is due to the piston motion not being restricted by a crankshaft in the free-piston engine, leading to the potentially valuable feature of variable compression ratio. This does, however, also present a control challenge, since the position of the <b>dead</b> <b>centres</b> must be accurately controlled in order to ensure fuel ignition and efficient combustion, and to avoid excessive in-cylinder pressures or, worse, the piston hitting the cylinder head.|$|R
40|$|The study {{investigates the}} {{mechanism}} of ring-liner lubrication {{in the vicinity of}} the top and bottom <b>dead</b> <b>centres</b> of an internal combustion engine. Predicting lubricant transient behaviour is critical when the inlet reversal leads to thin films and inherent metal-to-metal interaction. It was found that the cavitation, which is located at the trailing edge of the contact before reversal, briefly survives after reversal as a confined bubble at the leading edge. This depletes the film promoting starvation. Several algorithms were compared. It is concluded that the lubricant film is thinner than initially thought...|$|R

60|$|The second {{effect is}} {{scarcely}} less patent. How slow their progress has been, if for centuries now {{it can be}} called progress at all, is world-known. Chinese conservatism has passed into a proverb. The pendulum of pulsation in the Middle Kingdom long since {{came to a stop}} at the medial point of rest. Centre of civilization, as they call themselves, one would imagine that their mind-machinery had got caught on their own <b>dead</b> <b>centre,</b> and now could not be made to move. Life, which elsewhere is a condition of unstable equilibrium, there is of a fatally stable kind. For the Chinaman's disinclination to progress is something more than vis inertiae; it has become an ardent devotion to the status quo. Jostled, he at once settles back to his previous condition again; much as more materially, after a lifetime spent in California, at his death his body is punctiliously embalmed and sent home across five thousand miles of sea for burial. With the Japanese the condition of affairs is somewhat different. Their tendency to stand still is of a purely passive kind. It is a state of neutral equilibrium, stationary of itself but perfectly responsive to an impulse from without. Left to their own devices, they are conservative enough, but they instantly copy a more advanced civilization the moment they get a chance. This proclivity on their part is not out of keeping with our theory. On the contrary, it is precisely what was to have been expected; for we see the very same apparent contradiction in characters we are thrown with every day. Imitation is the natural substitute for originality. The less strong a man's personality the more prone is he to adopt the ideas of others, on the same principle that a void more easily admits a foreign body than does space that is already occupied; or as a blank piece of paper takes a dye more brilliantly for not being already tinted itself.|$|E

40|$|DOI: [URL] chainrings and novel {{pedal to}} crank {{interfaces}} {{have been designed}} to optimize variables related to cycling performance (e. g. peak crank torque and efficiency), with conflicting results in terms of performance.

Reducing internal work, crank peak torque, and time spent at the top and bottom <b>dead</b> <b>centres</b> (12 o’clock and 6 o’clock positions, respectively) were among the various targets of noncircular chainrings and novel pedal to crank interface design. Changes in joint kinematics without effects on muscle activation were observed when cyclists were assessed using noncircular chainrings and novel pedal to crank interfaces. Conflicting results for economy/efficiency explain the unclear effects of noncircular chainrings on cycling performance and the positive effects of some novel pedal to crank interfaces on cycling economy/efficiency...|$|R

The definitive version is available at: [URL] paper provides a detailed analysis of the compression ring–bore/liner conjunction. The analysis includes ring–bore conformability and global in-plane deformation of ring fitted in situ. The analysis for fitted ring in an out-of-round bore shows very good agreement with precise measurements, using a coordinate measuring machine. The analysis also includes the lubricated conjunction under a transient regime of lubrication, taking into account combined elastohydrodynamics and asperity interactions. The transient nature of the tribological conjunction has been demonstrated, particularly the prevalent mixed/boundary regime of lubrication at the top and bottom <b>dead</b> <b>centres.</b> The analysis is applied to a high performance motorbike engine subjected to very high impact loads and engine speeds of the order of 13 000 r/min.

40|$|Abstract: A general {{approach}} for branch identification and motion domain analysis of Stephenson type six-bar linkages is presented. By applying the Sturm theorem to the input– output polynomial equation, the dead-centre {{positions of the}} linkage are first evaluated and classified into two groups in order to discriminate {{the upper and lower}} bounds of the motion domains. The circuits of the linkage are then identified by matching the <b>dead</b> <b>centres</b> to the branches, which are attributed in accordance with the case where the input is assigned to a joint within the four-bar chain. Finally, the branches and motion domains of the more complicated case where the input is given through one of the uncoupled joints within the five-bar chain, are identified by mapping the circuits onto the domain of the specified input joint. This approach does not rely on the coupler curve of the constituent four-linkmechanism. This is also suitable for computer implementation and can be systematically applied to all types of Stephenson linkages, regardless of the types of joints and the selection of input–output pair...|$|R

We measured surface annuli width and disc diameters of 10 microatolls, from March 1998 to October 2000, and found a mean growth rate of 2. 2 cm/year.

These populations were composed of a few distinct patches of ramet colonies, some of them shaped like fairy rings with <b>dead</b> <b>centres.</b> We measured the size of all colonies and collected samples for detailed morphometric analyses of rhizome growth.

Fouled samples from each of two additional colonies of C. stuns on Faddeyevsky Island were analysed and showed that clones {{of the same species}} at the same site were relatively dissimilar (Dice's similarity index 0. 26 - 0. 43). We then assumed that each ramet colony represented a single genet. Based on the morphometric data, we developed a deterministic growth model that simulates the clonal growth of these species and enabled estimates of the time since establishment of the genets.
