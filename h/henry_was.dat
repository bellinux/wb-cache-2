5|$|<b>Henry</b> <b>was</b> born in Silsbee, Texas. As a child, {{he was a}} big wrestling fan and André the Giant was his {{favorite}} wrestler. While attending a wrestling show in Beaumont, Texas, young Henry tried to touch André as he was walking down the aisle, but tripped over the barricade. André picked him up out of the crowd and put him back behind the barricade. When <b>Henry</b> <b>was</b> 12 years old, his father, Ernest, died of complications from diabetes. When he was 14 years old, <b>Henry</b> <b>was</b> diagnosed with dyslexia.|$|E
5|$|Des Roches {{used his}} new {{authority}} to begin stripping his opponents of their estates, circumventing {{the courts and}} legal process. Complaints from powerful barons such as William Marshal's son Richard grew, and they argued that <b>Henry</b> <b>was</b> failing to protect their legal rights {{as described in the}} 1225 charters. A fresh civil war broke out between des Roches and Richard's followers. Des Roches sent armies into Richard's lands in Ireland and South Wales. In response, Richard allied himself with Prince Llywelyn, and his own supporters rose up in rebellion in England. <b>Henry</b> <b>was</b> unable to gain a clear military advantage and became concerned that Louis of France might seize the opportunity to invade Brittany – where the truce was about to expire – while he was distracted at home.|$|E
5|$|During this period, neither William nor Robert {{seems to}} have trusted Henry. Waiting until the {{rebellion}} against William Rufus was safely over, Henry returned to England in July 1088. He met with the King {{but was unable to}} persuade him to grant him their mother's estates, and travelled back to Normandy in the autumn. While he had been away, however, Odo, the Bishop of Bayeux, who regarded Henry as a potential competitor, had convinced Robert that <b>Henry</b> <b>was</b> conspiring against the duke with William Rufus. On landing, Odo seized Henry and imprisoned him in Neuilly-la-Forêt, and Robert took back the county of the Cotentin. <b>Henry</b> <b>was</b> held there over the winter, but in the spring of 1089 the senior elements of the Normandy nobility prevailed upon Robert to release him.|$|E

5|$|Henry I (c. 1068– 1 December 1135), {{also known}} as Henry Beauclerc, was King of England from 1100 to his death. <b>Henry</b> <b>was</b> the fourth son of William the Conqueror and was educated in Latin and the liberal arts. On William's death in 1087, Henry's elder {{brothers}} Robert Curthose and William Rufus inherited Normandy and England, respectively, but <b>Henry</b> <b>was</b> left landless. Henry purchased the County of Cotentin in western Normandy from Robert, but William and Robert deposed him in 1091. Henry gradually rebuilt his power base in the Cotentin and allied himself with William against Robert. <b>Henry</b> <b>was</b> present when William died in a hunting accident in 1100, and he seized the English throne, promising at his coronation to correct many of William's less popular policies. Henry married Matilda of Scotland but continued to have {{a large number of}} mistresses by whom he had many illegitimate children.|$|E
5|$|Henry VIII (28 June 1491– 28 January 1547) was King of England from 21 April 1509 {{until his}} death. <b>Henry</b> <b>was</b> the second Tudor monarch, {{succeeding}} his father, Henry VII.|$|E

5|$|<b>Henry</b> <b>was</b> {{appointed}} {{to the office of}} Sheriff of Surrey early in the reign of King Richard I. He was also Sheriff of Kent during Richard's reign, in 1190 as well as one of the Sheriffs of London from 1187 to 1189. <b>Henry</b> <b>was</b> only one of six sheriffs that retained office after the accession of Richard I. He owed his appointments to the influence of William Longchamp, Richard's chancellor. He was also Warden of the Mint in 1191. Henry lost his offices when Longchamp fell from favour in 1192. He died sometime between Michaelmas 1192 and Michaelmas 1193.|$|E
5|$|<b>Henry</b> <b>was</b> born in Winchester Castle on 1 October 1207. He was {{the eldest}} son of King John and Isabella of Angoulême. Little is known of Henry's early life. He was {{initially}} looked after by a wet nurse called Ellen {{in the south of}} England, away from John's itinerant court, and probably had close ties to his mother. Henry had four legitimate younger brothers and sisters – Richard, Joan, Isabella and Eleanor – and various older illegitimate siblings. In 1212 his education was entrusted to Peter des Roches, the Bishop of Winchester; under his direction, <b>Henry</b> <b>was</b> given military training by Philip D'Aubigny and taught to ride, probably by Ralph of St Samson.|$|E

5|$|<b>Henry</b> <b>was</b> by now fully {{determined}} {{to take the}} throne, but presenting a rationale for this action proved a dilemma. It was argued that Richard, through his tyranny and misgovernment, had rendered himself unworthy of being king. However, <b>Henry</b> <b>was</b> not next in line to the throne; the heir presumptive was Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March, who was descended from Edward III's third son, the second to survive to adulthood, Lionel of Antwerp. Bolingbroke's father, John of Gaunt, was Edward's fourth son, the third to survive to adulthood. The problem was solved by emphasising Henry's descent in a direct male line, whereas March's descent was through his grandmother.|$|E
5|$|<b>Henry</b> <b>was</b> {{frequently}} {{used as an}} ambassador by the king, James I of Scotland. According to the 16th century Bishop of Ross and historian John Lesley, <b>Henry</b> <b>was</b> {{one of the men}} sent to England to arrange the ransom of King James - held in England for most of his youth, not being released until 1424. On 9 June 1425, he and other prelates received a safe-conduct from King Henry VI of England enabling them to travel through England on their way to visit Pope Martin V at Rome. In 1428, <b>Henry</b> <b>was</b> the leader of an embassy sent to King Charles VII of France for a marriage proposal and to renew the Franco-Scottish alliance, and in January 1430, was sent into England for discussion of various grievances. On 31 March 1434, Lichton is found in attendance at the Council of Basel, though no more details of his activities there have survived.|$|E
5|$|<b>Henry</b> <b>was</b> said by chroniclers to be good-looking, red-haired, freckled, {{with a large}} head; he had a short, stocky {{body and}} was bow-legged from riding. Often he was scruffily dressed. Not as {{reserved}} as his mother Matilda, nor as charming as his father Geoffrey, <b>Henry</b> <b>was</b> famous for his energy and drive. He was also infamous for his piercing stare, bullying, bursts of temper and, on occasion, his sullen refusal to speak at all. Some of these outbursts, however, may have been theatrical and for effect. <b>Henry</b> <b>was</b> said to have understood {{a wide range of}} languages, including English, but spoke only Latin and French. In his youth Henry enjoyed warfare, hunting and other adventurous pursuits; {{as the years went by}} he put increasing energy into judicial and administrative affairs and became more cautious, but throughout his life he was energetic and frequently impulsive.|$|E

5|$|Henry's son, {{also called}} <b>Henry,</b> <b>was</b> {{born at the}} castle of Grosmont in Monmouthshire between 1299 and 1314. According to the younger Henry's memoirs, he was better at martial arts than {{academic}} subjects and did not learn to read until later in life. <b>Henry</b> <b>was</b> coeval with Edward III and was pivotal to his reign, becoming his best friend and most trusted commander. <b>Henry</b> <b>was</b> knighted in 1330, represented his father in parliament and fought in Edward's Scottish campaign. After {{the outbreak of the}} Hundred Years' War, Henry took part in several diplomatic missions and minor campaigns and was present at the great English victory in the naval Battle of Sluys in 1340. Later, he was required to commit himself as hostage in the Low Countries for Edward’s considerable debts. He remained hostage for a year and had to pay a large ransom for his own release.|$|E

At Pentecost 1134, son Geoffrey was born in Rouen, but the {{childbirth}} was extremely difficult and Matilda appeared close to death. She made arrangements for her will and argued with her father about where she should be buried. Matilda preferred Bec Abbey, but Henry wanted her to be interred at Rouen Cathedral. Matilda recovered, and <b>Henry</b> <b>was</b> overjoyed by the birth of his second grandson, possibly insisting on another round of oaths from his nobility.|$|E
