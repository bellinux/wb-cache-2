500|$|Although Europeans knew Priestley best as a {{scientist}} (he had discovered oxygen gas in 1774), Americans knew him best as a defender of religious freedom and as an advocate for American independence. Immediately upon his arrival, he was [...] by various political factions vying to gain his support. Priestley declined their entreaties, however, hoping to avoid the political discord that had embroiled him in Britain. He wrote to John Adams that he [...] "made it a rule to take no part whatever {{in the politics of}} a country in which I am a stranger, and in which <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>wish</b> to live undisturbed". (Priestley never became a citizen of the United States.) He also turned down an opportunity to teach chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania at this time.|$|E
500|$|John Metcalf for The Spectator {{thought the}} book [...] "utterly disgraceful—and highly enjoyable... without [...] no {{forthcoming}} railway journey should be undertaken", although he also considered {{that it was}} [...] "not one of Mr. Fleming's best". Anthony Boucher, writing in The New York Times, was equivocal, saying [...] "I don't know anyone who writes about gambling more vividly than Fleming and <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>wish</b> {{the other parts of}} his books lived up to their gambling sequences". Richard Lister in the New Statesman thought that [...] "Mr. Fleming is splendid; he stops at nothing." [...] Writing for The Washington Post, Al Manola believed that the [...] "British tradition of rich mystery writing, copious description and sturdy heroism all blend nicely" [...] in Moonraker, providing what he considered was [...] "probably the best action novel of the month".|$|E
500|$|Observers {{described}} the Reagans' relationship as close, authentic and intimate. During his presidency they {{were reported to}} frequently display their affection for one another; one press secretary said, [...] "They never took each other for granted. They never stopped courting." [...] He often called her [...] "Mommy" [...] and she called him [...] "Ronnie." [...] He once wrote to her, [...] "Whatever I treasure and enjoy... all would be without meaning if I didn't have you." [...] When {{he was in the}} hospital in 1981 after an assassination attempt, she slept with one of his shirts to be comforted by his scent. In a letter to the American people in 1994, Reagan wrote [...] "I have recently been told that I am one of the millions of Americans who will be afflicted with Alzheimer's disease... <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>wish</b> there was some way I could spare Nancy from this painful experience," [...] and in 1998, while he was stricken by Alzheimer's, Nancy told Vanity Fair, [...] "Our relationship is very special. We were very much in love and still are. When I say my life began with Ronnie, well, it's true. It did. I can't imagine life without him." [...] Nancy Reagan died on March 6, 2016 at the age of 94.|$|E

6000|$|... "One moment," [...] I interrupted. [...] "I am {{sure there}} is some mistake. <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>wished</b> to present certain papers and get a safe conduct from the General {{to go and see}} Villa." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm glad I {{live in it}} then. I don't like my work, but I get a {{good deal}} of {{satisfaction}} out of it after all, so I won't complain. <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>wished</b> <b>I</b> liked teaching as you do." ...|$|R
2500|$|Johnson was {{strongly}} pro-life. [...] In 2000, he sponsored legislation allowing mothers {{to leave a}} newborn baby at a hospital, police station, and like public facilities without fear of criminal charges. [...] "I believe this bill is pro-life because it protects {{the life of a}} child regardless of the actions of its parents. [...] <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>wish</b> we could protect babies earlier," [...] he told The Plain Dealer.|$|E
2500|$|On 4 September 2007, a Small Faces and Don Arden {{commemorative}} plaque, {{issued by}} the London Borough of Westminster, was unveiled in their memory in Carnaby Street. An emotional Kenney Jones attended the ceremony {{and said in a}} BBC television interview, [...] "To honour the Small Faces after all these years is a terrific achievement. <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>wish</b> that Steve Marriott, Ronnie Lane and the late Don Arden were here to enjoy this moment with me".|$|E
2500|$|Zinnemann responded, [...] "I admire Hawks very much. <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>wish</b> he'd {{leave my}} films alone!" [...] In a 1973 interview, he added, [...] "I'm rather {{surprised}} at [...] thinking. Sheriffs are people and no {{two people are}} alike. The story of High Noon {{takes place in the}} Old West but it is really a story about a man's conflict of conscience. In this sense it is a cousin to A Man for All Seasons. In any event, respect for the Western hero has not been diminished by High Noon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Hmph! Half Hind {{seems that}} way disposed. <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>wished</b> {{to see that}} the boy had come to no harm and was a free agent. As thou knowest, he and I were old friends in the first days of your pilgrimage together.' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{hastened to}} assure her that I would {{not ask for}} the {{particulars}} of the conversation. <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>wished</b> to know the general effect of the message upon her. That was legitimate enough, as, in fact, she received the message through me.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{answered}} Vane decidedly. [...] "In fact, I {{must ask}} {{you not to}} do anything of the kind. <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>wished</b> to make sure of your good will, and now that I'm satisfied on that point, I'd rather wait and speak--when it seems judicious." ...|$|R
2500|$|Using {{profits from}} her touring, record releases, and awards {{given to her}} for her own {{contributions}} to the folk arts, Cotten was able to move with her daughter and grandchildren from Washington, D.C., and buy a house in Syracuse, New York. She was also able to continue touring and releasing records well into her 80s. In 1984, she won the Grammy Award for Best Ethnic or Traditional Recording, for the album Elizabeth Cotten Live, released by Arhoolie Records. When accepting the award in Los Angeles, her comment was, [...] "Thank you. <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>wish</b> I had my guitar so I could play a song for you all." [...] In 1989, Cotten was one of 75 influential African-American women included in the photo documentary I Dream a World.|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{told you}} that I had lost my innocence and my blind faith in the eternity of love. And that's a pity—truly a pity, because I want to believe in it with my whole being. If I'm skeptical, it's not about now, but about the distant future. We are {{separated}} for too long at a {{time for us to}} be bound together forever. There's something hopeless and very sad about this feeling. You asked me about a child, and I said what I did because I'm not thinking that far ahead—because a child is the most wonderful creation and the final bond {{between a man and a}} woman (at least, that's how I see it, or let's say, that's how it should be and how I'd want it to be). And I'm not thinking that far ahead because I'm not convinced it's eternal. <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>wish</b> I could free myself of this doubt." ...|$|E
60|$|VIVIE. No: {{it was not}} that. I didn't believe him. <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>wish</b> I could.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am sorry," [...] the Ashanti general said, {{with an air}} of real concern. [...] "I did {{not think}} of your being in danger, <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>wished</b> you to have a good sight of the battle; next time I will put you in a safer place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know no ill of you, Mrs. Maclure, and I mean no ill by you; <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>wished</b> to {{show you}} that I know so much of this person's affairs that I might be safely intrusted with the rest. Proceed, if you please, in your narrative." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't say I knew it. <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>wished</b> to know it. Now I am satisfied. I met {{another friend}} of yours on Sunday." [...] She paused for him to ask who; {{but he did not}} ask. [...] "I see you are dying to know what friend: Mr. Bushwick." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "R-r-r, you brute-beast and blackguard! Cowardly scamp! [...] <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>wish</b> I dared {{burn down}} the house [...] And spoil your sniggering!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{will come}}' she said, impatiently, 'I {{will come and}} sit with you after breakfast, Violet; <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>wish</b> I had been called.' ...|$|E

60|$|In {{spite of}} his oaths and struggles, the inebriated mariner was firmly bound, hand and foot, {{and placed in the}} centre of the assembly. <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>wished</b> that the natives had also gagged him, for his language, though, of course, unintelligible to them, was profane, and highly painful to me.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was a pure accident," [...] Roger asserted. [...] "I might shoot twenty arrows, and not hit {{the tree}} again. I {{had not the}} least idea that I should do so. <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>wished</b> {{to show you how}} far a well-made bow would send an arrow, when drawn by an Englishman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes. He {{told me that}} he {{had engaged}} as many curates as he has means for. I {{answered}} that my stipend need be no consideration, for <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>wished</b> to spend on the parish, but he was not satisfied. Many incumbents don't like to have curates of independent means; I believe it has an amateur appearance.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Tush, {{the thing}} to pardon would be having {{accepted}} one. <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>wish</b> they would leave us in peace! What was it this time?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And by nothing else. A half-hour's walk round would {{convince}} you, sir; <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>wish</b> {{that you}} could persuade his lordship to accompany you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can assure}} you, Mr. Mason, that I do sympathise with you most sincerely. <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>wish</b> my sympathy {{could be of}} more value." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{afraid that}} of the many who would run after you I should be the least lucky," [...] he said, with an attempt to laugh that did not, however, conceal his mortification; [...] "but I assure you that <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>wished</b> to have an {{interview}} with your father,--a BUSINESS interview, perhaps as much in his interest as my own." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "D--n!" [...] muttered the man; and, turning {{aside from}} her, he uncocked the pistol, and {{replaced}} it in his pocket--"I am a villain," [...] he said, [...] "steeped in guilt and wretchedness, but not wicked enough to do you any harm! <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>wished</b> to terrify you into my measures--She hears me not--she is gone!--Great God! what a wretch am I become!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I had {{no desire}} to detain you. <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>wished</b> to say that when you see Gen. Washington I know you will be just enough to tell him that Major Van Zandt knew nothing of your wrongs, or even your {{presence}} here, until you presented them, and that since then he has treated you as became an officer and a gentleman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've no wish {{to argue}} with you at all. <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>wish</b> to leave you alone. I'm simply greatly {{interested}} in your own sentiments." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Some {{sacrifice}} {{there must}} be. Give me time--give me time, I'll manage it. <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>wish</b> they hadn't seen you {{there in the}} Bois." ...|$|E
6000|$|But Clementina urged unsuspiciously: [...] "Oh, yes, indeed! And I shall {{feel better}} if you take it. <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>wish</b> I could go home, too!" ...|$|E
60|$|Tim. Why, madam, <b>I</b> could <b>only</b> <b>wish</b> we were {{a little}} better acquainted, that we might not laugh at one another so.|$|R
6000|$|... "At any rate," [...] {{declared}} Honora, {{trying to}} control her voice, [...] "I've decided, now I've seen it a second time, that I don't want it. <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>wished</b> him to look at it," [...] she added, scornfully aware that she was taking up the cudgels in his behalf. But she could not bring herself, in Brent's presence, to declare that the argument of the rent seemed decisive.|$|R
60|$|There {{were only}} two {{solutions}} to the problem--namely, that the whole occurrence was hallucination, or that, in fact, Ragnall and Savage had seen something unnatural and uncanny. If the latter were correct <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>wished</b> that <b>I</b> had shared the experience, as I have always longed to see a ghost. A real, indisputable ghost {{would be a great}} support to our doubting minds, that is if we knew its owner to be dead.|$|R
