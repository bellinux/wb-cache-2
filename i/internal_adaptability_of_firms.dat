40|$|Stock {{markets have}} been rapidly {{developed}} {{around the world}} during the last 20 years. Accordingly, there is sincere academic interest in understanding the determinants of this phenomenon. Most studies advocate {{that the development of}} a stock market is influenced by a few individual country variables such as the origin of its legal system, enforcement of law, accounting patterns, transparency, corporate ownership structure, and the level of creditor and minority investor protection. This paper extends previous empirical literature concerning the determinants of stock market development. We built a unique sample of 50 countries, ranging from those with emerging to developed economies. From a set of 60 potential variables, 12 factors were employed using multiple regression. The research breaks new ground by using different constructs taken from financial literature, such as the Human Development Index (HDI, 2010), Managerial Skills of Entrepreneurs and Democracy of the Country. Results showed that more factors may influence the development of stock markets, such as the <b>adaptability</b> <b>of</b> <b>firms</b> and the openness of a country, helping avoid the multicollinearity effects that may have affected earlier studies...|$|R

This article provides a historical overview of the implementation of 'Paris' in Uganda from the late 1990 s up to 2010, showing that implementation is laggardly and, in more recent years, that earlier progress has been reversed. This is due to donors' perceptions of Uganda's political structure, and particularly its rampant corruption, and also to different views among donors and their <b>internal</b> <b>adaptability</b> in terms <b>of</b> truly measuring up to the Paris Principles...|$|R
40|$|Radical product {{innovation}} capability {{as a type}} of dynamic capability has received much attention in recent time. This area of strategy has generated growing number of research on how it can be developed and kept sustainable. However past research fall short of extended the knowledge to capture the use adaptive capabilities that are interrelated. This dissertation presents a historical research for the literature on radical {{product innovation}} capability. It illustrates how the sustainability <b>of</b> a <b>firm’s</b> radical product innovation can be improved by extending this capability to include adaptive capabilities that function as a web. This adaptive capability is made up of components embedded in the radical product innovation capability such as: firm characteristics, senior leadership, organizational culture, product launch strategy and product performance. So far, research has focused on singular interactions between these factors. Conversely the question of how the interplay of these factors affects the <b>adaptability</b> <b>of</b> a <b>firm’s</b> radical product innovation capability previously remained unexplored. The research concludes by showing how the interplay among these components improves the fit <b>of</b> a <b>firm’s</b> radical product innovation capability to fast changing product market...|$|R
40|$|Manufacturing is a {{vital and}} {{significant}} element of the British economy. The sector has made a transition towards the production of higher value-added products and services to remain competitive in increasingly international markets. A highly skilled and competitive supply base {{is central to the}} viability of the sector as tasks once undertaken by end-manufacturers are increasingly being absorbed into the portfolio of functions undertaken by the supplier. This thesis examines how one supply industry, intermediate metal processing (IMP), is adjusting to international competition in the context of increasingly complex dependencies in the supply chain. An intensive study of IMP manufacturers in the West Midlands (UK) was undertaken through qualitative interviews and desk based research to understand the current challenges and opportunities the industry faced. The analysis is focused on the transition to higher value manufacturing and the complexity of buyer-supplier relationships. This is developed through a case study analysis of the industry’s adjustment to rising industrial energy costs and a detailed examination of customer agreement structures in shaping transactional governance structures. The research makes a contribution to current conceptions of the spatial organisation of production and the nature of production relationships. Mature industries, such as metal component manufacture, are successfully undertaking complex and varied forms of adaptation to remain competitive. Despite transitions to value-added products, costs continue to be an important element to both competitiveness and viability. Production relationships, and specifically the nature of the inter-firm agreement, are a significant aspect of adjustment and the capacity to capture value through governance mechanisms. Contracts are a relatively under represented factor of inter-firm relationships but are found to be central to the <b>adaptability</b> <b>of</b> <b>firms,</b> the attainment <b>of</b> value and stability of the business. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} good governance, as {{the manifestation of}} a larger {{ideology}} of shareholder value maximization, is designed for and promoted by large, manager-controlled listed corporations. The increasing adoption and growing legitimacy of good governance {{have led to the}} formation of a dominant institutional logic, which family firms experience pressure to adopt. Particularly strong is the pressure to increase the independence of the board of directors. While the process of change towards more independent boards may not necessarily contribute to increased economic efficiency or be fully able to fulfill the governance needs <b>of</b> family <b>firms,</b> these firms continue to adopt such practices. Drawing on institutional theory, we propose that institutional pressure is the dominant reason for family firms to adopt board independence. We then deduce potential consequences of this change, including positive consequences in terms of creation of both social and economic value, as well as negative consequences in terms of dilution of board meetings, demotivation of managers and decreased collaboration in the boardroom. Our study suggests that the benefits associated with the adoption of good governance can become offset by a decrease in the strategic <b>adaptability</b> <b>of</b> a <b>firm...</b>|$|R
40|$|Modern firms assume {{strategic}} both {{in thinking}} and in action {{to the extent}} that they manage change to their own advantage. The market evolutionary trends, especially non-incremental ones that relate to new primary demand, new technology, channel changes, market redefinition and new government policies dealt with in this article often question the <b>adaptability</b> <b>of</b> incumbent <b>firms,</b> transform the mode of competition, and usher in new entrants, who may wish to take advantage of the incumbents’ leapfrogs. This article suggests that investment decisions be timed to reflect the moment when the match between a firm’s capabilities and the key market requirements is at optimum or when the strategic window is open. Market withdrawals are often contemplated when the market no longer proves profitable for a firm or when the window is shut behind a firm. Strategic market planners follow the trends of market evolution and proactively assess their firm’s capabilities for the purpose of making timely decisions on either, and when, to throw in the towel or to beef up the organization to adapt to such changes...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the recent stream of literature on NK Model’s applications {{to the field of}} technological evolution. It is argued that while the model has a great explanatory potential in economics proper, its behavioral foundations are still maladapted for treatment of purportive decision-making strategies for technological innovation. Concentrating on the decision rule for accepting novelties, we first analyze the consequences of intentional and unintentional imprecision in following hill-climbing strategy, highlighting the interplay between rigidity and deliberate experimentation. Building on Simon’s insights on satisficing behavior and designing without final goals we build a simulative model that provides a possibility to compare strategies differing in the desired level of imprecision. Secondly, we shift our attention to the question of organizational memory, analyzing in a simulation setting a fully memory dependent and a fully memory independent innovation-related strategies. The results confirm that from the one hand up to a certain level “imperfection ” of rule-following behavior is a virtue rather than a threat, while from the other, that past successes can preclude <b>adaptability</b> <b>of</b> the <b>firm,</b> while disregarding such successes can be very risky...|$|R

40|$|Professional Doctorate - Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyse the effects of CEO compensation on financial performance and how that relationship may be moderated by strategy. The turbulent period during and surrounding the Global Financial Crisis (2006 - 2012) provides an opportunity to assess how well firms adapt to changes in the global markets due to the Global Financial Crisis' extreme economic volatility and instability. As such, this study uses the Global Financial Crisis to enable the inclusion of a turbulent economic period as opposed to one which is more stable to assess the <b>adaptability</b> <b>of</b> <b>firms.</b> Market measures and accounting measures are used as a gauge for financial performance. The study uses agency theory as the basis for describing the relationship between the CEO and the shareholders. It examines the relationship between CEO compensation and financial performance, and the relationship between strategy and financial performance. The study finally examines corporate strategy (as monitoring and adaptability) and its relationship with financial performance, and whether or not corporate strategy moderates the relationship of CEO compensation and financial performance. The results of the study find that CEO compensation has a significant and positive relationship with EPS and that the BONUS variable of CEO compensation has a significant and positive relationship with TobinQ. The study also finds that the strategy hypothesis does not appear to be supported at 5 %. It is also found that ADAPT has a weak positive moderation on the relationship between CEOSAL and EPS at p< 0. 1, which suggests that ADAPT is a weak moderator on the relationship between CEO compensation and EPS. The study’s implication on practice allows directors and management to better assess performance measures and develop and deliver strategies to deal with the highs and lows reflected in economic situations such as was seen in the lead up to, during and following the Global Financial Crisis. Its implication on agency theory sheds light on the typical and topical problems with the principal-agent relationship, being that an off shoot of the Global Financial Crisis has seen shareholders and the public both sceptical and infuriated and insisting on a review of CEO compensation packages and that the selection of the CEO and level of remuneration is in itself a strategic decision...|$|R

This paper focus on the evaluation of manufacturing industry capacity, {{in terms of their}} main structural change, to cope with the competitive pressures within an enlarged market. We tried to understand the role of investment decisions on the <b>adaptability</b> process <b>of</b> manufacturing <b>firms.</b> It's not our intention to evaluate the impact of structural change on competitiveness and on productivity level, but only to understand if the nature and dimension of change, could be the starting point and a possible path of overwhelm the main competitive problems. By using WIFO taxonomies applied to the manufacturing industry, we found that Portugal (i) displays a small share in technology-driven industries (R&D intensive), while the major shares go to labour-intensive and marketing-driven industries, and (ii) still has a reduced share in high-skill and a high share in low-skill labour manufacturing. This reveals a specialisation in labour intensive and low-skill manufacturing that could affect the competitive process within an enlarged market.

The recognised importance <b>of</b> <b>adaptability</b> makes its evaluation an essential task.

40|$|This thesis explores {{resource}} acquisition {{in science}} and technology-based entrepreneurial firms. Success and failure <b>of</b> these <b>firms</b> {{have been found to}} be intimately related to their resources, and conversely the lack thereof, as well as to the relations by which access to external resources is granted. Two areas of relevance to resource acquisition are of particular concern to this thesis: the role of personal relations and board ties. The thesis includes four appended studies, each dealing with aspects of the areas of interest. Study I and II apply a case-methodology to investigate the role of personal relations for resource acquisition in Swedish university spin-offs and corporate spin-offs respectively. Study III is a theoretical paper that, building on theory and the findings in study I and II, seeks to address the role of personal relations in NTBFs more generally. Study IV, finally, builds on a large sample <b>of</b> <b>firms</b> started in the Swedish ICT-sector between 1997 and 2003, and investigates the role of boards and direct board ties for resource acquisition in these <b>firms.</b> The findings <b>of</b> these studies support indications in the previous literature that personal relations are very important for NTBFs in their struggle to attract resources in the early phases. The findings also contribute to the literature by pointing to the variety of uses of these relations by themselves and as a generative mechanism for other means of resource acquisition. As such the findings also suggest potentially long lasting effects of these personal relations on, for example, network development, the efficiency <b>of</b> the <b>firms</b> operations, the <b>adaptability</b> <b>of</b> these <b>firms,</b> and hence also on the growth <b>of</b> these <b>firms.</b> It is argued that the benefits and constraints of personal relations are particularly important in new technology-based firms where high uncertainties, and possibly unavailable product and factor markets, may deprive these <b>firms</b> <b>of</b> the option to form alliances for long periods of time. Finally, the findings of this thesis also contribute to the literature on boards and interlocking directories by assessing the hitherto largely unattended role of such ties in new firms. The results indicate that boards and board ties to firms are important for the growth of NTBFs, and it is argued that appointing appropriate board members may be important both as means to access knowledge directly, as well as to communicate with and access resources from firms within the same industry. From the point of view of theory, the results call for more research on personal relations to better understand the growth and failure <b>of</b> entrepreneurial <b>firms,</b> and in particular NTBFs. From a policy perspective it is important to note that much knowledge transfer occurs on individual rather than on organizational levels. The effectiveness of current, centralized mechanisms could thus be increased if they were to be restructured according to a regime that is based on coordination and facilitation of relations among actors. Finally, for NTBFs, the cost to build and maintain relations to acquire resources, especially research, must be contrasted with the risks of becoming too dependent on any one relation. Also, while NTBFs may need to bootstrap activities, it is important to bootstrap the right activities and not to cut on, for example, investments in good and skilled people...|$|R

However, {{the influence of}} leadership behaviour on the <b>adaptability</b> <b>of</b> team members {{has not been a}} subject for research yet. Therefore, this research paper has focused on this specific relation between perceived leadership behaviour and the individual <b>adaptability</b> <b>of</b> team members. The research has been conducted on 278 members from 46 different teams of the Royal Netherlands Army. This research supports the claim that there is a significant relation between perceived leadership behaviour and individual <b>adaptability</b> <b>of</b> team members and more specific pin-points one dimension of leadership behaviour which significantly positively correlates with the individual <b>adaptability</b> <b>of</b> team members. This behavioural dimension of The Leadership Challenge is defined as “enabling others to act” (Posner & Kouzes, 1988). Behavioural aspects that belong to this dimension are: •	Foster collaboration by building trust and facilitating relationships: o	Setting goals that demand collaboration o	Support constant interaction o	Look for integrated solutions o	Invest in a relationship built on trust •	Strengthen others by increasing self-determination and developing competence: o	Enable others to lead themselves o	Let people be in control of themselves o	Give people a great deal of freedom and choice in deciding how to do their job o	Ensure that people grow in their jobs by learning new skills and by developing themselves o	Challenge people o	Support the decisions that people make on their own The scientific relevance of this research is that {{it can be used to}} point out more specifically which behavioural aspect of a team leader will influence the <b>adaptability</b> <b>of</b> team members. This was already known for perceived leadership style, but now also for perceived leadership behaviour. The practical relevance of this research is that it offers organizations insight into which leadership behaviour will enhance the <b>adaptability</b> <b>of</b> its team member.
