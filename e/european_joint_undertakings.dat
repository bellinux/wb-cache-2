40|$|Many if {{not most}} markets with network {{externalities}} are two-sided. To succeed, platforms in industries such as software, portals and media, payment systems and the Internet, must "get {{both sides of the}} market on board ". Accordingly, platforms devote much attention to their business model, that is to how they court each side while making money overall. The paper builds a model of platform competition with two-sided markets. It unveils the determinants of price allocation and enduser surplus for different governance structures (profit-maximizing platforms and not-for-profit <b>joint</b> <b>undertakings),</b> and compares the outcomes with those under an integrated monopolist and a Ramsey planner. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{combined}} GALILEO/GPS/EGNOS user receiver {{represents a}} key {{technology for the}} upcoming European satellite navigation system GALILEO. The receiver is the main physical interface between the system and the user. It transforms the GALILEO signal-in-space into services for the citizens. Within the project GAMMA a consortium of nine industrial and research partners, lead by Fraunhofer IIS, located in Nuremberg, Germany, develop an assisted GALILEO/GPS/EGNOS receiver prototype and perform research {{on the development of}} a Multichannel GALILEO/GPS/EGNOS Signal Generator for the design and evaluation of the receiver. For the assistance data link an UMTS communications link will be emulated. The GNSS Signal Generator will be responsible for GPS/GALILEO signal generation and the correction and acquisition aiding data provision. Further work encompasses studies of indoor navigation capabilities, reconfigurable and hence reusable digital hardware components, assisted acquisition co ncepts and finally low cost optimizations. The GAMMA receiver will fulfill both main requirements of the second call of GALILEO <b>JOINT</b> <b>UNDERTAKING</b> to elaborate core technologies and to implement a low cost/low power receiver solution for mass market applications. Low cost and a high degree of integration is mainly dependent on the design of the RF-front-end. The project was started in Nov. 2005 and will run for 2 years until Oct. 2007. The initial work was focused on application scenarios, specification and system design. Now the receiver front-end and baseband solutions will be developed, complemented by the research on the development of a GNSS Signal Generator and an emulated assistance data link for a complete end-to-end demonstration. The project is funded under a contract of the GALILEO <b>JOINT</b> <b>UNDERTAKING.</b> The paper presents the main system and receiver specifications, the selected architecture concept and first simulation results of the envisaged component developments of the low cost GALILEO/...|$|R

30|$|In the West, {{citizens}} became sociable in <b>joint</b> <b>undertakings.</b> In the Age of Enlightenment after 1700, {{associations and}} fellowships of citizens emerged all over Europe, who devoted themselves patriotically and economically to local interests in a sphere below {{of their political}} domination. These societies built up a network of relationships {{in addition to the}} business relationships of their members. Their social activity supplemented their economic activity. It is remarkable that the word “social” came into use not before the publication of Rousseau’s “Contrat social” in 1762. The Encyclopédie of the French Enlightenment recorded the word “social” in 1765 as “a word recently introduced in language to designate the qualities that make man useful in society or fitting for the commerce of men”. The Oikos of citizens was dissolving into the space of their outer activities, releasing, on the one hand, economic action into the market exchange and, on the other hand, tasks of care and supply into the public space, which the citizens filled with their societies.|$|R
