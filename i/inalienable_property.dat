25|$|In his poems, Solon portrays Athens {{as being}} under {{threat from the}} {{unrestrained}} greed and arrogance of its citizens. Even the earth (Gaia), the mighty mother of the gods, had been enslaved. The visible symbol of this perversion of the natural and social order was a boundary marker called a horos, a wooden or stone pillar indicating that a farmer was in debt or under contractual obligation to someone else, either a noble patron or a creditor. Up until Solon's time, land was the <b>inalienable</b> <b>property</b> of a family or clan and {{it could not be}} sold or mortgaged. This was no disadvantage to a clan with large landholdings since it could always rent out farms in a sharecropping system. A family struggling on a small farm however could not use the farm as security for a loan even if it owned the farm. Instead the farmer would have to offer himself and his family as security, providing some form of slave labour in lieu of repayment. Equally, a family might voluntarily pledge part of its farm income or labour to a powerful clan in return for its protection. Farmers subject to these sorts of arrangements were loosely known as hektemoroi indicating that they either paid or kept a sixth of a farm's annual yield. In the event of 'bankruptcy', or failure to honour the contract stipulated by the horoi, farmers and their families could in fact be sold into slavery.|$|E
25|$|Al-Husseini's {{vigorous}} {{efforts to}} transform the Haram into a symbol of pan-Arabic and Palestinian nationalism were intended to rally Arab support against the postwar influx of Jewish immigrants. In his campaigning, al-Husseini often accused Jews of planning to take possession of the Western Wall of Jerusalem, which belonged to the waqf of Abu Madyan as an <b>inalienable</b> <b>property,</b> and rebuild the Temple over the Al-Aqsa Mosque. He took certain statements, for example, by the Ashkenazi chief rabbi of Palestine, Abraham Isaac Kook regarding the eventual return in time of the Temple Mount back to Jewish hands, and turned them to a concrete political plot to seize control of the area. Al-Husseini's intensive work to refurbish the shrine as a cynosure for the Muslim world, and Jewish endeavours to improve their access to, and establish a ritually appropriate ambiance on the plaza by the Western Wall, led to increased conflict between the two communities, each seeing the site only from their own traditional perspective and interests. Zionist narratives pinpointed al-Husseini's works on, and publicity about, the site and threats to it, as attempts to restore his own family's waning prestige. Arab narratives read the heightened agitation of certain Jewish groups over the Wall {{as an attempt to}} revive diaspora interest in Zionism after some years of relative decline, depression and emigration. Each attempt to make minor alterations to the status quo, still governed by Ottoman law, was bitterly protested before the British authorities by the Muslim authorities. If Muslims could cite an Ottoman regulation of 1912 specifically forbidding objects like seating to be introduced, the Jews could cite testimonies to the fact that before 1914 certain exceptions had been made to improve their access and use of the Wall. The decade witnessed several such episodes of strong friction, and the simmering tensions came to a head in late 1928, only to erupt, after a brief respite, into an explosion of violence a year later.|$|E

60|$|But Mammon overreached {{himself when}} he tried to impose his {{doctrine}} of <b>inalienable</b> <b>property</b> on the Church under the guise of indissoluble marriage. For the Church tried to shelter this inhuman doctrine and flat contradiction of the gospel by claiming, and rightly claiming, that marriage is a sacrament. So it is; but that is exactly what makes divorce a duty when the marriage has lost the inward and spiritual grace of which the marriage ceremony is the outward and visible sign. In vain do bishops stoop to pick up the discarded arguments of the atheists of fifty years ago by pleading that the words of Jesus were in an obscure Aramaic dialect, and were probably misunderstood, as Jesus, they think, could not have said anything a bishop would disapprove of. Unless they are prepared to add that the statement that those who take the sacrament with their lips but not with their hearts eat and drink their own damnation is also a mistranslation from the Aramaic, they are most solemnly bound to shield marriage from profanation, not merely by permitting divorce, but by making it compulsory in certain cases as the Chinese do.|$|E

40|$|Maritime {{location}} of Canada {{has not been}} questioned by many generations of researchers. However, {{a quick look at}} the map or the coastline measurements do not always allow to identify the real sources of its <b>inalienable</b> <b>properties.</b> Canada ranks first in coastline in the world and is formally "the most maritime country of the planet". At the same time traditional approach of estimation of maritime location used separately would not allow judging the extent of so-called maritimeness of Canada, and the combined use of different approaches could lead to discrepant results. In our study we have used a method proposed by L. Bezrukov, which yields to estimate continental location in transport-geographic terms. This method enables us to give the integral assessment of maritime {{location of}} Canada based on population distribution and the impact of inland waterways suitable for sea transport. The estimate proves that there is in Canada an interesting mix of giant inland spaces and vast seaside regions, which in combination with the natural geographic and socio-economic factors leads to a 'multidimensional' maritime position and curious territorial organization of economy and population distribution. The estimate proves that Canada is a country with low continental degree. However, maritimeness of modern Canada is defined not by coastline length or interocean position but by ample development of hand-made inner water ways, which lowered continentality of Canadian eucumene by having increased transport, economic and geographical access to the sea. Comparison of transport-economic and transport-geographic remoteness from the sea confirm the constant influence of these unique seaways. This suggestes the conclusion that Canadians themselves have made their country maritime. Paradoxical conclusion was that in different parts of Canada maritime influence is not always defined by distance to the sea. For Canada, there is another unexpected pattern: the further north is, the higher the degree of transport-geographic continentality. Population and economy, originally developed in these transport and geographical conditions, are mainly located in coastal and maritime areas in their new, non-traditional interpretation. Ultracontinental territories compensate unfavorable interior and landlocked location, using the continental neighbourhood. Overall, Canada demonstrates a successful realization of its maritime potential. It was prouved by estimation of adducted transportation share of economy that confirmed considerable de facto cost reduction of transport work owing to sea transport use...|$|R
5000|$|The {{population}} of the tribe numbers around 2,000, most of whom live on the Reserva Boruca or the neighboring indigenous reserve of Reserva Rey Curre. The Reserva Boruca-Terraba {{was among the first}} indigenous reserves established in Costa Rica in 1956. The lands currently on the reservations were named baldíos (common lands) by the General Law of Common Lands, passed by the national government in 1939, making them the <b>inalienable</b> and exclusive <b>property</b> of the indigenous people. The subsequent law of the Institute of Lands and Colonization (ITCO), passed in 1961, transferred the baldíos to state ownership. Law No. 7316, the Indigenous Law of Costa Rica, passed in 1977, laid out the fundamental rights of the indigenous peoples.

60|$|The houses {{built by}} our {{ancestors}} were better ventilated in certain respects than modern ones, {{with all their}} improvements. The great central chimney, with its open fireplaces in the different rooms, created a constant current which carried off foul and vitiated air. In these days, how common is it to provide rooms with only a flue for a stove! This flue is kept shut in summer, and in winter opened only to admit a close stove, which burns away the vital portion of the air quite {{as fast as the}} occupants breathe it away. The sealing up of fireplaces and introduction of air-tight stoves may, doubtless, be a saving of fuel; it saves, too, more than that,--in thousands and thousands of cases it has saved people from all further human wants, and put an end forever to any needs short of the six feet of narrow earth which are man's only <b>inalienable</b> <b>property.</b> In other words, since the invention of air-tight stoves, thousands have died of slow poison. It is a terrible thing to reflect upon, that our Northern winters last from November to May, six long months, in which many families confine themselves to one room, of which every window-crack has been carefully calked to make it air-tight, where an air-tight stove keeps the atmosphere at a temperature between eighty and ninety, and the inmates sitting there, with all their winter clothes on, become enervated both by the heat and by the poisoned air, {{for which there is no}} escape but the occasional opening of a door.|$|E
6000|$|It {{being her}} first day of {{complete}} estrangement from rural objects, Phoebe found an unexpected charm in this little nook of grass, and foliage, and aristocratic flowers, and plebeian vegetables. The eye of Heaven seemed to look down into it pleasantly, and with a peculiar smile, as if glad to perceive that nature, elsewhere overwhelmed, and driven out of the dusty town, had here been able to retain a breathing-place. The spot acquired a somewhat wilder grace, and yet a very gentle one, {{from the fact that}} a pair of robins had built their nest in the pear-tree, and were making themselves exceedingly busy and happy in the dark intricacy of its boughs. Bees, too,--strange to say,--had thought it worth their while to come hither, possibly from the range of hives beside some farm-house miles away. How many aerial voyages might they have made, in quest of honey, or honey-laden, betwixt dawn and sunset! Yet, late as it now was, there still arose a pleasant hum out of {{one or two of the}} squash-blossoms, in the depths of which these bees were plying their golden labor. There was one other object in the garden which Nature might fairly claim as her <b>inalienable</b> <b>property,</b> in spite of whatever man could do to render it his own. This was a fountain, set round with a rim of old mossy stones, and paved, in its bed, with what appeared to be a sort of mosaic-work of variously colored pebbles. The play and slight agitation of the water, in its upward gush, wrought magically with these variegated pebbles, and made a continually shifting apparition of quaint figures, vanishing too suddenly to be definable. Thence, swelling over the rim of moss-grown stones, the water stole away under the fence, through what we regret to call a gutter, rather than a channel. Nor must we forget to mention a hen-coop of very reverend antiquity that stood in the farther corner of the garden, not a great way from the fountain. [...] It now contained only Chanticleer, his two wives, and a solitary chicken. All of them were pure specimens of a breed which had been transmitted down as an heirloom in the Pyncheon family, and were said, while in their prime, to have attained almost the size of turkeys, and, on the score of delicate flesh, to be fit for a prince's table. In proof of the authenticity of this legendary renown, Hepzibah could have exhibited the shell of a great egg, which an ostrich need hardly have been ashamed of. Be that as it might, the hens were now scarcely larger than pigeons, and had a queer, rusty, withered aspect, and a gouty kind of movement, and a sleepy and melancholy tone throughout all the variations of their clucking and cackling. It was evident that the race had degenerated, like many a noble race besides, in consequence of too strict a watchfulness to keep it pure. These feathered people had existed too long in their distinct variety; a fact of which the present representatives, judging by their lugubrious deportment, seemed to be aware. They kept themselves alive, unquestionably, and laid now and then an egg, and hatched a chicken; not for any pleasure of their own, but that the world might not absolutely lose what had once been so admirable a breed of fowls. The distinguishing mark of the hens was a crest of lamentably scanty growth, in these latter days, but so oddly and wickedly analogous to Hepzibah's turban, that Phoebe--to the poignant distress of her conscience, but inevitably--was led to fancy a general resemblance betwixt these forlorn bipeds and her respectable relative.|$|E

40|$|Since the 1990 s, “online education” {{has emerged}} at {{the centre of}} debates {{over the future of}} higher education. Symbolising for proponents a {{transformation}} of universities to align them with informational economies, for critics online education signifies the commodification of knowledge, commercialisation of learning, and the deskilling of instruction. Critics posit these tendencies as online education’s essence, and mount their critiques as a reaction against technology. This dissertation attempts to retain a critical position on educational reform while displacing critics’ essentialist claims. Commodification, commercialisation and deskilling are not <b>inalienable</b> technical <b>properties</b> but contingent social values informing how online education takes shape. This means that if online education supports commodification, commercialisation and deskilling, this is the result of its development within social contexts in which such values “win out” over competing educational values. It also means that these competing values could stand as a basis for alternative realisations of online education. Drawing on constructivist technology studies, Foucauldian genealogy and Andrew Feenberg’s critical theory of technology, this dissertation develops a framework for understanding the history of technology as a process of struggle between competing values. It demonstrates the validity of this conceptual and methodological turn through the analysis of historical and contemporary cases in online education – the development of computer assisted instruction for distance education in the 1970 s; experiments in educational computer conferencing in the 1980 s; and the translation of a programme of institutional reform into a logic guiding the articulation of online education in the 1990 s. Each case demonstrates that the forms of educational computing are relative to the values and interests that inform the strategic development of pedagogical practice and technological development in online education. Interventions into these value frameworks can result in an alternative form of online education. In the conclusion, I outline three areas that reflect such a transformation – blended learning, open source online education, and institutional policy developments around network technologies...|$|R

Human work is {{very different}} from the work of an animal such as a bee or a beaver in that humans are capable of conceptualizing the labor process whereas animals are not. “Thus work as purposive action, guided by the intelligence, is the special product of humankind.” He asserts that labor is a natural human function that cannot be bought or sold. “Labor, like all life processes and bodily functions, is an <b>inalienable</b> <b>property</b> of the human individual.” What may be perceived as the buying and selling of labor is in reality the buying and selling of labor power. Braverman proposes labor {{is very different}} from labor power in that labor has near infinite possibilities; whereas labor power is finite. It is the power of labor that is bought or sold for an agreed upon time or task. “Thus, in the exchange, the worker does not surrender to the capitalist his or her capacity for work.

In our environment, net debtors have the option of defaulting on unsecured debt at the cost of being subjected to wage garnishment and/or having some or all of their future assets seized by creditors. One advantage of our framework is that it encompasses two standard versions of the life-cycle model: one with perfect capital markets and one with a non-negative net-worth restriction. We study the impact of a payroll financed social security system to illustrate the role of endogenous debt constraints and compare our results to a model with exogenous debt constraints. Whereas the aggregate effects are similar under both types of constraints, the distributional consequences are found to be significantly different across debt regimes.

Moreover, the few extant studies with a local comparative bias have shown how the function of one particular textile may vary between people living in different villages or belonging to different social groups. Geirnaert has pointed out that, obviously, this indicates that textiles may form part of a wider geographical or symbolical system (Geirnaert 1992 :xxviii). It {{has also been shown}} that this type of comparative effort can be taken beyond the archipelago (see Gittinger 1992; Maxwell 1990). As yet, a concerted attempt at comparison of the meanings of ritual cloth among different ethnic groups within Indonesia has not been undertaken. Therefore, our panel will compare the manner in which one type of highly valued, locally-made ceremonial cloth functions among three ethnic groups in Indonesia: the Lio of central Flores, the Minangkabau of west Sumatra and villagers from Kerek, near Tuban on the northeast coast of Java. The comparison concerns the most highly-valued type of textile and its ritual role among the highest-ranking social group {{in each of the three}} cultures: the lawo butu, the beaded sarong of the Lio, the kain sandang gobo, a heavily gold-decorated shoulder cloth of the Minangkabau and the kain kembangan, the flowered cloth of the villagers of Kerek. Certain differences in the symbolic meaning and function of the three cloth types will appear to be linked to the different forms of social organization and religious adherence of each of the three groups. Changes over time have influenced the cloths 2 ̆ 7 function.

40|$|Modern {{biomedical}} {{research into the}} genetic component of common diseases calls for broad access to existing and novel collections of samples of human biological material, aka Biobanks. Groups of donors of these samples, however, increasingly claim a property right in their samples. They perceive the recognition of a personal property right in their biological material as the best means to serve two goals: to secure ongoing control over their samples after donation and to underpin their claim for {{a share in the}} proceeds that the research on their samples may yield. Given the objective of ensuring ongoing control, this property right is claimed to be inalienable. Recognition of a personal property right in ones biological material is problematic, especially where the requirement of inalienability seems at odds with the claim for a share of the profits. Yet, property rights in human biological material may be justified in a certain context, e. g. to enable subsets of patients to negotiate the terms and conditions of the research into their specific disorders. Biobanks, however, contain so many samples, which can be used for so many research purposes, that the unrestricted exercise of personal property rights by the sample donors will lead to a proliferation of rights. This proliferation is likely to deter or slow down both the creation of de novo Biobanks and the use of existing sample collections. Thus, recognising <b>inalienable</b> <b>property</b> rights in human biological material may lead to suboptimal use of these resources and create a classic anticommons property scenario. It would also undermine the current trend to simplify existing informed consent requirements which aims to facilitate broad and previously unanticipated research on de novo and existing Biobanks. In addition, the tradition of altruistic participation in research and the notion that large-scale collections of human biological material are global public goods are arguments against recognising inalienable personal property rights in human biological material, at least in the context of Biobanks. To avoid uncertainty over the issue of who owns collected human biological material, the principle that the property rights in such material vest in the entity lawfully collecting and storing the material should be implemented in legislation. This way most individuals and their offspring will benefit more than when they heed the call to stand up for their property rights in their samples...|$|E

Naglasak je na predikatnim kopulativnim rečenicama u kojima se u hrvatskom jeziku, kao i u pojedinim slavenskim jezicima, imenska skupina poslije kopule može ostvariti nominativom ili instrumentalom. Istražit će se ograničenja povezana s tom pojavom. Također će se na temelju primjera iz korpusa analizirati može li se na hrvatski jezik primijeniti pretpostavka iznesena za ruski jezik da se instrumentalom izražava privremeno svojstvo, dok nominativom trajno. Utvrdit će se osjećaju li izvorni govornici tu razliku na temelju ankete u kojoj je sudjelovalo 106 ispitanika. This paper {{analyses}} {{the structure}} of copular sentences and problematizes their division into predicational, specificational, equative and identificational sentences. Our emphasis is on predicate copular sentences in which the post-copular NP can appear in the nominative or the instrumental case in Croatian, just like in some other Slavic languages. Occurrences of the instrumental case in copular predicates are extremely rare in south Slavic languages {{and there is some}} question as to when they appear at all. This paper presents the different theories about the occurrence of the instrumental case in predicative nominals (Mrázek 1964, Bailyn and Rubin 1991). Bailyn and Rubin (1991) consider the use of the instrumental case in secondary predicate adjuncts in the Russian language to be a language innovation, while Croatian and many other Slavic languages have a pattern that is found in the Old Church Slavonic and Old Russian languages. The paper also analyses Croatian grammars, written before the 20 th century, with the goal of determining when the instrumental case first appeared with the copula. Many linguists (e. g. Jakobson 1936, Mrázek 1964, Wierzbicka 1980, Janda and Clancy 2002, Timberlake 2004, Geist 2006, Pereltsvaig 2007) consider that the copular sentences with the nominative or the instrumental case have different meanings in the Russian language: the nominative denotes a permanent, <b>inalienable</b> <b>property</b> of the subject, while the instrumental denotes a temporary property. This assumption is analysed in the Croatian language based on the examples from the relevant Croatian language corpora. We confirm the constraint, described in Croatian grammars, that the instrumental cannot appear with the copula in the present tense, but is possible in the perfect and future tenses. Cognitive grammar explains this by the application of the proximity principle: conceptual distance is related to formal distance. Therefore, the instrumental can appear with the copula in the perfect and future tenses, because there is distance between the subject and what he/she/it has been, or is going to become. Conversely, in the present tense there is no distance, and therefore the pre-copular and post-copular NPs have the same case. It is noted that nouns belonging to specific semantic groups appear in the instrumental case (profession, function, part of something, reason for something, goal, base etc.). We conclude that the instrumental case denotes temporary, acquired properties, while the nominative case denotes permanent, inalienable properties. This conclusion is drawn using examples from the relevant Croatian language corpora and {{based on the fact that}} the instrumental cannot appear with present tense and that adjectives are rarely marked with instrumental. Furthermore, these conclusions were tested by examining native speakers’ linguistic intuition. Native speakers did not recognize the semantic difference between sentences with a nominative predicate NP and an AP and instrumental. Therefore, our conclusion is that the instrumental case is related to style...|$|E
40|$|Ownership {{is one of}} the {{fundamental}} notions in the Civil Code and yet far too often writings on the subject have presented a narrow view of it. Obviously, its has a well determined genetic code since its general attributes are usus, fructus, abusus and vis attractiva, while its specific features include exclusivity, perpetuity and absolutism; still it remains a pliable concept. For on the one hand, though core prerogatives remain with the holder of the right, the attributes and features of ownership may not be so well affirmed, which immediately infers the existence of modalities of the right. Yet on the other, the core may be broken down since the object to such ownership then becomes a source of real rights, thus there is dismemberment. The flexibility of ownership resides in the numerous modifications it can undergo and which all potentially exist in ownership. Before attempting to study various hypotheses leading to the recognition of spatio-temporal ownership, it is indispensible to adopt a wide view of this notion since any other approach cannot produce satisfactory results. Among hypotheses under consideration, introducing a new modality seems the best solution. It does, however, have its drawbacks as the notion of spatio-temporal ownership runs against the grain of qualities inherent in the right of ownership. First of all, the holder of this right only exercices a limited abusus and in this respect he is not alone, for precedents exist with the holders of other means of ownership (substituted property, <b>inalienable</b> <b>property,</b> trust property). Furthermore, there would be an obstruction to the perpetual nature of such ownership. This proposal is, however, to be rejected since the spatio-temporal ownership is perpetual, although discontinuous. Once the initial obstacles are overcome, the introduction of an additional modality of ownership essentially requires the recognition of a fourth dimension in the object of ownership, namely its temporality. An abstract notion if ever there was one, temporality raises the question of the need for conceiving an owned piece of property as being a concrete and materialized thing. Nonetheless, ownership may be dematerialized for in fact, real estate property can be represented as a cube of space and not just a flat plane. The only obstacle to this new modality in ownership would be the impossibility of conceiving innominate changes to the right of ownership. In all the code, case law and authoritative writings presently recognize the capacity of the human mind to conceive additional modifications to rights of ownership. Spatio-temporal ownership depends upon the recognition of the temporal dimension of the object of such right and thereby constitutes a modality of ownership whose peculiarities derive from the individual form of its object. Although recognition of modality in ownership seems to be the only way for arriving at spatio-temporal ownership, we may consider various solutions based upon an arrangement of existing institutions in the law relating to ownership —which would allow the constitution of a spatio-temporal right of ownership. Despite its popularity, usufruct does not seem to us to be a satisfactory answer. Joint ownership is more attractive despite the ever-present expectation of a petition to partition. A covenant between undivided coproprietors would provide, in our opinion however, a delay in such partition and this covenant would be enforceable on both parties and beneficiaries. If doubts persist as to the legality of such a covenant, the revision announced in the proposed Civil Code of Quebec will calm such fears. Besides allowing the postponement of partition for a maximum period of thirty years, this revision will make possible the assignment of a piece of property to a durable end and ipso facto a waiver of partition. One must remain {{aware of the fact that}} despite the technique used to avoid partition, the right ownership is plural. It is only by the identification of an additional modality of ownership that there may be true spatio-temporal ownership...|$|E
