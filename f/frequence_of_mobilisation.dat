The simulation {{results showed that the}} centrifugal force due to rotational speed can greatly influence the frequency of the impeller. The distribution of two cracked blades effect the natural <b>frequence</b> <b>of</b> the impeller. When two cracked blades locate in the interval position, the increasing value <b>of</b> <b>frequence</b> is maximum.
