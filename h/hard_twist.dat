50|$|Handspinners use {{the number}} of twists per inch often. Because the amount of twist defines {{a lot about a}} yarn, {{the number of}} twists per inch is an {{important}} measure to recreate a yarn. As a spinner spins, they will often stop every few minutes to check to see that the number of twists per inch is the same throughout the yarn, as well as that the number of wraps per inch (the thickness of the yarn) is the same. Measuring the number of twists per inch while spinning singles also helps the spinner create a balanced yarn when plying. Yarns that have relatively few twists per inch tend to have a softer hand but are not as strong as yarns with more twists per inch, such as medium twist or <b>hard</b> <b>twist</b> yarns. Yarns that have a very <b>hard</b> <b>twist,</b> enough so that the yarn will double back onto itself when released from tension, are called crepe-twist yarns.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} corn mill {{built on}} {{this site was}} operating in 1544. On the 2 February 1785, Richard Dilworth passed the corn mill to Richard Salisbury of Chipping a cotton manufacturer and William Barrow a merchant of Lancaster, the new mill was functioning by July. On 15 April 1788 the site was offered for sale, and in the advertisement details of its size and equipment were given. Grove House {{was built in the}} 1790s. It was sold again in 1802, and by then it also housed a 336 spindle mule and an outbuilding suitable for 3 further mules. Mules were more suitable to spinning the softer weft, while water frames of throstles produced a <b>harder</b> <b>twist</b> more suitable for the warp or sewing cotton. An adjoined house that was described as a residence for a genteel family, a further cottage was used as an apprentice house. It is probable that alterations that lengthened the mill were made then. In 1823 Grove Row was constructed as a workhouse, it closed in 1838 and was converted into 5 cottages. One of these cottages served as a shop until 1949.In 1881 the census shows that 10 men, 7 boys and 24 women were employed in the mill.|$|R

It struck squarely in Ken's hands and bounced out and rolled far. When he recovered it the runner was on third base. Before Ken got back to his position the second batter hit hard through the infield toward right. The ball came skipping like a fiendish rabbit. Ken gritted his teeth and went down on his knees, to get the bounding ball full in his breast. But he stopped it, scrambled for it, and made the throw in. Dale likewise hit in his direction, a slow low fly, difficult to judge. Ken over-ran it, and the hit gave Dale two bases. Ken realized that the varsity was now executing Worry Arthurs' famous right-field hitting. The sudden knowledge seemed to give Ken the blind-staggers. The field was in a haze; the players blurred in his sight. He heard {{the crack of the}} ball and saw Raymond dash over and plunge down. Then the ball seemed to streak out of the grass toward him, and, as he bent over, it missed his hands and cracked on his shin. Again he fumbled wildly for it and made the throw in.

40|$|We {{detail the}} {{application}} of bounding volume hierarchies to accelerate second-virial evaluations for arbitrary complex particles interacting through hard and soft finite-range potentials. This procedure, based {{on the construction of}} neighbour lists through the combined use of recursive atom-decomposition techniques and binary overlap search schemes, is shown to scale sub-logarithmically with particle resolution in the case of molecular systems with high aspect ratios. Its implementation within an efficient numerical and theoretical framework based on classical density functional theory enables us to investigate the cholesteric self-assembly {{of a wide range of}} experimentally-relevant particle models. We illustrate the method through the determination of the cholesteric behaviour of <b>hard,</b> structurally-resolved <b>twisted</b> cuboids, and report quantitative evidence of the long-predicted phase handedness inversion with increasing particle thread angles near the phenomenological threshold value of 45 ^∘. Our results further highlight the complex relationship between microscopic structure and helical twisting power in such model systems, which may be attributed to subtle geometric variations of their chiral excluded-volume manifold...|$|R

40|$|We use {{the theory}} of leading twist {{shadowing}} to develop a method for the calculation of <b>hard</b> leading <b>twist</b> coherent diffraction in hadron-nucleus processes. We demonstrate that soft multiple rescatterings lead to the factorization breaking of hard diffraction in proton-nucleus scattering, which is larger than in hadron-nucleon scattering. At the LHC and RHIC kinematics, we compare the contribution of hard diffraction into two jets to the e. m. contribution, when the two-jet diffractive final state is produced by the coherent nuclear Coulomb field. We study the x_, β and A-dependence of {{the ratio of the}} two effects, R. We demonstrate that in proton-heavy nucleus hard coherent diffraction at the LHC, R is small, which offers a clean method to study hard photon-proton scattering at the energies exceeding the HERA energies by the factor of ten. On the other hand, the use of lighter nuclei, such as Ca- 40, will allow to study the screened nuclear diffractive parton distribution. Moreover, a comparison of the dijet diffractive production to the heavy-quark-jet diffractive production will estimate the screened nuclear diffractive gluon PDF, which will be measured in nucleus-nucleus ultraperipheral collisions at the LHC...|$|R
