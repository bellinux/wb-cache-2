Thus, there was no MRI/angiographic examination to prove the existence of a brain AVM prior to the surgical interventions. Also, the cerebral angiography performed after the surgery showed, in both patients, no signs of residual vascular malformations.

40|$|SUMMARY: We {{describe}} a rare {{case of a}} de novo cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in a 9 -year-old girl. MR imaging at 6 years of age demonstrated band heterotopia. Follow-up MR imaging 3 years later demonstrated a new 3. 5 -cm AVM in the left parietol-occipital region, confirmed by conventional angiography. This report, along with limited previous reports, suggests that AVMs can be acquired lesions and that AVM development is a dynamic process extending into the postnatal period. An arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is a vascular mal-formation characterized by arterio-venous shunt through a collection of tortuous vessels without an <b>intervening</b> capil-lary <b>bed.</b> 1 The pathogenesis of AVMs is currently unknown. Although they are traditionally thought to be congenital in origin, with an initiating event occurring in early embryologic development, some have suggested a more dynamic develop-mental process. 2, 3 We present a case of de novo AVM devel-opment in a region of the brain without abnormal vascularity on prior MR imaging and briefly review the literature on de novo AVM development and pathogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Direct {{communication}} between arteries and veins without <b>intervening</b> capillary <b>beds</b> {{is the primary}} pathology of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Although Notch signaling is implicated in embryonic arteriovenous (AV) differentiation, its function in the adult mammalian vasculature has not been established due to the embryonic lethality that often occurs in both gain- and loss-of-function mutants. We expressed a constitutively active Notch 4, int 3, in the adult mouse endothelium by using the tetracycline-repressible system to suppress int 3 during embryogenesis. int 3 caused profound blood vessel enlargement and AV shunting, which are hallmarks of AVM, and led to lethality within weeks of its expression. Vessel enlargement, a manifestation of AVM, occurred in an apparently tissue-specific fashion; the liver, uterus, and skin were affected. int 3 -mediated vascular defects were accompanied by arterialization, including ectopic venous expression of ephrinB 2, increased smooth muscle cells, and up-regulation of endogenous Notch signaling. Remarkably, the defective vessels and illness were reversed upon repression of int 3 expression. Finally, endothelial expression of a constitutively active Notch 1 induced similar hepatic vascular lesions. Our results provide gain-of-function evidence that Notch signaling in the adult endothelium is sufficient to render arterial characteristics and lead to AVMs...|$|R
40|$|Background: Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are high-flow lesions with {{abnormal}} {{connections between}} arteries and veins without an <b>intervening</b> capillary <b>bed.</b> Infrequently, the radiographic {{diagnosis of a}} vascular lesion will not support the clinical diagnosis of an AVM. These “discrepant” lesions are not adequately captured within the current classification system and represent a treatment dilemma. The {{purpose of this study}} is to review our center’s experience with vascular malformations where incongruity in a patient’s clinical and radiographic presentation produces a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Methods: A retrospective chart review of patients with atypical AVM pre sen ta tions was performed. Parameters reviewed included patient history and demogra phics, clinical presentation, radiological imaging, and treatment modalities. Results: Over a 15 -year period, we identified 7 cases of vascular malformations with discrepant clinical and radiological findings concerning flow characteristics. All patients were treated based on their radiological diagnosis and most were managed with sclerotherapy. No lesions evolved into a high-flow process, and there was no recurrence at a minimum of 24 months of follow-up. Conclusions: We have identified and described a unique subcategory of vascular malformations that have clinical features of high-flow malformations but radiological features of low-flow malformations. These lesions behave like low-flow malformations and should be treated as such. We propose that complex vascular malformations are best evaluated by both clinical and specialized diagnostic radiological means; the radiologic diagnoses should supplant what is found clinically, and ultimately treatment should be preferentially based on a radiological diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The Cerebrovascular {{system is}} {{characterized}} by complex interactions between various control mechanisms and physiological processes. Different approaches are used to provide better diagnostics and physiological under-standing and medical planning. The mathematical description and modeling of the human cerebrovascular system plays nowadays {{an important role in}} the comprehension of the genesis and development of cerebrovascular disorders by providing computer based simulation of dynamic processes. Intracranial Arteriovenous malformations (AVM) constitute usually congenital vascular anomalies of the brain. AVMs are composed of complex connections between the arteries and veins that lack an <b>intervening</b> capillary <b>bed.</b> A brain AVM (BAVM) is a set of abnormal vessels comprising feeding arteries; draining veins and a collection of arterialized veins called the Nidus. The AVM model with vessel dilation is more similar to clinical observations than those without vessel dilation.

This review paper on modeling is created from the acquired images from CTA, and MRA AND DSA and also how the model help the doctors to make diagnostic and therapeutic decisions to avoid brain hemorrhage.

40|$|International audienceHereditary hemorrhagic {{telangiectasia}} (HHT) is an autosomic dominant disorder, {{which is}} characterized by the development of multiple arterio-venous malformations in the skin, mucous membranes, and/or visceral organs. Pulmonary Arterio-Venous Malformation (PAVM) is an abnormal connection where feeding arteries shunt directly into draining veins with no <b>intervening</b> capillary <b>bed.</b> This condition may lead to paradoxical embolism and hemorrhagic complications. PAVMs patients should systematically be screened as the spontaneous complication rate is high, reaching almost 50 %. Chest enhanced contrast CT scanner is the reference screening and follow-up examination. When performed by experienced operators as the prime treatment, percutaneous embolization of PAVMs is a safe, efficient and sustained therapy. The accuracy of PAVM detection and quantification of its progression over time is the key of embolotherapy success. In this paper, we propose an automatic method for PAVM detection and quantification relying on a modeling of vessel deformation, i. e. local caliber increase, based on mathematical morphology. The pulmonary field and vessels are first segmented using geodesic operators. The vessel caliber is estimated by means of a granulometric measure and the local caliber increase is detected by using a geodesic operator, the h-maxdomes. The detection sensitivity can be tuned up according to the choice of the h value which models the irregularity of the vessel caliber along its axis and the PAVM selection is performed according to a clinical criterion of > 3 mm diameter of the feeding artery of the PAVM. The developed method was tested on a 20 patient dataset. A sensitivity study allowed choosing the irregularity parameter to maximize the true positive ratio reaching 85. 4 % in average. A specific false positive reduction procedure targeting the vessel trunks of the arterio-venous tree near mediastinum allows a precision increase from 13 % to 67 % with an average number of 1. 15 false positives per sca...|$|R
40|$|The Mid-Pliocene {{deposition}} in the Northern Apennines includes finely laminated sapropelitic horizons (insolation-cycles i- 292 to i- 282; 3. 058 to 2. 983 Myr) intervening within the slope-basin deposition of the foredeep, during a late highstand dated to the Globorotalia bononiensis zone. An integrated sedimentological, geochemical and micropaleontological {{study of the}} sapropel-bearing succession allowed the estimation of the time involved in the sapropel layer deposition, and to define {{the origin of the}} organic matter and the contribution of the primary productivity. The calculated average sedimentation rate of the section, including the <b>intervening</b> bioturbated <b>beds,</b> was about 0. 4 mm yr(- 1) -similar {{to the rest of the}} pelitic deposition during the whole Pliocene. Within individual sapropels, recurrently-spaced 0. 3 to 0. 6 mm thick laminae consisting of calcareous and/or siliceous plankton tests, alternating with pyrite- and organic-rich mudstones, were interpreted as the record of annual variation in the supply. We could thus calculate the duration of individual sapropels by simply counting the number of couplets occurring in the layers: these spanned between 7500 and 10 000 yr. The kerogen content of the sapropels is >= 65 % marine origin, whereas the same component in the intervening bioturbated intervals is similar to 10 %. This supports the hypothesis that the sapropel deposition is linked to significant primary productivity peaks. In contrast, changes in the terrigenous supply or strong disoxia were not recorded at the bottom. Taking the nutrient supply as constant, productivity peaks could then be forced mainly by variations in the intensity of the insolation. The latter, is linked to the precession minima and has a wide oscillation; this oscillation occurred even at the end of the Mid-Pliocene warm climate, which was mainly characterized by a progressive climate deterioration that heralded the Northern Hemisphere glaciation...|$|R
40|$|Hereditary hemorrhagic {{telangiectasia}} (HHT) or Rendu-Osler-Weber (ROW) {{syndrome is}} an autosomal dominant disease characterized by vascular malformations in multiple organ systems. HHT has an age-related penetrance and variable clinical expression. The clinical symptoms {{are caused by}} direct arteriovenous connections without an <b>intervening</b> capillary <b>bed.</b> This {{can result in a}} range of manifestations, from smaller mucocutaneous telangiectases to large visceral arteriovenous malformations (AVM). The clinical manifestations of HHT include recurrent epistaxis, multiple telangiectases, at characteristic sites (lips, oral cavity, nose, fingers, gastrointestinal telangiectases) and AVMs, mostly in the lung (PAVM), the liver (HAVM) or the brain (CAVM). The clinical diagnosis HHT is established using the Cura硯 criteria. At least three of the following four criteria are required for a certain clinical diagnosis: spontaneous and recurrent epistaxis, telangiectases at characteristic sites, visceral manifestations (gastrointestinal telangiectases, PAVM, CAVM, HAVM) and a first degree relative with HHT. In the presence of two criteria, the diagnosis is considered possible. Mutations in the endoglin (ENG) and activin A receptor type-like kinase 1 (ACVRL 1) genes {{have been shown to be}} associated with HHT; mutations in ENG cause HHT 1 and mutations in ACVRL 1 cause HHT 2. A combined syndrome of juvenile polyposis and HHT is caused by mutations in the SMAD 4 gene. The molecular and genetic characterization of HHT families is performed. Once a mutation in the majority of the families is found, the identification of carriers and non-carriers is possible and the HHT subtype is clear. This combined with well described phenotypes, allows for an extensive analysis of the genotype-phenotype correlation, which is performed. Analyses are performed to establish the phenotypic differences between HHT 1 and HHT 2 for the AVMs, telangiectases, episaxis and gastrointestinal telangiectases. The results published in this thesis have improved the knowledge of HHT. In families suspected of HHT, a general risk profile for the different clinical manifestations can be given to probands and family members according to the type of HHT. However, the risk profile of the clinical manifestations remains population based. An explanation for the question, why the one family member is affected with all symptoms whereas the other has only epistaxis, remains open and will be focus of future research. Identifying modifier genes or environmental factors influencing the expression of the HHT genes will possibly generate a more personalized risk profil...|$|R
40|$|The Late Eocene Benkovac Stone Member of the Promina Formation of {{northern}} Dalmatia, Croatia, is a thinly bedded succession of alternating carbonate sandstones and calcareous mudstones, ca. 40 m thick, exposed as a narrow, SE-trending outcrop belt {{near the town}} of Benkovac. This unit occurs in the middle part of the Promina Formation, which is a spectacular calciclastic succession of deposits of late Middle Eocene to Early Oligocene age, about 2000 m thick, showing an upward trasition from deep-marine turbidites to shallow-marine and alluvial deposits. The sheet-like sandstone beds of the Benkovac Stone Member are mainly 1 – 25 cm thick and have been classified into 6 facies and 3 subfacies, differing in stratification or showing various internal sequences of stratification types. The thicker and most common beds show plane-parallel stratification passing upward into hummocky cross-lamination and undulatory to flat parallel lamination (Facies S 1), or consist of only the latter two divisions (Facies S 2). Subordinate beds show convolute stratification (Facies S 3), are amalgamated (Facies S 4), or are homogenized and merely graded (Facies S 6). The thinner beds have more uneven boundaries and show translatory ripple cross-lamination (Subfacies S 5 a), climbing ripple cross-lamination (Subfacies S 5 b) or pinch-and-swell lamination attributed to starved and rolling-grain ripples (Subfacies S 5 c). The <b>intervening</b> mudstone <b>beds</b> (Facies M) are silt-streaked and bioturbated. Trace fossils indicate a combination of Zoophycos and Cruziana ichnofacies. The sedimentary succession was deposited in a microtidal offshore transition zone characterized by muddy “background” sedimentation punctuated by discrete storm events. The observed spectrum of tempestite sandstone beds represents a wide range of storm events, varying in magnitude and in the mode of sand dispersal – from the pure action of oscillatory waves to pure geostrophic currents. The majority of tempestites are attributed to a combination of these two end-member factors, with the geostrophic currents often enhanced by a high load of sediment suspension (density-modified currents). The Benkovac Stone Member is underlain by muddy offshore deposits (Debelo Brdo Member) and covered by sandy to gravelly shoreface deposits (Otavac Member), which in turn pass upwards into braidplain deltaic and alluvial deposits. This regressive succession {{is considered to be a}} parasequence deposited as a highstand systems tract during a gradual, stepwise rise of relative sea level. The thick parasequence consists of progradational and retrogradational sets of much smaller parasequences, the record of which differs markedly in the shoreface and offshore transitional part. The difference is attributed to the underlying contrast in the physical factors controlling the supply of sand to these shallow shelf zones...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} stratigraphic variations in the spatial distribution and density of natural hydraulic and other fractures within oil mature, shale-dominated strata from the Cleveland Basin, northeast England. The studied interval includes the Pliensbachian Cleveland Ironstone and Toarcian Whitby Mudstone Formations. The Cleveland Ironstone Formation (ca. 25 m thick) consists of silt- and mudstone units with discrete ironstone layers (seams). Ironstones account for 20 % of the thickness of the formation. The Whitby Mudstone Formation is up to ca. 100 m thick; up to 2 % of its total thickness consists of discrete calcium carbonate horizons, such as the Top Jet Dogger. Natural hydraulic fractures, characterised by plumose marks and concentric arrest lines on fracture surfaces are ubiquitous throughout both formations; shear fractures with mm- to cm-scale displacements occur locally, particularly within silt- and mudstones. Natural hydraulic fractures locally contain thin, sometimes fibrous, calcite fills and are commonly observed to terminate at bedding plane interfaces between silt- or mudstone and carbonate beds. We have recorded fracture locations and apertures along 139 transects in both shale (i. e. silt- and mudstone intervals) and carbonate strata. Natural hydraulic and shear fractures, measured along transects up to 50 m long within all lithologies in both formations, typically display uniform distributions. There is no correlation between spacing distribution and bulk extension in any lithology. Median fracture densities recorded within the Cleveland Ironstone Formation are higher in <b>intervening</b> ironstone <b>beds</b> (< 2. 1 fractures per m in ironstone layers) compared with dominant shales (< 0. 9 fractures per m in silt- and mudstones). A qualitatively similar pattern occurs within the Whitby Mudstone Formation. However, the absolute values of median fracture density within different members of the Whitby Mudstone Formation range from 2. 2 - 4. 3 fractures per m, consistent with field observations that this formation is more highly fractured than the Cleveland Ironstone Formation. Semi-quantitative estimates of the mineralogical "brittleness index" suggest the highly fractured, clay-rich Mulgrave Shale Member of the Whitby Mudstone Formation has a low brittleness. Our results are therefore inconsistent with the widely held assumption that natural fracture density is greatest within units characterised by a high brittleness index. We propose that stratigraphic variations in fracture densities are more likely to result from the different distributions of crack driving stresses; formations containing decimetre-scale, and most likely stiff, carbonate layers (such as the Cleveland Ironstone Formation) will have differing crack driving stresses compared with silt- and mudstone dominated successions (such as the Whitby Mudstone Formation). The high fracture density observed within the Mulgrave Shale Member is also consistent with propagation of natural hydraulic fractures driven by fluid overpressure caused by maturation of organic matter concentrated within this unit. The next step is to investigate the relative importance of maturation-driven overpressure v. mechanical heterogeneity by analysing the stratigraphic variations in fracture density within the underlying, organic-matter lean Redcar Mudstone Formation...|$|R
