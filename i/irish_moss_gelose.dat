5000|$|Mastocarpus stellatus, {{also called}} Clúimhín Cait (cats' puff), carragheen, or false <b>Irish</b> <b>moss,</b> is {{a species of}} red algae closely related to <b>Irish</b> <b>Moss,</b> or Chondrus crispus. It is {{collected}} in Ireland and Scotland, together with Chondrus crispus as <b>Irish</b> <b>moss,</b> dried, and sold for cooking and {{as the basis for}} a drink reputed to ward off colds and flu.|$|R
25|$|<b>Irish</b> <b>moss</b> (Chondrus crispus), often {{confused}} with Mastocarpus stellatus, {{is the source}} of carrageenan, which is used as a stiffening agent in instant puddings, sauces, and dairy products such as ice cream. <b>Irish</b> <b>moss</b> is also used by beer brewers as a fining agent.|$|R
50|$|It {{is found}} on rocky shores which {{are exposed to}} {{moderately}} strong currents and waves. It lives in shallow water (sublittorally) or close the low tide mark (intertidally). Unlike most stalked jellyfish it does not attach itself to marine eelgrass, preferring to inhabit <b>Irish</b> <b>moss</b> and false <b>Irish</b> <b>moss.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{tidal lagoon}} behind the dunes is habitat {{for a variety}} of Giant <b>Irish</b> <b>Moss</b> called Chondrus crispus. This is {{the only place in the}} world that it is found. To protect the unique strain of Giant <b>Irish</b> <b>Moss</b> and its habitat, the Basin Head {{watershed}} is designated a Marine Protected Area.|$|R
60|$|Seaweed.--Several {{kinds of}} seaweed, such as Laver and <b>Irish</b> <b>moss,</b> are eatable.|$|R
50|$|There are {{vegetarian}} {{alternatives to}} isinglass. Bentonite and <b>Irish</b> <b>moss</b> {{are the two}} most common.|$|R
50|$|During the summer, <b>Irish</b> <b>moss</b> seaweed is commercially {{harvested}} from the shores around North Cape and surrounding areas.|$|R
50|$|<b>Irish</b> <b>Moss</b> (also called sea moss) a milkshake-like beverage. It is {{made from}} Gracilaria spp, rather than Chondrus crispus.|$|R

5000|$|Blancmange ( [...] or , from French blanc-manger [...] ) is a sweet dessert {{commonly}} {{made with}} milk or cream and sugar thickened with gelatin, cornstarch or <b>Irish</b> <b>moss</b> (a source of carrageenan), and often flavoured with almonds.|$|R
50|$|Several {{species of}} edible kelp, {{including}} dulse, channelled wrack and <b>Irish</b> <b>moss</b> (Chondrus crispus), were eaten by coastal peasants during the Irish Potato Famine of 1846-48. Further inland, famine foods included stinging nettle, wild mustard, sorrel and watercress.|$|R
50|$|It lives {{primarily}} on the red algae Corallina officinalis, after which it takes its name, but is also known to live on <b>Irish</b> <b>Moss</b> (Chondrus crispus). The shell is often confused with the white growing tips of Corallina fronds.|$|R
50|$|After several {{attempts}} {{over a period}} of years, Glenorchy guide Harry Birley climbed the eastern peak of Earnslaw in 1890. He left a bent shilling in an <b>Irish</b> <b>Moss</b> bottle within a stone cairn, to prove he had reached the top.|$|R
50|$|Gelatinous {{extracts}} of the Chondrus crispus (<b>Irish</b> <b>moss)</b> seaweed {{have been}} used as food additives since approximately the fifteenth century. Carrageenan is a vegetarian and vegan alternative to gelatin in some applications or may be used to replace gelatin in confectionery.|$|R
50|$|Seaweed, by contrast, {{has always}} been an {{important}} part of the Irish diet and remains to some extent popular today. Two popular forms are Dillisk (Palmaria palmata) and Carageen <b>moss</b> or <b>Irish</b> <b>moss</b> (Chondrus crispus, Mastocarpus stellatus), also eaten in the Caribbean.|$|R
500|$|Examples of {{clarifying}} agents include isinglass, {{obtained from}} swimbladders of fish; <b>Irish</b> <b>moss,</b> a seaweed; kappa carrageenan, from the seaweed Kappaphycus cottonii; Polyclar (artificial); and gelatin. If a beer is marked [...] "suitable for Vegans", it was clarified either with seaweed or with artificial agents.|$|R
50|$|Beer is {{typically}} made from barley malt, water, hops and yeast {{and so is}} often suitable for vegans and vegetarians. Some beer brewers add finings to clarify the beer when racking into a barrel. Finings can include plant-derived products, like <b>Irish</b> <b>moss,</b> or animal-derived products, like isinglass and gelatin.|$|R
50|$|The {{house is}} now home t the Maritime and <b>Irish</b> <b>Mossing</b> Museum, owned and {{maintained}} by the Scituate Historical Society. There are exhibits of the mossing industry, ship building on the North River, shipwrecks, life saving. Open Sunday afternoons, 1-4 p.m. Sept through June. Sat and Sun, July and August.|$|R
30|$|Algae {{that are}} used for the {{production}} of natural substances are e.g. Caulerpa taxifolia, Chlorella vulgaris, Chondrus crispus (<b>Irish</b> <b>moss</b> or carrageen moss), Corallina officinalis, Delesseria sanguinea, Fucus serratus, Laminaria digitata, Laminaria japonica, Palmaria palmate (dulse), and Ulva lactuca (sea lettuce). The extract of the brown algae Fucus vesiculosus (bladderwrack algae) has the greatest number of notifiers (123).|$|R
50|$|In {{some parts}} of Asia, nori 海苔 (in Japan), zicai 紫菜 (in China), and gim 김 (in Korea), sheets of the dried red alga Porphyra are used in soups or to wrap sushi or onigiri. Chondrus crispus (commonly known as <b>Irish</b> <b>moss)</b> is another red alga used in {{producing}} various food additives, along with Kappaphycus and various gigartinoid seaweeds.|$|R
50|$|In {{the rocky}} {{areas of the}} {{intertidal}} zone there are the seaweeds, which are characterized by their brown tone, Fucus and Ascophyllum, some species of which have air bladders {{that allow them to}} float and receive direct sunlight even at high tide. Also present are Ectocarpus and red algas Polysiphonia, Neosiphonia, Porphyra and Chondrus (<b>Irish</b> <b>moss).</b>|$|R
50|$|Miminegash {{is within}} 5 mi of the {{following}} communities, known collectively as the St. Louis-Miminegash area. The area is a major source and processing center for <b>Irish</b> <b>Moss</b> harvested locally from the sea. Once processed into carageenan, it is used as an emulsifier or a source of gloss for things such as ice cream, chocolate milk or lipstick.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Irish</b> <b>moss</b> is {{commonly}} used as a clarifying agent or finings {{in the process of}} brewing (beer), particularly in homebrewing. A small amount is added to the kettle or [...] "copper" [...] where it is boiled with the wort, attracting proteins and other solids, which are then removed from the mixture after cooling along with the copper finings.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Falconer {{tried to}} dismiss the thought of Camilla Clark from her mind, {{but it would not}} be dismissed. Her {{conscience}} reproached her continually. She tried to compromise with it by saying that she would go down and see Camilla that evening and take her some nice fresh <b>Irish</b> <b>moss</b> jelly. It was so good for delicate people.|$|R
50|$|Historically, various {{substances}} such as egg whites, blood, milk, isinglass, and <b>Irish</b> <b>moss</b> {{have been}} used as finings. These are still used by some producers, but more modern substances have also been introduced and are more widely used, including bentonite, gelatin, casein, carrageenan, alginate, diatomaceous earth, pectinase, pectolyase, PVPP (Polyclar), kieselsol (colloidal silica), copper sulfate, dried albumen, hydrated yeast, and activated carbon.|$|R
50|$|This {{particular}} {{strain of}} <b>Irish</b> <b>Moss</b> called Chondrus crispus, is {{also referred to}} as Giant Moss. It is distinctive because it has a unique life cycle, does not attach to the bottom and is significantly larger than the normal plant found elsewhere. In addition, it has a higher concentration of carrageen, a stabilizing and thickening agent used in many household products.|$|R
5000|$|Examples of {{clarifying}} agents include isinglass, {{obtained from}} swimbladders of fish; <b>Irish</b> <b>moss,</b> a seaweed; kappa carrageenan, from the seaweed Kappaphycus cottonii; Polyclar (artificial); and gelatin. If a beer is marked [...] "suitable for Vegans", {{it was generally}} clarified either with seaweed or with artificial agents, although the [...] "Fast Cask" [...] method invented by Marston's in 2009 may provide another method.|$|R
50|$|Natural {{features}} include Cabin Run, Curley Hill, Geddes Run, Hickory Run, <b>Irish</b> Run, <b>Moss</b> Giel Rock, Slobbery Run, and Tohickon Creek.|$|R
25|$|Alginate, carboxymethycellulose, {{polyacrylic}} acid, {{tannic acid}} and polyphosphates can form extended networks between protein molecules in solution. The {{effectiveness of these}} polyelectrolytes depend on the pH of the solution. Anionic polyelectrolytes are used at pH values less than the isoelectric point. Cationic polyelectrolytes are at pH values above the pI. It {{is important to note}} that an excess of polyelectrolytes will cause the precipitate to dissolve back into the solution. An example of polyelectrolyte flocculation is the removal of protein cloud from beer wort using <b>Irish</b> <b>moss.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{community}} of Naufrage {{is located in}} Kings County, Prince Edward Island, Canada, in the northeast section of the province in Lot 43. The name Naufrage derives from the French word for shipwreck, naufrage, and stems from the numerous shipwrecks which occurred as early as 1719 that brought the first European population to the area. Once a booming area of industry surrounding the collection of <b>Irish</b> <b>Moss,</b> today the area is primarily known for lobster and tuna fishing, {{as well as a}} destination for tourists.|$|R
5000|$|Chondrus crispus—commonly called <b>Irish</b> <b>moss</b> or {{carrageen}} <b>moss</b> (<b>Irish</b> carraigín, [...] "little rock")—is {{a species}} of red algae which grows abundantly along the rocky parts of the Atlantic coast of Europe and North America. In its fresh condition this protist is soft and cartilaginous, varying in color from a greenish-yellow, through red, to a dark purple or purplish-brown. The principal constituent is a mucilaginous body, made of the polysaccharide carrageenan, which constitutes 55% of its weight. The organism also consists of nearly 10% protein and about 15% mineral matter, and is rich in iodine and sulfur. When softened in water it has a sea-like odour {{and because of the}} abundant cell wall polysaccharides it will form a jelly when boiled, containing from 20 to 100 times its weight of water.|$|R
50|$|Gracilaria {{is used as}} a food in Japanese, Hawaiian, and Filipino cuisine. In Japanese cuisine, it {{is called}} ogonori or ogo. In the Philippines, it is called gulaman and used to make gelatin, also called gulaman. In Jamaica, it is known as <b>Irish</b> <b>moss.</b> Gracilaria {{oligosaccharides}} with degree of polymerization 6 prepared by agarase digestion from agar-bearing Gracilaria sp. polysaccharides {{have been shown to be}} an effective prophylactic agent during in vitro and in vivo experiments against Japanese encephalitis viral infection. The sulfated oligosaccharides from Gracilaria sp. seem to be promising candidates for further development as antiviral agents.|$|R
50|$|Although carrageenans were {{introduced}} on an industrial {{scale in the}} 1930s, they were first used in China around 600 B.C. (where Gigartina was used) and in Ireland around 400 A.D. Carrageen gelatin can be prepared at home using the traditional recipe found in Diderot's Encyclopédie and used for centuries. 5oz rinsed <b>Irish</b> <b>moss</b> is cooked with 8 quarts of water for 10 minutes, stirred as it boils. Hard water should be mixed with 1/2 oz of borax. Two quarts of cold water are rapidly added to the hot brew, and after the mixture has cooled it is strained through a cloth. It is then cooled for 24 hours and becomes gelatinous.|$|R
50|$|Historic {{forms of}} {{marbling}} used both organic and inorganic pigments mixed with water for colors, and sizes were traditionally made from gum tragacanth (Astragalus spp.), gum karaya, guar gum, fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum), fleabane, linseed, and psyllium. Since the late 19th century, a boiled extract of the carrageenan-rich alga known as <b>Irish</b> <b>moss</b> (Chondrus crispus), has been employed for sizing. Today, many marblers use powdered carrageenan extracted from various seaweeds. Another plant-derived mucilage {{is made from}} sodium alginate. In recent years, a synthetic size made from hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, a common ingredient in instant wallpaper paste, is often used as a size for floating acrylic and oil paints.|$|R
50|$|In Ireland {{and parts}} of Scotland (where it {{is also known as}} (An) Cairgean in Scottish Gaelic), it is boiled in milk and strained, before sugar and other {{flavourings}} such as vanilla, cinnamon, brandy or whiskey are added. The end-product is a kind of jelly similar to pannacotta, tapioca, or blancmange. Similarly, in Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago Gracilaria spp is boiled with cinnamon and milk to make a thick drink called <b>Irish</b> <b>Moss</b> that is believed to be an aphrodisiac. In Venezuela it has been used for generations as a home remedy for sore throat and chest congestion, boiled in milk and served with honey before bed.|$|R
50|$|The {{resulting}} wort is then boiled, {{usually for}} 60-90 minutes. Hops are added {{at different times}} during the boil, depending on the desired result. Hops added {{at the beginning of}} the boil contribute bitterness, hops added in the last thirty minutes contribute flavor. Hops added in the last few minutes or even after the end of the boil contribute both flavor and hop aroma. These hop additions are generally referred to as bittering, flavor, and aroma additions respectively. Finings such as <b>Irish</b> <b>moss,</b> a form of seaweed, and others can be added in the final 15-30 minutes of the boil to help prevent haze in the resulting beer.|$|R
