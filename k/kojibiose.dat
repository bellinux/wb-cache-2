Indeed, phosphorylases are expected to give good results via their reversible reaction. The {{purpose of this study}} was to synthesis other novel oligosaccharides using <b>kojibiose</b> phosphorylase. Results Three novel oligosaccharides were synthesized by glucosyltransfer from β-D-glucose 1 -phosphate (β-D-G 1 P) to xylosylfructoside [O -α-D-xylopyranosyl-(1 → 2) -β-D-fructofuranoside] using Thermoanaerobacter brockii <b>kojibiose</b> phosphorylase. These oligosaccharides were isolated using carbon-Celite column chromatography and preparative high performance liquid chromatography. Gas liquid chromatography analysis of methyl derivatives, MALDI-TOF MS and NMR measurements were used for structural characterisation. The 1 H and 13 C NMR signals of each saccharide were assigned using 2 D-NMR including COSY (correlated spectroscopy), HSQC (herteronuclear single quantum coherence), CH 2 -selected E-HSQC (CH 2 -selected Editing-HSQC), HSQC-TOCSY (HSQC-total correlation spectroscopy) and HMBC (heteronuclear multiple bond correlation). Conclusion The structure of three synthesized saccharides were determined, and these oligosaccharides have been identified as O -α-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 → 2) - O -α-D-xylopyranosyl-(1 → 2) -β-D-fructofuranoside (saccharide 1), O -α-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 → 2) - O -α-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 → 2) - O -α-D-xylopyranosyl-(1 → 2) -β-D-fructofuranoside (saccharide 2) and O -α-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 →[2 - O -α-D-glucopyranosyl- 1] 2 → 2) - O -α-D-xylopyranosyl-(1 → 2) -β-D-fructofuranoside (saccharide 3). </p...|$|E

Feeding animals with GOS-Lu or <b>kojibiose</b> together with FeCl 3 increased hemoglobin (Hb) production (by 17 %) and mean Hb concentration into erythrocytes relative to animals administered with FeCl 3 alone (14. 1 % and 19. 7 %, respectively). Animals administered with prebiotics showed decreased plasmatic hepcidin levels, contributing to a higher intestinal absorption of the micronutrient. These data indicate that concurrent administration of these potentially prebiotic oligosaccharides together with a supplement of Fe ameliorates inflammation-mediated perturbations in the liver, according to the particular structure of the prebiotic compound, and result an attractive strategy to improve Fe absorption.

Bonded parameters for these saccharides are optimized by comparison to conformations sampled with an atomistic force field, in particular with respect to the representation of the most populated rotameric state for the glycosidic bond. Application of the new coarse-grained carbohydrate model to the oligosaccharides amylose and Curdlan shows a preservation of the main structural properties with 3 orders of magnitude more efficient sampling than the atomistic counterpart.

Cellulose that undergoes heat processing at 120  °C {{in the presence of}} [C 2 mim][Cl] can be converted into useful chemicals such as glucose, cellobiosan, 5 -HMF and levoglucosan via cellobiose and cello-oligosaccharide through reaction pathways that produce anhydrosugars and hydrolysis with water, which is produced by degradation of cellulose or is present in the reaction environment. These various compounds are further decomposed and low-molecular-weight compounds produced then react to form new kinds of polymers that are completely different from cellulose. In such processes, the [C 2 mim][Cl] moiety is incorporated into the polymers [78, 79]. In addition, during these reactions, inversion of a portion of glucose occurs, to produce various disaccharides such as maltose, nigerose, <b>kojibiose,</b> laminaribiose, isomaltose, and gentiobiose [80]. [C 2 mim][Cl] is an interesting reaction solvent that induces two different types of reactions (depolymerization of cellulose and the formation of new polymers). Furthermore, although the same types of reaction are thought to occur with cellulose in ionic liquids with the pyridinium cation as those observed to occur in [C 2 mim][Cl], the reaction rate is faster in cases where the anions are Cl− compared with Br− [81].|$|E

The enzyme could also hydrolyze the disaccharides <b>kojibiose</b> and sucrose (α- 1, 2 linkage), nigerose and turanose (α- 1, 3), leucrose (α- 1, 5), isomaltose and palatinose (α- 1, 6), and maltose (α- 1, 4) to a lesser extent. Trehalose was not, however, a substrate for the highly homologous α-glucosidase from T. thermophilus strain GK 24. The reciprocal replacement of a peptide containing eight amino acids in the α-glucosidases from strains HB 27 (LGEHNLPP) and GK 24 (EPTAYHTL) reduced the ability of the former to hydrolyze trehalose and provided trehalose-hydrolytic activity to the latter, showing that LGEHNLPP is necessary for trehalose recognition. Furthermore, disruption of the α-glucosidase gene significantly affected the growth of T. thermophilus HB 27 in minimal medium supplemented with trehalose, isomaltose, sucrose, or palatinose, to a lesser extent with maltose, but not with cellobiose (not a substrate for the α-glucosidase), indicating that the α-glucosidase is important for the assimilation of those four disaccharides but that it is also implicated in maltose catabolism...|$|E
40|$|The {{glycoside}} hydrolase family (GH) 65 {{is a family}} of inverting phosphorylases that act on a-glucosides. A GH 65 protein (Bsel_ 2816) from Bacillus selenitireducens MLS 10 exhibited inorganic phosphate (Pi) -dependent hydrolysis of <b>kojibiose</b> {{at the rate of}} 0. 43 s 21. No carbohydrate acted as acceptor for the reverse phosphorolysis using b-D-glucose 1 -phosphate (bGlc 1 P) as donor. During the search for a suitable acceptor, we found that Bsel_ 2816 possessed hydrolytic activity on bGlc 1 P with a kcat of 2. 8 s 21; moreover, such significant hydrolytic activity on sugar 1 -phosphate had not been reported for any inverting phosphorylase. The H 2 18 O incorporation experiment and the anomeric analysis during the hydrolysis of bGlc 1 P revealed that the hydrolysis was due to the glucosyl-transferring reaction to a water molecule and not a phosphatase-type reaction. Glycerol was found to be the best acceptor to generate 2 -O-a-D-glucosylglycerol (GG) at the rate of 180 s 21. Bsel_ 2816 phosphorolyzed GG through sequential Bi-Bi mechanism with a kcat of 95 s 21. We propose 2 -O-a-D-glucopyranosylglycerol: phosphate b-D-glucosyltransferase as the systematic name and 2 -O-a-D-glucosylglycerol phosphorylase as the short name for Bsel_ 2816. This is the first report describing a phosphorylase that utilizes polyols, and not carbohydrates, as suitable acceptor substrates...|$|E
40|$|A {{teichoic acid}} (TA) -like {{polysaccharide}} in Enterococcus faecalis {{has previously been}} shown to induce opsonic antibodies that protect against bacteremia after active and passive immunization. Here we present new data providing a corrected structure of the antigen and the epitope against which the opsonic antibodies are directed. Capsular polysaccharide isolated from E. faecalis strain 12030 by enzymatic digestion of peptidoglycan and chromatography (enzyme-TA) was compared with lipoteichoic acid (LTA) extracted using butanol and purified by hydrophobic-interaction chromatography (BuOH-LTA). Structural determinations were carried out by chemical analysis and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Antibody specificity was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the opsonophagocytosis assay. After alanine ester hydrolysis, there was structural identity between enzyme-TA and BuOH-LTA of the TA-parts of the two molecules. The basic enterococcal LTA structure was confirmed: 1, 3 -poly(glycerol phosphate) nonstoichiometrically substituted at position C- 2 of the glycerol residues with d-Ala and <b>kojibiose.</b> We also detected a novel substituent at position C- 2, [d-Ala→ 6]-α-d-Glcp-(1 → 2 -[d-Ala→ 6]-α-d-Glcp- 1 →). Antiserum raised against enzyme-TA bound equally well to BuOH-LTA and dealanylated BuOH-LTA as to the originally described enzyme-TA antigen. BuOH-LTA was a potent inhibitor of opsonophagocytic killing by the antiserum to enzyme-TA. Immunization with antibiotic-killed whole bacterial cells did not induce {{a significant proportion of}} antibodies directed against alanylated epitopes on the TA, and opsonic activity was inhibited completely by both alanylated and dealanylated BuOH-LTA. In summary, the E. faecalis strain 12030 enzyme-TA is structurally and immunologically identical to dealanylated LTA. Opsonic antibodies to E. faecalis 12030 are directed predominantly to nonalanylated epitopes on the LTA molecule...|$|E
40|$|AbstractExplicit-solvent {{molecular}} dynamics simulations (50 ns, 300 K) {{of the eight}} reducing glucose disaccharides (<b>kojibiose,</b> sophorose, nigerose, laminarabiose, maltose, cellobiose, isomaltose, and gentiobiose) {{have been carried out}} using the GROMOS 45 A 4 force field (including a recently reoptimized carbohydrate parameter set), to investigate and compare their conformational preferences, intramolecular hydrogen-bonding patterns, torsional dynamics, and configurational entropies. The calculated average values of the glycosidic torsional angles agree well with available experimental data, providing validation for the force field and simulation methodology employed in this study. These simulations show in particular that: 1) (1 → 6) -linked disaccharides are characterized by an increased flexibility, the absence of any persistent intramolecular hydrogen bond and a significantly higher configurational entropy (compared to the other disaccharides); 2) cellobiose presents a highly persistent interresidue hydrogen bond and a significantly lower configurational entropy (compared to the other disaccharides); 3) persistent hydrogen bonds are observed for all disaccharides (except (1 → 6) -linked) and typically involve a hydrogen donor in the reducing residue and an acceptor in the nonreducing one; 4) the probability distributions associated with the glycosidic dihedral angles ϕ and ψ are essentially unimodal for all disaccharides, and full rotation around these angles occurs at most once or twice for ϕ (never for ψ) on the 50 -ns timescale; and 5) the timescales associated with torsional transitions (except around ϕ and ψ) range from ∼ 30 ps (rotation of hydroxyl groups) to the nanosecond range (rotation of the lactol and hydroxymethyl groups, and around the ω-glycosidic dihedral angle in (1 → 6) -linked disaccharides) ...|$|E
40|$|Trehalose {{is absorbed}} by two {{distinct}} systems—one constitutive, the other induced by turanose {{and to a}} lesser extent by nigerose but not by trehalose. The constitutive system is apparently mediated by a surface trehalase; the induced system has the characteristics of a permease. The specificity of the induced system is apparently limited to the α glucosyl-glucose or glucosyl-fructose linkage, because absorption of <b>kojibiose,</b> nigerose, maltose, isomaltose, turanose, sucrose, and melezitose, in addition to that of trehalose, was increased. Absorption of β-linked or of galactose-containing disaccharides was not increased. The constitutive and induced trehalose-absorbing systems differ in their activity, specificity, lability to acid treatment, effects of substrate concentration, and pH optima. Both systems require oxygen, and no marked differential effects of inhibitors were observed. The activity of the induced system is proportional to log turanose concentration (from about 1 to 300 μg/ml), and is an approximate linear function of time of exposure (from about 1 to 50 min). Accumulation of trehalose occurred against a concentration gradient in both systems but particularly in the induced. No leakage was observed. The activity of the induced system declined slowly upon removal of the inducer. Accumulated trehalose is metabolized after activation by azide as are the endogenous trehalose reserves. The accumulated trehalose appears to enter the endogenous trehalose pool found in these spores, although some data suggest it may be more accessible. Respiratory data indicate that absorbed trehalose is available for metabolism while in transit from the external membrane to the internal pool...|$|E
