5|$|Alboin's {{death had}} a lasting impact, as it {{deprived}} the Lombards {{of the only}} leader they had that could have kept together the newborn Germanic entity. His end also represents {{the death of the}} last of the line of the hero-kings that <b>had</b> <b>led</b> <b>the</b> Lombards through their migrations from the Elba to Italy. His fame survived him for many centuries in epic poetry, with Saxons and Bavarians celebrating his prowess in battle, his heroism, and the magical properties of his weapons.|$|E

The Surrey finger spin pairing of Jim Laker and Tony Lock <b>had</b> <b>led</b> <b>the</b> decimation, taking 38 of the 40 wickets of dry dusty wickets doctored for their use. In Australia's match against Surrey before the Tests, the pair had taken 19 wickets as the tourists lost to a county side {{for the first time}} since 1912.|$|E

5|$|Despite City {{finishing}} {{outside the}} play-off places, they were again installed as favourites for promotion by bookmakers for the 2008–09 season. McCall released 13players from his squad and {{replaced them with}} a number of signings with experience in a higher division, as well as Michael Boulding, who was one of League Two's top goalscorers during the 2007–08 campaign. McCall's side made a good start to the season, and after winning five of their opening six league games, went top of the league – the first time City <b>had</b> <b>led</b> <b>the</b> table in seven years.|$|E
5|$|Jim Tatum {{was hired}} in 1947, after a brief stint at Oklahoma where he <b>had</b> <b>led</b> <b>the</b> Sooners to a conference {{championship}} in his only season there. He was Maryland's sixth head coach in eight years, but Tatum stayed for nine seasons and became the school's most successful head coach in modern history. During his tenure, he led Maryland to two national championships (one retroactive), three conference championships, three perfect seasons, six top-20 final rankings, and five bowl game appearances. Seven of his players were named first-team All-Americans, including five consensus All-Americans. Under Tatum, Maryland finished every season with a winning record.|$|E
5|$|Levin {{was interviewed}} by police in November 1985, when he said Winston Silcott <b>had</b> <b>led</b> <b>the</b> attack with a machete; he told the court in 2014 that {{that had been a}} mistake. The court heard that, during Nove's 1992–1994 investigation, police offered Levin {{immunity}} from prosecution, gave him £5,000 and paid for a flight from Spain when he missed his flight home from a holiday. They approached him again in January 2008 for his testimony and helped him with expenses and a deposit for accommodation.|$|E

5|$|Michael Schumacher, {{driving for}} Ferrari, <b>had</b> <b>led</b> <b>the</b> {{championship}} {{by a single}} point ahead of Villeneuve going into the race. During the race Villeneuve and Schumacher collided while battling for the lead and the resulting damage to Schumacher's car forced him to retire. The blame for the incident was later attributed to Schumacher by the sport's governing body, the FIA, and he was stripped of his second-place finish in the championship. Schumacher's tactics were widely criticised by the media, including publications based in his home country of Germany, and in Ferrari's home country of Italy.|$|E
