The Zytel product line is based mostly on nylon 66, but also includes grades based on nylon 6 as a matrix, long chain nylons such as nylon 610 (if based on at least one renewable monomer they are branded Zytel RS), and copolymers including a transparent resin called Zytel 330. Resins based on polyphthalamides are branded 'Zytel HTN'.

5000|$|The most {{important}} flame retardants systems used act {{either in the}} gas phase where they remove the high energy radicals H and OH from the flame or in the solid phase, where they shield the polymer by forming a charred layer and thus protect the polymer from being attacked by oxygen and heat.Flame retardants based on bromine or chlorine, {{as well as a}} number of phosphorus compounds act chemically in the gas phase and are very efficient. Others only act in the condensed phase such as metal hydroxides (aluminum trihydrate, or ATH, magnesium hydroxide, or MDH, and boehmite), metal oxides and salts (zinc borate and zinc oxide, zinc hydroxystannate), as well as expandable graphite and some nanocomposites (see below).

The largest applications are in electrical parts, with smaller usage in automotive and textiles. A polycyclic chlorohydrocarbon, DECHLORANE PLUS, is employed in low smoke formulations. Decabromodiphenyl ether has major use in polyamide 6. Alternative brominated additives include decabromodiphenylethane, polybrominated phenylindane, polymeric dibromophenylene oxide, polybrominated polystyrene and oligomeric glycidyl ethers of tetrabromobisphenol A, and polypentabromobenzyl acrylate. In non-reinforced polyamide 6, melamine cyanurate is effective. With glass reinforcements, some melamine pyro- or polyphosphates are useful.

The condensed-phase mechanism is shown to involve generation of phosphorus acid species followed by reaction of these with MMA units giving rise to methacrylic acid units. The methacrylic acid units subsequently form anhydride links, which probably impede depolymerization of the remaining MMA sequences, resulting in evolution of less MMA (the major fuel when MMA-based polymers burn).

40|$|Flammability of {{textiles}} is a surface-confined phenomenon: undoubtedly, the textile surface, {{which is the}} most critical area, controls the mass and heat transfers, accountable for fueling the flame, from and to the surroundings. Consequently, the physico-chemical features of the textile surface {{play a crucial role in}} favoring or preventing the ignition and combustion processes. When the textile is not inherently <b>flame</b> <b>retarded,</b> it is possible to modify its surface in order to make it <b>flame</b> <b>retarded.</b> More specifically, it is possible to exploit surface engineered strategies in order to significantly modify (and improve) the fire performance of textile materials: in fact, tailoring their surface by depositing designed on purpose coatings allows slowing down the heat and mass transfer phenomena occurring during the fire stages, hence enhancing the fire behavior of the treated substrates.

40|$|Radical {{generators}} as synergists in <b>flame</b> <b>retarded</b> polymers {{have been}} used in combination with brominated flame retardants for decades. However, due to the low thermal stability of radical generators under the usual polymer processing conditions the use was limited to selected applications e. g. in polystyrene foams. The need to find efficient halogen free flame retardants resulted inter alia in the discovery and commercialization of hindered amine light stabilizers based on alkoxyamines (NOR-HALS). NOR-HALS provide flame retardancy of polypropylene and polyolefin fibers, non-wovens and films. The performance of the NOR molecules depends on their structure i. e. the capability to degrade into nitroxyl plus alkyl or aminyl plus alkoxy radicals. Through formation of radicals a fast degradation of the polymer chain is induced and flame retardancy is achieved by removing the substrate from the flame. On the other hand, the formed radicals are involved in the free radical chemical reactions during the combustion process. Furthermore, alkoxy amines can interact with brominated flame retardants and facilitate the release of bromine, consequently increasing the overall FR performance. Therefore, it is possible with NORs to design flame retardant polyolefin molding compositions with lower levels of halogenated flame retardants and, in addition, to eliminate antimony trioxide. Moreover the hindered amine (HALS) structure provides light and long-term thermal stability of <b>flame</b> <b>retarded</b> formulations. Following the success of NOR based flame retardants a number of alternative radical generator molecules have been identified namely azo compounds, triazenes, hydrazones and azines. Especially combinations of Azo and NOR structures in one molecule show increased performance at loadings as low as 0. 5 % in polypropylene films, including light and long-term thermal stability, and act synergistically with halogen, phosphorus and inorganic flame retardants. Although the performance of alkoxyamines in thin sections such as films is well documented and the UL 94 V- 2 classification is often obtained in moldings, formulations usually fail in achieving the UL 94 V- 0 classification as burning drips cannot be avoided despite short burning times. For the first time a new class of nitrogen based radical generators can be presented whereas in combination with selected phosphorus derivatives <b>flame</b> <b>retarded</b> polypropylene with UL 94 V- 0 classification is accessible. Thermal stability and degradation of the new class into radicals is correlated to the molecular structure and can be adjusted in line with the degradation of the polymer and the synergist.
