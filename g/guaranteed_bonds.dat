40|$|The {{question}} of whether, {{and to what}} extent, markets price contract terms in government bond issues {{has been one of}} considerable debate in the literature. We use a natural experiment thrown up by the Euro area sovereign debt crisis of 2010 - 2013 to test whether a particular set of contract terms – ones that gave an advantage to sovereign <b>guaranteed</b> <b>bonds</b> over garden variety sovereign bonds – was priced. These contract terms turned out to be important for the holders of <b>guaranteed</b> <b>bonds</b> during the Greek debt restructuring of 2012, where they helped the holders of <b>guaranteed</b> <b>bonds</b> escape the haircut that other holders of Greek sovereign debt suffered. We find evidence that the market did indeed price in the advantage that <b>guaranteed</b> <b>bonds</b> had over other bonds in the months immediately prior to the Greek restructuring. However, we also find that this evidence of highly rational pricing disappears in the post crisis period. And instead, we find what looks like a pricing anomaly, where rational pricing is inverted...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{economic}} and historical literature on debt mutualization in Europe with reference to pre- 1914 <b>guaranteed</b> <b>bonds</b> and current Eurobonds debate. We emphasize that, notwithstanding the differences in scale and nature, debt mutualization solutions similar to Eurobonds were tried before, and the closest historical examples to the present debate are the pre- 1914 <b>guaranteed</b> <b>bonds.</b> We highlight three key characteristics of debt mutualization, which are apparent both in the current debate and in history: moral hazard, debt dilution and conditionality. We show thatthe fears about short-run dilution and moral hazard were not unknown to pre- 1914 market participants. These problems were partly addressed by mechanisms of conditionality such as international financial control. The historical {{evidence suggests that the}} dilution of outstanding obligations may be overplayed in the current debate. On the contrary, creditors’ moral hazard (ignored in current debt mutualization proposals) was as problematic as the usual debtor’s moral hazard –especially when the groups of countries guaranteeing the bonds and the creditor nations did not overlap entirely...|$|E

40|$|In 2010 {{authorities}} {{have taken the}} first steps to end some of the public support measures put in place {{in response to the}} financial crisis, starting with government guarantees for bond issues. Financial institutions have made extensive use of this tool, which has been effective in avoiding a further tightening of funding conditions, but this type of public support has, nonetheless, raised some concerns. First, the cost of issuing <b>guaranteed</b> <b>bonds</b> has mainly reflected the characteristics of the sovereign guarantor rather than those of the issuer, thus favouring “weak” borrowers with a “strong” sovereign backing. This situation has the potential to distort competition and create incentives for excessive risk taking. Such effects could have been reduced by the choice of a different fee determination mechanism. Second, the continued availability in 2010 of guarantee schemes, despite a declining overall usage, may be alleviating the pressure on some weak financial institutions to address their weaknesses: the average creditworthiness of banks issuing after mid- 2009, when market conditions became more favourable, has sharply declined.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effect of}} the removal of government guarantees on bank risk taking. We exploit the removal of guarantees for German Landesbanken which results in lower credit ratings, higher funding costs, and a loss in franchise value. This removal was announced in 2001, but Landesbanken were allowed to issue <b>guaranteed</b> <b>bonds</b> until 2005. We find that Landesbanken lend to riskier borrowers after 2001. This effect is most pronounced for Landesbanken with the highest expected decrease in franchise value. Landesbanken also significantly increased their off-balance sheet exposure to the global ABCP market. Our results provide implications for the debate on how to remove guarantees...|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} effects of the {{decision}} of parent companies to guarantee bonds issued by their subsidiaries. The market value of the parent firm’s outstanding bonds drops five times more when it issues a guarantee for subsidiary debt than when it issues a new bond in its own name. This effect is exacerbated when the parent is financially constrained, or when its bonds are less liquid. Subsidiary guaranteed debt has less stringent covenant protection, and a longer maturity, consistent with subsidiary guaranteed debt providing greater flexibility to the parent. Our estimates imply a value of financial flexibility, measured as the difference in the impact on bond yield spreads between parent and subsidiary <b>guaranteed</b> <b>bonds,</b> of about 10 bps...|$|E

40|$|The investors’ {{market for}} {{structured}} investment products has traversed an impressive evolution {{during the last}} fifteen years.

They enable investors to change and optimize their risk-return profile by asymmetric pay-off profiles. In other words the investment universe significantly enlarges {{by the appearance of}} these new types of investment opportunities. The economic benefit of such products has different aspects: As derivatives allow a very efficient risk transfer, they also ease the investors’ risk and asset allocation. On the other hand they promote access to underlyings, that otherwise would not be possible to obtain. Especially advanced structured products are often based on underlyings – like commodities – that usually cannot be easily bought by private investors. Thereby structured products fulfill a market completion and generate additional diversification potential. As market standard these products are issued as capital <b>guaranteed</b> <b>bonds,</b> thereby minimizing the downside risks for the investors.
