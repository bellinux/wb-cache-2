5|$|A {{number of}} {{conflicts}} occurred between the Empire and <b>its</b> <b>neighbors.</b> Brazil experienced no serious conflicts with <b>its</b> <b>neighbors</b> {{to the north}} and west, due to the buffer of the nearly impenetrable and sparsely populated Amazonian rainforest. In the south, however, the colonial disputes inherited from Portugal and Spain over the control of the navigable rivers and plains which formed the frontiers continued after independence. The lack of mutually agreed borders in this area led to several international conflicts, from the Cisplatine War to the Paraguayan War.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 18th century, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, {{one of the largest and}} most populous European states, was little more than a pawn of <b>its</b> <b>neighbors</b> (the Russian Empire, Prussia and Austria), who interfered in its domestic politics almost at will. In the second half of the 18th century, the Commonwealth was repeatedly partitioned by the neighboring powers and ceased to exist.|$|E
5|$|However, unlike <b>its</b> <b>neighbors,</b> Argentina became {{capable of}} still having {{relatively}} healthy growth rates during the 1920s, not being as {{affected by the}} worldwide collapse on commodity prices such as Brazil and Chile. Similarly, the gold standard was still in place at a time almost all European countries had abandoned it. Automobile ownership {{in the country in}} 1929 was the highest in the Southern hemisphere.|$|E

30|$|Since {{the fault}} {{is assumed to}} be in the {{vicinity}} of the first PMU, <b>its</b> <b>neighbor</b> PMUs need to calculate the fault distance from the first PMU. When the fault occurs between the first PMU and one of <b>its</b> <b>neighbor</b> PMUs, the fault distance is calculated according to (3).|$|R
5|$|Mercury(II) oxide, {{the main}} oxide of mercury, arises when the metal {{is exposed to}} air for long periods at {{elevated}} temperatures. It reverts to the elements upon heating near 400°C, as was demonstrated by Joseph Priestley in an early synthesis of pure oxygen. Hydroxides of mercury are poorly characterized, as they are for <b>its</b> <b>neighbors</b> gold and silver.|$|E
5|$|Popular dishes include lechón, adobo, sinigang, kare-kare, tapa, crispy pata, pancit, lumpia, and halo-halo. Some common local {{ingredients}} used {{in cooking}} are calamansi, coconuts, saba (a kind of short wide plantain), mangoes, ube, milkfish, and fish sauce. Filipino taste buds {{tend to favor}} robust flavors, but the cuisine is not as spicy as those of <b>its</b> <b>neighbors.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Commonwealth's magnates viewed reform with {{suspicion}} and neighboring powers, {{content with the}} deterioration of the Commonwealth, abhorred the thought of a resurgent and democratic power on their borders. With the Commonwealth Army reduced to around 16,000, it was easy for <b>its</b> <b>neighbors</b> to intervene directlythe Imperial Russian Army numbered 300,000 and the Prussian Army and Imperial Austrian Army had 200,000 each.|$|E

5|$|Until 1864, {{communications}} between Fort Greble and <b>its</b> <b>neighbors</b> {{had to be}} routed through departmental headquarters in Washington. After {{a test of the}} system completely failed, efforts were made to establish signaling points between the forts, and the forts themselves were connected to Washington via telegraph wire. Signal detachments were present at Fort Stanton, near Uniontown, and sometimes visited Fort Greble as part of training efforts.|$|E
5|$|From Almaty in Kazakhstan, {{the railway}} extends to Tashkent and Samarkand, Uzbekistan {{and then to}} Tejen, Turkmenistan. From Tejen, another line {{continues}} to Ashgabat, the capital of Turkmenistan. After Ashgabat, the line ends at Türkmenbaşy, Turkmenistan, a port on the Caspian Sea. (After a direct rail link between Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan opened, it became possible for the freight to bypass Uzbekistan, which has poor relations with <b>its</b> <b>neighbors).</b>|$|E
5|$|Historically, Ashland {{has been}} {{something}} of a political outlier in southwest Oregon. In the presidential election of 1860, Ashland favored Abraham Lincoln while <b>its</b> <b>neighbors</b> strongly preferred pro-slavery candidates. In the early 1900s, Ashland voters supported women's suffrage and prohibition, generally {{out of step with the}} rest of the region. In more recent elections, liberal Ashland has supported tax levies and environmental regulations opposed by voters elsewhere in Jackson and nearby counties. Critics sometimes refer to the city as the People's Republic of Ashland.|$|E
50|$|The rule {{proposed}} by Gacs, Kurdyumov, and Levin sets {{the state of}} each cell as follows. If a cell is 0, its next state is formed as the majority among the values of itself, <b>its</b> immediate <b>neighbor</b> to the left, and <b>its</b> <b>neighbor</b> three spaces to the left. If, on the other hand, a cell is 1, its next state is formed symmetrically, as the majority among the values of itself, <b>its</b> immediate <b>neighbor</b> to the right, and <b>its</b> <b>neighbor</b> three spaces to the right. In randomly generated instances, this achieves about 78% accuracy in correctly determining the majority.|$|R

5|$|In graph theory, a {{bipartite graph}} is a graph whose {{vertices}} are {{split into two}} colors, such that neighboring vertices have different colors. If a connected graph has no odd cycles, then a bipartition can be constructed by choosing a base vertex v and coloring every vertex black or white, depending on whether its distance from v is even or odd. Since the distance between v and itself is 0, and 0 is even, the base vertex is colored differently from <b>its</b> <b>neighbors,</b> which lie {{at a distance of}} 1.|$|E
5|$|Lava {{flows from}} Mauna Kea {{overlapped}} in complex layers {{with those of}} <b>its</b> <b>neighbors</b> during its growth. Most prominently, Mauna Kea is built upon older flows from Kohala to the northwest, and intersects the base of Mauna Loa to the south. The original eruptive fissures (rift zones) in the flanks of Mauna Kea were buried by its post-shield volcanism. Hilo Ridge, a prominent underwater rift zone structure east of Mauna Kea, was once {{believed to be a}} part of the volcano; however, it is now understood to be a rift zone of Kohala that has been affected by younger Mauna Kea flows.|$|E
5|$|Norfolk {{is linked}} with <b>its</b> <b>neighbors</b> through an {{extensive}} network of arterial and Interstate highways, bridges, tunnels, and bridge-tunnel complexes. The major east-west routes are Interstate 64, U.S. Route 58 (Virginia Beach Boulevard) and U.S. Route 60 (Ocean View Avenue). The major north-south routes are U.S. Route 13 and U.S. Route 460, {{also known as}} Granby Street. Other main roadways in Norfolk include Newtown Road, Waterside Drive, Tidewater Drive, and Military Highway. The Hampton Roads Beltway (I-64, I-264, I-464, and I-664) makes a loop around Norfolk.|$|E

5|$|Not all {{relations}} between Egypt and <b>its</b> <b>neighbors</b> were peaceful during Djedkare's reign. In particular, {{one of the}} earliest known depictions of a battle or city being besieged is found in the tomb of Inti, an official from the 21st nome of Upper Egypt, who lived during the late Fifth Dynasty. The scene shows Egyptian soldiers scaling the walls of a near eastern fortress on ladders. More generally, ancient Egyptians seem to have regularly organised punitive raids in Canaan during the later Old Kingdom period but did not attempt to establish a permanent dominion there.|$|E
5|$|Other animals Deinonychus shared {{its world}} with include herbivorous dinosaurs {{such as the}} armored Sauropelta and the ornithopods Zephyrosaurus and Tenontosaurus. In Oklahoma, the {{ecosystem}} of Deinonychus also included the large theropod Acrocanthosaurus, the huge sauropod Sauroposeidon, the crocodilians Goniopholis and Paluxysuchus, and the gar Lepisosteus. If the teeth found in Maryland are those of Deinonychus, then <b>its</b> <b>neighbors</b> would include Astrodon and a nodosaur (called Priconodon) only known from teeth. The middle portion of the Cloverly Formation ranges in age from 115 ± 10Ma near the base to 108.5 ± 0.2Ma near the top.|$|E
5|$|The idea of {{reforming}} the Commonwealth gained traction from the mid-17th century; it was however viewed with suspicion {{not only by}} its magnates but also by neighboring countries, which had been content with {{the deterioration of the}} Commonwealth and abhorred the thought of a resurgent and democratic power on their borders. With the Commonwealth Army reduced to around 16,000, it was easy for <b>its</b> <b>neighbors</b> to intervene directly (The Imperial Russian Army numbered 300,000 troops overall; The Prussian Army and Imperial Army of the Holy Roman Empire, 200,000 each).|$|E

The sawt style of music, which {{involves}} a complex form of urban music, performed by an Oud (plucked lute), a violin and mirwas (a drum), is also popular in Bahrain. Ali Bahar was one of the most famous singers in Bahrain. He performed his music with his Band Al-Ekhwa (The Brothers). Bahrain was also the site of the first recording studio amongst the Persian Gulf states.|$|E
5|$|The {{next decade}} {{was marked by}} several rebellions against the new {{political}} order, including naval revolts (1891, 1893–94), the Federalist Rebellion (1893–95), the War of Canudos (1896–97), and the Vaccine Revolt (1904), during which {{the quality of the}} Brazilian Navy severely declined relative to <b>its</b> <b>neighbors</b> thanks to an Argentine–Chilean naval arms race. By {{the turn of the twentieth}} century, an antiquated Brazilian naval fleet with just forty-five percent of its authorized personnel (in 1896) and only two modern armored warships could be faced by Argentine and Chilean navies filled with ships ordered in the last decade.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth is a brittle metal with a white, silver-pink hue, often {{occurring}} in its native form, with an iridescent oxide tarnish showing many colors from yellow to blue. The spiral, stair-stepped structure of bismuth crystals {{is the result}} of a higher growth rate around the outside edges than on the inside edges. The variations in the thickness of the oxide layer that forms on the surface of the crystal causes different wavelengths of light to interfere upon reflection, thus displaying a rainbow of colors. When burned in oxygen, bismuth burns with a blue flame and its oxide forms yellow fumes. Its toxicity is much lower than that of <b>its</b> <b>neighbors</b> in the periodic table, such as lead, antimony, and polonium.|$|E
