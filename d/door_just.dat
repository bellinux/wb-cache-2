Afterwards, Mark and Roger gather to break back into their locked apartment with their friends ("Happy New Year"). A new voicemail reveals that Mark's footage of the riot has earned him a job offering at a tabloid news company called Buzzline ("Voice Mail #3"). The others finally break through the <b>door</b> <b>just</b> as Benny arrives, saying he wants to call a truce and revealing that Mimi, a former girlfriend of his, convinced him to change his mind.

25|$|Ripburger flees in a {{semi-trailer}} truck, but as Ben and Maureen {{ride away}} he reappears and rams them. The Vultures arrive driving their flightless cargo plane, which scoops up the truck along with Ben, Maureen, and Ben's bike. The plane and truck wind up hanging precariously {{over the edge}} of Poyahoga Gorge, and Ripburger falls to his death. Maureen and the Vultures flee the plane while Ben makes it out at the last second by jumping his bike out the back cargo <b>door</b> <b>just</b> as the truck explodes and it and the plane fall into the gorge. Members of the biker gangs attend Malcolm's funeral, at which Father Torque delivers a eulogy. Maureen takes over Corley Motors, and Ben rides away into the sunset.|$|E
25|$|The bladder {{walls are}} very thin and transparent, but are {{sufficiently}} inflexible {{to maintain the}} bladder's shape despite the vacuum created within. The entrance, or 'mouth', of the trap is a circular or oval flap whose upper half is joined {{to the body of}} the trap by very flexible, yielding cells which form an effective hinge. The door rests on a platform formed by the thickening of the bladder wall immediately underneath. A soft but substantial membrane called the velum stretches in a curve around the middle of this platform, and helps seal the door. A second band of springy cells cross the <b>door</b> <b>just</b> above its lower edge, and provide the flexibility for the bottom of the door to become a bendable 'lip' which can make a perfect seal with the velum.|$|E

25|$|Five days later, on July 23, 1836, {{a band of}} Seminole {{attacked}} the lighthouse. Thompson and Carter reached the lighthouse tower; Thompson later recounted feeling rifle balls go through his clothes and hat. The Seminoles grabbed the <b>door</b> <b>just</b> after he turned the key to lock it. Thompson exchanged rifle fire with the Seminoles from upper windows in the tower {{for the rest of}} the day but after dark, the raiders approached the tower, setting fire to the door and a boarded-up window at ground level. Rifle balls had penetrated tanks in the bottom of the tower, which held 225 gallons of lamp oil for the light, and the oil caught fire. Thompson's clothing had been soaked with oil, and he and Carter retreated to the top of the tower, taking a keg of gunpowder, balls, and a rifle with them. The two men cut away a part of the wooden stairway below them in the tower before being driven out of the top by the searing flames.|$|E
500|$|Timber framed, it is a two storey {{building}} with five {{windows and a}} panelled <b>door.</b> <b>Just</b> to the north is St. John's Primary School, and St. John's Church beyond this. The church was built in 1864 by Arthur Blomfield in the High Victorian Early Gothic style. It is built from [...] "red and gault brick with stone dressings and peg tile gabled roofs" [...] and features a [...] "circular bell turret with conical roof". It became a Grade II listed building in 1986.|$|E
500|$|After {{the more}} {{produced}} Rings Around the World, which {{relied heavily on}} computers and electronics, the group were keen to make Phantom Power [...] "a little more human" [...] with guitarist Huw Bunford stating: [...] "with technology {{you can do anything}} these days, but sometimes less is more". Many songs on the album are acoustic based and bass player Guto Pryce has claimed that they sounded [...] "pretty good right from the start" [...] which also contributed to the decision to avoid [...] "over-tweak them in the studio". Despite this the group did work electronic loops into several tracks after Ciaran bought a large number of [...] "sound effect and light music" [...] vinyl records from a man who worked in the same building. According to Rhys: [...] "he knocked on the <b>door</b> <b>just</b> as we were beginning the album: [...] "hey, I've got these records to sell, are ya interested?" [...] And Cian went down to check them out and gave him a hundred pounds on the spot and carried 700 albums back to our tiny room".|$|E

2500|$|In 1970, Boeing {{received}} only 37 orders. Facing financial difficulties, Boeing considered closing the 737 production-line and selling the design to Japanese aviation companies. After {{the cancellation of}} the Boeing Supersonic Transport, and scaling back of 747 production, enough funds were freed up to continue the project. [...] In a bid to increase sales by offering a variety of options, Boeing offered a 737C (Convertible) model in both -100 and -200 lengths. This model featured a [...] freight <b>door</b> <b>just</b> behind the cockpit, and a strengthened floor with rollers, which allowed for palletized cargo. A 737QC (Quick Change) version with palletized seating allowed for faster configuration changes between cargo and passenger flights. With the improved short-field capabilities of the 737, Boeing offered the option on the -200 of the gravel kit, which enables this aircraft to operate on remote, unpaved runways. Until retiring its -200 fleet in 2007, Alaska Airlines used this option for some of its rural operations in Alaska. Northern Canadian operators Air Inuit, Air North, Canadian North, First Air and Nolinor Aviation still operate the gravel kit aircraft in Northern Canada, where gravel runways are common.|$|E
