2500|$|The book {{begins by}} {{describing}} Yahweh's judgement. The threefold repetition of [...] "I will sweep away" [...] in [...] emphasizes {{the totality of}} the destruction, as the number three often signifies complete perfection in the Bible. The order of creatures in [...] ("humans and animals ... the birds ... the fish") is the opposite of the creation order in , signifying an undoing of creation. This is also signified by the way that [...] "from the face of the earth" [...] forms an <b>inclusio</b> around , hearkening back to how the phrase is used in the Genesis flood narrative in , , , where it also connotes an undoing of creation.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Inclusio</b> also abounds {{in other}} {{books of the}} Bible. An obvious example of <b>inclusio</b> {{is found in the}} first and last (29th) verses of Psalm 118 [...] "הודו לה' כי-טוב כי לעולם חסדו.". Another, more disputed, example may be found in the Book of Ruth, where one finds a certain resemblance, if {{somewhat}} chiastic, between 1:1 and 1:22—in the former Elimelekh leaves Bethlehem in favor of Moab, and in the latter Ruth and Naomi leave Moab in favor of Bethlehem. Finally, {{it has been suggested that}} Genesis 2 contains <b>inclusio,</b> for the male is created at the start of the passage and the female at the end, providing textual evidence for the parallels between the two.|$|E
5000|$|In biblical studies, <b>inclusio</b> is a {{literary}} device {{based on a}} concentric principle, also known as bracketing or an envelope structure, which consists of creating a frame by placing similar material {{at the beginning and}} end of a section, although whether this material should consist of a word or a phrase, or whether greater amounts of text also qualify, and of what length the frames section should be, are matters of some debate. <b>Inclusio</b> is found in various sources, both antique and new. The purpose of an <b>inclusio</b> may be structural - to alert the reader to a particularly important theme - or it may be serve to show how the material within the <b>inclusio</b> relates to the <b>inclusio</b> itself. An important case of this occurs in the Gospel of Mark's treatment of the [...] "Cursing of the Fig Tree" [...] and the [...] "Cleansing of the Temple" [...] (Chapter 11). By giving the first half of the story before the Cleansing of the Temple, and the conclusion after, Mark creates a [...] "frame" [...] that effectively highlights that he wants the Cleansing of the Temple to be seen in light of the Cursing of the Fig Tree - ie. Jesus' actions in the Temple are not just a reform measure, but a judgment against it.|$|E
50|$|In some languages, nouns in the genitive {{case may}} be found in <b>inclusio</b> - that is, between the main noun’s article and the noun itself.|$|E
5000|$|Particularly {{noteworthy}} are {{the many}} instances of <b>inclusio</b> in the Book of Jeremiah. A rather far-flung example of <b>inclusio</b> in the Book of Jeremiah {{can be found}} in its first section, chapters 1-24, which are enveloped both by a similar question in the first and last episode (1:11, 24:3), and by similar imagery—that of almond rods and baskets of figs. <b>Inclusio</b> may also be found between chapters 36 and 45, both of which mention Baruch ben Nerya, to whom Jeremiah's prophecies were entrusted. Bracketing can also be seen in The Lord's sayings in 1:10 and 24:6. Indeed, the whole book save for its last (52nd) chapter—which some claim was appended to it—can be thought of as inside the <b>inclusio</b> formed by 1:1 and 51:64, both of which mention the preaching of Jeremiah (דברי ירמיה), thus implying the lateness of chapter 52; although analyzing whether so trivial a measure has any meaning but that which appeases the eye is best left to the astute reader. None of this is to say that the shorter forms of inclusio—those in which the section enframed is quite shorter—are not found in the Book of Jeremiah. An example is found in Jeremiah 4:22, which reads: ...|$|E
5000|$|The New Testament {{also uses}} <b>inclusio.</b> The main {{teaching}} {{part in the}} Sermon on the Mount starts and ends with the expression “the Law and the Prophets” (Matthew 5:17 + 7:12). Matthew’s account of {{the first part of}} Jesus’ public ministry is framed by an account on his teaching and his miracles (Matthew 4:23 +9:35).Also, Matthew’s Gospel begins with the prophecy that Jesus' name would be “Emmanuel, that is, ‘God with us,’” (1:23, in which the author has linked Isaiah 7:14 and 8:8, 10 together) and it ends with the promise, [...] "I am with you always, {{to the end of the}} age". This forms an <b>inclusio</b> about Jesus in his relationship to his people that suggests his deity. The letter to the Hebrews uses Jeremiah’s prophecy as an <b>inclusio</b> in 8:8-12 and 10:16-18.There are many more examples of this literary device in the New Testament.|$|E
50|$|Examples of <b>inclusio</b> may {{be found}} in later rabbinic {{literature}} as well. Tosefta Makkot Chapter 3 opens and closes with statements regarding the designation of three cities of refuge. Homilies regarding Isaiah 32:20 appear {{at the beginning and end}} of BT Bava Kamma Chapter 1. The opening homily of Leviticus Rabba 29 asserts that the fate of Adam on the day of his creation is a sign for his children annually on the same date, and the closing homily of this section asserts that when Israel observes the commandments of this day God will regard them as having been created anew. Rabbinic redactors, following in the footsteps of their biblical predecessors, continued to employ <b>inclusio</b> as a literary marker and tool.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{chapters}} of Mishnah are also framed by <b>inclusio.</b> In the opening mishnah of Taanit Chapter 1, R. Joshua notes that {{rain on the}} festival of Sukkot is [...] "not a sign of blessing", and the closing mishnah of the chapter notes that rainfall after the month of Nisan is [...] "a sign of curse". This characterization of rainfall as God's way of communicating His blessings and curses is a central theme of the chapter. Sometimes the <b>inclusio</b> {{is based on a}} wordplay. Ohalot Chapter 7 opens with a discussion of corpse impurity in a [...] "נפש אטומה" [...] ('solid monument')and closes with the statement that a baby whose head has emerged from the womb may not be killed to save the mother because [...] "אין דוחין נפש מפני נפש" [...] ('one soul may not be set aside in favor of another'). The use of the word נפש (nefesh) at {{the beginning and the end}} of the chapter in opposite meanings, symbolizing respectively death and life, emphasize the interconnection between the mysteries of birth and of death.|$|E
50|$|While {{this may}} not be evident to many of the Bible's modern day readers, the Hebrew Bible is full of {{literary}} devices, some of which, having fallen out of favor over the years, are lost on most modern readers. <b>Inclusio,</b> of which many instances {{can be found in the}} Bible, is one of these, although many instances of its usage are not apparent to those reading translations of the Bible rather than the Hebrew source.|$|E
5000|$|The rabbis of the Talmud {{were aware}} of occurrences of <b>inclusio</b> in the Bible, as shown by R. Yohanan's comment in the Babylonian Talmud, Berakhot 10a that [...] "Any psalm dear to David he opened with [...] "אשרי" [...] ('happy is he') and closed with [...] "אשרי" [...] ('happy is he'). Redactors of rabbinic {{document}} frequently made use of <b>inclusio</b> to mark off the endpoints of literary units of different sizes and possibly to suggest conceptual connections between seemingly disparate statements. At {{the end of the}} Mishnah tractate Kelim, R. Yose explicitly notes the phenomenon: [...] "Happy are you, Kelim, in that you opened with regarding impurity and departed with regarding purity." [...] Tractate Berakhot, which opens with a discussion of the laws of reciting the שמע (Hear O Israel) passage from Deuteronomy 6:4-9, concludes with a homiletic interpretation of the second verse from this passage (v. 5), showing how the ritual recitation of the tractate's opening may serve as a source of spiritual instruction at the tractate's end. Tractate Nazir is framed by allusions to two famous biblical Nazirites - Samson (M. Nazir 1:2) and Samuel (M. Nazir 9:5), representing respectively negative and positive exemplars of this institution.|$|E
5000|$|This legal {{principle}} is classically {{referred to as}} <b>inclusio</b> unius est exclusio alterius (Inclusion of one is to exclude the others). The idea {{is that if the}} promulgator of law finds reason to enumerate one exception, then it is only reasonable to infer no others were intended. The Ninth Amendment of the United States Constitution was enacted to explicitly suppress this principle by stating that [...] "The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people." ...|$|E

5000|$|Old Testament and Pentateuch scholar Gordon Wenham {{supports}} a schematic interpretation of Genesis 1 {{in his two}} volume, scholarly commentary on Genesis. It has been unfortunate that one device which our narrative uses to express the coherence and purposiveness of the creator's work, namely, {{the distribution of the}} various creative acts to six days, has been seized on and interpreted over-literalistically… The six day schema is but one of several means employed in this chapter to stress the system and order that has been built into creation. Other devices include the use of repeating formulae, the tendency to group words and phrases into tens and sevens, literary techniques such as chiasm and <b>inclusio,</b> the arrangement of creative acts into matching groups, and so on. If these hints were not sufficient to indicate the schematization of the six-day creation story, the very content of the narrative points in the same direction. Gordon Wenham ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{court upheld}} that, {{although}} {{the display of}} a knife in a window might at first appear to [...] "lay people" [...] to be an offer inviting people to buy it, {{and that it would}} be [...] "nonsense to say that it was not offering it for sale", whether an item is offered for the purpose of the statute in question must be construed in the context of the general law of the country. He stated that the general law of the country clearly established that merely displaying an item constituted an invitation to treat. He also read the statute on an exclusive construction (<b>inclusio</b> unius est exclusio alterius), noting that other legislation prohibiting the sale of weapons referred to [...] "offering or exposing for sale" [...] (emphasis added). The lack of the words exposing for sale in the Restriction of Offensive Weapons Act 1959 suggested that only a true offer would be prohibited by the Act. The court dismissed the appeal. Goods displayed in a shop are merely an invitation to treat or invitation to trade.|$|E
