25|$|Average load factor, {{in transit}} systems, is {{the ratio of}} the total number of riders to the total {{theoretical}} capacity. A transit vehicle running at full capacity has a 100% load factor, while an <b>empty</b> <b>vehicle</b> has 0% load factor. If a transit vehicle spends half the time running at 100% and half the time running at 0%, the average load factor is 50%. Higher average load factor corresponds to lower energy consumption per passenger, so designers attempt to maximize this metric.|$|E

40|$|Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) takes {{passenger}} {{parties on}} demand direct to their desired destination. <b>Empty</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{need to be}} moved to stations with waiting passengers or with expected demand. Efficient redistribution of <b>empty</b> <b>vehicles</b> is critical in larger PRT networks where running times are longer than acceptable waiting-times. We have previously developed methods for allocating destinations to <b>empty</b> PRT <b>vehicles</b> sequentially as they become available. In this paper the allocation of <b>empty</b> <b>vehicles</b> is refined into three stages. The first stage is essentially the previous sequential allocation. In {{the second and third}} stage <b>empty</b> <b>vehicles</b> en route are reallocated by switching destinations between each other. In the second stage waiting passengers are allocated the nearest vehicle in order of longest wait. In the third stage remaining <b>empty</b> <b>vehicles</b> en route are reallocated based on minimum running distance. The optimization problem in the third stage corresponds to the transportation problem and it is solved approximately by a heuristic method suggested by Russel. Applied to a network with 25 stations, 16 kilometers of guide-way and 200 vehicles the combined reallocation methods reduced average waiting and the longest wait to about half compared with sequential decisions alone.

50|$|There {{was work}} on flows on networks, through nodes, and {{activity}} location. Orden (1956) had suggested {{the use of}} conservation equations when networks involved intermediate modes; flows from raw material sources through manufacturing plants to market were treated by Beckmann and Marschak (1955) and Goldman (1958) had treated commodity flows and the management of <b>empty</b> <b>vehicles.</b>|$|R
500|$|The first {{witnesses}} to testify were the Gibraltar Police officers {{involved in the}} operation and its aftermath. Following them, on 7 September, was [...] "Mr O", the senior MI5 officer in charge of Operation Flavius. [...] "O" [...] told the inquest that, in January 1988, Belgian authorities found a car being used by IRA operatives in Brussels. In the car were found a quantity of Semtex, detonators, and equipment for a radio detonation device, which, [...] "O" [...] told the coroner, led MI5 {{to the conclusion that}} the IRA might use a similar device for the planned attack in Gibraltar. MI5 further believed that the IRA had been unlikely to use a [...] "blocking car" [...] (an <b>empty</b> <b>vehicle</b> used to hold a parking space until the bombers bring in the vehicle containing the explosives) as this entailed the added risk of multiple border crossings. Finally, [...] "O" [...] told the coroner that McCann, Savage, and Farrell had been observed by Spanish authorities arriving at Málaga Airport, after which he claimed the trio had been lost, and that the British and Gibraltarian authorities did not detect them crossing the border.|$|E
60|$|We {{passed by}} Murnau {{in the valley}} of the Dragon, a little town which possessed a Passion Play of its own in the olden times, and which, until a few years ago, when the railway-line was pushed forward to Partenkirchen, was the nearest station to Ober-Ammergau. It was a tolerably steep climb up the road from Murnau, over Mount Ettal, to Ammergau--so steep, indeed, that one stout pilgrim not many years ago, died from the {{exertion}} while walking up. Sturdy-legged mountaineer and pulpy citizen both had to clamber up side by side, for no horses could do more than drag behind them the <b>empty</b> <b>vehicle.</b>|$|E
60|$|This was {{a quandary}} but, {{bringing}} {{common sense to}} bear on it, evidently {{there was nothing for}} it but put a good face on the matter and foot it which they accordingly did. So, bevelling around by Mullett's and the Signal House which they shortly reached, they proceeded perforce in the direction of Amiens street railway terminus, Mr Bloom being handicapped by the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had, to vary the timehonoured adage, gone the way of all buttons though, entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing, he heroically made light of the mischance. So as neither of them were particularly pressed for time, as it happened, and the temperature refreshing since it cleared up after the recent visitation of Jupiter Pluvius, they dandered along past by where the <b>empty</b> <b>vehicle</b> was waiting without a fare or a jarvey. As it so happened a Dublin United Tramways Company's sandstrewer happened to be returning and the elder man recounted to his companion à propos of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of some little while back. They passed the main entrance of the Great Northern railway station, the starting point for Belfast, where of course all traffic was suspended at that late hour and passing the backdoor of the morgue (a not very enticing locality, not to say gruesome to a degree, more especially at night) ultimately gained the Dock Tavern and in due course turned into Store street, famous for its C division police station. Between this point and the high at present unlit warehouses of Beresford place Stephen thought to think of Ibsen, associated with Baird's the stonecutter's in his mind somehow in Talbot place, first turning on the right, while the other who was acting as his fidus Achates inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of James Rourke's city bakery, situated quite close to where they were, the very palatable odour indeed of our daily bread, of all commodities of the public the primary and most indispensable. Bread, the staff of life, earn your bread, O tell me where is fancy bread, at Rourke's the baker's it is said.|$|E

50|$|Millions {{of empty}} cars spin {{out of control}} and crash, while others swerve off roads and highways. Other {{vehicles}} crash, including buses in Trafalgar Square. All <b>empty</b> <b>vehicles</b> eventually crash, causing accidents all across the globe. The highways are blocked with smashed and burning vehicles. Stationary cars continue to release exhaust fumes into the air until their fuel supplies run out. Cities have begun to cool down by a fraction of a degree. Airplanes crash back to earth.|$|R
50|$|The {{main purpose}} of a freight {{exchange}} is to fill <b>empty</b> <b>vehicles</b> on their return journeys (when they {{are on their way}} back to their depot after a delivery) by matching them to available freight. For example, a trucker has an order to transport tulips from Keukenhof in the Netherlands to Como, Italy. Ideally, a freight order for the return trip would increase profitability, so the trucker would search for return freight or return load on a freight exchange.|$|R

30|$|As a main {{result for}} the city, the {{proposed}} data processing methodology identified {{locations of the}} public transport system with either crowded buses or virtually empty buses. With this information, the city hall can balance the system, reducing supply in places where there are virtually <b>empty</b> <b>vehicles</b> and leading to places where the lines are full. This information can bring economic gains, since the literature shows that a good distribution of the supply in collective transport systems may even lower {{the price of the}} bus ticket [50].|$|R
30|$|Passenger car {{occupancy}} {{has been}} falling for years. Partly <b>empty</b> <b>vehicles</b> on our road networks decrease passenger transport sustainability but also contain {{an opportunity for}} freight transport. Within Crowd logistics (CL), delivery operations are carried out by using passengers’ excess capacity on journeys that are already taking place, resulting in economic, social and environmental benefits. Existing CL initiatives show, however, that there are important differences between concepts in terms of sustainability. The research aims to develop a suitable and comprehensive definition for CL and identify which factors determine the sustainability potential of CL.|$|R
40|$|Personal {{rapid transit}} (PRT) {{is a concept}} in which a fleet of {{automated}} vehicles operate on a network of grade-separated guideways, accessible on-demand at a fixed number of stations. The questions this research addresses include: How can merge-induced congestion be modeled and controlled? How do station configurations influence delay? How large must fleets be to accommodate a given demand profile? How should <b>empty</b> <b>vehicles</b> be dispatched to rebalance inventories at stations? While current literature on PRT tends to rely on simulation, this thesis uses queueing theory as an analytical framework...|$|R

This was a significant improvement over the V-2, which was largely constructed of steel. The altitude records achieved by Viking, for a single-stage rocket, were mostly the result of its light-weight structure.|$|E
50|$|Traffic {{generally}} {{consists of}} grain trains bound to Mexico from Kansas and Nebraska, as well a daily mixed freight train from Belen, {{and an occasional}} <b>empty</b> <b>vehicle</b> train. Five times a week, Monday thru Friday, the Rincon Local traverses the line from Rincon to Belen and back again, stopping in Socorro {{to pick up and}} set out cars.|$|E
50|$|Key to the {{efficient}} operation of any PRT {{system is the}} queuing of free vehicles throughout the stations on the system. Increasing the number of idle vehicles reduces the passenger wait times, as well as reducing the need to move <b>empty</b> <b>vehicles</b> through the system in order to pick up passengers. However, this also requires additional vehicles, thereby increasing capital costs. Communications between the centralized computer and the station computers allowed cars to be switched from station to station {{in order to keep}} the stations supplied with free vehicles.|$|R
30|$|As {{a result}} of the above {{developments}} we gradually see the emergence of Internet-based communities of interests and electronic auction mechanisms. The virtual market places that implement freight exchanges offer carriers the perspective of an easier access to loads and smoother operations. This is certainly true for full-load carriers, but it also presents significant opportunities for consolidation-type companies, LTL motor carriers in particular. The loads that could be obtained by accessing these markets would reduce the need to move <b>empty</b> <b>vehicles</b> to balance the operations. Such markets complement the more traditional auctions of distribution routes of major industrial or retail firms [13].|$|R
40|$|As urban living {{environment}} {{is becoming more}} and more complex, the road condition is becoming worse because of heavy traffic, increase of traffic accidents and high ratio of <b>empty</b> <b>vehicles.</b> It increases the cost of transportation and wastes time of vehicle movement. To solve such problems, a land vehicle tracking system has been developed. A land vehicle tracking system determines the position of land rover with a terminal with embedded GPS receiver or PCS phone and displays the position on a digital map. Recently, vehicle tracking technologies have brought some breakthrough in these areas: commercial vehicle operations, fleet management, dispatching, emergency rescue, hazard material monitoring, and security...|$|R
50|$|One way to {{increase}} the mass ratio {{is to reduce the}} mass of the <b>empty</b> <b>vehicle</b> by using very lightweight structures and high-efficiency engines. This tends to push up maintenance costs as component reliability can be impaired, and makes reuse more expensive to achieve. The margins are so small with this approach that there is uncertainty whether such a vehicle would be able to carry any payload into orbit.|$|E
50|$|Average load factor, {{in transit}} systems, is {{the ratio of}} the total number of riders to the total {{theoretical}} capacity. A transit vehicle running at full capacity has a 100% load factor, while an <b>empty</b> <b>vehicle</b> has 0% load factor. If a transit vehicle spends half the time running at 100% and half the time running at 0%, the average load factor is 50%. Higher average load factor corresponds to lower energy consumption per passenger, so designers attempt to maximize this metric.|$|E

40|$|Even with {{travelling}} speeds below 200 km/h, typical {{features of}} freight trains, {{such as the}} poor aerodynamic performances due to wide and squared surfaces or the presence of <b>empty</b> <b>vehicles</b> alternate to loaded ones, can remarkably worsen the effects of interaction with wind.

Aerodynamic coefficients on both the flat-wagon and the container are measured by means of wind tunnel tests on scaled models. A mathematical model of a single freight wagon is then used to investigate the interaction between the wagon and the turbulent wind and finally determine the Characteristics Wind Curves for the most critical train-set compositions...|$|R

In order to keep the length of the paper within reasonable limits, we focus on long-haul, intercity, freight transportation. Optimization-based operations research methodologies are privileged. The paper starts with an overview of freight transportation systems and planning issues and continues with models which attempt to analyze multimodal, multicommodity transportation systems at the regional, national or global level. We then review location and network design formulations which are often associated with the long-term evolution of transportation systems and also appear prominently when service design issues are considered as described later on. Operational models and methods, particularly those aimed at the allocation and repositioning of resources such as <b>empty</b> <b>vehicles,</b> are then described [...] . ...|$|R
