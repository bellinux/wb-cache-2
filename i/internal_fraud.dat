40|$|Using 629 {{observations}} of U. S. publicly listed firms with <b>internal</b> control related <b>frauds</b> from 2000 to 2006; this study investigates {{the change in}} auditor litigations in the Post- Sarbanes Oxley, Section 404 period. To the extent {{the conditions of the}} internal control in place are inadequate or non-existent, the possibility of the occurrence of <b>internal</b> control related <b>fraud</b> heightens. Thus, the inability of auditors to detect a financial statement misstatement due to <b>internal</b> control <b>fraud</b> in a timely manner exposes auditors to litigation (Barra, 2010; Heninger, 2001; Caplan, 1999). This situation was prevalent in the recent notable corporate failures that resulted in auditors being named as potential defendants. The present research finding indicates during the Post-SOX 404 period, the probability of auditor litigation due to <b>internal</b> control <b>fraud</b> increases. However, no support was shown for further increases in the likelihood of auditor litigation when both types of fraud occur in the Post-SOX 404 period. These results suggest an increase in the enforcement of accountability by the SEC, and should motivate auditors towards reassessing their audit procedures. Furthermore, the results indicate the probability of auditor litigation due to <b>internal</b> control <b>fraud</b> decreases for accelerated filers, and similarly, the probability of auditor litigation decreases for firms with management voluntary disclosures reflecting effective internal control. The overall result of this study indicates the likelihood of auditors being litigated increased in the Post-SOX 404 period, and auditors {{are more likely to be}} litigated when both types of fraud occurs simultaneously. This result further supports the argument for meritorious claims and the procedural justice theory...|$|R

40|$|The {{handling}} of external operational loss data by individual banks {{is one of}} the longstanding problems in risk management theory and practice. The extant literature has not provided a method to identify the best way to combine internal and external operational loss data to calculate operational risk capital. Hence, to improve the knowledge and understanding of internal-external data combination in operational risk management, this study applied a simulation-based evaluation of well-known data combination techniques such as the scaling, the Bayesian, and the covariate-base techniques. This research considered operational losses arising from <b>internal</b> <b>fraud</b> in retail banking within a group of international banks that share data through an operational loss data exchange. One of the key elements of the simulation-based statistical evaluation was the development of a dynamic <b>internal</b> <b>fraud</b> model for operational losses in retail banking. The <b>internal</b> <b>fraud</b> model incorporated human factors such as the number of employees per branch and the ethical quality of workers. It also included the extent of risk controls set by bank managers. There were two sets of findings. First, according to the simulation-based evaluation, the scaling technique was by far the less useful for estimating the appropriate operational risk capital. The Bayesian and the covariate-based techniques performed best. The Bayesian technique was the best for higher percentiles while the covariate-based technique was the best at not so extreme quantiles. The choice of technique therefore depends on the risk appetite of the financial institution. The second set of findings relates to the model validation with hard data. Losses generated by the model in the banks across the world were associated with GDP growth and the corruption perception of the country where banks were located. In general, <b>internal</b> <b>fraud</b> losses are pro-cyclical and the corruption perception in a country positively affects the occurrence of <b>internal</b> <b>fraud</b> losses. When a country is perceived as more corrupt, retail banking in that country will feature more severe <b>internal</b> <b>fraud</b> losses.
