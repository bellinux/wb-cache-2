50|$|Farmland is a {{documentary}} film about {{agriculture in the}} United States that {{was funded by the}} U.S. <b>Farmers</b> <b>and</b> Ranchers Alliance.

40|$|Presentation made at Latinos in the Heartland (11 th : 2013 : Columbia, Mo.) and {{published}} in the annual conference proceedings. According to the U. S. Census of Agriculture, 25 % of Missouri Latino <b>farmers</b> <b>and</b> rancher stopped farming and ranching operations from 2002 to 2007, even though the population of Latinos was increasing across the state. One possibility was that Latino <b>farmers</b> <b>and</b> ranchers were not effectively accessing USDA support programs. In order to better understand this dramatic {{decline in the number}} of Latino <b>farmers</b> <b>and</b> ranchers and to identify ways to improve access and use of USDA programs by Latino <b>farmers</b> <b>and</b> ranchers, 30 <b>farmers</b> <b>and</b> ranchers and five USDA agents were interviewed in southwest, Missouri. Factors such as cultural influence, English communication, insufficient network connections, poor business literacy and a lack of technical knowledge on farming and ranching, constrained the <b>farmers</b> <b>and</b> ranchers from maintaining a productive and sustainable relationship with the USDA. These factors were mentioned by all of the individuals interviewed. In addition, they agreed that one of the main challenges is to create a communication bridge that begins to explore <b>and</b> analyze Latino <b>farmers</b> <b>and</b> ranchers qualifications for access and use of USDA programs. This bridge may facilitate a better understanding of the need for Latino <b>farmers</b> <b>and</b> ranchers to access and use USDA programs, as well as improve their understanding of programs and services offered by the USDA. Improving relationships between Latino <b>farmers</b> <b>and</b> ranchers and USDA resource agencies can assist these producers with establishing and growing their enterprises, as well as influence the Latino <b>farmers</b> <b>and</b> ranchers socioeconomic integration into the broader community...|$|R

5|$|A <b>farmer</b> <b>and</b> his {{son were}} {{ploughing}} a {{field on the}} Isle of Mull using a team of four horses beside Loch Freisa, but work stalled {{after one of the}} horses lost a shoe and was unable to continue. Noticing a horse grazing nearby they decided to try using it as a replacement. Once harnessed to the wooden plough the horse appeared to be familiar with the task, and initially worked steadily. As it began to work towards an area closest to the loch, it became restless and the farmer gently used a whip to encourage the animal to continue. It reacted by immediately transforming into a gigantic boobrie, giving out a loud bellow and diving into the loch, pulling the plough and the other three horses with it. The frightened <b>farmer</b> <b>and</b> his son watched as the creature swam to the centre of the loch then dived underwater, taking the other horses and plough with it. Seven hours later there was still no sign of the three horses.|$|E

Also, rather than setting character classes and manually controlling all of the characters in the group, the player controls their overall tactics and weapons and magic usage, which direct their character growth.|$|E
