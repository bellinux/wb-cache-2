Engine tests were run at 5, 10, and 15 MPa operating pressure over a range of operating speeds. Tests were run both with hot rings and without to provide a baseline for comparison. Minimum data to assess the potential of both the hot rings and high temperature low friction coating was obtained.

This results in a “Tjaden thickness loss ” that corresponds to the measured response. Finally, in 1974 [...] . 1978, Bertram rediscovered and expanded Tjaden’s theory, and also discovered the effect in reproduction of the anisotropic reversible permeability (different in the directions “down the length ” and “thru the depth ” of the medium).

40|$|Abstract: A seven-degrees-of-freedom full {{vehicle model}} {{is used to}} design a robust {{controller}} and to investi-gate the performance of active suspensions without losing the suspension working space. Zero reference for vehicle body displacement finishes suspension working distance. Thus, a new approach is suggested in this paper. Force actuators are placed parallel to the suspensions and non-chattering sliding mode control is ap-plied. Since any change in vehicle parameters because of different load or road conditions adversely affects {{the performance of the}} ordinary control methods, a robust control method is preferred. To obtain the desired improvement in ride comfort, we aim to decrease the magnitudes of the body vibrations and their accelera-tions. We present body bounce, pitch and roll motions of the vehicle with the conventional approach and the proposed approach without suspension <b>gap</b> <b>loss,</b> both in the time domain in the case of traveling over a step road profile and in the frequency domain.

We also propose a position-based multipath routing protocol in order to efficiently construct rope-ladders in wireless networks. By design, the paths which are constructed by our protocol are closely together which allows to quickly switch {{back and forth between}} them in cases of node or link failures. Hence, the size of <b>loss</b> <b>gaps</b> (i. e. the number of consecutively lost packets) can be minimized. Previous works mostly confine themselves to overall packet loss comparisons. However, the <b>loss</b> <b>gap</b> size is crucial to ensure high quality for gap-sensitive traffic like voice flows.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the various methods of obtaining {{sensitivity}} derivatives are explored {{in order to}} highlight the significant contributors of uncertainty, and the adjoint approach is shown {{to be the most}} efficient. The implementation of the adjoint method into the NRC Advanced Gas REactor Evaluator (AGREE) code is performed. Additionally, a method for obtaining an approximation that has a leading error term of third order is derived by calculating both forward and adjoint sensitivities. The approximation is demonstrated to be accurate locally. A method for combining these surrogates is demonstrated using the DAKOTA code. The utility of the method is demonstrated by performing three different analyses related to the High Temperature Test Reactor (HTTR) in Japan. First, the bypass flow experiment of Kaburaki and Takizuka is analyzed to inspect the sensitivity and variability of the bypass flow with respect to the cross-flow <b>gap</b> geometry, <b>loss</b> coefficient and boundary conditions.

40|$|The perceptual {{quality of}} VoIP conversations depends tightly on {{the pattern of}} packet losses, i. e., the {{distribution}} and duration of packet loss runs. The wider (resp. smaller) the inter-loss <b>gap</b> (resp. <b>loss</b> <b>gap)</b> duration, the lower is the quality degradation. Moreover, a set of speech sequences impaired using an identical packet loss pattern results in a different degree of perceptual quality degradation because dropped voice packets have unequal impact on the perceived quality. Therefore, we consider the voicing feature of speech wave included in lost packets in addition to packet loss pattern to estimate speech quality scores. We distinguish between voiced, unvoiced, and silence packets. This enables to achieve better correlation and accuracy between human-based subjective and machine-calculated objective scores. This paper proposes novel no-reference parametric speech quality estimate models which account for the voicing feature of signal wave included in missing packets. Precisely, we develop separate speech quality estimate models, which capture the perceptual effect of removed voiced or unvoiced packets, using elaborated simple and multiple regression analyses. A new speech quality estimate model, which mixes voiced and unvoiced quality scores to compute the overall speech quality score {{at the end of}} an assessment interval, is developed following a rigorous multiple linear regression analysis.

40|$|New {{expressions}} {{are derived}} for photoemission, which allow experimental electron energy loss {{data to be}} used for estimating losses in photoemission. The derivation builds on new results for dielectric response and mean free paths of strongly correlated systems of two dimensional layers. Numerical evaluations are made for $Bi_{ 2 }Sr_{ 2 }CaCu_{ 2 }O_{ 8 }$ (Bi 2212) by using a parametrized loss function. The mean free path for Bi 2212 is calculated and found to be substantially larger than obtained by Norman et al in a recent paper. The photocurrent is expressed as the convolution of the intrinsic approximation for the current from a specific 2 D layer with an effective loss function. The observed current is the sum of such currents from the first few layers. The photo electron from a specific $CuO$ layer is found to excite low energy acoustic plasmon modes due to the coupling between the $CuO$ layers. These modes give rise to an asymmetric power law broadening of the photo current an isolated two dimensional layer would have given. We define an asymmetry index where a contribution from a Luttinger lineshape is additive to the contribution from our broadening function. Already the loss effect considered here gives broadening comparable to what is observed experimentally.
