40|$|The book {{deals with}} a {{stochastic}} formulation of path integration in real time, by rotating the_space_ variables over exp(i pi/ 4). Preliminary chapters deal with quantum and classical mechanics, probability theory and stochastic calculus, and the conventional approach to path integration through the Trotter product formula. Subsequently, the stochastic formulation in complex space is established, and applied to semi-classical expansions, nonlinear oscillations, quantum dynamics on analytic manifolds, dissipative systems (i. e., those which are open in that they interact with an environment), tunneling, field theory, and computer simulations.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{complex-valued}} resonance spectrum of a dc-SQUID coupled to a flux qubit, where {{the former is}} treated in the cubic and the latter in the two-level approximation. It is shown that this spectrum is well-defined and contains most of the relevant information on the escape process. Thus, the language of resonance states is precise and well-adapted to switching- (or trigger-) type qubit readout, and a worthwhile complement to the various descriptions of continuous qubit measurement. Initial progress is analytic, but nonperturbative numerical methods have been formulated and should soon yield accurate results for all parameter values.

The observables and initial states (Zeno subspace) for which the effect occurs depend on the squeezing parameters of the bath. We show these_quantum Zeno dynamics_ to be substantially different for selective and non-selective measurements. In either case, the approach to the Zeno limit for a finite number of measurements is also studied numerically. The calculation is extended from one to two qubits, where we see both Zeno and anti-Zeno effects depending on the initial state. The reason for the striking differences with the situation in closed systems is discussed. Comment: REVTeX 4 - 1, 13 pages, 5 jpeg figures (compile with PDFLaTeX); N.

40|$|Galvanic {{coupling}} of small-area (three-junction) flux qubits, using shared large Josephson junctions, {{has been}} shown to yield appreciable interaction strengths in a flexible design, which does not compromise the junctions' intrinsic good coherence properties. For an introduction, I recapitulate an elementary derivation of the coupling strength, which is subsequently generalized to the case of tunable coupling for a current-biased shared junction. While the ability to vary coupling constants by, say, 20 % would be useful in experiments, sign-tunability (implying switchability) is highly preferable for several quantum-computing paradigms. This note sketches two ideas: a "crossbar" design with competing ferro- and antiferromagnetic current-biased tunable couplings, and a "mediated" one involving an extra loop between the qubits. The latter is a variation on proposals for tunable capacitive coupling of charge qubits, and tunable inductive coupling of large-area flux qubits.

40|$|For {{suitable}} parameters, {{the classical}} Duffing oscillator has a known bistability in its stationary states, with low- and high-amplitude branches. As {{expected from the}} analogy with a particle in a double-well potential, transitions between these states become possible either at finite temperature, or in the quantum regime due to tunneling. In this analogy, besides local stability, one can also discuss global stability by comparing the two potential minima. For the Duffing oscillator, the stationary states emerge dynamically so that a priori, a potential-minimum criterion for them does not exist. However, global stability is still relevant, and definable as the state containing the majority population for long times, low temperature, {{and close to the}} classical limit. Further, the crossover point is the parameter value at which global stability abruptly changes from one state to the other. For the double-well model, the crossover point is defined by potential-minimum degeneracy. Given that this analogy is so effective in other respects, it is thus striking that for the Duffing oscillator, the crossover point turns out to be non-unique. Rather, none of the three aforementioned limits commute with each other, and the limiting behaviour depends on the order in which they are taken. More generally, as both ħ 0 and T 0, the ratio ħω_ 0 /k_BT continues to be a key parameter and can have any nonnegative value. This points to an apparent conceptual difference between equilibrium and nonequilibrium tunneling. We present numerical evidence by studying the pertinent quantum master equation in the photon-number basis. Independent verification and some further understanding are obtained using a semi-analytical approach in the coherent-state representation. Comment: 12 pages incl. figures; N. B.
