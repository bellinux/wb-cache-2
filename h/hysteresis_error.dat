40|$|Copyright © IEEEDOI: [URL] {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) compatible force sensors are important components in medical robotics, as they enable force feedback in a challenging environment for surgical and assistive robots. This paper analyzes a novel MRI compatible force sensor comprised of a displacement amplifying compliant mechanism (DACM) {{made up of}} polymers. Hysteresis is an inevitable problem for sensors made up of polymers, which reduces the precision in measurements. Displacement amplification affects both the sensitivity and <b>hysteresis</b> <b>error</b> of a sensor, yet does not ensure an improvement in either of them. Optimization methods based solely on amplification ratio or sensitivity may be ineffective on reducing the hysteresis issue and result in a design with insufficient signal-to-noise ratio. Unlike previous works that are focused on optimizing topologies with regard to a specific objective function; this paper presents an analysis that accounts for both sensitivity and hysteresis. An iterative method capable of performing nonlinear analysis is established in order to monitor sensitivity and <b>hysteresis</b> <b>error</b> of the proposed sensor topology {{and find out how}} those are affected by the amplification. Optimal configurations for sensitivity and precision are deduced and the predictions made by the analysis are confirmed by experiments. This paper indicated that sensitivity of a compliant mechanism could be traded for a lower <b>hysteresis</b> <b>error</b> i. e., higher precision. DACMs could be targeted to achieve a low <b>hysteresis</b> <b>error</b> rather than improving the sensitivity in a sensor. Compared to a nonamplifying, basis structure of our proposed design achieved a 3 - 4 times higher SNR, mostly due to its higher precision...|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} use of AC machines {{compared to}} DC motors in electrical drive applications has several reasons. A very important advantage of AC machines is their simple construction. However, AC drives often need mechanical sensors (tachometers, position encoders) for field orientation. In many applications these sensors reduce robustness and increase costs of a drive considerably. The objective {{of this paper is}} to present the practical implementation of a sensorless vector control scheme for induction motors using a space phasor based current hysteresis controller. This scheme measures the stator current <b>hysteresis</b> <b>error</b> direction to determine the rotor flux, position, during inverter zero vector states. This measurement of the rotor flux position is done indirectly by sensing the motor back emf, which is orthogonal to the rotor flux position. The basic idea is to measure the current <b>hysteresis</b> <b>error</b> direction of the stator current on the application of an inverter zero vector i. e. "short circuit at machine terminals". A generalization is possible by a combination of two (different) active states of the inverter. By a linear transformation of the electrical equations for both inverter states, a mathematical zero state is constructed. The use of this virtual short circuit is necessary at higher speeds when the inverter output voltage is fully utilized. However at low speeds the drop across the stator resistance is comparable to the motor hack emf, to overcome this a simple parameter adaptation scheme is also presented here. The proposed scheme enables a smooth transition to six-step mode of operation...|$|E

40|$|As a {{continuation}} of Part I this paper is devoted to fluxgate sensors that employ Fe 77. 5 Si 7. 5 B 15 amorphous wires as magnetic cores, with attention being paid to fluxgate miniaturization. Two types of fluxgate sensors have been constructed. The first type {{is based on the}} high axial anisotropy exhibited by amorphous wires and employs two coils, an excitation and a receiving one. The second type employs the large Matteucci effect, owed to helical anisotropy induced into such wires either by mounting under torsion or by torsion annealing. The latter fluxgate type employs one single excitation coil. The exploitation of the Matteucci effect indicates that it may lead to the construction of miniature fluxgate sensors. The voltage-output of a series of such sensors has been sampled and processed. The repeatability of the flux-reversal process in the presence of helical or axial anisotropy is quantitative and qualitative investigated to allow for understanding the nature of noise. The existence of noise-sources that have been modeled in Part I is investigated and their power spectral density is estimated, from the experimental results. The influence of several manufacturing parameters in the noise at the output of fluxgates sensors is experimentally verified. Such parameters are the dimensions of the core, the presence and thickness of the glass-cover in glass-covered wires, the level of applied stress and torsion, working temperature level, and the characteristics of the excitation waveform. An irregular behavior at the hysteresis loop of fluxgates that employ the Matteucci effect is observed, which could be understood as a kind of perming effect. Measurements of the repeatability and <b>hysteresis</b> <b>errors,</b> of the sensors transfer function (output-voltage vs input-field), are presented, along with measurements of the cross-field sensitivity.
