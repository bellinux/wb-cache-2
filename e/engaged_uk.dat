40|$|This article traces British policy discussions {{over their}} {{position}} in Latin America between 1959 and 1963. In particular, it looks at the way British officials interacted with the John F. Kennedy administration's flagship Alliance for Progress and examines the reasons behind the gradual support for a more <b>engaged</b> <b>UK</b> policy toward the area. This decision, it argues, came about due to {{a complex set of}} reasons that challenge the idea that the Anglo-American relationship determined British policy during the cold war. Both the cold war and Anglo-American relations were important in shaping British thinking, but so, too, were calculations over British economic interests. Indeed, as the article demonstrates, it was the interplay of these three elements that shaped British deliberations...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} {{the determinants of}} SME exporting performance using a survey of internationally <b>engaged</b> <b>UK</b> SMEs. We first develop a model incorporating organisational and prior managerial learning effects. Our empirical analysis then allows us to identify separately the positive effects on exporting from the international experience of the firm and {{the negative effects of}} firm age. Positive exporting effects also result from grafted knowledge – acquired by the recruitment of management with prior international experience. Innovation also has positive exporting effects with more radical new-to-the-industry innovation most strongly linked to inter-regional exports; new-to-the-firm innovation is more strongly linked to intra-regional trade. Early internationalisation is also linked positively to the number of countries to which firms export and the intensity of their export activity. We find no evidence, however, relating early internationalisation to extra-regional exporting, suggesting that early-exporting SMEs tend be ‘born regional’ rather than ‘born global’...|$|E

40|$|Background: Many UK {{military}} veterans experiencing {{mental health}} and well-being difficulties do not engage with support services to get the help they need. Some mental health clinics employ Peer Support Workers (PSWs) to help veteran patients engage, however {{it is not known}} how the role influences UK veteran engagement. Aims: To gain insight into the role of peer support in UK veteran engagement with {{mental health and}} well-being services. Method: A qualitative study based on 18 semi-structured interviews with veterans, PSWs and mental health clinicians at a specialist veteran mental health and well-being clinic in Scotland. Results: Four themes of the PSW role as positive first impression, understanding professional friend, helpful and supportive connector, and an open door were identified across all participants. The PSWs’ military connection, social and well-being support and role in providing veterans with an easily accessible route to dis-engage and re-engage with the service over multiple engagement attempts were particularly crucial. Conclusions: The Peer Support role enhanced veteran engagement in the majority of instances. Study findings mirrored existing peer support literature, provided new evidence in relation to <b>engaging</b> <b>UK</b> veterans, and made recommendations for future veteran research and service provision...|$|R

40|$|Since {{the turn}} of the century Britain has seen a {{proliferation}} of Muslim civil society organisations and an increase in the number of points of contact between Muslim spokespersons and government. Yet, this increased participation in UK governance has been a source of fierce controversies centring on the role of conservative male leaderships and the influence of radical Islamic groups. Drawing on interviews with 42 national elites who have <b>engaged</b> in <b>UK</b> Muslim–government relations in the past decade, this article charts the emergence of national-level Muslim representation and assesses its relationship to democratic participation and accountability. Building on the work of Michael Saward, we argue that unelected civil society representatives can act as an important supplement to elected representatives.

30|$|According to Halim and Meerah (2016), science {{teaching}} began in Malaysia in 1937. After {{the independence of}} Malaya in 1957, science education was given {{a special place in}} the educational policy due to several reasons. First, before the independence, Science for all was not possible {{due to the lack of}} adequate equipment and qualified science teachers. Second, Science is considered as an area of the curriculum that most likely to provide the supply of scientific and technical manpower for the economic development of the country. Lee (2004) observed that teachers of low academic qualification were recruited and given part-time training during school holidays at teacher training colleges to ease the acute shortage of school teachers at the primary schools. Meanwhile, the graduate teachers were <b>engaged</b> from <b>UK</b> and India to teach at the secondary schools. In science education, the Scottish Integrated Science Syllabus for lower secondary school, the Nuffield Secondary School Science Curriculum, and the Nuffield O- Level pure Science Syllabus were implemented respectively for non-science and pure science streams at upper secondary level from 1968 to 1981.|$|R

Based on such findings, the experiential avoidance model (Chapman et al. 2006) suggests that DSH is used as a way to disrupt unwanted thoughts, feelings or memories.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis examines how to <b>engage</b> <b>UK</b> based undergraduate students in Sport & Exercise {{in the process of}} becoming information literate in their subject area. The Main Study focused on three groups of students enrolled on a core subject based module. The module in question was delivered via a blended learning approach where part of the delivery was face-to-face and part online via discussion board within the Blackboard Virtual Learning Environment (VLE). Acquiring a rigorous understanding of how to deliver information literacy (IL) required four things to be achieved: an understanding of the field of IL; an appreciation of the information behaviour (IB) processes underpinning IL, an awareness of current theory and practice in the area of teaching and learning and finally, an understanding of current thinking and scholarship in e-learning. In particular the thesis adopted notions of constructivist approaches to learning recommended by Mayes & de Freitas (2004), community of practice (Wenger, 1999), scaffolding (JISC, 2004), and managing online discourse (Goodyear, 2001) to create a workable, theoretically and empirically grounded model for testing. An in depth investigation of methodological theory was carried out in order to devise a robust research strategy to thoroughly test this new model. This strategy has a number of unique characteristics: it uses an IB model (Hepworth, 2004), a cognitive theory of learning (Bloom et al, 1956) and a notion of metacognition defined by Moseley et al (2004) to code and analyse qualitative data. The model was tested in a Pilot Study, substantially modified and then re-tested in a Main Study. The key findings generated from this indicated the importance of task, role and norms in the IL pedagogical process and that the new model for delivering IL teaching and learning via a blended approach engendered higher order thinking in particular analysis, synthesis and evaluation. Data also indicated four discrete levels of information discernment which suggest a possible format for the structuring of an evaluation of information assessment rubric. It is envisaged that this new model has a broader application beyond Higher Education (HE) and Sport & Exercise. Whilst the study has a number of limitations it can be concluded that the research undertaken here provides a significant contribution to the existing body of knowledge in IL, IB, learning and e-learning scholarship. However, it is recognised that any apparent solution is only provisional in a rapidly developing information landscape and, as a consequence, a number of future avenues for research are recommended...|$|R

40|$|Approximately 1400 HIV-positive {{women are}} known to become {{pregnant}} in the UK each year, the overwhelming majority being from Sub-Saharan Africa. The overall question I pose in this thesis is: how do African women living with HIV in the <b>UK</b> <b>engage</b> with HIV services and interventions during and after pregnancy? The question is addressed through a mixed methods approach. Drawing upon epidemiological data from the UK and Ireland's National Study of HIV in Pregnancy and Childhood, and primary ethnographic data, I examine key outcomes (not receiving antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy, detectable maternal HIV viral load at delivery, vertical transmission, late antenatal booking and maternal loss to follow-up from HIV care after pregnancy), as well as exploring women's experiences. Women from Western Africa {{and those who had}} arrived in the UK after conception appeared to be at greater risk of poorer outcomes. Pentecostal beliefs in divine healing, although cited by professionals as a potential barrier to HIV care, did not necessarily prevent women from engaging with HIV services and interventions. Instead, a complex constellation of cultural and structural factors including stigma and lack of UK citizenship rights emerged as a greater challenge to engagement with care. Women described good relationships with their multidisciplinary HIV antenatal teams that fostered confidence in medical systems. On the other hand, some reported negative experiences, particularly with regards to poor maternity care at the time of delivery and difficulties in abstaining from breastfeeding. Overall I found that the majority of African women living with HIV in the <b>UK</b> <b>engage</b> well with HIV services and interventions during and after pregnancy, resulting in low rates of both vertical transmission and loss to follow-up after pregnancy. This highlights women's resilience and determination to engage with HIV care, despite challenges, in order to secure the health of their babies...|$|R

Working from the premise that healthy eating is a ‘principle of perfection’ that citizens are encouraged to strive to achieve, the article traces the vocabularies and logical distinctions of ‘guilt’, ‘purification’ and ‘redemption’ in participants’ accounts of what healthy eating means to them. This analysis reveals some of the complex, situated and often strategic {{ways in which they}} rearticulate and reconfigure the normative imperatives of healthy eating in ways suited to their lived experience and their priorities for health and well-being in older age...|$|R
40|$|Increasingly in {{international}} research and popular media a {{growing interest in}} men and fatherhood is discernible. These changes occur as {{other aspects of the}} socio-economic world shift, necessitating the need to re-address how caring and paid work responsibilities are configured and practised. However, interest in men’s experiences as fathers has emerged in ways which reflect cultural assumptions and practices associated with dominant understandings of masculinities. Consequently, research and evidence of changing behaviours has been culturally and geographically uneven. In this paper, two qualitative studies are drawn upon to examine how men living in Australia and the <b>UK</b> <b>engage</b> in/narrate experiences of preparation for first-time fatherhood. These studies compare men’s in-depth accounts of preparing for first-time fatherhood in cultures where understandings of masculinities overlap, but where differences are also discernible. The findings illuminate the ways in which biology, gender, temporality and histories of masculinities frame men’s preparation activities and service provision...|$|R
