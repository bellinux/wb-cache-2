5|$|Carrie {{had told}} me in an earlier writing {{appointment}} that she was expecting this album to have darker tones than any of her earlier records. So <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>sitting</b> at the piano while writing the song thinking that if Carrie really wanted something dark, this was what she was after. Carrie really got into the story and making sure we didn't give away how the two women {{got rid of the}} man the song is about. This kind of song is really tricky because you need enough detail to tell the story and keep it interesting without it becoming so graphic that it's unpleasant to listen to more than once. I think we managed to pull that off. Either way, it was certainly fun choosing which elements of the story to put in and which ones to leave out.|$|E

Around this time McMahan and Walford began writing together for the band's next record, creating six new songs which the band practiced throughout the summer of 1990. Slint entered River North Records in August 1990 to record Spiderland. At that time there were no vocals or lyrics prepared for the album, so the band wrote them while in the studio. The album's producer, Brian Paulson, {{was known for his}} [...] "live" [...] recording style in the studio, with minimal takes. Paulson recalled [...] "It was weird while I was doing [...] because <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>sitting</b> there, and I just knew there was something about it. I've never heard anything like this.

500|$|An {{enduring}} friendship {{featured in}} EastEnders {{was the one}} shared between the characters Dot Cotton and Ethel Skinner (played by Gretchen Franklin), first shown on-screen in 1985 and ending with Ethel's death in 2000, though the characters shared a backstory set prior to 1985 and were scripted as neighbours who grew old together in East London, along with Lou Beale (Anna Wing). BBC News has described Dot and Ethel as an [...] "incomparable double-act [...] Occasionally spiky and often hilarious". Dot and Ethel shared few similarities in personality. During an episode that aired in 2008, just under 8 years after Ethel died in the serial, Dot discussed the differences between them: [...] "Ethel was a free spirit, not like me. All bottled up. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>sitting</b> on the step of the Vic, waiting for me mother. I {{caught a glimpse of}} her through the door. Sitting on top of the piano, her legs spread, showing next week's washing and bawling out [...] "Roll Out the Barrel". Just like a navvy. She didn't seem to have a care in the world. I had enough for both of us. I loved Ethel." [...] Critic for The Guardian, Nancy Banks-Smith, discussed the characters' relationship in 2008, comparing them to the girls written about by Dylan Thomas: [...] "There was always one pretty and pert , and always one in glasses [...]" [...] Banks-Smith adds that theirs was [...] "a symbiotic relationship in which the pretty one looks even prettier by contrast and the plain one is popular by proxy. Which is not to say it is not a real and enduring friendship." ...|$|E

Hoppus' Finnish paternal great-grandparents, Aaron and Lempi Orrenmaa, emigrated to the U.S. from Laihia. His father, like many in Ridgecrest, worked for the U.S. Department of Defense, designing missiles and bombs for the town's Navy testing center. Hoppus describes himself as [...] "pretty mellow" [...] until his parents divorced when he was eight, which had a [...] "drastic, unsettling effect" [...] on him. [...] "When my parents argued, it was always behind closed doors. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>sitting</b> outside my parents' room when I was seven years old, hearing the dulled voice of anger behind the door.

2500|$|Lifeson {{was born}} as Alexandar Zivojinovich (Aleksandar Živojinović in Serbian) in Fernie, British Columbia, to Serbian immigrants, Nenad and Melanija Živojinović, {{and raised in}} Toronto, Ontario. His stage name of [...] "Lifeson" [...] is a semi-literal {{translation}} of the surname Živojinović, which means [...] "son of life" [...] in Serbian. His first exposure to formal music training {{came in the form}} of the viola, which he renounced for the guitar at the age of 12. His first guitar was a Christmas gift from his father, a six-string Kent classical acoustic which was later upgraded to an electric Japanese model. During his adolescent years, he was influenced primarily by Jimi Hendrix, Pete Townshend, Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page, Steve Hackett, and Allan Holdsworth; he explained in 2011 that [...] "Clapton's solos seemed a little easier and more approachable. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>sitting</b> at my record player and moving the needle back and forth to get the solo in 'Spoonful.' But there was nothing I could do with Hendrix." [...] In 1963 Lifeson met future Rush drummer John Rutsey in school. Both interested in music, they decided to form a band. Lifeson was primarily a self-taught guitarist with the only formal instruction coming from a high school friend in 1971 who taught classical guitar lessons. This training lasted for roughly a year and a half.|$|E

5000|$|Aqualung wasn't {{a concept}} album, {{although}} {{a lot of}} people thought so. The idea came about from a photograph my wife at the time took of a tramp in London. I had feelings of guilt about the homeless, as well as fear and insecurity with people like that who seem a little scary. And I suppose all of that was combined with a slightly romanticized picture of the person who is homeless but yet a free spirit, who either won't or can't join in society's prescribed formats.So from that photograph and those sentiments, I began writing the words to [...] "Aqualung". <b>I</b> can <b>remember</b> <b>sitting</b> in a hotel room in L.A., working out the chord structure for the verses.

6000|$|My {{knowledge}} of Mr. William Morris's poetry begins in years {{so far away}} that they seem like reminiscences of another existence. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>sitting</b> beneath Cardinal Beaton's ruined castle at St. Andrews, looking across the bay to the sunset, while some one repeated [...] "Two Red Roses across the Moon." [...] And I remember thinking that the poem was nonsense. With Mr. Morris's other early verses, [...] "The Defence of Guinevere," [...] this song of {{the moon and the}} roses was published in 1858. Probably the little book won no attention; it is not popular even now. Yet the lyrics remain in memories which forget all but a general impression of the vast [...] "Earthly Paradise," [...] that huge decorative poem, in which slim maidens and green-clad men, and waters wan, and flowering apple trees, and rich palaces are all mingled as on some long ancient tapestry, shaken a little by the wind of death. They are not living and breathing people, these persons of the fables; they are but shadows, beautiful and faint, and their poem is fit reading for sleepy summer afternoons. But the characters in the lyrics in [...] "The Defence of Guinevere" [...] are people of flesh and blood, under their chain armour and their velvet, and the trappings of their tabards.|$|E
6000|$|Like {{the rest}} of us in that country, I was born an angler, though under an evil star, for, indeed, my labours have not been blessed, and are devoted to fishing rather than to the {{catching}} of fish. Remembrance can scarcely recover, [...] "nor time bring back to time," [...] the days when I was not busy at the waterside; yet the feat is not quite beyond the power of Mnemosyne. My first recollection of the sport must date from about the age of four. I recall, in a dim brightness, driving along a road that ran between banks of bracken and mica-veined rocks, and the sunlight on a shining bend of a highland stream, and my father, standing in the shallow water, showing me a huge yellow fish, that gave its last fling or two on the grassy bank. The fish seemed as terrible and dangerous to me as to Tobit, in the Apocrypha, did that ferocious half-pounder which he carries on a string in the early Italian pictures. How oddly Botticelli and his brethren misconceived the man-devouring fish, which must have been a crocodile strayed from the Nile into the waters of the Euphrates! A half- pounder! To have been terrified by a trout seems a bad beginning; and, thereafter, the mist gather's over the past, only to lift again when I see myself, with a crowd of other little children, sent to fish, with crooked pins, for minnows, or [...] "baggies" [...] as we called them, in the Ettrick. If our parents hoped that we would bring home minnows for bait, they were disappointed. The party was under the command of a nursery governess, and probably she was no descendant of the mother of us all, Dame Juliana Berners. We did not catch any minnows, and <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>sitting</b> to watch a bigger boy, who was angling in a shoal of them when a parr came into the shoal, and we had bright visions of alluring that monarch of the deep. But the parr disdained our baits, and for months I dreamed of what it would have been to capture him, and often thought of him in church. In a moment of profane confidence my younger brother once asked me: [...] "What do you do in sermon time? I," [...] said he in a whisper--"mind you don't tell--I tell stories to myself about catching trout." [...] To which I added similar confession, for even so I drove the sermon by, and I have not [...] "told"--till now.|$|E

500|$|Producer Norman Whitfield {{had always}} wanted to work with Paul Buckmaster, the British {{arranger}} and composer. One day he called Buckmaster and invited him to work on some recordings he had finished. After meeting, they decided to contact songwriter Miles Gregory to use one of his songs for Whitfield's record group Rose Royce. Buckmaster found that Gregory was under medication from overuse of drugs and [...] "was in considerable discomfort, if not in outright pain. He didn't write a song and dance about his pain, but <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> him <b>sitting</b> at the piano and wincing. So before jumping on the thing that Miles was merely indulging himself and writing, one has to remember that the guy was in a lot of pain."

Occasionally he would slide to his feet and go to a blackboard on an easel and draw on that very slowly and deliberately in coloured chalks a diagram for the class to copy in coloured pencils, and sometimes he would display a specimen or arrange an experiment for them to see. The room in the Institute in which he taught was equipped with a certain amount of apparatus prescribed as necessary for subject this and subject that by the Science and Art Department, and this my father would supplement with maps and diagrams and drawings of his own.|$|R

I'm very glad for you that these gentle passions have the succulent scene of Munich to pasture in. I haven't been there for long years--was never there but once at all, but haven't forgotten how genial and sympathetic I found it. Drink deep of every impression and have a lot to tell me when the prodigal returns. I love travellers' tales--especially when I love the traveller; therefore have plenty to thrill me and to confirm that passion withal. I travel no further than this, and never shall again; but it serves my lean purposes, or most of them, and I'm thankful {{to be able to do}} so much and to feel even these quiet and wholesome little facts about me. We're having in this rude climate a summer of particularly bad and brutal manners--so far the sweetness of the matter fails; but I get out in the lulls of the tempest (it does nothing but rain and rage,) and when I'm within, my mind still to me a kingdom is, however dismembered and shrunken. I haven't seen a creature to talk of you with--but I see on these terms very few creatures indeed; none worth speaking of, still less worth talking to. Clearly you move still in the human maze--but I like to think of you there; may it be long before you find the clue to the exit. You say nothing of any return to these platitudes, so I suppose you are to be still a good while on the war-path; but when you are ready to smoke the pipe of peace come and ask me for a light. It's good for you to have read Taine's English Lit.; he lacks saturation, lacks waste of acquaintance, but sees with a magnificent objectivity, reacts with an energy to match, expresses with a splendid amplitude, and has just the critical value, I think, of being so off, so far (given such an intellectual reach,) and judging and feeling in so different an air. It's charming to me to hear that The Ambassadors have again engaged and still beguile you; it is probably a very packed production, with a good deal of one thing within another; <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>sitting</b> on it, when I wrote it, with that intending weight and presence with which you probably often sit in these days on your trunk to make the lid close and all your trousers and boots go in. I remember putting in a good deal about Chad and Strether, or Strether and Chad, rather; and am not sure that I quite understand what in that connection you miss--I mean in the way of what could be there. The whole thing is of course, to intensity, a picture of relations--and among them is, though not on the first line, the relation of Strether to Chad. The relation of Chad to Strether is a limited and according to my method only implied and indicated thing, sufficiently there; but Strether's to Chad consists above all in a charmed and yearning and wondering sense, a dimly envious sense, of all Chad's young living and easily-taken other relations; other not only than the one to him, but than the one to Mme de Vionnet and whoever else; this very sense, and the sense of Chad, generally, is a part, a large part, of poor dear Strether's discipline, development, adventure and general history. All of it that is of my subject seems to me given--given by dramatic projection, as all the rest is given: how can you say I do anything so foul and abject as to [...] "state"?

6000|$|America {{has given}} us {{an example of this}} in her {{political}} system; perhaps she will now oblige in her educational. I confess that I look very eagerly and watchfully towards America in many ways. After the war she will be more emphatically than ever, in material things, the most important and powerful nation of the earth. We British have a legitimate and somewhat breathless interest in the use she will make of her strength, {{and in the course of}} her national life, for this will greatly influence the course of our own. But power for real light and leading in America will depend, not so much on her material wealth, or her armed force, as on what the attitude towards life and the ideals of her citizens are going to be. Americans have a certain eagerness for knowledge; they have also, for all their absorption in success, the aspiring eye. They do want the good thing. They don't always know it when they see it, but they want it. These qualities, in combination with material strength, give America her chance. Yet, if she does not set her face against [...] "Gadarening," [...] we are all bound for downhill. If she goes in for spreadeagleism, if her aspirations are towards quantity not quality, we shall all go on being commonised. If she should get that purse-and-power-proud fever which comes from national success, we are all bound for another world flare-up. The burden of proving that democracy can be real and yet live up to an ideal of health and beauty will be on America's shoulders, and on ours. What are we and Americans going to make of our inner life, of our individual habits of thought? What are we going to reverence, and what despise? Do we mean to lead in spirit and in truth, not in mere money and guns? Britain is an old country, still in her prime, I hope; but America is as yet on the threshold. Is she to step out into the sight of the world as a great leader? That is for America the long decision, to be worked out, not so much in her Senate and her Congress, as in her homes and schools. On America, after the war, the destiny of civilisation may hang for the next century. If she mislays, indeed, if she does not improve the power of self-criticism--that special dry American humour which the great Lincoln had--she might soon develop the intolerant provincialism which has so often been the bane of the earth and the undoing of nations. If she gets swelled-head the world will get cold-feet. Above all, if she does not solve the problems of town life, of Capital and Labour, of the distribution of wealth, of national health, and attain to a mastery over inventions and machinery--she is in for a cycle of mere anarchy, disruption, and dictatorships, into which we shall all follow. The motto [...] "noblesse oblige" [...] applies as much to democracy as ever it did to the old-time aristocrat. It applies with terrific vividness to America. Ancestry and Nature have bestowed on her great gifts. Behind her stand Conscience, Enterprise, Independence, and Ability--such were the companions of the first Americans, and are the comrades of American citizens to this day. She has abounding energy, an unequalled spirit of discovery; a vast territory not half developed, and great natural beauty. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>sitting</b> on a bench overlooking the Grand Canyon of Arizona; the sun was shining into it, and a snow-storm was whirling down there. All that most marvellous work of Nature was flooded to the brim with rose and tawny-gold, with white, and wine-dark shadows; the colossal carvings as of huge rock-gods and sacrificial altars, and great beasts, along its sides, were made living by the very mystery of light and darkness, on that violent day of spring--I remember sitting there, and an old gentleman passing close behind, leaning towards me and saying in a sly, gentle voice: [...] "How are you going to tell it to the folks at home?" [...] America has so much that one despairs of telling to the folks at home, so much grand beauty to be to her an inspiration and uplift towards high and free thought and vision. Great poems of Nature she has, wrought in the large, to make of her and keep her a noble people. In our beloved Britain--all told, not half the size of Texas--there is a quiet beauty of a sort which America has not. I walked not long ago from Worthing to the little village of Steyning, in the South Downs. It was such a day as one too seldom gets in England; when the sun was dipping and there came on the cool chalky hills the smile of late afternoon, and across a smooth valley on the rim of the Down one saw a tiny group of trees, one little building, and a stack, against the clear-blue, pale sky--it was like a glimpse of Heaven, so utterly pure in line and colour, so removed, and touching. The tale of loveliness in our land is varied and unending, but it is not in the grand manner. America has the grand manner in her scenery and in her blood, for over there all are the children of adventure and daring, every single white man an emigrant himself or a descendant of one who had the pluck to emigrate. She has already had past-masters in dignity, but she has still to reach as a nation the grand manner in achievement. She knows her own dangers and failings, her qualities and powers; but she cannot realise the intense concern and interest, deep down behind our provoking stolidities, with which we of the old country watch her, feeling that what she does reacts on us above all nations, and will ever react more and more. Underneath surface differences and irritations we English-speaking peoples are fast bound together. May it not be in misery and iron! If America walks upright, so shall we; if she goes bowed under the weight of machines, money, and materialism, we, too, shall creep our ways. We run a long race, we nations; a generation is but a day. But in a day a man may leave the track, and never again recover it! ...|$|E

When we started working on it and it was not being fun, <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>sitting</b> around with my friends at the time, and saying, 'It's just not working and I think that I'm going to leave.'" ...|$|E
5000|$|Musgrave's father, Elmer, was {{a famous}} short-track racer in the Midwest who raced for over 25 years at Soldier Field, O'Hare, Waukegan, and Wilmot, Wisconsin before moving into asphalt late models in the American Speed Association (ASA) and ARCA. [...] "I was really young at the time," [...] Musgrave said. [...] "But <b>I</b> can still <b>remember</b> <b>sitting</b> in the infield at Milwaukee and {{watching}} him race against drivers like Paul Goldsmith. He finally retired so he could help my older brother, Tom, and I get started." [...] He began racing in 1977 at age 22 at Waukegan in a 1967 Ford Galaxy that he inherited from his brother. He immediately rebuilt the car into a 1967 Ford Torino and won the track's {{rookie of the year}} award.. He and his father built a Ford Mustang using some tips from Dick Trickle to race the next season.|$|R
6000|$|... "Just {{after we}} had had this fright from the lion, the moon rose in her fullest splendour, {{throwing}} a robe of silver light over all the earth. I have rarely seen a more beautiful moonrise. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> that <b>sitting</b> in the skerm I could with ease read faint pencil notes in my pocket-book. As soon as the moon was up game began to trek {{down to the water}} just below us. I could, from where I sat, see all sorts of them passing along a little ridge that ran to our right, {{on their way to the}} drinking place. Indeed, one buck--a large eland--came within twenty yards of the skerm, and stood at gaze, staring at it suspiciously, his beautiful head and twisted horns standing out clearly against the sky. I had, I recollect, every mind to have a pull at him on the chance of providing ourselves with a good supply of beef; but remembering that we had but two cartridges left, and the extreme uncertainty of a shot by moonlight, I at length decided to refrain. The eland presently moved on to the water, and a minute or two afterwards there arose a great sound of splashing, followed by the quick fall of galloping hoofs.|$|R

[...] According to Dewey Bond: [...] "We were very nervous because the Byrds {{were sitting in}} the front row watching us. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> David Crosby <b>sitting</b> there and smiling at me...the record company really liked us and we found out later they were ready to sign us." [...] A deal with Columbia was being arranged when John Mascaro was drafted into the Army and Liapis joined the Air Force, effectively bringing about the band's end. [...] Dewey Bond would go on form the band, Asbury Park, and become an endorser for Ludwig Drums, doing clinics and appearances an NAMM conventions, eventually opening Allstar Lighting & Sound located in Orlando, Florida. [...] John Mascaro, after returning from service in Vietnam, started the John Mace Group, and later became an office quality control technician for a medical survey company.
