5|$|At many of {{the early}} crucial battles of the Pacific, for {{instance}} Coral Sea and Midway, battleships were either absent or overshadowed as carriers launched wave after wave of planes into the attack at a range of hundreds of miles. In later battles in the Pacific, battleships primarily performed shore bombardment in support of amphibious landings and provided anti-aircraft defense as escort for the carriers. Even the largest battleships ever constructed, Japan's , which carried a main battery of nine 18-inch (46cm) guns and were designed as a principal strategic weapon, were never <b>given</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> show their potential in the decisive battleship action that figured in Japanese pre-war planning.|$|E

Feldman was originally assigned to pitch out of the bullpen, but with an injury to Homer Bailey, Feldman was <b>given</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> audition for the Reds' rotation. The preparation for the Reds' rotation made Feldman withdraw from Israel's national baseball team during the 2017 World Baseball Classic. On March 20, Feldman was named the Reds' Opening Day starter.

5|$|Replacement {{pilots were}} pushed through an {{abbreviated}} training regimen {{in order to}} meet the short-term needs of the fleet. This led to a sharp decline in the quality of the aviators produced. These inexperienced pilots were fed into front-line units, while the veterans who remained after Midway and the Solomons campaign were forced to share an increased workload as conditions grew more desperate, with few being <b>given</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> rest in rear areas or in the home islands. As a result, Japanese naval air groups as a whole progressively deteriorated during the war while their American adversaries continued to improve.|$|E

5|$|After time expires, the chaser {{is given}} {{two minutes to}} catch the team by {{correctly}} answering {{a new series of}} questions, with each correct answer moving him one space along the board. If the chaser answers incorrectly or passes, the clock is stopped briefly and the team is <b>given</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> answer the question, which they may confirm among themselves before answering. A correct answer pushes the chaser back one space, or moves the team ahead by one if he has not moved on to the gameboard. An incorrect answer provides no movement for the chaser at all. Regardless of the outcome, the clock begins running again and the chaser continues to answer questions. If the chaser runs out of time before catching the team, the team splits the banked money equally, but if he catches them before time expires, the team leaves with no money. During celebrity episodes, if the chaser catches the team before time runs out, the team leaves with $15,000 divided equally.|$|E
5|$|Following several poor performances, Nani criticised Sir Alex Ferguson for {{his lack}} of {{confidence}} in him. Despite this outburst, Nani was <b>given</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> shine and provided an assist for Rooney in the 4–0 league win over Hull City. Soon after this positive display, he put in another good performance in their League Cup semi-final victory over derby rivals Manchester City, revealing a heart-to-heart with Ferguson had resulted in a better display of form. On 31 January 2010, Nani scored the first goal and set up Rooney's 100th career Premier League strike in a 1–3 league victory over Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium. Nani's goal was first thought of as a Manuel Almunia own goal by many sources, but was confirmed as belonging to Nani on 26 March by the Dubious Goals Panel.

5|$|Nolan {{was born}} on 4 January 1818 to Babington and Elizabeth Nolan, in York County, Upper Canada. Following his father's {{dismissal}} from his minor diplomatic post at the British consulate in Milan, Nolan was accepted into the Austrian Inhaber Pioneer School at Tulln, where {{he was known as}} Ludwig by his fellow cadets. His father's desire to see him <b>given</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> enter a prestigious branch of the armed forces meant that Nolan was regularly transferred to other cadet schools {{to learn more about the}} military. Enthusiastic about the cavalry, he was noted as an excellent horseman and student of military theory, as well as history. With the multi-lingual nature of Austro-Hungary, he also studied languages, including Hungarian. Other subjects studied there included fortification, water engineering, mathematics, fencing, swimming and bridge-building. Nolan graduated from the Pioneer School a year early in May 1835, probably following a recommendation from Prince Liechtenstein, and was made a subaltern in the 10th Austrian Hussar regiment.|$|E
5|$|One {{of the key}} {{elements}} in this hearing was Oppenheimer's earliest testimony about George Eltenton's approach to various Los Alamos scientists, a story that Oppenheimer confessed he had fabricated to protect his friend Haakon Chevalier. Unknown to Oppenheimer, both versions were recorded during his interrogations of a decade before. He was surprised {{on the witness stand}} with transcripts of these, which he had not been <b>given</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> review. In fact, Oppenheimer had never told Chevalier that he had finally named him, and the testimony had cost Chevalier his job. Both Chevalier and Eltenton confirmed mentioning that they had a way to get information to the Soviets, Eltenton admitting he said this to Chevalier and Chevalier admitting he mentioned it to Oppenheimer, but both put the matter in terms of gossip and denied any thought or suggestion of treason or thoughts of espionage, either in planning or in deed. Neither was ever convicted of any crime.|$|E

On 1 April over 5,500 police officers were deployed and the following day 2,800, {{at a cost of}} £7.2 million. Officers worked 14-hour shifts.

5|$|The {{original}} idea behind Slackers first occurred in 1990. Along with some friends, Kurt Jellinek and Paul Zacharias {{went to a}} Don Henley concert, and began thinking about owning their own music store. At the time, the two were undergraduate students, and decided to focus their studies on business management and becoming entrepreneurs. Slackers CDs and Games was officially founded in 1993, by Jellinek and Zacharias, in Columbia, Missouri. Jellinek and Zacharias opened the store after graduating from Saint Louis University, using only their own collection of 1,500 music CDs. The name originated from their generation being considered slackers before being <b>given</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> prove otherwise. Although business was slow at first, with the store sometimes only making US$30 in a day, business eventually increased. After 2years {{they were able to}} open a second location in O'Fallon, Illinois. As of 2009, there are 10 locations in the states of Missouri and Illinois, eight of which are in the St. Louis Metropolitan Area, and two of which are in Mid-Missouri.|$|E
5|$|The prequel Birth by Sleep {{introduces}} Terra as {{an apprentice}} Keyblade wielder who trains alongside Aqua and Ventus at the Land of Departure.

Disheartened, Terra is <b>given</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> redeem his failure when dispatched to eliminate an insurgence of dark creatures called the Unversed in neighboring worlds. Periodically, the vagabond Master Xehanort appeals to Terra to channel the power of darkness freely, creating a schism {{between him and his}} friends as they grow troubled by his actions. This eventually leads Terra to clash with Eraqus when he finds his master inexplicably attacking Ventus, which ends with Xehanort vanquishing the weakened Eraqus. Terra, realizing the entire conflict was engineered to stimulate his inner darkness, confronts Xehanort at the Keyblade Graveyard and succumbs to rage, allowing Xehanort to take over his body to prolong his own life. Terra's disembodied mind inhabits his discarded armor and becomes the Lingering Will, which remains in the Keyblade Graveyard after defeating Xehanort. The game's secret ending shows Terra's heart continuing to resist Xehanort, who still possesses his body after losing his memories in a final battle against Aqua.|$|E
5|$|Those {{who served}} in {{government}} had a privileged position in Han society that was just one tier below the nobles (yet some high officials were also ennobled and had fiefs). They could not be arrested for crimes unless permission was granted by the emperor. However, when officials were arrested, they were imprisoned and fettered like commoners. Their punishments in court also had to gain {{the approval of the}} emperor. Officials were not exempt from execution, yet they were often <b>given</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> commit suicide as a dignified alternative. The most senior posts were the Three Excellencies—excluding the Grand Tutor, a post that was irregularly occupied. The individual titles and functions of the Three Excellencies changed from Western to Eastern Han. However, their annual salaries remained at 10,000 dan (石) of grain, largely commuted to payments in coin cash and luxury items like silk. Below them were the Nine Ministers, each of whom headed a major government bureau and earned 2,000 bushels a year. The lowest-paid government employees made Equivalent to 100 bushels annually. It was thought that wealthy officials would be less tempted by bribes. Therefore, {{in the beginning of the}} dynasty, having a total assessed taxable wealth of one hundred thousand coins was a prerequisite for holding office. This was reduced to forty thousand coins in 142 BCE, yet from Emperor Wu's reign onwards this policy was no longer enforced.|$|E
