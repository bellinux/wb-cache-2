5|$|HD 154672 b has an orbital {{eccentricity}} of 0.61, denoting a very elliptical orbit. The planet's discoverers noted that if water {{existed in the}} planet's atmosphere, it might change from a liquid state to a gaseous state as the planet swings closer to its host star, <b>increasing</b> <b>its</b> temperature.|$|E

5|$|Although {{none were}} ever built, several {{derivatives}} of Black Arrow were also proposed, as ways of <b>increasing</b> <b>its</b> payload capacity. One proposal added eight Raven solid rocket motors from the Skylark programme {{to the first}} stage as booster rockets. Another suggestion was to mount the entire rocket atop a Blue Streak missile, while a third proposal involved replacing the Gamma engines with the more powerful Larch.|$|E

5|$|By the 1990s, the {{telescope}} surface was becoming badly corroded. In 2001–2003, {{the telescope}} was resurfaced, <b>increasing</b> <b>its</b> sensitivity at 5GHz {{by a factor}} of five. A holographic profiling technique was used on the surface, meaning that the surface works optimally at wavelengths of 5cm (compared to 18cm on the old surface). A new drive system was installed, which provides a much higher pointing accuracy. The outer track was relaid, and the focal tower was strengthened so that it could support heavier receivers.|$|E
5|$|Captive {{breeding}} {{is another}} method of stabilizing the bog turtles' numbers. The technique involves mating bog turtles indoors in controlled environments, where nutrition and mates are provided. Fred Wustholz and Richard J. Holub {{were the first}} to do this independently, during the 1960s and 1970s. They were interested in educating others about the bog turtle and in <b>increasing</b> <b>its</b> population, and over several years they released many healthy bog turtles into the wild. Various organizations, such as the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, have been permitted to breed bog turtles in captivity.|$|E
5|$|Double Dare 2000 {{introduced}} the Triple Dare Challenge. Available only in round two, this allowed {{a team to}} make their physical challenge more difficult, <b>increasing</b> <b>its</b> value by $100, and putting a bonus prize at stake. Difficulties included reducing the time limit, adding an extra item to the stunt, or increasing the overall difficulty of the stunt. The actual modifier was not revealed unless the team decided to accept the challenge. If the team did not complete the challenge successfully, the money, prize, and control went to their opponents.|$|E

5|$|In the 1950s, two {{additional}} generators {{were added to}} the power station, bringing the total to six. Between 1995 and 2003, the dam's six hydroelectric generators were upgraded, bringing the installed capacity of the power plant from 92 MW to 120 MW and <b>increasing</b> <b>its</b> generation 20%. Each autumn, a generator was taken out of service, upgraded and returned to service by spring of the next year. The sixth and final generator upgrade was completed in May 2003. Among the components principally upgraded were the turbine shafts and runners.|$|E

5|$|Many farmers {{distilled}} their {{corn harvest}} into whiskey, <b>increasing</b> <b>its</b> value while lowering its transportation costs. At that time, whiskey {{was used as}} a form of currency on the frontier. When the federal government imposed an excise tax on whiskey, Western Pennsylvania farmers felt victimized, leading to the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794. Farmers from the region rallied at Braddock's Field and marched on Pittsburgh. The short-lived rebellion was put down, however, when President George Washington sent in militias from several states.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{criminal}} genius Lex Luthor {{plans to}} make a fortune in real estate by buying large amounts of barren desert land, then using a nuclear explosion on a weak point in the San Andreas Fault, sinking California and leaving Luthor's desert as the new West Coast, greatly <b>increasing</b> <b>its</b> value.

5|$|Some {{countries}} are eliminating or reducing climate disrupting subsidies and Belgium, France, and Japan have phased out all subsidies for coal. Germany is reducing its coal subsidy. The subsidy dropped from $5.4billion in 1989 to $2.8billion in 2002, {{and in the}} process Germany lowered its coal use by 46percent. China cut its coal subsidy from $750million in 1993 to $240million in 1995 and more recently has imposed a high-sulfur coal tax.
