40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the effects of pre-exercise <b>ice</b> slurry <b>ingestion</b> and cold water {{immersion}} on submaximal running time in the heat. On three separate occasions, eight males ran to exhaustion at their first ventilatory threshold in the heat (34. 0 + 0. 18 C, 52 + 3 % relative humidity) following one of three 30 min pre-exercise manoeuvres: (1) ice slurry ingestion; (2) cold water immersion; or (3) warm fluid ingestion (control). Running time was longer following cold water immersion (56. 8 + 5. 6 min; P¼ 0. 008) and <b>ice</b> slurry <b>ingestion</b> (52. 7 + 8. 4 min; P¼ 0. 005) compared with control (46. 7 + 7. 2 min), but not significantly different between cold water immersion and <b>ice</b> slurry <b>ingestion</b> (P¼ 0. 335).

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} <b>ice</b> slurry <b>ingestion</b> on thermoregulatory responses and submaximal running time in the heat. Methods: On two separate occasions, in a counterbalanced order, 10 males ingested 7. 5 g·kg- 1 of either ice slurry (- 1 °C) or cold water (4 °C) before running to exhaustion at their first ventilatory threshold in a hot environment (34. 0 °C ± 0. 2 °C, 54. 9 % ± 5. 9 % relative humidity). Rectal and skin temperatures, HR, sweating rate, and ratings of thermal sensation and perceived exertion were measured. Results: Running time was longer (P = 0. 001) after ice slurry (50. 2 ± 8. 5 min) versus cold water (40. 7 ± 7. 2 min) ingestion. Before running, rectal temperature dropped 0. 66 °C ± 0. 14 °C after <b>ice</b> slurry <b>ingestion</b> compared with 0. 25 °C ± 0. 09 °C (P = 0. 001) with cold water and remained lower for the first 30 min of exercise. At exhaustion, however, rectal temperature was higher (P = 0. 001) with ice slurry (39. 36 °C ± 0. 41 °C) versus cold water ingestion (39. 05 °C ± 0. 37 °C). During exercise, mean skin temperature was similar between conditions (P = 0. 992), as was HR (P = 0. 122) and sweat rate (P = 0. 242). After <b>ice</b> slurry <b>ingestion,</b> subjects stored more heat during exercise (100. 10 ± 25. 00 vs 78. 93 ± 20. 52 W·m- 2, P = 0. 005), and mean ratings of thermal sensation (P = 0. 001) and perceived exertion (P = 0. 022) were lower. Conclusions: Compared with cold water, <b>ice</b> slurry <b>ingestion</b> lowered preexercise rectal temperature, increased submaximal endurance running time in the heat (+ 19 % ± 6 %), and allowed rectal temperature to become higher at exhaustion.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of fluid and <b>ice</b> slurry <b>ingestion</b> on the relationship between intragastric temperature and rectal temperature in humans during physical activity. The purpose was to identify a technique to quantify changes in heat stress in situations when temperature probes are not feasible and when time constraints do not allow for a period long enough for an indigestible temperature capsule to reach the lower gastrointestinal tract. Eight moderately trained male runners inserted a rectal probe and ingested a telemetric capsule before randomized, crossover, pre-exercise ingestion of 7. 5 mL x kg- 1 x BM- 1 tepid fluid (22 °C) or ice slurry (- 1 °C). Beverage ingestion was followed by a self-paced endurance running time trial. Average intragastric temperature was significantly lower than average rectal temperature across the run following both fluid (37. 9 +/- 0. 4 °C vs. 38. 4 +/- 0. 2 °C; p= 0. 003) and <b>ice</b> slurry <b>ingestion</b> (37. 2 +/- 0. 9 vs. 38. 3 +/- 0. 2; p= 0. 009). However, a strong relationship was observed between measurements following fluid (r= 0. 89) but not ice slurry (r= 0. 18). The average bias +/- limits of agreement during the run was 0. 46 +/- 0. 50 following fluid and 1. 09 +/- 1. 68 following <b>ice</b> slurry <b>ingestion,</b> which improved to 0. 06 +/- 0. 76 and 0. 65 +/- 1. 42, respectively when analyzed as delta scores.

The {{purpose of the present study}} is therefore to investigate the effects of ice slurry drinks on performance, and physiological and perceptual responses during a Rugby Union-specific intermittent activity in hot conditions. Previous studies have examined the effect of pre-cooling and intermittent-sprint exercise activity (Drust, Cable, & Reilly, 2000; Mitchell, Schiller, Miller, & Dugas, 2001; Price, Boyd & Goosey, 2009), yet, previous research has not shown any significant improvements in peak or mean power, speed or distance covered in single (Marsh & Sleivert, 1999) or repeated (Drust et al., 2000) maximal sprints following pre-cooling (Cheung & Robinson, 2004). Nevertheless, few studies have examined the effect of ice slurry drinks as a pre-cooling method prior to intermittent-sprint exercise (Brade, Dawson, & Wallman, 2012; Duffield, Coutts, McCall, & Burgess, 2013), and no previous research has been conducted examining <b>ice</b> slurry <b>ingestion</b> with a rugby specific intermittent running protocol for 80 minutes, therefore this is an area in need of more research and an area that could potentially change the strategies and methods of physical preparation used prior to a game of Rugby.

40|$|Core engine icing {{has been}} {{recognized}} to affect {{a wide variety of}} engines since the 1990 's. This previously unrecognized form of icing occurs in flights through high altitude convective regions and vicinity of thunderstorms. Engine icing events involve power loss or damage associated to the engine core, namely instabilities such as compressor surge, stall, engine rollback and even combustor flameout events. The effects on compressor performance are significant in understanding the response of the engine to atmospheric <b>ice</b> <b>ingestion.</b> A one-dimensional axisymmetric flow model is used to simulate the continuous phase through the compressor. The steady state operation of dry air is validated with an industrial database. By changing an exit throttle, the point where the dry compressor mass flow rate slowly starts to drop, is predicted. The stage that is the first to locally collapse, causing the remaining stages and eventually the complete compressor failure, is determined. The continuous flow model is then coupled with a Lagrangian model for the discrete phase in a framework that conserves mass, momentum and energy. From numerical simulations of the coupled, continuous-discrete phase flow model, it is observed that a rematching of the stages across the compressor occurs with increasing ice flow rates to accommodate loss of energy to the ice flow. The migration of the operating point towards the stall point at the rear stage eventually causes the compressor to stall. The onset of stall is characterized by initial oscillations followed by a rapid decay of pressures of the last stage with the instability traveling quickly towards the front of the compressor. Effectively, a reduction in the compressor stall margin is observed as the ice flow rate increases. Further, the relevance of factors such as blockage due to discrete particles and break/splash semi-empirical models in the icing physics, are analyzed through parametric studies. Conclusions are drawn that underscore the influence of the assumptions and models in prediction of the flow behavior in the presence of <b>ice</b> <b>ingestion.</b> Smaller ice crystal diameters have a greater influence on the gas flow dynamics in terms of a higher reduction in surge margin. The break empirical model for ice crystals and splash model for the droplets that are used to calculate the secondary particle size upon impact with rotor blades have a significant influence on the gas flow predictions.

40|$|Exercising in hot environments {{results in}} a rise in core body temperature; an effect {{associated}} with impaired performance over a variety of exercise modes and durations. Precooling has become a popular strategy to combat this impairment, as evidence has shown {{it to be an}} effective method for lowering pre-exercise core temperature, increasing heat storage capacity and improving exercise performance in the heat. To date, the majority of precooling manoeuvres have been achieved via external means, such as cold water immersion and the application of cooling garments. However, these methods have been criticized for their lack of practicality for use in major sporting competitions. Recent evidence has shown that internal or endogenous cooling methods, such as drinking cold fluids or ice slurries, are able to lower core temperature and enhance endurance performance in the heat. These methods may be more advantageous than current forms of precooling, as ingesting cold fluids or ice slurries can be easily implemented in the field and provide the additional benefit of hydrating athletes. While the precise mechanisms responsible for these performance enhancements are yet to be fully explained, the effect of <b>ice</b> <b>ingestion</b> on brain temperature, internal thermoreception and sensory responses may be involved.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of ice accretion within commercial high bypass aircraft turbine engines {{has been reported}} under certain atmospheric conditions. Engine anomalies have taken place at high altitudes that {{have been attributed to}} <b>ice</b> crystal <b>ingestion,</b> partially melting, and ice accretion on the compression system components. The result was degraded engine performance, and {{one or more of the}} following: loss of thrust control (roll back), compressor surge or stall, and flameout of the combustor. As ice crystals are ingested into the fan and low pressure compression system, the increase in air temperature causes a portion of the ice crystals to melt. It is hypothesized that this allows the ice-water mixture to cover the metal surfaces of the compressor stationary components which leads to ice accretion through evaporative cooling. Ice accretion causes a blockage which subsequently results in the deterioration in performance of the compressor and engine. The focus of this research is to apply an engine icing computational tool to simulate the flow through a turbofan engine and assess the risk of ice accretion. The tool is comprised of an engine system thermodynamic cycle code, a compressor flow analysis code, and an ice particle melt code that has the capability of determining the rate of sublimation, melting, and evaporation through the compressor flow path, without modeling the actual ice accretion. A commercial turbofan engine which has previously experienced icing events during operation in a high altitude ice crystal environment has been tested in the Propulsion Systems Laboratory (PSL) altitude test facility at NASA Glenn Research Center. The PSL has the capability to produce a continuous ice cloud which are ingested by the engine during operation over a range of altitude conditions.

Rectal temperature {{at the start of}} the time trial was lower for both ICE conditions (~ 36. 7 °C) than both WARM-UP conditions (~ 37. 1 °C) and remained lower during the first part of the trial. Skin temperature and thermal sensation were lower at the start for SC+ICE. Conclusions: The preparation regimen providing the lowest body-heat content and sensation of coolness at the start (SC+ICE) was most beneficial for pacing during the latter stages of the time trial, although overall performance did not differ...|$|R
40|$|Objective The {{formation}} of {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS) contributes to the pathogenesis and progression of several diseases. Polyphenols {{have been shown to}} be beneficial against ROS. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a natural antioxidant ice cream on oxidative stress, vascular function, and physical performance. Methods In this controlled, single-blind, crossover study, 14 healthy individuals were randomized to consume 100 g of either antioxidant ice cream containing dark cocoa powder and hazelnut and green tea extracts or milk chocolate ice cream (control ice cream). Participants were studied at baseline and 2 h after ingesting ice cream. Serum polyphenols, antioxidant status (ferric-reducing ability of plasma [FRAP]), nitric oxide (NOx) bioavailability, markers of oxidative stress (determination of reactive oxygen metabolites [d-ROMs] and hydrogen peroxide [H 2 O 2]), endothelium function (flow-mediated dilation [FMD] and reactive hyperemia index [RHI]), and exercise tolerance (stress test) were assessed, and the double product was measured. Results Serum polyphenols (P < 0. 001), NOx (P < 0. 001), FRAP (P < 0. 005), FMD (P < 0. 001), and RHI (P < 0. 05) increased significantly, oxidative stress decreased (d-Roms, P < 0. 001; H 2 O 2, P < 0. 001), and the double product (P < 0. 001) was improved only after antioxidant <b>ice</b> cream <b>ingestion.</b> No changes were found after control <b>ice</b> cream <b>ingestion.</b> Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that a natural ice cream rich in polyphenols acutely improved vascular function and physical performance in healthy individuals through a reduction in oxidative stres...|$|R
40|$|Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) were sampled in {{contrasting}} habitats: a seasonally ice-covered {{deep ocean}} (Lazarev Sea), ice-free shelves at their northern range (South Georgia) and the Antarctic Peninsula (Bransfield Strait), and shelf and oceanic {{sites in the}} Scotia Sea. Across 92 stations, representing a year-round average, the food volume in krill stomachs comprised 71 +/- 29 % algae, 17 +/- 21 % protozoans, and 12 +/- 25 % metazoans. Fatty acid trophic markers showed that copepods were consistently part of krill diet, not a switch food. In open waters, both diatom and copepod consumption increased with phytoplankton abundance. Under sea <b>ice,</b> <b>ingestion</b> of diatoms became rare, whereas feeding on copepods remained constant. During winter, larvae contained high but variable proportions of diatom markers, whereas in postlarvae the role of copepods increased with krill body length. Overwintering differed according to habitat. Krill from South Georgia had lower lipid stores than those from the Bransfield Strait or Lazarev Sea. Feeding effort was much reduced in Lazarev Sea krill, whereas most individuals from the Bransfield Strait and South Georgia contained phytoplankton and seabed detritus in their stomachs. Their retention of essential body reserves indicates that krill experienced most winter hardship in the Lazarev Sea, followed by South Georgia and then Bransfield Strait. This {{was reflected in the}} delayed development from juveniles to adults in the Lazarev Sea. Circumpolar comparisons of length frequencies suggest that krill growth conditions are more favorable in the southwest Atlantic than in the Lazarev Sea or off East Antarctica because of longer phytoplankton bloom periods and rewarding access to benthic food...|$|E
40|$|Incidents {{of partial}} or total thrust loss due to engine icing at cruise have been {{recorded}} over past several years. These events increase the demand for better understanding of compres-sor dynamics under such conditions. In the present study, physics based compressor blade row model (BRM) is {{used to evaluate the}} effect of booster ice-shed on axial high pressure compressor (HPC) at flight and approach idling conditions (65 %- 82 % Nc). A representative aviation high-bypass turbofan engine HPC is used in this study. Transient behavior of compressor with vary-ing <b>ice</b> <b>ingestion</b> conditions is compared and inter-stage dynam-ics is analyzed. Stage re-matching occurs due to heat exchange between air and ice which dictates the stall inception stage in the compressor. It is found that although T 3 drop is closely related to compressor stall inception, the transient mechanism of ice-shed also plays an important role. Comparisons are made with steady energy balance equation to determine total water content (TWC) at HPC inlet to emphasize the importance of compressor transients. The ice amount, its ingestion duration and rate affect the onset of stall. HPC might sustain through a slower ice-shed while a faster ice-shed can lead to compressor stall with little or no chances of recovery. Understanding this transient behavior and inter-stage dynamics due to ice-shed will help in designing and implementing passive or active stall control mechanisms.

40|$|Abstract Background Endurance {{exercise}} capacity diminishes under hot environmental conditions. Time to exhaustion can {{be increased}} by lowering body temperature prior to exercise (pre-cooling). This systematic literature review synthesizes the current findings {{of the effects of}} pre-cooling on endurance exercise performance, providing guidance for clinical practice and further research. Methods The MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science and SPORTDiscus databases were searched in May 2012 for studies evaluating the effectiveness of pre-cooling to enhance endurance exercise performance in hot environmental conditions (≥ 28 °C). Studies involving participants with increased susceptibility to heat strain, cooling during or between bouts of exercise, and protocols where aerobic endurance was not the principle performance outcome were excluded. Potential publications were assessed by two independent reviewers for inclusion and quality. Means and standard deviations of exercise performance variables were extracted or sought from original authors to enable effect size calculations. Results In all, 13 studies were identified. The majority of studies contained low participant numbers and/or absence of sample size calculations. Six studies used cold water immersion, four crushed <b>ice</b> <b>ingestion</b> and three cooling garments. The remaining study utilized mixed methods. Large heterogeneity in methodological design and exercise protocols was identified. Effect size calculations indicated moderate evidence that cold water immersion effectively improved endurance performance, and limited evidence that ice slurry ingestion improved performance. Cooling garments were ineffective. Most studies failed to document or report adverse events. Low participant numbers in each study limited the statistical power of certain reported trends and lack of blinding could potentially have introduced either participant or researcher bias in some studies. Conclusions Current evidence indicates cold water immersion may be the most effective method of pre-cooling to improve endurance performance in hot conditions, although practicality must be considered. Ice slurry ingestion appears to be the most promising practical alternative. Interestingly, cooling garments appear of limited efficacy, despite their frequent use. Mechanisms behind effective pre-cooling remain uncertain, and optimal protocols have yet to be established. Future research should focus on standardizing exercise performance protocols, recruiting larger participant numbers to enable direct comparisons of effectiveness and practicality for each method, and ensuring potential adverse events are evaluated. </p...|$|E
40|$|The Authors {{report a}} case of a patient {{presenting}} in the Emergency Department (ED) with severe epigastric pain refractory to therapeutic treatment, with onset after forced <b>ice</b> water <b>ingestion</b> caused by joking compression of a soft PET® bottle during drinking. The Angio MR and angiography performed, after exclusion of suspected esophagus rupture and other esophago-gastric diseases, to rule out an ischemic origin of the pain demonstrate a stenosis of the celiac artery resulting from median arcuate ligament narrowing, the so-called Dunbar’s Syndrome. The Dunbar’s Syndrome is uncommon and some aspects such as the vascular etiology of symptoms are still controversial. In this report clinical presentation, differential diagnosis and pathophysiology of this disease are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} if <b>ice</b> slurry <b>ingestion</b> improved self-paced intermittent exercise in the heat. After a familiarisation session, 12 moderately trained males (30. 4 ± 3. 4 year, 1. 8 ± 0. 1 cm, 73. 5 ± 14. 3 kg, inline imageO 2 max 58. 5 ± 8. 1 mL/kg/min) completed two separate 31 min self-paced intermittent protocols on a non-motorised treadmill in 30. 9 ± 0. 9 °C, 41. 1 ± 4. 0 % RH. Thirty minutes prior to exercise, participants consumed either 7. 5 g/kg ice slurry (0. 1 ± 0. 1 °C) (ICE) or 7. 5 g/kg water (23. 4 ± 0. 9 °C) (CONTROL). Despite reductions in Tc (ΔTc: − 0. 51 ± 0. 3 °C, P 0. 05). Mean Tsk, Tb, blood lactate, heart rate and RPE were similar between conditions (P > 0. 05). The findings suggest that lowering Tc prior to self-paced intermittent exercise does not translate into an improved performance...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} experiments {{performed in}} an altitude chamber at the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) {{as the first}} step towards developing altitude scaling laws and procedures that will possibly allow aero-engines to be certified for operation in ice crystal clouds at high altitude by testing in sea level facilities. The principal objective was to test the hypothesis that accretion within a compressor due to <b>ice</b> crystal <b>ingestion</b> occurs when the local ratio of freestream liquid water content (LWC) to total water content (TWC) lies within a critical range at an accretion-susceptible location. If this hypothesis is correct, the local LWC/TWC ratio is the key parameter that must be matched in tests at low and high pressures to match accretions. Experiments were conducted in a small wind tunnel with an axisymmetric test article, consisting of a hemispherical nose attached to a conical afterbody, at a fixed TWC over a range of LWC/TWC ratios at (absolute) pressures of 34. 5 kPa and 69 kPa to test the hypothesis. The LWC/TWC ratio was varied by changing the wet bulb temperature. Accretion steady-state volumes and growth rates measured at the two pressures were compared at conditions which were analytically predicted to produce matched LWC/TWC ratios. Good agreement was achieved in all cases. Accretion growth was greatest for LWC/TWC ratios in the range 10 - 25...|$|R
