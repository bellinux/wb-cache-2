This paper makes a comparison between drilling and <b>helical</b> milling in <b>cutting</b> forces, hole quality and tool wear through a series of experiments.

This {{configuration}} has many individually mounted, self-indexing knives {{that can be}} rotated to a new edge when necessary. Other, older, models have cutter heads that are not cylindrical but instead square. This leaves a significantly larger open region {{below the level of}} the blade edges and creates a larger hazard as hands, etc., can be pulled in further and cut more deeply.|$|E
50|$|A typical reamer {{consists}} {{of a set of}} parallel straight or <b>helical</b> <b>cutting</b> edges along the length of a cylindrical body. Each cutting edge is ground at a slight angle and with a slight undercut below the cutting edge. Reamers must combine both hardness in the cutting edges, for long life, and toughness, so that the tool does not fail under the normal forces of use. They should only be used to remove small amounts of material. This ensures a long life for the reamer and a superior finish to the hole.|$|E

40|$|For a {{solid carbide}} tapered end-mill, every flute {{includes}} a flute surface and a rake face along a <b>helical</b> side <b>cutting</b> edge, and the end-mill core {{is at the}} center and is tangent to all the flutes. The flutes significantly affect the tools cutting performance and life, and the core radius mainly affects the tools rigidity. Mainly, two methods are adopted in industry to grind the flutes; these are: the direct method and the inverse method. In the direct method, a flute is ground using a standard grinding-wheel moving in multi-axis machining to generate the rake face and the flute surface. However, the flute is the natural outcome of the grinding process without any control. On the other side, the inverse method employs the concept of inverse engineering to build a grinding-wheel that accurately grinds the end-mill flutes. This yields a free-form grinding-wheel profile that is used on a 2 -axis grinding machine; however, the flute shapes are only exact on one section of the end-mill; when the grinding-wheel moves along the side cutting edge to smaller sections; the deviation of the generated flute from the designed one will be increased. Thus, neither can this method grind the rake face with the prescribed normal rake angle, nor generate the side cutting edge in good agreement with its design. Moreover, the grinding-wheel profile is very difficult and expensive to make. To address these problems, a practical and optimal approach for five-axis grinding of prescribed end-mill flutes is proposed by; first, establishing a 5 -axis flute grinding theory describing the wheels locations and orientations during grinding the rake faces with constant normal rake angles; Second, introducing a simple grinding-wheel consisting of lines and circular arcs; and finally, applying an optimization algorithm to optimize the grinding-wheel shape and path. Overall, this approach significantly advances the CNC programming technique for the 5 -axis flute grinding, and can substantially increase the quality of the solid carbide end-mills and lays a good foundation for the CAD/CAE/CAM of end-mills. The advantages of this approach over the other approaches are verified using computer simulation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Owing to {{the complex}} {{geometry}} of <b>helical</b> <b>cutting</b> tools, several manufacturing pro-cesses are required to produce {{the profile of the}} cutter and the cutting angles. If the traditional method of manufacture were used, the cost would be frustratingly expensive. In this paper, a novel straight-sided hob cutter design consisting of two curved cutting edges and three straight cutting edges with different pressure angles is proposed. By applying designed rake profile equations of a hob cutter, the principle of coordinate transformation, the theory of differential geometry, and the theory of gearing, a mathematical model of the <b>helical</b> <b>cutting</b> tool is derived. In addition, the cutting angles, the condition of full undercutting, and the width of the top land of the cutter are also studied. The novelty of the design is such that the multiangles of the <b>helical</b> <b>cutting</b> tool can be manufactured in one hobbing process, thereby simplifying the man-ufacturing process. The results and concepts proposed in the paper will be beneficial as design guidance for tool designers, will enhance the manufacturing processes of <b>helical</b> <b>cutting</b> tools, and will assist tool-related industries in upgrading their technology and competitiveness...|$|E
30|$|The Shinhung® Luna system fixture used in {{this study}} is an {{internal}} submerged type, and its tapered body can obtain firm and stable early fixation in any bone quality. Three <b>helical</b> <b>cutting</b> edges allow self-tapping that can ease implant installation and minimize the resistance of the bone. Gradually enlarging thread exerts pressure on the bone and makes it favorable for stable insertion and by decreasing bone damage. Its upper open-type part enables less resistant installation without any additional drilling. Double thread with 35 ° spiral helix empowers quick and firm installation. An SLA surface showing an average roughness of over Ra 2.5  μm improved bone healing period and cell response by more than 20  %, respectively. In addition, outstanding early fixation was achieved in soft bones.|$|E
50|$|A {{disadvantage}} of the herringbone gear {{is that it}} cannot be cut by simple gear hobbing machines, as the cutter would run into {{the other half of}} the gear. Solutions to this have included assembling small gears by stacking two <b>helical</b> gears together, <b>cutting</b> the gears with a central groove to provide clearance, and (particularly in the early days) by casting the gears to an accurate pattern and without further machining. With the older method of fabrication, herringbone gears had a central channel separating the two oppositely-angled courses of teeth. This was necessary to permit the shaving tool to run out of the groove. The development of the Sykes gear shaper made it possible to have continuous teeth with no central gap. Sunderland, also in England, also produced a herringbone cutting machine. The Sykes uses cylindrical guides and round cutters; the Sunderland uses straight guides and rack-type cutters. The W. E. Sykes Co. dissolved in 1983-84. Since then it has been common practice to obtain an older machine and rebuild it if necessary to create this unique type of gear. Recently, the Bourn and Koch company has developed a CNC-controlled derivation of the W. E. Sykes design called the HDS1600-300. This machine, like the Sykes gear shaper, has the ability to generate a true apex without the need for a clearance groove cut around the gear. This allows the gears to be used in positive displacement pumping applications, as well as power transmission. Helical gears with low weight, accuracy and strength may be 3D printed.|$|R
40|$|Milling is a versatile, {{intermittent}} cutting {{process that is}} used in industry for creating {{many different types of}} components such as aerospace structures, mould and dies as well as thin walled workpieces. To understand the process better, a different contribution towards the variable flow stress machining theory for prediction of intermittent chip formation is presented. A proposed model is developed to extend the application of the variable flow stress machining theory to predict cutting forces in flat helical end milling. Non-uniform chip thickness geometry is yielded as the milling progresses. In applying the variable flow stress machining theory, the uncut chip geometry is portioned into a number of segments by discretizing the radial depth of cut. The chip geometry for each segment is considered to be constant by taking the average value of the maximum and minimum chip thickness. The maximum chip thickness for each chip segment is computed based on the current width of cut, feed per tooth and the cutter diameter. The subsequent radial depth of cut is subtracted from the discretized size of the width of cut to obtain the minimum chip thickness. The milling forces are summed for each infinitesimal segment to obtain the total forces acting on the system of the workpiece and the <b>helical</b> cutter. Oblique <b>cutting</b> conditions are applied to cater for the chip flow direction due to the helix angle. The flow stress of the material is represented by two material constitutive models, the Johnson-Cook constitutive equation and the empirical power law stress-strain relation which is used by Oxley and his co-workers. The models are used to represent the plastic deformation occurring at high strain, strain-rate and temperature in the primary deformation shear zone and tool-chip interface zone to obtain the forces generated during the process. A further model is developed to predict the dynamic chip thickness variation in end milling of thin-walled workpieces. The workpiece is modelled as a flexible cantilever plate and the cutter is assumed to be a rigid body. The specimen is discretised into a number of segments that may have a unique dynamic characteristic. The volume of the removed material is computed at each discrete axial depth of cut and undeformed chip thickness {{as well as at the}} given circumferential section of the tool for each tool step that is taken into account. The variation of the radial depth of cut due to the dynamic displacement of the workpiece is considered in this proposed model. At each time step, the changing workpiece geometry during the milling process is considered by updating the dynamic characteristics of the thin-walled workpiece. Experimental work has been carried out to investigate the characteristics of cutting forces for different cutting conditions with two different work materials and two different helical end mill geometries. The investigation also considers the significant impact of the wall characteristics such as the wall thickness, height and the milling configuration. The outcomes of the experimental investigation are discussed in detail and show the significant effects with the variation of the wall, giving an indication to understanding the machining process in order to build a capable dynamic model. The proposed models are validated by comparing the experimental results obtained with the predicted results. The comparison of the results is encouraging and reasonable correlation is achieved...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, carbide {{end mills}} are widely {{utilized}} in the aluminum, titanium and steel cutting industries, so the {{more and more}} high-precision requirements to design of cutters are provided by users. Meanwhile, in order to finish the simulation and analysis of cutting processing, {{it is also important}} to design more free-control geometry model, and then transit into the CAD/CAM systems. For this purpose, many research works have been successfully conducted on optimizing the geometry model of cutters to get more real and easy controlled geometry; however, another critical factor, there are still more space to optimize the geometry model of cutters. To finish this task, in this work, first, a method has been established and implemented in the MATLAB to convert mathematic model into a free-form geometry model. Then, an accurate calculation system of area moment inertial of cutter is built. Finally, a detailed discussion on the cutting force of end-mills is provided, based on cutting simulation software. The major contributions of this work include the free-form end-mill modeling, which can render the 3 -D geometric model of an end-mill in CATIA system, and a type of calculation of cutter area moment of inertial.

40|$|Abstract: Currently, {{straight}} cutting-edge carpenter shapers {{are widely}} used in the production process. The manner of contact between this traditional type of shaper and the workpiece is a piecewise continuous curve. One drawback of shapers of this type is that the noise generated during the cutting process tends to be very loud. In order to overcome this problem, the current paper takes {{the thickness of the}} cutter into account and employs the concept of equidistant lines and surfaces to develop a new carpenter shaper that comprises a <b>helical</b> <b>cutting</b> edge on a cylindrical shank surface. The geometric shape of the blade surface that is mounted in the groove of the cutter shank is ®rst derived. The contact curve of the proposed carpenter shaper with the workpiece is shown to be continuous. In order to establish a geometric model that facilitates the simple production of a carpenter helical shaping cutter, this paper presents a new design approach, which constructs an equidistant and equivalent involute helical surface model and a corresponding planar unwinding torus model. The carpenter shaper thus obtained is proven to be successful in reducing the noise levels of the cutting process. The contact style of the shaper also oVers the additional advantages of higher cutting e¤ciency, lower energy consumption and longer tool-life. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the eVectiveness of the proposed modelling approach. The results indicate that the proposed carpenter helical shaping (CHS) cutter model is accurate, e¤cient and comprehensive. The model is su¤ciently accurate that it {{can be used as a}} guideline for the design, manufacture and assembly of robust, reliable and silent wooden shapers...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Industrial and Manufacturing EngineeringIncludes bibliographic {{references}} (leaves 149 - 154) Increasingly, fiber reinforced polymers {{are being}} used in aerospace, naval, and automotive industries due to their high specific strength and high stiffness. Some of the damage problems encountered during machining these materials include: delamination, surface roughness and high rate of tool wear. Major factors that affect damage during machining in these materials are cutting forces, tool geometry, feed rate, and spindle speed. The {{first part of this}} study aims to develop an approximate mechanistic model to predict the cutting forces in the orthogonal cutting of unidirectional fiber reinforced polymers (FRP) when the fiber orientation varies from 00 to 1800. This work utilizes the mechanistic modeling approach for predicting cutting forces and simulating the milling process of fiber reinforced polymers with a straight cutting edge. Specific energy functions were developed by multiple regression analysis (MR) and committee neural network approximation (CN) of milling force data and a cutting model was developed based on these energies and the cutting geometry. Cutting force prediction models were constructed for principal and thrust cutting directions. The models are based on the specific cutting energy principle and account {{for a wide range of}} fiber orientations and chip thickness. Results from two forms of non-linear modeling methods, non-linear regression and committee neural networks, were compared. It was found that the committee neural networks provide better prediction capability of smoothing and capturing the inherent non-linearity in the data. The model predictions were found to be in good agreement with experimental results over entire range of fiber orientations from 0 * to 180 *. The second part of this study dealt with an improved mechanistic cutting force model for complex tool geometry by sectioning the <b>helical</b> <b>cutting</b> edge into a stacked series of straight edge cutter segments with angular offsets and calculating the forces for each segment, then adding the forces for all segments of the cutting edge. The scope of this work is to establish a three dimensional cutting force prediction model for complex cutting tool geometry using orthogonal machining database developed in first part. The cutting forces predicted have shown a good agreement with experimental results. The third part of this study dealt with building a generalized model to predict cutting forces for any combination of process parameters such as spindle speed (nt), feed rate (Vf), depth of cut (ae), rake angle (αi) and workpiece fiber layup direction ψ. Committee neural network is constructed using machining parameters – chip thickness (ac), fiber orientation angle (θ), spindle speed (nt) and feed rate (Vf) as input variables and average specific cutting energy values, (Kc and Kt) as output variables. Exhaustive experimentation is conducted to develop the model and to validate it. The training of the networks is performed with experimental machining data. Results showed that the model provides good results for unidirectional composites for all fiber orientation. The experimental results show a reasonably good fit to the predicted values, suggesting that the current approach is successful and well suitable for studying the machining of fiber reinforced polymers. Results also showed that the cutting forces are directly dependent on fiber orientation, chip thickness, rake angle, spindle speed, and feed rate...|$|E
