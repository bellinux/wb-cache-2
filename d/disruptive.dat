5|$|<b>Disruptive</b> {{coloration}} (also {{known as}} <b>disruptive</b> camouflage or <b>disruptive</b> patterning) {{is a form}} of camouflage that works by breaking up the outlines of an animal, soldier or military vehicle with a strongly contrasting pattern. It is often combined with other methods of crypsis including background colour matching and countershading. It appears paradoxical as a way of not being seen, since disruption of outlines depends on high contrast, so the patches of colour are themselves conspicuous.|$|E
5|$|<b>Disruptive</b> {{patterns}} use strongly contrasting, non-repeating markings such as spots or stripes {{to break}} up the outlines of an animal or military vehicle, or to conceal telltale features, especially the eyes, as in the common frog. <b>Disruptive</b> patterns may use more than one method to defeat visual systems such as edge detection. Predators like the leopard use <b>disruptive</b> camouflage to help them approach prey, while potential prey like the Egyptian nightjar use it to avoid detection by predators. <b>Disruptive</b> patterning is common in military usage, both for uniforms and for military vehicles. <b>Disruptive</b> patterning, however, does not always achieve crypsis on its own, as an animal or a military target may be given away by factors like shape, shine, and shadow.|$|E

5|$|<b>Disruptive</b> {{coloration}} {{is common}} in military usage, for military vehicles, for firing positions and other installations, and for individual soldiers, where uniforms, equipment such as helmets, and face paint {{may be used to}} break up outlines and features. <b>Disruptive</b> coloration, however, does not always achieve crypsis on its own, as an animal or a military target may be given away by other factors including shape, shine, and shadow.|$|E

5|$|Many {{military}} camouflage patterns {{since the}} 1940s have been disruptively coloured, {{and with the}} issue of US Woodland pattern to United States armed forces from 1981, <b>disruptive</b> pattern became a dominant feature of military uniforms. From 1969, <b>Disruptive</b> Pattern Material (DPM) began to replace plain material for uniforms in the British Armed Forces and was later used by many other armies.|$|E
5|$|The {{case went}} to trial in June 1982 in Philadelphia. Judge Albert F. Sabo {{initially}} agreed to Abu-Jamal's request to represent himself, with criminal defense attorney Anthony Jackson acting as his legal advisor. During {{the first day of}} the trial, Sabo warned Abu-Jamal that he would forfeit his legal right to self-representation if he continued to be intentionally <b>disruptive.</b> Due to Abu-Jamal's continued <b>disruptive</b> behavior, Sabo ruled that Abu-Jamal forfeited his right to self-representation.|$|E
5|$|Gameplay using {{competitive}} Smash Bros. {{rules is}} usually played in stock mode {{and with a}} timer. Items are turned off and the only tournament legal stages are {{those that do not}} feature hazards and other <b>disruptive</b> elements.|$|E
5|$|Other {{camouflage}} schemes {{acknowledge that}} aircraft {{may be seen}} at any angle and against any background while in combat, so aircraft are painted all over with a <b>disruptive</b> pattern or a neutral colour such as gray.|$|E
5|$|Selection has {{different}} effects on traits. Stabilizing selection acts {{to hold a}} trait at a stable optimum, and in the simplest case all deviations from this optimum are selectively disadvantageous. Directional selection favours extreme values of a trait. The uncommon <b>disruptive</b> selection also acts during transition periods when the current mode is sub-optimal, but alters the trait {{in more than one}} direction. In particular, if the trait is quantitative and univariate then both higher and lower trait levels are favoured. <b>Disruptive</b> selection can be a precursor to speciation.|$|E
5|$|Soviet Air Forces {{aircraft}} {{were painted}} with shades of green, either plain or in <b>disruptive</b> patterns above, and blue-grey on the undersurfaces.|$|E
5|$|The book {{introduced}} {{the concepts of}} <b>disruptive</b> coloration to break up an object's outlines, of masquerade, as when a butterfly mimics a leaf, and especially of countershading, where an animal's tones make it appear flat by concealing its self-shadowing.|$|E
5|$|While {{background}} matching {{works best}} for a single background, <b>disruptive</b> coloration is a more effective strategy when an animal or a military vehicle may {{have a variety of}} backgrounds.|$|E
5|$|Aircraft {{were first}} camouflaged during World War I; {{aircraft}} camouflage {{has been widely}} employed since then. In World War II, <b>disruptive</b> camouflage became widespread for fighters and bombers, sometimes combined with countershading. Some air forces such as the German Luftwaffe varied their paint schemes to suit differing flight conditions such as the skyglow over German cities, or the sands of the Mediterranean front.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{all people}} with Tourette's have comorbid conditions, most Tourette's {{patients}} presenting for clinical care at specialty referral centers may exhibit symptoms of other conditions {{along with their}} motor and phonic tics. Associated conditions include attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADD or ADHD), obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), learning disabilities and sleep disorders. <b>Disruptive</b> behaviors, impaired functioning, or cognitive impairment in patients with comorbid Tourette's and ADHD may {{be accounted for by}} the comorbid ADHD, highlighting the importance of identifying and treating comorbid conditions. Disruption from tics is commonly overshadowed by comorbid conditions that present greater interference to the child. Tic disorders in the absence of ADHD {{do not appear to be}} associated with <b>disruptive</b> behavior or functional impairment, while impairment in school, family, or peer relations is greater in patients who have more comorbid conditions and often determines whether therapy is needed.|$|E
5|$|Bath and North East Somerset council made {{an order}} banning {{coaches and buses}} from the crescent, {{after many years of}} {{complaints}} by residents that the tours given to tourists were <b>disruptive,</b> particularly because of the amplified commentary given by tour guides on open top buses.|$|E
5|$|Buddhism {{long held}} that the tengu were <b>disruptive</b> demons and s of war. Their image {{gradually}} softened, however, into one of protective, if still dangerous, spirits of the mountains and forests. Tengu {{are associated with the}} ascetic practice of Shugendō, and they are usually depicted in the garb of its followers, the yamabushi.|$|E
5|$|Fish such as Dascyllus aruanus have bold <b>disruptive</b> {{patterns}} on their sides, breaking up their outlines with strong contrasts. Fish like Heniochus macrolepidotus have similar bands of colour that extend into fins projecting {{far from the}} body, distracting attention from the true shape of the fish.|$|E
5|$|In 2011 PRSA publicized {{accusations that}} O'Dwyer had been {{eavesdropping}} on PRSA's conference calls. Later that year PRSA started refusing O'Dwyer entrance to their events {{and sent a}} 23-page letter to O'Dwyer describing his behavior as <b>disruptive</b> and unethical. The National Press Club tried to negotiate his entrance unsuccessfully.|$|E
5|$|In February 2013, Gavyn Davies for The Financial Times {{emphasized}} that a key {{difference between the}} 1930s and the 21st century outbreaks {{is that in the}} thirties some of the retaliations between countries were carried out not by devaluations, but by increases in import tariffs, which tend to be much more <b>disruptive</b> to international trade.|$|E
5|$|Like the French, the German air {{services}} used {{a variety}} of <b>disruptive</b> camouflage patterns until April 1917, when lozenge camouflage was introduced; it used up to five colors. German aircraft were however sometimes painted in deliberately conspicuous colors, like the bright red of Manfred von Richthofen's Albatros D.III, advertising the pilot's prowess to intimidate the enemy.|$|E
5|$|Many {{animals are}} highly {{sensitive}} to motion; for example, frogs readily detect small moving dark spots but ignore stationary ones. Therefore, motion signals {{can be used}} to defeat camouflage. Moving objects with <b>disruptive</b> camouflage patterns remain harder to identify than uncamouflaged objects, especially if other similar objects are nearby, even though they are detected, so motion does not completely 'break' camouflage.|$|E
5|$|Many {{fish have}} eyespots near their tails, {{a form of}} automimicry, to {{distract}} attacks away from the vulnerable head and eye. For example, Chaetodon capistratus has both a (<b>disruptive)</b> eyestripe to conceal the eye, and a large eyespot near its tail, giving {{the impression that the}} head is {{at the tail end of}} the body.|$|E
5|$|Many {{poisonous}} or distasteful {{animals that}} advertise their presence with warning coloration (aposematism) use patterns that emphasize rather than disrupt their outlines. For example, skunks, salamanders and monarch butterflies all have high contrast patterns that display their outlines. These advertising patterns exploit the opposite principle to <b>disruptive</b> coloration, {{for what is}} in effect the exactly opposite effect: to make the animal as conspicuous as possible.|$|E
5|$|No Admiralty {{camouflage}} {{section was}} established until October 1940. Admiralty camouflage schemes promulgated in 1941 were not universally adopted because of difficulties with operating schedules and shortages of some paint pigments. Nearly all destroyers and larger ships wore an Admiralty <b>disruptive</b> camouflage scheme by late 1942; but Commonwealth captains executed official camouflage schemes with greater variation than was customary with American measures.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally {{a hospice}} {{will be unable}} to provide care to a patient, either due to {{philosophical}} differences with the patient or due to a safety issue. Such causes could include <b>disruptive</b> or abusive behavior from the patient or other persons in the patient's home or refusal to cooperate with the hospice program. Patients may, after being discharged from hospice for any reason, re-enroll in hospice at a later date as necessary.|$|E
5|$|Opponents {{argue that}} actual energy savings are inconclusive, that DST {{increases}} health risks such as heart attack, that DST can disrupt morning activities, {{and that the}} act of changing clocks twice a year is economically and socially <b>disruptive</b> and cancels out any benefit. Farmers have tended to oppose DST.|$|E
5|$|Other throwback jerseys {{worn by the}} Raptors {{include a}} green uniform worn from the 2007−08 season through to the 2011−12 season on St. Patrick's Day, {{as well as a}} {{camouflage}} uniform based on CADPAT (Canadian <b>Disruptive</b> Pattern) during special events involving the Canadian Armed Forces.|$|E
5|$|Progressive pop {{is a form}} of {{pop music}} which {{attempts}} to break with the genre's standard formula. Originally termed for early progressive rock music, some stylistic features of progressive pop include changes in key and rhythm, experiments with larger forms, and unexpected, <b>disruptive,</b> or ironic treatments of past conventions. Performers commonly produce their own material while opposing the influence of managers, agents, or record companies.|$|E
5|$|Some species, {{such as the}} gemsbok, sable antelope, and Grant's gazelle, are camouflaged with {{strongly}} <b>disruptive</b> facial markings that {{conceal the}} highly recognisable eye. Many species, such as gazelles, may be made to look flat, and hence to blend into the background, by countershading. The outlines of many bovids are broken up with bold <b>disruptive</b> colouration, the strongly contrasting patterns helping to delay recognition by predators. However, all the Hippotraginae (including the gemsbok) have pale bodies and faces with conspicuous markings. The zoologist Tim Caro describes this as difficult to explain, but given that the species are diurnal, he suggests that the markings may function in communication. Strongly contrasting leg colouration is common only in the Bovidae, where for example Bos, Ovis, bontebok and gemsbok have white stockings. Again, communication is the likely function.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} {{television}} was a <b>disruptive</b> force for Edmonton’s cinemas. The theatre {{was forced to}} close in 1958, and the McKernan family sold the Princess Block soon after. The Princess’s last advertisement ran on July 19, 1958 advertising a double bill, Away All Boats and Day of Fury. There were no showtimes, articles or editorials printed in the following days.|$|E
5|$|The {{importance}} of high-contrast patterns for successful disruption was predicted {{in general terms}} by the artist Abbott Thayer in 1909 and explicitly by the zoologist Hugh Cott in 1940. Later experimental research has started to confirm these predictions. <b>Disruptive</b> patterns work best when all their components match the background.|$|E
5|$|The {{outlines}} of an animal's body {{can be made}} hard to see by other methods, such as by using a highly irregular outline. For example, the comma butterfly, Polygonia c-album, is highly cryptic when its wings are closed, with cryptic colours, <b>disruptive</b> pattern, and irregular outer margins to the wings.|$|E
5|$|The root of {{the modern}} multi-scale {{camouflage}} patterns {{can be traced back}} to 1930s experiments in Europe for the German and Soviet armies. This was followed by Canadian development of Canadian <b>Disruptive</b> Pattern (CADPAT), first issued in 2002, and then with US work which created Marine pattern (MARPAT), launched between 2002 and 2004.|$|E
5|$|The {{strategy}} appears paradoxical and counter-intuitive as {{a method}} of camouflage, since disrupting outlines depends on using patches of colour which contrast strongly with each other, so the patches are themselves conspicuous. While background matching works best for a single background, <b>disruptive</b> coloration is a more effective strategy when an animal or a military vehicle may have a variety of backgrounds.|$|E
5|$|Additional Confederate {{activity}} in Louisiana occurred on June 29 at Goodrich's Landing. Confederates attacked a plantation and army training center run by former slaves. The Confederates destroyed the plantations and captured {{over a hundred}} former slaves before disengaging {{in the face of}} Ellet's Marines. Confederate raids such as these were <b>disruptive</b> and caused damage, but they were only minor setbacks and showed the Confederates could cause only momentary disturbances in the area.|$|E
