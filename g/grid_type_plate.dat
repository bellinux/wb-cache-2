Such thickness variation, so called ‘lens effect’, is well known for vitrified specimen, and may contribute to uneven particle distribution that can hamper efficient data collection. In order to characterize the lens effect for each <b>grid</b> <b>type,</b> micrographs were visually examined. All the <b>grid</b> <b>types</b> showed typical lens effect with varying extent although lacey carbon grid did not show distinctive, circular lens effect due to irregular size and shape of the holes (Figure  1).|$|R

Osteosynthesis was performed on these pieces: 35 were fixed using 95 ° lateral blade plates and 30 with DCS plates.

40|$|Up until now, {{structured}} curvilinear grids {{are commonly}} used for hydraulic modelling. However, this <b>grid</b> <b>type</b> has several disadvantages such as staircase representations along closed boundaries and unnecessary high resolution in sharp inner bends. A so called ‘flexible mesh’ can overcome these limitations, since different shapes of grid cells can be used. However, model performance is not directly clear. Several different <b>grid</b> <b>types</b> are compared based on model performance and computation time. This shows that an unstructured grid with curvilinear grid cells in the summer bed and triangles in the floodplains is the most appropriate mesh for 2 DH hydraulic modelling. A curvilinear grid in the summer bed ensures high resolution in the channel cross direction, while less grid cells are needed compared to a complete triangular grid. This has a beneficial effect on computation time...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, two <b>grid</b> <b>types</b> are {{discussed}} {{for the use}} as interstage 1 - 2 structure of the Veículo Lançador de Microssatélites (VLM). VLM is a launcher for microsatellites made of 3 stages arranged in tandem. The interstage 1 - 2 is an open grid structure because of the hot separation of the first stage. The grid is made of light yet stiff carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP). The two discussed <b>grid</b> <b>types</b> for the interstage are the axial grid and the hoop grid. The axial grid consists of axial stiffeners, which are parallel to the axis of the launcher, and helical stiffeners arranged at a +θ angle and at a – θ angle. The hoop grid is made of hoop stiffeners which are circular and helical stiffeners {{similar to those of}} the axial grid. The mechanical behavior of interstages made of these two <b>grid</b> <b>types</b> is discussed with respect to stiffness and stability. Finite element modelling (FEM) is used to determine the influence of the grid components on the eigenfrequency of the launcher. In this analysis, the stiffeners of the interstage are smeared into a cylindrical shell and implemented into a shell element model of VLM. The net thickness of the smeared stiffeners is varied to determine the influence of each stiffener type on the modal analysis. The smeared stiffeners are then discretized into individual stiffeners and the resulting gird barrels are analyzed via FEM using beam elements to determine the stability behavior of the grids. Here the influence of the width to thickness ratio of the stiffeners having rectangular cross sections is inspected. Having established an understanding of the mechanical behavior of the two grids, an interstage design for both <b>grid</b> <b>types</b> is developed using the above described analyses. It is found that the minimum mass of the axial grid interstage, which fulfils the stiffness and stability requirements, is lighter than the hoop grid interstage...|$|R

30|$|The {{reservoir}} {{under investigation}} {{is divided into}} grid blocks for ease of computations using numerical integration of flow equations embedded in the CMG® software. These grid blocks can be two- or three-dimensional, and <b>grid</b> <b>types</b> can be of variable depths and thicknesses: Cartesian, radial, or cylindrical, orthogonal corner point, and non-orthogonal corner point <b>grid</b> <b>types</b> depending on the reservoir. The size of each grid block depends {{on the size of}} the reservoir. A larger number of grid blocks (or smaller size of each grid block) make the algorithm to be slower with the increasing computational load. On the other hand, if the physical size of each grid block is too large, then the results become less accurate since it is assumed that throughout a single grid block, permeability and porosity (static parameters) are uniform. Grid selection is, therefore, problem dependent, and will, therefore, be discussed separately for the case studies investigated.|$|R

Recently new algebraic method was formulated to generate numerical grids for CFD calculation of twin screw machines with grids generated from outer casing boundaries [16, 18]. In this paper, the grids of Rotor to Casing and Casing to Rotor type are tested for performance calculation of a dry air screw compressor using ANSYS CFX solver and {{the results have been}} compared with measurements. Firstly the base-line grid of the Rotor to Casing <b>grid</b> <b>type</b> was used to obtain CFD results. A grid independent solution was obtained for this base-line grid. The size of the mesh thus obtained has been used with other grid variants for comparison. A set of successively refined Casing to Rotor <b>grid</b> <b>type</b> was tested by increasing the density of nodes on the rotor profile in the interlobe leakage region. A gradual improvement in the accuracy of flow prediction was achieved with successive refinement in the interlobe region. The third variant used for comparison is a Casing to Rotor <b>grid</b> <b>type</b> with a single rotor domain that has no interface between the rotor blocks. A significant improvement in the prediction of flow and internal pressure was achieved. These developments have also extended the capability of the deforming grids to be used with other CFD solvers like STAR-CCM+ and ANSYS FLUENT.
