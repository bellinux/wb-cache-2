40|$|A 1980 poll on {{conventional}} testing methods for {{the determination of}} the mechanical bond strength of <b>glued</b> <b>box</b> board seams resulted in a sad picture: eleven of the 25 questioned box board producers and converters qualify the glued seam subjectively by means of a fibretear test after manually splitting the adherends; the remaining 14 companies apply ten different procedures. This situation gave impact to the elaboration of a suggestion for an objective standard method suitable for quantitative measurements of the bond strength of set glued seams on folding boxes, which are ready to be delivered. For this purpose, the three most promising among the known procedures have been selected, and together with a fourth new developed method, tested for their applicability. As a primary criterion for the evaluation of the measured data, the resolution of the tested methods has been compared. The resolution has been studied as a function of parameters, which are relevant to the results, such asrate of loading, orientation of the seam axis, and loading direction. The novel procedure proved to be superior to the other tested methods...|$|E
40|$|Post-tensioned timber frames have {{recently}} been undergoing heavy research and development at the University of Canterbury. The recently developed post-tensioned timber system utilises engineering wood products such as Laminated Veneer Lumber (LVL) and glue laminated timber (Glulam), which are formed into box sections and post-tensioned with high strength steel tendons made from stranded steel wire or solid steel bars. The post-tensioning serves to counteract some of the bending actions imposed on the timber beam from loading {{through a variety of}} mechanisms. Previous research has focused on the seismic performance and gravity frame performance of post-tensioned timber, both of which yielded promising results. There is however a commonly perceived increase in fire risk with timber building, particularly multi-storey timber buildings, and the fire performance of post-tensioned timber had not previously been investigated. Therefore, the focus of this research was to investigate the fire performance of post-tensioned timber beams. This was completed through a series of full-scale furnace tests, {{and the development of a}} fire resistance design method. Three 4. 36 m span post-tensioned timber beams were exposed to the ISO 834 standard fire. Each of the test beams were <b>glued</b> <b>box</b> beams made from 63 mm LVL and were of varying external dimensions. Each beam was intended to demonstrate a specific failure mechanism at approximately 60 minutes of fire exposure. The failure mechanisms demonstrated were a shear failure in the lower corner of due to corner rounding, and a combined bending and compression failure at the end of the beam. These failure mechanisms are unique to post-tensioned timber in fire. The results of the experimental testing were used to validate and refine the proposed fire resistance calculation. Also tested during the full-scale testing were five different forms of anchorage fire protection. These were tested as a secondary objective, but useful thermal data was collected. Through the full-scale testing and the calculation method development it was found that it is important to consider shear during fire design. The post-tensioning increases the bending capacity of a beam but doesn’t affect its shear capacity, therefore when more loading is applied to utilise the increased bending capacity the shear action is increased which leads to shear governing the design in many cases. It is also important to consider shear not only in the webs at the centroid where the shear flow is greatest but also in the lower corners, which can become much thinner than the webs. Without calculation it is not possible to determine where the shear stress will be greatest and therefore both the web and the lower corners need to be checked. It was also found that as the timber section chars on three sides the post-tensioning eccentricity increases which can lead to the moment at the end of the beam becoming critical. Other failure mechanisms which need to be checked include, combined bending and compression at mid span, and tension in the bottom most fibre at mid span. It was found that the proposed calculation method, when used with a char rate of 0. 72 mm/min and an additional allowance of 7 mm for temperature-affected timber beneath the char layer, provided good predictions of the failure times for the full-scale experiments...|$|E

The mosaic work is made by making use of natural fine grains and textures of wood. Timbers of different colors are cut into oblong rods of desired sections. Spindle tree (Euonymus spp.) and Ilex macropoda are used for white, aged Katsura tree (Cercidiphyllum japonicum) for black, Picrasma quassioides, mulberry (Morus alba) and Chinese lacquer tree (Toxicodendron vernicifluum) for yellow, camphor tree (Cinnamomum camphora) and Maackia for brown, black walnut (Juglans nigra) for purple, Japanese cucumber tree (Magnolia obovata) for blue and Chinese cedar (Toona sinensis) for red. The rods are then glued together to form the section of geometrical design pattern. The sectional surface is sliced into thin plates of wood, which are <b>glued</b> onto <b>boxes</b> and other handicraft works. To add to the glaze and sturdiness of the surface, finishing coatings of lacquer are applied.|$|R

40|$|Two n-dimensional {{manifolds}} M 1 and M 2 are cobordant {{if there}} is an (n + 1) -dimensional manifold W with the disjoint union of M 1 and M 2 as its boundary. Such a simple definition can lead to very interesting results in many different areas of mathematics. Algebraic topology is perhaps the most obvious one, with cobordism being central to surgery theory and the study of high-dimensional manifolds. Cobordisms and Morse Theory have a very intimate relationship, whilst at the same time cobordisms are having fun being the domains of TQFTs (topological quantum field theories). Cobordism theories can be made into extraordinary cohomology theories, and they are also playing a central role in modern-day knot theory. Contrary to what Wikipedia says, cobordism {{has nothing to do with}} “a Danish modern art movement based on <b>gluing</b> carboard <b>boxes</b> to your face”. In this talk I will show why 1, 2 and 3 -manifolds are all null-cobordant (i. e. cobordant to an empty manifold), with the 3 -dimensional case obviously taking the majority of the time. Interestingly, the proof hinges on showing that we can construct every 3 -manifold from S 3 by surgery on a link, a result which is very beautiful in its own right...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to study the {{implementation}} of industrial engineering tools in selected manufacturing company to identify the highest defects occurred at the company production lines and propose new methods to the selected manufacturing company for defects reduction and thus improve the productivity of the company. The chosen company is NamHwa Paper Industries (M) SDN. BHD. and the product being analyzed is 1040 mm paper. The study mainly focuses on 7 Quality Control. In order to achieve the objective of the study, firstly, the flow of process to produce 1040 mm paper was observed. From the observation, there are total of 8 workstations at the company. The workstations are Slitter, Print, Slotter, Glue, Stitching, Partition, Die Cut and Tie workstation. Then, each frequency of defects at the workstation was collected by using check sheets. The data was then arranged according to the highest to lowest frequency in cumulative table and Pareto chart was build base on the cumulative table. Defect with the highest frequency can be identified and was chosen to be analyzed. The workstation chosen for analyzed was Glue workstation. Initially, the original methods imply at glue workstation has very much defects and did not achieve the targeted output. Hence, brainstorming needs to be done to build the cause and effect diagram as detailed as possible causes in each of the broad areas where the causes will be 4 M which is Methods, Machines, Manpower and Materials. Based on the cause and effect diagram, solutions were generated. There are few suggestions that can suite the company and improve the productivity of NamHwa Paper Industries (M) SDN. BHD. The solutions are divided the <b>glue</b> paper <b>box</b> into few group before stacking up, use electric fan or airy place for glue workstation, and use table lamp or hair dryer.

40|$|The powder pocket or soot cavity is a morphologic {{characteristic}} of a close contact shot. In a research project concerning staining inside the barrel, {{the influence of the}} powder pocket on these traces was investigated. According to the 'triple contrast method', thin pads containing a mixture of acrylic paint, radiocontrast agent and blood were <b>glued</b> on plastic <b>boxes</b> which were coated with a 3 - 4 -mm-thick silicone layer. The containers filled with 10  % ballistic gelatine, were stored for at least 60  h at 4  °C. Thirty-three contact shots were realized using different pistols and 22 lr,. 32 auto,. 38 special and 9 -mm Luger with different barrel length using subsonic, non-deforming ammunition. The documentation comprised endoscopy, high speed video and computer tomography (CT) of the target models. Using image analysis, the ballooning of the silicone coat was studied (lateral view projection). High-speed video confirmed the actual comprehension of the behaviour of muzzle gases in contact shots. The powder cavity rises in about 1. 5 to 2  ms, preceding the maximum of the temporary cavity, and the powder pocket's collapse takes 2. 5 to 3  ms. The size of the silicone dome increased with decreasing barrel length. Comparing semi-automatic pistols of 4  in. barrel length in the calibres,. 32 auto and 9 -mm Luger, {{there were no significant differences}} of the powder pocket size. Material transport was observed, against and perpendicularly to the shooting direction. CT showed undermining and gas inclusions inside the powder pocket. A correlation between amount and pattern of the staining inside the barrel and the volume of the powder pocket was not observed...|$|R
40|$|Linear Corrugating is {{a process}} for the {{manufacture}} of corrugated containers in which the flutes of the corrugated medium are oriented in the Machine Direction (MD) of the several layers of paper used. Conversely, in the conventional corrugating process the flutes are oriented {{at right angles to}} the MD in the Cross Machine Direction (CD). Paper is stronger in MD than in CD. Therefore, boxes made using the Linear Corrugating process are significantly stronger-in the prime strength criteria, Box Compression Test (BCT) than boxes made conventionally. This means that using Linear Corrugating boxes can be manufactured to BCT equaling conventional boxes but containing 30 % less fiber. The corrugated container industry is {{a large part of the}} U. S. economy, producing over 40 million tons annually. For such a large industry, the potential savings of Linear Corrugating are enormous. The grant for this project covered three phases in the development of the Linear Corrugating process: (1) Production and evaluation of corrugated boxes on commercial equipment to verify that boxes so manufactured would have enhanced BCT as proposed in the application; (2) Production and evaluation of corrugated boxes made on laboratory equipment using combined board from (1) above but having dual manufactures joints (<b>glue</b> joints). This <b>box</b> manufacturing method (Dual Joint) is proposed to overcome box perimeter limitations of the Linear Corrugating process; (3) Design, Construction, Operation and Evaluation of an engineering prototype machine to form flutes in corrugating medium in the MD of the paper. This operation is the central requirement of the Linear Corrugating process. Items I and II were successfully completed, showing predicted BCT increases from the Linear Corrugated boxes and significant strength improvement in the Dual Joint boxes. The Former was constructed and operated successfully using kraft linerboard as the forming medium. It was found that tensile strength and stretch characteristics of the corrugating medium were not sufficient to allow fluting this paper in the former. Possible causes and corrective actions to overcome this problem are addressed in the body of the report below...|$|R
