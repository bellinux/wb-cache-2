30|$|A channel-hopping based {{cognitive}} radio MAC mechanism, called CH-MAC {{is presented in}} Su and Zhang (2008 a). In CH-MAC, each CR user maintains its own channel <b>hopping</b> <b>sequence</b> determined by a unique ID (e.g., MAC address). Since all CR users employ a same hopping-sequence generation function, a potential CR sender can easily obtain the <b>hopping</b> <b>sequence</b> of intended CR receiver. For negotiation and data transmission a CR sender follows its receiver’s <b>hopping</b> <b>sequence</b> and doesn’t need a dedicated control channel. However, the paper didn’t describe that how a potential CR sender meets its intended CR receiver on a particular channel efficiently. The sensing scheme presented in DaSilva and Guerreiro (2008) attempts to explore the channel <b>hopping</b> <b>sequence</b> to guarantee rendezvous. To do so, each CR user has a pre-defined channel <b>hopping</b> <b>sequence</b> constructed {{in such a way}} that CR senders rendezvous with their intended CR receivers when they are not synchronized. However, the derived expected time-to-rendezvous a CR pair, and sensing conflict have not been addressed in the paper. In Jiang et al. (2009), considering multi-channel cognitive medium access control, the problem of optimal channel sensing order is formulated and then a dynamic programming technique is proposed as a solution. In addition, some special cases are presented to support the claim that the optimal solution does exist. Nevertheless, there are some limitations; the computation complexity is high when some channels cannot be used by CR users, and the channel vacating issue has not been addressed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Spread Spectrum is a {{modulation}} technique that transmits the original information signal on a considerable larger bandwidth than the bandwidth (frequency contents) {{of the original}} information signal. In Spread Spectrum the signal of specific bandwidth is spread in the frequency domain, resulting in a signal with wider/larger bandwidth such that the new bandwidth is {{much larger than the}} original frequency spectrum. Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS) is one of the fundamental techniques of the Spread Spectrum, in which the carrier frequency does not remain fixed to the specified band of the frequency, but it changes from one frequency to the other at every instant of time, normally it changes thousands time in a second. In FHSS the spreading of the bandwidth is achieved by selecting different carrier frequencies for information signal with the help of <b>hopping</b> <b>sequence.</b> Among the various FHSS advantages, one is the inherent transmission security. In this particular paper we are taking under the consideration a proposed algorithm which results in enhancement of the transmission security by using <b>hopping</b> <b>sequence</b> and its compliment in FHSS technology.

40|$|Abstract—Most {{existing}} multichannel medium {{access control}} (MAC) protocols {{have at least one}} of the following four performance bottlenecks: 1) global synchronization among users; 2) dedicated control channel for signaling exchange; 3) dedicated control phase for signaling exchange; and 4) complete knowledge of all users ’ channel selection strategies. In this paper, we first design a <b>hopping</b> <b>sequence</b> by combining multiple difference sets to ensure a high rendezvous probability of users over multiple channels. Applying the <b>hopping</b> <b>sequence</b> to all users, we then propose a difference-set-based multichannel MAC (DSMMAC) protocol to overcome the performance bottlenecks. Because all users use the same sequence for frequency hopping and channel access, significant signaling overheads can be reduced. The proposed protocol achieves high system throughput and low access delay without the need for global synchronization or a dedicated control channel/phase. Our analytical and simulation results show that the proposed DSMMAC protocol can achieve up to a 100 % improvement in system throughput and a 150 % reduction in channel access delay compared with an existing multichannel MAC protocol.

40|$|In {{cognitive}} radio networks, secondary users need to first discover neighbours and form communication links, {{referred to as}} the rendezvous process. Rendezvous between any two secondary users can only be achieved on the same channel. However, spectrum heterogeneity in {{cognitive radio}} networks complicates the rendezvous process. While most of the existing works study pair-wise rendezvous and design channel <b>hopping</b> <b>sequence,</b> in this paper we focus on the general rendezvous problem for multiple users where each user needs to discover all of its neighbours. We propose to maintain and exchange rendezvous information among encountered users, and leverage rendezvous information spread within the network to accelerate the rendezvous process. With such an idea, we propose a general message passing based framework for rendezvous protocol design, which is flexible to incorporate the existing sequence generation algorithms. For the framework, we formulate rendezvous problems from the perspective of individual user, prove the NP-completeness, and propose an efficient greedy channel switching algorithm. Based on the framework, we design several rendezvous protocols for single-hop and multi-hop networks. When channel <b>hopping</b> <b>sequence</b> generation algorithms with guaranteed rendezvous between any two users are used, the rendezvous with the proposed protocols can still be guaranteed.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{proposes a}} Frequency Hopped Spread Spectrum (FHSS) {{communication}} system using chaos. The spread spectrum technique of frequency hopping uses pseudorandom number (PN) generator {{to produce a}} random sequence of frequencies. In multiple access applications, it is desirable to employ sets of frequency <b>hopping</b> <b>sequences</b> that have good Hamming correlation properties, large period and also large linear span. Most algebraic designs for frequency <b>hopping</b> <b>sequences</b> are based either on PN sequences or else on Reed-Solomon (RS) codes. These sequences having short linear span are potentially weak when the threat of intelligent jamming exists. A new class of signature sequences for use in Frequency Hopped Spread Spectrum communication systems is proposed. In arriving at these sequences, the theory of chaos has been used. The correlation properties of these chaotic sequences are similar to random white noise. The numbers and lengths of chaotic sequences are not restricted like m sequences. The performances of chaotic sequences in multiple access communication are shown {{to be similar to}} that of PN sequences. Furthermore, due to their noise like appearance, chaotic sequences outperform PN sequences in low probability of intercept. In this method the spreading sequences change from one bit to the next in very random like fashion, causing undesired interception to be very difficult...|$|R
