500|$|Well, I didn’t {{know how}} long the comic book series was going to last. I hoped that it would become a success and survive for years and years. But {{at that time in}} my career, it was very early, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> lot of books canceled, just because of poor sales. So early on in the book I would move past storylines very quickly. I set up this love {{triangle}} and I resolved that story and moved along within the first [...] issues. But there's a lot of story potential to mine there. One {{of the things that the}} TV show is able to do is to look at the comic book series with hindsight and go, 'This would probably be something that we could explore more.' And that's what we're going to be doing. So we'll be seeing a lot more of the Lori-Shane-Rick love triangle.|$|E
2500|$|Joe Foster enjoys {{spending}} time with Amy's fourteen-year-old brother, who visits for Amy's wedding to Pearson, calling him [...] "a tonic breeze." [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> boy, I should have wanted him just like Dick," [...] Joe tells himself.(268) Mrs. Phillips is eager to see Amy off so she can invite Cope once more. She and Randolph discuss their somewhat competitive attempts to gain Cope's attention. She calls Arthur [...] "an uncertain quantity."(271) Cope joins another Duneland weekend while Arthur, now cast in an important female role in the Dramatic Society's next presentation, rehearses. Mrs. Phillips explains that good taste requires a man who plays a female role to avoid too perfect an impersonation. Cope alerts the house to a late-night burglar and is praised as a hero though he only raised the alarm, while a servant chased the burglar off. Cope knows the role he played, but Mrs. Phillips and Carolyn convince themselves he played the hero's part.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{passages}} {{are open}} to multiple readings. For example, after Cope swims vigorously and Randolph joins him to bob in the water, the narrator says: [...] "Ceremonially, at least, the rite was complete." [...] Something implied but unspecified did not occur. Cope later recalls his day: [...] "He had had a good swim, if but a brief one, with a companion who had been willing, even if not bold." [...] The action that Randolph was willing but not bold enough to undertake is not specified. Hortense, once she realizes Cope {{has no interest in}} her or the other girls, warns him against Arthur, revealing that she sees the relationship Cope maintains with Arthur as an alternative, in some sense equivalent, to a heterosexual engagement. In an age when literary convention respected intense male relationships, she labels this one [...] "that preposterous friendship." [...] Of a fourteen-year-old boy who has provided entertaining companionship, Joe muses: [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> boy, I should have wanted him just like Dick." ...|$|E
