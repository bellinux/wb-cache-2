5|$|The Moravian {{cultural}} influence {{played a}} significant role in the spread of Christianity onto the Polish lands and the subsequent adoption of that religion. In the opinion of Davies, the Christianisation of Poland through the Czech–Polish alliance represented a conscious choice on the part of Polish rulers to ally themselves with the Czech state rather than the German one. In a similar fashion, some of the later political struggles involved the Polish Church refusing to subordinate <b>itself</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> German hierarchy and instead being directly subordinate to the Vatican.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{remained}} {{the property of}} the Clarendons until 1937, when Lord Clarendon found the maintenance of the castle too expensive and sold Kenilworth to the industrialist Sir John Siddeley. Siddeley, whose tax accounting in the 1930s had been at least questionable, was keen to improve his public image and gave over the running of the castle, complete with a charitable donation, to the Commissioner of Works. In 1958 his son gave the castle <b>itself</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> town of Kenilworth and English Heritage has managed the property since 1984. The castle is classed as a Grade I listed building and as a Scheduled Monument, and is open to the public.|$|E

5|$|A {{variety of}} marine animals possess active {{camouflage}} through {{their ability to}} change colour rapidly. Several bottom-living fish such as the flounder can hide themselves effectively against a variety of backgrounds. Many cephalopods including octopus, cuttlefish, and squid similarly use colour change, in their case both for camouflage and signalling. For example, the big blue octopus, Octopus cyanea, hunts during the day, and can match <b>itself</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> colours and textures of its surroundings, both to avoid predators and to enable it to approach prey. It can perfectly resemble a rock or a coral it is hiding beside. When necessary, in order to scare away a potential predator, it can display markings which resemble eyes.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of World War I, like many other British landowners, the 3rd Earl Brownlow offered his house and park to the Government for war service. The offer was accepted, and {{the largest and most}} drastic changes were made in the park since the time of Viscount Tyrconnel's folly building. In August 1914, the house and park were used as the assembly point for the 11th (Northern) Division before its deployment. In 1915, the home depôt and training ground of the Machine Gun Corps were established {{in the southern part of}} Belton park. The lie of the land there, where the River Witham passes between the Lower Lincolnshire Limestone and the Upper Lias mudstone, lent <b>itself</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> development of the necessary firing ranges close to good communications by way of the Great North Road and the East Coast main line railway station at Grantham. The depôt was closed in 1919, the site cleared and the land restored to Lord Brownlow in 1920. Little sign of the Machine Gun Corps's stay remains in the park, but plaques and inscriptions can be followed from the south gate of Belton park to the memorial gate on the way from there to the town centre and in the north aisle of Grantham parish church.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{representing}} a new vessel, the Enterprise-A {{was the same}} model {{that had been used}} since 1979. Poorly regarded by earlier effects artists because of its complicated wiring and bulk, the Enterprises hairline cracks were puttied and sanded down, and the internal circuitry was redone. The new model's running lights were matched to similar intensities, saving the effects artists time because the lights would look correct with only a single pass, instead of three passes required previously (for the sensor dome, running lights, and window lights). One unfortunate byproduct of the fixes was the loss of the model's distinctive pearlescent finish. The elaborate sheen was never visible on screen (lighting schemes prevented reflections while filming so the ship could be properly inserted into effects shots) and so when the model was repainted with conventional techniques the effect was lost. The Bird of Prey had been damaged from work in The Voyage Home, where the ship was supposed to fly around the sun. To suggest singes, the model had been painted with black-tinged rubber cement, with the expectation that this application would rub off. The cement instead sat on the model and baked <b>itself</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> model surface, and had to be scrubbed off.|$|E

5|$|Honeyeaters such as {{the eastern}} spinebill are {{attracted}} to the flowers. As the bird gathers the nectar, the pollen, which has fins, attaches <b>itself</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> feathers on {{the heads of the}} birds and is carried to other flowers, aiding cross pollination. A study in forests near Hobart in Tasmania found that the eastern spinebill arrived in the area {{at the same time the}} common heath was in flower in March, and left once flowering had finished. Other honeyeaters, {{such as the}} strong-billed, crescent and yellow-throated honeyeaters, fed occasionally at common heath flowers. Field work in the Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia recorded the white-plumed and New Holland honeyeaters, as well as the crescent honeyeater and the eastern spinebill.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, the Nehru Commission {{composing}} {{of representatives}} of Indian political parties proposed constitutional reforms for India that apart from calling for dominion status for India and elections under universal suffrage, would guarantee rights deemed fundamental, representation for {{religious and ethnic}} minorities, and limit {{the powers of the}} government. In 1931, the Indian National Congress (the largest Indian political party of the time) adopted resolutions committing <b>itself</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> defence of fundamental civil rights, as well as socio-economic rights such as the minimum wage and the abolition of untouchability and serfdom. Committing themselves to socialism in 1936, the Congress leaders took examples from the constitution of the erstwhile USSR, which inspired the fundamental duties of citizens as a means of collective patriotic responsibility for national interests and challenges.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, the NRA {{captured}} Kampala with a {{force of}} 14,000 soldiers, including 500 Rwandans, and formed a new government. After Museveni was inaugurated as president, he appointed Kagame and Rwigyema as senior officers in the new Ugandan army. The experience of the Bush War inspired Rwigyema and Kagame to consider an attack against Rwanda, {{with the goal of}} allowing the refugees to return home. In addition to fulfilling their army duties, the pair began building a covert network of Rwandan Tutsi refugees within the army's ranks, intended as the nucleus for such an attack. With the pro-refugee Museveni in power, RANU was able to move back to Kampala. At its 1987 convention, it renamed <b>itself</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Rwandan Patriotic Front, and it too committed to returning the refugees to Rwanda by any means possible. In 1988, a leadership crisis within the RPF prompted Fred Rwigyema to intervene in the organisation and take control, replacing Peter Bayingana as RPF president. Kagame and other senior members of Rwigyema's Rwandan entourage within the NRA also joined, with Kagame assuming the vice-presidency. Bayingana remained as the other vice-president, but resented the loss of the leadership.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} morning of April 18, 1906, a large {{earthquake}} with an epicenter {{near the city of}} San Francisco hit the region. Immediate casualty estimates by the U.S. Army's relief operations were 498 deaths in San Francisco, 64 deaths in Santa Rosa, and 102 in or near San Jose, for a total of about 700. More recent studies estimate the total death count to be over 3,000, with over 28,000 buildings destroyed. Rebuilding efforts began immediately. Amadeo Peter Giannini, owner of the Bank of Italy (now known as the Bank of America), had managed to retrieve the money from his bank's vaults before fires broke out through the city and was the only bank with liquid funds readily available and was instrumental in loaning out funds for rebuilding efforts. Congress immediately approved plans for a reservoir in Hetch Hetchy Valley in Yosemite National Park, a plan they had denied a few years earlier, which now provides drinking water for 2.4 million people in the Bay Area. By 1915, the city had been sufficiently rebuilt and advertised <b>itself</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> world during the Panama Pacific Exposition that year, although the effects of the quake hastened the loss of the region's dominant status in California to the Los Angeles metropolitan area.|$|E

In 2010, Electricity North West, United Utilities, the Lake District National Park Authority and the conservation charity Friends of the Lake District invested £100,000 to remove power lines and replace them with underground cables, to improve the quality of scenery in the vicinity.|$|E
5|$|Like their German counterparts, Soviet {{divisions}} {{were also}} seriously understrength. For example, {{divisions in the}} 40th Army averaged 3,500–4,000 men each, while the 69th Army fielded some divisions which could only count on 1,000–1,500 soldiers. Some divisions had as little as 20–50 mortars to provide fire support. This shortage in manpower and equipment led Vatutin's Southwestern Front to request over 19,000 soldiers and 300 tanks, while {{it was noted that}} the Voronezh Front had only received 1,600 replacements since the beginning of operations in 1943.

After Williams Road, the route makes several bends in {{to the south and}} east, straightening out eastward at an intersection with the northern terminus of CR95. This eastward progression remains stagnant as NY177 continues eastward past CR189. After a short, empty stretch of roadway, NY177 crosses the county line into Lewis County, where it enters the town of Pinckney. Through Pinckney, the route turns to the northeast, crossing Old State Road before bending and turning southeastward into the hamlet of Barnes Corners. In Barnes Corners, the dense forest retreats for a rural community, where NY177 intersects with CR21 and CR2 (Seven-by-Nine Road). CR21 is the former southern terminus of NY194, a designation eliminated in 1980.|$|E
5|$|North & South is a British {{television}} drama serial, {{produced by}} the BBC and originally broadcast in four episodes on BBC One in November and December 2004.

The Western Desert Force pursued the Italians into Libya, and the 7th Armoured Division established <b>itself</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west of Bardia, cutting off land communications between the strong Italian garrison there and Tobruk.
