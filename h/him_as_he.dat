5|$|From the start, {{the film}} moves {{continuously}} between Barton's subjective {{view of the}} world and one which is objective. After the opening credits roll, the camera pans down to Barton, watching the end of his play. Soon we see the audience from his point of view, cheering wildly for <b>him.</b> <b>As</b> <b>he</b> walks forward, he enters the shot and the viewer is returned to an objective point of view. This blurring of the subjective and objective returns in the final scene.|$|E

When Max becomes seriously ill, she voluntarily comes to his {{apartment}} and nurses him back to health.

She leaves Berlin for her parents' house and writes, asking if he intends to marry her. She does not appear again in the novel.

5|$|Israel is a 58-year-old New Yorker {{who decided}} he couldn't be gay and Orthodox, {{and turned his}} back on his religion, though not before his family forced him into {{electroshock}} therapy to try to cure him.

Determined to save his comrades, he unhesitatingly chose to sacrifice himself and, diving into a ditch with the deadly missile, absorbed the violence of the explosion in his own body.|$|E

5|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} in three parts. First, Anderson recorded the music for Ashen. This was done in a wooden loft {{in the corner of}} the rehearsal space used by Azrael, of whom Anderson was, at the time, a member. Anderson has said that he does not remember how long this recording took <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> slept there after finishing the work. He described that space as perfect for the recording, as there was nothing there to distract him.|$|E
5|$|The {{record is}} {{primarily}} based on DeLonge's post-hardcore influences, such as Fugazi and Refused. The recording sessions were particularly difficult for <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had recently undergone back surgery. The record {{is a concept}} album detailing {{the end of the}} world, and features dark, moody tracks mulling over confusion. Blink-182 bassist Mark Hoppus—the only member of that band not involved in the project—felt betrayed over his lack of inclusion, which evolved into tensions between him and DeLonge. It contributed to the band's 2005 breakup.|$|E
5|$|To {{prepare for}} the 1928 season, Berg went up to a lumber camp in New York's Adirondack Mountains three weeks before {{reporting}} to the White Sox spring training facility in Shreveport, Louisiana. The hard labor did wonders for <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> reported to spring training on March 2, 1928 in excellent shape. By {{the end of the}} season, Berg had established himself as the starting catcher.|$|E

5|$|Warner's {{next two}} years were less fruitful. The 1900 {{football}} team went 6–4–1, losing three games to the Big Four, and the 1901 season was a losing one, with Carlisle posting a 5–7–1 record. The following year, the team posted an improved 8–3 record, when Warner began implementing double (lateral) passes. Carlisle's quarterback Jimmy Johnson would make a lateral pass to the halfback running towards the sideline, bringing the defense with <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> tossed the ball back to the fast-running Johnson.|$|E
5|$|When White {{retired as}} Chief of General Staff in 1923, Blamey was widely {{expected}} to succeed <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had {{as chief of}} staff of the Australian Corps in France, but there were objections from more senior officers, particularly Major General Victor Sellheim, at being passed over. Instead, the Inspector General, Lieutenant General Sir Harry Chauvel, was made Chief of General Staff as well, while Blamey was given the new post of Second CGS, in which he performed most of the duties of Chief of General Staff.|$|E
5|$|A similar {{play in the}} game's {{second half}} scored another {{touchdown}}. Quarterback Doc Kuhn dropped back for a more than 40-yard touchdown pass to Bomar. The pass went 28 yards in the air, with Bomar running {{the rest of the}} way. Georgia running back Dave Collings tackled <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> crossed the goal line (injuring himself), and Bomar also made an interception in the 12–0 Vanderbilt victory. The season's final game, against Vanderbilt's oldest rival Sewanee, had a trick play by the Commodores. A fake run ended with Kuhn tossing the ball to Bomar, who was left open behind the defense and easily ran it in; Vanderbilt won, 26–0.|$|E

5|$|A {{terrorist}} group manages to abduct Nao and Kumagami, one of Shunsuke's closest friends and aides, and holds them hostage {{in exchange for}} Yuu, who attempts to rescue them. However, the operation does not go as planned, which results in Kumagami's death and Yuu being gravely injured. After Yuu recovers, he resolves to protect all of the ability users around the world by stealing their abilities per Nao's suggestion. As Yuu travels the world stealing abilities, the more powers he takes on soon takes its toll on <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> starts losing his memories and sense of self. However, he still manages to steal everyone's abilities throughout the world before collapsing. Shunsuke rescues Yuu, bringing him back to Japan among friends and family. Yuu is left with no past memories, but Nao tells him she is his girlfriend. Yuu and his friends {{look forward to the}} memories they will make from now on as Yuu continues to recover from his ordeal.|$|E
5|$|After Barrington {{suffered}} a paralytic stroke in early 1919, {{he was unable}} to perform. He spent {{the rest of his life}} in poverty, although his fellow actors held benefits and made other efforts to help him, and his brothers and his neighbors in East Hagbourne, Berkshire, helped <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> became increasingly disabled and eventually unable even to speak. He died in 1922 while living at the St. James's Infirmary, Balham, in South London, at the age of 69 and is buried in Lower Morden Lane at the Morden Cemetery, also known as Battersea New Cemetery, in Surrey. On the 75th anniversary of Barrington's death, a granite monument with a photoplaque of Barrington as Pooh-Bah was dedicated to him at the Morden Cemetery, by members of the Gilbert and Sullivan Society, the Sir Arthur Sullivan Society and others.|$|E
5|$|Although he openly opposed secession {{during the}} American Civil War, federal {{military}} forces labeled Helm a Confederate sympathizer. In September 1862, {{he was arrested}} for this alleged sympathy, but Governor James F. Robinson recognized <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was being transported to a prison in Louisville and had him released. After the war Helm identified with the Democratic Party, and in 1865 Hardin County voters returned him to the state senate. In 1867 he was the state's Democratic candidate for governor. Despite his failing health, Helm made a vigorous canvass of the state and won the general election. He was too weak to travel to Frankfort for his inauguration, so state officials administered the oath of office at his home on September 3, 1867. He died five days later.|$|E
