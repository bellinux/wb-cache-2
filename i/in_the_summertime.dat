5|$|In Ontario, Riesling is {{commonly}} used for Icewine, where the wine is noted for its breadth and complexity. Niagara is a major producer of ice wine in general, putting it neck-and-neck with Germany. Late Harvest wines and some sparkling wines are produced with Riesling in Niagara but it is table wines from dry to off-dry that hold the largest share of production. The climate of the region is typically quite warm <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>summertime</b> which adds a layer of richness in the wines. It is interesting that the founder of St. Urbanshoff in the Mosel, Herman Weiss, was an early pioneer in Niagara's modern viticulture, selling his strain of Mosel clone Riesling to many producers in west Niagara (these vines are well over 20 years old now). This clone and Niagara's summer heat make for uniquely bright wines and often show up in interesting dry styled versions. Many producers and wine critics will argue that Niagara's best offerings come from the Niagara Escarpment region which encompasses the Short Hills Bench, 20 Mile Bench and Beamsville Bench.|$|E

25|$|Although the {{winemaking}} {{regions of}} the Piedmont and Bordeaux are very close <b>in</b> latitude, only <b>the</b> <b>summertime</b> temperatures are similar: the Piedmont wine region has a colder, continental winter climate, and significantly lower rainfall due to the rain shadow effect of the Alps.

25|$|Immigration and {{industrialization}} {{caused a}} major increase in New York City's {{population in the}} late 19th and early 20th centuries. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>summertime,</b> many of these newer residents began looking for places {{to get away from}} the hot city and the densely populated tenements they lived in. The city's own parks and beaches were often overcrowded. Automobiles became more affordable, and by 1917 there were more cars than horses in the city. Drivers began taking to low-quality roads in search of parks outside the city, but were often disappointed after long drives to find that most of those parks were closed to nonresidents.|$|E
25|$|At mid-latitudes, the F2 layer daytime ion {{production}} {{is higher in}} the summer, as expected, since the Sun shines more directly on the Earth. However, there are seasonal changes in the molecular-to-atomic ratio of the neutral atmosphere that cause the summer ion loss rate to be even higher. The {{result is that the}} increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>summertime</b> loss overwhelms the increase in summertime production, and total F2 ionization is actually lower in the local summer months. This effect is known as the winter anomaly. The anomaly is always present in the northern hemisphere, but is usually absent in the southern hemisphere during periods of low solar activity.|$|E

25|$|In Northern Iran, Mâst Chekide is {{a variety}} of kefir yogurt with a {{distinct}} sour taste. It is usually mixed with a pesto-like water and fresh herb purée called delal.

The most popular appetizers are spinach or eggplant borani, Mâst-o-Khiâr with cucumber, spring onions and herbs, and Mâst-Musir with wild shallots. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>summertime,</b> yogurt and ice cubes are mixed together with cucumbers, raisins, salt, pepper and onions and topped with some croutons made of Persian traditional bread {{and served as a}} cold soup. Ashe-Mâst is a warm yogurt soup with fresh herbs, spinach and lentils.

25|$|Enid {{is home to}} {{the annual}} Tri-State Music Festival which was started in 1932 by Russell L. Wiley, who was Phillips University band {{director}} from 1928 to 1934. From 1933 to 1936, Edwin Franko Goldman headlined the festival. The festival takes place each spring in Enid. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>summertime,</b> Enid's Gaslight Theatre hosts a production of Shakespeare in the Park, as well as year-round theater productions. The Enid Symphony Orchestra was formed in 1905 and is the oldest symphony in the state, performing year-round in the Enid Symphony Center. Enid's Chautauqua in the Park takes place each summer in Government Springs Park, providing five nights of educational performances by scholars portraying prominent historical figures. The Chautauqua program was brought to Enid in 1907 by the Enid Circle Jewish Chautauqua and is now produced by the Greater Enid Arts and Humanities Council.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{persistence}} and decay of springtime total ozone anomalies {{over the entire}} extratropics (midlatitudes plus polar regions) is analysed using results from the Canadian Middle Atmosphere Model (CMAM), a comprehensive chemistry-climate model. As <b>in</b> <b>the</b> observations, interannual anomalies established through winter and spring persist with very high correlation coefficients (above 0. 8) through summer until early autumn, while decaying in amplitude {{as a result of}} photochemical relaxation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> quiescent <b>summertime</b> stratosphere. <b>The</b> {{persistence and}} decay of <b>the</b> ozone anomalies <b>in</b> CMAM agrees extremely well with observations, even <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southern hemisphere when the model is run without heterogeneous chemistry (in which case there is no ozone hole and the seasonal cycle of ozone is quite different from observations).

40|$|High-resolution {{mesoscale}} model {{sea surface}} temperature (SST) analyses and surface wind stress forecasts off the U. S. West Coast are analyzed on monthly time scales for robust signatures of air–sea interaction as the surface winds encounter ocean surface {{features such as}} SST fronts, filaments, and eddies. This interaction is manifest by the linear relationship, or coupling coefficient, between the downwind SST gradient and wind stress divergence and between the crosswind SST gradient and wind stress curl evident from analysis of fields averaged over 29 days. This study examines fields from the Coupled Ocean–Atmosphere Mesoscale Prediction System (COAMPS) model, spanning the summer months, June–September, for four consecutive years, 2002 – 05. Relative to several models evaluated previously, coupling coefficients are much closer to those calculated from Quick Scatterometer (QuikSCAT) satellite measurements. <b>In</b> addition, <b>the</b> <b>summertime</b> correlation between <b>the</b> wind stress derivative field and its corresponding SST gradient field on monthly time scales agrees well with satellite-derived correlations.

40|$|International audienceResults are {{presented}} from a multi-instrument {{study of the}} spatial distribution of <b>the</b> <b>summertime,</b> polar ionospheric electron density under conditions of relatively stable IMF B z < 0. The EISCAT Svalbard radar revealed a region of enhanced densities near magnetic noon that, when comparing radar scans from different local times, appeared to be spatially confined in longitude. This was identified as the tongue-of-ionisation (TOI) that comprised photoionisation of sub-auroral origin that is drawn poleward into the polar cap by the anti-sunward flow of the high-latitude convection. The TOI was bounded in longitude by high-latitude troughs; the pre-noon trough on the morning side with a minimum near 78 ° N and the post-noon trough on the afternoon side with a minimum at 80 ° N. Complementary measurements by radio tomography, the SuperDARN radars, and a DMSP satellite, together with comparisons with earlier modelling work, provided supporting evidence for {{the interpretation of the}} density structuring, and highlighted the role of plasma convection <b>in</b> <b>the</b> formation of <b>summertime</b> plasma distribution.
