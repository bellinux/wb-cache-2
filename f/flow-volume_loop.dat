40|$|AbstractTracheal {{bronchus}} {{is a rare}} anatomic variant {{in which}} a bronchus originates from the trachea. Patients may be asymptomatic or present {{with a variety of}} respiratory symptoms. We present a case of a patient who presented with a history of poorly controlled asthma and a persistent abnormality of the <b>flow-volume</b> <b>loop.</b> Bronchoscopy revealed a tracheal bronchus with narrowed right-sided bronchial orifices. An unrecognized tracheal bronchus may result in serious complications during elective or emergent endotracheal intubation.

Relying on spirometric values without assessing the shape of the <b>flow-volume</b> <b>loop</b> may lead to misdiagnosis and inappropriate management of lung pathology...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: There are {{important}} gaps {{in our understanding}} of the epidemiology and diagnosis of upper-airway obstruction. METHODS: We examined the diagnostic value of several criteria for pre-dicting upper-airway obstruction, and we measured the frequency of detecting upper-airway obstruc-tion via quantitative and visual assessment of <b>flow-volume</b> <b>loops.</b> We studied 4 quantitative and 3 visual criteria for their ability to detect upper-airway obstruction. The quantitative criteria were: ratio of forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV 1) to maximum expiratory flow (MEF) > 10 mL/L/ min; ratio of the flow at the mid-point of the forced expiratory maneuver (MEF 50 %) to the flow at the mid-point of the forced inspiratory maneuver (MIF 50 %) 1; MIF 50 % 1. 5. The visual criteria were: presence of a plateau; biphasic shape; and oscillations. The accepted standard tests for diagnosing upper-airway obstruction were bronchoscopy, laryngoscopy, and chest or neck computed tomogram. We considered 979 consecutive <b>flow-volume</b> <b>loops</b> from the Cleve-land Clinic’s pulmonary function laboratory. We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the individual criteria and an aggregate criterion for predicting upper-airway obstruction.

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] To {{assess the}} occurrence, {{functional}} characteristics and prognostic value of upper airway dysfunction in motor neurone disease, 27 patients unselected for respiratory symptoms were studied. METHODS [...] Upper airway function was evaluated by {{analysis of the}} maximal <b>flow-volume</b> <b>loop.</b> Neurological diagnosis was established from the clinical history and physical examination. The degree of impairment was quantified by the Appel score. RESULTS [...] Twelve patients (group A) showed abnormalities of the maximal <b>flow-volume</b> <b>loop</b> consistent with flow limitation (seven patients) or instability of upper airway function (gross oscillations of airflow, five patients). The remaining 15 patients (group B) exhibited a normal or generally reduced maximal <b>flow-volume</b> <b>loop,</b> suggestive of muscle weakness. No differences were observed between groups in general physical condition, rate of disease progression, or duration of disease. CONCLUSIONS [...] Upper airway dysfunction in patients with motor neurone disease was a frequent finding. It was present more often, but not exclusively, in patients with bulbar features and was unrelated to prognosis...|$|E
40|$|Airway {{pressure}} {{is currently the}} primary indicator of respiratory mechanics used by the anesthetist in the operating room. This quantity can signal that the mechanical properties of the respiratory system have changed. However, {{there is a need}} for more sophisticated monitors of mechanics, capable of indicating the nature of the change. We have investigated the use of the tidal <b>flow-volume</b> <b>loop</b> in differentiating between an obstruction of the endotracheal tube and changes in the distribution of regional ventilation, using a computer model. Endotracheal obstruction caused the descending limb of <b>flow-volume</b> <b>loop</b> to become convex to the volume axis, whereas ventilation inhomogeneity caused the curve to become concave to the volume axis. In contrast, examination of peak airway pressure did not allow differentiation between the two conditions. We conclude that, while the peak airway {{pressure is}} useful in signaling a change in a patient 2 ̆ 7 s condition, the combination of airway pressure and the <b>flow-volume</b> <b>loop</b> serves as a more comprehensive monitor of respiratory mechanics...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background This study {{explores the}} {{feasibility}} of non-invasive assessment of left ventricular volume and flow relationship throughout cardiac cycle employing echocardiographic methods. Methods Nine healthy individuals and 3 patients with severe left-sided valvular abnormalities were subject to resting echocardiography with automated endocardial border detection allowing real-time estimation of left ventricular volume throughout the cardiac cycle. Global and regional (6 different left ventricular segments) estimates of flow-volume loops were subsequently constructed by plotting acquired instantaneous left ventricular 2 -D area data (left ventricular volume) vs. their first derivatives (flow). Results <b>Flow-volume</b> <b>loop</b> estimates were obtainable in 75 % of all echocardiographic images and displayed in normal individuals some regional morphological variation with more pronounced isovolumic events in the paraseptal segments and significantly delayed maximal systolic flow paraapically. In patients with aortic stenosis, maximal systolic flow occurred at a lower estimated left ventricular systolic volume whereas in mitral stenosis, maximal diastolic flow was observed at a higher estimated left ventricular diastolic volume. Aortic regurgitation caused a complex alteration of the estimated <b>flow-volume</b> <b>loop</b> shape during diastole. Conclusion Non-invasive assessment of left ventricular flow-volume relationship with echocardiography is technically feasible and reveals the existence of regional variation in <b>flow-volume</b> <b>loop</b> morphology. Valvular abnormalities cause a clear and specific alteration of the estimates of the normal systolic or diastolic flow-volume pattern, likely reflecting the underlying pathophysiology. </p...|$|E
30|$|After the {{occlusion}} maneuvers, {{the presence}} of flow limitation was assessed with manual compression of the abdomen [15 – 17]. The investigator put one hand gently on the patient’s abdomen, with the palm on the umbilicus, perpendicular to the axis between the xiphoid process and the pubis. After a short period, which allowed for recognition of the expiratory phase, the investigator exerted firm but gentle compression of the abdomen in an antero-posterior direction {{as soon as the}} insufflation was finished. This compression was maintained throughout expiration. The <b>flow-volume</b> <b>loops</b> obtained during passive expiration and during manual compression of the abdomen were superimposed, and flow limitation was diagnosed when {{all or part of the}} expiratory flow during manual compression of the abdomen and passive expiration was superimposed on the <b>flow-volume</b> <b>loops.</b> Three maneuvers were performed, and patients were classified as flow limited if flow limitation was confirmed in all three maneuvers.|$|R

40|$|The exercise-induced {{changes in}} the equine {{breathing}} pattern were studied by analyzing tidal breathing <b>flow-volume</b> <b>loops</b> recorded in ten ponies both at rest and during a standardized exercise. Airflow, tidal volume, esophageal pressure and mask pressure were simultaneously recorded before, during and after a treadmill exercise. From the collected data, respiratory frequency and total pulmonary resistance were calculated, tidal breathing <b>flow-volume</b> <b>loops</b> were retraced using a computerized method and loop indices were measured for each period of the experimental protocol. For each pony, results of three consecutive daily measurements were averaged. The exercise loop indices were compared with the corresponding resting values using a one-way analysis of variance. The significantly changed indices were correlated with respiratory frequency and total pulmonary resistance. Several types of respiratory patterns were observed at rest as well as during exercise, although each pony was relatively constant in its own pattern of breathing. Most resting inspiratory and expiratory airflow curves {{were found to be}} biphasic. When ponies started running, the airflow developed an increasingly rectangular pattern. During strenuous exercise, both inspiratory and expiratory airflow curves showed a substantial increase of the volume acceleration and tended to a plateau. The loop indices relating the expiratory to the inspiratory airflow were significantly increased compared with their rest values. Correlations of these indices with respiratory frequency and total pulmonary resistance were weak. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Aortic arch {{anomalies}} {{in infancy}} often cause intrathoracic airway obstruction. Airway function was assessed {{as part of}} the diagnostic evaluation in six symptomatic infants both by plethysmography and using a chest compression technique to obtain partial flow-volume loops. Two infants had normal intrathoracic airway function and their symptoms were unrelated to aortic arch abnormalities. The remaining four had complete vascular rings (three double aortic arch, one pulmonary sling) and had increased expiratory airway resistance (Raw) (mean Raw = 700 % predicted) and greatly decreased maximum flow rates at functional residual capacity (VmaxFRC; mean VmaxFRC = 34 % predicted) with gross shape abnormalities of the <b>flow-volume</b> <b>loop.</b> Postoperatively airway function was substantially improved (mean Raw = 175 % predicted, VmaxFRC = 79 % predicted) but some abnormality of <b>flow-volume</b> <b>loop</b> shape remained, suggesting that tracheal dynamics were not completely normal in the early postoperative period...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} {{to determine the effects}} of upper airway resistance (Rua) and elastance (Eua) on the mechanical parameters calculated from the expiratory limb of the passive flow-volume curve in normal infants, using a computer model. The model included separate compartments for the respiratory system, upper airway, and measurement equipment. Inclusion of Rua in the model decreased the slope of the expiratory limb of the <b>flow-volume</b> <b>loop,</b> and the resistance calculated from the <b>flow-volume</b> <b>loop</b> accurately reflected the total resistance of the model. Inclusion of Eua in the model caused a decrease in the end-inspiratory (driving) pressure and a corresponding decrease in the peak expiratory flow but did not alter the slope of the linear portion of the expiratory limb of the <b>flow-volume</b> <b>loop.</b> Resistance calculated from the loop underestimated true model resistance by 14. 5 %. However, further small fluctuations in Eua did not cause significant variability in the value of resistance calculated. Total elastance was accurately calculated whether or not Rua and Eua were included in the model. The results of this analysis demonstrate that, while Eua causes the true resistance to be underestimated, fluctuations in Eua are not likely to be an important source of variability in the mechanical parameters calculated from the passive flow-volume loop; however, any changes in Rua will be reflected in the value of resistance calculated and therefore are likely to cause substantial variability in the calculated resistance...|$|E

40|$|Study of the {{mechanical}} properties of the respiratory system is needed to help provide {{a better understanding of}} the pathogenesis of diseases causing respiratory failure. The nature of neonatal intensive care requires that any technique for monitoring respiratory mechanics be simple, noninvasive, and allow continued free access to the neonate. The peak airway pressure developed during volume cycled ventilation reflects {{the mechanical}} properties of the respiratory system but cannot distinguish between changes in the flow-resistive or elastic properties. Similarly, dynamic compliance combines both the flow-resistive and elastic components of the respiratory system in a single number and <b>flow-volume</b> <b>loops</b> also reflect both elements. Extracting a single time-constant from the expiratory limb of the latter assumes a single-compartment model for the respiratory system and, as such, does not provide sufficient information to describe frequency dependence of resistance and compliance. Furthermore, <b>flow-volume</b> <b>loops</b> are markedly distorted by the presence of an endotracheal tube, which must be corrected for, before calculating values of resistance and compliance. To provide the information to understand better the physiologic processes and adaptive mechanisms in diseased states causing acute respiratory failure, it is necessary to use a method that is based on a more detailed and realistic model of the respiratory system. Two such techniques that appear to warrant further investigation in ventilated infants are the interrupter technique and the forced-oscillation technique...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Patterns of {{pulmonary}} function tests (PFTs) and flow-volume loops {{among patients}} with clinically important tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) are not well described. Small studies suggest 4 main <b>flow-volume</b> <b>loop</b> morphologies: low maximum forced expiratory flow, biphasic expiratory curve, flow oscillations, and notching. We studied common PFT and <b>flow-volume</b> <b>loop</b> patterns among the largest prospective series of patients to date, undergoing clinical evaluation for symptomatic moderate to severe TBM. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from patients who were referred to our Chest Disease Center from January 2002 to December 2008, with respiratory symptoms that were attributed primarily to TBM. The PFT results of 90 subjects with symptomatic moderate to severe TBM were evaluated. RESULTS: By PFTs, 40 (44. 4 %) subjects had an obstructive ventilatory defect, 16 (17. 8 %) had a definite or highly likely restrictive ventilatory defect, 15 (16. 7 %) had a mixed defect, and 19 (21. 1 %) were within normal limits. Among 76 subjects with available flow-volume loops, the most frequent finding was low maximum forced expiratory flow, in 62 (81. 6 %) subjects, followed by biphasic morphology (15, 19. 7 %), notched expiratory loop (7, 9. 2 %), and expiratory oscillations (2, 2. 6 %). The balance of 13 subjects (17. 1 %) had no distinctive <b>flow-volume</b> <b>loop</b> abnormality. CONCLUSION: PFTs and flow-volume loops are normal in {{a substantial number of}} patients with moderate to severe TBM, and should not be used to decide whether TBM is present or clinically important...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Dyspnea is {{a common}} symptom in older people. A reduced forced expiratory volume in I second (FEV 1) is {{associated}} with a higher mortality rate from cardiovascular and respiratory disease, and increased admissions to hospitals. Underrecognized or undertreated airflow limitation may exacerbate the problem. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the prevalence and treatment of airflow limitation in a cohort of well-functioning older people. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Baseline of a clinical-epidemiological study of incident functional limitation. PARTICIPANTS: Participants attended the baseline examination of the Health, Aging, and Body Composition study, a prospective cohort study of 3, 075 well-functioning subjects age 70 to 79. MEASUREMENTS: Demographic and clinical data were collected by interview. Spirometry was performed unless contraindicated and repeated until three acceptable sets of <b>flow-volume</b> <b>loops</b> were obtained. Patients on bronchodilator medications had spirometry performed posttherapy. Blinded readers assessed the <b>flow-volume</b> <b>loops,</b> and inadequate tests were omitted from analysis. Airflow limitation was defined as a reduced forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity (FEV 1 /FVC) as determined by age-, sex-, and race-normalized values. Severity of airflow limitation was defined by American Thoracic Society criteria. RESULTS: Two thousand four hundred eighty-five subjects (80. 8 %) had assessable spirometry and data on treatment and diagnosis (1, 265 men, 1, 220 women). The mean age was 73. 6 years. Two hundred sixty-two subjects (10. 5 %) had airflow limitation; 43 (16. 4 %) of these never smoked. Only 37. 4 % of participants with airflow limitation and 55. 6 % of participants with severe airflow limitation reported a diagnosis of lung disease. Only 20. 5 % of subjects with at least moderate airflow limitation had used a bronchodilator in the previous 2 weeks. CONCLUSION: Despite their good functional status, airflow limitation was present, and underrecognized, in a considerable proportion of our older population. The low bronchodilator use suggests a significant reservoir of untreated disease.

Flow-volume loops were judged as abnormal if the FEF 50 /FIF 50 ratio was greater than 1 or if the sawtooth sign was judged to be present by {{at least two of}} three chest physicians. Detailed nocturnal recordings confirmed the presence of obstructive sleep apnoea in 17 of the 30 patients. Our results showed that both the sensitivity and the specificity of each of the flow-volume criteria for the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnoea were higher when the loops were recorded in the supine than when they were recorded in the sitting position. The sensitivities were low, however, even with the supine posture [...] sawtoothing 41 % and FEF 50 /FIF 50 ratio greater than 1 47 %. The highest sensitivity (71 %) was obtained by considering a positive result as being the presence of either of the abnormalities in either the sitting or the supine posture. This sensitivity of the <b>flow-volume</b> <b>loop</b> was too low to recommend it as a routine screening test for the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnoea but the presence of the sawtooth sign had a high specificity (92 %) for the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnoea. Furthermore, there was a greater fall in oxygen saturation in patients with apnoea who had sawtoothing than in those without sawtoothing. The presence of the sawtooth sign should increase the suspicion of sleep apnoea and suggest the need for further investigation.

METHODS: Twenty patients with asthma {{were recruited from}} Peking Union Medical College Hospital. <b>Flow-volume</b> <b>loop,</b> simultaneous asthma symptoms, and mood were monitored {{three times a day}} for consecutive 14 days. RESULTS: In patients with a normal daytime spirometry, marked decline of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) and peak expiratory flow (PEF) were observed at night and/or in the early morning. A within subject correlation analysis between FEV 1, PEF, and asthma symptoms showed that the correlation between symptoms and airway obstruction was found only in seven out of twenty patients (35 %). Four patients (20 %) reported many symptoms with nearly normal portable spirometry. Accordingly, their symptoms were not correlated with FEV 1 and PEF. This group of patients was defined as over-perceivers. On the contrary, another two patients (10 %) did not report any symptoms while obvious airways obstruction was recorded by a portable spirometry. These patients were defined as under-perceivers.

Static force, {{as well as the}} power produced during a single stroke were assessed at residual volume (RV), 25 %TLC, 50 %TLC, 75 %TLC, total lung capacity (TLC), and a self-selected lung volume (S-S). Lung volumes were derived from maximal <b>flow-volume</b> <b>loops</b> (MFVLs) and achieved using online real-time feedback. Inspiratory muscle fatigue (IMF) was induced by breathing against an inspiratory load equivalent to 80 % baseline maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), at a breathing frequency (fB) of 15 breaths per minute, and...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to {{identify}} and interpret the data provided by modern ventilators that provide the greatest clinical help in evaluating respiratory mechanics during mechanical ventilation. In intensive care, respiratory mechanics can be assessed in dynamic conditions (no flow-interruption) or static conditions (occlusion techniques) to record compliance and resistance and to monitor pressure, flow, and volume. Real-time visualization of the pressure curve is crucial for monitoring during volume-controlled ventilation, in which pressure is the dependent variable. Analysis of the pressure curve has little clinical utility during pressure-controlled ventilation, in which the dependent variable is the flow waveform, which varies according to changes in the mechanics of the respiratory system. Pressure-volume <b>loops</b> and <b>flow-volume</b> <b>loops</b> provide useful information on the dynamic trends of the respiratory system compliance and resistance, respectively. Modern ventilators provide complete monitoring of respiratory system mechanics, which is our guideline for optimizing ventilatory support and avoiding complications associated with mechanical ventilation...|$|R
