30|$|From {{the aerial}} parts of T. lythroides, Kabbaj et al. {{successfully}} isolated eight secondary metabolites, including the depsipeptide bassiatin (96); the coumarins daphenone (97) and daphnelone (98), the <b>dicoumarin</b> daphnoretin (99), the lignans; δ-sesamin (100) and wikstromol (101), the flavonoid glucoside trans-tiliroside (102), and the <b>dicoumarin</b> rutarensin (103) [59]. Although the isolated compounds were not {{tested by the}} authors of the aforementioned paper, it was suggested that δ-sesamin (100), wikstromol (101) and trans-tiliroside (102) might be considered as important chemotaxonomic markers of the species [59], a claim which is still under investigation.|$|E

40|$|Laurus nobilis L. is an {{evergreen}} dioecious, rarely monecious plant up to 15 m high. Its {{natural area}} includes Mediterranean countries. For {{a long time}} this plant has been actively cultivated as a decorative plant in (Europe, Russia, USA and others) {{as well as in}} Turkey, Algeria, Morocco, Spain, France, Italy, Portugal, Mexico and Russia. Chemical composition of the Laurus leaves include essential oil components, sesquiterpenic lactones and phenolic compounds as the principal active groups of compounds. The aim of the study was the identification of phenolic compounds in water and water alcohol extracts from leaves of Laurus nobilis. Materials and methods. Examinations of qualitative composition of phenolic complex in extracts from Laurus samples under study were carried out using «Hitachi Chromaster» high-performance liquid chromatographer with «Column Oven 5310 », «Pump 5110 » and «UV-detector 5410 ». Results and discussion. The samples of Laurus nobilis leaves gathered in outskirts of Alushta (Republic of Crimea) in July 2016 were the objects if the study. We identified caffeic, gallic, and chicoric acids, epigallocatechin gallate, luteolin- 7 -glycoside in the extracts obtained using ethanol 70 %. And caffeic, gallic, isoferulic acids, <b>dicoumarin,</b> epicatechin, kaempferol, and isoquercitrin in ethanol 40 % extracts. In water extracts we found the presence of ascorbic, gallic, and vanillic acids, epicatechin, quercetin- 3 -glycoside and kaempferol- 3 -galactoside. Conclusion. As the result of the Laurus nobilis leaves samples study, gathered in Alushta outskirts, ascorbic acid and 13 phenolic compounds were identified in water and water-alcohol (40 % and 70 %) extracts using high performance liquid chromatography. Isoferulic and chicoric acids, epigallocatechin gallate, <b>dicoumarin,</b> kaempferol, isoquercitrin, kaempferol- 3 -galactoside and luteolin- 7 -glycoside were identified in Laurus nobilis leaves for the first time.  </p...|$|E
40|$|Oxidative {{coupling}} reactions {{are a very}} powerful tool {{for the construction of}} e. g. biaryl compounds, especially because typically no functionalization of the coupling partners is necessary. The use of Au for this transformation is particularly attractive since usually no special precautions to exclude moisture or air are ne- cessary. Furthermore, the combination of oxidative {{coupling reactions}} with other Au-catalyzed reactions enables the rapid and efficient construction of molecular complexity, e. g. the constructions of <b>dicoumarins</b> via a domino cyclization oxidative coupling reaction...|$|R
40|$|Two-dimensional atom- and bond-based TOMOCOMD-CARDD {{descriptors}} and linear {{discriminant analysis}} (LDA) are used in this report to perform a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) study of tyrosinase-inhibitory activity. A database of inhibitors of the enzyme is collected for this study, within 246 highly dissimilar molecules presenting antityrosinase activity. In total, 7 discriminant functions are obtained by using the whole set of atom- and bond-based 2 D indices. All the LDA-based QSAR models show accuracies above 90 % in the training set {{and values of the}} Matthews correlation coefficient (C) varying from 0. 85 to 0. 90. The external validation set shows globally good classifications between 89 % and 91 % and C values ranging from 0. 75 to 0. 81. Finally, QSAR models are used in the selection/identification of the 20 new <b>dicoumarins</b> subset to search for tyrosinase inhibitory activity.

40|$|In {{this review}} an {{overview}} of the application of computational approaches is given. Specifically, the uses of Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) methods for in silico identification of new families of compounds as novel tyrosinase inhibitors are revised. Assembling, validation of models through prediction series, and virtual screening of external data sets are also shown, to prove the accuracy of the QSAR models obtained with the TOMOCOMD-CARDD (TOpological MOlecular COMputational Design Computer-Aided Rational Drug Design) software and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) as statistical technique. Together with this, a database is collected for these QSAR studies, and could be considered a useful tool in future QSAR modeling of tyrosinase activity and for scientists that work in the field of this enzyme and its inhibitors. Finally, a translation to real world applications is shown by the use of QSAR models in the identification and posterior in-vitro evaluation of different families of compounds. Several different classes of compounds from various sources (natural and synthetic) were identified. Between them, we can find tetraketones, cycloartanes, ethylsteroids, lignans, <b>dicoumarins</b> and vanilloid derivatives. Finally, some considerations are discussed in order to improve the identification of novel drug-like compounds based on the use of QSAR-Ligand-Based Virtual Screening (LBVS...|$|R
40|$|Ruta graveolens (rue) is a {{spontaneous}} {{plant in the}} Mediterranean area with a strong aroma and a very intense bitter taste, used in gastronomy and in folk medicine. From the leaves, stems and fruits of rue, we isolated rutin, rutamarin, three furanocoumarins, two quinolinic alkaloids, a <b>dicoumarin</b> and two long chain ketones. Bitter taste and chemesthetic properties have been evaluated by in vitro assays with twenty receptors of the TAS 2 R family and four TRP ion channels involved in gustation and nociception. Among the alkaloids, skimmianine was active as a specific agonist of T 2 R 14, whereas kokusaginin did not activate any of the tested receptors. The furanocoumarins activates TAS 2 R 10, 14, and 49 with different degrees of selectivity, {{as well as the}} TRPA 1 somatosensory ion channel. Rutamarin is an agonist of TRPM 5 and TRPV 1 and a strong antagonist of TRPM 8 ion channels...|$|E
40|$|A {{new group}} of oral {{anticoagulants}} (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban) with clear advantages over classic <b>dicoumarin</b> oral anticoagulants (warfarin and acenocoumarol) has been developed in recent years. Patients being treated with oral anticoagulants are at higher risk for bleeding when undergoing dental treatments. A literature search was conducted through April 2016 for publications in the ISI Web of Knowledge, PubMed and Cochrane Library using the keywords “dabigatran”, “rivaroxaban”, “apixaban”, “edoxaban”, “new oral anticoagulants”, “novel oral anticoagulants”, “bleeding” and “dental treatment”. There {{is no need for}} regular coagulation monitoring of patients on dabigatran therapy. Whether or not to temporarily discontinue dabigatran must be assessed according to the bleeding risk involved in the dental procedure to be performed. The number of patients under treatment with new oral anticoagulants will increase in the coming years. It is essential to know about the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of new oral anticoagulants and about their interactions with other drugs. It is necessary to develop clinical guidelines for the perioperative and postoperative management of these new oral anticoagulants in oral surgical procedures, and to carefully evaluate the bleeding risk of dental treatment, as well as the thrombotic risk of suppressing the new oral anticoagulant...|$|E

The main {{symptoms of}} bromadiolone poisoning are skin mucosa hemorrhage, digestive tract hemorrhage, and hematuresis. However, {{the symptoms of}} central nervous system toxicity have rarely been reported. Our case reports on a 41 -year-old male who had no contact with bromadiolone. His main symptoms were dizziness, unsteady gait, and abnormal behavior. Laboratory test results revealed the presence of bromadiolone in his blood and urine, a longer prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and a high international normalized ratio. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed that the bilateral posterior limb of the internal capsule, splenium of corporis callosum, and bilateral centrum semiovale formed symmetrical patch distribution. The patient gradually recovered after treated with vitamin K 1 and plasma transfusion. Our clinical study could {{pave the way to}} improve the detection of bromadiolone poisoning and avoid misdiagnosis. Keywords: bromadiolone, poisoning, central nervous system, superwarfari...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim is to}} {{evaluate}} periodontal alteration and biochemical markers associated with bone turnover in chronic oral with <b>dicoumarins</b> anticoagulant treatment patients. 80 patients treated with oral anticoagulants were divided into 2 cohort: Group A (n= 36) 6 month to 1 year with anticoagulant treatment and Group B (n= 44) > 2 years with anticoagulant treatment. Clinical evaluation included: Clinical attachment level (CAL), plaque index (PI) and gingival index (GI). Analytically biochemical parameters of bone remodeling (calcium and phosphorus), formation (total acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin) and resorption (tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase and beta-crosslaps) were evaluated. High values of PI (67 - 100 %) especially in men and in Group B were observed. Men with anticoagulation treatment length showed an increased GI (49. 167 vs 78. 083) while Group B women showed a decreased GI in comparison with Group A (59. 389 vs 42. 120). Women presented a greater average CAL than men as well as Group B vs Group A but without statistical significance. All biochemical markers were decreased respect to values of general population. Osteocalcin in GroupB women showed a statistically significant outcome vs GroupA (p= 0. 004). Acid phosphatase (total and tartrate-resistant) has {{a slight increase in}} Group B women versus Group A, and Beta-crosslap showed lower values in Group A men than Group B and slightly lower in Group A women versus Group B, without statistical significance. Patients showed a slight to moderate degree of periodontal affectation, especially gingivitis related to bacterial plaque. Periodontal disorders tended to be more severe in Group B. While bone remodeling showed an overall decrease with greater affectation of bone neoformation phenomena, bone destruction tended to recover and normalize in time...|$|R
40|$|Anticoagulation {{therapy is}} used in several {{conditions}} to prevent or treat thromboembolism. A new group of oral anticoagulants with clear advantages over classic <b>dicoumarin</b> oral anticoagulants (warfarin and acenocoumarol) has been developed in recent years. The Food and Drug Administration has approved edoxaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban. Their advantages include: predictable pharmacokinetics, drug interactions and limited food, rapid onset of action and short half-life. However, they lack a specific reversal agent. This paper examines the available evidence regarding rivaroxaban and sets out proposals for clinical guidance of dental practitioners treating these patients in primary dental care. A literature search was conducted through July 2016 for publications in PubMed and Cochrane Library using the keywords “edoxaban”, “dabigatran”, “rivaroxaban”, “apixaban”, “new oral anticoagulants”, “novel oral anticoagulants”, “bleeding” and “dental treatment” with the “and” boolean operator in the last 10 years. The number of patients taking edoxaban is increasing. There {{is no need for}} regular coagulation monitoring of patients on edoxaban therapy. For patients requiring minor oral surgery procedures, interruption of edoxaban is not generally necessary. Management of patients on anticoagulation therapy requires that dentists can accurately assess the patient prior to dental treatments. Their increased use means that oral care clinicians should have a sound understanding of the mechanism of action, pharmacology, reversal strategies and management of bleeding in patients taking edoxaban. There is a need for further clinical studies in order to establish more evidence-based guidelines for dental patients requiring edoxaban...|$|E
