40|$|Chronic {{obesity is}} a known {{risk factor for}} {{metabolic}} syndrome. However, {{little is known about}} pathological changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> intestine associated with chronic obesity. This study investigated cellular and subcellular level changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> intestine of obese mice. In this study, a mouse model of obesity was established by early postnatal administration of monosodium glutamate. Changes in body weight were monitored, and pathological changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> intestine were evaluated using hematoxylin-eosin and Nissl staining and light and electron microscopy. Consequently, obese mice were significantly heavier compared with controls from 9 weeks of age. Villi <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> intestine of obese mice were elongated and thinned. There was reduced hematoxylin staining <b>in</b> <b>the</b> epithelium of <b>the</b> <b>small</b> intestine of obese mice. Electron microscopy revealed a significant decrease in and shortening of rough endoplasmic reticulum in epithelial cells of <b>the</b> <b>small</b> intestine of obese mice compared with normal mice. <b>The</b> decrease <b>in</b> rough endoplasmic reticulum <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> intestine epithelial cells of obese mice indicates that obesity starting in childhood influences various functions of <b>the</b> <b>small</b> intestine, such as protein synthesis, and could impair both the defense mechanism against invasion of pathogenic microbes and nutritional absorption...|$|R

25|$|Distributive shock is {{a medical}} {{condition}} in which abnormal distribution of blood flow <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> blood vessels results in inadequate supply of blood to the body's tissues and organs.

Distributive shock is different from the other three categories of shock in that it occurs even though the output of the heart is at or above a normal level. The most common cause is sepsis leading to type of distributive shock called septic shock, a condition that can be fatal.|$|E

Also in 2003, the Contessa 32 Hurrying Angel won the Fastnet Race double handed division, crewed by Harry Allaway and Kathy Claydon. The most often mentioned exploit involving a Contessa 32, however, is the 1979 Fastnet race. A sudden storm of near hurricane strength brought death and destruction to the race, capsizing 25% of the 303 participating boats.

25|$|Dijkstra joined Burroughs Corporation, {{a company}} known {{at that time}} for the {{production}} of computers based on an innovative hardware architecture, as its Research Fellow in August 1973. His duties consisted of visiting some of the company's research centers a few times a year and carrying on his own research, which he did <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> Burroughs research facility, namely, his study {{on the second floor of}} his house in Nuenen. In fact, Dijkstra was the only research fellow of Burroughs Corporation and worked for it from home, occasionally travelling to its branches in the United States. As a result, he reduced his appointment at the university to one day a week. That day, Tuesday, soon became known as the day of the famous 'Tuesday Afternoon Club', a seminar during which he discussed with his colleagues scientific articles, looking at all aspects – notation, organisation, presentation, language, content, etc. Shortly after he moved in 1984 to the University of Texas at Austin (USA), a new 'branch' of the Tuesday Afternoon Club emerged in Austin.|$|E
25|$|The {{group of}} gorillas {{is led by}} one or more adult males. In cases where there are more than one silverback males in a group, they are most likely father and son. Groups {{containing}} only one male are believed to be the basic unit of the social group, gradually growing in size due to reproduction and new members migrating in. In the study done at Lope, gorillas harvest most of their food arboreally, but less than half of their night nests are built in trees. They are often found on the ground and are made up of up to 30 gorillas. Western lowland gorillas live <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> family groups of all gorillas, with an average of 4 to 8 members in each. The leader (the silverback) organizes group activities, like eating, nesting and travelling in their home range. Those who challenge this alpha male are apt to be cowed by impressive shows of physical power. He may stand upright, throw things, make aggressive charges, and pound his huge chest while barking out powerful hoots or unleashing a frightening roar. Despite these displays and the animals' obvious physical power, gorillas are generally calm and nonaggressive unless they are disturbed. Young gorillas, from three to six years old, remind human observers of children. Much of their day is spent in play, climbing trees, chasing one another and swinging from branches.|$|E

50|$|A part of {{ethyl alcohol}} is {{hydrophobic}}. This hydrophobic or lipophilic end can diffuse across cells that line <b>the</b> stomach wall. <b>In</b> fact, alcohol {{is one of}} the rare substances that can be absorbed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stomach. Most food substances are absorbed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> intestine. However, even though alcohol can be absorbed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stomach, it is mostly absorbed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> intestine because <b>the</b> <b>small</b> intestine has a large surface area that promotes absorption. Once alcohol is absorbed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> intestine, it delays the release of stomach contents from emptying into <b>the</b> <b>small</b> intestine. Thus, alcohol can delay the rate of absorption of nutrients. After absorption, alcohol reaches the liver where it is metabolized.|$|R
25|$|The R33 Skyline (Spec 2) {{continued}} the concepts {{introduced in the}} R32. Driver and Passenger airbags became standard in 1996. As a result, pre-1996 models are barred from being imported into various countries for consumer road use as they {{do not meet the}} frontal impact standards. (However, in the U.S., there are Federal Laws regarding safety and emissions that require certain documents to be obtained, certain criteria to be met and adhered to, or 25 years to pass, before the sale of this vehicle becomes legal.) For the RB25DET engine the ignition system was also changed, with the ignition module no longer located on the cam covers and was instead replaced by smart ignition coils (Ignitor built into coil) and ECU. The RB25DET's turbo was also given a nylon compressor wheel to improve response. Throughout the time the R33 was produced there were quite a number of different styled lights and bodykits fitted, the actual body/chassis underwent no changes. Among the cosmetic changes in the spec 2 were, the headlights which tapered down more towards the grill and were fitted with improved reflectors, the grill (which was longer on the Spec 1), the bonnet which had a re-shaped leading edge to fit the new lights and front bumper changing shape <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> amount to match the lower edge of the new headlights. Later models of the Spec 2 also had the option of having an Active-LSD fitted.|$|E
25|$|Street vendors crowd Eje 1 North and {{the side}} streets on either side in both the La Lagunilla and Tepito neighborhoods. Those closest to the fixed market {{buildings}} often sell items similar to that which is inside, and those located near the formal occasion shops emulate these as well. This informal market has grown such that vendors with stalls and vehicles now routinely block several of the main avenue’s six lanes. The problem begins from Comonfort Street, two blocks from Paseo de la Reforma. Here, vendors have taken over the lane dedicated to buses, with stands selling clothing, food, unlicensed CDs and DVDs and more. In some side streets, traffic is cut in half and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest,</b> there is no passage of vehicular traffic at all on weekends. In total, there are eleven city blocks severely affected by this. Cuauhtémoc borough authorities state {{that they do not}} have enough personnel to effect an eviction of the vendors. Earlier attempts to do this have resulted in threats to administration officials. Another issue is that many roving vendors sell beer and customers in the market proper can be seen drinking their purchases as they walk through the aisles. The most popular form of buying beer here is a “michelada” with a large bottle of beer (940ml) called a caguama emptied into a large cup and mixed with lime juice, salt and sometimes chili pepper and Worcestershire sauce. These vendors do not ask for proof of age. This informal market has made La Lagunilla one of the main centers for the production and sale of bootlegged CDs and DVDs.|$|E
