5|$|Placing the {{elements}} into categories and subcategories based on shared properties is imperfect. There is {{a spectrum of}} properties within each category and it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> find overlaps at the boundaries, {{as is the case}} with most classification schemes. Beryllium, for example, is classified as an alkaline earth metal although its amphoteric chemistry and tendency to mostly form covalent compounds are both attributes of a chemically weak or post-transition metal. Radon is classified as a nonmetal and a noble gas yet has some cationic chemistry that is more characteristic of a metal. Other classification schemes are possible such as the division of {{the elements}} into mineralogical occurrence categories, or crystalline structures. Categorizing the elements in this fashion dates back to at least 1869 when Hinrichs wrote that simple boundary lines could be drawn on the periodic table to show elements having like properties, such as the metals and the nonmetals, or the gaseous elements.|$|E

25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> check, {{using the}} above {{explicitly}} descriptions of H1 and H2 {{that for every}} nontrivial gnbsp&∈nbsp&H1 we have g(X2)nbsp&⊆nbsp&X1 and that for every nontrivial gnbsp&∈nbsp&H2 we have g(X1)nbsp&⊆nbsp&X2. Using the alternative form of the ping-pong lemma, for two subgroups, given above, we conclude that Hnbsp&=nbsp&H1∗H2. Since the groups H1 and H2 are infinite cyclic, it follows that H is a free group of rank two.|$|E

25|$|A pointed pseudotriangulation can {{be defined}} as a finite non-crossing {{collection}} of line segments, such that at each vertex the incident line segments span an angle of at most π, and such that no line segments can be added between any two existing vertices while preserving this property. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> see that a pointed pseudotriangulation is a pseudotriangulation of its convex hull: all convex hull edges may be added while preserving the angle-spanning property, and all interior faces must be pseudotriangles else a bitangent line segment could be added between two vertices of the face.|$|E
25|$|Based on the {{analysis}} above, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> {{conclude that the}} threat of revolution constantly incentivizes the rich to democratize. The theory also resonates with Clark, Golder and Golder's paper Power and Politics: Insights from an Exist, Voice and Loyalty Game, in which the government decides between predate and not to predate citizens based on the payoff while the citizen has the option to exit (migrate to other countries), remain loyal and voice their concerns at a cost (protest). Similarly, this game also provides insights into how variables like exit payoff, cost of voicing and value of loyalty change state's behavior {{as to whether or not}} to predate.|$|E
25|$|Negative {{criticism}} of Mann's works <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> find. One of her detractors, Pat Robertson of the Christian Broadcasting Network, {{has said that}} “selling photographs of children in their nakedness for profit is an exploitation of the parental role and I think it’s wrong.” He views such work {{as a violation of}} the responsibility of parents to do everything in their power to protect, shelter, and nurture their children. More negative criticism came from Raymond Sokolov’s article Critique: Censoring Virginia in the Wall Street Journal. He questioned whether children should be photographed nude and whether federal funds should be appropriated for such artworks. Accompanying his article was a modified image by Mann of her daughter Virginia (Virginia at 4), in which her eyes, nipples, and pubic region were now covered with black bars. Mann said he used the image without permission “to illustrate that {{this is the kind of}} thing that shouldn’t be shown.” She was devastated and insulted that someone could mutilate her photograph that way. Virginia was also upset about the article. She wrote a letter to the author saying “Dear Sir, I don’t like the way you crossed me out.” Mann said that after Virginia saw the article, she started touching herself on the areas that were blacked out, saying, “what’s wrong with me?” It was somewhat difficult for Mann to understand the harsh {{criticism of}} these photographs, for she did not stage these moments — instead when she saw a photo opportunity unfolding, she simply asked her children stop moving until she could capture it. When Mann was young, she was often nude, so she raised her children similarly.|$|E
