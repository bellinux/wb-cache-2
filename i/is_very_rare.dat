5|$|Corals' {{many colors}} give it appeal for {{necklaces}} and other jewelry. Intensely red coral is prized as a gemstone. Sometimes called fire coral, {{it is not}} the same as fire coral. Red coral <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>rare</b> because of overharvesting.|$|E
5|$|Like other {{transition}} metals, zirconium forms a {{wide range}} of inorganic compounds and coordination complexes. In general, these compounds are colourless diamagnetic solids wherein zirconium has the oxidation state +4. Far fewer Zr(III) compounds are known, and Zr(II) <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>rare.</b>|$|E

5|$|Falco peregrinus furuitii, {{described}} by Momiyama in 1927, is {{found on the}} Izu and Ogasawara Islands south of Honshū, Japan. It is non-migratory. It <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>rare,</b> and may only remain on a single island. It is a dark form, resembling pealei in colour, but darker, especially on tail.|$|E
5|$|Structure 5C-49 {{possesses}} a clear Teotihuacan-linked architectural style; it has balustrades, an architectural feature that <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>rare</b> in the Maya region, and a talud-tablero façade; it {{dates to the}} 4th century AD. It is located near to the Lost World pyramid.|$|E

5|$|The crew on a bulker {{typically}} {{consists of}} 20 to 30people, though smaller ships {{can be handled}} by 8. The crew includes the captain or master, the deck department, the engineering department, and the steward's department.

5|$|Acquisition {{of second}} and {{additional}} languages can come at any age, through exposure {{in daily life}} or courses. Children learning a second language {{are more likely to}} achieve native-like fluency than adults, but in general, it <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>rare</b> for someone speaking a second language to pass completely for a native speaker. An important difference between first language acquisition and additional language acquisition is that the process of additional language acquisition is influenced by languages that the learner already knows.|$|E
5|$|Diseases, accidents, hunters, automobiles, and {{starvation}} are {{the other}} leading causes of death. Juveniles show high mortality shortly after leaving their mothers, while still perfecting their hunting techniques. One study of 15 bobcats showed yearly survival rates for both sexes averaged 0.62, in line with other research suggesting rates of 0.56 to 0.67. Cannibalism has been reported; kittens may be taken when prey levels are low, but this <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>rare</b> and does not much influence the population.|$|E

5|$|It is {{possible}} to record two outs {{in the course of}} the same play. This is called a double play. Even three outs in one play, a triple play, {{is possible}}, though this <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>rare.</b> Players put out or retired must leave the field, returning to their team's dugout or bench. A runner may be stranded on base when a third out is recorded against another player on the team. Stranded runners do not benefit the team in its next turn at bat as every half-inning begins with the bases empty of runners.|$|E
5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>rare</b> {{for snow}} {{to fall in}} the U.S. state of Florida, {{especially}} in the central and southern portions of the state. With {{the exception of the}} far northern areas {{of the state and the}} Jacksonville area, most of the major cities of Florida have never recorded measurable snowfall, have only recorded trace (T) amounts, or have only reported flurries in the air, usually just a few times each century. In the Florida Keys and Key West there is no known occurrence of snow flurries since the settlement of the region.|$|E
5|$|The first {{description}} of B.nothofagi {{was published in}} 2012 by Jerry A. Cooper and Patrick Leonard. DNA studies of the fungus {{suggest that it is}} a somewhat basal member of the genus Boletopsis. The fungus is most likely a native species of New Zealand and was present there before the arrival of Europeans. As it <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>rare</b> and possibly threatened, B.nothofagi is listed in the Red List of Threatened Species as an endangered species.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} adverse effect of {{metformin}} is gastrointestinal irritation, including diarrhea, cramps, nausea, vomiting, and increased flatulence; metformin is more {{commonly associated with}} gastrointestinal side effects than most other antidiabetic drugs. The most serious potential side effect of metformin use is lactic acidosis; this complication <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>rare,</b> {{and the vast majority}} of these cases seem to be related to comorbid conditions, such as impaired liver or kidney function, rather than to the metformin itself.|$|E
5|$|The {{song thrush}} is {{occasionally}} {{a host of}} parasitic cuckoos, such as the common cuckoo, but this <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>rare</b> because the thrush recognizes the cuckoo's non-mimetic eggs. However, the song thrush does not demonstrate the same aggression toward the adult cuckoo that is shown by the blackbird. The introduced birds in New Zealand, where the cuckoo does not occur, have, over the past 130years, retained the ability to recognise and reject non-mimetic eggs.|$|E
5|$|Under {{ordinary}} {{conditions on}} Earth, elemental hydrogen exists as the diatomic gas, H2. However, hydrogen gas <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>rare</b> in the Earth's atmosphere (1 ppm by volume) {{because of its}} light weight, which enables it to escape from Earth's gravity more easily than heavier gases. However, hydrogen is the third most abundant element on the Earth's surface, mostly {{in the form of}} chemical compounds such as hydrocarbons and water. Hydrogen gas is produced by some bacteria and algae and is a natural component of flatus, as is methane, itself a hydrogen source of increasing importance.|$|E

5|$|Adult coconut crabs have {{no known}} predators {{apart from other}} coconut crabs and humans. Its large size {{and the quality of}} its meat means that the coconut crab is {{extensively}} hunted and <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>rare</b> on islands with a human population. The coconut crab is eaten by Southeast Asians and Pacific Islanders and is considered a delicacy and an aphrodisiac, and intensive hunting has threatened the species' survival in some areas. While the coconut crab itself is not innately poisonous, it may become so depending on its diet, and cases of coconut crab poisoning have occurred. For instance, consumption of the sea mango Cerbera manghas by the coconut crab may make the coconut crab toxic due to the presence of cardiac cardenolides.|$|E
5|$|Decompression {{sickness}} (DCS) {{occurs when}} gas, {{which has been}} breathed under high pressure and dissolved into the body tissues, forms bubbles as the pressure is reduced on ascent from a dive. The results may range from pain in the joints where the bubbles form to blockage of an artery leading to damage to the nervous system, paralysis or death. While bubbles can form anywhere in the body, DCS is most frequently observed in the shoulders, elbows, knees, and ankles. Joint pain occurs in about 90% of DCS cases reported to the U.S. Navy, with neurological symptoms and skin manifestations each present in 10% to 15% of cases. Pulmonary DCS <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>rare</b> in divers. The table below classifies the effects by affected organ and bubble location.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Burns falls {{ill with}} hypohemia (a fictional {{condition}} in which the body naturally runs out of blood, though it is akin to a real condition called hypovolemia) and needs a blood transfusion. His blood type, double O negative, <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>rare,</b> however, {{and none of the}} employees at Springfield Nuclear Power Plant have it. Homer discovers that Bart has double O negative blood and urges his son to donate, promising that he will be handsomely rewarded. Bart reluctantly agrees and his blood donation saves Mr. Burns' life. Mr. Burns is rejuvenated by the blood and he sends the Simpson family a thank you card. Enraged at Mr. Burns' paltry gesture, Homer writes an insulting reply, but Marge convinces him at the last minute not to send it. The next morning, Homer discovers that the letter is gone as Bart has mailed it.|$|E
