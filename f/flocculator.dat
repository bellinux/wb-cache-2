40|$|Abstract. The {{continuous}} <b>flocculator</b> {{described in}} this article refers to a kind of continuous flocculation device designed to flocculate fermentation liquid. The honeycomb continuous <b>flocculator</b> is composed of a vessel and built-in trapezoid subassemblies, which divide the space within the vessel into multiple honeycomb channels. The length ratio between the longest diagonal of the regular hexagon and the axial length of the channel is within the range 0. 01 – 0. 04; and the internal surface roughness (Ra) of the channels should be 0 < Ra ≤ 0. 2 µm. In contrast to current <b>flocculator</b> designs, the channels of the honeycomb continuous <b>flocculator</b> could control the floc grain size, grain fineness distribution in the fermentation liquid and flocculating time and decrease the flow resistance of the flocculating fermentation liquid and increase handling capacity.

40|$|The {{principal}} {{focus of}} this paper is to present a critical review of current approaches to modelling the inter-related hydrodynamic, physical and chemical processes involved in the flocculation of water using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The flows inside both laboratory and full scale mechanically- mixed <b>flocculators</b> are complex and pose significant challenges to modellers. There exists a body of published work which considers the bulk flow patterns, primarily at laboratory scale. However, there is little reported multiphase modelling at either scale. Two-equation turbulence modelling has been found to produce variable results in comparison with experimental data, due to the anisotropic nature of the swirling flow. However, the computational expense of combining the sliding mesh treatment for a rotating mesh with the Reynolds Stress Model (RSM) in a full scale unit is great, even when using a high performance computing facility. Future work should focus more on the multiphase modelling aspects. Whilst opportunities exist for particle tracking using a Lagrangian model, few workers have attempted this. The fractal nature of flocs poses limitations on the accuracy of the results generated and, in particular, the impacts of density and porosity on drag force and settlement characteristics require additional work. There is significant scope for the use of coupled population balance models and CFD to develop water treatment flocculation models. Results from related work in the wastewater flocculation field are encouraging...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: It {{is often}} seen that {{conventional}} water treatment plants are not necessarily cost effective, specifically for smaller units up to 3 MLD.

Its research and development team focuses on improving flocculation, and other processes that are used, and making them as cost effective {{and easy to use}} as possible. One of the current design focuses is flocculation and the parameters that affect it. Specifically G (1 /s), the velocity gradient, G-theta, a dimensionless measure of mixing, and alum dose. This past spring the vertical flow pilot plant team designed and built a hydraulic vertical flow <b>flocculator.</b> The <b>flocculator</b> is a small scale version of a <b>flocculator</b> that has been built in Ojojona, Honduras. It is a square tank that has been divided into three sections and consists of alternating baffles spaced evenly to produce a uniform G of 45 1 /s. The flow through the tank is serpentine and is at a flow rate of 114 L/min. The original design of the tank was meant to be easily disassembled, with the baffles and dividers being separate modules from the tank. Sampling and testing of the tank was done through glass tube settlers attached to a pump and fed through turbidimeters. These could be moved to sample at different locations and give a reading of settled water turbidity. When the tank first became operational several problems were discovered with the <b>flocculator</b> and the tube settlers. The biggest of the problems was short circuiting which was discovered by visual observation of the tank as well as head loss measurements. The calculated head loss through the tank was around 11 cm while the original measured head loss was only 2 cm. These short circuits were fixed with Kwik Foam, caulk, and sand in order to seal the gaps and make them water proof. Another problem was divider bowing which when fixed by clamping 2 x 4 s {{to the edge of the}} dividers to straighten them out, the head loss rose to 7 cm. It appears with the module design of the baffles that this head loss is the greatest achievable head loss and corresponds to a G of 30 1 /s with a G-theta of 22, 630. Preliminary testing showed that this design was capable of producing water under 1 NTU with a derived alum dose equation at low turbidities.

However, current knowledge regarding the proper design and operation of hydraulic flocculation systems is insufficient. Of particular interest to the AguaClara research team is the optimal fluid shear level needed to produce low turbidity water. The Flocculation Residual Turbidity Analyzer (FReTA) was developed as tool for measuring the floc sedimentation velocity distribution and the post-sedimentation residual turbidity of a flocculated suspension. These two properties are central to the design and operation of unit processes following flocculation in a water treatment plant. FReTA measures the turbidity of a flocculent suspension undergoing quiescent sedimentation. The fixed distance across which flocs must travel to clear the measurement volume in FReTA allows sedimentation velocities to be calculated from the raw turbidity data. By fitting the transformed turbidity data with a modified gamma distribution, the mean and variance of the sedimentation velocity distribution can be obtained along with the post-sedimentation residual turbidity. A hydraulic tube <b>flocculator</b> was used to study how fluid shear levels affect the settling properties of a flocculated alum-kaolin suspension.

The gravel-bed <b>flocculator</b> provide a simple and inexpensive design for flocculation in small water treatment plants (less than 5000 m 3 /day capacity). The packed bed of gravel provides ideal conditions for the formation of compact settleable flocs because of continuous recontact provided by the sinuous flow of water through the interstices formed by the gravel. The field data which were obtained from the operation of the water supply treatment unit cover the physical, chemical and biological water qualities of the raw and settled water as obtained by the operation of the treatment unit. The experiments were carried out with the aim of assessing the efficiency of the gravel filter in removing the turbidity, pathogenic bacteria, from the raw water. The water treatment plant, which was constructed for the treatment of river water, was in principle a rapid sand filter. The results show that the average value of the turbidity level of the settled water was 4. 83 NTU {{with a standard deviation of}} turbidity 2. 893 NTU. This indicated that the removal efficiency of the sedimentation tank (gravel filter) was about 67. 8 %. for pH values fluctuated between 7. 75 and 8. 15, indicating the alkaline nature of the raw water of the river Shatt Al-Hilla, as expected.

40|$|Water is {{precious}} for every living being. It covers almost 75 % of the earth's surface, t Only about 3 % {{of the water}} on earth exists as fresh-water {{and most of it}} is not easily available to men. Freshwater sources are polluted by activities of men, animals and by natural disasters. Water pollution is dominated by industrial and domestic wastes through channels and drains. Treating this water to meet standards of drinking quality is a huge task and a costly process. ^ Many countries face the problem of providing safe drinking water rapidly when faced with disaster situations like thousands of refugees as a result of civil disturbances, or natural disasters such as tsunami-related events, earthquakes, landslides, droughts or in an event of floods. The main issue is to construct water treatment plants which are heavy concrete structures in a shorter period of time in a limited land space. •The R & D section of the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (N. W. S. & D. B) has designed and fabricated a moveable water treatment plant using locally available materials and expertise within an affordable capital cost. Three of these mobile type water treatment plants have being installed in Pugoda, Mahiyangana and Allauwwa. This type of water treatment plants can dismantle into separate sections. They are fabricated steel tanks as middle stages of water treatment plant array. These sections can be transported to another place, re-assembled and re-located. The Pugoda plant has a mechanical flash mixer and three speed mechanical tapered flocculators. Flocculating is done by four paddle rotors rotated by geared motors in three speeds in three adjacent tanks. These paddle wheels (rotors) are mounted on a horizontal axis * inside the tank. The two ends of axel are sealed and supported by two end bearings housed beside the tank steel wall. This arrangement of the paddle wheels gives many operational and maintenance difficulties when dismantling the bearings and water seals. Very frequently chemically mixed water leaks through the water seals and bearings. This leads to reduce productivity by reducing bearing life, equipment safety and increasing down time, power requirement and operational cost. It needs a substantial quantity of water to remove the sludge in the bottom bed by washing them out. The objective of this special study is to study the ways and means of improving the present installation arrangements of <b>flocculator</b> paddle wheels and to propose an alternative arrangement eliminating above operational difficulties. Objective is to find an efficient alternative mechanical <b>flocculator</b> system to be used in package-type water treatment plants. This report discusses about conventional water treatment arrangement, a brief study of floe forming phenomena, specification of the mobile water treatment plant, <b>flocculator</b> types and other arrangement types of mechanical flocculators used elsewhere in the world. The report includes theoretical aspects of power requirement for rotating paddles. The study also proposes a vertical arrangement of flocculating.

To study the relationship among floc structure, strength, size distribution, and fractal dimensions, the alum-kaolin flocs formed under different coagulation stages and mechanisms were investigated at various agitation rates. A new method based on the fractal theory was employed to analyze the strength of flocs. The relationship between fractal dimensions and floc size distribution was then discussed with controlled experiments, providing comparison between calculation results of the new method and the strength factor as well. The results show that both size and fractal dimension of flocs decrease with increasing shear rate. The floc strength follows the hierarchy: gradually increased shear rate from 40 rpm to 60 rpm > stable 60 rpm shear rate > gradually decreased shear rate from 60 rpm to 40 rpm > stable 40 rpm shear rate. Flocs formed under gradual shear increasing could easily re-flocculate and recover their strength after breakage. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

L'effet de plusieurs paramètres (vitesse de filtration, dose de sulfate d'aluminium et intensité d'agitation) sur la performance du procédé a été étudié. Des efficacités de rétention de phosphore supérieures à 80 % ont été obtenues pour des vitesses de filtration de 5 et 10 m/h. La filtration en ligne est applicable à 5 m/h mais devient beaucoup moins efficace à 10 m/h. Le rapport massique Al/P= 2 est optimal et indépendant de la vitesse de filtration ainsi que de l'intensité d'agitation dans le floculateur. Phosphates and nitrates are {{the main}} nutrients responsible for disturbing aquatic ecosystem balance. In general, high levels of phosphate and nitrogen cause increases in algal proliferation, which has negative effects on water quality - the phenomenon is known as eutrophication. While nitrogen is in great quantities in the atmosphere, the sources of phosphorus are limited to two main sources: domestic waste waters and chemical fertilizers. Phosphorus is often known as the limiting factor {{for the growth of}} the algae in the aquatic areas. The usual biological processes (activated sludge) are not very efficient in the removal of phosphorus from waste water (efficiency of less than 50 %). Alternative biological processes require certain conditions that are difficult to create in practice. For that reason, we thought it useful to explore another alternative, based on a combination of the precipitation-flocculation of phosphorus by metallic cations brought by alum (aluminium sulfate) and direct filtration through a sand bed. The aim of this work was to study the effect of filtration velocity, mass ratio (Al/P), and velocity gradient (G) on phosphorus removal efficiency in the <b>flocculator.</b> To this effect, a pilot-scale unit was set up. It consisted of one glass column (2 m long, with an inner diameter of 30 mm) that was filled with sand (0. 85 m). The volumetric mass of sand and the porosity of the bed were 2. 62 g/cm 3 and 0. 44 respectively. The synthetic water used was obtained by dissolution of potassium dihydrogen-phosphate in tap water. The characteristics of this water were as follows: turbidity (varied from 0. 5 to 1 NTU); pH 7 - 8; electric conductivity of 450 - 550 µS/cm; temperature fixed at 25 °C; a phosphorus concentration 2 mg/L. The pH of coagulation was adjusted to 6. 5 and the flocculation time was 10 min. The filtration cycle was arbitrarily fixed at 9 h. The first sample was taken 15 min after the start of the experiment and subsequent sampling was carried out every hour. Once the filtration phase was terminated, the filter was back-washed (combined air-water). The efficiency of phosphorus removal by direct filtration was determined by measurements of residual phosphorus, final turbidity and total head loss in the bed. The results obtained show that : - Phosphorus removal efficiency is strongly related to the filtration velocity. - A mass ratio Al/P= 2 seems optimal for the two velocities tested (5 and 10 m/h). For the ratio Al/P= 3, we can see an increase in head loss and an increased turbidity in the filtered water, without any improvement in phosphorus retention. The increased turbidity is caused by the formation of fine particles of aluminium hydroxide and/or aluminium orthophosphate. - When the filtration velocity is 5 m/h, the mixing intensity (G) in the <b>flocculator</b> does not increase the removal efficiency of phosphorus. The efficiencies at G= 0 (in line filtration) and G= 50 s- 1 are similar and development of head loss is essentially the same in both cases. Mixing in the <b>flocculator</b> becomes necessary when the filtration velocity is 10 m/h. In line filtration is much less efficient. - Intense mixing (G> 100 s- 1) had no beneficial effect on phosphorus removal, but rather led to a decrease in filtration time...|$|E

40|$|Drinking water {{production}} with low-pressure hollow-fibre membranes {{is becoming}} increasingly more widespread as replacement for conventional separation technology. Upstream coagulation can mitigate fouling layer formation on membranes and allows removal of colloidal and soluble compounds smaller than the membrane pores. However, integrating membrane systems with coagulation bears the risk of impaired system performance due to unfavourable aggregate characteristics. This is of particular importance when treating humic substances due to their strong dependence on the solution environment. The experimental work in this study aimed at finding optimal coagulation, flocculation, and membrane operating conditions for treating a typically Nordic surface water with high humic content. Commercial aluminium-based coagulants and chitosan were applied in the pre-treatment step. Short, controlled flocculation was achieved by using a pipe, jet-mix, or packed-bed <b>flocculator.</b> An outside-in operated ultrafiltration system based on a polymeric hollow-fibre was used as separation unit. The study showed that optimized coagulation conditions are crucial to successful operation of the membrane unit. For the applied raw water (colour 50 mg Pt/L), a specific aluminium dosage of 3 mg Al/L and a coagulation pH {{in the range of}} 6 – 6. 5 were found optimal with respect to permeate quality, membrane operation, and metal residuals. Coagulant dosages exceeding the optimal dosage and a pH drop increased hydraulically not-reversible fouling significantly. Chitosan neither met the expectations for NOM removal for the investigated raw water nor did its use seem favourable in combination with a polymeric membrane. Controlling floc aggregation can reduce pressure increase rates on the hollowfibre membrane provided that flocculators are designed for low velocity gradients (G< 30 s− 1). The packed-bed <b>flocculator</b> outperformed the other flocculators. However, flocculation times longer than 5 minutes should be applied to avoid rapid backwash pressure increases on the membrane. The membrane system was operated with fluxes in the range of 45 – 75 LMH during filtration and a 1. 5 times higher value during backwashes. Forward filtration without air scouring proved feasible. To improve detachment of fouling layers, vigorous air scouring was used during backwashes. A filtration cycle of 30 – 60 minutes followed by a backwash interval of about 30 seconds gave good results. Increasing coagulant dosage and flux were the two most significant contributors to hydraulically non-reversible fouling. Water recovery only had a minor effect on the pressure development of the membrane. However, the results suggest that efficient sludge removal from the immersion tank is of importance. Operation at lower NOM concentrations left pressure increase rates unchanged, rendering the application potential of the system highest for NOM-rich surface waters. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E
40|$|A laboratory-scale reactor {{was used}} to {{simulate}} a water treatment process sequence of rapid mix, hydraulic flocculation, upflow clarification with a floc blanket, and lamellar sedimentation to accomplish removal of colloidal particles. This process sequence, followed by chlorination, has been employed to create affordable designs for water treatment in the Global South. This study focused on variables affecting performance of the floc blanket including: condition of hydraulic flocculation, raw water turbidity, coagulant dose, upflow velocity through the floc blanket, floc blanket height, and bulk density and solids concentration of the floc blanket. An upflow clarifier velocity between 90 - 110 m/day produced the best floc blanket performance for most influent turbidities studied. The results show that particle removal efficiency in lamellar sedimentation improved linearly with respect to floc blanket heights up to 45 cm. Improved performance is also correlated with increased hydraulic <b>flocculator</b> residence time and energy dissipation rate. At floc blanket heights above 45 cm, there is still improvement in performance for most cases, but improved performance and blanket height no longer follow a linear relationship. Lamellar sedimentation with a capture velocity of 10 m/day is a key component in improving clarifier performance when utilizing a floc blanket. Future {{studies are needed to}} determine mechanisms of particle removal in a floc blanket. ii...|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] The {{porosities}} of flocs {{formed from}} a used drilling mud {{were determined by}} measuring sizes and settling speeds of individual f ocs. These flocs were produced in a Couette-type <b>flocculator</b> {{under a variety of}} combinations of fluid shear and solid concentrations. In the calculation of floc porosities, a floc settling model was employed that can consider the effects of creeping flow through afloc on its settling speed. Results how that floc structure can be well described as a fractal with a fractal dimension of 1. 53 - 1. 64 for the floc size range tested. The effects of flocculation conditions, uch as fluid shear and solid concentration, onfloc porosity and structure were examined. It was found that floc porosity and fractal dimension were not influenced by solid concentration, but they increased as fluid shear decreased. Em-pirical expressions for the porosity of drilling mud flocs are obtained from both the floc settling model and Stokes ' law. For solid volume fraction in flocs, the relative difference between these two expressions could be as much as 38 %. However, the fractal dimensions e timated based on the two settling models are nearly the same. Key Words [...] Drilling mud, Flocs, Fractal, Porosity...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{measurement}} of the local concentration of suspended particles within settling multiphase systems is important to many engineering applications; particularly for example in gravitational thickeners used extensively in minerals processing and water treatment. The ability to monitor concentration and stratification in situ may greatly aid in developing efficient separators and allow more accurate modeling of these processes. Acoustic backscatter systems (ABS) are a practical and relatively inexpensivecharacterization technique, {{with the ability to}} profile particle concentration as a function of depthin operationalenvironments. Currently, such instruments are only used for sedimentology studies in dilute estuarine flows as their application in concentrated industrial suspensions is significantly more complicated and largely unstudied. A novel application is reported herein investigating the use of an ABS to characterize a model mineral separation system, utilizing a bespoke continuous flow laboratory scale thickener with inline pipe <b>flocculator.</b> A 1 MHz probe mounted in the near-bed region of the thickener was used to measure consolidated bed build-up and segmented density changes from the signal decay. Importantly, the influence of a scraper-rake on solids densification was observed by analyzing systems at two different scraper rotation speeds (0. 1 and 1. 1 rpm). An optimal rotation speed was observed that led to enhanced underflow solids fractions. Higher speeds led to an assumed fluidization of the bed from secondary flows, which reduced bed densities {{in the vicinity of the}} scraper...|$|E
40|$|Concentric {{rotating}} cylinder and turbulent mixing devices have been frequently used in studying mixing and particle coagulation. However, these apparatus develop simple laminar flow (concentric {{rotating cylinder}}s) {{or do not}} have well-defined flow (turbulent mixing devices). In this work, the eccentric rotating cylinder apparatus was investigated to find applicability for the improved study of coagulation based on the modified analytical solution of Ballal and Rivlin. Various eccentricity ratios, rotation speeds and viscosities were simulated to obtain optimum operating conditions. Inertial forces working on the fluid increased as the eccentricity ratio and rotation speed increase. As inertial forces increase, the eddy developed in wide clearance was more skewed {{in the direction of}} rotation. Both root-mean-square velocity gradient and average principal strain-rate, were increased by increasing eccentricity ratio. avaerage principal strain-rate were linearly increased as rotation speed increases, which suggested that average prinipal strain-rate can properly represent mixing intensity. Comparison of average principal strain-rate and RMS velocity gradient revealed that RMS velocity gradient overestimated mixing intensity and its error increased as eccentricity ratio increases. This study showed that the eccentric rotating cylinder apparatus has a non-uniform velocity distribution with well-defined fluid dynamics. Therefore, the eccentric rotating cylinder apparatus can be applicable as a model <b>flocculator.</b> However, in order to achieve reliable model predictability, the fluid Reynolds number must be below 200...|$|E
40|$|A flocculator-imaging {{system was}} {{developed}} to characterize the dynamics of particle size distribution (PSD) during flocculation. The system consisted of a <b>flocculator</b> coupled with an external flow-through cell for observation and photography, a microscopic charge-coupled device video recorder with backlighting, and an image analyzer. This nonintrusive side-stream setup was used to record {{the evolution of the}} PSD to determine the flocculation dynamics of three types of particle systems: Clean kaolin, kaolin coated with natural organic matter (NOM), and the kaolin/NOM system after ozonation. In addition to the PSD measurement, the potential, NOM reduction, and turbidity removal after the jar test of flocculation and sedimentation were determined for the particle systems at various alum dosages. The results of the -potential analysis and the PSD measurement indicated that flocculation takes place rapidly to form highly porous aggregates when the particle surface charge is fully neutralized. The adsorption of NOM on the particle surface stabilized the particles considerably, and thus hindered the flocculation process. Sweep flocculation using a much higher alum dosage was an effective means of process enhancement for the removal of particulates and associated organic matter. Ozonation of the kaolin/NOM solution, however, did not appear to have any positive effect on particle destabilization and flocculation. It is argued that ozonation produced more acidic functional groups in the NOM on kaolin, which increased the surface charge density and hence the stability of the particles in softer water. © 2008 ASCE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Natural {{surface water}} {{contains}} {{a wide range}} of impurities, mostly arising from weathering and human activities. The availability of safe water, and in particular safe drinking water, {{is one of the most}} important determinants of our general health. The removal of suspended matter from water is one of the major goals of drinking water treatment. Effective clarification is really necessary for completely reliable disinfection because microorganisms are shielded by particles in the water. Coagulation, flocculation and clarification, followed by rapid gravity sand filtration, are the main steps in conventional water treatment systems. Colloidal particles and other finely divided matter are brought together and agglomerated to form larger size particles that can subsequently be removed in a more efficient fashion. The increase in the contact mass increases the probability that collisions will take place inside the <b>flocculator</b> resulting in a more efficient flocculation. Therefore, the intentional introduction of preformed floc or sludge into the mixing and flocculation stage is a feature of most proprietary water treatment equipment. The aim of study is to explore the wealth of literature to present the new trends of the conventional drinking water treatment that is continuously evolving, especially clarification enhancement and acceleration by solids contact increase. The study will experimentally demonstrate the possibility of turbidity removal enhancement, by increasing the contact mass with adding a sludge dosage during flocculation process. The raw water turbidity removal was investigated under conditions that the destabilized colloids and sludge dosage are mixed during flocculation process. This will simulate the actual condition in which the performed sludge is recycled from the clarifier bottom to the flocculation zone by submersible pumps mainly for sludge blanket establishment...|$|E
40|$|Many {{researchers}} consider efficient harvesting is {{the major}} bottleneck in cost efficient production of microalgae, contributing 20 – 30 % to total production cost. This thesis is {{the conclusion of a}} two years research project to develop Salsnes Water to Algae Treatment (SWAT) harvesting technology. SWAT uses two main processes: flocculation and filtration. The SWAT objectives were achieved, 95 % algae removal and power consumption lower than 0, 08 kWh/m 3. To gain knowledge about harvesting algae, an overview of coagulation and flocculation principles, coagulation using metal ions, mixing procedures, microalgae species, microalgae flocculation and finally a general view of different harvesting technologies focusing on filtration was carried out. PAX- 18 and Chemifloc CM 25 were selected for coagulation and flocculation respectively. Four different <b>flocculator</b> configurations were designed and tested, the best configuration (20 liters rapid mixing tank and 100 liters slow mixing tank) was chosen for further experimentations. The PAX- 18 concentration used was 114 mg/L as average and the Chemifloc CM 25 concentration used was 4 mg/L. Growth microalgae conditions (pH, temperature and dissolved oxygen concentration) were measured continuously during tests. Also key parameters for SWAT technology development were measured: power consumption kW/h, water level set point (mm), algae flow rate (m 3 /h) and cleaning procedure. Different mesh pore sizes for filtration were investigated, resulting in an optimal mesh pore size for 210 and 250 μm. Filter efficiency was determined using total suspended solids (TSS) and turbidity removal. Finally, there is a need of lowering coagulant dosage, so several recommendations are given to improve SWAT performance and make it a marketable technology...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{flocculant}} injection {{control system}} efficiency was evaluated on-site in an aggregate quarry, {{by means of}} laser diffraction {{and analysis of the}} size and texture of flocs. The configuration of the feed tank and the laser particle size measurement cell installed at the facility (280, 000 t/year of aggregates) allowed characterization of flocs with particle size between 4. 2 and 3473 μm under hydrodynamic conditions that were highly favorable for the examination of large and very fragile flocs. Two days of analysis of the floc formation process along the path followed by the slurry showed that flocculation was optimal during standard operation of the facility when the flow rate of waste fines and concentrations of solids were close to those used to calibrate the flocculant injection control system. Conversely, when the concentration of solids in the <b>flocculator</b> feed slurry dropped by 57. 3 %, the flocculant dosing fluctuated during stabilization of the mechanism, the kinetics of flocculation slowed, the mean size of flocs arriving at the settling tank dropped by 69 %, and the mode of smaller flocs shifted from 77. 8 to 10. 4 μm in relation to normal operation. On-site analyses confirmed that the measurements made with laser diffraction (using a methodology developed in the laboratory) allow determination of the effects of conditioning on the characteristics of flocs in terms of particle size, porosity, density, and volume fraction in the slurry. Evolution of these characteristics according to the local parameters of conditioning (mean detention time, mean slurry velocity, and mean velocity gradient) provides a significant part of basic information necessary to a diagnosis of the operation of an industrial circuit of flocculation. © 2007 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 200...|$|E
40|$|Land {{application}} of dairy slurry {{can result in}} incidental losses of phosphorus (P) to runoff in addition to increased loss of P from soil {{as a result of}} a buildup in soil test P (STP). An agitator test was used to identify the most effective amendments to reduce dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) loss from the soil surface after land {{application of}} chemically amended dairy cattle slurry. This test involved adding slurry mixed with various amendments (mixed in a beaker using a jar test <b>flocculator</b> at 100 rpm), to intact soil samples at approximate field capacity. Slurry/amended slurry was applied with a spatula, submerged with overlying water and then mixed to simulate overland flow. In order of effectiveness, at optimum application rates, ferric chloride (FeCl 2) reduced the DRP in overlying water by 88 %, aluminium chloride (AlCl 2) by 87 %, alum (Al 2 (SO 4) 3 ·nH 2 O) by 83 %, lime by 81 %, aluminium water treatment residuals (Al-WTR; sieved to < 2 mm) by 77 %, flyash by 72 %, flue gas desulphurization by-product by 72 % and Al-WTR sludge by 71 %. Ferric chloride (€ 4. 82 /m 3 treated slurry) was the most cost-effective chemical amendment. However, Al compounds are preferred owing to stability of Al–P compared with Fe–P bonds. Alum is less expensive than AlCl 2 (€ 6. 67 /m 3), but the risk of effervescence needs further investigation at field-scale. Phosphorus sorbing materials (PSM) were not as efficient as chemicals in reducing DRP in overlying water. The amendments all reduced P loss from dairy slurry, but the feasibility of these amendments may be limited because of the cost of treatment. peer-reviewedTeagasc Walsh Fellowshi...|$|E
