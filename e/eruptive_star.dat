40|$|V 1647 Ori {{is a young}} <b>eruptive</b> <b>star,</b> {{which went}} into {{outburst}} {{at the end of}} 2003. Since then, the object is gradually fading. In October 2005, however, V 1647 Ori started a very rapid fading, approximately 1 mag/month in I_C as opposed to 0. 1 mag/month previously. According to the colour changes, the rapid fading is not caused by increasing extinction, which suggests that the observed brightness changes are intrinsic.

The young <b>eruptive</b> <b>star</b> V 1647 Ori {{was observed}} with MIDI, the mid-infrared interferometric instrument at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI), on March 2, 2005. We present the first spectrally resolved interferometric visibility points for this object.

Comparison with similar observations of Herbig Ae stars suggests that V 1647 Ori probably possesses a disk of moderate flaring.

The apparent survivor has changed little in brightness and color over the last eight years, and a Keck spectrum reveals characteristics broadly similar to those of eta Car. This is further suggested by our identification of the actual outburst-surviving star in high-resolution images obtained with the Advanced Camera for Surveys on the Hubble Space Telescope.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{environment}} of the FU Ori type star V 582 Aur. Our aim is to explore the star-forming region associated with this young <b>eruptive</b> <b>star.</b> Using slitless spectroscopy we searched for H alpha emission stars within a field of 11. 5 arcmin × 11. 5 arcmin, centred on V 582 Aur. Based on UKIDSS and Spitzer Space Telescope data we further selected infrared-excess young stellar object candidates. In all, we identified 68 candidate low-mass young stars, 16 of which exhibited H alpha emission in the slitless spectroscopic images. The colour-magnitude diagram of the selected objects, based on IPHAS data, suggests that they are low-mass pre-main-sequence stars associated with the Aur OB 1 association, located at a distance of 1. 3 kpc from the Sun. The bright-rimmed globules in the local environment of V 582 Aur probably belong to the dark cloud LDN 1516. Our results suggest that star formation in these globules might have been triggered by the radiation field of a few hot members of Aur OB 1.

This work focuses on elucidating {{the nature of the}} faint source, located 0. 5 " south of FU Ori, and identified in 2003 as FU Ori S. We first use our observations in conjunction with published data to demonstrate that the two stars are indeed physically associated and form a true binary pair. We then proceed to extract J and H band spectro-photometry using the damped LOCI algorithm, a reduction method tailored for high contrast science with IFS. This is the first communication reporting the high accuracy of this technique, pioneered by the Project 1640 team, on a faint astronomical source. We use our {{low resolution}} near infrared spectrum in conjunction with 10. 2 micron interferometric data to constrain the infrared excess of FU Ori S.

40|$|FU Orionis stars (FUors) {{are young}} low-mass <b>eruptive</b> <b>stars</b> that {{are thought to}} be accreting at high rates. They could give rise to soft X-ray {{emission}} from accretion shocks, but their X-ray properties are largely unknown. We report the first X-ray detection of the prototype star FU Orionis with XMM-Newton. Its X-ray spectrum is unusual compared to those of classical T Tauri stars (cTTS). The cool and hot components typically detected in cTTS are present but are seen through different absorption column densities. A heavily-absorbed hot component at kT > 5 keV accounts for most of the observed flux and a strong Fe K emission line is present. Such high temperatures are characteristic of magnetic processes rather than shock emission.

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{brightness}} and spectral {{evolution of the}} young <b>eruptive</b> <b>star</b> V 1647 Ori during its recent outburst in the period 2004 February – 2006 Sep. We performed a photometric follow–up in the bands V, RC, I C, J, H, K s as well as visible and near-IR spectroscopy. The main results derived from combining our data with those published by other authors are as follows: The brightness of V 1647 Ori stayed more than 4 mag above the pre-outburst level until 2005 October when it started a rapid fading. In the high state we found a periodic component in the optical light curves with a period of 56 days. The delay between variations of the star and variations in the brightness of clump of nearby nebulosity corresponds to an angle of 61 ◦ ± 14 ◦ between the axis of the nebula and the line of sight. The overall appearance of the infrared and optical spectra did not change in the period March 2004 – March 2005, though a steady decrease of HI emission line fluxes could be observed.

40|$|We present Gemini-North {{optical and}} near-IR {{observations}} {{of a young}} <b>eruptive</b> <b>star</b> in Cygnus, designated as V 2492 Cyg in the General Catalog of Variable Stars. This object {{is one of two}} young stars, located within 2 degrees of each other, that recently brightened by around 5 mags and were reported as possible new FU Orionis-type variables. The outburst spectrum of V 2492 Cyg shows atomic emission features throughout the optical and near-infrared. In the optical, Halpha is in emission and has an associated blue-shifted absorption component. The far-red CaII triplet lines are also in emission and, as with Halpha, possess significant blue-shifted absorption. The optical TiO molecular bands are also in emission. In the near-infrared, Pabeta, Brgamma, and the CO overtone bandheads are strongly in emission. Such spectral characteristics are very similar to those exhibited by both EX Lupi, the progenitor of the EXor class of eruptive variables, during its 2008 extreme outburst, and V 1647 Ori during its elevated phase in 2003. Additionally, we consider archival data on V 2492 Cyg and investigate the pre-outburst nature of this young star. We construct a quiescent-phase spectral energy distribution which, via model fitting, gives insight into the circumstellar environment of the object prior to the current eruption. Our investigation strongly suggests that the V 2492 Cyg outburst appears to be more consistent with an EXor event, a fact supported by its recent 2 mag fading and stochastic variability.

40|$|We present multi-epoch {{high-resolution}} optical spectroscopy, UV/radio/X-ray imaging, and archival Hubble and Spitzer {{observations of}} an intermediate luminosity optical transient recently {{discovered in the}} nearby galaxy NGC 300. We find that the transient (NGC 300 OT 2008 - 1) has a peak absolute magnitude of Mbol ≈ − 11. 8 mag, intermediate between novae and supernovae, and similar to the recent events M 85 OT 2006 - 1 and SN 2008 S. Our high-resolution spectra, the first for this event, are dominated by intermediate velocity (∼ 200 − 1000 km s − 1) hydrogen Balmer lines and Ca II emission and absorption lines that point to a complex circumstellar environment, reminiscent of the yellow hypergiant IRC+ 10420. In particular, we detect broad Ca II H&K absorption with an asymmetric red wing extending to ∼ 10 3 km s − 1, indicative of gas infall onto a massive and relatively compact star (blue supergiant or Wolf-Rayet star); an extended red supergiant progenitor is unlikely. The origin of the inflowing gas may be a previous ejection from the progenitor or the wind of a massive binary companion. The low luminosity, intermediate velocities, and overall similarity to a known <b>eruptive</b> <b>star</b> indicate that the event {{did not result in}} a complete disruption of the progenitor. We identify the progenitor in archival Spitzer observations, with deep upper limits from Hubble data.

40|$|We report {{here on the}} {{discovery}} of laser action in the range 0. 9 - 2 μm in several spectral lines of Fe II, which are associated with transitions from "pseudo-metastable" states populated by spontaneous transitions from Lyα pumped Fe II levels. The intense Lyα radiation is formed in the HII region of gas condensations close to the star η Car. The laser transitions form together with spontaneous transitions closed radiative cycles, one of which includes the extremely bright 2507 / 09 Å lines. This fact, together with an accidental mixing of energy levels, may provide {{an explanation of the}} abnormal intensities of these UV non-lasing lines. Using the complicated energy level diagram of Fe II we present those peculiar features, which are essential for the inverted population and laser effect: the pumping, the level mixing, and the "bottle neck" for spontaneous decay. The laser action is a new indicator of non-equilibrium and spatially non-homogeneous physical conditions as well as a high brightness temperature of Lyα in ejecta from <b>eruptive</b> <b>stars.</b> Such conditions are very difficult to probe by existing method...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose that}} a {{radiative}} cycle operates in atoms (ions) {{located in a}} rarefied gas {{in the vicinity of}} a hot star. Besides spontaneous transitions the cycle includes a stimulated transition in one very weak intermediate channel. This radiative "bottle neck" creates a population inversion, which for an appropriate column density results in amplification and stimulated radiation in the weak transition. The stimulated emission opens a fast decay channel leading to a fast radiative cycle in the atom (or ion). We apply this model by explaining two unusually bright Fe II lines at 250. 7 and 250. 9 nm in the UV spectrum of gas blobs close to h Carinae, one of the most massive and luminous stars in the Galaxy. The gas blobs are spatially resolved from the central star by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST).

40|$|Microlensing {{events are}} usually {{selected}} among single-peaked non-repeating light curves {{in order to}} avoid confusion with variable stars. However, a microlensing event may exhibit a second microlensing brightening episode when the source or/and the lens is a binary system. A careful analysis of these repeating events provides an independent way to study the statistics of wide binary stars and to detect extrasolar planets. Previous theoretical studies predicted that 0. 5 - 2 % of events should repeat due to wide binary lenses. We present a systematic search for such events in about 4000 light curves of microlensing candidates detected by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) towards the Galactic Bulge from 1992 to 2007. The search reveals a total of 19 repeating candidates, with 6 clearly due to a wide binary lens.

We investigate the nature of the CO radio emission detected in the field of the light echo. In particular, we explore its connection to the echoing dust around V 838 Mon. Methods. We observed the echo region in multiple CO rotational transitions. We present and analyse maps of the region obtained in the 12 CO(1 - 0) and (3 - 2) lines. In addition, deep spectra at several positions were acquired in 12 CO(1 - 0), (2 - 1), (3 - 2), and 13 CO(1 - 0), (2 - 1). Radiative transfer modelling of line intensities is performed for chosen positions to constrain the kinetic temperatures and densities. We derive global parameters (e. g. mass, distance, total column density) of the emitting cloud. Results. We found that a compact molecular cloud is located within the echo region. The molecular emission is physically connected to the dusty environment seen in the optical echo and they both belong to the same translucent cloud.

The main results are as follows: The brightness of V 1647 Ori stayed more than 4 mag above the pre-outburst level until 2005 October when it started a rapid fading. In the high state we found a periodic component in the optical light curves with a period of 56 days. The delay between variations of the star and variations in the brightness of clump of nearby nebulosity corresponds to an angle of 61 +/- 14 degrees between the axis of the nebula and the line of sight. A steady decrease of HI emission line fluxes could be observed. In 2006 May, in the quiescent phase, the HeI 1. 083 line was observed in emission, contrary to its deep blueshifted absorption observed during the outburst. The J-H and H-K_s color maps of the infrared nebula reveal an envelope around the star. The color distribution of the infrared nebula suggests reddening of the scattered light inside a thick circumstellar disk.

There are single-star and binary models for the powering of ILOTs, which are <b>eruptive</b> <b>stars</b> with peak luminosities between those of novae and supernovae. In single-star models the ejection of gas at velocities of ~ 500 - 1000 km/s and a possible bright ionizing flash, require a shock to propagate from the core outward. Using a self similar solution to follow the propagation of the shock through the envelope of two evolved stellar models, a 6 Mo AGB star and an 11 Mo yellow supergiant (YSG) star, we find that the shock that is required to explain the observed mass loss also ejects most of the envelope. We also show that for the event to have a strong ionizing flash the required energy expels most of the envelope. The removal of most of the envelope is in contradiction with observations.

40|$|Context. V 2492 Cyg {{is a young}} <b>eruptive</b> <b>star</b> {{that went}} into {{outburst}} in 2010. The near-infrared color changes observed since the outburst peak suggest that the source belongs to a newly defined sub-class of young eruptive stars, where time-dependent accretion and variable line-of-sight extinction play a combined role in the flux changes. Aims. In order {{to learn about the}} origin of the light variations and to explore the circumstellar and interstellar environment of V 2492 Cyg, we monitored the source at ten different wavelengths, between 0. 55 μ m and 2. 2 μ m from the ground and between 3. 6 μ m and 160 μ m from space. Methods. We analyze the light curves and study the color-color diagrams via comparison with the standard reddening path. We examine the structure of the molecular cloud hosting V 2492 Cyg by computing temperature and optical depth maps from the far-infrared data. Results. We find that the shapes of the light curves at different wavelengths are strictly self-similar and that the observed variability is related to a single physical process, most likely variable extinction. We suggest that the central source is episodically occulted by a dense dust cloud in the inner disk, and, based on the invariability of the far-infrared fluxes, we propose that it is a long-lived rather than a transient structure. In some respects, V 2492 Cyg can be regarded as a young, embedded analog of UX Orionis-type stars. Conclusions. The example of V 2492 Cyg demonstrates that the light variations of young eruptive stars are not exclusively related to changing accretion. The variability provided information on an azimuthally asymmetric structural element in the inner disk. Such an asymmetric density distribution in the terrestrial zone may also have consequences for the initial conditions of planet formation.

40|$|Decades {{after the}} {{beginning}} of its FU Orionis-type outburst, V 346 Nor unexpectedly underwent a fading event of ΔK = 4. 6 mag around 2010. We obtained near-infrared observations and re-analysed data from the VISTA/VVV survey to outline the brightness evolution. In our VLT/NaCO images, we discovered a halo of scattered light around V 346 Nor with a size of about 0. 04 arcsec (30 au). The VISTA data outlined a well-defined minimum in the light curve at late 2010 /early 2011, and tentatively revealed a small-amplitude periodic modulation of 58 days. Our latest data points from 2016 demonstrate that the source is still brightening but has not reached the 2008 level yet. We used a simple accretion disk model with varying accretion rate and line-of-sight extinction to reproduce the observed near-infrared magnitudes and colors. We found that before 2008, the flux changes of V 346 Nor were caused by a correlated change of extinction and accretion rate, while the minimum around 2010 was mostly due to decreasing accretion. The source reached a maximal accretion rate of ≈ 10 ^- 4 M_ yr^- 1 in 1992. A combination of accretion and extinction changes was already invoked in the literature to interpret the flux variations of certain embedded young <b>eruptive</b> <b>stars.</b> Comment: 7 pages, 4 figures, appendices.

40|$|V 1647 Ori {{is a young}} <b>eruptive</b> {{variable}} <b>star,</b> illuminating {{a variable}} reflection nebula (McNeil’s Nebula). The previous outburst of the star between 2004 January and 2005 October has been extensively documented in the literature (e. g. Briceño et al. 2004, Ojha et al. 2006, Acosta-Pulido et al. 2007, Fedele et al. 2007). Optical, near-, and midinfrared observations of the star during the quiescent period following the outburst (Aspin et al. 2008) suggested a spectral type of M 0 ± 0. 2, mass 0. 8 ± 0. 2 M⊙, and age < 0. 5 Myr for V 1647 Ori. The observed properties of the outburst of V 1647 Ori are different in several respects from both the EXor and FUor type outbursts, and suggest that this star probably represents {{a new type of}} of <b>eruptive</b> young <b>stars,</b> younger and more deeply embedded than EXors, and exhibiting variations on shorter time scales than FUors. A new outburst of the star was announced on 27 th August 2008. Itagaki (2008) detected the apparent brightening of V 1647 Ori 26 August. The flux-calibrated optical spectrum of the star, obtained by Aspin (2008) on Aug 30, showed strong Hα emission line with P Cygni profile, the CaII triplet lines in emission, and suggested a Johnson R magnitude of 17. 3, corresponding to a brightening of some 6 mag in the R-band wit...|$|R
40|$|V 582 Aur is an FU Ori-type young <b>eruptive</b> <b>star</b> in {{outburst}} since ∼ 1985. The eruption {{is currently}} in a relatively constant plateau phase, with photometric and spectroscopic variability superimposed. Here we will characterize the progenitor of the outbursting object, explore its environment, and analyse the temporal evolution of the eruption. We are {{particularly interested in the}} physical origin of the two deep photometric dips, one occurred in 2012, and one is ongoing since 2016. We collected archival photographic plates, and carried out new optical, infrared, and millimeter wave photometric and spectroscopic observations between 2010 and 2017, with high sampling rate during the current minimum. Beside analysing the color changes during fading, we compiled multiepoch spectral energy distributions, and fitted them with a simple accretion disk model. Based on pre-outburst data and a millimeter continuum measurement, we suggest that the progenitor of the V 582 Aur outburst is a low-mass T Tauri star with average properties. The mass of an unresolved circumstellar structure, probably a disk, is 0. 04 M_. The optical and near-infrared spectra demonstrate the presence of hydrogen and metallic lines, show the CO bandhead in absorption, and exhibit a variable Hα profile. The color variations strongly indicate that both the ∼ 1 year long brightness dip in 2012, and the current minimum since 2016 are caused by increased extinction along the line of sight. According to our accretion disk models, the reddening changed from A_V= 4. 5 mag to 12. 5 mag, while the accretion rate remained practically constant. Similarly to the models of the UXor phenomenon of intermediate and low-mass young stars, orbiting disk structures could be responsible for the eclipses.

Collectively these publications highlight the relative ease and utility of the SMA to observe bright, chemically rich, galactic sources, and nearby galaxies; and further demonstrate the SMA’s relatively unique polarization capability. I {{would also like to}} thank members of the SMA correlator group for their continued efforts to provide additional wideband signal-processing capacity. We now regularly observe with the first tranche of SWARM, albeit at 3 / 4 speed, in parallel with the aging ASIC correlator, in service since 2002. While not yet perfect, the additional 2 x 1. 5 GHz bands, coupled with the original 2 x 2 GHz bands of the ASIC correlator and double sideband receiver operation result in an instantaneous bandwidth of 14 GHz. This provides additional flexibility during spectral line observations and improves the continuum sensitivity of the SMA by about 40 %. The SMA call for proposals for semester 2015 B (16 th November 2015 to 15 th May 2016) reflects this additional capacity, so please consider taking advantage of this during proposal preparation.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} spectroscopic {{investigation of the}} young <b>eruptive</b> <b>star</b> PV Cep, to improve our understanding of its nature and characterise its circumstellar environment after its last outburst in 2004. The analysis of our medium-resolution spectroscopy in the near-IR (0. 9 - 2. 35 um), collected in 2012 at the Large Binocular Telescope with the IR spectrograph LUCIFER, allows us to infer the main stellar parameters (visual extinction, accretion luminosity, mass accretion and ejection rates), and model the inner disc, jet, and wind. The NIR spectrum displays several strong emission lines associated with accretion/ejection activity and circumstellar environment. Our analysis shows that the brightness of PV Cep is fading, {{as well as the}} mass accretion rate (2 x 10 ^- 7 Msun/yr^- 1 in 2012 vs ~ 5 x 10 ^- 6 Msun/yr^- 1 in 2004), which is more than one order of magnitude lower than in the outburst phase. Among the several emission lines, only the [FeII] intensity increased after the outburst. The observed [FeII] emission delineates blue- and red-shifted lobes, both with high- and low-velocity components, which trace an asymmetric jet and wind, respectively. The observed emission in the jet has a dynamical age of ~ 8 years, indicating that it was produced during the last outburst. The mass ejection rate in both lobes is 1. 5 x 10 ^- 7 Msun/yr^- 1, approximately matching the high accretion rate observed during and immediately after the outburst. The observed jet/outflow asymmetries are consistent with an inhomogeneous medium. Our modelling of the CO emission hints at a small-scale gaseous disc ring, extending from ~ 0. 2 - 0. 4 AU to ~ 3 AU from the source, with an inner temperature of ~ 3000 K. Our HI lines modelling indicates that most of the observed emission comes from an expanding disc wind at Te= 10000 K. The line profiles are strongly affected by scattering, disc screening, and outflow self-absorption. Comment: To be published in A&...|$|E
40|$|The known FU Ori-type young <b>eruptive</b> <b>stars</b> are {{exceedingly}} rare (a {{dozen or}} so confirmed objects) and 2 MASS J 06593158 - 0405277, with its 2014 outburst, is likely the latest addition to the family. All members have displayed just one such eruption in their recorded history, an event lasting for decades. To test the FU Ori nature of 2 MASS J 06593158 - 0405277, we have reconstructed its photometric history by measuring its brightness on Harvard photographic plates spanning the time interval 1899 - 1989. No previous large amplitude eruption similar to that initiated in 2014 has been found, as in bona fide FU Ori-type objects. The median value of the brightness in quiescence of 2 MASS J 06593158 - 0405277 is B= 15. 5, with the time interval 1935 - 1950 characterized by a large variability (~ 1 mag amplitude) that contrasts with the remarkable photometric stability displayed at later epochs. The variability during 1935 - 1950 can either be ascribed to some T Tau like activity of 2 MASS J 06593158 - 0405277 itself or to the also young and fainter star 2 MASS J 06593168 - 0405224 that lies 5 arcsec {{to the north and}} forms an unresolved pair at the astrometric scale of Harvard photographic plates.

50|$|An FS Canis Majoris {{variable}} {{is a type}} of <b>eruptive</b> variable <b>star.</b> The class of variable stars are named after its prototype, FS Canis Majoris. They are somewhat poorly understood, most likely binary star systems in which mass exchange is ongoing or has recently happened, and most likely consist of at least one B-type main-sequence stars in a dust envelope. They undergo irregular light variations over long periods of time, with magnitude variation of approximately 2 magnitudes. The hydrogen emission lines from these stars are much stronger than in normal Be stars, and certain forbidden lines are present in the spectrum as well.|$|R
40|$|We present new {{high-resolution}} infrared echelle {{spectra of}} V 1647 Ori, the young star that illuminates McNeil's nebula. From the start, V 1647 Ori {{has been an}} enigmatic source that has defied classification, in some ways resembling <b>eruptive</b> <b>stars</b> of the FUor class and in other respects the EXor variables. V 1647 Ori underwent an outburst in 2003 before fading back to its pre-outburst brightness in 2006. In 2008, it underwent a new outburst. In this paper we present high-resolution K-band and M-band spectra from the W. M. Keck Observatory that were acquired during the 2008 outburst. We compare the spectra to spectra acquired during the previous outburst and quiescent phases. We find that the luminosity and full width at half maximum power of Br-gamma increased as the star has brightened and decreased when the star faded indicating that these phases are driven by variations in the accretion rate. We also show that {{the temperature of the}} CO emission has varied with the stellar accretion rate confirming suggestions from modeling of the heating mechanisms of the inner disk (e. g. Glassgold et al. 2004). Finally we find that the lowest energy blue-shifted CO absorption lines originally reported in 2007 are no longer detected. The absence of these lines confirms the short-lived nature of the outflow launched {{at the start of the}} quiescent phase in 2006. Comment: 13 pages, 6 figures, accepted by Ap...|$|R
