5|$|The Turin {{painting}} was acquired in 1866 {{from the mayor}} of a nearby town. Previously it was owned by a professor living {{in the province of}} Alessandria; <b>he</b> <b>bought</b> <b>it</b> from a former nun in that province. The documentation is sketchy, but suggests the nun possessed it early in the 19th century during the dissolution of convents in the area under Napoleon. That a nun owned the painting three centuries after Adornes purportedly bequeathed a van Eyck St Francis to his daughter in a convent, and that the Adornes family owned property in Alessandria, is suggestive, but no evidence exists to confirm a connection.|$|E
5|$|Adams still {{uses the}} same 26-inch-wide bass drum he began with in 1973. He has stated that <b>he</b> <b>bought</b> <b>it</b> {{as part of a}} set for $25 at a garage sale. It has the same head {{on the side of the}} drum that Adams does not beat, but Adams has stated that he replaces the other side about twice a year and also goes through about three sets of mallets each year. During games, Adams tends to drum at {{particular}} moments: when the Indians take the field at the beginning of the game, if the Indians have runners in scoring position, if the Indians are tied or trailing near the end of the game, or if they are winning at the top of the ninth inning. Because of his drumming, Adams became a celebrity and his drum was soon nicknamed Big Chief Boom-Boom, by Indians radio announcer Herb Score. It has also helped him meet politicians, including U.S. senators and a Pakistani government official.|$|E

25|$|The 0001 Strat is a Fender Stratocaster {{electric}} guitar, {{with a white}} body, maple neck, three-way pick up selector and {{an unusual}} gold colour scratch plate and hardware, owned by David Gilmour. <b>He</b> <b>bought</b> <b>it</b> from guitar technician Phil Taylor, who had purchased it from Seymour Duncan. This guitar {{is one of the}} most notable in his collection as it has the 0001 serial number. Gilmour used the guitar in the 2004 Strat Pack show that commemorated the 50th anniversary of the Stratocaster at Wembley Arena along with one of his Candy Apple Red Strats (famous for their appearances with Gilmour from 1987-2004). It is not the first Fender Stratocaster ever made as prototypes had already been constructed before this one. The origin of the guitar is unknown, and isn't clear whether it is the real 0001 Strat because the neck (which has the 0001 serial number on it) could have been taken off the original.|$|E

500|$|Nevill kept several guns at the farm. He was {{reportedly}} careful with them, cleaning them after use and securing them. He {{had bought the}} gun, a [...]22 Anschütz semi-automatic rifle, model 525, on 30 November 1984, along with a Parker Hale silencer, telescopic sight and 500 rounds of ammunition. Jeremy was with Nevill when <b>he</b> <b>bought</b> <b>it</b> from a gunsmith in Colchester. The gun used cartridges, which were loaded into a magazine that held ten cartridges. Twenty-five shots were fired during the killing, so if the rifle was fully loaded to begin with, {{it would have been}} reloaded at least twice. The court heard that the gun became harder to load with each cartridge; loading the tenth was described as [...] "exceptionally hard".|$|E
500|$|On 5 April, James left Edinburgh for London, {{promising}} to return {{every three years}} (a promise {{that he did not}} keep), and progressed slowly southwards. Local lords received him with lavish hospitality along the route and James was amazed by the wealth of his new land and subjects, claiming that he was [...] "swapping a stony couch for a deep feather bed". At Cecil's house, Theobalds in Hertfordshire, James was so in awe that <b>he</b> <b>bought</b> <b>it</b> there and then, arriving in the capital on 7 May, nine days after Elizabeth's funeral. His new subjects flocked to see him, relieved that the succession had triggered neither unrest nor invasion. On arrival at London, he was mobbed by a crowd of spectators.|$|E

Around 1910, Frank Vanderlip and William Rockefeller purchased the estate. Vanderlip thought of it as too big of a bargain to pass up– it was offered for only $165,000 ($ in [...] ). Narcissa Vanderlip thought the house too large and grand to live in, and so the Vanderlip family remained in their nearby property of Beechwood.|$|E

Hearst changed the name to the New York Journal and began to assemble what Hearst biographer Ben Procter deemed {{one of the greatest}} staffs in newspaper history. Under editor-in-chief Willis J.
