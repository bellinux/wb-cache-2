5|$|Aalborg had a synagogue, {{built in}} 1854; and the Jewish rabbi Salomon Mielziner served it for 35 years. Services {{were no longer}} offered after Mielziner died, and in 1924 the synagogue was donated to the city government, which began using it to store the city {{archives}} (Stadsarkivet). It was burned down by the Schalburg Corps in April 1945 {{towards the end of}} World War II, destroying its centuries-old Torahs. Anti-semitism continues to exist in Denmark, and in 1999, an unlicensed Nazi radio station began operating from a neo-Nazi stronghold in Fynen, Nørresundby, within Aalborg municipality.

5|$|As of November 2014, 28 {{states have}} enacted medical {{marijuana}} laws, removed jail time <b>for</b> <b>possession</b> of {{small amounts of}} marijuana, and/or have legalized the possession, distribution, and sale of marijuana outright. The factors which have led to this change are many, {{but some of them}} could include increased support from the medical community for legalization, viable regulatory systems modeled off of alcohol regulation, and the potential for state financial gains from decreased criminal justice costs and increased tax revenues. Although outright legalization for non-medical use of marijuana has only occurred in four states in the Union, in view of the movements in many states, it is possible that those states will not be alone for long.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, friends were {{concerned}} about the Marquess's addiction to drugs, particularly since multiple prison sentences had done nothing to alleviate it. He was deported from Australia in April 1990 and charged with drug possession in November 1991 and March 1992. That October, his estate company was liquidated with debts over £650,000. In June 1993, he avoided a jail sentence by being ordered to attend a rehabilitation clinic, but travelled to the South of France instead and was sentenced to 10 months in an open prison, where he was released after five. He was arrested again in September 1994 <b>for</b> <b>possession.</b>|$|E
5|$|Claiming the General Assembly's {{decision}} was invalid, Taylor sued to prevent Beckham from exercising {{the authority of}} the governor's office. Beckham countersued Taylor <b>for</b> <b>possession</b> of the state capitol and governor's mansion.

The Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld the circuit court's decision on appeal and rejected Taylor's claim that he had been deprived of property without due process by stating that an elective office was not property and thus not protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, ethnomethodological {{approaches}} of Conversation Analysis (CA) and Membership Categorization Analysis (MCA) {{have been applied}} {{to the study of}} gender and language. This yielded to discussions among scholars across the social sciences as to what extent CA can inform gender studies. In this paper, this question is addressed by providing data from my corpus of interactions in a Turkish marriage show. The data is analyzed by focusing specifically on two facets of MCA suggested by Schegloff (1991) : 1) category-bound activities, and 2) being protected against induction. In relation to these, the analysis shows 1) how „asking <b>for</b> <b>possessions</b> ‟ is treated as an activity bound to the gender category „women‟, 2) and how after „asking <b>for</b> <b>possessions</b> ‟ is established as a category-bound activity, interactants tend to protect this knowledge when a need arises to revise this knowledge...|$|R
5|$|Despite {{the battle}} waged <b>for</b> <b>possession</b> of it, the {{railroad}} {{had not been}} very profitable. Passenger traffic to Wopsononock had been declining, and coal traffic from Dougherty was rather limited. Shellenberger installed a rock crusher atop the mountain, which also provided revenue. A major forest fire destroyed both the Wopsononock Hotel and the coal tipple at Dougherty on April 30, 1903. When the railroad became insolvent again, Shellenberger was appointed receiver on June 4, 1909. It was once more sold under foreclosure on April 30, 1910 to H.A. Davis, and reorganized as the Altoona, Juniata and Northern Railway.|$|E
5|$|HB 3466 {{would have}} {{increased}} penalties <b>for</b> <b>possession</b> of under {{an ounce of}} marijuana from an infraction (traffic ticket-like offense) to a Class A misdemeanor, the worst non-felony offense, with a fine of $100 to $1,000 per gram, up {{to a maximum of}} $5,000. The bill also would have created a new crime—being under the influence of marijuana—punishable by a fine of up to $5,000. The bill would have passed according to the positions of state senators, but was blocked on a technical basis which prevented it from coming to the floor the same day it was read—which allows public input—unless overridden by a vote.|$|E
5|$|In 1970 the United States Congress {{repealed}} mandatory {{penalties for}} cannabis offenses and The Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act separated cannabis from other illicit narcotics and removed mandatory sentences <b>for</b> <b>possession</b> of {{small amounts of}} cannabis.

The Commission found that the constitutionality of cannabis prohibition was suspect and that the executive and legislative branches had a responsibility to obey the Constitution, {{even in the absence}} of a court ruling to do so. The Richard Nixon administration did not implement the study's recommendations.|$|E
