50|$|The {{education}} {{is based on}} an integrated curriculum. In this program, systems within the human body are described from the simplest units such as the cell to more complex systems including pathologies, in <b>subject</b> <b>committees.</b> In Phase I, groups of <b>subject</b> <b>committees</b> form a whole curriculum for a given year. In addition, there are special blocks such as Clinical Medicine and Professional Skills (CMPS), Medical Informatics, Biostatistics and Medical Technologies, Interactive Modules, Medical English and Elective Courses. The term “Subject committee” means that topics of a given subject like “cell” or “organ systems” are described in a coordinated manner by different departments. These committees contain theoretical lectures, practical studies, and modules. Integrated programs within the <b>subject</b> <b>committees</b> provide equal participation of basic and clinical sciences to teach a particular organ system. As an example; the gastrointestinal system will be given in all aspects by contributions from basic sciences and clinical sciences. The courses include both knowledge from basic sciences like anatomy, physiology, biochemistry and clinical aspects like pathology, diagnosis, treatment and prevention.|$|R

40|$|Shared {{authority}} and independent responsibility {{are important in}} institutional governance {{and the development of}} learning and teaching and whilst historically administrators primarily undertook the traditional roles and responsibilities for decision-making, students have been provided with an increased representation at various levels of governance structures in Universities. However, the extent to which students are given decision-making powers in teaching and learning is limited, with students often afforded more of a consultative role, lacking agency and voice (Klemenčič, 2014; Bovill et al., 2015). The notion that students can assist in a role beyond consultation has increased in recent years (Bovill et al., 2011). An area that has been under explored is how students are involved in assuring and enhancing teaching and learning at a programme or <b>subject</b> level. <b>Subject</b> <b>committees</b> or staff-student liaison committees/forums are regularly used by institutions as a mechanism to gain student feedback on programmes. The relationships and engagement between academics and student representatives within these meetings are essential in forging an effective partnership to enhance the design and delivery of a programme. Bishop et al. (2012) conducted a research project to identify how <b>subject</b> <b>committees</b> could be made more participatory, one of the recommendations of this research was the use of student co-chairs to work in partnership with academic staff. The University of Lincoln have now adopted the model of students and academics co-chairing <b>subject</b> <b>committees</b> as standard practice across all subject areas in the institution. The aim {{of this paper is to}} explore how the practice of students and academics has been adopted across the University. The research uses qualitative methods, with students and staff working together to implement all stages of the research. Specifically, the paper will explore the experiences and practice of how student and academics have co-chaired <b>subject</b> <b>committees</b> and how this positioning of students and academics has facilitated or hindered the extent and nature of student and staff engagement within the meetings. The findings will be of value to the wider higher education community offering insight into how students and academics can work collaboratively within the design and development of curricula to enrich and enhance the collective learning experience...|$|R
