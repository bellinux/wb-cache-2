40|$|Background: <b>Group</b> <b>F</b> streptococci are Gram-positive cocci {{typically}} {{isolated from}} wound infections and abscesses. Bacteremia with <b>group</b> <b>F</b> streptococcus is uncommon, {{and the lower}} gynecologic tract has not been reported as a source. We report {{a case of a}} Bartholin’s abscess leading to <b>group</b> <b>F</b> streptococcal bacteremia. Case: A 31 -year-old female noted fever and rigors 30 min after manipulation of a 3 -day-old vulvar abscess. An empty Bartholin’s gland abscess was found on examination, and blood cultures grew b-hemolytic <b>group</b> <b>F</b> streptococci. The patient was treated with ampicillin/sulbactam, symptoms improved, and follow-up blood cultures revealed no growth. Conclusion: <b>Group</b> <b>F</b> streptococci are known to inhabit various body sites and have a predilection for forming abscesses; however, bacteremia is infrequent. They have occasionally been identified in true infections of the genitourinary tract but only very rarely in Bartholin’s abscesses. This case of <b>group</b> <b>F</b> streptococcal bacteremia following self-drainage of a Bartholin’s abscess constitutes the first such description in the medical literature.

40|$|On two farms, three milking {{groups of}} buffalo cows {{were used to}} assess the {{consistency}} of entrance order and the preference for one side of the milking parlour. On Farm 1 (F 1) all animals were primiparous (n= 57). On Farm 2, three primiparous, 16 secondiparous and 36 multiparous cows (range 1 – 8) constituted <b>group</b> <b>F</b> 2 G 1; whereas <b>group</b> <b>F</b> 2 G 2 had 12 primiparous, 10 secondiparous and 14 multiparous cows (range 1 – 10). Animals were milked in auto-tandem milking parlours (2 × 5 and 2 × 6 for Farms 1 and 2, respectively). For each cow, entrance order into milking parlour, side where she was milked, milk yield, time and duration of milking were recorded. These data were derived from the computerised identification of cows. The sequence in which the cows entered themilking parlour ranged from 1 to 57 for <b>group</b> <b>F</b> 1, from 1 to 55 for <b>group</b> <b>F</b> 2 G 1 and from 1 to 36 for <b>group</b> <b>F</b> 2 G 2. The analysis of data was conducted on 130, 120 and 92 consecutive milkings for <b>groups</b> <b>F</b> 1, F 2 G 1 and F 2 G 2, respectively. Kendall’s coefficients of concordance showed a strong constancy of the entrance order into milking parlour for <b>groups</b> <b>F</b> 1 (W= 0 • 658; χ 2 = 4792 • 81; P< 0 • 001), F 2 G 1 (W= 0 • 779; χ 2 = 5046 • 81; P< 0 • 001) and F 2 G 2 (W= 0 • 624; χ 2 = 2030 • 48; P< 0 • 001). Spearman rank correlation coefficients indicated that the more productive cows in <b>groups</b> <b>F</b> 1 and F 2 G 1 tended to enter the milking parlour first (rs=_ 0 • 221 and rs=_ 0 • 215; P< 0 • 10; respectively). In <b>group</b> <b>F</b> 2 G 1, a negative correlation was found between duration of milking and order of entry in the milking parlour (rs= _ 0 • 265; P< 0 • 05). Animals in <b>group</b> <b>F</b> 2 G 2 (rs= 0 • 334; P< 0 • 05) with higher days in milk entered the milking parlour latterly. In all three groups, 68 cows (45 • 9...|$|R

40|$|Aim: To {{compare the}} {{postoperative}} hepatic functions during total intravenous anesthesia with fentanyl and remifentanil in outpatient settings. Material and Method: Fifty adult patients were randomly allocated {{to one of}} two anesthetic regimens (n= 25) and were received remifentanyl (15 %u 03 BCg/ kg/h; group R) or fentanyl (1. 5 %u 03 BCg/kg/h; <b>group</b> <b>F)</b> intravenously. After giving propofol (2. 5 mg/kg) and rocuronium bromide (0. 5 mg/kg), patients were intubated. Propofol was continued to infuse at 9 mg/kg/h rate. The preoperative and postoperative liver function tests, haemodynamic parameters, anesthetic requirements, and recovery times were recorded. Result: Recovery times in group R was significantly lower than in the <b>group</b> <b>F</b> (8. 61. 2 min and 3. 50. 5 min in <b>group</b> <b>F</b> and R) (p= 0. 0001). The postoperative values of high density lipoprotein, total protein and alkaline phosphatase were significantly lower than the postoperative values in <b>group</b> <b>F</b> and R (96. 331. 9; 6. 11. 4; 186. 873. 5 in <b>group</b> <b>F,</b> 94. 829. 6; 6. 21. 2; 163. 768. 5 in group R) (p= 0. 003, p= 0. 0001 and p= 0. 002, respectively). The postoperative prothrombin time was significantly longer than the preoperative values in <b>groups</b> <b>F</b> and R (Preoperative and postoperative values in group F: 13. 60. 8 / 14. 51. 08 (p= 0. 001) and in group R: 13. 90. 9 / 19. 625. 0) (p= 0. 001). Discussion: Fentanyl and remifentanil have a similar effect on the LFT, haemodynamics, anesthetic requirements, reducing the postoperative pain.

40|$|The study {{investigated}} the effect of immediate feedback in training listeners to perceive subtle differences in voice quality, a perceptual skill that is important for speech-language pathologists. Sixty naive listeners {{were randomly assigned to}} a feedback <b>group</b> (<b>Group</b> <b>F),</b> a no feedback group (Group NF), and a no training group acting as a control group (Group C). The task was to evaluate the severity of a perceptual voice quality (breathiness) by using a reference-matching paradigm. All participants took part in three rating sessions (pre-training, 2 days after training and 1 week after training). <b>Group</b> <b>F</b> and <b>Group</b> NF participated in a training session immediately after the first rating session, where <b>Group</b> <b>F</b> practiced with immediate feedback given and Group NF practice with no immediate feedback given. The results showed that <b>Group</b> <b>F</b> and <b>Group</b> NF had significant improvement after training, but <b>Group</b> <b>F</b> did not retain the improvement in the third rating session. The use of a reference-matching training paradigm without giving frequent immediate feedback is suggested for auditory-perceptual voice evaluation training.
