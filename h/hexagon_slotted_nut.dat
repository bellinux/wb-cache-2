5000|$|A {{castellated}} nut, {{also called}} a castle <b>nut</b> or <b>slotted</b> <b>nut,</b> is a <b>nut</b> with <b>slots</b> (notches) cut into one end. [...] The {{name comes from}} the nut’s resemblance to the crenellated parapet of a medieval castle.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A {{chainring}} bolt. These {{are used}} in various lengths both to join rings and to fasten the assembly to the spider of the crank. While some have recessed hex fittings in both screw and nut, some like this have a <b>slotted</b> <b>nut</b> that {{requires the use of}} a special tool.|$|R
50|$|The bolt or axle has one or {{two holes}} drilled through its {{threaded}} end. The nut is torqued properly and then, if the slot is not aligned with {{the hole in the}} fastener, the nut is rotated forward to the nearest <b>slot.</b> The <b>nut</b> is then secured with a split pin/cotter pin, R-clip or safety wire. It is a positive locking device.|$|R
50|$|Several factors affect fretted {{instrument}} intonation, including {{depth of}} the string <b>slots</b> in the <b>nut,</b> bridge saddle position, {{the position of the}} frets themselves, and the technique of the musician.|$|R
5000|$|GA {{split beam}} nut, {{also known as}} a split hex <b>nut</b> or <b>slotted</b> beam <b>nut,</b> is a locknut with slots cut in the top that {{separate}} the outside end into two or more sections that are bent slightly inward, making the thread diameter undersized in the slotted portion. As the nut is threaded on, these sections are forced back out to their original position and increase the friction between the nut and the fastener, creating the locking action.|$|R
50|$|String <b>slots</b> in a <b>nut</b> {{without a}} zero fret must be {{cut to the}} proper depth to make string height correct. Strings that are too low at the nut can buzz against the frets, and too high throws off {{intonation}} of fretted notes.|$|R
50|$|Another {{cause of}} poor {{intonation}} on a fretted instrument {{is that the}} maker didn't cut the string <b>slots</b> in the <b>nut</b> deep enough. If the string is higher than fret height at the nut, the string deflection-caused pitch increase is progressively greater closer to the nut.|$|R
5000|$|The word {{may have}} come from the German Nut (pronounced [...] "noot"), meaning groove or <b>slot.</b> The <b>nut,</b> however, is called a de:Sattel ("saddle"; also Obersattel) in German, whereas the part of a guitar known as the saddle in English, the surface of the bridge on which the strings rest, is called a de:Stegeinlage or Steg, in German. In French, the nut is known as a :fr:sillet, which, like German, can also {{translate}} to mean saddle. The Italian term, capo tasto (or capotasto; [...] "head of fretboard"), is the origin of the capo.|$|R
5000|$|Some guitars have {{a rolling}} nut. In this design, made popular by the Fender company, the strings sit on roller {{bearings}} instead of <b>nut</b> <b>slots.</b> The rollers let the string freely slide or roll through the nut. The roller nut {{helps keep the}} guitar in tune by preventing the strings from getting stuck in the nut.|$|R
50|$|The System II tremolo {{system was}} {{designed}} by John Page, Chip Todd and Charlie Gressett.The System III tremolo system {{was designed by}} John Page, Dan Smith, Charlie Gressett and John Carruthers. The System I, II and III tremolo systems were manufactured in Germany by Schaller.Sometimes parts of the tremolo system are lost and one common modification {{is to make the}} bridge function as a hardtail by locking the bridge into a non movable position and installing a string tree for the first and second strings so that the strings don't slip out of the <b>nut</b> <b>slots.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{conventional}} nut made {{of relatively}} soft plastic or bone will easily clamp the string and make fine tuning difficult. The clamping effect does not only result from too narrow <b>nut</b> <b>slots,</b> but notably {{more from the}} impression of the string windings into the nut material {{at the bottom of}} the slot. That effect is more prevalent with wire wound nylon strings than with steel strings. Using a zero fret relieves the pressure from the nut material and the nut serves only to center the strings sideways. Tuning is smooth and without sudden movement and intonation jumps. There are only a few manufacturers making metal (bronze)conventional nuts which avoid the string clamping effect.|$|R
40|$|Flexural {{strength}} of reinforced concrete slabs with externally applied in-plane forces, by A. G. Girolami, M. A. Sozen [and] W. L. Gamble; and Strength of slabs subjected to multiaxial bending and compression, by W. L. Gamble, H. Flug [and] M. A. Sozen. Summary of Flexural Strength Of Reinforced Concrete Slabs With Externally Applied In-Plane Forces by Girolaml, A. G. : Reinforced concrete slabs, bounded by elements which can develop horizontal reactions, have flexural capacities considerably {{in excess of}} the load calculated by an orthodox application of the yield-line analysis. The additional capacity results primarily from changes in geometry of the slab which generates in-plane forces reacting against the bounding element. Calculation of the effect of the in-plane forces on slab flexural strength is essential for a realistic evaluation of the slab capacity because the increase in load caused by the in-plane forces is not negligible, especially for short-time loading. The investigation described in this report was concerned with the development of a simple method of calculation for the flexural {{strength of}} reinforced concrete slabs with in-plane forces and to check the applicability of the method by experiments. Six reinforced concrete slabs with spandrel beams were built, instrumented, and tested. The test slabs, which were six-ft square and 1. 75 in. deep, were reinforced with intermediate grade steel (yield stress was approximately 48, 000 psl) and the concrete strength was approximately 4500 :psl [...] The slab and the spandrel beams had both negative and positive moment reinforcement to stimulate an interior panel in a two-way slab designed to carry 150 psf. Three of the test slabs were supported only at the corners while three were supported at several points along the spandrel beams to investigate the effects of nonyielding beams [...] . Summary of Strength Of Slabs Subjected To Multiaxial Bending And Compression by Gamble, W. L. : Reinforced concrete slab panels which are supported so that horizontal displacement of the edges of the panels are prevented are often capable of supporting considerably more load than would be indicated by simple yield-line analysis methods because of in-plane compression forces developed during deflection. The purpose of the series of tests and analysis described in this report was to demonstrate that the basic principles used in predicting the strength of reinforced concrete elements subjected to bending moments and thrusts in one direction, {{as in the case of}} columns, can also be used satisfactorily to predict the strength and behavior of slabs subjected to bending and in-plane forces acting in several directions at once. The importance of the in-plane forces can perhaps be best illustrated by reference to a set of tests conducted by Ockleston on a large reinforced concrete building. A single interior beam-supported panel carried a uniformly distributed load of 753 psf. While the computed capacity, using the yield-line analysis technique, was 295 psf. The very high load capacity is attributable to the presence of –in-plane compression forces generated when the surrounding panels restrained the lateral movements of the edges of the load panel. Six hexagonal reinforced concrete slabs were constructed and tested in order to investigate the effects of the reinforcement ratio and magnitude of in-plane forces on the strength and behavior of slabs. The slabs were reinforced with steel having a yield stress of about 50 kips/in. ² and the average concrete strength was about 6, 300 1 b/in. ² The slabs were four in. thick, and the basic hexagon measure about 6 ft 2 in. across flats. The edges of the <b>hexagon</b> were <b>slotted</b> to form loading wings, and the load was applied so as to produce constant bending moments in all directions within a three ft diam. Central portion of the slab [...] . The Departmeent Of Defense Office Of The Secretary Of The Army, Office Of Civil Defense.
