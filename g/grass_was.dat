5|$|During the {{expedition}} of Hugh Cuming in 1827 and the 1922 Whitney South Sea Expedition, Lepturus <b>grass</b> <b>was</b> found on Acadia Islet. However, it disappeared when storm waves deforested the island {{some time before}} the Smithsonian expedition of 1975. Thus H. foertherianum now dominates the vegetation of the islets. Additionally, {{there are a number}} of species of coralline algae, including Porolithon onkodes, Porolithon gardineri, and Caulerpa racemosa.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} {{the first edition of}} Leaves of Grass, critical responses began focusing more on the potentially offensive sexual themes. Though the second edition was already printed and bound, the publisher almost did not release it. In the end, the edition went to retail, with 20 additional poems, in August 1856. Leaves of <b>Grass</b> <b>was</b> revised and re-released in 1860 again in 1867, and several more times throughout the remainder of Whitman's life. Several well-known writers admired the work enough to visit Whitman, including Amos Bronson Alcott and Henry David Thoreau.|$|E
5|$|Over $200,000 {{was spent}} on renovations {{in the fall and}} winter before the 1995 season. The home clubhouse and weight room were remodeled, aisles behind the dugouts were resurfaced to reduce {{slippery}} areas, and the entire playing field was re-sodded. This was the first replacement and upgrading of the field since the original sod was laid in 1978. First, all of the old <b>grass</b> <b>was</b> stripped from the field. Then, the grounds crew installed a new drainage system. Four trenches were dug and laid with 2,500feet (760m) of drainage pipe to carry water away from the field and beyond the center field wall. A layer of gravel was laid over the pipe, and a 4-to-6-inch (10to15cm) layer of sand was placed above the gravel. After raising the level of the infield dirt and brick warning track to the same height of the new field, 100,000square feet (9,300m²) of Tifton 419 Bermuda <b>Grass</b> <b>was</b> installed on the field and edged into a baseball diamond configuration.|$|E

50|$|Sage {{and sweet}} <b>grass</b> <b>are</b> both used by Blackfoot and other Plains tribes for {{ceremonial}} purposes and are considered sacred plants. Sage and sweet <b>grass</b> <b>are</b> burned with the user inhaling and covering {{themselves in the}} smoke in a process known widely as smudging. Sage is said to rid the body of negative emotions such as anger. Sweet <b>grass</b> <b>is</b> said to draw in positive energy. Both are used for purification purposes. The pleasant and natural odor of the burning <b>grass</b> <b>is</b> said to attract spirits. Sweet <b>grass</b> <b>is</b> prepared for ceremony by braiding the stems together then drying them before burning.|$|R
5|$|The 90 minute {{production}} was conceived in 1997 and commissioned in 2003, {{with the premise}} established in the final episode of Only Fools and Horses in 2003. It was shelved and Only Fools and Horses spin-off The Green Green <b>Grass</b> <b>was</b> developed; its success led to the prequel being recommissioned in July 2009. Filming began in October in London and the {{production was}} first broadcast on BBC One and BBC HD on 24 January 2010. It was the second most watched programme of the day but gained mixed reviews from critics.|$|E
5|$|The Oxford English Dictionary derives {{the word}} straightforwardly from Old English butorflēoge, butter-fly; similar names in Old Dutch and Old High German {{show that the}} name is ancient.

5|$|Born in Huntington on Long Island, Whitman {{worked as}} a journalist, a teacher, a {{government}} clerk, and—in addition to publishing his poetry—was a volunteer nurse during the American Civil War. Early in his career, he also produced a temperance novel, Franklin Evans (1842). Whitman's major work, Leaves of <b>Grass,</b> <b>was</b> first published in 1855 with his own money. The work was an attempt at {{reaching out to the}} common person with an American epic. He continued expanding and revising it until his death in 1892. After a stroke towards the end of his life, he moved to Camden, New Jersey, where his health further declined. When he died at age 72, his funeral became a public spectacle.|$|E
5|$|The {{trials that}} the Donner Party {{had so far}} endured {{resulted}} in splintered groups, each looking out for themselves and distrustful of the others. <b>Grass</b> <b>was</b> becoming scarce, and the animals were steadily weakening. To relieve the load of the animals, everyone was expected to walk. Keseberg ejected Hardkoop from his wagon, telling the elderly man {{that he had to}} walk or die. A few days later, Hardkoop sat next to a stream, his feet so swollen that they split open, and he was not seen again. William Eddy pleaded with the others to find Hardkoop, but they all refused, swearing that they would waste no more resources on a man who was almost 70 years old.|$|E
5|$|As {{the tornado}} crossed South Richard Road, it {{intensified}} {{into a very}} high-end EF4 and inflicted catastrophic damage to several large homes as it impacted the Deer Creek subdivision. Well-built homes along South Richard Road and East Kuehl Court were leveled and swept from their foundations with debris strewn downwind. Several vehicles parked at these residences were moved some distance or tossed, and wind rowing of debris occurred. One house had its concrete walkway pulled {{a few inches from}} its original location, and notable scouring of lawn <b>grass</b> <b>was</b> observed in the subdivision. These structures were estimated to have been impacted by winds near 200mph (320km/h), the upper bound of an EF4 tornado. The homes swept away in this area were bolted to their foundations and there is some speculation that the tornado may have reached EF5 intensity at this point, though close inspection revealed that some of the washers were missing from the anchor bolts, and that low-lying shrubbery near the homes was left mostly intact, preventing a higher rating. Continuing northeast, the tornado temporarily weakened as it destroyed a few large barns or outbuildings, ripped the roof off two brick residences, and collapsed most walls of another house, but once again gained strength as it approached Illinois Route 64. A large restaurant and a residence had their exterior walls collapsed.|$|E

50|$|However, if we now {{assume that}} <b>grass</b> <b>is</b> {{green on the}} {{left-hand}} side refers to a proposition, then the theory seems trivial since <b>grass</b> <b>is</b> green is defined as true {{if and only if}} <b>grass</b> <b>is</b> green. Note that the triviality involved here is not caused by the concept of truth but by that of proposition. In any case, simply accepting the triviality of the propositional version implies that, at least within the Deflationary Theory of Truth, there can be no explanation of the connection between sentences and the things that they express; i.e., propositions.|$|R
5|$|His {{capital is}} {{believed}} to be somewhere in modern-day Haryana. Prithu used his Kshatriya power to make the earth yield its riches. Hence the earth is called Prithvi, daughter of Prithu. Prithu, by mere fiat of will, created millions of men, elephants, chariots and horses. During his reign, there was no decreptitude, no calamity, no famine, no disease, no agriculture and no mining. Prithu enjoyed popularity amongst his subjects, hence all kings are called Rajas. Cows yielded buckets of rich milk when they were touched. Trees and lotuses always had honey in them. People were healthy and happy and had no fear of thieves or wild animals. Nobody died of accidents. Kusha <b>grass</b> <b>was</b> golden in colour. Fruits were always sweet and ripe and nobody went hungry. People lived in houses or caves or trees or wherever they liked. For the first time, civilization and commerce came into existence.|$|E
5|$|On a small {{ground at}} Belmont, the September <b>grass</b> <b>was</b> coarse. It had been rolled {{so that the}} ball moved very quickly across the ground. The Australian side, fielding first, dropped many catches and could not cope with the short boundary, {{allowing}} the Philadelphians to reach a huge total of 525 runs. King came in to bat last, at number 11, making 36 runs. The leading Australian bowlers, Hugh Trumble and George Giffen, took 2 for 104 and 0 for 114 respectively. When the Australians came to bat, they hoped that they would, by now, have recovered from their tiring journey, but ran into problems when dealing with Bart King's developing swing bowling. The side was all out for 199, with King taking 5 wickets for 78 runs. The Australians followed on and were all out again for 268, allowing the Gentlemen of Philadelphia to win by an innings and 68 runs.|$|E
5|$|The terrain {{over which}} the two brigades were to advance was {{generally}} steep with the track having been cut along a high spur line that dropped on either side into deep ravines that were covered by kunai grass interspersed with areas of thick jungle. North of Bonga, the ground was markedly different, with the track having been pushed through flat swamp land that was punctuated by many deep creeks; vegetation in the area was mainly thick secondary growth, although to the west, in the steep hills, kunai <b>grass</b> <b>was</b> predominate. As {{a result of the}} harsh conditions and terrain, as the Australian advance continued it was increasingly hampered by vehicle break downs and fatigue amongst their crews. Resupply was also a problem for the Australians and consequently a lack of spare parts developed. This meant that a number of jeeps became unserviceable and some of the Matilda tanks were unable to advance for some time while their crews waited for parts to be brought up.|$|E

50|$|Here, Rorty {{argues that}} all {{language}} is contingent. This is because only {{descriptions of the}} world can be true or false, and descriptions are made by humans who must also make truth or falsity: truth or falsity is thus not determined by any intrinsic property of the world being described. Instead they purely belong to the human realm of description and language. For example, a factual case of green <b>grass</b> <b>is</b> not true or false, in and by itself, but that <b>grass</b> <b>is</b> green may be true. I can say that that <b>grass</b> <b>is</b> green and you could agree with this statement (which for Rorty makes the statement true), but our use of the words to describe <b>grass</b> <b>is</b> distinct and independent of the grass itself.|$|R
25|$|<b>Grass</b> <b>was</b> {{born in the}} Free City of Danzig on 16 October 1927, to Wilhelm Grass (1899–1979), a Lutheran Protestant of German origin, and Helene Grass (née Knoff, 1898–1954), a Roman Catholic of Kashubian-Polish origin. He {{referred}} to himself as Kashubian. <b>Grass</b> <b>was</b> raised a Catholic and served as an altar boy {{when he was a}} child.
