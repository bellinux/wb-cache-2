40|$|Identical single <b>jersey</b> <b>wool</b> knit fabrics {{produced}} inconsistent {{results when}} tested {{on the same}} type of ICI pill box in 4 independence testing laboratories.   The hypothesis formulated to investigate this event was that continued pilling testing in the ICI pill box changes the frictional properties of the cork liners, resulting in the difference pilling ratings.   The aim {{of this study was to}} decrease the inconsistencies in the pilling results by replacing the conventional cork lined pill box with a Perspex TM pill box.   The smae or similar pilling results found for several of the knit facots tested in the two difference pill boxes, while for others there were some significant differences found.   In addition, while using the Perspex TM pill box observations of the movement of the pilling tubes during testing provided evidence of greater fabric-to-fabric abrasion, rather the expected high degree of fabric-to-cork abrasion (or fabric-to-Perspex TM) during pilling testing...|$|E

50|$|In 1951, the Hornets {{introduced}} a new black and gold color scheme that {{was familiar with the}} city's baseball team and football team. The color wasn't new for hockey in Pittsburgh. The Pittsburgh Pirates wore those colors from 1925-29, before switching to black and orange in 1929-30. The home <b>jerseys</b> were <b>wool.</b> The colors scheme was black with gold trim. The jerseys featured tie-down collars and the familiar hornet in a hard hat on the sleeves. The road jerseys consisted of a gold body and black trim.|$|R
5000|$|During {{their first}} season, the Hornets wore <b>wool</b> <b>jerseys</b> that were likely {{recycled}} from the Detroit Olympics. The home jerseys {{worn by the}} Hornets during their first season in Pittsburgh were white with red trim. The front of the jersey featured a large circular crest with the Hornets' logo and team name. Their road jerseys were red with white trim around the shoulders and sleeves with the circular crest. From 1939 until 1943, the Hornets home <b>jerseys</b> were red <b>wool</b> with a white script [...] "P" [...] and the word [...] "Hornets" [...] sewn onto them. The Hornets were a minor league team of the NHL Detroit Red Wings and likely wore hand-me-downs jerseys from the parent club. This trend held into the 1946-47 AHL season, when the team wore red <b>wool</b> <b>jerseys</b> for home games with a simple, block number on front and back, and a simple crew neck collar. The sleeves featured a Hornet wearing a steel worker's hard hat. The road versions of these sweaters were reversed; white body with red trim. The 1948 jersey took this style one step further by including seven stars on each sleeve, including a star below the hornet near the cuffs. The road versions of these sweaters were reversed: white body with red trim.|$|R

5000|$|The Yellow Jackets wore yellow <b>wool</b> <b>jerseys</b> with a [...] "P" [...] on {{the front}} of their jerseys in 1924. The <b>wool</b> <b>jerseys</b> {{featured}} black felt lettering would become the Pirates first set of jerseys. The team used the Pittsburgh's city crest emblems on the uniform sleeves. John McMahon, a sports writer for the Pittsburgh Press once referred to the color of the home jerseys as a [...] "dingy mustard yellow." [...] When the Yellow Jackets evolved into the City's first NHL team, the Pittsburgh Pirates, the color scheme followed. In fact when the City's second NHL team, the Pittsburgh Penguins wanted to change their uniform colors from blue and white to black and gold, a move protested by the Boston Bruins, the Pirates-Yellow Jackets jerseys were showcased as precedence for the move.|$|R
50|$|The yellow jersey {{was made}} for decades, like all other cycling <b>jerseys,</b> from <b>wool.</b> No {{synthetic}} fibres existed which had both the warmth and the absorption of wool. Embroidery was expensive and so the only lettering {{to appear on the}} jersey was the H.D. of Desgrange's initials. Riders added the name of the team for which they were riding or the professional team for which they normally rode (in the years when the Tour was for national rather than sponsored teams) by attaching a panel of printed cloth {{to the front of the}} jersey by pins.|$|R

5000|$|In 1961, the Hornets {{returned}} to the ice and were once again sporting red and white <b>wool</b> <b>jerseys</b> again. The jerseys featured tie-down collars. A full circular crest trimmed in gold replaced the familiar hornet in a hard hat on the sleeves. The Captain's [...] "C" [...] or alternate captain's [...] "A's" [...] were worn {{on the right side}} of the chest. The home jerseys were red with white trim and featured the stars on the sleeves again. Meanwhile, Hornets' owner, John Harris, wanted his team to have a unique jersey for road games. The result was a blue <b>wool</b> <b>jersey</b> trimmed in gold. The jersey lasted three seasons. However, there were problems with how the blue color translated on black-and-white televisions. Home teams wore darker colors and, unfortunately, the Hornets' blue jerseys looked like the dark. Rare television coverage was too confusing for viewers who couldn't see any contrast between the teams on the television.|$|R

5000|$|The jester blouse was {{a popular}} item in 1950s and early 1960s women's fashion. Fashion {{designer}} Louella Ballerino found an illustration of a court jesterwhich inspired her to design her [...] "sun and fun" [...] fashions. The jester theme appeared in long pointed collars tipped with bell-like buttons, harlequin prints, and in the jagged points which occasionally outlined an apron overskirt. Ballerino created plunged-to-the-waist jester blouses in cotton or <b>wool</b> <b>jersey</b> topped sun backed dresses.|$|R
40|$|The comfort {{properties}} of the pique and single <b>jersey</b> knitted <b>wool</b> fabrics were investigated using the Wool ComfortMeter (WCM). The fabrics were knitted in three cover factors and treated with either plasma or a silicone softening agent and were compared with untreated fabrics. Plasma treatment did not show significant effects on the comfort value. However, silicone polymer significantly reduced WCM values suggesting that the silicone coating {{reduced the number of}} protruding fibres on the fabric surface. Regardless of treatment used, pique fabrics showed a lower WCM value, and therefore were perceived to be more comfortable than the single jersey structure. While the effect of cover factor was not significant, in fitted model to predict the WCM value of fabrics, mass/unit area and fabric thickness were significant predictors along with fabric structure and finishing treatment...|$|R
