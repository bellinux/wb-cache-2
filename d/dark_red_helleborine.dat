500|$|Raasay {{is home to}} the Raasay vole (Clethrionomys glareolus erica), a {{subspecies}} of bank vole, {{which is}} darker and heavier than the mainland variety and found nowhere else in the world. It is possibly a survivor of a Scandinavian race. Murray (1973) states that a single specimen of a pine marten, otherwise missing from the Hebrides, was found on the island in 1971. [...] No other records for this species exist. Raasay is one of only four of the Inner Hebrides where mountain hares breed. Raasay is regularly visited by white-tailed sea eagles and golden eagles and there are populations of otter, red deer and European rabbit (which were thoughtlessly introduced by the island's proprietor in the 19th century). Stoat and weasel are found in small numbers as are water shrew. It also supports a rich variety of plants, including red broomrape, <b>dark</b> <b>red</b> <b>helleborine,</b> mountain avens and numerous other saxifrages, orchids, alpines and ferns. The carline thistle (Carlina vulgaris) was apparently extant in the 1970s, but a recent survey found no evidence of its continued existence. There are several stands of mixed woodland.|$|E

40|$|In 2007 and in {{previous}} years, {{as part of}} ongoing attempts to improve <b>red</b> <b>helleborine</b> Cephalanthera rubra seed-set, hand pollination of florets has been undertaken at a small colony of this species in Buckinghamshire, southern England. Natural pollination rarely occurs (one mature pod recorded in 10 years) at this site. In 2007, hand pollination resulted {{in the production of}} four seed pods, of which one withered and died. Upon ripening, the three remaining pods were removed for attempted micropropagation of the seeds. Ongoing conservation management has probably benefited the solitary bee Chelostoma campanularum which now appears fairly plentiful at the site, but despite the presence of this <b>red</b> <b>helleborine</b> flower visitor, natural pollination remains virtually unrecorded at this locality; field observations suggest that C. campanularum is in fact probably not large enough to act as an effective <b>red</b> <b>helleborine</b> pollinator as it can slip {{in and out of the}} flowers without removing the pollinia, unlike it larger relative C. fuliginosum, absent from the UK but which is a known pollinator of <b>red</b> <b>helleborine</b> in continental Europe...|$|R
50|$|Rare plants {{include the}} <b>red</b> <b>helleborine,</b> bird's-nest orchid and knothole yoke-moss. Rare fungi include the Devil's bolete and {{hedgehog}} mushroom.|$|R

50|$|Species of {{tree and}} shrub include ash, downy birch, hazel, hawthorn, yew and rowan. In the woods shrubs such as wild privet and spindle can be found. More rare is <b>dark</b> <b>red</b> <b>helleborine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Plants {{including}} rigid buckler fern, angular Solomon's seal, limestone fern, and <b>dark</b> <b>red</b> <b>helleborine</b> are to {{be found}} on the pavement. The nationally scarce rigid buckler-fern Dryopteris submontana is abundant on Hutton Roof Crags. Blue moor grass is also nationally scarce but abundant here.|$|E
5000|$|When {{used for}} flowers, red often refers to purplish (red deadnettle, <b>red</b> clover, <b>red</b> <b>helleborine)</b> or pink (<b>red</b> campion, red valerian) colors.|$|R
50|$|The wood {{consists}} of an extensive tract of the Chiltern escarpment. It contains beech woodlands, scrub and chalk grassland. It {{is one of three}} extant British locations for the <b>red</b> <b>helleborine</b> orchid.|$|R
5000|$|Large {{parts of}} the woods are {{dominated}} by various conifers and the flora of the forest floor is rather poor of species in most areas. Where chalk comes to the surface layers, it can present some rare and more interesting plant species though, like the rare lady's-slipper orchid growing {{side by side with}} plants like pennywort, smell fox and <b>red</b> <b>helleborine</b> for example. Note: In Denmark all orchids are to be protected and it is not allowed to pick them.|$|R
50|$|Magnesian {{limestone}} grassland supports an {{assemblage of}} calcicolous plants adapted to growing in thin soils with a short sward. The quarry holds {{one of the largest}} British populations of the <b>dark</b> <b>red</b> <b>helleborine,</b> Epipactis atrorubens; a survey in 2010 found nearly 1700 flowering spikes of this nationally rare species.|$|E
50|$|Ruabon Moors {{are part}} of a Site of Special Scientific Interest and hold a wide variety of plant and animal life. Large parts of the moors are covered with heather. Where there are {{outcrops}} of limestone on the surface a number of scarce plants can be found such as prickly sedge, <b>dark</b> <b>red</b> <b>helleborine</b> and rigid buckler-fern.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Dark</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Helleborine</b> favours {{warm and}} dry locations, with soil basic to neutral in pH, nutrient-poor, and permeable. It grows in loose rock, scree, or sandy soils above a {{limestone}} substrate, including dunes, lawns, or open forest. It is also a pioneer species, which settles in fallow areas, road embankments, and waste dumps, {{in the early to}} middle stages of ecological succession, among communities of grass and bush and light birch stands.|$|E

50|$|The lower eastern {{slopes of}} the {{mountain}} have a landscape of pastureland, small farms and woods. The higher moorland above Fron-dêg, known as the Fron-dêg Flat, has typical moorland vegetation of heather, bilberry and sedge; rarer plants include the <b>dark</b> <b>red</b> <b>helleborine.</b> Hill farming is still practised, with sheep grazing across the moor. There are still surface remains of former lead workings, particularly in the areas known as Pool Park and Gwter Siani, with the foundations of old engine-houses, managers' residences and chimneys being visible in some places.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Dark</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Helleborine</b> is {{widespread}} across Europe, and {{is found in}} the north to the subarctic, in the south to the Mediterranean, and in the east to Western Siberia and the Caucasus. (Codes) [...] The orchid grows at altitudes from sea level to 2400 m, and so can be found in mountainous regions such as the southern Alps. In Central Europe it has been in decline in recent decades. It is not, however, one of the most severely threatened species of orchid. The species is also reportedly naturalized in one location in the US State of Vermont.|$|E
