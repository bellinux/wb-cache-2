5000|$|According to Encyclopedia of Islam: Taking Ali by the hand, {{he asked}} of his {{faithful}} followers whether he, Muhammad, was not closer (awlā) to the Believers {{than they were}} to themselves; the crowd cried out: [...] "It is so, O Apostle of God!"; he then declared: [...] "He of whom I am the mawla, of him Ali is also the mawla (man kuntu mawlāhu fa-ʿAlī mawlāhu)". Shias regard these statements as constituting the <b>designation</b> <b>of</b> Ali as the successor of Muhammad and as the first Imam; by contrast, Sunnis take them only {{as an expression of}} close spiritual relationship between Muhammad and Ali, and of his wish that Ali, as his cousin and son-in-law, inherit his family responsibilities upon his death, but not necessarily a <b>designation</b> <b>of</b> political <b>authority.</b>|$|R
50|$|Suggestions for {{improvement}} {{in the operation of}} CITES include: more regular missions by the Secretariat (not reserved just for high-profile species); improvement of national legislation and enforcement; better reporting by Parties (and the consolidation of information from all sources-NGOs, TRAFFIC, the wildlife trade monitoring network and Parties); more emphasis on enforcement-including a technical committee enforcement officer; the development of CITES Action Plans (akin to Biodiversity Action Plans related to the Convention on Biological Diversity) including: <b>designation</b> <b>of</b> Scientific/Management <b>Authorities</b> and national enforcement strategies; incentives for reporting and timelines for both Action Plans and reporting. CITES would benefit from access to Global Environment Facility (GEF), funds-although this is difficult given the GEFs more ecosystem approach-or other more regular funds. Development of a future mechanism {{similar to that of the}} Montreal Protocol (developed nations contribute to a fund for developing nations) could allow more funds for non-Secretariat activities.|$|R
5000|$|The Constitution (in Chapter Three of Title I) {{defines the}} forms of democracy—participatory, {{representative}} and community-based—and structure of government {{to be used in}} Bolivia. Direct and participatory democracy takes place through referenda, citizen legislative initiatives, revocation of elected officials' mandates, assemblies, cabildos and prior consultation. Representative democracy takes place through the election of representatives through universal, direct, and secret vote. Communal democracy takes place through the [...] "election, <b>designation</b> or nomination <b>of</b> <b>authorities</b> and representatives" [...] among indigenous, originary, or campesino peoples and nations, using their own norms and procedures. The same chapter establishes a separation of powers between four branches of government: legislative, executive, judicial, and electoral.|$|R

40|$|The {{contribution}} {{investigates the}} state of institution building for regional policy purposes in Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary - candidate countries, which are preparing to become EU member states. In comparison with the situation {{at the beginning of}} the 1990 s, when regional policy had only little importance in these countries, some progress has been achieved in the field of institution building, primarily at national level. A lot, however, still has to be done to complete this institution building: adaptation of programmes to the requirements of the EU regulations set for structural funds, <b>designation</b> <b>of</b> the management <b>authorities</b> and paying authorities, better coordination between the various central state institutions involved in regional policy, inclusion of regions into the national programming process. The competencies of these latter in the sphere of regional policy, which should be strengthened in the course of administrative reform in all the countries investigated, have not gained a foothold yet. In the accession states there is a need to clarify how the regions could be involved in the process of elaboration and realization of regional policy programmes. ...|$|R
50|$|Not every {{program that}} misuses {{authority}} is a confused deputy. Sometimes misuse <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> {{is simply a}} result of a program error. The confused deputy problem occurs when the <b>designation</b> <b>of</b> an object is passed from one program to another, and the associated permission changes unintentionally, without any explicit action by either party. It is insidious because neither party did anything explicit to change the authority.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a model for obtaining and using, for program improvement, {{information}} gained from follow-up studies of graduates of education administration programs. Data were gathered in several ways. ^ First, literature was reviewed to identify elements essential for such a model. A listing was made of elements which appeared at least twice. Second, experts in educational evaluation reviewed and refined the list of elements. A model was then designed. ^ To compare current follow-up practices with those outlined in the model, a questionnaire was mailed to the Plenary Session Representative of the 48 education administration departments belonging to the University Council for Educational Administration. ^ Results of the questionnaire showed that the departments of less than half (47. 6 %) of the respondents conducted follow-up studies of their graduates. Lack of time was noted as the factor which prevented most departments from carrying out follow-up studies. ^ Among the departments that conducted follow-up, adherence to the model was found in the following suggested components: multiple collection methods, high response density, broad dissemination of follow-up data, use of follow-up results for multiple programmatic decisions, and use of follow-up study recommendations in planning for, facilitating and implementing program improvement. ^ The departments were generally not congruent with the following components of the model: multiple input into the design <b>of</b> the study, <b>designation</b> <b>of</b> an <b>authority</b> figure as manager of the study, multiple assessments, collection of a diversity of information, and regular and frequent follow-up. ^ Telephone interviews with five of the respondents emphasized the importance of the elements of the model in gathering and using follow-up data for program improvement. ...|$|R
