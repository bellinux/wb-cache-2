50|$|As {{indicated}} above, Cytochrome P450 reductase (POR) {{is responsible}} for regenerating <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> of CYPs including the epoxygenases. Several genetic variants of the human POR gene impact epoxygenase activity. For example, POR Missense mutations A287P and R457H lead to reductions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> of CYP2C19 and CYP2C9, respectively, whereas A503V and Q153R missense mutations lead to small increases <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> of CYP2C9. While these and other POR genetic variants {{have not yet been}} associated with epoxygenase-related disease, they contribute to <b>the</b> marked variability <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> of <b>the</b> epoxygenases between individuals.|$|R

He first proposed their use as early as April 18, 1861. The first raider, , avoided the Union blockade at New Orleans on June 30, 1861. From then until after the war was over, {{the small group of}} raiders plundered Union shipping, inflicting damage on the American Merchant Marine that persists to the present day. They failed of their primary purpose, however, because Welles maintained the Union blockade, and international trade continued as before, carried in ships flying foreign flags.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} age-related RMS decline in humans {{has been the}} subject of {{significant}} debate. The decline of neurogenesis in and migration from the hippocampus in humans has already been well documented. Furthermore, age-related declines <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>activities</b> of SVZ stem cells, which migrate to the OB via the RMS, are in place by middle age in rodents. In elderly mice, studies showed that the population of actively dividing SVZ cells and the rate of interneuron replacement in the OB are both drastically reduced, indicating an age-related decline in neuronal proliferation and migration through the RMS. This decline was shown to be due to neuronal stem cell quiescence in the SVZ even by middle age, and not destruction, much like in the hippocampus.|$|E
5|$|The {{protectorate}} status had {{a negative}} effect on the island's trade with Tahiti. Ships from Rurutu, as from other protectorates, were considered foreign vessels at the ports of France and its overseas territories such as the Tahitian port capital of Papeete, Rurutu's nearest significant trading partner. Consequently, Rurutu's agricultural exports were subject to tariffs from which the exports of annexed territories were exempted. The economic disadvantages of the protectorate status became even more evident when France closed the Tahitian ports to all foreigners in 1899, including merchants from Rurutu, in response to an outbreak of bubonic plague in San Francisco. This disruption of trade between the two islands occurred in a period during which Rurutu became increasingly reliant economically on Tahiti. The growing prominence of Tahiti was evidenced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>activities</b> of Teuruarii, who regularly visited Papeete for trade and entertainment. Teuruarii incurred much debt during these trips, and the need to pay off his creditors along with the restriction on trade prompted him to consider formal annexation to France.|$|E

5|$|Ann {{believes}} the {{figures to be}} the ghosts of Quint and Jessel, seeking to continue their passionate and violent sexual encounters through Miles and Flora. However, she is concerned to find that others apparently cannot see the ghosts. She then begins to suspect that Miles and Flora, having been groomed by and involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>activities</b> of Quint and Jessel, may be deliberately seeking to bring the pair back. She resolves to leave Bly, but, when saying goodbye to Miles, learns that he, too, sees the figures. Minutes after leaving, she asks to be taken back. Later, Ann panics, believing Miles and Flora to have left the house. She finds them by the lake, but they are playing roughly; when Miles pushes Flora's head under the water, Ann sees the pair as Quint and Jessel. She rushes to intervene, and grapples with the figure which alternates between Quint and Miles. When Ann repeatedly strikes Miles, Mrs Grose stops her, and Flora says that she no longer wishes to see Ann. After ordering the staff and Flora away from Bly, Ann waits with Miles to confront Quint. The pair are scared, but when Quint arrives Ann tells Miles to demand that Quint leave him alone. Miles (speaking with Quint's voice) shouts at Ann, but eventually (in his own voice) tells the ghostly Quint that he wishes him to leave. Ann embraces Miles, whose body goes limp.|$|E

40|$|Postmenopausal {{patients}} with primary breast cancer {{were treated with}} tamoxifen, ethynyloestradiol or prednisolone for up to 12 days before mastectomy {{and the effects of}} pretreatments with these drugs on <b>the</b> <b>activities</b> of phosphofructokinase (PFK), 6 -phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6 PGDH) and alpha-glycerolphosphate dehydrogenase (alpha-GPDH) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> carcinomas were compared with age, stage and menopausal status matched untreated controls. The administration of tamoxifen or prednisolone resulted in a significant increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> of alpha-GPDH and the alpha-GPDH/ 6 PGDH ratio, whereas ethynyl-oestradiol treatment produced a significant decrease <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> of <b>the</b> enzyme and the ratio. When tamoxifen and ethynyl-oestradiol were administered together, it was found that tamoxifen failed to reverse <b>the</b> oestrogen-induced reduction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> of alpha-GPDH. Since increased <b>activity</b> of <b>the</b> enzyme or a higher alpha-GPDH/ 6 PGDH ratio are associated with a lower risk of recurrence (Deshpande et al., 1981), it is postulated that the beneficial effects of tamoxifen or prednisolone in terms of prolongation of the relapse free interval might be mediated via alterations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> of alpha-GPDH <b>in</b> micrometastases. <b>The</b> <b>activities</b> of PFK and 6 PGDH remained unaffected by these treatments...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to examine <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> of {{glycogen}} debranching enzyme, GDE, in porcine and bovine muscles differing in rate of contraction and <b>in</b> oxidative capacity. <b>The</b> <b>activity</b> of GDE, <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> of phosphorylase, total glucose content, lactate content and pH were measured from meat samples taken 35 min post-mortem and ultimate pH 24 or 48 h post-mortem. Both GDE and phosphorylase are needed for the complete degradation of glycogen. <b>In</b> porcine muscles <b>the</b> <b>activities</b> of these glycogen degrading enzymes were higher than <b>in</b> bovine muscles. <b>The</b> <b>activities</b> were increasing with the increasing fast twitch and glycolytic character of a muscle of a given species. However, <b>the</b> increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> of phosphorylase was greater than <b>the</b> increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> of GDE. It was concluded that the GDE may restrict the rate of glycolysis in fast twitch muscles...|$|R
