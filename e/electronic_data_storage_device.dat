Methods. Author’s methods of the organisation of students’ work with the text on <b>electronic</b> <b>data</b> <b>storage</b> <b>devices</b> are used during modelling experiment. Methods of questioning, interrogation are applied; the content-analysis and the correlation analysis of the received data. Results. Stages of the person’s creative self-development composing a dialectic cycle of formation and development of research skills of the pupil in educational process are noted. The interrelation between scientifically-methodical readiness of the teacher for development of research potential of students and features of the organisation of their work with the text is established. Ways of activization of pupils’ creative self-development are offered and shown while working with the electronic text and the Internet resources. The given ways allow to realize the idea of subjectiveness and the subjectivity, pointed within the limits of culturological and anthropological approaches to education; to stimulate the process of formation and personality growth of the student; to provide sensibleness of a student’s choice of own trajectory of education; to open its intellectual and creative abilities. Scientific novelty. The variant of transition of school education from positions of transmission of the educational information, completed knowledge and abilities to formation and subjectness development of students and satisfaction of their requirements for creative self-realisation is shown. For this purpose, according to the author, it is necessary to use manifold opportunities of digital technologies actively introduced recently in student teaching not as subsidiary means of reception of the information, but for the didactic purposes – for creative self-development of students, their self-advancement in the course of knowledge, acquisition of new senses of a studied material and development of skills of successful independent work at the decision of difficult research problems. Practical significance. The technique of the organisation of work with the electronic educational text described by an example of studying of the theme «Limiting hydrocarbons. Methane» promotes self-development of students, and can be adapted for any other theme, section and discipline of a school course. </p...|$|R

40|$|Phase-change {{materials}} (PCMs) form {{a unique}} collection of materials that {{is defined by}} its extraordinary property portfolio. The attribute "phase-change" readily summarizes the most prominent feature of a representative of this material class: PCMs can be rapidly and reversibly switched between the crystalline and the amorphous phase. Alongside with the phase transition drastic changes occur in optical reflectivity and electrical conductivity, which predestine these compounds for technological utilization in modern <b>data</b> <b>storage</b> <b>devices.</b> The large contrast in reflectivity leveraged the employment of PCMs in optical <b>data</b> <b>storage</b> <b>devices</b> such as DVD-RWs or the Blu-Ray disc, while the contrast in resistivity makes them promising contenders for {{a new class of}} non-volatile, <b>electronic</b> <b>data</b> <b>storage</b> <b>devices</b> (so called PRAMs or PCRAMs) that bear the potential to replace FLASH technology in the near future. The aim of this thesis is to support the ongoing development of PCM-based technology by enhancing the understanding of its physical foundation. Here, the focus is set on a thorough investigation of the thermal properties of GeSbTe-based phase-change materials (GSTs). Thermal properties determine several critical parameters of phase-change technology e. g. the power consumption of the switching process. Furthermore, thermal properties are strongly related to the peculiar physical effects which have been reported for phase-change materials such as the unconventional bonding in the crystalline phase (resonance bonding) or structural disorder that strongly affects transport properties. In order to investigate these miscellaneous relationships, the study at hand is divided into three parts. In the first part the focus is set on microscopic and macroscopic thermal properties that are associated with lattice vibrations. These are the phonon density of states (PDOS) measured by inelastic neutron scattering and the specific heat of GSTs determined by differential scanning calorimetry. It is demonstrated that crystalline GSTs exhibit signs of a pronounced anharmonic atomic interaction potential, which is a predicted consequence of resonant bonding. The second part covers thermal transport properties. Here, low temperature measurements of the thermal conductivity from room temperature down to 50 K (performed with a custom-designed 3 omega setup) enable valuable insights into the phonon scattering mechanisms. It is demonstrated that thermal transport is strongly affected by the degree of configurational disorder - similar to electrical transport. In combination with the aforementioned finding of pronounced anharmonicity a model evolves, in which thermal transport in GSTs is strongly reduced by an interplay of anharmonicity and disorder. Furthermore, it is demonstrated, that the degree of disorder can be used to tailor the thermal and electrical transport properties. The topic of transport control is further expanded within the third part of the thesis where the focus moves to the thermoelectric properties of GSTs. The question arises whether the tunability of the electric and the thermal conductivity enables the approach of a so-called phonon-glass, electron crystal property combination. Such a combination is highly desirable in the field of thermoelectrics, where a thermoelectric composition converts heat into electricity and vice versa. In this part of the investigation the thermal and electrical conductivities are complemented with the corresponding Seebeck data to calculate the thermoelectric figure of merit ZT of GSTs. Elevated ZT values around 0. 8 are found for GeTe-rich GST compositions and GSTs close to the metal-insulator transition. This may open up further technological utilization of these versatile materials in the field of thermoelectrics and underlines the high relevance of the thermal characterization of phase-change materials...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{miniaturization}} of <b>electronic</b> and <b>data</b> <b>storage</b> <b>devices</b> necessitates methods which enable {{large area}} structuring on a nanometer length scale at reasonable prices. Block copolymers (BCP) are promising candidates for future application in e. g. semiconductor industry, and solar cells {{due to their}} capability to readily self-assemble into highly ordered thermotropic or lyotropic phases on a length scale of 10 - 100 nm. One of the main challenges is gaining control over structure and orientation of block copolymer microphases. Methods envisaged include the application of external stimuli such as shear forces, temperature gradients, solvent annealing, magnetic- or electric fields, as well as chemoepitaxy, and graphoepitaxy. Benefits of electric field-induced orientation include that they can easily be integrated into electronic devices, are increasingly effective on diminishing length scales, and the rapid, stepwise tunability of field strength. This thesis deals with the analysis of phase transitions and ordering of block copolymer microphases induced by electric fields. The first four chapters deal with the bulk analysis {{of the effect of}} electric field on microphase separated diblock copolymer nanostructures via birefringence measurements and synchrotron SAXS. In Chapter 3 we describe the setup developed to use birefringence measurements as a supplementary method to synchrotron SAXS. The novel setup enabled the analysis of the effect of strong dc electric fields on the order-disorder transition temperature in a large parameter window, for various block copolymer systems. The novelty of our findings is that we identify the parameters that evoke mixing of block copolymers when exposed to electric fields (the difference in dielectric permittivity (Δε) between the block copolymer constituents and the degree of polymerization (N)). Another phase transition focused on is the electric-field-induced transition between a gyroid and a cylinder nanostructure. Through a detailed synchrotron SAXS study we could unveil the mechanisms of the electric-field-induced gyroid-to-cylinder transition and of the reformation of the gyroid phase after turning off the electric field which have not been reported to date. The detailed mechanistic study is given in Chapter 6. We show that the exploited mechanism is determined by temperature and electric field strength. In Chapter 5 time- and temperature-resolved in-situ birefringence measurements were applied to analyze the effect of nanoparticles on the electric field-induced alignment of block copolymers. With our experiments we reveal that the incorporation of isoprene-confined CdSe quantum dots leads to an altered reorientation behavior. Particle loading lowers the order-disorder transition temperature, and increases the defect density, favoring nucleation and growth as an alignment mechanism over rotation of grains. Experiments to the last two chapters of this thesis were performed during a research internship at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and deal with the effect of electric fields on thin film samples. In Chapter 7 we systematically analyze how the combination of two directing effects (graphoepitaxy and electric field) influences the self-assembly of cylinder forming polystyrene-block-poly(dimethylsiloxane) block copolymer in thin films during solvent vapor annealing. We analyzed how the angle between the electric field direction and the topographic guides, as well as the dimensions of the trenches affected both the quality of the ordering and the direction of the orientation of cylindrical domains: parallel or perpendicular to the topographic features. This combined approach allows the fabrication of highly ordered block copolymer structures using macroscopically pre-patterned photolithographic substrates. Further structural diversity can be achieved by adding a third block to the polymer. Hence, Chapter 8 focuses on electric-field-induced phase transitions in thin films of star-shaped 3 -miktoarm triblock terpolymers composed of polyisoprene, polystyrene and polyferrocenylethylmethylsilane. We show that the metalorganic PFEMS block alters the behavior of the polymer upon exposure to electric fields compared to the other block copolymers analyzed in this thesis. Additionally, to the previously described effect of ordering the volume fraction of PFEMS is enhanced with increasing electric field strength due to oxidation of the ferrocenyl groups. Therefore, different electric field strength dependent morphological transitions are observed. The results demonstrate the multiple tunability of the ordered microdomain structure by simple stimuli application. Summarizing different aspects of electric-field-induced ordering and phase transitions in various block copolymer systems were analyzed in this thesis enhancing the understanding of the effect of electric fields on the block copolymer phase diagram and pointing out possible future applications...|$|R
