2500|$|In 1980 Jensen {{published}} a detailed book {{in defense of}} the tests used to measure mental abilities, entitled Bias in Mental Testing. Reviewing this book, psychologist Kenneth Kaye endorsed Jensen's distinction between bias and discrimination. The purpose of tests is to discriminate (that is, reveal actual differences) on the basis of ability; bias constitutes error. Jensen defined any test as biased for a particular group if that group differs significantly from the majority group in the slopes, intercepts, or standard error of the estimates of their regression lines. Most studies found no difference <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>regression</b> lines between black and white groups, but those differences that had been found to be biased had overpredicted rather than underpredicted the minority group's performance (for example, grades in Officer Candidate courses). Jensen's conclusion: ...|$|E
2500|$|Although serial {{correlation}} {{does not affect}} the consistency of [...] the estimated regression coefficients, it does affect our ability to conduct valid statistical tests. First, the F-statistic to test for overall significance of the regression may be inflated under positive {{serial correlation}} because the mean squared error (MSE) will tend to underestimate the population error variance. Second, positive serial correlation typically causes the ordinary least squares (OLS) standard errors for the regression coefficients to underestimate the true standard errors. As a consequence, if positive serial correlation is present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>regression,</b> standard linear regression analysis will typically lead us to compute artificially small standard errors for the regression coefficient. These small standard errors will cause the estimated t-statistic to be inflated, suggesting significance where perhaps there is none. The inflated t-statistic, may in turn, lead us to incorrectly reject null hypotheses, about population values of the parameters of the regression model more often than we would if the standard errors were correctly estimated.|$|E

On the other hand, (ii) yield spreads highly correlated with the rational expectations forecasts of the perfect foresight spreads, but significantly more volatile than these, suggest {{the rejection of the}} REH. The alternative hypothesis of overreaction of the yield spread to the present short rate (or under-reaction of the long rate to the present short rate) seems to be a reasonable explanation to the findings that (iii) the estimated coefficients are significantly lower than unit and (iv) the residual are orthogonal to the agents information set <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>regressions</b> of <b>the</b> rational expectations forecasts on the yield spreads. ...|$|R

When the between and within components of Theil are added one at a time <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>regressions,</b> <b>the</b> former has significant and negative correlation with life satisfaction and perception of fairness, while the latter is correlated with only life satisfaction.
