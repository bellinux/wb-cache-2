5|$|Snow White {{is saved}} by seven dwarfs, each {{named after the}} days of the week and {{possessing}} the power to transform into a rainbow to move <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> (but are only capable if all seven dwarfs are present). The eldest is Sunday, who is a victim of one of Elspeth's spells that has left half of him as a garden gnome. The dwarfs allow Snow White to care for their home, though the dwarf Wednesday is initially suspicious. When Elspeth learns that Snow White is still alive, she prepares a poisoned apple and transforms into Josephine, Snow White's deceased mother, with the magic mirror the Green-Eyed One gave her. Aided by Monday, who is turned into a garden gnome afterward, Elspeth, disguised as Josephine, finds her and convinces her to eat the enchanted and poisoned apple, which seemingly kills Snow White.|$|E
5|$|The Arabian Peninsula {{was largely}} arid and volcanic, making {{agriculture}} difficult except near oases or springs. The landscape was dotted with towns and cities; {{two of the}} most prominent being Mecca and Medina. Medina was a large flourishing agricultural settlement, while Mecca was an important financial center for many surrounding tribes. Communal life was essential for survival in the desert conditions, supporting indigenous tribes against the harsh environment and lifestyle. Tribal affiliation, whether based on kinship or alliances, was an important source of social cohesion. Indigenous Arabs were either nomadic or sedentary, the former constantly travelling <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> seeking water and pasture for their flocks, while the latter settled and focused on trade and agriculture. Nomadic survival also depended on raiding caravans or oases; nomads did not view this as a crime.|$|E
5|$|While Miller {{was working}} on a BBC Three sitcom he pitched the idea to {{producer}} Stephen McCrum. McCrum criticised the way Miller ended the first script, which ended with Nelson and Marion leave where they live. McCrum told him it was best to set the series in a single place rather than have the characters move <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>another.</b> McCrum then suggested taking Nelson and Marion, and writing a script about them. Later, another writer, Jon Brown came in to write and at this time rules were set out with regards to writing the show, such as the animals could not be dressed in clothes unless it was in a flashback sequence or during a song.|$|E

5|$|In the soil, {{the roots}} {{encounter}} the hyphae of fungi. Many {{of these are}} known as mycorrhiza and form a mutualistic relationship with the tree roots. Some are specific to a single tree species, which will not flourish {{in the absence of}} its mycorrhizal associate. Others are generalists and associate with many species. The tree acquires minerals such as phosphorus from the fungus while it obtains the carbohydrate products of photosynthesis from the tree. The hyphae of the fungus can link different trees and a network is formed, transferring nutrients <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>another.</b> The fungus promotes growth of the roots and helps protect the trees against predators and pathogens. It can also limit damage done to a tree by pollution as the fungus accumulate heavy metals within its tissues. Fossil evidence shows that roots have been associated with mycorrhizal fungi since the early Paleozoic, four hundred million years ago, when the first vascular plants colonised dry land.|$|E

25|$|Basically, an {{information}} society is {{the means of}} getting information <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> (Wark, 1997, p.22).

25|$|Although F.auricularia have {{well-developed}} wings, {{they are}} fairly weak and are rarely, if ever, used. Instead, as their main form of transportation, earwigs are carried <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> on clothing or commercial products like lumber, ornamental shrubs and even newspaper bundles.|$|E
50|$|Lymphadenitis can {{be caused}} by various species that is {{different}} <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> another; but again, MAC is the main cause worldwide.

25|$|As {{the name}} suggests, Shelties can {{and have been}} used as sheepdogs and still {{participate}} in sheepdog trials to this day. Herding dogs conduct livestock <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> by causing fear-flocking and flight behavior. The instinct to herd is primarily a product of breeding. No amount of training can substitute this trait.|$|E

25|$|When {{you take}} a tree that {{is rooted in the}} ground, and {{transfer}} it <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>another,</b> the tree will no longer bear fruit.

25|$|Differences in {{hydraulic}} head (h) cause water <b>to</b> move <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> another; water flows from locations of high h to locations of low h. Hydraulic head {{is composed of}} pressure head (ψ) and elevation head (z). The head gradient is the change in {{hydraulic head}} per length of flowpath, and appears in Darcy's law as being proportional to the discharge.|$|R
25|$|Animal locomotion, in ethology, is any of {{a variety}} of {{movements}} or methods that animals use to move <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>another.</b> Some modes of locomotion are (initially) self-propelled, e.g., running, swimming, jumping, flying, hopping, soaring and gliding. There are also many animal species that depend on their environment for transportation, a type of mobility called passive locomotion, e.g., sailing (some jellyfish), kiting (spiders) and rolling (some beetles and spiders).|$|E
25|$|Cook had an {{ultimate}} goal to put tourism {{in the service}} of unifying the Italian state before Italian unification. He became more aware of Italian politics and became particularly concerned with the fate of the newly unified Italian state.

25|$|In {{his book}} , Dr. Paul recounts {{the events of}} David Hartman's abduction.

He also told of physical signs such as nausea, insomnia, and nightmares of inhuman faces {{coming out of the}} dark.|$|E
25|$|The trot is {{the working}} gait for a horse. Despite what one sees in movies, horses can only canter and gallop {{for short periods}} at a time, after which they need time to rest and recover. Horses in good {{condition}} can maintain a working trot for hours. The trot is the main way horses travel quickly <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> the next.|$|R
50|$|Euphrasia {{was known}} for her humility, meekness, and charity; her abbess often advised her to perform manual labor when she was {{burdened}} with temptations.
