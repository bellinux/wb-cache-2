25|$|ELPJ, a Japanese-based company, sells a laser {{turntable}} {{that uses}} a laser to read vinyl discs optically, without physical contact. The laser turntable eliminates record wear {{and the possibility of}} accidental scratches, which degrade the sound, but its expense limits use primarily to <b>digital</b> <b>archiving</b> of analog records, and the laser does not play back colored vinyl or picture discs. Various other laser-based turntables were tried during the 1990s, but while a laser reads the groove very accurately, since it does not touch the record, the dust that vinyl attracts due to static electric charge is not mechanically pushed out of the groove, worsening sound quality in casual use compared to conventional stylus playback.|$|E
