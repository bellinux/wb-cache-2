5|$|Antisemitism {{was common}} in Germany and {{throughout}} Europe during this period, and Manstein's {{attitude towards the}} Jews had its roots in his exposure to and assimilation of these views. His actions were a reflection of his loyalty toward Hitler and the Nazi regime and of his grounding <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> duty based on traditional Prussian military values. His criticism of Hitler was based solely on their disagreements over {{the conduct of the}} war, not about the regime's racial policies. Some historians, including Antony Beevor and Beno√Æt Lemay, are of the opinion that Manstein had some Jewish ancestry. Manstein was the only Reichswehr officer who opposed the introduction of the Aryan paragraph in 1934. He sent a letter of protest to General Beck, commenting that anyone who had volunteered to serve in the armed forces had already proven their worth.|$|E
25|$|Phase 4 - Endonormative stabilization: This {{stage is}} {{characterized}} by the gradual acceptance of local norms, supported by a new locally rooted linguistic self-confidence. By this time political events {{have made it clear that}} the settler and indigenous strands are inextricably bound <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> nationhood independent of Britain. Acceptance of local English(es) expresses this new identity. National dictionaries are enthusiastically supported, at least for new lexis (and not always for localized grammar).

At the close of the American Civil War the northern-born and southern-born residents of Falls Church each kept to themselves, with long memories of who was who. This ended during World War I, as the village formed a home defense league, the Colonial Rifles, which was active throughout the war.

25|$|Meredith Starr met Meher Baba in Toka, India on 30 June 1928. In 1931 Starr {{established}} a retreat center at East Challacombe, North Devon (a {{couple of miles}} from Combe Martin), where he invited Meher Baba to come and meet westerners. It was at the Devon retreat that many of Meher Baba's lasting followers from Europe and the United States first met Baba. Meredith was famously lacking <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humor and had a particular sense of how spiritual conduct should be, thus enforcing strong codes of serious contemplative conduct that made even Meher Baba uncomfortable. Yet he is considered to have {{played a central role}} in introducing Meher Baba to the western world.|$|E
25|$|This act {{begins by}} reestablishing {{the aura of}} romantic mystery which began Act 1. This is evoked {{by the use of}} high violins and wind chords together, similar to that of Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring. The first {{movement}} is characterised by the constant change of tempo, while the second picks up influences from other musical styles in particular that of rhythmic impulse and swooning which characterised Ravel's work. The next movement features solid writing for a chorus of brass instruments, after which high violins are heard over a very low accompaniment. This section also features many solos for various instruments, followed by a pas de trois above a gently undulating accompaniment where lyrical melody lines are heard, with the oboe able to penetrate the whole texture in expressive fashion. The following variation is typical of 19th century ballet music and begins with the violins before spreading {{to the rest of the}} orchestra. Brass, prominent timpani and incisive pizzicato chords in the strings culminate <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> urgency in the music which prepares for the musical tension in the final act.|$|E
25|$|The {{observational}} method applied to consciousness {{gives us the}} science of psychology. This is the basis and the only proper basis of ontology or metaphysics, the science of being, and of the philosophy of history. To the observation of consciousness Cousin adds induction as the complement of his method, by which he means inference as to reality necessitated by the data of consciousness, and regulated by certain laws found in consciousness, those of reason. By his method of observation and induction as thus explained, his philosophy will be found to be marked off very clearly, {{on the one hand}} from the deductive construction of notions of an absolute system, as represented either by Schelling or Hegel, which Cousin regards as based simply on hypothesis and abstraction, illegitimately obtained; and on the other, from that of Kant, and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense,</b> <b>of</b> Sir W. Hamilton, both of which in the view of Cousin are limited to psychology, and merely relative or phenomenal knowledge, and issue in scepticism so far as the great realities of ontology are concerned. What Cousin finds psychologically in the individual consciousness, he finds also spontaneously expressed in the common sense or universal experience of humanity. In fact, it is with him the function of philosophy to classify and explain universal convictions and beliefs; but common-sense is not with him philosophy, nor is it the instrument of philosophy; it is simply the material on which the philosophical method works, and in harmony with which its results must ultimately be found.|$|E

Some escalated into violence resulting in more than 200 reported deaths, attacks on Danish and other European diplomatic missions, attacks on churches and Christians, and a major international boycott. Some groups responded to the outpouring of protest by endorsing the Danish policies, launching [...] "Buy Danish" [...] campaigns and other displays of support.

500|$|According to O'Neill, {{the film}} is an [...] "intersection of fact and hallucination". It is set inside the {{decaying}} halls of the closed Ambassador Hotel, former home to the Cocoanut Grove restaurant and the first Academy Awards ceremonies. The film superimposes reenactments of classic Hollywood films onto shots of the dilapidated establishment, with ghostly gangsters and their gun molls interacting with icy blondes and wisecracking bartenders in carefully deconstructed snatches of dialogue. O'Neill's time-lapse photography lends the film an ethereal effect that serves an intentionally distancing purpose. In this study of the historic Hollywood edifice, there is no discernible plot {{and there are no}} recurring characters. The film construction has the appearance of snippets taken from lost films of the 1940s; it uses surreal vignettes of nude men and women, stop-motion animated mannequin torsos, flickering film projections and dim light bulbs to create what devolves <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> nightmares, giving a result that feels more like an art installation than the expected film.|$|E
500|$|In an interview, Coldplay vocalist Chris Martin {{revealed}} that the song was written in mid-2004 and was inspired by Martin's daughter, Apple, and English alternative rock singer Kate Bush: [...] "That's a song where we were listening {{to a lot of}} Kate Bush last summer, and we wanted a song which had a lot of tom-toms in it. I just had my daughter up also, and was kind of feeling <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> awe and wonderment, so the song is kind of a Kate Bush song about miracles." [...] The drumbeat of the song was inspired by Bush's 1985 song [...] "Running Up that Hill". In a separate interview, bassist Guy Berryman said: [...] "We were really trying to recreate the drums on that song for this song, and the chords. Some bands are reluctant to admit that they take things from other artists and bands that they listen to and we're shameless in that respect, we don't mind telling." ...|$|E

500|$|In his The Pleasures of Japanese Literature, Keene claims Murasaki {{wrote the}} [...] "supreme work of Japanese fiction" [...] by drawing on traditions of waka court diaries, and earlier monogatari‚Äîwritten {{in a mixture}} of Chinese script and Japanese script‚Äîsuch as The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter or The Tales of Ise. She drew on and blended styles from Chinese histories, {{narrative}} poetry and contemporary Japanese prose. Adolphson writes that the juxtaposition of formal Chinese style with mundane subjects resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> parody or satire, giving her a distinctive voice. Genji follows the traditional format of monogatari‚Äîtelling a tale‚Äîparticularly evident in its use of a narrator, but Keene claims Murasaki developed the genre far beyond its bounds, and by doing so created a form that is utterly modern. The story of the [...] "shining prince" [...] Genji is set in the late 9th to early 10th centuries, and Murasaki eliminated from it the elements of fairy tales and fantasy frequently found in earlier monogatari.|$|E
500|$|The album reached #4 on the Japan Oricon charts, {{and sold}} 101,000 copies as of January 2010.

Ben Schweitzer of RPGFan, however, found that the heavy reliance of the soundtrack on music and themes from previous Final Fantasy soundtracks resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> [...] "stretched creativity" [...] and [...] "a bit of blandness", though he still felt it was not [...] "a bad soundtrack... not really a great soundtrack." [...] Other reviewers, however, such as Engelhorn and Tyler Schulley of Final Fantasy Symphony, enjoyed the fact that it pulled from previous soundtracks, feeling that it gave the album [...] "the classic feel of the older Final Fantasies" [...] while still being [...] "original and beautiful".|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} a {{peaceful}} community of nations had been proposed {{as far back as}} 1795, when Immanuel Kant's [...] outlined the idea of a league of nations to control conflict and promote peace between states. Kant argued {{for the establishment of a}} peaceful world community, not <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> a global government, but in the hope that each state would declare itself a free state that respects its citizens and welcomes foreign visitors as fellow rational beings, thus promoting peaceful society worldwide. International co-operation to promote collective security originated in the Concert of Europe that developed after the Napoleonic Wars in the 19th century in an attempt to maintain the status quo between European states and so avoid war. [...] This period also saw the development of international law, with the first Geneva Conventions establishing laws dealing with humanitarian relief during wartime, and the international Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 governing rules of war and the peaceful settlement of international disputes. As historians William H. Harbaugh and Ronald E. Powaski point out, Theodore Roosevelt was the first American President to call for an international league. [...] At the acceptance for his Nobel Prize, Roosevelt said: [...] "it would be a masterstroke if those great powers honestly bent on peace would form a League of Peace" ...|$|E

500|$|Ray Perkins {{replaced}} Leeman Bennett as {{the third}} head coach in Buccaneers history. Expectations had been that owner Hugh Culverhouse would hire popular ex-Tampa Bay Bandits coach Steve Spurrier, but Perkins was the only candidate interviewed. Perkins had been approached about the job two years earlier, but was not interested at the time. He was given the same title (Head Coach and Vice-President of Football Operations) as the previous two coaches. He brought along seven of his Alabama assistants: linebackers coach Sylvester Croom, assistant coach John Bobo, running backs coach Rodney Stokes, defensive line coach Mike DuBose, strength coach Kent Johnston, head trainer Chris Smith, and defensive coordinator Joe Kines, who had previously been Charley Pell's defensive coordinator with the Florida Gators. He rounded out his staff with Kansas City Chiefs secondary coach Doug Graber and receivers coach Richard Williamson, Buffalo Bills defensive coordinator Herb Paterra, SMU defensive coordinator Bill Clay, and Atlanta Falcons offensive line coach Larry Beightol. Perkins also overhauled the scouting staff, firing most of them (including Jim Gruden, father of future Buccaneers coach Jon Gruden) shortly after the draft. No reason was given, but some observers, most outspokenly Boston Globe columnist Will McDonough, felt that the Buccaneers' office was staffed heavily with people whose main experience was in college football, and that the team suffered {{from a lack of}} NFL knowledge. Recently fired Falcons coach Dan Henning turned down the offensive coordinator position, as he had been trying to rebuild the Falcons {{and did not want to}} relive that experience with another team. Perkins had previously been hired as head coach of the New York Giants on the basis of his experience working with a losing franchise (the New England Patriots) that needed turning around. Perkins coached the Giants back to the playoffs, leaving four years later to succeed coaching legend Bear Bryant at the University of Alabama. Ironically, irritation over the 1982 players' strike was a major factor in Perkins' leaving the Giants, and became an issue he had to contend with again in 1987. Frustration with what he saw as overregulation by the NCAA played a part in Perkins' decision to return to the NFL. Along with $750,000 a year for five years, Perkins was given free rein to run the Buccaneers however he wanted. Some players were enthusiastic about the Perkins hire. [...] "Coach Perkins will bring <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> pride here, and that's something we've been missing", said tackle Ron Heller. Others were upset with Perkins' military-style manner, saying that he [...] "made playing football a miserable experience".|$|E
