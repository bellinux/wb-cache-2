Despite its {{ecological}} and economic importance, scientific data on its exploitation are still very scarce. The {{aim of this study}} is to: (i) analyze the relationship between the catch per unit effort (CPUE) and possible factors that might have caused the trends observed, (ii) study the temporal and spatial trends in CPUE, (iii) identify the spatial distribution of catches, and (iv) compare the size and age structure of catches. CPUE varies over spatial and temporal scales but shows annual stability. The study reveals that CPUE varies significantly as a function of month, strata and depth. Our results show a seasonal pattern of captures during the spawning period (May) and the associated size class is mainly composed of mature individuals. The length and age frequency histograms of the common <b>dentex</b> show that after the spawning period (June-September) exploitation is mostly made up of small/young and immature individuals.

In 2009 - 2010 samples of larvae and tank water were collected at 5 different occasions. After inoculations of samples, bacterial isolates were identified with standard biochemical methods. The antagonistic effects of the identified probiotic bacteria against P. damselae subsp. damselae isolated from different mariculture fishes were determined by using disc diffusion method. Bacillus cereus, B. macquariensis, and other Bacillus sp., Micrococcus luteus, Flavobacterium flevense and Flavobacterium sp. were identified as candidate probiotic species and their antagonistic effect against different P. damselae isolates was identified. The results of this study showed that B. cereus and M. luteus are more effective against Photobacterium damselae subsp. damselae.

40|$|Abstract. The {{study of}} mucosal surfaces, and in {{particular}} the fish skin and its secreted mucus, has been of great interest recently among immunologists. Measurement of the viscosity and other physico-chemical parameters (protein concentration, pH, conductivity, redox potential, osmolality and density) of the skin mucus can help to understand its biological functions. We have used five marine species of teleost: gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata L.), European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax L.), shi drum (Umbrina cirrosa L.), common <b>dentex</b> (<b>Dentex</b> <b>dentex</b> L.) and dusky grouper (Epinephelus marginatus L.), all of them with commercial interest in the aquaculture of the Mediterranean area. Mucus showed a direct shear- and temperaturedependent viscosity, with a non-Newtonian behavior, which differed however between two groups: one with higher viscosity (D. labrax, U. cirrosa, D. <b>dentex)</b> and the other with lower viscosity (S. aurata, E. marginatus). In addition, there was a clear interrelation between density and osmolality, as well as between density and temperature. Taking into account that high values of viscosity should improve the barrier effect against pathogens but low values of viscosity are needed for good locomotion characteristics, our results may help elucidate the relationship between physico-chemical and biological parameters of skin mucus, and disease susceptibility.

The isolated strains were tested for in vitro antagonistic activity against Listonella anguillarum, a pathogen bacterium diffused in Mediterranean aquaculture and affecting various fish species. The isolated bacterial strains showed antagonistic activity against the pathogenic bacterium, suggesting a possible role of isolates as probiotics. In this study, for the first time, bacterial strains of the species B. marisflavi, known as an environmental species, were recovered in the gut microbiota of a healthy fish. The use of the isolates characterized in this study, mainly the yellow-pigmented bacterium, is suggested as possible probiotics to improve fish health, along with alternative methods of maintaining a healthy environment...|$|R

Nine isonitrogenous (43 %) and isoenergetic (22 MJ kg− 1) diets were formulated combining three types, pregelatinized starch (PS), dextrin (Dx) andmaltodextrin (Mx), and three levels (12, 18 and 24 %) of carbohydrates. Growth performancewas not significantly influenced by treatments. The best feed utilizationwas observed in 18 % Mx group. Higher hepatic lipid content was found in fish fed lower dietary carbohydrate levels.

A total of 260 samples from larvae at different feeding stages were examined, 15 healthy and 50 moribund juvenile <b>dentex</b> were sampled over a 2 -year period. Bacterial isolates (n= 433) from healthy and moribund fish and their environments were identified by biochemical methods; 75 % of them were identified as Gram-negative (mainly Vibrio spp.) and 25 % as Gram-positive.

The activities of catalase-CAT, superoxide dismutase-SOD, glutathione peroxidase-GPX, glutathione reductase-GR and glucose 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase-G 6 PDH, SOD isoenzymatic profile, lipid peroxidation-LPO and protein oxidation-PO were determined in liver and white muscle. SOD and CAT were not affected. GPX in liver and white muscle and GR in liver increased at higher inclusion carbohydrates levels. The lowest levels of GR and G 6 PDH in both tissues and LPO in liverwere observed in maltodextrin groups. No significant effects by carbohydrate sourcewere observed in liver PO and white muscle LPO. Regarding carbohydrate level effect, 18 % and 24 % dietary inclusion level decreased LPO in white muscle and PO in liver. LPO in liver was also decreased at 24 % inclusion level.

First, lectin binding results suggests that skin mucus contain, in order of abundance, N-acetylneuraminic acid, glucose, N-acetyl-glucosamine, N-acetyl-galactosamine, galactose and fucose residues. Second, results showed that while some immune activities were very similar in the studied fish (e. g.

High levels of peroxidase and protease activity were found in U. cirrosa respect to the values obtained in the other species while E. marginatus and S. aurata showed the highest levels of alkaline phosphatase and esterase activities, respectively.

Growth performance was lowest in fish given diets containing 44. 4 or 49. 5 % protein and 12 % lipid and was improved (P < 0. 05) either with diets supplying 55. 8 % protein (regardless of dietary lipid) or 49. 3 % protein and 17. 4 % lipid. The results observed in the second trial suggest that when protein efficiency or retention are considered even dietary levels of 44. 3 % protein and 17. 2 % lipid (i. e. 24. 3 g protein kJ(- 1) calculated available energy) could be assumed as suitable levels for formulating practical diets for this species, providing high quality fish meal and oil are used...|$|R

[...] 2 pages, 1 figure, 1 tableThe {{abundance}} {{and composition of}} fish assemblages varies at different temporal scales {{as a product of}} diel and annual rhythms. In this study, we used a video-wired observatory (OBSEA, www. obsea. es) to monitor annual rhythms in a coastal fish assemblage with a 3 -year data set (2012 - 2014). The photographs were acquired at 30 min frequency. Five species of the family Sparidae were studied (i. e. <b>Dentex</b> <b>dentex,</b> Diplodus sargus, Diplodus vulgaris, Diplodus annularis and Diplodus puntazzo) together with water temperature and daylength. The results of the annual rhythmicity analysis indicated that most of the peaks of abundance occured in the autumn months.

The samples were isolated from several specimens of Dicentrarchus labrax, the type host, and <b>Dentex</b> <b>dentex.</b> The molecular analysis of complete Internal Transcribed Spacer sequences of ribosomal DNA revealed that specimens isolated from each host species form two well-defined groups, whose sequence divergence reaches 7. 5 %. The morphological study showed that the two groups can be distinguished by several characters, including the level of maximum body breadth, the relative position of the testes, {{the shape of the}} cirrus pouch, and the extent of the uterus. Multivariate analyses of morphometrics demonstrated consistency of most of the characters for discriminating the two groups. Our results show that C. labracis specimens isolated from D. labrax and D. <b>dentex</b> represent clearly distinct entities from molecular, morphological and statistical points of view, which has enabled us to describe a new species, Cainocreadium dentecis n. sp...|$|R

Dr Johnson's friend Hester Thrale was enthusiastic for [...] "the most excellent, the most incomparable fish I ever ate; red mullets large as our mackerel, and of singularly high flavour; beside calamaro or ink-fish, a dainty worth of imperial luxury".

In the Bay there are installed 44 floating cages of 5 by 10 m dimensions. The cages are used for the culture of about 70 tons of sea water fish: gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata), sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), sharp–snouted sparus (Diplodus puntazzo) and <b>dentex</b> (<b>Dentex</b> <b>dentex).</b> Besides some physico–chemical parameters (sea water temperature, transparence and salinity), special {{attention has been paid}} to the qualitative composition of net phytoplankton. Investigations were performed in the period of May, September and December 2003 and February 2004 at five locations in the Kaldonta Bay (Figure 1) at the depths of 0. 5 m, 5 m, 10 m and 1 m from the bottom. According to the physico–chemical parameters, sea water temperature was influenced by the temperature of the environment, and the transparence suggested to the oligotrophic situation in the investigated aquatorium. Qualitative composition of net phytoplankton comprised 161 microphytic species belonging to the systematic compartments of Cyanobacteria, Chrysophyta and Dinophyta (Table 1). The most numerous algal group were diatoms or Bacillarophyceae (98 species or 61 %), with relative frequencies of species from 1 to 7. Taxonomic composition of diatoms showed Chaetoceros–Rhizosolenia (Proboscia) to be the dominant community. Diatom species was the most abundant in late autumn period (beginning of December). The second most important comparatment were Dinophyta (55 species or 34. 1 %), with the dominant genera Ceratium and Protoperidinium. During the investigation, the representatives of Dinophyta did not show large variety of species in the water column. Relative frequency of the species was 1, rarely 2 and 3. Dinophyts were the most abundant in September. From Cyanobacteria (5 species or 3. 1 %) only filamentous algae were determined, with relative frequency from 1 to 3.

40|$|International audienceThe ultrastructural {{organization}} of the female reproductive system of Metadena depressa, digenean intestinal parasite of Sparidae (<b>Dentex</b> <b>dentex),</b> was investigated by electron microscopy. The vitellogenesis is divided into four stages: stage I, vitellocytes have a cytoplasm mainly filled with ribosomes and few mitochondria; stage II, beginning of the synthetic activity; stage III, active shell globule clusters synthesis; stage IV, mature vitellocytes are filled with shell globule clusters and generally contain several large lipid droplets. Glycogen granules are grouped at {{the periphery of the}} cell. The three stages of the oogenesis process take place in the ovary: stage I, oogonia are undifferentiated small cells located at the periphery of the organ; stage II, primary oocytes possess a higher nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio and a nucleus with a nucleolus and synaptonemal complexes indicating the zygotene-pachytene stage of the first meiotic division; stage III, mature oocytes are located in the proximal region of the organ and possess a cytoplasmic chromatoid body and cortical granules in a monolayer close to the periphery of the cell...|$|R
40|$|Common <b>dentex</b> (<b>Dentex</b> <b>dentex)</b> were reared from egg {{stage to}} {{marketable}} size in a flow-through system at ambient conditions during a {{three years period}} (1992 - 1994). A series of rearing experiments were conducted {{in order to determine}} biological traits important for the evaluation of this potential aquaculture candidate. In juveniles (2. 5 - 50 g), growth rates were found to be exceptionally high compared to other aquaculture species and food conversion very efficient (FC#approx# 1, based on food dry matter). Results wre attained under ambient conditions (Temperature: #approx# 25 C, Salinity: 40 - 42 ppt). Feeding consisted of moist diets (35 % H_ 2 O) with high energy (22 - 24 MJ/kg) and high protein (51 - 53 %) content. Feeding exclusively commercial dry pellets (isocaloric to the moist diet), resulted in significantly reduced growth rates, reduced food conversion efficiencies, increased mortalities due to agonistic behaviour and an increased disease susceptibility. The poor performance of test specimens fed dry diets compared to those fed self - prepared most diets was not explained by the different moisture content of the test diets (8 - 10 % vs 35 - 50 %). Common <b>dentex</b> reach marketable size (300 - 500 g) within 14 - 18 months after hatching under favourable ambient conditions (South Aegean Sea), while feeding self - prepared moist diets. This is in the range of established aquaculture species in the Mediterranean Sea. The possibility to protect common <b>dentex</b> against losses due to an infectious disease by oral application of different immunostimulants (#beta#- 1, 3 / 1, 6 glucans; MacroGard"T"M, VitaStim"T"M) was tested in this study. Disease outbreaks are not securely prevented, but treated test groups showed lower overall mortality, while subsequent mortalities were clearly related to treatment. The study analyzes 9 morphometric characters (total length, standard length, fork length, pre- and post anal length, head length, body height, mouth opening, eye diameter) and describes their allometric development in juvenile and adult <b>dentex</b> (n= 69 - 463). The occurrence of abnormalities was monitored and described during all rearing periods. Seven types of skeletal deformations and one abnormal scale development were identified. One incident of gas bubble disease, caused by a gas supersaturation of 110 % is described. A swimbladder stress syndrome (SBSS) was assumed to occur during the acclimation of wild broodstock-fish to conditions in captivity. (orig.)

U uvali su postavljena 44 plutajuća kaveza veličine 5 x 10 metara u kojima se uspješno proizvodi oko 70 tona morske ribe: komarča (Sparus aurata), lubin (Dicentrarchus labrax), pic (Diplodus puntazzo) i zubatac (<b>Dentex</b> <b>dentex).</b> Uz neke fizikalnokemijske pokazatelje (temperatura mora, prozirnost, salinitet), posebna je pozornost posvećena kvalitativnom sastavu mrežnog fitoplanktona, a istraživanje je provedeno tijekom godine 2003. (svibanj, rujan, prosinac) i 2004. (veljača) na pet lokaliteta u uvali Kaldonta (Slika 1), na dubinama od 0, 5 m, 5 m, 10 m, 20 m i 1 metar iznad dna. Prema fizikalnim i kemijskim pokazateljima, temperatura mora bila je pod utjecajem {{temperature}} okoliša, a prozirnost upućuje na oligotrofiju istraživanog akvatorija tijekom istraživanog razdoblja. U kvalitativnom sastavu mrežnog fitoplanktona, utvrđena je 161 vrsta mikrofita, a pripadale su sistematskim odjeljcima Cyanobacteria, Chrysophyta i Dinophyta (Tablica 1). Najbrojnija skupina alga bile su dijatomeje ili Bacillariophyceae (98 vrsta ili 61 %) s relativnim učestalostima vrsta od 1 do 7. Taksonomski sastav dijatomeja upućuje na dominantnu zajednicu Chaetoceros –Rhizosolenia (Proboscia), a najviše dijatomejskih vrsta nađeno je u kasnojesenskom razdoblju (početak prosinca). Subdominantan brojnošću vrsta bio je odjel Dinophyta (55 vrsta ili 34, 1 %), s dominantnim vrstama rodova Ceratium i Protoperidinium. Tijekom istraživanja predstavnici spomenutog odjela nisu pokazivali veliku raznolikost vrsta u vodenom stupcu. Relativna učestalost vrsta bila je uglavnom 1, rjeđe 2 i 3, a najviše je dinofita nađeno u rujnu. Od Cyanobacteria (5 vrsta ili 3, 1 %) utvrđene su samo nitaste alge s relativnom frekvencijom od 1 do 3. Kvalitativni sastav mrežnog fitoplanktona upućuje na sličan sastav vrsta u vodenom stupcu na svim istraživanim lokalitetima.
