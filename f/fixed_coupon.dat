5000|$|In finance, a {{fixed rate}} bond {{is a type}} of debt {{instrument}} bond with a <b>fixed</b> <b>coupon</b> (interest) rate, as opposed to a floating rate note. A fixed rate bond is a long term debt paper that carries a predetermined interest rate. The interest rate is known as coupon rate and interest is payable at specified dates before bond maturity.Due to the <b>fixed</b> <b>coupon,</b> the market value of a fixed-rate bond is susceptible to fluctuations in interest rates, and therefore has a significant amount of interest rate risk. That being said, the fixed-rate bond, although a conservative investment, is highly susceptible to a loss in value due to inflation. The fixed-rate bond’s long maturity schedule and predetermined coupon rate offers an investor a solidified return, while leaving the individual exposed to a rise in the consumer price index and overall decrease in their purchasing power.|$|E
5000|$|A {{new series}} of CDS indices is issued every six months by Markit. Running up to the {{announcement}} of each series a group of investment banks is polled to determine the credit entities that will form the constituents of the new issue. This process is intended {{to ensure that the}} index does not become [...] "cluttered" [...] with instruments that no longer exist, or which trade extremely illiquidly. On the day of issue a <b>fixed</b> <b>coupon</b> is decided for the whole index based on the credit spread of the entities in the index. This coupon is set usually to 100bps (1% p.a.) for predominantly Investment Grade indices and 500bps for predominantly speculative grade indices to follow the convention of Standard North American Corporates (SNAC). Prior to SNAC (i.e. CDX.NA.IG Series 3 through 11) the coupons were set to approximate the average weighted spread of the names in that index.

50|$|A {{split share}} {{corporation}} is a corporation that exists for a defined {{period of time}} to transform the risk and investment return (capital gains, dividends, and possibly also profits from the writing of covered options) of a basket of shares of conventional dividend-paying corporations into the risk and return of the two or more classes of publicly traded shares in the split share corporation. Most commonly a split share corporation issues equal numbers of shares from a class of preferred shares and a class of capital or class A shares. The proceeds of the share offering are invested in conventional dividend-paying shares according to the regulations of the split share corporation. The preferred shares typically offer relatively high and secure dividend yield at a <b>fixed</b> <b>coupon</b> rate but with no expectation of capital gain by the time that the split share corporation is wound up. The capital shares often (but not in every corporation) pay a dividend like the preferred shares; in addition, the capital shares offer participation in the leveraged capital gains (or losses) of the underlying basket of conventional shares.|$|E

50|$|A {{fixed rate}} CMO tranche {{can be further}} {{restructured}} into an Interest Only (IO) tranche and a discount <b>coupon</b> <b>fixed</b> rate tranche. An IO pays a coupon only based on a notional principal, it receives no principal payments from amortization or prepayments. Notional principal {{does not have any}} cash flows but shadows the principal changes of the original tranche, and it is this principal off which the coupon is calculated. For example, a $100mm PAC tranche off 6% collateral with a 6% coupon ('6 off 6' or '6-squared') can be cut into a $100mm PAC tranche with a 5% coupon (and hence a lower dollar price) called a '5 off 6', and a PAC IO tranche with a notional principal of $16.666667mm and paying a 6% coupon. Note the resulting notional principle of the IO is less than the original principal. Using the example, the IO is created by taking 1% of coupon off the 6% original coupon gives an IO of 1% coupon off $100mm notional principal, but this is by convention 'normalized' to a 6% coupon (as the collateral was originally 6% coupon) by reducing the notional principal to $16.666667mm ($100mm / 6).|$|R

It proves availability of two groups of interconnections between the cost of a bond, coupon rate, market rate (rate of return) and term of its payment. The first group of interconnections reflects interconnections between the cost of a bond, coupon rate and market rate (rate of return). The second group characterises connection between the bond cost and term of its payment. The authors study the average weighted duration of payments.

Taking into account the average weighted duration of payments the article recommends a formula, as more efficient, for identification of the future bond price depending on change of profitability.

40|$|Respondent-driven {{sampling}} (RDS) is a link-tracing network {{sampling strategy}} {{for collecting data}} from hard-to-reach populations, such as injection drug users or individuals {{at high risk of}} being infected with HIV. The mechanism is to find initial participants (seeds), and give each of them a <b>fixed</b> number of <b>coupons</b> allowing them to recruit people they know from the population of interest, with a mutual financial incentive. The new participants are given coupons again and the process repeats. Currently, the standard RDS estimator used in practice is known as the Volz-Heckathorn (VH) estimator. It relies on strong assumptions about the underlying social network and the RDS process. Via simulation, we study the relative performance of the plain mean and VH estimator when assumptions of the latter are not satisfied, under different network types (including homophily and rich-get-richer networks), participant referral patterns, and varying number of coupons. The analysis demonstrates that the plain mean outperforms the VH estimator in many but not all of the simulated settings, including homophily networks. Also, we highlight the implications of multiple recruitment and varying referral patterns on the depth of RDS process. We develop interactive visualizations of the findings and RDS process to further build insight into the various factors contributing to the performance of current RDS estimation techniques...|$|R

The members had the nominal thicknesses of 0. 48, 1. 0 and 1. 2 mm. The column length of the test specimens varied from 300 to 3200 mm with an increment of approximately 600 mm. The column specimens were compressed between <b>fixed</b> ends. Tensile <b>coupon</b> tests were also conducted to obtain the material properties at both flat and corner portions of the sections. Initial local and overall geometric imperfections were measured. The columns were failed by local, distortional, flexural buckling and the interaction of these buckling modes.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a structural credit risk {{model of a}} bank that issues deposits, shareholders' equity, and <b>fixed</b> or floating <b>coupon</b> bonds {{in the form of}} contingent capital or subordinated debt. The return on the bank's assets follows a jump-diffusion process, and default-free interest rates are stochastic. The equilibrium pricing of the bank's deposits, contingent capital, and shareholders' equity is studied for various parameter values haracterizing the bank's risk and the contractual terms of its contingent capital. Allowing for the possibility of jumps in the bank's asset value, as might occur during a financial crisis, has distinctive implications for valuing contingent capital. Credit spreads on contingent capital are higher the lower is the value of shareholders' equity at which conversion occurs and the larger is the conversion discount from the bond's par value. The effect of requiring a decline in a financial stock price index for conversion (dual price trigger) is to make contingent capital more similar to non-convertible subordinated debt. The paper also examines the bank's incentive to increase risk when it issues different forms of contingent capital as well as subordinated debt. In general, a bank that issues contingent capital has a moral hazard incentive to raise its assets' risk of jumps, particularly when the value of equity at the conversion threshold is low. However, moral hazard when issuing contingent capital tends to be less than when issuing subordinated debt. Because it reduces effective leverage and the pressure for government bailouts, contingent capital deserves serious consideration as part of a package of reforms that stabilize the financial system and eliminate "Too-Big-to-Fail.

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} the pricing models of several equity-linked insurance products and LIBOR exotic derivatives. Some analytic approximations and numerical methods {{are applied to}} value those products if the closed-form solution does not exist. Pricing behaviours are also explored. I first analyze the dynamic fund protection which entitles the investor the right to reset his investment fund value to a reference stock index value. With embedded early withdrawal right, the valuation of these protected funds can be modeled as a free boundary value problem. Next I construct the contingent claims models that price participating poli-cies with interest rate crediting mechanism, sharing profits from an investment portfolio. Usually the interest is credited to the policy holder at or above cer-tain specified guaranteed rate periodically. The policy holder may also receive a terminal bonus. However the insurer may default at maturity. Under certain assumptions, the perturbation technique is used to approximate the solution. The guaranteed annuity option provides the holder the right to either receive at retirement an assured accumulated fund or a life annuity at a fixed rate. I propose three analytic approximation methods including stochastic duration approach, Edgeworth expansion and analytic approximation in affine diffusions to value this option under a multi-factor interest rate model. The target redemption note is an index linked note that provides a guar-anteed sum of coupons (target cap) with possibility of early termination. In a typical structure, the first <b>coupon</b> payment is <b>fixed.</b> The subsequent <b>coupons</b> are calculated based on an inverse floating LIBOR / Euribor formula. Once the accumulated coupon has reached the pre-specified target cap, the note will be terminated with final payment of the par.

40|$|In [10] we {{presented}} a reduced form of risky bond pricing. At default date, a bond seller fails to continue fulfilling his obligation {{and the price}} of the bond sharply drops. For nodefault scenarios, if the face value of the defaulted bond is $ 1 then the bond price just after the default is its’ recovery rate (RR). Rating agencies and theoretical models are trying to predict RR for companies or sovereign countries. The main theoretical problem with a risky bond or with the general debt problems is presenting the price, knowing the RR. The problem of a credit default swap (CDS) pricing is somewhat an adjacent problem. Recall that the corporate bond price inversely depends on interest rate. In case of a default, the credit risk on a debt investment is related to the loss. There is a possibility for a risky bond buyer to reduce his credit risk. This can be achieved through buying a protection from a protection seller. The bondholder would pay a fixed premium up to maturity or default, which ever one comes first. If default comes before maturity, the protection buyer will receive the difference between the initial face value of the bond and RR. This difference is called ‘loss given default’. This contract represents CDS. The counterparty that pays a fixed premium is called CDS buyer or protection buyer; the opposite party is the CDS seller. Note, that in contrast to corporate bond, CDS contract does not assume that the buyer of the CDS is the holder of underlying bond. Also note that underlying to the swap can be any asset. It is called a reference asset or a reference entity. Thus, CDS is a credit instrument that separates credit risk from corresponding underlying entity. The formal type of the CDS can be described as follows. The buyer of the credit swap pays <b>fixed</b> rate or <b>coupon</b> until maturity or default in case it occurs before the maturity. If default does occur, protection buyer delivers cash or a default asset in exchange with the face value of the defaulted debt. These are known as cash or physical settlements. ...|$|R
