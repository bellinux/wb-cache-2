40|$|Recently we {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} Suspension Trapping (STrap) for bottom-up proteomics sample processing that is based upon SDS-mediated protein extraction, swift detergent removal and rapid reactor-type protein digestion in a quartz <b>depth</b> <b>filter</b> trap. As the <b>depth</b> <b>filter</b> surface is made of silica, it is readily modifiable with various functional groups using the silane coupling chemistries. Thus, during the digest, peptides possessing specific features could be targeted for enrichment by the functionalized <b>depth</b> <b>filter</b> material while non-targeted peptides could be collected as an unbound distinct fraction after the digest. In the example presented here the quartz <b>depth</b> <b>filter</b> surface is functionalized with the pyridyldithiol group therefore enabling reversible in-situ capture of the cysteine-containing peptides generated during the STrap-based digest. The described C-STrap method retains all advantages of the original STrap methodology and provides robust foundation for the conception of the targeted in-situ peptide fractionation in the STrap format for bottom-up proteomics.

50|$|<b>Depth</b> <b>filters</b> are {{the variety}} of filters that use a porous {{filtration}} medium to retain particles throughout the medium, rather than just {{on the surface of}} the medium. These filters are commonly used when the fluid to be filtered contains a high load of particles because, relative to other types of filters, they can retain a large mass of particles before becoming clogged.Depth filtration typified by multiple porous layers with depth are used to capture the solid contaminants from the liquid phase. Due to the tortuous and channel-like nature of the filtration medium, the particles are retained throughout the medium within its structure, as opposed to on the surface. <b>Depth</b> <b>filters</b> pose the added advantage that they are able to attain a high quantity of particles without compromising the separation efficiency. <b>Depth</b> <b>filters</b> are commonly characterised by the sand filter and have the ability to be used with substantially higher filter rates than in other designs. It is these characteristics that have cemented the use and popularity of <b>depth</b> <b>filters</b> as an effective medium for separation. With ongoing advances in process technologies depth filter designs are continuously adapting and improving to meet the needs of industry.|$|E

50|$|Backwashing is an {{important}} operation employed to remove filtered solids as this build up causes resistance to filtration to increase with time. Backwashing involves inverting the direction of liquid flow while using clean liquid. This process is employed for times {{in the range of}} 5-15 minutes with typical flow rates per unit area in the range of 6.8- 13.6 L/m2.s. Most designs typically employ backwashing once per day of operation.The operation of <b>depth</b> <b>filters</b> is inherently cyclic due to the necessity of solids removal build up during the process, as such two or more units are typically used so that backwashing does not interfere with the filtration. Effective backwashing occurs when the filter medium is fluidized. Fluidization flow rates generally fall in the range of 20-50 gpm/ft2.|$|E

We also {{evaluated the}} recovery efficiency of the EC and EC-HV filters after a 5 -s backwash postfiltration. The backwashing was not applied to the other filtration methods because of {{the design of the}} filters. Oocysts and cysts were visualized by using a fluorescent monoclonal antibody staining technique. For distilled water, the highest percent recovery for both the oocysts and cysts was obtained with the FM <b>depth</b> <b>filter.</b> However, when a 5 -s backwash was applied, the EC-HV membrane filter (EC-HV-R) was superior to other filters for recovery of both oocysts (n = 53 ± 15. 4 per 10 liters) and cysts (n = 59 ± 11. 5 per 10 liters).

Similar results were obtained with surface water samples. Giardia cysts were recovered at higher rates than were Cryptosporidium oocysts with all five filters, regardless of backwashing.

50|$|The {{main purpose}} of a depth filter is {{to act as a}} clarifier, {{separating}} suspended solids from a bulk flow liquid stream and as a result is employed within the final stage of a separation process. By convention, <b>depth</b> <b>filters</b> consist of a single outlet stream of a purified liquid retaining the waste particles within its system. Due to its length it has greater residue holding capabilities than standard filters. In terms of a waste stream, often the outlet stream may be recycled into a subsequent filter {{in order to ensure that}} the stream is free from particulates.A waste stream may also be produced when cleaning the filter media as the water passes in the opposite direction residue caught within the filter media or media particles that have been displaced may emerge from the unit before it is adequately disposed.|$|E
50|$|Filter {{selection}} is reliant {{on a number}} of variables such load, duration, shape, size and distribution of the substance desired to be filtered. Ideally if the medium is too large, filtrate will be of a poor quality as it will fail to collect particulates within its matrix. Conversely if the medium is very small, solids will accumulate {{on the surface of the}} cartridge causing close to immediate blockages. In regards to the shape using grains that are round in shape have the tendency to erode due to the pressure the inlet stream may possess on the system, whereas grains that are flat (may increase surface area) however may float out of the system during backwash. Particles which are high on Moh’s scale of hardness and have a relatively large specific gravity are often recommended to be used as particle media. The softer and lighter the material is, the more susceptible it is to erosion and fluidisation. Thus particles such as silica and sand are often used as they are affordable however are resistant to the high flows of the incoming fluid.The uniformity coefficient is a measure of the uniformity of the material used within the filter. It is a ratio of a sieve pore that allows 60% of the material through in comparison to a pore size that allows 10% of material through. The closer the ratio is to one, means the closer the particles are in size. An ideal system would have a coefficient between 1.3 and 1.5 and must not exceed 1.7. Anything less than 1.3 is an indication that it is unnecessary to the system and may result in higher costs without providing any additional form of optimisation. Beyond 1.5 indicates that the system may experience a greater pressure drop and as mentioned may result in clogging, seeping of waste flow and reduced filtration rate.As a guideline it is recommended that the smallest particles used within <b>depth</b> <b>filters</b> should be placed at least 150 mm from the outlet stream to prevent fluidisation.|$|E

INTRODUCTlON Consumer-oriented 3 D graphics hardware rapidly incorporates algorithms that increase flexibility and quality of per-pixel color processing; a recent example is a pixel shader [I]. However, determination if a pixel is visible and needs to be processed by a shader still relies on the screen Z buffer algorithm [2]. If the scene is more and more complex, depth buffer test also becomes a burden to the rendering engine. Consider, for example, an interactive walk-through of a detailed geometric database describing an entire city, complete with vegetation, buildings, Furniture inside the buildings and the contents of the furniture. Traditional visibility test which runs on current graphics hardware, the screen 2 buffer algorithm, is not capable of rendering very complex images at interactive rates because of the shortage of memory bandwidth. The vast memory bandwidth is used in the 2 buffer algorithm because every pixel requests the depth value stored in the depth buffer and the depth of every pixels survived in the depth test must be updated to the depth buffer...|$|R

40|$|The {{clarification}} of biological feed stocks during {{the production of}} biopharmaceutical proteins is challenging when large quantities of particles must be removed, e. g. when processing crude plant extracts. Single-use <b>depth</b> <b>filters</b> are often preferred for clarification because they are simple to integrate {{and have a good}} safety profile. However, the combination of filter layers must be optimized in terms of nominal retention ratings to account for the unique particle size distribution in each feed stock. We have recently shown that predictive models can facilitate filter screening and the selection of appropriate filter layers. Here we expand our previous study by testing several filters with different retention ratings. The filters typically contain diatomite to facilitate the removal of fine particles. However, diatomite can interfere with the recovery of large biopharmaceutical molecules such as virus-like particles and aggregated proteins. Therefore, we also tested filtration devices composed solely of cellulose fibers and cohesive resin. The capacities of both filter types varied from 10 to 50 L m- 2 when challenged with tobacco leaf extracts, but the filtrate turbidity was ~ 500 -fold lower (~ 3. 5 NTU) when diatomite filters were used. We also tested pre coat filtration with dispersed diatomite, which achieved capacities of up to 120 L m- 2 with turbidities of ~ 100 NTU using bulk plant extracts, and in contrast to the other <b>depth</b> <b>filters</b> did not require an upstream bag filter. Single pre-coat filtration devices can thus replace combinations of bag and <b>depth</b> <b>filters</b> to simplify the processing of plant extracts, potentially saving on time, labor and consumables. The protein concentrations of TSP, DsRed and antibody 2 G 12 were not affected by pre-coat filtration, indicating its general applicability during the manufacture of plant-derived biopharmaceutical proteins...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{research}} was defined by a poorly characterised filtration train employed to clarify culture broth containing monoclonal antibodies secreted by GS-NSO cells: the filtration train blinded unpredictably and the ability of the positively charged filters to adsorb DNA from process material was unknown. To direct the development of an assay to quantify the ability of <b>depth</b> <b>filters</b> to adsorb DNA, the molecular weight of DNA from a large-scale, fed-batch, mammalian cell culture vessel was evaluated as process material passed through the initial stages of the purification scheme. High molecular weight DNA was substantially cleared from the broth after passage through a disc stack centrifuge and the remaining low molecular weight DNA was largely unaffected by passage through a series of <b>depth</b> <b>filters</b> and a sterilising grade membrane. Removal of high molecular weight DNA was shown to be coupled with clarification of the process stream. The DNA from cell culture supernatant showed a pattern of internucleosomal cleavage of chromatin when fractionated by electrophoresis but the presence of both necrotic and apoptotic cells throughout the fermentation meant that the origin of the fragmented DNA could not be unequivocally determined. An intercalating fluorochrome, PicoGreen, was elected for development of a suitable DNA assay because of its ability to respond to low molecular weight DNA. It was assessed for its ability to determine the concentration of DNA in clarified mammalian cell culture broths containing pertinent monoclonal antibodies. Fluorescent signal suppression was ameliorated by sample dilution or by performing the assay above the pI of secreted IgG. The source of fluorescence in clarified culture broth was validated by incubation with RNase A and DNase I. At least 89. 0 % of fluorescence was attributable to nucleic acid and pre-digestion with RNase A was shown to be a requirement for successful quantification of DNA in such samples. Application of the fluorescence based assay resulted in characterisation of the physical parameters governing adsorption of DNA by various positively charged <b>depth</b> <b>filters</b> and membranes in test solutions and the DNA adsorption profile of the manufacturing scale filtration train. Buffers that reduced or neutralised the depth filter or membrane charge, and those that impeded hydrophobic interactions were shown to affect their operational capacity, demonstrating that DNA was adsorbed by a combination of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. Production-scale centrifugation of harvest broth containing therapeutic protein resulted in the reduction of total DNA in the process stream from 79. 8 μg m 1 - 1 to 9. 3 μg m 1 - 1 whereas the concentration of DNA in the supernatant of pre-and post-filtration samples had only marginally reduced DNA content: from 6. 3 to 6. 0 μg m 1 - 1 respectively. Hence the filtration train was shown to ineffective in DNA removal. Historically, blinding of the <b>depth</b> <b>filters</b> had been unpredictable with data such as numbers of viable cells, non-viable cells, product titre, or process shape (batch, fed-batch, or draw and fill) failing to inform on the durability of <b>depth</b> <b>filters</b> in the harvest step. To investigate this, key fouling contaminants were identified by challenging <b>depth</b> <b>filters</b> with the same mass of one of the following: viable healthy cells, cells that had died by the process of apoptosis, and cells that had died through the process of necrosis. The pressure increase across a Cuno Zeta Plus 10 SP depth filter was 2. 8 and 16. 5 times more sensitive to debris from apoptotic and necrotic cells respectively, when compared to viable cells. The condition of DNA released into the culture broth was assessed. Necrotic cells released predominantly high molecular weight DNA in contrast to apoptotic cells which released chiefly low molecular weight DNA. The blinding of the filters was found to be largely unaffected by variations in the particle size distribution of material in, and viscosity of, solutions with which they were challenged. The exceptional response of the <b>depth</b> <b>filters</b> to necrotic cells may suggest the cause of previously noted unpredictable filter blinding whereby a number of necrotic cells have a more significant impact on the life of a depth filter than a similar number of viable or apoptotic cells. In a final set of experiments the pressure drop caused by non-viable necrotic culture broths which had been treated with DNase I or benzonase was found to be smaller when compared to untreated broths: the abilities of the enzyme treated cultures to foul the depth filter were reduced by 70. 4 % and 75. 4 % respectively indicating the importance of DNA in the blinding of the depth filter studied...|$|E
