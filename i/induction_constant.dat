The immediate utilization of hydrocarbons by hydrocarbon-deprived organisms helps to establish the nutritional value of nonpolar substrates in the environment. The observation of small Michaelis constants for toluene transport led to tests of metabolic competition between hydrocarbons; however, competitive inhibition of toluene metabolism was not found for benzene, naphthalene, xylene, dodecane, or amino acids. Benzene and terpenes were inhibitory at milligram liter− 1 concentrations. Toluene was metabolized by a strongly inducible system when compared with benzene.

40|$|Antibiotic-bacterium {{interactions}} are complex in nature. In many cases, bacterial killing does not commence {{immediately after the}} addition of an antibiotic, and a lag period is observed. Antibiotic permeation and/or the intermediate steps that exist between antibiotic-receptor binding and expression of cell death are two major possible causes for such lag period. This study was primarily designed to determine the relationship, if any, between antibiotic concentrations and the lag periods by a modeling approach. Short-term time-kill studies were conducted for amoxicillin, ampicillin, penicillin-G, oxacillin, and dicloxacillin against Escherichia coli. In conjunction {{with the use of}} a saturable rate model to describe the concentration-dependent killing process, a first-order <b>induction</b> (initiation) rate <b>constant</b> was used to characterize the delay in bacterial killing during the lag period. For all of the beta-lactams tested, parameters describing the bactericidal effect suggest that amoxicillin and ampicillin were much more potent than oxacillin and dicloxacillin. The <b>induction</b> rate <b>constant</b> estimates for both ampicillin and amoxicillin were found to relate linearly to concentrations. Nevertheless, these <b>induction</b> rate <b>constant</b> estimates were lower for penicillin-G, oxacillin, and dicloxacillin and increased nonlinearly with concentrations until an apparent plateau was observed. These findings support the hypothesis that the permeation process is potentially a rate-limiting step for the rapid bactericidal beta-lactams such as ampicillin and amoxicillin. However, as suggested by previous observations of the various morphological changes induced by beta-lactams, the contribution of the steps following antibiotic-receptor complex formation to the lag period might be significant for the less bactericidal antibiotics such as oxacillin and dicloxacillin. Findings from the present modeling approach can potentially be used to guide future bench experimentation...|$|R

The study was conducted in an honors language arts classroom in the Southwestern region of the United States. Methods for data collection included twenty semi-structured interviews, observational fieldnotes, transcripts of audiotaped and videotaped literature circle discussions, journal entries, a humor survey and other miscellaneous written artifacts. Data were collected for seven months. Instructional materials included a variety of young adult novels and short stories representing historical fiction and contemporary realistic fiction genres. Analytic <b>induction,</b> <b>constant</b> comparison, organizational charts, and various forms of member checking were used to analyze the data. The results of the study indicate that the students used humor to construct meaning while reading. Specifically, students visualized action humor in the texts enhancing their comprehension. Discussions referencing experiential and textual connections were commonplace. Some students found humor in the use of archaic language or the use of dialects different from their own. The students read the adolescent literature both efferently and aesthetically (Rosenblatt, 1995) as they attended to humor setting conditions for engaging the humor. First, if the humor was the result of superiority humor where the focus group members could predict the targeted character would be hurt, disappointed or promote a negative change in the character's development, then they would not engage in the humor. Second, if the humor was closely related to their world of understanding, then the humor was embraced only after careful deliberation.

Embedded in the theoretical perspectives of phenomenology and symbolic interactionism, qualitative cross-case methodology was employed to investigate the following questions: in what ways do these students indicate their intellectual abilities, and what instructional strategies or techniques are especially beneficial in developing these abilities?^ Two participants were located who met the selection criteria. One student was placed in a self-contained gifted program at the elementary level; the other was enrolled in regular and college preparatory classes at a comprehensive high school. Data collection occurred over a three-year time span, and employed these research methods: participant observation, interviewing, document analysis, audiotaping, and videotaping. Data were analyzed using analytic <b>induction,</b> <b>constant</b> comparison, open coding, axial coding, selective coding, diagramming, and cross-case analysis. ^ The students demonstrated the following characteristics of giftedness: advanced academic abilities (especially mathematical and verbal skills), broad base of knowledge, quickness of learning and recall, sophisticated sense of humor, curiosity, insight, maturity (shown through motivation, goal orientation, determination, patience, and recognition of one 2 ̆ 7 s own limitations), desire for independence, and use of intellectual skills to cope with the disability. Instructional variables conducive to the development of these skills included willingness of the teachers to accommodate, mainstreaming with nondisabled students, individualization and opportunities for student choice, hands-on experiences, development of thinking skills, simulation, thematic instruction, and high-level discussion. ^ Four assertions emerged from the cross-case analysis. In brief, these related to the difficulty in expressing and recognizing indicators of giftedness; differential impact of classroom atmosphere, structure, and instructional activities; integration into regular classrooms; and barriers which must be overcome in order for these students to meet their goals. In addition, strong themes of conflict and interference emerged. ^ Theoretical implications were drawn between the results and the frameworks of phenomenology and symbolic interactionism, and the information-processing model of intelligence.

Pharmacokinetic assessment followed by model fitting. Patients: The analysis included 32 patients aged between 1 and 18 years receiving a total of 45 courses of ifosfamide 1. 2, 2 or 3 g/m 2 in 1 or 3 hours on 1, 2 or 3 days. A total of 133 blood samples (median of 3 per patient) were collected. Plasma concentrations of ifosfamide and its dechloroethylated metabolites were determined by gas chromatography. Plasma concentrations of 4 -hydroxy-ifosfamide were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. The models were fitted to the data using a nonlinear mixed effects model as implemented in the NONMEM program. A cross-validation was performed.

40|$|Pseudomonas putida metabolises {{aromatic}} carboxylic acids by convergent pathways. The regulons for {{the synthesis}} of the enzymes involved are controlled by induction and repression by intermediates of the pathways. The results of previous studies in this system suggest that the organism should exhibit a selective enzymic response to mixed aromatic substrates. It has been {{the aim of this}} study to predict the enzymic response to mixtures of mandelate, benzoate and parahydroxybenzoate and then to check these predictions experimentally. The affinities of these three inducer substrates for their regulons have been determined by measuring the initial rates of enzyme synthesis over a range of inducer concentrations in cultures growing on glucose. Glucose itself was shown to have very little catabolite repressor effect in this system. From the results, an <b>induction</b> <b>constant,</b> defined as the inducer concentration for half-maximum rate of induction, was estimated for each substrate. Those for the benzoate and mandelate regulons were similar (c. 0. 5 mM) and much higher than that for parahydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (andlt; 0. 01 mM). By measuring the repressor effect or each aromatic substrate on the induction by one of the other substrates, repression constants (K rep) were also obtained that are a quantitative measure of the affinity of the repressor for that regulon. Mandelate had no repressor activity and the benzoate regulon was not repressed by parahydroxybenzoate. The mandelate regulon was severely repressed by p-OH benzoate (K rep = 0. 02 mM) while the effect of benzoate on the parahydroxybenzoate regulon was much less pronounced (K rep = 1. 0 mM). Benzoate had a transient,severe effect on the mandelate regulon and, at high concentrations, a moderate permanent form of repression was observed. The enzymic reponse of the organism following a changeover from growth on a single aromatic carbon source to growth in the presence of an additional aromatic carbon source was predicted by comparing the induction and repression constants for the substrates concerned. Batch cultures were used to provide an indication of the steady state enzymic reponse, which was obtained using a nitrogen-limited chemostat operated at high growth rates. In general, the predictions were experimentally validated. Benzoate oxidase was always fully induced in mixtures containing benzoate, while the mandelate enzymes were almost completely repressed in the presence of parahydroxybenzoate. The mandelate regulon was only partially induced in mixtures containing mandelate and benzoate as was the parahydroxybenzoate regulon in cells grown on parahydroxybenzoate and benzoate. The extent to which the enzymes for the less preferred carbon source were induced was affected by the relative concentrations of the substrates. The results indicate that comparison of induction and repression constants can be used to predict the enzymic behaviour of this organism towards mixed aromatic substrates and it is suggested that this may form the basis of a general method for predicting enzymic adaptation to mixed substrates. Relative substrate utilisation can only be inferred from the induction and repression constants if complete repression of an enzyme system is predicted. Further data are necessary whenever the predictions indicate that more than one enzyme system will be induced. Thus, in this study, it was predicted, and experimentally verified in the chemostat, that mandelate would not be used by cells growing in the presence of mandelate + p-OH benzoate. When induction of two enzyme systems we predicted, the relative utilisation of the substrates was qualitatively related to the enzymic content of the cells. In contrast to other systems where the reaction to mixed substrates seems to be directed towards the selection of the substrate capable of supporting the fastest growth rate, Pseudomonas putida selects, not the best growth substrate (mandelate), but the substrate requiring {{the synthesis of}} fewer enzymes for its metabolism (benzoate). Factors in the environment acting as possible selective agents are discussed. In the course of this study, it was also found that the synthesis of the mandelate enzymes wan delayed when low external inducer concentrations were used. At high concentrations, enzyme synthesis rapidly followed the addition of inducer. A pre-induction or maintenance effect was also observed in which cells induced at saturating concentrations of mandelate were able to maintain a maximum rate of induction when transferred to sub-saturating inducer concentrations. Induced cells were able to accumulate mandelate from low external concentrations. These results are discussed in terms of an inducible mandelate transport system. The severe transient repression of the mandelate regulon by benzoate was greatly reduced by pre-induction with mandelate. Benzoate inhibited the accumulation of mandelate by the cells and the action of benzoate on the mandelate regulon is discussed in relation to the possible induction mechanisms of the mandelate regulon. </p...|$|E

The proposed system provides mechanical characteristics with constant maximum torque or increased maximum torque and reduced slip speed at frequencies below the nominal frequency. The control algorithm {{is based on}} the constant volts per hertz principle using two improvement techniques: keeping maximum torque constant or keeping magnetic flux constant. Performance analysis of the system under different operation conditions was provided. For this purpose, a standard state-space model of three-phase squirrel-cage induction motor, with respect to a synchronously rotating d-q reference frame was derived. The correctness and validity of the derived model of induction motor was verified. The inverter was considered as a static linear element and modeled through its input-output equation based on the modulation index. Three types of controllers were modeled, simulated and experimentally tested. The results show that both suggested control methods improve the system performance.

The primary mechanism responsible for the increase of the α-CGTase production was due to the increase of the membrane permeability. This is the first report describing a two-stage temperature control strategy used for increasing the extracellular α-CGTase production in E. coli.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Energy in the Wind is {{converted}} into Rotary Mechanical Energy by the Wind turbine. Most of the Wind Electric Generators are having Induction Motor, (Asynchronous Motor) with constant speed and drawing more Reactive Power from the Grid, during starting / low wind period. This thesis {{emphasized the need}} of replacing the existing conventional Asynchronous <b>Induction</b> motor of <b>Constant</b> Speed by Wound Rotor Synchronous Induction motor of variable speed, namely, Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG). The control principle is either the Direct Torque Control (DTC) method, Or, Two – axis Current Vector Control Method. The Direct Torque Control Method {{is more effective than}} the two axis current vector control method, for Reactive Power Management for Wind Electric Generator. The minimum usage of only about 30 % of Power Electronics results in considerable cost savings and reduction of harmonics when compared with Fully Converter Wind Electric Generators...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to control the speed of an induction motor by using seven level diode clamped multilevel inverter and improve the high quality sinusoidal output voltage with reduced harmonics. The presented scheme for diode clamped multilevel inverter is sine carrier Pulse Width Modulation control. An open loop speed control can be achieved by using V/ƒ method. This method can be implemented by changing the supply voltage and frequency applied to the three phase <b>induction</b> motor at <b>constant</b> ratio. The presented system is an effective replacement for the conventional method which has high switching losses, its result ends in a poor drive performance. The simulation result portrays the effective control in the motor speed and an enhanced drive performance through reduction in total harmonic distortion (THD). The effectiveness of the system is verified through simulation using PSIM 6. 1 Simulink package...|$|R
40|$|Photosynthetic <b>induction</b> under <b>constant</b> and {{fluctuating}} {{light conditions}} {{was investigated in}} intact leaves of Alocasia macrorrhiza and Toona australis, two species native to Australian rainforests. When leaves were exposed to saturating light following a long period at low light intensity, an induction period of 25 - 40 min was required before steady-state photosynthesis was achieved. A long induction period was required regardless of plant growth conditions (high vs. low light) and ambient CO 2 concentrations during mesurement. In low-light grown A. macrorrhiza, the initial slope {{of the relationship between}} assimilation and internal CO 2 pressure increased 7 -fold from 30 s following illumination {{to the end of the}} induction period. Both stomatal and carboxylation limitations play a role in photosynthetic induction, but carboxylation limitations predominate during the first 6 - 10 min. In both species, leaf induction state increased 2 to 3 -fold during a sequence of five 30 -or 60 -s lightflecks separated by 2 min of low light. Rates of induction during 60 -s lightflecks and during constant illumination were similar. Induction loss in low-light grown leaves of Alocasia macrorrhiza required more than 60 min of continuous exposure to low light conditions. These results suggest that, under forest understory conditions, leaves are at intermediate induction states for most of the day. The ability to utilize sunflecks may therefore be strongly influenced by the ability of leaves to maintain relatively high states of induction during long periods of low light. © 1986 Springer-Verlag...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{introduces}} {{the speed and}} power control a slip energy recovery drive using voltage-source PWM converter with current-controlled technique. The slip energy occurred in the rotor circuit is transferred back to ac mains supply through a reactor and a step up transformer. The objective of the current-controlled technique is to increase power factor {{of the system and}} to reduce low order harmonics of the input line current. The drive system is designed and implemented using a voltage source inverter in conjunction with a boost chopper for DC link voltage, instead of a conventional drive using a 6 pulse converter or a Scherbius system. The slip power is recovered by the help of a voltage source inverter (VSI) based on a current-controlled technique. In order to keep the speed of the wound rotor <b>induction</b> motor <b>constant</b> over a certain range of operating conditions, the servo state feedback controller designed by a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) is also introduced and the PI controller designed by pole placement method is also introduced in control the slip power this paper. The overall control system is implemented on DSP, oller board. A 1 kW wound motor is employed for testing. It is found that the motor speed can be controlled to be constant in the operating range of 600 - 1200 rpm at no load and full load. It is also found that the harmonics of the input ac line current is reduced while the ac line input power factor is increased...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper will}} present the results of {{research}} conducted for a doctoral dissertation. The purpose of the research {{was to investigate the}} experience of college students engaged in the occupations associated with a major in theater, specifically in relation to the development of self-concept. A qualitative, interpretive case study method was used to gather and analyze the meaning of the experiences of four students majoring in theater at a comprehensive university. A series of interviews was conducted with each participant and multiple observations yielded ethnographic data regarding salient features of the context. Data analysis was carried out via analytic <b>induction</b> and <b>constant</b> comparative analysis. Key ideas that emerged were collapsed to derive primary themes within and across cases. Data analysis revealed aspects of engagement in theater occupations that were described by participants as meaningful in terms of developing self-concept. Specifically, it was noted that elements of play production, as well as aspects of the associated academic coursework, contributed to a context that participants described as conducive to self-concept development. Accordingly, participants noted that self-reflection and introspection were key aspects of character development and that engagement in these activities influenced self-concept development. Furthermore, experiences related to auditioning, typecasting, and aspects of play production were described as meaningful and relevant to self-concept development by the participant group. Thus, the results of this research supported the notion that engagement in the occupations associated with an undergraduate theater major influenced self-concept development among this sample group. In this presentation, results will be described in terms of the relation between occupational engagement and identity development, including discussion of the implications for academic contexts...|$|R
