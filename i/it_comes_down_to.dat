5|$|A paper {{airplane}} {{contest is}} being hosted at Dunder Mifflin {{by a new}} paper supplier. All of the office workers compete against {{each other for a}} $2,000 prize. Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) in particular is fiercely competitive, and even as she realizes that she is showing an ugly side of herself to her boyfriend Pete Miller (Jake Lacy), she cannot hold back from smashing a box of packing peanuts when she loses in the semi-finals. After several intense rounds, <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey). Dwight, who is dating Esther (Nora Kirkpatrick), tries to throw the contest. Angela is flattered by the gesture. However, when Esther expresses her condolences to Angela about her financial situation since her husband separated from her, she realizes that Dwight is letting her win out of pity, not love. Angered, she rebuffs Dwight's pity and lets him win the contest.|$|E

A tactic known as speed counting {{plays an important}} role in the endgame. By counting the number of moves until checkmate (assuming the opponent doesn't get to move) for both Black and White, this will help to influence decisions on whether to attack or defend. A simple mistake can change the flow of the game drastically. Among this, there are many other delicate factors to look out for within the endgame, including sacrificial attacks and traps.|$|E

In 2008, he ended speculation about his allegiance when he said, [...] "Here's the deal: {{my father was}} born in Everton, my family are officially Evertonians, so if <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> a derby match or an FA Cup final between the two, I would have to support Everton. But after a concert at Wembley Arena I got {{a bit of a}} friendship with Kenny Dalglish, who had been to the gig and I thought 'You know what?

500|$|Keith DeCandido, in {{a review}} of [...] "Q-Less" [...] for Tor.com, praised the {{relationship}} between Vash and Quark and thought that it should have been explored further. Like Handlen, DeCandido also felt that Q did not quite fit in DS9, but acknowledged that his performance in this episode was an improvement over his later appearances in [...] DeCandido described the boxing scene where Sisko punches Q as [...] "wonderful" [...] and [...] "spectacular". However, he thought that aspects of the plot had too much technobabble; for example, the embryo plotline could have been resolved by a form of Customs procedure. [...] "Ultimately", DeCandido concludes, [...] "none of this matters, because <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> one great moment of Sisko decking Q. Bliss." ...|$|E
500|$|Carlsen had an {{aggressive}} {{style of play}} as a youth, and, according to Agdestein, his play was characterised by [...] "a fearless readiness to offer material for activity". Carlsen found as he matured that this risky playing style was not as well suited against the world elite. When he started playing in top tournaments, he had trouble getting much out of the opening. To progress, Carlsen's style became more universal, capable of handling all sorts of positions well. He opens with both 1.d4 and 1.e4, as well as 1.c4, and, on occasion, 1.Nf3, thus {{making it harder for}} opponents to prepare against him and reducing the effect of computer analysis. He has said the middlegame is his favourite part of the game as <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> [...] "pure chess".|$|E

500|$|Karina Longworth notes how [...] "external" [...] Streep's {{performances}} are, [...] "chameleonic" [...] in her impersonation of characters, [...] "subsuming {{herself into}} them, rather than personifying them". In her early roles such as Manhattan and Kramer vs. Kramer, she {{was compared to}} both Diane Keaton and Jill Clayburgh, in that her characters were unsympathetic, which Streep has attributed to the tendency to be drawn to playing women who are difficult to like and lack empathy. Streep has stated that many consider {{her to be a}} technical actor, but she professed that <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> her love of reading the initial script, adding, [...] "I come ready and I don't want to screw around and waste the first 10 takes on adjusting lighting and everybody else getting comfortable".|$|E
500|$|Lovato's fifth album, Confident, was {{released}} on October 16, 2015, and received generally positive reviews from music critics. The album debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 98,000 copies. During the album's production, Lovato commented: [...] "I've already started recording for my new album, and I have plans to record during the tour. The sound just evolves into everything that I've been and everything that I want to become." [...] She further stated, [...] "I've never been so sure of myself as an artist when <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> confidence, but not only personal things, but exactly what I want my sound to be and what I know I'm capable of and this album will give {{me the opportunity to}} show people what I can really do." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The hope, {{first and}} foremost, {{was to put}} this on people’s radar. Apart from the UN and a few newsreaders who mention this every year, people don’t even know this day exists. It’s also to make people realize it’s not just about {{volunteering}} to go {{and live in the}} Congo for four years. It’s as much about working a soup kitchen as it is helping an elderly person. Contributing something positive doesn’t have to be a lifelong commitment; it can just be daily gestures. So, it was about giving the whole issue perspective... One video and a message aren't going to save everything. But when you say things together, maybe the message will be heard and hopefully will provoke action. Inherently people are good, and inherently people are distracted and somewhat lazy, so <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> how do you get people’s attention." ...|$|E

500|$|Like the band's earlier releases, {{the album}} {{features}} {{a variety of}} guitar configurations as well as electronic synths. Erikson said that initially they gather with the standard guitar-bass-drum and keyboard gear, and as they pass around different ideas and implement them the songs take form in any which way a session takes them. [...] "Once we started on the album proper, it became a Garbage record, which is any number of approaches to writing a recording. There were no rules, certainly", he explained. A song like [...] "Automatic Systematic Habit" [...] features more electronics than guitars, and [...] "Big Bright World", a guitar-heavy song, involves configurations that make some of the guitars sound like synths. Guitar parts are normally divvied between guitarists Marker and Erikson. Erikson said <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> [...] "Whoever comes up with what at any given time. There's no job description as far as lead guitar/rhythm guitar. It's just whoever has an idea as a articular [...] moment. It's usually about 50/50". Erikson and Marker {{used a variety of}} guitars and pedals, old, new, and defective.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, Backspacer {{displays}} {{a more positive}} outlook than the band's last few albums. Vedder credited the election of President Barack Obama as inspiration for the optimistic lyrics. Regarding the lyrics, Vedder said, [...] "I've tried, over the years, to be hopeful in the lyrics, and I think that's going to be easier now." [...] Gossard stated, [...] "We've {{made a couple of}} political and pointed records, the last two in particular, and just to move away from that is great, because it allows you {{to go back to that}} when you need to and it refreshes everybody, and <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> a beat and a melody and your friends and a lyric and a poem and something that's important to you." [...] Vedder stated he did not spend [...] "more than half hour" [...] writing the lyrics to each song: [...] "If it’s not gonna happen quick then I don’t wanna do it, because it means there’s another one out there that is gonna happen quick, and is gonna hit you like a lightning bolt." ...|$|E
500|$|The Two Towers {{received}} critical acclaim; film site aggregator Rotten Tomatoes {{reported that}} 96 percent of critics were positive. CNN film critic Paul Clinton called The Two Towers an [...] "utter triumph", and writer Philip French of The Guardian {{noted in a}} review of the second film that [...] "these Tolkien films have a weight and seriousness that very few sword-and-sorcery pictures of the past 30-odd years have attained." [...] Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Owen Gleiberman remarked [...] "The Two Towers conjures an illusion of the gravity that you want from an emotionally charged storybook epic. Really, though, what <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> is superbly staged battle scenes and moral alliances forged in earnest yet purged of the wit and dynamic, bristly ego that define true on-screen personality." [...] The film was also listed on a number of critics' lists; Dallas-Fort Worth Film Critics named The Two Towers 2002's third best film, while Central Ohio Film Critics named The Two Towers that year's fifth best film and Southeastern Film Critics ranked it the eighth.|$|E

50|$|For the decade, two of {{the most}} popular and most talented players in the league doubled as the {{franchise}} players of Ginebra and Purefoods, just like in the playing years of Jaworski and Patrimonio. So notable is the parallelism that after a playoff game wherein Yap made the winning basket, Coach Tim Cone of San Mig Super Coffee remarked, “In the old days <b>it</b> would’ve <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> Alvin Patrimonio making a big post move. But nowadays James hits a big shot... Well, I guess, Manila Clasico, <b>it</b> should <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the last possession. And it did today. <b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> a James Yap three-point shot.” For San Mig Coffee Team Governor Rene Pardo, Yap is the face of the PBA, representing what Jaworski was to the pro league in the seventies and eighties, and Patrimonio in the nineties.|$|R
500|$|Motolla {{selected}} Cory Rooney as {{the executive}} producer of Irresistible. Most of the recording and mixing works were done at Sony Music Studios, New York City and was completed over a time span of eight months. Rooney also coordinated the recording process while Robert Williams miked the vocals. Sony's C-800G Tube Condenser Microphone, equipped with a dual large diaphragm and electronically selectable pick-up pattern, was used to record the vocals. In an interview with Sony's SoundByte magazine in 2002, Williams said of his choice: [...] "In the studio, <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> what you hear. [...] She has such a big range, from a whisper to really belting it out, and you need a microphone that can handle the range without distortion." [...] He had used the microphone for Simpson's first album and felt that it suited her well. He also noted that on ballads, [...] "the S's and wet sounds of lips" [...] are important to the texture of the song. According to him, as Simpson's vocals tended to be [...] "bright", he edited the lower ends of her voice to equalize the track.|$|E
500|$|On August 9, 1983, ABC {{announced}} that Jennings {{had signed a}} four-year contract with the network and would become the sole anchor and senior editor for World News Tonight on September 5. Jennings would anchor the program from New York City, the program's new base of operations. The announcement signaled a generational shift in the evening news broadcasts, {{and the beginning of}} what the media would deem the [...] "Big Three" [...] era of Jennings, Dan Rather of CBS, and Tom Brokaw of NBC. Rather had already been elevated to anchor in 1981 after the retirement of Walter Cronkite, and Brokaw of NBC Nightly News was set to become sole anchor the same day as Jennings. At the time, Jennings expressed apprehension that the impending competition among the three newsmen was at risk of becoming superficial. [...] "With me, Brokaw and Rather, I recognize that there will be the factor of three pretty faces," [...] he said. [...] "That's an inevitable byproduct of television. But if that is what <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> in terms of the approach we take, if our approach is that singular, then we will all have made a mistake." ...|$|E
500|$|Immediately the two {{incidents}} raised {{rumors of}} a possible Blink-182 reunion. Hoppus was alerted about Barker's accident by a phone call {{in the middle of}} the night and jumped on the next flight to the burn center. DeLonge learned of the crash via the TV news at an airport while waiting to board a flight. He landed and mailed a letter and two photographs to Barker: a photo of Blink aboard a submarine in the Middle East and another of himself and his two kids. [...] "One was 'Do you remember who we were?' and the other was 'This is who I am now,' [...] " [...] DeLonge said DeLonge also commented that, no matter what happened between himself and Barker in the past, [...] "none of it matters when <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> somebody getting hurt." [...] Hoppus first spoke on the matter in a blog post in November 2008, writing that he [...] "hadn't had it in him" [...] to post, adding that [...] "these past two months have been the hardest times I can remember." [...] He also revealed that he, DeLonge, and Barker had all spoken in the aftermath. Barker quashed reunion rumors in December, but noted that they had been getting along.|$|E

500|$|Over {{the course}} of Glee second season, Lauren forms a {{relationship}} with local bad boy and football star Noah Puckerman. As the season progresses, Lauren and Puck's relationship continues to grow stronger. Their relationship begins to form in the ninth episode of the second season titled [...] "Special Education". After Puck attempts to recruit new members for the William McKinley High School glee club, members of the football team lock him in a port-a-potty. After being discovered by Lauren, he convinces her to join New Directions, despite her belief that show choir is stupid. Ashley Fink said of their relationship: [...] "I think Ryan Murphy has a master plan and we're all kind of along for the ride. I know what you mean, but I wouldn't count us out just yet on that front. We all have to laugh at ourselves but it's going somewhere. Ultimately, <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> whether audiences will buy a relationship between Puck and Lauren. I think there's a really hilarious chemistry between Puck and Lauren. I think he's a badass, she's a badass. I don't know, I think they're funny together. There's something about {{the two of them}} together that I like, so I hope it's not outside the realm of possibility." ...|$|E
500|$|Most of {{the lyrics}} were written by Manson as she {{included}} and filtered some of her bandmates' ideas on songwriting. [...] "It was a very do-it-yourself, homemade thing when <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> it", Erikson explained; [...] "We all pitch in. Shirley had just as many comments on the guitar parts or {{the sound of the}} guitars as anybody else, and likewise, if we don't like a lyric, we say it right away." [...] Many songs have a more optimistic view in life, inspired by Manson overcoming a desire to quit music after the death of her mother and realizing how important her work is to her. Darker themes still appear as Manson described herself as [...] "enthusiastic and passionate, but I do see death marching toward me." [...] "Blood for Poppies" [...] came [...] "from a lot of things", Manson said; [...] "It's really an analogy for a story I read about Afghanistan and the opium wars over there ... it's from a few stories, one about a platoon of soldiers in Afghanistan and the other about the opium wars. I use that as a backdrop for a story about maintaining sanity in an out-of-control place." [...] " [...] remaining sane, when faced with insanity", she added. [...] "I Hate Love" [...] criticized [...] "the commercialized idea of love and what pain that puts us through" [...] along with [...] "knowing {{that there will be no}} more torture in your life than really, truly loving somebody who doesn't love you back." [...] Manson also incorporated some self-confidence and knowledge of her personality achieved during acting classes, in which she accepted that [...] "was never going to be the cheerleader or the beautiful, conventional girl who fits in everywhere." ...|$|E
