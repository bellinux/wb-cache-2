Ours, the {{scientists}} keep telling us, is a universe, which is disposable.

[...] Producer Brian Eno edited the jam down to the end length. Guitarist the Edge said, [...] "it started off as an exercise in playing together with a kind of mood and a place in mind. And it really, for me, it brought me there, it really did succeed as an experiment." [...] Lanois said: [...] "There's something that happens when U2 bash it out in the band room... and sometimes things get out of control, sonically, in a good way. Out of control in the sense that you don't know what it is anymore, it just takes on a life of its own, and it makes people do things." ...|$|E

2500|$|An {{additional}} cognitively-based {{model of}} substance abuse recovery has been offered by Aaron Beck, the father of cognitive therapy and championed in his 1993 book [...] Cognitive Therapy of Substance Abuse. This therapy rests upon the assumption addicted individuals possess core beliefs, often not accessible to immediate consciousness (unless the patient is also depressed). These core beliefs, such as [...] "I am undesirable," [...] activate a system of addictive beliefs that result in imagined anticipatory benefits of substance use and, consequentially, craving. Once craving has been activated, permissive beliefs ("I can handle getting high <b>just</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> more time") are facilitated. Once a permissive set of beliefs have been activated, then the individual will activate drug-seeking and drug-ingesting behaviors. The cognitive therapist's job is to uncover this underlying system of beliefs, analyze it with the patient, and thereby demonstrate its dysfunctionality. As with any cognitive-behavioral therapy, homework assignments and behavioral exercises serve to solidify what is learned and discussed during treatment.|$|E
