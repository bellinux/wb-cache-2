500|$|The {{top three}} {{finishers}} {{of all four}} classes appeared on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. Tréluyer was delighted with the victory, saying: [...] "What a race, It was a tough lights-to-flag job, just like at Silverstone, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>huge</b> fun and we’re already looking forward to Le Mans." [...] He further stated: [...] "We did it and I am very happy for the team {{because we had a}} really strong weekend and it feels great to win in this fashion." [...] Lotterer said of the result: [...] "It's no holds barred all the time and is very fun, especially at Spa-Francorchamps. It's for this type of race that we hit track." [...] Dumas, who finished in second alongside Lieb and Jani, stated he found driving in dry weather conditions difficult because he was not experienced participating in such conditions. Lieb said his battle with Tréluyer was [...] "great" [...] and said the contact between the two drivers was part of motor racing. Jani stated while he did not win the race he praised his car. Third-place co-finisher Webber said that his team had [...] "too many own goals" [...] and that they did not wanted to be [...] "gifted results" [...] if they were not performing at the highest level. Bernhard said that despite taking the stop-and-go penalty his team did not give up and gave it their best effort to stand on the podium.|$|E
500|$|While {{the final}} version of [...] "Part Two" [...] is quite enclosed, the initial script was {{considered}} epic, with production designer Jerry Wanek jokingly referring to it as a [...] "six-hour mini-series". In the original version, the giant devil's trap keeping demons away from the gateway to Hell was much more complex, with each point in the pentagram being a church housing a holy relic—such as a sliver from the True Cross. With the artifacts powering the devil's trap, Jake's role would have been to go to each church and destroy them, the hunters following after him to try to stop him. Jake would then eventually destroy the final relic during a fight with Sam, and Dean would race to the gateway to prevent Azazel from opening it while Jake and Sam are [...] "beating the crap out of each other". However, when director and executive producer Kim Manners received the script, he realized <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>huge,</b> and had the storyboard artist make five-and-a-half hours of storyboards for the episode to prove that it could not be filmed without going {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} over-budget. Production suggested that a large amount of money could be saved by not depicting the churches, which were major set pieces for the intended story. Kripke realized that instead of using churches, he could have the points of the pentagram be connected by railroad tracks. With tracks being made of iron, it fit perfectly with the series mythology because iron is a demon deterrent. Kripke found this aspect to be more Western, matching the tone of show. Rather than destroying the devil's trap as in the original script, Jake is instead sent by Azazel to open the gateway himself, and the major fight scene between Jake and Sam was then changed into a standoff between Jake and the hunters. Though the storyline had to be toned down, Kripke felt that this improved the overall episode by making it simpler.|$|E

2500|$|The Cirque d'Hiver, or Cirque Napoléon, {{was located}} about 100 meters {{further down the}} street. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>huge</b> and new, built in 1852 to hold 4000 spectators.

2500|$|In {{the late}} 16th century, the Arsenal's {{designers}} experimented with larger ships as platforms for heavy naval guns. The largest was the galleass, already {{used at the}} [...] Battle of Lepanto against the Ottoman Turks, and developed from the old merchanting [...] "great galley". <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>huge,</b> propelled by both sails and oars, with guns mounted on wheeled carriages along the sides in the modern fashion. It was slow and unwieldy in battle, however, and few were ever built. The galleon, also developed at the Arsenal, was an armed sailing ship, a slimmer version of the merchant [...] "round ship". It was useful in major naval battles, {{but not in the}} small bays and off the extensive lee shores of the Dalmatian coast.|$|E

2500|$|The work {{of record}} {{producer}} Phil Spector, who popularized the Wall of Sound, was a focal obsession for Wilson. In the 1960s, Wilson thought of Spector as [...] "the single most influential producer. He's timeless. He makes a milestone whenever {{he goes into}} the studio." [...] Brian later reflected: [...] "I was unable to really think as a producer up until the time where I really got familiar with Phil Spector's work. That was when I started to design the experience to be a record rather than just a song." [...] He explains: [...] "Before Spector, people recorded all the instruments separately. They got great piano, great guitar, and great bass. But he thought of the song as one giant instrument. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>huge.</b> Size was so important to him, how big everything sounded. And he had the best drums I ever heard." [...] In 1999, when asked if he was a religious man, Wilson responded: [...] "I believe in Phil Spector." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Birmingham Canal Navigations {{carried out}} a number of {{improvements}} in the 1850s. The Netherton Tunnel, running parallel to the Dudley Tunnel but further to the east, was begun on 31 December 1855, and completed on 20 August 1858. It was the last canal tunnel to be built in England, and compared to the Dudley Tunnel <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>huge,</b> being around [...] from side to side at water level, with a towpath on both sides. It was found necessary to build an invert through the tunnel, because of unstable ground caused by mining below its line, and large retaining walls were required at each end. As a result, the cost rose from £238,000 to £302,000, and a tunnel toll was charged to help recoup the cost. Gas lights provided illumination, which were later replaced by electric lighting. The short Two Locks Line was built to reduce the distance travelled by boats passing through the Lapal Tunnel and heading for the Stourbridge Canal. Brewins Tunnel, which had been built on the Lodge Farm Cut in 1838 was made into a cutting, and the Delph Flight of nine locks were rebuilt, the middle seven being replaced by six new locks. A loop to the south of the Netherton Tunnel at Bumble Hole was eliminated by making a new cut.|$|E
