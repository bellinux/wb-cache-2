40|$|The {{preschool}} {{period is}} characterised by intensive psychophysical and personal {{development of the}} child. To this end, {{the quality of the}} educational process needs to be high. Preschool teachers, who are directly involved <b>in</b> <b>this</b> process, can significantly contribute to the quality of time spent in kindergarten and to the educational process as well. However, their performance at work also depends on their personality traits. The thesis looks into teachers' personality and personality traits as {{some of the most important}} factors defining the quality of the kindergarten and its educational function. The empirical part of the thesis examines how much importance preschool teachers attribute to certain personality traits with respect to pedagogical work, how they identify their own traits, and whether their opinions about the importance of certain traits are similar to/different from their assessment of the visibility of their own personality traits. The research is based on the quantitative research method. The data was acquired through a questionnaire on personality traits of preschool teachers. The research among 181 preschool teachers indicates that they perceive kindness and responsibility as the most important personality traits contributing to good performance <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>profession.</b> <b>As</b> for their personal traits, they find that kindness and respect are most important. The results also pointed to statistically significant differences in 40 out of 45 personality traits between the assessment of the importance of different personality traits of preschool teachers and the assessment of the visibility of their own traits.

40|$|Truck driving {{can be a}} {{hazardous}} occupation. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2009 truck drivers experienced 16. 8 % of all transportation-related fatalities and 2. 04 % of the nonfatal injuries requiring days away from work, even though they only made up 1. 0 % of the U. S. workforce. Truck drivers spend long hours behind the wheel, working an average of 41. 5 hours per week. Therefore, a well-designed truck cab can make {{a significant difference in}} the working conditions for a truck driver. Truck cab design impacts comfort, but more importantly impacts the safety of truck drivers and other road users. For example, if the design of the truck cab is poorly fitted to the size and dimensions of the driver, the road may be less visible, driving controls may be more difficult to reach, and seatbelts may be less comfortable and less likely to be used - all of which increase the risk of injury to the driver and other road users. Truck manufacturers consider the body dimensions of truck drivers as they design truck cabs. However, until recently the most current body measurement data for truck drivers dated from the early 1980 s. The composition of the trucker workforce has changed dramatically in the past 30 years, with an increase in the diversity of ethnic groups and the percentage of women working <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>profession.</b> <b>As</b> the truck manufacturing industry moves forward to design the next generation of truck cabs, there is a pressing need for up-to-date information on the body dimensions of U.

40|$|Objectives: The study {{investigated}} whether nurses' different working schedules {{are associated with}} different levels of job-relatd strain, health symptoms and behavior. No reports have been accessible in the relevant literature on the possible association between shift work and job-related strain in nurses. Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted at a large university hospital in North-East Italy, involving 806 nurses working in selected departments. A multilevel logistic regression was applied to assess the association between work shift conditions and selected outcomes. Results: Night shifts were associated not only with higher odds of having a high Job Demand, but also with lower odds of having a high Decision Authority and consequently with a stronger likelihood of having higher levels of Job Strain (high Job Demand score≥ 38 and Low Decision Authority). The night shift was associated with various symptoms, particularly exhaustion (p = 0. 039) and gastric pain (p = 0. 020). Nurses' working schedules did not affect their job satisfaction scores. Conclusions: It has been confirmed that night shifts are {{a risk factor for}} nurses' health perception and working night shifts carries a considerable degree of strain. This is a condition that hospital nursing managements need to consider carefully to avoid burnout in nursing personnel and prevent <b>an</b> excessive turnover <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>profession,</b> which is <b>a</b> recurring problem for health care organizations...|$|R

40|$|We {{begin this}} chapter by {{reflecting}} upon a simple distinction. The notion of ‘profession’ {{may be used}} as a noun and/or as an adjective. In the former case, specific occupations are referred to as professions by virtue of the control they exercise over the performance of particular tasks, including the designation of who may legally undertake such work. Such occupational control (Johnson, 1972) may be direct, as when states pass laws or grant charters permitting occupational associations to determine the rules and regulations for undertaking professional practice or when states directly employ professionals to undertake these decisions on their behalf (Macdonald, 1995). Different researchers have explored (and emphasized) different aspects of what control entails. That is, how much control over what types of resources is required for an occupation to be considered and classified as <b>a</b> <b>profession?</b> For some, control pre-eminently involves an exclusive, socially recognized claim to serve a particular market (Larson, 1977; Macdonald, 1995; Wilensky, 1964). In other words, professionalization is a form of social closure (Weber, 1978 : 341 and passim), through which strict control of a labour market is exercised. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> case, <b>a</b> <b>profession</b> is <b>a</b> licence to practise while professionalization creates monopolies of service provision. Thus, market closure constitutes a significant part of what Larson (1977) refers to as the ‘professional project’, that is, the seeking out of social recognition and legitimation as <b>a</b> <b>profession.</b> Griffith Business School, Dept of Employment Relations and Human ResourcesNo Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|This chapter utilises {{snapshots}} {{to illuminate}} the connection that takes place inside the author’s classroom, to assist students to achieve their full potential. The classroom environment is based on teamwork and provides a structure which supports both teachers and students to create a micro community of ‘switched-on’ learners. The walls are proudly adorned with students’ work, informative charts, photographs and other significant memorabilia. The words Positive, Proactive, Prepared and Polite frame our social literacy and are modelled by us as coconnections; classes; groupsllaborative teachers and reinforced through self regulation and mutual respect. Leadership is promoted, encouraged, fostered and celebrated. The curriculum is delivered using what we call Motivational Pedagogy to engage and instil a love of learning in our preadolescent and adolescent students. A unit integrating device we have constructed generates a practical, real world context for inquiry, which can then be utilised to unveil learning throughout the term. The expectations’ bar is set high and supported by positive, constructive and honest feedback which builds student self confidence and esteem. The classroom is a vibrant, evolving environment and evidence will be presented on how this carefully constructed learning environment contributes {{to the creation of}} individual student identity, their sense of belonging and a feeling of holistic connectedness. For teachers seeking reward <b>in</b> their <b>profession,</b> <b>this</b> is <b>a</b> proven recipe for classroom success. ...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES—Gemstone cutters are {{potentially}} exposed to various carcinogenic and fibrogenic metals such as chromium, nickel, aluminium, and beryllium, {{as well as}} to lead. Increased beryllium concentrations had been reported in the air of workplaces of beryl cutters in Idar-Oberstein, Germany. The aim of the survey was to study the excretion of beryllium in cutters and grinders with occupational exposure to beryls—for example, aquamarines and emeralds—to examine the prevalence of beryllium sensitisation with the beryllium lymphocyte transformation test (BeLT), to examine the prevalence of lung disease induced by beryllium, to describe the internal load of the respective metals relative to work process, and to screen for genotoxic effects <b>in</b> <b>this</b> particular <b>profession.</b>  METHODS—In <b>a</b> cross sectional investigation, 57  out of 100  gemstone cutters working in 12  factories in Idar-Oberstein with occupational exposure to beryls underwent medical examinations, a chest radiograph, lung function testing (spirometry, airway resistance with the interrupter technique), and biological monitoring, including measurements of aluminium, chromium, and nickel in urine as well as lead in blood. Beryllium in urine was measured with a newly developed direct electrothermal atomic absorption spectroscopy technique with a measurement limit of 0. 06  µg/l. Also, cytogenetic tests (rates of micronuclei and sister chromatid exchange), and a BeLT were performed. Airborne concentrations of beryllium were measured in three factories. As no adequate local control group was available, the cutters were categorised into those with an exposure to beryls of > 4 hours/week (group A) and ⩽ 4 hours/week (group B).  RESULTS—Clinical, radiological, or spirometric abnormalities indicating pneumoconiosis were detected in none of the gemstone cutters. Metal concentrations in biological material were far below the respective biological limit values, and beryllium in urine was only measurable in subjects of group A.  Cytogenetic investigations showed normal values which were independent of the duration of beryllium exposure. In one subject, the BeLT was positive. Beryllium stimulation indices were significantly higher in subjects with detectable beryllium in the urine than in those with beryllium concentrations below the detection limit (p< 0. 05). In one factory, two out of four measurements of airborne beryllium concentrations were well above the German threshold limit value of 2  µg/m 3 (twofold and 10 -fold), and all gemstone cutters working <b>in</b> <b>this</b> factory had measurable beryllium concentrations in urine.  CONCLUSION—No adverse clinical health effects were found <b>in</b> <b>this</b> cross sectional investigation of gemstone cutters working with beryls. However, an improvement in workplace hygiene is recommended, accompanied by biological monitoring of beryllium in urine.    Keywords: gemstone cutter; beryllium in urine; lymphocyte transformation tes...|$|R
60|$|But, after all, is it {{fit that}} this dishonourable {{contention}} between {{the court and}} juries should subsist any longer? On what principle is it that a jury refuses to be directed by the court as to his competence? Whether a libel or no libel be a question of law or of fact may be doubted, but a question of jurisdiction and competence is certainly a question of law; on this the court ought undoubtedly to judge, and to judge solely and exclusively. If they judge wrong from excusable error, you ought to correct it, as to-day it is proposed, by an explanatory bill; or if by corruption, by bill of penalties declaratory, and by punishment. What does a juror say to a judge when he refuses his opinion upon a question of judicature? You are so corrupt, that I should consider myself a partaker of your crime, were I to be guided by your opinion; or you are so grossly ignorant, that I, fresh from my bounds, from my plough, my counter, or my loom, am fit to direct you <b>in</b> your <b>profession.</b> <b>This</b> is <b>an</b> unfitting, it is a dangerous, state of things. The spirit of any sort of men is not a fit rule for deciding on the bounds of their jurisdiction. First, because it is different in different men, and even different in the same at different times; and can never become the proper directing line of law; next, {{because it is not}} reason, but feeling; and when once it is irritated, it is not apt to confine itself within its proper limits. If it becomes, not difference in opinion upon law, but a trial of spirit between parties, our courts of law are no longer the temple of justice, but the amphitheatre for gladiators. No--God forbid! Juries ought to take their law from the bench only; but it is our business that they should hear nothing from the bench but what is agreeable to the principles of the Constitution. The jury are to hear the judge, the judge is to hear the law where it speaks plain; where it does not, he is to hear the legislature. As I do not think these opinions of the judges to be agreeable to those principles, I wish to take the only method in which they can or ought to be corrected, by bill.|$|R
