Considering that Fred was not at all coarse, that he rather looked down on the manners and speech of young men who had not been to the university, and that he had written stanzas as pastoral and unvoluptuous as his flute-playing, his attraction towards Bambridge and Horrock was an interesting fact which even the love of horse-flesh would not wholly account for without that mysterious influence of Naming which <b>determinates</b> so much of mortal choice. Under any other name than [...] "pleasure" [...] the society of Messieurs Bambridge and Horrock must certainly have been regarded as monotonous; and to arrive with them at Houndsley on a drizzling afternoon, to get down at the Red Lion in a street shaded with coal-dust, and dine in a room furnished with a dirt-enamelled map of the county, a bad portrait of an anonymous horse in a stable, His Majesty George the Fourth with legs and cravat, and various leaden spittoons, might have seemed a hard business, but for the sustaining power of nomenclature which determined that the pursuit of these things was [...] "gay." ...|$|E

The results of this experiment suggest that though the growth and development of lablab bean is influenced by growing environment, still it is possible to identify <b>determinate</b> growth habit within three to 11 weeks after seed sowing at any season. This can make early selection of <b>determinate</b> growth habit possible for variety development program...|$|R

50|$|The world {{comes to}} meet me as a multiplicity, a sum of {{separate}} details. As a human being, I am myself one of these details, an entity among other entities. We call this form of the world simply the given and—insofar as we do not develop it through conscious activity but find it ready-made—we call it percept. Within the world of percepts, we perceive ourselves. But if something did not emerge out of this self-percept that proved capable of linking both percepts in general and also {{the sum of all}} other percepts with the percept of our self, our self-percept would remain simply one among many. This emerging something, however, is no longer a mere percept; nor is it, like percepts, simply present. It is produced through activity and initially appears linked to what we perceive as our self, but its inner meaning reaches beyond the self. It adds conceptual <b>determinates</b> to individual percepts, but these conceptual <b>determinates</b> relate to one another and are grounded in a whole. It determines conceptually what is achieved through self-perception conceptually, just as it determines all other percepts. It places this as the subject or “I” over against objects. This “something” is thinking, and the conceptual <b>determinates</b> are concepts and ideas.|$|E

This is the preliminary stage. He differs from Dignāga for whom the <b>determinates</b> of cognitions are subjective constructs imposed upon the given, and constructive cognition is not a perception; Praśastapāda, who was a realist, avers that the <b>determinates</b> are objective constituents of reality and their conceptual co-relates are not inter-subjective fictions. Praśastapāda by redefining substance as per se a possessor of attributes opened new turf by separating the cosmological from the logical dimensions of concepts. His commentary overshadowed the Vaisheshika Sutras and became the main vehicle for later commentaries. Praśastapāda describes {{the dissolution of the}} earth, water, air and fire in terms of their atomic constituents but excludes space because space is non-atomic. With regard to the conjoining and disjoining of atoms he includes a higher will or order as the guiding principle of universal dissolution which over-rides the natural karma of atoms. Kaṇāda does not directly refer to Ishvara (God) but Praśastapāda sees Ishvara as the cause of the universe but does not explain how God creates.|$|E

40|$|A major {{difficulty}} with logic programming is combinatorial explosion: since goals are solved with possibly indeterminate (i. e., branching) reductions, the resulting search trees may grow wildly. Constraint logic programming systems {{try to avoid}} combinatorial explosion by building in strong <b>determinate</b> (i. e., non-branching) reduction {{in the form of}} constraint simplification. In this paper we present two concepts, residuation and guarded rules, for further strengthening <b>determinate</b> reduction. Both concepts apply to constraint logic programming in general and yield an operational semantics that coincides with the declarative semantics. Residuation is a control strategy giving priority to <b>determinate</b> reductions. Guarded rules are logical consequences of programs adding otherwise unavailable <b>determinate</b> reductions...|$|R
