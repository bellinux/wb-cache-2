But depending on the allocation of tax revenues and initial pollution per-mits, the instruments have very different wealth implications for the individual countries. The paper highlights the distributional effects of climate policies by calculating and comparing <b>emission</b> <b>budget</b> alloca-tions under three different schemes that are in line with a 2 ?C warm-ing target. We calculate implicit carbon budgets up to 2050 under a globally uniform CO 2 price, a design proposed by Weitzman (2014). We then compare the allocation with the budget derived from equity principles by Bretschger (2013) and with <b>emission</b> <b>budgets</b> under egalitarian <b>emission</b> rights as proposed by BASIC (2011). Our results show that implicit burden sharing across countries varies substantially with the different policy regimes.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations at level that will avoid dangerous climate impacts. However, greenhouse gas concentration stabilization is an awkward {{framework within which}} to assess dangerous climate change {{on account of the}} significant lag between a given concentration level, and the eventual equilibrium temperature change. By contrast, recent research has shown that global temperature change can be well described by a given cumulative carbon <b>emissions</b> <b>budget.</b> Here, we propose that cumulative carbon emissions represent an alternate framework that is applicable both as a tool for climate mitigation {{as well as for the}} assessment of potential climate impacts. We show first that both atmospheric CO 2 concentration at a given year and the associated temperature change are generally associated with a unique cumulative carbon <b>emissions</b> <b>budget</b> that is largely independent of the emissions scenario. The rate of global temperature change can therefore be related to first order to the rate of increase of cumulative carbon emissions. However, transient warming over the next century will also be strongly affected by emissions of shorter lived forcing agents such as aerosols and methane. Non-CO 2 emissions therefore contribute to uncertainty in the cumulative carbon budget associated with near-term temperature targets, and may suggest the need for a mitigation approach that considers separately short- and long-lived gas emissions. By contrast, long-term temperature change remains primarily associated with total cumulative carbon emissions due to the much longer atmospheric residence time of CO 2 relative to other major climate forcing agents...|$|E

The PM 2. 5 mass concentration varies from 60 to 390 µg m− 3 during paddy-residue burning (October–November) with dominant contribution from organic carbon (OC≈ 33 %), whereas contribution from elemental carbon (EC) centres at ~ 4 %. Water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) accounts for about 50 % of OC. In contrast, mass concentration of PM 2. 5 {{during the period of}} wheat-residue burning (April–May) is significantly lower, varies from 18 to 123 µg m− 3 and mass fractions of EC and OC are 7 and 26 %, respectively. The diagnostic ratios of OC/EC (11 ± 2), WSOC/OC (0. 52 ± 0. 02), nss-K+/OC (0. 06 ± 0. 00) and ΣPAHs/EC (4. 3 ± 0. 7 mg/g) from paddy-residue burning emissions are significantly different than those from wheat-residue burning (OC/EC: 3. 0 ± 0. 4; WSOC/OC: 0. 60 ± 0. 03; nss-K+/OC: 0. 14 ± 0. 01 and ΣPAHs/EC: 1. 3 ± 0. 2 mg/g).

Over the 2000 – 2009 period, using this model, we estimate mean global emissions of 465  Tg C yr − 1 for isoprene, 107. 5  Tg C yr − 1 for monoterpenes, 38  Tg C yr − 1 for methanol, 25  Tg C yr − 1 for acetone and 24  Tg C yr − 1 for sesquiterpenes.

The operation of a quota market under these alternative regimes is simulated on a spreadsheet, using 1990 – 1 data from 125 countries. A significant result is that once the South has secured a quota allocation based on the per capita principle, it stands collectively to lose from progress in abatement technology because of the strong link from technical progress to the world market price of quota. The more restricted NRFTS rule gives the South smaller gains from the quota system, but enables it to retain some of the rents from its own technical progress. Some implications for the South's position in future negotiations are noted. ...|$|E

Total ecosystem C (biomass C + soil C to 60  cm depth) ranged from 81. 8 to 153. 9  Mg C/ha. The bulk (~ 89  %) of the systems’ C stock was stored in the soils.

40|$|AbstractStringent {{long-term}} climate targets necessitate a {{limit on}} cumulative emissions in this century for which sufficient policy signals are lacking. Using nine energy-economy models, we explore how policies pursued {{during the next two}} decades impact long-term transformation pathways towards stringent long-term climate targets. Less stringent near-term policies (i. e., those with larger emissions) consume more of the long-term cumulative <b>emissions</b> <b>budget</b> in the 2010 – 2030 period, which increases the likelihood of overshooting the budget and the urgency of reducing GHG emissions after 2030. Furthermore, the larger near-term GHG emissions associated with less stringent policies are generated primarily by additional coal-based electricity generation. Therefore, to be successful in meeting the long-term target despite near-term emissions reductions that are weaker than those implied by cost-optimal mitigation pathways, models must prematurely retire significant coal capacity while rapidly ramping up low-carbon technologies between 2030 and 2050 and remove large quantities of CO 2 from the atmosphere {{in the latter half of}} the century. While increased energy efficiency lowers mitigation costs considerably, even with weak near-term policies, it does not substantially reduce the short-term reliance on coal electricity. However, increased energy efficiency does allow the energy system more flexibility in mitigating emissions and, thus, facilitates the post- 2030 transition...|$|E

While Antarctica {{is often}} {{described}} as a pristine environment, there is an increasing awareness of the potential threats from local pollution sources including tourist ships and emissions associated with scientific activities. However, to date there has been no systematic attempt to model the im-pacts of such pollutants at the continental scale. Indeed, until very recently there was not even a sulphur <b>emission</b> <b>budget</b> available for Antarctica. Here we present the first compre-hensive study of atmospheric pollution in Antarctica using a limited area chemistry climate model, and a monthly emis-sions inventory for sulphur from maintenance of research stations, ground and air traffic, shipping and the active Ere-bus volcano. We find that ship emissions, both sulphurous and black carbon, dominate anthropogenic pollution near the ground. Their prevalence is likely to rise dramatically if re-cent trends in tourism continue. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} role and {{implications}} of bio-energy with {{carbon capture and storage}} (BECCS) for addressing the climate change mitigation challenge. Framed {{within the context of the}} latest <b>emissions</b> <b>budgets,</b> and their associated uncertainty, we present a summary of the contribution of BECCS within the Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) scenarios used by the climate change community. Within this discussion we seek to shed light on two important areas. Firstly, that BECCS is a central, but often hidden element of many of the modelling work that underpins climate policy from the global to the national scale. The second area we address are the assumptions for BECCS embedded within IAM models, and the wider system consequences of these implied levels of deployment. In light of these challenges, we question whether BECCS can deliver what is anticipated of it within existing climate change policy...|$|R
40|$|This paper designs {{emission}} charging {{schemes to}} ensure traffic emissions not exceeding the <b>emission</b> <b>budgets</b> in <b>emission</b> regulation areas. In a network where all links are tollable, we prove that, under mild conditions, {{there exists a}} non-negative link-based toll scheme that achieves the transportation conformity requirement while minimizing total emissions. We further consider only tolling in the emission regulation areas and formulate a model to determine optimal area-based emission charges to ensure the conformity. The model is formulated as a mathematical program with complementarity constraints. A solution framework is developed to solve the model, leveraging on a derivative-free pattern search algorithm and integrating MOVES to estimate vehicular emissions more accurately. The proposed models are demonstrated on two numerical examples. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
