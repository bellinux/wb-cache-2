At this time, the eyelets were reinforced with stitches and were not placed across from one another, but instead staggered. This allowed the stays to be spiral laced.

30|$|While the TA 2011 conference {{as a whole}} defines its object area broadly as “questions of technology”, the {{perspective}} taken here will not address issues of participation that might arise <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>societal</b> fields which are or could be subject to processes of technologization or technization. I shall rather focus on technology assessment and technology policy as two different, but strongly interrelated domains. The claim is, on the one hand, that issues of participation are and should be considered differently {{in each of these}} domains with regard to problems of legitimation. Since these domains are structured by different institutional principles and fulfil different functions, problems of legitimation arise and are discussed on different grounds. While both have to do with “technology” as their subject matter, the basic explicit function of TA is to provide some kind of “assessment”, whereas the activities associated with the domain of technology policy go beyond the level of knowledge production and assessment and proceed to the level of making and implementing binding decisions. On the other hand, as these domains are strongly interrelated in many policy processes, I argue that specific problems of legitimation in particular cases cannot be understood adequately without analysing and evaluating also the specific ways of their interrelation in concrete contexts. From an overall perspective, we can see that participatory designs have been coupled (or decoupled) with one or both of these domains—a difference that makes a difference with regard to its possible impacts.|$|R

I analyze a total of six books, three books from 1996 - 1997 and three from 2005 - 2007. The examined textbooks include two second grade Natural Sciences, two fourth grade Spanish, and two sixth grade Social Sciences with each subject including one text from 1996 - 1997 and one from 2005 - 2007. I examine the textbooks to determine whether the visual images of males and females are 2 ̆ 2 sex-fair 2 ̆ 2 and/or 2 ̆ 2 sex-affirmative 2 ̆ 2 (concepts developed by Scott and Schau [1985]). Sex-fair texts have females appearing in half of the number of images and the images portray both females and males equally <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>societal</b> roles whether they are culturally traditional or not. Sex-affirmative texts stress the portrayal of females and males in roles opposite their traditional role (Eklund Koza, 1994).

Finally, governments can favour the establishment of processors by providing guaranteed loans or lower income tax to this type of enterprise (Terra Nord 2005).

40|$|During {{the past}} decades, {{innovation}} research has yielded countless empirical studies {{in a variety}} of disciplines. For all this quantity, we still lack an adequate understanding of basic qualities and mechanisms of its central subject. Which processes and conditions bring innovation about? How does it spread? And what is its genuine nature? Critics argue that these shortcomings have their roots in the conceptual limitations of established perspectives on innovation and in the fact that researchers confine themselves to studying technical and scientific novelties or marketable products. This self-restriction stands in marked contrast to the observation that innovation {{plays an important role in}} contemporary societies. The term is at least ubiquitous and its usage common <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>societal</b> fields. <b>In</b> the introduction to this HSR Special Issue, we subscribe to this critique and argue that the conceptual reductionism comes along with severe methodical and methodological limitations. These become manifest in a joint dominance of quantitative indicator-based research and ethnographic single case studies. Thus, researchers of innovation disregard a variety of possible data types and forms of analysis and rarely apply complex designs. It is also not common to consider the combination of multiple types of data and analysis in mixed methods approaches. The most serious issue, however, is that mainstream innovation research remains ignorant of a multitude of potential research questions and thereby loses sight of whole areas of interest. An overview of the empirical studies in this HSR Special Issue shows that the range of methods used is wider at the edges of the field of research. In order to relate these methods to each other and to the theoretical foundations of innovation research, we suggest a middle-range debate on methodology. " (author's abstract...|$|R

WHR regards women as vital elements of change, both in the process of societal as well as infrastructural development.

40|$|In both {{scientific}} {{work and in}} philosophy our concern is that subjects are directed towards objects, studying them, having control over them, getting to know them, and having them in their power. Michel Serres taught us that it is extremely necessary to reverse this direction. According to him we should describe {{the emergence of the}} object: how does the object come to the human, how does it shape humans and direct their lives? This process is called pragmatogony, a combination of two Greek words, namely pragma (thing, matter) and gonos (the created). The primacy of the object, or of things, are dealt with in terms of an archaeology of things. From this archaeology of things emerges the anthropology of science. This notion refers to the anthropological actions of science which clearly indicates that the sciences, however pure they claim to be, can never be separated from human involvements and that they are actively involved in this. This poses an argument in favour of the irreplaceable importance and relevance of the humanities not only for humans but also for the sciences and {{scientific work}} in general. The links and connections between humans, things, the sciences and the world constitute a generative power for invention that takes us forward in difficult times. The celebration of things and the creative power of the arts with respect to things illustrate the importance of a pragmatogonic stance for the survival and regeneration of the relevance of the humanities in any society and <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>societal</b> institutions. <b>In</b> scientific work, our preferred methodological concern generally is that subjects are directed towards objects, studying them, controlling them, giving shape to them, getting to know them and even possessing them and having power over them.

However, managing the interrelations between knowledge, innovation and practice is complicated. Facilitation by suitable knowledge services is needed. This paper explores the theory of converging knowledge, innovation, and practice, discusses some advances in information systems development, and identifies general requirements for pragmatic knowledge services. A trialogical approach to knowledge creation and learning is adopted as a viable theoretical basis. Also three examples of novel knowledge services Opasnet, Innovillage, and Knowledge Practices Environment (KPE), are presented. Eventually, it is concluded that pragmatic knowledge services, as hybrid systems of information technology and its users, are not only means for creation of practical knowledge, but vehicles of a cultural change from individualistic perceptions of knowledge work towards mediated collaboration...|$|R

40|$|The {{deaf and}} {{hard of hearing}} are part of marginalised {{individuals}} in Ghana who are often relegated to the background and therefore face barriers to participation in society. This lack of participation often leads to the inability to take control over one's own life and health. It also gives rise to feelings of inferiority in several situations. This feelings further leads to lack of self esteem and a perception of low self image which adversely affects the psychological and social health of a person. The Ghanaian society {{is one in which}} people have not been socialised to accept differences in terms of disabilities. Therefore, persons with disabilities, particularly the deaf are highly discriminated against. While communication remains the greatest barriers for the deaf, this study found out that there are other barriers to participation as well. The research explored issues of participation within the family, among peers, work colleagues and in other societal settings. It also explored participation issues within education, employment, health care and government sponsorship and delved into policies that impact on the issue of participation for the deaf. The research explored the personal experiences of the deaf and hard of hearing with the aim of identifying factors in the society which militate against their meaningful participation in society. Bronfenbrenner's (1979) ecology of human development theory was used to explain the interactions between the deaf and hard of hearing and their environments and to help identify the barriers faced at the various levels. Results of the research indicate multiple barriers for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing at the different levels of the Ghanaian society. Lack of participation in activities and lack of belongingness were felt by majority of the participants across the different settings of the Ghanaian society. There were impediments along the way in the different transitions the individual makes from the family to school through social life and work life. Participant's recount of their life experiences highlighted areas besides communication in which they face barriers. These areas include education, family and social life, employment, healthcare and access to support for persons with disabilities. There is a disability Act passed in Ghana, however, the positive things expressed in the act that will improve the life of persons with disabilities are yet to be realised. This is reflected in experiences recounted by participants of this research. The problem largely is with the implementation of the policy and enforcement of the law to create enabling conditions for the deaf and hard of hearing. It is evident from the study that to improve participation in daily life activities and to enable them gain control over their life and health, the deaf and hard of hearing need to be included <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>societal</b> activities. Quality of education and education in accessible formats should be made available to them to improve their chances of gaining employment and thereby increasing their standards of living and quality of life...|$|R
