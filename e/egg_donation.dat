25|$|In embryo donation, these extra embryos {{are given}} to other couples or women for {{transfer}} {{with the goal of}} producing a successful pregnancy. The resulting child is considered the child of the woman who carries it and gives birth, and not the child of the donor, the same as occurs with <b>egg</b> <b>donation</b> or sperm donation.|$|E
25|$|For frozen-thawed embryo {{transfer}} or transfer of embryo from <b>egg</b> <b>donation,</b> no previous ovarian hyperstimulation {{is required for}} the recipient before transfer, which can be performed in spontaneous ovulatory cycles. Still, various protocols exist for frozen-thawed {{embryo transfer}}s as well, such as protocols with ovarian hyperstimulation, protocols in which the endometrium is artificially prepared by estrogen and/or progesterone. A Cochrane review in 2010 of randomized studies came to the result that there generally is insufficient evidence to support the use of one intervention in preference to another, but with some evidence that in cycles where the endometrium is artificially prepared by estrogen or progesterone, it is beneficial to administer an additional drug that suppresses hormone production by the ovaries such as continuous administration of a gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa). For <b>egg</b> <b>donation,</b> there is evidence of a lower pregnancy rate and a higher cycle cancellation rate when the progesterone supplementation in the recipient is commenced prior to oocyte retrieval from the donor, as compared to commenced day of oocyte retrieval or the day after.|$|E
25|$|In <b>egg</b> <b>donation</b> and embryo donation, the {{resultant}} embryo after fertilisation is inserted in another woman {{than the one}} providing the eggs. These are resources for women with no eggs due to surgery, chemotherapy, or genetic causes; or with poor egg quality, previously unsuccessful IVF cycles or advanced maternal age. In the egg donor process, eggs are retrieved from a donor's ovaries, fertilised in the laboratory with the sperm from the recipient's partner, and the resulting healthy embryos are returned to the recipient's uterus.|$|E

25|$|In Sweden, {{official}} fertility clinics provide most necessary {{treatments and}} initial workup, {{but there are}} long waiting lists, especially for <b>egg</b> <b>donations,</b> since the donor gets just as low reward as the receiving couple are charged. However, there are private fertility clinics.|$|R
25|$|IVF is also {{considered}} suitable {{in cases where}} any of its expansions is of interest, that is, a procedure that is usually not necessary for the IVF procedure itself, but would be virtually impossible or technically difficult to perform without concomitantly performing methods of IVF. Such expansions include preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) to rule out presence of genetic disorders, as well as <b>egg</b> <b>donation</b> or surrogacy where the woman providing the egg isn't the same who will carry the pregnancy to term. Further details in the Expansions-section below.|$|E
25|$|Progesterone {{elevation}} (PE) {{on the day}} of induction {{of final}} maturation is associated with lower pregnancy rates in IVF cycles in women undergoing ovarian stimulation using GnRH analogues and gonadotrophins. At this time, compared to a progesterone level below 0.8ng/ml, a level between 0.8 and 1.1ng/ml confers an odds ratio of pregnancy of approximately 0.8, and a level between 1.2 and 3.0ng/ml confers an odds ratio of pregnancy of between 0.6 and 0.7. On the other hand, progesterone elevation does not seem to confer a decreased chance of pregnancy in frozen–thawed cycles and cycles with <b>egg</b> <b>donation.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Alana Stewart, who was {{conceived}} using donor sperm, began an online forum for donor children called AnonymousUS in 2010. The forum welcomes the viewpoints of anyone {{involved in the}} IVF process. Olivia Pratten, a donor-conceived Canadian, sued the province of British Columbia for access to records on her donor father's identity in 2008. [...] "I’m not a treatment, I’m a person, and those records belong to me,” Pratten said. In May 2012, a court ruled in Pratten's favour, agreeing that the laws at the time discriminated against donor children and making anonymous sperm and <b>egg</b> <b>donation</b> in British Columbia illegal.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{successful}} {{birth of a}} child after IVF treatment, Louise Brown, occurred in 1978. Louise Brown was born as a result of natural cycle IVF where no stimulation was made. The procedure took place at Dr Kershaw's Cottage Hospital (now Dr Kershaw's Hospice) in Royton, Oldham. Robert G. Edwards was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2010, the physiologist who co-developed the treatment together with Patrick Steptoe; Steptoe was not eligible for consideration as the Nobel Prize is not awarded posthumously. With <b>egg</b> <b>donation</b> and IVF, women who are past their reproductive years or have reached menopause can still become pregnant. Adriana Iliescu held the record as the oldest woman to give birth using IVF and donated egg, when she gave birth in 2004 at the age of 66, a record passed in 2006. After the IVF treatment many couples are able to get pregnant without any fertility treatments. In 2012 it was estimated that five million children had been born worldwide using IVF and other assisted reproduction techniques.|$|E
50|$|<b>Egg</b> <b>donation</b> is {{the process}} by which a woman donates eggs to enable another woman to {{conceive}} as part of an assisted reproduction treatment or for biomedical research. For assisted reproduction purposes, <b>egg</b> <b>donation</b> typically involves in vitro fertilization technology, with the eggs being fertilized in the laboratory; more rarely, unfertilized eggs may be frozen and stored for later use. <b>Egg</b> <b>donation</b> is a third party reproduction as part of assisted reproductive technology (ART).|$|E
50|$|Pregnancies with <b>egg</b> <b>donation</b> are {{associated}} with a slightly increased risk of placental pathology. The local and systemic immunologic changes are also more pronounced than in natural pregnancies, so {{it has been suggested that}} the association is caused by reduced maternal immune tolerance towards the fetus, as the genetic similarity between the carrier and fetus from an <b>egg</b> <b>donation</b> is less than in a natural pregnancy. In contrast, the incidence of other perinatal complications, such as intrauterine growth restriction, preterm birth and congenital malformations, is comparable to conventional IVF without <b>egg</b> <b>donation.</b>|$|E
50|$|Until late November 2005, Hwang {{was criticized}} only for unpublicized ethical violations.

Later controversies would center around scientific misconduct.|$|R

5000|$|Shortly {{after his}} {{groundbreaking}} 2005 work, Hwang {{was appointed to}} head the new World Stem Cell Hub, a facility {{that was to be}} the world's leading stem cell research centre. However, in November 2005, Gerald Schatten, a University of Pittsburgh researcher who had worked with Hwang for two years, made the surprise announcement that he had ceased his collaboration with Hwang. In an interview, Schatten commented that [...] "my decision is grounded solely on concerns regarding oocyte (<b>egg)</b> <b>donations</b> in Hwang's research reported in 2004." [...] Following an intense media probe, Roh Sung-il, one of Hwang's close collaborators and head of MizMedi Women's Hospital, held a news conference on November 21.|$|R
50|$|In the US and UK, {{if desired}} (and if the egg donor agrees), the couple can meet and get {{acquainted with the}} egg donor, her {{children}} and family members. More often, <b>egg</b> <b>donations</b> are anonymous or semi-anonymous (i.e. the egg donor may provide personal and medical information, photographs of herself and/or family members, and an email or third party willing to convey communications between the donor and recipients). In some countries, the law requires non-anonymity (e.g., the UK). In other countries, the law requires anonymity (e.g., France, Spain, the Czech Republic, South Africa). In the US the choice between anonymity, semi-anonymity and non-anonymity is made by the donor and recipient, although some IVF clinics that maintain their own databases of egg donors strongly encourage or require anonymity.|$|R
50|$|Pregnancies {{resulting}} from <b>egg</b> <b>donation,</b> where the carrier is less genetically {{similar to the}} fetus than a biological mother, {{are associated with a}} higher incidence of pregnancy-induced hypertension and placental pathology. The local and systemic immunologic changes are also more pronounced than in normal pregnancies, so {{it has been suggested that}} the higher frequency of some conditions in <b>egg</b> <b>donation</b> may be caused by reduced immune tolerance from the mother.|$|E

50|$|The {{first child}} born from <b>egg</b> <b>donation</b> was {{reported}} in Australia in 1983. In July 1983, a clinic in Southern California reported a pregnancy using <b>egg</b> <b>donation,</b> {{which led to the}} birth of the first American child born from <b>egg</b> <b>donation</b> on February 3, 1984. This procedure was performed at the Harbor UCLA Medical Center and the University of California at Los Angeles School of Medicine. In the procedure, which is no longer used today, a fertilized egg that was just beginning to develop was transferred from one woman in whom it had been conceived by artificial insemination to another woman who gave birth to the infant 38 weeks later. The sperm used in the artificial insemination came from the husband of the woman who bore the baby.|$|E
50|$|The law {{provides}} {{that there must}} not be more than six births per donor. The same law applies to <b>egg</b> <b>donations.</b> Prior to {{the change in the}} law in 2008, clinics set their own maximums on the numbers of children produced from each donor. Spain was becoming a destination for fertility tourists, i.e. women seeking to become pregnant through the use of donor sperm and Spanish clinics were purchasing donor sperm from other countries in order to satisfy demand (see Onselling in main article). Many UK women were travelling to Spain at that time to be impregnated with sperm imported from clinics in the UK for example, where there were already controls on the numbers of children which each donor could produce.|$|R

She immediately takes a liking to them - except for one, Judy (Nicole Drespel), who is significantly less attractive than the rest of them. Jenna kicks Judy out of the group - but soon regrets this after the rest of the kids kick Jenna out for being [...] "too old". Jenna then realizes that Judy is the only child who proves Jenna has any good in her and decides to get to know her better.|$|R
25|$|Stem cell experts {{consider}} {{it unlikely that}} such large numbers of human <b>egg</b> <b>donations</b> would occur in a developed country because of the unknown long-term public health effects of treating large numbers of healthy young women with heavy doses of hormones in order to induce hyperovulation (ovulating several eggs at once). Although such treatments have been performed for several decades now, the long-term effects have not been studied or declared safe to use {{on a large scale}} on otherwise healthy women. Longer-term treatments with much lower doses of hormones are known to increase the rate of cancer decades later. Whether hormone treatments to induce hyperovulation could have similar effects is unknown. There are also ethical questions surrounding paying for eggs. In general, marketing body parts is considered unethical and is banned in most countries. Human eggs have been a notable exception to this rule for some time.|$|R
50|$|Women may {{resort to}} <b>egg</b> <b>donation</b> because their ovaries {{may not be}} able to produce a {{substantial}} number of viable eggs. Women may experience premature ovarian failure and stop producing viable eggs during their reproductive years. Some women may be born without ovaries. Ovaries damaged by chemotherapy or radiotherapy may also no longer produce healthy eggs. Older women with diminished ovarian reserves or older women who are going through menopause could also become pregnant with <b>egg</b> <b>donation.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Egg</b> <b>donation</b> {{is illegal}} {{in a number}} of European {{countries}} including Germany, Austria and Italy. Many women then will seek treatment in places where the procedure is allowed such as Spain and the United States where donors can be paid for their donation. Almost half of all IVF treatments with donor eggs in Europe are performed in Spain. IVF with anonymous <b>egg</b> <b>donation</b> is also the main ART sought by Canadians traveling to the U.S, and is the sought procedure for 80% of cross-border treatments by Canadians.|$|E

[...] Additionally, surrogates showed a significantly higher pregnancy rate following frozen embryo transfers than their non-surrogate counterparts.|$|E
40|$|The article {{shows how}} the {{technology}} of social media sites facilitates new kinds of kinship. It ana-lyzes how ‘donor families’ – i. e., families in which the children are conceived via sperm and/or <b>egg</b> <b>donations</b> – negotiate kinship, family formations and gender when connecting with each other online. Family formation and parenting are closely connected with gender and gender norms, and online donor families, therefore, offer an opportunity for understanding gender and gender for-mations in contemporary times and contemporary media. By analyzing commentary threads of a Facebook group connecting donor families as well as interviews with users of this Facebook group, the article {{shows how the}} affordances of social media, especially the Facebook application for smart phones, {{are central to the}} formation and maintenance of new kinship relations. Furthermore, the article illustrates how conventional practices regarding gender and families on one hand are chal-lenged by the creation of new types of families, while simultaneously being maintained in discus-sions about choice of donor. Here, a longing for traditional family values seems to run underneath the discussion between members of these new families...|$|R
5000|$|The European Union has yet {{to issue}} {{consistent}} regulations with respect to stem cell research in member states. Whereas Germany, Austria, Italy, Finland, Ireland, Portugal and the Netherlands prohibit or severely restrict the use of embryonic stem cells, Greece, Sweden, Spain and the United Kingdom have created the legal basis to support this research. [...] Belgium bans reproductive cloning but allows therapeutic cloning of embryos. France prohibits reproductive cloning and embryo creation for research purposes, but enacted laws (with a sunset provision expiring in 2009) to allow scientists to conduct stem cell research on imported {{a large amount of}} embryos from in vitro fertilization treatments. [...] Germany has restrictive policies for stem cell research, but a 2008 law authorizes [...] "the use of imported stem cell lines produced before May 1, 2007." [...] Italy has a 2004 law that forbids all sperm or <b>egg</b> <b>donations</b> and the freezing of embryos, but allows, in effect, using existing stem cell lines that have been imported.

5|$|Between late 2005–2006 Hwang {{was accused}} {{of a series of}} misconducts. The first {{allegations}} related to his work prior to Snuppy; the claim that he had successfully cloned a human embryo. The charges alleged Hwang had paid for <b>egg</b> <b>donations</b> and that some of eggs came from his employees, which constitute serious breaches of the code of bioethics. It was later found that photographs he published did not depict what was suggested and that most of the stem-cell lines he claimed to have created were not clones at all. This brought serious doubts onto the validity of Snuppy, which Hwang consistently claimed was a genuine clone. Hwang hired HumanPass Inc., a Korean DNA lab to investigate Snuppy, who found that Snuppy was authentic. The findings by HumanPass were dismissed {{on the grounds that they}} were employed by Hwang, and a panel at the Seoul National University ordered their own investigation. The investigation found that, despite his fabrications in previous projects, Hwang's research related to Snuppy was accurate and Snuppy was a clone of the adult Afghan hound. As a result of his forgeries, Hwang was indicted for fraud and dismissed from the university.|$|R
