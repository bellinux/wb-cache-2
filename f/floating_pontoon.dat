5|$|From Han {{literary}} sources, it {{is known}} that wooden-trestle beam bridges, arch bridges, simple suspension bridges, and <b>floating</b> <b>pontoon</b> bridges existed in Han China. However, there are only two known references to arch bridges in Han literature, and only a single Han relief sculpture in Sichuan depicts an arch bridge.|$|E
5|$|The city of Seattle has {{multiple}} bridges that are significant {{due to their}} function, historical status, or engineering. Bridges are needed to mitigate the city's waterways and hilly topography. Twelve bridges have been granted historical status by the city, federal government, or both. Seattle also {{has some of the}} only permanent <b>floating</b> <b>pontoon</b> bridges in the world.|$|E
5|$|The Song navy was {{of great}} {{importance}} during the consolidation of the empire in the 10th century; during {{the war against the}} Southern Tang state the Song navy employed tactics such as defending large <b>floating</b> <b>pontoon</b> bridges across the Yangtze River in order to secure movements of troops and supplies. There were large ships in the Song navy that could carry 1,000 soldiers aboard their decks, while the swift-moving paddle-wheel craft were viewed as essential fighting ships in any successful naval battle.|$|E
5000|$|... c1914 Reinforced Concrete <b>floating</b> <b>pontoons</b> [...] ".. 180ft. {{long with}} {{a beam of}} 80ft... in Sydney Harbour". Believed {{to be the largest}} <b>floating</b> <b>pontoons</b> in the world at the time.|$|R
5000|$|The {{parallel}} {{structures were}} designed to accommodate three lanes and one pedestrian footwalk each. Between the two <b>floating</b> <b>pontoons</b> made of concrete, each 115 metres long and 22 metres wide, a hydraulically driven rotating middle section made of steel is positioned to allow for undisturbed navigation. To compensate for differences in level {{as well as for}} transverse inclinations (heeling) and longitudinal displacements resulting from traffic loads and wave action acting on the ramp, another two rows of 28 transitory elements are installed between the <b>floating</b> <b>pontoons</b> and the transitory ramp on either bank.|$|R

5|$|On October 10, 1848 the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad—Chicago's first railroad—began {{operating}} out of a depot {{on the west side}} of the Chicago River, near the corner of Canal and Kinzie Streets. Though the City of Chicago had authorized the railroad to construct a bridge across the north branch of the river as early as July 17, 1848, it was not until 1851 that the railroad began to purchase the land needed to build the Wells Street Station to the east of the river. In order to access the new station a <b>floating</b> <b>pontoon</b> bridge designed by Jenks D. Perkins was built across the north branch at roughly the same location as the earlier pedestrian bridge. This bridge—the first railroad bridge in Chicago—was completed in 1852, allowing trains to access the railroad's new Wells Street Station and subsequently industry on the north bank of the Chicago River as far as the Ogden Slip and Navy Pier.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} common bridge-types built during the Han was the wooden-trestle beam bridge, {{described}} by literary sources and seen in reliefs carved on tomb bricks. Evidence for arch bridges is elusive: one outside of Chengdu's south gate is claimed to date to the Han period, while that built by Ma Xian (馬賢) (fl. 135 CE) was certainly a beam bridge. In artwork, a relief sculpture from a Han tomb in Sichuan province shows an arch bridge with a gradual curve, suggesting that it is segmental, although the use of such bridges are not entirely confirmed. Although there are rare references to simple suspension bridges in Han sources, these are only mentioned in connection with travels to foreign countries in the Himalaya, Hindukush and Afghanistan, demonstrating the antiquity of the invention there. <b>Floating</b> <b>pontoon</b> bridges made of boats secured by iron chains were built during the Han (some even spanning the Yellow River and Yangzi River) and were most often employed for military purposes since they could be easily assembled and then disassembled.|$|E
5|$|The Later Zhou was {{the last}} of the Five Dynasties that had {{controlled}} northern China {{after the fall of the}} Tang dynasty in 907. Zhao Kuangyin, later known as Emperor Taizu (r. 960–976), usurped the throne and deposed the last Zhou ruler Guo Zongxun with the support of military commanders in 960, initiating the Song dynasty. Upon taking the throne, his first goal was the reunification of China after half a century of political division. This included the conquests of Nanping, Wu-Yue, Southern Han, Later Shu, and Southern Tang in the south as well as the Northern Han and the Sixteen Prefectures in the north. With capable military officers such as Yang Ye (d. 986), Liu Tingrang (929–987), Cao Bin (931–999) and Huyan Zan (d. 1000), the early Song military became the dominant force in China. Innovative military tactics, such as defending supply lines across <b>floating</b> <b>pontoon</b> bridges led to success in battle such as the Song assault against the Southern Tang state while crossing the Yangzi River in 974. Using a mass of arrow fire from crossbowmen, Song forces were able to defeat the renowned war elephant corps of the Southern Han on January 23, 971, thus forcing the submission of Southern Han and terminating the first and last elephant corps that would make up a regular division within a Chinese army.|$|E

50|$|Two {{variants}} of modernised air-conditioned and Wi-Fi enabled catamaran passenger boats are {{proposed for the}} project. The boats with passenger capacity of 50 and 100, will operate at an optimal speed of 8 knots, {{with the potential to}} increase up to 12 knots. The boats will be equipped with latest safety and communication devices. Small battery operated boats will ply on the narrow lanes. The headways vary between 10 minutes to 20 minutes across various routes. The jetties are proposed to have <b>floating</b> <b>pontoons</b> with automatic docking system technology. The <b>floating</b> <b>pontoons</b> will be covered with re-traceable sheds so as to provide comfort during rainy season.|$|R

An all-weather boat ramp, with <b>floating</b> <b>pontoon</b> and a refurbished town jetty launching facilities for boat based fishermen.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century the eastern shore of the Derwent was still little more than isolated villages, and homesteads. This remained the situation for the next forty years, until on 22 December 1943, the <b>floating</b> <b>pontoon</b> style Hobart Bridge was opened.|$|E
25|$|The {{rebellion}} of Gongsun Shu in Sichuan province {{against the}} re-established Han Dynasty {{during the year}} 33 AD was recorded in the Book of Later Han, compiled by Fan Ye in the 5th century. Gongsun sent a naval force of some twenty to thirty thousand soldiers down the Yangtze River to attack {{the position of the}} Han commander Cen Peng. After Cen Peng defeated several of Gongsun's officers, Gongsun had a long <b>floating</b> <b>pontoon</b> bridge constructed across the Yangtze with fortified posts on it, protected further by a boom, as well as erecting forts on the river bank to provide further missile fire at another angle. Cen Peng was unable to break through this barrier and barrage of missile fire, until he equipped his navy with castle ships, rowed assault vessels, and 'colliding swoopers' used for ramming in a fleet of several thousand vessels and quelled Gongsun's rebellion.|$|E

50|$|In 1858 Brunel {{appointed}} Richardson as {{the resident}} engineer of the Bristol and South Wales Union Railway. This work involved railway lines and tunnels, but also two large piers at New Passage and Portskewett.

500|$|The Brooke Street Pier is a <b>floating</b> <b>pontoon</b> {{building}} at Sullivans Cove in the waterfront {{area of the}} city of Hobart, Tasmania, Australia. [...] It was constructed in 2014–15 at a cost of [...] It weighs [...] and was Australia's largest floating building upon completion. It is connected to the Hobart shore at Franklin Wharf, near the base of Brooke Street. Primarily a ferry terminal, the architect has described it as a [...] "tourism transport hub".|$|E
500|$|In 1893 the Ship Canal Company sold {{a parcel}} of land {{just east of the}} Mode Wheel Locks to the newly {{established}} Manchester Dry Docks Company. The graving docks were constructed adjacent to the south bank of the canal, and a <b>floating</b> <b>pontoon</b> dock was built nearby. Each of the three graving docks could accommodate ocean-going ships of up to [...] in length and [...] in beam, equivalent to vessels of 8,000gross tons. Manchester Liners acquired control of the company in 1974, to ensure the availability of facilities for the repair of its fleet of ships.|$|E
500|$|The {{bridge was}} {{designed}} with a movable <b>floating</b> <b>pontoon.</b> [...] Steel transition spans connect the two {{ends of the}} fixed bridge to the pontoon. Two hydraulic rams, located {{on either side of}} the transition spans, lift the transition spans off the pontoon allowing the pontoon to retract under the fixed bridge. [...] The transition spans accommodate [...] of tide movement and [...] of pontoon movement. [...] In addition, the spans sit on a central pivot that assists with the movement caused by waves. [...] In the event that the transition spans are unable to bear the stress of movement of the pontoon, specifically in the case of seismic activity, the bridge has a breakaway feature that can be easily repaired.|$|E

50|$|Australian singer Delta Goodrem sang Together We Are One, {{the theme}} song for the 2006 games while many {{fireworks}} were ignited, within the stadium, on the backs on roller-bladers circling the singer, and fireworks were also ignited {{on the banks of}} the Yarra, as well as the <b>floating</b> <b>pontoons,</b> and Melbourne's larger skyscrapers.|$|R
50|$|As {{early as}} 1860, {{engineer}} Fred Bell, commissioned by North Shore farmers wanting to herd animals to market in Auckland, had proposed a harbour crossing {{in the general}} vicinity of the bridge. It would have used <b>floating</b> <b>pontoons,</b> but the plan failed due to the £16,000 cost estimate (Adjusted for inflation as of March 2017 $1.9 Million Dollars).|$|R
2500|$|Brunel next built another pier, an iron <b>floating</b> <b>pontoon</b> [...] long by [...] wide (91m × 12m) for the Irish Steamship Company whose vessels were {{regularly}} using the harbour. Then he constructed the inner basin, with limestone and granite walls. It had dock gates and a drydock {{at the western}} side and was [...] in size. It opened in 1857. Part of the earth dam that had been built across the harbour to facilitate {{the creation of the}} inner basin was retained for the later construction of Trinity Pier. From then on a few modifications were made, but no major changes took place until the construction of the ferry terminal in the 1970s.|$|E
2500|$|Land {{clearing}} operations {{had been}} undertaken by 1st Field Squadron since {{the occupation of}} Nui Dat to improve base defences and observation. Later they were extended for tactical purposes to open up key routes within Phuoc Tuy by removing vegetation to deny cover and concealment to the Viet Cong, and also provided arable land for villagers {{as part of the}} Pacification program. In March 1968, a dedicated Land Clearing Team was formed by 17th Construction Squadron elements at Nui Dat to supplement existing arrangements. One particular operation, codenamed [...] "Cooktown Orchid" [...] conducted in April 1968, saw a large element of Plant Troop deploy under infantry and armoured protection to clear undergrowth and trees {{in the foothills of the}} Long Hai mountains. Land clearance operations proved quite dangerous for the plant operators who were exposed to land mines and booby traps, as well as to attack by small arms and other direct fire weapons. During this operation one D8 bulldozer was destroyed, and a sapper injured when an RPG round hit the dozer he was operating. In 1969 the squadron continued with land clearing tasks within the 1 ATF area of operations. During the operation, numerous bunker systems were uncovered and the D8 dozers detonated many mines. In August 1969, 9 Troop assisted in replacing a sabotaged bridge with a [...] <b>floating</b> <b>pontoon</b> bridge. The enemy had blown the bridge on National Route 51, [...] south-east of Saigon. The troop, working with the US Engineers, took only 13 hours to re-open the road.|$|E

50|$|Access on foot {{along the}} Limehouse Cut was {{difficult}} in the area below the Blackwall Tunnel approach road, but was made easier {{as a result of}} an innovative scheme to create a floating towpath. This was opened in July 2003 and consisted of 60 <b>floating</b> <b>pontoons,</b> creating a 240 m walkway complete with green glowing edges.|$|R
50|$|There {{is a huge}} {{variety in}} sheerleg capacity. The smaller cranes start around 50 tons in lifting capacity, with the largest being able to lift 10,000 tons. The bigger {{sheerlegs}} usually have their own propulsion system and have a large accommodation facility on board, while smaller units are <b>floating</b> <b>pontoons</b> {{that need to be}} towed to their workplace by tugboats.|$|R
50|$|The first pier {{here was}} built in 1839 at {{what was then the}} edge of the harbour. It served as a {{terminal}} for steamships, which could be relatively easily filled with coal here. The pier ensured a sufficient security distance from the city, since these ships were fueled by coal which presented a fire risk. The current piers built in 1907 consist of <b>floating</b> <b>pontoons,</b> which are accessible from land by ten movable bridges.|$|R

50|$|The {{idea was}} never taken up. Pyke did not {{appreciate}} {{that it was}} not practicable to construct a pipeline without first building a road, and a pipeline would be militarily very vulnerable. The practical problems of the Normandy Landings were solved by Royal Navy researchers, who built floating concrete caissons (Mulberries) and <b>floating</b> <b>pontoons</b> (Swiss Roll) along which trucks could drive from ship to shore, as described in Gerald Pawle's book The Secret War (1957).|$|R
5000|$|<b>Floats</b> (also called <b>pontoons)</b> are {{airtight}} hollow structures, {{similar to}} pressure vessels, {{designed to provide}} buoyancy in water. Their principal applications are in watercraft hulls and aircraft floats, <b>floating</b> pier and <b>pontoon</b> bridge construction, and marine engineering applications such as salvage.|$|R
50|$|Construction {{began on}} the new east-half <b>floating</b> <b>{{pontoons}}</b> at Concrete Technology in April 2006. Fourteen pontoons will be built in four cycles at the site. Completed <b>pontoons</b> will be <b>floated</b> out of the graving dock in Tacoma and transported to Seattle for outfitting at Todd Shipyards. Outfitting includes adding all electrical and mechanical parts, connecting the pontoons into sections and building the roadway {{on top of the}} pontoons. Another three pontoons, built during the west-half bridge replacement in the early 1980s, will be retrofitted in Seattle.|$|R
