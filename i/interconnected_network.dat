5|$|Most fungi grow as hyphae, {{which are}} cylindrical, thread-like {{structures}} 2–10µm {{in diameter and}} up to several centimeters in length. Hyphae grow at their tips (apices); new hyphae are typically formed by emergence of new tips along existing hyphae by a process called branching, or occasionally growing hyphal tips fork, giving rise to two parallel-growing hyphae. Hyphae also sometimes fuse when they come into contact, a process called hyphal fusion (or anastamosis). These growth processes {{lead to the development}} of a mycelium, an <b>interconnected</b> <b>network</b> of hyphae. Hyphae can be either septate or coenocytic. Septate hyphae are divided into compartments separated by cross walls (internal cell walls, called septa, that are formed at right angles to the cell wall giving the hypha its shape), with each compartment containing one or more nuclei; coenocytic hyphae are not compartmentalized. Septa have pores that allow cytoplasm, organelles, and sometimes nuclei to pass through; an example is the dolipore septum in fungi of the phylum Basidiomycota. Coenocytic hyphae are in essence multinucleate supercells.|$|E
25|$|Some {{types of}} {{transmitting}} antenna {{systems in the}} VLF, LF, MF and lower SW range must have a good ground to operate efficiently. For example, a vertical monopole antenna requires a ground plane that often consists of an <b>interconnected</b> <b>network</b> of wires running radially away {{from the base of}} the antenna for a distance about equal to the height of the antenna. Sometimes a counterpoise is used as a ground plane, supported above the ground.|$|E
25|$|Although the South started {{early to}} build railways, it {{concentrated}} on short lines linking cotton regions to oceanic or river ports {{and the absence}} of an <b>interconnected</b> <b>network</b> was a major handicap during the Civil War. The North and Midwest constructed networks that linked every city by 1860. In the heavily settled the Midwestern Corn Belt, over 80 percent of farms were within 10 miles of a railway, facilitating the shipment of grain, hogs and cattle to national and international markets. A large number of short lines were built, but thanks to a fast developing financial system based on Wall Street and oriented to railway bonds, the majority were consolidated into 20 trunk lines by 1890. State and local governments often subsidized lines, but rarely owned them.|$|E

25|$|The Sundarbans is intersected by {{a complex}} network of tidal waterways, mudflats and small islands of salt-tolerant {{mangrove}} forests. The <b>interconnected</b> <b>network</b> of waterways makes almost {{every corner of}} the forest accessible by boat. The area is known for the Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris), as well as numerous fauna including species of birds, spotted deer, crocodiles and snakes. The fertile soils of the delta have been subject to intensive human use for centuries, and the ecoregion has been mostly converted to intensive agriculture, with few enclaves of forest remaining. The remaining forests, taken together with the Sundarbans mangroves, are important habitat for the endangered tiger. Additionally, the Sundarbans serves a crucial function as a protective barrier for the millions of inhabitants in and around Khulna and Mongla against the floods that result from the cyclones. The Sundarbans has also been enlisted among the finalists in the New7Wonders of Nature.|$|E
25|$|The {{endoplasmic}} reticulum (ER) {{is a type}} of organelle in eukaryotic cells that forms an <b>interconnected</b> <b>network</b> of flattened, membrane-enclosed sacs or tube-like structures known as cisternae. The membranes of the ER are continuous with the outer nuclear membrane. The {{endoplasmic reticulum}} occurs in most types of eukaryotic cells, but is absent from red blood cells and spermatozoa. There are two types of endoplasmic reticulum: rough and smooth. The outer (cytosolic) face of the rough endoplasmic reticulum is studded with ribosomes that are the sites of protein synthesis. The rough endoplasmic reticulum is especially prominent in cells such as hepatocytes. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum lacks ribosomes and functions in lipid manufacture and metabolism, the production of steroid hormones, and detoxification. The smooth ER is especially abundant in mammalian liver and gonad cells. The lacy membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum were first seen in 1945 using electron microscopy.|$|E
25|$|Another {{development}} {{was the idea}} of 'European superiority'. The ideal of civilisation was taken over from the ancient Greeks and Romans: Discipline, education and living in the city were required to make people civilised; Europeans and non-Europeans were judged for their civility, and Europe regarded itself as superior to other continents. There was a movement by some such as Montaigne that regarded the non-Europeans as a better, more natural and primitive people. Post services were founded all over Europe, which allowed a humanistic <b>interconnected</b> <b>network</b> of intellectuals across Europe, despite religious divisions. However, the Roman Catholic Church banned many leading scientific works; this led to an intellectual advantage for Protestant countries, where the banning of books was regionally organised. Francis Bacon and other advocates of science tried to create unity in Europe by focusing on the unity in nature.1 In the 15th century, {{at the end of the}} Middle Ages, powerful sovereign states were appearing, built by the New Monarchs who were centralising power in France, England, and Spain. On the other hand, the Parliament in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth grew in power, taking legislative rights from the Polish king. The new state power was contested by parliaments in other countries especially England. New kinds of states emerged which were co-operation agreements among territorial rulers, cities, farmer republics and knights.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, every {{electronic}} system, {{ranging from}} a small mobile phone to a satellite sent into space, has a System-on-Chip (SoC). SoCs have undergone rapid evolution and are still progressing at a swift pace. Due to explosive evolution of semiconductor industry, the devices are scaling down at a rapid rate and hence, the SoCs today have become communication-centric and shared bus system and crossbar system were fail to performed communication in side SoC. Interconnection networks offer an alternate solution to this communication paradigm and are becoming persistent in SoC. A NoC based <b>interconnect</b> <b>network</b> is a well-organized and efficiently use of limited communication channel while maintaining low packet latency, high saturation throughput, high communication bandwidth amongst different IPs core with a minimum area and low power-dissipation. In this thesis we present details performance analysis of four <b>interconnect</b> <b>network</b> mesh, torus, fat tree and butterfly in term of latency and throughput under uniform, tornado, neighbour, bit reversal and bit complement traffic using cycle accurate simulator. We also implement NoC <b>interconnect</b> <b>networks</b> on FPGA and see the effect of NoC parameters(FDW,FBD,VC) on FPGA, and validate their performance through FPGA synthesis. We found that the FDW and buffer depth have the great effect on FPGA resources, Virtual Channels (VCs) with all NoC parameter have considerably effect on buffer size and routing and logic requirements at NoC. We also analysis all <b>interconnect</b> <b>networks</b> in term of power and area at 65 nm technology by using synopsis tool.

25|$|Jean Macfarlane {{founded the}} University of California, Berkeley's Institute of Human Development, {{formerly}} called the Institute of Child Welfare, in 1927. The Institute {{was instrumental in}} initiating studies of healthy development, in contrast to previous work that had been dominated by theories based on pathological personalities. The studies looked at human development during the Great Depression and World War II, unique historical circumstances under which a generation of children grew up. The Oakland Growth Study, initiated by Harold Jones and Herbert Stolz in 1931, aimed to study the physical, intellectual, and social development {{of children in the}} Oakland area. Data collection began in 1932 and continued until 1981, allowing the researchers to gather longitudinal data on the individuals that extended past adolescence into adulthood. Jean Macfarlane launched the Berkeley Guidance Study, which examined the development of children in terms of their socioeconomic and family backgrounds. These studies provided the background for Glen Elder in the 1960s, to propose a life-course perspective of adolescent development. Elder formulated several descriptive principles of adolescent development. The principle of historical time and place states that an individual's development is shaped by the period and location in which they grow up. The principle of the importance of timing in one's life refers to the different impact that life events have on development based on when in one's life they occur. The idea of linked lives states that one's development is shaped by the <b>interconnected</b> <b>network</b> of relationships of which one is a part; and the principle of human agency asserts that one's life course is constructed via the choices and actions of an individual within the context of their historical period and social network.|$|E

A mold colony does not consist of discrete organisms but is an <b>interconnected</b> <b>network</b> of hyphae called a mycelium. [...] All growth occurs at hyphal tips, with cytoplasm and organelles flowing forwards as the hyphae advance over or through new food sources. Nutrients are absorbed at the hyphal tip. In artificial environments such as buildings, humidity and temperature are often stable enough to foster the growth of mold colonies, commonly seen as a downy or furry coating growing on food or other surfaces.|$|E

[...] To establish that nervous tissue is made up of discrete cells, the Spanish physician Santiago Ramón y Cajal and his students used a stain developed by Camillo Golgi to reveal the myriad shapes of neurons, which they rendered painstakingly.
