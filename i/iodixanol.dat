40|$|PURPOSE: To compare {{changes in}} urinary {{viscosity}} in the renal tubules following administration of a high-viscosity iso-osmolar contrast agent (<b>iodixanol)</b> to that observed following administration of a less viscous, higher osmolar contrast agent (iopromide) in anesthetized rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 43 rats were studied. Experiments {{were approved by}} the Berlin, Germany, animal protection administration. A viscometer was developed to measure viscosity in minute samples (7 microL). Urine was collected, viscosity was measured (at 37 degrees C), and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was determined by means of creatinine clearance. Boluses of 1. 5 mL of <b>iodixanol</b> (320 mg iodine per milliliter, iso-osmolar to plasma, high viscosity) or iopromide (370 mg iodine per milliliter, higher osmolality and lower viscosity than <b>iodixanol)</b> were injected into the thoracic aorta. There were five groups (seven rats per group). Groups 1 (<b>iodixanol)</b> and 2 (iopromide) had free access to water prior to the experiment; groups 3 (<b>iodixanol)</b> and 4 (iopromide) received an additional infusion of isotonic saline (4 mL/kg/h). Group 5 was treated as group 1 but received only 0. 75 mL of <b>iodixanol.</b> The observation period was 100 minutes. Statistical comparisons were made by means of nonparametric procedures (Friedman test, Kruskal-Wallis test). RESULTS: <b>Iodixanol</b> increased urine viscosity from 0. 69 to 36. 7 mm(2) /sec; thus, urine became threefold more viscous than native <b>iodixanol</b> solution. The increase in urine viscosity after injection of iopromide was from 0. 73 to 2. 3 mm(2) /sec. While GFR was not significantly affected by iopromide, GFR transiently decreased by 50 % after administration of <b>iodixanol.</b> Iopromide had a diuretic effect twofold {{greater than that of}} <b>iodixanol.</b> Saline infusion blunted the viscosity rise and transient decline in GFR caused by <b>iodixanol,</b> as did reducing the <b>iodixanol</b> dose by 50 %. CONCLUSION: Contrast media, in particular <b>iodixanol,</b> increase urine viscosity (which is equal to tubular fluid viscosity in the collecting ducts); in response to <b>iodixanol,</b> GFR markedly decreases. Saline infusion attenuates this response, thus potentially explaining the protective effects of volume expansion in contrast medium-induced nephropathy...|$|E
40|$|RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES. The authors {{established}} a rat {{model of the}} twitching reaction to contrast media in striated muscle and investigated the influence of nonionic contrast medium on the twitching reaction regarding the nonionic dimer <b>iodixanol</b> compared with the monomer iohexol and the dimer iotrolan. The authors also studied the influences from the electrolyte additions of <b>iodixanol.</b> METHODS. The interval from start of contrast medium injection to start of head movement was compared for iohexol (140 and 350 mg iodine/mL), <b>iodixanol</b> (150 and 320 mg iodine/mL), and iotrolan (300 mg iodine/mL). Comparison was made with mannitol and mannitol containing the same electrolyte concentrations as <b>iodixanol</b> (150 and 320 mg iodine/mL). RESULTS. No differences in latency period were found between iohexol 140 mg iodine/mL (isotonic) and 350 mg iodine/mL (880 mOsm/kg). <b>Iodixanol</b> caused a lesser effect on the twitching reaction than the iohexol solutions and iotrolan. When the electrolytes of <b>iodixanol</b> were added to mannitol (300 mOsm/kg), there was a later onset of the twitching reaction than with electrolyte-free mannitol. CONCLUSIONS. Differences in latency period caused by a change in osmolality were not found. The interval for a twitching reaction was longer with <b>iodixanol</b> than with iohexol, iotrolan, and iso-osmolar mannitol. The weak effect of the <b>iodixanol</b> solution was probably partially caused by the electrolyte content...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe iso-osmolar {{contrast}} agent <b>iodixanol</b> {{may be associated}} with a lower incidence of cardiac events than low-osmolar contrast media (LOCM), but previous trials have yielded mixed results. ObjectiveTo compare the risk of total cardiovascular events of the iso-osmolar contrast medium, <b>iodixanol,</b> to LOCM. MethodsMedical literature databases were searched to identify comparisons between <b>iodixanol</b> and LOCM with cardiovascular events as a primary endpoint. A random-effects model was used to obtain pooled odds ratio (OR) for within-hospital and 30 -day events. ResultsA total of 2 prospective cross-sectional studies and 11 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (covering 6859 subjects) met our criteria. There {{was no significant difference in}} the incidence of within-hospital and 30 -day cardiovascular events when <b>iodixanol</b> was compared with LOCM, with pooled OR of 0. 72 (95 %CI 0. 49 – 1. 06, p= 0. 09) and 1. 19 (95 %CI 0. 70 – 2. 02, p= 0. 53), respectively. Subgroup analysis showed no relative difference when <b>iodixanol</b> was compared with ioxaglate (OR= 0. 92, 95 %CI 0. 50 – 1. 70, p= 0. 80) and iohexol (OR= 0. 75, 95 %CI 0. 48 – 1. 17, p= 0. 21). However, a reduction in the within-hospital cardiovascular events was observed when <b>iodixanol</b> was compared with LOCM in the RCT subgroup (OR= 0. 65, 95 %CI 0. 44 – 0. 96, p= 0. 03). Sensitivity analyses revealed that three studies had a strong impact on the association of within-hospital cardiovascular events between <b>iodixanol</b> and LOCM. Meta-regression analysis failed to account for heterogeneity. No publication bias was detected. ConclusionsThis meta-analysis demonstrates that there is no conclusive evidence that <b>iodixanol</b> is superior to LOCM overall with regard to fewer cardiovascular events...|$|E
40|$|Non-ionic, water-soluble, {{contrast}} media, iohexol and/or <b>iodixanol,</b> {{have been}} investigated for use in acrylic bone cement aimed for arthroplasty. Bone cement, containing the new particulate contrast media, was investigated for: quasi-static mechanical properties, water uptake properties, release of contrast media from the bone cement, biological responses from particulate bone cement, polymerisation reaction, polymerisation temperature, glass transition temperature, injectability and penetration into human cancellous bone, and radiopacity. The quasi-static mechanical properties of acrylic bone cement {{are influenced by the}} size and amount of contrast media in the bone cement; the particle size of <b>iodixanol</b> should be above 8 µm in order to have good mechanical properties. At a ratio of 8 wt%, good tensile strength is achieved while creating clear images on a standard X-ray. The molecular weight and glass transition temperature of the cement are not affected by the addition of iodixanol; however, <b>iodixanol</b> does lower the maximum polymerisation temperature. Both iohexol and <b>iodixanol</b> show better biocompatibility than conventional contrast medium; cement particles with <b>iodixanol</b> induce higher bone resorption in vitro than particles with iohexol, and there is a trend that particles with <b>iodixanol</b> show increased bone formation compared to particles with iohexol. The release of iohexol or <b>iodixanol</b> from wet bone cement does not result in a discernable radiolucent zone in the bone cement. The water uptake of cement containing iohexol is significantly higher than that of cement containing <b>iodixanol,</b> which shows higher water uptake than Palacos R. High viscosity cement (Palacos R) achieves better penetration into human cancellous bone in femoral heads than low viscosity cement (Osteopal). Cement containing <b>iodixanol</b> achieves higher bone cement penetration and injectability than low viscosity cement, but lower than Palacos R. The attenuation of X-rays in a contrast medium should be investigated in a standardised way using clinically relevant exposures. Therefore, the attenuation of bone cements (for use in hip- or knee- operations) should be investigated using an X-ray tube voltage of 70 ? 80 kV, with 0. 1 m of water as a soft tissue phantom.

40|$|<b>Iodixanol,</b> a new ratio 6 {{nonionic}} iodinated {{contrast agent}} with an osmolality equal to serum, was compared with iohexol in a randomized, double-blind, parallel study. Two hundred patients undergoing elective diagnostic cardiac angiography were randomized to <b>iodixanol</b> (n = 101) or iohexol (n = 99). There {{were no differences}} noted between the 2 agents in the mean changes in systolic or diastolic blood pressure or heart rate during or immediately after any angiography. However, significantly more patients had a decrease in diastolic Mood pressure of > 20 mm Hg during left coronary angiography with <b>iodixanol.</b> The only significant differences in any electrophysiologic parameter were slightly more PR prolongation during left coronary angiography with <b>iodixanol</b> and more ST-segment depression with iohexol during coronary angiography.

40|$|Background: Iodinated X-ray {{contrast}} media {{are the most}} commonly used contrastagents in the world with an annual application of 40 - 50 million. New non-ionic contrastagents are subdivided into low osmolar agents such as iopromide and iso-osmolaragents such as <b>iodixanol.</b> Regarding different biochemical characteristics, these agentsare different in the allergic reactions and contrast enhancement and final lesion conspicuity. Objectives: This study was carried out to compare allergic adverse effects and contrastenhancement between <b>iodixanol</b> and iopromide. Patients and Methods: One-hundred and twenty patients who were referred for abdominalCT scan to Besat Hospital were included in this study. Patients were randomly dividedinto two groups (A & B). Group A received 100 cc <b>iodixanol</b> (300 mgI/mL) and group B received 100 cc iopromide (300 mgI/ml) by power injector. CT examination was performedusing Helical CT Scanner (Somatom, Siemens, Germany). Sixty seconds after injection,images were obtained and enhancement of port, liver and aorta were determined. Allergicadverse effects were recorded one hour and up to one week after injection. Results: <b>Iodixanol</b> produced a significantly greater enhancement of the hepatic, aortaand portal vein than iopromide (P < 0. 01).

This {{study investigated the}} effects of low- vs iso-osmolar contrast medium (CM) exposure on NADPH-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by tubular cells. X-ray attenuation of iohexol, iopamidol, and <b>iodixanol</b> was assessed at equimolar iodine concentrations and their effects on human renal proximal tubular cells (PTCs) were evaluated with equally attenuating solutions of each CM. Cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and necrosis were investigated by trypan blue exclusion, MTT assay, and annexin V/propidium iodide assay, respectively. ROS production was assessed by DCF assay, NADPH oxidase activity by the lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence method, and Nox 4 expression by immunoblot. Yielding the same X-ray attenuation, CM cytotoxicity was assessed in PTCs at equimolar iodine concentrations. More necrosis was present after incubation with iohexol and iopamidol than after incubation with equal concentrations of <b>iodixanol.</b> Iohexol and <b>iodixanol</b> at low iodine concentrations induced less cytotoxicity than iopamidol. Moreover, both iohexol and iopamidol induced more apoptosis than <b>iodixanol,</b> with a dose-dependent effect. ROS generation was significantly higher with iopamidol and iohexol compared to <b>iodixanol.</b> NADPH oxidase activity and Nox 4 protein expression significantly increased after exposure to iopamidol and iohexol, with a dose-dependent effect, compared with <b>iodixanol.</b> CM-induced Nox 4 expression and activity depended upon Src activation. In conclusion, at angiographic concentrations, <b>iodixanol</b> induces fewer cytotoxic effects on cultured tubular cells than iohexol and iopamidol along with a lower induction of Nox 4 -dependent ROS generation.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Solutions {{of iodine}} {{contrast}} media (CM) used for selective coronary arteriography (CA) should have minimal propensity to cause ventricular fibrillation (VF). Commonly used CM for CA are nonionic monomers or dimers. PURPOSE: To compare VF propensity of ready-to-use solutions of one nonionic dimer, <b>iodixanol,</b> and five nonionic monomers, iobitridol, iopamidol, iomeprol, iopromide, and ioversol. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty milliliters of each CM was {{injected into the}} left coronary artery (LCA) through an inflated balloon catheter (0. 5 ml/s) in 14 pigs; the longest period of injection was 40 s. If VF occurred before 40 s, the injection was stopped and the heart was defibrillated. After VF, there was a delay of 40 min before the next injection. Hemodynamic parameters and vector electrocardiography (VECG) were monitored. A CM with a lower frequency of VF and a longer period between start of injection and start of VF was considered to have a lower VF propensity. RESULTS: Following 14 injections, {{each of the five}} nonionic monomers caused 14 VF, whereas <b>iodixanol</b> caused three VF (P< 0. 01). When VF occurred after <b>iodixanol,</b> it occurred later than after the other CM (P< 0. 001). <b>Iodixanol</b> caused less prolongation in QRS time (P< 0. 01) and QTc time (P< 0. 05) than the other CM. Prolongations in QRS and QTc times caused by CM parallel the VF propensities of the CM. CONCLUSION: Ready-to-use solutions of the dimer <b>iodixanol</b> have lower VF propensity than solutions of the five monomeric CM.

40|$|To {{develop an}} {{expedient}} procedure for estimating glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in conscious mice, we first established a simple technique for repeated blood collections from the tail vein using a microcapillary tube {{attached to a}} 24 -gauge needle without the hub. Then, we devised a definition equation for estimation of the GFR using the contrast medium <b>iodixanol</b> as a test tracer. <b>Iodixanol</b> was administered as a bolus injection at 1500 mg I/kg to ddY mice, and the GFR {{was determined by the}} conventional multisample strategy. Based on cumulative data from the multisample method, an equation for the single-blood-sample method including the <b>iodixanol</b> dose, estimated distribution volume (Vd), and plasma <b>iodixanol</b> concentration at 60 min later was sought. The GFR values from the multisample method were in good agreement with those calculated using the equation. In clinically healthy mice, the GFR decreased gradually with ages from 11 weeks old in both sexes, suggesting the necessity of the corresponding control in each protocol. In nephropathy mice induced by cisplatin, the GFR values decreased with rises in serum BUN and creatinine concentrations, and serum creatinine became elevated when the GFR decreased to approximately 70 % of the basal value. The results suggest that the simplified equation using <b>iodixanol,</b> allowing for the repeated use of the same mice, is a versatile procedure for research purposes...|$|E

30|$|More {{insight on}} the medullar microvasculature {{response}} to CM {{has been given}} by Sendeski et al. [34]. The average DVR diameter is 12 - 18  μm, close {{to that of a}} red blood cell. On isolated rat DVRs, it was shown that micro-perfusion with <b>Iodixanol</b> leads to a diameter reduction of 48  %. This was due to a decreased NO production and an increase reactivity of DVR to angiotensin II.

BackgroundThe properties of iodinated CM might contribute to the incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). MethodsPatients with renal impairment undergoing coronary angiography {{were randomly assigned to}} <b>iodixanol</b> (n = 72) or ioxaglate (n = 74). ResultsBaseline characteristics were well-matched between the 2 groups. The predicted risk score for CIN was similar in the <b>iodixanol</b> and in the ioxaglate groups (11. 9 ± 4. 1 vs. 11. 8 ± 4. 1), as was the use of N-acetylcysteine (70 % vs. 73 %). The primary end point of the study, median peak increase of serum creatinine from day 0 through day 3 after angiography, did not differ between the <b>iodixanol</b> (0. 09 mg/dl; interquartile range 0. 00 to 0. 30 mg/dl) and the ioxaglate (0. 15 mg/dl; interquartile range 0. 00 to 0. 40 mg/dl; p = 0. 07) groups. The percentages of patients with a peak increase of serum creatinine ≥ 0. 5 mg/dl (15. 9 % in <b>iodixanol</b> vs. 18. 2 % in ioxaglate), ≥ 1. 0 mg/dl (1. 4 % vs. 4. 5 %), and ≥ 25 % or ≥ 0. 5 mg/dl (15. 9 % vs. 24. 2 %, respectively) also did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. ConclusionsIn high-risk patients undergoing coronary angiographic procedures, use of the nonionic iso-osmolar CM <b>iodixanol</b> does not reduce renal deterioration in patients with renal impairment, compared with the ionic low-osmolar CM ioxaglate. Given that the study was underpowered to compare nephrotoxicity of the 2 groups under the active medical protection of CIN, a larger randomized study is warranted that will enroll patients with higher risks of CIN under a strict control of hydration regimens and adjunctive medications...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{sought to}} compare the {{nephrotoxicity}} of <b>iodixanol</b> and ioxaglate in patients with renal impairment undergoing coronary angiography. BackgroundIodixanol, a nonionic, dimeric, iso-osmolar contrast medium (IOCM), may be less nephrotoxic than low-osmolar contrast media (LOCM) in high-risk patients. MethodsIn a prospective, randomized trial in 300 adults with creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≤ 60 ml/min, patients received either <b>iodixanol</b> or ioxaglate and underwent coronary angiography with or without percutaneous coronary intervention. The primary end point was the incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) (an increase in serum creatinine [SCr] ≥ 25 % or ≥ 0. 5 mg/dl [≥ 44. 2 μmol/l]). The incidence of CIN in patients with severe renal impairment at baseline (CrCl < 30 ml/min) or diabetes and in those receiving large doses (≥ 140 ml) of contrast medium was also determined. ResultsThe incidence of CIN was significantly lower with <b>iodixanol</b> (7. 9 %) than with ioxaglate (17. 0 %; p = 0. 021), corresponding to an odds ratio (OR) of CIN of 0. 415 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 194 to 0. 889) for <b>iodixanol.</b> The incidence of CIN was also significantly lower with <b>iodixanol</b> in patients with severe renal impairment (p = 0. 023) or concomitant diabetes (p = 0. 041), or in patients given ≥ 140 ml of contrast media (p = 0. 038). Multivariate analysis identified use of ioxaglate (OR 2. 65, 95 % CI 1. 11 to 6. 33, p = 0. 028), baseline SCr, mg/dl (OR 2. 0, 95 % CI 1. 04 to 3. 85, p = 0. 038), and left ventricular ejection fraction, % (OR 0. 97, 95 % CI 0. 94 to 0. 99, p = 0. 019) as independent risk factors for CIN.

BackgroundRecent {{data support}} that <b>iodixanol,</b> an iso-osmolality contrast agent, is less nephrotoxic than low-osmolality contrast agents when hydration {{is the only}} prophylactic strategy used. We evaluated the nephrotoxicity of iso- and low-osmolality contrast agents with prophylactic administration of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) along with hydration. MethodsTwo hundred and twenty-five patients with chronic renal insufficiency (serum creatinine > 1. 5 mg/dL or an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2), referred to our institution for coronary and/or peripheral procedures, were assigned to receive low-osmolality (iobitridol group; N = 115) or iso-osmolality (<b>iodixanol</b> group; N = 110) contrast dye. In all cases prophylactic administration of 0. 45 % saline intravenously and NAC (1200 mg orally twice daily) was used. ResultsBaseline creatinine levels were similar in the 2 groups [iobitridol group = 1. 70 (IQR: 1. 54 - 1. 98) mg/dL; <b>iodixanol</b> group = 1. 73 (IQR: 1. 56 - 2. 00) mg/dL, P = 0. 33]. The risk score for contrast nephrotoxicity was 5. 0 ± 1. 6 in the iobitridol group versus 5. 0 ± 1. 8 in the <b>iodixanol</b> group (P = 0. 44). Increase of at least 0. 5 mg/dL of the creatinine concentration 48 hours after the procedure occurred in 4 / 115 patients (3. 5 %) in the iobitridol group and 3 / 110 patients (2. 7 %) in the <b>iodixanol</b> group (P = 1. 00; OR 0. 78; 95 % CI 0. 17 - 3. 56).

40|$|We {{have used}} {{isolated}} arterial preparations from the rabbit and dog {{to investigate whether}} non-ionic iodinated radiographic contrast media (IRCM) modulate nitric oxide (NO) release. The tri-iodinated monomers iopromide and iohexol were compared with the hexa-iodinated dimer <b>iodixanol.</b> The vasodilator effects of iohexol (300 [*]mg[*]ml− 1) and <b>iodixanol</b> (320 [*]mg[*]ml− 1) were assessed in cascade bioassay. Increasing concentrations of iohexol or <b>iodixanol</b> caused concentration-dependent relaxations of the detector tissue which were insensitive to 100 [*]μM NG-nitro L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) and 10 [*]μM indomethacin, whereas viscosity-associated relaxations induced by the ‘inert' agent dextran (MW 80, 000; 1 – 4 %) were attenuated by inhibition of NO synthesis. Relaxations of endothelium-intact rings to acetylcholine (ACh) were attenuated by preincubation with iohexol or <b>iodixanol,</b> whereas relaxations to sodium nitroprusside (SNP) in endothelium-denuded rings were unaffected. Inhibitory activity did not correlate with either molarity or iodine concentration. Mannitol caused inhibition of both ACh- and SNP-induced responses. In isolated perfused arteries the depressor responses to <b>iodixanol</b> (320 [*]mg[*]ml− 1) and iopromide (300 [*]mg[*]ml− 1) administered as close arterial bolus attained a plateau with maximal dilatations of ∼ 25 % and ∼ 60 %, respectively. Addition of 100 [*]μM NG-nitro L-arginine (L-NOARG) and/or 10 [*]μM indomethacin to the perfusate {{had no effect on}} the responses to either agent. We conclude that IRCM exert direct effects on the endothelium that inhibit NO production rather than its action on vascular smooth muscle. Shear stress-induced stimulation of NO production by IRCM is unlikely to contribute to their vasodilator activity in vivo when administered during angiography despite high intrinsic viscosity...|$|E
40|$|Aims: Goals of {{the study}} were the {{assessment}} of the correlation between flow-dependent and contrast-related vasodilatation, comparison of <b>iodixanol</b> to iopromide and evaluation of the impact of plaque on vasodilatation in coronary arteries. The action of <b>iodixanol</b> and iopromide on the vascular wall did not differ and was equal to local flow-dependent vasodilatation induced by a saline bolus (correlation 0 · 95 – 0 · 98). The increase in local luminal area after injection ofIntroduction Endothelial function is commonly tested by assessing diameter changes after application of endothelium-dependent vasoactive substances or flow increase[1]. The resulting local changes of diameter or area are assessed by intra-vascular ultrasound or more often quantitative coronary angiography[2, 3]. Quantitative coronary angi-ography allows the evaluation of several different vascular segments. For quantitative coronary angiogra-phy, however, contrast agents have to be used and these are known to act on the vascular wall by themselves[4 – 7]. Isotonic <b>iodixanol</b> is a recently devel-oped contrast agent that demonstrated a reduced effect on blood flow in peripheral vessels as compared to other contrast agents[8 – 10]. A recent angiographic study in coronary arteries demonstrated a minor endothelium-dependent effect of isotonic <b>iodixanol</b> and iopromide on large coronary arteries[11]. The study was not intra-vascular ultrasound controlled, however. In a small additional methodological intra-vascular ultra-sound study presented in this paper to assess the time course of vasodilatation following application of <b>iodixanol,</b> an immediate increase in luminal diameter in normal coronary segments with a peak at 40 s could be demonstrated[11].

The aim {{of the present study}} was to assess the resistive index (RI) changes of renal segmental artery in color Doppler duplex sonography after injection of two different contrast mediums: <b>iodixanol</b> and iohexol. The RI of the renal segmental artery of 62 randomly chosen patients, with a normal baseline renal function, was calculated using color-coded Doppler sonography before and five minutes after bolus injection of two different contrast mediums. Thirty-one patients were administered 50 mL of <b>iodixanol</b> (Visipaque) and 31 patients were admi-nistered 50 mL of iohexol (Omnipaque) during intravenous urogram procedures.

40|$|Objective: The aims of {{this work}} were to study, by means of dynamic vectorcardiography (VCG), the {{electrophysiological}} effects of contrast media (CM) injected into the coronary arteries and to evaluate which VCG variables are most suitable for comparing different CM. We also studied if CM-induced VCG changes differ from those seen after myocardial ischaemia. The clinical significance of the VCG changes was evaluated by comparing the frequency of cardiac adverse events (CAE) during cardioangiography in an unselected patient population. Methods: The VCG recordings were carried out using the MIDA 1000 system. This system provides on-line information about changes in the different phases of the ECG-complex by means of continuously calculated VCG variables, such as QRS-vd, QRSC-va, STC-vm and TC-vm. This technique was used in three coronary angiography studies where changes induced by CM (iohexol, iohexol/Na, <b>iodixanol</b> and ioxaglate) were analysed and compared. In another study CM related changes (iohexol) were compared with those from acetated Ringer injections and ischaemia during percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. The clinical relevance of the VCG changes induced by iohexol and <b>iodixanol</b> was assessed by registering the frequency of CAE up to 24 hours after cardioangiography {{in a total of}} 1020 patients receiving either of these two CM. Results: All CM induced changes in several VCG variables, in particular QRS-vd, QRSC-va and TC-vm were affected. <b>Iodixanol</b> caused significantly less VCG changes than both iohexol and ioxaglate. Ioxaglate induced the largest relative change in TC-vm. QRS-vd was more affected by iohexol injections in the left coronary artery than by ischaemia in the left anterior descending artery, while ischaemia induced the largest change in STC-vm. Both iohexol and <b>iodixanol</b> were well tolerated when used in an unselected patient population, but there was a trend that <b>iodixanol</b> induced fewer CAE. Conclusions: Dynamic vectorcardiography makes it easy to follow and quantitate CM induced electrophysiological changes. QRS-vd, QRSC-va and TC-vm seem best suited to monitor CM effects.
