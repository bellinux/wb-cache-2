5|$|After {{graduation}} from university, Thorne-Begland {{served in a}} jet combat squadron of the United States Navy. During the 1992 presidential campaign, he appeared on the television news program Nightline to criticize the Navy's policy of excluding homosexuals, identified himself as gay, and was honorably discharged <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>service.</b> As {{a result of the}} appeal processes, Thorne-Begland became interested in the law and obtained a law degree.|$|E
5|$|After the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) began a {{criminal}} inquiry, further autopsies indicated that Tomlinson {{had died from}} internal bleeding caused by blunt force trauma to the abdomen, in association with cirrhosis of the liver. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided not to charge Harwood, because the disagreement {{between the first and}} later pathologists meant they could not show a causal link between the death and alleged assault. That position changed in 2011; after the verdict of unlawful killing, the CPS charged Harwood with manslaughter. He was acquitted in 2012 and dismissed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> a few months later.|$|E

5|$|Grant played football, basketball, and {{baseball}} at Superior Central High School (Wisconsin). He {{graduated from high}} school in 1945 and enlisted in the Navy during World War II. He was assigned to the Great Lakes Naval Training Station in Illinois and played on the football team coached by Paul Brown. Using an acceptance letter from the University of Wisconsin–Madison to be discharged <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>service,</b> Grant decided to attend the University of Minnesota instead. He was a three-sport, nine-letterman athlete in football, basketball, {{and baseball}} for the Minnesota Golden Gophers, earning All-Big Ten honors in football twice.|$|E
5|$|His second {{assignment}} was to Shanghai, where he officially served as vice-consul between 10 December 1931 and 9 January 1932, though a two-month temporary detail {{kept him in}} the city long enough to witness the Shanghai Incident firsthand. After that he was stationed in Fuzhou up to his resignation <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> on 1 March 1933.|$|E
5|$|It {{was about}} this time that an {{incident}} occurred that temporarily clouded his career. In a moment of anger he struck one of the Thalias lieutenants, Robert Forbes. He was brought to court-martial on 12 June 1798 aboard , and the offence being proved, the court {{had no choice but}} to dismiss him <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>service.</b> In view of the mitigating circumstances, the court recommended that Paulet be considered for clemency by King George III. The King was pleased to follow the recommendation and reinstated Paulet in the service.|$|E

5|$|O'Leary {{was born}} in 1890, one of four {{children}} of Daniel and Margaret O'Leary, who owned a farm at Inchigeela, near Macroom in County Cork, Ireland. Daniel O'Leary was a fervent Irish nationalist and keen sportsman who participated in competitive weightlifting and football. Aged 16 and unwilling {{to continue to work}} on his parent's land, Michael O'Leary joined the Royal Navy, serving at the shore establishment HMS Vivid at Devonport for several years until rheumatism in his knees forced his departure <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>service.</b> Within a few months however, O'Leary had again tired of the farm and joined the Irish Guards regiment of the British Army.|$|E
5|$|After {{the battle}} the British forces under general Pritzler pursued the Peshwa, who fled southwards towards Karnataka with the Raja of Satara. The Peshwa {{continued}} his flight southward throughout {{the month of}} January. Not receiving support from the Raja of Mysore, the Peshwa doubled back and passed General Pritzler to head towards Solapur. Until 29 January {{the pursuit of the}} Peshwa had not been productive. Whenever Baji Rao was pressed by the British, Gokhale and his light troops hovered around the Peshwa and fired long shots. Some skirmishes took place, and the Marathas were frequently hit by shells from the horse artillery. There was, however, no advantageous result to either party. On 7 February General Smith entered Satara and captured the royal palace of the Marathas. He symbolically raised the British flag. The next day, the Bhagwa Zenda —the flag of Shivaji and the Marathas— was raised in its place. To gain the support of the population, the British declared that they would not interfere with the tenets of any religion. They announced that all Watans, Inams, pensions, and annual allowances would be continued provided that the recipients withdrew <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> of Baji Rao. During this time Baji Rao remained in the vicinity of Solapur.|$|E

5|$|Braathens SAFE {{started as}} a charter airline, flying {{predominantly}} to the Far East and South America. In 1949, the airline was granted a concession on the Far East route that was flown until 1954, using Douglas DC-4s. The main airport in Norway was Oslo Airport, Fornebu, and the main technical base was at Stavanger Airport, Sola. From 1952 to 1960, the airline cooperated on flights to Reykjavík with the Icelandic airline Loftleidir. Braathens SAFE started domestic services in 1951, using de Havilland Herons on a route from Oslo via Tønsberg to Stavanger. Services from Oslo to Trondheim were introduced in 1953. This was supplemented with stops in Farsund and Kristiansand in 1955, and Hamar, Røros and Notodden the following year. However, with the delivery of the Fokker F-27s, many of the smaller airports were cut <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>service.</b> The airline started flying from Oslo to Ålesund and along the West Coast in 1958. During 1960, the airline flew a single season to Sandefjord and Aalborg, Denmark. Services to Bodø and Tromsø started in 1967, and Boeing 737-200s and Fokker F-28s were taken into use two years later. Kristiansund was added as a destination in 1970 and Molde two years later. The F-28s were retired in 1986, while services to Longyearbyen started the following year.|$|E
5|$|By 1945, Roane-Anderson was {{divesting}} {{itself of}} many of its tasks. American Industrial Transit took over the transport system, and Southern Bell the telephone system. Tri-State Homes began managing housing. In 1946, tenants were permitted to paint their houses in different colors from the wartime olive drab. Comprehensive medical insurance, originally instituted for security reasons, was replaced with policies from the Provident Life and Accident Insurance Company. Health care had been provided by the Army. As Army doctors were separated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> they were replaced with civilian doctors employed by Roane-Anderson. The dental service was transferred to civilians in February 1946, and private medical practices were permitted at Oak Ridge from 1 March 1946 on.|$|E
5|$|In their off-duty hours, SPARS contributed {{time and}} effort to many {{community}} and wartime causes. Some became active nurse's aides, some rolled bandages for the Red Cross, others donated blood to blood banks, some visited service men in convalescent hospitals, and others collected gifts for the men overseas. Many of them were also involved in the March of Dimes campaigns, and war chest and war bond drives. Both officers and enlisted were awarded ribbons and medals based on their service, and some were acknowledged for their outstanding contributions to the SPARS and the country. In general, SPARS looked upon their service favorably, and many of them found a form of kinship in having {{been a part of the}} nation's military forces during wartime. With the surrender of Japan in August 1945, the USCG demobilization effort began, and the SPARS were gradually discharged. They were separated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> on a point system, and on the basis of their jobs. However, many SPARS were reassigned to the personnel separation centers to help with demobilization (women and men reservists) and they were not separated until it was completed. The Women's Reserve of the USCG (SPARS) was inactivated on 25 July 1947.|$|E

5|$|Kaul sent informers {{to spy on}} Manekshaw {{and based}} on the {{information}} gained, Manekshaw was charged and a court of inquiry was ordered. Meanwhile, two of his juniors—Harbaksh Singh and Moti Sagar—were promoted to lieutenant general and appointed as corps commanders. This incident resulted in the widespread implication that Manekshaw had almost been dismissed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>service.</b> The court, presided over by the then-GOC-in-C Western Command, Lieutenant General Daulet Singh, known for his integrity, exonerated Manekshaw. Before a formal 'no case to answer' could be announced, war with China broke out. But due to the court proceedings, Manekshaw did not see any action during the war. During this war, the Indian Army faced a debacle, and many knew that Kaul and Menon were primarily responsible for the failure. Both were sacked immediately. In November 1962, Nehru asked Manekshaw to take over the command of IV Corps. Manekshaw told Nehru that the action against him was a conspiracy, and that his promotion had been due for almost eighteen months. Nehru apologized, promoted Manekshaw to lieutenant general, and he moved to Tezpur to take over as the GOC IV Corps.|$|E
5|$|Returning to naval service {{some months}} after the action, Harvey was given the 80-gun HMS Tonnant as his first flagship, in which he {{remained}} until 1809. Serving under Lord Gambier in the Channel Fleet, Harvey was outraged not to be given command of the British ships in action at the Battle of Basque Roads. Harvey expressed his disgust that command {{had been given to}} the more junior Lord Cochrane in no uncertain terms to Gambier, and was dismissed from the admiral's council as a result. When the operation was initially successful, Gambier refused to support Cochrane and as a result an opportunity to annihilate the French Atlantic Fleet was lost. The ensuing dispute lasted years and involved a court martial that eventually acquitted Gambier, and only ended with Cochrane's dismissal <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> five years later.|$|E
5|$|The Command was too {{expensive}} to maintain and cost cuts were made during the 1950s which caused a reduction in strength. By mid-1957 the Command had been cut to 82 aircraft. By mid-1958 it had shrunk to just 67. The Shackletons dominated {{the core of this}} force, numbering 54 aircraft. The Neptune was cut <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> altogether, beginning on 31 August 1956. There was little operational action for the Command at this point. It airlifted British Army forces into Egypt during the Suez Crisis which was its major action during this period. The lack of funds and any active conventional military role saw the Command struggle to keep its front-line strength high. There was a brief alert in October 1962, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, when all six squadrons it then possessed were put on high alert, but nothing came of the crisis, although the Shackleton squadrons at RAF Ballykelly were sent to Macrihanish as it was known that Ballykelly was on the Soviet IRBM target list.|$|E

The new Jam mode lets the players select one of several standard pre-set rhythms and then play along with it on the instrument controllers in a free-form mode; however, players can then capture any segment of this music and move it to the Mix mode to compile a song. User songs are then uploaded and downloaded through the GHTunes mode of the Music Studio. While songs that violate copyright will still be removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>service,</b> Neversoft will be less aggressive about this and will rely more on user feedback on such issues.

5|$|The Worcestershire County Air Ambulance, {{which has}} been {{operating}} since 1991, moved to the Strensham site in 1998 under a sponsorship deal with Take a Break, who were operating the service area at the time. Access to the air ambulance site can be made <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> station itself or from the local road network via the staff entrance to the services. An open day is held at the site each year {{to raise money for}} the operation of the air ambulance. In May 2008 the operational hours of the service was increased from 12 to 14 hours each day, as a result of this, landing lights needed to be installed at the base to enable night time use.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} had notable {{effects on the}} navies of both Britain and France. The French did not directly contest British supremacy in Northern European waters again, spending most of the next 23 years in Brest and other ports, their few major sallies mainly directed at the Mediterranean. Continued upheavals in the French Navy resulted in a decline of quality in its officer corps, {{so that by the}} Battle of Trafalgar 11 years later the port-bound nature of the French fleet had resulted in a cautious and inexperienced tactical outlook. In Britain, the battle created a division within the Royal Navy's officer corps. Howe's dispatch after the battle criticised some officers who he believed had hesitated in action, and those officers received none of the honours distributed {{at the end of the}} campaign. Fallout from this dispute was widespread, with several senior figures resigning in disgust. Captain Molloy of HMS Caesar was ultimately court-martialled and dismissed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> for failing to support his admiral.|$|E
