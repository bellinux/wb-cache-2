5|$|Rubidium, like {{sodium and}} potassium, almost always has +1 {{oxidation}} state when dissolved in water, even in biological contexts. The human body tends to treat Rb+ ions {{as if they}} were potassium ions, and therefore concentrates rubidium in the body's <b>intracellular</b> <b>fluid</b> (i.e., inside cells). The ions are not particularly toxic; a 70kg person contains on average 0.36g of rubidium, and an increase in this value by 50 to 100 times did not show negative effects in test persons. The biological half-life of rubidium in humans measures 31–46days. Although a partial substitution of potassium by rubidium is possible, when more than 50% of the potassium in the muscle tissue of rats was replaced with rubidium, the rats died.|$|E

25|$|The {{formation}} of an outside-out patch begins with a whole-cell recording configuration. After the whole-cell configuration is formed, the electrode is slowly withdrawn from the cell, allowing a bulb of membrane to bleb out from the cell. When the electrode is pulled far enough away, this bleb will detach from the cell and reform as a convex membrane {{on the end of}} the electrode (like a ball open at the electrode tip), with the original outside of the membrane facing outward from the electrode. As the image at the right shows, this means that the fluid inside the pipette will be simulating the <b>intracellular</b> <b>fluid,</b> while a researcher is free to move the pipette and the bleb with its channels to another bath of solution. While multiple channels can exist in a bleb of membrane, single channel recordings are also possible in this conformation if the bleb of detached membrane is small and only contains one channel.|$|E

When amphetamine enters a neuron and interacts with VMAT2, the transporter reverses its direction of transport, thereby releasing stored monoamines inside synaptic vesicles back into the neuron's <b>intracellular</b> <b>fluid.</b> Meanwhile, when amphetamine activates , the receptor causes the neuron's cell membrane-bound monoamine transporters (i.e., the dopamine transporter, norepinephrine transporter, or serotonin transporter) to either stop transporting monoamines altogether (via transporter internalization) or transport monoamines out of the neuron; in other words, the reversed membrane transporter will push dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin out of the neuron's <b>intracellular</b> <b>fluid</b> and into the synaptic cleft. [...] In summary, by interacting with both VMAT2 and TAAR1, amphetamine releases neurotransmitters from synaptic vesicles (the effect from VMAT2) into the <b>intracellular</b> <b>fluid</b> where they subsequently exit the neuron through the membrane-bound, reversed monoamine transporters (the effect from TAAR1).|$|E

Studies in the brine shrimp have examined how water affects cell functions; these saw that a 20% reduction in the amount of water in a cell inhibits metabolism, with metabolism decreasing progressively as the cell dries out and all metabolic activity halting when the water level reaches 70% below normal.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{have used}} {{fluorescence}} correlation spectroscopy to determine the anomalous diffusion properties of fluorescently tagged gold beads in the cytoplasm and the nucleus of living cells. From the extracted mean-square displacement v(τ) ∼τα, we have determined the complex shear modulus G(ω) ∼ωα for both compartments. Without treatment, all tested cell lines showed a strong viscoelastic behavior of the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm, highlighting the crowdedness of these <b>intracellular</b> <b>fluids.</b> We also found a similar viscoelastic response in frog egg extract, which tended toward a solely viscous behavior upon dilution. When cells were osmotically stressed, the diffusion became less anomalous and the viscoelastic response changed. In particular, the anomality changed from α≈ 0. 55 to α≈ 0. 66, which indicates that the Zimm model for polymer solutions under varying solvent conditions is a good empirical description of the material properties of the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm. Since osmotic stress may eventually trigger cell death, we propose, {{on the basis of}} our observations, that <b>intracellular</b> <b>fluids</b> are maintained in a state similar to crowded polymer solutions under good solvent conditions to keep the cell viable...|$|R

2500|$|For a neuron at rest, {{there is}} a high {{concentration}} of sodium and chlorine ions in the extracellular fluid compared to the <b>intracellular</b> <b>fluid</b> while {{there is a}} high concentration of potassium ions in the <b>intracellular</b> <b>fluid</b> compared to the extracellular fluid. This concentration gradient along with potassium leak channels present on the membrane of the neuron causes an [...] of potassium ions making the resting potential close to EK≈–75mV. The depolarization opens both the sodium and potassium channels in the membrane, allowing the ions to flow {{into and out of the}} axon, respectively. [...] If the depolarization is small (say, increasing Vm from −70mV to −60mV), the outward potassium current overwhelms the inward sodium current and the membrane repolarizes back to its normal resting potential around −70mV.However, if the depolarization is large enough, the inward sodium current increases more than the outward potassium current and a runaway condition (positive feedback) results: the more inward current there is, the more Vm increases, which in turn further increases the inward current. A sufficiently strong depolarization (increase in Vm) causes the voltage-sensitive sodium channels to open; the increasing permeability to sodium drives Vm closer to the sodium equilibrium voltage ENa≈ +55mV. [...] The increasing voltage in turn causes even more sodium channels to open, which pushes Vm still further towards ENa. [...] This positive feedback continues until the [...] sodium channels are fully open and Vm is close to ENa. The sharp rise in Vm and sodium permeability correspond to the rising phase of the action potential.|$|E

40|$|In {{the first}} part of this thesis {{diffusion}} measurements with fluorescence correlation spectroscopy on fluorescence-labeled nanogold particles in the cytoplasm and the nucleus of living cells are presented. The nanoparticles were detected to move by subdiffusion, i. e. their mean square displacement displayed a power-law scaling ~ t^a, a < 1. This observation can be explained with the high amounts of macromolecules (such as proteins) dissolved in <b>intracellular</b> <b>fluids</b> which obstruct the motion of indiviual nanoparticles. From the diffusion behaviour of the particles the complex shear modulus G(w) ~ w^a of the <b>intracellular</b> <b>fluids</b> was calculated, which showed the cellular interior to be viscoelastic on the nanoscale. Furthermore, the efficiency of a subdiffusive molecule to approach a fixed target was quantified. Computer simulations highlighted here that the probability to reach a target is increased for a subdiffusive particle as compared to a normal diffusive particle, which suggests that a cell may benefit from the subdiffusion of macromolecules in its interior. In the second part of the thesis the two-dimensional diffusion of cylindrical objects embedded in lipid membranes is investigated. Coarse-grained molecular dynamic simulations ('dissipative particle dynamics') demonstrated that the size-dependence of the diffusion coefficients is properly described by the Saffman-Delbrück theory...|$|R

30|$|In marine fish, the {{activation}} of axoneme {{is achieved by}} different mechanisms. In sea bass and tuna spermatozoa, the key factor to start the beating of the flagella is the variation of ionic strength (Alavi and Cosson [2006]; Cosson et al. [2008 a]). In particular, Cosson et al. ([2008 a]) proposed the following model. The water efflux due to the hyperosmotic shock could cause a local membrane distortion that activates SAC. The activation of the SAC could lead to {{the activation}} of water channels resulting in rapid release of water from the cells. The result of this process would increase the ionic strength of <b>intracellular</b> <b>fluids</b> leading to the activation of dynein.

50|$|Calcium {{metabolism}} {{refers to}} all the movements (and how they are regulated) of calcium atoms and ions {{into and out of}} various body compartments, such as the gut, the blood plasma, the interstitial fluids which bathe the cells in the body, the <b>intracellular</b> <b>fluids,</b> and bone. An important aspect, or component, of calcium metabolism is plasma calcium homeostasis, which describes the mechanisms whereby the concentration of calcium ions in the blood plasma is kept within very narrow limits. Derangements of this mechanism lead to hypercalcemia or hypocalcemia, both of which can have important consequences for health. In humans, when the blood plasma ionized calcium level rises above its set point, the thyroid gland releases calcitonin, causing the plasma ionized calcium level to return to normal. When it falls below that set point, the parathyroid glands release parathyroid hormone (PTH), causing the plasma calcium level to rise.|$|R
50|$|Once a drug {{enters into}} {{systemic}} circulation by absorption or direct administration, {{it must be}} distributed into interstitial and <b>intracellular</b> <b>fluids.</b> Each organ or tissue can receive different doses of the drug and the drug can remain in the different organs or tissues for a varying amount of time. The distribution of a drug between tissues is dependent on vascular permeability, regional blood flow, cardiac output and perfusion rate of the tissue {{and the ability of}} the drug to bind tissue and plasma proteins and its lipid solubility. pH partition plays a major role as well. The drug is easily distributed in highly perfused organs such as the liver, heart and kidney. It is distributed in small quantities through less perfused tissues like muscle, fat and peripheral organs. The drug can be moved from the plasma to the tissue until the equilibrium is established (for unbound drug present in plasma).|$|R
