40|$|This {{article is}} in keeping with the optimum {{currency}} areas theory. Its main goal is to show how the <b>international</b> <b>migrations,</b> which occurred before the First World War, made the adjustment easier in the countries that opted for linking up their currency with gold. Actually, mass migrations during the ¿classical¿ Gold Standard period, albeit primarily induced by long-term factors, registered fluctuations that frequently correspond to variations in economic activity and unemployment rates. Therefore, <b>international</b> <b>migrations</b> probably contributed to the good running of Gold Standard. ...|$|R

One traces initially {{the main trends of}} the migratory movements in the world for next the decades and analysis is made on the two principal phenomena which will have an important impact on the welfare of the populations of the countries of origin: sending of remittances and emigration of highly qualified manpower.

25|$|National and <b>international</b> <b>migration</b> {{into the}} city has a long history. In 1685, {{following}} the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in France, the city responded with the Edict of Potsdam, which guaranteed religious freedom and tax-free status to French Huguenot refugees for ten years. The Greater Berlin Act in 1920 incorporated many suburbs and surrounding cities of Berlin. It formed most of the territory that comprises modern Berlin and increased the population from 1.9million to 4million.|$|E

25|$|Israel's net <b>international</b> <b>migration</b> {{balance and}} the total {{immigration}} between 1948 and 1994 was 80 per cent, pointing to a missing share, i.e., a ratio of immigrants to emigrants, of 20 percent. Historically, Israel's long term migration retention ratio of 80 per cent {{is much higher than}} other countries' receiving large masses of immigration such as the United States, Argentina, Brazil, Australia and New Zealand. Sergio DellaPergola attributes Israel's comparatively high migration retention to two related factors. The family transfer character of Aliyah, that is the relocation of entire households, including women, children and elderly members, implies abandonment of the place of origin. The second factor was the impossibility of return to countries where perceived discrimination or actual persecutions were among the main motivating factors for leaving.|$|E

25|$|However, {{in regions}} where certain classes of workers are {{restricted}} {{to this type of}} work or there are contributing regional conditions - for example, high unemployment, adjacent to regions with high poverty, or the recipient of driven labor migration - there will be workers willing to accept lower than equilibrium wages and then these jobs are not well paid. Large scale international labor migration, from developing to developed countries since the late 19th century and early 20th century has provided a pool of migrants willing to undertake employment for lower wages than native residents. Higher wages in developed countries are a strong 'pull' factor in <b>international</b> <b>migration,</b> and thus while a migrant worker is willing to accept a comparatively low-wage for a 3D job in a developed country it may mean a significant increase in wages compared to their originating country.|$|E
25|$|Doctors, too, {{have changed}} professions {{and joined the}} {{international}} mobility trend. Filipino doctors have begun leaving their professions to train as nurses under the title MD-RN {{with the hope of}} immigrating to the U.S. or other developed nations more easily. Since 2000, 3,500 Filipino doctors have migrated abroad as nurses. The U.S. incentives for nurse migration encourage doctors to train as nurses in the hopes of increasing their economic prospects. As a result, the Philippines have a lower average of doctors and nurses with 0.58 and 1.69 respectively for a population of 1,000. The average statistics globally in contrast are 1.23 and 2.56. Between 2002 and 2007, 1,000 Filipino hospitals closed due to a shortage of health workers. A study conducted by the former Philippine Secretary of Health, Jaime Galvez-Tan, concluded that close to 80% of government doctors have become nurses or are studying nursing. Of the 9,000 doctors-turned-nurses, 5,000 are working overseas. The extraordinary influence of this <b>international</b> <b>migration</b> has had devastating effects on the health of Filipinos. The number of deaths that were not prevented with medical attention have increased as hospitals are shut down and rural areas are deprived of any medical treatment.|$|E
25|$|A census {{is taken}} {{simultaneously}} {{in all parts}} of the UK every ten years. The Office for National Statistics is responsible for collecting data for England and Wales, the General Register Office for Scotland and the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency each being responsible for censuses in their respective countries. In the 2011 census the total population of the United Kingdom was 63,181,775. It is the third-largest in the European Union, the fifth-largest in the Commonwealth and the 22nd-largest in the world. In mid-2014 and mid-2015 net long-term <b>international</b> <b>migration</b> contributed more to population growth. In mid-2012 and mid-2013 natural change contributed the most to population growth. Between 2001 and 2011 the population increased by an average annual rate of approximately 0.7%. This compares to 0.3% per year in the period 1991 to 2001 and 0.2% in the decade 1981 to 1991. The 2011 census also confirmed that the proportion of the population aged 0–14 has nearly halved (31% in 1911 compared to 18 in 2011) and the proportion of older people aged 65 and over has more than tripled (from 5 to 16%). It has been estimated that the number of people aged 100 or over will rise steeply to reach over 626,000 by 2080.|$|E

Using OECD's annual data on migrations, the indicator is built for 21 industrialized countries over the period from 1990 to 2006, allowing us to compare the restrictiveness / {{openness of}} policies between countries and over time. <b>international</b> <b>migrations,</b> migration policy, openness...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper was to {{summarize}} studies identifying the causes and effects of Philippine <b>international</b> labor <b>migration</b> and remittances and to highlight research gaps. Literature and reliability of findings that explore the many facets and implications {{of the social and}} economic impacts of <b>international</b> labor <b>migration</b> and remittances were assessed and reviewed. Impacts on education, health, family cohesion, fertility, and demographic distributions, as well as on consumption and investment, and poverty and inequality, were highlighted. The paper argued that understanding the social and economic impact of <b>international</b> labor <b>migration</b> and remittances is complex and an interdisciplinary research is needed to appropriately define the scope of its impact. To move our understanding of the issues forward, in-depth analyses using better specifications, estimation procedures, and data are necessary.
