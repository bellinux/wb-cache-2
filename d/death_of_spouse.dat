Studies examining the relationship between stressful life events and breast cancer risk have produced conflicting results. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to identify studies on this relationship, between 1966 and December 2002, to summarize and quantify the association and to explain the inconsistency in previous results. Summary odds ratios and standard errors were calculated, using random effect meta-regression analyses, for the following categories: stressful life events, <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>spouse,</b> death of relative or friend, personal health difficulties, nonpersonal health difficulties, change in marital status, change in financial status and change in environmental status. The presence of publication bias has been explored, and sensitivity analyses were performed to identify heterogeneity, using calculation {{of the percentage of}} variability due to heterogeneity, meta-regression analyses and stratification. Only the categories stressful life events (OR = 1. 77, 95 % CI 1. 31 - 2. 40), <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>spouse</b> (OR = 1. 37, 95 % CI 1. 10 - 1. 71) and death of relative or friend (OR = 1. 35, 95 % CI 1. 09 - 1. 68) showed a statistically significant effect. Publication bias was identified in both stressful life events (p = 0. 00) and death of relative or friend (p = 0. 02). Sensitivity analyses resulted in the identification of heterogeneity in all categories, except <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>spouse.</b> The results of this meta-analysis do not support an overall association between stressful life events and breast cancer risk.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} factors {{influencing}} marriage duration among the middle aged and elderly in Taiwan. The micro data used {{is from the}} Survey of Health and Living Status of the Middle Aged and Elderly in Taiwan (SHLS), which contains detailed information on individuals, family structure, health, social support, employment, and economic status. Weibull models are used to estimate the hazard rates of marriage duration, including divorce (included separation) and <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>spouse.</b> Further, this paper examines the effect of unobserved heterogeneity on estimated individual hazard rates of marriage duration. First, for the cases of divorce and <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>spouse,</b> the empirical results show that people with poor health, and whose partner has {{a higher level of}} education have a higher hazard rate of divorce and widowhood. In contrast, people with higher income, and elderly people with more children have a lower hazard rate of divorce and widowhood.

50|$|In a {{study done}} by Stahl and Shultz, {{they found that the}} <b>death</b> <b>of</b> a man’s <b>spouse</b> {{affected}} his physical activity (2014). Men’s physical activity increases immediately following the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> a <b>spouse,</b> and the authors note that this may perhaps be a coping mechanism to alleviate depressive symptoms (Stahl & Shultz, 2014). In the year following the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> a <b>spouse,</b> men are more likely to experience a fluctuation in physical activity during the transition into widowhood, if they did not die (Stahl & Shultz, 2014). Men in the youngest age group of this study (55- 65 years) were at the highest risk of mortality after the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> their <b>spouse</b> (Brenn & Ytterstad, 2016).

50|$|The <b>death</b> <b>of</b> a <b>spouse</b> {{can have}} a major impact on a person’s mental health. Each {{individual}} may respond to their spouse’s death differently. After the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> a <b>spouse</b> many widows begin to take more prescription medications for mental health issues (Avis, Brambilla, Vass, & Mckinlay, 1991). The mental health effects of men and women also differ. Men may become more depressed in widowhood compared to women because men may not have as strong of a support group. Married men also report a higher rate of happiness in their marriage and the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> their <b>spouse</b> could drastically alter this happiness. Women may have an easier time adapting to widowhood and be more willing to seek mental help while men tend to be less social and did not like to do chores, go to church, or help their children. Men and women both show greater rates of depression after the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> a <b>spouse</b> but the rates of depression in men tends to be higher than in women (Lee, DeMaris, & Sullivan, 2001).|$|R

40|$|Background: In ageing populations, {{informal}} care holds great potential to limit rising health care expenditure. The majority of {{informal care}} is delivered by <b>spouses.</b> The loss <b>of</b> informal care {{due to the}} <b>death</b> <b>of</b> the <b>spouse</b> could therefore increase expenditure levels for formal care. Objective: To investigate the impact <b>of</b> the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> the <b>spouse</b> on health care expenditure by older people through time. Additionally, to examine whether the impact differs between socio-demographic groups, and what health services are affectedmost. Design: Longitudinal data on health care expenditure (from July 2007 through 2010) from a regional Dutch health care insurer was matched with data on marital status (2004 – 2011) from the Central Bureau of Statistics. Linear mixed models with log transformed health care expenditure, generalized linear models and two-part models were used to retrieve standardized levels of monthly health care expenditure of 6, 487 older widowed subjects in the 42 months {{before and after the}} loss <b>of</b> the <b>spouse.</b> Results: Mean monthly health care expenditure in married subjects was J 502 in the 42 months before the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> the <b>spouse,</b> and expenditure levels rose by J 239 (48 %) in the 42 months after the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> the <b>spouse.</b> The increase in expenditure after the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> the <b>spouse</b> was highest for men (J 319; 59 %) and the oldest old (J 553; 82 %). Expenditure levels showed the highest increase for hospital and home care services (together J 166). Conclusions: The loss <b>of</b> the <b>spouse</b> is associated with an increase in health care expenditure. The relatively high rise in long-term care expenses suggests that the loss of informal care is an important determinant of this rise...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the question of}} when {{and to what extent}} individuals are affected by major positive and negative life events, including changes in financial situation, marital status, death of child or spouse and being a victim of crime. The key advantage of our data is that we are able to identify these events on a quarterly basis rather than on the yearly basis used by previous studies. We find evidence that life events are not randomly distributed, that individuals to a large extent anticipate major events and that they quickly adapt. These effects have important implications for the calculation of monetary values needed to compensate individuals for life events such as crime or <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>spouse.</b> We find that our new valuation methodology that incorporates these dynamic factors produces considerably smaller compensation valuations than those calculated using the standard approach. life satisfaction, life events, adaptation, compensation...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{positive}} and negative impact of service provider experiences on the process of identity adjustment and how they can lead to subjective well-being (SWB). Due to increased life expectancies, people are experiencing major life events during aging (e. g. death of a spouse, serious disease and major health problems), events that lead to identity redefinition. To gain more insights into this issue, a qualitative study was carried out that involved 37 in-depth interviews, conducter with aging individuals who had experienced a major life event such as retirement and/or <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>spouse.</b> To apprehend the diversity of consumption situation, the authors investigated daily consumption, hedonic consumption and imposed services (e. g. health and funeral services) due to life events.

Purpose The {{purpose of this}} study is to examine relationships between specific life events and changes in PA in three cohorts of Australian women. Methods Young (N[*]=[*] 7, 173; age 22 – 27 years), mid-age (N[*]=[*] 8, 762; 51 – 56 years), and older (N[*] =[*] 6, 660; 73 – 78 years) participants in the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health completed surveys on two occasions, 3 years apart. Results: About one third of the young and mid-age women and one quarter of the older women were “active” at both times. Decreasing PA was associated with marriage and childbirth in young women and with declining health in older women. Increasing PA was associated with retirement and <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>spouse</b> in the mid-age women.
