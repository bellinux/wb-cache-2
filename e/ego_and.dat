40|$|This study {{examined}} the associations between children's early life experiences with parents, <b>ego</b> resiliency <b>and</b> <b>ego</b> undercontrol, <b>and</b> peer group social status in a longitudinal, multimethod study from infancy to middle childhood. Participants were 129 children (52 % boys) who were followed from 15  months of age to 9  years and their primary caregivers from the Nijmegen Longitudinal Study on Infant and Child Development. The measurements included observations of parent-child interaction, teacher ratings of <b>ego</b> resiliency <b>and</b> <b>ego</b> undercontrol, <b>and</b> peer-reported social status. Quality of parental interactive behavior was associated with <b>ego</b> resiliency <b>and</b> <b>ego</b> undercontrol. <b>Ego</b> resiliency <b>and</b> <b>ego</b> undercontrol were uniquely related to preference and popularity.

5|$|From the {{distance}} of our times, Diefenbaker's role as a prairie populist who tried to revolutionize the Conservative Party begins to loom larger than his personal idiosyncrasies. The difficulties he faced {{in the form of}} significant historical dilemmas seem less easy to resolve than Liberals and hostile journalists opined at the time. If Diefenbaker defies rehabilitation, he can at least be appreciated. He stood for a fascinating and still relevant combination of individual and egalitarian values... But his contemporaries were also right in seeing some kind of disorder near the centre of his personality and his prime-ministership. The problems of leadership, authority, power, <b>ego,</b> <b>and</b> a mad time in history overwhelmed the prairie politician with the odd name.|$|E
5|$|The Third Doctor's final {{story was}} to be The Final Game by Robert Sloman and Barry Letts as an uncredited co-writer which was {{commissioned}} on 15 February 1973. The story was to end with the reveal that the Master and the Doctor were brothers or two different, opposing aspects of the same being (the <b>Ego</b> <b>and</b> the Id), and the Master dying in a manner which suggested that he sacrificed himself to save the Doctor's life. The actor who played the Master, Roger Delgado, {{was killed in a}} car accident in Turkey on 18 June 1973, forcing the scrapping of the story. The story was replaced by Planet of the Spiders.|$|E

They realize that Olivia is unaware that she has been possessed by William's mind, and instead has likely locked her ego away, making it difficult to contact her by normal means. Walter comes up with a plan: he and Peter (Joshua Jackson) will enter Olivia's mind with the aid of LSD to locate her <b>ego</b> <b>and</b> help it to regain dominance in her mind, while Walter hopes to download William's mind into a computer.|$|E
5|$|Weyland is {{the billionaire}} founder and CEO of Weyland Corp. Lindelof {{described}} him as having a massive <b>ego</b> <b>and</b> suffering from a god complex. Applying the necessary prosthetics and make-up to transform Pearce into the aging Weyland took five hours, and an hour to remove it. Pearce observed elderly individuals to gain insight into the movement for his character, as he found replicating the impeded physical movement {{the most difficult part}} of the role. Max von Sydow was Scott's original choice to play Weyland, but the casting of Pearce made it possible for him to portray Weyland as both an elderly character, and a younger man who appeared in an earlier script draft.|$|E
5|$|While {{the goddess}} is a mature sixteen-year old who has conquered her <b>ego</b> <b>and</b> awakened her kundalini, the attendants are {{described}} as spiritually immature twelve-year olds who are sustained on the goddess's blood and have not become liberated from the delusion of duality. In portrayals where the goddess's hair is tied like a matron and her attendants have free-flowing hair like young girls, the goddess is treated as a motherly figure of regal authority and power; the tied hair and headlessness represent contrasting ideas of controlled and uncontrolled nature, respectively.|$|E

Faced {{with the prospect of}} closing the paper, Wynand gives in and publishes a denunciation of Roark. At his trial, Roark makes a speech about the value of <b>ego</b> <b>and</b> integrity, and he is found not guilty. Dominique leaves Wynand for Roark. Wynand, who has betrayed his own values by attacking Roark, finally grasps the nature of the power he thought he held. He shuts down the Banner and commissions a final building from Roark, a skyscraper that will serve as a monument to human achievement. Eighteen months later, the Wynand Building is under construction. Dominique, now Roark's wife, enters the site to meet him atop its steel framework.|$|E
5|$|The Tempest can be {{interpreted}} as Shakespeare's last treatise on the human soul, in particular the Renaissance conception of the tripartite soul divided into vegetative, sensitive, and rational spheres, as described in Plato's tripartite theory of soul and Christian Philosophy. This was later also described in Sigmund Freud's id, <b>ego</b> <b>and</b> super-ego which was first linked to The Tempest in the 1956 screenplay for Forbidden Planet by Cyril Hume, Irving Block, and Allen Adler. The film presents Caliban reinterpreted as the 'monster from the Id', although the theory is dismissed as 'obsolete' in that imagined future, and was also dismissed by James E Phillips in 1964. Prospero is exiled to an island with a symbol of his baser, 'vegetative' nature – Caliban – and his higher, 'sensitive' or supernatural side – Ariel. Some productions have seen the same actor play all three roles, making them symbols of the conflict within a fully actualised or awakened Prospero – that between crude selfish physicality and a higher, mystical side.|$|E
5|$|Writer Damon Lindelof {{conceived}} Peter Weyland as a {{man with}} a massive <b>ego</b> <b>and</b> a god complex. During the film's early development director Ridley Scott intended Max von Sydow to play Weyland, but he began to favor Guy Pearce when a scene was written with a younger version of the character. To depict Weyland's aging, Pearce wore heavy prosthetics requiring five hours to apply and one hour to remove. The actor worked to replicate the speech patterns and movements of an elderly man. Although Weyland's younger version was omitted from Prometheus final screenplay, the film marketed the character with a fictional, futuristic TED talk in which Pearce appears without prosthetics. His performance was generally negatively received because of the unconvincing prosthetics and the casting of a 44-year-old actor as a 103-year-old man. However, the Weyland Industries web campaign was recognized by the Key Art Awards. In October 2016, it was reported that Pearce would be reprising his role as a younger version of Weyland in Alien: Covenant.|$|E
