25|$|Oak marble galls {{develop as}} a {{chemically}} induced distortion of leaf buds on pedunculate oak (Quercus robur), sessile oak (Quercus petraea) or their hybrid Quercus Ã— rosacea, trees, {{caused by the}} parthenogenetic <b>gall</b> <b>wasp</b> (Andricus kollari, (Hartig, 1843)) which lays eggs within leaf buds using their ovipositor. The Turkey oak (Quercus cerris), introduced into Britain in 1735, {{is required for the}} completion of the life cycle of the gall. The oak marble gall is frequently confused with the oak apple gall, caused by another <b>gall</b> <b>wasp,</b> Biorhiza pallida. Oak marble galls are also known as the bullet gall, oak nut or Devonshire gall. Synonyms for the species are Cynips kollari, Andricus quercusgemmae, A. minor, A. indigenus and A. circulans.|$|E
25|$|Bird {{species that}} {{reside in the}} oak woods include blue tit, common chaffinch, goldcrest, European robin, and wren. Mammals include badger, fox, pine marten, red deer, sika deer, and red squirrel. Insects include many species of the {{parasitic}} <b>gall</b> <b>wasp</b> and the purple hairstreak butterfly, whose caterpillar is entirely dependent upon oak trees.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} insect inquilines live harmlessly within the oak marble gall {{and some of}} these, as well as Andricus itself, are {{parasitised}} by insects referred to as parasitoids. The chalcid wasp Torymus nitens {{is an example of}} a parasitoid in oak marble galls. The presence of these inquilines and parasites is often visible on older galls by the presence of fine exit-holes, smaller than that of the <b>gall</b> <b>wasp</b> itself.|$|E

25|$|Eucalyptus {{trees were}} {{introduced}} to Sri Lanka in the late 19th century by tea and coffee planters, for wind protection, shade and fuel. Forestry replanting of eucalyptus began in the 1930s in deforested mountain areas, and currently there are about 10 species present in the island. They account for 20% of major reforestation plantings. They provide railway sleepers, utility poles, sawn timber and fuelwood, but are controversial because of their adverse effect on biodiversity, hydrology and soil fertility. They are associated with another invasive species, the eucalyptus <b>gall</b> <b>wasp,</b> Leptocybe invasa.|$|E
25|$|Kinsey {{chose to}} do his {{doctoral}} thesis on gall wasps, and began zealously collecting samples of the species. He traveled widely and took 26 detailed measurements {{of hundreds of thousands}} of gall wasps; his methodology was itself an important contribution to entomology as a science. Kinsey was granted a Sc.D. degree in 1919 by Harvard University, and published several papers in 1920 under the auspices of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, introducing the <b>gall</b> <b>wasp</b> to the scientific community and describing its phylogeny. Of the more than 18 million insects in the museum's collection, some 5 million are gall wasps collected by Kinsey.|$|E

2500|$|M. mexicanus {{collects}} food {{mainly in}} the form of nectar from yucca plants (Yucca glauca) and sugary galls formed on scrub oaks (Quercus gambelii). The <b>gall</b> <b>wasp</b> (Holcaspis perniciosus) forms the galls (rotund growths) along scrub oak branches, and these galls leak a clear sugary liquid on which the ants feed. Additionally, these ants feed on a variety of flower nectars, cacti fruit, and the excretions of aphids feeding on yucca plants. Workers will also collect dead insects and attack small, soft bodied insects. [...] In particular, M. mexicanus tends to feed on dead and moribund harvester ants (Pogonomyrmex occidentalis).|$|E
