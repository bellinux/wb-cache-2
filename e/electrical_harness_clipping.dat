50|$|With this authorization, the USGS flight {{operations}} {{team at the}} NASA Goddard Space Flight Center uploaded a series of commands to the spacecraft, instructing it to operate using the redundant <b>electrical</b> <b>harness.</b> This operation was successful, and on September 5, 2003, the ETM+ instrument was turned on and acquired data that {{was sent to the}} Landsat ground system at EROS outside Sioux Falls, South Dakota. It was immediately apparent that the migration to the Side-B <b>electrical</b> <b>harness</b> had not fixed the problem with the SLC.

50|$|Jacklines may be rigged {{temporarily}} when {{bad weather}} is expected, or, especially on sailboats heading offshore, {{they may be}} left in place {{all the time and}} used as necessary. They are usually attached to strong padeye or cleat fittings {{at both ends of the}} boat, allowing the crewmember to move fore and aft by sliding their <b>harness</b> <b>clip</b> along the line. Jacklines may be made of wire or low-stretch rope. More recently, sailors are using high strength nylon webbing. The reason is that flat webbing does not roll under foot while working on deck and there is less chance to confuse it with other lines in difficult conditions. This reduces the hazard that can be created by using rope.|$|R

50|$|Following the SLC failure, an Anomaly Response Team (ART) was assembled, {{consisting}} {{of representatives from}} the USGS, NASA, and Hughes Santa Barbara Remote Sensing (the manufacturer of the ETM+ instrument).

Since there is no backup SLC, a mechanical failure would indicate that the problem was permanent. However, the team was unable {{to rule out the}} possibility of an electrical failure, though such a possibility was deemed remote. Nevertheless, on September 3, 2003, USGS director Charles G.

50|$|When {{only the}} APM {{was left in}} the program there were not enough tasks for the two main {{contributors}} Germany and Italy represented by MBB-ERNO and Alenia respectively.

Splitting off systems engineering responsibility and harness design under separate fixed-price contracts was found not to be advantageous with respect to efficiency and fast decision making as financial reasonings were pre-dominant in the last phase of development and verification.|$|R

40|$|The {{allowable}} operating {{currents of}} electrical wiring {{when used in}} the space vacuum environment is predominantly determined by the maximum operating temperature of the wire insulation. For Kapton insulated wire this value is 200 C. Guidelines provided in the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) Preferred Parts List (PPL) limit the operating current of wire within vacuum to ensure the maximum insulation temperature is not exceeded. For 20 AWG wire, these operating parameters are: (1) 3. 7 amps per wire; (2) bundle of 15 or more wires; (3) 70 C environment: and (4) vacuum of 10 (exp - 5) torr or less.
