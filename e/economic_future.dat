5|$|In 1948 Britain's railways, {{and hence}} the canal, were nationalised, and became the {{responsibility}} of the British Transport Commission. In 1963 control of the canal passed to British Waterways. Under the terms of the Transport Act 1968, all waterways within the jurisdiction of British Waterways were classified as commercial, cruising or remainder waterways. Remainder waterways were those that were deemed to have no <b>economic</b> <b>future,</b> and maintenance would only be carried out where failure to do so would create health or safety issues. The Grantham Canal was listed in this latter category.|$|E

Cooperation between the Western Allies and the Soviets ultimately broke down because of disagreements over Germany's political and <b>economic</b> <b>future.</b> In May 1949, the three western occupation zones were merged to form the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) with a freely elected government. The Soviet zone became the German Democratic Republic (GDR), under communist rule.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} to Portland {{he built a}} home at 12th and Jefferson streets {{in what is now}} Downtown Portland. Chapman then returned to the practice of law. He also worked to secure Portland’s <b>economic</b> <b>future</b> by promoting the construction of the railroad line to California to link with the transcontinental rail line. From 1870 to 1876 he started three companies with the goal of creating a railroad connecting Portland to the Union Pacific’s transcontinental railroad. Chapman’s proposed line would have traveled through the Columbia River Gorge to The Dalles, Oregon, where it would then travel southeast to Salt Lake City, Utah, linking to the Union Pacific line.|$|E

5|$|By the 1960s, {{only the}} Saint Thomas Creek, the City Mills River and the Channelsea River {{were still being}} used for {{commercial}} traffic. A section of the Channelsea River between Stratford High Street and Lett Road was culverted between 1957 and 1958. As traffic ceased, the lock structures deteriorated, and by 2006, City Mills Lock and Carpenters Road Lock were officially disused. The 1968 British Waterways Act had classified most waterways into commercial, cruising and remainder waterways. Remainder waterways were those for which {{the government of the}} time could see no <b>economic</b> <b>future,</b> and which would only therefore be subject to maintenance to prevent them becoming unsafe. The Bow Back Rivers fell into this category, and remained neglected until their full restoration was enshrined in a British Waterways policy document in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Specific {{findings}} in sociological studies of leisure are illustrated by John Robinson's late-1970s study of American leisure. Robinson found that Americans, on average, have {{four hours of}} leisure time each weekday, and more on weekends—six hours on Saturdays, almost eight on Sundays. Amount of leisure time diminishes with age, work, marriage, and children. However, the amount of free time does not significantly depend on an individual's wealth. People desire less free time if they are uncertain of their <b>economic</b> <b>future,</b> or if their job is their central interest. During {{the second half of}} the twentieth century, watching television became a major leisure activity, causing a substantial decrease in the time dedicated to other activities; in the early 1970s the average American had 4 hours of leisure per day, and spent 1.5 of them watching television. Shared leisure activities increase marital satisfaction.|$|E

For the major current institutions were created under different conditions, and the experience suggests that they may not best serve the peoples of Europe under current and expected future conditions.

40|$|This {{academic}} {{discourse is}} a research treatise that is submitted in fulfilment of the requirements for the Masters in Business Administration (MBA) degree at the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University (NMMU). Purpose – The purpose of this treatise is to develop four possible scenarios for Africa’s <b>economic</b> <b>futures</b> over the next 40 years, i. e. towards 2055. This study will expose the possible, probable, plausible, and preferable (desirable) scenarios for Africa towards 2055. Design/Methodology/Approach – This study employs a Futures Studies methodology that is known as scenario planning. The key variables of the scenarios are clustered as follows: Good governance and good economic growth; Good governance and bad economic growth; Bad governance and bad economic growth; as well as bad governance and good economic growth. Each of these scenarios begin with {{the current state of}} affairs in Africa. As such, the four scenarios in this study are informed by the current affairs in African countries as is internationally observed by scientists, researchers, as well as global views and opinions. Practical implications – This academic discourse provides useful insight into the causality relationship between the political, economic, sociological, technological, ecological, as well as legal factors (PESTEL factors) on the continent and the possible scenarios for Africa’s <b>economic</b> <b>futures</b> towards 2055. The aforementioned causality relationship between the abovementioned variables allows for insight into the drivers for change for Africa as well as in what way to anticipate these changes in accordance with scenario planning. Originality/Value: This treatise looks at the <b>economic</b> <b>futures</b> of Africa over the next 40 years {{from the point of view}} of African planners and African decision-makers...|$|R

25|$|After {{close to}} 50 years of {{economic}} and industrial growth, the city of Camden faced a period of economic stagnation and deindustrialization: after reaching a peak of 43,267 manufacturing jobs in 1950, there was an almost continuous decline to a new low of 10,200 manufacturing jobs in the city by 1982. With this industrial decline came a plummet in population: in 1950 there were 124,555 residents, compared to just 84,910 in 1980. Alongside these declines, civil unrest and criminal activity rose in the city. From 1981 to 1990, mayor Randy Primas fought to renew the city economically.
