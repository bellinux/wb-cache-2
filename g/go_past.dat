5|$|On April 13, 2007, Judah {{made his}} return to the ring against Ruben Galvan at the Fitzgeralds Casino & Hotel in Tunica, Mississippi. Judah came out {{strongly}} in the first round, landing numerous shots on Galvan. During the round, a bad cut opened near the top of Galvan's head. The referee called for a timeout to allow the doctor {{to take a look at}} the cut. Due to the severity of the cut, the fight was waved off. The cut was ruled to be caused by an accidental foul with an elbow and since the fight did not <b>go</b> <b>past</b> four rounds, the fight was ruled a no contest.|$|E
5|$|Captain Smith was an {{experienced}} seaman {{who had served}} for 40 years at sea, including 27 years in command. This was the first real crisis of his career, and he most certainly {{would have known that}} even if all the boats were fully occupied, more than a thousand people would remain on the ship as she went down with little or no chance of survival. As Smith began to grasp the enormity of what was about to happen, he appears to have become paralysed by indecision. He had ordered passengers and crew to muster, but from that point onward, he failed to order his officers to put the passengers into the lifeboats; he did not adequately organise the crew; he failed to convey crucial information to his officers and crew; he sometimes gave ambiguous or impractical orders and he never gave the command to abandon ship. Even some of his bridge officers were unaware for some time after the collision that the ship was sinking; Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall did not find out until 01:15, barely an hour before the ship went down, while Quartermaster George Rowe was so unaware of the emergency that after the evacuation had started, he phoned the bridge from his watch station to ask why he had just seen a lifeboat <b>go</b> <b>past.</b> Smith did not inform his officers that the ship did not have enough lifeboats to save everyone. He did not supervise the loading of the lifeboats and seemingly made no effort to find out if his orders were being followed.|$|E

The Stan Nagaiah Trophy, an annual three match series of one-day matches against Malaysia, began the following year. Singapore played in the first ACC Trophy in 1996, beating the Maldives and Thailand but failing to <b>go</b> <b>past</b> the first round.

25|$|Fewer {{than one}} percent of lynch mob {{participants}} were ever convicted by local courts and they were seldom prosecuted or brought to trial. By the late 19th century, trial juries in most of the southern United States were all white because African Americans had been disenfranchised, and only registered voters could serve as jurors. Often juries never let the matter <b>go</b> <b>past</b> the inquest.|$|E

25|$|Skid boast: A shot played {{from the}} back corners of the court where the ball is hit high along the {{sidewall}} with a small angle so that it hits the sidewall first, then hits high {{in the middle of}} the front wall continuing to cross the court while high in the air ideally hitting the opposite sidewall and landing close to the backwall to <b>go</b> <b>past</b> the opponent. As with the Philadelphia it is susceptible to being volleyed.|$|E

25|$|The Australians began day two {{looking to}} <b>go</b> <b>past</b> England's total, {{and build a}} big lead, {{and that is exactly}} what they did. Geoff Marsh fell off just 14 balls for a disappointing 3, but Mark Taylor and David Boon added 145 for the second wicket, {{although}} it was hard work and slow-going. Taylor was caught LBW for 62 in a rare lapse of concentration in an otherwise well made innings, and Boon was dismissed 42 runs later, out for 94. Australia batted on throughout the second day but their progress was slow but steady.|$|E
