Local beliefs are that losses in lake area have been even greater within the last 100 - 200 years. Various activities, including timber removal, shifting agriculture in the uplands by various ethnic groups, and unsustainable cultivation practices on the low- and mid-level hillslopes around the lake, have been blamed for both <b>historical</b> and ongoing <b>sedimentation.</b> We take issue with attributing loss of lake area to these activities, and propose instead that ongoing "in-lake" and "near-lake" agricultural practices are the main sources of contemporary sediment and loss of open water area. About 93 % (i. e., 20. 84 km 2) of the recent loss in open water area of the lake {{is due to the}} development of floating garden agriculture, largely along {{the west side of the}} lake. Direct environmental impacts associated with this practice and with other agriculture activities within the wetlands and margins of the lake include sedimentation, eutrophication, and pollution.

40|$|This book {{comprises}} twenty eight {{essays by}} leading experts in contemporary {{art on the}} difference between the professional practice of setting up exhibitions (curating) and the curatorial, this event that takes place on the stage set up, both intentionally and unintentionally, by the curator. Stop curating! And think what curating is all about. This book starts from this simple premise: thinking the activity of curating. To do that, it distinguishes between 'curating' and 'the curatorial'. If 'curating' is a gamut of professional practices for setting up exhibitions, then 'the curatorial' explores what takes place on the stage set up, both intentionally and unintentionally, by the curator. It therefore refers not to the staging of an event, but to the event of knowledge itself. In order to start thinking about curating, this book takes a new approach to the topic. Instead of relying on conventional art historical narratives (for example, identifying the moments when artistic and curatorial practices merged or when the global curator-author was first identified), this book puts forward a multiplicity of perspectives that go from the anecdotal to the theoretical and from the personal to the philosophical. These perspectives allow for a fresh reflection on curating, one in which, suddenly, curating becomes an activity that implicates us all (artists, curators, and viewers), not just as passive recipients, but as active members. As such, the Curatorial is a book without compromise: it asks us to think again, fight against sweeping art <b>historical</b> generalizations, the <b>sedimentation</b> of ideas and the draw of the sound bite. Curating will not stop, but at least with this book it can begin to allow itself to be challenged by some of the most complex and ethics-driven thought of our times...|$|R

40|$|Analysis of the {{sedimentary}} {{record has}} been used to determine the <b>historical</b> <b>sedimentation</b> rate in the lower Yellow River and the historical literature has been studied to obtain information on climate change and human activities. Based on the data obtained, the temporal variation in the sedimentation rate in the lower Yellow River over the past 2300 years has been studied in relation to climate change and the impact of human activities. The results indicate that the response of the sedimentation zone of Yellow River system to changes in the erosion zone are consistent with existing understanding. Changes in vegetation and land use, both related to climate change and human activities, are two major controls responsible for the increase in sedimentation rates. Additionally, the changing strategies for harnessing of the lower Yellow River are also responsible for such acceleration. With the trend of accelerated sedimentation in the past 2300 years, the period from the 7 th to 10 th centuries and the period since the mid- 19 th century have been identified as two periods in which abrupt changes occurred.

40|$|A {{comparison}} of 1927, 1970 and 2002 bathymetric surveys in the Lagoon of Venice {{was used to}} reconstruct <b>historical</b> changes in <b>sedimentation.</b> A detailed GIS-based analysis of the charts revealed the timing and pattern of geomorphic changes and allowed calculation of sediment deposition and erosion for the entire lagoon and each of its four sub-basins: Treporti, Lido, Malamocco and Chioggia. Two main developments are discernible from comparative observation of the areal distribution of the main elevation ranges: the diminution in area of the saltmarshes, which decreased by more than 50 %, from 68 km 2 in 1927 to 32 km 2 in 2002, and the progressive deepening of the lagoon, with a huge increase {{in the area of}} subtidal flats (between - 0. 75 and - 2. 00 m depth), from 88 to 206 km 2 during the same period. Generally, the lagoon showed a clear-cut change in the most frequent depths (modal depth) from a value of - 0. 62 m in 1927 to - 0. 88 m in 2002. The deepening of the lagoon affected mostly the lagoonal sub-basins south of the town of Venice, where modal depth increased from - 0. 65 m to - 1. 12 m in Lido, from - 0. 64 to - 1. 75 m in Malamocco and from - 0. 39 m to - 0. 88 m in Chioggia. Large changes in lagoonal morphology were caused by human-induced subsidence, the dredging of navigation channels between 1927 and 1970, and intense natural erosion enhanced by sediment re-suspension due to Manila clam fishing between 1970 and 2002. There was a net loss of about 110 Mm 3 of sediment from the lagoon, most of which (73 Mm 3, ca. 70 %) was in the earlier period. A significant amount was lost by dredging and direct disposal outside the system, either on land or at sea, and there was a net loss of 39 Mm 3 from the lagoon to the sea through the inlets, {{at an annual rate of}} 0. 5 Mm 3. Comparison of erosion rates in the two periods revealed an alarming acceleration, from a net sediment loss of 0. 3 Mm 3 y - 1 in the period 1927 - 1970 to 0. 8 Mm 3 y - 1 in 1970 - 2002. Deterioration caused a shift from a highly differentiated lagoon morphology in the 1930 s to a sediment-starved and subsidence-dominated structure in the 1970 s, and from there to the high-energy and more open (bay-like) lagoon of today. The results demonstrate the potential application of GIS to reconstruct the recent chronology of sediment distribution and to improve the understanding of the geomorphic processes shaping the seafloor, whilst providing an insight into the possible impacts of environmental changes induced by natural and anthropogenic forcing...|$|R
40|$|The {{historical}} {{geography of the}} West Scheldt region, in particular the southeastern part of it bas been studied both by historians and geographers, {{but there is no}} consensus between them about the genesis of the landscape which bas been influenced by the presence of the river Scheldt. In this article we try to bring together the different points of view as well as their argumentation, to which new interpretation is added in order to come to an integration of the sources and -in our opinion -to provide an acceptable explanation of the {{historical geography}} of that region. There can be made a crude distinction between three regions in the area under consideration, which run more or less parallel to the West Scheldt river. First there is the most southerly area {{on both sides of the}} frontier between Belgium and the Netherlands. There is historical evidence that this region was largely covered with peat during the Middle Ages (fig. 1). De moeren, as this area was called in Dutch, were systematically drained from the 12 th century on- wards and parceled out by important entrepreneurs from the cities as well as by religious institutions (such as the abbey of St. Baafs in Ghent), to dig out the valuable fuel and to make arable land after- wards. In this part of the region all the peat has been excavated. This was easy to do because of the thinness of the peat layer caused by a higher positition of the underlying pleistocene deposits. To this day this pleistocene sandy soil preserves its typicallinear settlement with an organisation of the land in small strips (Marsch- hufenfluren) (see figs. 2 and 3). Some Belgian geographers in- correctly considered this field pattern as typical of the Flemish sandy soils"(!), denying or neglecting the nearness of the West Scheldt in the formation of the landscape. The second region we studied is the area at present covered with a layer of clay. Contrary to what has sometimes been pointed out, this clay is of rather recent genesis. The Dunkerque transgressions had little influence on these deposits, but the artificial inundations of the later sixteenth century are for the greater part responsible for this important <b>sedimentation.</b> <b>Historical</b> sources prove a very intensive activity of peat digging here during the later Middle Ages. Some misunderstandings of this matter, resulting from palynological research, are probably caused by the fact that the top of the peat layer is mostly missing by peat exploitation or by erosion. Nevertheless, we could calculate that in the parishes Kieldrecht, Verrebroek and Kallo a minimum of 100, 000 m J of peat was digged out in the year 1400. If the activity went on with the same intensity every year, about I meter would have been excavated in one century in an area with a surface of about 250 acres. Some geographers, believing in early clay sedimentation, consider peat digging in this region most unlikely. Finally, the last region under consideration is the rather narrow territory near the West Scheldt. Of course the history of the deposits within this region is closely tied to the history of the origin of the West Scheldt itself. Written sources are insufficient to resolve the problem. Pollenanalytical observations on useful samples, in combination with radiocarbon datings led to the conclusion that this branch of the Scheldt has a post-Roman genesis, at the earliest dating from the Dunkerque II transgression (fig. 5 Waarde and Oorderen). In the beginning the tides will have had little influence, as can be shown by the peat which continued to grow in the neighbourhood of the banks of the West and the Lower Scheldt probably until the year 1000. Evidence for this conclusion is provided in the pollenanalyses of Saaftinge and Zandvliet where, after the second Subatlantic fagus maximum -in Zandvliet C 14 dated 940 A. D. - the peat kept growing for a certain time (see fig. 5) ...|$|R

These reconstructions serve {{as a basis for}} assessing the long-term effects of major interventions carried out between 1850 AD and the early 20 th century. We used a 2 D physics-based morphodynamic model accounting for the influence of floodplain vegetation to fill in this gap. Historical discharge hydrographs were derived from a correlation between flow discharge records at Cologne and water level measurements of the Rhine branches in the Netherlands, taking into account the discharge distribution between the branches. Historical floodplain sedimentation rates were estimated using old cartographic information and recent geomorphologic field work. The computed <b>historical</b> <b>sedimentation</b> rates are found to be within the range of measured data, which suggests that fine suspended sediment concentrations in the early 1800 s were comparable to contemporary ones. The computations show also how vegetation enhances the formation of natural levees close to the main channel {{and at the same time}} decreases the sedimentation rates in farther areas of the floodplain. A sensitivity analysis shows suspended sediment composition to have a strong influence on the resulting quantities and patterns of floodplain deposition. The reconstruction has also provided validation of the modelling tools to reproduce the effects of vegetation on sediment dynamics, enabling their implementation to study other cases...|$|E
40|$|Concerns {{over the}} silting {{up of the}} Avon estuary by the Avon Estuary Forum, the Aune Conservation Association and the South Hams Society, have {{prompted}} {{an investigation into the}} sedimentation and sea-level history of the Avon estuary. To investigate this problem analysis was carried out using lithostratigraphy, biostratigraphy, chemostrtigraphy and chronostratigraphy combined with documentation, maps and tide-gauge data. Evidence provided by the investigation indicates that the key factor responsible for the increase in sedimentation within the estuary is the increased rate of sea-level rise. This rise in sea-level combined with the isostatic subsidence of the south west of the UK, has gradually increased accumulation rates within the estuary since the 1900 s. The reproducibility of the <b>historical</b> <b>sedimentation</b> and sea-level rates shows poor correlation between the three marshes. The Main marsh monolith produced the oldest most complete and largely undisturbed chronology from the marshes investigated. Linkages between sediment quality and land use changes suggest that Loddiswell mine affected the sediment quality of the marsh deposits from 1819 to 1850 AD and is still having an effect today. Total nitrogen levels within the surfical marsh deposits are some cause for concem, as they exceed the concentration for sediment quality guidelines (Persaud et al., 1993) and may possibly cause problem in the future. The increase in nutrient levels within the majority of the cores is related to the decomposition of oi^anic matter, trapped by increasing accretion rates. It is likely that any effect on sedimentation rates caused by the Avon dam have been disguised by the increase in accretion rates caused by an increase in the rate of sea-level rise.

To understand these processes, approximately once a decade, the USACE Mobile District resurveys the sedimentation ranges (designated cross-sections) of the impoundments under their jurisdiction. During {{the winter and}} spring of 2009 / 2010 a resurvey of 27 of these impoundments located in Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi was conducted. Due to the large quantities of data, up to 116 ranges per impoundment, a Visual Basic program was written to process the recently collected data and to make comparisons with <b>historical</b> <b>sedimentation</b> and shoreline erosion data. The Visual Basic outputs included tabular comparisons and cross section plots. These outputs were used, in conjunction with aerial imagery, topographic maps, surveyors’ field notes, and site visits to evaluate quantitatively and qualitatively the sedimentation and erosion conditions by range and by region within each lake. Shoreline erosion/ sedimentation was evaluated by calculating the average horizontal shift of each bank at each range line. Shorelines were classified by percentiles based on shoreline retreat or advance in feet for all the sedimentation ranges, whereas the degree of range of sedimentation was evaluated as a straight percent change in cross-section area.

40|$|Before your {{interview}} for Avant, you have written: "I recently {{did a lot}} of work in cognitive science research which explicitly crosses over between phenomenology and dynamics, and in some sense this {{can be seen as a}} continuation of Hume's specific project to establish a foundational science of man". Would you agree that one of the determinants of an unprejudiced approach to traditional philosophy is … an enthusiasm? I think that cultivating an awareness of our past is an essential aspect of managing our future, and this is especially the case if we are interested in shaping the future of the sciences of the mind. In this regard we should not forget that Hume himself, of course, was also an enthusiastic scholar and famous historian. However, I would not say that this enthusiasm gives rise to an ‘unprejudiced approach ’ as such; we should not forget the critical lessons of postmodernism. At the same time it is certainly true that each of the great traditional philosophers had somewhat different prejudices than we have now, and therefore reading their works presents us with an opportunity to reevaluate our own positions from a rather fresh perspective. And in many cases we will find that their traditional perspective is still implicitly determining aspects of our modern discourse, although this role will have been more or less covered by subsequent <b>historical</b> <b>sedimentation.</b> Going back to these original sources and making their ongoing relevance explicit is an important task of modern philosophy. It can show us how the fundamental problems we are trying to solve today, whether by means of scientific experimentation, philosophical analysis, or phenomenological reflection, are not absolutely independent from our background.
