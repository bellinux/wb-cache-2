5|$|This bill {{establishes}} {{a weapon of}} violence against our citizenry far more wicked than anything ever known in recorded history — <b>far</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> the Siberian prison camps of the Czars or the Communists, or {{the violence of the}} Spanish Inquisition … The plot of wickedness revealed in this bill fairly reeks of the evil odor of the black forces of the Jesuits who dominate the Vatican, and, through officiates in our Government, dominate our politics.|$|E
5|$|In general polling, Tancredo fared <b>far</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> {{in straw}} polls. Early polls placed the {{candidate}} both {{above and below}} the 1% mark. However, in November 2007 he slightly moved up in polling, reaching the 2% mark and coming out ahead of his closest rival, Congressman Duncan Hunter of California. In a November 16 Gallup poll, Tancredo stood in seventh place at 2%, trailing Congressman Ron Paul of Texas by 3%. In a head-to-head matchup done by Rasmussen Reports on August 29, 2007, Tancredo trailed New York Senator Hillary Clinton by 13% finishing with 37% to Clinton's 50%. In a head-to-head matchup with Barack Obama administered on the same day, Tancredo finished with 31% to 48% for Obama.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, Ann fears {{she made}} out with {{someone at the}} party but cannot remember. She {{eventually}} learns she made out with Chris, who shows a romantic interest in her. Tom returns to the Snakehole Lounge to close his tab, where he meets the bartender, Lucy (Natalie Morales), who makes fun of his efforts to pick up women. The two get along and Lucy gives Tom her phone number, to his immense pleasure. Leslie decides to apologize to Ben, and he invites her out for a beer. As they finally start to get along, Leslie realizes Ben was the mayor {{of a small town}} called Partridge, Minnesota. It was national news because he was only 18 when elected, and he promptly drove the entire government into the ground. Ben became a state auditor to prove he can be responsible and restart his political career. Later, at the parks department budget meeting, Chris and Ben reveal Pawnee's budget crisis was <b>far</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> previously thought and that the Pawnee government will shut down until further notice, horrifying Leslie and delighting Ron.|$|E

60|$|The present {{question}} abundantly confirms me in {{the justice}} of this reasoning; for had I not been made cautious by this secret admonition, come from whence it will, I had been undone inevitably, and in a <b>far</b> <b>worse</b> condition <b>than</b> before, {{as you will see}} presently.|$|R
50|$|The {{division}} departed Lorient on 28 March 1806. Upon departure, {{it became}} evident that Néarque was a <b>far</b> <b>worse</b> sailer <b>than</b> the frigates {{and that she}} could not follow; Leduc detached her so that she would carry out her orders independently, but she was captured almost immediately by HMS Niobe.|$|R
5|$|The {{provisional}} government lacked direction in policy and planning, resulting in its quick collapse. The number of rural attacks instigated by the Viet Cong surged {{in the wake}} of Diệm's deposal, due to the displacement of troops into urban areas for the coup. The increasingly free discussion generated from the surfacing of new and accurate data following the coup revealed that the military situation was <b>far</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> what was reported by Diệm. The incidence of Việt Cộng attacks continued to increase as it had done during the summer of 1963, the weapons loss ratio worsened and the rate of Viet Cong defections fell. The units that participated in the coup were returned to the field to guard against a possible major communist offensive in the countryside. The falsification of military statistics by Diệm's officials had led to miscalculations, which manifested themselves in military setbacks after Diệm's death. Aside from battlefield setbacks, something that was outside his remit, Thơ was also becoming unpopular in the military establishment. One of the goals of the various anti-Minh coup plots at the time was to remove Thơ, and the prime minister's unpopularity helped to distract some of the incumbent officers from {{the fact that they were}} the primary target; at that time, the MRC was moving toward removing Thơ, and Minh was the only senior general to retain confidence in him.|$|E

50|$|A Hong Kong {{non-profit}} organisation, Students and Scholars Against Corporate Misbehavior, {{has written}} numerous negative reports on Foxconn's treatment of its employees. These typically find <b>far</b> <b>worse</b> conditions <b>than</b> the 2012 Fair Labor Association audit did, but {{they rely on}} a far smaller number of employee informants—100 to 170. The Fair Labor Association audit in 2012 used interviews with 35,000 Foxconn employees.|$|R
5000|$|Many New Englanders {{claimed that}} Whitefield {{destroyed}} “New England's orderly parish system, communities, and even families”. The “Declaration of the Association of the County of New Haven, 1745" [...] stated that after Whitefield’s preaching “religion {{is now in}} a <b>far</b> <b>worse</b> state <b>than</b> it was”. After Whitefield preached in Charlestown, a local newspaper article attacked him as “blasphemous, uncharitable, and unreasonable.” ...|$|R
25|$|Postwar {{evaluation}} by the Air Technical Service Command's Foreign Aircraft Evaluation Centre for the Air Force (located at Wright Field and Freeman Army Airfield) found the Atsuta engine's standard of workmanship {{was not as}} good as that of the Army's Kawasaki Ha-40, and <b>far</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> Mitsubishi and Nakajima.|$|E
25|$|In extreme cases, {{in remote}} areas, {{all of these}} misguided {{attempts}} at treatment have resulted in injuries <b>far</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> an otherwise mild to moderate snakebite. In worst-case scenarios, thoroughly constricting tourniquets have been applied to bitten limbs, completely shutting off {{blood flow to the}} area. By the time the person finally reached appropriate medical facilities their limbs had to be amputated.|$|E
25|$|By {{the age of}} 15, McTell {{was very}} anxious to leave grammar school and the British Army looked like a way out, so in 1959 he enlisted in the Junior Leaders Battalion of The Queen's Surrey Regiment. Army life proved <b>far</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> school. After six months, he bought himself out and resumed his {{education}} at technical college, passing several O level exams and an A level exam in art.|$|E
6000|$|Is that all? I {{could have}} invented <b>far</b> <b>worse</b> things <b>than</b> that to say of myself.... [With {{a change of}} tone.] You know, Jenny, it's not worth while to worry {{ourselves}} about such trifles. One can't force oneself to like people. I'm very sorry that I can't stand your relations. Why on earth don't you resign yourself and {{make the best of}} it? ...|$|R

I can go from here to Adelaide {{any time of the}} year and in any sort of season.|$|R
25|$|The {{strike against}} U.S. Steel ended on September 14, 1901. The AA settled for terms <b>far</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> those offered in August. Only plants which had started and ended the strike were covered, {{which meant that}} the union lost {{recognition}} at 15 plants. The company even won a pledge from the union not to organize any plant not already unionized, and to reject any offer of affiliation from a unionized plant.|$|E
25|$|The post-war {{period was}} to prove more {{challenging}} for the LBSCR {{with the national}} railway strike in 1919, followed by two coalminers' strikes in 1920 and 1921 which resulted in reduced levels of service <b>far</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> anything seen during the war. Problems were also experienced with the Oxted Tunnel south of Woldingham which led to services being diverted through the Three Bridges Line. It was only in 1922 that services began to creep back to their pre-war levels.|$|E
25|$|The {{ambivalent}} {{attitude to}} Messalina {{can be seen}} in the late mediaeval French prose work in the J. Paul Getty Museum illustrated by the Master of Boucicaut, Tiberius, Messalina, and Caligula reproach one another in the midst of flames. It recounts a dialogue that takes place in hell between the three characters from the same imperial line. Messalina wins the debate by demonstrating that their sins were <b>far</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> hers and suggests that they repent of their own wickedness before reproaching her as they had done.|$|E
60|$|Hannibal's {{life was}} like an April day. Its {{brightest}} glory was in the morning. The setting of his sun was darkened by clouds and showers. Although for fifteen years the Roman people could find no general capable of maintaining the field against him, Scipio conquered him at last, and all his brilliant conquests ended, as Hanno had predicted, only in placing his country in a <b>far</b> <b>worse</b> condition <b>than</b> before.|$|R

Having been reared in affluence, with {{tenderer}} feelings and weaker muscles, {{as well as more}} delicate health, they are much less able to fight the battle of adversity than the lower poor, and I happen to know that the dear Misses Seaward are reduced just now to the very last extreme of poverty. But you have relieved them, mother." ...|$|R
6000|$|L. No Dryden is a <b>far</b> way <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> nothing, {{and nobody}} will [...] "do" [...] You can't {{translate}} it. But {{this is all}} you need know, that the lines are full of a passionate sense of the Apennines' fatherhood, or protecting power over Italy; and of sympathy with, their joy in their snowy strength in heaven, and with the same joy, shuddering through all the leaves of their forests.|$|R
25|$|The Georgian Orthodox Church {{was subject}} to a {{somewhat}} different policy and fared <b>far</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> the Russian Orthodox Church. During World War II, however, it was allowed greater autonomy in running its affairs in return for calling its members to support the war effort, although it did not achieve the kind of accommodation with the authorities that the Russian Orthodox Church had. The government reimposed tight control over it after the war. Out of some 2,100 churches in 1917, only 200 were still open in the 1980s, and it was forbidden to serve its adherents outside the Georgian Republic. In many cases, the regime forced the Georgian Orthodox Church to conduct services in Old Church Slavonic instead of in the Georgian language.|$|E

25|$|Emily {{attended}} the University of Deseret. For a time, {{she was a}} school teacher. In 1883, Grant asked Emily to marry him. Since she had not renounced her dislike for polygamy and he was already married to Lucy, that {{was in many ways}} a very daring move on his part, and she initially declined his request. Emily then {{had a change of heart}} and she and Grant married on May 27, 1884. Since the Edmunds Act had been enacted in 1882, the situation of Mormon polygamists was <b>far</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> it had been a decade earlier when Emily had first renounced polygamy. To avoid Grant having to go to prison on charges of unlawful cohabitation, Emily went to England to live at the LDS mission home to have her first child. She returned to the United States 16 months later and moved between multiple locations in Utah Territory and Idaho to avoid capture.|$|E
50|$|The United States Coast Guard {{had long}} {{declared}} the Jamestown Bridge to be a navigation hazard and {{requested that the}} state of Rhode Island dismantle the eastern two thirds of it. The Sierra Club, an environmental organization, suggested to instead turn the bridge into a bike route and walkway. However, the aging structure proved to be in <b>far</b> <b>worse</b> condition <b>than</b> previously thought, prompting officials to go ahead with removing the entire structure.|$|R
2500|$|Life in {{the camp}} is summed up by Keat Gin Ooi: [...] "The trying {{conditions}} of life under internment at Batu Lintang camp tested {{to the limits of}} the human struggle for survival. Food shortages, diseases and sickness, death, forced labor, harsh treatment, and deplorable living quarters were daily occurrences in camp." [...] The civilian internees were treated less harshly than the POWs; of those POWs, the other ranks were subjected to <b>far</b> <b>worse</b> treatment <b>than</b> the officers.|$|R
50|$|Though {{the title}} of the play might suggest the {{misogyny}} that was popular as a theatrical topic at the time, in fact the main female characters are found to be innocent of the accusation of inconstancy, and the play attacks the iniquity of arranged marriages. A happy ending is brought about against the will of the central characters' father - and Field portrays most of the male characters in a <b>far</b> <b>worse</b> light <b>than</b> the women.|$|R
25|$|In 1866, the British, French and Chinese governments {{agreed to}} {{mitigate}} the abuse by requiring all traders {{to pay for the}} return of all workers after their contract ended. The employers in the British West Indies declined these conditions, bringing the trade there to an end. Until the trade was finally abolished in 1875, over 150,000 coolies had been sold to Cuba alone, the majority having been shipped from Macau. These labourers endured conditions <b>far</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> those experienced by their Indian counterparts. Even after the 1866 reforms, the scale of abuse and conditions of near slavery did not get any better – if anything they deteriorated. In the early 1870s increased media exposure of the trade led to a public outcry, and the British, as well as the Qing government, put pressure on the Portuguese authorities to bring the trade at Macau to an end; this was ultimately achieved in 1874. By that time, a total of up to half a million Chinese workers had been exported.|$|E

500|$|Much of {{the album}} is {{presented}} in-character {{through the eyes of}} various fictional characters and onlookers. [...] "Fortune 500" [...] documents a fictional attempt to assassinate Queen Elizabeth II, which Higgs relates to the thoughts of suicide bombers moments before they detonate: [...] "The horror of the doubt is <b>far</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> the act, for the terrorist I mean. It’s this 'oh shit... maybe this isn’t what God wants'. I think it’s the darkest moment on the record." [...] Spearman called the inclusion of loaded, political lyrics on otherwise upbeat songs [...] "the Trojan Horse approach ... get your interesting lyrical idea into something that {{on the face of it}} is just there to be enjoyed". Higgs told NME that Kanye West's 2013 album Yeezus had a major impact on his writing, encouraging him to present himself more confidently, while Nick Cave provided inspiration to be more impulsive with his writing.|$|E
