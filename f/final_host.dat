5|$|For a {{parasitic}} organism, its {{habitat is}} the particular {{part of the}} outside or inside of its host on or {{in which it is}} adapted to live. The life cycle of some parasites involves several different host species, as well as free-living life stages, sometimes providing vastly different microhabitats. One such organism is the trematode (flatworm) Microphallus turgidus, present in brackish water marshes in the southeastern United States. Its first intermediate host is a snail and the second, a glass shrimp. The <b>final</b> <b>host</b> is the waterfowl or mammal that consumes the shrimp.|$|E
5|$|The tournament {{has been}} hosted by {{multiple}} nations. For example, the 1987 tournament was co-hosted by Australia and New Zealand. World Rugby {{requires that the}} hosts must have a venue with a capacity of at least 60,000 spectators for the <b>final.</b> <b>Host</b> nations sometimes construct or upgrade stadia {{in preparation for the}} World Cup, such as Millennium Stadium – purpose built for the 1999 tournament – and Eden Park, upgraded for 2011. The first country outside of the traditional rugby nations of SANZAAR or the Six Nations to be awarded the hosting rights was Japan, who will host the 2019 tournament.|$|E
25|$|The newly moulted adult female becomes {{increasingly}} active {{for the first}} 6–7 days and seeks a host. It attaches to the <b>final</b> <b>host</b> after 7–9 days (but possibly up to 77 days). After insemination by a male tick, or sometimes before, a female feeds on blood {{in order to gain}} the nutrients for the egg mass to mature. Adult females engorge for a period of 6–30 days, the time again being temperature dependent. (The 30-day engorgement time is derived from laboratory culture colonies.) Under natural conditions, the time taken for an adult female to engorge while on the host varies from 6 to 21 days, the period being longest in cool weather. When fully engorged (replete), the adult female drops off the host to the ground. After 11–20 days the gravid female starts to lay a batch of 2000 to 6000 eggs (20-200 eggs per day over 16–34 days) into moist vegetation such as leaf and branch litter, under the bark of trees and shrubs, or in foliage near the tips of branches. The eggs are attached as a mass utilising a wax-like substance. The female tick dies 1–2 days after egg laying is complete. Under laboratory conditions, female ticks have been kept alive for more than two years.|$|E

500|$|There is {{considerable}} evidence that parasitic trematode platyhelminths (a type of fluke) {{have contributed to}} developmental abnormalities and population declines of amphibians in some regions. [...] These trematodes of the genus Ribeiroia have a complex life cycle with three host species. [...] The first host includes a number of species of aquatic snails. [...] The early larval stages of the trematodes then are transmitted into aquatic tadpoles, where the metacercariae (larvae) encyst in developing limb buds. [...] These encysted life stages produce developmental abnormalities in post-metamorphic frogs, including additional or missing limbs. [...] These abnormalities increase frog predation by aquatic birds, the <b>final</b> <b>host</b> of the trematode.|$|E

2500|$|Helminths are {{transmitted}} to the <b>final</b> <b>host</b> in several ways. The most common infection is through ingestion of contaminated vegetables, drinking water, and raw or undercooked meat. Contaminated food may contain eggs of nematodes such as Ascaris, Enterobius, [...] and Trichuris; cestodes such as Taenia, Hymenolepis, and Echinococcus; and treamtodes such as Fasciola. Raw or undercooked meats are the major sources of Taenia (pork, beef and venison), Trichinella (pork and bear), Diphyllobothrium (fish), Clonorchis (fish), and Paragonimus (crustaceans). Schistosomes and nematodes such as hookworms (Ancylostoma and Necator) and Strongyloides can penetrate the skin directly. Finally, Wuchereria, Onchocerca, and Dracunculus {{are transmitted}} by mosquitoes and flies. In the developing world, the use of contaminated water is a major risk factor for infection. Infection can also take place through the practice of geophagy, which is not uncommon in parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Soil is eaten, for example, by children or pregnant women to counteract a real or perceived deficiency of minerals in their diet.|$|E
