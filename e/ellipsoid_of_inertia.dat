40|$|The gravity induced {{force on}} {{revolute}} robot links is generally {{comparable to the}} dynamic induced forces at high operational speeds. At low speeds this force dominates over the dynamic forces. In the process of study of the static and dynamic behaviour of manipulators through the overall measures such as the force ellipsoid, the dynamic manipulability ellipsoid, and the generalized <b>ellipsoid</b> <b>of</b> <b>inertia</b> the effect of gravity is ignored due to the complexity that the inclusion of this force brings to the analysis. This study presents a method to include the effect of gravity in the static and dynamic analysis of robot arms. Using the concept of fields, the gravity induced forces acting on individual links are replaced by a single force, called here the generalized weight of the arm. The generalized weight is a force that acts at the end effector and its magnitude and direction are functions of {{the configuration of the}} manipulator. Since the system is conservative, the generalized weight is considered to be the gradient of a potential field that will be called here the generalized gravitational field (GGF). This field alone can illustrate the overall effect of gravity on the manipulator throughout its work volume. The generalized weight field is then integrated with the force ellipsoid to display the true force that a manipulator can apply to its environment. Based on the generalized weight field and the generalized inertia tensor the generalized gravitational acceleration field is introduced. The dynamic manipulability ellipsoid is then superimposed on this field to demonstrate the true acceleration capability of the end effector. The relation between the generalized weight and the generalized <b>ellipsoid</b> <b>of</b> <b>inertia</b> is investigated. Effect of change of physical parameters of the arm are also discussed. It is shown that for a particular design of manipulators the generalized gravitational field is absolutely flat, and in general the manipulators's physical parameters may be used to tailor the GGF for a particular application...|$|E

This study employs micro-computed tomography (μCT) and image techniques for analysing the anisotropy of regenerative medicine polymer scaffolds. For this purpose, three three-dimensional anisotropy evaluation image methods were used: <b>ellipsoid</b> <b>of</b> <b>inertia</b> (EI), mean intercept length (MIL) and tensor scale (t-scale). These were applied to three patterns (a sphere, a cube and a right prism) and to two polymer scaffold topologies (cylindrical orthogonal pore mesh and spherical pores).

Regarding the scaffolds, EI mistook both topologies (0. 0158, [− 0. 5683; 0. 6001]; mean difference and 95 % confidence interval), and MIL showed no significant differences (0. 3509, [0. 0656; 0. 6362]).

To describe {{the action of the}} RATs we use the analytical model (AMO) of RATs introduced in Paper I, namely, in Lazarian & Hoang (2007).

Such an alignment does not invoke paramagnetic, i. e. Davis-Greenstein, dissipation, but, nevertheless, grains tend to align with long axes perpendicular to magnetic field.

40|$|AbstractPoincaré's small {{parameter}} {{method and}} Krylov–Bogoliubov asymptotic method {{are among the}} number of basic methods used {{for the study of}} nonlinear oscillations. Poincaré's method was developed in conformity with stationary (periodic) oscillations (Malkin, Certain problems in the theory of nonlinear oscillations, ABC-tr- 3766, United States Atomic Energy Commission, Technical Information Service, 1959), although it may be extended to nonstationary oscillations (Bakhmutskii, On the application of Poincaré's method to the study of unsteady oscillations, Izv. Akad. Nauk SSSR OTN Mekh. Mashinostroenie (3) (1961)). The Krylov–Bogoliubov method may be used, first of all, for a study of nonstationary oscillations, but it is, of course, completely applicable to periodic oscillations (Bogoliubov and Mitropolski, Asymptotic Methods in the Theory of Nonlinear Oscillations, Gordon and Breach, New York, 1961.). It is sometimes asserted that these methods are different in principle. In the present paper, the method of Krylov–Bogoliubov–Mitropolski (Krylov and Bogoliubov, Introduction to Non-linear Mechanics, Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ, 1947, pp. 165 – 174) is modified to investigate periodic solutions, with nonzero basic amplitudes, for the equations of motion of a heavy solid, with one fixed point, rapidly spinning about the major or the minor axis of the <b>ellipsoid</b> <b>of</b> <b>inertia.</b> Numerical solutions for the reduced system of the equations of motion are obtained using fourth-order Runge–Kutta method (Rice, Numerical Methods, Software and Analysis, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1983).

To describe the action of RATs, we use the analytical model (AMO) of RATs introduced in Paper I. We focus our discussion on the alignment by anisotropic radiation flux with respect to magnetic field, which defines the axis of grain Larmor precession. Such an alignment does not invoke paramagnetic dissipation (i. e. Davis-Greenstein mechanism), but, nevertheless, grains tend to be aligned with long axes perpendicular to the magnetic field. When we account for thermal fluctuations within grain material, we show that for grains, which are characterized by a triaxial <b>ellipsoid</b> <b>of</b> <b>inertia,</b> the zero-$J$ attractor point obtained in our earlier study develops into a low-$J$ attractor point. We study effects of stochastic gaseous bombardment and show that gaseous bombardment can drive grains from low-$J$ to high-$J$ attractor points in cases when the high-$J$ attractor points are present. As the alignment of grain axes with respect to angular momentum is higher for higher values of $J$, counter-intuitively, gaseous bombardment can increase the degree of grain alignment in respect to the magnetic field. We also {{study the effects of}} torques induced by H$_ 2 $ formation and show that they can change the value of angular momentum at high-$J$ attractor point, but marginally affect the value of angular momentum at low-$J$ attractor points.

It is easily seen that the Legendre (and Binet) ellipsoid is an object of this dual BrunnMinkowski theory. This observation leads immediately to the natural question regarding the possible existence of a dual analog of the classical Legendre ellipsoid in the Brunn-Minkowski theory.

The proof {{is closely related to}} the theorem of Fritz John characterising <b>ellipsoids</b> <b>of</b> maximal volume {{contained in}} convex bodies. § 0. Introduction. In 1948, Fritz John proved that each convex body in R n contains an unique <b>ellipsoid</b> <b>of</b> maximal volume. Thus, each convex body has an affine image whose <b>ellipsoid</b> <b>of</b> maximal volume is the Euclidean unit ball, Bn 2. John characterised these affine images with the following theorem...|$|R
