Busby only took charge of two Scotland matches, but he did give a young Denis Law his first Scotland cap. In March 1959, Andy Beattie became Scotland manager for a second time. During his second spell as Scotland manager, Beattie combined those <b>duties</b> with managing a football club.

5|$|After {{the repeal}} of the Stamp Act, Parliament took a {{different}} approach to raising revenue, passing the Townshend Acts in 1767 which established new <b>duties</b> on various goods imported into the colonies. These <b>duties</b> were relatively low because the British ministry wanted to establish the precedent that Parliament had the right to impose tariffs on the colonies before raising them. Revenues from these <b>duties</b> were to be used to pay for governors and judges who would be independent of colonial control. To enforce compliance with the new laws, the Townshend Acts created a customs agency known as the American Board of Custom Commissioners, which was headquartered in Boston.|$|E
50|$|A customs <b>duty</b> or due is the {{indirect}} tax levied on the {{import or export}} of goods in international trade. In economic sense, a <b>duty</b> is also a kind of consumption tax.

5|$|Applying the {{categorical}} imperative, <b>duties</b> arise because {{failure to}} fulfil them would either {{result in a}} contradiction in conception or in a contradiction in the will. The former are classified as perfect <b>duties,</b> the latter as imperfect. A perfect duty always holds true—there is a perfect duty to tell the truth, so we must never lie. An imperfect duty allows flexibility—beneficence is an imperfect duty {{because we are not}} obliged to be completely beneficent at all times, but may choose the times and places in which we are. Kant believed that perfect <b>duties</b> are more important than imperfect duties: if a conflict between <b>duties</b> arises, the perfect duty must be followed.|$|E

The thesis continues {{to the development of the}} <b>duty</b> of loyalty in Czech Republic. Before 2014, this <b>duty</b> was not explicitly included in Czech law or no wide consensus about the legal source of this <b>duty.</b> The loyalty principle has begun to be recognized in 2006, when legal experts started to work with this term and set theoretical basis for this <b>duty.</b> Even if there was no consensus about the scope and range of the <b>duty</b> of loyalty and the existence of this <b>duty</b> itself, the <b>duty</b> of loyalty has been established in the judicature of Czech courts.
