40|$|The present study, {{focusing}} on Japanese women's re-entry into {{the labor market}} after child-rearing, shows how the manner of re-entry and factors which influence it have changed between the 1926 - 1945 birth cohort, here {{referred to as the}} older cohort, the 1946 - 1955 one, referred to as the middle cohort, and the 1956 - 1965 one, referred to as the younger cohort. The data of the Social-Stratification-and-Social-Mobility national survey conducted in 1995 were analyzed. The results show that for the older cohort, there were diversities in terms of the timing of re-entry, the social class backgrouds of those who re-entered, and <b>employment</b> <b>statuses</b> after re-entry. In contrast, progressive uniformity was observed {{in the way in which}} the middle cohort re-entered into the labor market. In this cohort, women with lower educational levels were more likely to re-enter than those with higher ones; most of them re-enterd when the last child was around 8 years old; and most of them were re-emplyed as part-timers. With regard to the younger cohort, progressive diversities were observed again in terms of the timing of the re-entry, and <b>employment</b> <b>statuses</b> after re-entry. 本稿では 1995 年SSM調査のデータを用いて、子育て後の女性の再就職のしかたとせれに影響を与える要因が、調査時点で 50 - 60 歳台、 40 歳台、 30 歳台、の人でどう変化したかについて分析した。その結果、次のことがわかった。 50 - 60 歳台の女性においては、再就職のタイミング・再就職後の就業形態・再就職した女性の階層的背景において多様性が見られた。しかし 40 歳台の女性では、階層的地位によって再就職する/しないが分かれるという 2 極化が見られ、また再就職する人においては「末子が 8 歳前後」に「パートタイマー」として再就職するという画一的パターンが見られるようになった。最後に 30 歳代の人では、上記の画一的パターンが崩れ、夫の収入が少ない人やパートタイマー以外で再就職する人では、再就職の時期がより早期化している可能性が示唆された...|$|R

25|$|<b>Employment</b> <b>status</b> {{effects are}} not {{confined}} to the individual. Being unemployed can have detrimental effects on a spouse's subjective well-being, compared to being employed or not working (and not looking for work). Partner life satisfaction is inversely related to the number of hours their partner is underemployed. When both partners are underemployed, the life-satisfaction of men is more greatly diminished than women. However, just being in a relationship reduces the impact unemployment has on the subjective well-being of an individual. On a broad scale, high rates of unemployment negatively affect the subjective well-being of the employed.|$|E

In 1912 the IWW organized a strike of more than twenty thousand textile workers, and by 1917 the Agricultural Workers Organization (AWO) of the IWW claimed a hundred thousand itinerant farm workers in the heartland of North America. Eventually the concept of One Big Union spread from dock workers to maritime workers, and thus was communicated to many different parts of the world. Dedicated to workplace and economic democracy, the IWW allowed men and women as members, and organized workers of all races and nationalities, without regard to current <b>employment</b> <b>status.</b> At its peak it had 150,000 members (with 200,000 membership cards issued between 1905 and 1916), but it was fiercely repressed during, and especially after, World War I with many of its members killed, about 10,000 organizers imprisoned, and thousands more deported as foreign agitators.
