50|$|The {{flash head}} can swivel up (to 90°), right (to 90°) and left (to 180°). The swivel {{properties}} allow the photographer to bounce the <b>flash</b> <b>off</b> walls, ceilings, and other objects, diffusing {{the light that}} hits the subject and reducing the harsh shadows associated with on-camera flash.|$|E

Battery locomotives are used because the High Temperature Tunnel may <b>flash</b> <b>off</b> the fuels of engines. Unlike Kurobe Gorge Railway which closes during winter, Jōbu Track operates whole year. This is because the line is almost entirely under a tunnel, so it is not affected by heavy snow.|$|E
50|$|Canon's {{external}} flashes with model {{numbers in}} the 400 range tend to be their mid-range external flashes. They all tend {{to have the ability}} to adjust the direction of the flash via a swivel head, which allows the photographer to bounce the <b>flash</b> <b>off</b> walls, ceilings, and other objects, diffusing the light that hits the subject and reducing the harsh shadows associated with on-camera flash. The 400 series differs from the higher end 500 series mostly by lacking a remote controller.|$|E
50|$|Canon's {{external}} flashes with model {{numbers in}} the 500 and 600 ranges tend to be their high end external flashes. All three products so far have included a controller that enables wireless control of other flashes. Another common feature {{is the ability to}} adjust the direction of the flash via a swivel head. The swivel properties allow the photographer to bounce the <b>flash</b> <b>off</b> walls, ceilings, and other objects, diffusing the light that hits the subject and reducing the harsh shadows associated with on-camera flash.|$|E

50|$|PIR sensors {{may be used}} {{to control}} {{lighting}} in such areas. They avoid the need to press a push-button but otherwise operate as for electronic timers. As PIR sensors are not perfectly reliable a timer is needed to avoid the lights <b>flashing</b> <b>off</b> and on as the occupier moves out of detector range. The timer interval is short though compared to a push-button timer; it times the interval between sightings of the occupier, not the time of occupancy.|$|R
5000|$|More natural looking {{single flash}} {{results can be}} {{obtained}} by raising the flash vertically to create a more natural downward angle, but keeping it centered. This is usually preferable when photographing people because it hides most of the shadows, especially the very distracting nose shadow. In this case the shadow is mostly hidden down below the nose and not noticed. The reason for not moving a single <b>flash</b> <b>off</b> axis sideways rather than vertically is that any shadows the flash creates will be unfilled, dark and potentially unflattering if poorly placed on a subject's face.|$|E
50|$|Large ships usually carry {{evaporating}} {{plants to}} produce fresh water, thus reducing their reliance on shore-based supplies. Steam ships {{must be able}} to produce high-quality distillate in order to maintain boiler-water levels. Diesel-engined ships often utilise waste heat as an energy source for producing fresh water. In this system, the engine-cooling water is passed through a heat exchanger, where it is cooled by concentrated seawater (brine). Because the cooling water (which is chemically treated fresh water) is at a temperature of 70 - 80 C, it would not be possible to <b>flash</b> <b>off</b> any water vapour unless the pressure in the heat exhanger vessel was dropped.|$|E
5000|$|But {{it turned}} out Wilhelmina may have used Alexis' {{friendship}} as a front in her quest to make MODE a priority over the other Meade publications. When Alexis announced {{she was going to}} help get Claire's Hot <b>Flash</b> <b>off</b> the ground, Wilhelmina tricked her into appearing on Alexis' favorite TV show [...] "Live with Regis and Kelly", where she was sabotaged by the two hosts. After Claire scorned her for giving in to Wilhelmina by telling her that she was a puppet, Alexis finally came to her senses when Betty showed her a mock-up of MODE Daniel got by mistake. Alexis, more impressed with her brother's ideas than with Wilhelmina's (especially after seeing her version plummet in sales, along with fan letters from readers sent to Daniel) gave Daniel his former EiC job back, demoting Wilhelmina back to Creative Director.|$|E
50|$|The Gulf linear alpha olefin {{process is}} {{commonly}} called a catalytic Ziegler process. Triethyl aluminium {{is used as}} a catalyst, but in catalytic amounts and the process is a single-step process. Tri-ethyl aluminium and excess ethylene are fed to a plug flow-reactor. The reaction is conducted at high pressure and high temperature. Excess ethylene is <b>flashed</b> <b>off.</b> The tri-ethyl aluminium catalyst is washed out of the product with caustic and the linear alpha olefins are separated. The product distribution is a Schultz-Flory distribution typical of catalytic processes.|$|R
50|$|The current {{light was}} built in 1977, {{although}} the lighthouse station was established 1855. The light sits atop a 9.5 m tall concrete post and emits its light 22 m above sea level. The white, red, or green light (depending on direction) is an occulting light which <b>flashes</b> <b>off</b> once every 6 seconds at an intensity of 4,500 candela. The lighthouse is painted white and the lantern roof is painted red. The present light is located adjacent to the old lighthouse. The site is open to visitors, but the tower is closed.|$|R
50|$|The boiler Drum was a {{pressurised}} {{high tensile}} steel chamber where the water boiled into steam. The water here was pressurised to 170 bar and heated further to 360 °C. On {{the bottom of each}} Drum were six large bore pipes known as Downcomers. These directed the water into the boiler water pipes where it was heated by the furnace. The water was then directed back into the Drum where it <b>flashed</b> <b>off</b> into saturated steam. The steam was then further heated by passing through Primary and Secondary Superheaters until it reached 565 °C. The superheated steam was then piped to the unit turbine.|$|R
40|$|Flash {{memory is}} a {{semiconductor}} memory technology that has interesting price, performance, and semantic tradeoffs. We have developed Gordon, a general-purpose persistence system for Standard ML that uses Flash mapped into the virtual address space as its stable storage medium. Flash supports a write-once/bulk-erase interface {{that makes it}} difficult to support update-inplace semantics. In addition, Flash chips are only guaranteed to survive a limited number of erase cycles. Gordon has been designed to overcome these difficulties, and our performance analysis demonstrates good performance and reasonable lifetimes for appropriate application domains. 1 Introduction Flash RAM is a semiconductor memory that offers interesting new price, performance, and semantic tradeoffs for providing persistent memory in computer systems. Flash has read performance and density comparable to DRAM, but unlike DRAM, data stored in Flash is stable and is not lost on power failure. Compared to disk, <b>Flash</b> <b>off</b> [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The liquid {{carried by}} the {{combined}} drain system mainly contains water, heavy liquid hydrocarbons and mixed light end hydrocarbon gas (VOC) /Acid Gas (e. g. H 2 S mixture). The liquid was routed to a small horizontal pressure vessel to flash-off trapped gas and carryover oil is skimmed in an open sump downstream of the vessel. Increased flow rate to the close drain flash system has decreased the retention time and thus results in adequate flashing of lighter hydrocarbons and acid gas from the closed drain influent coming into the old vessel. This has created a potential environment and safety hazard for the people working around that vessel when the flashing of residual hydrocarbon and acid gas occurs in the sump, which is open to atmosphere. The mitigation of the problem involved designing a large horizontal tank with a heating coil and oil separation chamber, which can provide adequate retention time for the VOC/acid gas to <b>flash</b> <b>off</b> from the influent liquid. The oil chamber will collect hydrocarbon-oil after the de-emulsification process. Mechanical agitation, by using the desanding nozzle, prevents accumulation of sand {{at the bottom of}} the vessel. The project aims at the prevention of the carryover oil with outlet water into the biological process reactor downstream of the new tank. The accumulated oil is analyzed. The oil sample contains species similar to light crude oil. Economic analysis is performed to estimate the revenue obtained from the disposal of spent oil to a third party carrier...|$|E
5000|$|An {{occulting}} light is a rhythmic light {{in which the}} duration of light in each period is longer than the total duration of darkness. In other words, it is the opposite to a flashing light where the total duration of darkness is longer than the duration of light. It has the appearance of <b>flashing</b> <b>off,</b> rather than <b>flashing</b> on. Like a flashing light, {{it can be used}} for a single {{occulting light}} that exhibits only a single period of darkness or the periods of darkness can be grouped and repeated at regular intervals (abbreviated [...] "Oc"), a group (Oc (3)) or a composite group (Oc (2+1)).|$|R

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal Energy Conversion and Management and the definitive published version is available at [URL] carbonisation (HTC) has the capability to convert wet biomass such as sewage sludge to a lignite-like renewable solid fuel of high calorific value. However, to date assessment of the energy efficiency of the HTC process has not been fully investigated. In this work, mass and energy balances of semi-continuous HTC of faecal waste conducted at 200 °C and at a reaction time of 30 min are presented. This analysis is based on recovering steam from the process as well as energy from the solid fuel (hydrochar) and methane from digestion of the liquid product. The effect of the feedstock solids content and the quantity of feed on the mass and energy balance were investigated. The heat of reaction was measured at 200 °C for 4 h using wet faecal sludge, and the higher heating value was determined for the hydrochar. The results indicated that preheating the feed to 100 °C using heat recovered from the process would significantly reduce the energy input to the reactor by about 59 %, and decreased the heat loss from the reactor by between 50 % and 60 %. For feedstocks containing 15 – 25 % solids (for all feed rates), after the process is in operation, energy recycled from the <b>flashing</b> <b>off</b> of steam and combustion of the hydrochar and would be sufficient for preheating the feed, operating the reactor and drying the wet hydrochar {{without the need for}} any external sources of energy. Alternatively, for a feedstock containing 25 % solids for all feed rates, energy recycled from the <b>flashing</b> <b>off</b> of steam and combustion of the methane provides sufficient energy to operate the entire process with an excess energy of about 19 – 21 % which could be used for other purposes...|$|R
