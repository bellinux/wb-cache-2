Baldwin then presented Edward with three choices: give up the idea of marriage; marry against his ministers' wishes; or abdicate. It was clear that Edward was not prepared to give up Simpson, and he <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he married against the advice of his ministers, he would cause the government to resign, prompting a constitutional crisis. He chose to abdicate.|$|E
5|$|Bergonzoli <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> Bardia and Tobruk held out, a British advance {{further into}} Libya {{eventually}} must falter under the logistical difficulties {{of maintaining a}} desert force using an extended overland supply line. Not knowing how long he had to hold out, Bergonzoli was forced to ration his stocks {{of food and water}} so that O'Connor could not simply starve him out. Consequently, hunger and thirst adversely affected the morale of the Italian defenders that had already been shaken by the defeat at Sidi Barrani. So too did medical conditions undermine morale, particularly lice and dysentery, the results of poor sanitation.|$|E
5|$|On December 17, 1851, Henry Clay {{submitted}} {{a letter of}} resignation of his seat in the U.S. Senate, to be effective September 1 of the following year (1852). Clay's announcement came while the Kentucky General Assembly was in session. This was intentional. The majority of the Assembly was Whig, and Clay <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he resigned while the Assembly was in session, the majority would elect a Whig to be his successor. By contrast, if he had waited until September 1 to announce his resignation the Assembly would already have closed its session, and Governor Powell, a Democrat, would appoint a temporary successor until the legislature convened again two years later.|$|E

5|$|General Buford {{recognized}} the importance of the high ground directly to the south of Gettysburg. He <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the Confederates could gain control of the heights, Meade's army {{would have a hard time}} dislodging them. He decided to utilize three ridges west of Gettysburg: Herr Ridge, McPherson Ridge, and Seminary Ridge (proceeding west to east toward the town). These were appropriate terrain for a delaying action by his small division against superior Confederate infantry forces, meant to buy time awaiting the arrival of Union infantrymen who could occupy the strong defensive positions south of town, Cemetery Hill, Cemetery Ridge, and Culp's Hill. Early that morning, Reynolds, who was commanding the Left Wing of the Army of the Potomac, ordered his corps to march to Buford's location, with the XI Corps (Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard) to follow closely behind.|$|E
5|$|Pulos and Hutt <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the allele {{that created}} a white coat was recessive, then white horses {{would have to be}} {{homozygous}} for the condition and therefore breeding white horses together would always result in a white foal. However, this did not occur in their study and they concluded that white was not recessive. Conversely, if a white coat was a simple autosomal dominant, ww horses would be non-white, while both Ww and WW horses would be white, and the latter would always produce white offspring. But Pulos and Hutt did not observe any white horses that always produced white offspring, suggesting that homozygous dominant (WW) white horses did not exist. As a result, Pulos and Hutt concluded that white was semidominant and lethal in the homozygous state: ww horses were non-white, Ww were white, and WW died.|$|E

The website contained numerous death threats directed against Brown: Klebold <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> Brooks accessed the address, he would discover the content and inform his parents, and likely the authorities would be notified. After Brown's parents viewed the site, they contacted the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office. The investigator Michael Guerra was told about the website. When he accessed it, Guerra discovered numerous violent threats directed against the students and teachers of Columbine High School. Other material included blurbs that Harris had written about his general hatred of society, and his desire to kill those who annoyed him.|$|E

This is why he ordered to the IV. (reserve) corps to start a counterattack against the Hungarian troops in the next day. Csorich's II. corps and Panyutyin's division were appointed to sustain the attack of the reserve corps. Wohlgemuth ordered to his troops stationed at Sempte and Szered, to destroy the bridge between the two villages, and to come to help his main troops. The Panyutyin division was placed on the left flank of Wohlgemuth's IV. (reserve) corps. Wohlgemuth's main goal was to cut the retreat route of the Hungarians, and therefore units of his troops occupied the village of Királyrév, through which the main Hungarian forces could return to the bridge from Aszódpuszta.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after 6:00pm, {{word spread}} at Fort Tiuna that Chávez-loyalist General Carneiro was still seeking to {{implement}} Plan Ávila. Head {{of the army}} General Efraín Vásquez Velasco was meeting at the Army School with other officers concerned about Chávez's use of violence when Chávez ordered General Carneiro, one of Vásquez Velasco's subordinates, {{to go ahead with}} Plan Ávila. Vásquez Velasco, who founded the Office of Human Rights of the Venezuelan Army, <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the plan were implemented that he would be blamed since he {{was the head of the}} army. Soon after, General Vásquez Velasco learned that General Carneiro did not comply with his orders and was sending about 20 tanks to Miraflores to support Chávez. Vásquez Velasco called the tank commander ordering him to return with the commander complying with the general. General Vásquez Velasco then ordered a nationwide military lockdown with military movements requiring written documentation and approval, a move by Vásquez Velasco that was to prevent troops loyal to Chávez from suppressing the march and would also deter rebellious attacks from the military against Chávez. Vásquez Velasco then ordered the Chávez-loyalist General Carneiro be arrested before he could arrest the other officers under Chávez's orders, but Carneiro complied with Vásquez Velasco.|$|E
25|$|Before the 161st Indian Brigade arrived, {{the only}} {{fighting}} {{troops in the}} Kohima area were the newly raised 1st Battalion, the Assam Regiment and a few platoons from the 3rd (Naga Hills) Battalion of the paramilitary Assam Rifles. Late in March 161st Brigade deployed in Kohima, but Major-General Ranking ordered them back to Dimapur, as it was felt initially that Dimapur had more strategic importance. Kohima {{was regarded as a}} roadblock, while Dimapur was the railhead where the majority of Allied supplies were stored. Slim also feared that the Japanese might leave only a detachment to contain the garrison of Kohima while {{the main body of the}} 31st Division moved by tracks to the east to attack Dimapur. To Slim's relief, Sato concentrated on capturing Kohima. (Early in the siege, on 8 April, Mutaguchi directly ordered Sato to send a detachment to advance on Dimapur. Sato unwillingly dispatched a battalion of the 138th Regiment but a few hours later Mutaguchi's superior, Lieutenant General Masakasu Kawabe commanding Burma Area Army, vetoed the move.) Slim chose to gamble that Indian 5th Division could hold Kohima alone, in order to concentrate on the relief of Imphal, through he <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the Japanese took Kohima, they would be able to sever the Assam railroad at Dimapur, which would cut off the 14th Army from its main source of supplies.|$|E

25|$|I {{was saved}} {{from the gas}} chambers, saved from Hitler. I spent several years in Nazi death camps. Besides {{the fact that they}} murdered my wife and 11 children, my mother, my sisters and my brother – of my whole family, some 150 people, I {{was the only one who}} survived – I {{witnessed}} their cruelty.

Then I cut a branch and tied it around the wound to hold it in place. With God's help, it healed in three days. Then I promised myself that if, with God's help, I got well and got out of there, away from those resha'im (wicked people), I would build a hospital in Eretz Yisrael where every human being would be cared for with dignity. And the basis of that hospital would be that the doctors and nurses would believe that there is a God in this world and that when they treat a patient, they are fulfilling the greatest mitzvah in the Torah.|$|E
25|$|The large troop {{movements}} these withdrawals and reinforcements required caused a substantial reorganisation of the EEF. Until September, when Allenby's force {{would be completely}} reformed and retrained, {{it would not be}} in a position to successfully attack both the Transjordan on the right and the Plain of Sharon on the left as well as continuing to hold the centre in the Judean Hills. In the meantime, it seemed essential to occupy the Transjordan to establish closer ties with Britain's important Arab ally, Feisal and the Hejaz Arabs. Until direct contact was made, Allenby could not completely support this force and he <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> Feisal was defeated, German and Ottoman forces could turn the whole length of the EEF's right flank. This would make their hard-won positions shaky all the way to Jerusalem, and could result in a humiliating withdrawal, possibly to Egypt. Apart from the extremely important military ramifications of such a loss of captured territory, the political fallout could include a negative effect on the Egyptian population, upon whose cooperation the British war effort relied heavily. Allenby hoped that a series of attacks into the hills of Moab could turn Ottoman attention away from the Plain of Sharon, north of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast, to the important railway junction at Daraa which, if captured by T.E. Lawrence and Feisal, would seriously dislocate the Ottoman railway and lines of communication in Palestine.|$|E
25|$|When Augustus died in 14 AD, the Principate legally ended. While Augustus had granted Tiberius {{the legal}} {{standing}} {{that he needed}} in order to become Princeps (i.e., Roman Emperor), Augustus could not legally make Tiberius Princeps.

Therefore, Tiberius assumed command of the Praetorian Guard, and used his Proconsular imperium to force the armies to swear allegiance to him.

Tiberius' efforts were so successful, that when the senate declared him Princeps, he made his acceptance appear to be a concession {{to the demands of the}} senators. Under Tiberius, the power to elect magistrates was transferred from the assemblies to the senate. Now, the assemblies were only used to hear the results of magisterial elections. In addition, they did retain some theoretical legislative powers. When Tiberius died, Caligula was proclaimed emperor by the senate. Caligula transferred the electoral powers back to the assemblies, but then quickly returned those powers to the senate. In 41 Caligula was assassinated, and for two days following his assassination, the senate debated the merits of restoring the republic. Due to the demands of the army, however, Claudius was ultimately declared emperor. Claudius' antiquarian interests resulted in his attempts to revive the old Censorship, and to return some degree of independence back to the senate.
