40|$|The {{ability of}} poxviruses to undergo {{intramolecular}} recombination within tandemly arranged homologous sequences {{can be used}} to generate chimeric genes and proteins. Genes containing regions of nucleotide homology will recombine to yield a single sequence composed of portions of both original genes. A recombinant virus containing two genes with a number of conserved regions will yield a population of recombinant viruses containing a spectrum of hybrid sequences derived by recombination between the original genes. This scheme has been used to generate hybrid human immunodeficiency virus type 1 env genes. Recombinant vaccinia viruses that contain two divergent env genes in tandem array have been constructed.

50|$|Terminal deoxynucleotidyl {{transferase}} (TdT), {{also known}} as DNA nucleotidylexotransferase (DNTT) or terminal transferase, is a specialized DNA polymerase expressed in immature, pre-B, pre-T lymphoid cells, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma cells. TdT adds N-nucleotides to the V, D, and J exons of the TCR and BCR genes during antibody <b>gene</b> <b>recombination,</b> enabling the phenomenon of junctional diversity. In humans, terminal transferase is encoded by the DNTT gene. As {{a member of the}} X family of DNA polymerase enzymes, it works in conjunction with polymerase λ and polymerase μ, both of which belong to the same X family of polymerase enzymes. The diversity introduced by TdT has {{played an important role in}} the evolution of the vertebrate immune system, significantly increasing the variety of antigen receptors that a cell is equipped with to fight pathogens. Studies using TdT knockout mice have found drastic reductions (10-fold) in T-cell receptor (TCR) diversity compared with that of normal, or wild-type, systems. The greater diversity of TCRs that an organism is equipped with leads to greater resistance to infection.|$|E
50|$|The genome {{structures}} of phycodnaviruses have considerable variation. The chlorovirus PBCV-1 has a linear 330 kb genome with non-permuted dsDNA that is covalently closed by hairpin termini. Similarly, the EsV-1 phaeovirus has a linear dsDNA genome with inverted repeats that have almost perfect homology. These inverted repeats could facilitate effective circularization {{of the genome}} and {{for a period of}} time it has been suspected that EsV-1 has a circular genome. The EhV-86 coccolithovirus is suggested to have both linear and circular genomes at different phases during DNA packaging. PCR amplification reveals random A/T overhangs, detection of DNA ligases and endonucleases hinting that a linear genome may be packaged and circularizes during DNA replication. The phycodnaviruses have compact genomes for replication efficiency with approximately one gene per 900 to 1000 bp of genome sequences. The EsV-1 phaeovirus is an exception with 231 protein encoding genes, which means it has one gene per approximately 1450 bp. In spite of the compact genomes typically found in viruses, Phycodnaviridae genomes have repetitive regions usually near the terminal ends and certain tandem repeats located throughout the genome. It is suggested that these repetitive sequences may play a role in <b>gene</b> <b>recombination</b> that allows the virus to exchange genetic information with other viruses or the host cell.|$|E
40|$|T cell {{lymphopoiesis}} involves extensive {{cell division}} and differentiation; these must be balanced by export and {{programmed cell death}} to maintain thymic homeostasis. Details regarding {{the nature of these}} processes, as well as their relationships {{to each other and to}} the definitive process of T cell receptor (TCR) <b>gene</b> <b>recombination,</b> are presently emerging. Two widely held concepts are that cell cycle status is inherently and inversely linked to <b>gene</b> <b>recombination</b> and that the outcomes of <b>gene</b> <b>recombination</b> regulate developmental progression. In this study, we analyze TCR- � recombination and cell cycle status with respect to differentiation during early T cell ontogeny. We find that although differentiation, cell cycle fluctuations, and <b>gene</b> <b>recombination</b> are coincident during normal T cell development, differentiation and cell cycle status are not inherently linked to the recombination process or its products. Rather, recombination appears to occur in parallel with these events as part of a genetically patterned program of development. We propose that the outcome of <b>gene</b> <b>recombination</b> (i. e., TCR expression) may not influence developmental progression per se, but instead serves to perpetuate those developing cells that have been successful in recombination. The potential consequences of this model for the regulation of thymic lymphopoiesis and programmed cell death are discussed...|$|E

Three alleles, ssE, ssS and ssC, are associated, respectively, with the three wild types Emerson, St. Lawrence 74 A and Costa Rica A. It is proposed that ss (synaptic sequence) <b>genes</b> modulate <b>recombination</b> by determining the pairing closeness of DNA duplexes {{in the vicinity of}} the nit- 2 locus. When heterozygous, ss suppresses recombination 2 - to 20 -fold within the nit- 2 locus, which it adjoins, but crossing over in intervals flanking nit- 2 is not affected. The magnitude of suppression depends upon the ss alleles involved, and ss acts multiplicatively with rec- 1; together, these <b>genes</b> modulate <b>recombination</b> within the nit- 2 locus over a range exceeding 100 -fold. The ss effect is not attributable to gross chromosomal rearrangement, but could be due to small inversions or insertions, such as transposable elements...|$|R

However, analyses of the ABC- 1 line indicate that pre-B cells that have initiated lambda <b>gene</b> <b>recombination</b> do not terminate kappa gene rearrangement. The lambda gene recombinations that occur in the ABC- 1 cell line indicate that the germline order of lambda gene segments is: 5 ' [...] . V lambda 2 [...] .

In addition, the frequencies of lambda 1, lambda 2, and lambda 3 gene recombinations among ABC- 1 cells are quite different than the frequencies of B cells producing lambda 1, lambda 2, and lambda 3 L- chains in the mouse. RS DNA recombinations also occur in the BM 18 - 4 and ABC- 1 cell lines, supporting the notion that Ig gene recombinases are involved in RS rearrangement. Recombined RS segments are infrequent among BM 18 - 4 cells but common among ABC- 1 cells, suggesting that RS recombinational events often occur in maturing pre-B cells just before initiation of lambda gene rearrangements. This developmental timing is consistent with the hypothesis that RS recombination may be involved in the initiation of lambda gene assembly...|$|E

In yeast <b>genes,</b> <b>recombination</b> (conversion) is polarized, being higher {{at the end of}} the <b>gene</b> where <b>recombination</b> is presumably initiated. We have analyzed products of meiotic recombination between heteroallelic pairs of bz mutations in both the presence and absence of heterologies and have sequenced the recombination junction in 130 such Bz intragenic recombinants. We have found that in the absence of heterologies, recombination is proportional to physical distance across the bz gene. The simplest interpretation for this lack of polarity is that recombination is initiated randomly within the gene. lnsertion mutations affect the frequency and distribution of intragenic recombination events at bz, creating hotspots and coldspots. Single base pair heterologies also affect recombination, with fewer recombination events than expected by chance occurring in regions of the bz gene with a high density of heterologies.

The transcript levels of the <b>recombination</b> <b>genes</b> RAD 51 and RAD 54, which have MCB elements, were reduced in Delta swi 6 cells.

40|$|Theories on the {{evolution}} and maintenance of sex are challenged by the existence of ancient asexual lineages like bdelloid rotifers and darwinulid ostracods. Ancient asexual origin of several speciose taxa has also been proposed for oribatid mites (Acari). In the present work, I analysed genetic divergences in different parthenogenetic and sexual lineages of oribatid mites to estimate the age of these lineages and to evaluate if {{the evolution}} of oribatid mites was without recombination. Age estimations were based on genetic distances of the mitochondrial gene for cytochrome oxidase I (COI) between clonal lineages of different parthenogenetic oribatid mite species. Species from two parthenogenetic taxa (Platynothrus peltifer, P. yamasakii, P. sibiricus, Heminothrus thori and Camisia horrida (Camisiidae) and Mucronothrus nasalis (Trhypochthoniidae)) were sampled in different sites in Europe, North America, South America, Australia and Asia. Corrected distances reached up to 157 % on DNA level and 10 % on amino acid level. Using different calibrations for a molecular clock, an age of up to 240 million years since {{the separation of the}} lineages was estimated. With this age, oribatid mites contain the oldest living parthenogenetic metazoan taxa. Further analyses investigated if the high evolutionary age of Platynothrus and other oribatid mite taxa (Mucronothrus nasalis, Tectocepheus velatus, Atropacarus striculus, Steganacarus magnus and Metabelba pulverulenta) was attained without <b>gene</b> <b>recombination.</b> To address this question, the two alleles of the hsp 82 gene (coding for the 82 KD heat shock protein) were analysed for their genetic divergence. Due to <b>gene</b> <b>recombination,</b> sexual species in general have maximum divergences of 4 % for this gene; higher amounts of divergence indicate absence of <b>gene</b> <b>recombination</b> as expected for parthenogenetic organisms. Genetic distances were up to 70 % on DNA level and 15 % on amino acid level indicating ancient lack of recombination. The absence of recombination in hsp 82 was estimated to have happened 350 million years ago. The amount of genetic divergences between the alleles was in the same range in sexual and asexual oribatid mite species. High allelic divergence between hsp 82 alleles in sexual and asexual species may be explained by the special mechanism of inheritance in oribatid mites: chromosomes are holokinetic and inverted meiosis has been inferred. If inverted meiosis occurs together with chiasma terminalisation <b>gene</b> <b>recombination</b> is suppressed in both sexual and parthenogenetic species. Together with terminal fusion in parthenogenetic species this mechanism resembles mitotic cloning. Inverted meiosis is a simple form of meiosis and it is discussed if this mechanism might be ancestral to “normal” meiosis. A scenario is proposed on how “normal” meiosis and monocentric chromosomes evolved from inverted meiosis and holokinetic chromosomes. Particular conditions may favour the frequent independent evolution and persistence of parthenogenetic clusters in oribatid mites. The absence of <b>gene</b> <b>recombination</b> in sexual and asexual oribatid mite species for at least 350 million years and the evolution of perhaps 100, 000 oribatid mite species without <b>gene</b> <b>recombination</b> is an evolutionary mystery contradicting theories on sex and recombination and is unique in the animal kingdom...|$|E

In this method, exons or combinations of exons that encode protein domains are amplified by PCR using mixtures of chimeric oligonucleotides that determine which exons are spliced together.
