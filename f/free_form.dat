5|$|LARP {{has also}} been {{referred}} to as live role-playing (LRP), interactive literature, and <b>free</b> <b>form</b> role-playing. Some of these terms are still in common use; however, LARP has become the most commonly accepted term. It is sometimes written in lowercase, as larp. The live action in LARP is analogous to the term live action used in film and video to differentiate works with human actors from animation. Playing a LARP is often called larping, and one who does it is a larper.|$|E
5|$|Confusion is a one-song Afrobeat {{album that}} begins with an entirely {{instrumental}} first half, which features <b>free</b> <b>form</b> interplay between Kuti's electric piano and drummer Tony Allen. It leads to an extended mid-tempo section with Allen's polyrhythms and tenor saxophone by Kuti, who subsequently delivers call-and-response vocal passages. In reviews since the record's release by EMI, the album was praised by music critics, who found it exemplary of Kuti's Afrobeat style and recommended it as a highlight from his extensive catalog. In both 2000 and 2010, Confusion was reissued and bundled with Kuti's 1973 Gentleman album.|$|E
25|$|He {{recorded}} three albums in this vein, <b>Free</b> <b>Form</b> (Jazzland 1960), Abstract (Columbia (UK) 1962) and Movement (Columbia (UK) 1963). Abstract {{received a}} five star review from Harvey Pekar in Down Beat, {{the first such}} honour for a British Jazz record. <b>Free</b> <b>Form</b> and Abstract together formed a perfect pair of cohesive, trailblazing free jazz sessions. The next album, Movement, featured {{some of his most}} fiercely abstract compositions, but these were tempered by some other, more straight-ahead pieces.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} the contents {{and forms of}} sodium(Na) and potassium(K) in tissues of marine fishes. The results were as follows: 1. The contents of Na and K in muscles of 27 species were 70. 0 ～ 564, 3 mg% and 144. 6 ～ 411. 3 mg% respectively. The relation of Na<K was observed in 25 species {{but not in the}} other 2 species. The contents of Na and K in viscera were 115. 2 ～ 244. 1 mg% and 133. 5 ～ 242. 7 mg% respectively. 2. We distinguished <b>free</b> <b>forms</b> from bound forms in muscle homogenate by 10 % trichloroacetic acid treatment. The ratios of <b>free</b> <b>forms</b> to bound forms varied by fish species. Percentages of <b>free</b> <b>forms</b> to total were 51. 7 —～ 63. 1 % for Na and 77. 5 - 85. 7 % for K, <b>free</b> <b>forms</b> occupying more than a half. The relation of Na<K was maintained in <b>free</b> <b>forms</b> as well. 3. In the investigation by centrifugal fractionation of muscle homogenate of Kidai (Taius tumifrons), the precipitate by 10 miniute centrifugation at 1, 500 rpm showed that 31. 6 % of Na and 11. 4 % of K were in bound forms, which were maximum values for bound forms among all fractions. On the other hand, 52. 8 % of Na and 76. 3 % of K were in <b>free</b> <b>forms.</b> 海産魚類中のNaおよびKの含量ならびに筋肉中の存在形態について検討した。 1. 27 種の魚類筋肉中のNaおよびKの含量はそれぞれ 70. 0 ～ 564. 3 mg%, 144. 6 ～ 411. 3 mg%であり, 2 種を除いた 25 種についてはNa<Kの関係がみられた。 10 種の魚類内臓中のNaおよびKの含量はそれぞれ 115. 2 ～ 244. 1 mg%, 133. 5 ～ 242. 7 mg%であった。 2. 筋肉の水によるホモジネートに 10 %トリクロル酢酸を加えて,遠心分離(3, 000 rpm, 5 分間) して得た上澄液(遊離型) と沈澱部(結合型) 中に含まれるNaおよびKの割合は魚種によって差異が認められた。遊離型NaおよびK量はそれぞれ 51. 7 ～ 63. 1 %, 77. 5 ～ 85. 7 %を示し,組織中では大部分が遊離型であり,Na<Kの関係を示した。 3. キダイ筋肉中の結合型NaおよびKの存在様式を遠心分離法によって得た各々の画分について検討した結果, 1, 500 rpm, 10 分間による沈澱画分中のNaおよびKはそれぞれ 31. 6 %, 11. 4 %を示し,沈降性画分の中では最大値を示した。また遊離型はNaおよびKについてそれぞれ 52. 8 %, 76, 3 %を示した...|$|R

25|$|The best {{method of}} {{prevention}} is to each food rich in B3. Generally, this involves the intake of a protein-rich diet. Foods that contain high concentrations of niacin in the <b>free</b> <b>form</b> include beans and organ meat, as well as enriched grain and cereal products. While niacin is present in corn and other grains, the bioavailability of the nutrient is much less {{than it is in}} protein-rich sources. Different methods of processing corn may result in a higher degree of bioavailability of the vitamin.|$|E
25|$|Chlorophyll {{itself is}} bound to {{proteins}} and can transfer the absorbed energy in the required direction. Protochlorophyllide, however, occurs mostly in the <b>free</b> <b>form</b> and, under light conditions, acts as a photosensitizer, forming highly toxic free radicals. Hence, plants need an efficient mechanism of regulating the amount of chlorophyll precursor. In angiosperms, this is done at the step of δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), one of the intermediate compounds in the biosynthetic pathway. Plants that are fed by ALA accumulate high and toxic levels of protochlorophyllide, as do mutants with a disrupted regulatory system.|$|E
30|$|While {{there were}} many reports about the {{delivery}} of different drugs in nanoparticles conjugated form, little or no efforts were made, so far, to determine the efficiency, stability of antibiotics conjugated with Gnps in vitro. In this study, we compared the efficiency and stability of Gnps conjugated antibiotics {{with respect to their}} <b>free</b> <b>forms</b> in vitro. We found that the MIC of Gnps conjugated ampicillin, streptomycin and kanamycin onEscherichia coli DH 5 α(Microbial type culture collection (MTCC) No. 1652, India),Micrococcus luteus(MTCC No. 106) andStaphylococcus aureus(MTCC No. 96) were reduced when compared to their respective unconjugated <b>free</b> <b>forms.</b> Moreover, the activity of all Gnps conjugated antibiotics showed higher stability compared to their corresponding <b>free</b> <b>forms.</b> Thus our results suggest that antibiotics conjugated with Gnps might be used in therapy for their greater efficiency and stability.|$|R

25|$|In {{particle}} physics, the Dirac {{equation is}} a relativistic wave equation derived by British physicist Paul Dirac in 1928. In its <b>free</b> <b>form,</b> or including electromagnetic interactions, it describes all spin- massive particles such as electrons and quarks for which parity is a symmetry. It {{is consistent with}} both the principles of quantum mechanics and the theory of special relativity, {{and was the first}} theory to account fully for special relativity in the context of quantum mechanics. It was validated by accounting for the fine details of the hydrogen spectrum in a completely rigorous way.|$|E
25|$|NMR {{spectroscopy}} is nucleus specific. Thus it {{can distinguish}} between hydrogen and deuterium. The amide protons in the protein exchange readily with the solvent, and, if the solvent contains a different isotope, typically deuterium, the reaction can be monitored by NMR spectroscopy. How rapidly a given amide exchanges reflects its solvent accessibility. Thus amide exchange rates can give information on which {{parts of the}} protein are buried, hydrogen bonded etc. A common application is to compare the exchange of a <b>free</b> <b>form</b> versus a complex. The amides that become protected in the complex, {{are assumed to be}} in the interaction interface.|$|E
25|$|Harriott's free-form {{compositions}} normally formed only {{a portion}} of live gigs. Indeed, the final album recorded by the quintet, 1964's High Spirits (Columbia), was a straight-ahead jazz interpretation of compositions from the musical of that name, which was based on the Noël Coward play Blithe Spirit. However, the continuing hostility of the older British jazz establishment to <b>free</b> <b>form,</b> and the drying up of recording and performance opportunities, saw Harriott's quintet cease to be sustainable in the changing musical climate of mid-1960s Britain. The quintet effectively broke up when Shake Keane moved to Germany in 1965. From this point onwards, Harriott worked freelance on a number of projects.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{contrastive}} survey of a morpheme originally meaning ‘giant’ in German and Swedish. In both languages, this morpheme has developed into a prefixoid with simile or intensifying meaning. More recently, these prefixoids {{have been shown to}} occur as free morphemes as well, and it is {{the purpose of this paper}} to explore whether a quantitative analysis of synchronic corpus data can be used to determine whether the <b>free</b> <b>forms</b> are spelling variants, or whether they are truly new constructions that are the result of debonding. Drawing data from the COW corpus of contemporary web text, we compare bound and <b>free</b> <b>forms</b> on the levels of R 1 collocations, semantic bleaching, and productivity. Our analysis suggests that the German prefixoid has undergone debonding, whereas the Swedish <b>free</b> <b>forms</b> are mere spelling variants...|$|R

25|$|Harriott's profile {{has also}} been helped by CD reissues of his most {{important}} albums, notably Abstract, <b>Free</b> <b>Form</b> and Movement. However, other key albums such as Hum-Dono {{have yet to be}} reissued. In recent years, other recordings of Harriott in his prime have surfaced. Michael Garrick has compiled and released a CD on his own Jazz Academy label, entitled Genius. This consists of some early 1960s live performances and home recordings made with a pianist friend, William Haig-Joyce. In 2006, a 1963 live recording made at a small club in Leicester was unearthed and issued on CD, entitled Live At Harry's. In early 2007, many of his hard-to-find mid-1950s sessions, both as leader and sideman, were made available on the double-CD compilation Killer Joe.|$|E
25|$|Lilla Cabot Perry (January 13, 1848 – February 28, 1933) was an American {{artist who}} worked in the American Impressionist style, {{rendering}} portraits and landscapes in the <b>free</b> <b>form</b> manner of her mentor, Claude Monet. Perry was an early advocate of the French Impressionist style and contributed to its reception in the United States. Perry's early work was shaped by her exposure to the Boston School of artists and her travels in Europe and Japan. She was also greatly influenced by Ralph Waldo Emerson's philosophies and her friendship with Camille Pissarro. Although {{it was not until the}} age of thirty-six that Perry received formal training, her work with artists of the Impressionist, Realist, Symbolist, and German Social Realist movements greatly affected the style of her oeuvre.|$|E

25|$|The comic book's {{publishing}} {{was started}} in 1972 by the state-owned company Vjesnik from Zagreb. This edition is still a popular collectors' item. First dozen issues didn't produce much success, however, the appearance in issue #25 of antagonist Superciuk (translated as Superhik) 'who steals from the poor and gives it to the rich' proved a hit with Yugoslav readership. Also, {{a lot of the}} comic book's success in Yugoslavia is due to Nenad Brixy's (born 1924 in Varaždinske Toplice) distinctive translation, rich in obscure, baroque-sounding Croatisms. A writer himself who penned several comedic novels about the clumsy detective character called Timothy Tacher, Brixy approached the job of translating Alan Ford in a <b>free</b> <b>form</b> and the resulting witty adaptation and imaginative text soon won him many admirers across the country.|$|E
25|$|Pāṇini's {{systematic}} approach to analysis includes components for: (a) forming grammatical rules, (b) {{an inventory of}} sounds, (c) a list of verbal roots organized into sublists, and (d) a list of classes of morphs. Bloomfield's approach to key linguistic ideas in his textbook Language reflect the influence of Pāṇini in his treatment of basic concepts such as linguistic form, <b>free</b> <b>form,</b> and others. Similarly, Pāṇini is the source for Bloomfield's use of the terms exocentric and endocentric used to describe compound words. Concepts from Pāṇini are found in Eastern Ojibwa, published posthumously in 1958, in particular {{his use of the}} concept of a morphological zero, a morpheme that has no overt realization. Pāṇini's influence is also present in Bloomfield's approach to determining parts of speech (Bloomfield uses the term 'form-classes') in both Eastern Ojibwa and in the later Menomini language, published posthumously in 1962.|$|E
