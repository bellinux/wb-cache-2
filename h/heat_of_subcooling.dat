Future missions may require vehicles to remain in space for months, necessitating long-term storage of these cryogens. A Thermodynamic Cryogen Subcooler (TCS) can ease the challenge of cryogenic fluid storage by removing energy from the cryogenic propellant through isobaric <b>subcooling</b> <b>of</b> the cryogen below its normal boiling point prior to launch. The isobaric <b>subcooling</b> <b>of</b> the cryogenic propellant will be performed by using a cold pressurant to maintain the tank pressure while the cryogen's temperature is simultaneously reduced using the TCS. The TCS hardware will be integrated into the launch infrastructure {{and there will be no}} significant addition to the launched dry mass. Heat leaks into all cryogenic propellant tanks, despite the use of the best insulation systems. However, the large heat capacity available in the subcooled cryogenic propellants allows the energy that leaks into the tank to be absorbed until the cryogen reaches its operational thermodynamic condition. During this period <b>of</b> <b>heating</b> <b>of</b> the <b>subcooled</b> cryogen there will be minimal loss of the propellant due to venting for pressure control. This simple technique can extend the operational life of a spacecraft or an orbital cryogenic depot for months with minimal mass penalty.

A TCS for cryogenic propellants would thus provide an enhanced level of mission flexibility. Advances in the important components of the TCS will be discussed in this paper...|$|R

The number and size distribution of cavities present on a heater surface affect the nucleation characteristics.

The present study investigates the flow boiling <b>heat</b> transfer <b>of</b> <b>subcooled</b> water over heater surfaces prepared with different roughness characteristics. The setup consists of a 9. 5 mm diameter circular heater placed on the lower wall of a 3 mm x 40 mm horizontal channel. Four different surface finishes are tested on the same heater unit. Each surface is observed under a microscope, and analyzed with an image processing software to obtain the cavity size distribution. Relationships between the cavity size distribution and the heat transfer are then compared for the four surfaces. The results indicate that the wall superheats for the four surfaces tested were within 0 - 30 percent of each other for a given heat flux. Although the roughest surface generally performed the best, no definite trend could be observed. It is also noted that the cavity size distribution of a surface is not significantly affected by simple polishing techniques. A commercially prepared sintered surface is also tested.

Predicted heat transfer coefficients (HTC) are widely used for calculations <b>of</b> various <b>heat</b> transfer processes. Various empirical and semi-empirical models of non-dimensional groups are used for calculating the heat transfer coefficients. The common accuracy <b>of</b> the predicted <b>heat</b> transfer coefficient is usually about ± 25 %; however, the accuracy is failing by the inaccurate predictions of the fluid properties. In the present study the <b>heat</b> transfer coefficient <b>of</b> <b>subcooled</b> organic mixture chlorodifluoromethane (R 22) - dimethylacetamide (DMAC) were predicted. While the solution’s pressure-temperature-concentration, densitytemperature- concentration and viscosity-temperatureconcentration relations were previously measured in our laboratory and the heat capacity were calculated from the enthalpy of the solution, the only unknown property that was required for predicting the HTC was the mixture thermal conductivity. Various correlations and mixing rules for the mixture thermal conductivity were adopted for predicting the heat transfer coefficient. In order to validate the predicted heat transfer coefficients, an experimental system was designed, built and successfully operated. The heat transfer coefficient was measured experimentally and compared with the predicted one. Based on this comparison the best fitted thermal conductivity for the working fluid (R 22 -DMAC) is recommended.

Implosive bubble formation and collapse are the main nature <b>of</b> <b>subcooled</b> boiling, and their behaviors are the only sources to originate from SBIV. Therefore, in order to explain the phenomenon of SBIV, it is essential to obtain reliable information about bubble behavior in subcooled boiling conditions.

High speed photography at 13, 500 frames per second was performed at these conditions. The results show that even at the highest subcooling condition, the absolute majority of bubbles collapse very close to the surface after detaching from the heating surface. Based on these observations, a simple model of surface tension and momentum change is introduced to offer a rough quantitative estimate of the force exerted on the heating surface during the bubble ebullition.

It {{was found that the}} phase change heat flux (i. e. the difference between the flux of evaporation and the flux of condensation) and the total heat flux (measured with fluxmeter and due to convection, conduction and phase change) decreased in the same order of magnitude when the level <b>of</b> <b>subcooling</b> was increased. When the heating power increased, the total heat flux increased whereas the phase change heat flux varied in a nonsignificant way. It was also found that the total heat flux depends on the nucleation surface inclination, whereas, for small angles, the phase change heat flux didn't change. The analysis of those results lead to the conclusion that during boiling the liquid motions due to the bubble growth and departure {{play an important role in}} the heat transfer enhancement...|$|R
