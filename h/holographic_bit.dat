40|$|Wavelength {{multiplexed}} <b>holographic</b> <b>bit</b> oriented {{memories are}} serious competitors for high capacity data storage systems. For data recording, two interfering beams are required whereas {{one of them}} should be blocked for readout in previously proposed systems. This makes the system complex. To circumvent this difficulty and make the device simpler, we validated an architecture for such memories in which the same two beams are used for recording and reading out. This balanced homodyne scheme is validated by recording holograms in a Lippmann architecture...|$|E
40|$|The Standard Model (SM) is a {{successful}} approach to particle physics calculations. However, {{there are indications that}} the SM is only a good approximation to an underlying non-local reality involving fundamental entities (preons) that are not point particles. Furthermore, our universe seems to be dominated by a vacuum energy/cosmological constant. The holographic principle then indicates only a finite number of bits of information will ever be available to describe the observable universe, and that requires a holographic preon model linking the (0, 1) <b>holographic</b> <b>bits</b> to SM particles. All SM particles have charges 0, 1 / 3, 2 / 3 or 1 in units of the electron charge, so the <b>bits</b> in a <b>holographic</b> preon model must be identified with fractional electric charge. Such holographic charged preon models require baryon asymmetry and also suggest a mechanism for stationary action. This paper outlines a holographic charged preon model where preons are strands with finite energy density specified by bits of information identifying the charge on each end. In the model, SM particles consist of three strands with spin states corresponding to wrapped states of the strands. SM particles in this wrapped preon model can be approximated by preon bound states in non-local dynamics based on three-preon Bethe-Salpeter equations with instantaneous three-preon interactions. The model can be falsified by data from the Large Hadron Collider because it generates baryon asymmetry without axions, and does not allow more than three generations of SM fermions.
