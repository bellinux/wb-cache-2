5|$|In {{areas where}} there is little iodine in the diet, {{typically}} remote inland areas and semi-arid equatorial climates where no marine foods are eaten, <b>iodine</b> <b>deficiency</b> gives rise to hypothyroidism, symptoms of which are extreme fatigue, goitre, mental slowing, depression, weight gain, and low basal body temperatures. <b>Iodine</b> <b>deficiency</b> {{is the leading cause}} of preventable intellectual disability, a result that occurs primarily when babies or small children are rendered hypothyroidic by a lack of the element. The addition of iodine to table salt has largely eliminated this problem in the wealthier nations, but <b>iodine</b> <b>deficiency</b> remains a serious public health problem today in the developing world. <b>Iodine</b> <b>deficiency</b> is also a problem in certain areas of Europe. Information processing, fine motor skills, and visual problem solving are improved by iodine repletion in moderately iodine-deficient children.|$|E
5|$|Hypothyroidism may be {{prevented}} {{in a population}} by adding iodine to commonly used foods. This public health measure has eliminated endemic childhood hypothyroidism in countries where it was once common. In addition to promoting the consumption of iodine-rich foods such as dairy and fish, many countries with moderate <b>iodine</b> <b>deficiency</b> have implemented universal salt iodization (USI). Encouraged by the World Health Organization, 130 countries now have USI, and 70% of the world's population are receiving iodized salt. In some countries, iodized salt is added to bread. Despite this, <b>iodine</b> <b>deficiency</b> has reappeared in some Western countries {{as a result of}} attempts to reduce salt intake.|$|E
5|$|The thyroid may be {{affected}} by several diseases. Hyperthyroidism occurs when the gland produces excessive amounts of thyroid hormones, {{the most common cause}} being Graves' disease — an autoimmune disorder. In contrast, hypothyroidism is a state of insufficient thyroid hormone production. Worldwide, the most common cause is <b>iodine</b> <b>deficiency.</b> Thyroid hormones are important for development, and hypothyroidism secondary to <b>iodine</b> <b>deficiency</b> remains the leading cause of preventable intellectual disability. In iodine-sufficient regions, {{the most common cause of}} hypothyroidism is Hashimoto's thyroiditis—also an autoimmune disease. In addition, the thyroid gland may also develop several types of nodules and cancer.|$|E
40|$|Selenium and <b>iodine</b> <b>deficiencies</b> are {{frequently}} present in cattle in Europe {{with a negative}} impact on animal health, reproduction and production. Deficiencies in animals also influence human health owing to consumption of their products. These deficiencies must be correctly diagnosed in order to avoid lack of diagnosis or wrong diagnosis. Since there are many interactions between nutrients, a nutritional approach only is of limited interest. Therefore, the diagnosis based on samples obtained on the animals is more reliable. Clinical signs of selenium and <b>iodine</b> <b>deficiencies</b> are rarely pathognomonic. Laboratory analyses are thus necessary to confirm the diagnosis. The present review relates the principal clinical signs of selenium and <b>iodine</b> <b>deficiencies</b> and the confirmation of the deficiency by the measurements of different nutritional and functional markers available for cattle, either on blood, milk, urine or tissues.

5|$|Some {{table salt}} sold for {{consumption}} contain additives which address {{a variety of}} health concerns, especially in the developing world. The identities and amounts of additives vary widely from country to country. Iodine is an important micronutrient for humans, and a deficiency of the element can cause lowered production of thyroxine (hypothyroidism) and enlargement of the thyroid gland (endemic goitre) in adults or cretinism in children. Iodized salt {{has been used to}} correct these conditions since 1924 and consists of table salt mixed with a minute amount of potassium iodide, sodium iodide or sodium iodate. A small amount of dextrose may also be added to stabilize the iodine. <b>Iodine</b> <b>deficiency</b> affects about two billion people around the world and is the leading preventable cause of mental retardation. Iodized table salt has significantly reduced disorders of <b>iodine</b> <b>deficiency</b> in countries where it is used.|$|E

5|$|Hypothyroidism {{is managed}} with {{replacement}} of the hormone thyroxine. This is usually given daily as an oral supplement, and may take {{a few weeks to}} become effective. Some causes of hypothyroidism, such as Postpartum thyroiditis and Subacute thyroiditis may be transient and pass over time, and other causes such as <b>iodine</b> <b>deficiency</b> may be able to be rectified with dietary supplementation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Iodine</b> <b>deficiency</b> is {{the most}} common cause of primary {{hypothyroidism}} and endemic goiter worldwide. In areas of the world with sufficient dietary iodine, hypothyroidism is most commonly caused by the autoimmune disease Hashimoto's thyroiditis (chronic autoimmune thyroiditis). Hashimoto's may be associated with a goiter. It is characterized by infiltration of the thyroid gland with T lymphocytes and autoantibodies against specific thyroid antigens such as thyroid peroxidase, thyroglobulin and the TSH receptor.|$|E
5|$|<b>Iodine</b> <b>deficiency,</b> {{most common}} in inland and mountainous areas, can {{predispose}} to goitre – if widespread, known as endemic goitre. Pregnant women deficient of iodine can give birth to infants with thyroid hormone deficiency.

40|$|Undernutrition and {{micronutrient}} deficiencies contribute sub-stantially to {{the global}} burden of disease (Ezzati and others 2002). Impoverished communities experience high rates of undernutrition and increased exposure to infectious diseases caused by crowding and inadequate sanitation. Women of reproductive age and children experience devastating health consequences {{as a result of}} limited resources, cultural influ-ences, and biological vulnerabilities. Undernutrition and infec-tious diseases exist in a baleful synergy: undernutrition reduces immunological capacity to defend against diseases, and dis-eases deplete and deprive the body of essential nutrients. Undernutrition and infectious diseases further exacerbate poverty through lost wages, increased health care costs, and— most insidiously—impaired intellectual development that can significantly reduce earning potential. Health experts have recently recognized the long-term effects of early undernutri-tion and inadequate infant feeding for obesity and chronic dis-eases, including diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.

40|$|Vitamin A, iron, or <b>iodine</b> <b>deficiencies</b> affect 30 {{percent of}} the world's population. Some 735 million persons suffer from the {{clinical}} forms of these deficiencies, and another two billion from subclinical forms. Collectively, they damage health; cause death; harm reproduction; reduce intelligence, educability, and academic achievement; and lower work productivity and occupational choices. Of special concern, micronutrient deficiencies interfere with child growth and development, sometimes permanently. The consequences of micronutrient malnutrition are serious in both the short and long term: current health and productive activities are harmed, and the potential of future generations will be damaged. Micronutrient deficiencies {{play a major role}} in mortality risk as well, especially for pregnant mothers and young children, through influence on height, size, and proper functioning of the immune system.

5000|$|In {{order to}} {{directly}} address nutrient deficiencies, the INP established a mandatory food fortification program in 2003, which is interrelated to the micronutrient supplementation program. However, the programs have not reached their anticipated success rates. The food fortification program {{has created a}} food fortification mix imbedded in maize meal and other complementary foods. The mix's high Folate content seems to have eradicated Folate deficiencies. The food fortification program also made the iodization of salt mandatory since 1995. This seems to have halted incidences of <b>iodine</b> <b>deficiencies.</b> However, any micronutrients lacking in the food fortification mix can still cause malnutrition. Unfortunately, it has been difficult for the micronutrient supplementation program to provide all the lacking micronutrients to those in need. The program faces various limitations in the forms of supply, supplement quality, bio-availability, outreach, and compliance. [...] For example, the Vitamin A supplementation program {{has been criticized for}} its struggles with reaching its most vulnerable target: children and post-partum women.|$|R
5|$|An {{underactive thyroid}} gland results in hypothyroidism. Typical {{symptoms}} are abnormal weight gain, tiredness, constipation, heavy menstrual bleeding, hair loss, cold intolerance, and a slow heart rate. <b>Iodine</b> <b>deficiency</b> {{is the most}} common cause of hypothyroidism worldwide, and the autoimmune disease Hashimoto's thyroiditis {{is the most common}} cause in the developed world. Other causes include congenital abnormalities, diseases causing transient inflammation, surgical removal or radioablation of the thyroid, the drugs amiodarone and lithium, amyloidosis, and sarcoidosis. Some forms of hypothyroidism can result in myxedema and severe cases can result in myxedema coma.|$|E
5|$|Newborn {{children}} with hypothyroidism may have normal birth weight and height (although the head may {{be larger than}} expected and the posterior fontanelle may be open). Some may have drowsiness, decreased muscle tone, a hoarse-sounding cry, feeding difficulties, constipation, an enlarged tongue, umbilical hernia, dry skin, a decreased body temperature and jaundice. A goiter is rare, although it may develop later in children who have a thyroid gland that does not produce functioning thyroid hormone. A goiter may also develop in children growing up in areas with <b>iodine</b> <b>deficiency.</b> Normal growth and development may be delayed, and not treating infants may lead to an intellectual impairment (IQ 6–15 points lower in severe cases). Other problems include the following: large scale and fine motor skills and coordination, reduced muscle tone, squinting, decreased attention span, and delayed speaking. Tooth eruption may be delayed.|$|E
5|$|Salt is {{processed}} from salt mines, {{and by the}} evaporation of seawater (sea salt) and mineral-rich spring water in shallow pools. Its major industrial products are caustic soda and chlorine; salt is used in many industrial processes including the manufacture of polyvinyl chloride, plastics, paper pulp and many other products. Of the annual global production of around two hundred million tonnes of salt, only about 6% is used for human consumption. Other uses include water conditioning processes, de-icing highways, and agricultural use. Edible salt is sold in forms such as sea salt and table salt which usually contains an anti-caking agent and may be iodised to prevent <b>iodine</b> <b>deficiency.</b> As well as its use in cooking and at the table, salt is present in many processed foods.|$|E

The implications are obvious for human health and national and global economic and social development. Mixes of affordable interventions are available which, when appropriately adapted to resource availability and context, are proven to be effective. These include both food-based interventions, particularly fortification programmes, such as salt iodization, and use of concentrated micronutrient supplements.

For example, it increases the concentration of Zn and Fe at key sites such as erythrocytes when these elements are deficient, and reduces potentially harmful high Fe concentration in the liver during infection. An important mechanism in Se/Zn interaction is selenoenzyme regulation of Zn delivery from metallothionein to Zn enzymes. More research is needed to determine whether sufficient genetic variability exists within staple crops to enable selection for Se and I uptake efficiency. In addition, bioavailability trials with animals and humans are needed, using varying dietary concentrations of Se, I, Zn, Fe, and vitamin A to elucidate important interactions in order to optimize delivery in biofortification programs...|$|R

In this paper, we present new analyses {{to estimate the}} effects of the risks related to measures of undernutrition, as well as to suboptimum breastfeeding practices on mortality and disease. We estimated that stunting, severe wasting, and intrauterine growth restriction together were responsible for 2. 2 million deaths and 21 % of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for children younger than 5 years. Deficiencies of vitamin A and zinc were estimated to be responsible for 0. 6 million and 0. 4 million deaths, respectively, and a combined 9 % of global childhood DALYs. Iron and <b>iodine</b> <b>deficiencies</b> resulted in few child deaths, and combined were responsible for about 0. 2 % of global childhood DALYs.
