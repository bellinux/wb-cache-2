5|$|The {{canonical}} {{literature of}} Jainism {{does not mention}} the worship of Ganesha. However, Ganesha is worshipped by most Jains, for whom he appears to <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> certain functions of the god of wealth, Kubera. Jain ties with the trading community {{support the idea that}} Jainism took up Ganesha worship as a result of commercial connections. The earliest known Jain Ganesha statue dates to about the 9th century. A 15th-century Jain text lists procedures for the installation of Ganapati images. Images of Ganesha appear in the Jain temples of Rajasthan and Gujarat.|$|E

5|$|Commissioner Gordon informs Batman {{that the}} {{patients}} of Arkham Asylum <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> the facility, threatening to murder the staff unless Batman agrees {{to meet with}} them. Among the hostages are Dr. Charles Cavendish, Arkham's administrator, and Dr. Ruth Adams, a therapist. The patients are led by the Joker, who threatens to kill a young girl to spur Batman {{to come to the}} asylum. Meanwhile, Two-Face's mental condition has deteriorated as a result of Adams' therapy; she replaced Two-Face's trademark coin with a six-sided die then a tarot deck, in each instance increasing the number of choices he has (as opposed to two choices from his original coin) in the hope that he will eventually not leave any of his choices up to chance. Instead, the treatment renders him incapable of even making simple decisions, such as going to the bathroom.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the Bynars discreetly {{create a}} catastrophic {{failure in the}} ship's warp core. Lt. Cmdr. Data (Brent Spiner) and Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) are unable to locate Picard or Riker and, {{assuming}} them to already be on the Starbase, order an emergency evacuation. They set the ship to leave the Starbase and warp to a safe location before it would explode. However, once they are clear of the dock, the failure disappears and the ship sets course for the Bynar system, the planet Bynaus orbiting Beta Magellan. Data, La Forge, and Quinteros realize that the Bynars are still aboard the ship, but there are currently no other working vessels to follow them. Back on the Enterprise, Riker and Picard leave the simulation to find the ship empty and at warp to the Bynar system, with the ship's controls locked to the bridge. Fearing that the Bynars <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> the ship for nefarious purposes, they set the ship to self-destruct in 5 minutes and then take the bridge by inter-ship transporter beam and find the Bynars there unconscious.|$|E
5|$|On 14 June 827, {{the allied}} fleets sailed from the Bay of Sousse, and {{after three days}} they reached Mazara in southwestern Sicily, where they landed. There they were met with {{soldiers}} loyal to Euphemius, but the alliance soon began to show rifts: a Muslim detachment mistook some of Euphemius' partisans for loyalist troops, and a skirmish ensued. Although Euphemius' troops were ordered to place a twig on their helmets as a distinctive mark, Asad announced his intention to wage the campaign without them. Soon after that, Balata, who seems to <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> the functions, if not the title, of the imperial strategos on the island, appeared nearby with a Byzantine force. The two armies clashed on a plain south-east of Mazara, where Asad's men, after exhortations by their leader, gained a victory. Balata retreated first to Enna {{and from there to}} Calabria on the Italian mainland, where he may have hoped to gather more troops. Instead, he died there shortly after his arrival.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the current}} rules, players must have at least 10 years of major league {{experience}} {{to be eligible for}} induction. In addition, they must be retired {{for at least five years}} if living, or deceased for at least six months. Players meeting these qualifications must pass through a screening committee, and are then voted on by the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA). Each writer may vote for up to 10 players; to be admitted into the Hall of Fame, a player must be approved by 75% of those casting ballots. Players receiving less than 5% approval are removed from future BBWAA ballots. The rules, as revised in July 2016, allow that all individuals eligible for induction but not for the BBWAA ballot—players who have not been approved by the BBWAA election process within 15 years of their retirement, umpires, managers, pioneers, and executives—may be considered by one of four voting bodies that <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> the role of the former Veterans Committee, based on the era in which each individual candidate made his greatest contribution to the sport. On a few occasions, exceptions have been made to the guidelines in place at the time: Lou Gehrig was elected in 1939 following his diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Roberto Clemente was elected shortly after his death in 1972; and Addie Joss was elected in 1978 even though he completed only nine seasons before his death.|$|E

5|$|Limbert and Roworth have commented that, {{unlike other}} peat areas, {{such as the}} Somerset Levels, where {{recording}} of the industrial heritage has been systematic, the recording of the industrial archaeology of Thorne and Hatfield Moors has been notably scarce. A guide to the industrial history of South Yorkshire published in 1995 {{made no mention of}} peat at all. The canals dug by the Dutch and operated until the 1920s have been mentioned by canal historians such as Charles Hadfield, but have never been investigated systematically. The railways have received a little more attention in the specialist press, and some of the locomotives have been preserved. The history of the workers has been partially recorded through the Thorne and Hatfield Moors Oral History Project. In contrast, the ecology of the moors has been better documented, through the publication of the Thorne and Hatfield Moors Papers, first published by the Doncaster Naturalists Society in 1987. Since 1989, the Thorne and Hatfield Moors Conservation Forum <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> this responsibility. These papers now run to eight volumes, and the forum has also published technical papers on many aspects of the moors.|$|E
5|$|Out of {{one hundred}} peers summoned before the King in 1716, five lived in Great Marlborough Street. For a time, Thomas Onslow, 2nd Baron Onslow owned No.11 while Richard Lumley, 1st Earl of Scarbrough at No.12. For {{a time in the}} 18th century, the street was the main London {{residence}} of Lord Nelson. No.13 was formed of two separate houses, both leased by John Richmond in 1710 and subsequently joined as a single property. It was bought by Lord Charles Cavendish in 1740 and later occupied by his son, the scientist Henry Cavendish. Sir John Cust, 3rd Baronet lived at No.14 from 1754–62. The Byron family were listed as ratepayers of No.15 during the early 18th century. William Byron, 4th Baron Byron lived here from 1727 until his death in 1736; his widow remained there until 1740. The Baron's son, William Byron, 5th Baron Byron lived here from 1745–74. The Scottish sculptor Thomas Campbell worked here from 1833–1843, also taking over the neighbouring No.16. Sir Lambert Blackwell, 1st Baronet bought No.16 in September 1709 and stayed there until his death in 1727. His son, Sir Charles Blackwell, 2nd Baronet subsequently lived in the house until he died in 1741. Mary Lepell, maid of honour to Caroline, Princess of Wales (and future wife of John Hervey, 2nd Baron Hervey) lived in part of a house which is now part of No.34 from around 1716–1724. Sir John Cust, 3rd Baronet, Speaker of the House of Commons lives in No.41 (now No.46) from 1747–52. The first floor of the property was later occupied by the painter Benjamin Haydon from 1808–17; Gilbert Stuart Newton is believed to <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> his lodgings.|$|E
