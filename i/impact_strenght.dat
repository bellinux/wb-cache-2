40|$|Unmodified unplasticised PVC (PVC-U) has the {{disadvantages}} of being prone to occasional brittleness and is notch sensitive. Various types of rubber {{are being used}} in PVC-U as impact modifier which formed multi-phase systems. The main objective {{of this research is}} to study on possibility of methyl-methacrylate-grafted-natural rubber- 49 (MF 49) to be used as impact modifier in filled calcium carbonate unplasticised PVC. MG 49 is a modified NR which is made by polymerizing methyl methacrylate monomer in latex so that polymer chains become attached to the rubber molecule. In the sample preparation, dry blending was carried out with laboratory blender and milled into sheets using two-roll mill. Test specimens were molded using a hot press before carrying out the various mechanical testing that is impact, flexural and tensile testing. The results show that rhe <b>impact</b> <b>strenght</b> increases as the impact modifier MG 49 contect increases in the filled calcium carbonate PVC-U samples. However, similar increase in the impact modifier content resulted in a decrease in flexural modulus and yield stress. The formulation containing 8 phr impact modifier MG 49 and 10 phr calcium carbonate was found to be most optimum formulation in term of impact strength, flexural modulus and yield strength...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present the {{different}} properties and the fractured surface of denture base resin using different process fabrication technique, it also aims to determine the suitablality denture material used in vacuum casting technique. Thirty rectangular specimens were fabricated by conventional denture fabrication for (Impact rapid repair material) heat cure in water bath polymerized and cold cure in autiopolymerized, then specimences were fabricated by using vacuum casting technique for cold cure resin (Vertex Castavaria) with condition of no degassing, degassing at 20 sec and 40 sec. The mechanical properties; impact strength, flexural strength and hardness of the fabricated samples were evaluated using Impact Charpy test, three point bending test and Vickers hardness test respecticely. The fractured surface were observed by using SEM. The results were analyzed by one way ANOVA with (α= 0. 05). It was found that the cold cure resin produced in vacuum casting process has a lower <b>impact</b> <b>strenght</b> as compared to autiopolymerized process. However, the flexural strength had increased and the porosity also deacreased when the degassing time condition increased. The finding shows that the cold cure resin (Vertex castavaria) had longer pouring time than other cold cure material. This makes the material is suitable for vacuum casting technique...|$|E
40|$|Neste trabalho o efeito da adição de 2 a 7 % em peso de um copolímero tribloco estireno-b-etileno-co-butileno-b-estireno (SEBS) em uma blenda polipropileno/poliestireno de alto impacto (PP/HIPS) 70 : 30 foi determinado. As propriedades em tração e impacto, temperatura de amolecimento Vicat e morfologia da blenda PP/HIPS (70 : 30) em função da concentração de SEBS foram determinadas. As blendas foram processadas em extrusora dupla-rosca contra-rotativa interpenetrante e as amostras moldadas por compressão. Os resultados mostraram que, embora a adição do SEBS tenha promovido um aumento muito leve na resistência tênsil e no módulo elástico, observou-se um expressivo aumento no alongamento na ruptura e na resistência ao impacto das blendas; a temperatura Vicat das blendas foi {{superior}} à do HIPS e que a adição do SEBS promoveu uma redução significativa do tamanho de partícula, indicando que o SEBS exerceu um efeito emulsificante e estabilizador na morfologia das blendas investigadas. Resultados otimizados foram obtidos para a composição contendo 5 % de SEBS, o que foi atribuido à uma maior compatibilidade entre as fases. In {{this work}} {{the effect of}} a 2 - 7 % w/w styrene-b-ethylene-co-butylene-b-styrene triblock copolymer (SEBS) addition on the properties of a 70 : 30 polypropylene/high impact polystyrene (PP/HIPS) polymer blend was investigated. Tensile and impact properties, the Vicat temperature and blend morphology were determined as a function of SEBS content. Processing was carried out in a twin-screw intermeshing counter-rotating extruder and the samples were compression moulded. Our results indicate that the SEBS addition, albeit promoting very slight increases on tensile strenght and modulus, led to increases on the elongation at break and <b>impact</b> <b>strenght</b> of the blends, and the Vicat temperature of the blends was higher than that of HIPS. The SEM analysis showed that SEBS addition promotes a significant reduction on particle size, which was taken as an indication that SEBS exerted an emulsifying and stabilizing effect on the morphology of the PP/HIPS blend under investigation. The best overall properties were obtained at 5 wt. % SEBS content...|$|E

Long-term quality is significant only for away team. If the match is played in the evening, there is 7 % decrease in attendance compared to matches played in the afternoon. The attendance is also decreasing while the distance is increasing (2, 4 % per 100 km). In case of precipitation in match day there is 4, 8 decrease in the attendance. Reputation of away team increases the attendance, when Sparta Prague is the away team there is 87 % increase in the attendence, while in case of Slavia Prague there is 45 % increase in the attendence and when last season's champion is away team there is increase by, more than 32 %.

40|$|As is {{the case}} {{elsewhere}} in the world, Turkish people have long utilized plants as remedies, food, fuel, and dye, {{as well as for}} furniture, ornamentation, agricultural tools, and construction materials. Onopordum is a valuable medicinal plant that is widely used in traditional medicine in Europe. The application of Onopordum as food is limited and its main importance is due to medicine utilization. Because of having flavonoid compositions, Onopordum is an important plant. The Genus Onopordum L. (Asteraceae) includes about 38 species. The representatives of the genus are native to Europe, Northern Africa, the Canary Island, the Caucasus, Southwest and Central Asia. In Turkey, this genus is represented with 20 species, 6 of which are endemic. Onopordum (cotton thistle, also known as Scots or Scotch thistle) species are biennials herbaceous plants with branched, spinose winged stems. They have application in medical practice as a bactericide, cardiotonic, and hemostatic agent and are used against hypotonicity. In this study antioxidant activities of ethanol, methanol, acetone and benzen extracts of some endemic Onopordum anatolicum (Boiss.) Boiss. & Heldr. ex Eig seeds which are in Denizli were examined. DPPH and β-carotene-Linoleic acid methods were used in order to determinethe antioxidant activity. The highest antioxidant activity (77 %) was seenin the extract which is obtained by using methanol catalyst. The lowest activity of antioxidant of the extracts is acetone (5 %). In terms of <b>impact,</b> the <b>strenght</b> of antioxidant depends on the phenolic amount of it. For that purpose, O. anatolicum total fenolic content was calculated in terms of mg/ml gallic acid in the experiment performed by using Folin-Ciocaltaeu medhod. According to these values, the highest amount of phenolic compounds are in methanol and the lowest amount of phenolic compounds are in benzen. According to the results of the experiment performed by using DPPH method, {{it is obvious that the}} free radicals in the environment has theability of sweep. The increase in the concentration of all extracts leads to an increase in the activity of elimination of free radical...|$|R
