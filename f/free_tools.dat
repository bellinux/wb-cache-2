2500|$|In certain situations, {{general purpose}} {{software}} tools that are language specific in nature can be very useful. [...] These {{take the form of}} static code analysis tools. [...] These tools look for a very specific set of known problems, some common and some rare, within the source code. [...] All such issues detected by these tools would rarely be picked up by a compiler or interpreter, thus they are not syntax checkers, but more semantic checkers. [...] Some tools claim to be able to detect 300+ unique problems. Both commercial and <b>free</b> <b>tools</b> exist in various languages. [...] These tools can be extremely useful when checking very large source trees, where it is impractical to do code walkthroughs. [...] A typical example of a problem detected would be a variable dereference that occurs before the variable is assigned a value. [...] As another example, some such tools perform strong type checking when the language does not require it. [...] Thus, they are better at locating likely errors, versus actual errors. [...] As a result, these tools have a reputation of false positives. [...] The old Unix lint program is an early example.|$|E
2500|$|In a December 2016 {{review of}} the {{software}} suite, Edward Mendelsohn of PC Magazine wrote that the suite was [...] "visually elegant" [...] with [...] "effortless collaboration", but that Docs, Sheets and Slides were [...] "less powerful than desktop-based suites". Comparing Google's office suite with Microsoft's and Apple's, he stated that [...] "Docs exists only in your Web browser", meaning that users have [...] "more limited feature set" [...] than [...] "the spacious, high-powered setting of a desktop app". He wrote that offline support required a plug-in, describing it as [...] "less convenient than a desktop app, {{and you have to}} remember to install it before you need it". Mendelsohn praised the user interface, describing it as [...] "elegant, highly usable" [...] with [...] "fast performance", and that the revision history [...] "alerts you to recent changes, and stores fine-grained records of revisions". Regarding the Explore functionality, he credited it for being the [...] "niftiest new feature" [...] in the suite and that it surpassed comparable features in Microsoft Office. He described the quality of imports of Office files as [...] "impressive fidelity". In summarization, he praised the suite for having [...] "the best balance of speed and power, and the best collaboration features, too", while noting that [...] "it lacks a few features offered by Microsoft Office 365, but it was also faster to load and save in our testing". In 2011, Paul Sawers of The Next Web described Google Docs as a [...] "pretty robust set of <b>free</b> <b>tools</b> that are improving every month". In a 2016 review of Google's G Suite business subscription service, Eric Grevstad of PC Magazine stated that Google Docs follows the [...] "80/20" [...] rule: [...] "that is, 80 percent of users will never need more than 20 percent of the features".|$|E
