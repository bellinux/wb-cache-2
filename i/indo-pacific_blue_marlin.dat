50|$|In 2010, Greenpeace International {{added the}} striped marlin, white marlin, Atlantic blue marlin, black marlin, and <b>Indo-pacific</b> <b>blue</b> <b>marlin</b> to its seafood red list.|$|E
5000|$|The {{classification}} of the Atlantic blue marlin (M. nigricans) and the <b>Indo-Pacific</b> <b>blue</b> <b>marlin</b> (M. mazara) as separate species is under debate. Genetic data suggest, {{although the two}} groups are isolated from each other, they are both the same species, with the only genetic exchange occurring when <b>Indo-Pacific</b> <b>blue</b> <b>marlin</b> migrate to and contribute genes to the Atlantic population. A separate study by V. P. Buonaccorsi, J. R. Mcdowell, and Graves indicated that both Indo-Pacific and Atlantic show [...] "striking phylogeographic partitioning" [...] of mitochondrial and microsatellite loci.|$|E
5000|$|Makaira (Latin via Greek: μαχαίρα [...] "sword") is a genus of marlin in the Istiophoridae family. It {{includes}} the Atlantic <b>blue,</b> and <b>Indo-Pacific</b> <b>blue</b> <b>marlins.</b> In the past, the black marlin was {{also included in}} this genus, but today it is placed in its own genus, Istiompax.|$|R
5000|$|Larger <b>blue</b> <b>marlin</b> {{appear to}} be {{captured}} in years when the water temperate is warmer than usual. On the New South Wales coast, water temperatures of [...] brought down the coast by the warmer south east current appear to produce the best <b>blue</b> <b>marlin</b> fishing and the largest <b>blue</b> <b>marlin.</b> The fishing season in Australia for <b>blue</b> <b>marlin</b> is January to May-June.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Blue</b> <b>marlin</b> have {{probably}} been known to Japanese high-seas fishermen for centuries. However, the Pacific <b>blue</b> <b>marlin</b> was not officially {{considered to be a}} separate species (though still debated) until 1954; prior to then, Pacific blues were known as [...] "silver marlin" [...] or often confused with black marlin. The capture of a 1002 lb Pacific <b>blue</b> <b>marlin</b> by skipper George Parker of Kona, Hawaii, was instrumental in clearing up the identification of Pacific marlin species. Hawaii has continued to be the major center of <b>blue</b> <b>marlin</b> fishing in the Pacific, and Hawaiian <b>blue</b> <b>marlin</b> techniques have been disseminated throughout the Pacific Basin by travelling anglers and crews, influencing <b>blue</b> <b>marlin</b> fisheries as distant as Japan and Australia.|$|R
50|$|Although {{they are}} {{traditionally}} listed as separate species, recent {{research indicates that}} the Atlantic blue marlin (Makaira nigricans) and <b>Indo-Pacific</b> <b>blue</b> <b>marlin</b> (Makaira mazara) may be disjoint ranges of the same species.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Indo-Pacific</b> <b>blue</b> <b>marlin</b> (Makaira mazara) is {{a species}} of marlin found in the Pacific Ocean and Indian Oceans. It is closely related to, and usually {{considered}} conspecific with, the Atlantic blue marlin, then simply called blue marlin.|$|E
50|$|The Atlantic {{blue marlin}} (Makaira nigricans) is {{a species of}} marlin endemic to the Atlantic Ocean. It is closely related to, and usually {{considered}} conspecific with, the <b>Indo-Pacific</b> <b>blue</b> <b>marlin,</b> then simply called blue marlin. Some authorities still consider both species distinct.|$|E
50|$|Although a <b>blue</b> <b>marlin</b> {{weighing}} over 1000 lb {{was caught}} in the Bay of Islands as early as 1968, striped marlin have traditionally been the main billfish species in the New Zealand fishery. However, Pacific <b>blue</b> <b>marlin</b> captures have increased in New Zealand over the last 10 years, and <b>blue</b> <b>marlin</b> are now consistently caught from along the eastern coast of the North Island. The Waihau Bay and Cape Runaway area is particularly well known for <b>blue</b> <b>marlin.</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>marlin</b> encountered in New Zealand tend to be of large average size with most averaging 300 to 500 lb. Larger specimens in the 600 lb-plus class are hooked and landed every year. Most New Zealand <b>blue</b> <b>marlin</b> are taken by lure fishing, {{with a wide variety of}} locally made and imported lures being popular.|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} the trophic biology of 87 <b>blue</b> <b>marlin</b> caught in Hawaiian waters {{indicates}} that these opportunistic predators consume a diverse array of prey. The {{data suggest that the}} diet of <b>blue</b> <b>marlin</b> is influenced by the locality of capture. Thus, surface (troll) -caught <b>blue</b> <b>marlin</b> from near the Hawaiian Islands consume numerous larvae, postlarvae, and juveniles of inshore species, prey relatively rare in marlin taken on the high seas. Volumetrically, these inshore forms are of little consequence and probably contribute little to the energy requirements of <b>blue</b> <b>marlin.</b> As shown in other studies, small tunas are the single most important component of Hawaiian <b>blue</b> <b>marlin</b> diets...|$|R
50|$|<b>Blue</b> <b>marlin</b> are eclectic feeders {{preying on}} a wide range of prey species and sizes. Scientific {{examination}} of <b>blue</b> <b>marlin</b> stomach contents has yielded organisms as small as miniature filefish. Common food items include tuna-like fishes, particularly skipjack tuna and frigate mackerel (also known as frigate tuna), squid, mackerel, and scad. Of more interest to sport fishermen is the upper range of <b>blue</b> <b>marlin</b> prey size. A 72 in white marlin has been recorded as being found in the stomach of a 448 lb <b>blue</b> <b>marlin</b> caught at Walker's Cay in the Bahamas, and more recently, during the 2005 White Marlin Open, a white marlin in the 70 lb class was found in the stomach of one of the money-winning blues. Shortbill spearfish of 30 to 40 lb have been recorded as feed items by Kona <b>blue</b> <b>marlin</b> fishermen. Yellowfin and bigeye tuna of 100 lb or more have also been found in the stomachs of large <b>blue</b> <b>marlin.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Commercial fishing (mostly {{servicing}} and unloading of longline fleets {{and commercial}} vessels), recreational fishing of <b>Indo-Pacific</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Marlin</b> (Makaira mazara), Wahoo (Acanthocybium solandri), Mahi-mahi (Coryphaena hippurus), Yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares), and deepwater reef fish, tourism (especially from Japan but increasingly from China and South Korea).|$|E
5000|$|The 12 {{species of}} true {{billfish}} {{are divided into}} two families and five genera. One family, Xiphiidae, contains only one species, the swordfish Xiphias gladius, and the other family, Istiophoridae contains 11 species in four genera, including marlin, spearfish, and sailfish. Controversy exists about whether the <b>Indo-Pacific</b> <b>blue</b> <b>marlin,</b> Makaira mazara, is the same species as the Atlantic blue marlin, M. nigricans. FishBase follows Nakamura (1985) in recognizing M. mazara as a distinct species, [...] "chiefly because of differences {{in the pattern of}} the lateral line system".|$|E
50|$|Although <b>blue</b> <b>marlin</b> {{are being}} caught in {{increasing}} numbers on the Algarve coast of Portugal, the main centres of <b>blue</b> <b>marlin</b> fishing in Portugal are the oceanic islands of the Azores and Madeira.|$|R
50|$|Lure fishing, {{live bait}} and switch-baiting are all used {{successfully}} for <b>blue</b> <b>marlin</b> in Australia. <b>Blue</b> <b>marlin</b> are targeted by some anglers {{and are also}} encountered whilst fishing for the more abundant striped marlin.|$|R
50|$|Established in 1957, the Big Rock <b>Blue</b> <b>Marlin</b> Tournament draws {{large crowds}} of {{sporting}} enthusiasts {{of all types}} to Morehead City each year to witness {{some of the largest}} Atlantic <b>blue</b> <b>marlin</b> catches in North America.|$|R
50|$|Although {{a number}} of <b>blue</b> <b>marlin</b> have been brought into ports along the Atlantic coast of {{mainland}} Spain, the subtropical archipelago of the Canary Islands {{is by far the}} most prolific <b>blue</b> <b>marlin</b> grounds in Spain. <b>Blue</b> <b>marlin</b> appear seasonally in the Canary Islands between May and October, with some individuals having been caught earlier and later in the year. The average size of <b>blue</b> <b>marlin</b> encountered in the Canary Islands tends to be large, in the 400 to 600 lb class, including some very large fish upwards of 800 lb. Smaller fish in the 200 to 350 lb class also make an appearance at times.|$|R
50|$|The Outer Banks of North Carolina {{have long}} been known for their <b>blue</b> <b>marlin</b> fishing. Since the early 1950s when Ernal Foster on the Albatross I made the first charter fishing trips for <b>blue</b> <b>marlin,</b> Cape Hatteras has been known as an {{important}} destination for the sport fisherman. Other important fishing centers include Morehead City, home to the famous Big Rock <b>Blue</b> <b>Marlin</b> Tournament, and Oregon Inlet. The proximity of the Gulf Stream and of the continental shelf edge in the Cape Hatteras area create a productive combination of current, blue water, and ocean temperature that attracts {{a wide variety of}} gamefish including <b>blue</b> <b>marlin.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 1994 - A {{limited edition}} Land Cruiser <b>Blue</b> <b>Marlin</b> (FZJ80R) was {{introduced}} into the Australian market. They have 4.5 L straight 6 petrol motors with double-overhead cams, automatic or manual transmission and [...] at 4600 rpm. The car is blue from the <b>Blue</b> <b>Marlin</b> fish {{and they have the}} <b>Blue</b> <b>Marlin</b> logo throughout the car. Some of the features that the <b>Blue</b> <b>Marlin</b> included were altimeters, power windows, disk brakes, leather gear knob and steering wheel, central locking, leather trim, chrome handles and sidesteps, 16" [...] alloy wheels, limited-slip differential, anti-lock brakes (ABS), power steering, CD and cassette players, flares, and a limited edition bull bar. Only 500 were made.|$|R
50|$|<b>Blue</b> <b>marlin</b> {{fishing in}} Madeira was pioneered by local anglers in the 1960s and 1970s, {{and a number}} of large <b>blue</b> <b>marlin</b> were caught during the 1980s, but the focus for most visiting anglers tended to be sharks and the {{prolific}} schools of bigeye tuna. After the mid-1990s, however, the attention of <b>blue</b> <b>marlin</b> fishermen was drawn to the island after several exceptional captures, including eight fish weighing over 1000 lb in 1994 alone.|$|R

Two fishing records of released fish have been established at the tournament; in 2003 a (178 <b>blue</b> <b>marlins</b> released) and in 2005 a total of 205 <b>blue</b> <b>marlins</b> released at the tournament.|$|R
50|$|The city of Vitória is {{considered}} one of the finest locations for <b>blue</b> <b>marlin</b> fishing by many anglers. Fishing is a popular activity in Vitória, attracting fishermen from other states and countries due to the large population of marlin and sailfish off the coast of Espirito Santo. Largest of the many big <b>blue</b> <b>marlin</b> caught at Vitória is the International Game Fish Association all-tackle record, held by Paulo Amorim, who caught a <b>blue</b> <b>marlin</b> that weighed 636 kg.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Blue</b> <b>marlin</b> occur {{widely in}} the {{tropical}} oceanic waters of the Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific, with many fish making seasonal migrations into the temperate waters of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres {{to take advantage of}} feeding opportunities as those waters in spring and summer. Warm currents such as the Gulf Stream in the western Atlantic and the Agulhas Current in the western Indian Ocean serve as oceanic highways for <b>blue</b> <b>marlin</b> migration, and have a major influence on their seasonal distribution. <b>Blue</b> <b>marlin</b> have a limited ability to thermoregulate, and the lower limit of their temperature tolerance is thought to be in the region of about [...] although individual fish have been caught in cooler temperatures. Larger individuals have the greatest temperature tolerance, and <b>blue</b> <b>marlin</b> encountered at the limits of their range tend to be large fish. This wide distribution brings <b>blue</b> <b>marlin</b> in contact with anglers {{in many parts of the}} world.|$|R
50|$|Although <b>blue</b> <b>marlin</b> can {{be found}} close to Faial, boats seeking them often select three banks that serve as {{productive}} feeding locations for these fish. The Azores sits in the northern extreme of <b>blue</b> <b>marlin</b> distribution and the fishery is dominated by large fish. Large 400 to 600 lb fish are average here and every year fish of 1000 lb and above are encountered. The Azores is home to Atlantic <b>blue</b> <b>marlin</b> records for, amongst others, IGFA 50 and 80 lb-line classes.|$|R
50|$|The banks lying off the hook-shaped {{island of}} Bermuda {{consistently}} produce <b>blue</b> <b>marlin.</b> Many Bermudian fish are small specimens in the 150 to 250 lb class, but every year much bigger {{fish in the}} 600 lb and larger class are caught. A 1352 lb giant boated aboard the Mako IV, skippered by Captain Allen DeSilva, in 1995, stands as the largest <b>blue</b> <b>marlin</b> caught in Bermudian waters. This fish {{is also one of}} the largest <b>blue</b> <b>marlin</b> ever boated in the Atlantic.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Blue</b> <b>Marlin</b> and {{her sister}} ship were owned by Offshore Heavy Transport of Oslo, Norway, from their construction, in April 2000 and November 1999 respectively, until 6 July 2001, when they were {{purchased}} by Dockwise. The U.S. Navy hired <b>Blue</b> <b>Marlin</b> from Offshore Heavy Transport to move the destroyer [...] back to the United States after the warship was damaged by Al-Qaeda suicide bombers while anchored in the port of Aden, Yemen. During {{the latter part of}} 2003, work done on <b>Blue</b> <b>Marlin</b> boosted its capacity and added two retractable propulsors to improve maneuverability. The ship re-entered service in January 2004. Following these improvements, <b>Blue</b> <b>Marlin</b> delivered the oil platform Thunder Horse PDQ, weighing 60,000 tons, to Corpus Christi, Texas, for completion.|$|R
50|$|In the Pacific, <b>blue</b> <b>marlin</b> are {{seasonally}} {{found as}} far north as southern Japan and as far south as the Bay of Plenty in the North Island of New Zealand. <b>Blue</b> <b>marlin</b> in the eastern Pacific migrate {{as far north}} as Southern California and as far south as northern Peru. The southern limit of their distribution in the eastern Indian Ocean appears to be the waters of Albany and Perth in Western Australia, and in the western Indian Ocean <b>blue</b> <b>marlin</b> have been taken as far south as Cape Town.|$|R
50|$|The most {{established}} {{sport fisheries}} for <b>blue</b> <b>marlin</b> are found {{along the eastern}} seaboard and the Gulf Coast of the United States, Bermuda, the Bahamas, and several other Caribbean islands (notably St Thomas and Puerto Rico). Recreational fishing for <b>blue</b> <b>marlin</b> also takes place in Brazil, Venezuela, and the Atlantic coast of Mexico, particularly the Yucatan peninsula. In the eastern Atlantic, <b>blue</b> <b>marlin</b> sport fisheries exist from the Algarve coast of Portugal in the north to Angola {{in the south and}} include the islands of the Azores, Canaries, Cape Verde, Madeira, and Ascension Island.|$|R
50|$|In 2012, the <b>Blue</b> <b>Marlin</b> Cove Marina was reopened in the Bootle Bay Development on {{the south}} side of West End. This marina and {{condominium}} development caters to US fishermen arriving by boat. Bonefish Folley & Sons Guided Services announced that they are offering sport fishing service out of <b>Blue</b> <b>Marlin</b> Cove.|$|R
5000|$|The {{pioneers of}} <b>blue</b> <b>marlin</b> angling {{employed}} natural baits rigged to skip and swim. Today, rigged baits, particularly Spanish mackerel and horse ballyhoo {{continue to be}} widely used for <b>blue</b> <b>marlin.</b> Trolling for <b>blue</b> <b>marlin</b> with rigged baits, sometimes combined with an artificial lure or skirt to make [...] "skirted baits" [...] or [...] "bait/lure combinations", is still widely practiced, especially along the eastern seaboard of the United States and in the Bahamas, the Caribbean, and Venezuela. Rigged natural baits are also used as [...] "pitch baits" [...] that are deployed after fish are raised to hookless lures or [...] "teasers".|$|R
5000|$|The Bahama Islands {{have long}} been popular {{destinations}} for fishermen seeking <b>blue</b> <b>marlin.</b> Bimini, located at {{the eastern edge of}} the Gulf Stream, has the longest history of <b>blue</b> <b>marlin</b> fishing in the islands, dating back to the 1930s and 1940s when anglers such as Michael Lerner, Ernest Hemingway, and S. Kip Farrington fished there [...] From the 1960s, more outlying areas such as Walker's Cay and the Abaco islands have developed as <b>blue</b> <b>marlin</b> grounds. The Bahamas is home to one of the most intensely competitive tournament series in marlin fishing, the Bahamas Billfish Championship.|$|R
