Ploughshares have also been {{discovered}} at the nearby Liangzhu and Maqiao sites roughly dated to the same period. David R.

During the medieval period, the Arab world was critical in the exchange of crops and technology between the European, Asia and African continents.

The countryside was occupied by smaller towns, villages and hamlets, but the city's surroundings were empty within three kilometers. This was {{probably due to the}} <b>intensive</b> <b>cultivation</b> in the immediate hinterland, in order to sustain the population. The city manufactured different objects, including chalices made of obsidian and white marble, faience, flint tools and shell inlays.

5|$|Under the Kingdom of Madagascar, {{plantations}} {{were established}} {{for the production of}} crops exported to foreign markets such as England and France. Cloves were imported and planted in 1803, and coconuts—which had been relatively sparse on the island—were cultivated on plantations for the production of oil. Similarly, coffee had been grown on family plots of four to five trees until the early 19thcentury, when more <b>intensive</b> <b>cultivation</b> for export began. Vanilla, later to become one of Madagascar's premiere export crops, was introduced by French entrepreneurs in 1840 and planted in eastern coastal rainforests. The technique of hand pollination, critical to higher vanilla yields, was introduced 30years later. Nonetheless, vanilla remained a marginal crop {{until the end of the}} monarchy.|$|E

25|$|China is the world's largest {{producer}} and consumer of agricultural products– and some 300million Chinese farm workers {{are in the}} industry, mostly laboring on pieces of land {{about the size of}} U.S farms. Virtually all arable land is used for food crops.

Major non-food crops, including cotton, other fibers, and oilseeds, furnish China with a small proportion of its foreign trade revenue. Agricultural exports, such as vegetables and fruits, fish and shellfish, grain and meat products, are exported to Hong Kong.

25|$|Many colonial {{settlers}} came to Delaware from Maryland and Virginia, {{which had}} been experiencing a population boom.

In the early years the line between indentured servants and African slaves or laborers was fluid, and the working classes often lived closely together.

They were descendants chiefly of relationships or marriages between white servant women and enslaved, servant or free African or African-American men.

2500|$|Researchers have {{hypothesized}} {{that one reason}} for the early development of such high complexity at Chocolá is the <b>intensive</b> <b>cultivation</b> of cacao for long-distance trade. [...] Based on older as well as still accumulating evidence, scholars assume that innovative developments occurred in the southern Mesoamerican area during the Preclassic period (1500 BC – AD 200) that strongly influenced the later great Mesoamerican civilizations. However, scholars lack a clear sense of even the broader events and processes that shaped southern Guatemala's history and gave it its peculiar and, as long assumed, seminal character. Investigations at Kaminaljuyu, in the central Guatemalan highlands, and Takalik Abaj, in southwestern Guatemala, over recent decades showed the strong relationship between these two regions. [...] These centers, along with other nearby sites, like Chocolá, participated in distinct political networks and shared ideologies, technologies, and economics.|$|E
2500|$|The plan's highest priority, however, was {{to develop}} {{agriculture}} by integrating the collective and individual sectors into an overall system emphasizing <b>intensive</b> <b>cultivation</b> and crop specialization and by employing science and technology. Economic policy encouraged {{the development of the}} [...] "family economy"; that is, the peasants' personal use of economic resources, including land, not being used by the cooperative. Through use of an end-product contract system introduced by the plan, peasant households were permitted to sign contracts with the collective to farm land owned by the collective. The households then assumed responsibility for production on the plots. If production fell short of assigned quotas, the households were to be required to make up the deficit the following year. If a surplus was produced, the households were to be allowed to keep it, sell it on the free market, or sell it to the state for a [...] "negotiated price". In 1983 the family economy reportedly supplied 50 to 60 percent of the peasants' total income and 30 to 50 percent of their foodstuffs.|$|E
2500|$|The area of {{arable land}} farmed {{by a family}} was notionally {{suitable}} for two or three plough teams, allocated in runrigs. Runrigs, were a ridge and furrow pattern, similar to that used in parts of England, with alternating [...] "runs" [...] (furrows) and [...] "rigs" [...] (ridges). They usually ran downhill so that they included both wet and dry land, helping to offset some of the problems of extreme weather conditions. Most ploughing was done with a heavy wooden plough with an iron coulter, pulled by oxen, which were more effective on heavy soils and cheaper to feed than horses. They were usually pulled by a team of eight oxen, which would have taken four men to operate and only covered half an acre a day. In the late sixteenth century population growth in the west Highlands prompted an abandonment of ploughing in favour of more <b>intensive</b> <b>cultivation</b> methods using spades and foot ploughs (cas chrom) with lazy beds, which produced larger furrows with narrower channels between and allowed arable cultivation in locations where ploughing would have been impossible. Pasture was often accessed by shieling-grounds, with shelters made of stone or turf, used for the grazing of cattle in summer. These would often be distant from the main settlements in the Lowlands, but might be relatively close in the more remote Highlands. All farms combined livestock with arable farming, with cattle and sheep and goats in parts of the Highlands and all farms growing some grain. However, there was some specialisation, with arable most important in the East and there was a tradition of sheep farming in the eastern Borders dating back to the arrival of new monastic orders in the twelfth century, which continued after the secularisation of the monasteries.|$|E
