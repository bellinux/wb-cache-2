5|$|Lizards that {{inhabit the}} island include the white-bellied skink (Emoia cyanura), photographed by E. H. Quayle during an {{expedition}} in 1922, and a lizard {{reported in the}} journal of an expedition in 1935 by James Chapin. The species of the latter was uncertain, but it was thought to be a <b>gecko,</b> possibly either an oceanic <b>gecko</b> (Gehyra oceanica) or a mourning <b>gecko</b> (Lepidodactylus lugubris). The 1991–92 Pitcairn Islands Scientific Expedition found specimens of both the mourning <b>gecko</b> and the white-bellied skink. The only mammal known to inhabit Ducie is the Polynesian rat; In 1997 there was a successful project to eradicate these by Brian Bell (WMIL) and Graham Wragg (S/V Te Manu), to aid the conservation of bird species threatened by the rat population. Green sea turtles feed on Ducie, but have not been seen to breed there.|$|E
5|$|The Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero or Virgin Islands dwarf <b>gecko</b> (Sphaerodactylus parthenopion) is {{a species}} of <b>gecko</b> and {{also one of the}} {{smallest}} terrestrial vertebrates. It has only been found on three of the British Virgin Islands: Virgin Gorda, Tortola, and Moskito Island (also spelled “Mosquito Island”). It was discovered in 1964 and is suspected to be a close relative of Sphaerodactylus nicholsi, a dwarf sphaero from the nearby island of Puerto Rico. It shares its range with the big-scaled least <b>gecko</b> (S.macrolepis), which is found in leaf litter. Unlike this larger <b>gecko,</b> the Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero lives on drier hillsides, yet prefers moist microhabitats found under rocks because it lacks the adaptations necessary for preventing water loss, which is a significant problem due to its small body size.|$|E

40|$|Thermophysiological {{traits of}} two {{isolated}} Hoplodactylus maculatus populations were investigated to test adpatations to climate. <b>Geckos</b> {{were collected from}} Craigieburn (high altitude, generally cooler site) and Banks Peninsula. If climatic conditions at respective sites influenced physiology, I expected <b>geckos</b> from Craigieburn to exhibit cold-adapted physiological traits, whilst Banks Peninsula <b>geckos</b> would exhibit traits more characteristic of a warmclimate species. To this end I investigated four thermophysiological parameters: metabolism (SMR), preferred body temperature (PBT), locomotory performance and critical thermal minimum (CTMin). I hypothesized that if climate {{had an effect on}} SMR, Craigieburn <b>geckos</b> would exhibit higher levels of SMR which typically characterise other coolclimate reptiles. Craigieburn <b>geckos</b> displayed an average relative elevation of SMR over Banks Peninsula <b>geckos</b> of 26 %. Furthermore, Craigieburn <b>geckos</b> appeared to be 'geared' towards lower body temperatures and exhibited a greater acclimatory and acclimatizatory ability of SMR. The PBT of Craigieburn <b>geckos</b> was consistently elevated above Banks Peninsula <b>geckos.</b> This finding was somewhat paradoxical in light of previous studies of this parameter. A closer examination of the ecology of the two populations is required to clarify the adaptive significance of a higher PBT in <b>geckos</b> from a cooler climate. With respect to locomotory performance, I hypothesized that if thermal extremes influenced activity, Craigieburn <b>geckos</b> would exhibit activity patterns which help ameliorate the adverse effects of cold temperature. Craigieburn <b>geckos</b> did in fact have greater independence of activity to temperature than Banks Peninsula <b>geckos,</b> especially over lower body temperatures. The final parameter investigated, that of the critical thermal minimum, failed to distinguish the populations decisively. However there was some evidence of a greater acclimatizatory and acclimatory range in Craigieburn <b>geckos,</b> providing somewhat limited support for a population difference. Investigations into all four parameters lead me to conclude that populations of Hoplodactylus maculatus from Craigieburn and Banks Peninsula are physiologically distinct and warrant a revision of nomenclature...|$|R
