40|$|This study {{determined}} the commonly addressed quality dimensions {{for higher education}} and student's perceived importance of a new quality dimension that is <b>educational</b> <b>outcome.</b> Data were solicited from 808 newly enrolled students in 72 multi-disciplined private colleges in Malaysia via the Simple Random Sampling method. A two part questionnaire consisting of background data, student's perceived importance of private college's <b>educational</b> <b>outcome</b> were distributed through the drop-off method and mail survey. Likert-like scale with values ranging from 0 (Not applicable), 1 (low) to 7 (high) were used to obtain the said responses. The research uncovered that the Input and Process dimensions have often been emphasized as quality dimensions in higher education. However, student's too have perceived numerous elements of the Output dimension to be extremely important. They are acquiring adequate subject matter knowledge (59 %), communication skills (51 %) and analytical skills (48 %). Hence implying the possible need to include the Output dimension as a new dimension of quality assessment for higher education. This findings signify the need for management of private colleges to pay serious attention to their <b>educational</b> <b>outcome</b> and the inputs as well as processes leading to them.

25|$|Puntland has {{the lowest}} rate of poverty in Somalia, with 27%, {{compared}} to 50% in Somaliland and 57% in Mogadishu. Experts believe {{this is because of}} higher consumption and higher labour force participation. Households in Puntland consume a higher quantity per capita per item and more items per household. The lower rate of poverty {{does not appear to be}} driven by household size, as the average in Puntland is 5.2, compared to 5.7 in Somaliland and 4.5 in Mogadishu. Puntland is doing better in various important indicators of well-being. For instance, the literacy rate in Puntland is 64% compared to the national average of 55%. Additionally, households in Puntland also outperform the average in other <b>educational</b> <b>outcomes</b> such as enrolment and educational attainment. 70% of households in Puntland have access to improved water sources compared to the national average of 58%. Therefore, Puntland’s higher performance on non-monetary indicators of well-being are inline with its lower rate of poverty.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: One {{important}} <b>educational</b> <b>outcome</b> {{required of}} any engineering programme, as per ABET 2000 Criterion 3, {{is the ability}} of engineering graduates to design and conduct experiments, as well as the ability to analyse and interpret data and to design a system, component or process to meet desired needs.

This article presents the use of this approach in developing an experiment for a junior-level heat transfer laboratory. In this exercise, student teams design, build and test an experimental setup in which a solar collector is used to heat water in a reservoir. This kind of experience serves to enhance the understanding of the transfer of thermal energy by undergraduate mechanical engineering students, while also facilitating their exposure to several important concepts involved in heat transfer...|$|R
