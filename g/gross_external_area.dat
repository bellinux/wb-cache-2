40|$|Recent global {{imbalances}} {{and large}} <b>gross</b> <b>external</b> financial movements have raised interest in modeling {{the relationship between}} international financial market structure and capital flows. This paper constructs a model in which the composition of national portfolios is an essential element in facilitating international capital flows. Each country chooses an optimal portfolio in face of real and nominal risk. Current account deficits are financed by net capital flows which reflect differential movements in the holdings of <b>gross</b> <b>external</b> assets and liabilities. A country experiencing a current account deficit will be accumulating both <b>gross</b> <b>external</b> liabilities and <b>gross</b> <b>external</b> assets. Net capital flows generate movements in risk premiums such {{that the rate of}} return on a debtor country's gross liabilities is lower than the return on its gross assets. This ensures stability of the world wealth distribution. An attractive feature of the model is that portfolio shares, returns, and the wealth distribution can be characterized analytically. A calibrated version of the model can match quite well the observed measures of <b>gross</b> and net <b>external</b> assets and liabilities for the US economy. current account; international capital flows; portfolio...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the one and}} a half decades {{prior to}} the global {{financial}} crisis, advanced economies experienced a large growth in <b>gross</b> <b>external</b> portfolio positions. This phenomenon has been described as Financial Globalization. Over roughly the same time frame, most of these countries also saw a substantial fall in the level and variability of inflation. Many economists have conjectured that financial globalization contributed to the improved performance in the level and predictability of inflation. In this paper, we explore the causal link running in the opposite direction. We show that a monetary policy rule which reduces inflation variability leads to an increase in the size of <b>gross</b> <b>external</b> positions, both in equity and bond portfolios. This is a highly robust prediction of open economy macro models with endogenous portfolio choice. It holds across many different modeling specifications and parameterizations.

40|$|Since {{the early}} 1990 s Croatia has managed a rather {{successful}} transition process with solid growth, low inflation and exchange rate stability. Better integration into international financial markets, capital account liberalisation and banking sector reform have facilitated access to foreign financing {{and opened the}} country to strong and persistent capital inflows. A significant increase in Croatia's external debt {{over the last few}} years, and a recent widening of the current account deficit, have attracted the attention of policymakers and external observers alike. This Country Focus argues that a rise in external indebtedness has made Croatia more vulnerable to potential shocks, but also finds that sizeable foreign assets of the banking system and evidence about the existence of unrecorded foreign exchange holdings by the private non-banking sector mitigate external risks. Current account deficits have been driven by strong investment growth rather than a decline in domestic savings, thus providing some reassurance on sustainability issues. The Country Focus concludes that, in the specific setting of Croatia, further fiscal consolidation remains a key instrument to address external vulnerabilities and allow for a much needed further expansion of private-sector activities. In this context, deeper structural reforms could trigger a stronger supply response, raise potential output and improve competitiveness on a broader front. A significant rise in <b>gross</b> <b>external</b> debt …. Croatia's foreign indebtedness has risen significantly over the last few years, in both absolute and relative terms. Over the period 2001 - 2006 its <b>gross</b> <b>external</b> debt increased by more than € 16 billion, from 60 % to around 85 % of GDP. The strongest increases were in 2003 and 2004, when the debt ratio rose by almost 20 percentage points of GDP.
