50|$|Growth hormone secretagogues (GSHs) are a {{class of}} drugs which act as secretagogues (i.e., induce the secretion) of growth hormone (GH). They include {{agonists}} of the ghrelin/growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR), such as ghrelin (lenomorelin), pralmorelin (GHRP-2), GHRP-6, examorelin (hexarelin), <b>ipamorelin,</b> and ibutamoren (MK-677), and agonists of the growth hormone-releasing hormone receptor (GHRHR), such as growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) (somatorelin), CJC-1295, sermorelin, and tesamorelin. Many also induce the secretion of {{insulin-like growth factor 1}} (IGF-1), as well as of other hypothalamic-pituitary hormones such as prolactin and cortisol. The main clinical application of these agents is the treatment of growth hormone deficiency. They also see black market use, similarly to anabolic steroids, for bodybuilding purposes.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} and pharmacology {{of a new}} potent growth hormone (GH) secretagogue, <b>ipamorelin,</b> is described. <b>Ipamorelin</b> is a pentapeptide (Aib-His-D- 2 -Nal-D-Phe-Lys-NH 2), which displays high GH releasing potency and efficacy in vitro and in vivo. As an outcome of a major chemistry programme, <b>ipamorelin</b> was identified within a series of compounds lacking the central dipeptide Ala-Trp of growth hormone-releasing peptide (GHRP) - 1. In vitro, <b>ipamorelin</b> released GH from primary rat pituitary cells with a potency and efficacy similar to GHRP- 6 (EC 50 1. 3 � 0. 4 nmol/l and Emax 85 � 5 % vs 2. 2 � 0. 3 nmol/l and 100 %). A pharmacological profiling using GHRP and growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) antagonists clearly demonstrated that <b>ipamorelin,</b> like GHRP- 6, stimulates GH release via a GHRP-like receptor. In pentobarbital anaesthetised rats, <b>ipamorelin</b> released GH with a potency and efficacy comparable to GHRP- 6 (ED 50 80 � 42 nmol/kg and Emax 1545 � 250 ng GH/ml vs 115 � 36 nmol/kg and 1167 � 120 ng GH/ml). In conscious swine, <b>ipamorelin</b> released GH with an ED 50 2. 3 � 0. 03 nmol/kg and an Emax 65 � 0. 2 ng GH/ml plasma.

The goal {{of this study was}} to investigate whether <b>ipamorelin,</b> a synthetic peptidomimetic that acts on the ghrelin receptor, accelerates gastric emptying in a rodent model of gastroparesis induced by abdominal surgery and intestinal manipulation. Methods: Fasted adult male rats were subjected to laparotomy and intestinal manipulation. Following the surgery rats received <b>ipamorelin</b> (0. 014 &ndash; 0. 14 &micro;mol/kg) or vehicle control via intravenous administration. Gastric emptying was measured by the percent of total recovered radioactivity remaining in the stomach 15 minutes after intragastric gavage of 1. 5 mL of 99 mTc (technicium- 99 m) sulfur colloid in 0. 5 % methylcellulose. In a separate group of rats subjected to laparotomy and intestinal manipulation, the gastric fundus was isolated and tissue segments were suspended in an organ bath to assess the effect of <b>ipamorelin</b> (1 &micro;M) on gastric smooth muscle contractility induced by acetylcholine and electrical field stimulation. Results: Abdominal surgery caused a delay in gastric emptying with 78 % &plusmn; 5 % of the meal remaining in the stomach in vehicle controls. <b>Ipamorelin</b> (0. 014 &micro;mol/kg intravenous) resulted in a significant acceleration (P &lt; 0. 05 vs vehicle-treated rat) of gastric emptying with 52 % &plusmn; 11 % of the meal remaining in the stomach compared to nonsurgical control animals with 44 % &plusmn; 6 %. Following abdominal surgery and intestinal manipulation, isolated preparations of gastric smooth muscle exhibited a marked inhibition of acetylcholine and electrical field stimulation-induced contractile responses, which were reversed by <b>ipamorelin</b> and ghrelin. Conclusion: These results suggest that <b>ipamorelin</b> accelerates gastric emptying in a rodent model of postoperative ileus through the stimulation of gastric contractility by activating a ghrelin receptor-mediated mechanism involving cholinergic excitatory neurons.

40|$|The {{growth hormone}} (GH) and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) axis were studied in {{streptozotocin}} (STZ) diabetic and nondiabetic female mice following intravenous (IV) injection of the GH secretagogue (GHS) <b>ipamorelin</b> or saline. On day 14, blood samples were obtained before and 10 {{minutes after the}} injection. Livers were removed and frozen for determination of the mRNA expressions of the GH receptor, GH-binding protein, and IGF-I, and hepatic IGF-I peptide. Serum samples were analyzed for GH and IGF-I. Following <b>ipamorelin</b> injection, the GH levels {{were found to be}} 150 ± 35 µg/L and 62 ± 11 µg/L in the diabetic compared to the nondiabetic mice (P <. 05). Serum IGF-I levels were lower in diabetic than in nondiabetic animals, and rose after stimulation only in the nondiabetic animals. Furthermore, hepatic GH resistance and IGF-I mRNA levels and IGF-I peptide were increased in nondiabetic animals in response to GH stimulation, whereas the low levels per se of all these parameters in diabetic mice were unaffected.

40|$|J Svensson and S Lall {{have made}} an equal {{contribution}} to this paper) Growth hormone (GH) is of importance for normal bone remodelling. A recent clinical study demonstrated that MK- 677, {{a member of a}} class of GH secretagogues (GHSs), increases serum concentrations of biochemical markers of bone formation and bone resorption. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate whether the GHSs, <b>ipamorelin</b> (IPA) and GH-releasing peptide- 6 (GHRP- 6), increase bone mineral content (BMC) in young adult female rats. Thirteen-week-old female Sprague–Dawley rats were given IPA (0 · 5 mg/kg per day; n= 7), GHRP- 6 (0 · 5 mg/kg per day; n= 8), GH (3 · 5 mg/kg per day; n= 7), or vehicle administered continuously s. c. via osmotic minipumps for 12 weeks.

40|$|NN 703 {{is a novel}} orally active GH secretagogue (GHS) {{derived from}} <b>ipamorelin.</b> NN 703 stimulates GH release from rat {{pituitary}} cells in a dose-dependent manner with a potency and efficacy {{similar to that of}} GHRP- 6. The effect is inhibited by known GHS antagonists, but not by a GH-releasing hormone antagonist. Binding of 35 S-MK 677 to the human type 1 A GHS receptor (GHS-R 1 A) stably expressed on BHK cells was inhibited by GHRP- 6 and MK 677 as expected. NN 703 was also able to inhibit the binding of 35 S-MK 677. However, the observed Ki value was lower than expected, as based on the observed potencies regarding GH release from rat pituitary cells. Similarly, the effect of NN 703 on the GHS-R 1 A-induced inositol phosphate turnover in these cells showed a lower potency, when compared with GHRP- 6 and MK 677, than that observed in rat pituitary cells. The effect of i. v. administration of NN 703 on GH and cortisol release was studied in swine. The potency and efficacy of NN 703 on GH release were determined to be 155 6 23 nmol/kg and 91 6 7 ng GH/ml plasma respectively. A 50 % increase of cortisol, compared with basal levels, was observed for all the tested doses of NN 703, but no dose-dependency was shown...|$|E
40|$|The {{action of}} a number of growth hormone secretagogues (GHS) on growth hormone (GH) {{secretion}} and gene expression was studied in a primary culture of pituitary cells isolated from the black seabream Acanthopagrus schlegeli. The peptide GHS employed included growth hormone-releasing peptide (GHRP) - 2, <b>ipamorelin,</b> and human ghrelin. The nonpeptide GHS employed included the benzolactam GHS L 692, 585 and the spiropiperidine GHS L 163, 540. Secreted GH was measured in the culture medium by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method using a specific antibody against seabream GH. The GH mRNA content in the incubated cells was assessed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using a pair of gene-specific primers designed from the cloned black seabream GH cDNA sequence. A dose-dependent stimulation of GH release was demonstrated by all the GHS tested, except human ghrelin, with EC 50 values in the nanomolar range. Simultaneous measurement of GH mRNA levels in the incubated seabream pituitary cells indicated that the GHS-stimulated increase in GH secretion was not paralleled by corresponding changes in GH gene expression. In contrast to the situation previously reported in the rat, no change in GH gene expression was noticed in the seabream pituitary cells even though the time of stimulation by GHS was increased up to 48 h, confirming that the GHS-stimulated GH secretion in seabream is independent of GH gene transcription. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that ghrelin stimulates growth hormone release from the pituitary via the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR). We have previously isolated two GHSR subtypes from the pituitary of the black seabream Acanthopagrus schlegeli. In the present study, we have cloned and characterized ghrelin from the same fish species at both the cDNA and gene levels. The full-length seabream ghrelin cDNA, isolated from seabream stomach using a novel approach by exploiting a single conserved region in the coding region, was found to encode a prepropeptide of 107 amino acids, with the predicted mature ghrelin peptide consisting of 20 amino acids (GSSFLSPSQKPQNRGKSSRV). Embedded in this full-length cDNA is a putative fish orthologue of the recently reported mammalian obestatin peptide. The ghrelin gene in black seabream, obtained by genomic PCR, was found to encompass four exons and three introns, possessing the same structural organization as in tilapia and goldfish, but different from that in rainbow trout. In addition, a 2230 -bp 5 ′-flanking region of the seabream ghrelin gene was obtained by genome walking. Sequence analysis revealed that, {{as in the case of}} the human ghrelin gene, there is neither a GC box nor a CAAT box present in the isolated 5 ′-flanking region. However, a number of putative transcription factor-binding sites different from the human counterpart were found in the 5 ′-flanking region of the seabream ghrelin gene, suggesting that different cis- and trans-acting elements are involved in controlling their gene expression. Functional activity of this 5 ′-flanking region was examined by cloning it into the pGL 3 -Basic vector upstream of the luciferase reporter gene and transfected into various cell lines. Positive promoter activity could only be recorded in the colon-derived Caco- 2 cells, suggesting that the cloned 5 ′-flanking region represents the functional promoter of the seabream ghrelin gene, which exhibits tissue-specific promoter activity. Using reverse transcriptase PCR analysis, expression of ghrelin was detected only in the seabream stomach, but not in the other tissues examined, including the brain, gill, intestine, kidney, liver and spleen. This stomach-specific expression of ghrelin in seabream is subject to regulation, as administration of growth hormone or <b>ipamorelin</b> to the fish in vivo was demonstrated to enhance its expression. Reminiscent of the homologous upregulation found in the transcriptional control of the seabream GHSR gene, a similar homologous regulatory mechanism might also exist in controlling the expression of seabream ghrelin. The identification of both GHSR and ghrelin from a single fish species would facilitate our subsequent studies on the elucidation of the physiological functions of the ghrelin/GHSR, system in teleost.
