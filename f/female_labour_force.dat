5|$|Increasing labour export {{from the}} Philippines {{coincided with the}} {{economic}} rise of Hong Kong during the late 1970s and early 1980s. When the People's Republic of China implemented wide-reaching economic reform in the late 1970s and initiated trade with other countries, Hong Kong became mainland China's biggest investor. Labour-intensive Hong Kong industries moved to the mainland, and high-profit service industries in the territory (such as design, marketing and finance) expanded dramatically. To deal with the resulting labour shortage and increase in labour costs, the <b>female</b> <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> was mobilised. Two-income families sought help to manage their households, creating a demand for domestic workers. Female participation in the workforce increased, from 47.5 percent in 1982 to 54.7 percent in 2013. Families began hiring foreign domestic workers from the Philippines, {{with the number of}} workers steadily increasing during the 1980s and 1990s.|$|E

We find, first, that deaths of prime-age adults significantly increase both male and <b>female</b> adolescents' <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> participation as they stop their schooling. Secondly, the death of prime-age adults in general also decreases school enrolment "ex ante". Thirdly, female adults tend to join the <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> {{following the death of}} prime-age adult males.

2500|$|Although women play {{an active}} role in Pakistan's economy, their {{contribution}} has been grossly underreported in some censuses and surveys. [...] Part of the understimation of women's economic role is that Pakistan, like many other countries, has a very large informal sector. The 1991–92 Labour Force Survey revealed that only about 16% of women aged 10 years and over were in the labour force. According to World Bank, in 2014, women made up 22.3% of the labor force in Pakistan. According to the 1999 report by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, only two percent of Pakistani women participate in the formal sector of employment. However, the 1980 agricultural census stated that the women's participation rate in agriculture was 73%.

To preserve the possibility to compare the results presented in Table  2 with those presented in Table  5, the regional controls {{are not included in}} our main specification. We study the effect of these (and other) characteristics at the host-country level in the next section. We have also tested the inclusion of two additional controls: the distance between the capital of the home country and that of the host country so as to control for geographic proximity and the <b>female</b> to male <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> participation ratio in the home country. Results are absolutely similar and are available from the authors on request. We chose not to include these controls in our main specification because they may be endogenous. First, individuals willing to escape from their home country (for example in time of war) possibly tend to migrate further away and come from low-trusting countries. If we control for distance, the coefficient on trust in the home country would become insignificant, even in the presence of intergenerational transmission. Second, if there is a relationship between trust and the <b>female</b> to male <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> participation ratio, the direction of causality is unclear. It could very well be that trusting values are transmitted and then translate into similar behaviours across generations, such that the effect of trust in the home country could vanish, even if trust is transmitted across generations.|$|R

Continuing high rates of population growth and the declining availability of work based in the chula meant that more women sought employment outside the home. Accordingly, the <b>female</b> <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> participation rate doubled between 1974 and 1984, when it reached nearly 8 percent.

Findings confirm that the health services <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> was older than the <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> at large {{at the time of the}} 2006 Census of Population and that health service managers were also older than those in all industries. The age distribution of managers in health services showed skewness towards younger ages. As expected, those in senior positions tended to be older. Managers in aged care residential services were even older on average, following the older average age of the <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> in these services. In general, female managers tended to be younger than male managers. There was not much difference in the average age of health service managers among the states and territories. The same was the experience in aged care residential services. In a <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> where <b>females</b> were predominant, the majority of managers in health services and aged care residential services were also females.
