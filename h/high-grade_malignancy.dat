40|$|ObjectivesThe present multicenter study {{compared}} {{the usefulness of}} the solid tumor size with that of the whole tumor size on preoperative high-resolution computed tomography for predicting pathologic <b>high-grade</b> <b>malignancy</b> (positive lymphatic, vascular, or pleural invasion) and the prognosis of clinical stage IA lung adenocarcinoma. MethodsWe performed high-resolution computed tomography and F- 18 fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography before curative surgical resection in 502 patients with clinical stage IA lung adenocarcinoma. The revised maximum standardized uptake values on F- 18 fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography were used to correct interinstitutional discrepancies. The whole and solid tumor sizes on high-resolution computed tomography were then analyzed in relation to surgical results. ResultsThe mean whole and solid tumor size was 1. 97 ± 0. 59 cm and 1. 20 ± 0. 88 cm, respectively. The receiver operating characteristics area under the curve for the whole and solid tumor sizes used to identify <b>high-grade</b> <b>malignancy</b> were 0. 590 and 0. 829, respectively. Multiple logistic regression analyses demonstrated solid tumor size (P < . 001) and maximum standardized uptake values of the tumor (P < . 001) as independent variables for the prediction of <b>high-grade</b> <b>malignancy.</b> Multivariate Cox analysis of disease-free survival demonstrated the former (hazard ratio, 2. 30; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 46 - 3. 63; P < . 001) and latter (hazard ratio, 1. 08; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 00 - 1. 17; P = . 05) as independent prognostic factors. ConclusionsThe solid tumor size on high-resolution computed tomography and maximum standardized uptake values on positron emission tomography/computed tomography have greater predictive value for <b>high-grade</b> <b>malignancy</b> and prognosis in clinical stage IA lung adenocarcinoma than that of whole tumor size...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} 3 -yr-old {{girl with a}} virilizing adrenocortical {{carcinoma}} invading into the right atrium with histological <b>high-grade</b> <b>malignancy</b> and p 53 mutation. Development of facial acne and pubic hair were noted at 3 yr and 2 mo. The levels of androgens were high. Diurnal variation in ACTH and cortisol were absent. Abdominal computed tomography revealed a large right suprarenal mass, with extension into the inferior vena cava and right atrium. Based on the diagnosis of a right virilizing adrenocortical tumor with Cushing syndrome, surgery was performed by a combined thoracoabdominal approach with the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass. The tumor was 7 × 5. 5 × 3. 5 cm in size, and weighed 95 g. The histological diagnosis was adrenocartical carcinoma with <b>high-grade</b> <b>malignancy</b> according to the category of Weiss. A heterozygous mutation of the p 53 tumor-suppressor gene (codon 248 CGC→TGG) was found. We did not perform adjuvant chemotherapy because of radical resection on macroscopic observation and no metastasis in radiological findings. Five months after the surgery, her chest X ray and computed tomography revealed multiple lung metastases and a single liver metastasis. In this type of patient with histological <b>high-grade</b> <b>malignancy</b> and p 53 mutations, postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy is indicated even if macroscopic total surgical removal had been performed.

40|$|Background: Optimal {{chemotherapy}} {{with minimal}} toxicity {{is the main}} determinant of complete remission in patients with newly diagnosed hematological malignancies. Acute organ dysfunctions may impair the patient’s ability to receive optimal chemotherapy. Design and Methods: To compare 6 -month complete remission rates in patients with and without acute kidney injury (AKI), we collected prospective data on 200 patients with newly diagnosed <b>high-grade</b> <b>malignancies</b> (non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 53. 5 %; acute myeloid leukemia, 29 %; acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 11. 5 %; and Hodgkin disease, 6 %). Results: According to RIFLE criteria, 137 (68. 5 %) patients had AKI. Five causes of AKI accounted for 91. 4 % of cases: hypoperfusion, tumor lysis syndrome, tubular necrosis, nephrotoxic agents, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Half of the AKI patients received renal replacement therapy and 14. 6 % received suboptimal chemotherapy.

40|$|While a {{coherent}} picture {{has begun to}} emerge about the biological and molecular mechanisms that create primary tumors, the processes that lead subsequently to invasion and metastasis have, until recently, been relatively obscure. However, over the past 5 years, research of diverse sorts has begun to generate the conceptual outlines that explain how <b>high-grade</b> <b>malignancies</b> arise. These discussions invariably are mo-tivated by a widely accepted depiction of how metastatic dissemina-tion occurs—the sequence termed the ‘invasion–metastasis cascade’ (1). Thus, primary tumor cells invade locally, enter into the circulation (intravasation), are transported through the circulation, are lodged in microvessels in distant tissues, invade the parenchyma of such tissue (extravasation) and form micrometastatic deposits, some of which eventually grow into macroscopic metastases, the last process being termed colonization.

40|$|Aim: Retroperitoneal soft-tissue sarcomas are {{relatively}} uncommon diseases, {{the most frequent}} histotype, ranging from 20 % to 45 % of all cases, is represented by liposarcoma, which is a hard-to treat condition for its local aggressiveness and clinical aspecificity. Presentation of case: We report {{a case of a}} 64 -years-old woman who underwent surgical resection for a giant pleomorphic retroperitoneal liposarcoma. Discussion: Currently chemotherapy for retroperitoneal soft-tissue sarcomas is no effective, and radiotherapy has limited efficacy due to the toxicity affecting adjacent intra-abdominal structures, showed validity only in case of <b>high-grade</b> <b>malignancy</b> by reducing local recurrence, but with no advantage in overall survival. Nowadays only, the complete surgical resection remains the most important predictor of local recurrence and overall survival. Conclusion: The removal of a retroperitoneal sarcoma of remarkable size is a challenge for the surgeon owing to the anatomical site, to the absence of an anatomically evident vascular-lymphatic peduncle and to the adhesions contracted with the contiguous organs and with the great vessels. Therefore, we believe that, particularly for large-size diseases associated to <b>high-grade</b> <b>malignancy,</b> a complete surgical resection with removal of the contiguous intra and retroperitoneal organs when infiltrated represents the only therapeutic option to obtain a negative margin and therefore an oncological radicality...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Extrapulmonary poorly {{differentiated}} neuroendocrine car-cinomas can {{originate in}} the gastrointestinal tract, bladder, cervix, and prostate. These <b>high-grade</b> <b>malignancies</b> are characterized by aggressive histological features (high mitotic rate, extensive necrosis, and nuclear atypia) and a poor clinical prognosis. They are infrequently associated with secretory hormonal syndromes (such as the carcinoid syndrome) and rarely express somatostatin receptors. Most poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas are locally ad-vanced or metastatic at presentation. First-line systemic chemotherapywith a platinum agent (cisplatin or carboplatin) and etoposide is recommended for most patients with metastatic-stage disease; however, response dura-tions are often short. Sequential or concurrent chemoradiation is recom-mended for patients with loco-regional disease. In patients with localized tumors undergoing surgical resection, adjuvant treatment (chemotherapy with or without radiation) is warranted in most cases.

40|$|AbstractTumours {{are highly}} complex tissues {{composed}} of carcinoma cells and surrounding stroma, which is constructed by various {{different types of}} mesenchymal cells and an extracellular matrix (ECM). Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which consist of both fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, are frequently observed in the stroma of human carcinomas, and their presence in large numbers {{is often associated with}} the development of <b>high-grade</b> <b>malignancies</b> and poor prognoses. Moreover, in human tumour xenograft models, CAFs extracted from the tumour are more capable of promoting tumour growth through their interactions with carcinoma cells when compared to those isolated from non-cancerous stroma. Taken together, these observations strongly suggest that CAFs actively contribute to tumour progression. In this review we highlight the emerging roles of these cells in promoting tumourigenesis, and we discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying their tumour-promoting capabilities and their cellular origin...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} the expression and prognostic value of various hormones and molecular markers {{playing a role}} n endometrioid endometrial cancer. Especially {{we were interested in}} the enzyme aromatase, its expression and (prognostic) role in endometrioid endometrial cancer. Endometrial cancer is the most common genital tract malignancy in women. Two major histological types can be distinguished; endometrioid endometrial cancer, and nonendometrioid endometrial cancer including <b>high-grade</b> <b>malignancies</b> like serous papillary and clear cell carcinoma. The most common form, involving more than 75 % of all cases of endometrial cancer is endometrioid carcinoma. Generally it is believed that continuous estrongenic hyperstimulation of the postmenopausal endometrium gives rise to endometrial tissue hyperplasia followed by atypical hyperplasia. Eventually endometrioid endometrial cancer may develop. These estrogens mainly originate from peripheral conversion in body fat and androgens, originating from the adrenal glands and ovaries. The enzyme complex cytochrome P 450 aromatase, main subject of this thesis, {{plays a key role in}} the (peripheral) conversion of androgens into estrogens. ...|$|R

This tumor is commonly associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF 1) and previous radiotherapy treatment. Primary intraos-seous MPNSTs are extremely rare and {{a case of the}} lumbar spine in a patient without NF 1 is reported in the present study, with a review of the intraosseous MPNST literature. A 45 ‑year‑old female presented with a 1 ‑month history of severe lower back pain and pain radiating to the left leg. A total en bloc spondylectomy of L 4 was performed. The postopera-tive histopathological diagnosis was MPNST with deletion of NF 1, confirmed by dual‑color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. The tumor recurred 1 month following the surgery. Although adjuvant chemotherapy was administered, the patient succumbed due to intramedullary dissemination and carcinomatous meningitis 8 months following the initial consultation.

40|$|Human carcinomas {{frequently}} exhibit significant stromal reactions such as {{the so-called}} “desmoplastic stroma” or “reactive stroma”, which is characterised by the existence {{of large numbers of}} stromal cells and extracellular matrix proteins. Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which are rich in activated fibroblast populations exemplified by myofibroblasts, are among the predominant cell types present within the tumour-associated stroma. Increased numbers of stromal myofibroblasts are often associated with <b>high-grade</b> <b>malignancies</b> with poor prognoses in humans. CAF myofibroblasts possess abilities to promote primary tumour development, growth and progression by stimulating the processes of neoangiogenesis as well as tumour cell proliferation, survival, migration and invasion. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that CAFs serve as a niche supporting the metastatic colonisation of disseminated carcinoma cells in distant organs. Their contribution to primary and secondary malignancies makes these fibroblasts a potential therapeutic target and they also appear to be relevant to the development of drug resistance and tumour recurrence. This review summarises our current knowledge of tumour-promoting CAFs and discusses the therapeutic feasibility of targeting these cells as well as disrupting heterotypic interactions with other cell types in tumours that may improve the efficacy of current anti-tumour therapies...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effect on {{survival}} of delaying the start of adjuvant chemotherapy for early breast cancer for up to 3 months after surgery. In the nation-wide clinical trials of the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group, 7501 breast cancer patients received chemotherapy within 3 months of surgery between 1977 and 1999 : 352 with classical cyclofosfamide, metotrexate and 5 -fluorouracil (CMF); 6065 with CMF i. v. and 1084 with cyclofosfamide, epirubicin and 5 -fluorouracil. For the analysis, the time between surgery and the start of chemotherapy was divided into four strata (1 – 3, 4, 5 and 6 – 13 weeks). The results show that within the three groups of chemotherapy, there was an even distribution of known prognostic factors across the four strata of initiation of chemotherapy. There was no pattern indicating a benefit from early start of chemotherapy. No significant interactions were found for subgroups of patients with a poorer prognosis (many involved lymph nodes, <b>high-grade</b> <b>malignancies</b> or hormone receptor negative disease).

40|$|AbstractBackgroundDiverse {{treatments}} {{are available for}} different histological types of thyroid lymphoma: concurrent chemoradiotherapy for diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and radiotherapy or thyroidectomy for low-grade mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. However, diagnosing lymphomas before operation is difficult, because the diagnostic yield of fine-needle biopsies {{is limited by the}} rarity of the disease. Therefore, patients may undergo unnecessary thyroidectomies. PurposeTo investigate the efficacy of various biopsy procedures and explore indications for thyroidectomy in patients with primary thyroid lymphomas. MethodsThe demographics, types of biopsy procedures, treatments, and outcome data of patients diagnosed with primary thyroid lymphoma at Tri-Service General Hospital between 1992 and 2015 were retrospectively collected. ResultsTen patients received a diagnosis of primary thyroid lymphomas: eight with DLBCL and two with MALT lymphoma. None of these patients received a definitive diagnosis after fine-needle aspiration biopsies; however, six patients received their diagnosis and histological-subtype classification after core-needle biopsies. Before 2004, three patients with DLBCL underwent thyroidectomies for diagnostic purposes and one encountered vocal cord palsy. By contrast, two patients with localized MALT lymphoma underwent thyroidectomies for treatment, with both experiencing favorable outcomes and prognoses. ConclusionCore-needle biopsy is superior to fine-needle biopsy for diagnosing primary thyroid lymphomas without increasing complications. Thyroidectomy in localized, low-grade MALT lymphoma of the thyroid can cure the disease and exclude <b>high-grade</b> <b>malignancies</b> in the remaining glands. By contrast, DLBCL should be treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy after diagnosis through biopsy, and extensive surgery should be avoided...|$|R
40|$|Cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) /cancer-initiating cells (CICs) {{are defined}} as a small {{population}} of cancer cells that have high tumorigenicity. Furthermore, CSCs/CICs are resistant to several cancer therapies, and CSCs/CICs are therefore thought {{to be responsible for}} cancer recurrence after treatment and distant metastasis. In epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cases, disease recurrence after chemotherapy is frequently observed, suggesting ovarian CSCs/CICs are involved. There are four major histological subtypes in EOC, and serous adenocarcinoma and clear cell adenocarcinoma are <b>high-grade</b> <b>malignancies.</b> We therefore analyzed ovarian CSCs/CICs from ovarian carcinoma cell lines (serous adenocarcinoma and clear cell adenocarcinoma) and primary ovarian cancer cells in this study. We isolated ovarian CSCs/CICs as an aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 high (ALDH 1 (high)) population from 6 EOC cell lines (3 serous adenocarcinomas and 3 clear cell adenocarcinomas) by the ALDEFLUOR assay. ALDH 1 (high) cells showed greater sphere-forming ability, higher tumorigenicity and greater invasive capability, indicating that ovarian CSCs/CICs are enriched in ALDH 1 (high) cells. ALDH 1 (high) cells could also be isolated from 8 of 11 primary ovarian carcinoma samples. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that higher ALDH 1 expression levels in ovary cancer cases are related to poorer prognosis in both serous adenocarcinoma cases and clear cell adenocarcinoma cases. Taken together, the results indicate that ALDH 1 is a marker for ovarian CSCs/CICs and that the expression level of ALDH 1 might be a novel biomarker for prediction of poor prognosis...|$|R

The authors report 6 patients with APG tumours emphasizing the diagnosis, clinical features, indications and rationales for different treatment approaches. Patients with primary tumours of the parotid gland or APG tumours who underwent surgical treatment were included. APG tumours comprised 1. 23 % of overall parotid tumours (6 / 488) and had a malignancy rate of 33. 3 % (2 / 6).

We therefore evaluated the utility of 18 F-FDG PET in management for patients with salivary gland cancers. Methods: Thirty-four patients with newly diag-nosed salivary gland cancers underwent CT and 18 F-FDG PET before surgical resection with radiotherapy. The diagnostic ac-curacies of CT and 18 F-FDG PET for detecting primary tumors and neck metastases were compared with a histopathologic ref-erence. We determined {{the relationship between the}} maximum standardized uptake value (SUV) of the tumor and clinicopatho-logic parameters such as sex, age, local tumor invasion, T and N categories, TNM stage, and histologic grade, as well as their as-sociations with disease-free survival (DFS). Results: 18 F-FDG PET was more sensitive than CT for the detection of primary tu-mors (91. 2 % vs. 79. 4 %; P, 0. 05), cervical metastases (80. 5 % vs. 56. 1 %; P, 0. 05), and distant metastases in 2 patients at ini-tial staging. <b>High-grade</b> <b>malignancies</b> had higher mean maxi-mum SUVs than did low- and intermediate-grade malignancies (4. 6 vs. 2. 8;P 5 0. 011). T andN categories were independent de-terminants of DFS (P, 0. 05), but the maximum SUV (4. 0) was not. During a mean follow-up of 25. 1 mo, 18 F-FDG PET correctly diagnosed local–regional recurrences in 6 patients and new dis-tant metastases in 9 patients. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that, in patients with salivary glandmalignancies, 18 F-FDGPET is clinically useful in initial staging, histologic grading, and monitor-ing after treatment but not in predicting patient survival.

40|$|African Americans {{are disproportionately}} {{affected}} by early-onset, <b>high-grade</b> <b>malignancies.</b> A fraction of this cancer health disparity {{can be explained}} by genetic differences between individuals of African or European descent. Here the wild-type Pro/Pro genotype at the TP 53 Pro 72 Arg (P 72 R) polymorphism (SNP: rs 1042522) is more frequent in African Americans with cancer than in African Americans without cancer (51 % vs. 37 %), and is associatedwith {{a significant increase in the}} rates of cancer diagnosis inAfricanAmericans. To test the hypothesis that Tp 53 allele–specific gene expression may contribute to African American cancer disparities, TP 53 hemizygous knockout variants were generated and characterized in the RKO colon carcinoma cell line, which is wild type for TP 53 and heterozygous at the TP 53 Pro 72 Arg locus. Transcriptome profiling, using RNAseq, in response to the DNA-damaging agent etoposide revealed a large number of Tp 53 -regulated transcripts, but also a subset of transcripts that wereTP 53 Pro 72 Arg allele specific. In addition, a shRNA-library suppressor screen for Tp 53 allele– specific escape from Tp 53 -induced arrest was performed. Several novel RNAi suppressors of Tp 53 were identified, one ofwhich,PRDM 1 b (BLIMP- 1), was confirmed to be anArg-specific transcript. Prdm 1 b silences target genes by recruiting H 3 K 9 trimethyl (H 3 K 9 me 3) repressive chromatin marks, and is necessary for stem cell differentiation. These results reveal a novel model for African American cancer disparity, in which the TP 53 codon 72 allele influences lifetime cancer risk by driving damaged cells to differentiation through an epigenetic mechanism involving gene silencing. Implications: TP 53 P 72 R polymorphism significantly contributes to increased African American cancer disparity. Mol Cancer Res; 12 (7); 1029 – 41. 2014 AACR...|$|R
40|$|We have {{reviewed}} 16 {{cases of}} soft tissue sarcomas {{of the upper}} limb treated with wide excision of the tumour and immediate soft tissue reconstruction {{by means of a}} microvascular flap. 9 patients were males, 7 females; age ranged from 12 to 74 years. All the patients had been referred to us after previous failed or inadequate excisions. All the tumours were <b>high-grade</b> <b>malignancies</b> in an extracompartmental location (stade IIB according to Enneking). Histopathologic diagnosis was : synovial-sarcoma in 11 cases; fibrosarcoma in 2 cases; malignant fibrous histiocytoma in 1 case, soft tissue osteosarcoma in 1 case, epitheloid sarcoma in 1 case. The site of the tumour was the hand in 2 cases, the wrist in 6 cases, the forearm in 5 cases and the elbow in 3 cases. The free flaps used for soft tissue reconstructions were the latissimus dorsi in 6 cases, the dorsalis pedis in 2 cases, the lateral arm flap in 2 cases, the serratus in 1 case, the gracilis in 1 case. The island flaps were the radial forearm flap in 1 case, the posterior interosseous flap in 1 case, the cubital flap in 1 case. 14 cases required immediate associated reconstructive procedures such as tendon transfers or grafts (5 cases), vascularized or non vascularized bone grafts (4 cases), articular allografts (1 case), ligament reconstruction (1 case), nerve grafts (2 cases). Brachytherapy was associated to microsurgical reconstruction in the last 6 cases of this group. The catheters were charged with the radioisotope 5 days after surgery. No complications were observed. At the last follow-up 12 patients had no evidence of disease with a good or excellent functional result; 2 cases presented no new sign of disease after having been amputated because of a local recurrence; on subject is alive after lung metastasectomy; one patient is dead with distant metastases...|$|R
