2500|$|Generally, lichen nitidus is {{asymptomatic}} and self-limited; therefore, {{no treatment}} is required. [...] However, if persistent pruritus is present, or the appearance “...interferes with daily activities or outlook...” topical glucocorticoids may be tried. [...] If the disease process is symptomatic, generalized and extensive, oral glucocorticoids may be indicated. [...] Other reported treatments include PUVA, UVA/UVB phototherapy, astemizole, acitretin, and <b>etretinate.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Isotretinoin has {{a number}} of muscoloskeletal effects. Myalgia (muscular pain) and {{arthralgia}} (joint pain) are rare side effects. [...] Retinoids, such as high dose <b>etretinate,</b> are well-known to cause bone changes, {{the most common type of}} which is hyperostotic changes (excessive bone growth), especially in growing children and adolescents. Other problems include premature epiphyseal closure and calcification of tendons and ligaments. The bones of the spine and feet are most commonly affected. Risk factors for skeletal effects include older age, greater dosage and longer course of treatment. Most bone changes cause no symptoms and may only be noticed using X-ray imaging.|$|E
2500|$|Color {{dilution}} alopecia is {{an inherited}} type of follicular dysplasia. [...] It most commonly affects dogs with blue or fawn coats, which are dilutions {{of black and}} brown, respectively. [...] Dilution is caused by irregularities in melanin transfer and storage. [...] Melanosomes may clump within melanocytes of the skin and hair follicles, causing the hair shafts to easily fracture. [...] Signs of color dilution alopecia include hair loss and recurrent skin infection on the back. [...] It can involve the whole body. [...] The condition starts {{between the ages of}} six months and two years, depending on the degree of dilution. [...] Early hair loss occurs due to hair breakage, making it similar to structural follicular alopecia. [...] It is important to treat the skin infections, and <b>etretinate</b> has been used to treat the hair loss.|$|E
2500|$|Donors are {{screened}} for health risks {{that could make}} the donation unsafe for the recipient. [...] Some of these restrictions are controversial, such as restricting donations from MSM (men {{who have sex with}} men) for HIV risk. In 2011, the UK (excluding Northern Ireland) reduced its blanket ban on MSM donors to a narrower restriction which only prevents MSM from donating blood if they have had sex with other men within the past year. A similar change was made in the U.S. in late 2015 by the FDA. [...] Autologous donors are not always {{screened for}} recipient safety problems since the donor is the only person who will receive the blood. Since the donated blood may be given to pregnant women or a women of child-bearing age, donors taking teratogenic (birth defect causing) medications are deferred. These medications include acitretin, <b>etretinate,</b> isotretinoin, finasteride and dutasteride.|$|E
2500|$|Currently, {{there is}} no cure for Urbach–Wiethe disease {{although}} there are some ways to individually treat many of its symptoms. [...] There has been some success with oral dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and intralesional heparin, but this is not true in all cases. D-penicillamine has also shown promise, but has yet to have been used extensively. [...] There are also some reports of patients being treated with <b>etretinate,</b> a drug typically prescribed to treat psoriasis. In some cases, calcifications in the brain can lead to abnormal electrical activity among neurons. [...] Some patients are given anti-seizure medication to help deal with these abnormalities. [...] Tracheostomy is often used to relieve upper respiratory tract infections. Carbon dioxide laser surgery of thickened vocal cords and beaded eyelid papules have improved these symptoms for patients. [...] The discovery of the mutations of the ECM1 gene has opened the possibility of gene therapy or a recombinant EMC1 protein for Urbach–Wiethe disease treatment, but neither of these two options are currently available.|$|E
50|$|Treatment with <b>etretinate</b> {{has been}} described.|$|E
5000|$|Second {{generation}} include <b>etretinate</b> and its metabolite acitretin ...|$|E
50|$|It is a {{metabolite}} of <b>etretinate,</b> {{which was}} used prior {{to the introduction of}} acitretin. <b>Etretinate</b> was discontinued because it had a narrow therapeutic index as well as a long elimination half-life (t1/2=120 days), making dosing difficult. In contrast, acitretin's half-life is approximately 2 days. However, because acitretin can be reverse metabolised into <b>etretinate</b> which has an extremely long half-life, women must avoid becoming pregnant {{for at least three years}} after discontinuing acitretin. Therefore, acitretin is generally not recommended for women of child-bearing age with a risk of becoming pregnant.|$|E
50|$|<b>Etretinate</b> {{has been}} {{replaced}} by acitretin, the free acid (without the ethyl ester). While acitretin is less lipophilic and has a half-life of only 50 hours, it is partly metabolized to <b>etretinate</b> in the body, so that it is still a long-acting teratogen and pregnancy is prohibited for two years after therapy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Etretinate</b> is {{a highly}} lipophilic, {{aromatic}} retinoid. It is stored and released from adipose tissue, so its effects can continue long after dosage stops. It is detectable in the plasma {{for up to three}} years following therapy. <b>Etretinate</b> has a low therapeutic index and a long elimination half-life (t1/2) of 120 days, which make dosing difficult.|$|E
50|$|<b>Etretinate</b> {{should be}} avoided in children, as it may {{interfere}} with bone growth.|$|E

50|$|Long term {{treatment}} of acne with vitamin derived retinoids, such as <b>etretinate</b> and acitretin, {{have been associated}} with extraspinal hyperostosis.|$|E
5000|$|Oral retinoids {{have proven}} {{effective}} in treating this disorder. Depending {{on the side}} effects they may {{improve the quality of}} life. Examples are <b>etretinate,</b> acitretin, isotretinoin ...|$|E
50|$|Oral retinoids (e.g., acitretin, <b>etretinate)</b> may {{be helpful}} in {{treating}} arsenic-induced cutaneous lesions and in {{reducing the risk of}} cutaneous and internal malignancy formation, especially in Bowman's disease.|$|E
50|$|<b>Etretinate</b> is a teratogen, and {{may cause}} birth defects long after use. Therefore, birth control is advised during therapy, and {{for at least}} three years after therapy has stopped.|$|E
50|$|There is no {{effective}} treatment for this condition. It {{has been reported}} that clearance of lesions can be done with melphalan and cyclophosphamide alone or in combination with prednisone. Both isotretinoin and <b>etretinate</b> have also been shown to improve the conditions. All medications listed can cause adverse symptoms, with isotretinoin and <b>etretinate</b> particularly dangerous since they are both teratogens. Other attempted treatments include interferon-alpha, cyclosporine, PUVA photochemotherapy, electron-beam therapy, IVIg, and dermabrasion. However, the overall prognosis for the disease is poor. There are reported instances of remission of the disease when treated with a combination of Revlimid and Dexamethasone over a 24-month period.|$|E
50|$|If {{a patient}} has ever taken <b>etretinate,</b> {{he or she}} is not {{eligible}} to donate blood in the United States or the United Kingdom, due to the risk of birth defects. In Japan, people may not donate blood for two years after ceasing to use the medication.|$|E
50|$|There is no cure. Early in life {{constant}} {{supportive care}} is typically required. Treatments may include moisturizing cream, antibiotics, <b>etretinate,</b> or retinoids. It affects about 1 per 300,000 births. Both sexes are affected equally commonly. Long term problems are common. Death {{in the first}} month is relatively common. The condition was first documented in 1750.|$|E
50|$|<b>Etretinate</b> (trade name Tegison) is a {{medication}} developed by Hoffmann-La Roche that {{was approved by}} the FDA in 1986 to treat severe psoriasis. It is a second-generation retinoid. It was subsequently removed from the Canadian market in 1996 and the United States market in 1998 due to the high risk of birth defects. It remains on the market in Japan as Tigason.|$|E
5000|$|Common {{causes of}} drug-related {{cheilitis}} include <b>Etretinate,</b> Indinavir, Protease inhibitors, Vitamin A and Isotretinoin (a retinoid drug). Uncommon causes include Atorvastatin, Busulphan, Clofazimine, Clomipramine, Cyancobalamin, Gold, Methyldopa, Psoralens, Streptomycin, Sulfasalazine and Tetracycline. A condition called [...] "drug-induced ulcer of the lip" [...] {{is described as}} being characterized by painful or tender, well-defined ulcerations of the lip without induration. It {{is the result of}} oral administration of drugs, and the condition resolves when the drugs are stopped.|$|E
50|$|Retinoid <b>etretinate</b> is {{effective}} for both arthritis and skin lesions. Photochemotherapy with methoxy psoralen and long-wave ultraviolet light (PUVA) {{are used for}} severe skin lesions. Doctors may use joint injections with corticosteroids in cases where one joint is severely affected. In psoriatic arthritis patients with severe joint damage orthopedic surgery may be implemented to correct joint destruction, usually {{with the use of}} a joint replacement. Surgery {{is effective}} for pain alleviation, correcting joint disfigurement, and reinforcing joint usefulness and strength.|$|E
50|$|Topical steroid {{preparations}} often help outbreaks; use of {{the weakest}} corticosteroid that is effective is recommended to help prevent thinning of the skin. Drugs such as antibiotics, antifungals, corticosteroids, dapsone, methotrexate, thalidomide, <b>etretinate,</b> cyclosporine and, most recently, intramuscular alefacept may control the disease but are ineffective for severe chronic or relapsing forms of the disease. Intracutaneous injections of botulinum toxin to inhibit perspiration may be of benefit. Maintaining a healthy weight, avoiding heat and friction of affected areas, and keeping the area clean and dry may help prevent flares.|$|E
50|$|Ainhum is an {{acquired}} and progressive condition, and thus differs from congenital annular constrictions. Ainhum {{has been much}} confused with similar constrictions caused by other diseases such as leprosy, diabetic gangrene, syringomyelia, scleroderma or Vohwinkel syndrome. In this case, it is called pseudo-ainhum, treatable with minor surgery or intralesional corticosteroids, as with ainhum. It has even been seen in psoriasis or it is acquired by the wrapping toes, penis or nipple with hairs, threads or fibers. Oral retinoids, such as tretinoin, and antifibrotic agents like tranilast have been tested for pseudo-ainhum. Impending amputation in Vohwinkel syndrome can sometimes be aborted by therapy with oral <b>etretinate.</b> It is rarely seen in the United States but often discussed in the international medical literature.|$|E

5000|$|In 1875, Weir {{reported}} {{what was}} possible vulvar or oral LS as [...] "ichthyosis". In 1885, Breisky described kraurosis vulvae. In 1887, Hallopeau describes series of extragenital LS. In 1892, Darier formally describes classic histopathology of LS. From 1900 to present, the concept starts being formed that scleroderma and LS are closely related. In 1901, Pediatric LS was described. From 1913 to present, {{the concept that}} scleroderma is not closely related to LS also starts being formed. In 1920, Taussig establishes vulvectomy as treatment of choice for kraurosis vulvae, a premalignant condition. In 1927, Kyrle defines LS ("white spot disease") as entity sui generis. In 1928, Stühmer describes balanitis xerotica obliterans as postcircumcision phenomenon. In 1936, Retinoids (vitamin A) used in LS. In 1945, Testosterone used in genital LS. In 1961, the use of corticosteroids started. In Jeffcoate presents argument against vulvectomy for simple LS. In 1971, Progesterone used in LS, Wallace defines clinical factors and epidemiology of LS for all later reports. In 1976, Friedrich defines LS as a dystrophic, not atrophic condition; [...] "et atrophicus" [...] dropped. International Society for Study of Vulvar Disease classification system. [...] "Kraurosis" [...] and [...] "leukoplakia" [...] no longer to be used. In 1980, Fluourinated and superpotent steroids used in LS. In 1981, studies into HLA serotypes and LS. In 1984, <b>Etretinate</b> and acetretin used in LS. In 1987, LS linked with Borrelia infection.|$|E
40|$|Since <b>etretinate,</b> an {{aromatic}} retinoid {{useful in}} the treatment of psoriasis and other skin disorders is lipid-soluble, it may be poorly absorbed {{in the absence of a}} fat load. We therefore studied serum concentrations of <b>etretinate</b> and its major metabolite (Ro 10 - 1670) after the controlled administration of <b>etretinate.</b> After an overnight fast, 6 Darier's disease and 4 psoriatic patients received a 1 mg/kg morning dose of <b>etretinate</b> with water or 1 pint of whole milk (fat load). There was a 260 % increase (p < 0. 0005) in the mean of each patient's increase in the baseline-corrected peak serum concentration of <b>etretinate</b> after administration with milk (115 ± 15 μg/dl) compared to after administration with water (32 ± 4 μg/dl). Over a 24 -h period there was an overall 296 ± 26 % (p < 0. 0005) increase in serum <b>etretinate</b> after administration with milk compared to water in 5 patients with Darier's disease. In contrast to the serum <b>etretinate,</b> there was a 17 % mean decrease (p < 0. 025) in the corrected peak serum concentration of Ro 10 - 1670 in all 10 patients after administration of <b>etretinate</b> with milk compared to water. The net result of these alterations is that the mean corrected serum concentration of <b>etretinate</b> is higher than Ro 10 - 1670 at all time points measured after milk administration. In contrast, after administration of <b>etretinate</b> with water the major retinoid in the serum is Ro 10 - 1670. Establishing the clinical significance of these alterations may require controlled clinical trials...|$|E
40|$|Acitretin was {{introduced}} {{as a replacement}} for <b>etretinate,</b> the ethyl ester of acitretin. Acitretin is eliminated at a much faster rate than <b>etretinate.</b> Although both drugs are teratogens, the replacement was important especially as it allowed for a much shorter post-medication period in which pregnancy should be precluded. Recent findings showed the presence of <b>etretinate</b> in the plasma of acitretin-treated patients. This article gives a review of known metabolic pathways of the retinoids and tries to elucidate the possible conversion of acitretin into <b>etretinate</b> after acitretin ingestion...|$|E
40|$|Laboratory studies, and one {{previous}} uncontrolled trial, {{have suggested}} that retinoids may reverse bronchial atypia, a putatively premalignant condition. Sputum sampling is a simple, non-invasive method of assessing atypia. Smokers {{with at least a}} 15 pack-year history were screened for sputum atypia. One hundred and fifty subjects' were randomised to receive the synthetic retinoid <b>etretinate</b> 25 mg orally or identical placebo daily for 6 months. Compliance was measured by performing pill counts and serum sampling every 2 months for <b>etretinate</b> levels. The outcomes assessed were, improvements in sputum atypia and toxicity. At baseline {{there was no significant difference}} between the two groups with respect to gender, smoking history or extent of atypia. Four of 75 subjects on <b>etretinate</b> and six of 75 on placebo dropped out before 6 months. Compliance as measured by pill counts and <b>etretinate</b> levels was high. Eighty-six per cent of subjects on <b>etretinate</b> took 90 % or more of their prescribed medication and <b>etretinate</b> was detected in 245 of 264 samples. By contrast <b>etretinate</b> was detected in only six of 266 samples in the control group and probably did not represent true contamination. After 6 months on <b>etretinate</b> there was no difference in the degree of atypia between the two treatment arms. Toxicity was mild in both groups with considerable placebo effect noted. <b>Etretinate,</b> at the dose used in this study, had no impact on sputum atypia as detected by sputum sampling...|$|E
40|$|Acitretin has {{recently}} been introduced to replace <b>etretinate</b> {{in the treatment of}} severe psoriasis due to a considerable shorter terminal half-life. The previously recommended 2 -month anticonceptive period after acitretin treatment has been extended to 2 years after the detection of <b>etretinate</b> in certain acitretin recipients. In the present study, 10 patients with severe psoriasis were treated with 30 mg acitretin daily for 3 months. Seven patients had detectable mean steady- state plasma <b>etretinate</b> concentrations in the range of 2. 5 to 56. 7 ng/ml. Four of the patients showed teratogenic levels of plasma <b>etretinate.</b> Consumption of alcohol appeared to be an important contributing factor for the formation of <b>etretinate.</b> As judged from the dose- and body-weight-normalized AUC values (AUCcor) there was a great inter-individual variation (sixfold) in the systemic availability of acitretin. After discontinuation of therapy, the rate of elimination of both acitretin (t 1 / 2 range 1. 0 to 25. 4 d) and 13 -cis-acitretin (t 1 / 2 range 1. 5 to 25. 7 d) was found {{to be related to the}} observed mean steady-state level of <b>etretinate</b> as evidenced by a longer terminal t 1 / 2 of patients with high levels of <b>etretinate</b> in plasma. A mean terminal elimination half-life of <b>etretinate</b> was found to be 45. 7 d ± 10. 6 (mean ± SD; range 27. 0 to 59. 3 d). The risk of metabolic formation of <b>etretinate</b> in acitretin recipients makes it impossible to draw any definite conclusion with regard to recommendation of length of anticonceptive period following acitretin therapy in psoriatics. Monitoring of plasma <b>etretinate</b> levels in acitretin-treated fertile women is advisable...|$|E
40|$|<b>Etretinate</b> (Tigason) and {{ibuprofen}} {{have been}} compared in a double-blind controlled trial in psoriatic arthritis {{to see if}} we could confirm a specific action for this vitamin A derivative suggested from earlier uncontrolled studies.

Improvement of statistical significance was seen for articular index in both groups. In addition significant improvement in ESR, haemoglobin, C-reactive protein, and histidine occurred in the <b>etretinate</b> group. The main side effects of <b>etretinate</b> (which may preclude its use at a higher dose in this condition) included cracked and dried lips and sore mouth...|$|E
