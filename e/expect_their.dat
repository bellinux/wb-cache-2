He chose the unexpected course of forcing Gregory to grant him absolution by doing penance before him at Canossa, where he had taken refuge. The Walk to Canossa soon became legendary.|$|E
25|$|Tàijíquán's martial aspect {{relies on}} {{sensitivity}} to the opponent's movements and centre of gravity dictating appropriate responses. Effectively affecting the opponent's centre of gravity immediately upon contact, is trained as {{the primary goal of}} the martial t‘ai-chi ch‘üan student. The sensitivity needed to capture the centre is acquired over thousands of hours of first yin (slow, repetitive, meditative, low-impact) and then later adding yang (realistic, active, fast, high-impact) martial training through taolu (forms), tuishou (pushing hands), and sanshou (sparring). Tàijíquán trains in three basic ranges: close, medium and long, and then everything in between. Pushes and open-hand strikes are more common than punches, and kicks are usually to the legs and lower torso, never higher than the hip, depending on style. The fingers, fists, palms, sides of the hands, wrists, forearms, elbows, shoulders, back, hips, knees, and feet are commonly used to strike, with strikes to the eyes, throat, heart, groin, and other acupressure points trained by advanced students. Chin na, which are joint traps, locks, and breaks are also used. Most tàijíquán teachers <b>expect</b> <b>their</b> students to thoroughly learn defensive or neutralizing skills first, and a student will have to demonstrate proficiency with them before offensive skills will be extensively trained.|$|E

For Herschel Hardin, because of the remarkable hold of the siege mentality and the concern with survival, Canada in its essentials is [...] "a public enterprise country." [...] According to Hardin, the [...] "fundamental mode of Canadian life" [...] has always been, [...] "the un-American mechanism of redistribution as opposed to the mystic American mechanism of market rule."

UNICA disagreed with the assertion that indirect land-use changes can be accurately calculated with the current methodologies. Canadian officials also complained the standard could become an entry barrier to their Alberta oil sands, as producers will have to significantly reduce their emissions or purchase expensive credits from alternative energy producers in order for their non-conventional oil to be sold in California. They complained that the measure could be discriminating against Canadian oil sands crude as a high carbon intensity crude oil, while other heavy crude oils from other sources were not evaluated by CARB's studies.|$|E
2500|$|On October 18, 1996, Velasquez's seventh album, Retro, was released. The album {{featured}} cover {{versions of}} international hit singles in the 1970s and 1980s from {{artists such as}} The Carpenters, Donna Summer, Melissa Manchester, Andy Gibb and Olivia Newton-John among others. The album's first single, [...] "Fly", was released {{and is the only}} original song from the record. Maurice White, Al McKay, and Allee Willis, the members of the American disco-soul group Earth, Wind & Fire, are credited as songwriters because the song interpolates the melody of their 1978 song [...] "September". David Gonzales of AllMusic expressed approval of the album’s content having a [...] "considerable amount of adventurous, modern music, often performed in a rhythm & blues vein, a most welcome development {{in a country where the}} local music scene is dominated by easy listening love songs." [...] Though he pointed out the musical direction the album went with, steering away from the stereotypical genre: [...] "Filipinos will [...] listen to adventurous music by international artists, but <b>expect</b> <b>their</b> own singers to remain in an [...] "easy listening" [...] musical straitjacket. [...] the success of the album also points to one of the drawbacks on the Philippine music scene, oftentimes Filipinos prefer international music, and remakes thereof, than music composed by their countrymen." [...] Commercially, Retro has sold over 160,000 units in regional and domestic sales. That same year, Velasquez began working on the final album per her record contract with PolyCosmic. Love Was Born On Christmas Day was released in December 1996, along with the debut of its lead single of the same title. By the end of 1996, Velasquez has grown dissatisfied with the music and image her management label had created for her and felt that the company was treating her as a product instead of a person, having been marketed with the influence of Cantopop, J-pop and K-pop genre because of its financial trend. Along with her dissatisfaction on the creative direction of her music, Velasquez also resented being forbidden to openly state her ethnicity in order to maintain a favorable public image, as Filipinos have been indiscriminately identified as domestic workers in the region. As a result, Velasquez parted ways from PolyCosmic and signed a five-album recording contract with VIVA Records, resuming her music career in the Philippines.|$|E
