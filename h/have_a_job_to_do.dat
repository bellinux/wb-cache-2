They excel at {{many types of}} sporting competitions, such as agility, dock diving and obedience. Their keen sense of smell, intelligence, drive to work, and small size, make them perfect search and rescue dogs. The breed standard states that the dog should have a strong retrieving drive, intense birdiness, endurance and a love for water.|$|E

[...] Anti-pornography activist Phil Burress told the Associated Press that a race between Schmidt and McEwen would be tough. [...] "They are two totally different types of personalities. Bob is a statesman, and I love that. Jean will get in your face in a heartbeat, and I like that too," [...] said Burress. Also running were Deborah A. Kraus, who worked for the West Clermont school district's computer services department, and James E. Constable, who ran to protest the care his disabled son received from a state hospital.|$|E

50|$|They {{are very}} social hunting dogs that prefer an outdoor environment, and need {{plenty of space}} to run free and get lots of exercise.

By chance, I learned that the root of 'parenthesis' is a Greek word that means the act of inserting. And so I was given the title of the film." ...|$|E

5000|$|This breed's {{standard}} temperament is {{best described}} as a [...] "Gentleman by Nature".

50|$|Herding {{dogs are}} often chosen as family pets. The collie breeds {{including}} the Bearded Collie and Border Collie are well known, {{as are the}} Welsh Corgis. Although they make good family dogs and show dogs they are at their best when they <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> These dogs have been bred as working dogs {{and need to be}} active. They retain their herding instincts and may sometimes nip at people's heels or bump them in an effort to 'herd' their family, and may need to be trained not to do so. Their activity level and intelligence makes them excellent canine athletes. The Australian Shepherd, Shetland Sheepdog, Rough Collie, Smooth Collie and Old English Sheepdog are more popular as family companion dogs.|$|E

Shemp, Larry and Moe all take turns trying to move Tom, but a series of various shenanigans, such as a frog jumping down Shemp's shirt and an owl entering a skull and assuming the role of a death's head spirit, spooks the Stooges. As they run into another room to escape, Lady Godiva rides up on a horse and takes Tom away. The Stooges rush over to the window to watch them depart, only to be pelted with three successive pies amidst a cheering crowd.|$|E

Cordiality to opposing counsel usually {{makes it easier to}} try your case. Sometimes opposing counsel won't allow you to be cordial, but whenever you can you should try your case with an air of collegial professionalism. and a lesson {{that he would like to}} pass on to new trial lawyers: You <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> as a prosecutor, and sometimes the people and incidents you deal with aren't very pretty. But you should never lose sight of the fact that a prosecutor is a minister of justice, not a vigilante avenger.|$|E

Since workers {{of color and}} local college {{students}} were hired as strikebreakers, many workers feared they would not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> <b>to</b> return to {{and went back to}} the hotels, despite the poor working conditions. On June 11, 1912, the Bureau called a meeting between the Hotel Men's Association and the Hotel Workers' International Union to negotiate terms to end the strike, but the Hotel Men's Association ultimately refused to acknowledge them as a union.|$|R
