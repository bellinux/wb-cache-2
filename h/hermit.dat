5|$|After death, {{the empty}} shell of this sea snail {{is often used}} by <b>hermit</b> crabs. On {{the coast of the}} Caraguatatuba, Brazil, a study of shell use in the diogenid <b>hermit</b> crab species Isocheles sawayai was carried out. This study {{revealed}} that 11.5% of the population of these <b>hermit</b> crabs were using shells of Semicassis granulata. The occupation of shell type was reported as not being random, but was instead described as being influenced by the weight, size, shape and internal volume of the shell, the occurrence of epibionts such as bryozoans on the shell, and the degree of resistance the shell offered to predation and desiccation.|$|E
5|$|Brother Richard Scott Withers (born 1955) is an American consecrated <b>hermit.</b> In 1974, Withers {{converted}} to Catholicism and was baptized; shortly after, {{he started to}} live a religious life. In 1989, Withers and Sister Margaret McKenna moved to inner city Philadelphia and founded New Jerusalem Laura, a drug treatment center.

In 2001, Withers was consecrated as a <b>hermit</b> by Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua, the Archbishop of Philadelphia. He was the first <b>hermit</b> to be consecrated in the Archdiocese of Philadelphia. Withers lives in a hermitage, a converted rowhouse, {{in the city of}} Philadelphia where he {{spends most of his time}} in prayer.|$|E

5|$|Self-decoration is {{employed}} by animals in different groups, including decorator crabs, which attach materials from their environment, {{as well as}} living organisms, to camouflage themselves. For example, the Japanese <b>hermit</b> crab, Eupagurus constans, has the hydroid Hydractinia sodalis growing all over the shell that it lives in. Another <b>hermit</b> crab, Eupagurus cuanensis, has the aposematic orange sponge Suberites domuncula which is bitter-tasting and not eaten by fish.|$|E
5|$|Two of {{the more}} unusual {{relationships}} are those between certain anemones (such as Adamsia, Calliactis and Neoaiptasia) and <b>hermit</b> crabs or snails, and Bundeopsis or Triactis anemones and Lybia boxing crabs.

5|$|The Mad <b>Hermit</b> is a 1910 American silent short drama film {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The story focuses on Harry Willard, who becomes a <b>hermit</b> after {{his wife and daughter}} leave him. He spends {{a quarter of a century}} in isolation, but he stumbles across a runaway carriage and the woman tosses her baby to him. He runs into the wilderness and prepares to kill it, but he stays his hand when he sees the baby's locket. The parents survive the carriage crash and seek out the <b>hermit,</b> and it is revealed that the baby's mother is the daughter of Harry Willard. Created by a staff of twenty, it was the first film to be {{produced by}} the Thanhouser Company. The film was released in August 9, 1910, after the success of the company was ensured, and met with positive reception by critics. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|Two years later, in 1991, Withers {{bought a}} {{derelict}} rowhouse {{from the city}} of Philadelphia for $1 and parted ways with McKenna. This would become his hermitage. He fixed the building, which lacked doors, windows, or a working roof and then went on to build furniture for it by himself. After the 1983 revision of Canon 603, the option of being a consecrated <b>hermit</b> while independent of the system of religious orders had been permitted. In 1995, Withers attempted to be consecrated by the Archdiocese of Philadelphia but was rejected. In 2001, Withers was finally approved and consecrated as a <b>hermit</b> by Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua and took his public vows. Withers was the first <b>hermit</b> to be consecrated by the Archdiocese.|$|E

5|$|The {{coconut crab}} {{is the only}} species of the genus Birgus, and {{is related to the}} {{terrestrial}} <b>hermit</b> crabs of the genus Coenobita. It shows a number of adaptations to life on land. Like <b>hermit</b> crabs, juvenile coconut crabs use empty gastropod shells for protection, but the adults develop a tough exoskeleton on their abdomen and stop carrying a shell. Coconut crabs have organs known as branchiostegal lungs, which are used instead of the vestigial gills for breathing and they will drown if immersed in water for long. They have an acute sense of smell, which has developed convergently with that of insects, and which they use to find potential food sources.|$|E

Certain crabs and <b>hermit</b> crabs seek out sea anemones {{and place them}} on their shells for protection, and fish, shrimps and crabs live among the anemone's tentacles, gaining protection by being {{in close proximity to}} the stinging cells. Some amphipods live inside the coelenteron of the sea anemone. Despite their venomous cells, sea anemones are eaten by fish, starfish, worms, sea spiders and molluscs. The sea slug Aeolidia papillosa feeds on the aggregating anemone (Anthopleura elegantissima), accumulating the nematocysts for its own protection.|$|E
