B. S. Haldane, Ronald Fisher and Sewall Wright. However, {{at the time of}} Huxley's book several of these had yet to make their distinctive contribution. Certainly, for Huxley, E. B. Ford and his co-workers in ecological genetics were at least as important; and Cyril Darlington, the chromosome expert, was a notable source of facts and ideas.An analysis of the 'authorities cited' <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>Evolution</b> the modern synthesis shows indirectly those whom Huxley regarded as the most important contributors to the synthesis up to 1941 (the book was published in 1942, and references go up to 1941). The authorities cited 20 or more times are:Darlington, Darwin, Dobzhansky, Fisher, Ford, Goldschmidt, Haldane, J. S. Huxley, Muller, Rensch, Turrill, Wright.This list contains a few surprises. Goldschmidt was an influential geneticist who advocated evolution by saltation, and was sometimes mentioned in disagreement. Turrill provided Huxley with botanical information. The list omits three key members of the synthesis who are listed above: Mayr, Stebbins the botanist and Simpson the palaeontologist. Mayr gets 16 citations and more in the two later editions; all three published outstanding and relevant books some years later, and their contribution to the synthesis is unquestionable. Their lesser weight in Huxley's citations was caused by the early publication date of his book. Huxley's book is not strong in palaeontology, which illustrates perfectly why Simpson's later works were such an important contribution.|$|E
40|$|The MFSTEP 1 {{project is}} an {{international}} scientific collaboration program which aims to create an operational forecasting system for the Mediterranean sea. The simulations provided at the basin scale are 10 days forecasting fields in a 3 -D ocean. The hydrodynamic model primitive equations are combined with the data assimilation scheme SOFA 2. The data collection is done in a near real time process and the set of XBT and SLA observations are used in one week assimilation cycle. The forecast assessment is traditionally realised using classical statistic tools like RMSE or the bias and the assimilation benefit is estimated by skill scores using as reference the free model, persistence or also climatology. The process is essentially based on the comparison of two fields at a fixed time, one corresponding to the simulations {{and the other one}} to the observations. The interest of such statistical methods comes in the quick and sensitive appreciation they provide about the quality, accuracy and consistency of the simulation. However this kind of assessment procedure brings in it self a conceptual contradiction: performances of a dynamical process are measured using a snap shot view of the ocean state. A system evolution assessment procedure is carried out {{within the framework of the}} MFSTEP hindcast. The hindcast system is intrinsically analysed (without independent informations) comparing the background forecast evolution with the abrupt variation which occurs at the observations assimilation time steps. The system evolution between two consecutive days is analysed using a decomposition method. The temperature and salinity fields evolution in a sub-region of theWestern Mediterranean basin is seen in a structural point of view and decomposed in three elements : a global spatial(2 D) displacement which conserves the internal features, a global intensity variation which expresses the system energy changes, and an internal pattern changes ensemble. The <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>evolution</b> used is a mean squared difference between the two consecutive simulations. The displacement contribution is estimated after the determination of the shift (field translation) which minimises the local mean squared difference between the translated field and the next simulation. The intensity variation contribution is calculated as the difference of the squared mean fields. The remaining difference after manipulations is considered as the internal pattern changes contribution to the system evolution...|$|E

The ratio of IFF to PK changed from 27 to 4 during the first passage and remained 4 after a second passage. PK were plaques. Plaque assay was linear {{in the presence of}} IFF. To investigate the mechanism of PK formation, radioautography was done on cells pulse-labeled with tritiated thymidine before virus multiplication began. The results showed that PK were formed by fusion; there were no PK whose nuclei contained no label, and the proportion of labeled nuclei (32 %) and distribution of grain counts was the same in PK as in uninvolved cells, ruling out nuclear replication without concomitant cytoplasmic membrane formation as the mechanism of formation of these PK.

The GDP growth has {{a negative impact on}} inflation rate in Romania, an increase in logarithm of GDP with one percentage point determining a decrease in inflation logarithm with less than 0. 1 units according to both proposed models.

In {{the first part of}} the study we approach the offer of accommodation in camps for children under and of school age based on the indices: the number of camps, the existing accommodation capacity and the accommodation capacity in operation. All the indices indicate a strong decrease of the offer of accommodation accentuated in the last part of the analyzed period. The <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> the demand of accommodation is valuated from the point of view of the number of tourists arrived and accommodated in camps for children under and of school age, of the number of overnight stays, of the average duration of the stay, of the number of school population and of the average salary output. The <b>evolution</b> trend <b>of</b> the demand shows significant decreases, yet not outrunning the decrease rhythm of the demand. This is why the net utilization <b>index</b> <b>of</b> the accommodation capacity shows some growing values. In the last part of the study we analyze a possible dependence between the demand of accommodation expressed in the number of arrivals in the camps for children under and of school age and two quantitative factors: the number of school population and the average salary output. The results indicate the existence of a dependence relation between the number of arrivals and the number of school population, the salary output not representing a relevant factor of influence. The conclusions of the analysis show the need to carry out some ample and constant activities of promoting this tourism company among the school and pre-school population as well as their families, taking into account the educative and training role that the activities organized in the camps of children under and of school age can and must have on the young generation’s training and education. correlation, regression, price index, accommodation capacity, net utilization <b>index</b> <b>of</b> the accommodation capacity. ...|$|R

This may have been observed {{not only in the}} gamma-ray {{spectrum of}} young supernova remnants (SNRs) such as RX J 1713. 7 - 3946, but also in the spectrum of CRs showering on the Earth. The escape-limited model of cosmic-ray acceleration is studied in general. We discuss the spectrum of CRs running away from the acceleration site. The model may also constrain the spectral index at the acceleration site and the ansatz with respect to the unknown injection process into the particle acceleration. We apply our model to CR acceleration in SNRs and in active galactic nuclei (AGN), which are plausible candidates of Galactic and extragalactic CRs, respectively. In particular, for young SNRs, we take account <b>of</b> the shock <b>evolution</b> with cooling <b>of</b> escaping CRs in the Sedov phase. The spectrum of escaping CRs generally depends on the physical quantities at the acceleration site, such as the spectral <b>index,</b> the <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> the maximum energy of CRs and the <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> the number of CRs.

40|$|We derive theorems which outline {{explicit}} {{mechanisms by}} which anomalous scaling for the probability density function of the sum of many correlated random variables asymptotically prevails. The results characterize general anomalous scaling forms, explain their universal character, and specify universality domains in the spaces of joint probability density functions of the summand variables. These density functions {{are assumed to be}} invariant under arbitrary permutations of their arguments. Examples from the theory of critical phenomena are discussed. The novel notion of stability implied by the limit theorems also allows us to de. ne sequences of random variables whose sum satisfies anomalous scaling for any finite number of summands. If regarded as developing in time, the stochastic processes described by these variables are non-Markovian generalizations of Gaussian processes with uncorrelated increments, and provide, e. g., explicit realizations of a recently proposed model <b>of</b> <b>index</b> <b>evolution</b> in finance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{investigates the}} <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> {{regional}} socio-economic disparity in China {{during the period}} 1998 - 2010. A new composite <b>index</b> <b>of</b> development (CIRD) is developed to capture the five main dimensions of regional development: macroeconomic conditions, science and innovation performance, environmental sustainability, human capital accumulation, and public facilities provision. The investigation benchmarks 30 (out of 31) Chinese regions according to such multidimensional <b>index</b> <b>of</b> development and thus improves the understanding <b>of</b> the <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> regional disparity in China {{in terms of the}} various dimensions of socio-economic development. Finally, on the basis of stochastic kernel density estimation, the paper reveals the existence of a triple-clubs pattern of convergence in the period under scrutiny, thereby informing both the literature on regional convergence and the current strategy of balancing the uneven process of growth in China. Key words: regional disparity, multidimensional <b>index</b> <b>of</b> development, stochastic kernel, distribution dynamics...|$|R
