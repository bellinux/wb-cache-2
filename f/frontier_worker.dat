40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis examines {{the experiences of}} <b>frontier</b> <b>workers</b> in Luxembourg and the issues and implications of frontier working in Luxembourg, viewed from a Talent Management perspective. Adopting an interview research strategy, the study involved key informants from the three bordering countries, Germany, France and Belgium. Although Talent Management, as a theme in business and management, has recently received growing attention, academic activities dealing with {{the experiences of the}} participating stakeholders do not reflect its importance. To date, there is scarce evidence or research on frontier working, and what little data that exist is mainly numerical. This study aims to address this gap. The research topic appears in the frameworks of International Human Resources Management and Global Talent Management, and is based on an underlying practical issue originating from the necessity of employing talented <b>frontier</b> <b>workers</b> to fill the gap in talent supply in Luxembourg. Looking at Talent Management as an HR practice, a qualitative, inductive research approach was adopted, using semi-structured, face-to-face interviews with two groups of key informants, <b>frontier</b> <b>workers</b> and HR managers. The interviews were conducted in the participan mother tongue either German, French or Luxembourgish hence exploring Talent Management in languages other than English, which, up until now, has been dominant in research. Furthermore, the study offers a novel approach to the so far US- and UK-focused research, as it explores Talent Management in Luxembourg, where almost fifty percent of the workforce iscomposed of <b>frontier</b> <b>workers.</b> In order to answer the research question, the data collected were analysed through thematic analysis to identify significant patterns and themes in each of the 35 interviews. In response to the research question, the findings reveal that frontier working in Luxembourg can be categorized as a dominant and relevant phenomenon. It can be concluded that frontier working does {{have a significant impact on}} the Talent Management practices as applied by organizations. Overall, this research provides insights into the increasing importance of frontier working and develops an understanding of the issues in order to inform practice. The study therefore helps to close the gap in the research about the phenomenon of frontier working and its implications for HR practice in relation to Talent Management. This work responds to Collings and Mellahi´s (2009) call for more empirical research on the experiences of talented employees and suggests that TM in Luxembourg is an as yet under-researched topic. The conclusions of this study inform empirical research, theory about frontier working and related concepts. Hence it contributes to a better understanding of frontier working as a thus-far under-explored phenomenon. This study has implications for business and management, as it is relevant for practitioners as well as academic research in International Human Resource Management and Global Talent Management. The study concludes with implications for both existing or future <b>frontier</b> <b>workers</b> and HR departments in organizations in Luxembourg that employ <b>frontier</b> <b>workers</b> and outlines the conclusions for future research...|$|R

Total visitor spending in Gibraltar in 2007 was £230.6m of which £176m was by visitors across the land frontier. Of this £176m land frontier visitor expenditure, some £112.4m was attributable to Campo de Gibraltar residents and a further £21.27m is assumed to be displacement from the Spanish economy, leaving a total net direct output effect of £168m from recurrent spending (£302m-£134m).* In 2007 the £302m direct output effect of the Gibraltar economy on the Campo de Gibraltar economy was responsible for a direct increase in gross domestic product (GDP) within the Campo de Gibraltar region of £195m.* Using the Andalusia Regional Input-Output model to estimate the secondary effects of the two economies' interaction, the Gibraltar economy was responsible for a further increase in GDP in the Campo de Gibraltar region of £125m, resulting in a total increase in GDP of just over £420m.* The Gibraltar economy was responsible for approximately 12.2% of the total GDP in the Campo de Gibraltar in 2007.* In terms of a further wealth effect created by the Gibraltar economy, the evidence would seem to suggest that property values within the Campo de Gibraltar region have increased by up to 40% because of the proximity to Gibraltar. With just over 86,000 households in the region and using a conservative property value (at 2007 prices) this could account for an increase in Campo de Gibraltar asset values of somewhere between £1.4 to £5.4 billion. The reason for such large variation is explained partly through the lack of data that are available without undertaking a detailed survey and partly because of the volatility experienced by the Spanish housing market over the past year, where property prices, particularly in some areas, have fallen dramatically. In part this fall in property prices is explained by the general economic downturn being experienced by the global economy and in part by the effect of the falling pound sterling with respect to the value of the euro which will have put further downward pressure on property prices in the region.* Gibraltar also imported approximately 1.5m tonnes of petroleum products from the Campo de Gibraltar region for bunkering during 2007 and the value of this has not been included in the analyses. If the value of this fuel is included as an import from the Campo de Gibraltar it adds almost another £300m to the impact of Gibraltar on the region, Meyrick and Associates of fuel bunker prices for this period and a GBP to USD.|$|R

40|$|The cases {{annotated}} here seek {{to clarify}} the law {{in relation to the}} family rights of own citizens when returning to the Member State of origin (circular migration); or when exercising the rights to free movement in another Member State whilst residing in the Member State of nationality (frontier migration). This is a complex area of the law in a political minefield: the Court has, broadly speaking, been generous with the rights of family members; it is sufficient here to recall the case law on the derived right of residence of parents of migrant children in education. Yet, the cases annotated here are difficult because they are at the very boundary between national and European law: indeed it is this boundary that the Court was asked to clarify. In this respect, it is clear that Member States wish to retain regulatory prerogatives in relation to the rights of family reunification of own citizens: {{it is no coincidence that}} Article 3 (1) Directive 2004 / 38 provides that the Directive can only be invoked against a State different from that of nationality. However, if the political will is clear, the legal situation is more complex since, pre-Directive 2004 / 38, the Court had already declared that Union citizens could invoke the Treaty against their State of nationality when they establish a cross-border element; and that the refusal to grant family reunification rights could be construed as a barrier to movement. 5 Here, therefore, the Grand Chamber had to elaborate on the extent to which the primary Treaty provisions grant rights to returning nationals and to <b>frontier</b> <b>workers,</b> that is to say it had to elaborate on the conditions necessary to invoke the Singh and the Carpenter doctrines respectively. Both the Singh and the Carpenter doctrines have proven to be very contentious with the Member States; in particular, some governments do not welcome further incursions in their migration policies. Furthermore, following the introduction of Union citizenship it has become easier to satisfy some cross-border requirement: what then if Union citizens tried to rely on those doctrines too easily, without having established proper economic/cross-border credentials? The national family reunification regimes would be directly undermined, and indirectly harmonized, through the “clever” exploitation of EU law. This is the problem that the Court seemingly attempted to solve in the rulings in questions. And yet, the carefully tailored solutions seem to fit no one – far from clarifying the scope of application of the Carpenter and Singh doctrines, and the reasons underlying them, it creates a system which is both confused and legally irrational...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} member states' policy {{effectiveness}} in the European Union, using Luxembourg's capacity {{to get what}} it wanted in three crucial areas as a case study. Policy effectiveness {{is defined as the}} successful exercise of a member state's ability to include most of its policy preferences into the final legislation. The factors considered to influence policy effectiveness include the negotiation context, more specifically the decision-making procedure and time pressure. The distribution and intensity of other member states and holding the Presidency are also expected to play a role. Furthermore, individual-level factors such as experience, past relations or belonging to the same political family are rarely systematically included in research, but these are also included. Finally domestic politics, such as the approval procedure and institutional coordination are considered. The decision making process, especially within the Council, is still a black box to most scholars - a challenge which in this research is met by elite interviews with the negotiators involved, by process tracing and by document analysis. I empirically assess three cases where Luxembourg is reputed to have been policy effective: the creation of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) in 1996, the reform of the same in 2005, and the payment of unemployment benefits to <b>frontier</b> <b>workers</b> (EC Regulation 883 / 2004). In terms of Luxembourg's policy effectiveness, I find the following: 1) that Luxembourg was highly policy effective {{in the creation of the}} SGP, due to Jean- Claude Juncker's double hat of Finance Minister and Prime Minister, as well as his expertise and his personal relations with other Heads of State. 2) In the reform of the SGP, that Luxembourg was not policy effective despite holding the Presidency; Juncker was President of the Eurogroup and still had that same double hat. The widely distributed and intense preferences of France and Germany combined to produce an agreement which Luxembourg did not favour, but had nevertheless helped to produce. 3) Finally, that, in Regulation 883 / 2004, Luxembourg was medium policy effective because of domestic constraints, a low distribution and intensity of preferences of the other member states and because of unanimity. All of my case studies show evidence of two developments in terms of decision-making processes: the shift of decision-making from public to informal arenas, and the involvement of the European Council in areas which are not formally within its competence. Indeed, the compromises found were proposed in the Council of Ministers after several key member states had seen and agreed to them beforehand. Incidentally, the evidence also indicates that the European Parliament did not influence the legislative outcome at all in these cases. These results suggest several practical guidelines for member states...|$|R

Assuming that primary as well as secondary education is more suitable for imitation and higher education is more appropriate for innovation, this paper empirically investigates whether the contribution of human capital to productivity growth depends on the composition of human capital and the proximity to technology frontier in a panel of 87 sample countries over the period of 1970 to 2004. The sample is further divided into 28 high, 37 medium, and 22 low income countries to gain some insights into the importance of composition effects of human capital on growth in developing countries relative to their developed counterparts.

Nonetheless, our understanding on PhD training has been insufficient due to limited access to the inside of academic labs. Furthermore, early careers of PhD graduates are often difficult to follow, which makes the evaluation of training outcome challenging. To fill in these limitations, this study aims to illustrate the settings of PhD {{training in}} academic labs and examine their impact on several aspects of training outcome, drawing on "Japan Doctoral Human Resource Profiling", a national survey of a cohort of 5000 PhD graduates from Japanese universities. Our regression analyses controlling for several variables indicate the following results: (1) PhD students who received frequent instruction by their official supervisors are likely to successfully earn degrees and engage in jobs related to their dissertation subjects; (2) frequent supervision by internal faculty members is associated with high performance both in academia (based on publications) and in industry (based on wage rates); (3) frequent supervision by external faculty members is associated with successful degree attainment and academic career choice; and (4) frequent supervision by non-faculty members (e. g., postdocs and senior students) is associated with non-academic career choice. The expansion of postgraduate education since 1991 has increased the number of students per supervisor, which has added to the workload of faculty members, along with other duties such as administration and fundraising. The result indicates that frequent supervision by multiple faculty members improves career outcomes and students' satisfaction, suggesting the need for secondary instructors as well as expert staff supporting faculty members...|$|R

40|$|The {{success of}} {{domestic}} worker organizing {{in the twenty-first}} century may seem like an anomaly against the backdrop of increased hostility towards unionized labor and an overall decline in wages and benefits for workers. The contemporary domestic worker movement, beginning in the 1990 s, builds upon centuries of organizing and agitation by domestic workers and others for a cultural shift that values domestic labor as real work. The current movement fundamentally alters past organizing models, linking the struggle to a broader movement for social justice. Unlike past organizing efforts, domestic workers are {{at the helm of the}} contemporary movement. They have made significant strides, through their leadership and visibility, moving the cultural paradigm and building a broad-based alliance with labor, social justice activists, faith-based organizations, women’s groups, and students.

40|$|This thesis empirically {{examines}} {{the roles of}} innovation and human capital in improving economic growth for {{a large number of}} developed and developing countries. It contains three essays. The first essay investigates the effects of R&D intensity and technology transfer on total factor productivity growth. It also examines whether productivity growth depends on human capital and its interaction with distance to the technological frontier. Using several indicators of innovative activity and product variety, the results suggest that R&D intensity has a significant direct and positive effect on productivity growth only in high income OECD countries, whereas the same effect for R&D-based absorptive capacity is only found in developing countries. Moreover, human capital-based absorptive capacity is found to be weakly significant in developing countries. Autonomous technology transfer is found to have a significant effect in stimulating productivity growth in both groups of countries. The second essay studies whether the contribution of human capital to productivity growth depends on its composition and proximity to the technology frontier. Using different levels of human capital data from several sources, the results indicate that the growth-enhancing effects of skilled human capital increase with proximity to the technology frontier only in high and medium income countries. Unskilled human capital contributes more to growth in low income countries, as they move closer to the technology <b>frontier.</b> Female <b>workers</b> with secondary education generate more productivity growth than male workers in low income countries, whereas male workers with tertiary education contribute more to productivity growth than female workers in high and medium income countries. Mature workers with tertiary education are more growth-enhancing for high and medium income countries, whereas younger workers with secondary education are more growth improving for low income countries. The third and final essay {{examines the}} joint effects of both {{the quantity and quality of}} human capital in improving productivity growth. Using different measures of human capital quantity and quality, the results suggest that the growth effects of educational attainment can be significantly enhanced when the quality of schooling is improved.

The contribution of the quality-adjusted human capital is found to be stronger in developing countries.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In day to days {{competitive}} and dynamic business environment. The {{complexity of the}} technology is increasing in the applications in the industries. A new system is required to maintain the competitive advantage of the industries. Increasingly successful business leaders recognize that the integration of management and organization and facilities {{is the key to}} inspiring organizational performance and value creation. Three of the primary resources namely people, place and tools are to integrate as a coherent whole and aligned to support a robust strategy. The new <b>frontier</b> of Knowledge <b>Worker</b> effectiveness lies in integrating the design and implementation of these three keys. The Industries have begun to integrate their operations along the value chain of the products they design, produce or sustain. The creation of the value is one of the important tasks in Integration. The object of meeting the technical performance and the costs and scheduled goals effectively and efficiently is a serious challenge. Hence, the process of integration to the enterprises can achieve the target. The nature of enterprises provides a solution for obtaining these challenges. Enterprise Integration is the process of linking these applications and creating a linkage between the different sources is an important aspect. Information is the consideration as the most important factor for implementation of integration in the enterprise. The second step takes place in close interaction between the customer and the supplier. The customer is to integrate into the value creation of the supplier. Value is the mutual creation among the factors on different levels. Customer integration is to define as a form of industrial value creation where the consumers take part in activities and processes, which is the domain of the companies. The current practice of Enterprise Architecting has been a significant contribution to creating and sustaining modern enterprises. However, the current field is not a sufficient approach to the enterprises of this new century. A broader and more holistic approach is to achieve by drawing on the emerging systems and the architecting field. The objective {{of this paper is to}} set a framework for value generation in the enterprise based on a strong integration of the customer.

40|$|The free {{movement}} of workers enshrined in Article 45 TFEU {{is one of the}} fundamental principles of the European Union. Although Article 45 TFEU contains clear references to specific rights for workers, which have been implemented in several pieces of secondary legislation (e. g. Directive 2004 / 38, Regulation (EU) No 492 / 2011 as well as Regulations (EC) No 883 / 2004 and (EC) No 987 / 2009), the key concepts regarding the scope of application of the {{free movement}} of workers derive from case law. Article 45 TFEU applies to migrant workers, i. e. persons performing services for and under the direction of another person in return for which they receive remuneration, provided their activity is not marginal and ancillary. This includes full-time workers, part-time workers (no matter how many hours worked), seasonal <b>workers,</b> <b>frontier</b> <b>workers,</b> working students and jobseekers. Article 45 TFEU does not apply to non-remunerated work including voluntary work and care work within the family unit. It is open to debate whether it should apply to internships and other forms of non-remunerated work which are aimed at facilitating access to the paid labour market. Migration exists whenever the worker has moved between EU Member States: this includes migration to another Member State to work there; returning to the home State after having worked abroad; and living in one Member State and working in a different one. Article 45 TFEU can be invoked also by employers to challenge restrictions on the possibility to hire workers. The family of the worker is also protected by both primary and secondary provisions of EU law. In order to be protected by the Treaty {{free movement of}} workers provisions a claimant must fall within the personal scope of the Treaty, i. e. he or she must fall within the definition of worker. Even though the concept of worker has been interpreted broadly, there are some grey areas, in particular in relation to employment which pursues an ulterior aim, such as social reintegration schemes. For the claimant, being classified as a worker is of paramount importance since the status carries a wealth of rights (non-discrimination, access to benefits, unconditional right to reside in the host State). Work also needs to be remunerated, but the concept of remuneration is flexible so that a quid pro quo (such as board and lodging) might count as remuneration. However, certain work (internships, apprenticeships etc) is often of economic value for the employer, and of value to the person performing it; and yet, the fact that such activity attracts no remuneration might leave a vulnerable section of workers devoid of protection in European law. Next to that, Member States may police the definition of worker rather rigidly, so that those who work are in fact treated as economically inactive, and so subject to indirectly discriminatory rules that would not be justified if applied to workers. The Commission should be ready to challenge any restrictive practices in defining migrant work, which may result in significant detriment to part-time workers. The same should be said in relation to atypical work contracts, such as zero-hours contracts, and there are also problems with the status of compulsory work placements in order to receive benefits. Therefore, given the changed landscape of the labour market, in order to determine whether there is an employment relationship the focus should be on whether the worker is able to refuse work offered (useful guidelines could be provided by national laws on the application of minimum terms and wages and similar), rather than on the remuneration. The Commission should also be alive to measures that discriminate against migrant workers once they have become unemployed, challenging restrictive approaches to the retention of worker status which can result in sudden loss of social protection, and arguing that such restrictions defy the broad approach to be taken to defining workers under Article 45 TFEU. Where possible, it would be advisable to characterise migrants as workers in order to trigger the strongest obligations with regard to both indirect discrimination and obstacles to movement. Measures that appear to be directed at the economically inactive can have significant effects upon migrant workers, increasing the disadvantages of becoming unemployed, even though many migrant workers move between jobs, and so making their work more precarious. The use of Article 45 TFEU in the context of access to the labour market, and an empirically evidenced, broad approach to benefits necessary to subsist, and so make access to the labour market possible, could help to avoid {{a situation in which the}} biggest obstacles to the free movement of workers are obstacles that prevent migrants from becoming migrant workers in the first place, or from regaining worker status having become unemployed. This could be combined with contesting indirect discrimination, wherever the measures in question can be framed as restricting access to benefits that facilitate access to the labour market. Measures that make it more difficult for own state nationals to seek work having worked elsewhere in the EU should be identified and challenged. Finally, the Commission has a role to play, both through case work, and through awareness-raising activities, in stressing to national legislatures and judiciaries the importance of the prohibition of obstacles to movement. This is especially important in the light of the new Enforcement Directive; Member States need to appreciate and implement the principles contained therein if they are to effectively enforce them. Article 45 TFEU prevents national rules that discriminate directly on grounds of nationality, e. g. only Italians can work for the Ministry of Defence. These rules can be justified by relying on the Treaty derogations. It is also directed towards measures that discriminate indirectly on grounds of nationality, e. g. in order to be employed in a school the worker needs to be fluent in Italian. These rules can be justified on imperative grounds of public interest provided they are necessary and proportionate. Finally, Article 45 precludes obstacles/barriers/restrictions to the worker’s ability or desirability to move or access the market, e. g. a worker returning to Italy after having worked abroad will not be eligible for certain benefits; or a worker cannot be employed by more than one employer, or in more than one Member State. These rules can also be justified on imperative grounds of public interest as above. Although there are numerous studies and doctrinal contributions on the development from a discrimination approach toward an obstacle approach and all the consequences this has, it should be stressed that most free movement of persons cases could be treated using a discrimination approach, albeit ‘discrimination based on migration’ rather than pure nationality discrimination. The language of obstacles is in itself perhaps a bit misleading, since the cases predominantly deal with obstacles to movement rather than mere obstacles to market access experienced after movement. The construct of discrimination on grounds of movement might also help with making ‘obstacle’ arguments more accessible in national courts, by framing them as a familiar, hard legal concept (discrimination), and accepting inherent limits hinted at by the Bosman case law, that only measures penalising the exercise of free movement rights be caught. Discrimination on grounds of migration has the advantage of creating clearer boundaries (therefore making it easier to apply law) to the free movement of persons, whilst at the same time being less intrusive to national regulatory autonomy. The classification as ‘discrimination’ or ‘obstacles/restrictions/barriers’ in the case law should not be considered excessively rigid. What really matters is whether the rule has an effect on intra-Union migration. If such an effect is found through either discrimination or a barrier to movement or an obstacle, then the rule will have to be justified. In order to claim indirect discrimination it is sufficient that the rule might affect more foreigners or migrants than nationals and no particular evidence is required. In order to claim an obstacle it is sufficient to show that the rule might deter or discourage the free movement of workers, or that it might constitute a barrier to market access. Again no particular evidence is required. For this reason, it is advisable to claim both discrimination and obstacle in litigation. There are nonetheless some manifest differences between the discrimination and the obstacle approach. If a finding of discrimination can be supported by statistical data, then it will be very difficult for the Member State to defend such discrimination. A finding of discrimination is then again politically less problematic. This is so because if the CJEU finds discrimination the Member State might amend the rules simply to remove that discrimination, whilst if the CJEU finds that the rule is an unjustified obstacle to free movement the Member State will have to remove the rule for all economic operators. This might be very important should governments seek to introduce new restrictions on, for instance, the possibility to claim benefits or social advantages. Once discrimination is established the Graf doctrine (effect of rule too remote and indirect) cannot be invoked: no matter how minimal the discrimination is, it always needs to be justified. On the other hand, the Member State might attempt to reverse a claim of discrimination with statistical data (albeit this would not be conclusive). There are also inherent limits to the definition of ‘obstacle’, as a rule is not to be considered an obstacle if it is inherent in the organisation of the employment concerned or if the effect of the rule is too uncertain and indirect to be qualified as a barrier to movement. Finally, it can be observed that the justification of indirect discrimination and obstacles runs along similar lines. In several cases the CJEU does not carry out a separate assessment of necessity and proportionality, so that it would simply look at whether the measure is ‘appropriate’ and necessary to achieve the purported aim. In more recent times, the scrutiny as to the necessity of measures has also focused on issues such as the coherence of the rule within the legal system. Case law suggests that where both are established, indirect discrimination may be more readily justified by a Member State than obstacles to movement, where the former typically affect non-nationals and the latter own nationals. The more traditional proportionality assessment, on the other hand, focuses very much on whether the restriction on the person’s freedom is out of proportion with the policy aim pursued. ‘Proportionality proper’ is a very useful tool in the armoury of private claimants, especially in those cases where the rule itself might be legitimate but the application of the rule to that particular claimant is disproportionate because of the hardship it would cause. ‘Proportionality proper’ is less useful in relation to the abstract review of legislation (as it is carried out in Commission proceedings) where rules can only be declared either compatible or incompatible with Union law without there been any possibility for an individual assessment. In those cases, the analysis would focus on whether the measure is appropriate and necessary as detailed above...|$|R
