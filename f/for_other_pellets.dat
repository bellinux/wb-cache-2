40|$|Several {{models have}} been {{developed}} simulating O 2 transfer in bioreactors, but three limitations are often found: (i) an inadequate kinetic representation of O 2 consumption or wrong boundary conditions, (ii) unrealistic parameter values, and (iii) inadequate experimental systems. In our study we minimized those possible sources of error.

40|$|The commercially available, {{pelleted}} moose food {{sold under}} the same brand name (“Mazuri Moose Maintenance”) in North Amercia and Europe differs drastically in ingredient composition; the European formula does not contain the aspen sawdust that is regarded the crucial ingredient in the North American diet.

These pelleted feeds, and for comparison grass and browse samples, were submitted {{to a variety of}} analyses in order to isolate the potentially beneficial factors of the commercial moose feeds. All pelleted feeds had comparable particle size distributions, with the North American moose feed as the notable exception, as the sawdust particles were not as finely ground as the <b>other</b> ingredients. All <b>pelleted</b> feeds were similar in nutrient composition; however, the commercial moose feeds had higher percentages of fiber, due to a higher cellulose (and in the European pellets also hemicellulose) content. The commercial moose pellets did not display significantly higher amounts of lignin than the <b>other</b> <b>pelleted</b> feeds, in spite of the sawdust ingredient. Due to their high cellulose content, they even had lower lignin:cellulose-ratios than the other feeds and therefore rather resembled grass than browse in their fiber composition. Thus, the reported success of the commercial moose diets is most likely explained by their comparatively low energy density and high fiber content, and not by the sawdust ingredient itself. Additionally, the fact that they do not contain corn starch is considered beneficial. The nutritional contribution to husbandry problems in captive moose is considered to be generally due to the widespread use of pelleted feeds high in energy density and poor in structural fiber components...|$|R

This mimics the calcification of bone matrix since the polymer surface induces the deposit of large hydroxyapatite calcospherites. We investigated the effect of Sr 2 + on hydroxyapatite crystals developed on PHEMA pellets. Pellets were incubated for 1 week in a synthetic body fluid (SBF) to induce mineralization, then 2 weeks in SBF containing 0, 130, 260 or 390 µM of Sr 2 + allowing growth and maturation of calcospherites. Calcospherites were dissolved in HCl and Ca 2 +, PO 43 - and Sr 2 + content was measured. Sr 2 + release was assessed by transferring <b>other</b> <b>pellets</b> in saline which was collected at regular intervals to measure Sr 2 + release. Hydroxyapatite was characterized by SEM, X-ray diffraction, FTIR and Raman microspectroscopy.

40|$|The ﬁring and co-ﬁring {{of biomass}} in {{pulverized}} coal ﬁred power plants {{around the world}} is expected to increase in the coming years. Torrefaction may prove to be a suitable way of upgrading biomass for such an application. For transport and storage purposes, the torreﬁed biomass will tend to be in pellet form. Whilst standard methods for the assessment of the milling characteristics of coal exist, {{this is not the case}} for torreﬁed materials—whether in pellet form or not. The grindability of the fuel directly impacts the overall efﬁciency of the combustion process and as such it is an important parameter. In the present study, the grindability of different torreﬁed biomass pellets was tested in three different laboratory mill types; cutting mill (CM), hammer mill (HM) and impact mill (IM). The speciﬁc grinding energy (SGE) required for a deﬁned mass throughput of pellets in each mill was measured and results were compared to <b>other</b> <b>pellet</b> characterization methods (e. g., durability, and hardness) as well as the modiﬁed Hardgrove Index.

We searched the influence of Al deposition in hydroxyapatite developed on a biomimetic polymer (carboxymethylated poly(2 -hydroxyethyl-methacrylate)) which mimics bone mineralization in the absence of cells. PROCEDURES: Pellets of polymer were incubated for 5 days in a synthetic body fluid (SBF) to induce mineralization, then 21 days in SBF containing 20, 40 and 60 μg/L Al(3 +). <b>Other</b> <b>pellets</b> were incubated in SBF containing commercial Al foil (33 mg/vial) either in 1, 2 or 6 pieces. The mineral deposits were dissolved in HCl and Ca(2 +), PO(4) (3 -) and Al(3 +) content was measured. Hydroxyapatite was characterized by SEM and X energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX). RESULTS: The amount of Al(3 +) was dose-dependently increased in Ca/P deposits on the polymer pellets. At high concentration (or with the 6 Al foils) growth of hydroxyapatite calcospherite was inhibited; only calcified plates emerging from the polymer were observed. Pellets incubated with 1 and 2 Al foils exhibited a reduction in calcospherite diameter and an increase in the Al(3 +) /Ca(2 +) ratio. EDX identified Al in the mineral deposits. CONCLUSIONS: In this acellular model, Al(3 +) altered the growth of calcospherites at low concentration and inhibited their development at high concentration. In SBF, a release of Al(3 +) from aluminum foils also inhibited mineralization. This study emphasizes the importance of Al in bone pathology and stresses the question of its release from biomaterials...|$|R

Material and Methods: Human bone marrow cells obtained from volunteerpatients were plated in 75 -cm 2 flasks and their MSCs were expandedthrough several sub-cultures. The passage 4 cells were used to establishmicromass culture system for chondrogenic differentiation. For this purpose, 200, 000 fibroblastic cells were placed in centrifuge tubes and pelleted at 250 g for 5 minutes. About 0. 5 ml chondrogenic induction medium was thenadded to the pellet and the culture incubated in 5 % CO 2 at 37 °C for 21 days. Then, some pellets were utilized to evaluate chondrogenic differentiation byeither RT-PCR analysis of some cartilage marker molecules or specificstaining for detecting cartilage matrix, and <b>other</b> <b>pellets</b> were used <b>for</b> lightand electron microscopic study of differentiated tissue. Results: Primary culture of the bone marrow cells were initially composed ofthe spindle- and round shaped cells, from which the spindle cells remainedand expanded through several passages. At the end of differentiation period,RT-PCR analysis showed high production of collagen II and X and aggrecanmRNA inside the differentiated cells, and toluidine blue staining indicatedintermediate accumulation of the metachromatic matrix among the inducedcells. In general, light micrograph indicated a rather cellular state of thedifferentiated tissue in which the peripheral part had more metachromaticmatrix than central zone. More detailed study of the sections revealed thatinduced aggregates of the cells were composed externally of very thin layerof elongated cells reminiscent of perichondrium and internally a mass of ovalcells comprising the main part of the pellet. Ultra-thin sections showed thatthe cells in perichondrium-like layer were very similar to fibroblastic cells andthose located centrally had a set of well-developed organelles, characteristicof highly active cells.
