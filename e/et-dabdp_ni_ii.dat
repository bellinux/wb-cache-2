40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the study}} was to prepare {{potentially}} cheaper carbon for the adsorptive removal of Nickle [Ni (II) ] from aqueous solution. The adsorption capacity of the prepared carbon to remove <b>Ni</b> (<b>II)</b> from aqueous solution was determined and adsorption mechanism was investigated. Rice husk carbon was prepared by incineration in a muffle furnace. The incinerated rice husk carbon (IRHC) was characterised in terms of surface area, micropore area, micropore volume, average pore diameter and surface morphology. Adsorption of <b>Ni</b> (<b>II)</b> by IRHC was examined. The influence of operating parameters, namely, pH, initial concentration and contact time on adsorption of <b>Ni</b> (<b>II)</b> by IRHC was evaluated. Batch adsorption tests showed that extent of <b>Ni</b> (<b>II)</b> adsorption depended on initial concentration, contact time and pH. Equilibrium adsorption was achieved in 120 min, while maximum <b>Ni</b> (<b>II)</b> adsorption occurred at pH 4. Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms were studied and the equilibrium adsorption data was found to fit well with the Langmuir isotherm model.

The residual concentration of Mn (<b>II),</b> <b>Ni</b> (<b>II)</b> and Cd (II) were determined using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer. The results revealed that maximum <b>Ni</b> (<b>II)</b> and Cd (II) ion removal occurred at pH of 6 while Mn (II) ion occurred at pH of 7 respectively.

Thermodynamic investigation showed that standard Gibbs free energy (∆G˚) was positive indicating the feasibility and non-spontaneous of the process. The positive value of standard Enthalpy (∆H˚) implies that the reaction was endothermic and the negative standard Entropy (∆S˚) signifies decrease in the randomness at the solid/solution interface of the adsorbent during the adsorption process.

40|$|Spectra of SN 1987 A {{showing the}} <b>Ni</b> <b>II</b> 6. 634 -micron and Ar II 6. 983 -micron fine-structure lines were {{obtained}} from the Kuiper Airborne Observatory in April 1988. The signal-to-noise ratio of 100 near the peaks and resolving power of 200 are sufficient to show the average velocity of expansion from the core of about 1400 km/s and to indicate the range of velocities. An asymmetry in the profiles of both lines and a redshift of the line centroids of about 440 km/s above the 280 -km/s recessional velocity of the LMC can be explained in terms of scattering of the photons by electrons in the expanding hydrogen envelope of the supernova. A mass of 0. 0030 solar masses of <b>Ni</b> <b>II</b> can be deduced from the line strength of the <b>Ni</b> <b>II</b> line and a mass of 0. 0009 solar masses of Ar II from the Ar II line strength...|$|R
40|$|Rice husk {{has been}} widely {{reported}} as a good sorbent for heavy metals. Pretreatment of rice husk minimizes cellulose crystallinity and increases the surface area thus ensuring better adsorption capacity. Commercial base and natural base-treated rice husk were used to investigate the potential of <b>Ni</b> (<b>II)</b> adsorption from synthetic wastewater in batch systems. Effects of process variables such as pH. contact time. adsorbent dose. initial <b>Ni</b> (<b>II)</b> concentration were studied. Optimum <b>Ni</b> (<b>II)</b> adsorption was observed at pH 6 within 60 min of contact time. Experimental data showed increased amount of adsorbed Ni (11) with increasing adsorbent dose and decreased percent of adsorption with increasing initial Ni(lI) concentration. Kinetic isotherms (Langmuir. Freundlich) were also applied. Biosorption mechanism of rice husk was analyzed using SEMIEDS. FT-IR, and XRD. The results revealed that natural base produced from agro industrial waste could be used IS efficient as commercial bases during pretreatment rice husk in removing Ni(II) from wastewaters within 15 min.

40|$|The rapid {{increase}} in population and growth of industrialization worldwide has resulted in deterioration in quality of water. Industrial processes have introduced substantial amounts of potentially toxic heavy metals into the environment. Which are non-biodegradable and harmful to the human health. Adsorption {{is found to be}} promising technique for removal of heavy metal ions from aqueous solution. Due to the complexity and nonlinearity of the behavior of the adsorption processes, the conventional mathematical models correlating the governing adsorption parameters In present work Artificial neural networks have been applied for modeling applications related to adsorption studies. The adsorption of <b>Ni</b> (<b>II)</b> ions from aqueous solution is 81 - 88 % depending upon process condition. Two ANN models S- 1 & S- 2 are developed for the estimation of concentration of <b>Ni</b> (<b>II)</b> ions from aqueous solution based on the correlation between the optical densities of the solutions as determined by the digital colorimeter with the <b>Ni</b> (<b>II)</b> ion concentration present in the solution. Three ANN models NS, NM & NC are developed for adsorption studies. The present work could highlight the novel feature of the ANN model in estimation of concentration of <b>Ni</b> (<b>II)</b> ions present in aqueous solution. It is indicative & representative of several possible applications of artificial neural network modeling in the area of adsorption involving several possible combinations of adsorbents & adsorbents...|$|R
40|$|The current paper {{studies the}} {{preparation}} of a new tannin gel from Acacia nilotica for water purification and waste water remediation. Design of experiments is used for optimizing the tannin gel using tannin extract (Taguchi method) with formaldehyde in the assistance of microwave (TGAN) by the help of iodine number. The feasible combinations were tested in the removal of nickel from simulated and river water. In this study, the effect of adsorbent dosage, pH, and initial metal concentration on <b>Ni</b> (<b>II)</b> biosorption on modified Acacia nilotica tannin gel (TGAN) was investigated. Tannin gel was characterized by SEM, FTIR, XRD, and EDAX. The kinetic data was tested using pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, and intraparticle diffusion model. The results suggested that the pseudo-second-order model (R 2 > 0. 998) was the best choice among all the kinetic models describing the adsorption behavior of <b>Ni</b> (<b>II)</b> onto TGAN. Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, and Dubinin-Radushkevich adsorption models were used to represent the equilibrium data. The best interpretation for the experimental data was given by the Langmuir isotherm and the maximum adsorption capacity 250 [*]mg[*]g− 1 of <b>Ni</b> (<b>II)</b> was obtained at pH 5. 04 at 296 [*]K. Adsorption of <b>Ni</b> (<b>II)</b> onto TGAN is confirmed qualitatively {{by the use of}} atomic absorption spectroscopy. The BOD and COD values are considerably reduced after adsorption...|$|R
