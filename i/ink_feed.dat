5000|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1883 in Chicago as a lumber company by Albert Blake Dick (1856 - 1934). It soon {{expanded}} into office supplies and, after licensing key autographic printing patents from Thomas Edison, became the world's largest manufacturer of mimeograph equipment (Albert Dick coined the word [...] "mimeograph"). The company introduced the Model 0 Flatbed Duplicator in 1887. Later on, the flatbed duplicators were replaced by devices using a rotating cylinder with automatic <b>ink</b> <b>feed.</b> Basic models were hand-cranked while more elaborate machines used an electric motor.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{prominent}} turn of the century figures in Janesville was George Parker, who developed new pen technologies and styles, and eventually established the Parker Pen Company. His developments included the “lucky curve” <b>ink</b> <b>feed</b> system, and the “trench pen”—a pen commissioned by the U.S. Army for use in World War I. Parker designed and established a headquarters and factory in downtown Janesville. The Parker Pen Company was handed down to George’s son, Ken, who developed the revolutionary “Parker 51” in the 1940s. A Parker pen was used by Dwight D. Eisenhower to sign Germany’s Armistice agreement to end World War II in Europe, and subsequently General Douglas MacArthur used his 20-year-old Parker Duofold in the signing of Japan’s surrender {{at the end of the}} War in the Pacific. The Parker Pen Company was one of the top employers in the area for over 70 years. The company was eventually sold off in a leveraged buyout in the 1980s.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{printing}} quality is {{decided by the}} ink system, which is heavy and complicated in offset press. Structure optimization and parameter modification is the key step of seeking better performance in the ink system. In this paper, the ink system of modern offset press was the research object, seeking the discrepancy of different structures and parameters. The surfaces of ink rollers and cylinders were discreted by computer simulation,based on this,established the math model of steady time in batch and continuous <b>ink</b> <b>feeding</b> system, then analysised the feeding system and vibration system. The simulation result indicates that the <b>ink</b> <b>feeding</b> system, the way of vibrator oscillation, plate coverage have great influence on the dynamic property. In batch <b>ink</b> <b>feeding</b> system, the property of ink system would be improved by increasing ductor roller swing frequency, and approached to continuous <b>ink</b> <b>feeding</b> system. On the machine with adjustable ductor roller swing frequency, the steady time would be reduced by regulating ductor roller swing frequency, improved efficiency with reducing paper wasting...|$|R
50|$|To {{address these}} challenges, nanofountain probe was {{developed}} by Espinosa et al. where microchannels were embedded in AFM probes to transport ink or bio-molecules from reservoirs to substrates, realizing continuous writing at the nanoscale. Integration of continuous liquid <b>ink</b> <b>feeding</b> within the NFP facilitates more rapid deposition and {{eliminates the need for}} repeated dipping, all while preserving the sub-100-nanometer resolution of DPN.|$|R
5000|$|But by {{the early}} 1930s the Duofold’s design was viewed by the {{manufacturer}} as rather outmoded. Parker launched its replacement, the Vacumatic, in 1933, and the Duofold line was moved to second tier, even though it followed closely the Vacumatic's design with slimmer profile, streamlined look and vacumatic filling mechanism. Duofolds remained popular in Europe, being produced well into the 1960s in varying sizes and shades, and were revived in the 1980s as Parker's flagship offering once more. In 1988 (to celebrate the company's centennial), Parker launched the Duofold Centennial series of Pens (Fountain Pens, Rollerballs and Pencils). Later, they introduced the Duofold International line with models that also evoked the classic Duofold design, though smaller than the Centennial. There are also differences in the <b>ink</b> <b>feeding</b> systems, changing from their Button Filling mechanism to a cartridge/converter system.|$|R
40|$|Automatic {{and robust}} <b>ink</b> <b>feed</b> control in a web- fed offset {{printing}} press is {{the objective of}} this work. To achieve this goal an integrating controller and a multiple neural models-based controller are combined. The neural networks-based printing process models are built and updated automatically without any interaction from the user. The multiple models-based controller is superior to the integrating controller as the process is running in the training region of the models. However, the multiple models-based controller may run into generalisation prob- lems if the process starts operating in a new part of the input space. Such situations are automatically detected and the integrating controller temporary takes over the process control. The developed control configuration has success- fully been used to automatically control the <b>ink</b> <b>feed</b> in the web-fed offset printing press according to the target amount of ink. Use of the developed tools led to higher print quality and lower ink and paper waste...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to provide methods for print quality enhancements in an offset lithographic printing process. Various parameters characterising the print quality are recognised, however, in this work print quality {{is defined as the}} deviation of the amount of ink in a sample image from the reference print. The methods developed are model-based and historical data collected at the printing press are used to build the models. Inherent in the historical process data are outliers owing to sensor faults, measurement errors and impurity of the materials used. It is essential to detect and remove these outliers to avoid using them to update the process models. A process model-based outlier detection tool has been proposed. Several diagnostic measures are combined via a neural network to achieve robust data categorisation into inlier and outlier classes. To cope with the slow variation in printing process data, a SOM-based data mining and adaptive modelling technique has been proposed. The technique continuously updates the data set characterising the process and the process models if they become out-of-date. A SOM-based approach to model combination has been proposed to permit the creation of adaptive -data dependent-committees. A multiple models-based controller, which employs the process models developed, is combined with an integrating controller to achieve robust <b>ink</b> <b>feed</b> control. Results have shown that the robust <b>ink</b> <b>feed</b> controller is capable of controlling the <b>ink</b> <b>feed</b> in the newspaper printing press according to the desired process output. Based on the process modelling, techniques have also been developed for initialising the printing press {{in order to reduce the}} time needed to achieve the desired print quality. The use of the developed methods and tools at a print shop in Halmstad, Sweden, resulted in higher print quality and lower ink and paper waste...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, nano {{manufacturing}} {{using the}} FPN (Fountain Pen Nano-Lithography) with active membrane pumping is investigated. This FPN has integrated pumping chamber, micro channel, and high capacity reservoir for continuous <b>ink</b> <b>feed.</b> The {{most important aspect}} in this probe provided the control of fluid injection using active membrane pumping in chamber. The flow rates in channel by capillary force are theoretically analyzed with two different working fluids, DPD (diphenyldichlorosilane) and water, including the cantilever deflection and the control of mass flow rates by the deflection of membrane. The theoretical results are compared with numerical ones that calculated by commercial code, FLUENT...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} meet the {{limitation}} of density detection based on color mixing theory in traditional printing quality control, the study has established a relational model for colorimetric tri-stimulus value and <b>ink</b> <b>feeding</b> volume. It builds a colorimetric mathematical model from the offset printing proof, and uses the regression theory to correct the metring model and determine the dummy blackprint. So it can solve the problem of indeterminate solution in conversion process from tri-stimulus value to dot coverage. It fits the functional relationship through both dot area variation value and dot density variation value accessed via Yule- Nielsen formula so as to connect them. The experiment shows that it is available to get ink volume deviation with standard proof by chromaticity measurement, and there is a significant linear relationship between the corrected Neugebauer equation coefficient and tri-stimulus value. After normalizing the precision of Neugebauer equation which has been improved, the nonlinear relationship exists both in density variation value and area variation value, and the precision of the model is well and {{can be applied to the}} actual manufacture...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A new testing {{form was}} designed, {{in which the}} screens having gray scales and some solid blocks were included. The screens consist of gray scales from 0 to 100 % of dot {{coverage}}, and the solid blocks also have coverage scales from 0 to 100 %. Printing experiment was performed, and densities and dot coverage of specific places were measured and recorded. Based on the testing data, density or dot coverage undulation with printing impressions was indicated by curves. Furthermore analysis was taken. Dot gains in the same prints are not constant, which cause that saddle shape in prints. Some reasons from construction of press such as the gap of cylinder, swing of transferring roller and oscillation of oscillating rollers were brought out. Same values of ink presetting can not get the same printing quality in the ink zones which have the same graphic coverage. The traditional press has a long make-ready time in printing running, which can reduce the efficiency of press. Shaft-less technology of inking system is put forward to cut down the make-ready time and to decrease the power consumption. New algorithm research is necessary for ink zone presetting {{in order to get}} more precise <b>ink</b> <b>feeding.</b> Some research on the press construction is also important for the press having some inherent defects...|$|R
50|$|A {{continuous}} ink system (CIS), {{also known}} as a continuous ink supply system, a continuous flow system, an automatic ink refill system, a bulk <b>feed</b> <b>ink</b> system, or an off-axis ink delivery system is a method for delivering a large volume of liquid ink to a comparatively small inkjet printhead. Many business and professional grade printers incorporate a continuous ink system in their design to increase printing capacity.|$|R
40|$|A novel atomic force {{microscopy}} (AFM) probe {{has been}} developed to expand the capability and applications of dip-pen nanolithography (DPN) technology. This new probe has integrated microchannels and reservoirs for continuous <b>ink</b> <b>feed,</b> which allow “fountain-pen ” writing called “Fountain Pen Nanolithography ” (FPN). Ink is transported from the reservoirs through the microchannels and eventually dispensed onto substrates via a volcano-like dispensing tip. Numerical simulations have been performed to select optimal materials and suitable tip shapes providing a stable fluid-air interface in the tip. Microchannel and dispensing tip have been fabricated by surface micromachining, in particular employing 3 layers of thin films. Fluid flow through the microchannels has been experimentally examined. The probe was used to write on a gold substrate...|$|E
40|$|In the {{newspaper}} printing industry, offset is the dominating printing method {{and the use}} of multicolour printing has increased rapidly in newspapers during the last decade. The offset printing process relies on the assumption that an uniform film of ink of right thickness is transferred onto the printing areas. The quality of reproduction of colour images in offset printing is dependent on a number of parameters in a chain of steps and in the end it is the amount and the distribution of ink deposited on the substrate that create the sensation and thus the perceived colours. We identify three control points in the offset printing process and present methods for assessing the printing process quality in two of these points: • Methods for determining if the printing plates carry the correct image • Methods for determining the amount of ink deposited onto the newsprint A new concept of colour impression is introduced as a measure of the amount of ink deposited on the newsprint. Two factors contribute to values of the colour impression, the halftone dot-size and ink density. Colour impression values are determined on gray-bars using a CCD-camera based system. Colour impression values can also be determined in an area containing an arbitrary combination of cyan magenta and yellow inks. The correct amount of ink is known either from a reference print or from prepress information. Thus, the deviation of the amount of ink can be determined that can be used as control value by a press operator or as input to a control system. How a closed loop controller can be designed based on the colour impression values is also shown. It is demonstrated that the methods developed can be used for off-line print quality monitoring and <b>ink</b> <b>feed</b> control, or preferably in an online system in a newspaper printing press.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study of Surland 2 ̆ 7 s Emulsification Method, and is {{intended}} to demonstrate the effect of change in emulsification rate curve with different types of fountain solution whose surface tension was varied. The surface tension of a fountain solution can be changed {{by the addition of}} isopropyl alcohol. Two inks were modified to produce the same tack reading but a different emulsification capacity. Using the Surland method the two inks and two fountain solutions generate four different emulsification rate curves and these four curves are tested for their effect on printed quality. The printing performance of an ink is judged by the ease with which an ink can obtain ink-water balance as well as the degree of freedom from printing problems such as 2 ̆ 2 catching up 2 ̆ 2 and plate scumming. The printed sheets are sampled and the data is analyzed statistically using solid ink density and dot gain as response variables. The RIT Symmetrical Scale was included in the printing form design to facilitate solid ink density measurement and dot gain calculation. Solid ink density and dot gain variations are calculated within each printing run. The addition of isopropul alcohol to a dampening solution not only reduces its surface tension and increase its wettability but it also suppresses an ink 2 ̆ 7 s continuous emulsification tendency. Ink and water balance is easily controlled when a printing ink is able to reach a state of equilibrim with dampening solution. On the basis of observation during the on press printing run it was found that a high percentage of isopropyl alcohol in a dampening solution can dissolve the blue toner from the black ink and requires an increase of <b>ink</b> <b>feed</b> to obtain the desired optical density. This study indicates the tendency of plate 2 ̆ 2 catching up 2 ̆ 2 can be associated with emulsification rate curves. The Pb type of emulsification rate curve can be so modified that press run will encounter fewer problems. Density variation within a press run is then more easily controlled...|$|E
50|$|The typical defence {{response}} of the sea hare to a predator is the release of chemicals such as free amino acids, ink from the ink gland and opaline from the opaline gland. Chemical deterrence involves the release of toxic chemicals that are noxious to predators and rapidly dissuades them from <b>feeding.</b> <b>Ink</b> creates a dark, diffuse cloud in the water that disrupts the sensory perception of the predator by acting as a smoke screen and as a decoy. The opaline, which affects the senses dealing with feeding, causes the predator to instinctively attack the cloud of chemicals {{as if it were}} indeed food.|$|R
50|$|The Ben Lane Printing Shop {{houses the}} type of {{equipment}} that a proprietor and his successors would accumulate in adapting their press to a half-century’s technological advancements. In {{the first decades of}} the 20th century print shops continued to use old-fashioned presses for specific purposes. In the case of the Ben Lane Printing Shop, even an 1820s vintage hand press remained in occasional service. Likewise, the Cotrell newspaper press, manufactured in 1871, rolled on a regular basis, as did a treadle-operated Dorman job press of the same vintage for smaller work. Although printers still utilized racks of wood and metal type, a complicated and often cantankerous Linotype machine fulfilled many of the shop’s composition requirements. The final addition of a high-speed Heidelberg press with automatic <b>inking</b> and paper <b>feed</b> operated quickly and efficiently and dramatically increased output.|$|R
