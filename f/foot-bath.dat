6000|$|... 'I should also,' {{observed}} the doctor, who {{had passed the}} <b>foot-bath</b> on the stairs, 'I should also,' said the doctor, {{in the voice of}} an oracle, 'put her feet in hot water, and wrap them up in flannel. I should likewise,' said the doctor with increased solemnity, 'give her something light for supper--the wing of a roasted fowl now--' ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{received}} the abuse consequent on this delay in silence, {{nor did the}} Major condescend to read in the flushed face and glaring eyes of the man, the anger under which he was labouring. The old gentleman's <b>foot-bath</b> was at the fire; his gown and slippers awaiting him there. Morgan knelt down to take his boots off with due subordination: and as the Major abused him from above, kept up a growl of maledictions below at his feet. Thus, when Pendennis was crying [...] "Confound you, sir, mind that strap--curse you, don't wrench my foot off," [...] Morgan sotto voce below was expressing a wish to strangle him, drown him, and punch his head off.|$|E
25|$|Growing Muslim {{populations have}} caused public {{agencies}} {{to adapt to}} their religious practices. Airports such as the Indianapolis International Airport, Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, Kansas City International Airport have installed <b>foot-baths</b> to allow Muslims, particularly taxicab drivers who service the airports, to perform their religious ablutions in a safe and sanitary manner. and Denver International Airport included a mosque {{as part of its}} Interfaith Chapel when opened in 1996 although such developments have not been without criticism.|$|R
60|$|There {{were two}} tubs, besides <b>foot-baths,</b> basins, douche-pipes, {{and all manner}} of contrivances for cleanliness. Nat was soon luxuriating in the other bath; and while {{simmering}} there, he watched the performances of the two women, who scrubbed, clean night-gowned, and bundled into bed four or five small boys, who, of course, cut up all sorts of capers during the operation, and kept every one in a gale of merriment till they were extinguished in their beds.|$|R
5|$|Prose follows {{after this}} stanza, stating that a burial-mound {{was made for}} Helgi, and that when Helgi arrived in Valhalla, he was asked by Odin to manage things with him. In stanza 39, Helgi, now in Valhalla, has his former enemy Hunding—also in Valhalla—do menial tasks; {{fetching}} <b>foot-baths</b> {{for all of the}} men there, kindling fire, tying dogs, keeping watch of horses, and feeding the pigs before he can get any sleep. In stanzas 40 to 42, Helgi has returned to Midgard from Valhalla with a host of men. An unnamed maid of Sigrún, Helgi's valkyrie wife, sees Helgi and his large host of men riding into the mound. The maid asks if she is experiencing a delusion, if Ragnarök has begun, or if Helgi and his men have been allowed to return.|$|R
60|$|On {{the border}} of a small country called Megara, whose people were much despised in Greece, he found a chance of {{advancing}} himself, and gaining glory. He was walking {{in the middle of}} the day along a narrow path at the crest of a cliff above the sea, when he saw the flickering of a great fire in the blue air, and steam going up from a bronze caldron of water that was set on the fire. On one side of the fire was a <b>foot-bath</b> of glittering bronze. Hard by was built a bower of green branches, very cool on that hot day, and from the door of the bower stretched a great thick hairy pair of naked legs.|$|E
60|$|These encomiums {{bring them}} to Mount Pleasant and to Grandfather Smallweed's house. The door is opened by the {{perennial}} Judy, who, having surveyed them from top to toe with no particular favour, but indeed with a malignant sneer, leaves them standing there while she consults the oracle as to their admission. The oracle may be inferred to give consent from the circumstance of her returning with the words on her honey lips that they can come in {{if they want to}} it. Thus privileged, they come in and find Mr. Smallweed with his feet in the drawer of his chair {{as if it were a}} paper <b>foot-bath</b> and Mrs. Smallweed obscured with the cushion like a bird that is not to sing.|$|E
6000|$|We {{are very}} nearly halfway to-day. The weather was {{favourable}} for us until yesterday morning, {{when we got}} a head-wind which still stands by us. We have rolled and pitched, of course; {{but on the whole}} have been wonderfully well off. I have had headache and have felt faint once or twice, but have not been sick at all. My spacious cabin is very noisy at night, as the most important working of the ship goes on outside my window and over my head; but it is very airy, and if the weather be bad and I can't open the window, I can open the door all night. If the weather be fine (as it is now), I can open both door and window, and write between them. Last night, I got a <b>foot-bath</b> under the dignified circumstances of sitting on a camp-stool in my cabin, and having the bath (and my feet) in the passage outside. The officers' quarters are close to me, and, as I know them all, I get reports of the weather and the way we are making when the watch is changed, and I am (as I usually am) lying awake. The motion of the screw is at its slightest vibration in my particular part of the ship. The silent captain, reported gruff, is a very good fellow and an honest fellow. Kelly has been ill all the time, and not of the slightest use, and is ill now. Scott always cheerful, and useful, and ready; a better servant for the kind of work there never can have been. Young Lowndes has been fearfully sick until mid-day yesterday. His cabin is pitch dark, and full of blackbeetles. He shares mine until nine o'clock at night, when Scott carries him off to bed. He also dines with me in my magnificent chamber. This passage in winter time cannot be said to be an enjoyable excursion, but I certainly am making it under the best circumstances. (I find Dolby to have been enormously popular on board, and to have known everybody and gone everywhere.) ...|$|E
50|$|The Nama use a {{decoction}} of Eriocephalus umbellulatus DC., as a colic remedy, and {{the early}} Cape settlers apparently used it similarly. Extraction yields a light yellow volatile oil with a sharp, though pleasant, aromatic odour and a burning taste. Until modern times the plant has been variously used as a household medicine in the Western Province, as a tincture for heart troubles and oedema, and as a <b>foot-bath</b> for assorted conditions.|$|E
5000|$|Certain {{devices are}} {{promoted}} to allegedly remove toxins from the body. One version involves a <b>foot-bath</b> using a mild electric current, while another involves small adhesive pads {{applied to the}} skin (usually the foot). In both cases, the production of an alleged brown [...] "toxin" [...] appears after a brief delay. In {{the case of the}} foot bath, the [...] "toxin" [...] is actually small amounts of rusted iron leaching from the electrodes. The adhesive pads change color due to oxidation of the pads' ingredients in response to the skin's moisture. In both cases, the same color-changes occur irrespective of whether the water or patch even make contact with the skin (they merely require water—thus proving the color-change does not result from any body-detoxification process).|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Psychological {{disorders}} {{are associated with}} maternal and neonatal morbidities. We aimed to evaluate the effect of Lavender cream with or without <b>foot-bath</b> on depression, anxiety and stress of pregnant women. Methods: In this trial, 141 women at 25 to 28 weeks gestation were randomly assigned into three groups (47 at each group); receiving Lavender cream with <b>foot-bath,</b> only Lavender cream, or placebo, 2 g every night for two months. Depression, anxiety and stress were assessed at baseline, and 4 th and 8 th weeks after intervention, using DASS- 21. General linear model {{was used to compare}} the groups. Results: There were three losses to follow-up at the 4 th and one more at the 8 th week. Scores of all three outcomes in both Lavender and <b>foot-bath</b> and only Lavender groups were significantly lower than those in the placebo group at the 8 th week; adjusted difference of depression score - 3. 3, 95 % confidence interval - 4. 6 to - 1. 9;- 2. 4, - 3. 7 to - 1. 0, respectively, anxiety score - 1. 4, - 2. 6 to - 0. 2; - 1. 7,- 2. 9 to - 0. 5 and stress score - 3. 1, - 4. 7 to - 1. 5; - 2. 7, - 4. 3 to - 1. 1. At the 4 th week, only score of anxiety in the lavender group (- 2. 3, - 3. 9 to - 0. 8) and stress in the both groups (- 2. 3, - 4. 1 to - 0. 5; - 1. 9, - 3. 7 to - 0. 1) were significantly less than those in the placebo group. There were not statistically {{significant differences between the two}} experimental groups in terms of the outcomes. Conclusion: Lavender cream with <b>foot-bath</b> or alone can be used for pregnant women for reducing their stress, anxiety and depressio...|$|E
