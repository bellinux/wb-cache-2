5|$|White pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola) needs two {{alternate}} hosts {{to complete}} its lifecycle. One host is {{plants in the}} genus Ribes. On the blackcurrant, <b>it</b> <b>causes</b> the leaves to become pale and later develop tiny orange pustules and sometimes a yellow filamentous coating on some leaves. The fruit crop is little affected but the leaves fall early and growth is slowed the following year. The other host is any of the white pines, in which <b>it</b> <b>causes</b> serious disease and mortality for the North American species that have not co-evolved with the rust.|$|E
5|$|August 10, 1976– Prior to {{the arrival}} of Hurricane Belle from the south, 250,000 {{evacuate}} from the shore during the peak of the tourist season. While paralleling the coast just offshore, <b>it</b> <b>causes</b> winds of 65mph (105km/h) and gusts of up to 90mph (145km/h), along with a maximum rainfall total of 3.93inches (9.98cm) in Cape May Court House. In addition, the hurricane causes a storm surge of 8.85feet (2.70m) in Atlantic City. However, damage is less than expected, and no deaths occur.|$|E

When an action potential, traveling along an axon, arrives at a synapse, <b>it</b> <b>causes</b> a chemical called a neurotransmitter to be released.

5|$|Despite {{the prior}} belief that {{schizophrenia}} occurs at similar rates worldwide, its frequency varies across the world, within countries, {{and at the}} local and neighborhood level. This variation has been estimated to be fivefold. <b>It</b> <b>causes</b> approximately one percent of worldwide disability adjusted life years and resulted in 20,000 deaths in 2010. The rate of schizophrenia varies up to threefold depending on how it is defined.|$|E

5|$|During {{the spring}} and summer, {{conditions}} along {{the east coast of}} Australia are highly conducive for the formation of hailstorms. The variation of air temperature in the atmosphere; with warm and humid air close to the ground and colder air above <b>it</b> <b>causes</b> instability, and the cold upper atmosphere temperatures allow the precipitation to fall in solid form as hailstones. Since records began in 1791, hailstorms in the month of January form approximately 13% {{of the total number of}} hailstorms in the Sydney metropolitan area, and over 15% of all events with 'large hail'.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of antisymmetry, {{solutions}} of the wave equation for interacting electrons result in a zero probability that each pair will occupy the same location or state. This {{is responsible for the}} Pauli exclusion principle, which precludes any two electrons from occupying the same quantum state. This principle explains many of the properties of electrons. For example, <b>it</b> <b>causes</b> groups of bound electrons to occupy different orbitals in an atom, rather than all overlapping each other in the same orbit.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{poisoning}} {{is a type}} {{of metal}} poisoning caused by lead in the body. The brain is the most sensitive.

Some of the effects are permanent. In severe cases anemia, seizures, coma, or death may occur.|$|E

5|$|Nearly {{two billion}} {{people in the}} {{developing}} world are deficient in zinc. In children, <b>it</b> <b>causes</b> an increase in infection and diarrhea and contributes to the death of about 800,000 children worldwide per year. The World Health Organization advocates zinc supplementation for severe malnutrition and diarrhea. Zinc supplements help prevent disease and reduce mortality, especially among children with low birth weight or stunted growth. However, zinc supplements should not be administered alone, because many {{in the developing world}} have several deficiencies, and zinc interacts with other micronutrients.|$|E

5|$|Peniophora quercina {{typically}} grows upon dead wood, {{which can}} {{be attached to the}} tree or fallen, where <b>it</b> <b>causes</b> white rot. It favours oak, but can also be found on other deciduous trees, such as beech. P.quercina is known to be a pioneer species on dead wood, which means it can be the first species to grow. It is found in Europe, where it is very common. Though it can be encountered all year, it produces spores in late summer and autumn. It has also been recorded in Amur, in eastern Asia.|$|E

5|$|Reversion is {{a serious}} disease {{transmitted}} by the blackcurrant gall mite Cecidophyopsis ribis. <b>It</b> <b>causes</b> a decline in yield and is quite widespread in Europe but is rarely encountered on other continents. Symptoms include a modification of leaf shape in summer and swollen buds ("big bud") in winter, each housing thousands of microscopic mites. As pest control has limited effectiveness, severely infected bushes should be destroyed. All new plants purchased should be certified as virus-free.|$|E
