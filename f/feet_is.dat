5|$|Cold <b>Feet</b> <b>is</b> a British {{television}} pilot {{directed by}} Declan Lowney. It stars James Nesbitt and Helen Baxendale as Adam and Rachel, {{a couple who}} meet and fall in love, only for the relationship to break down when he gets cold feet. John Thomson, Fay Ripley, Hermione Norris and Robert Bathurst appear in supporting roles. The programme was written by Mike Bullen, a BBC radio producer with little screenwriting experience, who was tasked with creating a one-off television production that would appeal to middle-class television audiences, who the executive producer Andy Harries believed were underepresented on British television.|$|E

The dance form is connected to classical Hindustani music where the rhythmic nimbleness of the <b>feet</b> <b>is</b> accompanied by either Tabla or Pakhawaj. Four of the six schools of this dance form, Lucknow gharana, Ajrara gharana, Farukhabad gharana and Benares gharana, are situated in Uttar Pradesh.|$|E

5|$|The mid-11th century Gosforth Cross, {{located in}} Cumbria, England, has been {{described}} as depicting a combination of scenes from the Christian Judgement Day and the pagan Ragnarök. The cross features various figures depicted in Borre style, including a man with a spear facing a monstrous head, one of whose <b>feet</b> <b>is</b> thrust into the beast's forked tongue and on its lower jaw, while a hand is placed against its upper jaw, a scene interpreted as Víðarr fighting Fenrir. The depiction has also been theorized as a metaphor for Jesus's defeat of Satan.|$|E
5|$|Cold <b>Feet</b> <b>is</b> a British comedy-drama {{television}} series produced by Granada Television for the ITV network. The series was created and principally written by Mike Bullen as {{a follow-up to}} his award-winning 1997 Comedy Premiere of the same name. The series follows three couples experiencing the ups-and-downs of romance, originally Adam Williams and Rachel Bradley (James Nesbitt and Helen Baxendale), Pete and Jenny Gifford (John Thomson and Fay Ripley) and Karen and David Marsden (Hermione Norris and Robert Bathurst). As the original series progressed, the Giffords divorced and Pete married Jo Ellison (Kimberley Joseph), whilst Karen and David also separated forming relationships with Mark Cubitt (Sean Pertwee) and Robyn Duff (Lucy Robinson).|$|E
5|$|The {{petrification}} motif {{also appears}} in non-scriptural works. The Raghuvamsa of Kalidasa (generally dated 4th century CE) {{notes that the}} wife of Gautama (unnamed here) momentarily becomes the wife of Indra. Without explicitly mentioning the curse, it relates further that she regains her beautiful form and casts away her stony appearance, owing to the grace provided by the dust of Rama's feet, which redeems her. Gautam Patel, author of many works about Kalidasa, credits him as {{the first person to}} introduce the petrification motif. In the Ramavataram too, Rama does not have to touch Ahalya with his foot; the dust from his <b>feet</b> <b>is</b> enough to bring her back to life. As in other versions of the tale, the repentant Ahalya is turned to stone, only to be liberated by Rama, and Indra runs away disguised as a cat but is cursed to bear the marks of a thousand vulvae. The Ramavataram {{is an example of the}} Bhakti-era poets who exalt Rama as a saviour.|$|E

5000|$|In this example, {{the first}} and second <b>feet</b> <b>are</b> dactyls; their first syllables, [...] "Ar" [...] and [...] "rum" [...] respectively, contain short vowels, but count as long because the vowels are both {{followed}} by two consonants. The third and fourth <b>feet</b> <b>are</b> spondees, the first of which is divided by the main caesura of the verse. The fifth <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> a dactyl, as is nearly always the case. The final <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> a spondee.|$|R

50|$|Most {{flexible}} flat <b>feet</b> <b>are</b> asymptomatic, and do {{not cause}} pain. In these cases, there is usually no cause for concern. Flat <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> formerly a physical-health reason for service-rejection in many militaries. However, three military studies on asymptomatic adults (see section below), suggest that persons with asymptomatic flat <b>feet</b> <b>are</b> at least as tolerant of foot stress as the population with various grades of arch. Asymptomatic flat <b>feet</b> <b>are</b> no longer a service disqualification in the U.S. military.|$|R
25|$|A {{white spot}} on the breast (not {{extending}} above the sternum), belly, toes or back of the <b>feet</b> <b>is</b> permissible, but the smaller the spot the better. White beyond these areas and black anywhere on the body is not allowed in the breed standard.|$|E

5000|$|There are {{two types}} of fourth position: open and closed. In both cases, one <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> placed {{approximately}} twelve inches in front of the other. In open fourth position the heels are aligned, while in closed fourth position the heel of the front <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> aligned with the toe of the back <b>foot.</b> There <b>are</b> two variations of each type of fourth position, determined by which <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> in front.|$|R

They were released on October 31, 2006 and December 19, 2006, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Horace's poem is in couplets, where {{a line of}} iambic trimeter (six iambic <b>feet)</b> <b>is</b> {{followed}} by a line of iambic dimeter (four iambic feet).

The English translation has the same metrical couplets but the rhythm is accentual (the norm for English verse) rather than quantitative (the norm for classical Latin and Greek verse).|$|E
25|$|Happy <b>Feet</b> <b>is</b> a 2006 Australian-American computer-animated musical family comedy film directed, {{produced}}, and co-written by George Miller.

It {{was produced}} at Sydney-based visual effects and animation studio Animal Logic for Warner Bros., Village Roadshow Pictures, and Kingdom Feature Productions {{and was released}} in North American theaters on November 17, 2006. It is the first animated film produced by Kennedy Miller in association with Animal Logic.|$|E
25|$|The girl's broken feet {{required}} {{a great deal}} of care and attention, and they would be unbound regularly. Each time the <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> unbound, they were washed, the toes carefully checked for injury, and the nails carefully and meticulously trimmed. When unbound, the broken <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> also kneaded to soften them and the soles of the girl's <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> often beaten to make the joints and broken bones more flexible. The <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> also soaked in a concoction that caused any necrotic flesh to fall off.|$|R
30|$|Phases in {{the gait}} cycle were {{evaluated}} according to duration. The {{duration of the}} right swing phase {{was defined as the}} time when the right <b>foot</b> <b>was</b> off the ground, while the right stance phase was defined as the time when the right <b>foot</b> <b>was</b> on the ground. Similarly, the duration of the left swing phase was defined as the time when the left <b>foot</b> <b>was</b> off the ground, while the left stance phase was the time when the left <b>foot</b> <b>was</b> on the ground. The single support phase was defined as the period of time during which the opposite <b>foot</b> <b>was</b> lifted for swing phase, whilst the double support phase was defined as the period when both <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> in contact with the floor. The gait cycle was defined as the time interval between 2 successive occurrences of 1 repetitive event of walking.|$|R

25|$|The {{flood plain}} is much longer {{north to south}} than it is east to west. For example, within several miles of downtown, the Highlands sitting at 540 <b>feet</b> <b>is</b> out of the {{thousand}} year flood plain, whereas areas 10 miles from downtown such as Fairdale and Okolona (both between seven and 11 miles from the river) have the same elevation as downtown Louisville. Most areas in the east end have an elevation from 600 to 700 feet, which, with the typically east bound winds, trap in heat and pollutants.|$|E

At its <b>feet</b> <b>is</b> an inscription that serves to remind future generations of the generosity of Jamsetji Tata and the persistence with which he worked for the welfare of India. The building, as one of the prominent landmarks of Bengaluru, was designed by C. F. Stevens and Company of Bombay in 1912-13.|$|E
5000|$|A Russian pivot turn, as {{described}} by Bessie and May Evans, is performed as follows. The right <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> placed flat and the left <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> placed with the toe by the right heel and the left heel raised and this relative position basically maintained during the turning. The turn starts with the right foot raised from the floor. While continuously revolving, on each strong beat (downbeat) the right <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> stepped flat and on each weak beat (upbeat) the left <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> stepped on the ball (by the right heel).|$|R
