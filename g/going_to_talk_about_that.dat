60|$|He {{shook his}} head, {{and looking at}} his {{daughter}} with watery eyes, said she needn't be afraid that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> any more.

You know, my girl, that when I took you out of such a sad, miserable life to make you happy, I said that it was not from charity, and because I loved my fellow-creatures or the poor better than others; but solely because I wanted you to love me, and your affection was all the payment I ever expected or expect. But now I foresee that something will happen to make a change in you--" ...|$|E

5000|$|I think referendums are awful. The {{late and}} great Julian Critchley {{used to say}} that, not very surprisingly, they were the {{favourite}} form of plebiscitary democracy of Mussolini and Hitler. They undermine Westminster. What they ensure, {{as we saw in}} the last election, is {{that if you have a}} referendum on an issue, politicians during an election campaign say: [...] "Oh, we're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> we don't need to talk about that, that's all for the referendum." [...] So during the last election campaign, the euro was hardly debated. I think referendums are fundamentally anti-democratic in our system, and I wouldn't have anything to do with them. On the whole, governments only concede them when governments are weak.|$|E

I am not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> agenda directly tonight because I know that you know it. You know about the judicial appointments, you know about the parental consent laws, you know about the denial of funding for low-income women, you know about the global gag rule...|$|E
40|$|Thank you. It’s a {{particular}} {{pleasure to be}} with you this morning. We live in a rapidly changing and ever-more-competitive global economy. It’s vital that every region understand and leverage its special attributes and competitive advantages. SPUR has long been on the forefront of thinking about these questions for San Francisco. We’re very lucky to have such a far-sighted group working to keep our city successful. Of course, it’s not possible {{to make sense of what}} happens in the Bay Area without considering the larger economic environment in which we are situated. So this morning, I’m <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> broader economic context. I’ll start with a look at the national economy, focusing on why the recent recession was so severe and why the recovery has been relatively anemic. I’ll then talk about prospects for growth, employment, and inflation. Finally, I’ll discuss what the Federal Reserve is doing to bolster the recovery. My remarks represent my own views and not those of others in the Federal Reserve System. Let me begin by saying that I’m encouraged by recent signs of a stronger, self-sustaining recovery. I’m especially glad to see that the economy is adding jobs at a pretty decent clip. Still, we have a long way to go. The Fed’s mandate from Congress is to promote maximum employment and stable prices. 1 Inflation generally has been subdued over the past few years...|$|E

6000|$|... "Exactly! Well, {{there is}} another Englishman staying at the Lion d'Or. He {{appears to be a}} decent fellow, and a gentleman. I am not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> him. I imagine that he is harmless." ...|$|R
6000|$|Nedda's spirit gave a jump; {{he seemed}} almost at last <b>to</b> be <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> {{the things she}} wanted, above all, to find out. Her cheeks went hot, she clenched her hands and said resolutely: ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No; it's not lost. You {{will hear}} more of it directly. Dry your eyes, and expect {{something}} interesting--I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> love.

6000|$|... "In those days, Bob was a besotted whisky-tank; {{but we are}} not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> him.

40|$|I’m <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> warring {{societies}} {{and the role}} of academics in them.

6000|$|... "It's no {{good looking}} bored," [...] I went on, [...] "because I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> myself, however much it bores you.

I feel beastly." ...|$|R
