25|$|Armstrong {{also argues}} that {{contradictory}} beliefs {{show that there is}} a connection between beliefs and knowledge. He gives the example of a woman who has learned <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>is</b> dead but cannot bring herself to believe <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>is</b> dead. She both believes and disbelieves <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>is</b> dead: it just happens that one of her two beliefs is justified, true and satisfies some knowledge conditions.|$|R

She created innovative designs to make her manikins lifelike, promoting her work by publishing books and teaching puppetry theory and design. She {{and her husband are}} known as the first couple of Russian puppetry, though she was the one determined to elevate the craft.

5|$|Serb forces {{singled out}} a number of {{prominent}} individuals. Among them was Dr. Vesna Bosanac, the director of the town's hospital, who was regarded as a heroine in Croatia but demonised by the Serbian media. She and <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>were</b> taken to Sremska Mitrovica prison, where she was locked up in a single room with 66 other women for several weeks. Her husband was subjected to repeated beatings. After appeals from the International Committee of the Red Cross, the couple were eventually released in a prisoner exchange.

5|$|The farm {{became a}} center for the Russian monarchist {{community}} in Denmark and many Russian emigrants visited. Olga maintained {{a high level of}} correspondence with the Russian émigré community and former members of the imperial army. On 2 February 1935 in the Russian Orthodox Church in Copenhagen, she and <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>were</b> godparents, with her cousin Prince Gustav of Denmark, to Aleksander Schalburg, son of Russian-born Danish army officer Christian Frederik von Schalburg.

5|$|In 1242, the {{citizens}} of Tyre offered the barons opposed to Frederick's rule (Balian of Ibelin, Lord of Beirut, and Philip of Montfort, Lord of Toron) their assistance against Richard Filangieri, who ruled Tyre on Frederick's behalf. Marsilio Zorzi, the bailli of the Venetian community in the Holy Land offered naval support to the coalition. At {{the request of the}} members of the High Court, Philip of Novara, a noted jurist, stated that Frederick had forfeited his right to administer the Kingdom of Jerusalem when his son, Conrad, had reached the age of majority on 25 April 1243. Novara also argued that Alice and <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>were</b> entitled to rule the kingdom as regent for the absent Conrad because she was his closest relative who lived in the Holy Land. The members of the High Court, the representatives of the clergy, the Military Orders and the Italian communities held a joint assembly where Alice and Ralph of Nesle were proclaimed regents on 5 June. She agreed that Balian of Ibelin and Philip of Montfort would keep all royal castles in the kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Makeba married Carmichael in March 1968; {{this caused}} her {{popularity}} in the US to decline markedly. Conservatives came to regard her as a militant and an extremist, an image which alienated much of her fanbase. Her performances were cancelled and her coverage in the press declined despite her efforts to portray her marriage as apolitical. White American audiences stopped supporting her, and the US government {{took an interest in}} her activities. The Central Intelligence Agency began following her, and placed hidden microphones in her apartment; the Federal Bureau of Investigation also placed her under surveillance. While she and <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>were</b> travelling in the Bahamas, she was banned from returning to the US, and was refused a visa. As a result, the couple moved to Guinea, where Carmichael changed his name to Kwame Touré. Makeba did not return to the US until 1987.|$|E
5|$|According to Haga, the story's main {{theme was}} saving Elena from the curse and then {{returning}} to a normal life. The world design, narrative complexity and number of characters was {{kept to a minimum}} so players would have their attention directed upon the main characters' plight. When developing the characters, Haga wanted players to relate easily to Aeron, and he was developed to become not too outspoken or assertive. The character Elena was present from the beginning of development, but due to the negative feedback of testers, Elena needed to undergo a major overhaul, including redesigning her monster transformation so that players would sympathize better with her condition, and all the dialogue and cutscenes involving her being redone from scratch. As a result of these developments, the character was portrayed as a strong-willed woman {{who did not want to}} be a burden on Aeron despite her condition, in addition to helping him rather than just letting him handle the entire quest. Mavda and <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>were</b> designed to contrast with the relationship between Aeron and Elena: while they looked odd, they were in fact a devoted couple similar to the main protagonists. Her design originated from the initial ideas for the game's merchant, who would have a large pack on their back. She was compared by Haga to cynical witches found in traditional European fairy tales.|$|E
