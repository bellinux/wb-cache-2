This trend was accompanied by similar developments in the ratio of labour productivity in the tradable goods sector to the non-tradable goods sector. Thus, assuming that relative productivity trends are maintained and that the purchasing power parity (PPP) is verified in the tradable goods sector in the long run, Portugal will likely record an average annual equilibrium real appreciation vis-à-vis Germany.

First, based mainly on literature review, we describe long-term trends and potential causes of inflation differentials in the euro area {{as well as in the}} new EU member states. Second, we examine the driving factors for inflation differentials in a panel of the new European Union member states via-à-vis the euro area in 1997 - 2006. In particular, we use the methodology of the influential study by Honohan and Lane (2003) exploring the role of nominal effective exchange rate, cyclical conditions, fiscal policies and price convergence in inflation differentials across the euro area countries. The application of the same methodology and explanatory variables enables us direct comparison with results of Honohan and Lane (2003).

It {{is based on}} the Latvia’s {{quarterly}} data for the time period from 1995 to 2002 since we eliminate the early years of transition. Using conventional time series econometric technique we find strong empirical evidence in favor of internal transmission mechanism, i. e. productivity growth in the open sector leads to an increase in the relative price of non-tradable goods. The existence of external transmission mechanism is also accepted, since higher than in Germany productivity growth in the Latvia’s open sector brings about higher non-tradables inflation and thus overall inflation reflecting also the appreciation of the CPI-based real exchange rate. The paper also calculates inflation, <b>inflation</b> <b>differential</b> vis-à-vis Germany and real appreciation justified by the Balassa-Samuelson effect. We find that inflation rate in Latvia attributable to the Balassa-Samuelson effect amounts to 0, 5 - 1 %, but long term value for inflation in Latvia resulting from productivity gains in the open sector is found to be 1 - 2 %. Accordingly to our estimates the impact of the Balassa-Samuelson effect on <b>inflation</b> <b>differential</b> with respect to Germany is not expected to exceed 1, 5 % in the following years.
