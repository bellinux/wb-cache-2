Various system properties are monitored, including the one-particle velocity distribution, granular temperature, stress tensor, collision rates, and time between collisions. The one-particle velocity distribution is found to agree reasonably well with an anisotropic Gaussian distribution, with only a slight overpopulation of the high velocity tails. The velocity distribution is strongly anisotropic, especially at lower densities and lower values of the coefficient of restitution, with the largest variance in the direction of shear.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a higher-order step-by-step integration algorithm for dynamic analysis of structures with smooth hysteretic behavior under earthquakes. This algorithm solves the integral {{of the equation}} of motion; it therefore requires the ground motion velocities, rather than the ground motion accelerations typically used in conventional 2 nd-order algorithms such as the Newmark-β method, as the excitations. A velocity time history is smoother and has fewer cyclic reversals than its acceleration counterpart, making possible the use of large incremental time step size that in turn lessens computer time. Systems of single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) with (1) linear, (2) non-pinching, hysteretic, and (3) pinching, hysteretic, behaviors under the SAC ground motions are investigated. The computational efficiency of the developed algorithm is {{compared to that of}} the average acceleration method.

40|$|The ATC- 40 and FEMA- 274 {{documents}} contain simplified {{nonlinear analysis}} procedures {{to determine the}} displacement demand imposed on a building expected to deform inelastically. The Nonlinear Static Procedure in these documents, based on the capacity spectrum method, involves several approximations: The lateral force distribution for pushover analysis and conversion of these results to the capacity diagram are based only on the fundamental vibration mode of the elastic system. The earthquake-induced deformation of an inelastic SDF system is estimated by an iterative method requiring analysis of a sequence of equivalent linear systems, thus avoiding the dynamic analysis of the inelastic SDF system. This last approximation is first evaluated in this report, followed {{by the development of}} an improved simplified analysis procedure, based on capacity and demand diagrams, to estimate the peak deformation of inelastic SDF systems. Several deficiencies in ATC- 40 Procedure A are demonstrated. This iterative procedure did not converge for some of the systems analyzed.

The approximate procedure underestimates significantly the deformation {{for a wide range of}} periods and ductility factors with errors approaching 50 %, implying that the estimated deformation is about half the “exact” value.

40|$|The {{study of}} the {{torsional}} response of buildings in the inelastic range of behaviour is of great interest since the ability of structures to resist strong earthquakes mainly relies on their ductility and capacity for energy dissipation.

The earthquake load is modelled as a deterministic time history which {{is expressed in}} terms of a Fourier series that is modulated by an enveloping function. Subsequently, the coefficients of the series representation, and, the parameters of the envelope function are determined such that the structure inelastic deformation is maximized subject to a set of predefined constraints. These constraints include bounds on the total energy of the earthquake signal, peak values on ground acceleration, velocity and displacement and upper and lower bounds on the Fourier spectra of the ground acceleration. Additional mathematical limits on the envelope parameters are also considered. The quantification of these constraints is obtained based on numerical analysis of a set of past recorded ground motions at the site under consideration or other sites with similar soil conditions. The structure force–displacement relation is taken to possess an elastic–plastic behavior. The resulting nonlinear optimization problem is tackled by using the sequential quadratic optimization method.

Utilizing the APG device (ACI Medical, San Marcos, CA, USA), venous volumes, venous filling indexes and ejection fraction measurements were captured on 10 patients with varying degrees of venous disease. Measurements were obtained for each patient at baseline (without compression), with either 30 - 40 or 20 - 30 mmHg elastic compression stockings (ECS) and an inelastic compression wrap (ICW) (Juxta-CURES tm by Circaid Medical, San Diego, CA, USA). The compression level of the ECS was measured at the B 1 point utilizing a Picopress® [Microlab Elettronica Sas, Roncaglia di Ponte San Nicolò (PD), Italy] and the ICW was adjusted to provide the exact compression level as the ECS in order to compare the effects of inelasticity versus elasticity independent of compression differences.

40|$|To date, {{experimental}} studies have illustrated that foundation rocking can advantageously provide an isolation mechanism, dissipating energy, and re-centering of building-foundation systems. It is hypothesized that by balancing the beneficial attributes of foundation rocking and inelastic structural behavior (structural fuse), a building-foundation system's seismic performance can be significantly improved. This dissertation validates this hypothesis from three distinct, yet complementary aspects. The first two involve {{a pair of}} system-level experiments focused on low-rise moment-resisting frame and frame-wall structural systems at centrifuge scale, while the last is completed via numerical analyses. For each of the test programs, three fundamental model configurations were constructed considering the strength difference between the rocking foundation and the structural fuse, namely; Structural Hinging Dominated (SHD), Foundation Rocking Dominated (FRD), and Balanced Design (BD) models. All model specimens were subjected to a sequence of earthquake loading. Experimental {{results indicate that the}} SHD models consistently observe the largest building residual drifts and peak roof accelerations, while the FRD models consistently observe the largest footing settlement. The BD models, however, are able to recover and report negligible residual displacements. Importantly, dissipated energy is well distributed amongst the structural fuses and the rocking footings in the BD systems. The frame-wall system test also highlights the significant impacts of seismic-induced axial load variation and building asymmetry on seismic performance. With the rocking wall placed {{at the far end of}} the lateral load resisting path, loading towards the strong (wall) direction dramatically reduces axial load on the interior rocking footing. This reduction leads to a highly asymmetric footing moment- rotation hysteresis with a "bend-over" behavior. Moreover, system-level load-carrying capacity varies significantly between the weak and strong directions. In the final phase of this research, two parameters, defined as the energy dissipation ratio (R/ED) and the re-centering ratio (R/RC), are proposed to quantify the ability of an <b>inelastic</b> <b>system</b> to dissipate hysteretic energy and to recover from large amplitude transient displacements, respectively. The relation between the R/ED and R/RC is investigated by numerically studying a variety of simplified inelastic systems under cyclic loading.

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the seismic {{performance}} of structures and to reduce the total cost (both direct and indirect) due to earthquake damages, structural control through seismic protective devices in either passive or semi-active forms is essential to achieve the desired performance goals. This research intends to develop optimal design and placement of seismic protective devices for improving structural performance of buildings and bridges. This is accomplished by deriving (a) optimal nonlinear damping for inelastic structures, (b) hybrid numerical simulation framework to facilitate nonlinear structural control analysis and (c) efficient seismic protective scheme for bridges using base isolation, nonlinear supplemental damping and semi-active MR dampers. Supplemental energy dissipation {{in the form of}} nonlinear viscous dampers is often used to improve the performance of structures. The effect of nonlinear damping is a function of structural properties, ground motion characteristics and performance objectives. In order to quantify the optimal amount of nonlinear damping needed for inelastic structures, a novel dimensionless nonlinear damping ratio is first proposed through dimensional analysis of inelastic SDOF structures. Subsequently, an equivalent SDOF <b>inelastic</b> <b>system</b> is derived to represent the general MDOF inelastic structures. Based on this equivalency and the help of the nonlinear damping ratio definition, the optimal damping and damper placement for MDOF inelastic structures are developed using genetic algorithms. It's demonstrated that the added nonlinear damping is not always beneficial for inelastic structures, i. e. resulting in the increase of total acceleration response under certain ground motions. A critical structure-to-input frequency ratio exists, upon which an optimal nonlinear damping is needed to balance between the increase of total acceleration and the reduction of structural drift. Secondly, to facilitate the nonlinear control simulation of complex structures, an existing hybrid testing framework (UI_SimCor) is adopted and modified to enable the dynamic analysis of nonlinear structures equipped with seismic protective devices, including nonlinear viscous dampers, base isolators and MR dampers. Under this framework, inelastic structures can be modeled realistically in general FEM platform (e. g. OpenSees) while the seismic protective devices can be modeled numerically in a different software (e. g. Matlab). Furthermore, control algorithms can also be implemented easily under this hybrid simulation scheme. To validate the hybrid simulation approach, an experimental program is implemented on a scaled 3 -story steel frame structure controlled by a semi-active MR damper. Both real-time hybrid simulation and shake table tests were performed and compared. The good agreement between them verifies the accuracy and efficiency of the hybrid simulation scheme. In addition, for application to bridges, special scheme to incorporate multi-support input earthquake motions is also developed so that the significant soil-structure interaction effects on bridges can be simulated. Finally, the efficient seismic protective scheme for bridges is explored using the hybrid simulation scheme developed. A real highway bridge, the Painter Street Bridge (PSB) is modeled realistically in OpenSees including soil-structure interaction effects while the seismic protective devices and control algorithm are implemented separately in Matlab. Clipped-optimal control algorithm based on LQG regulator and Kalman filter is adopted to derive the optimal structural response of PSB with base isolation and semi-active controlled MR dampers. Eventually, an equivalent passive form of MR dampers is developed, which can mimic the effects of semi-active control to achieve the optimal design of seismic protective devices for highway bridge applications...|$|E

In order to gain useful insight into the behavior of these systems, one degree of freedom piecewise linear elastic mechanical models are first analyzed and the be-havior to short duration sine pulses as well as longer duration transient and stochastic earth-quake excitations is investigated. The analysis is then extended to nonlinear single degree of freedom structural models possessing combined piecewise linear elastic and elasto-plastic restoring force characteristics. The analysis is concentrated on the estimation of the sensitiv-ity of the deterministic and probabilistic response spectra characteristics to system and load-ing parameters such as stiffness ratio, gap sizes between deck structure and stoppers, inelastic parameters, excitation strength and frequency content. The subset simulation method is used to efficiently estimate the probabilistic response spectra The analysis is then extende...|$|R

These models cover a large range of soil conditions and structural typologies under several earthquake databases. Some modeling strategies are introduced and validated in order to reduce the computational cost.

40|$|Based on {{structural}} dynamics theory, the modal pushover analysis procedure (MPA) retains the conceptual simplicity of current procedures with invariant force distribution, now common in structural engineering practice. The MPA procedure for estimating seismic demands is extended to unsymmetric-plan buildings. In the MPA procedure, the seismic demand due to individual {{terms in the}} modal expansion of the effective earthquake forces is determined by nonlinear static analysis using the inertia force distribution for each mode, which for unsymmetric buildings includes two lateral forces and torque at each floor level. These “modal” demands due to the first few terms of the modal expansion are then combined by the CQC rule to obtain {{an estimate of the}} total seismic demand for <b>inelastic</b> <b>systems.</b> When applied to elastic systems, the MPA procedure is equivalent to standard response spectrum analysis (RSA). The MPA estimates of seismic demand for torsionally-stiff and torsionally-flexible unsymmetric systems are shown to be similarly accurate as they are for the symmetric building; however, the results deteriorate for a torsionally-similarly-stiff unsymmetric-plan system and the ground motion considered because (a) elastic modes are strongly coupled, and (b) roof displacement is underestimated by the CQC modal combination rule (which would also limit accuracy of RSA for linearly elastic systems) ...|$|R

In this paper, we estimate the revenue elasticity of the principal taxes in Mexico, finding a much greater elasticity than that found in previous studies. A cointegration model between the revenue and taxes is used which satisfies strong exogeneity, providing a basis for congruent and reliable projections.

40|$|An {{earthquake}} intensity measure (IM) is {{a characteristic}} of a recorded ground motion that quanti…es the severity of a seismic event. In reliability analysis of structural systems subjected to ground shaking, the choice of IM plays a leading role. In probabilistic engineering assessment, the IM is used both as a scale factor for recorded ground motions in incremental dynamic analysis and as that parameter which de…nes the seismic hazard at a speci…ed site. In this paper, the geometric mean of pseudo-spectral acceleration ordinates over a certain range of periods, Sa,avg, {{is used as a}} scalar IM to predict inelastic structural response of buildings subjected to recorded ground motions. This average of spectral values is a better predictor than the elastic pseudo-spectral acceleration at fundamental period of structure, Sa, especially for <b>inelastic</b> structural <b>systems.</b> Furthermore, the seismic hazard at the site in terms of Sa,avg as IM is simpler than the one performed for vector-valued and inelastic IMs. Especially for <b>inelastic</b> multi-degree-of-freedom <b>systems</b> with long periods, Sa,avg is very sensitive to higher-mode effects, showing a limited levels of dispersion at different given ductility levels. Sa,avg is studied as a statistical predictor of structural response and is compared with conventional elastic and inelastic scalar IMs. The study is completed with suggestions about the period range over which the average should be calculated, the spacing periods and the necessary number of points of spectral ordinates, in order for Sa,avg to be most effective...|$|R
40|$|An {{evolutionary}} gain formulation {{is proposed}} for minimizing the performance damage index of steel buildings subjected to earthquake forces. The gain formulation herein {{is used to}} develop the evolutionary control law of a control algorithm applied to <b>inelastic</b> <b>systems.</b> The optimal evolutionary gain is subse-quently used to control building damages by satisfying desired performance objectives per time step “as needed”. The performance objectives are defined for various “damage-safe ” and elastic demands. When the structure responds in the post-yield (inelastic) state, the material is assumed to follow a kinematic rule for strain hardening, which consequently may redefine the performance objective window at each unload/reload response state (cyclic control). A control nonlinear time-history analysis program, dubbed CONON, was developed to simulate the stress-strain responses of structural members and to compute the optimal control forces per time step. The minimization of the cost function is independent of weighing matrices, thus alleviating cumbersome calculations that also lack physical description. Instead, an iterative Riccati matrix is computed per time step and is used to generate the evolutionary gain for the system leading to an appropriate evolution of the state transition between time steps. The calculated control responses are compared to uncontrolled responses. The results are also compared using various methods of gain calculation by examining the force-deflection hysteresis plots, the strain energy dissipation in the structural members, and the member accelerations of a steel frame. The proposed optimal system shows an excellent capability to control the desired target responses and meet acceptable performance objectives. 1...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{provides the}} foundation for an in-depth understanding and significant development of the tail-equivalent linearization method (TELM) to solve different classes of nonlinear random vibration problems. The TELM is a linearization method that uses the first-order reliability method (FORM) to define a tail-equivalent linear system (TELS) and to estimate {{the tail of the}} response distribution for nonlinear systems under stochastic inputs. The method was originally developed in the time domain for <b>inelastic</b> <b>systems.</b> It was later extended in the frequency domain for a specific class of nonlinear excitations, while the frequency domain version for <b>inelastic</b> <b>systems</b> is covered in the present work. This dissertation mathematically formalizes and extends TELM analysis with different types of discretization of the input process. A general formulation for discrete representation of a Gaussian band-limited, white-noise process is introduced, which employs the sum of deterministic and orthogonal basis functions weighted by random coefficients. The selection of the basis functions completely defines the two types of discretizations used in the earlier works. Specifically, a train of equally spaced time delta-Dirac functions leads to the current time-domain discretization, while harmonic functions with equally spaced frequencies lead to the current frequency-domain discretization. We show that other types of orthogonal basis functions can be used with advantage to represent a Gaussian band-limited white noise and in particular we employ sinc basis functions, which are {{at the base of the}} Whittaker-Shannon interpolation formula. We demonstrate that this representation is suitable for reducing the total number of random variables that are necessary to describe the process, since it decouples the computational-time discretization from the band-limit of the process. Next, the dissertation tackles the problem of a nonlinear system subjected to multi-component excitations by defining an augmented standard normal space composed of all the random variables that define the multiple components of the excitation. The tail-equivalent linearization and definition of the TELS is taken in this new space. Once the augmented TELS is defined, response statistics of interest are determined by linear random vibration analysis by superposition of responses due to each component of the excitation. The method is numerically examined for an asymmetric structure with varying eccentricity and subjected to two statistically independent components of excitation. Several practical problems require analysis for non-stationary excitations. For this important class of problems the original TELM requires linearization for a series of points in time to study the evolution of response statistics. This procedure turns out to be computationally onerous. As an approximate alternative, we propose the evolutionary TELM, ETELM. In particular, we adopt the concepts of the evolutionary process theory, to define an evolutionary TELS, ETELS. The ETELS approximately estimates the continuous time evolution of the design point by only one TELM analysis. This is the essence of its efficiency compared to the standard TELM analysis. Among response statistics of interest, the first-passage probability represents the most important one for this class of problems. This statistic is efficiently computed by using the Au-Beck important sampling algorithm, which requires knowledge of the evolving design points, in conjunction with the ETELS. The method is successfully tested for five types of excitation: (I) uniformly modulated white noise, (II) uniformly modulated broad-band excitation, (III) uniformly modulated narrow-band excitation, (IV) time- and frequency-modulated broad-band excitation, and (V) time- and frequency-modulated narrow-band excitation...|$|R
