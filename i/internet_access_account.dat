5000|$|In an Oklahoma case, Capitol Records v. Deborah Foster, the RIAA {{was forced}} to dismiss a case after a woman filed a motion for leave to make a motion for summary {{judgment}} and attorneys fees, stating that {{she had nothing to}} do with file sharing and that her only nexus to the case was that she had paid for internet access. The judge ruled that the RIAA's withdrawal of the case—after one and a half years of litigation—did not immunize it from possible liability for attorneys fees, holding that the defendant was a [...] "prevailing party" [...] under the Copyright Act. The Court subsequently ruled that defendant was entitled to be reimbursed for her reasonable attorneys fees, since the RIAA's pursuit of its case was, at best, [...] "marginal", and was being pursued to extract a settlement from someone who was clearly known not to be the direct infringer. The Court noted that the mere fact that Ms. Foster was a person who paid for an <b>internet</b> <b>access</b> <b>account</b> was not a basis for a copyright infringement lawsuit against her. Ms. Foster's motion for attorneys fees had been supported by an amicus curiae brief of the American Civil Liberties Union, Public Citizen, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the American Association of Law Libraries, and ACLU Foundation of Oklahoma.|$|E

Despite articulate pleas for network upgrades to accelerate <b>internet</b> <b>access,</b> there is little rigorous research quantifying benefits to individual firms that arise from upgraded internet connectivity. We use a large New Zealand micro-survey of firms linked to unit record firm financial data to determine the impact that differing types of <b>internet</b> <b>access</b> have on firm productivity. Propensity score matching is used to control for factors, including the firm’s (lagged) productivity, that determine firms’ <b>internet</b> <b>access</b> choices. Having matched firms, we examine the productivity impacts that arise when a firm adopts different types (speeds) of internet connectivity. Broadband adoption is found to boost productivity but we find no productivity differences across broadband type.

40|$|Previous {{studies on}} face {{preferences}} {{have found that}} online and laboratory experiments yield similar results with samples from developed countries, {{where the majority of}} the population has <b>internet</b> <b>access.</b> No study has yet explored whether the same holds true in developing countries, where {{the majority of the population}} does not have <b>internet</b> <b>access.</b> This gap in the literature has become increasingly important given that several online studies are now using cross-country comparisons. We therefore sought to determine if an online sample is representative of the population in the developing country of El Salvador. In studies of Hispanic men and women aged 18 - 25, we tested facial masculinity and adiposity preferences by collecting data in person as well as online. Our results showed that there were no differences in preferences between people who reported having <b>internet</b> <b>access,</b> whether they were tested online or in person. This provides evidence that testing style does not bias preferences among the same population. On the other hand, our results showed multiple differences in preferences between people who reported having <b>internet</b> <b>access</b> and people who reported not having <b>internet</b> <b>access.</b> More specifically, we found that people without <b>internet</b> <b>access</b> preferred more feminine men, more masculine women, and women with higher adiposity than people with <b>internet</b> <b>access.</b> We also found that people without <b>internet</b> <b>access</b> had fewer resources (e. g. running water) than people with <b>internet</b> <b>access,</b> suggesting that harshness in the environment may be influencing face preferences. These findings suggest that online studies may provide a distorted perspective of the populations in developing countries...|$|R

Finally, at the level of practice, the paper recommends striking a balance between “universal” and “contextual” <b>internet</b> <b>access</b> in an urban area so that <b>internet</b> <b>access</b> becomes linked with other cultural services, and is integrated into local contexts of use...|$|R
