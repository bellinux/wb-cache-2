The <b>exit</b> flow <b>angles</b> of about 24 % spans near the endwall decrease, indicating that the flow turning angles of the region increase. This finding agrees {{with the results of}} the elimination of corner 3 D separation after ESA suction. At 50 % to about 76 % spans, the <b>exit</b> flow <b>angles</b> increase to about 0 ° as the trailing edge separation increases.

5000|$|Electrostatic analyzers are {{designed}} in different configurations. A simple version is a radial cylindrical analyzer, {{which consists of}} two curved parallel plates at different potentials. Ions or electrons enter the analyzer {{at one end and}} either pass through the other end or collide with the walls of the analyzer, depending on their initial energy. In these types of analyzers, only the radial component of the velocity of a charged particle is changed by an ESA since the potential on the plates only varies in the radial direction if one considers the geometry in cylindrical coordinates. Poisson's Equation can be then used to calculate the magnitude of the electric field pointing radially inwards. The resultant inward-pointing force generated by this electric field will cause the particles' trajectories to curve in a uniform circular motion. Depending on initial energy (velocity), only certain particles will therefore have the [...] "correct" [...] motion to exit the analyzer by tracing its physical structure, while others will collide into the walls of the instrument. In addition to the energy, the angle of entry will also affect the particles' time-of-flight through the analyzer as well as <b>exit</b> <b>angle.</b> In practice, the plates are usually oppositely charged and at very high potentials. Also, the inner surface of the analyzer, usually made of aluminum for space missions, is sometimes plated with black chrome or even Ebonol C to absorb stray light, instead of allowing it to bounce its way through.|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] - Changing some {{geometric}} {{characteristic of}} the impeller in centrifugal pumps improves their performance. It is known that blade <b>exit</b> <b>angle</b> plays very {{important role in the}} performance of a centrifugal pump. To investigate effect of blade <b>exit</b> <b>angle</b> on the performance of centrifugal pump by means of experiment is very expensive and lengthy process. Due to expensive and lengthy process, it can be obtained by using mathematical model. In the present study three pumps of different specific speeds are taken for the investigation. Initially mathematical model presented by Gulich [1] is validated with manufacturer’s head-flow curve and then it is used to investigate the effect of blade <b>exit</b> <b>angle.</b> It is seen that the Gulich [1] model is in very good agreement with the manufacturer’s head-flow curve. Moreover the blade <b>exit</b> <b>angle</b> has significant effect on the head and the efficiency of the centrifugal pump.

30|$|Normally, pump {{designers}} {{design the}} pumps {{for water and}} they rarely test for different viscosities. Obviously, higher viscosity has detrimental effect on performance as the higher viscosity has more resistance to flow (Murakami et al. 1980; Telow 1942; Ippen 1946; Itaya and Nishikawa 1960). Again, the density effect has not been considered by the researchers. If the fluid is having higher viscosity or density it is inevitable to check amount of extra power consumption required and this will help energy auditing of a company.
