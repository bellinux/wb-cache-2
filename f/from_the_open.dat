5|$|Large {{fish are}} caught with the bill-tip, then tossed {{up in the}} air to be caught and slid into the gullet head-first. A gull will {{sometimes}} stand on the pelican's head, peck it to distraction, and grab a fish <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> bill. Pelicans in their turn sometimes snatch prey from other waterbirds.|$|E

This fort replaced a seven-gun battery on the east bank, which was built in 1764.|$|E

5|$|Adult hawksbill {{sea turtles}} are {{primarily}} found in tropical coral reefs. They are usually seen resting in caves and ledges {{in and around}} these reefs throughout the day. As a highly migratory species, they inhabit {{a wide range of}} habitats, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> ocean to lagoons and even mangrove swamps in estuaries. Little is known about the habitat preferences of early life-stage E. imbricata; like other young sea turtles, they are assumed to be completely pelagic, remaining at sea until they mature.|$|E
5|$|The fin whale's body is {{long and}} slender, {{coloured}} brownish-grey with a paler underside. The fin whale is a large baleen whale that belongs to the Cetacean order, which includes all species of whale, dolphin and porpoise. At least two recognized subspecies exist, in the North Atlantic and the Southern Hemisphere. It is found in all the major oceans, from polar to tropical waters. It is absent only from waters close to the ice pack at the poles and relatively small areas of water away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> ocean. The highest population density occurs in temperate and cool waters. Its food consists of small schooling fish, squid, and crustaceans including copepods and krill.|$|E
5|$|The {{player has}} access to unlockable {{abilities}} that can open new paths of exploration, such as shrinking to access small areas like vents, teleportation which allows the player to reach otherwise unreachable platforms, and farts which trigger an explosion that defeats nearby enemies when combined with a naked flame. Actions committed against enemies outside of battle affects them in combat; the player or opponent who strikes first to trigger a fight will have the first turn in battle. Combat {{takes place in a}} battle area separate <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> game world. Battles use turn-based gameplay and each character takes a turn to attack or defend before yielding to the next character.|$|E

5|$|The {{roof of the}} fort, {{accessed}} via {{steps up}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> battery, was altered substantially {{during the first half}} of the 20th century to accommodate new guns and other structures. These include emplacements for 5.5-inch and 6-inch guns as well as 12-pdrs, searchlight positions, shelters, an observation post, a fire control building, a machine-gun parapet on the north caponier and a Royal Navy monitoring station.|$|E
5|$|Two days later, Tuesday 23 February, Gothenburg passed Cooktown {{at about}} 2:00pm. The {{wind and rain}} {{severely}} increased and cloud cover became so thick it blocked out the sun. Despite this, she continued the journey south into worsening weather, in a deep water passage between the North Queensland coastline and the Great Barrier Reef, known as the inner route. Although taking this route provided some protection <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> sea, captains had to navigate and thread {{their way through a}} number of then uncharted reefs. All passengers and crew expected to be in Newcastle on Sunday evening for a scheduled stopover.|$|E
5|$|Comcast's {{office space}} was {{designed}} by Daroff Design + DDI Architects and Gensler. Comcast's space is topped by a conference room floor with the executive offices on the four floors below it. Below that are more offices and then, on the 43rd and 44th floors, is Ralph's Cafe, a two-story cafeteria space named after the company founder Ralph J. Roberts. Below the cafe is the training center called Comcast University. The rest of the space is used for content and programing teams, customer service, Technology & Product teams, Finance and Legal. The interior design of the offices are designed {{with a variety of}} shape and color ranging <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> white space of the upper offices to the colorful walls of the training center. Other designs include a glass and stainless steel staircase that wraps around a four-story column of flat-screen monitors and connects the executive floors.|$|E

5|$|Depth and {{dimension}} are rendered {{by the use}} {{of linear}} perspective, by the overlapping of the layers of shapes, and in particular, as stated by Clark, through the use of tone. This compositional element operates within the picture in a number of ways. First, there is the appearance of natural light within the painted room and beyond it. The pictorial space in the midground and foreground is lit from two sources: by thin shafts of light <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> door, and by broad streams coming through the window to the right. The 20th-century French philosopher and cultural critic Michel Foucault observed that the light from the window illuminates both the studio foreground and the unrepresented area in front of it, in which the king, the queen, and the viewer are presumed to be situated. For José Ortega y Gasset, light divides the scene into three distinct parts, with foreground and background planes strongly illuminated, between which a darkened intermediate space includes silhouetted figures.|$|E
5|$|Despite German {{claims that}} the {{blockage}} did not impede their operations, the operation to close the Ostend canal {{seemed to have been}} at least partially successful. The channel was largely blocked and so Bruges was ostensibly closed off <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> sea, even if the position of the blockship meant that smaller ships could get through. In fact, the entire operation had been rendered moot before it even began, due to events at the wider canal in Zeebrugge. British assessments of that operation had proven optimistic and the channel there had not been properly closed. Small coastal submarines of the UC class had been able to pass through the channel as early as the morning after the Zeebrugge Raid and German naval engineers were able to dredge channels around the blockages at both ports over the coming weeks.|$|E
5|$|After {{passing the}} Swan Islands, Janet made {{landfall}} on the Yucatán Peninsula between Corozal Town, British Honduras, and Chetumal, Mexico, at 1700UTC on September28. At the time, it had winds of 175mph (280km/h). Hurricane force winds were reported {{for two hours}} preceding the hurricane's landfall, with numerous pressure readings below 948mbar (hPa; 28.00inHg). Roads and crops on the peninsula sustained heavy damage due to Janet. In Xcalak, Quintana Roo, the strong winds from Janet flattened the port's infrastructure, and only one house remained intact after the storm's passage. 97people were killed in Xcalak, constituting {{more than a third}} of the port's population. Chetumal, Mexico was devastated, with only four buildings left standing. Storm surge pushed water to a depth of 6.5feet (2m), 1600ft (490m) inland, despite the peninsula protecting the city <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> ocean. The death toll in Chetumal remains uncertain; 120bodies were recovered in the city but it is unknown how many were ever found. An additional 10,000people in the city were left homeless after the hurricane, and were forced to sleep in the open overnight. Federal relief agencies previously providing service for areas affected by Hurricanes Gladys and Hilda earlier in the year in western areas of the Gulf Coast of Mexico were ordered to extend relief operations to the Yucatán Peninsula. In Quintana Roo, Hurricane Janet was estimated to have caused $40million in damages and at least 500deaths, the most of any region affected by Janet.|$|E
