40|$|Graduation date: 1976 Nutrient and {{particulate}} matter balances were established for five ecosystems dominated by Douglas-fir [Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco] {{in the western}} Cascades, Oregon. Carriers of N and P were {{particulate matter}} (dust in precipitation and sediment in streams) and dissolved matter in both precipitation and stream water. The input and outflow of these materials (particulates, N and P) are interpreted in relation to atmospheric and forest ecosystem processes. Drainage basin sites are FC- 2 (north), HJA- 7, 9 and 10 (central), and CC- 4 (south). Climate at all sites is maritime with cool-wet falls, winters, and springs and warm-dry summers. Soils, from igneous parent materials (Tuff, andesite, basalt), are porous, deep and of loam to silty clay texture. The basins are steep (12 - 70 % slope) and completely covered by natural forest vegetation. varied {{by a factor of}} 2 or 3 over the range of runoff among the sites. The N outflow is explained by environmental factors, chemical composition f forest litter and the flushing efficiency of the annual runoff. Organic P may be controlled by litter quality, but ortho-P outflow was greatest where parent materials were dominantly tuff and declined according to the increasing proportions of less easily weathered basalt andesite, Dust depositions were 14. 3 % of suspended sediment (SS) outflows, but varied according to the <b>geologic</b> <b>erosion</b> rate among sites. At FC-Z, dust deposition exceeded SS by 177 %, but deposition was only 5. 0 % of SS at CC- 4. Dust deposition was an important source of soil material and partly offset <b>geologic</b> <b>erosion.</b> Mean N inputs, 1. 6 - 3. 2 times the outflows, were considered important in relation to known inputs by symbiotic fixation. Mean P inputs were 51 % of outflows, but were considered relatively unimportant because of the abundant supply in igneous bedrock...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} {{confined}} to {{a consideration of the}} genesis of soil patterns formed on basalt in four districts in northern New South Wales and Queensland. The chief features of five distinct groups of soils -probably of great soil group status -recognized in these soil patterns are described. It is concluded that any interpretation based solely on the present climatic conditions is inadequate. It is submitted that, in the patterns described, the different soil groups represented commenced to form during different climatic eras, on a new basalt flow or. on a new basalt surface exposed by erosion. In each case the newly initiated soil would be in conformity with the pedogenic environment of the era. For instance, under high rainfall the red soils would be initiated; under low rainfall the black soils would be expected to form. These soils tend to persist unless removed by erosion in spite of subsequent changes in the pedogenic environment. This points to the importance of the time factor in the form of past climatic eras and of <b>geologic</b> <b>erosion</b> in the development of these soil patterns. It is suggested that these pedogenic factors may be important in the development of many soil patterns...|$|E
40|$|Evaluating the {{potential}} impacts of intensive silvicultural practices on water quality {{is critical for}} establishing the long-term sustainability of contemporary forest management practices. From 1979 to 1985, a study involving nine small (~ 2. 5 ha) forested watersheds was conducted near Alto, Texas in the upper western Gulf-Coastal Plain to evaluate the impacts then-current silvicultural practices on water quality. In the years following the study, silvicultural Best Management Practices (BMPs) including Streamside Management Zones (SMZs) and other erosion control practices evolved and questions arose about the applicability of earlier results to current practices. In 1999, these same watersheds were reinstrumented to evaluate the water quality effects of intensive silviculture using modern BMPs. Three years of pre-treatment data were collected to calibrate the watersheds. During the calibration phase, in June 2001, Tropical Storm Allison struck southeastern Texas, dumping almost 11. 8 cm of rainfall on saturated soils in about 3 hours. This single storm event resulted in over 73 % of the annual flow and over 95 % of the annual sediment for 2001. In a little over three hours, the watersheds clearcut and chopped in 1980 generated over 2. 5 times more sediment that the entire year following harvest and site-preparation. 1 Comparisons of data from the 1979 Alto Watershed study with pretreatment data from the current study suggest that these watersheds have a high potential for <b>geologic</b> <b>erosion</b> even with mature forest cover.

40|$|Abstract: Accelerated {{streambank}} erosion {{is a major}} cause of non-point source pollution associated with increased sediment supply. A quantitative prediction of {{streambank erosion}} rate provides a tool to apportion sediment contribution of streambank sediment source to the total load transported by a river. A method for developing quantitative prediction of streambank erosion rates and examples of its implementation are presented. The prediction model presented utilizes a rational estimation, process-integration approach. A streambank erodibility index and calculated near-bank stresses are utilized in the prediction model. Streambank characteristics involving measurements of bank heights, angles, materials, presence of layers, rooting depth, rooting density and per cent of bank protection, are used to develop the streambank erodibility index. Measured data are converted to a normalization index for application {{for a wide range of}} channel sizes and types. Near-bank stress requires calculation of vertical velocity profiles and shear stress for subsequent distribution of energy calculations in the near-bank region. The measured field values, converted to prediction indices, were tested against measured annual streambank erosion rates. The results of an analysis of variance performed on two independent data sets from two varied hydro-physiographic regions indicated a highly significant relation. Application in regions other than those used to develop the relations are also presented. Applications in river and riparian management, stream channel stability analysis, streambank stabilization programs, river restoration, and sediment studies are presented. This model was also used to compare <b>geologic</b> <b>erosion</b> with anthropogenic sources and the consequence of riparian vegetation changes on streambank erosion rates. The model has particular advantages when used for stream channel stability departure analysis and sediment TMDL's...|$|E
40|$|For {{more than}} a century, geologists have sought to measure the {{distribution}} of erosion rates on Earth’s dynamic surface. Since the mid- 1980 s, measurements of in situ 10 Be, a cosmogenic radionuclide, {{have been used to}} estimate outcrop and basin-scale erosion rates at 87 sites around the world. Here, we compile, normalize, and compare published 10 Be erosion rate data (n = 1599) in order to understand how, on a global scale, <b>geologic</b> <b>erosion</b> rates integrated over 103 to 106 years vary between climate zones, tectonic settings, and different rock types. Drainage basins erode more quickly (mean = 218 m Myr− 1; median = 54 m Myr− 1) than outcrops (mean = 12 m Myr− 1; median = 5. 4 m Myr− 1), likely reflecting the acceleration of rock weathering rates under soil. Drainage basin and outcrop erosion rates both vary by climate zone, rock type, and tectonic setting. On the global scale, environmental parameters (latitude, elevation, relief, mean annual precipitation and temperature, seismicity, basin slope and area, and percent basin cover by vegetation) explain erosion rate variation better when they are combined in multiple regression analyses than when considered in bivariate relationships. Drainage basin erosion rates are explained well by considering these environmental parameters (R 2 = 0. 60); mean basin slope is the most powerful regressor. Outcrop erosion rates are less well explained (R 2 = 0. 32), and no one parameter dominates. The variance of erosion rates is better explained when subpopulations of the global data are analyzed. While our compilation is global, the grouped spatial distribution of cosmogenic studies introduces a bias that will only be addressed by research in under-sampled regions...|$|E

There are, however, somepopulations that are exposed to waterborne asbestos concentrations over 10 x 106 fibers per liter caused by natural erosion, mine processing wastes, waste pile erosion, corrosion of asbestos cement pipe, or disintegration of asbestos tile roofs running into cisterns. The distribution of fiber sizes in the water is dependent on the source of the fibers. The average length of chrysotile fibers found in an asestos cement distribution system was 4 pm, while the average fiber length of chrysotile fibers contributed to a water supply by natural erosion was 1 gm. Fiber Concentrations in Water Drinking water is contaminated by asbestos fibers from pollution, <b>geologic</b> <b>erosion,</b> and the disintegration of asbestos cement pipe.

40|$|Rock {{fragments}} in the regolith are {{a persistent}} property {{that reflects the}} combined influences of <b>geologic</b> controls, <b>erosion,</b> deposition, bioturbation, and weathering. The distribution of rock fragments in regoliths of the Ouachita Mountains, Arkansas, shows that sandstone fragments are common in all layers, even if sandstone is absent in parent material. Shale and sandstone fragments are produced at the bedrock weathering front, but the shale weathers rapidly and intact fragments are rare in the solum. Sandstone is weathered from ridgetop outcrops and transported downslope. Some of these fragments are moved downward, by faunalturbation and by transport into pits associated with rotting tree stumps. Upward movement by treethrow is common, resulting in a net concentration of rocks near the surface. However, the highest fragment concentrations are in the lower regolith, indicating active production at the weathering front. The regolith is a dynamic feature, reflecting the influences of vertical and horizontal processes, of active weathering at the bedrock interface, and of surficial sediment movements. The role of trees in redistributing rock fragments suggests that significant regolith mixing occurs over time scales associated with forest vegetation communities, and that forest soils have likely been extensively mixed within Holocene an...|$|R

40|$|Southern {{forests are}} {{expected}} to supply {{a large portion of}} the Nation's future timber requirement. Projected demands on southern forests continue to exceed allowable cut. As an outgrowth of this demand, intensive management of pine forests enabled the South to produce 45 percent of the Nation's timber harvest in 1970 (USDA, Forest Service, 1973). The Southern Forest Resource Analysis Committee (1969) stated that, if projected timber needs of the year 2000 are to be met, at least ten million acres of bare or poorly stocked land must be planted with pine by 1985 and another twenty million acres converted from low-grade hardwoods to pine. The challenge facing forestry in the South is how to meet this increased demand and maintain an acceptable forest environment in the face of increased taxes, rising labor and equipment costs and predicted petroleum shortages. Undisturbed forests are generally recognized as primary sources of high quality water. Although the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 (Public Law No. 92 - 500) make pollution from forest practices increasingly more important, the effects of these practices on water quality are not known for East Texas. The quality of streamflow from forested watersheds fluctuates constantly in response to natural stress, and can be influenced greatly by man's activities. Forest management practices can potentially influence the following water quality parameters: (1) sediment, (2) nutrients, (3) temperature, (4) dissolved oxygen/organic matter, and (5) introduced chemicals. It must be realized from the onset that sediment due to <b>geologic</b> <b>erosion</b> is a natural component of fresh water streams and that high concentrations may have occurred naturally for short periods due to perturbations in the ecosystem such as wildfires. Sediment is not necessarily a pollutant and only becomes one when it can be demonstrated that it is exceeding natural levels and is interfering with the beneficial use of water. A certain amount of sediment and nutrients are needed in Gulf Bays and Estuaries to maintain their productivity (Mathewson and Minter, 1976; Diener, 1964; Ketchum, 1967). Texas does not have a stream water quality standard for sediment and due to the complexities involved will probably not develop one. Thus, sediment as used in this report, becomes important: (1) as a carrier of plant nutrients and forest chemicals, and (2) in that practices which reduce sediment loss will usually reduce nutrient, organic matter and introduced chemical losses and prevent water temperature increases, as well. This report is the result of an interagency contract between Texas Department of Water Resources, Texas Agricultural Experiment Station and Texas Water Resources Institute to: (1) develop an overview of commercial forests and forestry operations in Texas, (2) identify, describe and characterize control strategies for nonpoint sources of pollution from silvicultural activities, and (3) develop and demonstrate a methodology for selecting control strategies in given problem situations. The following topics are covered: (1) an overview of forestry in East Texas, (2) silvicultural practices and nonpoint sources of pollution, (3) control strategies, (4) methodology for the selection of control strategies, (5) institutional aspects of controlling silvicultural nonpoint source pollution, (6) ongoing research and research needs, and (7) hydrology of East Texas. It is important to recognize that this report does not specify that nonpoint pollution from forestlands in East Texas is a problem. Likewise, the report does not set pollution control goals or criteria that should be met by a control plan, since this is the responsibility of the State. In areas where a potential nonpoint pollution problem exists; the suggested control strategies should be useful in selecting control measures that are appropriate to the special conditions imposed by differences in climate, soil, topography, and forest practice...|$|E

40|$|A {{stability}} {{model of}} drainage basin mass balance {{is used to}} interpret historic and prehistoric patterns of sediment production, storage and output from theWaipaoa River basin, NewZealand and assess the sensitivity of basin sediment yield to land use change in the historic period. Climate and vegetation cover changed during the late Holocene, but the drainage basin mass balance systemwas stable before the basin was deforested by European colonists in the late 19 th and early 20 th centuries. In this meso-scale dispersal system sediment sources and sinks are closely linked, and before that time there was also little variability {{in the rate of}} terrigenous mass accumulation on the adjacent continental shelf. However, despite strong ¢rst-order <b>geologic</b> controls on <b>erosion</b> and extensive alluvial storage, sediment delivery to the continental shelf is sensitive and highly responsive to historic hillslope destabilization driven by land use change. Alluvial bu¡ering can mask the e¡ects of variations in sediment productionwithin a basin on sedimentyield at the outlet, but this is most likely to occur in basins where alluvial storage is large relative to yield andwhere the residence time of alluvial sediment is long relative to the time scale of environmental change. At present, neither situation applies to theWaipaoa River basin. Thus, the strength of the contemporary depositional signal may not only be due to the intensity of the erosion processes involved, but also to the fact that land use change in the historic period destabilized the drainage basin mass balance system...|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Erosion by water is a serious problem threatening the sustainability of steep land agricultural production throughout the tropics. The El Pital watershed is typical of the many regions within Nicaragua where the effects of erosion are increasingly evident. Analysis of aerial photographs taken in 1968 and 1987, and comparing them with conditions in 1996, indicates that erosion has increased throughout this period and is substantially above the expected <b>geologic</b> "natural" <b>erosion</b> rate for the area. This trend is associated with increased fragmentation of farms associated with the agrarian reform activities of the 1980 's, during which many of the large land-holdings were confiscated and redistributed to many peasant families. Also the increasing population and inheritance customs have contributed to the proliferation of smaller fanning units. Small farming units (< 4 ha) are linked to increased erosion because small farms tend to emphasize production of annual crops necessary to meet the subsistence needs of the farm family. Annual crop production is a land use that has a high erosion risk because the soil is more exposed to raindrop impact and there is less vegetative obstruction to overland flow than if the land use was forest, range, or a perennial crop with high cover characteristics, such as coffee. The trend within the watershed toward increased emphasis on annual crop production is greatest on the steep lands where the erosion risk is naturally high. The increase of small farms on the steep land is a function of political and economic considerations, which make these lands most available for settlement. Most of the institutions working in the watershed to encourage soil conservation have targeted the beneficiaries of agrarian reform. The result has been greater on these farms than on the lands that were traditionally privately owned. This illustrates that extension activities do make a significant difference in adoption of soil conservation practices. Because the trend within the watershed is toward an increase in small farms, and because the trend on small farms is to select crops with a high erosion risk, {{there is a need to}} design and implement programs that enhance adoption of soil conservation technologies by these small farmers...|$|R

O presente estudo focaliza a área de Geologia, na qual a pesquisa revelou existirem poucos relatos de experiências dessa natureza. Esse quadro incentivou o desenvolvimento e uso de jogos neste campo. A proposta de jogo Ciclo das Rochas comprova o valor positivo da utilização de jogos didáticos no ensino-aprendizagem de Ciências da Terra. Além da inserção de propriedades do lúdico como prazer, divertimento e autonomia sobre seus atos, os jogos com finalidade didático-pedagógica promovem a construção do conhecimento ao conectar vários aspectos do processo de aprendizagem, como cognição, afeição, socialização e criatividade. Com o objetivo de desenvolver um jogo didático-geológico capaz de apoiar a aplicação, o desenvolvimento e a difusão de conceitos e raciocínios típicos das Geociências ou, mais especificamente, da Geologia, optou-se por elaborar uma estrutura de jogo contendo dois níveis de dificuldade (1 e 2) e direcionados para alunos de ensino {{superior}} em disciplinas de geologia introdutória. Após alguns estudos preliminares, foi delineado e proposto um problema prático, que consiste em construir modelo representativo do Ciclo das Rochas. Para resolução, os participantes formam grupos pequenos e trabalham cooperativa e competitivamente. O jogo envolve os seguintes elementos: um tabuleiro, cartas geológicas, cartas-dicas e um dado comum de seis faces, que podem ser facilmente obtidos e confeccionados com materiais simples. Isso permite ao professor levar o jogo pronto para aplicação no ambiente escolar ou orientar a elaboração do jogo, em etapas sucessivas, pelos próprios alunos, de acordo com o tempo disponível, objetivos e grau de dificuldade. As cartas geológicas contêm informações necessárias para os jogadores completarem o tabuleiro, divididas nas categorias de cartas de processos (vermelhas) e cartas de produtos (azuis). As primeiras incluem os principais processos geológicos do ciclo (intemperismo, erosão etc.), enquanto as segundas descrevem produtos, como p. ex. sedimentos, magma e tipos de rocha. A complexidade no uso de termos é variável, dependendo do nível de escolaridade e familiaridade do participante com conceitos de Geologia. Essa propriedade do jogo proposto ajuda o professor a adequar o jogo de acordo com suas necessidades. A utilização prática revelou que a alternativa excede o papel de mero objeto de entretenimento, sendo instrumento de apoio ao ensino, porque ajuda a disseminar termos e conceitos relacionados ao tema. It {{is relatively}} easy to find educational games and toys and also papers that report their use for teaching of different disciplines, specially on Mathematics. By the other hand, there are scarce similar experiences in the scientific branch of Geology. This situation has encouraged research on geological games. The Rock Cycle game is a proposal to stimulate geosciences teaching by means of a simple board-and-playingcards structure, which can be easily obtained and made with simple materials. The geologic game is capable to support the application, development and diffusion of concepts and some typical reasonings of the Geosciences and, or, more specifically, Geology. After some preliminary studies, is was designed and proposed a practical problem, which is to build a representative model of the rock cycle in Nature. Beyond the inclusion of properties such as pleasure, fun and autonomy, games dedicated to teaching-learning purposes promote the construction of knowledge allowing one to connect various didactic-pedagogic aspects, such as cognition, affection, entertainment and creativity. To play the game, the participants form small groups that cooperate and/or compete towards resolution of the problem. The playing cards yield information the players need to complete a diagram of the complete cycle. There are two categories of cards: cards of processes (red) and cards of products (blue). The first group describes the main <b>geologic</b> processes (weathering, <b>erosion</b> etc.), while the second ones describe products (different rock types, sediments etc.). There are also hint-cards including a few relevant information useful {{to solve the problem of}} positioning a given card on the board. Two models of boards (diagram structures) have been developed, adjusted to different levels of difficulty: basic and advanced. The basic-level board model is composed by a diagram of the rock cycle, ornamented with boxes that should be completed out by the players. In the advanced-level board model a similar network of boxes is presented, but the underlying diagram is absent, as to increase the degree of complexity. The choice between a higher or a lower degree of complexity depends on the school level at which the game is applied, as well as the familiarity of the participants with concepts of Geology. The game and the practical tests suggest the use of games to be highly positive for teaching-learning. The proposed game largely exceeds the typical functions of a mere entertainment object; it may help teachers to adjust the game to their needs. It can be an effective education tool, as long as the Rock Cycle game helps to popularize new theoretical concepts related to the subject...|$|R
40|$|The ceramic objects I create {{possess a}} {{particular}} buoyant volume and subtle organic surface variation that enable each piece to stand-alone and yet to allure the viewer in for closer examination. A particular articulation of each form creates an aesthetic {{that allows the}} object to occupy a space {{in such a way}} that evokes a sense of balance and harmony with a minimal domestic setting. Interests in historical forms that possess a full sense of volume provide a framework me to explore proportion, line, edge, silhouette, and transitions. I pare down these qualities to their true essence while still evoking a historical familiarity. The form and surface of each vessel provides ample opportunity for me to express my interest in elements of the natural world that bring about a sense of calm and inquisition of process. I am drawn to ways in which geological forms are manipulated by external forces in nature and the history that can be unveiled through the result of that weathering. Each piece serves a utilitarian purpose as a vessel for serving, storing, or displaying and also possesses characteristics that enable it to stand alone as an individual and have its own quiet, yet confident presence. I am drawn to the striking contrast presented by a balancing boulder or bale of hay in an open field. These objects positioned in relation to their surroundings occupy a vast space. I think about a similar placement of objects when I am considering how each vessel poises itself in a domestic landscape. The minimal quality of the forms enables them to integrate into a space, to complement the room, and yet the command recognition. A vase, decanter, pitcher, or bowl contains volume when displayed and also contain food for utility. These utilitarian objects serve to contain liquid or food, but also serve to contain and express the idea of volume. An examination of objects used by past cultures has informed the ways in which I consider precise details in my work. My understanding of formal elements has been greatly enhanced by my inquiry of specific Korean, Chinese and Native American wares. There is a historical familiarity embedded in each piece that is far removed from its original context. I remove sundry elements from the original historical forms that I find detract from their true essence. The result is an object that possesses a minimal quality which emphasis balance and volume. I give my work careful consideration; the wheelthrown forms are taut but not restricted. Each form has a sense of inflation in which proportion is emphasized and there is an uninterrupted line from the base to the upper edge. Particular attention is given to the silhouette of the object, the angle at which it meets a surface, symmetry, and the curvilinear line that flows from the table to the top edge of each object. Lines and patterns accentuate form and further emphasize a feeling of inflation and expansion coming out from within. Surface variation and color are subtle and complex, drawing a viewer in from a distance and prompting discovery of depth upon closer examination. The complementary nature of the studio and the natural world drives an evolving aesthetic and frequently challenges me to think about my work in new ways. This conscious awareness and examination of formal elements and spatial relationships in my immediate environment, and in the larger milieu of utilitarian form, drives the development of my work and my studio practice. There is an integration of natural lines that are organic and responsive into my work. I am particularly interested in the ways in which lines interact with landscape in natural ways. Tilled rows on farmed land meander around hills, lakes, and tree lines and accentuate the topography of the land. The erosion of rock highlights the path of wind and water to create countless formations and patterns. This movement that is created in and around rocks and dirt naturally accentuates areas and highlights curves and edges in the same ways that I use surface to bring attention to the volume and topography of an object. I enjoy the ways that these lines convey the underlying form of the landscape and inner structure of <b>geologic</b> formations through <b>erosion.</b> In a similar way, I integrate surface into the internal structure of each piece I create. In translating this organic line quality into my work, I accentuate the form of each piece by carving or painting the surface. Lines flow around bulbous areas where the volume of the pot is most prominent and congregate in areas where edges meet, much like water flowing in and around rocks during its decent downward. My studio practice is influenced by my experimentation with firing processes and materials. I have developed a particular method of firing that enhances each vessel’s volume. By placing a raw, unglazed pot in a particular location of the kiln, the flame’s current wraps around the vessel and leaves its trace upon the surface, accentuating its volume. Certain choices of clay body, and careful control of atmosphere create a harmony within the kiln in which a range of dark muted hues of gray, navy, and maroon are created, paired with highlighted moments of warm colors. The wall hanging pieces entitled Flow I, Flow II, and Flow III presents the range of color that is achieved through the use of different materials and firing techniques. Surfaces are captured that are reminiscent in color and variation to natural landscapes that I have encountered which possess a quiet energy. Plates and platters that are hung on the wall speak to a duality of function and display. These forms may be used to serve or observe. The manner in which I view the world around me and study the history of ceramics contribute to an evolving aesthetic in which I respond to my interests and environment through the pots I make. I find it deeply satisfying to live a life in which there is a reciprocal relationship between what I make and how I observe the world around me. Advisor: Peter Pinnel...|$|R
