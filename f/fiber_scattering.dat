40|$|The current fluoroindate glass {{optical fiber}} loss is {{dominated}} by extrinsic absorption and scattering loss. Attempts were made to reduce fluoroindate glass fiber loss by optimizing glass melting conditions, preform extrusion process and fiber drawing conditions. Our results show that fluorination of the glass batches (with 99. 99 % InF 3) at 450 °C by addition of ammonium bifluoride reduced un-dissolved particles (potential scattering losses) in the glass. Glass flow analysis was carried out to provide insights into the glass temperature-viscosity behavior {{and the relationship between}} preform surface roughness and extrusion temperature, which enabled fabrication of preforms with low surface roughnesses and eventually reduced the <b>fiber</b> <b>scattering</b> loss. Fiber surface crystallization was reduced via conducting chemical etching and polishing (with colloidal silica) on both glass billets and preforms, extending the heating zone for fiber drawing, and applying additional weight at the bottom of preforms. As a consequence, the fiber surface roughness decreased, resulting in decreased <b>fiber</b> <b>scattering</b> loss and enhanced fiber strength. Jiafang Bei, Tanya M.

It {{is based on}} the pump and probe technique with the specificity to use a single laser source together with an external modulator to generate the interacting lightwaves.

5000|$|Areolar tissue ( [...] or [...] ) is {{a common}} type of loose {{connective}} tissue (and the most widely distributed type of connective tissue in vertebrates). It is so named because its fibers are far enough apart to leave ample open space for interstitial fluid in between ( [...] is Latin for a [...] "little open space"). It {{is strong enough to}} bind different tissue types together, yet soft enough to provide flexibility and cushioning. It exhibits interlacing, loosely organized fibers, abundant blood vessels, and significant empty space filled with interstitial fluid. Many adjacent epithelial tissues (which are avascular) get their nutrients from the interstitial fluid of areolar tissue; the lamina propria is areolar in many body locations. Its fibers run in random directions and are mostly collagenous, but elastic and reticular fibers are also present. Areolar tissue is highly variable in appearance. In many serous membranes, it appears as a loose arrangement of collagenous and elastic <b>fibers,</b> <b>scattered</b> cells of various types; abundant ground substance; numerous blood vessels.

40|$|We {{examined}} the synchrotron small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) from three azobenzene-appended cholesterol organogels: an ionic gel, a nonionic gel and {{a mixture of}} them. The main {{purpose of the present}} study is to find a possible correlation between the gel stability and the aggregation structure using SAXS. A typical crystalline scattering is observed for the nonionic gel at room temperature. The ionic one gives scattering from an amorphous fiber that coexists with a small amount of crystals. On the other hand, the mixture of gels shows scattering from a completely amorphous fiber. These characteristic features from the fibril structures disappear upon heating (i. e., at the gel-sol transition) for all the samples, confirming that the presence of the fibril structure is essential for the gel state.

40|$|Abstract — Photo {{realistic}} {{visualization of}} {{a huge number of}} individual filaments like in the case of hair, fur or knitwear, is a challenging task: Explicit rendering approaches for simulating radiance transfer at a filament get totally impracticable with respect to rendering performance, and it is also not obvious how to derive efficient scattering functions for different levels of (geometric) abstraction or how to deal with very complex scattering mechanisms. We present a novel uniform formalism for light scattering from filaments in terms of radiance, which we call Bidirectional <b>Fiber</b> <b>Scattering</b> Distribution Function (BFSDF). We show that previous specialized approaches, which have been developed in the context of hair rendering, can be seen as instances of the BFSDF. Similar {{to the role of the}} BSSRDF for surface scattering functions, the BFSDF can be seen as a general approach for light scattering from filaments which is suitable for deriving approximations in a canonic and systematic way. For the frequent cases of distant light sources and observers we deduce an efficient far field approximation (Bidirectional Curve Scattering Distribution Function, BCSDF). We show that on the basis of the BFSDF parameters for common rendering techniques can be estimated in a non ad-hoc, but physically based way...|$|E

We derive new non-separable fiber-scattering lobes that exhibit this and additional behaviours seen in ground-truth simulation of rough dielectric <b>fiber</b> <b>scattering.</b> Parameter tweaking of previous models can produce results similar to (d), but no previous model with fixed settings can simultaneously produce both (b) and (d). We found that ground-truth renders using explicit cylindrical geometry with Cook Torrance reflectance to be indistinguishable from (b) and (d) (upon convergence, which required significantly more samples per pixel). The {{difference between the}} old and new models is further illustrated in (e) by visualizing the R lobe of a circular fiber with Beckmann micro roughness and tilted scales (black hair). In the backlit case (c,d) light grazes the edges of fibers and exhibits the brighter more focused response (seen in (e) where the lobe compresses and brightens for high |φ |).

Visual inspection of the chord distribution functions CDFs guides to {{a model for the}} fitting of the longitudinal projection of the <b>fiber</b> <b>scattering.</b> This model comprises two components isolated hard domains solos and hard domains which are arranged with respect to a next neighbor duos. Aging increases the average size of the hard domains HD 0 d 5, 15 d 8, 36 d 7 nm and the average distance between them 0 d 3, 15 d 6, 36 d 9 nm. It decreases the volume fraction of HD considerably. The probable mechanism is selective degradation of the smaller hard domains. With increasing strain the relative loss of HD is the same for all samples. Aging softens the HDs. Softened HDs lengthen when the sample is stretched. They are destroyed before the rigid ones. HD lengthening is identical for sample 15 d and 36 d. Only with the aged materials small strain causes HDs to migrate from the random to the arranged component and back at higher strain. Sample 36 d breaks at strain 1. 5, whereas sample 15 d resists.
