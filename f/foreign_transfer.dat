40|$|Abstract: This paper {{introduces}} a system-wide spatial impact analysis of two modes of financing of land transport infrastructure in the Philippines with opposite reallocative effects – (1) <b>foreign</b> <b>transfers</b> as in {{official development assistance}} funds and (2) value-added tax on transport services. These two financing modes are alternatively used to finance {{an equal amount of}} land transport infrastructure improvement across five different Philippine regions. The effect of each financing scheme will be analyzed per regional transport mode, per regional production sector; and per regional household income group. A spatial computable general equilibrium model is used to estimate the values of production and welfare after an exogenous financing shock is introduced. Results show that value-added tax has slightly greater impact on regional output and regional welfare than <b>foreign</b> <b>transfers...</b>|$|R

40|$|Through an industry-level {{analysis}} of Chinese large- and medium-size manufacturing enterprises {{over the period}} of 1996 - 2001, this article investigates the direct and interactive contributions of four technology acquisition channels to industry performances in terms of innovation performance and productivity. These channels include in-house R&D, <b>foreign</b> technology <b>transfer,</b> domestic technology transfer, and inter-industry R&D spillover. We have found evidence of an important role of inter-industry R&D spillover in shaping and improving industry performance in China, which has been neglected by previous empirical studies concerned with Chinese industrial firms. The empirical results indicate that inter-industry R&D spillover and <b>foreign</b> technology <b>transfer</b> make significant contributions to both labour productivity {{and the level of}} total factor productivity in Chinese manufacturing industries. We have also found that in-house R&D and inter-industry R&D spillover share a complementary relationship in shaping innovation performance and total factor productivity in Chinese industry, and that in-house R&D relates to <b>foreign</b> technology <b>transfer</b> as a complement for labour productivity. Finally, on the mixed results among existing literature in the context of developing countries, this article argues that the commonly followed strategy in technology development, combined with government regulations, will play an essential role in determining the relationship between in-house R&D and <b>foreign</b> technology <b>transfer.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|The authors {{analyze the}} impact of three classes of {{external}} shocks in open economies, using a rational expectations framework that nests three prototype economies: a neoclassical full-employment benchmark, with intertemporally optimizing consumers and firms an instant clearing of asset, goods, and factor markets; a full-employment case with partly liquidity-constrained consumers and investors; and a Keynesian economy, with liquidity constraints and wage rigidity, which results in transitory deviations from full employment. Using parameters for a representative open economy, they simulate the model to compare the dynamic effects of <b>foreign</b> <b>transfers,</b> a terms-of-trade windfall {{in the form of}} a lower price for an imported production input, and a decline in the foreign real interest rate. They contrast the role of Keynesian and neoclassical factors in determining the dynamic adjustment to shocks, by analyzing the effects of permanent/transitory and anticipated/unanticipated disturbances in the three prototype economies. The results illustrate three main points: (a) both permanent and transitory disturbances cause changes in long-run capacity and output; (b) transitory and permanent shocks may have opposite effects on the current account. In particular, a permanent increase in <b>foreign</b> <b>transfers</b> or a permanent terms-of-trade windfall result in a current account deficit; if temporary, they cause a surplus; and (c) liquidity constraints and wage rigidities tend to amplify the cyclical adjustment to external shocks.

40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to explore the}} correlation between foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows and <b>foreign</b> knowledge <b>transfer</b> in China. More specifically, the study empirically investigates the feedback effect of <b>foreign</b> knowledge <b>transfer</b> from multinational corporations (MNCs) on FDI in the Chinese context. Also, the relationship between international knowledge transfer through FDI and indigenous firms' innovation is examined. Furthermore, in order {{to fill the gap}} in the literature, the study probes the impacts of WTO accession on FDI inflows to China and on domestic innovation development. Using different methodologies, this paper conducts a longitudinal study based on a unique, country-level dataset (patent data) from China. The empirical evidence supports the view of FDI as a vehicle of foreign advanced technology inflowing to China. The more technologies transferred to China, the more investments MNCs make, which spurs the domestic firms to promote their own R&D activities. Accordingly, the improvement of domestic innovative capacity will attract more advanced technology and FDI inflows to China. Also, the WTO accession seems to have had positive effects on drawing FDI inflows and <b>foreign</b> knowledge <b>transfer</b> to China...|$|R

50|$|Although {{there was}} some {{variation}} in the GUPPY conversion programs, generally the original two Sargo batteries were replaced by four more compact Guppy (GUPPY I and II only) or Sargo II batteries via significant re-utilization of below-deck space, usually including removal of auxiliary diesels. All of these battery designs were of the lead-acid type. This increased {{the total number of}} battery cells from 252 to 504; the downside was the compact batteries had to be replaced every 18 months instead of every 5 years. The Sargo II battery was developed as a lower-cost alternative to the expensive Guppy battery. All GUPPYs received a snorkel, with a streamlined sail and bow. Also, the electric motors were upgraded to the direct drive double-armature type, along with modernized electrical and air conditioning systems. All except the austere GUPPY IB conversions for <b>foreign</b> <b>transfer</b> received sonar, fire control, and Electronic Support Measures (ESM) upgrades.|$|E

Large <b>foreign</b> capital <b>transfers</b> permit over-valued ex-change rates to develop or continue, and these penalize agriculture by reducing the incentives to export and by increasing the incen-tives to import.
