5|$|Based on the {{findings}} of these and other studies in the early 1970s, the current consensus is that the use of methoxyflurane should be restricted only to healthy individuals, in situations where it offers specific advantages and even then, only at dosages less than 2.5MAC hours. Partly because of these warnings, but also because of the development of newer volatile anesthetics such as enflurane, isoflurane, <b>desflurane</b> and sevoflurane, the clinical use of methoxyflurane as a general anesthetic in humans was largely abandoned in the mid-1970s.|$|E
5|$|Tracheal tubes {{can be used}} {{to ensure}} the {{adequate}} exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide, to deliver oxygen in higher concentrations than found in air, or to administer other gases such as helium, nitric oxide, nitrous oxide, xenon, or certain volatile anesthetic agents such as <b>desflurane,</b> isoflurane, or sevoflurane. They may also be used as a route for administration of certain medications such as bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids, and drugs used in treating cardiac arrest such as atropine, epinephrine, lidocaine and vasopressin.|$|E
25|$|Nitrous oxide is a weak general anaesthetic, {{and so is}} {{generally}} not used alone in general anaesthesia, but used as a carrier gas (mixed with oxygen) for more powerful general anaesthetic drugs such as sevoflurane or <b>desflurane.</b> It has a minimum alveolar concentration of 105% and a blood/gas partition coefficient of 0.46. The use of nitrous oxide in anaesthesia, however, can {{increase the risk of}} postoperative nausea and vomiting.|$|E
25|$|An inhalational {{anaesthetic}} is {{a chemical}} compound possessing general anaesthetic properties {{that can be}} delivered via inhalation. They are administered by anaesthetists (a term which includes anaesthesiologists, nurse anaesthetists, and anaesthesiologist assistants) through an anaesthesia mask, laryngeal mask airway or tracheal tube connected to an anaesthetic vaporiser and an anaesthetic delivery system. Agents of significant contemporary clinical interest include volatile anaesthetic agents such as isoflurane, sevoflurane and <b>desflurane,</b> and anaesthetic gases such as nitrous oxide and xenon.|$|E
25|$|Malignant {{hyperthermia}} is {{a disorder}} {{that can be}} considered a gene-environment interaction. In most people with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility, they have few or no symptoms unless they are exposed to a triggering agent. The most common triggering agents are volatile anesthetic gases, such as halothane, sevoflurane, <b>desflurane,</b> isoflurane, enflurane or the depolarizing muscle relaxants suxamethonium and decamethonium used primarily in general anesthesia. In rare cases, the biological stresses of physical exercise or heat may be the trigger.|$|E
25|$|A {{large number}} of {{pharmaceuticals}} contain halogens, especially fluorine. An estimated one fifth of pharmaceuticals contain fluorine, including several {{of the most widely}} used drugs. Examples include 5-fluorouracil, fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), ciprofloxacin (Cipro), mefloquine, and fluconazole. The beneficial effects arise because the C-F bond is relatively unreactive. Fluorine-substituted ethers are volatile anesthetics, including the commercial products methoxyflurane, enflurane, isoflurane, sevoflurane and <b>desflurane.</b> Fluorocarbon anesthetics reduce the hazard of flammability with diethyl ether and cyclopropane. Perfluorinated alkanes are used as blood substitutes.|$|E
500|$|Tricyclics {{and other}} pre-1980s {{antidepressants}} had several side effects {{due to their}} non-selective interference with neurotransmitters other than the serotonin target; the fluorinated fluoxetine was selective {{and one of the}} first to avoid this problem. Many current antidepressants receive this same treatment, including the [...] citalopram, its isomer escitalopram, and fluvoxamine and paroxetine. Quinolones are artificial broad-spectrum antibiotics that are often fluorinated to enhance their effects. These include ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin. Fluorine also finds use in steroids: fludrocortisone is a blood pressure-raising mineralocorticoid, and triamcinolone and dexamethasone are strong glucocorticoids. The majority of inhaled anesthetics are heavily fluorinated; the prototype halothane is much more inert and potent than its contemporaries. Later compounds such as the fluorinated ethers sevoflurane and <b>desflurane</b> are better than halothane and are almost insoluble in blood, allowing faster waking times.|$|E
2500|$|The carbon-fluorine bond is {{commonly}} found in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals because it is generally metabolically stable and fluorine acts as a bioisostere of the hydrogen atom. [...] An estimated one fifth of pharmaceuticals contain fluorine, including several of the top drugs. Examples include 5-fluorouracil, flunitrazepam (Rohypnol), fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), ciprofloxacin (Cipro), mefloquine, and fluconazole. [...] Fluorine-substituted ethers are volatile anesthetics, including the commercial products methoxyflurane, enflurane, isoflurane, sevoflurane and <b>desflurane.</b> Fluorocarbon anesthetics reduce the hazard of flammability with diethyl ether and cyclopropane. [...] Perfluorinated alkanes are used as blood substitutes.|$|E
2500|$|General {{anesthesia}} {{is commonly}} used in animals for major surgery. Animals are often premedicated intravenously or intramuscularly with a sedative, analgesic, and anticholinergic agent (dogs frequently receive buprenorphine, acepromazine, and glycopyrrolate). The next step is induction, usually with an intravenous drug. [...] Dogs and cats commonly receive thiopental (no longer allowed in the UK), ketamine with diazepam, tiletamine with zolazepam (usually just in cats), and/or propofol. Alfaxalone is a steroid anaesthetic used in many practices in the UK to induce anaesthesia in cats and sometimes dogs. It is similar in physiological effect but different in composition to the now withdrawn Saffan. [...] Horses commonly receive thiopental and guaifenesin. [...] Following induction, the animal is intubated with an endotracheal tube and maintained on a gas anesthetic. [...] The most common gas anesthetics in use in veterinary medicine are isoflurane, enflurane, and halothane, although <b>desflurane</b> and sevoflurane are becoming more popular due to rapid induction and recovery.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{anesthetic}} agents used {{in human}} medicine {{are used in}} veterinary medicine. [...] Alpha-2 receptor agonist drugs such as xylazine, romifidine, detomidine, and medetomidine, are used frequently in veterinary species (particularly large animal), but are rarely used in people. [...] Guaifenesin {{is used as a}} muscle relaxant prior to anesthesia induction in some animals. [...] Propofol is commonly used in small animal anesthesia, however it is rarely used in large animals due to the cost. 'Propoclear' is also commonly used in smaller branches of small animal surgery as it has a longer shelf life once opened than propofol whilst essentially having the same properties. [...] Butorphanol is rarely used in people but is commonly used in all species. [...] Ketamine, used in children for anesthesia, is used extensively in many species to induce anesthesia or cause heavy sedation. [...] Expensive agents, such as etomidate and <b>desflurane</b> are rarely used outside of university hospitals. [...] Different species have different responses to drugs. [...] For example, horses may experience mania with morphine whereas dogs typically become sedated. [...] Rabbits and guinea pigs are well sedated with midazolam, which can occasionally excite dogs and cats.|$|E
50|$|The third {{category}} of vaporizer (the dual-circuit gas-vapour blender) was created {{specifically for the}} agent <b>desflurane.</b> <b>Desflurane</b> boils at 23.5 Â°C, which {{is very close to}} room temperature. This means that at normal operating temperatures, the saturated vapor pressure of <b>desflurane</b> changes greatly with only small fluctuations in temperature. This means that the features of a normal plenum vaporizer are not sufficient to ensure an accurate concentration of <b>desflurane.</b> Additionally, on a very warm day, all the <b>desflurane</b> would boil, and very high (potentially lethal) concentrations of <b>desflurane</b> might reach the patient.|$|E
50|$|The {{expense and}} {{complexity}} of the <b>desflurane</b> vaporizer have contributed to the relative lack of popularity of <b>desflurane,</b> although in recent years it is gaining in popularity.|$|E
50|$|Some {{drawbacks}} of <b>desflurane</b> are its low potency, its pungency and {{its high}} cost (though at low flow fresh gas rates, the cost difference between <b>desflurane</b> and isoflurane {{appears to be}} insignificant. It may cause tachycardia and airway irritability when administered at concentrations greater than 10 vol%. Due to this airway irritability, <b>desflurane</b> is infrequently used to induce anesthesia via inhalation techniques.|$|E

50|$|A {{warm-up period}} is {{required}} after switching on. The <b>desflurane</b> vaporizer will fail if mains power is lost. Alarms sound if the vaporizer is nearly empty. An electronic display indicates {{the level of}} <b>desflurane</b> in the vaporizer.|$|E
50|$|A <b>desflurane</b> {{vaporizer}} (e.g. the TEC 6 {{produced by}} Datex-Ohmeda) is heated to 39C and pressurised to 200kPa (and therefore requires electrical power). It {{is mounted on}} the anaesthetic machine {{in the same way}} as a plenum vaporizer, but its function is quite different. It evaporates a chamber containing <b>desflurane</b> using heat, and injects small amounts of pure <b>desflurane</b> vapor into the fresh gas flow. A transducer senses the fresh gas flow.|$|E
50|$|<b>Desflurane</b> is a {{greenhouse}} gas. The twenty-year global-warming potential, GWP(20), for <b>desflurane</b> is 3714, meaning that one tonne of <b>desflurane</b> emitted {{is equivalent to}} 3714 tonnes of {{carbon dioxide in the}} atmosphere, much higher than sevoflurane or isoflurane. In addition to global warming potentials, drug potency and fresh gas flow rates must be considered for meaningful comparisons between anesthetic gases. When a steady state hourly amount of anesthetic necessary for 1 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) at 2 liters per minute (LPM) for Sevoflurane, and 1 LPM for <b>Desflurane</b> and Isoflurane is weighted by the GWP, the clinically relevant quantities of each anesthetic can then be compared. On a per-MAC-hour basis, the total life cycle GHG impact of <b>desflurane</b> is more than 20 times higher than Isoflurane and Sevoflurane (1 minimal alveolar concentration-hour). One paper finds anesthesia gases used globally contribute the equivalent of 1 million cars to global warming. This estimate is commonly cited as a reason to neglect pollution prevention by anesthesiologists, however this is problematic. This estimate is extrapolated from only one U.S. institutionâs anesthetic practices, and this institution uses virtually no <b>Desflurane.</b> Researchers neglected to include nitrous oxide in their calculations, and reported an erroneous average of 17 kg CO2e per anesthetic. However, institutions that utilize some <b>Desflurane</b> and account for nitrous oxide have reported an average of 175-220 kg CO2e per anesthetic. Sulbaek-Andersonâs group therefore likely underestimated the total worldwide contribution of inhaled anesthetics, and yet still advocates for inhaled anesthetic emissions prevention.|$|E

50|$|A 2014 {{clinical}} {{study found that}} <b>desflurane</b> has lower bispectral index and greater hypnotic effect than sevoflurane during the equipotent anesthesia.|$|E
50|$|Nitrous oxide, <b>desflurane,</b> and {{isoflurane}} {{are most}} {{the most commonly}} used anesthetic gases. They may cause some complications due to their leakage and storage failure.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Desflurane,</b> {{along with}} {{enflurane}} {{and to a}} lesser extent isoflurane, has been shown to react with the carbon dioxide absorbent in anesthesia circuits to produce detectable levels of carbon monoxide through degradation of the anesthetic agent. The [...] absorbent Baralyme, when dried, is most culpable for the production of carbon monoxide from <b>desflurane</b> degradation, although it is also seen with soda lime absorbent as well. Dry conditions in the carbon dioxide absorbent are conducive to this phenomenon, such as those resulting from high fresh gas flows.|$|E
50|$|There are {{generally}} {{two types of}} vaporizers: plenum and drawover. Both have distinct advantages and disadvantages. The dual-circuit gas-vapour blender is a third type of vaporizer used exclusively for the agent <b>desflurane.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Desflurane</b> {{is known}} {{to act as a}} {{positive}} allosteric modulator of the GABAA and glycine receptors, and as a negative allosteric modulator of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, as well as affecting other ligand-gated ion channels.|$|E
50|$|Sevoflurane (1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-(fluoromethoxy)propane; synonym, {{fluoromethyl}} hexafluoro{{isopropyl ether}}), is a sweet-smelling, nonflammable, highly fluorinated methyl isopropyl ether {{used as an}} inhalational anaesthetic for induction and maintenance of general anesthesia. After <b>desflurane,</b> it is the volatile anesthetic with the fastest onset and offset.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} used volatile anesthetic agents, particularly for outpatient anesthesia, [...] across all ages, as well as in veterinary medicine. Together with <b>desflurane,</b> sevoflurane is replacing isoflurane and halothane in modern anesthesiology. It is often administered in a mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen.|$|E
50|$|As another example, in {{anesthesia}} (particularly IV anesthesia {{and general}} anesthesia) multiple agents {{are almost always}} required - including hypnotics or analgesic inducing/maintenance agents such as Versed or Diprivan, usually an opioid analgesic such as morphine or Demerol, a paralytic such as vecuronium, and in inhaled general anesthesia generally a halogenated ether anesthetic such as sevoflurane or <b>desflurane.</b>|$|E
50|$|Many {{compounds}} {{have been}} used for inhalation anaesthesia, but only a few are still in widespread use. <b>Desflurane,</b> isoflurane and sevoflurane are the most widely used volatile anaesthetics today. They are often combined with nitrous oxide. Older, less popular, volatile anaesthetics, include halothane, enflurane, and methoxyflurane. Researchers are also actively exploring the use of xenon as an anaesthetic.|$|E
50|$|Volatile {{agents are}} {{frequently}} compared {{in terms of}} potency, which is inversely proportional to the minimum alveolar concentration. Potency {{is directly related to}} lipid solubility. This is known as the Meyer-Overton hypothesis. However, certain pharmacokinetic properties of volatile agents have become another point of comparison. Most important of those properties is known as the blood/gas partition coefficient. This concept refers to the relative solubility of a given agent in blood. Those agents with a lower blood solubility (i.e., a lower blood-gas partition coefficient; e.g., <b>desflurane)</b> give the anesthesia provider greater rapidity in titrating the depth of anesthesia, and permit a more rapid emergence from the anesthetic state upon discontinuing their administration. In fact, newer volatile agents (e.g., sevoflurane, <b>desflurane)</b> have been popular not due to their potency (minimum alveolar concentration), but due to their versatility for a faster emergence from anesthesia, thanks to their lower blood-gas partition coefficient.|$|E
50|$|Several inhaled general {{anesthetic}} agents, {{including the}} most commonly used inhaled agents, also contain fluorine. The first fluorinated anesthetic agent, halothane, proved to be much safer (neither explosive nor flammable) and longer-lasting than those previously used. Modern fluorinated anesthetics are longer-lasting still and almost insoluble in blood, which accelerates the awakening. Examples include sevoflurane, <b>desflurane,</b> enflurane, and isoflurane, all hydrofluorocarbon derivatives.|$|E
5000|$|Molecular {{structures}} of general anaesthetics {{widely used in}} medicine are very simple and diverse {{so that there is}} no obvious structure-activity relationship (see {{structures of}} general anaesthetics widely used in medicine: 1 - ethanol, 2 - chloroform, 3 - diethyl ether, 4 - fluroxene, 5 - halothane, 6 - methoxyflurane, 7 - enflurane, 8 - isoflurane, 9 - <b>desflurane,</b> 10 - sevoflurane) ...|$|E
50|$|Though it vaporises very readily, it is {{a liquid}} at room temperature. Anaesthetic {{machines}} are {{fitted with a}} specialized anaesthetic vaporiser unit that heats liquid <b>desflurane</b> to a constant temperature. This enables the agent to be available at a constant vapor pressure, negating the effects fluctuating ambient temperatures would otherwise have on its concentration imparted into the fresh gas flow of the anesthesia machine.|$|E
50|$|Halogenated ethers {{have the}} {{advantages}} of being non-flammable as well as less toxic than earlier general anesthetics. Halogenated ethers differ from other ethers because they contain at least one halogen atom in each molecule. Examples of halogenated ethers include the general anesthetics isoflurane, <b>desflurane,</b> and sevoflurane. However, not all halogenated ethers have anesthetic effects, and some compounds such as flurothyl do the opposite and have stimulant and convulsant effects.|$|E
