5|$|After the battle, the {{captured}} German panzerarmee general Wilhelm Ritter von Thoma told Montgomery that he <b>had</b> <b>believed</b> the allies {{had at least}} one more armoured division than they did, and that the attack would be in the south. Rommel's stand-in, general Georg Stumme, thought the attack would not begin for several weeks. German documents and prisoners of war confirmed that the German commanders <b>had</b> <b>believed</b> in the existence of the decoy unit, and had not anticipated the true avenue of attack. Bertram had succeeded in all its objectives.|$|E

5|$|Despite this glowing message by the Emperor, Chan {{writes that}} a year later in 1446, the Ming court cut off all {{relations}} with the Karmapa hierarchs.

5|$|Phát {{and other}} pro-Diệm {{officers}} opposed the Buddhist influence being exerted on Khánh. Thảo consulted Kỳ—who wanted to seize power for himself—before the plot, and exhorted {{him to join}} the coup, but the air force chief claimed that he was remaining neutral. Thảo thus believed Kỳ would not intervene against him, but Kỳ was strongly opposed to Thảo and Phát. American intelligence analysts <b>had</b> <b>believed</b> that General Don {{was involved in the}} coup with Phát and Thảo, but this was proven false when the action started. Eight months after the coup was over, Don told the American historian George McTurnan Kahin that he had been plotting with Thảo, who had planned for him to become Defense Minister and Chief of Staff of the military, but that the Đại Việt and Thảo's Catholic civilian allies had insisted on installing Khiêm, a Catholic. A month before the coup, American intelligence analysts <b>had</b> <b>believed</b> that Thảo was planning to replace Khánh as commander-in-chief with Don.|$|E

5|$|Hayes courted {{his future}} wife, Lucy Webb, {{during his time}} there. His mother had {{encouraged}} him {{to get to know}} Lucy years earlier, but Hayes <b>had</b> <b>believed</b> she was too young and focused his attention on other women. Four years later, Hayes began {{to spend more time with}} Lucy. They became engaged in 1851 and married on December 30, 1852, at the house of Lucy's mother. Over the next five years, Lucy gave birth to three sons: Birchard Austin (1853), Webb Cook (1856), and Rutherford Platt (1858). Lucy, a Methodist, was a teetotaler and abolitionist. She influenced her husband's views on those issues, although he never formally joined her church.|$|E
5|$|His {{observations}} of the satellites of Jupiter caused a revolution in astronomy: a planet with smaller planets orbiting it did not conform {{to the principles of}} Aristotelian cosmology, which held that all heavenly bodies should circle the Earth, and many astronomers and philosophers initially refused to believe that Galileo could have discovered such a thing. His observations were confirmed by the observatory of Christopher Clavius and he received a hero's welcome when he visited Rome in 1611. Galileo continued to observe the satellites over the next eighteen months, and by mid-1611, he had obtained remarkably accurate estimates for their periods—a feat which Kepler <b>had</b> <b>believed</b> impossible.|$|E
5|$|In 1858, William Parker Foulke {{discovered}} {{the first known}} American dinosaur, in marl pits {{in the small town}} of Haddonfield, New Jersey. (Although fossils had been found before, their nature had not been correctly discerned.) The creature was named Hadrosaurus foulkii. It was an extremely important find: Hadrosaurus was one of the first nearly complete dinosaur skeletons found (the first was in 1834, in Maidstone, England), and it was clearly a bipedal creature. This was a revolutionary discovery as, until that point, most scientists <b>had</b> <b>believed</b> dinosaurs walked on four feet, like other lizards. Foulke's discoveries sparked a wave of dinosaur mania in the United States.|$|E

5|$|In the {{six weeks}} of {{intensive}} combat, RAF strength had been maintained to extent far greater than the Luftwaffe intelligence <b>had</b> <b>believed</b> possible. On the evening of 14 September, Fighter Command could muster 269 Supermarine Spitfire and 533 Hawker Hurricane fighters. The two vital groups could put up just over 500 fighters. No. 11 Group RAF had 310 fighters, including 92 Spitfires and 218 Hurricanes. No. 12 Group RAF could field 85 Spitfires and 109 Hurricanes. Should No. 10 Group RAF come into the battle, a further 48 Spitfires and 78 Hurricanes could be committed. Compared with 17 August, there were just 22 fewer Spitfires and Hurricanes.|$|E

The lodge was first made nationally famous later that year when actress Clara Bow cancelled checks owed to the casino worth $13,000; she claimed that she <b>had</b> <b>believed</b> that the chips she was using while playing blackjack were worth 50 cents when they were actually valued at $100.|$|E
5|$|Another bombshell is {{dropped in}} Dimitri's {{life when he}} finds out that Anton Lang, who he {{believed}} to be the son of two Marick family employees, is really his son with his maid, Corvina Lang (Margaret Sophie Stein). Dimitri had had a drunken one-night stand with Corvina which he had no memory of. Dimitri is happy to finally be a father, but Corvina convinces him not to tell Anton the truth right away. Dimitri attempts to forge relationship with Anton so it will ease the shock of the news. Nevertheless, Anton, who <b>had</b> <b>believed</b> Corvina was his sister, doesn't take the news of his parentage well and marries Kendall to throw it in Dimitri's face. Eventually, Anton sees Kendall for the manipulator that she is and divorces her. Anton and Dimitri manage to work things out before Anton leaves town.|$|E

5|$|Born on 9 January 1910 in Damascus to {{a middle}} class Greek Orthodox Christian family, his father, Joseph, working as a grain merchant. Aflaq was first educated in the westernized schools of the French Mandate of Syria. In 1929, he left Syria to study {{philosophy}} abroad at the Sorbonne in Paris. During his stay Aflaq {{was influenced by the}} works of Henri Bergson, and met his longtime collaborator Salah al-Din al-Bitar, a fellow Syrian nationalist. Aflaq founded an Arab Student Union at the Sorbonne, and discovered the writings of Karl Marx. He returned to Syria in 1932, and became active in communist politics, but left the movement when the government of Léon Blum, supported by the French Communist Party (FCP), continued France's old politics towards its colonies. Aflaq, and others, <b>had</b> <b>believed</b> that the FCP followed pro-independence policies towards the French colonies. It had not helped that the Syrian–Lebanese Communist Party (SLCP) supported the FCP's decision. From then on Aflaq saw the communist movement as a tool of the Soviet Union. He was impressed by the organisation and ideology of Antun Saadeh's Syrian Social Nationalist Party.|$|E
5|$|Elijah Hise, Chief Justice of the Kentucky Court of Appeals, was {{the leading}} {{candidate}} for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, but after the Whig nomination of Crittenden, Hise withdrew from consideration. The Democratic state convention then nominated Congressman Linn Boyd, but Boyd also declined the nomination. The Democrats were finally able to nominate Henderson lawyer Lazarus W. Powell. As Crittenden canvassed the state, his opponents charged him with disloyalty to Clay because he refused to support him in the 1848 election. Crittenden maintained that he supported Clay for the presidency over anyone else, but he <b>had</b> <b>believed</b> that Clay {{did not intend to}} seek the Whig nomination in 1848. After Clay announced his candidacy, Crittenden said, he remained neutral in the Whigs' choice. In the gubernatorial election, Crittenden defeated Powell by a vote of 65,860 to 57,397. He resigned his Senate seat to assume the governorship.|$|E
5|$|Selena {{signed a}} record deal with EMI {{subsidiary}} SBK Records in November 1993, following her Grammy Award nomination for Live (1993). The {{news of the}} singer's record deal was front-page news in Billboard magazine. In a 1994 meeting, Selena expressed her guilt to Behar; Selena had told interviewers of her upcoming crossover album and told them the recording {{was expected to be}} release soon. At the time, Selena had not recorded a single song for her planned English-language debut. Behar subsequently told Koppelman that Selena and her band would leave EMI and find a record company willing to record an English-language album for Selena. Behar had lied to the chairman to force the crossover album to begin; EMI relented and the recording sessions began. Selena said she felt intimidated by the recording deal because the situation was new to her and only a few people <b>had</b> <b>believed</b> she would achieve success in the pop market.|$|E

5|$|Taking part in {{the third}} series of the BBC family-history {{documentary}} series, Who Do You Think You Are?, Lawson sought to uncover some of her family's ancestry. She traced her ancestors to Ashkenazi Jews who originate from eastern Europe and Germany, leaving Lawson surprised not to have Sephardi ancestry, as she <b>had</b> <b>believed.</b> She also uncovered that her maternal great-great-great grandfather, Coenraad Sammes (later Coleman Joseph), had fled to England from Amsterdam in 1830 to escape a prison sentence following a conviction for theft. His daughter Hannah married Samuel Gluckstein (1821-1873), who was in business with Barnett Salmon of Salmon & Gluckstein. They had several children, including Isidore and Montague Gluckstein, who together with Salmon founded J. Lyons and Co. in 1887, and Helena, who married him. One {{of the children of}} Helena and Barnett Salmon was Alfred Salmon (1868-1928), the great-grandfather of Nigella Lawson.|$|E
5|$|The American {{troops had}} signed up to capture Louisbourg, and {{expected}} to go home after siege ended. The British government, who <b>had</b> <b>believed</b> that the provincial troops were incapable of capturing Louisbourg on their own, had made no plans to send British troops to take over occupation of the fortress. When it become evident that British troops would not be relieving the provincials until after winter had passed, Governor Shirley travelled to Louisbourg to raise {{the morale of the}} troops. His first speech to the troops had little effect, and some troops were close to mutiny. In a second speech Shirley promised to send home more troops immediately, and provide higher pay and better supplies for those who stayed until spring. Honors from the British government were sparse; Pepperrell was made a baronet, he and Shirley were made colonels in the British Army with the right to raise their own regiments, and Warren was promoted to rear admiral.|$|E
5|$|The trio are {{captured}} by Snatchers {{and taken to}} Malfoy Manor, where Bellatrix Lestrange tortures Hermione to learn how the three acquired the sword, which she <b>had</b> <b>believed</b> was in her vault at Gringotts. With the help of Dobby the house-elf they escape along with fellow prisoners Luna Lovegood, Ollivander, Dean Thomas, and the goblin Griphook. Peter Pettigrew emerges and begins to strangle Harry, but Harry reminds him that he owes him a life debt. When Pettigrew hesitates, his brief moment of mercy causes his silver hand to turn on him, strangling and killing him, despite Harry and Ron's best efforts to restrain it. During the escape Harry steals Draco Malfoy's wand and Dobby dies. Bellatrix' terror in interrogating Hermione suggests to Harry some exceptional object is in her vault, and when questioned, Griphook confirms a gold cup is indeed in her vault. With Griphook's help, they break into the vault at Gringotts, retrieve the cup, and escape on a dragon, but in the chaos they lose the Sword of Gryffindor. Harry has a vision of Voldemort and sees he now understands their plan, and intends to make his remaining horcruxes even safer. The vision also confirms the unidentified horcrux is at Hogwarts.|$|E
