50|$|One of {{the most}} {{dramatic}} incidents affected Verstappen at the German Grand Prix. During his first scheduled pitstop during the race, fuel leaked onto the car after the fuel hose was disconnected. The car, with Verstappen in it, was engulfed in flames for several seconds. As was usual at the time, Verstappen had slightly opened the visor of his helmet for the pit stop, but apart from slight burns to his nose, he was uninjured. After this incident the fuel <b>delivery</b> <b>hose</b> was modified to incorporate a fail-safe cut-out system.|$|E
5000|$|AirFLEX - This vehicle {{incorporate}} three {{special service}} fireground support functions into one apparatus. The first service is air cascade and breathing apparatus support. AirFLEX units {{are equipped with}} a supply of extra, full SCBA cylinders and a cascade and compressor for filling SCBA and SCUBA cylinders {{at the scene of}} incidents, as well as basic repair service for SCBA components. AirFLEX can also provide static breathing air via air lines for specialized rescues such as confined space, etc. The second service is floodlight service. Historically, in the fire service, before every front-line apparatus was equipped with power inverters, generators, and scene lighting, stand-alone floodlight units responded to support night-time operations. Original AirFLEX units were equipped with multiple portable floodlight fixtures for such operations, but have adapted to current needs; modern AirFLEX units are equipped with mobile light towers for scene lighting at incidents. The third service is high-expansion foam. Each AirFLEX unit is equipped with a high expansion foam generator, a supply of foam concentrate, and the <b>delivery</b> <b>hose.</b> High-expansion foam is traditionally used for stubborn fires in below-grade or confined environments, where water cannot adequately penetrate, and entry by firefighters is unsafe or unrealistic. In addition to the three [...] "namesake" [...] services, AirFLEX units also provide drinking water for fire scenes, and a supply of freshly charged portable radio batteries for extended incidents. AirFLEX units are staffed by one Emergency Vehicle Driver (or acting EVD). Two front-line AirFLEX units are in service continuously, splitting the city east and west of Charles Street for primary service. An AirFLEX unit is dispatched on working fires, or fires where the Fire Communications Bureau believes that the balance of companies will be utilizing SCBA. An AirFLEX unit is also dispatched automatically on any report of a fire in an ocean-going ship at port, fires below grade (tunnels), and on responses where the SCUBA team is utilized.|$|E
40|$|Analysis {{indicates}} that the Blasius equation yields accurate estimates of head loss in small diameter plastic tubing and larger diameter PVC pipe for Reynolds numbers upto 100, 000. The Hazen-Williams equation with suitable roughness parameter values also predicts head loss accurately. The results of laboratory experiments reveal that the undulations which are created during field installation are {{the primary cause of}} air locking in the <b>delivery</b> <b>hose.</b> The additional head needed to release the trapped air was found to be equal to the sum of heights of all the undulations. If the sum of their heights exceeds the design head loss in the <b>delivery</b> <b>hose,</b> air locking will result. The capital investment for bubbler system under study was comparable to that of a pressurized drip system. Long term savings in terms of energy and maintenance make low head bubbler systems an attractive alternative to pressurized drip systems for irrigating orchards or vineyards...|$|E
5|$|London possessed {{advanced}} fire-fighting {{technology in}} the form of fire engines, which had been used in earlier large-scale fires. However, unlike the useful firehooks, these large pumps had rarely proved flexible or functional enough to make much difference. Only some of them had wheels; others were mounted on wheelless sleds. They had to be brought a long way, tended to arrive too late, and had limited reach, with spouts but no <b>delivery</b> <b>hoses.</b>|$|R
50|$|Following the {{invention}} of the vulcanization process as a means of curing raw soft rubber into a harder, more useful product, the fire service slowly made the transition from bulky and unreliable leather hose to the unlined linen hose, then to a multi-layer, rubber lined and coated hose with interior fabric reinforcement. This rubber hose was as bulky, heavy, and stiff as a leather hose, but was not prone to leaking. It also proved more durable than unlined linen hose. Its wrapped construction resembled some hoses used today by industry, for example, fuel <b>delivery</b> <b>hoses</b> used to service airliners.|$|R
5000|$|Standards {{set by the}} National Fire Protection Association {{require that}} each length of new double jacket, rubber-lined attack hose must be {{pressure}} tested to , but most manufacturers test to [...] Subsequent to <b>delivery,</b> the <b>hose</b> is tested annually to [...] by the fire department. While the hose is under pressure, it is inspected for leaks and to determine that the couplings are firmly attached.|$|R
40|$|Low-head bubbler {{irrigation}} systems are particularly well-suited for the irrigation of orchard crops, and these systems differ from other micor{{irrigation systems}} {{because they are}} based on gravity-flow, can operate at pressures as low as 1 meter (3. 3 ft), and do not require elaborate filtration systems. A design procedure for low-head bubbler systems is described in detail, and example designs for bubbler systems located on level ground and gradual slopes are also presented. The design procedure utilizes head loss gradient charts based on the Darcy-Weisbach equation to size the pipe diameters, and the <b>delivery</b> <b>hose</b> elevations are calculated by using a personal computer with spreadsheet software. The causes of air locks in the laterals and delivery hoses are also investigated, and minimum design flow rates for various pipe diameters are recommended to ensure flow velocities are high enough to prevent air locks from occurring within the delivery hoses...|$|E
40|$|The {{admixture}} of used {{engine oil}} blended with kerosene {{as a substitute}} for industrial fuel was experimented to determine itâ€™s viability for use as an industrial fuel in foundry workshop. Various types of industrial fuel exist, some of which include diesel containing 84. 4 % of carbon, 11. 7 % of hydrogen, 1. 4 % of nitrogen and 0. 60 % of sulphur, a boiling point of about 550 0 F (287. 78 0 C), of 250 o F (121. 11 0 C) and it fractionated pouring temperature of 515 0 F(268. 33 0 C). Equipment used for the experiment include crucible furnace, fuel tank, inlet pipe, wire gauze, flexible hose, the injector nozzles, the electric motor blower, the <b>delivery</b> <b>hose,</b> the control knob, the mixture chamber, the combustion chamber, and the crucible pots (the excavators). Four liters of the mixture of used engine oil to kerosene at a varying ratio of 2 : 1, 3 : 2, 5 : 3, 5 : 2, 3 : 1, 4 : 1, 5 : 1 and 6 : 1 was used to carry out the test. Most appropriate result of the experiment was obtained at a combination ratio of 6 : 1 with four liters of the mixture melting 10 kg of zinc in 22 minutes...|$|E
40|$|Continuous {{positive}} airway pressure (CPAP) {{is a type}} {{of respiratory}} ventilation originally developed for combating sleep apnea, which remains its primary use. It is also useful in providing ventilation for newborns and anyone suffering respiratory failure. As airway muscles relax during sleep, the airway can become partially obstructed. This can lead to lower blood oxygenation and cause awakening or arousal from deep sleep. Maintaining positive air pressure by supplying a continuous source of compressed air, the face mask forms a seal to the face. It is only this air pressure that maintains the open airway, and not the actual movement of air. A sleep physician usually determines the required air pressure after completing a sleep study. Pressure sensors supply feedback of the applied air pressure in the mask/ <b>delivery</b> <b>hose</b> to the microprocessor controller. This microprocessor controller manages the motor-drive stage of a compressor to maintain the correct fan velocity necessary to generate the required air pressure. The main subfunctions that the system is required to monitor and control can be divided as follows: 1. Air-hose-environment sensing This covers air pressure, but may also include air temperature, humidity, and flow rate. 2. Compressor motor-drive feedback Similar to all motordrive systems, some feedback must be provided to maintain torque and/or velocity control. Typically, phase currents or shunt current and rotor feedback must be provided. 3. Motor-drive excitation This is the generation of the waveforms necessary to both induce current in the electric motor an...|$|E
