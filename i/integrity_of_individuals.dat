40|$|Purpose The {{effect of}} nocturnal wear of denture on sleep quality and {{integrity}} {{is still not}} well understood. Therefore, this systematic review was conducted to provide evidence on this topic. Methods Electronic searches were conducted from 1964 up to September 2015, using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Only publications in English or French, in which sleep quality of edentate adult individuals wearing dentures at night was compared to those not wearing {{were included in the}} review. Random effects models were used to pool the effect sizes. Results A total of 10 studies were included in the systematic review and 5 in the meta-analysis. No statistically significant difference between sleeping with denture and without denture was found for the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI; Standard Mean Difference = − 0. 60, 95 % CI − 1. 67 – 0. 47; Z = − 1. 10; p = 0. 27). However, there was considerable heterogeneity in the studies included in the meta-analysis (Tau 2 = 1. 34; Q-value = 59. 32, df = 4 (P < 0. 0001); I 2 = 93. 3 %). When results from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were pooled in subgroup analyses of AHI, there was a tendency towards favoring sleeping without dentures (P = 0. 059) and no evidence of heterogeneity between studies (Tau 2 = 0. 000; Q-value = 0. 06, df = 1 (P = 0. 80); I 2 = 0. 000 %). Conclusion The current evidence suggests that there is no difference in the sleep quality and <b>integrity</b> <b>of</b> <b>individuals</b> wearing or not wearing their denture during sleep. However, the results of randomized controlled trials favoring sleeping without dentures and the likely presence of bias in the previous studies indicate the need for further randomized controlled trials for the development of clinical guideline...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{represents}} {{the first comprehensive}} study of how film was employed in the Canadian province of Québec to reflect upon the AIDS crisis prior {{to the introduction of}} combination therapy. Chapter One establishes how the unique threats posed by HIV to the physical and moral <b>integrity</b> <b>of</b> <b>individuals</b> and societies incites potentially divisive reactions that perpetuate harmful understandings of HIV and those it touches. In contrast, the creative medium of film offers a flexible framework for meditation in which the significations of HIV can be explored and confronted constructively and inclusively. Québec, owing to its historical situation, its distinctive and vibrant cinematic heritage and status as a hub for HIV/AIDS-related activity and solidarity, represents a rich microcosm of the different social, political and creative dynamics at play within the AIDS crisis. Chapter Two establishes how documentary can enact objective investigations of the AIDS crisis that methodically deconstruct prevalent misconceptions of HIV and People living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHAs). These intellectual studies are also juxtaposed with subjective material that evokes the emotional aspects of the crisis. Chapter Three illustrates how testimonial film can catalyse the interrogation by PLWHAs of their relationship with their HIV-positive status. Through the process of filmmaking, PLWHAs can better comprehend the trauma provoked by their status and form friendships and communities built on the discursive and cathartic act of sharing. Chapter Four explains how feature film, exploiting the popular mechanisms of storytelling and characterisation, can bring considerations of HIV to both niche and broader audiences, potentially provoking far-reaching contemplations of the virus. The thesis concludes by summarising how, thanks to its idiosyncratic filmic tradition, Québec’s cinematic representations of HIV/AIDS were varied and revealing, questioning and nuancing problematic understandings of HIV and PLWHAs and successfully investigating the AIDS crisis as a local and global phenomenon of human proportions...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{develops}} {{an idea of}} how {{the common}} good might be pursued in a plural society, beginning from Jonathan Sacks' vision of such a society as a'community of communities'. It does so principally by developing Alasdair Maclnytre's concept of 'tradition'. Chapter 1 begins by assembling conceptual tools for the task, drawing on the work of scholars from a variety of disciplines. These include understandings of morality, plurality, community relations, the common good, the public arena, and modernity. Chapter 2 begins to refine these tools through a case study of The Satanic Verses controversy. The analysis is achieved principally by viewing the controversy in terms of a conflict between two communities of interpretation, a'literary community' and 'the British Muslim community'. While it is recognised that these constructs are over-simplistic, it is argued that the conflict can most fairly be viewed by seeing participants in the controversy as members of communities of interpretation, each with their own history, practices and identities at stake. In the course of the chapter, the 'literary community' is identified as broadly 'liberal' in outlook. Liberalism is then the topic of Chapter 3, in particular recent theoretical formulations of liberalism in the work of Rawls, Kymlicka and Galston, and their application of liberal theory to minority cultures in plural secularised societies. Chapter 4 provides an account of the failure of such liberal approaches according to Maclntyre, developing his concept of tradition as an alternative way to safeguard the <b>integrity</b> <b>of</b> <b>individuals</b> and communities, and to pursue the common good in a plural society. Chapters 5 and 6 seek to understand aspects of British Muslim and Christian communities respectively in the light of this analysis, in particular their inter-relationship with British society, and their contribution to the common good. Chapter 7 then problematises and refines the concept of tradition through an examination of the work of John Milbank, suggesting an understanding of tradition which combines teleological orientation, emphasis on concrete cultural practices and recognition of difference. Finally, Chapter 8 applies this refined concept of tradition to two contested fields; the international debate on Islam and human rights, and multicultural, citizenship and religious education in schools in England and Wales...|$|E
40|$|For most of American history, {{until the}} 1950 s, courts treated paid {{lobbying}} as a civic wrong, not a protected First Amendment right. Lobbying was presumptively against public policy, and lobbying contracts were not enforced. Paid lobbying threatened the <b>integrity</b> <b>of</b> <b>individuals,</b> legislators, lobbyists, {{and the integrity}} of society as a whole. Some states had laws criminalizing lobbying; Georgia had an anti-lobbying provision in its Constitution. Inasmuch as there was a personal right to either petition the government, or share views with officers of the government, this right was not something one could sell [...] it was not, in the term used by one court, a “vendible” [...] a sellable item. Line-drawing between illegitimate paid lobbying and legitimate legal services was not easy, but in general courts enforced contracts where the thing being sold was expertise to be shared in a public forum, while refusing to enforce contracts where the thing being sold was personal influence to be shared in private meetings. During the mid- 20 th century, the practice of not enforcing lobbying contracts fell away. This change came from two things: the growing sanctity of contract, and the professionalization of the lobbying industry. State laws regulated lobbying instead of banning it. At the same time, as a constitutional matter, the law of lobbying occupied something of a no-mans land for many years [...] paid lobbying was neither explicitly protected by the First Amendment nor explicitly not protected. Supreme Court cases suggested, but did not hold, that paid lobbying was a First Amendment right. Only recently, and without much judicial discussion, has the legal-academic community presumed that there is a unique First Amendment right to pay someone to lobby, or be paid to lobby, grounded in the speech and/or petition clauses of the First Amendment. The scope of that right is unclear. This Article tells the history of the earlier approaches towards lobbying. It explores the lobbying cases of the 19 th and early 20 th century courts, looking at the logic underpinning them and how courts distinguished between illegitimate lobbying and legitimate hiring of professional lawyers. This Article is largely historical, but has doctrinal implications. First, it shows that as a matter of practice, there is no historical consensus on a First Amendment right to lobby. Second, the length and breadth of the treatment of lobbying as wrong [...] not a right [...] is indirect evidence that the First Amendment was not intended to protect paid lobbying. Third, the reasoning of the courts that invalidated lobbying contracts is still relevant to the degree of protection, and the kinds of activities that might be worthy of greater or lesser protection...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} was commenced {{to understand why}} patients submissively accept compliance in the nursing relationship. To understand this phenomenon, an anthropological perspective about nursing was sought through ethnographic processes, utilising The Ethnographic Research Cycle and The Developmental Research Sequence as detailed by James Spradley (1980). Ethnographic methods of fieldwork and participant observation were undertaken over a three month period in a district nursing service {{in a rural area}} of Victoria, Australia. There are three over arching aims. The first is to record information at risk of being lost, hence the ethnography is an archival record describing insiders 2 ̆ 7 perspectives of nursing practice. Description brings into view broad contextual issues that shape nursing practice, the daily routines and cultural norms of nursing, whilst also giving voice to patients 2 ̆ 7 experiences about being nursed. The early part of the thesis is descriptive of the mundanity of nursing practice and of being a patient as these interactions are of fundamental significance in giving meaning to people 2 ̆ 7 s lives. Secondly the inquiry seeks to capture the meaning patients attach to nursing. Further description continued to uncover perspectives of nursing that were layered to present an integrated whole that still acknowledges the <b>integrity</b> <b>of</b> <b>individuals</b> and structures that make up that whole. As the cultural picture gained detail, the expected norms of being a nurse and a patient became evident, revealing how culture gives shape to nursing and being nursed. Notions of time and space were found to be constructs of being a patient which shape the illness experience. They are not necessarily within a patient 2 ̆ 7 s control, nonetheless, there is a norm and deviation from this norm has consequences for patients. Thirdly, the ethnography conveys the expected behaviour for a person who becomes a patient, to make known the implicit meanings, norms of behaviour and unwritten rules that a patient needs to understand as they pass through various stages of the health care system. In conclusion, the ethnography consistently reveals the underlying conflict between what nurses believe they do and the meaning attached to the experience of being nursed. For example, some nurses practice with patients 2 ̆ 7 values as central to practice; others believe they care, yet observation and patient conversations suggest that they do not. The ethnography revealed that society expects nurses to elicit and reinforce compliance. Similarly, the power of culture shapes the experience of patients as the desire to be accepted, as a personal need, and as a means of having their nursing needs met, means that patients will invariably be passively compliant. The consequence is that nurses have a dominant power differential over patients, therefore, if nursing is to continue to describe practice as humanistic and caring, they ought to actively seek to be aware of patients 2 ̆ 7 values and be motivated to accept these as central to practice...|$|E

The UN has also issued a variety of protocols, declarations and agreements regarding human rights and their protection, specifically the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 and the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights in 1966. In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Saudi legislation has initiated and allowed various Saudi human rights institutions, namely the Saudi Human Rights Commission and Saudi National Society for Human Rights. In particular, Saudi legislation has focused on Sharia principles {{when it comes to the}} interpretation and implementation of secular international human rights laws.

Saudi legislation has ensured human rights applications in other Saudi criminal laws, such as the Saudi Criminal Procedure Law of 2002, amended in 2014 (hereinafter SCPL), and the Saudi Law of Terrorist Crimes of 2014 (hereinafter SLTC). This short commentary provides a concise summary about the existing Saudi legislation related to terrorist crimes and human rights protection. of what we have created, with [definite] preference” [5]. Moreover, Article 26 of the Saudi Basic Law of Governance states that “The State shall protect human rights in accordance with the Islamic Sharia” [6]. Therefore, it can be seen that the protection of human rights in Saudi Arabia is constitutional since it is encouraged by Islamic principles and Saudi laws. Human rights are usually discussed with specific regard to the implementation of criminal punishment and procedure. Therefore, human rights are the subject matter of lots of international debates and conferences. In recent times, the majority of the countries all over the world, and especially Saudi Arabia, have suffered from terrorism. Saudi Arabia has enacted a variety of criminal laws that look after the benefits of Saudi society, one of which is the Saudi Law of Terrorist Crimes (SLTC). This law examines terrorism incidents and facilitates Saudi authorities to protect the society from terrorism and terrorists. This law contains 41 legal clauses. It explains the criminal procedure for terrorist crimes as well as referring to the superior law, which is Saudi Criminal Procedure Law (SCPL), and addresses any legal clause that is not provided in the SLTC (Article 40 of the SLTC).
