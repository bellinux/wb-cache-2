40|$|The {{experimental}} investigation {{described in}} this thesis is a logical continuation of the combustion work carried out by A. B. Howell* {{in the summer of}} 1949. Howell built the first pilot apparatus to burn vapourized hydrocarbon fuels and used it to measure the carbon deposited {{on the walls of the}} flame tube. This apparatus was rebuilt by the writer and adapted to the measurements of the total free stream carbon appearing in the exhaust. Four fuels were tested and it was found that total carbon formation is primarily a function of the conditions of combustion and, to a much smaller extent, of the properties of the fuels used. The first appearance of free stream carbon occurs almost exactly at the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio for any given fuel, and increases rapidly as the air-fuel ratio is decreased. Turbulence and the quality of mixing are major factors in determining the amount formed. A better indication of carbon-forming tendencies is obtained by studying the carbon precipitation on the <b>fuel</b> <b>nozzle</b> <b>tip.</b> Marked differences exist between amounts deposited by different fuels and the formation depends to a smaller extent on the conditions of combustion. The rate of formation seems to be linked closely to the temperatures existing in the combustion zone, but further work must be done before conclusive results can be obtained...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{hydrogen}} combustion for aircraft gas turbine engines provides significant opportunities to reduce harmful exhaust emissions. Hydrogen has many advantages (no CO 2 production, high reaction rates, high heating value, and future availability), {{along with some}} disadvantages (high current cost of production and storage, high volume per BTU, and an unknown safety profile when in wide use). One of the primary reasons for switching to hydrogen is the elimination of CO 2 emissions. Also, with hydrogen, design challenges such as fuel coking in the <b>fuel</b> <b>nozzle</b> and particulate emissions are no longer an issue. However, because it takes place at high temperatures, hydrogen-air combustion can still produce significant levels of NOx emissions. Much of the current research into conventional hydrocarbon-fueled aircraft gas turbine combustors is focused on NOx reduction methods. The Zero CO 2 Emission Technology (ZCET) hydrogen combustion project will focus on meeting the Office of Aerospace Technology goal 2 within pillar one for Global Civil Aviation reducing the emissions of future aircraft {{by a factor of}} 3 within 10 years and by a factor of 5 within 25 years.

When the <b>nozzle</b> <b>tip</b> size was 1 mm, the particle size distribution was more uniform than when other <b>nozzle</b> <b>tip</b> sizes were used and the average particle size of the powder was about 15 nm. When the <b>nozzle</b> <b>tip</b> size increases to 2 mm, the average particle size increases to roughly 20 nm, and the particle size distribution becomes more uneven. When the tip size increases to 3 mm, particles with an average size of 25 nm and equal to or less than 10 nm coexist and the particle size distribution becomes much more uneven. When the tip size increases to 5 mm, large particles with average size of 50 nm partially exist, mostly consisting of minute particles with average sizes in the range of 15 ~ 25 nm. When the tip size increases from 1 mm to 2 mm, the XRD peak intensities greatly increase while the specific surface area decreases.

In the HC mode, the effects of <b>fuel</b> <b>nozzle</b> geometry on fuel-air mixing were investigated in terms of flame stability and pollutant emissions.

The operating parameter whose effect was investigated was air pressure. Air-to-fuel ratio (AFR) and relative pressure drop were held constant during variations of air pressure. Geometry parameters investigated included swirl angle, <b>fuel</b> <b>nozzle</b> axial position and <b>fuel</b> <b>nozzle</b> flow number. Measurement techniques included Mie-scattering laser light sheets for spray visualization, PDA for a detailed spay analysis and LDA for investigation of the air flow field {{in the absence of}} the spray. The test swirl cup geometry consisted of axial segments, so that cross-sectional planes in the interior of the swirl cup were accessible for light sheet imaging and LDA measurements. PDA measurements were conducted downstream of the swirl cup exit plane. Operating conditions realized for PDA measurements were 6, 12 and 18 bar at 700 K. Light sheet imaging and LDA measurements were performed at scaled operating conditions. It was found that the fuel placement is governed overwhelmingly by the airflow swirl angle. The two-phase flow in the swirl cup depends heavily on whether or not there is a recirculation zone within the swirl cup or not. In the absence of a recirculation zone, the radially inward airflow at the upstream end of the swirl cup causes the spray cone generated by the <b>fuel</b> <b>nozzle</b> to collapse. Subsequent transfer of tangential momentum to the fuel droplets then leads to a re-opening of the spray cone by swirl-induced centrifugal forces. If there is a recirculation zone present within the swirl cup, then the spray generated by the <b>fuel</b> <b>nozzle</b> is injected into a region of upstream and radially outward flow.
