5|$|The Buckeye is {{the only}} purely American breed to sport a pea comb, and this, {{combined}} with its stocky build, makes it a supremely cold hardy chicken. Other breeds of fowl developed in the U.S. (such as the Ameraucana) may sport pea combs, but these chickens were primarily created from foreign birds. It also bears some traits of Game fowl in frame and disposition, being assertive in character {{and a very good}} forager. Generally calm, the cock birds in rare cases may become aggressive. Despite its game heritage, it tolerates confinement well, although <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> happier and produce better if allowed to range on grass. The Buckeye is said by breeders to be disinclined towards feather picking. A good meat producer and layer of between 150 and 200 eggs per year, the Buckeye is a dual purpose chicken wellsuited to small farmyard and backyard flocks.|$|E
25|$|Note: Most {{players will}} declare a Grand {{game with the}} above hand, as <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> more lucrative than a Suit game in Hearts (declarer will concede at most two Club tricks, {{probably}} achieving Schneider for a Game Value of at least 144 (24x6)).|$|E

500|$|Some {{scientists}} now {{consider that the}} effects of global dimming have masked the effect of global warming to some extent and that resolving global dimming may therefore lead to increases in predictions of future temperature rise. According to Beate Liepert, [...] "We lived in a global warming plus a global dimming world and now we are taking out global dimming. So we end up with the global warming world, which will be much worse than we thought <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be,</b> <b>much</b> hotter." [...] The magnitude of this masking effect is one of the central problems in climate change with significant implications for future climate changes and policy responses to global warming.|$|E
500|$|One of CERA's {{objectives}} in approving the implosion {{was to find}} out how the soil behaved, as Radio Network House was built on one of the worst soils in Christchurch. Seismograph readings showed ground velocity of 12mm/s, which is comparable to a large truck slowly driving across the demolition site. With any residual concerns about the performance of poor soils during building implosions removed, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> easier for other building owners to obtain consent from CERA. Further implosions are likely, with a representative from Controlled Demolition, Inc. describing the Christchurch market as a [...] "target-rich environment". So far, only the Christchurch Central Police Station has since also been demolished by implosion in early 2015; this happened in May 2015.|$|E
500|$|... "Back to the Pilot" [...] is {{the fifth}} episode of the tenth season of the {{animated}} comedy series Family Guy. It originally aired on Fox in the United States on November 13, 2011. In [...] "Back to the Pilot", two of the show's main characters, baby genius Stewie and anthropomorphic dog Brian, both voiced by series creator Seth MacFarlane, use a time machine to travel {{back in time to}} the first episode of the series, [...] "Death Has a Shadow". Trouble ensues however, when Brian tells his former self about the September 11 attacks, causing the present to be dramatically changed, and ultimately resulting in a second civil war. The two must then prevent themselves from going back to the past in the first place, but soon realize that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> more difficult than they had originally thought.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{we will go}} on again, and at the double. <b>It</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> as <b>much</b> {{as those}} fellows {{can do to keep}} up with us in this thick wood." ...|$|R

2500|$|The tighter {{specifications}} for video cable tends {{to produce a}} substantially constant characteristic impedance over a wide band (usually nominally 75Ω). [...] On the other hand, audio cable may be nominally 600Ω (300Ω and 150Ω are also standard values), but it will only actually measure this value at 800Hz. [...] At a lower frequencies <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> higher and at higher frequencies will be lower and more reactive.|$|E
2500|$|In mid-July, it was {{announced}} that Douglas had once again left Chow's Gymnastics & Dance Institute. [...] She remained {{in the market for a}} new coach until the beginning of August, when news broke that Douglas would train under Kittia Carpenter at Buckeye Gymnastics in Westerville, Ohio. [...] Nia Dennis, national team member, also trained at Buckeye at the time. [...] Carpenter announced that Douglas would not aim to return to competition at the 2014 national championships, as previously planned, but would instead train with a goal of returning in time for Worlds 2015. [...] The stated reasoning for Douglas's delay is that she wishes to return as strong as – or stronger than – when she left. [...] National Team Coordinator Marta Karolyi, who expressed satisfaction and some surprise with Douglas's physical condition at her first two national team training camps back (while she was once again working with Chow), commented on Douglas's planned comeback in Ohio, [...] "My wish is that she will be consistent in her training. And if that's what she will do, I think she will be fine. But if she jumps up and down and left and right, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> harder." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It {{may not do}} much good," [...] Charlie said, [...] "but if we can induce him {{to remain}} quiet, until we have {{defeated}} Murari Reo, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> so <b>much</b> gained." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{think that}} <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> the best plan," [...] Captain Travers said. [...] "In the first place, it is {{probable}} that they will try to burn us out, tonight; and we could not hope to prevent their piling faggots against the doors, in the dark. For that reason, alone, I think that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> better to attack them than wait for them to attack us.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, on Thursday. <b>It</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> {{better for}} her to be away from London. While she is there she never ventures even into the street." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You are to {{understand}} {{that if you are}} still there in two minutes <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> very <b>much</b> the worse for you." [...] And M. de Lesdiguieres tinkled the silver hand-bell upon his table.|$|R

6000|$|... "No; {{he says if}} the boy is {{innocent}} <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> better to have the matter settled in court, when everybody will know he was wrongfully accused." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is no knowing," [...] Miss Penfold said gloomily. So {{long as it}} is in {{existence}} we shall never feel comfortable. <b>It</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> better to destroy it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{must make}} an {{arrangement}} {{which is to}} last for years, and perhaps for my lifetime; therefore the sooner I place myself on my footing <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> so <b>much</b> the better.--Always, dear Skene, your obliged and faithful, W. SCOTT." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “How do you know, sir, that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> so <b>much</b> at {{the expense}} of my friend?” said the lady, fixing her eyes with a searching look on his countenance, where they met only the unsuspecting {{expression}} of manly regret.|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll {{go down to}} the Old Briar-patch. I don't believe <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> of <b>much</b> use, but {{you never}} can tell until you try. Peter Rabbit may take it into his silly head to come outside," [...] said Granny, leading the way.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I {{will be able}} {{to explain}} myself much better with simple pen and ink," [...] she said dryly, [...] "and <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> more useful to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'One thing I beg of you! Don't {{tell anyone}} {{that you have}} a little bird who tells you everything. <b>It</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> better not to!' Then the Nightingale flew away.|$|E
6000|$|... "I hear him," [...] replied Jimmy calmly. [...] "I'm {{waiting for}} him to open the door for me to go out. <b>It</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> easier than {{squeezing}} through that hole." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We're {{not going}} through to-night," [...] Thorne explained. [...] "The team have had about enough already, and there's a farmer ahead who'll take us in. If {{we reach the}} Bluff by to-morrow {{afternoon}} <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> as <b>much</b> as one could expect." ...|$|R
