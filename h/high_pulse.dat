In contrast, DT occurs in 5–10% of alcoholics and carries up to 15% mortality with treatment and up to 35% mortality without treatment. DT {{is characterized by the}} presence of altered sensorium; that is, a complete hallucination without any recognition of the real world. DT has extreme autonomic hyperactivity (<b>high</b> <b>pulse,</b> blood pressure, and rate of breathing), and 35-60% of patients have a fever. Some patients experience seizures.|$|E
25|$|A {{group of}} EVs and HEVs during their {{charging}} process draw very high current {{for a short}} duration of time which creates power pulsation on the grid. Power pulsation not only reduces {{the efficiency of the}} grid and cause voltage drop in the common coupling bus, but it can cause considerable frequency fluctuation in the entire system. To overcome this problem, supercapacitors can be implemented as an interface between the charging station and the grid to buffer the grid from the <b>high</b> <b>pulse</b> power drawn from the charging station.|$|E
25|$|Fast pulse {{rise time}} rating, high {{dielectric}} strength (breakdown voltage), and low dissipation factor (high Q) are {{the reasons for the}} use of polypropylene film capacitors in fly-back tuning and S-correction applications in older CRT tube television and display equipment. For similar reasons, PP film capacitors, often in versions with special terminals for high peak currents, work well as snubbers for power electronic circuits. Because of their <b>high</b> <b>pulse</b> surge capabilities, PP capacitors are suitable for use in applications where high-current pulses are needed, such as in time-domain reflectometer (TDR) cable fault locators, in welding machines, defibrillators, in high-power pulsed lasers, or to generate high-energy light or X-ray flashes.|$|E

2500|$|The first-generation IGBTs of the 1980s {{and early}} 1990s were prone to failure through effects such as latchup (in which the device will not turn off {{as long as}} current is flowing) and {{secondary}} breakdown (in which a localized hotspot in the device goes into thermal runaway and burns the device out at high currents).

This study investigated the effects of periodic and episodic flow pulses on 0 + fish biomass in a constrained lowland river. De-seasonalized cross-correlation analysis was used to examine time-lagged correlations in episodic signals, in isolation of seasonal periodicity, to identify the responses and response timings of 0 + fish production to abiotic variables, and whether apparent “pulse-depletions” in biomass occur instantaneously (e. g., due to fish displacement during <b>high</b> <b>pulses)</b> or after a time lag. As anticipated, 0 + fish biomass was highest during periods of low discharge and high temperatures in summer, but cross-correlation analysis revealed a negative impact of <b>high</b> <b>pulses</b> on 0 + fish biomass with a lag of 7 months. There was no evidence for an instantaneous pulse-depletion effect of discharge on 0 + fish biomass, suggesting that the indirect effects of <b>high</b> <b>pulses,</b> such as habitat or food-web modifications, are more influential...|$|R

40|$|Background: Cardiovascular {{mortality}} {{is the leading}} cause of death in end stage renal disease. Despite being on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), blood pressure (BP) remains poorly controlled. A <b>higher</b> <b>pulse</b> pressure and non dipping are associated with increased cardiovascular mortality. We studied BP control and the prevalence of non dipping in CAPD patients. Methods: All patients undergoing CAPD at our institution who met the inclusion criteria were recruited. We compared BP control and dipping status in diabetic and non diabetic pa-tients on CAPD. We also determined whether BP and peritoneal membrane permeability were associated. Results: Forty six patients with a mean age 45 ± 13 years were enrolled. Diabetic patients were older (mean age 54 ± 13 vs. 40 ± 11 yrs, p < 0. 001), had a lower mean diastolic BP (80 ± 14 vs. 90 ± 14 mmHg, p = 0. 025) and a <b>higher</b> mean <b>pulse</b> pressure (59 ± 17 vs. 49 ± 14 mmHg, p = 0. 035). They were also non dippers (n = 15 vs. n = 1, p = 0. 007). The low and low average transporters tended to have a higher systolic BP (p = 0. 054) and a <b>higher</b> <b>pulse</b> pressure (p = 0. 058). On multivariate analysis, age was the main predictor of pulse pressure. Conclusion: Despite being on chronic maintenance PD, BP was not well controlled. Diabetic patients had a <b>higher</b> <b>pulse</b> pressure and were non dippers thereby increasing their cardiovascular risk. We should therefore optimize BP control and aim to restore the nocturnal dip in these patients...|$|R
