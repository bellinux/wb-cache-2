Key words: College students; innovative entrepreneurship; <b>education</b> <b>path</b> The innovative entrepreneurship education, aiming at guiding and encouraging the entrepreneurship of college students, is a major model for talents cultivation of college at present and also the important measure to update the education content and reform the teaching path. If the scientific research, social service and talents cultivation can be closely combined to change from emphasis on knowledge teaching to emphasis on quality and ability cultivation, it will greatly drives the employment and entrepreneurship. However, to achieve this goal, the innovative entrepreneurship education should be implemented and the path selection is a necessary way for the implementation of innovative entrepreneurship education. Recently, the author has been always engaged in the educational works related to this and finds an operational innovative entrepreneurship path in the process of continuous exploration and practice, which has obtained good effects.

The problem of group separation lays in isolation experienced by international students from local students, making it harder for them to communicate with each other.

In order to solve these problems, based on our discussion in the report we suggest few possible techniques...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{statistics}} {{collected in}} the last few years in Italy reveal that the massive attendance of foreign children in schools requires urgent educational intervention in the intercultural sense. The school has a social organization that continuously puts in place relational dynamics. Therefore, it is the privileged place to promote respect for diversity and to foster cultural and civic development of those who, in the near future, will be the main protagonists of our society. For this reason, this article focuses primarily on the school and on the eventual arising problems, considering the complexity of this issue. The purpose of this article is, first of all, to provide some pedagogical orientations through the examination of the existing literature on this subject. Secondly, the aim is to propose some possible reflections on the anthropological, political and socio-cultural issues, connected with the problem of immigration and the Italian society evolution, that may be useful for developing intercultural <b>education</b> <b>path</b> in all its specific phases...|$|E
40|$|This {{article focuses}} {{attention}} {{on the problem of}} pupils who drop out of upper secondary school. One possible solution is to help pupils become better at choosing an educational path and subsequent career. As part of a continuing education study on vocational guidance, school counsellors and teachers worked to develop possible solutions to this problem based on R&D work done at their own places of employment. Data was gathered from such activities as pupil guidance conversations and exams/examination assignments. Theoretical concepts from Ellstrøm (2006) were used as analysis tools; adaptive learning and the ideal of pupilship in development. The article presents findings that indicate codetermination – not just involvement –  in the choice of activities, counsellors, <b>education</b> <b>path</b> and a pupil's choice of schools can influence a pupil’s ability to make appropriate career choices. The article provides practical examples of how schools can succeed with this, taking their point of departure in the school subject Educational Choices.

Exploring results of a nationwide Italian PRIN study (consisting in a survey on parents with children at the end of primary and low secondary school and at the beginning of upper secondary schools), the article underlines, besides the influence of parents’ education level and socioeconomic status, the importance of other latent variables influencing parents’ choice, like family involvement in school system and parents’ motivation...|$|R
40|$|Evidence {{suggests}} the average ability of teachers to have progressively declined {{in developed countries}} over the last decades. Many explanations have been proposed, all suggesting {{the idea of a}} lower attractiveness of teaching professions (both in monetary and non monetary terms) with respect to feasible alternative working opportunities. This should apply to women at least, because of the great expansion of job opportunities which interested female cohorts {{in the second half of}} the century. However, the long lasting problem of getting credible ability measures has often driven partial results. Here two UK population samples of individuals born in different years are considered. Individuals were exposed to ability tests at early stages of their life, so that subsequent <b>education</b> <b>paths</b> are exogenous to test scores. Transformation in percentiles allows to get comparable measures of ability, and distributions for those who undertook the teaching career are obtained in the two samples. Consistently with previous literature, using difference-in-difference, we find evidence of teachers quality decline. A gender based analysis is performed in order to address gender differences and specific questions. Data on salaries, ditributions across jobs and social mobility are finally used in order to find possible explanations. Further questions arise. ...|$|R
40|$|The growing {{process of}} {{industrialization}} and commercialization has embroiled the consumerist logic in different social groups including even children, since {{the discovery of}} its potential consumer awakened commercial interests in various segments.

Perspectives brought to light by this study suggest that thinking and rethinking childhood in the consumer culture must become axis of the major themes in school’s education process, because education can provide mediation to foster an analytical and reflective look forward to the consumerist logic, stimulating, thus, significant changes in children's behavior as consumers...|$|R
