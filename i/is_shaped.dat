40|$|AbstractAs {{top-down}} tree transducers generalize generalized sequential machines, shape preserving top-down tree transducers naturally generalize length preserving generalized sequential machines. For instance, top-down relabeling tree transducers <b>are</b> <b>shape</b> preserving top-down tree transducers. We {{show that}} a top-down tree transducer <b>is</b> <b>shape</b> preserving {{if and only if}} it is equivalent to a top-down relabeling tree transducer. We also prove that it is decidable if a top-down tree transducer <b>is</b> <b>shape</b> preserving...|$|R
25|$|Routing <b>is</b> a <b>shaping</b> process used {{to produce}} {{finished}} edges and shapes. Some materials that prove difficult to shape with other processes, such as fiber-glass, Kevlar, and graphite, can <b>be</b> <b>shaped</b> and finished neatly via various routing techniques. Apart from finished edges and shaping, cutaways, holes, and contours can also <b>be</b> <b>shaped</b> using routers.|$|R
5|$|The Quad Electrostatic Loudspeaker (ESL) is the world's first {{production}} full-range electrostatic loudspeaker, {{launched in}} 1957 by Quad Electroacoustics, {{then known as}} the Acoustical Manufacturing Co.

They are widely admired for their clarity and precision, but known to be difficult speakers to run and maintain.|$|E
5|$|The Table Rocks {{offer an}} example of {{inverted}} relief, in which previous topographic lows are filled with a resistant rock and become new topographic highs after {{the erosion of the}} surrounding region. Each plateau <b>is</b> <b>shaped</b> roughly like a horseshoe because the lava followed the meanders of the Ancestral Rogue River.|$|E
5|$|The city's {{appearance}} today <b>is</b> <b>shaped</b> by the {{key role}} it has played {{as a regional}} centre for centuries. Copenhagen has a multitude of districts, each with its distinctive character and representing its own period. Other distinctive features of Copenhagen include the abundance of water, its many parks, and the bicycle paths that line most streets.|$|E
25|$|The {{formations}} in the Devils Garden were created, {{and continue}} to <b>be</b> <b>shaped,</b> by various weathering and erosional processes.

5|$|The {{history of}} the U.S. state of Minnesota <b>is</b> <b>shaped</b> by its {{original}} Native American residents, European exploration and settlement, {{and the emergence of}} industries made possible by the state's natural resources. Minnesota achieved prominence through fur trading, logging, and farming, and later through railroads, and iron mining. While those industries remain important, the state's economy is now driven by banking, computers, and health care.|$|E
5|$|The nests, built {{entirely by}} the female, are mud {{plastered}} to cave entrances or rocky outcrops in forest ravines. The nests are often constructed from the saliva {{of the females}} mixed in with vegetable matter and mud. The nest <b>is</b> <b>shaped</b> like a concave cup. The female typically lays two white eggs. The females incubates these eggs for about 25 to 28 days.|$|E

5|$|The rotor of the Wankel engine <b>is</b> <b>shaped</b> as a {{curvilinear}} triangle that {{is often}} cited {{as an example of}} a Reuleaux triangle. However, its curved sides are somewhat flatter than those of a Reuleaux triangle and so it does not have constant width.|$|E
5|$|After initial cutting, {{the diamond}} <b>is</b> <b>shaped</b> in {{numerous}} stages of polishing. Unlike cutting, {{which is a}} responsible but quick operation, polishing removes material by gradual erosion and is extremely time consuming. The associated technique is well developed; it is considered as a routine and can be performed by technicians. After polishing, the diamond is reexamined for possible flaws, either remaining or induced by the process. Those flaws are concealed through various diamond enhancement techniques, such as repolishing, crack filling, or clever arrangement of the stone in the jewelry. Remaining non-diamond inclusions are removed through laser drilling and filling of the voids produced.|$|E
5|$|As Professor Bernard Quatermass (Brian Donlevy) {{struggles to}} gain {{government}} {{support for his}} moon colonisation project, his interest becomes focused on reports of hundreds of meteorites landing in Winnerden Flats. Travelling there with Marsh, his colleague (Bryan Forbes), Quatermass finds a huge complex under construction, based on his lunar colony plans. Marsh finds an undamaged meteorite <b>is</b> <b>shaped</b> like a small stone rocket. It then cracks open, releasing a gas, leaving him with an odd V-shaped mark on his face. Black-clad guards from the complex arrive, armed with machine guns and sporting similar V-shaped marks, and take Marsh away, knocking down Quatermass and ordering him to leave.|$|E
25|$|Cities <b>are</b> <b>shaped</b> {{by their}} {{transport}} systems. In The City in History, Lewis Mumford documented how {{the location and}} layout of cities <b>was</b> <b>shaped</b> around a walkable center, often located near a port or waterway, and with suburbs accessible by animal transport or, later, by rail or tram lines.|$|R
50|$|A {{positive}} <b>shape</b> <b>is</b> a <b>shape,</b> {{that has}} details inside it, {{such as an}} outline of a human, with body features. While, a negative <b>shape</b> <b>is</b> a <b>shape</b> without any details; it's just an outline.|$|R

5|$|Famine <b>is</b> <b>shaped</b> by {{generally}} two theories. The {{first is}} FAD, Food Availability Decline. This {{is the result}} of a drought, a war, or some other drastic change to the agricultural system. This is the natural cause for famine. The other theory deals primarily with the population’s ability to access or become entitled to food. In this case, food power makes itself known on a small scale, as opposing political forces in Sudan compete for the votes of the people by instigating or encouraging the famine.|$|E
5|$|The Lo Nuestro Award for Pop Album of the Year is {{an honor}} {{presented}} annually by American television network Univision at the Lo Nuestro Awards. The accolade was established to recognize the most talented performers of Latin music. The nominees and winners were originally selected by a voting poll conducted among program directors of Spanish-language radio stations in the United States and also based on chart performance on Billboard Latin music charts, with the results being tabulated and certified by the accounting firm Deloitte. However, since 2004, the winners are selected through an online survey. The trophy awarded <b>is</b> <b>shaped</b> {{in the form of}} a treble clef.|$|E
5|$|The {{paratope}} <b>is</b> <b>shaped</b> at {{the amino}} terminal {{end of the}} antibody monomer by the variable domains from the heavy and light chains. The variable domain is {{also referred to as}} the FV region and is the most important region for binding to antigens. To be specific, variable loops of β-strands, there each on the light (VL) and heavy (VH) chains are responsible for binding to the antigen. These loops are referred to as the complementarity determining regions (CDRs).|$|E

5|$|The {{terminal}} {{consists of}} a single building, with an integrated control tower, capable of handling 120passengers per hour. The facade is covered in Russian larch; the focus on wood as a dominant material was common for Norwegian architecture the 1990s, and is also seen at Oslo Airport, Gardermoen (opened in 1998) and for the venues of the 1994 Winter Olympics. The terminal was designed by Alta-based architect Solveig Thorsen and <b>is</b> <b>shaped</b> like an aircraft wing, similar to the terminal building at Gardermoen. There is a single gate at the airport, which prior to the installation of security control was 17steps from the entrance.|$|E
5|$|The {{west coast}} of Ireland, Lahinch and Donegal Bay in particular, have popular surfing beaches, being fully exposed to the Atlantic Ocean. Donegal Bay <b>is</b> <b>shaped</b> like a funnel and catches west/south-west Atlantic winds, {{creating}} good surf, especially in winter. Since just before the year 2010, Bundoran has hosted European championship surfing. Scuba diving is increasingly popular in Ireland with clear waters and large populations of sea life, particularly along the western seaboard. There are also many shipwrecks {{along the coast of}} Ireland, with some of the best wreck dives being in Malin Head and off the County Cork coast.|$|E
5|$|Urquhart {{is one of}} {{the largest}} castles in Scotland in area. The walled portion of the castle <b>is</b> <b>shaped</b> roughly like a figure-8 aligned northeast-southwest along the bank of the loch, around , forming two baileys ({{enclosures}}): the Nether Bailey to the north, and the Upper Bailey to the south. The curtain walls of both enclosures date largely to the 14th century, though much augmented by later building, particularly to the north where most of the remaining structures are located.|$|E
