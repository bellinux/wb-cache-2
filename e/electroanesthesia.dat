40|$|Chemical anesthetics {{requiring}} a mandatory withdrawal period {{to allow for}} dissipation of drug residues pose severe limitations to acoustic research conducted at sea where captured fish undergo surgical implantation of transmitters and are released shortly after treatment. The efficacy and safety of three unrestricted approaches to anesthesia were evaluated in Gopher Rockfish Sebastes carnatus: carbon dioxide (CO 2), sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3), and pulsed direct current (pDC) <b>electroanesthesia.</b> These immediate-release methods {{were used to assess}} anesthetic induction and recovery times, plasma cortisol concentrations, and survival rates following surgery compared to those obtained from the widely used chemical anesthetic, tricaine methanesulfonate (MS- 222). All anesthetics were effective at the concentrations tested. However, the times required to achieve stage IV anesthesia differed significantly, being shortest for <b>electroanesthesia</b> (nearly instantaneous) and longest for CO 2 (3. 56 ± 0. 21 min [mean ± SE]). Recovery times were significantly longer for NaHCO 3 (7. 21 ± 1. 17 min) and CO 2 (7. 78 ± 0. 93 min) compared to pulsed DC <b>electroanesthesia</b> (3. 76 ± 0. 21 min) and MS- 222 (3. 65 ± 0. 38 min). Plasma cortisol levels differed among treatments but tended to peak around 0. 5 h post-anesthesia and decline within 2 h. Given the prolonged recovery times of NaHCO 3 and CO 2, <b>electroanesthesia</b> is the most preferable method for rapid induction, recovery, and immediate release of Gopher Rockfish following surgery at sea...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to compare the effectiveness of ring block anesthesia (LA) and <b>electroanesthesia</b> (A) for antler removal in elk given a long-acting tranquilizer to remove stress from restraint. Thirty-two male wapiti were given 1 mg/kg body weight of zuclopenthixol acetate; the next day, they were restrained in a hydraulic chute, provided with <b>electroanesthesia</b> or a lidocaine ring block, and had their antlers removed. Behavioral response to antler removal was scored. Significantly more (P = 0. 032) animals responded to antler removal in the EA group. Heart rates and arterial pressures were measured by a catheter connected to a physiological monitor. Heart rate increased significantly over time with EA, but not with LA. Heart rate increased from baseline significantly more in the EA group immediately prior to antler removal (P = 0. 017), immediately post antler removal (P = 0. 001), and at 1 min post antler removal (P = 0. 037). It was concluded that EA is not as effective a method of anesthesia as is LA for antler removal...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Implantation of {{telemetry}} transmitters in {{fish can}} be affected by different parameters. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of type of anesthetic, tag size, and surgeon experience on surgical and postsurgical wound healing in the neotropical fish Prochilodus lineatus. In total, eighty fish were surgically implanted with telemetry transmitters and forty fish were kept as controls. Forty fish were implanted with a small tag and other forty were implanted with a large tag. Similarly, forty fish were anesthetized with eugenol and forty fish were anesthetized by <b>electroanesthesia,</b> and forty surgeries were performed by an expert surgeon and forty surgeries were performed by novice surgeons. At {{the end of the}} experimental period seventeen (21. 3 %) tagged fish had postsurgical complications, including death (1. 3 %), tag expulsion (2. 5 %), antenna migration (2. 5 %), and infection (15 %). Tag size was the key determinant for postsurgical complications. Surgical details and postsurgical wound healing were not affected by type of anesthetic. Incision size, duration of surgery, and wound area were significantly affected by tag size and surgeon experience, and the number of sutures was significantly affected by tag size only. The results indicate that successful implantation of telemetry transmitters is dependent upon surgeon experience and tag size...|$|E
