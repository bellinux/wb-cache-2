5000|$|On the 2007 {{advisory}} list {{of threatened}} vertebrate fauna in Victoria, the <b>diamond</b> <b>dove</b> {{is listed as}} near-threatened.|$|E
50|$|His best winners have {{included}} Shamdinan (Secretariat Stakes), Ask for the Moon (Prix Saint-Alary), Aoife Alainn (Premio Lydia Tesio), Testa Rossi (Miss Grillo Stakes), Celimene (Prix Penelope), <b>Diamond</b> <b>Dove</b> (Preis der Winterkönigin) and Beatrice (Schwarzgold-Rennen).|$|E
50|$|<b>Diamond</b> <b>doves</b> are {{not listed}} as {{threatened}} on the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.|$|R
50|$|<b>Diamond</b> <b>doves</b> {{live for}} 15-25 years in captivity. In the wild they only live for about 3-5 years.|$|R
50|$|<b>Diamond</b> <b>doves</b> {{should be}} {{encouraged}} to eat a variety of greens and vegetables in addition to their seed diets. They swallow seeds whole and should be given access to grit to help digest the seeds. In winter, the birds suffer in cold and should not be placed near drafts; a heating pad or basking rock (such as those sold in pet stores for lizards) {{can be used as a}} supplemental heat source, and is greatly enjoyed by many <b>diamond</b> <b>doves.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The <b>diamond</b> <b>dove</b> {{is listed}} as {{threatened}} on the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act (1988). [...] Under this Act, an Action Statement for the recovery and future management of this species has not been prepared.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>diamond</b> <b>dove</b> {{is often}} seen on the ground, where it runs with a {{waddling}} gait. Its flight is strong, direct, and sometimes undulating. The wings can make a whistling [...] "frrr" [...] noise when flying.|$|E
50|$|<b>Diamond</b> <b>Dove</b> (2006) {{is a crime}} {{novel by}} Australian author Adrian Hyland. It {{is the first in}} the author's series of novels {{featuring}} the recurring character Emily Tempest. It won the Best First Novel category of the 2007 Ned Kelly Awards.|$|E
50|$|<b>Diamond</b> <b>doves</b> {{tend to be}} seen {{in pairs}} or small groups feeding off the ground. They feed off seed mostly from grasses. They will also eat ants.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} bill {{structure}} on seed preference and handling time in granivorous birds was determined for a long, slender dove bill, a conical finch bill, and a hooked parrot bill using <b>diamond</b> <b>doves</b> (husked seeds prior to ingestion; lovebirds took significantly longer than Java sparrows in handling all seed species. Seed characteristics, {{size and shape}} affected handling time with reference to bill structure. <b>Diamond</b> <b>doves</b> took significantly longer to handle elongate seeds while Java sparrows handled round seeds slowly and Fischer’s lovebirds required similar handling times for all seed species. Java sparrows and Fischer’s lovebirds selected greater proportions of the same seed species, suggesting that birds which husk seeds prefer similar seed species. Seeds were not selected according to nutritional intake rate. Japanese millet was the preferred seed species of Fischer’s lovebirds and Java sparrows, but provided few calories and little protein per unit time. Seed selection was influenced by bill structure, as seeds were selected, amongst others, according to handling time, and handling time was dependent on bill structure. Geopelia cuneata), Java sparrows (Padda oryzivora) and Fisher’s lovebirds (Agapornis fischeri). Four seed species were used during trials: white millet (Panicum miliaceum), red manna (P. maximum), canary seed (Phalaris canariensis) and Japanese millet (Echinochloa frumentacea). <b>Diamond</b> <b>doves</b> handled all seed species significantly faster than sparrows and lovebirds, as they swallow seeds whole. Java sparrows and Fischer’s lovebirds </strong...|$|R
50|$|<b>Diamond</b> <b>doves</b> {{can be kept}} {{and bred}} well in captivity and some lines have been bred for so many generations as to be {{considered}} domesticated. They spend {{a considerable amount of}} time on the ground and require a wide area to walk around. Wire-bottomed cages are not desirable; also, the floor of the cage should be kept clean since they will be walking on it. The cage should also contain perches spaced widely enough for the bird to fly safely.|$|R
50|$|Hyland's two crime novels feature young {{indigenous}} woman Emily Tempest, {{the daughter}} of an Aboriginal mother and white father who has studied at Melbourne University. In the first novel, <b>Diamond</b> <b>Dove,</b> she is an amateur detective, but by the second, Gunshot Road, she is employed as an Aboriginal community police officer.|$|E
50|$|Castle Arcen (Kasteeltuinen Arcen) is a {{historic}} castle with gardens and a zoo. Animals in the zoo include squirrel monkeys, cockatiels, <b>diamond</b> <b>dove,</b> Japanese quail, helmet guinea fowl, black swans, crested screamer, flamingos, European storks, koi, carp, salmon trout, beluga sturgeon, European eagle owl, green macaw, blue yellow macaw, demoiselle crane, marabou, and Von der Decken's tok.|$|E
5000|$|In May 2013 she {{released}} her single, [...] "My Pledge", {{on her own}} label, <b>Diamond</b> <b>Dove.</b> The lyrics deal with the blackbirding of her great grandfather and about honouring and respecting one's elders. At the Deadly Awards 2013 Stacey was nominated for Single Release of the Year for [...] "My Pledge", and for Female Artist of the Year.|$|E
5000|$|The Best Of Ronnie <b>Dove</b> (<b>Diamond</b> Records No. 5005, 1966) U.S. No. 35 ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Diamond</b> <b>doves</b> build nests in open scoops, {{and will}} {{appreciate}} open-topped nest baskets. They will nest in whatever they find, however, including the seed dish. The mating behavior {{begins with a}} repeated call, usually by the male but sometimes by a female if kept singly. The male will display his tail feathers by dipping his head low and raising his tail, spreading the long feathers like a fan towards a desired female while uttering a two-note coo. The pair will stay together for long periods, greeting each other with low coos and vibrating their wings, or symbolically preening each other with rapid light pecks.|$|R
50|$|Generally, {{they must}} live in pairs or flocks, as {{their need for}} {{companionship}} is high. Single <b>diamond</b> <b>doves</b> can bond to humans if acquired when relatively young, but this requires a commitment of time and attention from the owner because they require months or years to tame and will then require significant companionship time with their owner, much like a parrot. Once tamed, the dove is a sweet and gentle pet, who greets its owner with happy coos and will perch on the finger or shoulder. They will also preen their owner with rapid light pecks, and accept being stroked gently in return. Care {{must be taken to}} avoid the bird thinking of its owner as a mate, as this leads to egg-laying and excessive dependence on its owner's companionship, and is stressful to the bird. This can be avoided by not being affectionate with the bird while it is engaging in nesting or display behaviors.|$|R
50|$|The <b>diamond</b> <b>dove</b> (Geopelia cuneata) is a {{resident}} bird in Australia. The dove predominantly exists in areas near water but which are lightly arid or semi-arid in nature, being Central, West and Northern Australia. They {{are one of}} Australia's smallest pigeons along with the peaceful dove. They have been spotted occasionally in Southern Australia in parks and gardens when the centre of Australia is very dry.|$|E
50|$|Tropical House - The {{tropical}} {{house was}} first opened in 2004, and (including the foyer which houses the bat exhibit) covers 1100 m². This area {{is home to}} a variety of tropical plants, three ponds containing goldfish and koi, a butterfly house, silvery-cheeked hornbill enclosure and a variety of free roaming animals including; common marmosets, chattering lory, black-winged lory, white-cheeked turaco, <b>diamond</b> <b>dove</b> and many more.|$|E
50|$|Geopelia is a genus of small, long-tailed doves. They {{are native}} to South-east Asia and Australasia and {{are most often}} found in open country and scrubland. They feed mainly on seeds which they find by {{foraging}} on the ground. They typically lay two eggs in a simple nest of twigs and grass. Their plumage is mostly greyish-brown with a pattern of spots or bars. The zebra dove and <b>diamond</b> <b>dove</b> are commonly kept in captivity.|$|E
40|$|One {{hypothesis}} {{explaining the}} honesty of secondary sexual traits regulated by testosterone (T) is that T can impair {{the balance between}} pro-oxidant compounds and antioxidant defences, favouring a status of oxidative stress that only good quality individuals can sustain (oxidative handicap hypothesis). In the present study, we evaluated {{for the first time}} the effects of sexual steroids, T and its metabolites 5 -alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and estradiol (E 2) on oxidative damage and plasma non-enzymatic antioxidant capacity, while birds are faced by an oxidative challenge induced by an immune stimulation with sheep red blood cells. We used male and female <b>diamond</b> <b>doves</b> Geopelia cuneata, a species that shows an orange-red periorbital ring, whose size and color are strongly affected by androgens, but not by estrogens. Immunization increased oxidative damage in all groups, regardless of hormone treatment It also decreased anti-oxidant capacity in all groups, except for testosterone treated birds. The ratio of oxidative damage over anti-oxidant capacity (oxidative stress) was increased in both immunological challenged controls and E 2 birds, while challenged birds treated with androgens did not differ from non-challenged birds. The response of males and females to our treatments never differed. Our results undermine the idea that T can induce honest signalling through a pro-oxidant activity. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that carotenoid-based traits are under the control of testosterone (T) by up-regulation of carotenoid carriers (lipoproteins) and/or tissue-specific uptake of carotenoids. T can be converted to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and estradiol (E 2), and variation in conversion rate may partly explain some contradictory findings in the literature. Moreover, most studies on the effect of T on sexual signals have focused on the male sex only, while in many species females show the same signal, albeit to a lesser extent. We studied the effects of T, DHT, and E 2 treatment in male and female <b>diamond</b> <b>doves</b> Geopelia cuneata in which both sexes have an enlarged red eye ring, which is more pronounced in males. We first showed that this periorbital ring contains very high concentration of carotenoids, of which most are lutein esters. Both T and DHT were effective in enhancing hue, UV-chroma and size in both sexes, while E 2 was ineffective. However, E 2 dramatically increased the concentration of circulating lipoproteins. We conclude that in both sexes both color and size of the secondary sexual trait are androgen dependent. The action of androgens is independent of lipoproteins regulation. Potential mechanisms and their consequences for trade-off are discussed. ...|$|R
50|$|Aside from a brief cameo in <b>Diamond</b> Head (1963), <b>Dove</b> never {{returned}} to the movies. She spent her retirement years in Rancho Mirage before moving into the Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital in Woodland Hills, California where she died of pneumonia on New Year's Eve 1997, aged 94.|$|R
5000|$|In 1968, singer Ronnie Dove had a minor hit when he {{released}} his version as the B-side of [...] "Never Gonna Cry (The Way I'll Cry Tonight)" [...] on <b>Diamond</b> Records. Ronnie <b>Dove's</b> version spent 6 {{weeks on the}} Billboard Hot 100, and reached #67. This recording featured A-list session musicians, such as Boots Randolph on saxophone and Glen Campbell on guitar.|$|R
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that sexual ornaments are honest signals of quality because their expression {{is dependent on}} hormones with immune-depressive effects has received ambiguous support. The hypothesis might be correct for those signals that are carotenoid-dependent because the required carotenoid deposition in the signal, stimulated by testosterone, might lower the carotenoid-dependent immune defence of the organism. Two pathways underlying this androgen-dependent honest signaling have been suggested. Firstly, androgens that are needed for ornament expression may suppress immune defence, a cost that only high-quality animals can afford. Alternatively, immune activation may downregulate the production of androgens in low-quality individuals. Which of these alternatives is correct, {{and to what extent}} these effects are mediated by the different metabolites of androgens, remain open questions. To provide answers to these questions, we manipulated the levels of testosterone (T), 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and 17 -beta-estradiol (E 2) in <b>diamond</b> <b>doves</b> Geopelia cuneata, a species in which both sexes exhibit a carotenoid-dependent, androgen-regulated red orange peri-orbital ring of bare skin. On {{the first day of the}} experiment (day 0), we inserted steroid-releasing implants into groups of birds and on day 14, we subjected half of the birds to an immunological challenge by immunizing them with sheep red blood cells (SRBC). In females, but not in males, androgen but not estradiol treatments reduced antibody production to SRBC. In addition, the immunological challenge reduced redness and size of the trait as well as androgens levels in both sexes and in all treatments. This indicates that an immunological challenge can lower circulating T at the cost of the trait expression. These findings are in accordance with both pathways postulated in the immunocompetence-handicap hypothesis, but do not entirely support the idea that the immunosuppressive effect of androgens yields honest signaling since both T and DHT were not immunosuppressive in males, for which sexual signaling is supposed to be especially important...|$|R
