50|$|Non-inverting circuit. The classic {{non-inverting}} Schmitt trigger can {{be turned}} into an inverting trigger by taking Vout from the emitters instead of from a Q2 collector. In this configuration, the output voltage is equal to the dynamic threshold (the shared <b>emitter</b> <b>voltage)</b> and both the output levels stay away from the supply rails. Another disadvantage is that the load changes the thresholds so, it has to be high enough.

50|$|ECL {{is based}} on an emitter-coupled (long-tailed) pair, shaded red in the figure on the right. The left half of the pair (shaded yellow) {{consists}} of two parallel-connected input transistors T1 and T2 (an exemplary two-input gate is considered) implementing NOR logic. The base voltage of the right transistor T3 is held fixed by a reference voltage source, shaded light green: the voltage divider with a diode thermal compensation (R1, R2, D1 and D2) and sometimes a buffering emitter follower (not shown on the picture); thus the <b>emitter</b> <b>voltages</b> are kept relatively steady. As a result, the common emitter resistor RE acts nearly as a current source. The output voltages at the collector load resistors RC1 and RC3 are shifted and buffered to the inverting and non-inverting outputs by the emitter followers T4 and T5 (shaded blue). The output emitter resistors RE4 and RE5 do not exist in all versions of ECL. In some cases 50 Ω line termination resistors connected between the bases of the input transistors and −2 V act as emitter resistors.|$|R
50|$|Direct-coupled circuit. To {{simplify the}} circuit, the R1 - R2 voltage divider can be omitted {{connecting}} Q1 collector directly to Q2 base. The base resistor RB can be omitted as well {{so that the}} input voltage source drives directly Q1's base. In this case, the common <b>emitter</b> <b>voltage</b> and Q1 collector voltage are not suitable for outputs. Only Q2 collector should {{be used as an}} output since, when the input voltage exceeds the high threshold and Q1 saturates, its base-emitter junction is forward biased and transfers the input voltage variations directly to the emitters. As a result, the common <b>emitter</b> <b>voltage</b> and Q1 collector voltage follow the input voltage. This situation is typical for over-driven transistor differential amplifiers and ECL gates.|$|E
50|$|Where bipolar {{junction}} transistors are used, {{the bias}} network must compensate for the negative temperature coefficient of the transistors' base to <b>emitter</b> <b>voltage.</b> This {{can be done by}} including a small value resistor between emitter and output. Also, the driving circuit can have silicon diodes mounted in thermal contact with the output transistors to provide compensation.|$|E
5000|$|Crossing up {{the high}} threshold. When the input voltage (Q1 base voltage) rises {{slightly}} above the voltage across the emitter resistor RE (the high threshold), Q1 begins conducting. Its collector voltage goes down and Q2 begins going cut-off, because the voltage divider now provides lower Q2 base voltage. The common <b>emitter</b> <b>voltage</b> follows this change and goes down thus making Q1 conduct more. The current begins steering {{from the right}} leg of the circuit to the left one. Although Q1 is more conducting, it passes less current through RE (since RC1 > RC2); the <b>emitter</b> <b>voltage</b> continues dropping and the effective Q1 base-emitter voltage continuously increases. This avalanche-like process continues until Q1 becomes completely turned on (saturated) and Q2 turned off. The trigger is transitioned to the high state and the output (Q2 collector) voltage is close to V+. Now, the two resistors RC1 and RE form a voltage divider that determines the low threshold. Its value is approximately ...|$|E

50|$|Crossing {{down the}} low threshold. With the trigger {{now in the}} high state, if the input voltage lowers enough (below the low threshold), Q1 begins cutting-off. Its {{collector}} current reduces; as a result, the shared <b>emitter</b> <b>voltage</b> lowers slightly and Q1 collector voltage rises significantly. The R1-R2 voltage divider conveys this change to the Q2 base voltage and it begins conducting. The voltage across RE rises, further reducing the Q1 base-emitter potential in the same avalanche-like manner, and Q1 ceases to conduct. Q2 becomes completely turned on (saturated) and the output voltage becomes low again.|$|E

5000|$|The minimum {{output voltage}} of the Wilson current mirror must exceed the base <b>emitter</b> <b>voltage</b> of Q2 by enough that Q3 will operate in active mode rather than saturation. Gilbert reports {{data on a}} {{representative}} implementation of a Wilson current mirror that showed constant output current for an output voltage as low as 880 millivolts.

50|$|Charge {{pumps are}} often used in H-Bridges in high side drivers for gate driving the high side {{n-channel}} power MOSFETs and IGBTs. These devices are used because of their good performance, but require a gate drive voltage a few volts above the power rail. When the centre of a half bridge goes low the capacitor is charged via a diode, and this charge is used to later drive {{the gate of the}} high side FET gate a few volts above the source or <b>emitter</b> pin's <b>voltage</b> so as to switch it on. This strategy works well provided the bridge is regularly switched and avoids the complexity of having to run a separate power supply and permits the more efficient n-channel devices to be used for both high and low switches.|$|R
50|$|The way {{feedback}} {{controls the}} bias point is as follows. If Vbe is held constant and temperature increases, emitter current increases. However, a larger Ie increases the <b>emitter</b> <b>voltage</b> Ve = IeRe, {{which in turn}} reduces the voltage VRb across the base resistor. A lower base-resistor voltage drop reduces the base current, which results in less collector current because Ic = β IB. Collector current and emitter current are related by Ic = α Ie with α ≈ 1, so the increase in emitter current with temperature is opposed, and the operating point is kept stable.|$|E
5000|$|At {{constant}} current, {{the voltage}} across the emitter - base junction VBE of a bipolar transistor decreases 2 mV (silicon) and 1.8mV (germanium) for each 1 °C rise in temperature (reference being 25 °C). By the Ebers - Moll model, if the base - <b>emitter</b> <b>voltage</b> VBE is held constant {{and the temperature}} rises, the current through the base - emitter diode IB will increase, and thus the collector current IC will also increase. Depending on the bias point, the power dissipated in the transistor may also increase, which will further increase its temperature and exacerbate the problem. This deleterious positive feedback results in thermal runaway. There are several approaches to mitigate bipolar transistor thermal runaway. For example, ...|$|E
50|$|The UJT {{is biased}} with a {{positive}} voltage between the two bases. This causes a potential drop {{along the length of}} the device. When the <b>emitter</b> <b>voltage</b> is driven approximately one diode voltage above the voltage at the point where the P diffusion (emitter) is, current will begin to flow from the emitter into the base region. Because the base region is very lightly doped, the additional current (actually charges in the base region) causes conductivity modulation which reduces the resistance of the portion of the base between the emitter junction and the B2 terminal. This reduction in resistance means that the emitter junction is more forward biased, and so even more current is injected. Overall, the effect is a negative resistance at the emitter terminal. This is what makes the UJT useful, especially in simple oscillator circuits.|$|E
50|$|In a grounded-emitter {{transistor}} circuit, {{such as the}} light-switch circuit shown, as {{the base}} <b>voltage</b> rises, the <b>emitter</b> and collector currents rise exponentially. The collector voltage drops because of reduced resistance from collector to <b>emitter.</b> If the <b>voltage</b> difference between the collector and emitter were zero (or near zero), the collector current would be limited only by the load resistance (light bulb) and the supply voltage. This is called saturation because current is flowing from collector to emitter freely. When saturated, the switch {{is said to be}} on.|$|R
5000|$|The Wilson {{current mirror}} {{achieves}} the high output impedance of equation (6) by negative feedback {{rather than by}} emitter degeneration as cascoded mirrors or sources with resistor degeneration do. The node impedance of the only internal node of the mirror, the node at the emitter of Q3 and the collector of Q2, is quite low. [...] At low frequency, that impedance is given by [...] For a device biased at 1 mA having a current gain of 100, this evaluates to 0.26 ohms at 25 deg. C. Any change in output current with output voltage results in {{a change in the}} emitter current of Q3 but very little change in the <b>emitter</b> node <b>voltage.</b> The change in [...] is fedback through Q2 and Q1 to the input node where it changes the base current of Q3 in a way that reduces the net change in output current, thus closing the feedback loop.|$|R
50|$|One type of RTDs {{is formed}} as a single quantum well {{structure}} surrounded by very thin layer barriers. This structure is called a double barrier structure. Carriers such as electrons and holes can only have discrete energy values inside the quantum well. When a voltage is placed across an RTD, a terahertz wave is emitted, which is why the energy value inside the quantum well is equal to that of the <b>emitter</b> side. As <b>voltage</b> is increased, the terahertz wave dies out because the energy value in the quantum well is outside the emitter side energy.|$|R
