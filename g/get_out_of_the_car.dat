She is then introduced wearing a black hat and white shirt with a tie, while a crowd {{of male and female}} dancers perform a synchronized choreography. Following this, Stan makes an appearance wearing a white dress, and {{a police car}} is shown arriving. Subsequently, two policemen <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> in order to search for Stan.

5|$|At a {{labelled}} building, {{the player}} can <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> and enter, though enemies will only appear during certain {{times of the}} day. If the player arrives too early, the enemy gangsters will attempt to escape. If the player arrives too late, the building will be found vacant. A timetable of all meetings {{are included in the}} game's instruction manual. The aesthetic interior of buildings include two rooms, with limited decorations such as a pool table and chairs. Some buildings contain evidence bags which can be collected for extra points. Once the player comes into contact with an enemy, a separate window will appear which will display his name. The player can apprehend him by either catching or trapping him. Once caught, the player may take him to the city hall to interrogate him in order to receive information such as the location of the next gangster meetup. Points are gained by apprehending criminals, returning evidence bags or destroying cars.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} Jason Wade in the driver's {{seat of a}} car, with {{the other members of}} Lifehouse in the car with him. The traffic is at a stand still in a tunnel, as a swarm of people have {{abandoned}} their vehicles and are walking through. Wade and the band members <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> and begin walking in the opposite direction of the crowd {{to the other side of}} the tunnel. Wade pushes through the people, who are in a rush to get to the entrance of the tunnel and is constantly focused on his destination to get to the end. When he reaches the tunnel's end, he sees the wreckage of a car crash with firefighters and paramedics cleaning up the mess. Wade then sees a girl observing what appears to be herself, dead inside one of the crashed car. He then looks to the left, and sees an old man observing himself, dead on the ground. As Wade looks into the other car, he sees himself, also seemingly dead. Upon this, Wade frantically runs back into the tunnel towards his car. Then he sees himself in the car with the band members, however everyone seems to be frozen as he bangs on the windows. Suddenly Wade is inside the car again, and a police officer comes to the window, motioning him to continue driving, since he is stopped in the middle of the tunnel for no apparent reason.|$|E

Aomame makes her way to a hotel in Shibuya, where she poses as a hotel attendant in order to kill a hotel guest.

25|$|Even {{with the}} {{conditions}} treacherous, 200,000 spectators turned {{up for the}} race on Sunday afternoon. The race {{turned out to be}} a one-man show by Scotsman Jackie Stewart. While Graham Hill took the lead at the start, by the end of the first lap Stewart had moved into first place and built a nine-second lead. He put his superior Dunlop wet tires to great effect and by the end of lap 2, had extended his lead to 34 seconds. When the race ended after 14 laps, Stewart crossed the line more than 4 minutes in front of second placed Hill. The eventual World Champion had spun on lap 11, but was able to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> push it into the right direction and keep going before third-placed Jochen Rindt could catch up. Chris Amon had battled with Hill for 11 laps over second place, rarely having more than a second between the two, until Amon spun out of the race on the same lap as Hill did.|$|E

The developers felt that everything else needed a new approach, while only the driving portion of Road Rage was worth keeping; in Hit & Run, enhanced traffic artificial intelligence is introduced, which makes computer-controlled vehicles react better to the player's driving. The developers also decided to add an exploration element to the game to make players <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> and navigate the area on foot, so that the game offered a better experience of Springfield.|$|E

Later, Walter excitedly says he remembers someone who played the banjo and looked like the kidnapped, deformed boy, and starts humming a tune. Peter completes the tune and explains {{it is from the}} movie Deliverance (1972), which depicts murderous, inbred, and deformed people living in rural Georgia. The army experiment was titled [...] "Project Elephant", a possible reference to Joseph Merrick, a deformed person known as the [...] "Elephant Man".
