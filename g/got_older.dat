5|$|Tim {{was born}} in Downers Grove, Illinois on December 8, 1967 to James and Kathleen Breslin. He was one of six children, having three sisters and two {{brothers}}. Breslin grew up in Addison, Illinois where he began playing hockey at age five. He learned the game while playing with his brothers on a frozen pond near the family home and on a backyard rink his father made. As he <b>got</b> <b>older</b> Breslin played in local leagues and Driscoll Catholic High School's club team, which afforded {{him the opportunity to}} join the Dubuque Fighting Saints in the United States Hockey League.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, {{it appears}} that Iguanodon became more quadrupedal as it <b>got</b> <b>older</b> and heavier; {{juvenile}} I. bernissartensis have shorter arms than adults (60% of hindlimb length versus 70% for adults). When walking as a quadruped, the animal's hands would have been held so that the palms faced each other, as shown by iguanodontian trackways and the anatomy of this genus's arms and hands. The three toed pes (foot) of Iguanodon was relatively long, and when walking, both the hand and the foot would {{have been used in}} a digitigrade fashion (walking on the fingers and toes). The maximum speed of Iguanodon has been estimated at , which would have been as a biped; {{it would not have been}} able to gallop as a quadruped.|$|E
25|$|Rock was bused {{to schools}} in predominately white neighborhoods of Brooklyn, where he endured {{bullying}} and beatings from white students. As he <b>got</b> <b>older,</b> the bullying became worse and Rock’s parents {{pulled him out}} of James Madison High School. He {{dropped out of high}} school altogether, but he later earned a GED. Rock then worked menial jobs at various fast-food restaurants.|$|E

25|$|Forsberg's {{style of}} play led him to deal with several severe injuries. It has been said in the press that he was injury prone {{because he did not}} soften his game as he <b>got</b> <b>older.</b> In his 14 seasons as an NHL player, Forsberg missed an entire regular season and played in less than 90% of regular season games in eight other seasons.|$|E
25|$|Children's {{societies}} {{were one}} of the features of kibbutz life that most interested outsiders. In the heyday of children's societies, parents would only spend two hours a day, typically in the afternoon, with their children. In Kibbutz Artzi parents were explicitly forbidden to put their children to bed at night. As children <b>got</b> <b>older,</b> parents could go for days on end without seeing their offspring, other than through chance encounters somewhere in the grounds.|$|E
25|$|William Frawley {{was born}} of Irish ancestry in 1887 in Burlington, Iowa, the second son of four {{children}} of Michael A. Frawley (1857–1907) and Mary E. (Brady) Frawley (1859–1921). He attended Roman Catholic school and sang in the choir at St. Paul's Catholic Church. As he <b>got</b> <b>older,</b> he played small roles in local theater productions at the Burlington Opera House as well as performed in amateur shows, though his mother, a highly religious woman, discouraged such activities.|$|E

25|$|Born in Westfield Center, Ohio, Lois Youngen grew up {{dreaming of}} being a ballplayer while admiring the Cleveland Indians major league team, as well her {{interest}} in sports increased as she <b>got</b> <b>older.</b> It was {{in the years before}} Little League Baseball allowed girls to play. Her father, who had pitched for the Kent State University team in the 1920s, was also an avid baseball fanatic and encouraged Lois by teaching her how to swing and catch, while she accustomed to play sandlot ball with the neighborhood kids.|$|E
25|$|Molly Miles: Molly is the preteen {{daughter}} of Mr. and Mrs. Miles. Like {{everybody else in}} her family, she has red or auburn hair and freckles. She is {{a big fan of}} Star Wars, Clint Eastwood, and movies in general. She has a best friend, Tyler, on whom she develops a crush as she <b>got</b> <b>older,</b> though he is unaware of her feelings. Molly is the one who has probably warmed the most towards Zoey, aside from her mom, and is trying to be the best big sister to her.|$|E
25|$|At a {{very early}} ageas young as fiveJesperson would capture and torture animals. He enjoyed {{watching}} animals kill each other {{as well as the}} feeling he got from taking their lives. This continued as he <b>got</b> <b>older.</b> He would capture birds and stray cats and dogs around the trailer park where he lived with his family, severely beating the animals and then strangling them to death, something he claims his father was proud of him for. In the years following, Jesperson said he often thought about {{what it would be like}} to do the same to a human.|$|E

25|$|Raymond's son, David Belle, {{was born}} in 1973. He experimented with {{gymnastics}} and athletics but became increasingly disaffected with both school and the sports clubs. As he <b>got</b> <b>older,</b> he started to read the newspaper clippings that told of his father's exploits and was increasingly curious about what had enabled his father to accomplish these feats. Through conversations with his father, he realised that what he really wanted was a means to develop skills that {{would be useful to}} him in life, rather than just training to kick a ball or perform moves in a padded, indoor environment.|$|E
25|$|The {{average life}} span of an adult Vespula vulgaris {{is known to be}} around two weeks (14 days). There was a {{negative}} correlation found between the age of the worker Vespula vulgaris and their respective foraging speeds, and a positive correlation between their age and the amount of time each worker spent in the nest between each foraging trip. The foraging speed decreased as the workers aged and the time a worker spent in the nest between foraging trips increased as they <b>got</b> <b>older.</b> Wasps that are over 30 days, in fact, generally cease from foraging trips and spend all of their time guarding the entrance of the nest.|$|E
25|$|Another {{criticism}} {{of the show is}} that the actors' impressions, though passable on their radio show, were not at all convincing once they went to TV broadcasts. This problem got worse as the cast <b>got</b> <b>older.</b> The impressions were also often made fun of for being nothing more than thin caricatures of {{one or more of the}} politician or celebrity's characteristics (i.e. Roger Abbott's portrayal of Jean Chrétien as a twisted-mouthed man who ridiculously mispronounced English words with an over the top French Canadian accent, Jessica Holmes' impressions of Celine Dion as a diva and a whiny Liza Minnelli, and Craig Lauzon's impression of Stephen Harper as a robot).|$|E

25|$|From 1900, the two-digit {{numbers were}} prefixed with a 6 and their names were {{replaced}} with the inscription LBSC on their side tanks (for example, No.55 Stepney became No.655).

25|$|Bernstein's {{conducting}} {{was characterized}} by extremes of emotion with the rhythmic pulse of the music conveyed visually through his balletic podium manner. Musicians often reported that his manner in rehearsal {{was the same as}} in concert. As he <b>got</b> <b>older</b> his performances tended to be overlaid to a greater extent with a personal expressiveness which often divided critical opinion. Extreme examples of this style can be found in his Deutsche Grammophon recordings of Nimrod from Elgar's Enigma Variations (1982), the end of Mahler's 9th Symphony (1985), and the finale of Tchaikovsky's Pathetique Symphony (1986), where in each case the tempos are well below those typically chosen.|$|E
25|$|Her husband became both sleepy and inattentive as he <b>got</b> <b>older.</b> The {{sleepiness}} {{led to a}} {{car accident}} where {{no one was hurt}} but Henry was charged with dangerous driving. He became obsessed by the Norwegian ballerina Gerd Larsen and he would refuse to travel with West but wanted to return to London to be with Larsen. West initially considered this to be purely her husband's infatuation, but she came to think that Larsen was driven by money. At her husband's funeral she had the upsetting problem of Larsen's request to be amongst the mourners, even though she had only known him for 18 months. Henry's will left £5,000 for Larsen.|$|E
25|$|When he {{returned}} to England, Fowler suggested to Edward Ardern, his chief chemist, and William Lockett, the chief research assistant, that they research {{ways to reduce the}} growth of algae. They lowered the light levels, as sunlight often triggered the growth of algae, and kept the precipitant floc, which contained many bacteria, from one experiment to the next. Each subsequent experiment was more successful than the last, as the sludge showed better clarifying properties as it <b>got</b> <b>older.</b> Ardern and Lockett had discovered the Activated Sludge Process, which was soon being used worldwide. The research was carried out at Manchester University, and Fowler presented the results at the Grand Hotel in Manchester in April and November 1914.|$|E

25|$|Genie was the last, {{and second}} surviving, of four {{children}} of parents living in Arcadia, California, and was born in 1957 without any noted complications at a normal, healthy weight and size. Around {{the time of her}} birth, her father began to isolate himself and his family from other people. Her father decided that she was severely mentally retarded because she was late to walk due to treatment for a congenital hip dislocation, a view which intensified as she <b>got</b> <b>older,</b> and consequently disliked her. He tried not to talk to or pay attention to her and discouraged his wife and son, who was five years older than Genie, from doing so.|$|E
25|$|Harris, however, once he {{recovered}} from his humiliation in the Ern Malley hoax, {{made the best}} of his notoriety. From 1951 to 1955, he published another literary magazine, which he called Ern Malley's Journal. In 1961, as a gesture of defiance, he re-published the Ern Malley poems, maintaining that whatever McAuley and Stewart had intended to do, they had, in fact, produced some memorable poems. Harris {{went on to become a}} successful bookseller and newspaper columnist. His political views moved significantly to the right as he <b>got</b> <b>older</b> (he had been a member of the Communist Party at the time of the hoax), and in the mid-1960s, he claimed to sympathise with McAuley and Stewart's motivations in creating Ern Malley. Harris died in 1995.|$|E
25|$|Genie's {{mother was}} passive by nature and almost {{completely}} blind by this time. Her husband continued to beat her {{and threatened to}} kill her if she attempted to contact her parents, close friends who lived nearby, or the police. Genie's father also forced his son into silence, giving him {{instructions on how to}} keep his father's actions secret and beating him with increasing frequency and severity, and as he <b>got</b> <b>older</b> his father forced him to carry out progressively more of his abuse of Genie in the same manner. He felt completely powerless to do anything to stop it and feared severe retribution for attempting to intervene, and on multiple occasions tried to run away from the house. Genie's father was convinced Genie would die by age 12 and promised that, if she survived past that age, he would allow his wife to seek outside assistance for her, but he reneged when Genie turned 12 and her mother took no action for another year and a half.|$|E
