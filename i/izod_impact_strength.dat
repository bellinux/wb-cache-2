50|$|Impact strength, is the {{capability}} of the material to withstand a suddenly applied load and is {{expressed in terms of}} energy. Often measured with the <b>Izod</b> <b>impact</b> <b>strength</b> test or Charpy impact test, both of which measure the impact energy required to fracture a sample. Volume, modulus of elasticity, distribution of forces, and yield strength affect the impact strength of a material. In order for a material or object to have a high impact strength the stresses must be distributed evenly throughout the object. It also must have a large volume with a low modulus of elasticity and a high material yield strength.|$|E
50|$|Cavitation {{is common}} in epoxy resins and other craze {{resistant}} toughened polymers, and is prerequisite to shearing in <b>Izod</b> <b>impact</b> <b>strength</b> testing. During the deformation and fracture of a toughened polymer, cavitation of the strained rubber particles occurs in crazing-prone and non-crazing-prone plastics, including, ABS, PVC, nylon, high impact polystyrene, and CTBN toughened epoxies. Engineers use an energy-balance approach to model how particle size and rubber modulus factors influence material toughness. Both particle size and modulus show positive correlation with brittle-tough transition temperatures. They are both shown to affect the cavitation process occurring at the crack tip process zone early in deformation, preceding large-scale crazing and shear yielding.|$|E
50|$|A Notch in {{mechanical}} and materials engineering {{refers to a}} deliberately introduced v-shaped, u-shaped or circular defect in a planar material whereby stress is concentrated. Notch geometries {{play an important role}} in fracture mechanics and materials characterisation. Notches are most often found in impact testing of materials where the presence of a crack origin of controlled morphology in necessary in order to achieve standardised characterisation of fracture toughness. This is most commonly realized using the Charpy impact test , in which the impact of a pendulum hammer (striker) with a horizontal notched specimen and the height of its subsequent swing-through is used to infer the energy absorbed in fracture of the specimen. Impact testing of notched bars is also applied in the <b>Izod</b> <b>impact</b> <b>strength</b> test, typically applied to a cantilever configuration with a vertically positioned specimen. Charpy testing is conducting with U- or V-notches whereby the striker contacts the specimen directly behind the notch, whereas the now largely obsolete Izod method involves a circular notch facing the striker. Notched specimens find use in other characterization protocols, including tensile testing and fatigue.|$|E

HOPE granules and TS master-batch flakes were compounded on a corotating and intermeshing twin-screw extruder. The extrudate strands were cut into pellets and injection-molded to make test specimens. These specimens were tested for physicomechanical properties such as the tensile, flexural, and <b>impact</b> <b>strengths,</b> surface hardness, abrasion resistance, density, and water absorption and thermal characteristics such as the heat distortion temperature (HDT) and melt flow index (MEI).

40|$|Most high {{performance}} composites utilize thermosetting polymers as the matrix material. These low viscosity liquid prepolymers are easily impregnated into reinforcing fibers and then crosslinked {{to form a}} solid structure. Polymers which have a low viscosity at room temperature are ideally suited for low production runs because {{a wide variety of}} individualized shapes can be manufactured without a high degree of automation. As the demand for composites increases the need for high volume production techmques has developed. Thermoplastic polymers are more appropriately suited for automated produc-tion than thermosets because they require only the application of heat and pressure to form parts. No chemical reaction is required with thermoplastic composites. Thermoplastic matrix composites are not appropriate for low volume production runs because the high temperatures and pressures required to process the composites utilizes equipment which is appropriate for large production runs.

40|$|Due to {{the large}} volume {{consumption}} of polyolefins, {{the treatment of the}} resulting solid waste is becoming a major concern. One possible utilization of the polyolefin wastes is to form blends from recycled polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE). This study is a preliminary investigation on the impact fracture behaviour for the PP/PE blends. The impact testing method employed in this study includes the conventional and instrumented <b>Izod</b> <b>impact</b> tests, the instrumented Charpy impact test, and the instrumented drop weight plate impact test (IDWPIT). In both conventional and instrumented <b>Izod</b> <b>impact</b> testing, PP homopolymer and PP/LDPE blend have similar <b>impact</b> <b>strengths,</b> while PP/HDPE blend exhibits slightly lower <b>impact</b> <b>strength.</b> However, the instrumented Charpy impact test indicates that both PP/LDPE and PP/HDPE have similar <b>impact</b> <b>strengths,</b> and both are slightly lower than PP homopolymer.

40|$|Several design methodologies for {{automatically}} designing {{injection molds}} {{were developed to}} reduce warpage of injection molded parts. The part warpage was defined from warpage simulation, so as to represent various deformation behavior of the molded part. A concept for deliberately varying part wall thicknesses, within feasible dimensional tolerances to reduce the warpage, was introduced. The wall thicknesses, that minimized the effect of process fluctuation inherent to molding process, were obtained using the Taguchi method. The results of the example indicated that one can considerably reduce the warpage, and may also reduce material costs, by varying the wall thicknesses. A modified complex method was developed to optimize various domains in injection mold design. The modified complex method significantly reduced the part warpage with a moderate number of independent analysis evaluations for the proposed optimization of: part wall thicknesses; location and sizes of cooling channels; and process conditions. The runner system of multiple cavity molds was successfully balanced by adjusting the sizes of runners and gates using the iterative redesign method integrated with packing simulation in two case studies. A design technique for automatically determining the 2 Ì† 2 best 2 Ì† 2 gate location(s) of injection molds was presented {{in association with the}} three important parameters in gating design [...] the part warpage, the weld and meld line location at the critical areas, and the <b>Izod</b> <b>impact</b> <b>strength</b> at a specific region of the part.
