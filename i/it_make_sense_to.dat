[...] In Chile, Soda not only marked a whole generation with their looks, lyrics and music, but especially by way of the intense emotional relationship developed between the band and its fans, which was a decisive factor to [...] "de-nationalize" [...] the band and make it an expression, and not only young people in a particular country, but youth as a sector uniform social issues and common languages, something that rock and roll had not been achieved so far in the Spanish-speaking countries due to language barrier.|$|E

Cultural consensus theory is able to estimate competence from the agreement between subjects and then, answers are estimated by “weighting” individual responses by competence prior to aggregation.|$|E
50|$|However, a {{fundamental}} {{decision of the}} faith of the narrow-gauge railways had to be made. In 1963 and 1964, the government of East Germany conducted an efficiency study.

On May 14, 1964, the Ministerrat decided that all narrow-gauge railways of East Germany were to cease operations by 1975.

Elsewhere in the country the concept was already being refined, pioneered by Byerly Foods in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1973. Grand Union was already {{in the process of developing}} specialty supermarkets in the New York market, making Shopwell's decision to launch the Food Emporium format in 1979 a timely one.|$|E

Author Joanna Russ wrote in her 1985 analysis of K/S zines that slash fandom at the time consisted of around 500 core fans and was 100% female. She wrote that, [...] "K/S not only speaks to my condition. It is written in Female. I don't mean that literally, of course. What I mean is that I can read it without translating it from the consensual, public world, which is sexist, and unconcerned with women per se, and managing to make <b>it</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> me and my condition."

5000|$|Seeman (1959) {{recognized}} the {{problems inherent in}} defining the [...] "self", while post-modernism in particular has questioned the very possibility of pin-pointing what precisely [...] "self" [...] constitutes. Gergen (1996: 125) argues that: [...] "the traditional view of self versus society is deeply problematic and should {{be replaced by a}} conception of the self as always already immersed in relatedness. On this account, the individual's lament of 'not belonging' is partially a by-product of traditional discourses themselves". If the self is relationally constituted, does <b>it</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> speak of [...] "self-estrangement" [...] rather than [...] "social isolation"? Costas and Fleming (2009: 354) suggest that although the concept of self-estrangement [...] "has not weathered postmodern criticisms of essentialism and economic determinism well", the concept still has value if a Lacanian reading of the self is adopted. This can be seen as part of a wider debate on the concept of self between humanism and antihumanism, structuralism and post-structuralism, or nature and nurture.|$|E

5000|$|An {{incident}} with minor {{connections to the}} film heightened attitudes about the potent effects of media violence on young people. On December 7, 1982, Richard Delmer Boyer of El Monte, California, murdered Francis and Eileen Harbitz, an elderly couple in Fullerton, California, leading to the trial People v. Boyer (1989). The couple were stabbed 43 times by Boyer. According to the trial transcript, Boyer's defense was that he suffered from hallucinations in the Harbitz residence brought on by [...] "the movie Halloween II, which defendant had seen {{under the influence of}} PCP, marijuana, and alcohol." [...] The film was played for the jury, and a psychopharmacologist [...] "pointed out various similarities between its scenes and the visions defendant described."Boyer was found guilty and sentenced to death. The incident became known as the [...] "Halloween II Murders" [...] and was featured in a short segment on TNT's Monstervision, hosted by film critic Joe Bob Briggs. Following the trial, moral critics came to the defense of horror films and rejected calls to ban them. Thomas M.

But Mr Andrews questioned why the centre couldn't be expanded. [...] "I don't understand why the new architects … are so keen to knock everything down, he said. Why don't they just reuse things and add to them?"Authorities did not ring to advise him of the building's pending demolition - he learnt of it while reading the newspaper. Considered one of Australia's most important architects, Mr Andrews is renowned for the futuristic Intelsat Headquarters in Washington, the CN Tower in Toronto and the Graduate School of Design at Harvard University.In Australia, he designed the Cameron Offices in Canberra, the American Express Tower in Sydney and convention centres in Melbourne and Adelaide. The decision to destroy the semi-circular convention centre displayed [...] "a lack of understanding of history, of architecture or city planning", he said.An INSW spokeswoman said until the Lend Lease consortium was announced as the chosen developer last month, [...] "we didn't have a proposal to discuss with any architect".
