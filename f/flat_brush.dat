25|$|Still, Ōkyo's works remain Japanese. Unlike European painting, Ōkyo's {{images have}} very few midtones. Moreover, he follows the Eastern {{tradition}} in depicting objects with very little setting; often his pictures feature a single subject on a plain background. The result is a more immediate naturalism with a decorative and reflective feel. This was achieved through skillful brush handling; Ōkyo painted with a broad, <b>flat</b> <b>brush,</b> which he would load with more paint on one side. This created broad strokes that vary in paint coverage. Nature was not his only subject; many works by Ōkyo depict normal scenes from life in Kyoto's commercial area.|$|E
25|$|Seurat {{described}} {{one of the}} brush-stroke techniques {{he developed}} on this canvas as the balayé technique, wherein a <b>flat</b> <b>brush</b> is used to apply matte colours using strokes in a criss-crossing formation. These strokes become smaller as they approach the horizon. The balayé technique is not rolled out in a consistent manner across the painting, but is adapted where Seurat thought it appropriate. The foreground—for example—consists of a balayé network of strokes atop a more solid layer of underpaint, suggesting the flickering play of sunlight over the blades of grass. This chunky, cross-hatched brushstroke pattern is {{in contrast with the}} nearly horizontal, much thinner strokes that are used to depict the water, and is in even greater contrast with the smoothly rendered skin of the figures.|$|E

[...] "Filbert" [...] is a <b>flat</b> <b>brush</b> with rounded corners. [...] "Egbert" [...] is a very long, and rare, filbert brush.

40|$|Abstract Most present-day {{interactive}} paint applications {{lack the}} means of adequately capturing a user’s gestures and translating them into realistic and predictable strokes, despite the importance of such a mechanism. We present a novel brush design that adopts constrained energy optimization to deform the brush tuft according to the user’s input movement. It incorporates bidirectional paint transfer and an anisotropic friction model. The main advantage of our method {{is its ability to}} handle a wide range of brush tuft shapes that are animated using a freeform deformation lattice, which is associated with the tuft’s geometry. This way, almost no conditions or limitations are placed upon the appearance of the brush. Examples range from round brushes modeled as polygon meshes, to <b>flat</b> <b>brushes</b> with individual bristles. Less common deformable tools that are used to apply or remove paint on the canvas, like sponges, can be created as well. The model is integrated in our interactive painting system for creating images with watery paint.

This remedy is sure, and, having the advantage of simplicity and economy, should be generally known.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{examine the}} {{structure}} of densely grafted polymer layers grown from the surfaces of spherical nanoparticles over {{a broad range of}} graft densities and chain lengths. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments show that the hydrodynamic thickness of the polymer layer, h, scales as hN 4 / 5 for short chains and high grafting densities, that is, in the concentrated polymer brush (CPB) regime, whereas hN 3 / 5 for long enough chains (semidilute polymer brush, SDPB). The mean field theory ofWijmans and Zhulina is able to collapse approximately all of our data and those in the existing literature (even on other polymers) into an apparently universal form. From these findings, we conclude that the result h N 4 / 5 for the CPB is an intermediate crossover scaling, relevant to particles of finite curvature, analogous to the h N observed for concentrated <b>flat</b> <b>brushes.</b> Second, the scaling h N 3 / 5 uniquely reflects the increased space available to the chain segments as one proceeds away from a curved grafting surface. Under these situations, the chains experience less packing frustration as compared to a planar brush, and the semidilute polymer brush shows scaling behavior analogous to chains in good solvent, even though the chains are much more extended...|$|R

5000|$|It was {{generally}} agreed that six was a good age to train a boy. Though Lord Shaftesbury once encountered one {{of the age of}} four, they were considered to be too weak. A master sweep would have many apprentices, they would start the morning by roaming the streets calling out [...] "Soot -Oh, Sweep" [...] or another cry to let the house-owners know they were around; this would remind the owners of the dangers of un-swept chimneys. When engaged, the master sweep would fix a cloth over the fireplace, and the climbing boy would take off his boots and any excess clothes, then get behind it. The flue would be as tall as the house and twist several times, and its dimensions would be 14in by 9in.

Having reached the top he would slide back down at speed back to the floor and the soot pile. It was now his job to bag up the soot and carry it back to the master sweep's cart or yard.|$|E
40|$|The plaque-removing {{effect of}} a convex-shaped multitufted brush was {{compared}} with that of a conventional flat multitufted brush. Two group (five and seven dental students, respectively), well instructed in the modified Bass technique, participated in a blind, splitmouth, crossover study during two consecutive experimental periods of 96 hours of undisturbed plaque growth. After each of these periods, a supervised brushing session was performed, followed by toothpick utilization. Plaque removal was evaluated using the modified Navy Plaque Index (MNPI) and planimetry. A 4 % erythrosin solution was used as a disclosing agent. Planimetrically, the flat Oral B brush appeared significantly more effective than the convex shaped Ph brush (P less than 0. 001). This superiority was even enhanced after the use of toothpicks (P less than 0. 0005). The differences between the brushes, however, were too small to be detected by the less discriminating MNPI. Although it has been claimed that the convex brush could assure approximal plaque control, the results indicate that for the convex-shaped, {{as well as for the}} <b>flat</b> <b>brush,</b> an approximal aid is essential for good plaque control.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the susceptibility of dentin to brushing abrasion using four different toothbrushes (rotating-oscillating, sonic and two types of manual toothbrushes) with the same brushing forces. Dentin samples (n = 72) were selected from 72 impacted third molars. Half of the surface of dentin samples was covered with an adhesive tape, creating a protected and a freely exposed area in the same specimen. Brushing was performed with either a: sonic (Sonicare PowerUp, Philips GmbH, Hamburg, Germany), b: oscillating-rotating (Oral B Vitality Precisions Clean, Procter & Gamble, Schwalbach am Taunus, Germany) or two different manual toothbrushes c: <b>flat</b> trim <b>brush</b> head toothbrush (Dr. Best: Original, Glaxo-Smith-Kline, Bühl, Germany) and d: rippled-shaped brush head toothbrush (Blend-a-Dent, Complete V-Interdental, Blend-a-med, Schwalbach, Germany) in a custom made automatic brushing machine. The brushing force was set to 2 N and a whitening toothpaste (RDA = 150) was used. The simulation period was performed over a calculated period to mimic a brushing behavior of two times a day brushing for eight years and six months. Dentin loss was quantitatively determined by profilometry and statistically analyzed by Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney-U Test (p < 0. 05). The mean (standard deviation) surface loss was 21. 03 (± 1. 26) μm for the sonic toothbrush, 15. 71 (± 0. 85) μm for the oscillating-rotating toothbrush, 6. 13 (± 1. 24) μm for the manual toothbrush with <b>flat</b> trim <b>brush</b> head and 2. 50 (± 0. 43) μm for the manual toothbrush with rippled-shaped brush head.
