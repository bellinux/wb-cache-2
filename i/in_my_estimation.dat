500|$|Disney {{has been}} accused of anti-semitism, {{although}} none of his employeesincluding the animator Art Babbitt, who disliked Disney intenselyever accused him of making anti-semitic slurs or taunts. The Walt Disney Family Museum acknowledges that ethnic stereotypes common to films of the 1930s were included in some early cartoons. Disney donated regularly to Jewish charities, he was named [...] "1955 Man of the Year" [...] by the B'nai B'rith chapter in Beverly Hills, and his studio employed a number of Jews, some of whom were in influential positions. Gabler, the first writer to gain unrestricted access to the Disney archives, concludes that the available evidence does not support accusations of anti-semitism and that Disney was [...] "not [...] in the conventional sense that we think of someone as being an anti-Semite". Gabler concludes that [...] "though Walt himself, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>estimation,</b> was not anti-Semitic, nevertheless, he willingly allied himself with people who were anti-Semitic , and that reputation stuck. He was never really able to expunge it throughout his life". Disney distanced himself from the Motion Picture Alliance in the 1950s.|$|E

2500|$|Former Governor of New Mexico and 2012 Libertarian Party presidential {{candidate}} Gary Johnson visited Occupy Wall Street in October 2011 and expressed support, stating [...] "This {{country is not}} equal. We don't treat everyone equally. I {{would like to see}} us focus on the root cause, which is <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>estimation</b> politicians that are getting paid off. That's the corporatism and the outrage." ...|$|E

30|$|The Argentinean {{pension system}} is {{considered}} to be strict in terms of the requirements to be eligible for coverage at retirement age, which is a more significant problem for low-educated workers. However, the requirements to qualify for an AP are not so strict for a salaried worker (only 10 years), and both <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>estimations</b> and <b>in</b> the literature, essentially all workers are eligible for at least this pension.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is rather}} bravura {{for the sake}} of the musical spirit of the piece. And very Hungarian, too. This rhapsody may not be as showy as its predecessors, but <b>in</b> <b>my</b> humble <b>estimation</b> it is more daring, more {{advanced}} harmonically and ... difficult enough.|$|R
2500|$|In May 2012, Brownback {{signed into}} law {{one of the largest}} income tax cuts in Kansas' history -- the nation's largest state income tax cut (in percentage) since the 1990s. Brownback {{described}} the tax cuts as a live experiment, stating that [...] " [...] taxes, you need to get your overall rates down, and you need to get your social manipulation out of it, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>estimation,</b> to create growth. We'll see how it works. We'll have a real live experiment." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some of {{the things}} that have been said in the last few days have been almost slanderous, I think you should send a tape of that [...] to Alex Ferguson. That's what he wanted, isn't it? You don't say what Alex said about Leeds, you don't say that in football. He's gone down <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>estimation.</b> Football in this country is honest."..."I would love it if we beat them , love it. The battle is still on, they have not won it yet.|$|E
2500|$|Harrison became {{involved}} in a scandal when Jennings returned by refusing to vacate the governorship, claiming Jennings' actions had violated the state constitution and that Jennings was no longer eligible to be governor. The constitution forbade members of the state government to hold any position {{in the federal government}} at the same time. Harrison seized the state seal and setup his own governor's office from where he attempted to run the state. After a brief period of wrangling in the state legislature, the impeachment proceedings against Jennings failed and Harrison was forced to vacate the governors position and it was returned to Jennings. Harrison became very angry with the outcome and promptly resigned his position as governor in a brief letter stating: [...] "As the officers of the executive department of government and the General Assembly have refused to recognize and acknowledge that authority which according to my understanding is constitutionally attached to the office the name itself <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>estimation</b> is not worth retaining." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{regret to}} find, sir," [...] he said, [...] "that I have lost <b>my</b> place <b>in</b> <b>my</b> employer's <b>estimation.</b> The man to whom you confide the superintendence of your clerks and the {{transaction}} {{of your business}} has, I venture to think, some claim (under the present circumstances) to be trusted." ...|$|R
6000|$|When I {{remember}} that the first feeling she roused in me was nothing worthier of a professing Christian than astonishment, I drop <b>in</b> <b>my</b> own <b>estimation</b> {{to the level of}} a savage.

50|$|When you do {{that with}} footballers like he said about Leeds, {{and when you do}} things like that about a man like Stuart Pearce. I've kept really quiet but I'll tell you something, he went down <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>estimations</b> when he said that. We have not resorted to that. You can tell him now, we're still {{fighting}} for this title and he's got to go to Middlesbrough and get something. And I'll tell you, honestly, I will love it if we beat them. Love it. But it really has got to me. I've voiced it live, not in front of the press or anywhere. I'm not even going to the press conference. But the battle is still on and Man United have not won this yet.|$|R
2500|$|When {{the film}} was finished, a showing was planned at the Museum of Modern Art. The Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) {{surrounded}} the building, in a protest led by Elaine Parker. Gregg Kilday of the Los Angeles Times interviewed Larry Kardish, a museum staff member, and Kardish recalled that [...] "About halfway into the film about ten members of CORE showed up. They {{walked up and down}} the aisles and were very belligerent. <b>In</b> <b>my</b> <b>estimation</b> they were determined not to like the film. Apparently some of their friends had read the script of the movie and in their belief it was detrimental to the image of blacks [...] The question-and-answer session with Bakshi that followed quickly collapsed into the chaos of a shouting match." [...] Animation historian Jerry Beck did not recall any disturbance during the screening, but said there were racist catcalls during the question-and-answer session, and Bakshi's talk was cut short. [...] "It wasn't much of a madhouse, but it was kind of wild for the Museum of Modern Art." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 1840s, {{abolitionist}} newspapers printed {{interviews with}} and testimony of Oney Judge, a slave who {{escaped from the}} Washingtons in 1796. One such article, from the Granite Freeman, stated: [...] "she never heard Washington pray, and {{does not believe that}} he was accustomed to. 'Mrs. Washington used to read prayers, but I don't call that praying.'" [...] (It should be kept in mind that reading printed prayers is typical Anglican practice.) In another case, the Rev. Benjamin Chase, in a letter to The Liberator, wrote that [...] "She says that the stories told of Washington's piety and prayers, so far as she ever saw or heard while she was his slave, have no foundation. Card-playing and wine-drinking were the business at his parties, and he had more of such company Sundays than on any other day." [...] In both cases it should be borne in mind that these statements were intended to disparage Washington's character in so far as he held slaves; for example, Chase continues, [...] "I do not mention this as showing, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>estimation,</b> his anti-Christian character, so much as the bare fact of being a slaveholder, and not a hundredth part so much as trying to kidnap this woman; but, {{in the minds of the}} community, it will weigh infinitely more." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 1946, Cowles {{was hired}} as the head {{basketball}} coach at the University of Michigan, succeeding Bennie Oosterbaan. [...] Upon hiring Cowles, Michigan's athletic director Fritz Crisler said, [...] "In recommending Mr. Cowles, I feel that we are very fortunate. [...] He is absolutely <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>estimation</b> the best possible man for the position we could select." [...] In {{his first year at}} Michigan, he led the team to a 12–8 record. [...] The following year, he led the 1947–48 Michigan Wolverines to a 16–6 (.727) record. [...] The team won the 1948 Big Ten Conference championship. [...] In February 1948, as Cowles led the Wolverines to a turnaround season, the press focused on Cowles' success in Ann Arbor. [...] The Toledo Blade sports editor wrote:"Win, lose or draw in the red hot scramble for the Western Conference basketball title, the University of Michigan team has done so surprisingly well this season that Coach Ozzie Cowles is getting as much applause on the Ann Arbor campus as came to Fritz Crisler after the football season. [...] Michigan for years has prided itself on its well rounded athletic program. ... But until Cowles was lured away from Dartmouth to take charge of the Wolverine cagers, basketball wasn't going too well at Michigan. ... Those who should know what they are talking about say that Michigan is winning this year, not because of any great supply of sterling cage performers, but because of the personality and coaching finesse of Cowles." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope so too, Blagrove. I {{feel that}} I deserve what I have got, {{and it will}} be a lesson that I shall not forget. You have taken me down a great many pegs <b>in</b> <b>my</b> own <b>estimation,</b> and I shall try and make a fresh start when I am about again." ...|$|R
60|$|But though, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> refined friend's <b>estimation,</b> {{nothing could}} be more appropriate; in the mate's, it was the most monstrous of incongruities; and the {{offensive}} gown and cap were removed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oubliez les Professeurs." [...] So said Madame Beck. Madame Beck was a wise woman, but {{she should}} not have uttered those words. To do so was a mistake. That night she should have left me calm--not excited, indifferent, not interested, {{isolated}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> own <b>estimation</b> and that of others--not connected, even in idea, with this second person whom I was to forget.|$|R
60|$|Nevertheless, {{from that}} day, whales greatly fell <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>estimation.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... 'Oh!' cried Kate, looking upwards and {{clasping}} her hands; 'is not this, is not this, too cruel, {{too hard}} to bear! Is it not enough that I should have suffered as I have, night and day; that I should almost have sunk <b>in</b> <b>my</b> own <b>estimation</b> from very shame of having been brought into contact with such people; but must I also be exposed to this unjust and most unfounded charge!' ...|$|R
60|$|The {{new project}} {{which is to}} relieve us from all {{uncertainties}} {{for the next six}} months actually originated with me!

6000|$|... "The {{letter is}} an {{anonymous}} letter--a vile attempt to injure Sir Percival Glyde <b>in</b> <b>my</b> sister's <b>estimation.</b> It has so agitated and alarmed her that I {{have had the}} greatest possible difficulty in composing her spirits sufficiently {{to allow me to}} leave her room and come here. I know this is a family matter on which I ought not to consult you, and in which you can feel no concern or interest----" ...|$|R
60|$|I most cheerfully {{and truly}} declare {{that the failure}} of the {{undertaking}} has not lowered you a particle, while the qualities you developed in the effort have greatly heightened you <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>estimation.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have said}} {{nothing of the}} kind. But <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>estimation</b> they don't stand {{in the place of}} principles, or a profession, or birth, or country. I fancy there has been some {{conversation}} between you about your sister." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's what I {{think of}} him," [...] {{he said in}} a {{confidential}} whisper, shaking his head at me. [...] "He's gone, sir, gone, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>estimation.</b> Now what would you take to be a proof of madness, Mr. West?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{could not}} have {{maintained}} my degrading self-control--it is all that redeems me <b>in</b> <b>my</b> own <b>estimation</b> to know that I could not--if he had still continued to keep his eyes on my face. His wife's tigerish jealousy came to my rescue and forced his attention away from me the moment he possessed himself of my hand. Her cold blue eyes caught light, her dull white cheeks flushed into bright colour, she looked years younger than her age in an instant.|$|R
60|$|This last remark {{conveyed}} an aspersion of {{the most}} offensive kind on my management. I had too much self-respect to defend myself under so gross an imputation. Christian consideration for the helpless position of Miss Halcombe and Lady Glyde, and for the serious inconvenience which my sudden absence might inflict on them, alone prevented me from resigning my situation on the spot. I rose immediately. It would have lowered me <b>in</b> <b>my</b> own <b>estimation</b> to have permitted the interview to continue a moment longer.|$|R
6000|$|At {{the age of}} ten I {{had been}} taught to [...] "handle bundles" [...] on the stack, but now at {{fourteen}} I took my father's place as stacker, whilst he passed the sheaves and told me how to lay them. This exalted me {{at the same time}} that it increased my responsibility. It made a man of me--not only <b>in</b> <b>my</b> own <b>estimation,</b> but <b>in</b> the eyes of my boy companions to whom I discoursed loftily on the value of [...] "bulges" [...] and the advantages of the stack over the rick.|$|R
60|$|The lady's temper {{looked at}} {{me out of the}} lady's {{shifting}} eyes, and hid itself again in a moment. She set herself right <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>estimation</b> by taking the whole blame of our little misunderstanding on her own innocent shoulders.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you, squire, thank you," [...] {{said the}} doctor. [...] "It {{is very good}} of you to say that. She is a good girl, and if Frank chooses to take her, he will, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>estimation,</b> have made a good choice." ...|$|E
6000|$|Well, I let go all holts then, like I was shot. It was {{the most}} {{astonishing}} speech I ever heard--and I'm bound to say Tom Sawyer fell considerable <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>estimation.</b> Only I couldn't believe it. Tom Sawyer a NIGGER-STEALER! ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{turned to}} Clara. [...] "I suppose, my love, {{you want me}} no longer. While I settle my own matters of business, you can arrange about the bookcases with your brother. Whatever you wish, I shall be glad to do." [...] And {{he left the room}} without {{speaking}} to me, or looking at me again. I sank into a chair, feeling disgraced <b>in</b> <b>my</b> own <b>estimation</b> by the last words he had spoken to me. His trust <b>in</b> <b>my</b> honour was his only guarantee against my deceiving him. As I thought over that declaration, every syllable of it seemed to sear my conscience; to brand Hypocrite on my heart.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{referred}} to {{nothing of the}} sort. I can hear {{of the loss of}} the Moonstone, let who will speak of it, without feeling degraded <b>in</b> <b>my</b> own <b>estimation.</b> If the story of the Diamond ever comes to light, it will be known that I accepted a dreadful responsibility; it will be known that I involved myself in the keeping of a miserable secret--but it will be as clear as the sun at noon-day that I did nothing mean! You have misunderstood me, Godfrey. It's my fault for not speaking more plainly. Cost me what it may, I will be plainer now. Suppose you were not in love with me? Suppose you were in love with some other woman?" ...|$|R
6000|$|My {{subordinate}} had {{the audacity}} to look at me, and then to stuff his pocket-handkerchief into his mouth. I scorned to {{pay any attention to}} him. After I had discovered that the man [...] "Jack" [...] was the bridegroom, and that the man Jay acted the part of father, and gave away the bride, I left the church, followed by my men, and joined the other subordinate outside the vestry door. Some people <b>in</b> <b>my</b> position would now have felt rather crestfallen, and would have begun to think that they had made a very foolish mistake. Not the faintest misgiving of any kind troubled me. I did not feel in the slightest degree depreciated <b>in</b> <b>my</b> own <b>estimation.</b> And even now, after a lapse of three hours, my mind remains, I am happy to say, in the same calm and hopeful condition.|$|R
