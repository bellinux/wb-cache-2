On November 5, 2011 {{she made her}} debut for All Japan Pro Wrestling in Taiwan, teaming with Black Bushi and Dark Dragon in a six-person tag team match, where they were defeated by Bushi, Makoto and Último Dragón. The following day, Melissa defeated Makoto in what was billed as the first ever women's wrestling match in Taiwan. In December 2011, Anderson took part in TNA's Indian promotion Ring Ka King, performing as both Alissa Flash and Raisha Saeed.|$|E
50|$|Canon also {{produced}} a dedicated macro ring flash for the camera, the ML-2. This supports TTL and manual models only, and contains two flash tubes, one on either side, {{which can be}} fired separately or together. The system consists of the <b>flash</b> <b>ring</b> itself, which fits onto {{the end of the}} lens, and a control unit which screws into the hot shoe atop the camera. The later ML-3 ring flash, introduced for the EOS system cameras, also supports the T90.|$|E

5000|$|Barry Allen {{elements}} of the JL/JLU animated Flash: he's the only existing Flash in the series, he was never Kid Flash (although in the episode [...] "Flash and Substance", a Kid Flash costume is briefly seen {{on display in the}} Flash museum). He lives in Central City, Barry Allen's hometown as opposed to Keystone City, Wally West's hometown. He is a police scientist, which was Barry Allen's job in the comics. His origin is also that of Barry Allen's. This Flash also fought some of Barry Allen's enemies throughout the series, such as Captain Cold, Mirror Master, Captain Boomerang, Gorilla Grodd, and The Trickster. Wally also has the <b>Flash</b> <b>ring,</b> which was invented by Barry Allen in the comics, to store his Flash costume in.|$|E
5000|$|The Flash {{appears in}} the {{animated}} film Justice League: Doom, voiced by Michael Rosenbaum who previously voiced Wally West in the DC animated universe. In this film, Flash's identity is clearly stated as Barry Allen as a Central City detective addresses Allen by name while he's working a crime scene as a CSI. He also has his trademark <b>Flash</b> <b>ring</b> and is also more serious than all previous animated incarnations of Flash. In the film, Mirror Master is the villain chosen by Vandal Savage to fight Flash and Mirror Master does so by tricking Flash into sticking his hand in a [...] "hostage box" [...] to save an old woman. Only the woman was a hologram and Flash {{ended up with a}} speed sensitive bomb on his wrist. Batman eventually has him vibrate through an iceberg to save him and he goes on {{with the rest of the}} JLA to fight the Legion of Doom.|$|E

40|$|Multi-flash (MF) {{photography}} {{offers a}} number of advantages over regular photography including removing the effects of illumination, color and texture as well as highlighting occlusion contours. Implementing MF photog-raphy on mobile devices, however, is challenging due to their restricted form factors, limited synchronization capabilities, low computational power and limited interface connectivity. In this paper, we present a novel mobile MF technique that overcomes these limitations and achieves comparable performance as conventional MF. We first construct a mobile <b>flash</b> <b>ring</b> using four LED lights and design a special mobile flash-camera synchronization unit. The mobile device’s own flash first triggers the <b>flash</b> <b>ring</b> via an auxiliary photocell. The mobile flashes are then triggered consecutively {{in sync with the}} mobile camera’s frame rate, to guarantee that each image is cap-tured with only one LED flash on. To process the acquired MF images, we further develop a class of fast mobile image processing techniques for image registration, depth edge extraction, and edge-preserving smoothing. We demonstrate our mobile MF on {{a number of}} mobile imaging applications, including occlusion detection, imag...|$|E

50|$|Some lenses have {{built-in}} (ring-)flash lights for shadow free macro photography, {{but there}} are also accessory <b>ring</b> <b>flashes</b> available.|$|R
50|$|A <b>ring</b> <b>flash</b> is a {{circular}} photographic flash that fits around a camera lens. Unlike point light sources, a <b>ring</b> <b>flash</b> provides even illumination with few shadows {{visible in the}} resulting photographs because {{the origin of the}} light is very close to (and surrounds) the optical axis of the lens. It was invented by Lester A. Dine in 1952 for use in dental photography, but now is commonly used in applications such as macro, portrait and fashion photography.|$|R
50|$|A macro <b>ring</b> <b>flash</b> {{typically}} {{consists of}} a power and control unit mounted on a hot shoe, and a circular flash unit mounted {{on the front of}} a lens. Power is supplied by batteries in the shoe-mount unit and a cable conveys power and control signals to the circular flash unit. In larger <b>ring</b> <b>flashes,</b> which are typically used for fashion photography, power may be supplied by an external battery or line power supply, or the power supply and light may be combined in one unit.|$|R

50|$|SES NOU RODADESThis may be {{the prettiest}} and most {{important}} dance in our repertoire. Parties culminate with this dance {{and it is a}} nuptial ceremony. The newly married couple dance in a series of circles, separating and then meeting again in the centre, where they link elbows. After the sixth turn, the wife <b>flashes</b> her <b>rings</b> (twenty-four in total) that her husband has presented her.|$|R

50|$|The HVL-RLAM and HVL-RL1 are {{ring-shaped}} LED continuous lights for {{use with}} video.

The Sony flash system does not include a <b>ring</b> <b>flash,</b> but the Minolta R-1200 and 1200 AF <b>ring</b> <b>flash</b> heads can be used with the Minolta Macro Flash Controller MFC-1000 on Sony DSLRs as well, whereas the older Minolta Control Unit 1200 AF is not compatible with digital cameras. The MFC-1000 also accepts the Minolta Twin Flash T-2400 as well as the flash head of the Sony HVL-MT24AM twin flash, but not vice versa.|$|R

He was the U.S. Nationals Champion at the IJA Summer Festival in 1984. He is {{the first person to}} have {{qualified}} 10 objects in competition, juggling 10 rings for 20 catches at the IJA Summer Festivals in 1996 and 2002. He currently holds the world record for being the only person to <b>flash</b> 13 <b>rings.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I forgot that; never mind, it deepens the mystery; {{and after}} this performance, I'm {{prepared}} for any enormity. It's my fate; I submit." [...] said Amy, tragically, as {{she waved her}} hand to and fro, pleased with the <b>flash</b> of the <b>ring.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Other {{devices are}} {{available}} that project {{light in a}} fashion similar to <b>ring</b> <b>flashes.</b> For example, flash diffusers have no light source of their own, but instead mount {{in front of a}} conventional flash unit and transmit the light to a ring-shaped diffuser {{at the front of the}} lens. Some other passive light modifiers can shape the light from a conventional shoe-mounted flash into that of a <b>ring</b> <b>flash.</b> These adapters use diffusers and reflectors to [...] "bend" [...] the light in an arc around the lens axis and then emit the light from that arc. These devices maintain any through-the-lens (TTL) lighting functions that are shared by the camera and flash because the timing of the light has not changed.|$|R
50|$|Light {{is usually}} {{generated}} {{by one or}} more flash tubes or by multiple LEDs. In some flash units with multiple flash tubes, each flash tube can be independently enabled. Some <b>ring</b> <b>flashes</b> have focusing lenses that result in ideal light distribution at a particular distance from the subject.|$|R
50|$|The {{record for}} the most juggling rings juggled (where each prop is thrown and caught at least twice) is ten rings for forty-seven catches, by Anthony Gatto in 2006. The {{record for the}} most juggling <b>rings</b> <b>flashed</b> (where each prop is thrown and caught once) is thirteen, by Albert Lucas in 2002.|$|R
2500|$|French level {{crossings}} (passage à niveau in French) {{usually have a}} single red light on a circle backboard, bells and automatic half barriers.

5000|$|Ring flashes, with flash tubes {{arranged}} {{in a circle around}} the front of the lens, can be helpful in lighting at close distances. [...] Ring lights have emerged, using white LEDs to provide a continuous light source for macro photography, however they are not as bright as a <b>ring</b> <b>flash</b> and the white balance is very cool.|$|R

50|$|The maximum 0.5x {{magnification}} {{means this}} lens is {{more suitable for}} photographing documents, products and objects at least 5cm (2 inches) wide than small insects etc. The outer barrel is grooved to accept Canon's MR-14 <b>ring</b> <b>flash</b> {{which can be used}} as the principal light source for close-ups or as on-axis fill lighting for portraits. The six-blade diaphragm provides reasonably good out-of-focus blur (bokeh) for portrait work.|$|R
500|$|Blue-ringed {{octopuses}} are venomous. [...] They {{spend much}} of their time hiding in crevices whilst displaying effective camouflage patterns with their dermal chromatophore cells. [...] However, if they are provoked, they quickly change colour, becoming bright yellow with each of the 50-60 <b>rings</b> <b>flashing</b> bright iridescent blue within a third of a second. It is often stated this is an aposematic warning display, the hypothesis has rarely if ever been tested.|$|R
50|$|Limited {{depth of}} field is an {{important}} consideration in macro photography. Depth of field is extremely small when focusing on close objects. A small aperture (high f-number) is often required to produce acceptable sharpness across a three-dimensional subject. This requires either a slow shutter speed, brilliant lighting, or a high ISO. Auxiliary lighting (such as from a flash unit), preferably a <b>ring</b> <b>flash</b> is often used (see Lighting section).|$|R
