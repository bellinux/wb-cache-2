5|$|A mosaic {{mutation}} {{may or may}} not be inheritable, {{depending on}} the cell populations affected. Though this is not always the case, genetic mutations can occur spontaneously in one sex cell of a parent during <b>gametogenesis.</b> In these cases, called germline mutations, the mutation will be present in the single-celled zygote conceived from the affected sperm or egg cell, and the condition can be inherited by the next generation.|$|E
5|$|While small interfering RNAs (siRNA; 20-25nt) {{are often}} {{produced}} by breakdown of viral RNA, {{there are also}} endogenous sources of siRNAs. siRNAs act through RNA interference in a fashion similar to miRNAs. Some miRNAs and siRNAs can cause genes they target to be methylated, thereby decreasing or increasing transcription of those genes. Animals have Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNA; 29-30nt) that are active in germline cells and {{are thought to be}} a defense against transposons and play a role in <b>gametogenesis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Brexia {{has been}} {{assumed to be}} closely related to Escallonia. These two genera however differ in many details of the sporogenesis, <b>gametogenesis</b> and fertilisation, such as the ripe pollen which is two-celled in Escallonia and three-celled in Brexia.|$|E
25|$|Hybridogenesis is {{a mode of}} {{reproduction}} of hybrids. Hybridogenetic hybrids (for example AB genome), usually females, during <b>gametogenesis</b> exclude one of parental genomes (A) and produce gametes with unrecombined genome of second parental species (B), instead of containing mixed recombined parental genomes. First genome (A) is restored by fertilization of these gametes with gametes from the first species (AA, sexual host, usually male).|$|E
25|$|The term {{is used to}} {{describe}} the relationship of similar chromosomes that pair at mitosis and meiosis. In a diploid, one homolog is derived from the male parent (sperm) and one is derived from the female parent (egg). During meiosis and <b>gametogenesis,</b> homologous chromosomes pair and exchange genetic material by recombination, leading to the production of sperm or eggs with chromosome haplotypes containing novel genetic variation.|$|E
25|$|Geoducks spawn {{from spring}} to late {{summer in the}} wild, peaking in June and July. Because of this timing, {{an equal number of}} male and female clams are {{collected}} starting in the early fall when <b>gametogenesis</b> commences. The clams are placed in milk crates and maintained in polyethylene fish totes supplied with flowing seawater (10-12nbsp&°C) for several weeks. Microalgae is added as feed and regular cleaning is carried out to remove biodeposits.|$|E
25|$|Spermatozoa are {{the mature}} male gametes in many sexually {{reproducing}} organisms. Thus, eggtogenesis is the male version of <b>gametogenesis,</b> {{of which the}} female equivalent is oogenesis. In mammals it occurs in the seminiferous tubules of the male testes in a stepwise fashion. Spermatogenesis is highly dependent upon optimal conditions for the process to occur correctly, and is essential for sexual reproduction. DNA methylation and histone modification have been implicated in the regulation of this process. It starts at puberty and usually continues uninterrupted until death, although a slight decrease can be discerned in the quantity of produced sperm with increase in age (see Male infertility).|$|E
25|$|The human Y {{chromosome}} {{is particularly}} exposed to high mutation rates {{due to the}} environment in which it is housed. The Y chromosome is passed exclusively through sperm, which undergo multiple cell divisions during <b>gametogenesis.</b> Each cellular division provides further opportunity to accumulate base pair mutations. Additionally, sperm are stored in the highly oxidative environment of the testis, which encourages further mutation. These two conditions combined put the Y chromosome at a greater risk of mutation {{than the rest of the}} genome. The increased mutation risk for the Y chromosome is reported by Graves as a factor 4.8. However, her original reference obtains this number for the relative mutation rates in male and female germ lines for the lineage leading to humans.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{cases have}} been {{reported}} of people with Down syndrome having children with trisomy 21. [...] In these cases (all from mothers), the ovaries were trisomy 21, leading to a secondary nondisjunction during <b>gametogenesis</b> and a gamete with an extra chromosome 21. [...] Such Down syndrome trisomies are indistinguishable from Down syndrome trisomy created through meiotic nondisjunction.|$|E
2500|$|Studies have {{demonstrated}} the function of WRKY transcription factors in plant development. [...] Successful male <b>gametogenesis</b> and tolerance to interploidy crosses both require WRKY transcription factors. [...] Embryo and root development also require WRKY transcription factors. [...] WRKYs also contribute to determination of seed size and seed coat color in Arabidopsis. [...] Furthermore, WRKY transcription factors {{have been shown to}} play key roles in regulation of developmentally programmed leaf senescence.|$|E
2500|$|Due to the {{phenomenon}} of genomic imprinting, maternal and paternal genomes are differentially marked and must be properly reprogrammed every time they pass through the germline. Therefore, during <b>gametogenesis,</b> [...] primordial germ cells must have their original biparental DNA methylation patterns erased and re-established based on {{the sex of the}} transmitting parent. After fertilization the paternal and maternal genomes are once again demethylated and remethylated (except for differentially methylated regions associated with imprinted genes). This reprogramming is likely required for totipotency of the newly formed embryo and erasure of acquired epigenetic changes.|$|E
2500|$|Mother cells {{give rise}} to progeny buds by mitotic divisions, but undergo replicative aging over {{successive}} generations and ultimately die. [...] However, when a mother cell undergoes meiosis and <b>gametogenesis,</b> lifespan is reset. [...] The replicative potential of gametes (spores) formed by aged cells {{is the same as}} gametes formed by young cells, indicating that age-associated damage is removed by meiosis from aged mother cells. This observation suggests that during meiosis removal of age-associated damages leads to rejuvenation. [...] However, the nature of these damages remains to be established.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "libertine bubble theory" [...] {{proposes that}} meiotic sex evolved in proto-eukaryotes {{to solve a}} problem that {{bacteria}} did not have, namely a large amount of DNA material, occurring in an archaic step of proto-cell formation and genetic exchanges. So that, rather than providing selective advantages through reproduction, sex could {{be thought of as a}} series of separate events which combines step-by-step some very weak benefits of recombination, meiosis, <b>gametogenesis</b> and syngamy. Therefore, current sexual species could be descendants of primitive organisms that practiced more stable exchanges in the long term, while asexual species have emerged, much more recently in evolutionary history, from the conflict of interest resulting from anisogamy.|$|E
2500|$|As {{genes are}} capable of {{producing}} individual altruism, they {{are capable of}} producing conflict among genes inside the genome of one individual. This phenomenon is called intragenomic conflict and arises when one gene promotes its own replication in detriment to other genes in the genome. The classic example is segregation distorter genes that cheat during meiosis or <b>gametogenesis</b> and end up in {{more than half of the}} functional gametes. These genes persist even resulting in reduced fertility. Egbert Leigh compared the genome to [...] "a parliament of genes: each acts in its own self-interest, but if its acts hurt the others, they will combine together to suppress it" [...] to explain the relative low occurrence of intragenomic conflict.|$|E
2500|$|DNA {{methylation}} {{patterns are}} largely erased and then re-established between generations in mammals. Almost {{all of the}} methylations from the parents are erased, first during <b>gametogenesis,</b> and again in early embryogenesis, with demethylation and remethylation occurring each time. [...] Demethylation in early embryogenesis occurs in the preimplantation period in two stages – initially in the zygote, then {{during the first few}} embryonic replication cycles of morula and blastula. A wave of methylation then takes place during the implantation stage of the embryo, with CpG islands protected from methylation. [...] This results in global repression and allows housekeeping genes to be expressed in all cells. In the post-implantation stage, methylation patterns are stage- and tissue-specific, with changes that would define each individual cell type lasting stably over a long period.|$|E
50|$|The {{production}} of gametes takes {{place within the}} gonads through {{a process known as}} <b>gametogenesis.</b> <b>Gametogenesis</b> occurs when certain types of germ cells undergo meiosis to split the normal diploid number of chromosome(n=46) into haploids cells containing only 23 chromosomes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gametogenesis</b> is a {{biological}} {{process by which}} diploid or haploid precursor cells undergo cell division and differentiation to form mature haploid gametes. Depending on the biological life cycle of the organism, <b>gametogenesis</b> occurs by meiotic division of diploid gametocytes into various gametes, or by mitotic division of haploid gametogenous cells. For example, plants produce gametes through mitosis in gametophytes. The gametophytes grow from haploid spores after sporic meiosis. The existence of a multicellular, haploid phase in the life cycle between meiosis and <b>gametogenesis</b> is {{also referred to as}} alternation of generations.|$|E

5000|$|Animals, {{including}} mammals, produce gametes (sperm and egg) through meiosis in gonads (testicles {{in males}} and ovaries in females).

5000|$|Meiosis is {{a central}} feature of <b>gametogenesis,</b> but the {{adaptive}} function of meiosis is currently a matter of debate. A key event during meiosis is the pairing of homologous chromosomes and recombination (exchange of genetic information) between homologous chromosomes.

To explain the adaptive function of meiosis (as well as of <b>gametogenesis</b> and the sexual cycle), some authors emphasize diversity, and others emphasize DNA repair ...|$|E
