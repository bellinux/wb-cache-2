2500|$|Developed {{countries}} adopted milk pasteurization {{to prevent}} such disease and loss of life, {{and as a result}} milk is now widely considered one of the safest foods. [...] A traditional form of pasteurization by scalding and straining of cream to increase the <b>keeping</b> <b>qualities</b> of butter was practiced in Great Britain before 1773 and was introduced to Boston in the British Colonies by 1773, although it was not widely practiced in the United States for the next 20 years. It was still being referred to as a [...] "new" [...] process in American newspapers as late as 1802. Pasteurization of milk was suggested by Franz von Soxhlet in 1886. In the early 20th century, Milton Joseph Rosenau established the standards (i.e. low temperature, slow heating at 60°C (140°F) [...] for 20 minutes) for the pasteurization of milk while at the United States Marine Hospital Service, notably in his publication of The Milk Question (1912). [...] States in the U.S.A. began enacting mandatory dairy pasteurization laws with the first in 1947, and in 1973 the U.S. Federal Government required pasteurization of milk used in any interstate commerce.|$|E

40|$|A generic {{model on}} the <b>keeping</b> <b>quality</b> of {{perishable}} produce was formulated, {{based on the}} kinetics of the decrease of individual quality attributes. The model includes the effects of temperature, chilling injury and different levels of initial quality and of <b>quality</b> acceptance limits. <b>Keeping</b> <b>quality</b> of perishable produce {{was found to be}} inversely proportional to the sum of the rates of the separate reactions leading to quality decrease, irrespective of the kinetics of the decrease. In its static form, the model is useful for statistical analysis and for predicting <b>keeping</b> <b>quality</b> at constant conditions. In its dynamic form, it predicts <b>keeping</b> <b>quality</b> as a function of temperature, initial quality and quality acceptance limits. These limits are defined by personal, regional or national preferences. Calculation of the dynamic model requires only one simple numerical integral, even for multiple limiting attributes. Due to the fast numerical integration of that one integral, optimization of distribution chains with respect to produce quality over a broad time and space region becomes economically feasible.

40|$|In {{agricultural}} products, variation {{exists in}} quality attributes between batches. Examples of this biological variation {{are well known}} and the general response is trying to suppress {{it as much as}} possible; to create uniformity using pre- and postharvest methods. This thesis shows a methodology that takes advantage of the biological variation, instead of treating it as a nuisance. This biological variation methodology was applied to understand the expected <b>keeping</b> <b>quality</b> of batches. The methodology currently consists of three steps. Firstly, repeated non-destructive measurements of quality properties of individuals need to be applied to find out how the quality attribute changes over time without having to worry about biological variation. Secondly, kinetic models need to be constructed that show the quality attribute changing over time as a combination of simultaneously occurring processes that, ideally, have a strong physiological background. The last step consists of translating the kinetic model that describes the behaviour of the quality attribute of individuals to batches using stochastics. This methodology is applied for cucumbers and strawberries. Cucumber. The <b>keeping</b> <b>quality</b> for a cucumber, defined as the time the colour remains acceptable to the consumer, depends {{on the state of the}} chlorophyll metabolism. A generic model was build that describes the postharvest colour behaviour in time and temperature for individual cucumbers, irrespective of growing conditions and cultivar. The model enables prediction on the batch <b>keeping</b> <b>quality,</b> on the basis of initial colour measurements only.   Strawberry. Postharvest life of strawberries is largely limited by Botrytis cinerea infection. A colour model was built that describes the simultaneous development of the red colour and the anti-fungal function of individual strawberries over time. Batch <b>keeping</b> <b>quality</b> predictions could be derived on the basis of initial colour measurements or from the time between harvest dates. Batch model. The batch model describes the influence of one source of biological variation, here assumed to be variation in light conditions during the preharvest period, on the distribution of precursor concentrations by combining (product specific) kinetic models and a generic stochastic part. The batch model described batch behaviour in terms of current maturity, biological variation and maximal maturity towards <b>keeping</b> <b>quality</b> of cucumbers and strawberries. Applications of biological methodology may be numerous: proposing protocols for <b>keeping</b> <b>quality</b> predictions, characterisation of cultivar specific influences on <b>keeping</b> <b>quality</b> or, in general, starting of a new field that is concerned with the 'hidden' information that is present in all biological batches...|$|R

40|$|Postharvest life of {{strawberries}} is largely limited by Botrytis cinerea infection. It {{is assumed that}} there are two factors influencing the batch keeping quality: the Botrytis pressure and the resistance of the strawberry to infection. The latter factor will be discussed in this article. A colour model is presented that describes the development of red colour and anti-fungal function of individual strawberries over time. The model was fitted to colour data from strawberries grown at two different nutrient densities (EC) and stored per batch at 5, 10 or 16 °C and constant vapour pressure deficit after harvest. A batch was defined as all strawberries from one EC and one harvest. Spoilage per batch was recorded daily during storage. The fitted initial spoilage per batch was found to relate to the fitted average amount of precursor of both the colour and the anti-fungal compounds. Batch <b>keeping</b> <b>quality</b> could be derived from the initial batch colour distributions for the low nutrient batches. Also, batch <b>keeping</b> <b>quality</b> correlated highly with the time between harvest dates for the low EC batches. An explanation for the ability to link colour distributions to <b>keeping</b> <b>quality</b> without having to use a term describing the pH is presented from pigment HPLC measurements of sub-batches. Indications that the colour distributions of high EC batches may be subject to substantial co-pigmentation are presented. For a practical implementation of predicting <b>keeping</b> <b>quality</b> of batches additional research is needed, especially regarding different Botrytis pressures between greenhouses...|$|R
