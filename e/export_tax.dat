5|$|Nevertheless, raisin exports {{were the}} most {{important}} export of the islands during the Venetian rule. By the early 18th century Zante, Cephalonia, and part of Ithaca had become a major centre of the currant trade.

Another measure was the , a heavy <b>export</b> <b>tax</b> for foreign ships.|$|E
5|$|Further work on {{the model}} has shown that a slight {{difference}} in assumptions can produce completely different results. For example, Eaton and Grossmann showed that if the firms compete in prices rather in quantities (Bertrand competition rather than Cournot) then the optimal policy is an <b>export</b> <b>tax</b> rather a subsidy – a policy rarely used in practice, politically unpopular and contrary to protectionist sentiment which generally touted New Trade Theory models as an argument for their favored policies.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} economic, poverty, and income {{inequality}} impacts of both world and domestic trade reform in Argentina, {{with a special}} focus on <b>export</b> <b>taxes.</b> Argentina offers an interesting case study as the only large agricultural exporter that has, at many points in its history, applied <b>export</b> <b>taxes</b> to several of its agricultural products. The paper combines results from a global economy-wide model (World Bank?s LINKAGE model), a national CGE model, and microsimulations. The results suggest that full liberalization of world trade (including subsidies and import <b>taxes,</b> but not <b>export</b> <b>taxes),</b> both for agricultural and non-agricultural goods, reduces poverty and inequality in Argentina. However, if only agricultural goods are included, indicators for poverty and inequality do not improve and even deteriorate somewhat.

5|$|Marie Thursby {{has used}} an {{extended}} {{version of the}} model to examine international trade in wheat, 60% of which is produced by the United States and Canada. Thursby includes marketing boards, possibility of a monopsony, {{and a variety of}} government policies in the analysis. She finds that while there are significant economies of scale in the industry, the barriers to entry are not high and regardless of the extent of market power that US firms have in the industry, the optimal policy is actually an <b>export</b> <b>tax,</b> rather than a subsidy.|$|E
5|$|The {{basic model}} can be {{extended}} to incorporate a supra-game played by {{the governments of the}} respective countries. In this case, each government chooses the level of subsidy it will provide to its firm, taking the other government's action as given, and anticipating the reaction of the firms (in terms of quantity produced) to the subsidy. Brander and Spencer show that in the resulting Nash equilibrium the governments choose a level of subsidy that is too high and hence they do not manage to maximize social welfare. In fact, if the good produced is not consumed domestically, then the optimal level of subsidy is negative – an <b>export</b> <b>tax.,</b> where m is a competitively produced numéraire good This is because the total quantity produced in the Cournot and the Stackelberg equilibrium is higher than the profit maximizing collusive monopoly level of output. Since both the home and foreign firm are producing for a third market, an <b>export</b> <b>tax</b> could reduce the total quantity produced down to the monopoly level, thus increasing both firms' profits. In that way the governments can effect a collusive outcome between their firms, at the expanse of the third country which imports the good.|$|E
5|$|The {{convention}} {{spent several}} weeks in August in debating {{the powers of}} Congress. Although Mason was successful {{in some of his}} proposals, such as placing the state militias under federal regulation, and a ban on Congress passing an <b>export</b> <b>tax,</b> he lost on some that he deemed crucial. These losses included the convention deciding to allow importation of slaves to continue to at least 1800 (later amended to 1808) and to allow a simple majority to pass navigation acts that might require Virginians to export their tobacco in American-flagged ships, when it might be cheaper to use foreign-flagged vessels. The convention also weakened the requirement that money bills begin in the House and not be subject to amendment in the Senate, eventually striking the latter clause after debate that stretched fitfully over weeks. Despite these defeats, Mason continued to work constructively to build a constitution, serving on another grand committee that considered customs duties and ports.|$|E
40|$|<b>Export</b> <b>taxes</b> are {{commonly}} imposed by commodity producers, {{most of whom}} are developing countries, in order to promote the development of downstream processing industries, to encourage foreign direct investments, to stabilise export earnings, but also to protect natural resources and the environment. Besides, <b>export</b> <b>taxes</b> are a major source of government revenue in developing countries. <b>Export</b> <b>taxes</b> {{do not seem to be}} prohibited in the WTO and any attempt to regulate them during the Doha Development Round has met with strong opposition by developing countries.

5|$|The Abir Company entered {{liquidation}} in 1898 as a {{means of}} tax avoidance and to escape Belgian business regulations. It was immediately refounded in the Congo Free State as the Abir Congo Company. The name was no longer an acronym of Anglo-Belgian India Rubber and was instead a name in its own right. This change was because the company was no longer supported by British investment, partly because Colonel North had died and his heirs had sold their shares. The new company had a simpler shares system with just 2,000 shares (of 14,300 fr value each) divided between investors. The Free State held 1,000 of these shares. As Abir was now tax resident in the Congo the Free State received 2% of their profits through corporation tax, in addition to the 0.5 fr per kilogram <b>export</b> <b>tax.</b> All initial capital investments had been amortised by 1899 along with material expenses in Africa and property and equipment expenses in Antwerp. In 1900 Abir reached the boundaries of its concession which covered eight million hectares. The next three years were spent filling gaps between existing posts and by 1903 Abir controlled 49 posts, managed by 58 agents. 1900 was Abir's most profitable year and the Congo Free State's shares and taxes provided 2,567,880.50 fr of revenue for the state, 10% of that year's total. The share dividend in 1900 was 2,100 fr, in the early 1890s it had been around 2 fr per share.|$|E

30|$|Only {{relative}} prices {{matter and}} thus the anti-export bias in trade policy can arise by protecting the import competing industry or by directly <b>taxing</b> the <b>export</b> sector. In consequence, we now explore the structure of <b>export</b> <b>taxes</b> {{and the most recent}} evolution from 1966 to 2006. Compiling data on <b>export</b> <b>taxes</b> were actually harder than compiling data on import tariffs, because WITS does not carry information on <b>export</b> <b>taxes</b> and the whole series from 1966 to 2006, only available via the Guía Práctica, had to be manually typed. From 1966 to 1990, Argentina utilized the NADE nomenclature (Nomenclatura Arancelaria y Derechos de Exportación) and, from 1991 to 2006, the Harmonized System. Concardances between these two nomenclatures had to be manually built, as well.|$|R

In contrast, Footwear, Machinery, and Transport are among the least-often taxed sectors, with 7 and 13 years, respectively.|$|R
25|$|Sweden had {{treaties}} with England and France concerning slave trade, with Swedish vessels {{involved in the}} trans-Atlantic slave trade. Between 1784 and 1878, the country held minor colonies in the Caribbean. The Swedish colony of Saint Barthélemy functioned as a duty-free port and became a major center for the Caribbean slave trade. Slaves were brought in tax free by foreign vessels and the Swedish king made a profit by collecting an <b>export</b> <b>tax</b> when slaves were shipped out. Sweden was also a major supplier of iron chains used in the slave trade.|$|E
25|$|At {{the turn}} of the 15th century, several factors came into play that had a major impact on the global wine market. The Venetian traders were losing their supply of sweet wine from the lands of Cyprus, Greece, Romania and Hungary to the {{emerging}} dominance of the Ottoman Empire. War with France had lost the English their access to the wines of Bordeaux. Seeing an opportunity to capitalize on this, the Spanish Duke of Medina Sidonia made several moves to put Sherry into the forefront of the world's wine market. In 1491, the <b>export</b> <b>tax</b> on wine was abolished for both Spanish and foreign vessels coming into Sanlúcar. In 1517, English merchants were given preferential merchant status-including {{the right to bear arms}} in the region.|$|E

At least one quarter of the 50 inhabitants would have to be settled within the first year of the land grant, with the rest being settled within three years following that. The patroons would have full liberty to purchase goods in New Netherland, New England, and New France, with the exception of furs. But the trader would have to pay an <b>export</b> <b>tax</b> of five per cent in New Amsterdam before goods could be shipped to Europe. The fur trade remained a monopoly of the Company, being the most profitable investment at the time. The weaving of cloth was also prohibited in order to supply the looms in Holland with their needed raw supplies.|$|E
40|$|The North-West of Russia is a region, {{where most}} of the Russian forest {{products}} export to Europe is originated. There are also several publications and papers which have indicated that illegal logging and the export of this illegally harvested wood are a major problem in this particular region. In an attempt to stimulate the domestic processing industry as well as reducing the amount of illegally harvested wood, Russia have decided to implement <b>export</b> <b>taxes</b> on round wood. The purpose of this thesis was to examine if Russia’s proposed <b>export</b> <b>taxes</b> on round wood would decrease the amount of illegally harvested wood in this region. The method elected for this study was a literature study. The method of <b>export</b> <b>taxes</b> as a means to stop illegal operations in the forest sector has been conducted before, and the results from these countries have been analyzed and used to predict a likely outcome for the amount of illegally harvested wood due to this trade restriction. The results from other countries show that <b>export</b> <b>taxes</b> have not reduced the illegal logging in a significant way. What we have seen in other countries is that the deforestation rate has gone down and at best we can assume that illegal operations are a part of this deforestation, and thus would be reduced in a small amount. There are however no evidence that supports that fact. Given the purpose of Russia’s <b>export</b> <b>taxes,</b> which is to stimulate the domestic wood processing industry as well as decreasing the amount of illegally harvested wood I have reached the conclusion that the <b>export</b> <b>taxes</b> will not affect the amount of illegally harvested wood in North-West Russia. Instead, the illegally harvested wood will support the growing needs of the increased domestic processing...|$|R

The former approach assumes that firms have a [...] "conjecture" [...] as to how the other firms will react to their own choice of output and base their decision on this belief. However, the approach is problematic, both from an analytical (it is not internally consistent) and an empirical point of view (there's no guarantee that the parameter, even if it makes conceptual sense, remains stable when a new policy – the government's subsidy – is introduced). Calibrations of models of industry structure on the other hand have generally found that most industry are neither Cournot (in which case the Brander–Spencer policy prescription would be an export subsidy) nor Bertrand (in which case the optimal policy is an <b>export</b> <b>tax).</b> As a result, it is hard to say in which industries exactly the Brander–Spencer policy prescription may apply.|$|E

2500|$|Over several centuries, {{a number}} of factors contributed to the {{prominent}} influence that Great Britain has had over the French wine industry. With a cool wet climate, the British Isles have historically produced dramatically different styles of wines than the French and in quantities too small to satisfy the London market. This caused the English to look abroad for wines, using the clout of their economic and political power to their advantage. The 1152 marriage between Eleanor of Aquitaine and the future King Henry II of England brought a large portion of southwest France under English rule. [...] When Henry's son John inherited the English crown, he sought to curry favor among the Gascons by bestowing upon them many privileges-the most notable of which was an exemption among Bordeaux merchants from the Grand Coutume <b>export</b> <b>tax.</b> With this exemption and favored treatment in London, Bordeaux wine became the cheapest wine in the London market and gained immense popularity among the English, who call it claret. For over the next 300 years much of Gascony, particular Bordeaux, benefited by the close commercial ties with the English allowing this area to grow in prominence among all French wines. In the aftermath of the Hundred Years War, these lands reverted to French rule but with a lasting imprint of English influence.|$|E
