There were rumors that Williams was taking bribes {{in exchange for}} declining to prosecute pending trial cases. In 1875, Williams was supposed to prosecute the merchant house Pratt & Boyd for fraudulent customhouse entries. The Senate Judiciary Committee had found that Williams had dropped the case after his wife had received a $30,000 payoff. When informed of this, Grant forced Williams's resignation.

5|$|Sashadhar Mukherjee, an {{assistant}} sound-engineer at the studio, had a brotherly bond with Devika Rani because {{both of them}} were Bengalis and spoke that language with each other. He established contact with the runaway couple and managed to convince Devika Rani to return to her husband. In the India of that era, divorce was legally almost impossible and women who eloped were regarded as no better than prostitutes and were shunned by their own families. In her heart of hearts, Devika Rani knew that she could not secure a divorce or marry Hassan under any circumstances. She negotiated with her husband through the auspices of Sashadhar Mukherjee, seeking the separation of her finances from those of her husband as a condition for her return. Henceforth, she would be paid separately for working in his films, but he would be required to single-handedly pay the <b>household</b> <b>expenses</b> for the home in which both of them would live. Himanshu agreed to this, in order to save face in society and to prevent his studio from going bankrupt. Devika Rani returned to her marital home. However, things {{would never be the same}} between husband and wife again, and it is said that thenceforth, their relationship was largely confined to work and little or no intimacy transpired between them after this episode.|$|E
5|$|Women were {{encouraged}} to leave the workforce {{and the creation of}} large families by racially suitable women was promoted through a propaganda campaign. Women received a bronze award—known as the Ehrenkreuz der Deutschen Mutter (Cross of Honour of the German Mother)—for giving birth to four children, silver for six and gold for eight or more. Large families received subsidies to help with their utilities, school fees and <b>household</b> <b>expenses.</b> Though the measures led to increases in the birth rate, the number of families having four or more children declined by five percent between 1935 and 1940. Removing women from the workforce did not have the intended effect of freeing up jobs for men as women were for the most part employed as domestic servants, weavers or in the food and drink industries—jobs that were not of interest to men. Nazi philosophy prevented large numbers of women from being hired to work in munitions factories in the build-up to the war, so foreign labourers were brought in. After the war started, slave labourers were extensively used. In January 1943, Hitler signed a decree requiring all women under the age of fifty to report for work assignments to help the war effort. Thereafter women were funnelled into agricultural and industrial jobs and by September 1944 14.9 million women were working in munitions production.|$|E

25|$|Women's {{property}} {{rights in the}} Quran are from parents and near relatives.

Furthermore, any earnings that a woman receives through employment or business, after marriage, is hers to keep and need not contribute towards family expenses. This is because, once the marriage is consummated, in exchange for tamkin (sexual submission), a woman is entitled to nafaqa– namely, the financial responsibility for reasonable housing, food and other <b>household</b> <b>expenses</b> for the family, including the spouse, falls entirely on the husband. In traditional Islamic law, a woman is also not responsible for the upkeep of the home and may demand payment for any work she does in the domestic sphere.|$|E
25|$|Justice was {{administered}} free of charge, by special officers appointed as judges and magistrates, but {{the king was}} supreme and the final arbiter in all civil and criminal cases. Mortgage, lease, trust property, loans, breach of contract were some common sources of civil litigation, while criminal offences included theft, adultery, forgery and treason. The punishments were very severe and hence crimes were rare: one {{caught in the act}} of burglary, adultery or spying was given the death penalty and one giving false testimony would have his tongue cut off. The king was the chief commander of the army and usually led his army in the battlefield. The military was said to be fourfold : the infantry, the cavalry, the elephantry and the chariotry. A wide variety of war weapons filled the military arsenal including shields, swords, spears, tridents, maces, bows and arrows. The main sources of royal revenue were taxes, tributes, customs duties and tolls. Land tax, paid in money or in kind, and income tax, equal to one-sixth of an individual’s income, were the major types of taxes collected. Other sources of revenue include tributes paid by feudal subordinates, war booty presents by loyal and visiting subjects, treasure troves besides land revenue, cess and forced gifts. The items incurring expenditure for the king include the military, gifts to poets and temples, maintenance of educational and health services, building infrastructure such as roads and irrigation and the palace <b>household</b> <b>expenses.</b>|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, the country’s poorest rural people {{generally}} have small plots of low-quality land or are landless, and their opportunities for off-farm employment are scarce. The poorest {{people live in}} remote villages in upland areas, with limited access to transportation and social interaction. Rural poor people have limited access to productive resources and basic financial services such as credit and savings. Village, commune, district and regional infrastructure is poorly developed. Rural poor people face harsh natural conditions and frequent natural disasters. They are particularly vulnerable to seasonal hardships, community-wide crises and unexpected events, such as disease, which increase a <b>household's</b> <b>expenses</b> and reduce income. Poor households tend to include more dependants, especially children. Among age groups, poverty disproportionately affects children. Poor people, particularly ethnic minorities, are often uninformed about their rights and lack access to legal assistance.|$|R
30|$|The second {{indicator}} {{to identify the}} population at risk of accessibility poverty is a high share of expenditure for mobility in the net household budget. The share of expenditure {{is not the most}} obvious indicator of transport poverty risk. However, it may be clear that households spending a very high share of their income on transport {{may not be able to}} continue to do so if the circumstances change, for instance if oil prices increase or if <b>households</b> <b>expenses</b> go up unexpectedly. Under such conditions, households may be forced to adjust their mobility patterns and even reduce their actual mobility, or alternatively give up on other essential goods [47, 16, 37]. This suggests that households with high transport expenditures are at risk of transport poverty and thus also at risk of accessibility poverty. For this reason, we employ this indicator in our estimate of households in accessibility poverty below.|$|R

500|$|A {{second source}} of {{inspiration}} was Wagner's infatuation with the poet-writer Mathilde Wesendonck, {{the wife of the}} silk merchant Otto Wesendonck. Wagner met the Wesendoncks, who were both great admirers of his music, in Zürich in 1852. From May 1853 onwards Wesendonck made several loans to Wagner to finance his <b>household</b> <b>expenses</b> in Zürich, and in 1857 placed a cottage on his estate at Wagner's disposal, which became known as the Asyl ("asylum" [...] or [...] "place of rest"). During this period, Wagner's growing passion for his patron's wife inspired him to put aside work on the Ring cycle (which was not resumed for the next twelve years) and begin work on Tristan. While planning the opera, Wagner composed the Wesendonck Lieder, five songs for voice and piano, setting poems by Mathilde. Two of these settings are explicitly subtitled by Wagner as [...] "studies for Tristan und Isolde".|$|E
40|$|The CEQ {{presents}} {{a number of}} challenges for both interviewers and respondents. First, the interview is long. Depending on the amount and type of expenditures reported, it takes, on average, 65 minutes to complete (BLS Handbook of Methods, 2007). Second, {{some of the questions}} are detailed and include what was purchased, the amount of the purchase, and when it was purchased. In fact, the respondent is asked to report this information for about 60 to 70 percent of the <b>household’s</b> <b>expenses</b> during the previous three months (BLS Handbook of Methods 2007). Finally, there is concern over declining response rates. The response rate for the CE was about 80 percent in the early 2000 s, but now hovers around 74 percent.

40|$|Background: Much of {{research}} on <b>household</b> catastrophic medical <b>expenses</b> in China has focused on less developed areas and {{little is known about}} this problem in more developed areas. This study aimed to analyse the incidence and determinants of catastrophic medical expenses in eastern China. Methods: Data were obtained from a health care utilization and expense survey of 11, 577 households conducted in eastern China in 2008. The incidence of <b>household</b> catastrophic medical <b>expenses</b> was calculated using the method introduced by the World Health Organization. A multi-level logistic regression model was used to identify the determinants. Results: The incidence of <b>household</b> catastrophic medical <b>expenses</b> in eastern China ranged from 9. 24 % to 24. 79 %. Incidence of <b>household</b> catastrophic medical <b>expenses</b> was lower if the head of household had a higher level of education, labor insurance coverage, while the incidence was higher if they lived in rural areas, had a family member with chronic diseases, had a child younger than 5 years old, had a person at home who was at least 65 years old, and had a household member who was hospitalized. Moreover, the impact of the economic level on catastrophic medical expenses was non-linear. The poorest group had a lower incidence than that of the second lowest income group and the group with the highest income had a higher incidence than that of the second highest income group. In addition, region was a significant determinant. Conclusions: Reducing the incidence of <b>household</b> catastrophic medical <b>expenses</b> should be one of the priorities of health policy. It can be achieved by improving residents’ health status to reduce avoidable health services such as hospitalization. It is also important to design more targeted health insurance in order to increase financial support for such vulnerable groups as the poor, chronically ill, children, and senior populations...|$|R

Ward's approximate income at the time, from his practice and from his portraiture, had been around £5,500 a year, a substantial sum at that time.
