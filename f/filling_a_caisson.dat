50|$|Locks {{use a lot}} of water, so {{builders}} {{have adopted}} other approaches for situations where little water is available. These include boat lifts, such as the Falkirk Wheel, which use <b>a</b> <b>caisson</b> of water in which boats float while being moved between two levels; and inclined planes where <b>a</b> <b>caisson</b> is hauled up a steep railway.|$|R

50|$|Caisson is also {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} colloquial term for a reinforced concrete structure formed by pouring into a hollow cylindrical form, typically by placing <b>a</b> <b>caisson</b> form below grade in an open excavation and pouring once backfill is complete, or by drilling at grade, although this can be problematic with deep caissons, as unsupported excavations can collapse before the caisson form can be inserted. In this manner, the earth placed around the empty caisson form provides stability and strength, allowing concrete to be poured with fewer complications and with less risk of a form blowout. While, technically, only the form itself is actually <b>a</b> <b>caisson,</b> {{it is not uncommon}} for any below-grade cast concrete pillar to be referred to as, simply, <b>a</b> <b>caisson.</b>|$|R

25|$|A lock is {{a device}} used for raising and {{lowering}} boats, ships and other watercraft between stretches of water of different levels on river and canal waterways. The distinguishing feature of a lock is a fixed chamber {{in which the}} water level can be varied; whereas in <b>a</b> <b>caisson</b> lock, <b>a</b> boat lift, or on a canal inclined plane, it is the chamber itself (usually then called <b>a</b> <b>caisson)</b> that rises and falls.|$|R
5000|$|Construction of {{the first}} caisson started in 1947 after the [...] "wet season". <b>As</b> each <b>caisson</b> rose in height, sand {{was removed from the}} centre of the caisson to make it sink into the sand bed. To get such a {{tremendous}} mass to sink gradually and evenly was difficult. To add to the difficulties, often <b>a</b> <b>caisson</b> became stuck and a diver had to be sent down to find the problem and remedy it. Another difficulty was that each caisson had to be sunk to a secure depth before the [...] "wet season". If <b>a</b> <b>caisson</b> was not firmly anchored deep enough, a flood could have swept it away.|$|R
50|$|The {{system works}} by {{basically}} lifting or lowering <b>a</b> <b>caisson</b> containing <b>a</b> boat on a carriage along a slope using a balancing counterweight.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} pore pressure around a caisson-type breakwater subjected to dynamic wave loading. Unlike previous investigations for wave-seabed-caisson interaction, cross-anisotropic soil behaviour is considered in this paper. Based on a linear poro-elastic theory, a finite element model is developed. A parametric study related {{to the effects of}} wave parameters, soil characteristics and geometry of caisson and rubble mound base on the pore pressure around <b>a</b> <b>caisson</b> is performed. The numerical results indicate that the effects of anisotropic soil behaviour on the wave-induced pore pressure in a sandy bed beneath <b>a</b> <b>caisson</b> are not negligible.
