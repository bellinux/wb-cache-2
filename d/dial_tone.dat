25|$|A {{telephone}} exchange automatically senses an off-hook {{condition of the}} telephone when the user removes the handset from the switchhook or cradle. The exchange provides <b>dial</b> <b>tone</b> {{at that time to}} indicate to the user that the exchange is ready to receive dialed digits. The pulses or DTMF tones generated by the telephone are processed and a connection is established to the destination telephone within the same exchange or to another distant exchange.|$|E

50|$|Equipment such as fax {{machines}} and modems {{are designed to}} recognize <b>dial</b> <b>tones</b> and busy tones.|$|R
50|$|Cell phones {{generally}} do not use <b>dial</b> <b>tones,</b> because the technology used to transmit the dialed number is different from a landline.|$|R
25|$|Part of the {{previous}} permissive dialing plan included a mass calling prefix for radio station contests, introduced in the 1960s because some contests put unacceptable loads on the Bay Area's telephone switches. Until the 1980s, radio station call-in contests throughout the Bay Area used 575-numbers. Electromechanical switching equipment of the day had been engineered to accommodate large call volumes to 575-numbers. Large numbers of calls would otherwise have overloaded switching equipment causing slow <b>dial</b> <b>tone</b> and blocked long distance circuits.|$|E
2500|$|Later {{stepping}} switches {{were arranged}} in banks, {{the first stage}} of which was a linefinder. If one of up to a hundred subscriber lines had the receiver lifted [...] "off hook", a linefinder connected the subscriber's line to a free first selector, which returned the subscriber a <b>dial</b> <b>tone</b> to show that it was ready to receive dialed digits. The subscriber's dial pulsed at about 10 pulses per second, although the speed depended on the standard of the particular telephone administration.|$|E
2500|$|A {{electronic}} dance track {{combined with}} hip-hop elements, [...] "Lies" [...] {{begins with a}} <b>dial</b> <b>tone,</b> and that builts up around a [...] "subtle piano, brassy percussion, and a clapping beat." [...] The chorus blends [...] "boy-band harmonies and hip-hop chants", which was described as [...] "something fresh" [...] for K-pop in 2007, while the vocals were described as [...] "delicate". Arirang TV called the track an [...] "Euro-house style piece, lanced with trance." [...] Lyrically, the song describes a break-up, with the line [...] "I'm so sorry but I love you" [...] being used as the hook.|$|E

2500|$|In {{historical}} perspective, telecommunication terms {{have been}} used with different semantics over time. The term telephone exchange is often used synonymously with central office (CO), a Bell System term. Often, a central office {{is defined as a}} building used to house the inside plant equipment of potentially several telephone exchanges, each serving a certain geographical area. Such an area has also been referred to as the exchange. Central office locations may also be identified in North America as wire centers, designating a facility from which a telephone obtains <b>dial</b> <b>tone.</b> [...] For business and billing purposes, telephony carriers also define rate centers, which in larger cities may be clusters of central offices, to define specified geographical locations for determining distance measurements.|$|E
2500|$|Beyond {{critical}} mass, {{the increasing}} number of subscribers generally cannot continue indefinitely. [...] After a certain point, most networks become either congested or saturated, stopping future uptake. [...] Congestion occurs due to overuse. [...] The applicable analogy is that of a telephone network. [...] While the number of users is below the congestion point, each additional user adds additional value to every other customer. [...] However, at some point the addition of an extra user exceeds the capacity of the existing system. [...] After this point, each additional user decreases the value obtained by every other user. [...] In practical terms, each additional user increases the total system load, leading to busy signals, the inability to get a <b>dial</b> <b>tone,</b> and poor customer support. [...] The next critical point is where the value obtained again equals the price paid. [...] The network will cease to grow at this point, and the system must be enlarged. The congestion point may be larger than the market size. [...] New peer-to-peer technological models may always defy congestion. [...] Peer-to-peer systems, or [...] "P2P," [...] are networks designed to distribute load among their user pool. This theoretically allows true P2P networks to scale indefinitely. [...] The P2P based telephony service Skype benefits greatly from this effect (though market saturation will still occur).|$|E

50|$|The Series 3 {{featured}} a <b>tone</b> <b>dialing</b> feature {{using a combination}} of its built-in loudspeaker and dedicated software for generating tones suitable for telephone systems. It could be used to dial a telephone number by holding the device to the mouthpiece of a <b>tone</b> <b>dialing</b> telephone. The <b>tone</b> <b>dialing</b> feature was integrated into the Psion's Agenda, Contacts and Data applications.|$|R
50|$|The APPLE-CAT II {{was popular}} with phone phreakers for its high {{half-duplex}} 1200 bit/s speed {{and its ability}} to detect various tones. It also had the ability to generate tones directly into the phone line. Several specialized applications such as TSPS, The Cats Meow and Phantom Access were used to mimic standard telephone sounds such as standard numeric DTMF <b>dial</b> <b>tones</b> as well as blue box tones, ringing (both American and International), <b>dial</b> <b>tones,</b> call waiting alerts, busy signals, 2600 Hz tones, and other effects such as payphone sounds. Due to these and other features, the APPLE CAT II {{could be used as a}} black box, red box, hacking tool, answering machine, war dialer, voice simulator, voice distorter, etc.|$|R
50|$|In the London {{telephone}} area, {{calls to}} subscribers {{who were not}} serviced by Director telephone systems within local call-charging range of the London Director exchange area were carried by tandem exchange Toll A: a subscriber would dial a prefix code, usually three letters, followed {{by the number of}} the other subscriber on the fringe non-director exchange. Calls from fringe non-director exchanges to numbers within the director area were passed in two ways. For those to director exchanges near the area boundary adjacent to the non-director exchange, subscribers were given codes to dial, and told to follow the code with the numerical portion of the other subscriber's number. For director exchanges remote from the area boundary, the subscriber was told to dial 7, to wait for a second <b>dialling</b> <b>tone,</b> and to follow this with the whole of the other number. These calls were handled by tandem exchange Toll B, from which the second <b>dialling</b> <b>tone</b> originated. To have a second <b>dialling</b> <b>tone</b> in this way was very unusual on the PSTN in the UK, although the French and Belgian PTTs had a similar instruction for when their customers made international calls.|$|R
50|$|A dry loop is an unconditioned leased pair of {{telephone}} {{line from a}} telephone company. The pair does not provide <b>dial</b> <b>tone</b> or battery (continuous electric potential), {{as opposed to a}} wet pair, a line usually without <b>dial</b> <b>tone</b> but with battery.|$|E
50|$|To {{correctly}} unblock a number, {{listen for}} a <b>dial</b> <b>tone,</b> dial *82, and {{listen for the}} momentary flashing <b>dial</b> <b>tone</b> which confirms the override. Then establish the connection as usual by dialing 1, the area code, and the phone number to complete the call.|$|E
50|$|The class 5 {{office is}} the local {{exchange}} or end office. It delivers <b>dial</b> <b>tone</b> to the customer. The end office, also called a branch exchange, is the closest connection to the end customer. Over 19,000 end offices in the United States alone provide basic <b>dial</b> <b>tone</b> services.|$|E

50|$|Invented by {{engineer}} August Kruckow, the <b>dial</b> <b>tone</b> {{was first}} used in 1908 in Hildesheim, Germany. In the United States, the <b>dial</b> <b>tone</b> {{was introduced in the}} 1940s, and became widespread in the 1950s. When President Dwight D. Eisenhower retired in 1961 it was nearly universal, but the president himself had not been confronted with a <b>dial</b> <b>tone.</b> When he picked up his own household phone his assistant had to explain what the strange noise was, as well as show Eisenhower how to use a rotary dial phone.|$|E

5000|$|Often, {{the term}} [...] "Winmodem" [...] or [...] "softmodem" [...] {{is used in}} a {{derogatory}} manner, as opposed to hardware or [...] "real" [...] modems. The argument is that a softmodem isn't a real modem at all, but rather a simple electrical interface between computer and phone line, limiting itself to very basic functions such as voltage/current adaptation and functioning essentially as a DAC/ADC, much like a sound card which handles pure PCM and analog signals from and to the telephone line, while the host's CPU does the actual job of synthesizing or analyzing all necessary waveforms (carrier, <b>dialing</b> <b>tones)</b> and applying all necessary DSP techniques (FSK, QAM, PSK etc.) to a [...] "virtual" [...] signal, in order to encode and decode inbound or outbound data.|$|R
