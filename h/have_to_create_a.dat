500|$|Elsewhere, Bree {{struggles with}} dating a detective and {{covering}} up Alejandro's death. While trying {{to dispose of}} Alejandro's car, Bree and Gabrielle inadvertently attract Chuck's attention and <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> series of elaborate lies to avoid him finding out the truth. Later, Bree receives a note reading, [...] "I know what you did. It makes me sick. I'm going to tell." [...] This {{is the same as}} the letter Mary Alice received before killing herself.|$|E
500|$|Literature scholar Tonia Payne {{has written}} that [...] "Paradises Lost" [...] {{is an example of}} ecocriticism, wherein Le Guin critiques the idea that human beings are {{separate}} from their natural environment. The premise of the novella involves human beings who live their entire lives on a ship in interstellar space, and who therefore <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> new reality for themselves, a notion also explored in Le Guin's short story [...] "Newton's Sleep". The inhabitants of Discovery become unable to relate to representations of Earth. Some, like Hsing and Luis, still try to understand Ti Chiu, keeping in mind their position {{as a part of a}} continuum of people supposed to colonize a new planet. For others, this new reality takes the form of the religious beliefs of the cult of Bliss. These beliefs are portrayed as an understandable attempt to adjust to the reality of spaceflight. A review by Publishers Weekly identified a similar theme, common to the other stories in the [...] "Birthday of the World" [...] collection, of characters coming to terms with the world they live in.|$|E

2500|$|We have {{described}} what optical solitons are and, using mathematics, {{we have seen}} that, {{if we want to}} create them, we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> field with a particular shape (just sech for the first order) with a particular power related to the duration of the impulse. But what if we are a bit wrong in creating such impulses? Adding small perturbations to the equations and solving them numerically, it is possible to show that mono-dimensional solitons are stable. They are often referred as [...] solitons, meaning that they are limited in one dimension (x or t, as we have seen) and propagate in another one (z).|$|E
2500|$|Dale Sheets and Universal Studios. Patterson, Gimlin, and DeAtley {{screened}} {{the film}} for Dale Sheets, {{head of the}} Documentary Film Department, and unnamed technicians [...] "in the special effects department at Universal Studios in Hollywood ... Their conclusion was: 'We could try (faking it), but we would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> completely new system of artificial muscles and find an actor who could be trained to walk like that. It might be done, but {{we would have to}} say that it would be almost impossible.'" [...] A more moderate version of their opinion was, [...] "if it is , it's a very good one—a job that would take a lot of time and money to produce." ...|$|E
2500|$|Estriol {{was part}} of the United States Pharmacopeia before FDA {{approval}} was needed for its use. Its approval was grandfathered in by the FDA until 2008 when the agency banned its use, stating that manufacturers of estriol would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> new application and estriol would be treated as a new drug. [...] Its use is not approved by Health Canada; estriol is not available as a pharmaceutical preparation in Canada or the United States, but is a commonly prescribed conventional treatment in other countries and is available as a cream or vaginal suppository in the United Kingdom and the European Union. [...] Estradiol is available as brand-name products in both oral and transdermal forms.|$|E

2500|$|Other {{writers who}} contributed to the show were Bill Manhoff, Mel Diamond, Dale and Katherine Eunson, Ben Gershman, George Tibbles (who later became the head writer on My Three Sons), Fran van Hartesvelt, Bob Ross, Alan Manings, Mathilde and Theodore Ferro, John Whedon and the team of Dick Conway and Roland MacLane, who wrote many of the shows {{for the last two}} seasons. Connelly told an interviewer, [...] "If we hire a writer we tell him not to make up {{situation}}s, but to look into his own background. It's not a 'situation' comedy where you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> situation for a particular effect. Our emphasis is on a natural story line." ...|$|E
2500|$|Homophobia in the Latino {{community}} is also prevalent within the United States. Many Latinos {{feel like a}} double minority for being both an ethnic minority and a sexual minority. As a result, queer Latinos must straddle multiple cultures at once and take on somewhat contradictory identities {{in order to maintain}} ties within each group – a concept Gloria Anzaldúa calls the [...] "mestiza consciousness". At the same time, they often <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> [...] "borderland" [...] space for themselves {{that will allow them to}} freely express their sexuality without consequences. Because queer Latinos are often marginalized in both LGBT communities (because of race) and Latino communities (because of sexuality), the borderland spaces that exist are often composed strictly of queer Latinos. An example of such a space would be the community that the magazine Esto no tiene nombre created among Latina lesbians around the world.|$|E
2500|$|The former {{trend in}} Disney's {{hand-drawn}} features where {{the characters and}} cinematography were influenced by a CGI-look has been abandoned. Andreas Deja, a veteran Disney animator who supervised the character of Mama Odie, says [...] "I always thought that maybe we should distinguish ourselves {{to go back to}} what 2D is good at, which is focusing on what the line can do rather than volume, which is a CG kind of thing. So we are doing less extravagant Treasure Planet kind of treatments. You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> world but [...] What we're trying to do with Princess and the Frog is hook up with things that the old guys did earlier. It's not going to be graphic...". Deja also mentions that Lasseter was aiming for the Disney sculptural and dimensional look of the 1950s: [...] "All those things that were non-graphic, which means go easy on the straight lines and have one volume flow into the other– an organic feel to the drawing." [...] Lasseter also felt that traditional animation created more character believability. For example, with Louis the alligator, created by Eric Goldberg, Lasseter said: [...] "It's the believability of this large character being able to move around quite like that." [...] Choreographer Betsy Baytos was brought by the directors to lead a team of eccentric dancers that gave reference to make each character a different style of movement. The character design tried to create beautiful drawings through subtle shapes, particularly for most characters being human. For the frog versions of Tiana and Naveen, while the animators started with realistic designs, they eventually went for cutesy characters [...] "removing all that is unappealing in frogs", similar to Pinocchios Jiminy Cricket.|$|E

60|$|So I {{put it to}} {{you that}} the most {{important}} work before men and women to-day is the preaching and teaching, the elaboration and then at last the realization of this Project of the World State. We <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> vision of it, to make it seem first a possibility and then an approaching reality. This is a task that demands the work and thought of thousands of minds. We have to spread the idea of a Federal World State, as an approaching reality, throughout the world. We can do this nowadays through a hundred various channels. We can do it through the press, through all sorts of literary expression, in our schools, colleges, and universities, through political mouthpieces, by special organizations, and last, but not least, through the teaching of the churches. For remember that all the great religions of the world are in theory universalist; they may tolerate the divisions of men but they cannot sanction them. We propose no religious revolution, but at most a religious revival. We can spread ideas and suggestions now with a hundred times the utmost rapidity of a century ago.|$|E
