He was fitted for prescription goggles, which {{he continued to}} wear throughout his career. Angels' MLB players of the time did not remember working with Ramírez; catcher José Molina suggested that Ramírez must {{not have been in}} the Angels' long-term plans, as they had a number of right-handed power pitching relief pitchers in the organization.|$|E
5|$|During {{the fights}} for the ramparts of Wola, only {{artillery}} {{of the second}} line gave limited support to the outnumbered Polish troops. Krukowiecki claimed after the war that he ordered Dembiński, Bem and General Franciszek Młokosiewicz to support the first line, but apparently none of them received the order. General Ludwik Bogusławski, commander of the 3rd Infantry Division manning the second line, could have supported the forts of the first line, but <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> {{what was happening in}} Fort 56 due to dense smoke and the trees of Brühl's Garden.|$|E
5|$|Following his January 1860 {{resignation}} from Parliament, Ollivier spearheaded a requisition, broadly {{supported by}} influential people, to have Brittan make himself {{available for the}} resulting by-election in the Christchurch Country electorate. Brittan declined the requisition, mostly because he was opposed to the rail tunnel scheme which had overwhelming support by the population, and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> himself being their representative if he disagreed with this popular public opinion. Isaac Thomas Cookson, who had earlier supported the Brittan requisition, was elected.|$|E

5|$|Simonsohn {{also raised}} the {{possibility}} of reverse causality in the case of Anseel and Duyck's analysis of a large data set consisting of Belgians' last names and the companies they work for. Anseel and Duyck concluded that people tend to choose to work for companies that match their initial.But Simonsohn suspected that, likeWalt Disney working for Disney, many people work for companies named after themselves or a family member. When he controlled for reverse causality in a large US data set, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> any evidence for people choosing to work for companies matching their initial.|$|E
5|$|Historian Carl Sferrazza Anthony {{noted that}} {{ordinary}} citizens responded to Nixon. When {{a group of}} rural people visited the White House to present a quilt to the First Lady, many were overcome with nervousness; upon hearing their weeping, Pat hugged each individual tightly, and the tension dissipated. When a young boy doubted that the Executive Mansion was her house because <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> the washing machine, Pat led him through the halls and up an elevator, into the family quarters and the laundry room. She mixed well with people of different races, and made no distinctions on that basis. During the Nixons' trip to China in 1972, foreign minister Zhou En-lai was suffienciently smitten with her so as to give two rare giant pandas to the ambassador as a gift from China.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the pay-per-view, Punk {{cashed in}} his Money in the Bank {{contract}} to defeat Jeff Hardy for the World Heavyweight Championship. Punk retained his title in a Triple Threat match against both Edge and Hardy eight days later on the June 15 episode of Raw. At The Bash, Punk lost to Hardy by disqualification after kicking the referee; in the storyline Punk injured his eye and said that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> the referee. Because titles do not change hands on a disqualification, Punk retained the championship. Hardy called Punk's eye injury into question, believing it to be feigned. Punk turned heel, claiming to be the moral superior of those who support Hardy due to his drug-free lifestyle. At Night of Champions, Punk lost the championship to Hardy. Their feud continued through SummerSlam, where Punk regained the title in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match; afterward, Punk was attacked by The Undertaker. On the August 28 episode of SmackDown, Punk concluded his program with Hardy and achieved his booked goal of excising him from WWE, defeating Hardy in a steel cage match wherein the loser agreed to leave the company.|$|E

5|$|By his return, he was {{critical}} of the Bible as history, and wondered why all religions should not be equally valid. In the next few years, while intensively speculating on geology and the transmutation of species, he gave much thought to religion and openly discussed this with his wife Emma, whose beliefs also came from intensive study and questioning. The theodicy of Paley and Thomas Malthus vindicated evils such as starvation {{as a result of}} a benevolent creator's laws, which had an overall good effect. To Darwin, natural selection produced the good of adaptation but removed the need for design, and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> the work of an omnipotent deity in all the pain and suffering, such as the ichneumon wasp paralysing caterpillars as live food for its eggs. He still viewed organisms as perfectly adapted, and On the Origin of Species reflects theological views. Though he thought of religion as a tribal survival strategy, Darwin was reluctant to give up the idea of God as an ultimate lawgiver. He was increasingly troubled by the problem of evil.|$|E
5|$|Dam asked Vann, who was {{circling}} the battlefield aboard an L-19 reconnaissance aircraft, to reconnoiter possible landing zones {{on the east}} and west sides of Ap Bac, where additional reinforcements could be inserted to launch their attacks. In response, Vann asked his pilot to make low passes over the trees which covered Ap Bac. Although <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> any Viet Cong positions, Vann knew there was a well-fortified position {{at the south end of}} the hamlet, due to the impact of the Viet Cong's firepower on the Civil Guards since the battle's inception. As Vann's L-19 aircraft flew over the western tree line, the Viet Cong watched from their foxholes, but held their fire because they knew the aircraft was trying to draw fire in order to mark their positions. Although Vann was suspicious, he decided it was a better landing zone because the area was tranquil despite the heavy fighting elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|In December 1946, it was {{announced}} that Halsey, Spruance and Turner had been awarded the Army Distinguished Service Medal. A message soon arrived from MacArthur stating that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> why Kinkaid should not merit the same award, which had been recommended by Krueger during the war. The medal was duly presented by General Courtney Hodges in a ceremony on Governors Island on 10 April 1947. The Australian government chose to honor Kinkaid with an honorary Companion of the Order of the Bath, which was presented by the ambassador at a ceremony at the embassy in Washington on Australia Day, 26 January 1948. Kinkaid had already been created Grand Officer of the Order of Orange-Nassau by Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands in 1944. In March 1948, he was made a Grand Officer of the Order of Leopold and presented with the Croix de guerre with Palm in a ceremony at the Belgian embassy in Washington, D.C.|$|E
60|$|Rising with difficulty, he was {{met with}} a shower of {{language}} from the savage in a voice which partook equally of the tones of remonstrance and abuse, but Olaf made no reply, chiefly because, not understanding what was said, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not.</b> <b>Seeing</b> this plainly indicated on his face, the savage stopped speaking {{and gave him a}} box on the other ear, by way of interpreting what he had said. It was not quite so violent as the first, and only staggered Olaf, besides lighting up a few faint stars. Very soon little Snorro became silent, from the combined effects of exhaustive squeezes and horror.|$|R
5000|$|He felt awful {{about his}} father’s {{underwater}} burial. To make amends, {{he remained in}} that spot, wearing a bamboo hat until his death so that <b>he</b> too <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> the sky. Some time after his death, two rocks rose up at Gatbawi." ...|$|R

5|$|On August 2, 2008, Judah lost to Joshua Clottey by {{technical}} {{decision in}} a fight for the vacant IBF Welterweight title at the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas. Judah began the busier fighter, showing quick hands and throwing effective combinations behind a jab. Clottey began steadily closing the distance between himself and his opponent from the third round, landing {{an increasing number of}} punches that took their toll on Judah. In round four, Clottey landed an uppercut that caused Judah to lose his balance, {{and by the end of}} the round, Judah had blood running down his nose. Judah staged a comeback in the sixth round, but in the middle of the seventh round, Clottey landed a right hand that hurt Judah and caused him to back into a corner. In round nine, Judah suffered a cut over his right eye and the fight was stopped after he said <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>see.</b> The referee had ruled the cut was caused by an accidental clash of heads and so the fight went to the scorecards. Two judges scored the fight 86–85 and the other judge scored it 87–84, all in favor of Clottey.|$|E
5|$|Saavedro is the {{antagonist}} of Exile. Depicted as a vengeful {{and broken}} man, Saavedro is an inhabitant of the Age of Narayan, {{one of the}} Ages chosen by Atrus to try to teach his sons Sirrus and Achenar about the Art of writing books linking to other worlds. Saavedro agrees to help tutor Atrus' sons, but is shocked when the brothers instigate a destructive rebellion and abandon the Age to be destroyed from within. When Saavedro pursues Sirrus and Achenar to the Age of J'nanin, he is assaulted and left for dead. Trapped on J'nanin and believing Narayan destroyed and his family to be dead, Saavedro's mental health deteriorates during his years of captivity. When Saavedro is unexpectedly freed and travels to Tomahna in hope of finding the brothers, he steals the linking book for Releeshahn in a plan to lure Atrus to Narayan and exact revenge. Once on Narayan, Saavedro discovers that his people have not been destroyed. Cornered by the Stranger, Saavedro gives up the Releeshahn book. In the game's optimal ending, the player enables Saavedro to peacefully return to Narayan, before taking Releeshahn back to Atrus. Saavedro is portrayed by veteran actor Brad Dourif, who accepted the role of Saavedro {{because he was a}} Myst fan. Dourif said that his role for the game was much more difficult than working on movie sets, as <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> the player he was addressing or interact with the game environment.|$|E
5|$|Later, Howard {{arrives at}} Mickey's Diner and uses their {{phone to call}} home. As {{he tried to get}} a hold of Liz, he unintentionally scolds Jamie on the phone over Turbo-Man. Jamie, in turn, rebukes his father about how he never keeps his promises, and hangs up. Liz overhears the {{argument}} and becomes disappointed in her husband. Howard then encounters Myron at the diner. As they sat down and talk, Myron tells Howard about the time when his father was unable to get him a Johnny Seven OMA toy on Christmas. They hear on the KQRS radio station that the D.J. is running a Turbo-Man competition. When they get to the studio, they find out they can only win a gift certificate. They are nearly arrested, but Myron bluffs the police into backing off by threatening them with a package (which he claims is a mail bomb, unaware that it really is one). Officer Hummell tries to open it and it blows up in his face. After his car is stripped by thieves, Howard is ultimately forced to return home empty-handed. Upon seeing Ted in his house placing the star on his tree, Howard gets angry and attempts to steal the Turbo-Man doll from Ted's house that he had bought for his son Johnny (E.J. De La Pena), but changes his mind at the last moment as <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> himself stealing from a child. He is attacked by Ted's pet reindeer but manages to lock him up but he unintentionally sets some of his stuff on fire he tires to put it out but kicks it outside the window. This commotion leads him to be caught by Ted and a distraught Liz. Liz and Jamie leave for the local Wintertainment Parade with Ted and Johnny; Howard follows, aiming to make amends. At the parade, Ted makes a pass at Liz, but after seeing what he really is, she turns him down by hitting him with a thermos of eggnog.|$|E
60|$|Bartley did {{not deny}} the justness of her {{opinions}} concerning himself, or the reasonableness of the general expectation, though <b>he</b> probably <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> the relation of these cold abstractions to the pleasure of sitting there with a pretty girl in that way. But he said nothing.|$|R
60|$|Presently, {{he heard}} voices behind him. The position, {{in which he}} was lying, was a little {{distance}} down on the slopes, on the seaward side of the path, and, as a screen of bushes grew behind it, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be <b>seen</b> by anyone passing along.|$|R

25|$|Negotiations between Scotland and England for a union {{were going}} on at this time.

25|$|Although {{reflection}} {{from the}} rings increases Saturn's brightness, {{they are not}} visible from Earth with unaided vision. In 1610, the year after Galileo Galilei turned a telescope to the sky, {{he became the first}} person to observe Saturn's rings, though <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> them well enough to discern their true nature. In 1655, Christiaan Huygens {{was the first person to}} describe them as a disk surrounding Saturn. Although many people think of Saturn's rings as being made up of a series of tiny ringlets (a concept that goes back to Laplace), true gaps are few. It is more correct to think of the rings as an annular disk with concentric local maxima and minima in density and brightness. On the scale of the clumps within the rings there is much empty space.|$|E
25|$|Opas, {{convinced}} of Ryan's innocence, {{agreed to work}} without pay. Opas consulted the Ethics Committee of the Bar Council to seek approval to make a public appeal for a solicitor prepared to brief him, as Opas was prepared to pay his travel, other expenses and appear without fee. The Committee said {{that this would be}} touting for business and was unethical. Opas argued that a man's life was at stake and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> how he would be touting when no payment was involved. Opas defied the ruling and on national radio sought an instructor. Opas was inundated with offers and accepted the first application, being from Ralph Freadman. Alleyne Kiddle was in London completing a master's degree and she agreed to take a junior brief without a fee.|$|E
25|$|Liddell was {{scheduled}} to defend his new title against longtime veteran Jeremy Horn, at UFC 54, a matchup the UFC claimed was demanded by long-time fans of the sport since Horn had given Liddell his first loss. Throughout the bout, Liddell dominated with aggressive punches, causing knockdowns in several rounds. Liddell's defensive wrestling ability, especially his sprawl, stifled the bulk of Horn's offense, which was centered on grappling and submission wrestling. Liddell eventually won the fight via TKO in 2:46 minutes of the fourth round after Horn informed the referee that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>see.</b> He had been hit with a right punch to the eye causing him to bleed from his eye {{as well as his}} nose. Liddell had successfully defended his title and, in the process, avenged two of his three career losses.|$|E
