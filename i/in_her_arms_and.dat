Its music also incorporates R, soul, and funk influences. The album's cover depicts a nude black woman holding a white baby <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> alludes comically to the band's African-American music influences. The songs have themes of pleasure and guilt, and deal with topics such as dysfunctional relationships and sexual deviancy.

25|$|The {{facade of}} the cloister has two levels and is fronted by an arched porch area, called a portería.
