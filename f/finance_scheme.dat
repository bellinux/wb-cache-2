The reopened Jubilee Street forms a direct link from Church Street, an ancient route to the Pavilion estate, and North Road—the main road through the North Laine district of cultural venues, restaurants and small shops. As such, the library and square form a central part of Brighton's [...] "cultural quarter". As the central feature of Jubilee Square, and the first to be completed, the library was described by Hugh Pearman as the [...] "catalyst for regeneration". [...] The library's opening and success encouraged commercial development round it, which in turn helped to pay for it through the 25-year private <b>finance</b> <b>scheme</b> set up in 2000. [...] Pearman stated that [...] "the library became the superhero. [...] The city did not save it: it saved the city." [...] Assessing its impact in 2010, another writer suggested it could be [...] "the most important public building constructed in Brighton since the Royal Pavilion".|$|E

40|$|Introduction : Limited {{access to}} health services, {{variations}} in quality {{of health care and}} pressure to contain escalation of health care cost are problems in health care systems that are faced by all the societies in the world especially in developing countries. There is an urgent need to conduct a study to assess perception of individual towards health care services in the new planned National Healthcare <b>Financing</b> <b>Scheme.</b> Objective : The study objective is to examine the perception towards health care services among the farming community and to assess the willingness to contribute to The New National Health <b>Financing</b> <b>Scheme.</b> Methods : A cross sectional study involving farmers in the state of Selangor in Peninsular Malaysia was conducted. A total of 400 farmers as the household head were selected using multistage random sampling method. Results : The respondents’ mean score of perception towards public healthcare services were higher than the respondents’ mean score of perceptions towards private healthcare services except for accessibility and convenience aspects. There was no association between willingness to contribute to The New National Healthcare <b>Financing</b> <b>Scheme</b> and perception towards public healthcare services but there was association between willingness to contribute to The New National Healthcare <b>Financing</b> <b>Scheme</b> and perception towards private healthcare services. Conclusion : Perception towards healthcare services is an important element in the implementation of The New National Healthcare <b>Financing</b> <b>Scheme</b> as it will determine the willingness of an individual to contribute to it...|$|R

50|$|Pollock and Hellowell {{also say}} that, {{although}} the UK government's support for PFI {{is based on}} its supposed ability to deliver good value for money, the mechanisms for testing this are skewed.

In theory, if this exercise concludes that PFI does not represent good value for money compared to public finance, then the latter should be used for the procurement.

50|$|Following {{a project}} <b>finance</b> <b>scheme,</b> {{for a project}} to be {{executed}} under Pidiregas, the resources that it generates {{from the sale of}} goods and services have to be enough to cover the incurred financial obligations. Projects are paid with the revenues generated during their operation and require the signature of a contract in which a product or work is involved. The State assumes the risk since PEMEX or CFE sign the contract as guarantee, while the investors recover their investment in the agreed time. As a result, Pidiregas cannot be considered as true private investment since, under true private sector participation, firms would make investment decisions and bear the full risk. The viability of the program has been questioned as its effect in the public budget is similar to the emission of public debt. Furthermore, until 2006, the Pidigeras scheme resulted in losses.|$|E

A preference heuristic with considerable involvement of health providers and the community was used to identify the type of <b>financing</b> <b>scheme</b> and resulted in a pre-paid health plan, while a mathematical model was developed to determine the premiums to charge. The implementation of the health plant is briefly described. An evaluation {{of the effects of the}} pre-paid plan on the accessibility and equity of health care, as well as on the financial sustainability of the hospital, is presented and discussed: a steadily increasing membership of the health plan illustrates its appropriateness, while a doubling of the cost recovery of the hospital's operating costs after two years seems promising; the hospitalization rate of members of the health plan was significantly higher than for non-members. These findings suggest that a health zone may be an appropriate level for the organization of a regional pre-paid health plan.

50|$|Tanomoshi, {{denoting}} {{a locally}} organized social <b>finance</b> <b>scheme,</b> has existed in Japan {{at least since}} the middle Kamakura Period (1185-1333). The principle was that each member would contribute a sum at regular intervals and would receive a single payment when their turn came round; it required mutual trust among those involved. The institution facilitated personal savings, investment in property and enterprise, insurance, personal loans and assistance of poorer people. By the Tokugawa Period (1603-1868) tanomoshi was widespread. During the later 19th century under the Meiji, commercial banks developed, but as the banks were reluctant to offer small-scale and personal banking services they did not altogether supersede tanomoshi, which were incorporated into mutually financed mujin companies in 1915. Neither was tanomoshi fully replaced by state social security when it was implemented in the early 20th century. The system also operated among Japanese immigrants to the United States and Brazil, helping them in establishing new businesses there. Indeed while it diminished in Japan itself it remained of great importance to overseas Japanese communities.|$|E
