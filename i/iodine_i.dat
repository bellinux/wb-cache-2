A chlorine atom is generated from elemental chlorine, which abstracts a hydrogen atom from methane, resulting {{in the formation of}} hydrogen chloride.

Similar reactions can produce dichloromethane (CH2Cl2), chloroform (CHCl3), and, ultimately, carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), depending upon reaction conditions and the chlorine to methane ratio.|$|E
60|$|Upon inquiry I {{learned from}} Nielsen that Buck was coming somewhere {{back along the}} trail hopping along on three legs. I rode on down to my camp, and {{procuring}} a bottle of <b>iodine</b> <b>I</b> walked back {{in the hope of}} doing Buck a good turn. During my absence he had reached camp, and was lying under an aspen, apart from the other hounds. Buck looked meaner and uglier and more distrustful than ever. Evidently this injury to his leg was a trick played upon him by his arch enemy man. I stood beside him, as he licked the swollen, bloody leg, and talked to him, as kindly as I knew how. And finally I sat down beside him. The trap-teeth had caught his right front leg just above the first joint, and from the position of the teeth marks and the way he moved his leg I had hopes that the bone was not broken. Apparently the big teeth had gone through {{on each side of the}} bone. When I tried gently to touch the swollen leg Buck growled ominously. He would have bitten me. I patted his head with one hand, and watching my chance, at length with the other I poured iodine over the open cuts. Then I kept patting him and holding his head until the iodine had become absorbed. Perhaps it was only my fancy, but it seemed that the ugly gleam in his distrustful eyes had become sheepish, as if he was ashamed of something he did not understand. That look more than ever determined me to try to find some way to his affections.|$|E

For example, a drop of iodine on a slightly rotten part (not the skin) of an apple will stay yellow or orange, since starch is no longer present. If the iodine is applied and takes 2-3 seconds to turn dark blue or black, then the process of ripening has begun but is not yet complete. If the iodine becomes black immediately, then most of the starch is still present at high concentrations in the sample, and hence the fruit hasn't fully started to ripen.|$|E

At each I sites there are also three additional ligands that causes the iodine atoms to have a distorted octahedral coordination. This also causes the I atom to occupy off centered positions within each octahedron. The long bonds between the atoms at the I sites contributes significant bond valence to the bonded anions.|$|E

50|$|In some countries, {{flocks of}} {{commercial}} layer hens are force-moulted to reinvigorate egg-laying. This usually involves complete withdrawal of their food and sometimes water for 7-14 days {{or up to}} 28 days under experimental conditions, which presumably reflect standard farming practice in some countries.

In 2003, more than 75% of all flocks were force-moulted in the US.
