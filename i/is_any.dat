5|$|A wasp <b>is</b> <b>any</b> insect of {{the order}} Hymenoptera and {{suborder}} Apocrita that is neither a bee nor an ant. The Apocrita have a common evolutionary ancestor and form a clade; wasps as a group do not form a clade, but are paraphyletic with respect to bees and ants.|$|E
5|$|An f-deck is a {{data file}} that {{contains}} {{a record of the}} fixes of a storm's location and/or intensity. A location fix <b>is</b> <b>any</b> position estimate of the storm center. An intensity fix <b>is</b> <b>any</b> estimate of the storm's intensity. Both location and intensity fixes can be obtained by aircraft flying low-level penetrations through the storm center. Various methods that use satellite imagery or other remote sensing can also provide location and intensity fixes.|$|E

Six genera have been identified.|$|E
5|$|A {{diagnosis}} of hypothyroidism without any lumps or masses felt within the thyroid gland {{does not require}} thyroid imaging; however, if the thyroid feels abnormal, diagnostic imaging is then recommended. The presence of antibodies against thyroid peroxidase (TPO) makes {{it more likely that}} thyroid nodules are caused by autoimmune thyroiditis, but if there <b>is</b> <b>any</b> doubt, a needle biopsy may be required.|$|E
5|$|A {{metalloid}} <b>is</b> <b>any</b> {{chemical element}} which has properties in between those of metals and nonmetals, or {{that has a}} mixture of them.

5|$|A plug-in {{electric}} vehicle (PEV) <b>is</b> <b>any</b> motor vehicle {{that can be}} recharged from an external source of electricity, such as wall sockets, and the electricity stored in the rechargeable battery packs drives or contributes to drive the wheels. PEV is a subset of {{electric vehicle}}s that includes all-electric or battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs), and electric vehicle conversions of hybrid electric vehicles and conventional internal combustion engine vehicles. In China, plug-in electric vehicles are called new energy vehicles (NEVs).|$|E
5|$|A plug-in {{electric}} vehicle (PEV) <b>is</b> <b>any</b> motor vehicle with rechargeable battery packs {{that can be}} charged from the electric grid, and the electricity stored on board drives or contributes to drive the wheels for propulsion.

5|$|A {{transitional}} fossil <b>is</b> <b>any</b> fossilized {{remains of}} a life form that exhibits traits common to both an ancestral group and its derived descendant group. This is especially important where the descendant group is sharply differentiated by gross anatomy and mode of living from the ancestral group. These fossils serve {{as a reminder that}} taxonomic divisions are human constructs that have been imposed in hindsight on a continuum of variation. Because of the incompleteness of the fossil record, there is usually no way to know exactly how close a transitional fossil is to the point of divergence. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that transitional fossils are direct ancestors of more recent groups, though they are frequently used as models for such ancestors.|$|E
