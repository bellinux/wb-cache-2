500|$|Pablo is tall (...) , {{good in the}} air, and as {{a younger}} player was noted for his pace. Albacete {{teammate}} Miquel Buades suggested that those key attributes made him [...] "the {{worst thing that could}} happen to a forward". His coach at both Albacete and Atlético, César Ferrando, said he had all the qualities needed for his position, which included anticipation and the intelligence to keep things simple. Again according to Ferrando, Pablo rarely fouled, because [...] "he doesn't need to. He <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> arsenal of defensive resources." [...] A 2006 World Cup profile suggested he was [...] "much happier on the ball than first impressions may suggest", and could look [...] "ungainly". A scout's assessment of his running style as [...] "ugly" [...] reportedly discouraged Real Madrid from pursuing an early interest in him.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Madonna getting {{picked up by}} her chauffeur amidst a crowd of paparazzi. She appears to be irritated and exhausted. The chauffeur turns {{on the radio and}} she {{gradually}} calms down. Along the drive, the singer picks up several men who are scantily dressed with whom she sets off on a long ride through the town and country as the crowd continue to chase her. Madonna also picks up street dancers and exotic women in her car as the journey continues. By the end of the video, Madonna <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> group of people with whom she parties on the car, and throws out her chauffeur on the street, with his pants down. Interspersed throughout are scenes of Madonna actually filming the music video, with the crew seen in front of the convertible. The ending features an exhausted Madonna laying down in the backseat of the convertible as the chauffeur says in ," [...] which means in English: [...] "The party is over, now fasten the seat-belt, bitch!".|$|E

2500|$|... iOS 7 {{introduced}} a complete visual {{overhaul of the}} user interface. With [...] "sharper, flatter icons, slimmer fonts, a new slide-to-unlock function, and a new control panel that slides {{up from the bottom}} of the screen for frequently accessed settings", the operating system also significantly redesigned the standard pre-installed apps from Apple. Jony Ive, Apple's head of design, commented that [...] "There is a profound and enduring beauty in simplicity, in clarity, in efficiency. True simplicity is derived from so much more than just the absence of clutter and ornamentation - it's about bringing order to complexity. ... iOS 7 is a clear representation of these goals. It <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> new structure that is coherent and applied across the entire system." ...|$|E
2500|$|Addressing the couple's {{possibility}} of marriage, children, and divorce, Hansis pondered [...] "why can't people on soaps just date?" [...] He said [...] "maybe five {{years down the}} line {{they should have a}} kid, but not now" [...] and that [...] "ollege <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> slew of potential soap-worthy storylines. I think a lot of cool stories could come out of that". Silbermann voiced not knowing what the writers may have planned for the couple, but that [...] "the audience can assume it won't be smooth sailing". Hansis clarified: [...] "We have no idea what's happening until we get the scripts, which happens about a week in advance. We can talk to the producers if we want. I have done that once or twice, but they keep the writers and actors pretty separate." ...|$|E

2500|$|The album's title, Two Eleven, is a {{reference}} to both Norwood's birthday and the day her idol and mentor, entertainer Whitney Houston, died in 2012. Norwood declared selecting a title a [...] "tough decision". About the title, she stated: [...] "Some of the titles I was working with were Rebirth, Reincarnation, Reinvention, Resurrection [...] I just felt like Two Eleven describes all of that. It’s the day I was born, and each year, I evolve and change with time. It also <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> new meaning to it because I gained my angel. My icon is my angel now. It’s all tied in there and I just think it best represents who I am and the responsibilities I have moving on." [...] Dismissing ongoing reproaches, that she was [...] "trying to use the passing of Whitney Houston to sell records," [...] Norwood remarked that the title {{was nothing but a}} homage, “I need for everybody to know that, if it wasn’t for Whitney Houston, there would be no me, because she was the possibility for me. She was the vision of my dreams actually coming true, and she meant everything to me.” The official album, photograpphed by Gomillion & Leupold, cover was revealed on August 29, 2012. The deluxe edition cover is entirely identical to the standard edition but is tinged yellow.|$|E
2500|$|I was {{absolutely}} gobsmacked. I said, “This is horrible. Horrible!” And it’s a very slow, sinking feeling when you’re watching the movie, {{and the first}} scene comes out, and you’re like, “Oh, that’s a really bad scene.” But you say, “Well, that’s okay, the next one’ll be better.” And you somehow try to convince yourself that it’s going to get better… and it just gets worse. And I was like, “Wow. That was crazy.” I mean, I really didn’t see that coming. So at that point, I distanced myself from the movie. Now, of course, it <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> other life {{as a sort of}} inadvertent… satire. No, “satire” isn’t the right word. But it’s inadvertently funny. So it’s found its place. It provides entertainment, though not in the way I think it was originally intended. It was just… maybe the wrong material with the wrong director and the wrong cast.Showgirls was universally derided by film critics. Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a rating of 19% based on 48 reviews with the consensus; [...] "Vile, contemptible, garish, and misogynistic -- and that might just be exactly Showgirls' point." [...] Metacritic give the film an average score of 16/100, indicating [...] "Overwhelming dislike. Roger Ebert, following a relatively mild negative review (2 stars out of 4), wrote that Showgirls received [...] "some bad reviews, but it wasn't completely terrible". The film remains heralded as one of cinema's worst.|$|E

So these histories of the Old-Testament saints are, in fact, histories of men who conquered by faith--histories of the power which faith in God has to conquer temptation, and doubt, and false appearances, and fear, and danger, and all which besets us and keeps us down from being free and holy, and children of the day, walking cheerfully forward on our heavenward road in the light of our Father's loving smile.|$|E
