5000|$|The {{production}} team picked the Philippine Navy {{as a major}} setting for the series. On March 13, 2013, the show's main casts Richard Gutierrez, Paolo Contis together with series' director Mark Reyes visited the Headquarters Philippine Navy (HPN) and paid a courtesy call on the Navy Chief, Vice Admiral Jose Luis M. Alano AFP. Aside from that, Gutierrez and Contis also signed up as Philippine Navy Reservists. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>Vice</b> Admiral Alano assured the network that the Navy will provide its full support and assistance to the series and said [...] "We look forward to this project {{in which we can}} show and highlight what the Philippine Navy is all about." [...] He likewise briefed Gutierrez and Contis about the rigid training and life of a Navy Seal.|$|E
5000|$|HipHollywood branded {{the trailer}} [...] "ridiculously hilarious", while Mic commented that it [...] "hit {{on just about}} every B-movie trope, drawing blank, confused, breathless takes from almost every major music publication." [...] Although Complex commented that the film was [...] "cheap AF sic", they added that it is [...] "coming from a place of love" [...] and that Baptiste [...] "definitely looks the part, and is clearly {{trying to get the}} iconic body {{language}} Shakur down." [...] On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>Vice</b> commented that the film's subject matter was [...] "quite bold", while Maxim branded its trailer [...] "wonderful and strange". Howl & Echoes praised Baptiste's acting, commenting that he [...] "captures Pac’s voice, appearance, and absurd hand gestures perfectly" [...] and added that the film [...] "promises to be the most sophisticated hip hop biopic yet made." [...] Crack branded the trailer [...] "straight up magic", adding that it is [...] "gold from start to finish".|$|E

50|$|An annual {{competition}} for {{gold and silver}} medals was held until 1854, when the club was closed, as disaster struck when the course was ploughed by the farmer {{who had come to}} own the land. Around 1886 the Scotscraig Estate, on which the club had been situated, passed into the <b>hands</b> of <b>Vice</b> Admiral William Heriot-Maitland-Dougall who was keen on golf. In 1887 he instigated the club's revival, restored the trophies and helped secure a course; it was re-opened for play in 1888, and by 1890 had been laid out as a nine-hole course. The club house was erected in 1896.|$|R
25|$|The {{death of}} Barrientos in a {{helicopter}} crash on April 27, 1969, initially left control in the <b>hands</b> of his <b>vice</b> president, Luís Adolfo Siles Salinas (1969).

30|$|Third, we {{calculated}} {{the correlation between}} scores of ownership items and disownership items when the asynchronous condition was subtracted from the synchronous condition for data collected from both questionnaires. We discovered significant correlations between ownership and disownership in Longo et al.’s (2008) questionnaire (r[*]=[*] 0.59, p[*]<[*] 0.05) and in Preston’s (2013) questionnaire (r[*]=[*] 0.63, p[*]<[*] 0.05). In short, the stronger the experience of ownership for the rubber hand, the stronger the experience of disownership for the biological <b>hand,</b> and <b>vice</b> versa. Moreover, {{we calculated}} correlations between the two questionnaires: correlations between ownership items (r[*]=[*] 0.57, p[*]<[*] 0.05) and disownership items (r[*]=[*] 0.76, p[*]<[*] 0.01) for the two questionnaires were significant.|$|R

50|$|In addition, another {{variation}} of the lay-up is the wrong-foot layup. Typically, this move {{can be seen by}} inexperienced players with poor footwork, however, when done intentionally, a wrong-footed layup can deceive a defender into mistiming his block attempt. In a normal layup, the left foot is used to step off when laying in with the right <b>hand,</b> and <b>vice</b> versa. However, in a wrong-footed layup, the right foot is used to step off when laying in with the right hand. This also helps to shield the defender from reaching across to block the shot; in reaching across however, the defender will likely get called for a defensive foul. Tony Parker of the San Antonio Spurs relies heavily on the wrong footed layup, largely due to his smaller size and deceptive quickness.|$|R
50|$|The {{notions of}} normal-form and extensive-form {{trembling}} hand perfect equilibria are incomparable, i.e., an equilibrium of an extensive-form game may be normal-form trembling hand perfect but not extensive-form trembling <b>hand</b> perfect and <b>vice</b> versa.As {{an extreme example}} of this, Jean-François Mertens has given {{an example of a}} two-player extensive form game where no extensive-form trembling hand perfect equilibrium is admissible, i.e., the sets of extensive-form and normal-form trembling hand perfect equilibria for this game are disjoint.|$|R

40|$|Eating is a multisensory {{experience}} involving {{more than}} simply the oral sensation of the taste and smell of foods. It {{has been shown that}} the way foods look, sound, and feel like in the mouth all affect food perception. The influence of haptic information available when handling food is relatively unknown. In this study, blindfolded participants bit-into fresh or stale pretzels while rating their freshness-staleness and crispness-softness. Information provided to the hand was either congruent (whole pretzel fresh or stale) or incongruent (half pretzel fresh, half stale) with what was presented to the mouth. The results demonstrate that the perception of both freshness and crispness were systematically altered when incongruent information was provided: bit-into fresh pretzel-tips were perceived as staler and softer when a stale pretzel-tip was held in the <b>hand</b> and <b>vice</b> versa. Haptic information available when handling food thus plays a significant role in modulating food perception...|$|R
25|$|During the 70s and 80s, the {{movement}} attracted substantial adverse publicity {{when it was}} thought to be a cult.

Under Honduran law, however, {{a majority of the}} total votes was required to be elected president; Villeda Morales lacked a majority by just over 8,000 votes.

40|$|Crossed homonymous hemianopia" and "crossed left hemispatial neglect" were {{observed}} in a woman with Marchiafava-Bignami disease. Two forms of "crossed homonymous hemianopia" {{were observed}}. Initially, Goldmann perimeter testing showed a left homonymous hemianopia with the right <b>hand</b> and <b>vice</b> versa. Later, confrontation tests showed a left homonymous hemianopia, whereas visual field testing using the Goldmann perimeter (kinetic quantitative perimeter) and the OCTOPUS (Interzeag AG, static automated perimeter) showed a right homonymous hemianopia with either hand. "Crossed left hemispatial neglect" was not seen with the left hand, but neglect of the left hemifield was seen with the right hand. CT and MRI showed a lesion occupying almost the entire corpus callosum. PET showed {{no significant differences between}} comparable areas of the left and right cerebral hemispheres. These findings indicate that both signs of interhemispheric disconnection were due to the callosal lesion. Moreover, the "crossed left hemispatial neglect" can be explained as being a consequence of the dominance of the right cerebral hemisphere for visuospatial recognition...|$|R
5000|$|In toss juggling, {{the shower}} is a juggling pattern for 3 or more objects, most {{commonly}} balls or bean bags, where objects are thrown {{in a circular}} motion.
