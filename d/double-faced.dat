However {{the interior was}} a riot of colour and medievalism as perceived through Victorian eyes; it included stained glass windows, and a large <b>double-faced</b> clock, thought {{to be one of}} only five around the globe. The chamber is decorated in a rich, almost Ruskinesque style, with carvings by a local sculptor William Brassington. Included in the carvings are representations of indigenous New Zealand species.|$|E

2500|$|The mystical {{writing of}} two {{brothers}} Jacob and Isaac Hacohen, which predates the Zohar {{by a few}} decades, states that Samael and Lilith are {{in the shape of}} an androgynous being, <b>double-faced,</b> born out of the emanation of the Throne of Glory and corresponding in the spiritual realm to Adam and Eve, who were likewise born as a hermaphrodite. The two twin androgynous couples resembled each other and both [...] "were like the image of Above"; that is, that they are reproduced in a visible form of an androgynous deity.|$|E

2500|$|As {{leader of}} the reform {{movement}} of Filipino students in Spain, Rizal contributed essays, allegories, poems, and editorials to the Spanish newspaper La Solidaridad in Barcelona (in this case Rizal used a pen name, [...] "Dimasalang", [...] "Laong Laan" [...] and [...] "May Pagasa"). The core of his writings centers on liberal and progressive ideas of individual rights and freedom; specifically, rights for the Filipino people.

2500|$|Due to its ethnic {{diversity}} {{and the existence}} of different languages and religious observations (Sunni and Shi'a), the musical tradition of Khorasan is very rich. From the north to the south, the music scene varies greatly. In the north of Khorasan, one can find the bakhshi narrating and singing, among other things, [...] "daastans" [...] (stories in old Persian), although they can also sing in Kurdish about the historical deeds of local figures. They accompany themselves on the dotar. A leading exponent of this type is the late Haj Ghorban Soleimani. One can also find in the north, the Asheq who play [...] "dohol" [...] (<b>double-faced</b> drum), the [...] "sorna" [...] (a kind of oboe-like reed instrument) and the [...] "qoshme" [...] (double clarinet made of the central nervure of the plumage of birds tied together). The Asheq are specifically associated with the Kurds and play at wedding dances and village feasts. In the East of Khorasan, near Torbat Jam, the main instrument is the dotar with some modifications, but there are no Bakhshi and the music is different. Here, the music takes the form of [...] "ghazal khani'" [...] and is performed by singers of quatrains and [...] "ghazals" [...] – lyric poems based on the invocations of mystic poets like Rumi, Attar and Sheikh Ahmad Jami. Purely instrumental pieces also figure in the repertoire.|$|E
