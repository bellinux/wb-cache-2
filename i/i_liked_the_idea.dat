500|$|Gibbard {{credited}} Nick Harmer's bass {{line with}} being {{integral to the}} song, noting inspiration from bassists Eric Avery and Simon Gallup. [...] Harmer said of the bass line, [...] "I immediately gravitated to the creepy, stalker-ish theme that Ben created with the lyrics and the piano chords.... <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> that once a stalker gets obsessed with an idea, it just keeps repeating in his head, so I wanted the bass line to have a repetitive, incessant theme." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Billboard magazine, Beyoncé discussed how excited she was about the collaboration stating, [...] "I loved working with Alejandro on 'Amor Gitano.' When I was asked to record with him, I immediately said 'yes.' He is extremely talented." [...] Alejandro Fernández stated that as the production [...] and recording of his album was nearly over, {{he was told that}} Beyoncé wanted to record a duet with a Latino male for her next album. He stated: [...] "So when they suggested it, <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea.</b> I thought it was spectacular. So we went, I gave her the song and she liked it [...] We recorded it in one day. She seemed like a fine lady to me, very humble, with a great voice." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with MTV News, Webb revealed that the video was a sequel of the music video [...] "Ocean Avenue"; [...] "The 'Holly' video expands {{on some of the}} elements of the 'Ocean Avenue' clip. There are references to it, particularly some scenes involving a suitcase. It refers to that world, and <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of paralleling the band's experiences {{over the past two years}} with some of the things [...] Ryan [...] is going through in this video." [...] Webb went on to add that the reason Key is sprinting through Los Angeles, once again, is not bad guys that are after him, it is his [...] "own personal demons". Webb concluded that before filming began for the video, he had wanted to learn the experience that Key and bassist Peter Mosely were going through in New York, as they moved there to begin working on Lights and Sounds, and about the things they saw while they were there.|$|E

6000|$|... "That's easy enough, and <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea,</b> I'm aching for {{something}} to do, that is, some new amusement, you know," [...] added Jo quickly.|$|R
6000|$|She flushed {{quickly and}} prettily. “I’ll admit <b>I</b> don’t <b>like</b> defeat {{any more than}} you do, or any more than <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of killing such pretty, inoffensive creatures.” ...|$|R
2500|$|Mel {{has been}} dubbed as a chameleon, and Outhwaite has {{suggested}} that she liked to bring variation to Mel's characterisation: [...] "When I arrived <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> Mel was feisty and strong. I didn't want her turning into a wimpy character like so many women in soaps. You know, they're either bitches or they're slags or they're victims. I wanted to give Mel a bit of everything. Every woman has all those elements to their character. It's just working out where they come and go, and I don't think that's lack of continuity; I think that's a three-dimensional character." ...|$|E
2500|$|The role of DS Ellie Miller was {{the second}} role cast. Producer Jane Featherstone first {{suggested}} Olivia Colman {{for the role of}} Ellie Miller, to which Chibnall (having also had her in mind) immediately agreed. Chibnall then specifically wrote the role of Ellie Miller for Colman, hoping she would agree to join the cast. Colman remained Chibnall's first choice to play Miller, and there was consensus among the producers to offer the job to her without the need for an audition. Colman says she was immediately drawn to the role: [...] "From the off I really liked the idea of the story, a hard story and an upsetting one, but <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of a whole community being affected by something and I liked the character of Ellie. ... And I liked Ellie. I find it hard to play a character if I can't feel any of me in them. Especially {{if you are going to}} be playing that person through the whole series you need to feel that connection." [...] She was also highly impressed with the script she read, calling the script one she [...] "couldn't put down" [...] and that she turned the pages [...] "frantically" [...] because it was such a good read. Colman says she also had heard that David Tennant and actress Vicky McClure were under consideration for roles as well, and she wanted very much to work with them. She accepted the role immediately after reading the script.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well;--I did. I {{thought about}} it a good deal, my lady. And <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of it very much." [...] Lizzie pricked up her ears. In spite of all his harshness, {{could it be that}} he should be the Corsair still? [...] "I am a rambling, uneasy, ill-to-do sort of man; but still I {{thought about it}}. You are pretty, you know,--uncommonly pretty." ...|$|E
5000|$|Band member Ian Kenny said [...] "the song is {{all about}} our own journey, where we’re going and where we can take things. It’s all about possibility, and <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of <b>the</b> romance {{that we can go}} anywhere." ...|$|R
5000|$|Yea, it's on. I'm {{not exactly}} sure how the farm animals are going to fit into this whole thing (you can't really ever be sure with farm animals...), but <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of {{comparing}} two people together. 11:10 am ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sir," [...] I replied, {{as soon as}} I could, [...] "I {{will look}} at the ship, get her character, and give you an answer at once. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea,</b> for it is {{pleasant}} to be one's own master." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{the more}} I thought of it, the better <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea.</b> I met a western {{man at the}} club and asked him about western resorts, quiet ones. 'Have you heard of Asquith?' says he. 'No,' said I; 'describe it.' He did, {{and it was just}} the place; quaint, restful, and retired. Of course I put him off the track, but I did not count on {{striking}} you. My man boxed up, and we were off in twenty-four hours, and here I am." ...|$|E
60|$|It is a {{world of}} surprises. They fall, too, where one is least expecting them. When I {{introduced}} Sellers into the book, Charles Dudley Warner, who was writing the story with me, proposed a change of Seller's Christian name. Ten years before, in a remote corner of the West, he had come across a man named Eschol Sellers, and he thought that Eschol was just the right and fitting name for our Sellers, since it was odd and quaint and all that. <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea,</b> but I said that that man might turn up and object. But Warner said it couldn't happen; that he was doubtless dead by this time, a man with a name like that couldn't live long; and be he dead or alive we must have the name, it was exactly the right one and we couldn't do without it. So the change was made. Warner's man was a farmer in a cheap and humble way. When the book had been out a week, a college-bred gentleman of courtly manners and ducal upholstery arrived in Hartford in a sultry state of mind and with a libel suit in his eye, and his name was Eschol Sellers! He had never heard of the other one, and had never been within a thousand miles of him. This damaged aristocrat's programme was quite definite and businesslike: the American Publishing Company must suppress the edition as far as printed, and change the name in the plates, or stand a suit for $10,000. He carried away the Company's promise and many apologies, and we changed the name back to Colonel Mulberry Sellers, in the plates. Apparently there is nothing that cannot happen. Even the existence of two unrelated men wearing the impossible name of Eschol Sellers is a possible thing.|$|E
5000|$|When {{he signed}} on to direct the film, Phillip Noyce remarked [...] "I liked the script a lot. Or at least, <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of jumping on the Joe Eszterhas bandwagon." ...|$|E
5000|$|... “Art {{itself has}} the {{potential}} to democratize aesthetics and reimagine aesthetic production as communal, available and non-hierarchical. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of demystifying aesthetics by communicating that we can all make aesthetic objects; it’s not simply for those with capital or power.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If that be so {{you will}} soon give over making--what you call a fool of yourself. For myself <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of wild oats. I look upon them like measles. Only {{you should have a}} doctor ready when the disease shows itself." ...|$|R
5000|$|... “If I’ve {{got on my}} Yep Roc T-shirt,” {{explains}} label co-founder Tor Hansen, “I’m {{not really}} a part of one music scene. I accept that, and I think it’s actually pretty great. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> that Yep Roc has <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of an all-inclusive approach.” ...|$|R
5000|$|RUBY chose {{abuse and}} neglect as a key theme as she [...] "...was really {{interested}} in taking on {{a different type of}} narrator. Most of my girls are from upper middle class families, living in pretty solid environments. I was intrigued by taking a girl who WASN'T like that at all and dropping her into this whole new world. <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> that you'd think it would solve all her problems—having a roof over her head, money, a family—but that it actually brought up a whole other set to deal with. Also, <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of my narrator having to sort of [...] "save" [...] someone else in order to save herself." ...|$|E
5000|$|Blay {{adopted the}} stage name thecocknbullkid, explaining, [...] "Initially I just {{liked the way}} it sounded - it gave me aural satisfaction. Then <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of calling myself a bulls**tter , it's all a bit tongue-in-cheek." [...] She began {{uploading}} material to her MySpace profile and networked with music producers, live promoters and managers.|$|E
5000|$|I was {{gripped by}} the idea of the Badjao, who live almost their entire lives at sea and yet are, even today, {{sometimes}} seen as foreigners and are ostracized outside of their own seaside settlements. <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of being naturally at home in this fluid place that, to everyone else, is strange and unfamiliar." ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{regards to}} the album's lyrical themes, Blasko told Rolling Stone Australia magazine: [...] "The basis is {{definitely}} my life, but <b>I</b> <b>like</b> to take it into a heightened reality. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of 'the character' on <b>the</b> record. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> musicals, <b>I</b> <b>like</b> it to be fancy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is the Christ-child, whose {{birthday}} we are celebrating. I got {{the best}} I could find, for <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> better than old Santa Claus; though we may have him, too," [...] said Mamma, holding the little image so that both could see it well.|$|R
5000|$|I think {{everyone}} has had that crisis at some point, {{trying to figure}} out whether they are a man or a Muppet... <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of people having that crisis, driving around, trying to figure it out. — Bret McKenzie on the meaning of [...] "Man or Muppet" ...|$|R
5000|$|Roger Glover says: [...] "I {{wrote the}} riff to [...] "Maybe I’m a Leo" [...] after hearing John Lennon’s [...] "How Do You Sleep?". <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> that the riff didn’t {{start on the}} down beat, like 99% of riffs do. Most of the songs on Machine Head were from the first take, or not long after." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2005, Diament {{said that}} his band name Temposhark was thought up when he [...] "woke up {{in the midst of}} a dream one night, at like 4am, and just said the word Temposhark. So it came from my {{subconscious}} I guess. Honestly it was that simple. I wanted a name that sounded strong. <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> that music could be a weapon. Something powerful." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of a self-contained, endless {{pursuit of}} {{perfection}}. But I {{have a problem}} with perfection. I don't think perfection is very artful. But there's something I liked about the image of a skater going in this endless twisted circle that doesn't have any real endpoint. So the object is not to stop or arrive anywhere; it's just to make this thing as beautiful as they can.|$|E
5000|$|In September 2013, Marling explained: [...] "I am {{a solitary}} person but I love people, I’m not a misanthrope. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of {{speaking}} only when it's strictly necessary. The closest I ever feel to people is in shared experience. I’m still exploring that, I don’t know where it's {{going to lead}} me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You go {{and start}} a new town, and when {{we are ready to}} swarm we will come out and settle there. You will want a {{newspaper}} very soon, and <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of running one myself much better than grinding away as I do now,' observed Demi, panting to distinguish himself in the journalistic line.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why not?" [...] {{retorted}} the fairy. [...] "I can {{see nothing}} wrong {{in being a}} boy. Make me a tall, slender youth, with waving brown hair and dark eyes. Then I shall be as unlike my own self as possible, and the adventure will be all the more interesting. Yes; <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of being a boy very much indeed." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{progressive}} {{rock band}} Genesis wrote a song, [...] "Eleventh Earl of Mar" [...] (found on their Wind & Wuthering album), about Mar and the 1715 Jacobite Rising. The lyrics {{were written by}} Mike Rutherford, who explains [...] "I had this idea after reading this history book about a failed Scottish rising. <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of him -- {{he was a bit}} gay, a bit camp, and a bit well-dressed." ...|$|E
5000|$|Axworthy took {{leave from}} the FCO in 2000 and in 2005 he {{resigned}} his position. He has said: [...] I thought that the FCO would be challenging, and <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of living abroad. I was right about that — but the FCO also {{taught me how to}} write, which was a bonus. But ultimately I wanted to write books, and I was never entirely at ease in a large, hierarchical organisation.|$|E

5000|$|In 2008, the City of Los Angeles {{launched}} a $40-million campaign {{to revitalize the}} Broadway district, known as the [...] "Bringing Back Broadway" [...] campaign. Some Latino merchants in the district {{expressed concern that the}} campaign was an effort to spread the largely Anglo gentrification taking hold in other parts of downtown to an area that has become the city's leading Latino shopping district. [...] A worker at one of the district's bridal shops noted, [...] "On one side, <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea.</b> <b>The</b> only thing is that I don't think they want our types of businesses." ...|$|R
2500|$|At {{the time}} of the KLF's {{retirement}} announcement, Drummond's old friend and colleague David Balfe said of Drummond's KLF career that [...] "the path he's trod is a more artistic one than mine. I know that deep down <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of building up a very successful career, where Bill is more interested in weird stuff.... I think the very avoidance of cliché has become their particular cliché".|$|R
