5|$|The taxonomic affinities of the broad-billed parrot are undetermined. Considering {{its large}} jaws and other osteological features, the ornithologists Edward Newton and Hans Gadow thought {{it to be}} {{closely related to the}} Rodrigues parrot (Necropsittacus rodricanus) in 1893, but were unable to <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> both belonged in the same genus, since a crest was only known from the latter. The British ornithologist Graham S. Cowles instead found their skulls too {{dissimilar}} for them to be close relatives in 1987.|$|E

5|$|In November 1978, Thorpe, Holmes {{and two of}} the latter's {{business}} acquaintances—John le Mesurier and George Deakin—appeared before magistrates at Minehead, Somerset, in a committal {{hearing to}} <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> should stand trial. The court heard evidence of a conspiracy from Scott, Newton and Bessell; it also learned that Bessell was being paid £50,000 by The Sunday Telegraph for his story. At the conclusion, the four defendants were committed for trial at the Old Bailey. This was set to begin on 30 April 1979, but when in March the government fell, and a general election was called for 3 May, the trial was postponed until 8 May.|$|E
5|$|Morality is {{measured}} by Paragon (charm) and Renegade (intimidate) points. These points affect the availability of new special Paragon and Renegade dialogue options with significant impact in the game. For example, the game features some missions to gain the loyalty of the squad. What the player does during one of these missions will <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> gain the loyalty of a squad member, which in turn will unlock a special power and also help in the final battle. Endings range from the entire team surviving to the entire team being killed, Shepard included, and everything in between. Upon completing the game, a New Game Plus option is unlocked, allowing players to replay the game using the same character with which they finished it.|$|E
5|$|The NTSB report {{showed that}} the plane had several {{instances}} of maintenance work related to cabin pressure {{in the months leading}} up to the accident. The NTSB was unable to <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> stemmed from a common problem – replacements and repairs were documented, but not the pilot discrepancy reports that prompted them or the frequency of such reports. The report criticised Sunjet Aviation for the possibility that this would have made the problem harder to identify, track, and resolve; as well as the fact that in at least one instance the plane was flown with an unauthorized maintenance deferral for cabin pressure problems.|$|E

5|$|When a nodule is present, thyroid {{function}} {{tests are}} performed and reveal {{whether a person}} has a normal amount of thyroid hormones ("euthyroid") or an excess of hormones, usually secreted by the nodule, causing hyperthyroidism. When the thyroid function tests are normal, an ultrasound {{is often used to}} investigate the nodule, and provide information such as whether the nodule is fluid-filled or a solid mass, and whether the appearance is suggestive of a benign or malignant cancer. A needle aspiration biopsy may then be performed, and the sample undergoes cytology, in which the appearance of cells is viewed to <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> resemble normal or cancerous cells.|$|E
5|$|Many endemic Mascarene birds, {{including}} the dodo (Raphus cucullatus), {{are derived from}} South Asian ancestors, and Hume has proposed {{that this may be}} the case for all the parrots there as well. Sea levels were lower during the Pleistocene, so it was possible for species to colonise some of the then less isolated islands. Although most extinct parrot species of the Mascarenes are poorly known, subfossil remains show that they shared features such as enlarged heads and jaws, reduced pectoral bones, and robust leg bones. Newton and Gadow found the Rodrigues parrot to be closely related to the broad-billed parrot (Lophopsittacus mauritianus) due to their large jaws and other osteological features, but were unable to <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> both belonged in the same genus, since a head-crest was only known from the latter. The British ornithologist Graham S. Cowles instead found their skulls too dissimilar for them to be close relatives in 1987.|$|E

25|$|An attempt {{has been}} made to label the {{families}} as aquatic, terrestrial or intermediate, and an indication is given where it is thought that the species is introduced. Some introductions to Great Britain are quite ancient, dating from Roman times or even earlier, for example, Paleolithic. Those species that do not have a shell usually do not leave an archeological or fossil record, and therefore it is not always possible to <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> are native or introduced. Species are considered to be native, unless otherwise indicated on the list; this information is taken from Kerney, 1999, updated in the case of slugs with the opinions of Rowson et al. 2014.|$|E
25|$|It is {{straightforward}} {{to verify that}} a given graph with n vertices and m edges is claw-free in time O(n4), by testing each 4-tuple of vertices to <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> induce a claw. With more efficiency, and greater complication, one can test whether a graph is claw-free by checking, for each vertex of the graph, that the complement graph of its neighbors does not contain a triangle. A graph contains a triangle {{if and only if}} the cube of its adjacency matrix contains a nonzero diagonal element, so finding a triangle may be performed in the same asymptotic time bound as n'n matrix multiplication. Therefore, using the Coppersmith–Winograd algorithm, the total time for this claw-free recognition algorithm would be O(n3.376).|$|E
25|$|After {{several months}} of press publicity, leaflet drops, public {{meetings}} etc., captions started appearing on analogue broadcasts from the affected transmitters, warning viewers that the analogue service would shortly be switched off {{and that they would}} need to take action (for Whitehaven, the first large area to switch over, the captions started appearing some 5 months before the BBC Two analogue service was switched off). At about the same time, details of the Switchover Help Scheme were distributed. Although viewers who live outside existing Freeview reception areas were unable to test any digital receiving equipment they had bought at this early stage, test-screens on Ceefax (BBC One & Two) and Teletext (ITV & C4/S4C) page 284 made it possible to <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> were likely to need a new aerial or a signal amplifier to receive digital transmissions.|$|E

25|$|In the Cohen et al. study, the MOT task {{involved}} viewing eight black moving discs presented {{against a}} changing background {{that consisted of}} randomly colored checkerboard masks. Four of these discs were picked out and participants were instructed to track these four discs. The RSVP task involved viewing a stream of letters and digits presented against a series of changing checkerboards, and {{counting the number of}} times a digit was presented. In both experiments, the critical trial involved a natural scene suddenly replacing the second last checkerboard, and participants were immediately afterwards asked whether they had noticed anything different, as well as presented with six questions to <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> had categorized the scene. The dual-task condition simply involved participants performing the MOT task mentioned above and a scene-classification task simultaneously.

At first, they try to <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> are still alive. Eventually, they recognize that they are not dead and are on board a boat. They remember that Claudius had given them a letter to deliver to England. After some brief confusion over who actually has the letter, they find it and end up opening it. They realize that Claudius has asked for Hamlet to be killed. While Rosencrantz seems hesitant to follow their orders now, Guildenstern convinces him that they are not worthy of interfering with fate and with the plans of kings. The stage becomes black and, presumably, the characters go to sleep. Hamlet switches the letter with one he has written himself, an act which takes place off stage in Hamlet.|$|E
