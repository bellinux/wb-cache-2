60|$|The last clause is subjoined, {{because it}} {{by no means}} follows when two {{phenomena}} accompany {{each other in their}} variations, that the one is cause and the other effect. The same thing may, and indeed must happen, supposing them to be two different effects of a common cause: and by this method alone it would never be possible to ascertain which of the suppositions is the true one. The only way to solve the doubt would be that which we have so often adverted to, viz., by endeavoring to ascertain whether we can produce the one set of variations by means of the other. In the case of heat, for example, by increasing the temperature of a body we increase its bulk, but by increasing its bulk we do not increase its temperature; on the contrary (as in the rarefaction of air under the receiver of an air-pump), we generally diminish it: therefore heat is not an effect, but a cause, of increase of bulk. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> ourselves produce the variations, we must endeavor, though it is an attempt which is seldom successful, to find them produced by nature in some case in which the pre-*existing circumstances are perfectly known to us.|$|E

60|$|But <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> artificially {{produce the}} {{phenomenon}} A, {{the conclusion that}} it is the cause of a remains subject to very considerable doubt. Though an invariable, {{it may not be the}} unconditional antecedent of a, but may precede it as day precedes night or night day. This uncertainty arises from the impossibility of assuring ourselves that A is the only immediate antecedent common to both the instances. If we could be certain of having ascertained all the invariable antecedents, we might be sure that the unconditional invariable antecedent, or cause, must be found somewhere among them. Unfortunately it is hardly ever possible to ascertain all the antecedents, unless the phenomenon is one which we can produce artificially. Even then, the difficulty is merely lightened, not removed: men knew how to raise water in pumps long before they adverted to what was really the operating circumstance in the means they employed, namely, the pressure of the atmosphere on the open surface of the water. It is, however, much easier to analyze completely a set of arrangements made by ourselves, than the whole complex mass of the agencies which nature happens to be exerting at the moment of the production of a given phenomenon. We may overlook some of the material circumstances in an experiment with an electrical machine; but we shall, at the worst, be better acquainted with them than with those of a thunder-storm.|$|E
60|$|These {{objections}} {{have real}} weight, {{and would be}} altogether unanswerable, {{if there were no}} test by which, when we employ the Deductive Method, we might judge whether an error of any of the above descriptions had been committed or not. Such a test, however, there is: and its application forms, under the name of Verification, the third essential component part of the Deductive Method; without which all the results it can give have little other value than that of conjecture. To warrant reliance on the general conclusions arrived at by deduction, these conclusions must be found, on careful comparison, to accord with the results of direct observation wherever it can be had. If, when we have experience to compare with them, this experience confirms them, we may safely trust to them in other cases of which our specific experience is yet to come. But if our deductions have led to the conclusion that from a particular combination of causes a given effect would result, then in all known cases where that combination can be shown to have existed, and where the effect has not followed, we must be able to show (or at least to make a probable surmise) what frustrated it: <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>not,</b> the theory is imperfect, and not yet to be relied upon. Nor is the verification complete, unless some of the cases in which the theory is borne out by the observed result are of at least equal complexity with any other cases in which its application could be called for.|$|E
60|$|Although, however, direct {{verification}} is impossible, {{there is}} an indirect verification, which is scarcely of less value, and which is always practicable. The conclusion drawn as to the individual case can only be directly verified in that case; but it is verified indirectly, by the verification of other conclusions, drawn in other individual cases from the same laws. The experience which comes too late to verify the particular proposition to which it refers, is {{not too late to}} help toward verifying the general sufficiency of the theory. The test of the degree in which the science affords safe ground for predicting (and consequently for practically dealing with) what has not yet happened, is the degree in which it would have enabled us to predict what has actually occurred. Before our theory of the influence of a particular cause, in a given state of circumstances, can be entirely trusted, we must be able to explain and account for the existing state of all that portion of the social phenomena which that cause has a tendency to influence. If, for instance, we would apply our speculations in political economy to the prediction or guidance of the phenomena of any country, we must be able to explain all the mercantile or industrial facts of a general character, appertaining to the present state of that country; to point out causes sufficient to account for all of them, and prove, or show good ground for supposing, that these causes have really existed. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> do this, it is a proof either that the facts which ought {{to be taken into account}} are not yet completely known to us, or that although we know the facts, we are not masters of a sufficiently perfect theory to enable us to assign their consequences. In either case we are not, in the present state of our knowledge, fully competent to draw conclusions, speculative or practical, for that country. In like manner, if we would attempt to judge of the effect which any political institution would have, supposing that it could be introduced into any given country, we must be able to show that the existing state of the practical government of that country, and of whatever else depends thereon, together with the particular character and tendencies of the people, and their state in respect to the various elements of social well-being, are such as the institutions they have lived under, in conjunction with the other circumstances of their nature or of their position, were calculated to produce.|$|E

40|$|Excerpt] When we {{ask whether}} class size matters for achievement, it is {{essential}} to ask also, how class size matters. This is important for three reasons. First, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> observe <b>not</b> only achievement differences, but also the mechanisms through which the differences are produced, this will increase our confidence that the differences are real, and not an artifact of some unmeasured or inadequately controlled condition. Second, the effects of class size may vary in different circumstances, and identifying how class size affects achievement will help us to understand why the effects of class size are variable. Third, the potential benefits of class size reduction may be greater than what we observe. For example, suppose class size reductions aid achievement, but only when teachers modify instructional practices {{to take advantage of the}} smaller classes. If a few teachers make such modifications, but most do not, then understanding how class size affects achievement in some cases will help reveal its potential effects, even if the potential is generally unrealized...|$|R

60|$|Subject to the {{indispensable}} condition {{which has just}} been stated, I do not conceive that the part which conceptions have {{in the operation of}} studying facts, has ever been overlooked or undervalued. No one ever disputed that in order to reason about any thing we must have a conception of it; or that when we include a multitude of things under a general expression, there is implied in the expression a conception of something common to those things. But it by no means follows that the conception is necessarily pre-existent, or constructed by the mind out of its own materials. If the facts are rightly classed under the conception, it is because there is in the facts themselves something of which the conception is itself a copy; and which <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> directly perceive, it is because of the limited power of our organs, and not because the thing itself is not there. The conception itself is often obtained by abstraction from the very facts which, in Dr. Whewell’s language, it is afterward called in to connect. This he himself admits, when he observes (which he does on several occasions), how great a service would be rendered to the science of physiology by the philosopher “who should establish a precise, tenable, and consistent conception of life.”(103) Such a conception can only be abstracted from the phenomena of life itself; from the very facts which it is put in requisition to connect. In other cases, no doubt, instead of collecting the conception from the very phenomena which we are attempting to colligate, we select it from among those which have been previously collected by abstraction from other facts. In the instance of Kepler’s laws, the latter was the case. The facts being {{out of the reach of}} being observed, in any such manner as would have enabled the senses to identify directly the path of the planet, the conception requisite for framing a general description of that path could not be collected by abstraction from the observations themselves; the mind had to supply hypothetically, from among the conceptions it had obtained from other portions of its experience, some one which would correctly represent the series of the observed facts. It had to frame a supposition respecting the general course of the phenomenon, and ask itself, If this be the general description, what will the details be? and then compare these with the details actually observed. If they agreed, the hypothesis would serve for a description of the phenomenon: if not, it was necessarily abandoned, and another tried. It is such a case as this which gives rise to the doctrine that the mind, in framing the descriptions, adds something of its own which it does not find in the facts.|$|E

40|$|Virtual world {{simulators}} like Second Life {{represent the}} latest and most successful frontier of online services for entertainment and business. People have virtual lives in these worlds using personal avatars. Bridging real life and these virtual worlds together is challenging, but enables new application scenarios for these systems. Existing work focuses on the representation of objects inside virtual worlds. We believe that the overall experience will be improved <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> reproduce <b>not</b> only inanimate and passive objects like buildings and beer steins but also the subjects in these virtual environments. In {{order to have a}} seamless integration between the physical and virtual worlds, and to maximize scale of adoption, the system should rely on devices that people already use every day. For this reason, we believe that mobile phones are a natural and ideal solution. In this paper, we argue that the sensors embedded in commercial mobile phones can be used to infer real-world activities, that in turn can be reproduced in virtual settings. We discuss the challenges related to the implementation of such a system both from algorithmic and systematic points of view. We present the design of a prototype integrating a platform for inferring activities using mobile phones and Second Life. To {{the best of our knowledge}} this is the first time that sensors used on everyday mobile phones reflecting a person’s activity in the physical world has been expressed in virtual worlds such as Second Life. 1...|$|R
40|$|Employing {{a sample}} {{presented}} by Kaneko et al. (2006) and Kocevski et al. (2003), we select 42 individual tracking pulses (here we defined tracking as {{the cases in}} which the hardness follows the same pattern as the flux or count rate time profile) within 36 Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) containing 527 time-resolved spectra and investigate the spectral hardness, E_peak (where E_peak is the maximum of the ν F_ν spectrum), evolutionary characteristics. The evolution of these pulses follow soft-to-hard-to-soft (the phase of soft-to-hard and hard-to-soft are denoted by rise phase and decay phase, respectively) with time. It is found that the overall characteristics of E_peak of our selected sample are: 1) the E_peak evolution in the rise phase always start on the high state (the values of E_peak are always higher than 50 keV); 2) the spectra of rise phase clearly start at higher energy (the median of E_peak are about 300 keV), whereas the spectra of decay phase end at much lower energy (the median of E_peak are about 200 keV); 3) the spectra of rise phase are harder than that of the decay phase and the duration of rise phase are much shorter than that of decay phase as well. In other words, for a complete pulse the initial E_peak is higher than the final E_peak and the duration of initial phase (rise phase) are much shorter than the final phase (decay phase). This results are in good agreement with the predictions of Lu et al. (2007) and current popular view on the production of GRBs. We argue that the spectral evolution of tracking pulses may be relate to both of kinematic and dynamic process even <b>if</b> <b>we</b> currently <b>can</b> <b>not</b> provide further evidences to distinguish which one is dominant. Moreover, our statistical results give some witnesses to constrain the current GRB model. Comment: 32 pages, 26 figures, 3 tables, accepted for publication in New Astronom...|$|R
