40|$|During {{the past}} two years, private equity funds have {{acquired}} substantial portfolios of nonperforming loans from banks in Germany. Typically a private equity investor does not commit funds unless exit strategies are clearly defined. The usual exit strategies for distressed debt investors are fix <b>it</b> (<b>restructuring</b> and turnaround), sell it (sale of debt or equity), or shut it down (liquidation). A new alternative exit strategy for NPL investors considered here is the transfer of credit recovery risk.

40|$|It {{happened}} again last week. During a coffee break {{at a conference}} on applied ethics, in a cheerful and creative atmosphere, the woman in my group {{turned to me and}} asked with interest: “Now what is your company about? ” I responded: “We provide a comprehensive, personal James E. Gebhart, M. Div., Ph. D. service of assistance with downsizing [...] . ” My words were interrupted with a look on her face, now so familiar. It seemed as if a shadow enveloped her for a moment. Was it fear that this word “downsizing ” elicited? Some wound, still active? A surge of feelings of vulnerability? And then the shudder was past, and we continued talking. Except I never knew her private story. But one can only imagine that her story was not unlike the story of millions in America. Since 1980, in one-third of all households a family member has lost a job. One in ten adults, or about 19 million people, report that a lost job has precipitated a major crisis in their lives. Call <b>it</b> <b>restructuring,</b> lateralization, downsizing, or simply “being fired, ” it has been a time when so many speak of feeling bitter, anxious and disenfranchised.

40|$|For a sighted person, {{memory is}} {{strongly}} connected to vision and visual images. Even a memory {{triggered by a}} smell or sound {{tends to be a}} visual one. As a memory recedes over time, photographs can be used to refresh <b>it,</b> <b>restructuring</b> it in a particularly static, almost death-like way. A person who has died, for example, after time may be remembered more as their still visual image, captured in a photograph, than as the sum of their personality, actions, or essential human-ness. For people without vision, however, memory works in a different way. The transition from visual to non-visual memories can be traumatic, as shown in one recently-blind person’s account of that change. The only way for a person without sight to refresh fading visual memories is by description, usually from a sighted person, and this re-structures their memories in a verbal rather than visual way, through community rather than in isolation. For born-blind people, or people who lost their sight very early in life, memory is entirely structured by the remaining four senses, and can offer an insight into a more embodied, more lifelike form of recollection than the paucity of the visual image constructed through photographs. This paper will argue that different forms of memory can deeply affect our experience as human beings, and that photographs are the least ‘human’ way of remembering people. Objects and dialogue remind us of people - ourselves and others - in a much more vital, life-like way. As there is surprisingly little in the literature on visual culture on how visual memories are formed, I will combine my personal observations on memories with those from my sources (which also eliminates the risk of misinterpreting how others might read images and objects) ...|$|E

40|$|In this draft chapter, Professor Pierce {{provides}} an overview of the ongoing process through which the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has been attempting to restructure the U. S. electricity industry to create effectively competitive wholesale electricity markets for almost two decades and of the merger policies FERC has adopted and applied during that period. Pierce gives FERC high marks for adopting as its own the DOJ/FTC merger guidelines and then attempting to apply those guidelines to the unique characteristics of the evolving competitive electricity markets FERC has been attempting to create. He identifies three difficult systemic questions FERC has encountered in that process, however: (1) Whether to evaluate proposed mergers {{based on the assumption that}} future markets will resemble present markets when FERC expects that future markets will differ significantly from present markets in the near future? (2) If FERC decides to evaluate proposed mergers based on the assumption that the potentially affected markets will change significantly in the near future, which of several potential future market environments should it use as the basis for its evaluation? (3) Whether to adopt a passive merger policy in which the agency only reacts to structural changes proposed by private market participants or instead to adopt a proactive policy in which the agency attempts to use its power to condition its approval of mergers on the merged firm 2 ̆ 7 s commitment to make other structural changes that FERC considers essential to the success of <b>it</b> <b>restructuring</b> program. Pierce describes the extreme difficulty FERC has encountered in answering those questions. The basic problem remains the same in 2005 as it was almost twenty years ago when FERC began its efforts to restructure the electricity market. FERC lacks the power to require market participants to restructure in the ways that are essential to create effectively competitive markets, and it lacks the prescience to be able to predict how the restructuring process will evolve. After almost two decades, FERC has only reached about the halfway point in the restructuring process, and it still cannot predict with confidence some of the most important characteristics of the markets in which firms that propose to merge will participate in the future. Pierce concludes that the severe problems FERC has encountered have little to do with its merger policies. They are primarily attributable to Congress 2 ̆ 7 s decision to give FERC a mandate to create an effectively competitive wholesale market without giving FERC the regulatory powers required to implement that mandate. He also concludes that, to the extent that merger policy is an important element of the program to restructure the U. S. electricity industry, the situation remains as Professor (now-Justice) Stephen Breyer and Professor Paul MacAvoy found it in their 1974 study of the structure of the industry - we need many more mergers if we want to improve the performance of the electricity market...|$|E
