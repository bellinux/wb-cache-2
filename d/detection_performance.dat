2500|$|Jeffress' {{approach}} to understanding sensory and perceptual behavior {{was to examine}} the physical stimulus carefully first to attempt to isolate those aspects of it that appeared to be critical. Perhaps the best example of this was his treatment of signal-detection theory as applied to human observers: [...] "reinventing" [...] signal-detection from a physics perspective, according to the AJP. In a series of papers published in the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America in the 1960s, Jeffress developed what he called a [...] "stimulus-oriented" [...] view of human <b>detection</b> <b>performance.</b> The AJP called his 1964 article, [...] "Stimulus-Oriented Approach to Detection Theory," [...] a classic.|$|E
2500|$|Research {{into the}} {{relationship}} between music and cognition is an emerging field related {{to the study of}} speech perception. Originally it was theorized that the neural signals for music were processed in a specialized [...] "module" [...] in the right hemisphere of the brain. Conversely, the neural signals for language were to be processed by a similar [...] "module" [...] in the left hemisphere. However, utilizing technologies such as fMRI machines, research has shown that two regions of the brain traditionally considered exclusively to process speech, Broca's and Wernicke's areas, also become active during musical activities such as listening to a sequence of musical chords. Other studies, such as one performed by Marques et al. in 2006 showed that 8-year-olds who were given six months of musical training showed an increase in both their pitch <b>detection</b> <b>performance</b> and their electrophysiological measures when made to listen to an unknown foreign language.|$|E

2500|$|... the world's first nuclear submarine, was {{operational}} in 1955; the Soviets {{followed this}} {{only three years}} later with their first Project 627 [...] "Kit"-class SSN (NATO November class). Since a nuclear submarine could maintain a high speed at a deep depth indefinitely, conventional SSKs would be useless against them except in shallow water. As the development and deployment of nuclear submarines proceeded, in 1957-59 the US Navy's SSKs were redesignated and decommissioned or reassigned to other duties. It had become apparent that all nuclear submarines would have to perform ASW missions. Research proceeded rapidly to maximize {{the potential of the}} nuclear submarine for this and other missions. The US Navy developed a fully streamlined hull form and tested other technologies with the conventional , commissioned in 1953. The new hull form was first operationalized with the five Skipjack class boats, which entered service beginning in 1959. The lead ship of the class was declared the [...] "world's fastest submarine" [...] following trials in 1958, although the actual speed was kept secret. Sonar research showed that a sonar sphere capable of three-dimensional operation, mounted at the very bow of a streamlined submarine, would increase <b>detection</b> <b>performance.</b> This was recommended by Project Nobska, a 1956 study ordered by Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Arleigh Burke.|$|E

The investigated analytical models are expressed in terms of various HOS statistical parameters (of the third and fourth orders).

40|$|Original {{methods of}} radar <b>detection</b> <b>performances</b> {{analysis}} are de-rived for a fluctuating or non-fluctuating target embedded in addi-tive and a priori unknown noise. This kind of noise can be, for ex-ample, the sea or ground clutter encountered in surface-sited radar {{for the detection}} of target illuminated at low grazing angles or in high resolution radar. For these cases, the spiky clutter tends to have a statistic which strongly differs from the gaussian assump-tion. Therefore, the detection theory becomes difficult to perform since the nature of statistics has to be known. The new methods proposed here are based on the parametric modelisation of the mo-ment generating function of the noise envelope by Pade ́ approxi-mation and lead to a powerful estimation of its probability density function.

This occurs in both experienced and novice task performers. Vigilance had traditionally been associated with low cognitive demand and vigilance decrement with a decline in arousal pursuant to the low cognitive demand, but these views are no longer widely held. More recent studies indicate that vigilance is hard work, requiring the allocation of significant cognitive resources, and inducing significant levels of stress.|$|E
