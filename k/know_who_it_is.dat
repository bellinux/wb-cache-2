When I get ready to go visit that country, I’ll <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> but until then, I want to focus on the big issues that we need to solve.” ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 30, 2003, President Bush {{said that}} {{if there had been}} [...] "a leak" [...] from his {{administration}} about Plame, [...] "I want to <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> ... and if the person has violated law, the person will be taken care of." [...] Initially, the White House denied that Karl Rove, the White House Deputy Chief of Staff, and Lewis [...] "Scooter" [...] Libby, Chief of Staff of Vice President Dick Cheney, were involved in the leak.|$|E
2500|$|At the Old Trafford Roses Match in 1926, {{a record}} 78,617 spectators paid {{to watch the}} match peter out into a high scoring draw, with centuries from Lancashire's Harry Makepeace (126), Ernest Tyldesley (139) and 92 from Frank Watson being {{answered}} by Yorkshire legends Percy Holmes (143) and Herbert Sutcliffe (89) who put on 199 {{as if to make}} amends for events 2 years previously. Leonard Green, Lancashire's captain, was batting when the score stood at 499. Neville Cardus relates the story that Green said to himself [...] "It's not likely that Lancashire ever again will score 500 against Yorkshire, so I'm going to get this single run if it kills me." [...] He pushed a ball from Wilfred Rhodes to the off-side and ran 'like the wind'. The ball was hurled back in anger by Yorkshire legend Emmott Robinson, striking Rhodes on the wrist while Green dived to make his ground. Picking himself up he heard Rhodes muttering to himself:"There's somebody runnin' up and down this wicket. Ah don't <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> but there's some-body runnin' up and down this wicket." [...] The operative words in that famous lamentation are, [...] "Ah don't know who it is." ...|$|E

2500|$|Richie {{said that}} about halfway through the reveal episode, Alfie [...] "resigns himself {{to the fact that}} it's over between Kat and Alfie, there is no going back", and said that Neilson said halfway through the 15-minute scene that Alfie would be thinking, [...] "I {{understand}} you've done this with somebody... We can get over this... What do you mean... it's been going on for months? We can get over it, because I know you don't love him... What, you love this guy? It's someone we know? Someone in the pub...?", and said that Alfie needs to <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> for his own peace of mind, though [...] "his whole life just crumbles in his hands". Richie said that viewers would be surprised by the final reveal, stating that [...] "it's really interesting about how we play the Branning card as to which one of them it is. The way it's worded, you believe it's one brother in particular and then that all changes and you go, 'oh it's him!' Because we make people believe it's another Branning—the way its worded, the way I face up to one of them. The audience will all think it's one person in particular, but then I throw a curve ball and it all kicks off. It's great." [...] Richie said that Alfie cannot understand why Kat is having an affair with Derek, which [...] "makes him sick". He also stated that viewers would find out in January 2013 why Kat had the affair with the person she did. He said: [...] "It's an ongoing story, which is really interesting, to see why Kat was with Alfie and why she went for this bloke because they both offer her different things." [...] Richie speculated that the reason Kat had an affair with Derek is [...] "because Derek is the total polar opposite of Alfie" [...] and Kat is [...] "attracted to danger", which is not like Alfie, and Kat is [...] "used to danger, she's used to excitement. What she got from Alfie was the fairytale, what she wanted was the nightmare". However, the reasons for Kat having the affair were never explained on screen.|$|E
