500|$|Kohli's {{father died}} on 18 December 2006 {{due to a}} stroke after being bed-ridden for a month. Regarding his early life, Kohli has said in an interview, [...] "I've seen a lot in life. Losing my father at a young age, the family {{business}} not doing too well, staying in a rented place. There were tough times for the family... It's all embedded in my memory." [...] According to Kohli, his father supported his cricket training during his childhood, [...] "My father was my biggest support. He {{was the one who}} <b>drove</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> practice everyday. I miss his presence sometimes." ...|$|E
500|$|Gandhi {{participated in}} South African {{war against the}} Boers, on the British side in 1899. Both the Dutch {{settlers}} called Boers and the imperial British at that time discriminated against the coloured races they considered as inferior, and Gandhi later wrote about his conflicted beliefs during the Boer war. He stated that [...] "when the war was declared, my personal sympathies were all with the Boers, but my loyalty to the British rule <b>drove</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> participation with the British in that war". According to Gandhi, he felt that since he was demanding his rights as a British citizen, it was also his duty to serve the British forces in the defence of the British Empire.|$|E
2500|$|... "First, then, {{the facts}} <b>drove</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> Socialism. The injustices, misery, and wretchedness, and the unequal {{struggle}} of the workers against such frightful odds compelled me to study {{the underlying causes of}} this social agony — and I became a Socialist.|$|E
6000|$|... "Forgotten! I {{can never}} forget them! They <b>drove</b> <b>me</b> nearly <b>to</b> despair, {{and were the}} cause of {{bringing}} us all into this difficulty." ...|$|R
6000|$|... (I was afraid--literally afraid--to turn my eyes Oscar's way. I {{glanced at}} Nugent instead. There was a devilish {{smile on his}} face that it nearly <b>drove</b> <b>me</b> mad <b>to</b> see.) ...|$|R
6000|$|Then it {{was that}} some spirit stirred in my heart which <b>drove</b> <b>me</b> on <b>to</b> step between the priest and his prey. Standing {{in the doorway of}} the chapel, a tall, young shape against the gloom behind, I said in a steady voice: ...|$|R
2500|$|He persevered, {{and became}} the first ever to reach the Pole solo. Describing his 57-day push, he wrote, [...] "What <b>drove</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{continue}} then was the thought of countless people who had helped and supported me, and the knowledge that I could never face them if I gave up." ...|$|E
2500|$|In early 2003, [...] "You <b>Drove</b> <b>Me</b> <b>To</b> It", {{which had}} been re-mastered for the album version was re-released as a single. Shortly {{after the release of}} the album, the band went on tour with Feeder for five dates of their UK tour. Hell Is for Heroes' live {{appearances}} included the Carling Weekend Reading and Leeds Festival on the BBC Radio 1 stage.|$|E
2500|$|The band next {{released}} [...] "You <b>Drove</b> <b>Me</b> <b>To</b> It" [...] {{with the}} B-sides [...] "Things Fall Apart" [...] and [...] "Kill the Silence" [...] in January 2002.

The latter track included [...] "Folded Paper Figures" [...] on the B-side, which became popular with their fanbase, and was later re-recorded and used on their second album.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] Julian interposed, [...] "I {{can explain}} the tyre marks upon the road. Miss Abbeway <b>drove</b> <b>me</b> down <b>to</b> Furley's cottage, where I spent the night, late in the afternoon. The marks were still there when I {{returned}} this morning, because I noticed them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is Mrs. Judique. Do you {{remember}} <b>me?</b> You <b>drove</b> <b>me</b> up here <b>to</b> the Cavendish Apartments {{and helped me}} find such a nice flat." ...|$|R
60|$|Sir Henry Baskerville and Dr. Mortimer {{were ready}} upon the {{appointed}} day, {{and we started}} as arranged for Devonshire. Mr. Sherlock Holmes <b>drove</b> with <b>me</b> <b>to</b> the station and gave me his last parting injunctions and advice.|$|R
2500|$|Casually Dressed & Deep in Conversation {{saw three}} top-twenty singles {{including}} [...] "Juneau" [...] (#19), [...] "She <b>Drove</b> <b>Me</b> <b>to</b> Daytime Television" [...] (#20) and [...] "Escape Artists Never Die" [...] (#19). Funeral for a Friend toured feverishly to promote Casually Dressed & Deep in Conversation, including {{a series of}} European dates in which they opened for their idols, Iron Maiden. This was met with a mixed reception, as their style and fan base bore {{little resemblance to the}} heavy metal background of Iron Maiden. Also in 2004 Funeral for a Friend supported Linkin Park throughout America and headlined the second stage of the Reading and Leeds Festivals.|$|E
6000|$|... "Armadale himself <b>drove</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> it {{the first}} time," [...] she said. [...] "Manuel <b>drove</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> it the second time.--You cowardly scoundrel! shall I let you drive me to it for the third time, and the last?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{never mind}} me; {{have you seen}} Miss Caresfoot--the young lady you saw the day you <b>drove</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> the Abbey House--anywhere about lately?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Cæsar," [...] I heard Azalea Adair answer weakly. And then I {{went in and}} {{concluded}} business negotiations with our contributor. I assumed the responsibility of advancing fifty dollars, putting it as a necessary formality in binding our bargain. And then Uncle Cæsar <b>drove</b> <b>me</b> back <b>to</b> the hotel.|$|R
6000|$|Enter Strephon and Postilion. Streph:) You <b>drove</b> <b>me</b> from Staines <b>to</b> this place, {{from whence}} I mean {{to go to}} Town to marry Chloe. How much is your due? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was advised}} to {{cultivate}} cheerfulness, {{to go into}} society, to encourage kind people who tried <b>to</b> make <b>me</b> hear what was going on, {{to be on my}} guard against morbid depression, to check myself when the sense of my own horrible isolation <b>drove</b> <b>me</b> away <b>to</b> my room, and, last but by no means least, to beware of letting my vanity disincline <b>me</b> <b>to</b> use an ear-trumpet.|$|R

60|$|The day dragged on. Towards {{evening the}} weather broke suddenly, after {{the fashion of}} spring in England. Showers of rain <b>drove</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> the study.|$|E
6000|$|CHARTERIS (reproachfully {{sitting down}} beside her). And you <b>drove</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> propose {{to her to}} escape from you! Suppose she had {{accepted}} me, where should I be now? ...|$|E
6000|$|Leo. What, if I said, I was a woman, {{ignorant and}} weak, Were {{you to take}} the {{advantage}} of my sex, And play the devil <b>to</b> tempt <b>me?</b> You contrived, You urged, you <b>drove</b> <b>me</b> headlong <b>to</b> your toils; And if, much tired, and frighted more, I paused, Were you to make my doubts your own commission? ...|$|R
60|$|I {{went back}} into the hotel and paid my bill. Louis <b>drove</b> with <b>me</b> <b>to</b> the station and saw to the {{registration}} of my luggage. Afterwards he found my reserved seat, in which I arranged my rug and books. Then I turned and walked down the corridor with him.|$|R
60|$|After that I {{know not}} what I said; for, troubled as I was, the girl's bitter tongue and quiet way <b>drove</b> <b>me</b> wellnigh <b>to</b> madness. But this I know: I spoke so {{fiercely}} that she cowered before {{me as she}} had cowered before my uncle Sepa when he rated her because of her Grecian garb. And as she wept then, so she wept now, only more passionately and with great sobs.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was, it was!" [...] I cried, with heated vehemence. [...] "Be flames {{everlasting}} the dwelling {{of my soul}} if {{any other}} motive <b>drove</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> this shameful trade." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{all things}} {{must come to}} an end, and at length breakfast was over. My Uncle Enos and Kate <b>drove</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> Newville, and waited till the train rolled in.|$|E

60|$|I was {{entertained by}} the proprietary, yet ironical air {{with which he}} showed me the city. He thought in his heart that there was none in the United States to equal it, but he saw quite clearly that his {{attitude}} was comic. He <b>drove</b> <b>me</b> round <b>to</b> the various buildings and swelled with satisfaction when I expressed a proper admiration for their architecture. He showed me the houses of rich men.|$|R

5000|$|Bryan was {{committing}} suicide under a train. He {{came up on}} to the platform and introduced himself. I said: [...] "How nice to meet you, Mr Forbes.
