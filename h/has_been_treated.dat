5|$|One of Japan's oldest flags {{is housed}} at the Unpo-ji temple in Yamanashi Prefecture. Legend states {{it was given}} by Emperor Go-Reizei to Minamoto no Yoshimitsu and <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> as a family {{treasure}} by the Takeda clan for the past 1,000 years, and at least it is older than 16th century.|$|E
5|$|Chao {{are small}} creatures with a pudding-like body and behave much like human infants, with {{pleasant}} and relaxing personalities. Professor Chao, a minor character in Sonic Adventure 2, states that Chao are cute, and enjoy toys and being held or petted. However, they dislike being held while the player jumps, spins around, or throws them. Chao's diets consist of tree fruit and coconuts. Chao hatch from eggs found in Chao Gardens. When the player spends enough {{time with a}} Chao in the Chao Garden, the Chao develops a cocoon; it hatches from this as an adult. Eventually it develops another cocoon. If the Chao <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> well, the cocoon is pink and the Chao is reincarnated as an egg; the cycle then restarts and the Chao remembers the player. If, however, the Chao <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> poorly, the cocoon is gray and the Chao dies, removing every trace of itself from the game. Chao can breed to produce fertile eggs.|$|E
5|$|Non-septic prepatellar {{bursitis}} can {{be treated}} with rest, the application of ice to the affected area, and anti-inflammatory drugs, particularly ibuprofen. Elevation of the affected leg during rest may also expedite the recovery process. Severe cases may require fine-needle aspiration of the bursa fluid, sometimes coupled with cortisone injections. However, some {{studies have shown that}} steroid injections may not be an effective treatment option. After the bursitis <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>treated,</b> rehabilitative exercise may help improve joint mechanics and reduce chronic pain.|$|E
30|$|The {{prospective}} study {{group consisted of}} patients that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> with the PCCP between January and December 2004. The historical cohort consisted of patients that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> with the GN during 2003. The fracture types were 31.A 1 and 31.A 2 for both the groups.|$|R
50|$|Prolonged use {{of speech}} {{recognition}} software {{in conjunction with}} word processors has shown benefits to short-term-memory restrengthening in brain AVM patients who <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> with resection. Further {{research needs to be}} conducted to determine cognitive benefits for individuals whose AVMs <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> using radiologic techniques.|$|R

5|$|Spinosaurus {{has long}} been {{depicted}} in popular books about dinosaurs, although only recently has there been enough information about spinosaurids for an accurate depiction. After an influential 1955 skeletal reconstruction by Lapparent and Lavocat based on a 1936 diagram by Stromer, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> as a generalized upright theropod, with a skull {{similar to that of}} other large theropods and a sail on its back, even having four-fingered hands.|$|E
5|$|Already in his 70s, Sun falls ill and the {{restaurant}} is taken over by Hendra, who decides it will serve exclusively pork, alienating Muslim customers. Hendra comes into conflict with Soleh over Menuk, as Hendra had previously dated her. Menuk becomes increasingly depressed after Soleh tells her {{that he plans to}} divorce her, and they are driven apart. Rika feels stressed as a result of how she <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> by her neighbours and family after converting to Catholicism from Islam; Abi is also facing ostracism. Meanwhile, Surya and Doni (Glenn Fredly) are competing for Rika's affections. Surya is upset over his failure to find a good acting job.|$|E
5|$|Skinner is {{a former}} Marine and a Vietnam War veteran. In the war he once killed a boy at a very short distance, an {{experience}} which has scarred him for life. He is married to Sharon Skinner. He <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> at a sleep disorder clinic, suffering from recurring dreams of an old woman, which may either be a hallucination arising from drug use during Vietnam or a succubus. Skinner's hobbies include jogging and boxing, the latter {{of which has been}} shown in his ability to outfight Fox Mulder and X and to defend himself reasonably well when he was attacked by Alex Krycek and his men.|$|E

25|$|Since 1937 {{motoring}} taxation <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> as 'general taxation' {{losing its}} {{direct connection to}} the funding of roads and motoring infrastructure.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} {{motoring}} taxation was {{closely linked to}} the construction of roads until 1937, since when motoring taxation <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> as 'general taxation' with roads competing for funds with other departments on an equal basis.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the vast}} {{majority}} of commercial-grade ammolite <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> in some way, a small fraction of production requires no treatment other than cutting and polishing. Ideally, any treatments should be disclosed at the time of sale.|$|E

40|$|Fifty {{cases of}} {{tetraplegia}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> in the Spinal Cord Injury Centre, Military Hospital, Kirkee, {{during the past}} 4 years. Twelve patients <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> by tendon transfer of the hand to give a pinch grip. They <b>have</b> <b>been</b> made more independent and can be rehabilitated better socially. This <b>has</b> <b>been</b> found better than using any splint continuously...|$|R
50|$|Excoriation disorder, and {{trichotillomania}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> with inositol and N-acetylcysteine.|$|R
25|$|Late {{side effects}} occur months to years after {{treatment}} and are generally {{limited to the}} area that <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>treated.</b> They are often due to damage of blood vessels and connective tissue cells. Many late effects are reduced by fractionating treatment into smaller parts.|$|E
25|$|Access {{to water}} {{in urban areas}} is irregular, as 80% of urban water systems {{function}} {{for an average of}} 12hours every day. As of the year 2000, 25% of water in urban systems was disinfected and only 1% of all collected sewage water <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>treated.</b>|$|E
25|$|Metastatic cancers may {{be found}} {{at the same time as}} the primary tumor, or months or years later. When a second tumor is found in a patient that <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> for cancer in the past, it is more often a {{metastasis}} than another primary tumor.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the start}} of the CSME process and after the denial of entrustment, Montserrat <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> in the {{relevant}} legislation of other member states as being a participant of the CSME and Montserrat itself implements aspects of the CSME where possible for its own residents and for nationals of other CSME states (or provides more favourable treatment for such nationals where full implementation is not possible).|$|E
25|$|While falling {{within the}} strict {{definition}} of literature, the Bible is not generally considered literature. However, the Bible <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> and appreciated as literature; the King James Version {{in particular has}} long been considered a masterpiece of English prose, whatever may be thought of its religious significance. Several retellings of the Bible, or parts of the Bible, have also been made {{with the aim of}} emphasising its literary qualities.|$|E
25|$|Gold {{chloride}} {{is dissolved}} in water, mixed with other chemicals and poured on clean glass that <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> with stannous chloride. The gold layer is delicate and usually translucent. To make an opaque, affordable and adherent mirror, {{a layer of}} silver is deposited over the gold. Glass gilders use the term 'angel gilding' to distinguish the chemical process from gold leaf gilding also known as verre églomisé.|$|E

25|$|Since {{publication}} {{the genus}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> only once, in R. H. Zander's 1993 Genera of the Pottiaceae: Mosses of Harsh Environments. Zander found its morphology to be transitional between the Pottiaceae and the Calymperaceae, having many properties {{characteristic of the}} latter, and many properties characteristic of both. The only character of Calymperastrum that does not occur in the Calastraceae {{is the presence of}} a leaf hydroid strand.|$|E
25|$|Weakness or muscle {{weakness}} (especially {{in the large}} muscles of the arms and legs). This latter occurs in 60 to 80 percent of patients with untreated hyperthyroidism. Muscle weakness is rarely the chief complaint. The likelihood and degree of {{muscle weakness}} is correlated with the duration and severity of the hyperthyroid state, and becomes more likely {{after the age of}} 40. Muscle strength returns gradually over several months after the hyperthyroidism <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>treated.</b>|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, genuine use of social {{networking}} services <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> with suspicion {{on the ground}} of the services' misuse. In September 2008, the profile of Australian Facebook user Elmo Keep was banned by the site's administrators {{on the grounds that}} it violated the site's terms of use. Keep is one of several users of Facebook who were banned from the site on the presumption that their names aren't real, as they bear resemblance to the names of characters like Sesame Street's Elmo.|$|E
