40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which carbamate pesticides inhibit rat a 4 b 2 nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptors (nAChRs) expressed in Xenopus laevisoocyteshasbeen investigatedusing the two-electrode voltage clamp technique. Carbaryl, S-ethyl N,N-dipropylthiocarba-mate (EPTC), and <b>fenoxycarb</b> inhibitACh-induced ion currents in a concentration-dependent way. EPTC and <b>fenoxycarb</b> inhibit ion currents induced by 1 mMAChwith 3 -fold to 5 -fold higher potency than ion currents induced by 1 mM ACh. The potency of carbaryl appears to be independent of ACh concentration. <b>Fenoxycarb</b> dis-places 3 H-epibatidine bound toa 4 b 2 (nAChRs) with aKi of 750 mM, which {{is much higher than}} the functional IC 50 of 2. 3 – 11 mM.

40|$|SYNOPSIS. Comparative {{developmental}} and reproductive studies {{were performed on}} several species of estuarine crustaceans in response to three juvenile hormone agonists (pyriproxyfen, methoprene and fen-oxycarb). Larval development of the grass shrimp, Palaemonetes pugio, was greater than two orders of magnitude more sensitive to disruption by methoprene and <b>fenoxycarb</b> than was embryonic development. Developing larvae of the mud crab, Rhithropanopeus harrisii, exhibited reduced metamorphic success at lower concentrations of methoprene and pyriproxyfen than grass shrimp larvae. These responses suggest that the more rigidly controlled metamorphic process in crabs is more sensitive to compounds acting as endocrine disruptors than is the more flexible metamorphic pattern in shrimp. The final crab larval stage, the megalopa, was more sensitive to methoprene and <b>fenoxycarb</b> exposure than earlier zoeal stages. Mud crab larvae exposed to <b>fenoxycarb</b> had reduced biomass and lipid content, particularly triglycerides and sterols. Concentrations of <b>fenoxycarb</b> which reduced the reproductive capacity in single life-cycle exposures of the estuarine mysid, Americamysis bahia, {{were similar to those}} concentrations which inhibited metamor-phosis in grass shrimp. Juvenile mysids released by exposed adults and reared through maturation without further exposure produced fewer young and had altered sex ratios (lower percentages of males) at lower parental-exposure concentrations than directly affected parental reproduction. These transgenerational re-sponses may well be a product of irreversible effects during developmental exposures which become apparent following maturation and initiation of reproduction. These findings support using a functional approach as an appropriate screening procedure to evaluate potential environmental endocrine-disrupting chemicals in aquatic environments...|$|E
40|$|County, California. Water samples {{showed no}} detects of <b>fenoxycarb,</b> hydramethylnon, pyriproxyfen, chlorpyrifos, dimethoate, malathion, and methidathion.

40|$|Use of Juvenile Hormone Analogues (JHA) in {{sericulture}} practices {{has been}} shown to boost good cocoon yield; their effect has been determined to be dose-dependent. We studied the impact of low doses of JHA compounds such as methoprene and <b>fenoxycarb</b> on selected key enzymatic activities of the silkworm Bombyx mori. Methoprene and <b>fenoxycarb</b> at doses of 1. 0 ÃŽÂ¼g and 3. 0 fg/larvae/ 48 hours showed enhancement of the 5 th instar B. mori larval muscle and silkgland protease, aspartate aminotransaminase (AAT) and alanine aminotransaminase (ALAT), adenosine triphosphate synthase (ATPase) and cytochrome-c-oxidase (CCO) activity levels, indicating an upsurge in the overall oxidative metabolism of the B. mori larval tissues...|$|E
40|$|Three {{aromatic}} juvenoids (<b>fenoxycarb,</b> JH- 286 {{and a new}} pyrazole analog) {{were evaluated}} for morphogenetic, chromotropic, morphometric and prothoracicotropic activities on the American grasshopper, Schistocerca americana (Drury), and their activities {{compared with those of}} commercial methoprene and synthetic JH-III. <b>Fenoxycarb,</b> the most active insect growth regulator examined, was found to induce a significant mortality in developing nymphs and caused severe morphogenetic damage during ecdysis to the adult. Juvenoid treatment were also observed to promote some overaged nymphs and to induce chromotropic changes in both the cuticle and hemolymph pigmentation. Except for a reduced larvicidal action, similar levels of activity were obtained when <b>fenoxycarb</b> was tested on the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria (Forskal). The chromoproteins responsible for the green coloration characteristic of the hemolymph of S. americana and S. gregaria were isolated and characterized. Hemolymph from last instar nymphs and adults of S. americana was characterized by the presence of yellow lipophorin (Lp), a green chromoprotein (G-P), and two cyanoproteins (Cp-I and Cp-II). Treatment with <b>fenoxycarb</b> enhanced the concentration of the two cyanoproteins in nymphs and adults, and induced the appearance of a third cyanoprotein (Cp-F) in nymphs. Hemolymph from last instar nymphs of S. gregaria was characterized by the presence of yellow lipophorin (Lp) and two blue cyanoproteins (HCp and LCp), whereas only Lp and LCp were present in adults. Treatment with <b>fenoxycarb</b> increased the concentration of both cyanoproteins in nymphs, but only of LCp in adults. The non-steroidal ecdysone-agonist 2 RH- 5849 (1, 2 -dibenzoyl- 1 -tert-buthyl-hydrazine) was found to be an effective neuropoison when injected on S. americana. Treated grasshoppers became immediately hyperactive, followed by loss of coordination, paralysis and eventually death. We discovered that this insect growth regulator also induced bilateral autotomy of the methatoracic legs. However, no evidence of ecdysonergic or morphogenetic activities were found. Synergism studies with neurotoxins of known mode of action suggested that RH- 5849 has a mechanism of action similar to that of 4 -amino pyridine, which blocks potassium channels...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Juvenile hormone analogues {{have been}} tested as insect growth {{regulators}} in silkworm (Bombyx mori), seeking an increment of silk production. These chemical products, when applied in small or moderate rates, promote {{the extension of the}} last larval instar. In the cocoons and silk from 5 th instar B. mori treated with selected doses of methoprene and <b>fenoxycarb.</b> Quantitative parameters like larval weight, silk gland weight, cocoon weight, cocoon shell weight, were determined. Methoprene and <b>fenoxycarb</b> influenced positively the duration of the fifth instar and the weight gain of the insects. Comparatively to the control lot, the increment on silk production was approximately 24 % by the use of 1 ng methoprene...|$|E
40|$|The {{specific}} mode {{of action}} of juvenile hormone analogues on insects can also affect developmental processes in larval crustaceans. Impacts of the JHA, <b>fenoxycarb</b> on physiological and developmental processes were observed in the European lobster, Homarus gammarus at what {{are believed to be}} the most sensitive stages of development. Continuous exposure to a sublethal concentration of <b>fenoxycarb</b> (50 |j,g 1 ' ') through complete larval development displayed significant reductions in growth rate (3. 10 ± 0. 02 mm), compared to controls (3. 67 ± 0. 04 mm) (p< 0. 05). Incompletion of metamorphosis was observed in fenoxycarb-exposed larvae, with significantly prolonged intermoult durations (/ 7 < 0. 05) and a total inhibition in moult to the third larval stage. Significantly increased rates of O 2 uptake were observed fi-om fenoxycarbexposed larvae compared with control larvae during both day 7 and day 12 of the study. Low exposure concentrations of <b>fenoxycarb</b> used in this study caused endocrine disrupting responses in Homarus gammarus, this may have substantial ecological and commercial implications.
