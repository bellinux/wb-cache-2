She agreed, {{on condition that}} it serve a useful purpose, and suggested that it could raise funds for the Shaftesbury Society Babies' Home in Beaconsfield, on whose committee she had served since 1948. The club was established in 1952, and provided funds for equipping a Famous Five Ward at the home, a paddling pool, sun room, summer house, playground, birthday and Christmas celebrations, and visits to the pantomime. By the late 1950s Blyton's clubs had a membership of 500,000, and raised £35,000 in the six years of the Enid Blyton Magazines run.|$|E

In Parliament, William Pitt and Edmund Burke argued against the repeal, a betrayal that angered Priestley and his friends, who had expected the two men's support. Priestley wrote a series of Letters to William Pitt and Letters to Burke in an attempt to persuade them otherwise, but these publications only further inflamed the populace against him.|$|E

On 9 October 2011 in St Conleths Park Newbridge Michael Foley captained a young Athy side to victory against Carbury with a final score of 2.11 to 2.07. Athy scored 2–5 in the opening 15 minutes and two points in the closing four minutes but managed just four points in between, a period during which Carbury accumulated 2–4. Indeed, when Daryl O'Brien rasped home Carbury's second goal in the 57th minute {{to cut the deficit}} to two points, it looked as <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> have timed their run to perfection. The next score was crucial and it went Athy's way as Man of the Match Cian Reynolds held his nerve and calmly pointed a free.|$|E

500|$|The New Year saw Trenchard made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath and {{appointed}} Chief of the Air Staff on {{the newly formed}} Air Council. [...] Trenchard began work on 18 January and during his first month at the Air Ministry, he clashed with Rothermere over several issues. [...] First, Rothermere's tendency to disregard his professional advisors in favour of outside experts irritated Trenchard. Secondly, Rothermere insisted that Trenchard claim as many men for the RAF as possible even <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> be better employed in the other services. [...] Finally and most significantly, they disagreed over proper future use of air power which Trenchard judged as being vital in preventing {{a repeat of the}} strategic stalemate which had occurred along the Western Front. [...] Also during this time Trenchard resisted pressure from several press barons to support an [...] "air warfare scheme" [...] which would have seen the British armies withdrawn from France and the defeat of Germany entrusted to the RAF. [...] Despite the arguments and his differences with Rothermere, Trenchard was able to put in place planning for the merger of the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Naval Air Service. [...] However, as the weeks went on, Trenchard and Rothermere became increasingly estranged and a low point was reached in mid-March when Trenchard discovered that Rothermere had promised the Navy 4000 aircraft for anti-submarine duties. [...] He accorded the highest priority to air operations on the Western Front: there were fewer than 400 spare aircraft in Great Britain. [...] On 18 March, Trenchard and Rothermere exchanged letters, Trenchard expressing his dissatisfaction and Rothermere curtly replying. [...] The following day Trenchard sent Rothermere a letter of resignation and although Rothermere called for Trenchard and asked him to remain, Trenchard only agreed to defer the date until after 1 April when the Royal Air Force would officially come into being.|$|E

2500|$|The Aggadah records many miracles {{performed}} by Phinehas. Among these {{is that of}} having passed on dry ground through the River Ginai, which he had to cross {{on his way to}} ransom prisoners (Yer. Demai i. 3). According to another version, Phinehas performed this miracle while he was going to the school to deliver a lecture. His pupils, who had followed him, asked <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> without danger cross the river by the same way, whereupon Phinehas answered: [...] "Only those who have never offended any one may do so" [...] (Hullin 7a). To Phinehas is attributed the authorship of a later midrash entitled Tadshe or Baraita de-Rabbi Pinehas ben Ya'ir. The only reasons for this ascription are the facts (1) that the midrash begins with Phinehas' explanation of Gen. , from which the work derives its name, and (2) that its seventh chapter commences with a saying of his on the tree of knowledge. Phinehas was buried in Kefar Biram.|$|E

2500|$|The {{new type}} was {{intended}} {{from the beginning}} to replace the B.E.2, which was already attracting widespread criticism, and an attempt was made to address each of the earlier type's failings. [...] The more powerful motor was intended to improve the feeble speed and climb of the B.E.2 and to allow a better payload. This permitted the type to operate as a true two-seater, since the observer no longer had to be left at home when bombs or a full fuel load were carried, {{there was no need for}} his seat to be at the centre of gravity – as a result he could now be seated behind the pilot, in the proper position to operate a defensive machine gun. It was also possible to allow for a pilot's gun. The new wings had already proved themselves on the B.E.2e, maintaining the stability of the B.E.2c while providing rather better manoeuvrability, although the long extensions on the upper wing looked as <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> collapse if the aircraft was dived too sharply, which did not improve the trust in which they were held by some pilots. The new tail, as originally fitted, had a much smaller fin, which it was hoped would improve rudder control and allow the new type to turn more easily without seriously affecting stability.|$|E

Bennet tells Hank to keep him alive, referencing orders from his superiors to that effect. Furthermore, he states that Sylar will [...] "die on [...] terms," [...] not his own. At home, Bennet finds Claire and Zach are [...] "working on a school project" [...] together, according to Claire. Claire also acts as if she'd rather not spend time with Zach. [...] Bennet, however, tells {{her that she had}} been friends and encourages her to see <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> not find something in common. After Zach and she go upstairs, Bennet gets a call from Hank. Hank states that Sylar has died, which Bennet replies is [...] "less than ideal." [...] Bennet then tells Hank to prepare Sylar [...] "for shipping." [...] Back at Sylar's cell, Bennet finds the body of a dead Hank where Sylar should be. Bennet then turns around to find Sylar calmly standing in front of him. Sylar asks about Claire, then states his intentions to kill her. After telekinetically throwing Bennet against a wall and playing with the lights, Sylar leaves Bennet trapped in the cell. Later, at the Bennet home, he and the Haitian narrowly save Sandra from Sylar. Although Sylar escapes, Bennet is confident he will catch the killer. After the Haitian wipes Sandra's memories yet again, Bennet is called by Isaac Mendez. Mendez is revealed to be working with Bennet, as he relays information about Peter Petrelli.|$|E
2500|$|When printed ch, gh, sh, th are {{pronounced}} as two sounds, as in Shanghai, hogshead, and outhouse, {{then they}} are written as two braille letters rather than with the ligatures [...] Generally, other ligatures {{should not be used}} <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> cause problems with legibility, as with the ing in lingerie, though they tend to be with familiar words, such as ginger and finger, even if their pronunciation is divided between syllables. None of the ligatures are to be used across the boundaries of compound words. For example, [...] is not used in twofold, nor [...] in dumbbell. The rules state that they should not span a prefix and stem either, so for example the ed in deduce, the er of rerun and derail, and the ble of sublet should be written out in full. In practice this is variable, as it depends upon the awareness of the writer. The of in professor, for example, might not be recognized spanning prefix and stem, and no-one has a problem with a-cc-ept or a-dd-r-e-s-s, despite the technical violation. There is also conflict with the overriding tendency to contract sequences that fall within a single syllable. So the same writer who divides the er in derive may allow the ligature in derivation. A similar pattern emerges from suffixes: [...] is not used in freedom, since it spans stem and suffix, but is used in freed, because it forms a single syllable with the stem. What is considered to constitute a prefix or suffix is somewhat arbitrary: [...] is not used in Charlestown, for example, but it is in Charleston. Ligatures may also not separate digraphs or diphthongs in print. For example, aerial does not use , Oedipus does not use , and tableau does not use [...] Also, it is normal to use the letter [...] for the broken vowel in i-d-ea-s or c-r-ea-t-e, despite it being pronounced as two sounds rather than one as in head or ocean.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1950s the Athletics chant of {{the school}} (adapted by the Christian Brothers from their Australian schools) was urangabe, urangabe, urangabe uranga/Woolagalla, woolagalla, rumba/Flay them, beat them, yah mung do!/Christies, Christies, blue, gold, blue. One old boy, at SPC in the mid 1950s, has written that the Christian Brothers (being then [...] "Aussies") were not much {{interested}} in Rugby but {{were more interested in}} cricket, [...] "square-bashing" [...] and athletics. However, John Tamihere, at St Peter's in the 1970s, remembers the Christian Brothers (by then mostly Kiwi) being very enthusiastic about Rugby. He has written that if the Christian Brothers wanted a boy for the First XV, the boy didn't have much say in the matter. [...] "They would walk around the school grounds at lunchtime sizing up" [...] likely candidates to see <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> be any good. They picked out one boy because he looked usefully tall. [...] "I'd rather play soccer", the boy protested, [...] " ... but next minute there he was in the lineout, leaping." [...] Under such pressure, Tamihere played for the college First XV (in 1975 and 1976) although he would have preferred to play Rugby League for the Point Chevalier Pirates and later for the Glenora Bears as his brothers did. He said that the college First XV at that time was composed of [...] " ... not bad players", and they were [...] " ... always competitive". [...] "We didn't win a lot, {{but on the other hand}} we never really got hammered". [...] "St Peter's used to play St Kentigern's, who were led out onto the field by their pipe band. When we played Anglican King's College there was no doubt this was a Catholic versus [...] "Proddy" [...] battle, though some of our toughest games were against other Catholic schools like St Paul's and Sacred Heart. If you think Māori society was tribal, you should have seen those Catholics". There is also strong traditional Rugby rivalry with other schools such as De La Salle College, Auckland Grammar School, Kelston Boys' High School, Mt Albert Grammar School and the North Shore school, Rosmini College (The Battle of the Bridge). An annual senior rugby fixture between Auckland Grammar and St Peter's (The Battle of the Overbridge) is played for the Henry Cooper-Br. Paddy Ryan Rugby Challenge Cup in memory of headmasters in office in 1962 when St Peter's beat Grammar for the first time. [...] Amongst the college's Rugby highlights was winning by the First XV of the New Zealand Secondary School's Top Four Championship and the Auckland Secondary Schools Premiership in 1987. [...] The latter feat was repeated in 1988. The college won the Auckland Championship and the New Zealand First XV Knock out competition undefeated in 2000. The college has held the Moascar Cup (national school 1st XV rugby honour) twice, in 1977 and 2000.|$|E
