5|$|Interested {{in using}} sources other than archaeology, Grinsell {{made use of}} documents, place-names, folklore, and the {{accounts}} of antiquarians {{as part of his}} research. According to later archaeologists Amy Gazin-Schwartz and Cornelius Holtfdorf, Grinsell {{was one of the few}} archaeologists of his generation who was interested in the relationship between folklore and archaeology, comparing <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> way to continental European scholars Paul Saintyves, Horst Ohlhaver, and Karel C. Peeters.|$|E
5|$|On May 8, 1858, Brown held {{a meeting}} in Chatham, Ontario, where he {{unveiled}} his plan for a raid on Harpers Ferry, Virginia. When word of the plan was leaked to the government, Brown put the scheme on hold and began raising funds for its eventual resumption.

5|$|The Vinaypatrika is {{considered}} {{as the last}} compositions of Tulsidas, believed to be written when Kali Yuga started troubling <b>him.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> work of 279 stanzas, he beseeches Rama to give him Bhakti ("devotion"), and to accept his petition. Tulsidas attests in the last stanza of Vinaypatrika that Rama himself signed the manuscript of the work. The 45th stanza of the Vinaypatrika is sung as the evening Aarti by many Hindus.|$|E

5|$|The second arc is {{the story}} of Larc and Sierra—brother and sister dragoons who serve {{different}} dragon masters and fight {{on opposite sides of the}} same war for power. Larc serves the dragon Drakonis, who wants to kill the other three dragons so that he can rule the world. Larc blackmails the game's protagonist to help <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> quest. Sierra, a dragoon for Vadise the White Dragon, wants to stop Drakonis without hurting her brother Larc. In the end, Drakonis is defeated again and banished to the underworld, and Larc is killed.|$|E
5|$|According to the author, {{he began}} {{writing the book}} {{in the same way}} he began most of his books: by {{exploring}} a question that was unresolved for <b>him.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> case, the question became the book's title. In What's So Amazing About Grace?, Yancey answers this question by writing that God gives grace to people unconditionally, without their need to earn it. His book includes Bible stories, anecdotes from Yancey's life and accounts of historical events. Similar to his other works, What's So Amazing About Grace? has a self-deprecating tone. It describes Yancey's upbringing in a judgmental church, a theme Yancey previously explored in The Jesus I Never Knew and later returned to in Reaching for the Invisible God and Soul Survivor.|$|E
5|$|Arcadelt wrote over 200 madrigals {{before he}} left Italy in 1551 to return to France, where he spent the {{remainder}} of his life; his numerous chansons date from this and subsequent years. In 1557 he published a book of masses, dedicated to his new employer, Charles de Guise, Cardinal of Lorraine (Arcadelt was maître de chapelle, i.e. choirmaster for <b>him).</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> publication he was mentioned {{as a member of the}} royal chapel, and therefore must have served both Henry II (died 1559) and Charles IX during this late phase of his career. In Paris he employed the publishing house of Le Roy and Ballard, who printed his abundant chansons, masses and motets just as the Venetian printers had earlier printed his madrigals.|$|E

5|$|As {{the third}} {{son of a}} cadet (junior) branch of the Fürstenberg princely family, Karl Aloys was {{prepared}} for a military career. His tutor, Lieutenant Ernst, was in active service in the Habsburg military, and took six-year-old Karl Aloys on maneuvers with <b>him.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> way, he learned as a child the Habsburg military manual, and {{came into contact with}} important military men who later furthered his education and career; he also acquired an honorary rank as Kreis-Obristen, or Colonel of the Imperial Circle, {{by the time he was}} ten years old. As a youth, in 1776, he met the Habsburg war minister Count Franz Moritz von Lacy and Baron Ernst Gideon von Laudon; he was also invited to dine with Emperor Joseph II. He started his service in 1777 as a Fähnrich (ensign) in the Habsburg military organization. He saw his first field service during the War of the Bavarian Succession (1777–78), although he was not involved in any battles.|$|E
5|$|Dion {{moved to}} Asbestos, Quebec after the {{conclusion}} of his hockey career and {{became involved in the}} local minor hockey movement, often in the capacity of a referee. He helped establish an arena in the city, the Centre Récréatif d'Asbestos, in 1954, which was later renamed Aréna Connie Dion. Since 1991, the Asbestos Minor Hockey Association has held an annual tournament at the arena in his honor. He also became involved in golf, designing several courses and helping lay foundations for the sport in Asbestos. He had a local tournament named after <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> sport as well, the inaugural edition of which was held in 1973. He was married to Muriel Flanigan, who died in 2011, and had four sons, Paul, Skip, Bob, and Mickey, and one daughter, Carol-Ann. He died on November 7, 2014 at the age of 96 at the Centre de Santé et Service Sociaux in Asbestos, following a two-week period of hospitalization.|$|E
5|$|Ferens {{remained}} a modest man; he saw giving {{as a moral}} duty and repeatedly declined offers of ennoblement. In replying to the headmaster’s speech when he visited Kingswood school in 1926, the King said: The headmaster is right in assuming that I am already well acquainted with Mr Ferens’s benefactions {{in other parts of}} the country; this is not the first time I have been associated with <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> manner, and though I know the last thing that he would want would be a public expression of thanks on my part, I would like to be allowed to share in the debt of gratitude which the Kingswood School owes him today.|$|E

He instead sends a {{different}} D-Mail in an attempt to convince Faris' father to not part with the IBN computer. Beyond 1% divergence is achieved, but the divergence meter gives a strange output and none of Okabe's friends have any memories of <b>him.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> worldline, Okabe and Faris are a couple and live together, participating in Rainet Access Battlers card game tournaments.

5|$|On 8 November {{the body}} of a British constable, Moshe Rosenfeld, was {{discovered}} near Ein Harod. Al-Qassam and his followers were believed to have been responsible and search parties set out to capture <b>him.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> context, al-Qassam and twelve of his men decided to go underground and, leaving Haifa, took to the hills between Jenin and Nablus. There they spent ten days on the move, during which they were fed by the residents of villages in the area. The British police manhunt eventually surrounded al-Qassam in a cave near Ya'bad, in the village of Sheikh Zeid. In the long ensuing firefight, al-Qassam and three of his followers were killed, and five captured on 20 November.|$|E
5|$|Other British composers who feature {{significantly}} in Boult's discography include Holst, Ireland, Parry, and Walton. Despite {{his reputation as}} a pioneer in Britain of the works of the Second Viennese School and other avant-garde composers, the record companies, unlike the BBC, remained cautious about recording <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> repertory, and only a single recording of a Berg piece represents this side of Boult's work. In the core continental orchestral repertoire, Boult's recordings of the four symphonies of Brahms, and the Great C major Symphony of Schubert were celebrated in his lifetime and have remained in the catalogues during the three decades after his death. Late in his recording career he recorded four discs of excerpts from Wagner's operas, which received great critical praise. The exceptional breadth of Boult's repertoire has left some well-regarded recordings of works not immediately associated with him, among which are versions of Franck's Symphony (recorded in 1959), Dvořák's Cello Concerto with Mstislav Rostropovich (1958), and a pioneering recording of Mahler's Third Symphony taped live in 1947.|$|E

5|$|The show {{centers on}} Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In the episode, Mulder and Scully have 24 hours to save Assistant Director Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) from a biologically engineered disease. In order to combat the disease, Scully looks for a medical answer, while Mulder searches for the culprits behind the attack on Skinner's life. To aid <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> task, Mulder visits Senator Matheson, whom he hopes can help him find who is responsible before time runs out.|$|E
5|$|While {{stationed}} in Cologne, Müncheberg trained for the decathlon at the ASV Köln (sports club in Cologne) during {{his spare time}} and competed in various national and international track and field events. He even had a training field built on the family estate at Friedrichshof in Pomerania {{and at the time}} had strong ambitions to compete in the 1940 Summer Olympics. His commanding officers supported <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> athletic vision and gave him additional time off to practice for the Olympics. Müncheberg owned a dachshund (Dackel), which his mother had bred, named Seppl. The dog accompanied him from the start of World War II until his death on 23 March 1943.|$|E
5|$|Cibber's {{career as}} both actor and theatre manager is {{important}} {{in the history of the}} British stage because he was one of the first in a long and illustrious line of actor-managers that would include such luminaries as Garrick, Henry Irving, and Herbert Beerbohm Tree. Rising from actor at Drury Lane to advisor to the manager Christopher Rich, Cibber worked himself by degrees into a position to take over the company, first taking many of its players—including Thomas Doggett, Robert Wilks, and Anne Oldfield—to form a new company at the Queen's Theatre in the Haymarket. The three actors squeezed out the previous owners in a series of lengthy and complex manoeuvres, but after Rich's letters patent were revoked, Cibber, Doggett and Wilks were able to buy the company outright and return to the Theatre Royal by 1711. After a few stormy years of power-struggle between the prudent Doggett and the extravagant Wilks, Doggett was replaced by the upcoming actor Barton Booth and Cibber became in practice sole manager of Drury Lane. He set a pattern for the line of more charismatic and successful actors that were to succeed <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> combination of roles. His near-contemporary Garrick, as well as the 19th-century actor-managers Irving and Tree, would later structure their careers, writing, and manager identity around their own striking stage personalities. Cibber's forte as actor-manager was, by contrast, the manager side. He was a clever, innovative, and unscrupulous businessman who retained all his life a love of appearing on the stage. His triumph was that he rose to a position where, in consequence of his sole power over production and casting at Drury Lane, London audiences had to put up with him as an actor. Cibber's one significant mistake as a theatre manager was to pass over John Gay's The Beggar's Opera, which became an outstanding success for John Rich's theatre at Lincoln's Inn Fields. When Cibber attempted to mimic Gay's success with his own ballad-opera—Love in a Riddle (1729)—it was shouted down by the audience and Cibber cancelled its run. He rescued its comic subplot as Damon and Phillida.|$|E

5|$|HMS Shannon {{had been}} off Boston for 56 days and was running short of provisions, whilst the {{extended}} period at sea {{was wearing the}} ship down. She would be at a disadvantage facing USS Chesapeake, fresh from harbour and a refit. A boat was despatched carrying the invitation, manned by a Mr Slocum, a discharged American prisoner. The boat had not reached the shore when Chesapeake was seen underway, sailing out of the harbour. She was flying three American ensigns and a large white flag at the foremast inscribed 'Free Trade and Sailor's Rights'. Shannon carried 276 officers, seamen and marines of her proper complement, eight recaptured seamen, 22 Irish labourers who had been 48 hours in the ship, of whom only four could speak English, and 24 boys, of whom about 13 were under 12 years of age. Broke had trained his gun crews to fire accurate broadsides into the hulls of enemy vessels, {{with the aim of}} killing their gun crews, rather than attempting to disable the enemy ship by firing at the masts and rigging. This was, however, the standard Royal Navy practise of the time, only Broke's efficiency in gunnery training distinguished <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> regard. Lawrence, meanwhile, was confident in his ship, especially since she carried a substantially larger crew. Previous American victories over Royal Navy ships left him expectant of success. Just before the engagement, the American crew gave three cheers.|$|E
5|$|Peace did {{not last}} for long, as the {{political}} turmoil in Baghdad continued. In September 941, Ibn Ra'iq assumed once more the post of amir al-umara {{at the invitation of}} Caliph al-Muttaqi (r. 940–944), but he was not as powerful as before. Unable to stop the advance of another strongman, Abu'l-Husayn al-Baridi of Basra, both Ibn Ra'iq and the caliph were forced to abandon Baghdad and seek the help of the Hamdanid ruler of Mosul. The latter soon had Ibn Ra'iq assassinated (April 942) and succeeded him as amir al-umara with the laqab of Nasir al-Dawla. Al-Ikhshid used the opportunity to reoccupy Syria for himself, joining his forces in person in June 942, and venturing as far as Damascus, before returning to Egypt in January 943. The Hamdanids also staked claim on Syria at the same time, but the sources do not record details of their expeditions there. Nasir al-Dawla's position as amir al-umara also proved to be weak, and in June 943 he was ousted by the Turkish general Tuzun. In October, Caliph al-Muttaqi, fearing that Tuzun intended to replace him, fled the capital and sought refuge with the Hamdanids. Although Nasir al-Dawla and his brother Sayf al-Dawla sheltered the caliph, they also did not confront Tuzun's troops, and in May 944 they reached an agreement that gave Upper Mesopotamia and northern Syria to the Hamdanids in exchange for recognizing Tuzun's possession of Iraq. Nasir al-Dawla sent his cousin al-Husayn ibn Sa'id to take over the Syrian provinces allotted to <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> agreement. The Ikhshidid forces either defected or retreated, and al-Husayn swiftly took over the districts of Qinnasrin and Hims.|$|E
5|$|Two {{different}} {{accounts of}} Thomas's life are recounted in both Genesios and Theophanes Continuatus. According {{to the first}} account, Thomas first appeared in 803 accompanying general Bardanes Tourkos, and pursued a military career until launching his revolt in late 820. In the second version, he came to Constantinople as a poor youth and entered {{the service of a}} man with the high court rank of patrikios. Then, discovered trying to commit adultery with his master's wife, Thomas fled to the Arabs in Syria, where he remained for 25 years. Pretending to be the murdered emperor Constantine VI (r. 780–797), he then led an Arab-sponsored invasion of Asia Minor, but was defeated and punished. Classical and Byzantine scholar J.B. Bury tried to reconcile the two narratives, placing Thomas's flight to the Abbasid Caliphate at around 788 and then having him return to Byzantine service before 803, while the Russian scholar Alexander Vasiliev interpreted the sources as implying that Thomas fled to the Caliphate at Constantine VI's deposition in 797, and that his participation in Bardanes's revolt must be discounted entirely. The second version of Thomas's story is explicitly preferred by Genesios and Theophanes Continuatus, and is the only one recorded in 9th-century sources, namely the chronicle of George the Monk and the Life of Saints David, Symeon, and George of Lesbos. Nevertheless, the French Byzantinist Paul Lemerle came to consider it an unreliable later tradition created by his rival Michael II to discredit Thomas, and rejected it altogether, preferring to rely on the first account alone. Most modern scholars follow <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> interpretation.|$|E
