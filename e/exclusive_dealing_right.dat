The new league was backed up by a £305million <b>exclusive</b> TV <b>rights</b> <b>deal</b> with BSkyB. This {{paved the way for the}} Premier League's members to spend heavily on new players and also to convert their stadia into an all-seater format, which was necessary as a result of the Taylor Report's requirement that top division stadia should be all seater from the start of the 1994-95 season.|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} the incentives for oligopolistic manufacturers to adopt <b>exclusive</b> <b>dealing.</b> Manufacturers producing differentiated brands {{can choose to}} distribute through exclusive retail dealerships or nonexclusive dealerships. With nonexclusive dealing, manufacturers face an interbrand externality because brand-enhancing investments made by one manufacturer may benefit the brands of other manufacturers. Although <b>exclusive</b> <b>dealing</b> eliminates this externality, oligopolistic manufacturers may not choose <b>exclusive</b> <b>dealing.</b> <b>Exclusive</b> <b>dealing</b> enhances the incentive to invest, but the promotional investments are a form of competition between manufacturers. Thus, manufacturers might earn higher profits with nonexclusive dealing making lower promotional investments. We find cases in which nonexclusive dealing is a dominant strategy. We also find cases in which some, but not all, manufacturers adopt <b>exclusive</b> <b>dealing.</b> Moreover, even if adoption of <b>exclusive</b> <b>dealing</b> by all manufacturers is the equilibrium, it can arise from a prisoner's dilemma in that each manufacturer would prefer nonexclusive dealing. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{existing}} literature on <b>exclusive</b> <b>dealing</b> is extended {{to take into}} account that buyers signing <b>exclusive</b> <b>deals</b> are typically competing firms that are differentiated from the perspective of their customers. We show, provided such downstream firms are not too differentiated or provided upstream firms can compete in two-part tariffs, <b>exclusive</b> <b>dealing</b> forecloses entry to a more efficient rival. An established upstream firm and competing downstream firms raise their joint profit by signing <b>exclusive</b> <b>deals</b> to protect the industry from upstream competition. Naked exclusion arises despite the Chicago School logic that buyers only sign contracts that make themselves (jointly) better off. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{market share}} {{exclusion}} contract between a seller and a buyer prevents rival sellers from competing for {{a share of}} the buyer's purchases. For non-discriminatory contracting we show that, unlike exclusion through <b>exclusive</b> <b>dealing,</b> market share exclusion can be profitable even when buyers coordinate on the best equilibrium in the contract-acceptance subgame. The condition for the profitability of market share exclusion is characterized in terms of straightforward economic concepts. With discriminatory contracting market share exclusion contracts are generally less profitable than <b>exclusive</b> <b>dealing</b> contracts. The motive for employing market share exclusion contracts, which welfare impacts have not been well understood, instead of <b>exclusive</b> <b>dealing</b> contracts, which have been the focus of both theory and policy, may thus often be the avoidance of scrutiny by competition authorities rather than some more direct economic advantage of market share exclusion over <b>exclusive</b> <b>dealing.</b> However, we also show that market share exclusion decreases both buyer and total surplus. Hence, competition authorities should not view exclusion through <b>exclusive</b> <b>dealing</b> as a pre-requisite for the possibility of anti-competitive effects from exclusionary contracting. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Exclusive</b> <b>dealing</b> {{contracts}} between {{manufacturers and}} retailers force new entrants {{to set up}} their own costly dealer networks to enter the market. We ask whether such contracts may act as an entry barrier, and provide an empirical analysis of the European car market. We first estimate a demand model with product and spatial differentiation, and quantify the role of a dense distribution network in explaining the car manufacturers’ market shares. We then perform policy counterfactuals to assess the pro. t incentives and entry-deterring effects of <b>exclusive</b> <b>dealing.</b> We find that there are no individual incentives to maintain <b>exclusive</b> <b>dealing,</b> but there can be a collective incentive by the industry as a whole, even absent efficiencies. Furthermore, a ban on <b>exclusive</b> <b>dealing</b> would shift market shares from the larger European firms to the smaller entrants. More importantly, consumers would gain substantially, mainly because of the increased spatial availability and less so because of intensified price competition. Our findings suggest that the European Commission’s recent decision to facilitate <b>exclusive</b> <b>dealing</b> in the car market may not have been warranted. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. I {{reconcile}} {{a disagreement}} {{in the literature}} regarding the impact of downstream price competition on anticompetitive <b>exclusive</b> <b>dealing,</b> and then extend the <b>exclusive</b> <b>dealing</b> literature to accommodate adverse selection. Adverse selection expands the scope of inefficient exclusion, and may also explain policies of partial exclusion, in which an incumbent profits by locking up select retailers even though the entrant’s product is still competitively supplied in equilibrium. I relate my results to recent antitrust cases against Intel. Consider a market entrant facing two key challenges: gaining access to consumers and con-vincing them that it sells a good product. These challenges are particularly dire because the incumbent may curtail the entrant’s access to consumers by offering retailers exclusive contracts, and because the market is afflicted by adverse selection regarding the entrant. I investigate the prospects for this entrant {{and the health of}} the overall market. I show that the scope of anticompetitive <b>exclusive</b> <b>dealing</b> is strongly influenced by adverse selection, and that jointly considering adverse selection and <b>exclusive</b> <b>dealing</b> leads to new insights on how regulators ought to look at <b>exclusive</b> <b>dealing</b> cases. For example, I show that the incumben...|$|R
