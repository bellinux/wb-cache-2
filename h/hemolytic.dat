5|$|The {{species is}} now known to contain two main groups of toxins, both multicyclic (ring-shaped) peptides, spread {{throughout}} the mushroom tissue: the amatoxins and the phallotoxins. Another toxin is phallolysin, which has shown some <b>hemolytic</b> (red blood cell–destroying) activity in vitro. An unrelated compound, antamanide, has also been isolated.|$|E
5|$|About 5% of {{all people}} are {{diagnosed}} only when they develop fulminant acute liver failure, often {{in the context of}} a <b>hemolytic</b> anemia (anemia due to the destruction of red blood cells). This leads to abnormalities in protein production (identified by deranged coagulation) and metabolism by the liver. The deranged protein metabolism leads to the accumulation of waste products such as ammonia in the bloodstream. When these irritate the brain, the person develops hepatic encephalopathy (confusion, coma, seizures and finally life-threatening swelling of the brain).|$|E
5|$|Autoimmune {{disorders}} {{can often}} be traced to antibodies that bind the body's own epitopes; many can be detected through blood tests. Antibodies directed against red blood cell surface antigens in immune mediated <b>hemolytic</b> anemia are detected with the Coombs test. The Coombs test is also used for antibody screening in blood transfusion preparation and also for antibody screening in antenatal women.|$|E
5|$|Of {{concern to}} breeders is the {{condition}} known as uterine inertia, {{an inability to}} expel the foetus due to weak muscles. This condition was present {{in one of the}} foundation cats and appears in some Singapura females today. Individuals with uterine inertia may require deliveries to be made by Caesarean section. Another issue that affects the breed is Pyruvate kinase deficiency, which leads to <b>hemolytic</b> anemia. Typical symptoms includes lethargy, diarrhea, lack of appetite, poor coat quality, weight loss and jaundice.|$|E
5|$|Pennies {{and other}} small coins are {{sometimes}} ingested by dogs, requiring veterinary removal of the foreign objects. The zinc content of some coins can cause zinc toxicity, commonly fatal in dogs through severe <b>hemolytic</b> anemia and liver or kidney damage; vomiting and diarrhea are possible symptoms. Zinc is highly toxic in parrots and poisoning can often be fatal. The consumption of fruit juices stored in galvanized cans has resulted in mass parrot poisonings with zinc.|$|E
5|$|Reactive {{arthritis}} {{occurs in}} 1% of people following infections with Campylobacter species, and Guillain–Barré syndrome occurs in 0.1%. <b>Hemolytic</b> uremic syndrome (HUS) may occur due to infection with Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli or Shigella species, causing low platelet counts, poor kidney function, and low {{red blood cell}} count (due to their breakdown). Children are more predisposed to getting HUS than adults. Some viral infections may produce benign infantile seizures.|$|E
5|$|The {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of malaria typically begin 8–25 days following infection; however, symptoms may occur later in those who have taken antimalarial medications as prevention. Initial manifestations of the disease—common to all malaria species—are similar to flu-like symptoms, and can resemble other conditions such as sepsis, gastroenteritis, and viral diseases. The presentation may include headache, fever, shivering, joint pain, vomiting, <b>hemolytic</b> anemia, jaundice, hemoglobin in the urine, retinal damage, and convulsions.|$|E
5|$|American Cocker Spaniels are {{susceptible}} {{to a variety of}} illnesses, particularly infections affecting their ears and, in some cases, their eyes. Although the number or percent of afflicted dogs is not known, progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), glaucoma, and cataracts have been identified in some members of the breed. The American Spaniel Club recommends annual eye exams by a veterinary ophthalmologist for all dogs that are to be used for breeding. Autoimmune problems in Cockers have also been identified in an unknown number or percent of the breed, including autoimmune <b>hemolytic</b> anemia (AIHA). Ear inflammations are common in drop-eared breeds of dog, including the American Cocker, and luxating patellas and hip dysplasia have been identified in some members of the breed.|$|E
5|$|Burnet's work on graft-versus-host was in {{collaboration}} with Lone Simonsen between 1960 and 1962. Simonsen had shown in 1957 that when a chick embryo was inoculated intravenously with adult-fowl blood, a graft-versus-host reaction occurred; this {{was known as the}} Simonsen phenomenon. Their work in this system would later help to explain passenger leukocytes in transplantation. The last project he worked on at the Institute was a study with assistant Margaret Holmes of autoimmune disease in the New Zealand black mouse model; this mouse has a high incidence of spontaneous autoimmune <b>hemolytic</b> anemia. They looked at the inheritance of autoimmune disease, and their use of immunosuppressive drug cyclophosphamide to treat the disease influenced the use of immunosuppressive drugs in human autoimmune disease.|$|E
5|$|Gout {{frequently}} {{occurs in}} combination with other medical problems. Metabolic syndrome, a combination of abdominal obesity, hypertension, insulin resistance and abnormal lipid levels, occurs in nearly 75% of cases. Other conditions commonly complicated by gout include lead poisoning, kidney failure, <b>hemolytic</b> anemia, psoriasis, solid organ transplants and myeloproliferative disorders such as polycythemia. A body mass index {{greater than or equal to}} 35 increases male risk of gout threefold. Chronic lead exposure and lead-contaminated alcohol are risk factors for gout due to the harmful effect of lead on kidney function. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is often associated with gouty arthritis.|$|E
5|$|Most E. coli strains do {{not cause}} disease, but virulent strains can cause gastroenteritis, urinary tract infections, {{neonatal}} meningitis, hemorrhagic colitis, and Crohn's disease. Common {{signs and symptoms}} include severe abdominal cramps, diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, vomiting, and sometimes fever. In rarer cases, virulent strains are also responsible for bowel necrosis (tissue death) and perforation without progressing to hemolytic-uremic syndrome, peritonitis, mastitis, septicemia, and Gram-negative pneumonia. Very young children {{are more susceptible to}} develop severe illness, such as <b>hemolytic</b> uremic syndrome, however, healthy individuals of all ages are at risk to the severe consequences that may arise as a result of being infected with E. coli.|$|E
5|$|Peroxiredoxins are peroxidases that {{catalyze}} {{the reduction}} of hydrogen peroxide, organic hydroperoxides, as well as peroxynitrite. They are divided into three classes: typical 2-cysteine peroxiredoxins; atypical 2-cysteine peroxiredoxins; and 1-cysteine peroxiredoxins. These enzymes share the same basic catalytic mechanism, in which a redox-active cysteine (the peroxidatic cysteine) in the active site is oxidized to a sulfenic acid by the peroxide substrate. Over-oxidation of this cysteine residue in peroxiredoxins inactivates these enzymes, but this can be reversed {{by the action of}} sulfiredoxin. Peroxiredoxins seem to be important in antioxidant metabolism, as mice lacking peroxiredoxin 1 or 2 have shortened lifespan and suffer from <b>hemolytic</b> anaemia, while plants use peroxiredoxins to remove hydrogen peroxide generated in chloroplasts.|$|E
5|$|Rh factor, {{also known}} as Rh D antigen, is an antigen found on red blood cells; {{individuals}} that are Rh-positive (Rh+) have this antigen on their red blood cells and individuals that are Rh-negative (Rh–) do not. During normal childbirth, delivery trauma or complications during pregnancy, blood from a fetus can enter the mother's system. In {{the case of an}} Rh-incompatible mother and child, consequential blood mixing may sensitize an Rh- mother to the Rh antigen on the blood cells of the Rh+ child, putting the remainder of the pregnancy, and any subsequent pregnancies, at risk for <b>hemolytic</b> disease of the newborn.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{should not}} be taken by people who are {{allergic}} to ibuprofen or naproxen, or who have salicylate intolerance or a more generalized drug intolerance to NSAIDs, and caution should be exercised in those with asthma or NSAID-precipitated bronchospasm. Owing to its effect on the stomach lining, manufacturers recommend people with peptic ulcers, mild diabetes, or gastritis seek medical advice before using aspirin. Even if none of these conditions is present, the risk of stomach bleeding is still increased when aspirin is taken with alcohol or warfarin. People with hemophilia or other bleeding tendencies should not take aspirin or other salicylates. Aspirin is known to cause <b>hemolytic</b> anemia in people who have the genetic disease glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, particularly in large doses and depending on the severity of the disease. Use of aspirin during dengue fever is not recommended owing to increased bleeding tendency. People with kidney disease, hyperuricemia, or gout should not take aspirin because it inhibits the kidneys' ability to excrete uric acid, thus may exacerbate these conditions. Aspirin {{should not be}} given to children or adolescents to control cold or influenza symptoms, as this has been linked with Reye's syndrome.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hemolytic</b> anemia* {{is a type}} of {{regenerative}} anemia {{found in}} dogs characterized by destruction of the red blood cell. The most important type is immune-mediated <b>hemolytic</b> anemia, which can be a primary disease or secondary to cancer, infection, drugs, or vaccinations. Antibodies are present on the cell surface, leading to lysis and severe anemia. Other causes of <b>hemolytic</b> lesion include hypophosphatemia, exposure to toxins such as lead, infections such as ehrlichiosis or babesiosis, and rarely, neonatal isoerythrolysis. The behavioral condition pica, especially when involving the eating of concrete dust, tile grout, or sand, may be a sign of <b>hemolytic</b> anemia, indicating the need for a complete blood count to investigate a possible diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|Many former group D streptococci {{have been}} {{reclassified}} {{and placed in}} the genus Enterococcus (including E. faecalis, E. faecium, E. durans, and E. avium). For example, Streptococcus faecalis is now Enterococcus faecalis. E. faecalis is sometimes alpha <b>hemolytic</b> and E. faecium is sometimes beta <b>hemolytic.</b>|$|E
25|$|Autoimmune <b>hemolytic</b> anemia, {{which is}} an {{autoimmune}} blood disorder.|$|E
25|$|It is {{sometimes}} prescribed for extreme cases of immune-mediated <b>hemolytic</b> anemia.|$|E
25|$|Sufferers of favism {{must avoid}} broad beans, since these trigger a <b>hemolytic</b> crisis.|$|E
25|$|It causes <b>hemolytic</b> anemia in {{carriers}} of the G6PD (favism) enzymatic deficiency.|$|E
25|$|ABO {{blood group}} {{incompatibilities}} between {{the mother and}} child does not usually cause <b>hemolytic</b> disease of the newborn (HDN) because antibodies to the ABO blood groups are usually of the IgM type, which do not cross the placenta. However, in an O-type mother, IgG ABO antibodies are produced and the baby can potentially develop ABO <b>hemolytic</b> disease of the newborn.|$|E
25|$|USS {{can present}} {{similar to the}} {{following}} diseases which have to be excluded: fulminant infections, disseminated intravascular coagulation, autoimmune <b>hemolytic</b> anemia, Evans syndrome, the typical and atypical form of <b>hemolytic</b> uremic syndrome (HUS), HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets) syndrome, pre-eclampsia, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), cancer that is often accompanied with metastasis, kidney injury, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome and side effects from hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.|$|E
25|$|In {{thrombotic}} thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and <b>hemolytic</b> uremic syndrome (HUS), ADAMTS13 either is deficient or {{has been}} inhibited by antibodies directed at the enzyme. This leads to decreased breakdown of the ultra-large multimers of vWF and microangiopathic <b>hemolytic</b> anemia with deposition of fibrin and platelets in small vessels, and capillary necrosis. In TTP, the organ most obviously affected is the brain; in HUS, the kidney.|$|E
25|$|Atypical <b>hemolytic</b> uremic {{syndrome}} (aHUS) {{has also}} {{been referred to as}} diarrhea-negative hemolytic-uremic syndrome (D− HUS).|$|E
25|$|The direct Coombs test is used {{to confirm}} that the fetus or neonate has an immune {{mediated}} <b>hemolytic</b> anemia.|$|E
25|$|In 1956 Alving {{and colleagues}} {{showed that in}} some African Americans the {{antimalarial}} drug primaquine induces <b>hemolytic</b> anemia, and that those individuals have an inherited deficiency of G6PD in erythrocytes. G6PD deficiency is sex-linked, and common in Mediterranean, African and other populations. In Mediterranean countries such individuals can develop a <b>hemolytic</b> diathesis (favism) after consuming fava beans. G6PD deficient persons are also sensitive to several drugs in addition to primaquine.|$|E
25|$|Hemoglobin C (α2βC2) – Another variant {{due to a}} {{variation}} in the β-chain gene. This variant causes a mild chronic <b>hemolytic</b> anemia.|$|E
25|$|Hemolysis is {{the general}} term for {{excessive}} breakdown of red blood cells. It can have several causes and can result in <b>hemolytic</b> anemia.|$|E
25|$|Mechanical {{heart valves}} {{can also cause}} {{mechanical}} <b>hemolytic</b> anemia with hemolysis of the red blood cells as they pass through the valve.|$|E
25|$|Hemoglobin C/thalassemia: {{common in}} Mediterranean and African populations, {{hemoglobin}} C/βo thalassemia causes a moderately severe <b>hemolytic</b> anemia with splenomegaly; hemoglobin C/β+ thalassemia produces a milder disease.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hemolytic</b> anemia can be {{developed}} after several courses of cisplatin. It is suggested that an antibody reacting with a cisplatin-red-cell membrane is responsible for hemolysis.|$|E
25|$|The {{indirect}} Coombs test is used {{to screen}} blood from antenatal women for IgG antibodies that may pass through the placenta and cause <b>hemolytic</b> disease of the newborn.|$|E
25|$|E. coli O157:H7 is a potent, highly infectious, ACDP (Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens, UK) Hazard Group 3 {{foodborne}} and waterborne pathogen. The bacterium produces potent toxins {{that cause}} diarrhea, severe aches and nausea in infected persons. Symptoms of severe infections include <b>hemolytic</b> colitis (bloody diarrhea), <b>hemolytic</b> uremic syndrome (kidney disease), and death. E. coli O157:H7 {{has become a}} serious public health threat because of its increased incidence and because children up to 14 years of age, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals {{are at risk of}} incurring the most severe symptoms.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to chronic and/or recurrent infections many autoimmune diseases including arthritis, autoimmune <b>hemolytic</b> anemia, scleroderma and {{type 1 diabetes}} mellitus are also seen in X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA).|$|E
25|$|The modern {{understanding}} of the condition began with the analysis of patients who exhibited sensitivity to primaquine. The discovery of G6PD deficiency relied heavily upon the testing of prisoner volunteers at Illinois State Penitentiary, a type of study which today is considered unethical and cannot be performed. When some prisoners were given the drug primaquine, some developed <b>hemolytic</b> anemia but others did not. After studying the mechanism through Cr51 testing, it was conclusively shown that the <b>hemolytic</b> effect of primaquine was due to an intrinsic defect of erythrocytes.|$|E
25|$|Full {{blood count}} and {{examination}} of blood film: The blood film morphology can provide clues about <b>hemolytic</b> anemia, clumping of the platelets leading to spurious thrombocytopenia, or leukemia.|$|E
