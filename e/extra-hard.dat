Corrosive wear of metal elements of prosthesis may result in excluding it from further use by the occurrence of allergic or even carcinogenic reactions in patient, resulting from the release of toxic metal ions into the body. A common practice in prosthetic laboratories used in order to reduce production costs of dental prostheses is using so-called post-production scrap to subsequent castings. This scrap constitute the elements of casting channels, defectively made skeletons of prostheses or metal residues after prosthetic treatment. Use of post-production scrap to manufacture components to fulfill such high performance criteria (presence of complex biomechanical loads), and in particular taking into account the evaluation of biocompatibility, is the subject of discussion not only in the environment of scientists, but also the producers of dental alloys.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to characterize a novel dairy product, cheese produced from donkeys’ and caprine milk mixture (60 : 40 % v/v), regarding its chemical, microbiological, textural and sensory properties. Fully ripened cheese was classified as a high-fat, <b>extra-hard</b> cheese, with high sodium (29. 97  g. kg− 1), magnesium (3. 07  g. kg− 1) and potassium (4. 70  g. kg− 1) content.

Palmitic (C 16 : 0) and oleic fatty acids (C 18 : 2 n 9 -cis) with 25. 11 and 24. 70 %, respectively, were found at the highest concentrations.

40|$|In-situ SEM {{shearing}} {{tests were}} performed on samples from the heavily cold rolled (<b>Extra-hard)</b> aluminium alloys, where the parallelepiped test sample was cut as to let shear direction (SD) have an angle alpha with the rolling direction (RD). This shear angle ranges from 0 degrees to 165 degrees with an interval of 15 degrees. These include three heavily cold rolled non heat-treatable aluminium alloys AA 1200, AA 3004 and AA 5182. During these tests, strain localization (macro-shearbands) was observed. This phenomenon {{is found to be}} anisotropic and depends on the angle alpha. The strain localization or macro-shearbands are believed to be related with strain softening, where the flow stress decreases with strain. According to the crystal plastic theory, the strain softening is considered as resulting from the joint effects of texture and evolution of microstructure, in particular the dislocation patterns. Focusing on texture softening, simple and advanced Taylor type micro-mechanical simulations (Full-constraint Taylor (FC Taylor) and Advanced Lamel models (Alamel)) are performed to calculate the texture and average Taylor factor evolution with the increment of shear strain, {{on the basis of the}} measured rolling textures. After the simulations, the shear strain at which texture softening happens is recorded for each alloy and each shear angle, For alloys AA 3004 and AA 5182, it is found the texture-softening trend is similar to the experimental observations, which showed that the strain localization starts at smaller strains at shear angles of around 30 - 60 degrees and 120 - 150 degrees, finally leading to early failure. On the contrary, for alloy AA 1200, the calculated average Taylor factor evolution does not resemble the flow behaviour. Furthermore the conclusions for alloys AA 3004 and AA 5182 are only qualitative, as the value of texture-softening strains predicted by simulation seems different from the observations. This shows that the importance of other effects such as possible microstructural softening mechanisms, especially the one due to the change of strain path (rolling/shear). Then for future models, it will be necessary to incorporate both the texture effects and microstructural effects comprehensively in order to precisely predict the strain localization behaviour of materials. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{submitted}} {{study is}} {{about the development of}} a test system, to analyse the quantitative flowing out behaviour of cobalt chrome alloys and using results for comparison to different alloys. Subsequently, the developed system should be used on some casting machines to test its applicability. The partial denture alloy Wironit® (BEGO) <b>extra-hard</b> on cobalt-chrome-basis was used for all castings. First it had to be defined certain characteristics, on which the test system should be measured and evaluated. Five main criteria crystallized: flowing out behaviour, re-producibility, easy to evaluate, applicability and productivity. In {{order to be able to}} evaluate these also individually, a factor were attached to them. The realization of the system should work in a way that variation of one and simultaneous constancy of all other criteria leads to an interpretable and representative result. By variations in geometry, causing technology, size and position of a wax grid retentions eighteen different, possible specimens were sketched in preliminary tests. Each version was made three times, in order to embed and pour these three-series at the same time. All the poured results had to be evaluated and measured on the basis of the certain characteristics represented above, to find the most suitable specimen for a testing system. Additionally two three-series of the already established MBS sys-tem were poured. After evaluation of the results the specimen was selected, which corresponded to the criteria best. After finishing this first part, time was right to test the specimen intensively at the main attempts. For a test-series with ten different casting machines eight specimens were accomplished for each of the engines. The selected devices differed both in melting -, and in casting procedure. It was melted with a propane/oxygen mixture, an induction sys-tem and with the light-arc procedure. As casting variations centrifugal and vacuum pressure casting devices were present. All remaining components were kept con-stant. For each machine an average value for quantitative flowing out with pertinent stan-dard deviation and variation turned out. It showed up that some variation-values were relative high, so further test rows of the appropriate devices maybe needed. Never-theless the received results show in a tendentious way, which machines obtained better results under the demanded conditions. The average value of the Fundor T (BEGO) was clearly higher compared to the others. A higher casting temperature by flame melts probably seems. The Induktherm of the company Linn places therefore with 80, 70 %, despite a variation 122. 48 the most successful fusion of melting and casting combination. The remaining test rows were appropriate 40 % and 75 % with their average value between. Remarkable are the low values of the Nautilus MC plus with 33, 7 %. However here the variation highest with 240, 32 is present and it is as-sumes that the unfavourable average value will shift clearly by further test rows. The accomplished test series using the developed test-system pointed out that the received results are usable. It is to be marked that the increase of the specimens per test-series should increase the results presentation. However there are still some potential sources of error, which needs to be analyzed and decreased or eliminated if possible. Nevertheless the test of ten devices also showed that this developed test-system is simple to evaluate, fast and uncomplicatedly. The results are not suitable for comparing the casting machines among themselves, due to the fusing temperature which can not be controlled for most devices. As pure quantitative test system it is usable. Additional qualitative tests are recommended...|$|E
