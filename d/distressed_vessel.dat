25|$|On August 2011, the Miguel Malvar {{conducted}} {{rescue operations}} on a <b>distressed</b> <b>vessel</b> {{in the province}} of Tawi-Tawi. She rescued around 60 passengers from the wooden-hulled vessel M/L Virginia and towed the said ship to a pier in Bongao, Tawi-Tawi.|$|E
25|$|In 1990 she was {{transferred}} to Fort Lauderdale, Florida. During the morning hours of 17 April 1992 Point Glass assisted the disabled MV G.H. Vanderburgh which was floundering in breaking surf and in danger of grounding on a coral reef six miles southwest of Fowey Rocks Light near Miami, Florida. Point Glass successfully navigated 34 miles through 810 foot seas to the <b>distressed</b> <b>vessel</b> and determined that she had crossed over the outer reef line {{and was about to}} damage the environmentally sensitive coral reef at Biscayne National Park. After passing a line to G.H. Vanderburgh, she towed her to safety, thereby saving the coral reef from damage and preventing harm to the seven man crew of the vessel. For these actions, the Point Glass and her crew were awarded the Coast Guard Meritorious Unit Commendation with Operational Distinguishing Device. In 1998, Point Glass and her crew were awarded the Coast Guard Meritorious Team Commendation with the Operational Distinguishing Device for participating in the Shell Air/Sea show at Fort Lauderdale by being part of the task force enforcing a 3 square mile safety zone near the event and showing the audience a search and rescue demonstration as well as a high speed patrol boat pass.|$|E
500|$|On {{its last}} voyage the Cobb was {{scheduled}} to transport a cargo of timber and cross ties from Brunswick, Georgia to New York. On Tuesday, 1 December 1896, after leaving port from Brunswick, the schooner fell victim to the strong winds and high seas associated with Nor'easters. Gale force winds ripped the vessel's sails from their masts and rough seas capsized the ship to its beam ends. The crew was able to right the <b>distressed</b> <b>vessel</b> by removing the main and mizzen masts, but this left the Cobb vulnerable since it was powerless and waterlogged. Despite the cabin being swept away by the sea, the ship's hull was kept relatively intact during this sequence of events. [...] Unfortunately, both a cook and a shipmate drowned in the violent seas. On the morning of 5 December 1896 the Nathan F. Cobb ran aground on a near shore sandbar roughly 1000 feet {{off the coast of}} Ormond Beach, Florida.|$|E

2500|$|A related {{doctrine}} is [...] "common mistake", which since {{the decision of}} Lord Phillips MR in The Great Peace {{is essentially the same}} in operation as frustration, except that the event making a contract impossible to perform takes place before, not after, a contract is concluded. A [...] "common mistake" [...] differs from the [...] "mistakes" [...] that take place between offers and acceptance (that mean there is no agreement in the first place), or the so-called [...] "mistake about identity" [...] cases that follow from a fraudulent misrepresentation (which typically makes a contract voidable, not void, unless in a written document and concluded at a distance), because it is based on performance becoming seriously difficult to perform. For instance, in Courturier v Hastie a corn shipment had decayed by the time two businesspeople had contracted for it, and so it was held (perhaps controversially) that the seller was not liable, because it was always physically impossible. And in Cooper v Phibbs the House of Lords held that an agreement to lease out a fishery was void because it turned out the lessee was in fact the owner. It is legally impossible to be leased something one owns. Again, the doctrine of common mistake may be contracted around, so in McRae v Commonwealth Disposals Commission it was held that despite the fact that a wrecked ship off the Great Barrier Reef never in fact existed, because a salvage business was actually promised by the Australian government that it was there, there was no common mistake. Like frustration, the doctrine operates only in narrow confines. In Bell v Lever Bros Ltd Lord Atkin stated that a mistake must be of such a 'fundamental character as to constitute an underlying assumption without which the parties would not have entered into the agreements'. Post-war, Denning LJ added to the doctrine, beyond its narrow legal confines, in line with the more permissive approach recognised throughout civil law countries, most of the Commonwealth and the United States. In Solle v Butcher he held that in equity a contract could be deemed voidable (rather than outright void) if it would be 'unconscientious' for a court to hold someone to a bargain. This gave the courts some flexibility in the kind of remedy they would grant, and could be more generous in the circumstances they allowed escape. But in The Great Peace, Lord Phillips MR said that this more permissive doctrine had been contrary to the House of Lords authority in Bell v Lever Bros Ltd. Although it probably would not have been avoidable under the mistake in equity doctrine anyway, Lord Phillips MR held that a rescue company could not escape from an agreement to save a ship because both parties were mistaken that the <b>distressed</b> <b>vessel</b> was further than they originally thought. The result is that English contract law jealously prevents escape from an agreement, unless there is a serious breach because of the conduct of one party, which gives rise to the right to terminate.|$|E
60|$|We {{stood out}} to sea. On the 20th we bade {{farewell}} to the south, and with a fair wind turned the ship's head northward. From Cape Tres Montes we sailed pleasantly along the lofty weather-beaten coast, which is remarkable for the bold outline of its hills, and the thick covering of forest even on the almost precipitous flanks. The next day a harbour was discovered, which on this dangerous coast might be of great service to a <b>distressed</b> <b>vessel.</b> It can easily be recognised by a hill 1600 feet high, which is even more perfectly conical than the famous sugar-loaf at Rio de Janeiro. The next day, after anchoring, I succeeded in reaching the summit of this hill. It was a laborious undertaking, for the sides were so steep that in some parts {{it was necessary to}} use the trees as ladders. There were also several extensive brakes of the Fuchsia, covered with its beautiful drooping flowers, but very difficult to crawl through. In these wild countries it gives much delight to gain the summit of any mountain. There is an indefinite expectation of seeing something very strange, which, however often it may be balked, never failed with me to recur on each successive attempt. Every one must know the feeling of triumph and pride which a grand view from a height communicates to the mind. In these little frequented countries there is also joined to it some vanity, that you perhaps are the first man who ever stood on this pinnacle or admired this view.|$|E
60|$|At a given {{signal the}} {{fastenings}} of the canopy were loosened, and the loaded structure came down suddenly {{with a heavy}} crash, carrying away with it {{other parts of the}} vessel. One man was crushed {{under the weight of the}} falling ruins, and instantly killed. Agrippina and the lady in waiting upon her were saved by the posts of the bed or couch on which Agrippina was reclining, which happened to be in such a position that they held up the impending mass sufficiently to allow the ladies to creep out from beneath it. The breaking down, too, of the deck and bulwarks of the barge was less extensive than had been intended, so that Agrippina not only escaped being crushed by the ruins but she also saved herself at first from being thrown into the sea. The men then who were in the secret of the plot immediately raised a great cry and confusion, and attempted to upset the barge by climbing up upon one side of it--while the others, who did not understand the case, did all they could to save it. In the mean time the noise of the outcries reached the shore, and fishermen's boats began to put off with a view of coming to the rescue of the <b>distressed</b> <b>vessel.</b> Before they arrived, however, the boat had been overturned, Agrippina and Aceronia had been thrown into the sea, and the men who were in the secret of the plot, taking advantage of the darkness and confusion, were endeavoring to seal the fate of their victims, by beating them down with poles and oars as they struggled in the water.|$|E
50|$|Early in 1973, {{budget cuts}} forced {{the closing of}} seven Coast Guard {{stations}} on the Great Lakes. At {{the request of the}} affected communities, Congress ordered the stations to be re-opened and operated by the Auxiliary. The local division captains took responsibility for manning them and ensuring that Auxiliarists' boats were always available to assist <b>distressed</b> <b>vessels.</b> The Auxiliary later took over seven more stations on the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers.|$|R
50|$|Portland Gale was {{an intense}} storm causing many {{vessels in the}} area at anchor, and transiting {{in and out of}} Boston to be in distress. Point Allerton responded to many of these <b>distressed</b> <b>vessels</b> and thus saved many lives under the lead of Joshua James (1826-1902), Hull's most famous lifesaver, who became the first Keeper of the Pt. Allerton U.S. Life Saving Station, when it opened in 1889.|$|R
50|$|The GMDSS {{installation}} {{on ships}} include one (two on vessels over 500 GT) Search and Rescue Locating device(s) called Search and Rescue Radar Transponders (SART) {{which are used}} to locate survival craft or <b>distressed</b> <b>vessels</b> by creating a series of twelve dots on a rescuing ship's 3 cm radar display. The detection range between these devices and ships, dependent upon {{the height of the}} ship's radar mast and the height of the Search and Rescue Locating device, is normally about 15 km (8 nautical miles).Once detected by radar, the Search and Rescue Locating device will produce a visual and aural indication to the persons in distress.|$|R
6000|$|The {{effect of}} {{the sounds of the}} explosions on the Straits Settlements {{generally}} was not only striking but to some extent amusing. At Carimon, in Java--355 miles distant from Krakatoa--it was supposed that a vessel in distress was firing guns, and several native boats were sent off to render assistance, but no <b>distressed</b> <b>vessel</b> was to be found! At Acheen, in Sumatra--1073 miles distant--they supposed that a fort was being attacked and the troops were turned out under arms. At Singapore--522 miles off--they fancied that the detonations came from a vessel in distress and two steamers were despatched to search for it. And here the effect on the telephone, extending to Ishore, was remarkable. On raising the tubes a perfect roar as of a waterfall was heard. By shouting {{at the top of his}} voice, the clerk at one end could make the clerk at the other end hear, but he could not render a word intelligible. At Perak--770 miles off--the sounds were thought to be distant salvos of artillery, and Commander the Honourable F Vereker, R.N., of H.M.S. Magpie, when 1227 miles distant, (in latitude 5 degrees 52 minutes North, longitude 118 degrees 22 minutes East), states that the detonations of Krakatoa were distinctly heard by those on board his ship, and by the inhabitants of the coast as far as Banguey Island, on August 27th. He adds that they resembled distant heavy cannonading. In a letter from Saint Lucia Bay--1116 miles distant--it was stated that the eruption was plainly heard all over Borneo. A government steamer was sent out from the Island of Timor--1351 miles off--to ascertain the cause of the disturbance! In South Australia also, at places 2250 miles away, explosions were heard on the 26th and 27th which [...] "awakened" [...] people, and were thought worthy of being recorded and reported. From Tavoy, in Burmah--1478 miles away--the report came--"All day on August 27th unusual sounds were heard, resembling the boom of guns. Thinking there might be a wreck or a ship in distress, the Tavoy Superintendent sent out the police launch, but they `could see nothing.'" [...] And so on, far and near, similar records were made, the most distant spot where the sounds were reported to have been heard being Rodriguez, in the Pacific, nearly 3000 miles distant! ...|$|E

25|$|<b>Distressed</b> <b>vessels</b> {{that request}} {{the service of}} towing vessels have means to make towing as safe as possible.

Bulk carriers and general cargo vessels {{are not required to}} have a specialized emergency towing arrangement. Depending on the vessel's type and keel laid date, in accordance with the MSC256(84) standard they must have on board an emergency towing procedure manual. This ship-specific manual describes procedures that will allow the vessel to be towed using its own equipment. The procedure should make use of the standard mooring equipment like mooring ropes, bits, rollers and Panama chock.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes {{upon seeing}} the burning ship, mariners have {{attempted}} to rescue the crew aboard. One of the more famous rescue attempts took place in Charlottetown Harbour about 1900.

2500|$|During her nine-year career, {{she came}} to the rescue of <b>distressed</b> <b>vessels</b> and she had several mishaps of her own, {{including}} stranding on a reef in 1882, running ashore in 1888 near Cheboygan, Michigan, and striking a bar and sinking at the dock in Duluth, Minnesota in 1889. In 1883, Drake rescued the crew of her consort, the 347-ton schooner Dot (the former Mary Merrit), when Dot began leaking and sank off Grand Marais, Michigan. [...] In 1889, Drake picked up 3 passengers and the 15-man crew from the wooden steam barge Smith Moore that had been sideswiped by James Pickands in heavy fog. [...] Drake towed Moore for 6 hours when Moore finally sank only 300 feet from the bar {{at the mouth of the}} Munising, Michigan harbor. In 1900, Drake rescued the 8-man crew from the leaking schooner-barge R. Hallaran that foundered off Keweenaw Point near Stannard Rock Light. [...] Drake saved at least 4 crews from foundering vessels during her career but her final rescue of her own consort's crew caused a fatal blow to her structure that resulted in her suffering the same fate.|$|R

This incident prompted the EU to pass the first two measures addressing maritime safety. The third package was spurred in part by the 2002 sinking of the oil tanker Prestige off the coasts of Spain and France. That accident, the largest environmental disaster in Spain's history, was caused in part because Spanish authorities denied the <b>distressed</b> <b>vessel</b> entry to a safe harbour.
