5|$|Freda's {{ambition}} {{to make a}} horror film derived from his desire to make films in the fantastique style, feeling that only the Americans and German expressionists {{were able to make}} such films in the past. Freda approached film producer Luigi Carpentieri with the idea of the film despite not having a treatment ready. Promising them that he would <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>for</b> them by the next day, he returned with a tape of his treatment that was complete with sound effects. Carpentieri phoned Goffredo Lombardo to convince him further. Freda followed up his tape with the promise that his script could pass the censors and could be filmed in 12 days. This convinced the producer who allowed Freda to create what became I Vampiri. I Vampiri was a low-budget production with Donati and Capentieri of Athena and Lombardo's Titanus investing 32 million lire each initially into the film. The initial budget was 97 million Italian lire which increased to 142 million for its post-production and release after the films format was switched to panoramic CinemaScope.|$|E
500|$|Hearings on the president's proposal, {{introduced}} as H.R. 8926, began before the House Banking and Currency Committee on June 4. Chairman Wright Patman, the bill's sponsor, deemed it to <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>for</b> everyone, including price supports for silver, though industrial users would benefit most, as the silver formerly used in coinage would be freed up for commercial use. Most business stakeholders, including the banks, the vending machine operators, and corporate leaders, {{wanted to see}} the bill pass, it being better than the current situation. [...] On June 11, the committee issued a report recommending the bill pass, with amendments requiring the half dollar to be made of base metal, requiring the silver coins that would be struck during the transition period to be dated 1964, and banning the striking of silver dollars for five years.|$|E
500|$|After the {{original}} version of [...] "Triumphant (Get 'Em)" [...] was released, Carey's official website premiered two other versions of the song, the [...] "Vintage Throwback Remix" [...] and the [...] "Pulse Club Remix". While the song's initial release was tepidly received by critics, reviewers were more favorable towards the remixes. The remixes only feature Carey and eliminate the extensive rap verses with which many critics took issue. According to Carey's manager, Randy Jackson, three versions of the song were released in order to monopolize all radio formats and cater to multiple audiences. In an interview with Billboard, Jackson expressed how they would remind Carey's fans of her earlier remixes, which she would always re-do her vocals: [...] "The vintage throwback mix will remind fans of remixes she did years ago, and she's {{had a lot of}} Billboard No. 1 dance hits as well. She went in and re-sang the vocals, knowing that the two verses on this first version of this single with Meek and Ross were going to be hip-hop verses where people were rapping. We wanted to <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>for</b> all of her fans." ...|$|E

When Disney Infinity was yet to be released, Avalanche Software CEO, John Blackburn stated that discussions about the inclusion of Star Wars and Marvel characters in the game, took place. On that subject Blackburn said [...] "I hope so! As a developer, I so want that. When Disney bought Lucasfilm, I was like, 'Holy crap! This is awesome!'

[...] In February 2014, Avalanche Software began hiring game testers for a potential Disney Infinity sequel.|$|E
2500|$|The authorship of the Commodore 64 titles was at {{the time}} even more uncertain. The {{conversions}} of existing Spectrum games Sabre Wulf, Underwurlde and Nightshade were handled by Firebird, who hired Mr Micro, Softstone, and PSI, respectively, to develop the titles. Imhotep was submitted to Ultimate in a virtually complete form by author Manuel Caballero, who had previously written Batty Builders and Firefleet. Ultimate did not make any announcements regarding the authorship of the other Commodore games, but an article by Martyn Carroll revealed how Frank Gasking of [...] "Games that weren't 64" [...] managed to identify the creators as Dave and Robert (Bob) Thomas based on a message that appears on the final screen of Dragonskulle. These two brothers were also the creators of the previous three games of the series The Staff of Karnath, Entombed and Blackwyche, In an interview with the brothers in Retro Gamer magazine, they revealed they also authored Outlaws, in just six weeks, so Ultimate would <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>for</b> the Commodore 64 for Christmas.|$|E
