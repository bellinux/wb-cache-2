5000|$|Murphy {{was born}} in Tuam, County Galway, the {{youngest}} of 10 children. His elder siblings gradually emigrated to Birmingham until he was left alone with his mother. He attended the local Archbishop McHale College, and later became a metalwork teacher. He began writing in the late 1950s, saying, [...] "In 1958, my best friend said to me, why don't we write a play? I didn't {{think it was an}} unusual question, because in 1958 everyone in Ireland was writing a play". His second play, A Whistle in the Dark, was written in his Tuam kitchen on Murphy's <b>free</b> <b>Friday</b> and Saturday nights. It was entered into a competition for amateur plays, which it won, and was eventually produced in London in 1961, having been rejected by the Abbey Theatre. While Murphy was religious as a boy, education by the Christian Brothers left him largely irreligious. His 1975 play The Sanctuary Lamp was produced in the Abbey Theatre and received a hostile reception due to its anti-Catholic nature, with theatre goers walking out and much negative criticism in the media. After this controversy Murphy worked as a farmer for some years. He now lives in south Dublin.|$|E
