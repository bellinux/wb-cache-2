5|$|Zinc in rivers {{flowing through}} {{industrial}} and mining areas {{can be as}} high as 20ppm. Effective sewage treatment greatly reduces this; treatment along the Rhine, for example, has decreased zinc levels to 50ppb. Concentrations of zinc as low as 2ppm adversely affects the amount of oxygen that fish can carry <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>blood.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Virginia, some Carolina wrens populations show {{high levels}} of mercury <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>blood</b> and this is {{acquired}} from feeding all-year-round on spiders. Spiders being at a higher trophic levels contain a higher concentrations of mercury (through biomagnification) than herbivorous invertebrates. As these wrens are year-round residents, they are at a higher risk than other species to acquire mercury in its blood. Nest abandonment and failure to raise young were more common with higher mercury content. Exposure, and prolonged periods of cold, ice, and snow is thought to affect the wren nestling and adult populations, respectively. Wrens that outlast those winters reside in sheltered areas during the season.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other animals}} {{at the highest}} trophic levels, the killer whale is {{particularly}} at risk of poisoning from bioaccumulation of toxins, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). European harbor seals have problems in reproductive and immune functions associated {{with high levels of}} PCBs and related contaminants, and a survey off the Washington coast found PCB levels in killer whales were higher than levels that had caused health problems in harbor seals. Blubber samples in the Norwegian Arctic show higher levels of PCBs, pesticides and brominated flame-retardants than in polar bears. When food is scarce, killer whales metabolize blubber for energy, which increases pollutant concentrations <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>blood.</b>|$|E

5|$|Since American kestrels are carnivores, toxic {{chemical}} runoff ingested by their prey can concentrate {{at high levels}} <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>blood.</b> Wild kestrels are subject to immunomodulation, or an altered immune response, to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), a group of industrial flame retardants that may leach from factories into the environment. When PBDEs accumulate in body tissues of kestrels, the T-cell mediated immune response decreases in efficiency. As a result, kestrels that ingest PBDEs may not respond sufficiently to viruses or other invading microorganisms. In addition, certain PBDEs may suppress growth {{and development of the}} spleen and bursa in American kestrels.|$|E
5|$|Polymorphous light {{eruption}} (PMLE) is {{the easiest}} disease to mistake for solar urticaria because {{the locations of the}} lesions are similar (the V of the neck and the arms). However, patients with SU are more likely to develop lesions on the face. Also, a reaction with PMLE will take a greater amount of time to appear than with solar urticaria. Lupus erythematosus has been mistaken for SU; however, lesions from lupus erythematosus will take a longer amount of time to go away. Furthermore, when being tested for the two diseases, patients with SU have a reaction immediately while patients with lupus erythematosus will have a delayed reaction. Patients who have experienced solar urticarial symptoms from a young age could mistakenly be thought to have erythropoietic protoporphyria. However, the main symptom for this disease is pain and patients with have been found to have abnormal levels of protoporphyrin <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>blood</b> while these levels are normal in SU patients. Finally, cholinergic urticaria, or urticaria induced by heat, can occasionally appear to be solar urticaria because the heat from the sun will cause a person with the disease to have a reaction.|$|E
5|$|The main {{adaptations of}} the {{pinniped}} circulatory system for diving are the enlargement and increased complexity of veins {{to increase their}} capacity. Retia mirabilia form blocks of tissue on the inner wall of the thoracic cavity and the body periphery. These tissue masses, which contain extensive contorted spirals of arteries and thin-walled veins, act as blood reservoirs that increase oxygen stores for use during diving. As with other diving mammals, pinnipeds have high amounts of hemoglobin and myoglobin stored <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>blood</b> and muscles. This allows them to stay submerged {{for long periods of}} time while still having enough oxygen. Deep-diving species such as elephant seals have blood volumes that make up to 20% of their body weight. When diving, they reduce their heart rate and maintain blood flow only to the heart, brain and lungs. To keep their blood pressure stable, phocids have an elastic aorta that dissipates some energy of each heartbeat.|$|E

5|$|Some {{animals are}} {{coloured}} purely incidentally because <b>their</b> <b>blood</b> contains pigments.

40|$|Patients with {{rheumatoid}} arthritis have decreased numbers of T mu lymphocytes <b>in</b> <b>their</b> peripheral <b>blood.</b> To {{find out whether}} these low number of T mu lymphocytes {{were associated with the}} presence of anti-lymphocyte antibodies, the sera of 27 patients with definite or classical {{rheumatoid arthritis}} (RA) were investigated for the presence of autoantibodies against subsets of lymphocytes. In addition the numbers of T, T mu, T gamma and B lymphocytes in the peripheral blood of these patients were investigated. Patients with active RA showed lower numbers of T mu lymphocytes <b>in</b> <b>their</b> peripheral <b>blood</b> than patients with inactive RA. However, both groups of RA patients had significantly decreased numbers of T mu lymphocytes <b>in</b> <b>their</b> peripheral <b>blood</b> as compared with 22 age matched healthy donors. Moreover, mainly in patients with active RA cold reactive antibodies were found directed against T mu and B lymphocytes, but never against T gamma lymphocytes of healthy donors. Similar results were found in the indirect immunofluorescence procedure when tested for reactivity against T-cell subsets. This serum reactivity was not caused by rheumatoid factors or antinuclear antibodies. Since RA sera after precipitation with 2. 5 % polyethyleneglycol, still showed cytotoxicity against T and B lymphocytes, it is suggested that this serum reactivity is not caused by immune complexes but by antibodies...|$|R

25|$|The {{fortification}} {{program was}} estimated to raise a person’s folic acid intake level by 70–130µg/day; however, an increase of almost double that amount was actually observed.
