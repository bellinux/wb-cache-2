40|$|Abstract—The three-time-scale plant {{model of}} a wind power generator, {{including}} a wind turbine, a flexible vertical shaft, a Variable <b>Inertia</b> <b>Flywheel</b> (VIF) module, an Active Magnetic Bearing (AMB) unit and the applied wind sequence, is constructed. In {{order to make the}} wind power generator be still able to operate as the spindle speed exceeds its rated speed, the VIF is equipped so that the spindle speed can be appropriately slowed down once any stronger wind field is exerted. To prevent any potential damage due to collision by shaft against conventional bearings, the AMB unit is proposed to regulate the shaft position deviation. By singular perturbation order-reduction technique, a lower-order plant model can be established for the synthesis of feedback controller. Two major system parameter uncertainties, an additive uncertainty and a multiplicative uncertainty, are constituted by the wind turbine and the VIF respectively. Frequency Shaping Sliding Mode Control (FSSMC) loop is proposed to account for these uncertainties and suppress the unmodeled higher-order plant dynamics. At last, the efficacy of the FSSMC is verified by intensive computer and experimental simulations for regulation on position deviation of the shaft and counter-balance of unpredictable wind disturbance...|$|E
40|$|Energy {{storage is}} {{important}} for many applications from hybrid vehicles to off-peak electric power to rotating machinery. A flywheel offers the combination of high energy density and high power density not attainable with other energy storage medium. In many situations, it is desirable to store energy at a constant angular velocity. This work proposes a novel self-governing fluidic variable <b>inertia</b> <b>flywheel</b> that can maintain a constant angular velocity {{across a range of}} energy storage. The fluidic flywheel uses a piston to separate the liquid filled chamber from a chamber vented to atmosphere. A force balance is created on the piston due to the radial pressure gradient of the liquid reacted by a constant force spring. Energy added to the system is stored in equally two forms: increases the kinetic energy of the flywheel at a constant angular velocity and increasing the potential energy of the constant force spring. A design example demonstrates that the fluidic flywheel enables a constant angular velocity with an order of magnitude lower mass moment of inertia than a conventional flywheel. This promising technology enables a simple constant angular velocity energy storage system, yet requires future work in numerous areas. I...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The object {{of this research was}} to investigate the period of time during which the clutch plates of a motor vehicle are engaged to effect a start from rest. The problem was approached from two sides, firstly a mathematical model has been produced {{in the form of a}} digital computer program. Secondly, practical investigations were undertaken in order to shed more light upon certain problem areas highlighted whilst developing the mathematical model. Finally the two types of investigations were combined to give a more realistic model of the engagement period than any that had previously been published. The mathematical model allowed parametric studies of the clutch to be made giving details of slip time, speeds, clamp load, friction level, heat generated and the one dimensional temperature distribution through one half of the clutch assembly. Two methods for the solution of the temperature distribution problem were used in order to give a cross check during the development of the mathematical model. Stability of the two methods has been investigated and limits suggested which if adhered to prevent instability errors occurring. Practical work on a test rig was carried out in order to investigate the variation of friction levels during the engagement period and also the temperatures reached. A test vehicle was instrumented to find out how the general public operated the clutch in service and how their operation varied with test conditions i. e. gradients and traffic conditions. Finally a computer controlled test rig comprising of an engine, clutch with e 1 ectro-hydraulic ram operation and <b>inertia</b> <b>flywheel</b> was developed. This rig was completely automatic and could be used to simulate different engagement rates, gradients and, if inertia were added or subtracted, different vehicles.

Also, a test facility has been developed which can be programmed to simulate in vehicle use.

40|$|The piston-cylinder liner {{interface}} comprises {{more than}} half of the total engine rubbing friction. With current demand being for internal combustion engines with better fuel economy, lower exhaust emissions and higher performance, reducing this form of friction is the subject of much study. The research reported in this thesis is concerned with the development of an existing floating liner rig to measure the friction in this region. The performance features of the modified setup have also been assessed. Parametric studies have been undertaken with the modified setup to identify the potential means of friction reduction. Modifications undertaken in the sealing method and driveline assembly has facilitated friction measurement at higher gas loading of up to 80 barg. The modified sealing assembly with a sealing ring overcame the problem of arbitrary force interruption through irregular liner and seal contacts. Addition of five times higher <b>inertia</b> <b>flywheel</b> aided the motor to support the rig with adequate torque during high gas loading operations. Calibrations have been performed at each different build of piston-liner combination to reduce build to build variability in measurement. Experimental studies have been undertaken to assess the friction characteristics for different factors such as operating pressure, temperature and speed, lubricant oil formulation, piston-liner clearance, piston material etc. Tests have been undertaken at a range of operating conditions; peak pressure of 0 to 80 barg, speed of 1000 to 2000 rpm and average mid-liner temperature of 40 to 90 ˚C. Peak cylinder pressure has been observed to be dominating the friction followed by temperature and speed. Friction spikes were observed near the top dead centre for pressurised operations; where normal load on the rings are highest in a cycle. Higher speed generally results in a higher total frictional loss. However at higher temperature and peak pressure, contrasting effect of speed on total friction has been reported. The study further identified that piston motion play important roles in determining mixed/boundary friction along with the local gas pressure, velocity and oil film temperature. Friction reductions have been obtained by using a lower viscosity oil and higher piston-liner clearance. Maximum friction reduction of 18...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{recovery}} duration on performance and fatigue pattern during short exercises was studied including and excluding the <b>flywheel</b> <b>inertia.</b> Subjects (11 males and 11 females) performed a force-velocity test {{to determine their}} optimal force (fopt). On the following day, subjects performed randomly 4 series of two 8 -s sprints against fopt, with 15 s (R 15), 30 s (R 30), 60 s (R 60), and 120 s (R 120) recovery between sprints. The cycle (Monark 824 E, Stockholm, Sweden) was equipped with an optical sensor to calculate the revolution velocity of the pedal. For each sprint, peak power (Ppeak), mechanical work (W) and time to reach Ppeak (tPpeak) were calculated including (I) and excluding (NI) the acceleration of the flywheel. For a given sprint, Ppeak and W were greater and tPpeak was lower in I compared to NI condition (p < 0. 05). Differences averaged 13 % for Ppeak, 20 % for W, 34 % for tPpeak, and remained constant between sprints 1 and 2. In sprint 2, Ppeak and W were significantly reduced compared to sprint 1 only after R 15 and R 30 in I and NI (p < 0. 05), and no gender differences occurred. In each sprint, Ppeak and W were higher (p < 0. 001) and tPpeak was shorter (p < 0. 05) in males than in females, and gender differences were the same including or excluding the <b>flywheel</b> <b>inertia.</b> In conclusion, values excluding inertia underestimated mechanical performance and consequently the total energy supply. However, the pattern of fatigue and gender differences in performance and fatigue remained unchanged whatever the condition (I or NI).
