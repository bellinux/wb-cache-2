5|$|Once {{rebuilding}} began, {{the poor}} rebuilt their basic {{housing in the}} same primitive fashion as before. By contrast, the wealthiest residents, both secular and spiritual, became caught in an almost manic orgy of building. Most members of the nobility had several homes in Sicily. For one thing, the Spanish viceroy spent {{six months of the}} year in Palermo and six in Catania, holding court in <b>each</b> <b>city,</b> and hence members of the aristocracy needed a town palazzo in <b>each</b> <b>city.</b> Once the palazzi in devastated Catania were rebuilt in the new fashion, the palazzi in Palermo seemed antiquated by comparison, so they too were eventually rebuilt. Following this, from the middle of the 18th century, villas to retire to in the autumn, essentially status symbols, were built at the fashionable enclave at Bagheria. This pattern was repeated, on a smaller scale, throughout the lesser cities of Sicily, <b>each</b> <b>city</b> providing a more entertaining social life and a magnetic draw for the provincial aristocrat than their country estate. The country estate also did not escape the building mania. Often Baroque wings or new façades were added to ancient castles, or country villas were completely rebuilt. Thus the frenzy of building gained momentum until the increasingly fantastical Baroque architecture demanded by these hedonistic patrons reached its zenith in the mid-18th century.|$|E

5|$|As {{the largest}} Canadian cities {{grew in the}} 1950s and 1960s, the volume of mail passing through the country's postal system also grew, to billions of items by the 1950s and {{tens of billions of}} items by the mid-1960s. Consequently, it became {{progressively}} more difficult for employees who handsorted mail to memorize and keep track of all the individual letter-carrier routes within <b>each</b> <b>city.</b> New technology that allowed mail to be delivered faster also contributed to the pressure for these employees to properly sort the mail.|$|E

5|$|The BBWAA first {{awarded the}} modern MVP after the 1931 season, {{adopting}} the format the National League used to distribute its league award.

In 1938, the BBWAA raised the number of voters to three per city and gave 14 points for a first-place vote. The only significant change since then occurred in 1961, {{when the number of}} voters was reduced to two per league city.|$|E

Three cities submitted bids to host the event: Albena, Tallinn and Baku.|$|E

5|$|Bellaire {{currently}} has a city manager style of government. The home rule government was established on April 2, 1949, replacing the general law form of government. The city council {{is made up}} of the mayor and six city council members. All are elected at large. The mayor is elected for two-year terms, while <b>each</b> <b>city</b> council member is elected for four-year terms. The mayor may not serve for more than four terms in that position. A council members may have no more than two terms as a city council member. Bellaire has zoning ordinances that dictate types of structures and uses throughout sections of the city. As of 2015, the mayor is Dr. Phil Nauert. The six council members are, in order of position, Roman F. Reed (1), Jim Avioli, Sr. (2), Gus Pappas (3), Pat McLaughlan (4), Andrew S. Friedberg (5), and Mandy Nathan (6).|$|E
5|$|<b>Each</b> <b>city</b> {{and county}} in the Metro service area has similar {{ordinances}} that regulate or prohibit vending on Metro-owned property, and which prohibit riders from eating, drinking, or smoking in Metro trains, buses, and stations; the Transit Police {{have a reputation for}} enforcing these laws rigorously. One widely publicized incident occurred in October 2000 when police arrested 12-year-old Ansche Hedgepeth for eating french fries in the Tenleytown-AU station. In a 2004 opinion by John Roberts, now Chief Justice of the United States, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Hedgepeth's arrest. By then WMATA had answered negative publicity by adopting a policy of first issuing warnings to juveniles, and arresting them only after three violations within a year.|$|E
5|$|In either 469 or 466 BC, the Persians began {{assembling}} a large army and navy {{for a major}} offensive against the Greeks. Gathering near the Eurymedon, {{it is possible that}} the expedition aimed to move up the coast of Asia Minor, capturing <b>each</b> <b>city</b> in turn. This would bring the Asiatic Greek regions back under Persian control, and give the Persians naval bases from which to launch further expeditions into the Aegean. Hearing of the Persian preparations, the Athenian general Cimon took 200 triremes and sailed to Phaselis in Pamphylia, which eventually agreed to join the Delian League. This effectively blocked the Persian strategy at its first objective.|$|E

5|$|In {{those areas}} which the Red Army had {{captured}} {{and before the}} fighting in {{the centre of the}} city had stopped, the Soviet authorities took measures to start restoring essential services. Almost all transport {{in and out of the}} city had been rendered inoperative, and bombed-out sewers had contaminated the city's water supplies. The Soviet authorities appointed local Germans to head <b>each</b> <b>city</b> block, and organised the cleaning-up. The Red Army made a major effort to feed the residents of the city. Most Germans, both soldiers and civilians, were grateful to receive food issued at Red Army soup kitchens which began on Colonel-General Nikolai Berzarin's orders. After the capitulation the Soviets went house to house, arresting and imprisoning anyone in a uniform including firemen and railwaymen.|$|E
5|$|Levels in {{the console}} {{versions}} of Underground were significantly {{larger than those}} of earlier Tony Hawk's games. Neversoft expanded each level until it ceased to run correctly, then shrunk it slightly. Most of the levels were modelled closely after real-world locations; the designers traveled to locales representative of <b>each</b> <b>city</b> {{in the game and}} took photographs and videos as reference. The New Jersey level was a replication of a neighborhood where team artist Henry Ji had grown up as a young skater. Neversoft wanted the player to become familiar with the basic game mechanics quickly and to notice Undergrounds differences from previous Tony Hawk's titles immediately. To accomplish this, they introduced the ability to travel on foot, and the ability to climb along ledges in the first few missions of the game. While Neversoft wanted to keep Underground realistic and relatable for the most part, they added driving side-missions as an enjoyable diversion and to push the boundaries of freedom in skateboarding games. However, these missions were intended not to take away from the main experience of skateboarding.|$|E
5|$|Once the {{candidate}} cities are selected, they must {{submit to the}} IOC a bigger and more detailed presentation of their project {{as part of a}} candidature file. <b>Each</b> <b>city</b> is thoroughly analysed by an evaluation commission. This commission will also visit {{the candidate}} cities, interviewing local officials and inspecting prospective venue sites, and submit a report on its findings one month prior to the IOC's final decision. During the interview process the candidate city must also guarantee that {{it will be able to}} fund the Games. After the work of the evaluation commission, a list of candidates is presented to the General Session of the IOC, which must assemble in a country that does not have a candidate city in the running. The IOC members gathered in the Session have the final vote on the host city. Once elected, the host city bid committee (together with the NOC of the respective country) signs a Host City Contract with the IOC, officially becoming an Olympic host nation and host city.|$|E
