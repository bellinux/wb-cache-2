25|$|Another common reason {{nowadays}} for Global serializability relaxation is {{the requirement}} of availability of internet products and services. This requirement is typically answered by large scale <b>data</b> <b>replication.</b> The straightforward solution for synchronizing replicas' updates of a same database object is including all these updates in a single atomic distributed transaction. However, with many replicas such a transaction is very large, and may span several computers and networks {{that some of them}} are likely to be unavailable. Thus such a transaction is likely to end with abort and miss its purpose.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In mobile {{transaction}} process, {{there exists}} frequently <b>data</b> transferring and <b>replication.</b> By the bandwidth limitation, discontinuous characteristics, {{there are a}} lot of questions in mobile <b>data</b> loss, <b>replication</b> failure, etc. Aimed at the questions, the paper proposes several mobile <b>data</b> transfer and <b>replication</b> algorithms based on agent. Every proposed algorithm is analyzed and simulation is performed to compare their delay. Result shows that through collecting small data transactions by agent, data are batch processed to servers, which may reduce the total cost of replication and promote replication success ratio and reduce the delay of replications. Adaptive algorithm is also considered. ...|$|R

30|$|To {{get fast}} delivery, flooding-based schemes can achieve very short routing latency. However, taking data size into consideration, some <b>data</b> and their <b>replications</b> will soon occupy most of storage space and prevent other data from being relayed. In this section, {{we aim to}} reduce the cost of {{forwarding}} while retaining high routing performance by controlling the number and threshold of replications. In previous work, the STOP condition could be a fixed number of copies, a given time-to-live [31], or a dynamic threshold [32]. Different from previous work, we do not give any fixed number of copies since it is allowed to drop <b>data</b> <b>replications</b> in the forwarding process. Also with the replication threshold, there will generate less copies in the network. Thus, the overhead is under control while performance is greatly improved. There are two main operations in the multi-copy scenario: one is the data replicating, and the other is data dropping.|$|R

We have recently evaluated the performance of two information retrieval schemes that are designed to work in the DTN environments. Our schemes utilize both query and <b>data</b> <b>replications</b> to enhance the query success rate. Besides designing efficient query and data dissemination schemes, one needs to consider the security aspects since sensitive data should only be accessed by authorized personnel. In this paper, we present a data-centric security solution for an information retrieval system which we design for DTN environments. We also describe the preliminary prototype that we have built.

In our previous work, we have proposed the resilient methods based on random behavior and <b>data</b> <b>replications</b> to improve route diversification, thus to take advantage of redundant network structure. Following these previous methods, we propose in this paper a new resilient method based on network coding techniques to improve resilience in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) for smart metering applications. More precisely, using our resilience metric based on a performance surface, we compare several variants of a well-known gradient based routing protocol with the previous methods (random routing and packet replications) and the new proposed methods (two network coding techniques). The proposed methods outperformed the previous methods in terms of data delivery success even in the presence of high attack intensity...|$|R
40|$|I {{study the}} link between real {{activity}} and deflation, taking into account measurement problems in 19 th century CPI <b>data.</b> <b>Replications</b> based on modern data show that measurement problems spuriously increase the volatility of inflation {{as well as the}} number of deflationary episodes, and they lower inflation persistence. As a consequence, estimates of {{the link between}} real activity and deflation may be attenuated because of the errors-in-variables problem. I find that real activity was on average substantially lower during 19 th century deflations in the US, after controlling for measurement error using an IV-regression approach. Moreover, the average short-fall in real activity was not significantly different compared to the Great Depression. Using well-measured data for a panel of 17 industrialized economies shows that milder deflations were associated with a lower output gap. But, the association with GDP growth is not statistically significant...|$|R
