50|$|Higher gain rating (dBi) {{indicates}} further deviation (generally {{toward the}} horizontal) from a theoretical, perfect isotropic radiator, {{and therefore the}} further the antenna can project a usable signal, as compared to a similar output power on a more isotropic antenna. For example, an 8 dBi antenna used with a 100 mW driver will have a similar horizontal range to a 6 dBi antenna being driven at 500 mW. Note that this assumes that radiation in the vertical is lost; {{this may not be}} the case in some situations, especially in large buildings or within a waveguide. In the above example, a <b>directional</b> <b>waveguide</b> could cause the low power 6 dBi antenna to project much further in a single direction than the 8 dBi antenna which is not in a waveguide, even if they are both being driven at 100 mW.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Conventional UHF {{high power}} {{balanced}} combiners {{are large and}} only capable of handling multiple channels over less than a 20 % frequency span due to the limitations of their waveguide couplers. Apart from restricting the channels which may be planned for an antenna, such systems do not allow for the flexibility of adding unplanned channels later if they are outside that span. The new <b>Directional</b> <b>Waveguide</b> Combiner configuration has a 46 % frequency span limited only by the bandwidth of waveguide enabling US channels 14 to 60 to be transmitted at high power through one antenna system for the first time.

50|$|Other {{than the}} {{narrowing}} vertical coverage, {{the length of}} the array also plays a role in what wavelengths will be affected by this narrowing of dispersion. The longer the array, the lower frequency the pattern will control. At frequencies below 100 Hz (wavelength of 11.3 ft) the line array which is less than approximately 3 meter long will start to become omnidirectional, so the system will not conform to line array theory across all frequencies. Above about 400 Hz the driver cones themselves become directional, again violating the theory’s assumptions, and at high frequencies, many practical systems use <b>directional</b> <b>waveguides</b> whose behavior cannot be described using classical line array theory. In short, the geometry of real-world audio line arrays as used in public address systems can only be modeled approximately by line array theory, and only in the 100-400 Hz range.|$|R
