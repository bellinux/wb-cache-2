50|$|The short runways at Polebrook {{were found}} to be {{unsatisfactory}} for the operation of the <b>heavy-loaded,</b> four-engine B-17. In 1942 the airfield was improved to Class A airfield standards. The main runway was extended to 1,950 yards and the secondary runways to 1,400 yards each. In addition, additional hardstands were constructed, increasing the total number from 30 to 50. This enlargement resulted in the unusual situation that the ammunition storage area was inside the extended perimeter track. The living and communal sites were dispersed in woodlands north of the airfield. They provided accommodations to about 2,000 personnel.|$|E
5000|$|While the {{projected}} {{cost to the}} government is currently estimated at 14 billion dollars to stage and prepare for the world cup in many ways, {{there are many other}} costs to think about when approaching such a <b>heavy-loaded</b> topic such as the 2014 World Cup. To produce an event of this magnitude many sacrifices must be made when deciding where and how to go about creating these venues that will eventually be on the world's stage. In order to create space for these events certain choices had to be made, as to where the infrastructure would be located in order to support the stadium itself. Certain concessions had to be made in order effectively place these venues where both FIFA and the government felt was the most effective place for them to be. Because of this decision in may of 2014 in Brasilia, Brazil indigenous protesters clashed with police on horseback during a protest of the World cup which ended with one policeman shot in the leg and in response the police fired tear gas into the crowd and dispersed the protest.In a separate but similar example police evicted an indigenous population of between 10-20 different ethnicities next to the Maracana stadium in Rio de Janeiro in order to prepare for the upcoming [...] "Mega Event". These residents were living informally in the abandoned Brazilian Indian Museum in the heart of Rio, however it had become a known fact and for the time leading up the evictions the residence were allowed to live in the location in peace. However, when the Event was announced the police eviction was violent and abrupt. Later it was discovered that these evictions were carried out in order to make room for a new parking garage for the stadium.|$|E

40|$|The main {{difference}} between locomotive schedule of heavy haul railways {{and that of}} regular rail transportation {{is the number of}} locomotives utilized for one train. One <b>heavy-loaded</b> train usually has more than one locomotive, but a regular train only has one. This paper develops an optimization model for the multilocomotive scheduling problem (MLSP) through analyzing the current locomotive schedule of Da-qin Railway. The objective function of our paper is to minimize the total number of utilized locomotives. The MLSP is nondeterministic polynomial (NP) hard. Therefore, we convert the multilocomotive traction problem into a single-locomotive traction problem. Then, the single-locomotive traction problem (SLTP) can be converted into an assignment problem. The Hungarian algorithm is applied to solve the model and obtain the optimal locomotive schedule. We use the variance of detention time of locomotives at stations to evaluate the stability of locomotive schedule. In order {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the proposed optimization model, case studies for 20 [*]kt and 30 [*]kt <b>heavy-loaded</b> combined trains on Da-qin Railway are both conducted. Compared to the current schedules, the optimal schedules from the proposed models can save 62 and 47 locomotives for 20 [*]kt and 30 [*]kt <b>heavy-loaded</b> combined trains, respectively.

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study dynamic-characteristics of asphalt-pavement on {{semi-rigid}} base loaded with moving, <b>heavy-load.</b> Based on transient-dynamics theory, three-dimensional finite-element (FE) model was developed for structural dynamic-responses analysis using ANSYS software. The heavy-duty axle-load model was established according to Belgium-Design Code, and the dynamic-load was simplified as sinusoidal-wave load. For the pavement mechanics indexes(road-surface deflection, the vertical and lateral stress, the shear stress and the strain), the time-history curves and distribution conditions in the structure were presented. Expect tensile-strain at surface-layer, the relationship between axle-load weight and mechanic-indexes are almost linearly proportional. The calculation shows that under moving <b>heavy-load,</b> the surface-layer suffers from rather high vertical compressive-stress and shear-stress, the base and subbase are loaded with high tensile-stress and the subgrade top undergoes large vertical-strain. For asphalt-pavement on semi-rigid loaded with moving, <b>heavy-load,</b> besides the conventional indexes (including road-surface deflection and tensile-stress at the bottom of base or subbase), the design indexes should also include the shear-stress on road surface, the vertical-strain on the top of subgrade and the vertical compressive-stress on road surface...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{adaptive}} and distributed algorithms for motion coordination {{of a group}} of m vehicles. The vehicles must service demands whose time of arrival, spatial location, and service requirement are stochastic; the objective is to minimize the average time demands spend in the system. The general problem is known as the m-vehicle Dynamic Traveling Repairman Problem (m-DTRP). The best previously known control algorithms rely on centralized task assignment and are not robust against changes in the environment. In this paper, we first devise new control policies for the 1 -DTRP that: i) are provably optimal both in light-load conditions (i. e., when the arrival rate for the demands is small) and in <b>heavy-load</b> conditions (i. e., when the arrival rate for the demands is large), and ii) are adaptive, in particular, they are robust against changes in load conditions. Then, we show that specific partitioning policies, whereby the environment is partitioned among the vehicles and each vehicle follows a certain set of rules within its own region, are optimal in <b>heavy-load</b> conditions. Building upon the previous results, we finally design control policies for the m-DTRP that i) are adaptive and distributed, and ii) have strong performance guarantees in <b>heavy-load</b> conditions and stabilize the system in any load condition...|$|R

30|$|The track {{stiffness}} {{can also}} be classified into dynamic stiffness and static stiffness [2, 5, 6]. The resistance of track structure to deformation under a static load is called as static stiffness, which, usually, {{is determined by the}} deformation degree of track structure under the static load. The dynamic stiffness refers to the resistance of track structure to deformation under certain dynamic excitation, which is determined by the natural frequencies of track structure. The track dynamic stiffness reflects the supporting performance of the vibrating track structure and therefore is an important factor influencing the wheel–rail interaction and train running performance. However, the static stiffness is always adopted instead for the traditional mechanical analysis of the wheel–rail system. The rapid development of high-speed railway passenger transportation, <b>heavy-loaded</b> train transportation, and railway engineering technologies makes the theoretical analysis and practical measurement of dynamic stiffness significant.|$|E

Whether chronic loading in {{the frame}} of professional activity impacts bone, particularly cortical bone which markedly contributes to bone strength, is poorly documented. The influence of various occupation-dependent load intensities on geometry and mechanical properties of upper limbs bones was investigated in two models: ex-vivo in the SIMON anthropological skeleton collection, a homogeneous collection of the 20 th century, using CT scans of bilateral humerus and radius from 219 men (age of death 20 to 93 years); in-vivo at distal radius in 180 65 -years old men using high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography and finite element analysis. In both models, <b>heavy-loading</b> professional activities were associated with higher bone strength. In ex vivo data, this benefit was associated with higher cross sectional areas (CSA) and cortical areas in young adult men skeletons compared with men with light-loading professional activity. These differences decreased in men who died at older ages. In older men, it was associated with smaller medullary area. This effect resulted in greater asymmetries of medullar area and of the cortical area/CSA ratio between the dominant and non-dominant humerus in men with unilateral versus bilateral <b>heavy-loading</b> professional activities. In vivo, <b>heavy-loading</b> professional activity was associated with higher trabecular density and lower trabecular spacing than in light-loading professional activities.
