5|$|After the Columbine High School {{massacre}} on April 20, 1999, {{gun shows}} and background checks became {{a focus of}} national debate in the United States. Weeks after the Columbine shooting, Frank Lautenberg introduced a proposal to close the gun show loophole in federal law. It was passed in the Senate, but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>pass</b> in the House.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of Nobunaga, Gifu's growth {{continued}} through the Edo period {{with the establishment of}} the Nakasendō as one of Tokugawa's five routes. Although the route <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>pass</b> directly through Gifu, the nearby post towns of Kanō-juku and Gōdo-juku provided traffic and were later amalgamated into the modern city of Gifu. The area continued to prosper once Gifu became a central location along the Nakasendō.|$|E
5|$|Italy in 1960, the Soviet Union in 1980, and South Korea in 1988 made {{requests}} to have rugby union brought back.

Baseball and Bases Loaded, although the magazine <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>pass</b> any judgment on which game was superior.

5|$|The couple then {{journeyed to}} Claremont in Surrey for the honeymoon, but the {{presence}} of attendants on the journey, and at meal times, {{made it impossible for}} them to talk privately. The short four-day visit <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>pass</b> without an interruption from the Queen, who was curious about her daughter's thoughts on married life. Among their wedding gifts was a maplewood desk from Queen Victoria, now at Inveraray Castle.|$|E

5|$|After being urged into {{politics}} by his uncle, Judge Roscoe Tartar, Cooper ran unopposed {{for a seat}} in the Kentucky House of Representatives as a Republican in 1927. As a member of the House, he was one of only three Republicans to oppose Republican Governor Flem D. Sampson's unsuccessful attempt to politicize the state department of health; the measure failed by a single vote. Cooper supported the governor's plan to provide free textbooks for the state's school children and sponsored legislation to prohibit judges from issuing injunctions to end labor strikes, although the latter bill <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>pass.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the 1920s, Wyatt gave Sadie signed legal {{papers and}} filing fees to {{a claim for}} an oil lease in Kern County, California. She gambled away the filing fees and lied to Wyatt about what {{happened}} to the lease, which later turned out to be valuable. Distrustful of her ability to manage her finances, Wyatt made an arrangement with her sister Henrietta Lenhardt. Wyatt put oil leases he owned in Henrietta's name with the agreement that the proceeds would benefit Sadie after his death. Henrietta's three children voided the agreement after their mother's death and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>pass</b> on the royalties to her.|$|E
5|$|Kurosaki {{originally}} {{became interested}} in becoming a performer during her elementary years.

She <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>pass</b> the audition as she lacked talent in performing, but her singing was praised. This event would leave an impression on her, and as her parents were not interested in her taking up performance arts, she decided that she wanted to become a singer.|$|E

Macartney topped the batting aggregates and averages with 2,317 runs at 59.41 in the first-class matches. He took only eight wickets at 32.63 for the entire tour.|$|E
5|$|On immigration, Moran {{supported}} a pathway to citizenship {{for illegal immigrants}} and did not support decreasing the number of legal immigrants allowed into the country or the enforcement of federal immigration laws by state and local police. He was a cosponsor of the Comprehensive Immigration Reform ASAP Act of 2009 (H.R.4321), which the House <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>pass.</b> He was given an overall immigration reduction grade of D by NumbersUSA.

The actual appropriations bills for Fiscal Year 2012 included four continuing resolutions and three full-year appropriations bills enacted in November and December 2011, in accordance with the United States budget process. These appropriations were greatly affected by the Budget Control Act of 2011, passed in August 2011 as a resolution to the debt-ceiling crisis; it mandated budget cuts over a ten-year period beginning with Fiscal Year 2012.|$|E

5|$|The {{child in}} the man's arms was wearing light-coloured pink pyjamas with a floral pattern and cuffs on the legs, similar to Madeleine's. Tanner {{described}} the man as white, dark-haired, 5ft 7 in (1.70 m) tall, of southern European or Mediterranean appearance, 35–40 years old, wearing gold or beige trousers and a dark jacket, and {{said he did not}} look like a tourist. Tanner told the Portuguese police, but they <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>pass</b> the description to the media until 25 May. Madeleine's Fund hired a forensic artist to create an image of the man (left), which was released in October 2007.|$|E
5|$|The queen never {{achieved}} autocratic {{powers and}} the noble council continued to function. However, Tamar's own prestige {{and the expansion}} of patronq'moba – a Georgian version of feudalism – kept the more powerful dynastic princes from fragmenting the kingdom. This was a classical period in the history of Georgian feudalism. Attempts at transplanting feudal practices in the areas where they had previously been almost unknown <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>pass</b> without resistance. Thus, there was a revolt among the mountaineers of Pkhovi and Dido on Georgia's northeastern frontier in 1212, which was put down by Ivane Zakarid-Mkhargrzeli after three months of heavy fighting.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} Florida International University's {{founding}} began in 1943, when state Senator Ernest 'Cap' Graham (father of future Florida governor and U.S. senator Bob Graham) presented {{the state legislature}} with the initial proposal {{for the establishment of}} a public university in South Florida. While his bill <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>pass,</b> Graham persisted in presenting his proposal to colleagues, advising them of Miami's need for a state university. He felt the establishment of a public university was necessary to serve the city's growing population.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{in other}} winter disciplines, Australia {{started in the}} upper half of the field in the moguls; Nicholas Cleaver and Adrian Costa placed 11th and 14th out of 47 {{competitors}} in 1992. Since then, the results deteriorated into {{the lower half of the}} rankings, until 2006, when Canadian-born Dale Begg-Smith won gold and four Australians qualified for the 35-man competition. Manuela Berchtold, the only female Australian representative in 2006, came 14th out of 30 competitors. In 2010, Begg-Smith won silver, while two other moguls racers, one male and one female, were outside the top half and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>pass</b> the first round.|$|E
5|$|A major push {{occurred}} in 2002 when officials from Emery County, joined by Utah governor Mike Leavitt, petitioned President George W. Bush {{to use the}} authority of the Antiquities Act and create a San Rafael Swell National Monument. This effort lost momentum after the governor promised to honor the wishes of Emery County residents via a non-binding referendum, which <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>pass.</b> Common reasons given by residents for opposing the designation included fear of the federal government restricting access and a repetition of events that occurred with the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. This monument was established in 1996, by President Bill Clinton. In that case the monument was proposed at the federal level in secret. Boundaries were drawn without the consent or even knowledge of local residents. This incited anger and triggered a backlash in rural Utah.|$|E
5|$|Amtrak {{inherited}} {{an aging}} and mechanically-incompatible fleet of diesel locomotives from various private railroads on its startup in 1971. The most modern locomotives remained {{in private hands}} to operate the various commuter services which, by law, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>pass</b> to Amtrak. To replace these Amtrak ordered 150 EMD SDP40F locomotives, which began entering service in 1973. These were supplemented by 25 GE P30CHs which entered service in 1975. The SDP40F was a troubled design; problems with weight distribution led {{to a series of}} derailments in the mid-1970s. Meanwhile, the poor truck design of the P30CH (and the electric GE E60CP) curtailed further orders of that unit when Amtrak found itself needing more short- and medium-distance power in the spring of 1975.|$|E
