40|$|Background: Coronary {{artery disease}} (CAD) {{is the most}} common {{cardiovascular}} disorder in adults. This study was performed to elucidate the role of active leptin, homocysteine, galectin- 3, total phospholipids, total, bound, free <b>hexosamines,</b> free-to-bound <b>hexosamines</b> ratio in the pathogenesis of chronic myocardial ischemia and studying the effect of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) on their serum levels. Methods: A prospective case control study was carried out on 100 ischemic heart disease male patients undergoing elective CABG and 25 healthy males. Serum levels of total phospholipids, total and free <b>hexosamines,</b> were estimated using spectrophotometric methods, while, serum levels of active leptin, homocysteine and galectin- 3 were estimated using ELISA assay kit. Results: Significant higher serum active leptin, homocysteine, galectin- 3, free <b>hexosamines</b> and free to bound <b>hexosamines</b> ratio levels preoperatively when compared with the control group (p <  0. 01 for all) with significant lowering of their serum levels following CABG (p <  0. 01 for all) except for active leptin. Significant lower serum total phospholipids, total and bound <b>hexosamines</b> levels preoperatively when compared with the control group (p <  0. 01 for all) with significant elevations in their serum levels following CABG (p <  0. 01 for all). Conclusions: High active leptin, homocysteine, galectin- 3, free and free to bound <b>hexosamines</b> ratio and low total phospholipids, total and bound <b>hexosamines</b> {{play an important role in}} the pathogenesis of myocardial ischemia. The serum levels of homocysteine, galectin- 3, <b>hexosamines</b> and total phospholipids, but not active leptin are significantly lowered following CABG...|$|R
40|$|The fecal {{excretion}} {{of total}} nitrogen and of total <b>hexosamines</b> {{has been determined}} in germfree and conventional rats. Germfree rats excreted more <b>hexosamines</b> than the conventional rats, while {{no difference in the}} nitrogen excretion was found. Infection of the germfree rats with a normal flora resulted in a temporarily increased excretion of <b>hexosamines</b> and nitrogen over a period of 2 to 3 days after which they reached the level of the conventional animals. The contents of the germfree cecum contained 65 to 137 mg of <b>hexosamines</b> and 57 to 127 mg of nitrogen as compared to 1. 2 to 5. 3 and 7. 4 to 23 mg in conventional animals. The high figures for <b>hexosamines</b> were due to an increase in the total amount of contents in the cecum and to a fivefold increase in the concentration of hexosamine-containing material. Studies on the distribution of hexosamine-containing cecal contents between sediment and supernatant after centrifugation at 20, 000 g for 2 hours demonstrated that 5 to 10 per cent of the <b>hexosamines</b> occurred in the sediment in the germfree rats, while 75 to 85 per cent was found in this fraction in the conventional rats. The soluble part of the cecal contents in germfree {{as well as in the}} conventional rats contained 70 per cent of <b>hexosamines</b> in molecules with a molecular weight above approximatively 100, 000 as found by gel filtration experiments on sephadex gels.

50|$|Together {{with his}} {{students}} and collaborators, {{over the next}} 20 years, McCarty's work changed {{the understanding of the}} organism from a gram-positive streptococcus with a particular serological characteristic to one of the best characterized bacterial species. Work on bacterial cell-wall anatomy and chemistry was just beginning. His work led to the isolation of the streptococcal cell wall as a structural entity suitable for anatomic inspection by electronmicroscopy. Chemical dissection led to characterization of the group A-specific polysaccharide and the peptidoglycan, and the identification of its serological specificity in the terminal <b>hexosamine.</b> In order to prove this specificity, he first had to identify and purify a specific enzyme that cleaved <b>hexosamine</b> (a hexosaminidase) from a soil organism. Treating the polysaccharide with this enzyme abrogated its serological reactivity. McCarty further demonstrated the precise configuration of the <b>hexosamine</b> linkage by synthesizing both α- and β-N-acetyl-glucosamine ovalbumin and showing that only the second reacted with group A antisera. A similar analytical strategy indicated that the polysaccharide of group C streptococci differed by having a terminal β-N-acetyl galactosamine as the serological determinant.|$|E

We examined whether exogenous <b>hexosamines</b> or their sulphated forms would increase steady-state levels of aggrecan and hyaluronan synthase (HAS) or glycosaminoglycan synthesis using Northern blot and 35 S-sulphate incorporation analyses.

Northern blot assay showed that neither <b>hexosamines</b> nor glucosamine sulphate salt stimulated aggrecan and HAS- 2 mRNA expression.

This process is based on the separation and quantification of <b>hexosamines</b> (glucosamine and galactosamine), released as products of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) hydrolysis presents in urine, by HPLC and detected by fluorescence measures. The concentration of galactosamine and glucosamine in urine of 20 persons as control sample and 9 patients with MPS III was determined. The control group showed similar concentrations of both <b>hexosamines</b> in urine, whereas in the group of MPS III patients the concentration of glucosamine was significantly higher than galactosamine.

In the present study, the effects of <b>hexosamines</b> and fish oils on H+-ATPase activity have been characterised for isolated bovine articular chondrocytes. Cells isolated {{in the presence of}} IL- 1 were acidified, and the fraction of acid extrusion mediated by Na+-H+ exchange and an H+-ATPase were determined using specific inhibitors. Exposure to IL- 1 significantly enhanced both components of acid extrusion. Co-incubation with glucosamine or mannosamine attenuated the H+-ATPase fraction of efflux. The addition of glucosamine at 9 h after exposure to IL- 1 [...] when H+-ATPase activation is already apparent [...] was also able to abolish H+-ATPase activity, implying that <b>hexosamines</b> do not exert effects at the level of protein synthesis. Co-incubation with the glucose transport inhibitor phloretin elicited similar effects to the <b>hexosamines,</b> suggesting that modulation of adenosine triphosphate levels may underlie their effects on H+-ATPase function. The omega- 3 fish oil linolenic acid but not the omega- 6 fish oil linoleic acid reduced H+-ATPase activity to levels seen in IL- 1 -untreated cells, although total efflux remained elevated, {{as a result of an}} enhanced H+ leak.
