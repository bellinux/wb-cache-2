40|$|The current Internet {{architecture}} requires {{applications to}} transparently bind and manage network addresses and ports. This design creates and exacerbates several {{problems for the}} current Internet {{as well as its}} future evolution. These problems and challenges include (1) network address mobility and multihoming; (2) future Internet evolution; (3) service- or content-centricity; and (4) adding, subtracting, or evolving the layers in the network stack. To address all of these problems, this thesis introduces a novel approach to Internet naming and addressing, which we call <b>hidden</b> <b>identifiers.</b> Hidden identifiers enable applications to semantically express the exact network resource they desire, and allows the operating system to subsequently bind and manage all other network concerns. In this manner, we provide integrated support for all the problem-cases enumerated above while simultaneously simplifying the network API presented to applications. We introduce, implement, and evaluate HIDRA, the first network stack architecture based on <b>hidden</b> <b>identifiers.</b> We show that this network stack provides integrated support for features such as network mobility and multihoming, and explain how the HIDRA architecture can support a wide range of semantic bindings. Finally, we show how this feature can be leveraged to support the goals of information-centric networking on top of the existing TCP/IP network stack by slightly modifying DNS and HTTP...|$|R

Namespaces (or a similar technique, see Emulating namespaces) provide a mechanism for <b>hiding</b> local <b>identifiers.</b> They provide a means of grouping logically related identifiers into corresponding namespaces, thereby making the system more modular.|$|R
40|$|Today's socket API {{requires}} an application to bind a socket to a transport-layer identifier (e. g., TCP 80) and network-layer identifier (e. g., an IP address). These early bindings create significant bottlenecks, reliability issues, and force applications to manage complex lower-layer issues. Many approaches {{have been proposed}} to address these problems; however, all of them introduce additional identifiers, modify applications, or require additional protocols in the protocol stack. We introduce HIDRA (Hidden Identifiers for Demultiplexing and Resolution Architecture), an approach based on <b>hidden</b> <b>identifiers</b> used internally at end systems and intermediate systems. HIDRA enables sockets to evolve with the Internet by hiding all mobility, multihoming, and multiplexing issues from applications; does not induce significant overhead in the protocol stack; preserves backwards compatibility with today's Internet and applications; and does not require or preclude any additional identifiers or protocols {{to be used in}} the protocol stack...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Wireless ad hoc {{networks}} are so vulnerable to passive attacks and eavesdropping adversaries {{due to their}} shared medium which makes network traffic easy to capture and analyze. Therefore, security and privacy protections are of extreme importance for protocols and applications in such networks. In this paper, we introduce a new framework for anonymous routing, named chain-based routing, to improve the privacy. In our framework, nodes on a path are virtually bound to each other like a chain. Each node is only aware of its associated links in a flow and does not require any other information about source, destination, or {{other parts of the}} chain. Based on this framework, we propose an on-demand routing protocol, called Chain-based Anonymous Routing (CAR), which uses unicast-based broadcast data transfer to fulfill anonymous communication in wireless ad hoc networks. Through <b>hiding</b> <b>identifiers</b> of nodes inside the chain, CAR realizes sender, receiver, and relationship anonymity in addition to untraceability in the network. Moreover, it is resistant {{to a wide range of}} passive attacks while adapting to implement other security mechanisms in the presence of active attacks. Keywords-component; Wireless ad hoc networks, security, anonymity, chain-based routing, unicast-based broadcast. I...|$|R
40|$|Advancement {{in digital}} {{archiving}} technologies provides researchers with {{a multitude of}} methods for sharing their research and data digitally with others. However, when acquiring data from others directly or indirectly the law often imposes an assumption of copyright in the dataset acquired. This creates a difficult legal situation affecting future use and creation of derivative works from the data. A digital commons may {{be defined as a}} shared resource in which creators of contributed materials (data) grant a legal right for all others to use the material under the provisions of an open-access license. This thesis hypothesizes that an approach can be developed that automates the intellectual property rights and licensing management for contributors to a commons of geographic data. In addition, an approach can be developed such that contributors receive credit for their data, and the source of the data can be identified even through generations of alteration and reuse. The technological approach presented centers around embedding both visible and <b>hidden</b> <b>identifiers</b> in contributed data files. The identifiers, which remain intact through reuse and derivatives of the data, display the open-access licensing provision...|$|R
40|$|The {{computer}} science education research field studies how students learn {{computer science}} related {{concepts such as}} programming and algorithms. One of the major goals of the field is to help students learn CS concepts that are often difficult to grasp because students rarely encounter them in primary or secondary education. In order to help struggling students, information on the learning process of students has to be collected. In many introductory programming courses process data is automatically collected {{in the form of}} source code snapshots. Source code snapshots usually include at least the source code of the student's program and a timestamp. Studies ranging from identifying at-risk students to inferring programming experience and topic knowledge have been conducted using source code snapshots. However, replicating source code snapshot -based studies is currently hard as data is rarely shared due to privacy concerns. Source code snapshot data often includes many attributes {{that can be used for}} identification, for example the name of the student or the student number. There can even be <b>hidden</b> <b>identifiers</b> in the data that can be used for identification even if obvious identifiers are removed. For example, keystroke data from source code snapshots can be used for identification based on the distinct typing profiles of students. Hence, simply removing explicit identifiers such as names and student numbers is not enough to protect the privacy of the users who have supplied the data. At the same time, removing all keystroke data would decrease the value of the data significantly and possibly preclude replication studies. In this work, we investigate how keystroke data from a programming context could be modified to prevent keystroke latency -based identification whilst still retaining valuable information in the data. This study is the first step in enabling the sharing of anonymized source code snapshots. We investigate the degree of anonymization required to make identification of students based on their typing patterns unreliable. Then, we study whether the modified keystroke data can still be used to infer the programming experience of the students as a case study of whether the anonymized typing patterns have retained at least some informative value. We show that it is possible to modify data so that keystroke latency -based identification is no longer accurate, but the programming experience of the students can still be inferred, i. e. the data still has value to researchers...|$|R

By modifying the tag ID of objects periodically or manually using cellular phone built-in a RFID reader chip {{or with a}} external RFID reader device, we can prevent other people from gathering the information related with objects querying information server (like an EPC IS) with a tag ID or deriving the information from tag ID’s code structure or tracking {{the location of the}} objects and the owner of the objects. In this paper, we use a cryptographic algorithm for modification and restoring of RFID tag ID, and for one original tag ID, there are several different temporary tag ID, periodically.

40|$|Documents {{containing}} {{personally identifiable information}} {{cannot be}} shared freely. Text sanitization {{plays an important role}} in information dissemination. Current sanitization methods and techniques have focused on finding and hiding personally identifiable information, giving different importance to each. The process of finding personally identifiable information has received more attention by the scientific community than the process of <b>hiding</b> the discovered <b>identifiers.</b> ^ This work presents the use of ontologies as an alternative to efficiently handle the main issues of text sanitization. First we present the ontological framework that supports an information-theoretic approach to reduce sensitivity and identifiability. We then present how the use of properties and axioms from the ontology are used to optimize semantics and utility of text without compromising privacy. Finally, we explain a set of algorithms optimizing semantics with multiple word senses using ontologies and how the result can be used as an alternative to word sense disambiguation as shown by experimental results. ...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{efforts to}} {{incorporate}} aspects of artificial intelligence {{into the design}} and operation of automatic control systems have focused attention on techniques such as fuzzy logic, artificial neural networks, and expert systems. Although LMS algorithm has been {{considered to be a}} popular method of system identification but it has been seen in many situations that accurate system identification is not achieved by employing this technique. On the other hand, artificial neural network (ANN) has been chosen as a suitable alternative approach to nonlinear system identification due to its good function approximation capabilities i. e. ANNs are capable of generating complex mapping between input and output spaces. Thus, ANNs can be employed for modeling of complex dynamical systems with reasonable degree of accuracy. The use of computers for direct digital control highlights the recent trend toward more effective and efficient heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) control methodologies. The HVAC field has stressed the importance of self learning in building control systems and has encouraged further studies in the integration of optimal control and other advanced techniques into the formulation of such systems. In this thesis we describe the functional link artificial neural network (FLANN), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with Back propagation (BP) and MLP with modified BP called the emotional BP and Neuro fuzzy approaches for the HVAC System Identification. The thesis describes different architectures together with learning algorithms to build neural network based nonlinear system identification schemes such as Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network, Functional Link Artificial Neural Network (FLANN) and ANFIS structures. In the case of MLP used as an identifier, different structures with regard to hidden layer selection and nodes in each layer have been considered. It may be noted that difficulty lies in choosing the number of hidden layers for achieving a correct topology of MLP neural identifier. To overcome this, in the FLANN <b>identifier</b> <b>hidden</b> layers are not required whereas the input is expanded by using trigonometric polynomials i. e. with cos(nπu) and sin(nπu), for n= 0, 1, 2,…. The above ANN structures MLP, FLANN and Neuro-fuzzy (ANFIS Model) have been extensively studied. ...|$|R
