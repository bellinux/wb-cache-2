40|$|Regional {{policy is}} one of the most {{important}} EU policies. Large amounts of resources used for support programmes automatically put forward the question of their effectiveness and efficiency. These aspects can be examined both from macro and micro perspectives. In this article we focus on one aspect of inefficiency – "deadweight". This effect occurs if public subsidy is spent on activities that would have happened even without these resources. We examine the effect on selected projects for small and medium-sized enterprises in the Czech and Slovak Republics. The article consists of four parts. First we discuss theoretical background for using the subsidies as development tool. Then we look more closely on the definition of <b>deadweight</b> <b>effect</b> and previous studies analyzing it. In the methodology part we discuss different approaches how to measure this effect and introduce methodology in our research. We also discuss potential problems with interpretation of the results and in the final part we present the results of our research and some policy implications. We found out that the <b>deadweight</b> <b>effect</b> is quite substantial and represents more than 35 % of public subsidies. The project characteristics itself (type of project, amount of budget) has the highest significance for the <b>deadweight</b> <b>effect.</b> The <b>deadweight</b> <b>effect</b> is higher for investments projects compared to the support of education or employment. The probability of the <b>deadweight</b> <b>effect</b> is also decreasing with the total amount of subsidies...|$|E
30|$|The {{indirect}} <b>deadweight</b> <b>effect</b> {{lowers the}} cost-effectiveness of ALMPs. It {{refers to the}} resources of the policy that go to beneficiaries who would have achieved the objective of the policy even in its absence. For example, it reflects the amount of hiring subsidies that are paid for hiring workers who would be hired even without the subsidy. While not completely avoidable, it can be minimized by concrete targeting of workers, for example those with the lowest exit rates out of unemployment.|$|E
40|$|The {{existence}} of {{economies of scale}} requires different interpretations of the welfare effect of protection on the industry from conventional analyses. This paper finds that the Australian automotive industry has economies of scale, and carries out relevant welfare analysis of tariff. Using the fully modified Phillips-Hansen method, the paper estimates long-run elasticities and changes in consumer and producer surplus by tariffs. With the presence of economies of scale, it is reported that the net <b>deadweight</b> <b>effect</b> of tariffs is relatively small, while the redistribution effects of tariffs are substantial. Also, {{it is found that}} the argument that tariffs protect domestic employment is not plausible in the Australian automotive case, due to the {{existence of}} economies of scale.

30|$|The study further {{contributes}} {{new insights}} {{to the discussion}} about potential <b>deadweight</b> <b>effects</b> generally associated with start-up subsidies. To identify <b>deadweight</b> <b>effects</b> two conditions have to be fulfilled. First, the decision to become self-employed must be independent from the subsidy and second, the subsidy must have {{no impact on the}} success or failure of the business. Mainly due to lack of data, the second condition has not been given much attention in the literature so far. Now with the data at hand we are able to shed light on both conditions in case of GZ. Consistent with previous findings, a large share of the supported individuals (47  %) indeed reports that they would have started a business even without the GZ. However, at the same time those individuals report that they consider the subsidy as crucial for having survived the start-up period. Taking the second condition into account the group which is potentially affected by <b>deadweight</b> <b>effects</b> reduces from initially 47 to 19  %. Although we are not able to draw definite conclusions from descriptive evidence, the results at least indicate that <b>deadweight</b> <b>effects</b> exist to a smaller extent than previously assumed.|$|R
30|$|Summing up, in {{contrast}} to ALMPs aiming at generating incentives for employment retention, these aiming at employment creation, due to their strong transition, screening and competition effects, have generally proven to be more cost-effective and suitable to provide labor market losers with incentives to adapt and work, especially in recoveries. This targeting, which is desirable from a social perspective, also limits cost-ineffective <b>deadweight</b> <b>effects.</b>|$|R

There is evidence that publicly supported companies have {{a higher level of}} investment activities and labour demand than other companies. There is, however, also evidence for <b>deadweight</b> <b>effects.</b> On the contrary, only slight changes—if any—can be observed in wages, productivity and added value due to public funding.|$|R
40|$|In the {{evaluation}} of investment subsidies one of the critical issues concerns the assessment of deadweight, that is, {{the degree to which}} projects would have been carried out without grant assistance. With the increasing restrictions on and cuts in subsidies for investment projects in the EU countries maximisation {{of the impact of the}} public resources that remain can be achieved through their allocation for projects with minimum deadweight. This paper studies the profile of subsidised zero deadweight investment projects – projects that would be abandoned without public subsidies – in Finland. The empirical analysis is conducted using micro level data on investment projects by private sector firms. The data set comprises 3, 423 projects that were granted public investment subsidies between 2001 and 2003. Our results show that the likelihood of zero deadweight is significantly dependent on the characteristics of the subsidised firm, the characteristics of the investment project and the location of the subsidised firm.

40|$|In april 2000, the Belgian federal {{government}} launched a special labor market program, whose prominent characteristic was the obligation {{for companies to}} occupy in their labor force a certain quota of young people. Based on a sample of more 100, 000 young Walloon job seekers (Wallonia is the French-speaking region of Belgium), {{the aim of this}} paper is to evaluate whether or not this program has really improved the youth insertion in the labour market, compared to what would have prevailed in the absence of the program. The effect of the program is evaluated through discrete duration models, and estimated by ‘difference in differences’, looking at the individual trajectory on the labor market of young job seekers, before and after the setting up of the program, for the program target group and for a control group. The empirical results show that the program had a modest positive effect for mid-skilled job seekers, but very little effect for unskilled job seekers. On the other hand, as it could be expected, a strong <b>deadweight</b> <b>effect</b> is observed for the skilled young job seekers. Peer reviewe...|$|E
30|$|Early {{quantitative}} {{research on the}} effectiveness of subsidization on the subsidized was based on PSM methods, using similar unemployed persons as a comparison group. This approach estimates a mix of two effects: The effect on the hiring decision of a firm and the effect on labour market outcomes once the hiring has taken place. Thus – in spite of a careful choice of comparison persons – estimated effects may be partly composed of <b>deadweight</b> <b>effects.</b>|$|R

At the same time, increases in the employability of participants through transition and indirectly screening effects are also potentially large.

30|$|Several studies {{attempt to}} take {{potential}} <b>deadweight</b> <b>effects</b> into account. A first approach is to investigate the impact of hiring subsidies on the labour market outcomes of formerly unemployed persons, conditional on taking up a job. Thus, suitable comparison persons are chosen by PSM {{from a group of}} (formerly unemployed) unsubsidized workers. The underlying idea is that subsidized workers {{might have been able to}} find a job without the help of a subsidy, too (thus allowing for deadweight loss), but that the outcome of their employment relationship would have been different. In this sense a lower bound on the effect of subsidies is estimated as the effect of the subsidy on the hiring decision is ignored.|$|R
40|$|We {{estimate}} {{the effects of}} hiring subsidies for older workers on transitions from unemployment to employment in Germany. Using a natural experiment, our first set of estimates {{is based on a}} legal change extending the group of eligible unemployed persons. A subsequent legal change in the opposite direction is used to validate these results. Our data cover the population of unemployed jobseekers in Germany and was specifically made available for our purposes from administrative data. Consistent support for an employment effect of hiring subsidies can only be found for women in East Germany. Concerning other population groups, firms 4 hiring behavior is hardly influenced by the program and hiring subsidies mainly lead to <b>deadweight</b> <b>effects...</b>|$|R
30|$|Displacement effects, i.e., trained {{workers are}} hired and {{therefore}} existing employees are fired, are only likely if the training content would {{be superior to}} on-the-job experience, which {{should be expected to}} be the opposite. Reviewed evidence by Calmfors et al. (2001) confirms that labor market training programs do not create significant displacement effects. They might though entail sizeable deadweight costs if they finance private training of workers who would have been trained also in absence of this measure. The high cost of these programs often leads to cream-skimming-effects, and by chosing unemployed workers with a higher employment probability <b>deadweight</b> <b>effects</b> are thereby further increased 142. As with all ALMPs, targeting plays a crucial role in enabling cost-effectiveness, and detailed rules should minimize caseworkers’ leeway.|$|R
30|$|Subject {{to these}} limitations, {{training}} measures are generally {{found to have}} a positive impact on employment. However, these are not evident immediately after a training program, but take time to manifest themselves. They also tend to be small or insignificant for men and for programmes delivering basic education, while on-the-job training appears to perform best. Public-sector job creation programmes have mostly produced negative labour-market effects (based on assessments after the program has ended). Evidence on private-sector employment subsidies does not give a strong indication either way, with some studies finding positive and others negative effects (displacement/substitution as well as <b>deadweight</b> <b>effects</b> can be very large, although appropriate targeting can reduce these costs). Results are also not conclusive for self-employment support and start-up incentives as there are few evaluations (and take-up tends to be very low).|$|R
30|$|Wage {{subsidies}} {{are an important}} instrument of German labor market policies, thus evaluation results are of interest to labor market politicians and administrators. We find {{no significant differences in}} daily wages between subsidized and similar unsubsidized workers, but (initially) subsidized employment relationships are of on average longer duration than similar unsubsidized ones. Furthermore, initially subsidized workers subsequently have generally higher employment rates that result in significantly higher cumulated wages during the time frame investigated. Additional fiscal cost-benefit-analyses suggest that subsidization might thus be self-financing in the longer run. All in all, the results imply that wage subsides have the potential to integrate hard-to-place individuals into the labor market for a longer period than could have been expected without subsidization. Nonetheless, the use of subsidies has to be carefully arranged and supervised: First, the impact of the instrument could diminish if the scale of the program would be extended. Second, positive direct effects on treated persons do not imply that subsidies reduce overall unemployment. Third, the knowledge on the size of <b>deadweight</b> <b>effects</b> — a subsidized worker would have been hired without the help of a subsidy, too — is still scarce.|$|R
30|$|Why do firms use hiring subsidies? Hartmann (2004) {{conducted}} a {{comprehensive study of}} the importance {{of a wide range of}} wage subsidy variants for firms and their hiring behaviour. Case studies showed that flexibility requirements and uncertainty about their labour demand in the longer run particularly deterred firms from using subsidies (p. 51  f.). Based on a firm survey related to 3, 500 subsidized hires, Hartmann found that the main integration problem of hard-to-place workers were ascribed (not observed) productivity deficits (p. 147). Moreover, regarding hiring subsidies, firms answered that they would have hired around 40 to 60 per cent of subsidized persons without receiving the subsidy (p. 93). This share is smaller for workers with severe obstacles to reintegration. However, as firms retrospectively assessed their subsidized workers and not before hiring them these figures cannot directly be interpreted as <b>deadweight</b> <b>effects.</b> Hartmann’s results were reinforced by later findings (Brussig et al. 2008; Brussig and Schwarzkopf 2011). These studies also showed that for the most part, employers took the initiative and negotiated with the local labour agency over a subsidy for hiring a particular unemployed worker.|$|R
30|$|Summary While most of {{the studies}} find {{pronounced}} positive employment and wage effects of wage subsidies, an obvious caveat of wage subsidy programs is the high likelihood of <b>deadweight</b> <b>effects</b> arising from employers hiring youth with a wage subsidy even though they would have hired the youth without. This is generally difficult to measure and none of the empirical studies addresses this problem. A further issue {{to be taken into account}} is the problem of worker substitution, resulting in a zero-sum game, when workers eligible for the subsidy are hired at the expense of un-eligible but substitutable workers (e.g., unemployed below 25 years vs. older than 25 years). Riley and Young (2001) and Van Reenen (2004) assess the magnitude of substitution effects in context of the NDYP in the UK and find little to no evidence of substitution of different age groups. However, as not all youth participating in the NDYP took part in the wage subsidy program, this evidence may not be transferable to more intensive uses of subsidies. Unfortunately, we are unaware of any study addressing the magnitude of the substitution effect of wage subsidies directly.|$|R
40|$|Public {{subsidies}} {{in support}} of new firm foundation {{are among the most}} frequently used instruments of industrial policy in the Euro zone. This paper analyses their effectiveness and efficiency vis- 0 -vis some features of the overall process of industry dynamics in Italian manufacturing. To this end, the survival and growth patterns of new small firms are investigated using a unique dataset on electrical and electronic engineering in Italy. As regards survival, our results confirm the findings of other studies, namely that the hazard rates are particularly high {{in the early stages of}} firm's life cycle. As far as growth is concerned, the study's main finding is that Gibrat's Law fails to hold in the years immediately following start-up, when smaller firms must 'rush' in order to achieve a size large enough to enhance their likelihood of survival; conversely, in later stages of firm's life cycle the Law cannot be rejected. These results radically question the use of subsidies as an optimal policy for the support of new entries, since the subsidy brings about a major bias in the process of market selection (including substitution and <b>deadweight</b> <b>effects)</b> and hampers the post-entry scale adjustment of newborn firms...|$|R
50|$|Swales is a {{coauthor}} {{of an alternative}} approach to the minimum wage submitted to the European Commission. This provides incentives for a minimum wage without mandating it, by using tax breaks per employee to reduce the value added tax paid by employers. The report of the team's modelling states that this would not only increase employment levels but also increase GDP, i.e. it would reverse any unemployment and <b>deadweight</b> loss <b>effects</b> of a mandated minimum wage, acting as a Pigovian subsidy.|$|R
30|$|Calmfors (1994) also {{discusses}} {{at which}} point in the unemployment spell workers should be targeted, since a later targeting reduces <b>deadweight</b> and locking-in <b>effects,</b> {{while at the same}} time this implies stronger skill attrition and more discouragement on part of the workers due to longer unemployment duration.|$|R
30|$|A second {{approach}} tackling <b>deadweight</b> <b>effects</b> {{is instead}} {{concerned with the}} effects of eligibility to participate in a scheme on the labour market prospects of the eligible population. If no effect of schemes on the labour market prospects of the eligible population is found, deadweight loss might be one explanation. Schuenemann et al. (2011) evaluated the BHI scheme (see Section 3.1) for long-term unemployed people, which was in place until 2002. Using data for the period 2000 to 2006, the authors locally estimated the impact of the programme becoming available at the eligibility threshold of 12  months unemployment duration using a regression discontinuity design in differences: The group of eligible people comprises all individuals with at least 12  months of unemployment, whereas the control group consists of all unemployed individuals with at least 11  months of unemployment duration. Furthermore, they conducted a comparison with a period when the programme had already been abolished. Their estimates suggest no significant effects of the subsidy on exit rates out of unemployment, on employment stability, or on employment rates. Results are, however, to effects at the threshold. Moreover, other programmes – like the main hiring subsidy variant (or also job creation schemes) – were available as substitutes for the BHI programme. Thus non-eligibility or the abolition of the BHI programme did not necessarily mean that the control group received less subsidization.|$|R
30|$|The {{promotion}} of self-employment {{as part of}} {{active labour market policy}} ranks {{as one of the most}} important support schemes in Germany. The main idea is to grant unemployed individuals financial support to start their own business and therefore to escape unemployment. For this purpose two schemes provided financial support to the unemployed until 2006, the bridging allowance (“Überbrückungsgeld”) and the start-up subsidy (“Existenzgründungszuschuss”). Although both programs have been shown to be very effective, the German government replaced both schemes by one single program, the new start-up subsidy (“Gründungszuschuss”, GZ) in August 2006, mainly to reduce bureaucratic burden. This study aims at providing descriptive evidence on participant’s structure of the new instrument in comparison to the former programs. Moreover, we shed light on business survival, income situation of founders and job creation by the new businesses. Results show that new program (GZ) supports a smaller range of unemployed individuals than initially subsidized by the former two schemes. However, we do not find indication that individuals exhaust their unemployment benefit entitlement before entering the program. With respect to sustainability we find that 75 – 84 % of subsidized businesses are still self-employed 19 months after start-up and household income can be considered to secure the livelihood. Finally, with the data at hand we are able to contribute new insights to the discussion about potential <b>deadweight</b> <b>effects</b> associated with business subsidies. We show that those effects indeed exist but to a smaller extent than previously assumed.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} endogenous {{on-the-job training}} in the job creation and destruction model of the search and matching type by Garc-P 9 rez and Osuna (Dual labour markets and the tenure distribution: Reducing severance pay or introducing a single contract, 2014). The objective is to compare the effects of subsidizing permanent job creation with that of reducing the severance cost gap between permanent contracts (PCs) and temporary contracts (TCs) as a strategy to reduce labour market duality between PCs and TCs. The 2006 and 2012 Spanish labour market reforms are used as a benchmark. The results point to fact that subsidizing permanent job creation {{may not be the}} best option from a fiscal point of view to reduce labour market segmentation between PCs and TCs. In particular, the results of introducing the subsidized "entrepreneurs' permanent contract" (EPC) in the 2012 labour market reform may have involved substantial <b>deadweight</b> <b>effects.</b> In fact, the reduction of the severance cost gap to a number close to 15 days of wages per year of service (p. y. o. s.) may generate the same effects, provided dismissals for objective reasons are effectively made easier to justify and firms make use of that option instead of agreeing to an indemnity closer to the amount paid for unfair dismissals. Finally, the model also shows the relevance of designing appropriate penalties for those firms that do not comply with the obligations that subsidies involve...|$|R

30|$|When all jobs {{subject to}} STW would be {{suppressed}} {{in the absence}} of STW and all job losers would become unemployed, one would expect the sum of the coefficients on the interaction terms between output growth and take-up to approach one. However, this is unlikely to be the case in practice for several reasons. First, STW is a form of work-sharing and, consequently, not all jobs subject to STW are at risk. It is more appropriate, therefore, to focus on the full-time equivalent of the number of STW participants. Assuming an average reduction in working time of about 10 %, as suggested by Hijzen and Venn (2010), one would expect the sum of the coefficients on the interaction terms between output growth and take-up to approach 0.25. Second, not all jobs supported by STW, even when expressed in full-time equivalents, might be suppressed {{in the absence of}} STW due to the role of <b>deadweight</b> <b>effects.</b> Third, not all workers that would have lost their job in the absence of STW would have become unemployed. Some might have found another job quickly, whereas others might have decided to leave the labour force. Assuming that the generosity of STW and unemployment benefits is similar as well as the duration of STW and unemployment, one would expect the fiscal balance associated with STW to be negative. While the first assumption seems reasonable (see Hijzen and Venn, 2010), this is less obvious for the second. The fiscal balance of STW may turn positive if the expected duration of unemployment exceeds that of STW.|$|R
30|$|Thereby, the {{resulting}} deadweight costs {{can be expected}} to be smaller – evidence for Germany by Bernhard et al. (2008 b) places it at 20 - 30 %.

40|$|Motivated by the {{historically}} poor productivity performance of Northern Ireland firms and the longstanding productivity gap with the UK, {{the aim of}} this thesis is to examine, through the use of firm-level data, how exporting, innovation and public financial assistance impact on firm productivity growth. These particular activities are investigated due to the continued policy focus on their link to productivity growth and the theoretical claims of a direct positive relationship. In order to undertake these analyses a newly constructed dataset is used which links together cross-sectional and longitudinal data over the 1998 - 2008 period from the Annual Business Survey, the Manufacturing Sales and Export Survey; the Community Innovation Survey and Invest NI Selective Financial Assistance (SFA) payment data. Econometric methodologies are employed to estimate each of the relationships with regards to productivity growth, making use in particular of Heckman selection techniques and propensity score matching to take account of critical issues of endogeneity and selection bias. The results show that more productive firms self-select into exporting but there is no resulting productivity effect from starting to export; contesting the argument for learning-by-exporting. Product innovation is also found to have no impact on productivity growth over a four year period but there is evidence of a negative process innovation impact, likely to reflect temporary learning effects. Finally SFA assistance, including the amount of the payment, is found to have no short term impact on productivity growth suggesting substantial <b>deadweight</b> <b>effects</b> and/or targeting of inefficient firms. The results provide partial evidence as to why Northern Ireland has failed to narrow the productivity gap {{with the rest of the}} UK.

30|$|One {{of the key}} {{problems}} encountered {{are large}} deadweight 7 losses (subsidising jobs {{which would have been}} created anyway) as well as substitution effects (hiring subsidised workers instead of non-subsidised ones, with no net employment effect). Evaluations of wage subsidies in Australia, Belgium, Ireland and the Netherlands have suggested combined <b>deadweight</b> and substitution <b>effects</b> amounting to around 90 % (Martin 2000).

We evaluate the employment and <b>deadweight</b> loss <b>effects</b> of observed employers' contributions imposed by labor laws (health insurance, training, and taxes) as well as of observed workers' deductions (social security, and income tax). We find that non-wage labor costs reduce employment by 17 % for white-collars and by 53 % for blue-collars, with associated deadweight losses of 10 % and 35 % of total contributions, respectively. Since most firms undercomply with mandated employers' and workers contributions, we find that full compliance would imply employment losses of 4 % for white-collars and 12 % for blue-collars, with respective associated deadweight losses of 2 % and 6 %.

40|$|At {{present it}} is hardly {{worthwhile}} for social assistance recipients to take up employment. The earned income is deducted almost entirely from the social assistance benefits, {{with the result that}} any possible increases in the available income are relatively small. The existing social assistance regulation consequently contains hardly any incentives to work and is often criticised in this respect. Various reform approaches therefore propose a reduction in the rate of deduction. In this way it is possible - following the concept of negative income tax - to achieve an increase in available income and thus boost the attractiveness of taking up work. One of the reform approaches was brought into the debate by the Federal Ministry for Health (BMG). The wages top-up proposed in this favours in particular households with children and employment subject to social security payments. The consequences of this proposal for the labour market and the social assistance agencies are determined taking as an example the state of Saxony-Anhalt. The expected labour supply reactions of social assistance recipients is estimated {{with the aid of a}} TOBIT model and on the basis of data from the labour market monitor for Saxony-Anhalt. From this it is possible to determine the expected fiscal consequences for the social assistance agencies. In this respect it is necessary to consider the groups of unemployed and employed social assistance recipients as well as the potential new entrants to the social assistance scheme. The expansion of the labour supply associated with the reform is rather small in quantitative terms. Only 2. 4 % of the unemployed social assistance recipients are expected to take up a job. That is also where the savings effects of the reform proposal arise, provided that no restrictions occur in the capacity of the labour market to absorb these individuals. The analysis shows that by extending the limits of what can be earned in addition to social assistance considerable additional expenditure is caused as a result of <b>deadweight</b> <b>effects</b> which on the whole might exceed the savings.

30|$|Even if the {{positive}} employment {{effects on the}} one side and significant <b>deadweight</b> and displacement <b>effects</b> on the other side outweigh each other, implying no increase of total employment, hiring subsidies may still be desirable 94. By redistributing employment incentives to the disadvantaged, strengthening their attachment to the labor market, and thereby reducing long-term unemployment, they increase labor market flows and reduce labor market persistence and enable a more equitable distribution of unemployment 95. Thereby, hiring subsidies can be a significant countercyclical labor market stabilizer in normal times to avoid increases of long-term unemployment and detachments from the labor market 96.|$|R
30|$|ALMPs {{providing}} {{incentives for}} retaining employment via subsidies to employers or work sharing schemes that aim to support or increase labor demand and, thereby, prevent {{an increase in}} unemployment due to a fall of economic activity. The OECD (2010) argues that these measures aim at preventing inefficient separations of workers {{who would have been}} retained in the longer-run {{in the absence of a}} temporary reduction in demand. Furthermore, the authors attribute to these measures the potential not only to raise efficiency but also equity by more equally distributing the cost of the crisis among the workforce 45. Nonetheless, <b>deadweight</b> and substitution <b>effects</b> might be very substantial for these measures since they target all employed workers of a specific skill, industry or area. Calmfors (1994), Marx (2001) and Martin and Grubb (2001) review evaluations for the OECD and summarize that <b>deadweight</b> and substitution <b>effects</b> undo between 42 to 93 percent of the direct employment effect of wage subsidies, with general subsidies at the higher end 46. Studies on Sweden put the value of deadweight, on average, at 60 % 47, and more recent evidence from Betcherman et al. (2010) reveals between 27 % and 78 % of deadweight depening on the design. Neumark (2013) surveys the evidence from the US and finds deadweight costs between 67 % and 96 %, and recent evidence for Germany by Boockmann et al. (2012) shows that deadweight costs fully absorb positive employment effects. Another recent study by Betcherman et al. (2010) clearly shows the importance of targeting in this respect: Turkish wage subsidies were subject to deadweight costs of 27 % or 78 % depending on design. Marx (2001) reviews various studies also generating substitution and displacement costs between 20 % and 50 %.|$|R
40|$|Since 1986 the Federal Employment Services {{has used}} the {{so-called}} 'bridging allowance' to support previously unemployed people in setting up their own businesses. This allowance is intended to guarantee the social security and subsistence of the person setting up the business (and the members of his/her family) during the start-up phase, until the young enterprise has consolidated - at least to a reasonable degree. In general such assistance programmes are brought into being {{in order to create}} an alternative to unemployment in particular for qualified unemployed people - this alternative being selfemployment. This is intended to have positive effects for the labour market in two respects. Firstly the person setting up the business eases the strain on the unemployment insurance scheme with his/her step into self-employment. Secondly the newly established businesses may - if they are successful - result in further employment impulses and thus make an additional contribution to combating unemployment. In the last three years alone {{about a quarter of a}} million previously unemployed people have set up their own businesses with the help of the bridging allowance. Not least the annual finance volume of some one billion Marks with which the Federal Employment Services have supported those setting up the businesses is a reason to examine the utilisation of these financial resources and at the same time to make a comprehensive evaluation of the assistance instrument. In the past decade the assistance programme, which has in the meantime been improved and made more convenient for those receiving the allowance, has already been scientifically examined by the Institute for Employment Research at the Federal Employment Services. The current research project follows people who became self-employed in the years 1994 / 1995 with the help of the Employment Office. The objective of the study is to obtain in particular information concerning the whereabouts of those who received the allowance, about additional employment impulses coming from the assisted business start-ups, about the (net) effect the assistance has had on the labour market as well as about the determinants of success. The provisional appraisal of the bridging allowance so far is positive. About three years after setting up businesses a good 70 % of those who received the bridging allowance are still selfemployed. A further 5 % still do the work for which they received financial assistance, but as a secondary activity. On the whole at present there is an average of one employee for every person who originally received assistance to start up a business. Although it is still too early to regard the consolidation phase of the new enterprises as completed, anyone who survives the first three years has taken a major step in setting up a permanent self-employed business. This is also confirmed by the cautiously optimistic estimations of the future by the vast majority of those who remained in self-employment. As regards the net effects of the support programme on the labour market or any effect on the economy as a whole, it is not yet possible to make any adequately sound estimations with the present level of knowledge. It can, however, be shown that the success of the measure is impaired only slightly by <b>deadweight</b> <b>effects.</b> A large part of the resources is obviously used in agreement with the objectives.

30|$|First, {{the micro}} {{literature}} {{tells us that}} the composition of ALMPs matters in terms of {{what works and what does}} not, as do very practical issues of programme design and implementation. Second, the macro literature confirms that the composition of ALMPs matters for the outcomes but so does the scale of public investment in them. Both micro and macro studies suggest that ALMPs are not a magic bullet in terms of lowering unemployment. Even when they are effective, the net impacts are not large once account is taken of <b>deadweight</b> and displacement <b>effects.</b> Third, the country case studies highlight the important role that cost-effective ALMPs play in an activation strategy but show that others factors matter too if the strategy is to be successful. In particular, it is necessary to take account of the potentially important interactions between UI/UA benefit systems and the intensity of activation, especially if the former are relatively generous. In the latter case, it is vital to monitor and control tightly the job-search activity of benefit recipients in order to maintain work incentives.|$|R
