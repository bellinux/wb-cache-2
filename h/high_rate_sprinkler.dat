40|$|Sprinkler systems allow a {{considerable}} reduction of fire risk in buildings. Unfortunately, sprinklers are not fail-safe technical systems. Relatively <b>high</b> <b>rates</b> of <b>sprinkler</b> failures evoke {{the problem of}} reliability. A {{solution to this problem}} is considered from several viewpoints. The diversity of sprinklers' failure modes is the first challenge for estimating reliability (failure probability). It is found that the use of the available data for estimation is problematic. The second challenge is that the published data is insufficiently described to allow a verification of its relevance to the specific case of failure probability estimation. It is suggested to apply the published data with partial relevance to Bayesian inference about failure probabilities. The data is used for developing prior distributions of the unknown values of the probabilities. Bayesian inference is carried out on the basis of binomial distribution used to model the operation of sprinklers on demand basis. A problem of aging and a possible increase in failure probability in the course of sprinkler service is shortly discussed.   Article in English </div...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Development and {{implementation}} of site-specific sprinkler irrigation management has been limited {{due to the lack}} of variable <b>rate</b> <b>sprinklers.</b> Thirty-two prototype variable <b>rate</b> <b>sprinklers</b> were constructed and field tested on a three-span linear-move irrigation system. An algorithm was developed for a distributed control network to allow each sprinkler to be individually controlled in groups of six or seven along the linear-move lateral. Water application uniformity was monitored over a 36 % to 100 % range in application rate. Measured application uniformity equaled or exceeded 90 %. Variable rate nitrogen application was monitored over a 1. 1 -ha area. Measured nitrogen application rate was within 4 % of the target application rate. Results indicate that the prototype variable <b>rate</b> <b>sprinkler</b> and control system allows water and chemical application to vary over a 36 % to 100 % range in application rate with minimal effect on water application uniformity...|$|R
40|$|Summary: A 3 -span linear-move {{irrigation}} system {{was equipped with}} 32 prototype variable <b>rate</b> <b>sprinklers.</b> Water application uniformity was measured over a 2. 7 X range in application rate. The measured application uniformity was 90 % or greater for all water application rates. Variable rate nitrogen application was evaluated on a 1. 1 ha area. Variable rate nitrogen application was within 4 % of target application. The variable <b>rate</b> <b>sprinkler</b> allows variable <b>rate</b> water application with minimal effect on water application uniformity.

40|$|Due to {{the rapid}} {{depletion}} of water resources, water must be used more efficiently in agriculture to maintain current levels of yield in irrigated areas. The efficiency of irrigation systems can be increased by adjusting {{the amount of water}} applied to specific conditions of soil and crop, which may vary in a field. Taking into account spatial and temporal variability, it is evident that an equipment capable of providing different irrigation levels is necessary to meet the water requirement of the soil. This work aims to develop and evaluate a flow <b>rate</b> <b>sprinkler</b> to be used in center pivots or linear moving irrigation systems, with potential for utilization in irrigation scheduling. A prototype was developed by duplicating its calibrations, and discharge coefficient adjustment was carried out in the laboratory. To predict the flow rate, a successful model that represented the operation of the flow <b>rate</b> <b>sprinkler</b> was established. The calibration of the flow <b>rate</b> <b>sprinkler</b> prototype showed satisfactory statistical and technical results. Automation of the prototype was achieved by driving a step motor using communication from the parallel port of a microcomputer, which was controlled by a software developed for this purpose. The results were satisfactory and technically feasible.

40|$|ABSTRACT. A {{variable}} flow <b>rate</b> <b>sprinkler</b> applicable to center pivot and lateral–move irrigation systems was constructed and {{tested in the}} laboratory. Sprinkler nozzle size was reduced a fixed amount using a retractable concentric pin in the nozzle bore. Cycling insertion of the concentric pin in the sprinkler nozzle bore provided a time – averaged {{variable flow}} rate over a range of 36 % to 100 % for the nozzle sizes tested. The application pattern radius of the sprinkler tested was reduced approximately 15 % under variable flow conditions. Sprinkler drop size distribution was also reduced by engagement of the pin in the sprinkler nozzle bore. Measured flow rates compared well with theoretical flow rates below 28 L/min (7. 4 gpm). Results from laboratory testing indicate the variable flow <b>rate</b> <b>sprinkler</b> could potentially be used for site–specific irrigation management with center pivot and lateral–move irrigation systems...|$|R
40|$|Abstract More than 20 {{years of}} private and public {{research}} on site-specific variable <b>rate</b> <b>sprinkler</b> irrigation (SS-VRI) technology on self-propelled center pivot and linear move irrigation systems has resulted in limited commercial adoption of the technology.

Docu-mented and proven water conservation strategies using site-specific irrigation are quite limited. Marginal costs associ-ated with site-specific technologies are high. Although sales of SS-VRI are increasing, they are primarily being used for eliminating irrigation and chemigation on non-cropped areas of a field or for land application of liquid agricultural and municipal wastes.
