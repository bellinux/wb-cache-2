Cycle guards help alleviate this tendency, and low height Brookland aeroscreens that replace the windscreen help improve top end speed.

50|$|The {{expected}} {{challenge from}} Alan Newton in his Elfin MS7-Repco Holden (the same car that Elfin Sports Cars founder Garrie Cooper {{had used to}} win the 1975 Championship) came to a premature end during the first lap of the second heat at the opening round at Calder. Sitting in second behind Clearihan going down Calder's back straight, the cars throttle jammed open going into the braking area and Newton veered left, running at high speed across the infield until hitting a small rise which saw the Elfin literally fly across the track (it was airborne for approximately 20 metres) before landing and hitting the guardrail at undiminished speed. Newton survived the crash {{with nothing more than}} a busted knee and broken ankle (later during the race Newton was shown by race broadcaster Channel 7 sitting up and talking to medical staff as he was being placed into an ambulance). Although the Elfin suffered heavy damage in the crash, it was later repaired though it took no further part in the championship. Another possible challenger, Terry Hook and his 5.0 litre, ex-Guy Edwards Lola T610 Chevrolet did not contest any races in the championship. Hook's Lola first appeared at Surfers Paradise for Round 2 but Hook became concerned about the car's <b>front</b> <b>end</b> <b>lifting</b> at high speed and the car was not raced.

Various methods have been implemented in standard-fiber and polarization-maintaining (PM) -fiber <b>front</b> <b>ends</b> to suppress the FM-to-AM modulation. To analyze the modulation in the <b>front</b> <b>end,</b> a theoretical model is established and detailed simulations carried out that show that the polarizing (PZ) fiber, whose fast axis has a large loss, can successfully suppress the modulation. Moreover, {{the stability of the}} FM-to-AM modulation can be improved, which is important for the <b>front</b> <b>end</b> to obtain a stable output. To verify the model, a PZ fiber <b>front</b> <b>end</b> is constructed experimentally.

40|$|Should {{management}} control the <b>front</b> <b>end</b> of innovation in companies? And if so, how? This thesis examines {{the use of}} {{management control}} in the <b>front</b> <b>end</b> of innovation, how the different management control mechanisms are associated with <b>front</b> <b>end</b> performance, and how technology and market uncertainty influence this relationship. The <b>front</b> <b>end</b> of innovation is generally regarded as the most troublesome phase of the innovation process {{and at the same}} time as one of the greatest opportunities to improve the overall innovation capability of a company. The <b>front</b> <b>end</b> of innovation has been characterized as a highly uncertain and creative phase, thereby requiring considerable amounts of freedom and independence for those executing <b>front</b> <b>end</b> activities. However, a certain amount of control is necessary to secure the effective use of resources and the achievement of the company's strategic goals. The current findings on management control and its influence on performance in a new product development context in general are conflicting. For example, while many authors argue that behavioral control kills creativity, others emphasize the advantages of improved communication and coordination created by process formalization. Some authors stress the importance of setting specific and challenging strategic goals for development work, yet other articles indicate this inhibits creativity and learning. One challenge in interpreting the conflicting results of existing management control research in a new product development context is the fact that most studies treat the <b>front</b> <b>end</b> of innovation simultaneously with product development projects, thereby averaging the totally different characteristics of these two innovation phases. Studies investigating management control in the <b>front</b> <b>end</b> of innovation are still scarce. This theoretical gap is the focus of this thesis. This study develops a framework for management control in the <b>front</b> <b>end</b> of innovation and tests hypotheses on the relationship between different management control mechanisms and <b>front</b> <b>end</b> performance. Management control is covered through seven variables: input control, <b>front</b> <b>end</b> process formalization, outcome-based rewarding, strategic vision, informal communication, participative planning, and intrinsic task motivation. Product concept superiority and strategic renewal are used as <b>front</b> <b>end</b> performance indicators, reflecting both the short-term and long-term development needs of the organization. The influence of technology and market uncertainty as potential moderators on the control mechanism-performance relationship is investigated in relation to <b>front</b> <b>end</b> process formalization and outcome-based rewarding. Data from the <b>front</b> <b>end</b> phase of 133 new product development projects from different large and medium-sized Finnish companies have been collected and analyzed. A factor model was used to test the validity of the management control framework and a linear regression analysis used for hypothesis testing. The results show that management control mechanisms are associated with performance in different manners depending on the performance variable used. <b>Front</b> <b>end</b> process formalization, strategic vision, and intrinsic task motivation were positively associated with product concept superiority. No association was found between input control, outcome-based rewarding, informal communication, participative planning, and product concept superiority. The results show that input control and intrinsic task motivation were positively associated with strategic renewal in the <b>front</b> <b>end</b> of innovation. No association existed between <b>front</b> <b>end</b> process formalization, outcome-based rewarding, informal communication, participative planning, and strategic renewal. Three significant moderating relationships were found in the study: Market uncertainty positively moderates the positive association between <b>front</b> <b>end</b> process formalization and product concept superiority; Technology uncertainty negatively moderates the relationship between <b>front</b> <b>end</b> process formalization and strategic renewal, i. e. under high technology uncertainty, <b>front</b> <b>end</b> process formalization is negatively related to strategic renewal; Technology uncertainty also negatively moderates the relationship between outcome-based rewarding and strategic renewal, i. e. under high technology uncertainty, outcome-based rewarding is negatively related to strategic renewal. This study contributes to management control literature by making management control in the <b>front</b> <b>end</b> of innovation the focal point - an area which is still barely touched in management control theory. The findings contribute to the body of knowledge of <b>front</b> <b>end</b> management by showing that management should be actively involved in the <b>front</b> <b>end</b> of innovation and by providing evidence of the importance of this phase on a firm's dynamic capabilities. This thesis contributes to contingency theory also by demonstrating how both market uncertainty and technology uncertainty moderate the association between management control mechanisms and <b>front</b> <b>end</b> performance. The findings have practical implications for management as they show certain mechanisms lead to effective control in the <b>front</b> <b>end</b> of innovation...|$|R
