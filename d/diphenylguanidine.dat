The surface area of carbon 	samples was proportional to weight loss under condition of a fixed activating temperature. 	The rate constant of hydrogen peroxide decomposition and the adsorption 	amounts of <b>diphenylguanidine</b> and benzoic acid increased with increasing the surface 	area of the carbon samples under condition of the fixed temperature.

Little work has been done, however, on directly quantifying reagent adsorption, certainly under industrial process conditions. The use of a novel surface analysis technique, Headspace Analysis Gas-phase Infrared Spectroscopy (HAGIS), is suggested for quantification of adsorbed reagents in mineral processing. As a first exercise, a test system of xanthate adsorption onto lead sulphide minerals was studied. A survey of possible calibration standards (pure xanthate, a synthetic lead-xanthate, galena (PbS) and a lead sulphide ore conditioned with xanthate) resulted in linear curves for all four cases. The quantification of isopropyl xanthate adsorption onto batch flotation products (concentrate and tail) {{was used to determine}} that ore standards gave the most accurate results. The technique was also tested for quantification of adsorbed amines. Two collectors, dodecylamine and <b>diphenylguanidine,</b> and a depressant, triethylenetetramine, were studied. A common calibration curve was prepared using <b>diphenylguanidine</b> adsorbed on Inco matte. Results show that the HAGIS technique can easily be used to quantify adsorbed amines. It is concluded that the HAGIS technique is a powerful new tool for the quantitative determination of adsorbed reagents. The xanthate study showed the use of ores as standards produces the best calibration. The amine study introduced the possibility of analyzing reagent mixtures...|$|E

Comparing DTP with <b>diphenylguanidine</b> (DPG), DTP is more reactive and gives lower reversion leading to a lower amount required for vulcanization and better aging properties. An increase of chemically bound rubber content accompanied with a lowered Payne effect is obtained when secondary accelerator is used. A potential coupling ability of DTP can be postulated.

These currents drop sharply at potentials where tetrabutylammonium ions are desorbed, these potentials being - 1. 60, - 1. 66, - 1. 72, and - 1. 79 V versus the saturated calomel electrode (SCE) at tetrabutyla-mmonium concentrations of 0. 1, 0. 25, 1, and 5 mM, respectively. Indications are that tetraethylammonium ions at a concentration of 50 mM are desorbed at a potential {{of the order of}} - 1. 9 V (versus SCE).

40|$|An {{investigation}} of the applicability of megacycle-frequency oscillators to following reactions between Lewis acids and bases was initiated with the following objectives : (1) quantitative determination of Lewis acids and bases by titration, (2) evaluation of reaction stoichiometry, and (3) measurement of relative base strength of Lewis bases {{with respect to a}} given Lewis acid. The Lewis acid, aluminum chloride, has been titrated with nitrogen bases in acetonitrile as solvent with an accuracy of 0. 5 to 4 %, which compares favorably with that attainable by other techniques for following Lewis acid-base reactions. The method is convenient, rapid and sensitive; commercially available equipment can be used. In titrations involving electrical conductance, the megacycle-frequency technique appears to be more rapid and more sensitive than conventional conductometry. The shapes of the titration curves (positions of inflection) give information regarding the species forming during the course of reaction. It was thus shown that aluminum chloride forms soluble AB adducts and insoluble AB 2 adducts in acetonitrile with pyridine, quinoline, p-toluidine, dimethylaniline, <b>diphenylguanidine</b> and tri-n-butylamine; diphenylamine forms only a soluble AB adduct. The relative degree of ionization of the various adducts, including that of aluminum chloride with the solvent, can be estimated...|$|E
40|$|The rubber {{formulation}} plays {{a significant}} role in the properties of NR compounds filled with silica. In this work, the influences of various silicas, silane coupling agents and <b>diphenylguanidine</b> (DPG) on the properties of compounds and vulcanizates, i. e. cure characteristics, Mooney viscosity, flocculation kinetics, bound rubber content, Payne effect, tan δ at 60 °C, tensile and tear properties are investigated. The results demonstrate that compound viscosity and curing behavior, as well as vulcanizate properties of the silica-filled NR are much improved by incorporating silane coupling agents. Bis-triethoxysilylpropyltetrasulfide (TESPT) clearly gives better overall properties than the disulfide-based silane (TESPD), except for scorch safety. DPG acts as a synergist to sulfenamide primary accelerators, as well as activator for the silanization reaction. Highly dispersible (HD) silicas can significantly enhance the degree of dispersion, and so lead to higher filler-rubber interaction. As a consequence, the HD silicas provide better dynamic and mechanical properties for filled NR vulcanizates compared to conventional (CV) counterparts. The optimal quantities of both, silane coupling agent and DPG, required in the formulation are correlated to the cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) specific surface area of the silicas. Furthermore, the results reveal that the silica structure as characterized by the dibutylphthalate (DBP) adsorption also strongly influences the reinforcing efficienc...|$|E

The transition metal compounds used in this work can be divided into two groups: (i) metal carbonyls and (ii) metal halides. The metal carbonyls group consists of [M(CO) (_ 5) L] (M = Mn, L = Br; M = Cr, Mo, W, L = CO), [Mo(Cl) L(CO) (_ 3) ] (L = Ƞ-C(_ 5) H(_ 5)) and [MoL(CO) (_ 3) ][BF(_ 4) ] (L = Ƞ-C(_ 7) H(_ 7)), and the metal halide group consists of MCl(_ 2) (M = Pd, Pt), MLCl(_ 2) (M = Pd and L = C(_ 8) H(_ 12)), K(_ 2) MCl(_ 4) (M = Pd, Pt) and WCl(_ 4). Studies have involved two substituted guanidines, 1, 2, 3 -triphenylguanidine and syn- 1, 2 - <b>diphenylguanidine</b> and the Uthiated derivative of 1, 2, 3 -triphenylguanidine. The reactions were undertaken using a variety of conditions. The type of solvent, temperature and molar ratio are important parameters, particularly for the complexes of manganese.

40|$|Surface {{migration}} kinetics {{of chemical}} additives in vulcanized natural rubber compounds were studied as function of ingredient loading. Rubber sheets were compounded {{according to a}} 212 - 8 fractional factorial design of experiment, where ingredients were treated as factors varied at two levels of loading. Amount of migrated additives in surface of rubber sheets was monitored through time at ambient conditions. The maximum amount and estimated rate of additive migration were determined from weight loss kinetic curves. Attenuated total reflection–Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy and optical microscopy were used to characterize the chemical structure and surface morphology of sheet specimens during additive migration. ANOVA results showed that increased loading of reclaimed rubber, CaCO 3, and paraffin wax signif icantly decreased {{the maximum amount of}} additive migration; by contrast, increased loading of used oil, asphalt, and mercaptobenzothiazole disulphide (MBTS) increased the maximum amount. Increased loading of sulfur, <b>diphenylguanidine</b> (DPG), and paraffin wax significantly decreased the additive migration rate; increased loading of used oil, asphalt, and stearic acid elicited an opposite effect. Comparison of ATRFTIR spectra of migrated and cleaned rubber surfaces showed signif icant variation in intensity of specif ic absorbance bands that are also present in infrared spectra of migrating chemicals.

40|$|Background: In the Department of Occupational and Environmental Dermatology {{there has}} been an {{increase}} in the inflow of patients, working as surgical nurses or surgeons. They have been referred due to presumed occupational contact dermatitis. Results from investigated patients have in part been presented previously, where the investigation has shownmultiple contact allergies caused by their occupational use of gloves. Allergens such as <b>diphenylguanidine</b> were found in the gloves and contact allergies to their rubber gloves were found. Many of the patients have been working for decades in their present occupation, but the hand dermatitis had often been present for less than a year. Objectives: To present a follow-up of patientswith hand dermatitis due to gloves. Methods: A follow-up of the patients and a structure for the investigation of the individual patient are given. Results: The cases will be presented with their contact allergies, howtheinvestigation isperformedandtheoutcomeof theprevention by avoiding gloves containing the allergens diagnosed in the individual patients. Conclusions: For health care personnel hand hygiene and the wearing of protective gloves are mandatory. Our findings indicate that the increased need to use rubber gloves {{and at the same time}} the exclusion of latex gloves give rise to new contact allergies which are clinically relevant. In the investigation, and the advice given to the patients, several factors have to be taken into consideration, including the fast change of glove material. The cases indicate the importance of close cooperation between chemists and dermatologists and the possibility to perform chemical analysis.

40|$|Background: For {{health care}} personnelhandhygieneandwearing {{appropriate}} protective gloves are compulsory. We have noticed {{an increase of}} hand eczema caused by contact allergy from rubber chemicals such as <b>diphenylguanidine</b> (DPG) in synthetic rubber gloves used by surgeons and surgical nurses. The exposure time to surgical gloves {{as well as the}} number of gloves used per day vary. Furthermore surgery very often includes the use of skin disinfectants before glove donning. Objectives: Does the exposure time influence the amount of DPG released from the gloves? Does the exposure of skin disinfectants before glove donning influence the release of DPG? Methods: Using synthetic sweat, the amount of DPG released from the inside of the gloves at different timeswas measured by HPLC. The remaining extractable DPG was estimated by washing the inside of the gloves with ethanol (50 % in water) for 10 min. The amount of DPG found on the hands exposed to 3 ml skin disinfectant allowed to dry prior to glove donning was compared to the amount found on unexposed hands. After wearing gloves for 60 min the handswerewashedwith ethanol and the amount of DPG recovered was analysed with HPLC. Results: After 10, 30, 60 and 180 min approximately 73 %, 79 %, 82 %, 87 % of the total amount of DPG was released. For all comparisons the amount of DPG released was higher on the hand exposed to disinfectants compared with the unexposed hand. Conclusions: A comparatively short exposure time to gloves (10 min) implies a substantial exposure to DPG. Thus, repeated usage of glovesmight enhance skin exposure to this rubber chemical. Skin disinfectants does increase the amount of DPG released from the gloves. Thus, possibly the components of the disinfectant remaining on the skin or some othermechanism add to the exposure to DPG...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, silica {{has become}} one of the most {{important}} fillers used in tire tread compounds due to its contribution to a better environment. Silica is capable of not only reducing the rolling resistance but also improving the wet skid resistance of tires, compared to carbon black as a filler. However, silica-filled compounds provide many difficulties during rubber processing, because of the polarity difference between silica and polymer. To overcome these polarity differences a bi-functional silane coupling agent is generally used. A typical silane coupling agent is bis-(triethoxysilylpropyl) tetrasulfide (TESPT). The silane chemistry during rubber processing is very complicated. Basically, from a processing point of view, two coupling reactions take place via TESPT. The first reaction is a coupling reaction between the TESPT molecule and the silica surface, the so-called silanization reaction. For this reaction hydrolysis of TESPT is required. The second reaction is silane-rubber coupling, supposed to happen only during the vulcanization stage. However, it is well known that TESPT acts as a sulfur donor during rubber processing. Therefore, premature crosslinking or scorch may take place at excess temperatures in the mixing stage already. All these reactions can take place simultaneously during silica rubber processing, and therefore the reinforcing mechanism of silica is much more complicated than that of carbon black. <b>Diphenylguanidine</b> (DPG) greatly contributes to the physical properties of silica filled rubber. DPG acts as a secondary accelerator but also as silanization accelerator. In addition, DPG is capable of interacting with the silica surface. Therefore, DPG also affects the reinforcement effect of silica in rubber. DPG is subject to toxic concerns and has a negative influence on rubber-metal adhesion. Therefore, in the future DPG-alternatives will be required. The first objective of the present thesis was to understand the reinforcing mechanism of different types of silica in rubber. Especially, the focus was on the bound rubber layer between silica and polymer, which significantly contributes to the physical properties of silica filled rubber. The second objective was to unravel the role of DPG played in silica-reinforced tire rubbers and the search for less toxic or environmentally friendly alternatives...|$|E
