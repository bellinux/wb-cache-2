40|$|Abstract Background In recent years, the {{completion}} of the Human Genome Project and other rapid advances in genomics have led to increasing anticipation of an era of <b>genomic</b> and personalized <b>medicine,</b> in which an individual's health is optimized through the use of all available patient data, including data on the individual's genome and its downstream products. <b>Genomic</b> and personalized <b>medicine</b> could transform healthcare systems and catalyze significant reductions in morbidity, mortality, and overall healthcare costs. Discussion Critical to the achievement of more efficient and effective healthcare enabled by genomics is the establishment of a robust, nationwide clinical decision support infrastructure that assists clinicians in their use of genomic assays to guide disease prevention, diagnosis, and therapy. Requisite components of this infrastructure include the standardized representation of genomic and non-genomic patient data across health information systems; centrally managed repositories of computer-processable medical knowledge; and standardized approaches for applying these knowledge resources against patient data to generate and deliver patient-specific care recommendations. Here, we provide recommendations for establishing a national decision support infrastructure for <b>genomic</b> and personalized <b>medicine</b> that fulfills these needs, leverages existing resources, and is aligned with the Roadmap for National Action on Clinical Decision Support commissioned by the U. S. Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology. Critical to the establishment of this infrastructure will be strong leadership and substantial funding from the federal government. Summary A national clinical decision support infrastructure will be required for reaping the full benefits of <b>genomic</b> and personalized <b>medicine.</b> Essential components of this infrastructure include standards for data representation; centrally managed knowledge repositories; and standardized approaches for leveraging these knowledge repositories to generate patient-specific care recommendations at the point of care. </p...|$|R

Building upon that research and upon participant observations with specific sports-related DNA tests purchased from four direct-to-consumer companies in 2011 and broader personal genomics (PGx) services, this anthropological, legal, and ethical (ALE) discussion highlights fundamental issues that must be addressed by those developing personal <b>genomic</b> sports <b>medicine</b> programs, either independently or through collaborations with commercial providers. For example, the vulnerability of student-athletes creates a number of issues that require careful, deliberate consideration. More broadly, however, this ALE discussion highlights potential sports-related implications (that ultimately might mitigate or, conversely, exacerbate racial disparities among athletes) of whole exome/genome sequencing conducted by biomedical researchers and clinicians for non-sports purposes. For example, the possibility that exome/genome sequencing of individuals who are considered to be non-patients, asymptomatic, normal, etc. will reveal the presence of variants of unknown significance in any one of the genes associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), long QT syndrome (LQTS), Marfan’s syndrome, and other conditions is not inconsequential, and how this information is reported, interpreted, and used may ultimately prevent the individual from participation in competitive sports. Due to the distribution of genetic diversity that reflects our evolutionary and demographic history (including the discernible effects of restricted gene flow and genetic drift associated with cultural constructs of race) and in recognition of previous policies for “leveling” the playing field in competitive sports based on “natural” athletic abilities, preliminary recommendations are provided to discourage genetic segregation of sports and to develop best practice guidelines for <b>genomic</b> sports <b>medicine</b> programs that will facilitate player success, promote player safety, and avoid genetic discrimination within and beyond the program...|$|R

40|$|Development of drug {{delivery}} systems to achieve site-specific delivery or prolonged retention in the circulation has attracted attention, because {{new types of}} drugs {{are expected to be}} created with advances in life science and biotechnology such as the Human Genome Project. We have tried to develop a new administration route for drug targeting to the liver, since drug administration by the intravenous and oral routes makes it difficult to achieve a local site of action in the liver. Although direct application to the liver surface should result in local drug distribution, drug absorption from the liver surface has not been reported in the literature. Therefore we analyzed the absorption mechanism of several organic anions and dextrans with different molecular weights as model drugs, after application to the rat liver surface in vivo, employing a cylindrical diffusion cell. Every compound appeared gradually in the plasma, followed by excretion into the bile and/or urine, indicating the possibility of drug absorption from the liver surface. A specific transport system might not be involved in the absorption process from the liver surface, because the effect of dose and transport inhibitors on the absorption was not recognized. In addition, molecular weight was found to be a determining factor in absorption from the liver surface. The targeting efficacy was considerably enhanced by application to the liver surface, as compared with intravenous administration. Moreover, we have identified important physicochemical and pharmaceutical factors determining the absorption rate of a drug from the liver surface for clinical use. Consequently, drug application to the liver surface could improve availability in the desired site of a new drug such as bioactive compounds and <b>genomic</b> <b>medicines,</b> by combination with appropriate chemical and pharmaceutical formulation modifications...|$|R

The local models are interpretable in terms of similarity of their sparsity patterns. The cost function is convex, and thus has a globally optimal solution.

30|$|Next-generation {{sequencing}} (NGS) is revolutionizing {{the way of}} genomic-scale biological research, and {{its effects}} are starting to translate into the clinic. In this sense, the comprehensive sequencing of the genome, epigenome and transcriptomes of cancers and corresponding “normal” (germ-line) DNA are heralding the start of personalized medical genomics. The promise of truly personalized medicine and individualized treatments is certainly appealing, however, several issues must be resolved before NGS will be adopted as a routine application in the clinic and for patients. Among such issues are the lack of integrated data, the need for relevant methodologies and research frameworks, and the clinical complexities of genome-based diagnostics and therapeutics. In personalized <b>genomic</b> <b>medicines,</b> pharmacogenomics involves the study of analyzing the individual variations in drug response; pharmacogenetics involves the analysis of genetic variation in drug metabolism. Contemporary studies increasingly involve pathway and network analyses that include both pharmacokinetics, i.e. factors that influence the concentration of a drug reaching its target, and pharmacodynamics, i.e. factors associated with the drug target, as well as genome-wide association studies (GWAS) approaches. In regard to the technology foundations, high-throughput tools for nucleic acid characterization provide the means to conduct comprehensive analyses of all alterations in a patient’s genome. Together with the rapid developments in human genomics, these disciplines move towards a system-based translational interface in pathophysiology, bringing genomic studies into the clinic. This further leads to the identification of new targets and novel biomarkers for both diagnostics and therapeutics. To translate biomarker- and NGS-technology-based research into clinical practice, diagnostics is key. The goal is a tailored approach to treatment based on the molecular analysis of genes, proteins, and metabolites. Yet, although this approach has generated much excitement, only a few personalized-medicine tests have achieved high levels of clinical adoption and are mostly {{in the field of}} oncology. To better understand the challenges to the development and acceptance of personalized medicine it is important to analyze the current technologies and complement this information with a (micro)economic view on the broad stakeholder issues in “P 4 medicine”, which is predictive, personalized, preventive, and participatory medicine.|$|R
