"Leandro Bisiach {{began in}} his native town of Casale Monferrato, in 1886, and {{immediately}} transferred himself to Milan where, as student of Riccardo Antoniazzi, thanks to Antoniazzi's maestro Enrico Ceruti (1803-1883) and of his teacher, Claudio Storioni, he could claim {{more than just an}} imaginary affiliation with the great Cremonese school. In fact Storioni had been a student of Carlo Bergonzi, the only true custodian of the secrets of Stradivarius. We must say that Leandro Bisiach honoured his significant inheritance, which in actuality was not only symbolic. By one of those tricks of fortune that make one suspect the hand of destiny, Leandro senior had come into possession of tools and models that had belonged to the various old Cremonese masters. This seems strange enough in itself, a curious coincidence. In reality, he had much greater luck; among the documents and papers obtained by Fanny Rossi, the widow of Giacomo Stradivari (1822-1901), Bisiach found the most precious and <b>extraordinary</b> <b>item</b> imaginable, that is, the formula for the varnish of the great Antonio Stradivarius from 1704.In truth, it was not the only varnish of the eighteenth century that Bisiach could use. He had at hand another formula used first by Giovan Battista Ceruti (1755-1817) and later by two other generations of the same family. In addition, in 1929 he gained possession of a collection of documents attributed to Stradivarius, among which he found another formula that dated back to the great Cremonese."

40|$|Changes in {{accounting}} and financial reporting are inevitable (Hall & Aldridge, 2007). Hall and Aldridge (2007) stated that this happens because in preparing periodic financial statements, companies must take estimates and judgements to allocate costs and revenues. Accounting disclosure especially {{notification of information}} on a business unit has become a widely studied area in the West (Benston, 1973). The issue of accounting change has been subject to considerable research attention during the 1990 s. The main interest has been directed at exploring changes in: accounting systems, accounting techniques, the accountancy profession, {{and the role of}} an accountant (for general references to such work, see Chua (1995) and Bhimani (1996)). In Malaysia, the accounting disclosure has yet to be studied vigorously (Hamzah, 1983). This however, does not mean that this issue is unimportant, and lately a lot of researchers have been researching on the report of <b>extraordinary</b> <b>item</b> (Shamsul & Nor Izah, 2000), cash flow statement (Ng, 1999), empirical studies on accounting and disclosure (Ng, 1998), uses of financial report (Azhar, 1999) and information that are needed by consumer and voluntary disclosures by the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE), currently name as Bursa Malaysia listed companies (Tan et al., 1990). Disclosure is a means whereby information regarding a business unit can be conveyed. Based on this information, interested parties and potential investors will be informed of {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} a particular business unit, in terms of profits made, and/or whether the management of the business unit act in a manner which can be of benefit to the potential investors (Hamzah, 1983). Consistency in the accounting policy as stated in the Malaysian Accounting Standards Board (MASB) 1 is one of the accounting doctrine, which is the basis of financial planning and presentation. Users should be able to compare and differentiate every company financial statement for a period of time to identify financial position flow, performance, and cash flow. For that matter, the same accounting policy will be used for an accounting period. Changes in the accounting policy need to be done if directed by the law or the MASB, or if the change will give a more accurate result for presenting a situation or transaction in a company’s financial statement (MASB 3). This study is a preliminary study on the accounting disclosure by listed companies on the main board of the KLSE based on their annual financial report. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. The next section provides an overview of accounting change. Section three discusses research methodology, followed by research findings.

40|$|U. S. District Judge Robert R. Merhige Jr. {{approved}} {{late yesterday}} afternoon the final {{terms of the}} agreements settling the uranium contract litigation involving Westinghouse Electric Corp. and Virginia Electric and Power Co. The companies had announced an agreement in principle April 16 to resolve their 4 -year-old dispute that arose when Westinghouse canceled three uranium supply contracts it had with Vepco involving more than 14 million pounds of uranium. As reported previously, Vepco said the settlement provides for the payment of cash, uranium deliveries and goods and services having a present value to the utility of more than 380 million. 2 ̆ 2 This sum {{is equal to the}} value of the uranium contracts under litigation if they had been fully performed by Westinghouse, 2 ̆ 2 Vepco said. The specific terms of the settlement were approved by Vepco 2 ̆ 7 s board of directors several hours before the final order dismissing the case was signed by Merhige. In addition to a cash payment having a present value of 129 million, Vepco will receive 7. 5 million pounds of uranium from Westinghouse between 1980 and 1994 with a present value to the utility of about 130 million. The settlement also stipulates that Vepco may receive cash payments having a present value of up to 48 million from Westinghouse out of any proceeds it might receive if it is successful in its pending antitrust suit against members of the uranium cartel. Westinghouse estimated that the pretax cost of its current and future obligations to Vepco {{as a result of the}} settlement is approximately 202. 2 million. This will be accounted for, the company said, as an <b>extraordinary</b> <b>item</b> in the second quarter. As part of the uranium settlement, the companies also completed their previously announced plans to resolve a dispute over repairs to the steam generators at the Surry power station. Westinghouse had built the turbine generator equipment which Vepco now is having to replace at the plant. 2 ̆ 2 This agreement provides for recovery from Westinghouse of cash and goods and services of over 32 million, 2 ̆ 2 Vepco said. 2 ̆ 2 This is equivalent to about 35 percent of the cost of repairs to the steam generators and turbine generator. 2 ̆ 2 While the turbine generator settlement was less than 100 cents on the dollar, Vepco said Dean William B. Spong Jr. of the College of William and Mary 2 ̆ 7 s law school had found the terms to be fair and equitable to both the utility and to Westinghouse. Spong has served as Merhige 2 ̆ 7 s special settlement negotiator in the uranium contract litigation. With the judge 2 ̆ 7 s signature on the Vepco settlement, six of the 10 individual lawsuits that went to trial in September 1977 have been resolved. The four plaintiffs who have no settled are scheduled to begin the damages phase of their trial Oct. 1. The damages case had been set to start in mid-July, but was postponed for 2 1 / 2 months because of a conflict in Merhige 2 ̆ 7 s schedule. Asked at the conclusion of the hearing about the settlement prospects for Northeast Utilities, Long Island Lighting Co., South Carolina Electric and Gas Co., Spong said he remained hopeful that they could be resolved before the damages trial is scheduled to begin...|$|E

To the extent that stock price reflects the market 2 ̆ 7 s expectation about future earnings, the return predictability of the two components of income should differ when they have different persistence. The study finds that while the profitability of the conventional EP trading rule is significant, it increases substantially when the earnings are defined to be operating income rather than net income before <b>extraordinary</b> <b>items</b> and discontinued operations. Further, the conventional risk factors, including market return and firm size, do not fully explain the profitability of EP trading rule based on operating income.

40|$|Misgivings about dirty surplus {{accounting}} practices derive, in part, from two related concerns. Firstly, {{it has been}} argued that dirty surplus accounting might result in value-relevant items being reported within ‘dirty surplus flows’ rather than within earnings. Secondly, it has been suggested that the low transparency of dirty surplus flows might reduce investors' ability to recognize value-relevant items in a timely fashion.

There is little evidence that other flows excluded from ordinary profit are value-relevant, however.
