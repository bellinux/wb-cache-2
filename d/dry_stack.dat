5000|$|... or SIM is a mortar-less masonry system. This {{new type}} of masonry block uses special {{curvature}} to allow the masonry block to stabilize through self weight when constructed as a panel. The principal practice of this panel is to help dissipate external energy, primarily due to seismic loadings. The basic concept is to generate friction between each element of the panel through movements to dissipate energy. SIM blocks were created by Dr Yuri Totoev from University of Newcastle, first introduced in print in 2011 in the Advance Material Research Journal. This theory was based on principles of <b>dry</b> <b>stack</b> masonry wall construction, where energy dissipation depends significantly on the textural arrangement of the stones. The idea of SIM panel is to improve on the traditional reinforced masonry. The design principal is to allow construction without the requirements of traditional reinforced masonry.|$|E

40|$|A {{new system}} for masonry infill panels is being {{developed}} in the Masonry Research Group at the University of Newcastle. It uses masonry panels made of <b>dry</b> <b>stack</b> semi-interlocking units capable of relative sliding in-plane of a wall and interlocked to prevent relative sliding out-ofplane of a wall. These new panels are suitable for both infill and confined masonry. The major objective for developing this new masonry system {{is to improve the}} earthquake performance and wind resistance of framed structures with masonry panels acting as energy dissipation devices (EDD). An experimental program is being carried out to evaluate the behaviour of different framed masonry panels. It was found in the initial testing program that new panels have significant energy dissipation capacity due to friction between masonry units. For example, a maximum damping ratio of 0. 03 was calculated for a bare RC frame from hysteresis force-displacement curves. This was improved by infilling the frame with the <b>dry</b> <b>stack</b> masonry panel producing a new average damping ratio of 0. 17. Theoretically, based on the coefficient of friction between contacting masonry units, this capacity could be improved even further.

50|$|Tailings do {{not have}} to be stored in ponds or sent as {{slurries}} into oceans, rivers or streams. There is a growing use of the practice of dewatering tailings using vacuum or pressure filters so the tailings can then be stacked. This saves water which potentially reduces the impacts on the environment in terms of a reduction in the potential seepage rates, space used, leaves the tailings in a dense and stable arrangement and eliminates the long-term liability that ponds leave after mining is finished. However although there are potential merits to <b>dry</b> <b>stacked</b> tailings these systems are often cost prohibitive due to increased capital cost to purchase and install the filter systems and the increase in operating costs (generally associated electricity consumption and consumables such as filter cloth) of such systems.|$|R

The failure mode of each prism was determined. Different from the MP_m, the stress-strain relationship of the MP_ds was characterized by an upward concavity at the initial stage. The compression strength of the MP_ds was slightly reduced by 15 %, while the elastic modulus was reduced by over 62 %. In addition, 36 shear-compression tests were carried out under cyclic loads to emphasize the influence of various loads on the shear-compression {{behavior of}} DSM. The results showed that the Mohr-Coulomb friction law adequately represents the failure of dry joints at moderate stress levels, and the varying friction coefficients under different load amplitudes cannot be neglected.

40|$|Masonry {{is one of}} {{the most}} ancient {{construction}} materials in the World. When compared to other civil engineering practices, masonry construction is highly labour intensive, which can affect the quality and productivity adversely. With a view to improving quality and in light of the limited skilled labour in the recent times several innovative masonry construction methods such as the <b>dry</b> <b>stack</b> and the thin bed masonry have been developed. This paper focuses on the thin bed masonry system, which is used in many parts of Europe. Thin bed masonry system utilises thin layer of polymer modified mortars connecting the accurately dimensioned and/or interlockable units. This assembly process has the potential for automated panelised construction system in the industry setting or being adopted in the site using less skilled labour, without sacrificing the quality. This is because unlike the conventional masonry construction, the thin bed technology uses thinner mortar (or glue) layer which can be controlled easily through some novel methods described in this paper. Structurally, reduction in the thickness of the mortar joint has beneficial effects; for example it increases the compressive strength of masonry; in addition polymer added glue mortar enhances lateral load capacity relative to conventional masonry. This paper reviews the details of the recent research outcomes on the structural characteristics and construction practices of thin bed masonry. Finally the suitability of thin bed masonry in developing countries where masonry remains as the most common material for residential building construction is discussed...|$|E

The analysis will follow that described in Attachment 1 and will include a complete water budget analysis for alternative surface cap and bottom-liner/collection-system designs. Daily meteorological data for the HELP simulations will be obtained from historical records for a first-order weather station in Oak Ridge. The physical and hydraulic properties of the ash will be based on previous data for KIF fly ash reported in Attachment 2 unless there is reason to expect there might be significant differences between the two ashes i. e different coal sources or burn processes.

40|$|The {{design and}} {{erection}} of columns in classical Greece and Rome was a deceptively complicated task. Ancient engineers were not {{guided by a}} set of building codes, resulting in several regional design variations. The writer Vitruvius condensed these variations into three archetypes or “orders” defined by proportions based on an arbitrary “module”. The goal of this thesis is to better understand the effect of these proportions on the seismic response of ancient columns through the use of Equivalent Lateral Force Procedure and finite element analysis software. To this end, a parametric study of linearly elastic, free-standing columns with homogeneous material properties was conducted. This study considered five typical columns per classical order. Dynamic analysis showed noticeable effects on natural circular frequency (ωn) and mode of vibration (φn) due to both column order and slenderness ratio. Static analysis showed that the deformed shape and location of maximum stress was similar for all test columns. This newfound understanding was utilized in a case study of the Temple of Antioch ad Cragum front façade. This Corinthian order, pro-style temple: dates back to 1 - 3 rd century AD; is located near modern day Güney Village, Turkey; and is currently being excavated and considered for a partial reconstruction. Dynamic analyses showed that fixed entablature-column connections, similar to ancient clamp connections, cause the frame to act more rigidly as opposed to pinned connections. Static analyses further illustrated the rigidity of the frame with fixed connections as it tended to resist seismic forces as a single rigid body. The pinned connections allowed for columns to more evenly resist seismic forces. This study includes several assumptions in order to limit discussion to the effect of geometric proportions on the seismic behavior of ancient columns. The author has reviewed several studies that have approached the analysis of nonlinear, rigid body motion, but none have fully investigated the relationship between seismic behavior and classical order. This thesis is to serve as a basis for future investigation of this relationship under true <b>dry</b> <b>stack</b> conditions. Advisor: Ece Erdogmu...|$|E
