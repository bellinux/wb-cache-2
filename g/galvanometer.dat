They typically control X and Y directions on Nd:YAG and CO2 laser markers to control the position of the infrared power laser spot. Laser ablation, laser beam machining and wafer dicing are all industrial areas where high-speed mirror <b>galvanometers</b> can be found.|$|R
50|$|The {{direction}} of travel was read by comparing the indications on two independent <b>galvanometers,</b> one for each armature. The <b>galvanometers</b> had to be calibrated with the correct headings, since the voltage was proportional to the sine of the angle. Readings could be impacted by the armature's speed of rotation and by stray magnetic fields.|$|R

25|$|The magnet is held {{to prevent}} it from rotating, while the disc is spun on its axis. The result is that the <b>galvanometer</b> {{registers}} a direct current. The apparatus therefore acts as a generator, variously called the Faraday generator, the Faraday disc, or the homopolar (or unipolar) generator.|$|E
25|$|The first moving-pointer current-detecting {{device was}} the <b>galvanometer</b> in 1820. These {{were used to}} measure {{resistance}} and voltage by using a Wheatstone bridge, and comparing the unknown quantity to a reference voltage or resistance. While useful in the lab, the devices were very slow and impractical in the field. These galvanometers were bulky and delicate.|$|E
25|$|A {{multimeter}} may {{be implemented}} with a <b>galvanometer</b> meter movement, or less {{often with a}} bargraph or simulated pointer such as an LCD or vacuum fluorescent display. Analog multimeters are common; a quality analog instrument will cost {{about the same as}} a DMM. Analog multimeters have the precision and reading accuracy limitations described above, and so are not built to provide the same accuracy as digital instruments.|$|E

25|$|Berger's first {{recording}} device was very rudimentary. He inserted silver wires under the scalps of his patients. These were later replaced by silver foils {{attached to the}} patient's head by rubber bandages. Berger connected these sensors to a Lippmann capillary electrometer, with disappointing results. However, more sophisticated measuring devices, such as the Siemens double-coil recording <b>galvanometer,</b> which displayed electric voltages as small as one ten thousandth of a volt, led to success.|$|E
25|$|A Faraday disk {{can also}} be {{operated}} with neither a <b>galvanometer</b> nor a return path. When the disk spins, the electrons collect along the rim and leave a deficit near the axis (or the other way around). It is possible in principle to measure the distribution of charge, for example, through the electromotive force generated between the rim and the axle (though not necessarily easy). This charge separation will be proportional to the relative rotational velocity between the disk and the magnet.|$|E
50|$|A major {{early use}} for <b>galvanometers</b> was for finding faults in {{telecommunications}} cables. They were superseded in this application {{late in the}} 20th century by time-domain reflectometers.|$|R

25|$|Thomson's {{fears were}} {{realized}} when Whitehouse's apparatus proved insufficiently sensitive {{and had to}} be replaced by Thomson's mirror <b>galvanometer.</b> Whitehouse continued to maintain that it was his equipment that was providing the service and started to engage in desperate measures to remedy some of the problems. He succeeded only in fatally damaging the cable by applying 2,000V. When the cable failed completely Whitehouse was dismissed, though Thomson objected and was reprimanded by the board for his interference. Thomson subsequently regretted that he had acquiesced too readily to many of Whitehouse's proposals and had not challenged him with sufficient energy.|$|E
25|$|Carl Friedrich Gauss and Wilhelm Weber {{built the}} first {{electromagnetic}} telegraph used for regular communication in 1833 in Göttingen, connecting Göttingen Observatory and the Institute of Physics, covering {{a distance of about}} 1km. The setup consisted of a coil that could be moved up and down over the end of two magnetic steel bars. The resulting induction current was transmitted through two wires to the receiver, consisting of a <b>galvanometer.</b> The direction of the current could be reversed by commuting the two wires in a special switch. Therefore, Gauss and Weber chose to encode the alphabet in a binary code, using positive and negative currents as the two states.|$|E
25|$|Beckman married Mabel on June 10, 1925. In 1926 {{the couple}} {{moved back to}} California and Beckman resumed his studies at Caltech. He became {{interested}} in ultraviolet photolysis and worked with his doctoral advisor, Roscoe G. Dickinson, on an instrument to find the energy of ultraviolet light. It worked by shining the ultraviolet light onto a thermocouple, converting the incident heat into electricity, which drove a <b>galvanometer.</b> After receiving a Ph.D. in photochemistry in 1928 for this application of quantum theory to chemical reactions, Beckman was asked to stay on at Caltech as an instructor {{and then as a}} professor. Linus Pauling, another of Roscoe G. Dickinson's graduate students, was also asked to stay on at Caltech.|$|E
50|$|Some <b>galvanometers</b> use a solid pointer on a {{scale to}} show measurements; other very {{sensitive}} types use a miniature mirror and {{a beam of light}} to provide mechanical amplification of low-level signals.|$|R

25|$|Developed by Lord Kelvin, this is {{the most}} {{sensitive}} and accurate of all the mechanical electrometers. The original design uses a light aluminum sector suspended inside a drum cut into four segments. The segments are insulated and connected diagonally in pairs. The charged aluminum sector is attracted to one pair of segments and repelled from the other. The deflection is observed by a beam of light reflected from a small mirror attached to the sector, just as in a <b>galvanometer.</b> The engraving on the right shows a slightly different form of this electrometer, using four flat plates rather than closed segments. The plates can be connected externally in the conventional diagonal way (as shown), or in a different order for specific applications.|$|E
25|$|The meter {{movement}} in a moving pointer analog multimeter is practically always a moving-coil <b>galvanometer</b> of the d'Arsonval type, using either jeweled pivots or taut bands {{to support the}} moving coil. In a basic analog multimeter the current to deflect the coil and pointer is drawn from the circuit being measured; it is usually an advantage to minimize the current drawn from the circuit, which implies delicate mechanisms. The sensitivity of an analog multimeter is given in units of ohms per volt. For example, a very low cost multimeter with a sensitivity of 1000 ohms per volt would draw 1milliampere from a circuit at full scale deflection. More expensive, (and mechanically more delicate) multimeters typically have sensitivities of 20,000 ohms per volt and sometimes higher, with 50,000 ohms per volt (drawing 20microamperes at full scale) being about the upper limit for a portable, general purpose, non-amplified analog multimeter.|$|E
25|$|The board {{insisted that}} Thomson join the 1858 cable-laying expedition, without any {{financial}} compensation, and {{take an active}} part in the project. In return, Thomson secured a trial for his mirror <b>galvanometer,</b> about which the board had been unenthusiastic, alongside Whitehouse's equipment. However, Thomson found the access he was given unsatisfactory and the Agamemnon had to return home following the disastrous storm of June 1858. Back in London, the board was on the point of abandoning the project and mitigating their losses by selling the cable. Thomson, Cyrus West Field and Curtis M. Lampson argued for another attempt and prevailed, Thomson insisting that the technical problems were tractable. Though employed in an advisory capacity, Thomson had, during the voyages, developed a real engineer's instincts and skill at practical problem-solving under pressure, often taking the lead in dealing with emergencies and being unafraid to lend a hand in manual work. A cable was finally completed on 5 August.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In {{this work}} {{we present a}} {{generalized}} theory of <b>galvanometers</b> {{from the point of}} view of the dynamical equations of coils subjected to general (but homogeneous) time varying magnetic fields. We explore new inductive principles for driving and controlling <b>galvanometers</b> (whose modern versions take the form of scanners) and envisage a special frequency shift due to electromechanical coupling terms under the presence of a transversal magnetic field. Such frequency shift can be used to electronically control the resonance frequency of scanners. Numerical simulations are presented for a silicon microscanner.

25|$|Stewart {{measured}} {{radiated power}} with a thermo-pile and sensitive <b>galvanometer</b> read with a microscope. He {{was concerned with}} selective thermal radiation, which he investigated with plates of substances that radiated and absorbed selectively for different qualities of radiation rather than maximally for all qualities of radiation. He discussed the experiments in terms of rays which could be reflected and refracted, and which obeyed the Helmholtz reciprocity principle (though he did not use an eponym for it). He did not in this paper mention that the qualities of the rays might be described by their wavelengths, nor did he use spectrally resolving apparatus such as prisms or diffraction gratings. His work was quantitative within these constraints. He made his measurements in a room temperature environment, and quickly so as to catch his bodies in a condition near the thermal equilibrium {{in which they had}} been prepared by heating to equilibrium with boiling water. His measurements confirmed that substances that emit and absorb selectively respect the principle of selective equality of emission and absorption at thermal equilibrium.|$|E
500|$|The pilot cable {{required}} {{a series of}} prior discoveries and inventions. In 1882, [...] A. R. Sennett patented {{the use of a}} submerged electrical cable to communicate with a ship at a fixed location. Around the same time Charles Stevenson patented a means of navigating ships over an electrically charge cable using a <b>galvanometer.</b> The method became practical when Earl Hanson adapted early vacuum tube circuits to amplify the signal.|$|E
500|$|The {{required}} {{direction of}} current depended on {{the direction in which}} electric current was thought to flow in nerves in the human or animal body. [...] For motor functions, for instance, the flow was taken to be from the centre towards the muscles at the extremities, so artificial electrical stimulation needed {{to be in the same}} direction. [...] For sensory nerves, the opposite applied: flow was from the extremity to the centre, and the positive electrode would be applied to the extremity. [...] This principle was demonstrated by Bird in an experiment with a living frog. [...] A supply of frogs was usually on hand, as they were used in the frog galvanoscope. [...] The electromagnetic <b>galvanometer</b> was available at the time, but frogs' legs were still used by Bird because of their much greater sensitivity to small currents. [...] In the experiment, the frog's leg was almost completely severed from its body, leaving only the sciatic nerve connected, and electric current was then applied from the body to the leg. [...] Convulsions of the leg were seen when the muscle was stimulated. [...] Reversing the current, however, produced no movement of the muscle, merely croaks of pain from the frog. [...] In his lectures, Bird describes many experiments with a similar aim on human sensory organs. [...] In one experiment by Grapengiesser, for instance, electric current is passed through the subject's head from ear to ear, causing a sound to be hallucinated. [...] The ear connected to the positive terminal hears a louder sound than that connected to the negative.|$|E
