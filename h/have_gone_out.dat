25|$|Palestinians are {{barred from}} using Al-Shuhada Street, a {{principal}} commercial thoroughfare.″Those who still live on Shuhada Street can’t enter {{their own homes}} from the street. Some use the rooftops {{to go in and}} out, climbing from one roof to another before issuing into adjacent homes or alleys. Some have cut gaping holes in the walls connecting their homes to other (often deserted) houses and thus pass through these buildings until they can exit into a lane outside or up a flight of stairs to a passageway on top of the old casba market. According to a survey conducted by the human-rights organization B’Tselem in 2007, 42 per cent of the Palestinian population in the city center of Hebron (area H2)—some 1,014 families—have abandoned their homes and moved out, most of them to area H1, now under Palestinian control.″ As a result, about half the Arab shops in H2 <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> of business since 1994.|$|E

25|$|There {{has been}} a {{revolution}} in the island's retail sector since the opening of the Confederation Bridge. Before 1997, big box stores were rare and mostly found in larger centres in the Maritimes such as Halifax, Moncton, or Saint John. Prince Edward Island had a larger number of smaller, family-owned retail stores than other provinces, with few shopping malls and less selection of consumer goods. The opening of the Confederation Bridge was viewed with concern by government and the retail sector alike, as many thought Islanders would use the quicker transportation connection to drive to Moncton for many large-item purchases. While there was a small {{increase in the number of}} off-Island shoppers, the provincial government established a program of encouraging big box retailers to establish in the province. This included the elimination of provincial sales tax on clothing and footwear, resulting in a plethora of chains such as Walmart, Sears, Future Shop, Staples, and The Home Depot building stores on the Island. However, many smaller locally owned stores <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> of business. This is one of the more visible impacts since the opening of the Confederation Bridge.|$|E
25|$|Like {{many other}} codes of football, {{the way to}} score points is to score goals. In Australian Football, {{there are two types}} of scores: a goal and a behind. There are four posts at each end of the ground; the two middle (and taller) posts are the goal posts, and the two outer (and shorter) posts are the behind posts. The area between the goal posts is the goal; kicking the ball between these posts scores a goal which is worth six points. Kicking the ball between a goal and a behind post scores a behind, which {{constitutes}} a single point. A behind is also scored if the ball passes between the goal posts but has not been kicked by the attacking team (e.g., it comes off the hands of either team, or is kicked by the defending team), or if the ball hits or passes directly above the goal post. (If the ball hits the behind post, the ball is considered to <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> of bounds.) A rushed behind (also worth one point) is scored when the defending team deliberately forces the ball between any of the posts. This may occur in pressure situations where a defender decides that it is safer to concede one point to the opposing team rather than risk a goal being scored.|$|E
25|$|In the German-speaking lands, {{groups of}} young people called Sternsinger (star singers) travel from door to door. They are dressed as the three Wise Men, plus the leader {{carrying}} a star, usually of painted wood attached to a broom handle. Often these groups are four girls, or two boys and two girls {{for the benefit of}} singing their songs in four-part harmony, not necessarily three wise men at all. German Lutherans often note in a lighthearted fashion that the Bible never specifies that the Weisen (Magi) were men, or that there were three. The star singers will be offered treats at the homes they visit, but they also solicit donations for worthy causes, such as efforts to end hunger in Africa, organized jointly by the Catholic and Evangelical-Lutheran churches. As a sign of gratitude, the young people then perform the traditional house blessing, by marking the year over the doorway with chalk. In Roman Catholic communities this may be a serious spiritual event with the priest present even today, but among Protestants it is more a tradition, and a part of the German notion of Gemütlichkeit. Usually on the Sunday following Epiphany, these donations are brought into churches. Here all of the children who <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> as star singers, once again in their costumes, form a procession of sometimes dozens of wise men and stars. The German Chancellor and Parliament also receive a visit from the star singers at Epiphany.|$|E

[...] Sonia Murray of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution called the album [...] "more thoughtful" [...] than its predecessor, noting, [...] "What the second album lacks in adventurous {{arrangements}} it more than makes up for in lyrical dominance." [...] The Source observed [...] "growth" [...] from OutKast and Organized Noize, and stated, [...] "Big Boi and Dre <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> of this world into a new dimension of sight, sound and mind".|$|E

Two days after the historic feat, Chamberlain made a guest appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show.|$|E

She added that Hannah would never <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> with Darren willingly, [...] "not even under the influence". She felt Hannah stayed married to Darren to annoy her parents and to get attention. Darren begins scheming with Cindy to scam The Dog. Darren decides to stay married {{to try to get}} The Dog back, so proposes that they do not get their {{marriage}} annulled to Hannah. Dawson said, regarding his plan to scam Hannah, that [...] "Hannah wants an annulment and so does Darren … at first.

500|$|Weiss {{also noted}} {{about the death}} of King Tommen Baratheon, [...] "Meanwhile, while the {{explosion}} is happening, Tommen is alone.

She failed him, and she alone failed him here." [...] Benioff continued about portraying the mindset of Cersei Lannister, saying [...] "I think the idea of Cersei without her children is a pretty terrifying prospect. It was the one thing that really humanized her, you know, her love for her kids. And as much of a monster as she could sometimes be, she was a mother who truly really did love her children, and now those children are gone, and all she's got is power." [...] In a subsequent interview after the episode airing, Weiss stated that Cersei's mindset following the ramifications of this episode will {{play an important role in}} the story for the next season.|$|E
500|$|Reardon and Yeates' friends set up {{a website}} and used social {{networking}} services to help look for her. On 21 December 2010, Yeates' parents and Reardon made a public appeal for her safe return at a police press conference. In another press conference, broadcast live on 23 December 2010 by Sky News and BBC News, Yeates' father David commented on her disappearance: [...] "I think she was abducted after getting home to her flat ... I {{have no idea of}} the circumstances of the abduction because of what was left behind ... I feel sure she would not <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> by herself leaving all these things behind and she was taken away somewhere". Her keys, phone, purse and coat were left behind at her flat. Detectives retrieved a receipt for a pizza, but found no sign of it or of its packaging. Both bottles of cider were found in the flat, one of them partially consumed. As {{there was no evidence of}} forced entry or a struggle, investigators began to examine the possibility that Yeates may have known her abductor.|$|E
