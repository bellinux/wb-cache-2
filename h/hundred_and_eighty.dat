He is one of only two bowlers to have hit ten wickets in a single innings for Derbyshire, a feat he achieved in June 1921, the other being five-time Test cricketer Tommy Mitchell. He was a true tailender batsman, who never averaged above eight with the bat in a single season for Derbyshire, and did not once reach twenty in his last two <b>hundred</b> <b>and</b> <b>eighty</b> first-class innings, a run of batting failures equalled only by Eric Hollies between 1939 and 1954.

25|$|Wiman {{wanted to}} extend the line to Saint George so {{that all of the}} {{branches}} now under the company's control could meet in one place with the ferries to Manhattan. However, there was a problem: over most of the course of the line, it had followed the shore, along the bluffs, where ground had to be made upon to build the road. State laws were not able to grant the right to run a railroad through the property of the United States, and as a result, construction was hindered by the grounds of the lighthouse department just above Tompkinsville. The company, however, secured an act of congress permitting them to push a tunnel through the hill a short distance back from the shore. The grant for the tunnel was surrounded with restrictions that made slow progress inevitable. Construction of the tunnel began in 1885. The tunnel was five <b>hundred</b> <b>and</b> <b>eighty</b> five feet long, and was protected by massive walls of masonry on the sides, and an arch of brick two feet in thickness overhead. It was wide enough to fit two trains side by side at a time. The cost of the project was $190,000. On November 16, 1884, Wiman, James M. Davis, Sir Roderick Cameron, Herman Clark, and Louis de Jonge incorporated the Saint George Improvement Company in order to handle the land and waterfront, which was recently purchased from the estate of George Law. The new company was to handle the building of a new terminal for ferries at Saint George.|$|E

In this study, we analyzed the association of TP 53 Pro 72 Arg polymorphism with squamous cell carcinoma of oral tongue (SCCOT) and esophagus (ESCC) in India. Methods: We assessed the distribution of TP 53 Pro 72 Arg polymorphism in one <b>hundred</b> <b>and</b> fifteen <b>and</b> <b>eighty</b> two SCCOT <b>and</b> ESCC patients, respectively, with respect to one <b>hundred</b> <b>and</b> ten healthy controls from the same population.

Results: Pro 72 allele was significantly enriched in SCCOT patients compared to the healthy control group but neither allele was enriched in ESCC. Interestingly, Pro 72 allele was preferentially mutated in ESCC which was confirmed by analysis of samples heterozygous for Pro 72 Arg. Conclusions: Our study revealed the association of Pro 72 allele with SCCOT suggesting the effect of this polymorphism on SCCOT risk. Preferential mutation of Pro 72 allele exclusively in ESCC indicates the need for further studies to understand the tissue specific effect of p 53 polymorphism...|$|R

The aims {{of this study were}} to investigate domestic accidents among children with regard to prevalence and factors related to childhood injuries in the home. Data were collected through presurvey and survey via an interview by using pretested questionaires during house visits. Three <b>hundreds</b> <b>and</b> <b>eighty</b> children from 250 mothers were involved in this project. The prevalence rate of domestic accidents among children 3 months to � 6 years old was 24. 7 %. Toddlers had a highest prevalence rate of domestic accidents compared to infant and preschools. The most common place of accidents was within the house (84. 1 %) where {{more than half of the}} accident occured in the living room. The commonest type of accidents was physical injury. Falls were the leading cause (80. 9 %), other children sustained laceration and cut (12. 8 %), scalded (4. 8 %) and swallowed an object (2. 1 %). Most lesions were benign. The most common localization of lesion was head (55. 8 %), and lower extrimities (32. 5 %). Household furnitures and contructional features of the house cause most accidents. There were statitiscally signifant difference between domestic accidents and etnic groups (p< 0. 05), level of maternal education (p< 0. 05), type of houses (p< 0. 05), numbers of children age 3 months to � 6 years in the family and mean age of the children (p< 0. 05).

Two <b>hundreds</b> <b>and</b> <b>eighty</b> 21 -d-old male broilers were used in 28 pens of 10 birds per each. The experimental diets consisted of a positive control (PC) diet and six negative control (NC) diets which consisted of two levels of CA (0 and 20 g/Kg) and three levels of phytase (0, 1000 and 4000 U/Kg) in a 2 × 3 factorial arrangement. The PC diet contained 4. 3 g/Kg Pa, but all NC diets contained 1. 5 g/Kg Pa. Results indicated that the birds fed the PC diet had a significantly higher average daily gain (ADG), plasma P and TA, but a lower feed conversion ratio (FCR) than those fed the NC diet. The ADG, FCR and plasma P values in birds fed NC diets supplemented with 4000 U/Kg phytase enzyme (with or without CA) significantly reached those of birds fed the PC diet. But, addition of phytase enzyme at 1000 U/Kg only plus CA to the NC diet could significantly improve FCR and plasma P. A significant interaction was observed between phytase and CA for FCR and plasma P. Although TA values in NC + 1000 U/Kg phytase treatments (with or without CA) were similar to the PC treatment, TA values of NC + 4000 U/Kg phytase treatments (with or without CA) was {{greater than that of}} the PC treatment. Results of this study showed that, in severely limited Pa corn-canola meal-based diets, supplementing 4000 U/Kg phytase or also 1000 U/Kg phytase plus CA will be sufficient to obtain the comparable feed efficiency in broilers to those fed the adequate Pa diet...|$|R
