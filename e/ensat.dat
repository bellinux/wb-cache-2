40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{clinical}} {{course of}} advanced adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is heterogeneous. Our study aimed primarily to refine and make headway in the prognostic stratification of advanced ACC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced <b>ENSAT</b> ACC (stage III or stage IV) at diagnosis registered between 2000 and 2009 in the <b>ENSAT</b> database were enrolled. The primary end point was overall survival (OS). Parameters of potential prognostic relevance were selected. Univariate and multivariate analyses were carried out: model 1 'before surgery'; model 2 'post-surgery'. RESULTS: Four hundred and forty-four patients with advanced <b>ENSAT</b> ACC (stage III: 210; stage IV: 234) were analyzed. After a median follow-up of 55. 2 months, the median OS was 24 months. A modified <b>ENSAT</b> (mENSAT) classification was validated: stage III (invasion of surrounding tissues/organs or the vena renalis/cava) and stage IVa, IVb, IVc (2, 3 or > 3 metastatic organs, including N, respectively).

40|$|Many e-Health {{strategies}} rely on {{the secure}} integration of datasets that have previously resided in isolated locations, but can now in principle be accessed over the Internet. Of paramount importance in the health domain {{is the need for}} the security and privacy of data that is transmitted across these networks. One such collaboration, which spans several specialist centres across France, Germany, Italy and the UK, is <b>ENSAT</b> – the European Network for the Study of Adrenal Tumors. The rarity of the tumors under study means the value of accessing, aggregating and comparing data from many centres is great indeed. However this is especially challenging given that <b>ENSAT</b> require clinical and genomic data to be seamlessly linked, but {{in such a way that}} the information governance, ethics and privacy concerns of the patients and associated stakeholders involved are visibly satisfied. Key to this is the clear separation of clinical and genomic data sets and support for rigorous patient-identity protecting access control. This is especially challenging when such data sets exist across different organisational boundaries. In this paper we describe a prototype solution offering a security-oriented tailored portal supported by a layered encryption-driven linkage technology (VANGUARD) that offers precisely such patient-privacy protecting capabilities. We describe the architecture, implementation and use to date of this facility to support the <b>ENSAT</b> adrenal cancer research network...|$|E
40|$|Objectives Evaluation {{of patient}} {{characteristics}} and mitotane {{use in the}} treatment of adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) over a 4 -year period in Belgium. Material and methods This was a multicentre retrospective review of the outcome of 34 patients treated with mitotane for ACC during the period [01 / 2008 – 12 / 2011] (12 diagnosed before and 22 diagnosed during the study period) and evaluated up to 06 / 2013. Results Patient and tumour characteristics were consistent with those generally described for ACC. Mean age at diagnosis was 46. 5 years, most patients were female (62 %), had functioning ACC (65 %) and advanced tumours (<b>ENSAT</b> stages III or IV: 82 %). Therapeutic mitotane plasma levels (14 – 20 mg/L) were achieved at least once in 70 % of the cohort, after a median of 4 months, and were maintained for more than 2 months in 61 % of evaluable patients. Mitotane-related adverse effects were observed in 66 % of patients, were never serious, and included gastrointestinal, neurological, neuropsychological, hormonal, dermatologic and metabolic effects. Most patients (88 %) discontinued mitotane, mainly due to tumour progression. Multivariate analysis showed that <b>ENSAT</b> stage was a prognostic factor for overall (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS); OS was also influenced independently by achievement of therapeutic mitotane plasma levels for at least two consecutive months. Conclusion Patient and tumour characteristics were consistent with previously published data. OS and DFS were mostly influenced by <b>ENSAT</b> stage at diagnosis. Achieving therapeutic levels of mitotane for at least two consecutive months seemed to positively influence OS, but such levels were not reached or sustained in some patients.

40|$|The {{technologies}} {{and ideas that}} underlie e-Science in providing seamless access to distributed resources is a compelling one and has been applied in many research domains. The clinical domain is one area in particular that, in principle has much {{to be gained from}} e-Science approaches. Until now however it has largely been the case that the practical realization, support and adoption of e-Science solutions in a clinical setting have been fraught by many hurdles. Not least is trust of {{technologies and}} their use in the field as opposed to demonstrator projects with non-real clinical data to prove the merit of e-Science ideas and solutions. The National e-Science Centre (NeSC– www. nesc. ac. uk) at the University of Glasgow have had a large number of clinical projects that have moved from the proof of concept demonstrators through to real systems used by real clinical researchers in real clinical trials and studies. In this paper we focus on the software systems that have been developed to support two major international post-genomic clinical research projects in the area of rare diseases: the European Union 7 th Framework (EuroDSD – www. eurodsd. eu) project and the European Science Foundation (<b>ENSAT</b> – www. <b>ensat.</b> org) project.

40|$|Background: Adrenocortical {{carcinoma}} (ACC) {{is a rare}} tumor with a poor prognosis. Often, {{the physicians}} who first treat patients with ACC have no prior experience with the disease. The aim of our study was to evaluate the quality of medical care for patients with ACC in Germany. Methods: Data from the German ACC registry were analyzed {{with regard to the}} patients’ preoperative diagnostic evaluation, histopathological reporting, and clinical followup. The findings were compared with the recommendations of the European Network for the Study of Adrenal Tumors (<b>ENSAT).</b> Results: Data were analyzed from 387 patients who had been given an initial diagnosis of ACC in the years 1998 to 2009. 21...|$|E
40|$|Context: Adrenocortical cancer (ACC) is an {{aggressive}} tumor with a heterogeneous outcome. Prognostic stratification is difficult even based on tumor stage and Ki 67. Recently integrated genomics {{studies have demonstrated}} that CpG islands hypermethylation is correlated with poor survival. Objective: The goal {{of this study was to}} confirm the prognostic value of CpG islands methylation on an independent cohort. Design: Methylation was measured by methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA). Setting: MS-MLPA was performed in a training cohort of 50 patients with ACC to identify the best set of probes correlating with disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). These outcomes were validated in an independent cohort from 21 <b>ENSAT</b> centers. Patients: The validation cohort included 203 patients (64 % women, median age 50 years, 80 % localized tumors). Main Outcome Measures: DFS and OS. Results: In the training cohort, mean methylation of 4 genes (PAX 5, GSTP 1, PYCARD, PAX 6) was the strongest methylation marker. In the validation cohort, methylation was a significant prognostic factor of DFS (P, 0. 0001) and OS (P, 0. 0001). Methylation, Ki 67, and <b>ENSAT</b> stage were combined inmultivariatemodels. For DFS,methylation (P = 0. 0005) and stage (P, 0. 0001) but not Ki 67 (P = 0. 19) remained highly significant. For OS, methylation (P = 0. 0006), stage (P, 0. 0001), and Ki 67 (P = 0. 024) were independent prognostic factors. Conclusions: Tumor DNA methylation emerges as an independent prognostic factor in ACC. MSMLPA is readily compatible with clinical routine and should enhance our ability for prognostication and precision medicine...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Adrenocortical {{carcinoma}} (ACC) is {{an aggressive}} malignancy {{with a high}} rate of recurrence. Regular post-operative follow-up imaging is necessary, but associated with high radiation exposure and frequent diagnostic ambiguity. Urine steroid metabolomics has recently been introduced as a novel diagnostic tool for the detection of adrenocortical malignancy in patients with adrenal incidentalomas. Here we present the first clinical study assessing the performance of this innovative approach in the context of follow-up after complete (R 0) ACC resection. Patients and methods: We included 166 patients from 13 centres registered with the European Network for the Study of Adrenal Tumours (<b>ENSAT).</b> We selected all patients recorded between 2008 and 2015 fulfilling the following criteria: i) recorded on the <b>ENSAT</b> registry as confirmed adrenocortical carcinoma with R 0 primary tumour resection and ii) availability of at least two postoperative 24 -h urines, one whilst disease-free and the other after recurrence. Twenty-four-hour urines were analysed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, with quantification of 38 distinct steroid metabolites. A machine learning-based computational algorithm was employed to detect ACC recurrence. Results: Twenty-one patients developed 22 ACC recurrences during the study period as documented by serial cross-sectional imaging and biopsy where appropriate. Steroid metabolomics predicted disease recurrence at the time of first abnormal imaging with a sensitivity of 84 % and specificity of 95 %. Adjuvant mitotane in 12 / 21 patients did not affect accuracy. In the subgroup of patients for whom a diagnostic pre-operative 24 -h urine sample was available (n= 7), we were able to accurately detect all cases of recurrence (sensitivity and specificity 100 %). In seven cases, biochemical evidence of disease recurrence pre-dated the first radiological detection by more than 2 months (range 2 – 11 months). Conclusion: Our study provides proof-of-principle evidence suggesting a role for urine steroid metabolomics as a potent diagnostic tool in the follow-up monitoring of ACC...|$|E
40|$|Background: Radical surgery {{provides}} {{the best chance of}} cure for adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), but perioperative surgical care for these patients is yet to be standardized. Methods: A working group appointed jointly by <b>ENSAT</b> and ESES used Delphi methodology to produce evidence-based recommendations for the perioperative surgical care of patients with ACC. Papers were retrieved from electronic databases. Evidence and recommendations were classified according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system, and were discussed until consensus was reached within the group. Results: Twenty-five recommendations for the perioperative surgical care of patients with ACC were formulated. The quality of evidence is low owing to the rarity of the disease and the lack of prospective surgical trials. Multi-institutional prospective cohort studies and prospective RCTs are urgently needed and should be strongly encouraged. Conclusion: The present evidence-based recommendations provide comprehensive advice on the optimal perioperative care for patients undergoing surgery for ACC...|$|E
40|$|Conference: 6 th Congress of the French-Society-of-Stables-Isotopes Location: <b>ENSAT</b> Sch, Ecolab Lab, Toulouse, FRANCE Date: OCT 26 - 29, 2010 International audienceWe {{have used}} a high-precision, easy, {{low-cost}} and rapid method of oxygen isotope analysis applied to various O-bearing matrices, organic and inorganic (sulfates, nitrates and phosphates), whose (18) O/(16) O ratios had already been measured. It was first successfully applied to (18) O analyses of natural and synthetic phosphate samples. The technique uses high-temperature elemental analysis-pyrolysis (EA-pyrolysis) interfaced in continuous-flow mode to an isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) system. Using the same pyrolysis method {{we have been able}} to generate a single calibration curve for all those samples showing pyrolysis efficiencies independent of the type of matrix pyrolysed. We have also investigated this matrix-dependent pyrolysis issue using a newly developed pyrolysis technique involving 'purge-and-trap' chromatography. As previously stated, silver phosphate being a very stable material, weakly hygroscopic and easily synthesized with predictable (18) O/(16) O values, could be considered as a good candidate to become a reference material for the determination of (18) O/(16) O ratios by EA-pyrolysis-IRMS...|$|E
40|$|Background: Clinical {{research}} registries {{are rarely}} driven by data quality assurance. However, {{quality of data}} can have {{a huge impact on}} the performance and outcome of any given trial using registry data. Therefore, data quality assurance procedures for cost reduction and data process improvements have to be implemented in research registries. Hypothesis: This research proposes that web-based data quality feedback can motivate registry users, increase their contributions and ultimately improve the quality of registry data and its (re-) use to support clinical trials; thereby reducing the costs and need for study monitors. Method: To explore causes of low data quality and user motivation, a survey and an assessment of quality indicators in a multicentre clinical setting was performed. Subsequently, a development and evaluation of a web-based feedback framework was conducted. This was explored in the international Niemann-Pick disease registry (INPDR) and two clinical trials associated with the European Network for the Study of Adrenal Tumours (<b>ENSAT).</b> Results: The survey and framework evaluation highlight effectiveness of web-based automated data quality feedback. Case studies showed an increase of data quality within observation time. Conclusion: Centralised data monitoring requires a general framework that can be adjusted for a variety of trials and studies. This research highlights how biomedical research registries have to be designed with focus on data quality and feedback mechanisms. ...|$|E
40|$|Adrenocortical carticnoma (ACC) {{is a rare}} {{malignancy}} with an {{incidence of}} 0. 7 – 2. 0 cases/million habitants/year. The diagnosis of malignancy relies on careful investigations of clinical, biological and imaging features before surgery and pathological examination after tumor removal. Most patients present with steroid hormone excess or abdominal mass effects, but 15 % of patients with ACC is initially diagnosed incidentally. After the diagnosis, {{in order to assess}} the ACC prognosis and establish an adequate basis for treatment decisions different tools are proposed. The stage classification pro¬posed by the European Network for the Study of Adrenal Tumors (<b>ENSAT)</b> is recommended. Pathology reports define the Weiss score, the resection status and the proliferative index, including the mitotic count and the Ki 67 index. As far as the treatment is concerned, in case of tumor limited to the adrenal gland, the complete resection of the tumor is the first option. Most patients benefit from adjuvant mitotane treatment. In metastatic disease, mitotane is the cornerstone of initial treatment, and cytotoxic drugs should be added in case of progression. Recently, the First International Randomised (FIRM-ACT) Trial in metastatic ACC reported the association between mitotane and etoposide/ doxorubicin/cisplatin (EDP) as the new standard in first line treatment of ACC. In last years, new targeted therapies, including the IGF 1 receptor inhibitors, have been investigated, but their efficacy remains limited. Thus, new treatment concepts are urgently needed. The ongoing omic approaches and next-generation sequencing will improve our understanding of the pathogenesis and hopefully will lead to better therapies...|$|E
40|$|Adrenocortical tumors {{comprise}} frequent adenomas (ACA) {{and rare}} carcinomas (ACC). Human cytochrome P 450 2 W 1 (CYP 2 W 1) is highly expressed in some cancers holding {{the potential to}} activate certain drugs into tumor cytotoxins. To investigate the CYP 2 W 1 expression in adrenal samples and its relationship with clinical outcome in ACC. CYP 2 W 1 expression was investigated by qRT-PCR in 13 normal adrenal glands, 32 ACA, 25 ACC, and 9 different non-adrenal normal tissue samples and by immunohistochemistry in 352 specimens (23 normal adrenal glands, 33 ACA, 239 ACC, 67 non-adrenal normal or neoplastic samples). CYP 2 W 1 mRNA expression was absent/low in normal non-adrenal tissues, but high in normal and neoplastic adrenal glands (all P< 0. 01 vs non-adrenal normal tissues). Accordingly, CYP 2 W 1 immunoreactivity was absent/low (H-score 0 - 1) in 72 % of non-adrenal normal tissues, but high (H-score 2 - 3) in 44 % of non-adrenal cancers, in 65 % of normal adrenal glands, in 62 % of ACAs and in 50 % of ACCs (all P< 0. 001 vs non-adrenal normal tissues), being significantly increased in steroid-secreting compared to non-secreting tumors. In ACC patients treated with mitotane only, high CYP 2 W 1 immunoreactivity adjusted for <b>ENSAT</b> stage was associated with longer overall survival and time to progression (P< 0. 05 and P< 0. 01, respectively), and with a better response to therapy both as palliative (response/stable disease in 42 % vs 6 %, P< 0. 01) or adjuvant option (absence of disease recurrence in 69 % vs 45 %, P< 0. 01). CYP 2 W 1 is highly expressed in both normal and neoplastic adrenal glands making it a promising tool for targeted therapy in ACC. Furthermore, CYP 2 W 1 may represent a new predictive marker for the response to mitotane treatment...|$|E
