500|$|Some {{comparisons}} {{have been}} made between the lyrical content of [...] "Homesick" [...] and MercyMe's 2001 single [...] "I Can Only Imagine." [...] David Jenison of CCM Magazine referred to the song as the 'sequel' to [...] "I Can Only Imagine." [...] Regarding these comparisons, Millard said [...] "’I Can Only Imagine’ took the focus off {{of what you are}} going through and was comforting because it put the focus on where they were going... ’Homesick’ is the opposite because it completely addresses us that are left here. I don’t think as a Christian that it’s right for me to say, ‘I wish you could’ve stayed here,’ because truthfully, we’re getting the raw end of the deal <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> believe what we say that heaven is as great as we want it to be. The whole idea is that we’re the ones who have to wait.” Millard has also noted, [...] "The difference with ‘Homesick’ [...] is that it talks about those who are stuck around here after someone passes away. When you lose somebody, you learn what being homesick is really about." ...|$|E

An African proverb says 'Until you unmask it, a masquerade remains a terror'. A war against terror – of any kind – is best achieved through collective efforts. Our modest contributions from our corner of the globe have helped in restoring hope {{to millions of people}} without hope. It has become a lamp among the armament that unmasked the monster HIV, and we shall continue to beam the light of research on all threats to human existence. As part of efforts to end insurgency in Nigeria, the Ambassador of France to Nigeria Jacques Champagne de Labriolle visited Adewole in his office at the University of Ibadan. Adewole described the ambassador's visit as [...] "auspicious and timely in the history of Nigeria." [...] He said [...] "our country must gladly engage the French-speaking countries, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> want to maintain security for the citizenry. I believe that creating a long-term security should be our main concern just as the initiative of our president was so strategic, having recently visited France." ...|$|E

30|$|From very {{different}} directions, the commentaries by Glick Schiller and Favell both suggest that <b>if</b> <b>we</b> have <b>really</b> moved from {{an age of}} migration to an age of mobility, then the choice is not civic integration versus multiculturalism, but some entirely new post-national constellation.|$|R
2500|$|I know it may smack of [...] "enabling" [...] to rabidly anti-smoking Californians, but <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> want to {{keep the}} streets clean of this noxious litter, {{it might be a good}} idea to give smokers (including many foreign tourists) a safe and handy place to dispose of their used cigarettes.|$|E
2500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics, though most critics praised Adam Lambert's performance. Miranda Wicker of TV Fanatic gave the episode a 3 out of 5, signifying moderate reviews, saying {{the return of}} the series post-Cory Monteith [...] "was sure to be a bumpy one. The right amount of pathos needed to be balanced with a healthy dose of moving forward." [...] She then commented positively on Adam Lambert's role as Starchild, saying [...] "Anything that gets more Adam Lambert on my screen is okay by me." [...] MaryAnn Sleasman of TV.com also gave the episode a moderate review, saying [...] "Despite being [...] "the most annoying thing they've ever done" [...] (IDK, Sue, I bet <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> thought about it, we could come up with something way more annoying), [...] "A Katy or a Gaga" [...] was a genuinely fun episode with a Glee PSA that wasn't completely lost in translation for once." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Tumble and Fall", {{the third}} track on Pushing the Senses, {{was chosen as}} its lead single, because their European label Play it Again Sam (PIAS), were getting more {{involved}} with the band, believing the song would be a crossover to make them successful in Europe after touring with Coldplay in 2003. The single became the band's most successful single release since [...] "Buck Rogers", reaching the top five in the UK. Grant claimed that [...] "Tumble and Fall" [...] is a love song, but can be interpreted in any way. In an interview with Feederweb, Grant said of the song: [...] "Again {{this is about the}} ups and downs of life. Its about life in general and how you deal with it. It covers the journey of life and how you have to take the ups with the downs. I wasn’t going to record this song. It took me a long time to finish it, to be happy with it, because the song went through various stages. I wasn’t sure <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> needed a tune like that on the album. But I decided to go to the studio to record an acoustic version just to see what happened and that’s how the song started. It was a completely one take vocal, live with the acoustic guitar and we built everything else around it. It is an acoustic track that grew into what it is now. So that was the only song that we recorded like that on the album, so it is a bit different for that reason and is probably why it has an organic feel to it".|$|E

"Well, we {{need not}} think it over now, Meinik; but <b>if</b> <b>we</b> are <b>really</b> besieged, it is by this way that <b>we</b> must escape, <b>if</b> at all. <b>We</b> must hope that we sha'n't be beset; but <b>if</b> <b>we</b> are, we must try here.

60|$|<b>If</b> <b>we</b> get {{the right}} man he can be of the {{greatest}} possible help. If he's tactful, wise, and courteous, there's no reason why in time he shouldn't attain very considerable influence over the Khedive. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> can <b>really</b> get the Khedive to work honestly and sincerely with us, instead of hampering us by all kinds of secret devices, we can do miracles in this country.|$|R
6000|$|<b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> love God {{and long}} {{to do good}} and work for God, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> love our {{neighbours}} and wish to help them, we shall have no heart to quarrel about how the good is to be done, provided it is done. [...] "Master," [...] said St. John, [...] "we saw one casting out devils in Thy name, and he followeth not us; wilt Thou that we forbid him? And Jesus said, Forbid him not." ...|$|E

6000|$|Yes. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> {{believed}} {{in the kingdom of}} God and Christ; <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> believed that the fate of nations is determined, not by kings, not by conquerors, not by statesmen, not by parliaments, not by the people, but by God; that we, England, the world, are going God's way, and not our own; then we should look hopefully, peacefully, contentedly, on the matters which are too apt now to fret us; for we should say more often than we do, 'It is the Lord: let him do what seemeth to him good.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{are not in}} China, Foo Cha," [...] he said. [...] "I {{have done}} nothing against the law of this country; no man can enter here <b>if</b> <b>we</b> resist. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> are <b>really</b> being watched, it must be by persons in the pay of the Russian. But they can do nothing; it is too late; Knigenstein will be here in half an hour. The thing will be settled then, once and for ever." ...|$|R

60|$|The {{conception}} {{they will}} have of that purpose will necessarily determine their ethical scheme. It follows manifestly that <b>if</b> <b>we</b> do <b>really</b> believe in Almighty God, the more strenuously and successfully we seek in ourselves and His world to understand the order and progress of things, and the more clearly we apprehend His purpose, the more assured and systematic will our ethical basis become.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{do believe}} that," [...] she admitted. [...] "You {{are a very}} clever man, Mr. Fischer, and I think that you {{represent}} all that you claim. Perhaps, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> do negotiate--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh {{how can you}} say that," [...] her visitor demanded, [...] "when {{just what}} we've most been agreed upon so often is the {{practical}} impossibility of making any change? Hasn't it seemed as <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> can't overcome conversational habits so thoroughly formed?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{never did}} it in our family. Father always said that <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> wanted to do right we could find the way." [...] Gregory looked daunted, and then he frowned darkly. [...] "Are you {{provoked}} with me? Do you think what I have said is wrong?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{the very}} thought," [...] said Harry, [...] "that was passing through my own brain when I spoke to you. Yet, somehow, I think I should be uncommonly sorry after all <b>if</b> <b>we</b> were <b>really</b> sent back. There's a queer contradiction, Hammy: we're sorry and happy {{at the same}} time! If I were the skipper now, I would found a {{philosophical}} argument upon it." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{talking about}} the artist's work ethic, Lee has said, [...] "Sometimes I wonder <b>if</b> <b>we</b> ever <b>really</b> improve as artists or if the nirvana derived from {{completing}} a piece blinds us enough to love what we have created {{and move on to}} the next piece. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> could see the work as it is, with years of reflection in the here and now, how many images would end up in the trash rather than on the racks?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 3. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> believe <b>really</b> that Jesus was the Son of God, {{we should}} never believe that {{selfishness}} {{was to be the}} rule of our lives. One sight of Christ upon his cross would tell us that not selfishness, but love, was the likeness of God, that not selfishness, but love, which gives up all that it may do good, was the path to honour and glory, happiness and peace.|$|R
60|$|For {{that will}} happen to us which happens {{to all those who}} have the pure, true, and heroical love. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> love a person, we shall first desire to please them, and {{therefore}} the thought of disobeying and paining them will seem more and more grievous unto us.|$|E
60|$|That, {{one would}} think, was clear. It is {{our duty to}} take St. Paul's words, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> believe them to be inspired, simply as they stand; {{and if we do}} not quite {{understand}} them, to explain them by St. Paul's own words about these matters in other parts of his writings.|$|E
6000|$|She was {{not very}} {{successful}} at accepting his fervor with the air of amused woman of the world, but she sounded reasonably impersonal: [...] "Thank you. Shall we see <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> can get up a new dramatic club? I'll tell you: Come to the house this evening, about eight. I'll ask Miss Mullins to come over, and we'll talk about it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Only when we stop perceiving {{to think}} about what we have seen or heard, only then do we assess its truth-value. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> are <b>really</b> [...] "into" [...] the fiction - [...] "transported", in the psychologists' term - we are, as Immanuel Kant pointed out long ago, [...] "disinterested". We respond aesthetically, without purpose. We don't judge the truth of what we're perceiving, even though <b>if</b> <b>we</b> stop being transported and think about it, we know quite well it's a fiction.|$|R
60|$|The Holy Spirit {{will teach}} us. Must teach us, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> are <b>really</b> to learn {{one word of}} all this in spirit and in truth. But whether the Holy Spirit does teach us, will depend, I fear, very much upon whether we pray for him; and whether we pray for him aright will depend on whether we know who he is, and what he is like; and that, again, the Athanasian Creed will tell us.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now boys, I {{want you}} to fill yourselves up so's {{to be ready for}} hard work in case {{anything}} is to be done when the others get here. Afterwards we'll take a snooze, which is the proper thing to do at {{the middle of the day}} in a hot climate, and then there must be some exploring, for we want to find out <b>if</b> <b>we</b> are <b>really</b> on the island of Cuba." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But are {{you sure}} it's your {{particular}} duty?" [...] suggested Joan. [...] "I'm told you've become a household word both in Germany and France. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> are out to end war and establish the brotherhood of nations, the work you are doing is of more importance than even the killing of Germans. It isn't as if there wouldn't be enough without you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{we might}} help <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> tried, I suppose; {{you know how}} much Happy Dodd did when she once began, and she was only a poor little girl without half the means of doing good which we have," [...] said Anna, glad to discuss the matter, for she had a little plan in her head and wanted to prepare a way for proposing it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let's see <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> {{are free}} to go and come as we choose," [...] said Mark, {{suddenly}} stepping {{to the door and}} trying it. Sure enough it was open. They passed out and went a short distance along the street, in which only a few natives were moving about. These, strange to say, instead of gazing at them in idle curiosity, seemed to regard them with some show of respect.|$|E
2500|$|The day after, I {{asked my}} pilot, a cheerful young New Zealander, <b>if</b> he thought <b>we</b> <b>really</b> needed an escort. He said that, unless we had bad luck, he could {{probably}} {{get away from}} anything except a very up-to-date fighter. [...] I {{asked him if he}} would get into trouble <b>if</b> <b>we</b> went without an escort. He replied cheerfully that, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> came back safely, no one would say anything, and <b>if</b> <b>we</b> didn't, it wouldn't matter anyway. This seemed sound enough logic, and so we sent off a signal to Robin, announcing our arrival, and set off on our own.|$|R
3000|$|I {{think they}} [synthetic organisms] {{are going to}} {{potentially}} create a new industrial revolution <b>if</b> <b>we</b> can <b>really</b> get cells to do the production <b>we</b> want; <b>if</b> they could help wean us off of oil, and reverse some of {{the damage to the}} environment like capturing back carbon dioxide. We think some of the earliest applications people will see are new vaccines. We can make, in a day, new flu vaccines that have taken much longer to produce by conventional methods. 15 [...]...|$|R
60|$|This being so, it {{naturally}} {{results that}} <b>if</b> <b>we</b> want <b>really</b> {{to understand the}} history of life, its origin and its episodes, we must turn nowadays {{to that part of}} our planet which still most nearly preserves the original conditions--that is to say, the Tropics. And it has always seemed to me, both à priori and à posteriori, that the Tropics on this account do really possess for every one of us a vast {{and for the most part}} unrecognised educational importance.|$|R
