MÉTODOS: Desenho prospectivo e observacional. Setecentos e quarenta e quatro pacientes consecutivos submetidos à cirurgia de revascularização miocárdica, valvar ou associada, entre maio e outubro de 2007, foram analisados. A mortalidade foi calculada com os escores 2000 BP e ES. A correlação entre mortalidade estimada e mortalidade observada foi validada mediante testes de calibração e discriminação. RESULTADOS: Os pacientes foram estratificados em cinco grupos para o 2000 BP e três para o ES. O teste de Hosmer Lemeshow para o 2000 BP (P = 0, 70) e para o <b>ES</b> (<b>P</b> = 0, 39) indica uma boa calibração.
