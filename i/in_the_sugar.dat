5|$|Linebacker Antarrious Williams was {{scheduled}} to miss the game after undergoing surgery to repair a dislocated bone suffered in the Tigers' game against Georgia. Williams had 44tackles during the regular season, and {{had been replaced by}} Derrick Graves in the SEC championship game. Graves was expected to do so again <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sugar</b> Bowl.|$|E
5|$|Maryland was sanctioned {{for violating}} a Southern Conference rule, passed {{halfway through the}} 1951 season, that banned postseason play. The punishment, for {{participating}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sugar</b> Bowl, disallowed the Terrapins from playing any conference games during the 1952 season. This compelled Maryland to schedule all but three games on the road.|$|E
5|$|Note: {{before the}} 1974 season, the final Coaches Poll, also known {{then as the}} UPI Poll, was {{released}} before the bowl games, so a team that lost its bowl game could still claim the UPI national championship. This was changed {{as a result of}} Alabama winning the 1973 Coaches Poll national championship despite losing to Notre Dame <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sugar</b> Bowl.|$|E

5|$|Notre Dame {{continued}} to succeed under Parseghian {{in the early}} 1970s. Led by senior quarterback Joe Theismann, the team {{finished second in the}} polls in 1970 and avenged its Cotton Bowl loss, defeating the Longhorns 24–11 in an upset. In 1973, Parseghian had a perfect season and won a second national championship, topped off by a 24–23 win over Alabama <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sugar</b> Bowl. Both teams were undefeated going into the game, but Alabama had held the top spot in the national polls. Parseghian was named coach of the year after the season by Football News.|$|E
5|$|On December 4, Michigan was {{selected}} to play <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sugar</b> Bowl against the Virginia Tech Hokies. It was Michigan's first BCS bowl game since the 2006 season, when Michigan was defeated by the USC Trojans in the 2007 Rose Bowl. The meeting between the Hokies and the Wolverines was the first between the two schools. Virginia Tech was forced to use its third-string kicker during the game, as first-string kicker Cody Journell was suspended for the game {{as a result of}} an arrest for breaking-and-entering, while second-string kicker Tyler Weiss was suspended from the game and sent home for missing curfew.|$|E
5|$|On the ground, the Tech {{offense was}} led by two running backs: Ken Oxendine and Dwayne Thomas. Thomas was a fifth-year senior who {{accumulated}} 673 rushing yards and seven touchdowns despite missing three games due to injury. Opening {{the field for the}} Tech rushing attack was the offensive line led by center Bill Conaty, who played <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sugar</b> Bowl despite a leg fracture suffered in Tech's final regular-season game. Conaty underwent surgery and played despite not being fully healed.|$|E

5|$|The Tigers lost 18players due to graduation, {{and several}} juniors elected {{to enter the}} 2005 NFL Draft as well. During {{the first round of}} the draft, Auburn had four players {{selected}}: Ronnie Brown, with the second overall pick, Carnell Williams (fifth), Carlos Rogers (ninth), and Jason Campbell (25th). Virginia Tech had three players selected in the 2005 draft: Eric Green (75th), Vincent Fuller (108th), and Jon Dunn (217th). Virginia Tech's appearance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sugar</b> Bowl helped its recruiting efforts in the state of Virginia, with eight of the state's top recruits (ranked by the Roanoke Times newspaper), pledging to attend Tech.|$|E
5|$|Three Virginia Tech {{players were}} charged with crimes before the Sugar Bowl. Linebacker Tony Morrison and {{receiver}} James Crawford were suspended indefinitely from the team and did not travel to the game. Morrison was arrested for public intoxication, petty larceny and destruction of property, while Crawford was charged with defrauding a garage keeper and felony hit and run. On December 12, cornerback Antonio Banks was charged with misdemeanor assault and battery but was not suspended from the team and played <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sugar</b> Bowl.|$|E
5|$|After Bryant retired, Ray Perkins {{extended}} Alabama's consecutive {{bowl game}} streak to 25 {{years with a}} victory in the 1983 Sun Bowl. However, the streak ended when the 1984 team finished the season with a record of five wins and six losses and failed to qualify for a bowl {{for the first time in}} 26 years. The bowl absence lasted only one season as Perkins led the Crimson Tide to wins in both the Aloha and Sun Bowls before he resigned as head coach following the 1986 season. Bill Curry continued the bowl tradition and led the Crimson Tide to Hall of Fame, Sun and Sugar Bowl appearances in his three seasons as head coach. After Curry, Gene Stallings took Alabama to the Fiesta, Blockbuster, Gator, Citrus and Outback Bowls. Stallings also led the Crimson Tide to victory in the first Bowl Coalition national championship game with a 34–13 victory over Miami <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sugar</b> Bowl. In August 1995, as part of the penalty imposed by the NCAA for rules violations, Alabama was ruled ineligible to participate in the 1995 bowl season.|$|E

5|$|After {{their loss}} to Oklahoma <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sugar</b> Bowl, Alabama's final team {{statistics}} were released. Nationally, Cody Mandell {{led the nation}} {{with an average of}} 42.43 net yards per punt. On the defensive side of the ball, of the 124 FBS teams, the Crimson Tide was ranked near the top of all major defensive categories both nationally and in conference. They ranked fourth nationally and first in conference scoring defense (13.9 points per game), fifth nationally and first in conference in total defense (286.50 yards per game), seventh nationally and first in conference in rushing defense (106.2 yards per game) and eleventh nationally and second in conference in passing defense (180.3 yards per game). Individually, C. J. Mosley led the team with 108 total tackles, 61 of which were assisted, and 47 solo tackles. Mosley also led the team with 8 tackles for loss. A'Shawn Robinson led the team with 5.5 quarterback sacks. Ha Ha Clinton-Dix, Landon Collins, Cyrus Jones and Vinnie Sunseri tied for the team lead in interception with each having made two.|$|E
5|$|As {{they entered}} the 2013 season, the Crimson Tide were ranked No.1 in both the AP and Coaches' Preseason Polls. As they were still undefeated {{at the time of}} the initial Bowl Championship Series (BCS) standings, the Crimson Tide were ranked first by the BCS on October 21. Alabama {{remained}} in the No.1 position through their final regular season game against Auburn. After their 34–28 loss against the Tigers, Alabama dropped to No.4 in all of the standings. The Crimson Tide closed the regular season in the No.3 position in all of the standings and failed to qualify for their third consecutive BCS National Championship Game. In the final poll of the season, Alabama dropped into the No.7 position in the AP and No.8 position in the Coaches' Polls after their loss against Oklahoma <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sugar</b> Bowl.|$|E
5|$|Defensively, {{both teams}} found success at times. In the first half, Texas' defense held the Hokies {{to just one}} touchdown, {{and that was not}} {{recorded}} until the second quarter. Virginia Tech's offense was extremely successful in shutting down the Longhorns' offense {{in the second half of}} the game. The Hokies shut out the Longhorns in that half, setting a bowl-game record for fewest points allowed in a half. Texas' 10 points, 78 yards rushing and 226 yards total offense were all season lows. In total, Tech's defense had nine tackles for loss, including five sacks of Brown. Linebacker Brandon Semones was Tech's leading tackler, and he had nine tackles, a sack, and a pass breakup. In pass defense, Torrian Gray had two interceptions, and William Yarborough had one. Gray's interceptions tied a Virginia Tech bowl-game record. Defensive tackle Jim Barron's fumble return for a touchdown was the first such score <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sugar</b> Bowl since a rule change in 1990.|$|E

The Tide went on to lose their final two games in the postseason to end the season 12–2. They lost to the Florida Gators (31–20) in the SEC Championship Game, and to the Utah Utes (31–17) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sugar</b> Bowl. Alabama reached No.1 in the AP and Coaches' Polls {{for the first time}} since the final polls in 1992 and during the regular season {{for the first time since}} 1980 between weeks ten and fourteen. The Tide reached No.1 in the BCS rankings for the first time in school history between weeks ten and fourteen. The team finished the 2008 season with a final ranking of No.6 in both the AP and Coaches' Polls.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Virginia Tech {{received}} its first bid to a Bowl Coalition game. The Bowl Coalition, predecessor {{to the modern}} Bowl Championship Series, was intended to match up the two best teams <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sugar,</b> Orange, Fiesta, and Rose Bowls, with the two highest-ranked teams playing in a National Championship Game. Following the 1995-1996 college football season, Virginia Tech was selected {{to play in the}} 1995 Sugar Bowl {{as a result of this}} coalition. The No. 13 Hokies, who finished 9–2 during the regular season and were named Big East Conference champions, played against the No. 9 University of Texas, who finished 10–1–1 during the regular season en route to becoming Southwest Conference champions.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, the Sugar Bowl {{was held}} {{under the rules}} of the Bowl Alliance. The Alliance, {{predecessor}} to the modern Bowl Championship Series, was intended to match the champions of the Southeastern Conference, Big East Conference, Atlantic Coast Conference, Big 12, Southwest Conference, and one at-large team against each other <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sugar</b> Bowl, Orange Bowl, and Fiesta Bowl. Each year, the two highest-ranked teams would play in a National Championship Game held in place of one of the bowl games. The site of the national championship game rotated among the three bowl games, as did the date of each game. Following the 1995 college football season, the Sugar Bowl was designated for December 31, marking the first time two Sugar Bowls would be held in the same calendar year.|$|E

5|$|In January 2007, Nick Saban {{was hired}} as head coach, and has led the Crimson Tide to bowl {{appearances}} {{in each of his}} five seasons at Alabama. After defeating Colorado in the Independence Bowl, Saban led Alabama to their second BCS bowl against Utah <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sugar</b> Bowl. In 2009, Saban led the Crimson Tide to the BCS National Championship Game, and defeated Texas 37–21 to clinch the program's first national title of the BCS era. A year after Alabama defeated Michigan State in the 2011 Capital One Bowl, the Crimson Tide defeated LSU in the BCS National Championship Game to clinch the program's second national title of the BCS era. The following season, the Crimson Tide won their second consecutive BCS National Championship Game by a final score of 42–14 over Notre Dame. In their latest bowl appearance, Alabama lost to Clemson in the College Football Playoff National Championship. The loss brought Alabama's overall bowl record to 39wins, 26 losses and 3ties, placing the Crimson Tide in first place among all FBS schools for both bowl appearances and victories.|$|E
5|$|In {{recognition}} of their achievements {{during the regular season}} and during the 2000 Sugar Bowl, multiple players and coaches from each team earned awards and recognition after the conclusion of the game. Tech quarterback Michael Vick, despite leading the losing team <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sugar</b> Bowl, won an ESPY for college football player of the year on February 14, more than a month after the Sugar Bowl. In addition, Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer won multiple coach of the year awards, most notably the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award, which was presented to Beamer on March 6. One of Beamer's assistant coaches, Bud Foster, was named the top defensive coordinator in Division I-A football by American Football Coach Magazine in its annual award. Florida State quarterback Chris Weinke won the 2000 Heisman Trophy after the conclusion of the 2000 college football season.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} leading up to the game, media {{coverage}} of the game focused on Auburn's exclusion from the national championship game, a controversial point for Auburn fans and other observers in the {{weeks leading up}} to the game. In addition, both teams boasted high-ranked defenses that had performed well during the year. Much was made of that fact and the success of Auburn running backs Carnell Williams and Ronnie Brown, each of whom were considered among the best players at their position. On the Virginia Tech side, senior quarterback Bryan Randall performed well for the Hokies during the regular season and was predicted to continue his success <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sugar</b> Bowl.|$|E
