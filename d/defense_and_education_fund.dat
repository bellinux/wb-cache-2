5|$|Based upon another {{recommendation}} from Cabranes, Sotomayor {{was a member}} of the board of directors of the Puerto Rican Legal <b>Defense</b> <b>and</b> <b>Education</b> <b>Fund</b> from 1980 to 1992. There she was a top policy maker who worked actively with the organization's lawyers on issues such as New York City hiring practices, police brutality, the death penalty, and voting rights. The group achieved its most visible triumph when it successfully blocked a city primary election on the grounds that New York City Council boundaries diminished the power of minority voters.|$|E
5|$|Sotomayor {{was born}} in The Bronx, New York City, to Puerto Rican-born parents. Her father {{died when she was}} nine, and she was {{subsequently}} raised by her mother.

Ed Lee volunteered for the cause by working through the terms of various anti-eviction agreements as an attorney for the Asian American Legal <b>Defense</b> <b>and</b> <b>Education</b> <b>Fund's</b> Asian Legal Caucus. Asian American student activists from nearby University of California, Berkeley and San Francisco State University also joined the protests, volunteering to repair and repaint the I-Hotel so that it remained habitable for tenants even as the Four Seas Investment Corporation failed to maintain basic utilities.|$|R
50|$|In 1991, {{the leaders}} of GAPIMNY, {{alongside}} the Asian Lesbians of the East Coast (ALOEC), protested against Lambda Legal <b>Defense</b> <b>and</b> <b>Education</b> <b>Fund's</b> <b>and</b> the Lesbian and Gay Community Services Center’s use of Miss Saigon in their fundraisers. The protesters expressed anger over the way Asian {{men and women were}} portrayed in Miss Saigon and demanded to be recognized as part of the LGBT community. Yoko Yoshikawa wrote on behalf of The Heat Is On Miss Saigon Coalition that they were outraged by the way that it perpetuated the idea that Asian women were self-erasing and Asian men were contemptible. When Lambda Legal refused to drop the fundraiser, the coalition staged demonstrations on April 6 and 11, 1991. Yoko observed that six men were arrested.|$|R

40|$|Griggs v. Duke Power, the Supreme Court {{case that}} held that {{policies}} that disproportionately harm minority employees can violate federal employment discrimination law even without evidence of “intentional” discrimination, recently turned forty. Griggs is generally celebrated as a landmark decision, but disparate impact’s current relevance (and its constitutionality) is hotly debated. Robert Belton’s The Crusade for Equality in the Workplace offers {{a rich and}} detailed history of the strategic choices {{that led to the}} plaintiffs’ victory in Griggs. This Review uses Belton’s history as a jumping off point to consider the contemporary importance of disparate impact in efforts to challenge employers’ use of criminal background screens. The Review also suggests that the failure to develop intersectional analysis — that is, an analysis of how sex and race may interact — in disparate impact doctrine risks obscuring key vectors of exclusion. Belton’s book gives modern readers an inside look at the NAACP Legal <b>Defense</b> <b>and</b> <b>Education</b> <b>Fund’s</b> litigation campaign in Griggs, and it does an excellent job showing how lawyers used disparate impact doctrine to dismantle test and educational requirements that could have excluded many black employees. The book, however, focuses almost exclusively on race discrimination cases. This Review explores the contemporaneous — and less successful — development of the doctrine in early sex discrimination cases. Generally, courts have not required employers to modify workplace structures that fail to accommodate caregiving responsibilities or pregnancy, despite their disparate impact on the basis of sex. Moreover, such policies often disproportionately harm women of color. By filling in this history, the Review offers a more nuanced assessment of disparate impact’s early years. The Review then considers contemporary efforts to challenge employers’ use of criminal background screens, policies that likewise cause a disparate impact on the basis of both race and sex. It suggests that current litigation might be more successful if the intersectional approach were better developed, but it also highlights the importance of compliance work in achieving equal employment opportunity in the modern world. Although the EEOC has lost some high profile cases in this area, its guidance indicating that criminal background screens may cause an unlawful disparate impact has pushed employers to reconsider and refine their use of such screens...|$|R

500|$|The [...] Puerto Rican Legal <b>Defense</b> <b>and</b> <b>Education</b> <b>Fund</b> {{was founded}} in 1972 by three lawyers, one of whom, Cesar A.

[...] PRLDEF {{played a key role in}} the installation of bilingual education in New York City schools, and soon became the most important legal advocacy group for Puerto Ricans in the U.S. mainland. [...] The group became known for the part it played in redistricting battles, for its opposition to civil service exams it thought discriminatory, and for its attempts to combat anti-Latino sentiment especially as arising from the debate over immigration to the U.S. [...] It changed its name to the current one in 2008 in order to reflect demographic shifts in the Latino population in New York and elsewhere.|$|E

It was created as a privately funded, nonprofit and nonpartisan organization {{with the goal of}} changing discriminatory practices via advocacy and litigation. [...] It was inspired in form and purpose by the high-profile NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which Thurgood Marshall had established in 1957. [...] PRLDEF (pronounced [...] "pearl-deaf") had $300,000 of initial funding from foundations, government sources, and private corporations. [...] U.S. House of Representatives member Herman Badillo was on its first Board of Directors, and at the fund's initial press conference he said, [...] "There is plenty of room for change in our society, and much can be done through the medium of class actions." [...] The organization soon grew to have a Litigation Division, a Pro Bono Cooperating Counsel Division, and an Education Division.

Cusick (a trainee performer who was scheduled to begin working at Mystère) alleged that in April 2002, Cirque du Soleil fired him because he tested HIV-positive, even though company doctors had already cleared him as healthy enough to perform. Cirque du Soleil alleged that {{due to the nature of}} Cusick's disease coupled with his job's high risk of injury, there was a significant risk of his infecting other performers, crew or audience members. [...] Cirque du Soleil said that they had several HIV-positive employees, but in the case of Cusick, the risk of him spreading his infection while performing was too high to take the risk. A boycott ensued and Just Out ran a story on it (with the headline [...] "Flipping off the Cirque"). Cirque du Soleil settled with Cusick in April 2004; under the settlement, the company began a company-wide anti-discrimination training program, changed its employment practices pertaining to HIV-positive applicants; paid Cusick $60,000 in lost wages, $200,000 in front pay, and $300,000 in compensatory damages; and paid $40,000 in attorney fees to [...] Lambda Legal.|$|E
