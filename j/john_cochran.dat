Before {{and after the}} 2000 election, <b>John</b> <b>Cochran</b> of ABC News connected the Lewinsky scandal with a voter phenomenon he called [...] "Clinton fatigue". Polling showed that the scandal continued to affect Clinton's low personal approval ratings through the election, and analysts such as Vanderbilt University's John G. Geer later concluded [...] "Clinton fatigue or a kind of moral retrospective voting {{had a significant impact}} on Gore's chances". Other analysts sided with Clinton's argument, and argued that Gore's refusal to have Clinton campaign with him damaged his appeal.|$|E

2500|$|Led by Paul Peters, adversaries of the {{memorial}} delivered to Congress a leaflet titled [...] "Public Necessity or Just Plain Pork". The JNEMA's lawyer, Bon Geaslin, {{believed that the}} flyers did not taint the project, but motivated members of Congress {{to find out more}} about the same. Although Representative <b>John</b> <b>Cochran</b> wanted to ask Congress to approve more funds, Geaslin believed the association should [...] "keep a low profile, maintaining its current position during this session of Congress". He advised the association to [...] "get a good strong editorial in one of the papers to the effect that a small group of tenants ... is soliciting funds [...] the proposed improvement, and stating that these efforts do not represent the consensus of opinion in St. Louis ..., and pointing out that such obstructions should be condemned".|$|E
2500|$|The Lucy Walker was {{an average}} vessel of her time: [...] long with {{a beam of}} [...] and a draft of [...] She {{displaced}} 183 tons. She was built at Cincinnati, Ohio in 1843 and her home port was Webbers Falls on the Arkansas River in the Cherokee Nation in Indian Territory (now Oklahoma). The boat frequently steamed to both Louisville, Kentucky and New Orleans, Louisiana. She was a side-wheeler, with three boilers, only one deck, no masts, no figurehead, and an above-deck cabin. Thomas F. Eckert, <b>John</b> <b>Cochran,</b> and Thomas J. Halderman had successively served as master or captain of the Lucy Walker. Captain Halderman was a very experienced river man, who since 1820 had worked as fireman, deck hand, engineer, and captain on steamboats, and later was a steamboat inspector. For some unknown reason, Halderman was replaced in Louisville just before departure, and her owner, Joseph Vann, took over the duties as captain.|$|E
2500|$|The {{suggestion}} {{to renew the}} riverfront was not original, as previous projects were attempted but lacked popularity. The Jefferson memorial idea emerged amid the economic disarray of the Great Depression and promised new jobs. The project was expected to create 5,000 jobs {{for three to four}} years. Committee members began to raise public awareness by organizing fundraisers and writing pamphlets. They also engaged Congress by planning budgets and preparing bills, in addition to researching ownership of the land they had chosen, [...] "approximately one-half mile in length... from Third Street east to the present elevated railroad." [...] In January 1934, Senator Bennett Champ Clark and Representative <b>John</b> <b>Cochran</b> introduced to Congress an appropriation bill seeking $30million for the memorial, but the bill failed to garner support due to the large amount of money solicited. In March of the same year, joint resolutions proposed the establishment of a federal commission to develop the memorial. Although the proposal aimed for only authorization, the bill incurred opposition because people suspected that JNEMA would later seek appropriation. On March 28 the Senate bill was reported out, and on April 5 it was turned over to the House Library Committee, [...] which later reported favorably on the bills. On June 8, both the Senate and House bills were passed. On June 15, then President Franklin D. Roosevelt , instituting the United States Territorial Expansion Memorial Commission. The commission comprised 15 members, chosen by Roosevelt, the House, the Senate, and JNEMA.
