5|$|Highway 82 {{begins at}} Exit 116 from I-70 in <b>Glenwood</b> <b>Springs,</b> just 300ft (100 m) {{east of the}} Roaring Fork's {{confluence}} with the Colorado River. It follows Laurel Street north for one block, then turns east on Sixth Street for another block, after which it turns south on Grand Avenue. From there it crosses both I-70 and the Colorado River on a viaduct past the train station into downtown <b>Glenwood</b> <b>Springs.</b>|$|E
5|$|CDOT runs a {{bus system}} named Bustang that offers weekday service between Union Station in Denver, <b>Glenwood</b> <b>Springs,</b> Colorado Springs, and Fort Collins.|$|E
5|$|West of Aspen {{the highway}} follows {{the route of}} an early Colorado Midland Railroad route from the city to <b>Glenwood</b> <b>Springs.</b> Paved during the 1930s, this road has been {{gradually}} expanded to four lanes {{over the course of}} the 20th and early 21st centuries. The increased traffic resulting from Aspen's economic rebirth as a resort town has required high-occupancy vehicle lanes, bypasses and the replacement of at least one old bridge. More improvements are planned for both Aspen and <b>Glenwood</b> <b>Springs.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Glenwood</b> Hot <b>Springs</b> is {{the largest}} hot springs {{facility}} in town, centrally located across the Colorado River from downtown. The large pool is kept at [...] year round and is the world's largest hot mineral springs pool. The smaller [...] "Therapy Pool" [...] averages [...] year round, preferred by some for its higher mineral content. There is a 107-room lodge, which includes unlimited access to the hot springs and a full hot breakfast for all guests. Spa of the Rockies is an award-winning mineral spa that specializes in natural, mineral based treatments. Other amenities include a full-service athletic club, gift shop and restaurant. Two waterslides, mini golf, and a cold water kiddy pool are open during the warmer months.|$|R
50|$|As of 1989, the Fish Management Division {{operated}} six hatcheries: <b>Glenwood</b> Hatchery, Lisboa <b>Springs</b> Hatchery, Parkview Hatchery, Red River Hatchery, Seven Springs Hatchery and Rock Lake Hatchery. The last hatches walleye {{while the}} others hatch trout or kokanee.The discovery of whirling disease, Myxobolus cerebralis, in the early 1990s had a devastating effect, since some fish from {{five of the six}} hatcheries tested positive, and Game and Fish decided they should not stock any fish from hatcheries with known diseases. The hatcheries will have to be rebuilt.|$|R
50|$|In 1887, John Taylor—who by {{then had}} become the {{president}} of the church—sent Charles Ora Card, {{the president of the}} church's Cache Stake, to Canada's Northwest Territories to establish a Mormon colony that was {{beyond the reach of the}} United States government's anti-polygamy prosecutions. Card led a group of followers and established a settlement along Lee's Creek; the settlement was eventually renamed Cardston in Card's honour. The Alberta Stake of the church was created in 1895 with Card as its president; it was the first stake of the church established outside of the United States.Mormon pioneers continued to colonize what would become Alberta in 1905. Before the turn of the century, Latter-day Saints had founded Mountain View, Aetna, Beazer, Leavitt, Kimball, Caldwell, Taylorville, Magrath, and Stirling. After 1900, Mormon colonies were established in Woolford, Welling, Orton, Raymond, Barnwell, Taber, Frankburg, <b>Glenwood,</b> and Hill <b>Spring.</b> Church apostle John W. Taylor—the son of church president John Taylor—played a leadership role in assisting Latter-day Saint emigration from Utah to Alberta.|$|R
5|$|With the {{widening}} {{of the highway}} to four lanes between <b>Glenwood</b> <b>Springs</b> and Aspen complete, CDOT has turned its attention {{to the ends of}} that corridor.|$|E
5|$|By 1890, an {{alternate}} route through <b>Glenwood</b> <b>Springs</b> {{had been completed}} and the route through the Black Canyon, being more difficult to operate, lost importance for through trains. The route was finally abandoned in 1955.|$|E
5|$|A mile {{south of}} the airport, at a signalized {{intersection}} with Old State Route 82, the road divides. Highway 82 turns eastward again, returning to its southerly heading after another mile when Spring Valley Road turns off to the <b>Glenwood</b> <b>Springs</b> campus of Colorado Mountain College in {{the mountains to the}} north. A half-mile (1km) beyond that junction, at the headquarters of the Garfield County Road and Bridge District, the highway begins a long stretch with a southerly heading.|$|E
5|$|By 1960 the {{population}} of Pitkin County had increased by 44%, the second-fastest growth rate on the Western Slope. The Aspen Skiing Company built two additional resorts, Buttermilk and Snowmass, to the west, contributing to traffic on the highway. In 1962 the Colorado Department of Highways, began a 12-year project to expand Highway 82 to four lanes between <b>Glenwood</b> <b>Springs</b> and Carbondale. The Maroon Creek Bridge was widened in 1963 to handle its increased traffic.|$|E
5|$|During the Depression, {{the state}} sought to ease {{unemployment}} through {{public works projects}} as an economic stimulus. It applied this to the new Highway 82. First it converted the Maroon Creek Bridge for automotive traffic by widening it with a timber deck, which was then paved and supported with outriggers. In 1937, four miles (6.4km) between <b>Glenwood</b> <b>Springs</b> and Carbondale was paved; {{the remainder of the}} road to Aspen was oiled the following year.|$|E
5|$|Highway 82 {{was now a}} four-lane road all the {{way from}} <b>Glenwood</b> <b>Springs</b> to Aspen. But that traffic still had to narrow to two lanes to cross the Maroon Creek Bridge at the latter city's western boundary. The old bridge, listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1985, was {{functionally}} obsolete and structurally deficient. Cracks and other damage were forcing temporary closures of the bridge to trucks. Over 100 years old by that point, the oldest bridge in use on a Colorado highway, it could not be expanded any further.|$|E
5|$|Some {{residents}} of <b>Glenwood</b> <b>Springs</b> have argued instead that CDOT should instead build a bypass that avoids downtown completely, {{as it did}} in Basalt. They contend that a replacement bridge would add even more traffic to Grand and make downtown less attractive to those who would like to shop there rather than just pass through on the way to destinations up the valley. The bypass, they claim, is more in keeping with the wishes of residents and would cost less. They have lobbied Glenwood Springs' city council to be more active in pressuring CDOT to reconsider the bypass.|$|E
5|$|It {{continues}} south through {{blocks of}} small-scale dense urban development to 14th Street. <b>Glenwood</b> <b>Springs</b> High School {{is on the}} west just past the intersection heralds the end of downtown. For two blocks the land around the road becomes a commercial strip with large parking lots. At Hyland Park on the east just afterwards, the land across the road is devoted to larger houses on larger lots. Strip development resumes {{on the west side}} south of 19th Street, two blocks west of Valley View Hospital. At 23rd Street, Highway 82 turns southeast to follow South Glen Avenue, paralleling the adjacent Rio Grande rail trail. Development along the highway becomes predominantly commercial, and south of 27th Street a continuous strip begins on the east side as the valley narrows. After passing Rosebud Cemetery on the west side, Highway 82 turns more to the southeast and draws alongside the Roaring Fork as it reaches the city limits.|$|E
5|$|The Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) {{restricts the}} use of Highway 82 through the pass. Most {{significant}} is the winter closure. The road is typically closed after the first significant winter snowfall, or by November 7 at the latest (but there have been exceptions.). CDOT tries to reopen just before Memorial Day weekend in late May, the traditional beginning of summer in the United States, when enough of the accumulated snowpack has melted {{to make it possible}} to clear and repair the road. Some years, after light winters, the pass has reopened as early as May 12. Two gates, just east of Aspen on the west end and west of the remaining buildings of the stage stop of Everett on the east, prevent motor vehicles from passage. When the road is closed, Aspen is isolated from the east and Highway 82 up the valley from <b>Glenwood</b> <b>Springs</b> becomes the only vehicular access to the city during its busy ski season.|$|E
25|$|<b>Glenwood</b> <b>Springs</b> in Colorado has {{a flow of}} 143liters/second.|$|E
25|$|Roaring Fork Transportation Authority, or RFTA, {{provides}} free {{bus service}} within Aspen and Snowmass Village, and pay {{service to the}} surrounding communities of Basalt, El Jebel, Carbondale, <b>Glenwood</b> <b>Springs,</b> and Rifle. Local RFTA bus service within Aspen and to Snowmass Village is free. Amtrak serves <b>Glenwood</b> <b>Springs,</b> offering in conjunction with RFTA an environmentally friendly way to travel to Aspen.|$|E
25|$|On July 17, 1983, former Zephyrette Beulah Bauman {{was chosen}} to christen Amtrak's California Zephyr before it {{departed}} Denver Union Station on its inaugural journey. Furthermore, in 2011, a group of former Zephyrettes held their first reunion in San Francisco. In 2013, approximately 20 attended a second Zephyrette reunion in <b>Glenwood</b> <b>Springs,</b> Colorado, where they visited the <b>Glenwood</b> <b>Springs</b> Railway Museum inside the city's Amtrak station.|$|E
25|$|Curry {{is buried}} in Pioneer (Linwood) Cemetery {{overlooking}} <b>Glenwood</b> <b>Springs,</b> Colorado, {{a short distance from}} fellow gunfighter Doc Holliday's memorial.|$|E
25|$|Keeping {{a record}} of a crash site, such as photographs, maps, journals, logs, and all terrain and weather {{recordings}} are essential, i.e. the <b>Glenwood</b> <b>Springs,</b> Colorado, B-17 crash site or the Tells Peak, CA, B-17 crash site.|$|E
25|$|The Western Slope lies {{in close}} {{proximity}} to multiple notable destinations in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, including <b>Glenwood</b> <b>Springs,</b> with its resort hot springs, and the ski resorts of Aspen, Breckenridge, Vail, Crested Butte, Steamboat Springs, and Telluride.|$|E
25|$|In {{the next}} couple of decades, a number of free dailies opened in Colorado. Not coincidentally, most were started by University of Colorado graduates. Free dailies opened in Aspen (1979, 1988), Vail (1981), Breckenridge (1990), <b>Glenwood</b> <b>Springs</b> (1990); Grand Junction (1995); Steamboat Springs (1990); and Telluride (1991).|$|E
25|$|The city of Grand Junction, Colorado is {{the largest}} city on the Western Slope. Grand Junction and Durango are the only major centers of {{television}} broadcasting west of the Continental Divide in Colorado, though most mountain resort communities publish daily newspapers. Higher education in and near the Western Slope {{can be found at}} Colorado Mesa University in Grand Junction, Western State College of Colorado in Gunnison, Fort Lewis College in Durango, and Colorado Mountain College in <b>Glenwood</b> <b>Springs</b> and Steamboat Springs.|$|E
25|$|The {{historic}} {{character of}} {{the city has been}} challenged in recent decades by skyrocketing property values and the proliferation of second homes, increasingly shutting low- and middle-income workers out of the city and creating a large pool of commuters from nearby bedroom communities such as Snowmass, Basalt, Carbondale, and <b>Glenwood</b> <b>Springs.</b> At the same time, in stark contrast to its historic character, the city has emerged into international fame as a glitzy playground of the wealthy and famous. Aspen has become a second and third home to many international jet setters.|$|E
25|$|Holliday {{is buried}} in Linwood Cemetery {{overlooking}} <b>Glenwood</b> <b>Springs.</b> Since Holliday died in November, the ground may have been frozen. Some modern authors such as Bob Boze Bell speculate {{that it would have}} been impossible to transport him to the cemetery, which was only accessible by a difficult mountain road, or to dig a grave because the ground was frozen. Author Gary Roberts located evidence that other bodies were transported to the Linwood Cemetery at the same time of the month that year. Contemporary newspaper reports explicitly state that Holliday was buried in the Linwood Cemetery, but the exact location of his grave is uncertain.|$|E
25|$|Following the Tombstone shootout, Virgil Earp was maimed by hidden assailants and Morgan Earp was murdered. Unable {{to obtain}} {{justice in the}} courts, Wyatt Earp took matters into his own hands. As the {{recently}} appointed deputy U.S. marshal, Earp formally deputized Holliday, among others. As a federal posse, they pursued the outlaw Cowboys they believed were responsible. They found Frank Stilwell lying in wait as Virgil boarded a train for California and killed him. The local sheriff issued a warrant for the arrest of {{five members of the}} federal posse, including Holliday. The federal posse killed three other Cowboys during late March and early April, 1882, before they rode to the New Mexico Territory. Wyatt Earp learned of an extradition request for Holliday and arranged for Colorado Governor Frederick Walker Pitkin to deny Holliday's extradition. Holliday spent the few remaining years of his life in Colorado, and died of tuberculosis in his bed at the <b>Glenwood</b> <b>Springs</b> Hotel at age 36.|$|E
500|$|After {{stealing}} a car, Bundy drove eastward out of <b>Glenwood</b> <b>Springs,</b> {{but the car}} soon broke down in the mountains on Interstate 70. A passing motorist gave him a ride into Vail, [...] to the east. From there he caught a bus to Denver, where he boarded a morning flight to Chicago. In <b>Glenwood</b> <b>Springs,</b> the jail's skeleton crew did not discover the escape until noon on December 31, more than 17 hours later. By then Bundy was already in Chicago.|$|E
500|$|Following the river's bend, {{the road}} returns to its {{southern}} heading as most development focuses around <b>Glenwood</b> <b>Springs</b> Municipal Airport {{on the opposite}} bank. At its next easterly turn, the landscape around the road becomes more rural, with farms and golf courses appearing. The terrain remains generally level, at about [...] above sea level.|$|E
500|$|New {{leadership}} at both companies started {{the race to}} Aspen. James John Hagerman joined the Midland in 1885, refreshing the company coffers with his mining fortune. A year later the railroad had laid [...] of track from Colorado Springs to Leadville and crossed the Continental Divide via the Hagerman Tunnel, then the world's highest. It got to <b>Glenwood</b> <b>Springs</b> and began working its way up the valley to Aspen.|$|E
500|$|The pass comes roughly in {{the middle}} of a [...] stretch of Highway 82 between the two winter gates, a {{corridor}} that is sometimes referred to in its entirety as Independence Pass. Aspen is [...] to the west, with Twin Lakes [...] to the east. Beyond Aspen the highway continues down the valley to the mouth of the Roaring Fork at <b>Glenwood</b> <b>Springs.</b> East of Twin Lakes Highway 82 continues a short distance to its eastern terminus at U.S. Highway 24, [...] south of Leadville.|$|E
500|$|After World War II, Aspen {{began to}} grow and prosper again due to the {{establishment}} of a popular ski resort, an annual music festival, and a relaxed lifestyle which attracted many celebrities and corporate executives to the city. Visitors to Aspen generally had to take Highway 82 up from <b>Glenwood</b> <b>Springs</b> or fly in, as few wanted to drive over the unpaved pass road. In 1967 the State Highway Department remedied this by paving the road over the pass. It has since been designated part of Colorado's [...] "Top of the Rockies" [...] scenic byway by the state and federal departments of transportation.|$|E
500|$|State Highway 82 (SH 82) is an [...] {{state highway}} in the U.S. state of Colorado. Its western half {{provides}} the principal transportation artery of the Roaring Fork Valley on the Colorado Western Slope, beginning at Interstate 70 (I-70) and U.S. Highway 6 (US 6) in <b>Glenwood</b> <b>Springs</b> southeast past Carbondale, Basalt and Aspen. From there it continues {{up the valley}} to cross the Continental Divide at Independence Pass. On the Eastern Slope, it follows Lake Creek past some of Colorado's highest mountains to Twin Lakes Reservoir, where it ends at US 24 south of Leadville.|$|E
500|$|Basalt is {{one mile}} due east. The {{intersection}} with Basalt Avenue, the main route into that town from Highway 82, has a signal. Between <b>Glenwood</b> <b>Springs</b> and Basalt, Highway 82 climbs [...] in elevation. As it alternately tracks southeast and south {{over the next}} [...] towards Aspen, it begins to climb more noticeably and the valley narrows. Development becomes less dense, with many small ranches located aside the road and along the river. Three miles (5km) south of Basalt, after another crossing of the Roaring Fork, the right lanes in both directions are marked with diamonds indicating they are high-occupancy vehicle lanes during peak hours. The median is soon replaced with a guardrail, then a brief retaining wall where the eastbound roadway is slightly elevated.|$|E
500|$|Approaching {{the city}} of <b>Glenwood</b> <b>Springs,</b> the highway enters Glenwood Canyon. Both {{the federal and state}} {{departments}} of transportation have praised the engineering achievement required to build the freeway through the narrow gorge while preserving the natural beauty of the canyon. A [...] section of roadway features the No Name Tunnel, Hanging Lake Tunnel, Reverse Curve Tunnel, 40 bridges and viaducts, and miles of retaining walls. Through {{a significant portion of the}} canyon, the eastbound lanes extend cantilevered over the Colorado River and the westbound lanes are suspended on a viaduct several feet above the canyon floor. Along this run, the freeway hugs the north bank of the Colorado River, while the main line of the former Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad (now part of Union Pacific) occupies the south bank.|$|E
500|$|Back {{in jail in}} <b>Glenwood</b> <b>Springs,</b> Bundy {{ignored the}} advice of friends and legal advisors to stay put. The case against him, already weak at best, was deteriorating {{steadily}} as pretrial motions consistently resolved in his favor and significant bits of evidence were ruled inadmissible. [...] "A more rational defendant might have realized that he stood {{a good chance of}} acquittal, and that beating the murder charge in Colorado would probably have dissuaded other prosecutors ... with as little as {{a year and a half}} to serve on the DaRonch conviction, had Ted persevered, he could have been a free man." [...] Instead, Bundy assembled a new escape plan. He acquired a detailed floor plan of the jail and a hacksaw blade from other inmates, and accumulated $500 in cash, smuggled in over a six-month period, he later said, by visitors—Carole Ann Boone in particular. During the evenings, while other prisoners were showering, he sawed a hole about one foot (0.30 m) square between the steel reinforcing bars in his cell's ceiling and, after losing , was able to wriggle through it into the crawl space above. In the weeks that followed he made a series of practice runs, exploring the space. Multiple reports from an informant of movement within the ceiling during the night were not investigated.|$|E
500|$|On June 7, 1977, Bundy was transported [...] {{from the}} Garfield County jail in <b>Glenwood</b> <b>Springs</b> to Pitkin County Courthouse in Aspen for a {{preliminary}} hearing. He had elected {{to serve as}} his own attorney, and as such, was excused by the judge from wearing handcuffs or leg shackles. During a recess he asked to visit the courthouse's law library to research his case. Concealed behind a bookcase, he opened a window and jumped from the second story, spraining his right ankle as he landed. After shedding an outer layer of clothing he walked through Aspen as roadblocks were being set up on its outskirts, then hiked southward onto Aspen Mountain. Near its summit he broke into a hunting cabin and stole food, clothing, and a rifle. The following day he left the cabin and continued south toward the town of Crested Butte, but became lost in the forest. For two days he wandered aimlessly on the mountain, missing two trails that led downward to his intended destination. On June 10, he broke into a camping trailer on Maroon Lake, [...] south of Aspen, taking food and a ski parka; but instead of continuing southward, he walked back north toward Aspen, eluding roadblocks and search parties along the way. Three days later, he stole a car {{at the edge of}} Aspen Golf Course. Cold, sleep-deprived, and in constant pain from his sprained ankle, he drove back into Aspen, where two police officers noticed his car weaving in and out of its lane and pulled him over. He had been a fugitive for six days. In the car were maps of the mountain area around Aspen that prosecutors were using to demonstrate the location of Caryn Campbell's body (as his own attorney, Bundy had rights of discovery), indicating that his escape was not a spontaneous act, but had been planned.|$|E
