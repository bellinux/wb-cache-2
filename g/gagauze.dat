5000|$|The Steppe {{hypothesis}} {{suggests that}} the <b>Gagauzes</b> may be descendants of the Turkic nomadic tribes (Bulgars and Cumans) from the Eurasian steppes. In the 19th century, before their migration to Bessarabia, the <b>Gagauzes</b> from the Bulgarian lands (then in Ottoman Turkey) considered themselves Bulgarians. Ethnological research suggest that [...] "Gagauz" [...] was a linguistic distinction and not ethnic. <b>Gagauzes</b> to that time called themselves [...] "Hasli Bulgar" [...] (True Bulgars) or [...] "Eski Bulgar" [...] (Old Bulgars) and considered the term [...] "Gagauz" [...] applied {{to them by the}} Slavic-speaking Bulgarians (who they called [...] "toukan") demeaning. The <b>Gagauzes</b> called their language Turkish and accordingly claimed descent from early Turkic Bulgars who in the 7th century established the Bulgarian state on Danube. Now many Gagauz in Moldova claim Seljuk-Turkish descent. The Gagauz in Bulgaria do not support that view.|$|R

50|$|The {{origin of}} the <b>Gagauzes</b> is obscure. In the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, Bulgarian historian M. Dimitrov counts 19 different theories about their origin. A few decades later the Gagauz ethnologist M. N. Guboglo increases the number to 21. In some of those theories the Gagauz people are presented as descendants of the Bulgars, the Cumans-Kipchaks (there is a modern Gagauz family name Qipcaqli) or a clan of Seljuk Turks or as linguistically Turkified Bulgarians. The fact that their confession is Eastern Orthodox Christianity suggest that their ancestors already lived in the Balkans prior to the Ottoman conquest in the late 14th century.|$|R
5000|$|Though it was {{established}} as a written language in 1957, Gagauz was not used in curriculum until 1959, when even then it was not used officially or in everyday life.

The term [...] "Gagauz language" [...] and identification of one's language as [...] "Gagauz" [...] were established concurrently with or even after the creation of national self-awareness. About 150,000 Gaguazes resided in Moldava in 1986, where they lived in settlements within the Komratskii, Chadyr-Lungskii and Vulkaneshtskii Rayons.

5000|$|... ==Genetic origins== [...] Bulgarians {{are genetically}} nearest either to peoples from the Balkan, central European people, or both, {{depending}} on the type of DNA and the samples of populations included in the studies. According to a triple autosomal, mitochondrial and paternal analysis of available data from large-scale studies on Balto-Slavs and their proximal populations, the whole genome SNP data situates Bulgarians in a cluster with Romanians and Macedonians, and they are at similar proximity to <b>Gagauzes,</b> Montenegrins and Serbs who are not part of another cluster but are described as 'in between' clusters. Bulgarians are least distanced from the same populations according to the Y-DNA analysis. Genetic distance calculated by SNP data of the multiple autosomes, ranked most proximal to Bulgarians the Serbs, followed by Macedonians, Montenegrins, Romanians, <b>Gagauzes,</b> Macedonian Greeks, the rest of the South Slavs, Hungarians, Slovaks, Czechs, and then by Greeks from Thessaloniki, Central Greece and Peloponese. At the mtDNA plot the Bulgarians share their most proximal position with Macedonians, Czechs, Romanians and Hungarians. It was concluded that the contributions to the Bulgarian gene pool from the pre-Slavic indigenous population definitely outnumber that of the Slavic settlers who spread their language in the Balkans mainly by assimilation. Autosomal studies detect a connection between modern Bulgarians and North Slavs that is a result of migrations no earlier than 1,500 years ago. Anyway most of the East-West Slavs share only a modest gene flow with Bulgarians. While the Bulgarians share significantly fewer IBD segments for length classes with Greeks than with the group of East-West Slavs, most of the East-West Slavs share as much as IBD segments with the Bulgarians as with the inter-Slavic populations Romanians and Hungarians. Despite various invasions of Altaic peoples in Europe, no significant impact from such Asian descent is recorded throughout southern and central Europe.|$|R
40|$|The Dniester-Carpathian {{region has}} {{attracted}} much attention from historians, linguists, and anthropologists, but remains insufficiently studied genetically. We have analyzed a set of autosomal polymorphic loci and Y-chromosome markers in six autochthonous Dniester-Carpathian population groups: 2 Moldavian, 1 Romanian, 1 Ukrainian and 2 Gagauz populations. To gain insight into the population history of the region, the data obtained {{in this study were}} compared with corresponding data for other populations of Western Eurasia. The analysis of 12 Alu human-specific polymorphisms in 513 individuals from the Dniester-Carpathian region showed a high degree of homogeneity among Dniester-Carpathian as well as southeastern European populations. The observed homogeneity suggests either a common ancestry of all southeastern European populations or a strong gene flow between them. Nevertheless, tree reconstruction and principle component analyses allow the distinction between Balkan-Carpathian (Macedonians, Romanians, Moldavians, Ukrainians and <b>Gagauzes)</b> and Eastern Mediterranean (Turks, Greeks and Albanians) population groups. These results are consistent with those from classical and other DNA markers and are compatible with archaeological and paleoanthropological data. Haplotypes constructed from Y-chromosome markers were used to trace the paternal origin of the Dniester-Carpathian populations. A set of 32 binary and 7 STR Y-chromosome polymorphisms was genotyped in 322 Dniester-Carpathian Y-chromosomes. On this basis, 21 stable haplogroups and 171 combination binary marker/STR haplotypes were identified. The haplogroups E 3 b 1, G, J 1, J 2, I 1 b, R 1 a 1, and R 1 b 3, most common in the Dniester-Carpathian region, are also common in European and Near Eastern populations. Ukrainians and southeastern Moldavians show a high proportion of eastern European lineages, while Romanians and northern Moldavians demonstrate a high proportion of western Balkan lineages. The <b>Gagauzes</b> harbor a conspicuous proportion of lineages of Near Eastern origin, comparable to that in Balkan populations. In general, the Dniester-Carpathian populations demonstrate the closest affinities to the neighboring southeastern and eastern European populations. The expansion times were estimated for 4 haplogroups (E 3 b 1, I 1 b, R 1 a 1, and R 1 b 3) from associated STR diversity. The presence in the studied area of genetic components of different age indicates successive waves of migration from diverse source areas of Western Eurasia. Neither of the genetic systems used in this study revealed any correspondence between genetic and linguistic patterns in the Dniester-Carpathian region or in Southeastern Europe, a fact which suggests either that the ethnic differentiation in these regions was indeed very recent or that the linguistic and other social barriers were not strong enough to prevent genetic flow between populations. In particular, <b>Gagauzes,</b> a Turkic speaking population, show closer affinities not to other Turkic peoples, but to their geographical neighbors...|$|R
5000|$|It is {{suggested}} that the <b>Gagauzes</b> migrated to Bessarabia from northeastern Bulgaria (Dobruja) {{in the beginning of}} the 19th century [...] However, very little is known about their previous history. Turkic-speaking tribes of the Nogai Horde inhabited the Budjak region of southern Bessarabia from the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries. Before 1807, a portion of these tribes were forced to abandon the Budjak by the Tsarist government of Russia, resettling in Crimea, Azov and Stavropol Krai. Soon after they were replaced by other Turkic-speaking people which later came to be known as the Gagauz. Most if not all Gagauz people who now live in Moldova, came to Bessarabia from Bulgaria (then in the Ottoman Empire) after the Russo-Turkish War (1806-1812). This fact is well documented in the Russian tsarist archives. They settled alongside Slavic-speaking Bulgarians who emigrated at the same time and often married them.|$|R
5000|$|Based on post-war statistics, {{historian}} Igor Cașu {{has shown}} that Moldovans/Romanians comprised roughly 50 percent of the deportees, with the rest being Jews, Russians, Ukrainians, <b>Gagauzes,</b> Bulgarians and Roma people. Considering the ethnic make-up of the region, he concludes that pre- and post-war repression was not directed at any specific ethnic or national group, but could be characterised as [...] "genocide" [...] or [...] "crime against humanity". The 1941 deportation targeted [...] "anti-Soviet elements" [...] and comprised former representatives of the Romanian interwar administration (policemen, gendarmes, prison guards, clerks), large land-owners, tradesmen, former officers of the Romanian, Polish and Tsarist armies, and people who had defected the Soviet Union before 1940. Kulaks would only become main targets of repression in the post-war period. Before Soviet archives were made accessible, R. J. Rummel had estimated between 1940 and 1941, 200,000 to 300,000 Romanian Bessarabians were persecuted, conscripted into forced labor camps, or deported with the entire family, of whom 18,000 to 57,000 were supposedly killed.|$|R
5000|$|Whilst haploid markers such as mtDNA and Y-DNA {{can provide}} clues about past {{population}} history, they only represent a single genetic locus, compared {{to hundreds of}} thousands present in nuclear, autosomes. Although autosomal analyses often sample a small number of Bulgarians, by multiple autosomes multiple ancestral lines may be traced by an individual's 21 autosomes as opposed to one identical mtDNA or Y DNA sex chromosome, whose inheritance although clinal, demonstrates genetic drift often in statistics. Analyses of autosomal DNA markers gives the best approximation of overall 'relatedness' between populations, presenting a less skewed genetic picture compared to Y DNA haplogroups. This atDNA data shows that there are no sharp discontinuities or clusters within the European population. Rather there exists a genetic gradient, running mostly in a southeast to northwest direction. A study compared all Slavic nations and combined all lines of evidence, autosomal, maternal and paternal, including more than 6000 people for and at least 700 Bulgarians from previous studies, of which 13 were used for autosomal analysis (right image). The overall data situates the southeastern group (Bulgarians and Macedonians) in a cluster with Romanians, and they are at similar proximity to <b>Gagauzes,</b> Montenegrins and Serbs who are not part of another cluster but are described as 'in between' clusters. Macedonians and Romanians consistingly keep being among most related to Bulgarians by au, mt, and Y-DNA a conclusion backed also by a pan-European autosomal study investigating 500,568 SNP (loci) of 1,387 Europeans and including 1 or 2 Bulgarians, other more or less extensive data sets situate Bulgarians and Romanians as their nearest [...] Per HLA-DRB1 allele frequencies Bulgarians are also in a cluster with the same populations. The Balto-Slavic study itself calculated genetic distance by SNP data of the multiple autosomes and ranked most proximal to Bulgarians the Serbs, followed by Macedonians, Montenegrins, Romanians, <b>Gagauzes,</b> Macedonian Greeks apart from Thessaloniki, the rest of the South Slavs, Hungarians, Slovaks, Czechs, and then by Greeks from Thessaloniki, Central Greece and Peloponese. The East Slavs and Poles cluster together remaining less proximal to Bulgarians than Germans, among whom Slav admixture is also observed. Balts, however, according to the PCA analysis are less proximal to Bulgarians than Italians for example are. Bulgarians are also only modestly close to their eastern neighbours - the Anatolian Turks, suggesting the presence of certain geographic and cultural barriers between them. Despite various invasions of Altaic-speaking peoples in Europe, no significant impact from such Asian descent is recorded throughout southern and central Europe.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} Turkic {{languages}} did not partake {{in the development}} of the Turki literary tradition, and were either unaffected by the common trends carried by the Turki, or affected only indirectly through the neighboring languages that were impacted by the Turki. The languages not affected directly were culturally separated from the Islamic influence by religious affiliations or geographical isolation. Among such nations were Chuvashes, <b>Gagauzes,</b> Hungarian Kipchaks, Bulgars, Szeklers, and other Hungarian Türkic subdivisions, western Tatars in Poland, Baltic states, Belarus, Russia and Ukraine, Siberian Türkic nations, modern Uigurs, nations that later formed Southern and Northern Altaians, and the Sakha people. The isolation of these people from the influence and innovations of the Turki facilitated preservation in their languages of the original forms and lexicons, now used for philological studies and comparative linguistics. The western European nations in the Christian sphere of influence were separated by religious and cultural barriers, and within the Christian sphere by different and frequently conflicting denominations and local linguistic barriers. The Siberian Türks from the beginning retained their independence from the Islamic influence, and largely preserved their Tengrian religion. The eastern Türkic nations fell under the influence of the Mongol Empire, and remained culturally affiliated with the Chingizid states after the fragmentation of the Mongol Empire.|$|R
5000|$|The overall {{profile of}} 808 Bulgarian samples, {{according}} {{to a level of}} phylogenetic analysis calculating distribution of hgs R1a1a7, R1а1, R1b1a2, R2a, I, E1b1, E1b1b1, E1b1b1a, E1b1b1b, J2b, J2a, J2a1b, J1, G, T, NO, C, H, Q, L, A and B, is positioned nearest to the Romanians per 147 their samples, also backed by studies as early as 2000. However the analysis of the Bulgarian study showed inaccuracy in some aspects using population datasets which proved to contain genetic drift {{according to a}}lternative more extensive studies on these populations. Furthermore, the analysis did not even involve the populations Macedonians, Serbians, Montenegrins and Slovaks. It is unclear why the extensive datasets and the most proximal Slavic populations to the Bulgarians were excluded from the phylogenetic analysis of the Bulgarian study selectively. The study of the 149 Romanians by whose data they came out most proximal to Bulgarians concludes that Romanians are closer to Ukrainians and Hungarians than to the Bulgarian group sampled by the study. Bulgarians are situated nearer to populations such as Berbers and Sudanese than to Turks and Poles, because all subclades of J and E-M78 are counted together. This situation would not be the same if the analysis calculates distance by considering more recent subclades, e.g. J2 and J1 instead of J, or EV13 instead of EM78, similarly Y-DNA analyses of distribution of haplogroups of pre-Mesolithic age determine Norwegians and Sardinians more proximal to Bulgarians than Poles and Russians. Some central Europeans are situated very distant per data of the phylogenetic Bulgarian study because of scarce datasets containing remarkable genetic drift. For most compared European peoples datasets were taken from Battaglia (2008) which does not involve more than 100 samples per population. The largest-scale study of the Hungarians (n=230) determined that the remaining Finno-Urgic peoples are genetically their furthest populations, and clearly confirmed that the closest Europeans to the Hungarians are the Bulgarians, however the same study determines the Yugoslavs as the nearest population to Bulgarians. Similarly, despite linguistic influence, the contribution of Uralics to the modern Hungarian genetic pool is weak as the contribution of Bulgars to the modern Bulgarian genetic pool is hardly recognisable. [...] According to DNA data for 17 Y-chromosomal STR loci in Macedonians, the Macedonian population has the lowest genetic distance against the Bulgarian population (0.0815). Other Y-DNA studies considered the Bulgarians closest either to Macedonians, Serbs, Bulgarian Turks or <b>Gagauzes,</b> followed either by some of these or by Romanians, or Bosniaks.|$|R
40|$|The {{territory}} of present-day Ukraine is subdivided into some regions with specific demographic and politic history. Nevertheless, the corresponding subdivision in genetic structure is not revealed in previous investigations: populations of Ukrainians under study were genetically homogeneous on SNP markers of Y chromosome. In {{the current investigation}} we studied the Y-chromosomal genetic structure of Transcarpathia and Bukovina populations. Several factors exist to expect the genetic specificity of these populations. Both ones are placed in the Carpathian foothills, at the south-western border of the Ukrainian area. During the last millennium these territories were the parts of different states and were open for ethnically diverse migrations. It was revealed that the major Y chromosomal haplogroups in Transcarpathia population were R 1 a 1 a 1 *(М 198), I 2 a (Р 37. 2), R 1 a 1 a 1 g (М 458), E 1 b 1 b 1 a 1 (M 78). The major haplogroups in Bukovina population were I 2 a (Р 37. 2), R 1 a 1 a 1 *(М 198), R 1 a 1 a 1 g (М 458), R 1 b 1 b 2 (М 269), E 1 b 1 b 1 a 1 (M 78), I 1 (М 253). The Bukovina population differs from the typical Ukrainian population by higher frequency of I 2 a (Р 37. 2) and lower frequency of R 1 a 1 a 1 *(М 198). Moreover, {{this is the only}} population among ones studied in Ukraine where the most frequent haplogroup is I 2 a (Р 37. 2) but not R 1 a 1 a 1 *(М 198). Such a deviation can be caused by possible mixing with neighbouring southern groups, and Carpathian mountains were not a border for exchange in this case. Interestingly, the haplogroup N 1 c (M 178) is not revealed in Transcarpathia at all, obviously due to the mountain barrier. It was revealed by principal component analysis that Ukrainians from Transcarpathia and Bukovina despite some specific peculiarities are more similar to other Ukrainian populations than to the surrounding ethnic groups such as Poles, Slovaks, Hungarians, Romanians, Moldavians and <b>Gagauzes.</b> Ukrainians of Transcarpathia and Bukovina form the entire genetic continuum with the whole Ukraine on maps of gene distances, confirming the homogeneity of Ukrainian parental gene pool and it’s differentiation from other groups. After performing the analysis of Y-haplogroup spatial distribution, it is supposed that the northern ridges ofCarpathian mountainsare the East-European barrier decreasing the gene flow. It decreases the spreading of haplogroups N 1 c (М 178) and R 1 a (М 198) southward and movement of E 1 b (М 78), R 1 b (М 269), J (М 304) and G (М 201) northward...|$|R
