5|$|House {{was filmed}} {{on one of}} Toho's largest sets, where Obayashi shot the film without a {{storyboard}} {{over a period of}} about two months. Obayashi described the attitude on the set as very upbeat as he often skipped, sang and played quiz games with the younger actresses on the set. Despite having <b>fun</b> <b>on</b> the set, members of the Toho crew felt the film was nonsense. Obayashi found the acting of the seven girls to be poor while trying to direct them verbally. He began playing the film's soundtrack on set, which changed the way the girls were acting in the film as they got into the spirit of the music. Actress Kimiko Ikegami was uncomfortable about a nude scene in the film. To make her more comfortable, Yoko Minamida also took off her clothes. After Obayashi saw Minamida nude, he included a nude scene for her in the film which was not in the original script.|$|E

She is highly suspicious of Bodger and believes that he is hiding something in his hotel, although she never actually finds out about Badger. She refuses to recommend Bodger's hotel to tourists because he accidentally covered her in mashed potato when she visited his B & B. She dislikes people having <b>fun</b> <b>on</b> the beach outside her office and {{will do anything to}} prevent it. She has a lot of trouble with China the dog, who is always hanging around her office. She often looks for quick ways to make money, such as when she attempts to catch a valuable bird and charge people to see it, and when she believes Bodger has won the lottery she buys him lunch and starts being nice to him in the hope that he will share some of his winnings with her.|$|E

500|$|Retrospective reviewers {{recommended}} {{the game for}} those who mastered the original, or those who would appreciate painful challenge.

GamesRadar and IGN agreed with Nintendo of America's choice against releasing the harder game in the 1980s, though Eurogamer thought that The Lost Levels was [...] "technically a much better game" [...] than the Doki Doki Panic-based Super Mario Bros. 2 the American market received instead.|$|E

Later, she auditioned for a role on the series Sonny with a Chance, which she also received. Lovato enlisted the Jonas Brothers, her Camp Rock co-stars, to work with her on her debut studio album, Don't Forget (2008).

The Glassheart Tour was scheduled to visit twenty-one venues across Germany and the United Kingdom. The tour was expected to begin on 15 April in Berlin.

500|$|In 1998, Lukather {{received}} {{an invitation to}} tour Japan with fellow guitarist Larry Carlton after Japanese promoters requested that Carlton's annual tours each {{be different from the}} last. Lukather and Carlton exchanged some recorded material and decided that a collaboration would be interesting. Lukather was flattered by the invitation to tour with Carlton, citing him as his favorite guitarist. Lukather speaks highly of their stage efforts, although the two were admittedly outside their normal realm of work. He stated in an interview that [...] "you can hear us having <b>fun</b> <b>on</b> the record—you can hear the smiles on our faces." [...] After several shows, the duo realized that they should record their collaboration even if just for their own use. Guitarist and producer Steve Vai heard one of the subsequent recordings and expressed interest in releasing it under his Favored Nations label, also home to such artists as Eric Johnson and Dweezil Zappa. Vai and Lukather mixed and produced the recording, which {{is said to be a}} mixture of jazz, blues, and fusion music. The resulting album, , won a 2001 Grammy award for Best Pop Instrumental Album. Album reviewers described Lukather as having a heavier style than Carlton. Lukather and Carlton later did an international tour in support of the album.|$|E

500|$|In {{spite of}} noting that Diplo makes Madonna sound <b>fun</b> <b>on</b> the song, Gavin Haynes of NME {{commented that the}} song's {{composition}} [...] "showed the gulf between [...] life and her music is now impossible to ignore". Calling it [...] "awry", Alexis Petridis of The Guardian claimed that [...] "Bitch I'm Madonna" [...] is [...] "a fantastic title {{in search of a}} song. In lieu of one, producer Diplo comes up with a kind of hybrid of EDM and happy hardcore and throws Nicki Minaj at her most hyperactive into the mix; the result genuinely sets your teeth on edge." [...] Criticizing Rebel Heart for being [...] "overworked", Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine found that [...] "the duality of its title [...] muddled by the inclusion of garish party jams like the infuriatingly catchy but lyrically cringe-inducing 'Bitch I'm Madonna'". John Murphy of musicOMH remarked that the song [...] "never quite lives up to its fantastic title, and just sounds a bit of a mess, trying to cram in Diplo-produced dance-hall rhythms, a dubstep breakdown and the seemingly now obligatory Nicki Minaj guest rap". Evan Sawdey of PopMatters opined that the song—and another Rebel Heart track, [...] "Illuminati"—"absolutely reek of desperation, wanting so badly to shock and offend listeners that they fail to resolve as satisfying songs first and foremost".|$|E
500|$|Manning's film {{credits include}} {{the lead role}} in the 1986 Ozploitation film Dead End Drive-In. Based on a Peter Carey short story called [...] "Crabs", Dead End Drive-In is a post-apocalyptic tale about a young man {{stranded}} in a small town's drive-in theater when the wheels are stolen off his car. He finds himself amongst a community of misfits trapped at the site, and seeks to break out. The film, directed by Brian Trenchard-Smith, received mixed reviews: Tim Kroenert writing for Eureka Street described it as [...] "Mad Max-lite" [...] {{and said that the}} film [...] "is an example of how literality of translation can result in the sacrifice of the story’s essence. The film is <b>fun</b> <b>on</b> its own terms, but much of the nuance and irony that lend ‘Crabs’ its magic are simply lost". Philippa Hawker writing for The Age said the film was [...] "an energetic, inventively designed, cheerfully satirical and entertaining film", and it is one of American film director Quentin Tarantino's favourites. The film received only a short box-office season; Manning was critical of the distributor Greater Union and worked with the film's other actors to secure separate release in independent cinemas. Manning's other film credits include an appearance in the teen film Looking for Alibrandi. He has also made a short film, Love Bites. Manning's television credits include Bodyline, The Shiralee [...] and Brides of Christ.|$|E
500|$|In comparison, {{reviews of}} the Game Boy Advance re-release of the game were mostly positive.

They further stated that while the game's characters seemed unlikable and that the plot felt [...] "predictable or trite", they felt the game was still more sophisticated than most games at the time, giving the game a score of 8.5. Nintendo Power stated that [...] "while playing Final Fantasy V is a chore on the PlayStation, it's good <b>fun</b> <b>on</b> the GBA because of the vastly improved translation and new features", further calling it the [...] "definitive" [...] version {{of one of the}} series' best titles. IGN gave the game a score of 8.5, calling it a [...] "must-own" [...] for the portable system and describing it further as always an [...] "entertaining and surprisingly deep role-playing game". 1UP.com stated the port of the game from the Super Famicom to the Game Boy Advance was [...] "rock solid", and added that while the game's story started off at a slow pace, it gradually improved. The review further praised the addition of features and removal of questionable ones that had been added to the Anthology version of the game. GameDaily gave the game a score of 7/10, noting that while enjoyable, the high encounter rate, the necessity to constantly engage in battle to gain abilities through the job system, and other aspects made the game feel repetitive at times.|$|E
