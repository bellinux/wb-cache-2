Sheer from under his elbows fell the cliff, five hundred and seven feet of it down to the <b>datum</b> <b>line,</b> and the sea-birds eddied and soared below him. The upper part of the cliff was a greenish chalky rock, the lower two-thirds a warm red, marbled with gypsum bands, and from half-a-dozen places spurted jets of water, to fall in long cascades down its face. The swell frothed white on the flinty beach, and the water beyond where the shadows of an outstanding rock lay, was green and purple in a thousand tints and marked with streaks and flakes of foam. The air was full of sunlight and the tinkling of the little waterfalls and the slow soughing of the seas below. Now and then a butterfly flickered over the face of the cliff, and a multitude of sea birds perched and flew hither and thither.|$|E

A number of our guests had an air of waiting for a clue that never came, and stood and sat about silently, mildly amused but not a bit surprised that we did not discover their distinctive Open-Sesames. There was a sprinkling of manifest seers and prophetesses in shapeless garments, far too many, I thought, for really easy social intercourse, and any conversation at any moment was liable to become oracular. One was in a state of tension from first to last; the most innocent remark seemed capable of exploding resentment, and replies came out at the most unexpected angles. We Young Liberals went about puzzled but polite to the gathering we had evoked. The Young Liberals' tradition is on the whole wonderfully discreet, superfluous steam is let out far away from home in the Balkans or Africa, and the neat, stiff figures of the Cramptons, Bunting Harblow, and Lewis, either in extremely well-cut morning coats indicative of the House, or in what is sometimes written of as [...] "faultless evening dress," [...] stood about on those evenings, they and their very quietly and simply and expensively dressed little wives, like a <b>datum</b> <b>line</b> amidst lakes and mountains.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a technique for measuring micromachining cutting tool dimensions. The technique uses machine vision and a geometric modeling platform (CAD software) {{as the means}} of constructing the 3 -D shape of a cutting tool and obtaining the 3 -D metrological data. In the technique, a sequence of images is obtained by continuously varying {{the distance between the}} cutting tool surface and the image detector. The focus information from the obtained images provides the 3 -D shape of the cutting tool. In addition 3 -D metrological measurement is conducted by a micro-coordinate measuring system. In the system, the 3 -D shape of the cutting tool is converted into the form of IGES file. The IGES file is read by the geometric modeling platform (IDEAS). The available tools in the geometric modeling platform can be used as the coordinate measuring means. In particular, pointing tool {{can be used as a}} "virtual touch probe". The system provides the capability of measuring linear and angular quantities, establishing <b>datum</b> <b>lines</b> and planes from the imported shape of the cutting tool. The capability can be useful for measuring tool wear. Experimental results are presented and discussed to demonstrate the technique...|$|R

50|$|Mean Aerodynamic Chord (MAC): A {{specific}} {{chord line}} of a tapered wing. At the mean aerodynamic chord, the center of pressure has the same aerodynamic force, position, and area as it does {{on the rest of}} the wing.

In order to make such a calculation, the position of the leading edge of the MAC must be known ahead of time. This position is defined as a distance from the reference datum and is found in the aircraft's flight manual and also on the aircraft's type certificate data sheet. If a general MAC is not given but a LeMAC (leading edge mean aerodynamic chord) and a TeMAC (trailing edge mean aerodynamic chord) are given (both of which would be referenced as an arm measured out from the <b>datum</b> <b>line)</b> then your MAC can be found by finding the difference between your LeMAC and your TeMAC.|$|E

40|$|As {{the first}} design-build-fabricate-assemble {{experiment}} at our school, {{the intent of}} the studio was to design a framework from which to examine a “lived space” through digital-to-digital processes. Moving from digital models and physical stereo lithographic models to hand-fabrication and digital assembly allowed the students to move from creation to completion. As part of our holistic design process, the studio fabricated almost all components for the project. These elements include the wood flooring, the copper and wood skins, the buildingis structural panels, and the two-story light vortex. This single-family, in-fill house is located within an historic downtown neighborhood and is subject to historic district zoning regulations, design guidelines, and Board of Architecture Review approvals. The project is analogous to design challenges presenting themselves in historic districts throughout the United States including the Savannah, Georgia site for the 2005 ACADIA Conference. The scale of the project relates well to the horizontal nature of this context and after a formal, televised review process with the local Board of Architecture Review, the project represents a dynamic, yet sympathetic architectural dialogue with the surrounding buildings. The project develops simultaneously from the exterior and interior resulting in two courtyards that mediate the urban “front doori and the private “terrace. ” The students designed these areas through a series of two-dimensional axonometric drawings, three-dimensional physical and digital models, and four-dimensional time-based animations. The building massing separates into two core elements: gabled copper volume and wood screen volume. These elements maintain their conceptual purity by using the same types of modulations on their skins. The copper form with its deep-cut reveals and proportionally placed light scoring patterns reflects the horizontal <b>datum</b> <b>lines</b> of the floor, sill, threshold, and ceiling. In contrast, the wood volume reflects these same lines as applied “shadow screens” which create depths that seamlessly tie together the side, rear, and front facades. The hinge point of the house is the light vortex. Designed in Rhino, translated in Catia, fabricated out of aluminum, and clad in stainless steel, this two-story sculptural element will literally wrap light around its surfaces. Like a sunflower, the light vortex, with its angel hair stainless steel finish, responds to the incremental differentiation of light throughout the day. Photosensitive floor-mounted lights designed to augment the volume of natural light will provide a continuous light rendition on the sculpture. The project, scheduled for completion {{at the end of the}} 2005 summer session, is at the time of this submission about 60 % complete...|$|R
