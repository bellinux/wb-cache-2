Mil e oito pintos machos de um dia de idade foram distribuídos em 14 tratamentos, com 6 repetições de 12 aves cada, em delineamento inteiramente ao acaso. Os fosfatos avaliados foram o defluorizado, monocálcico B, bicálcico A, bicálcico B e bicálcico C, com dois níveis de fósforo disponível (0, 30 e 0, 40 %). Foi adotada a técnica da {{abscissa}} e o fosfato monocálcico A como padrão (valor 100 %), com quatro níveis de fósforo disponível: 0, 25, 0, 35, 0, 45 e 0, 55 % para o cálculo da biodisponibilidade relativa. Todos os fosfatos com 0, 40 % do fósforo disponível proporcionaram às aves ganho de peso semelhante. Houve maior mineralização óssea das aves com o fosfato monocálcico B, comparado ao fosfato defluorizado. As fontes de fósforo apresentaram pequenas diferenças nos valores de biodisponibilidade relativa, com melhores resultados quanto ao monocálcico B e com maior sensibilidade de resposta da variável cinzas ósseas, em relação ao ganho de peso.

40|$|The {{chemical}} immobilization of Pb and As in {{contaminated soil}} from Lavrion, Greece, using <b>monocalcium</b> <b>phosphate</b> and ferrous sulfate as stabilizing agents was investigated. <b>Monocalcium</b> <b>phosphate</b> {{was added to}} contaminated soil at PO 4 to Pb molar ratios equal to 0, 0. 5, 1, 1. 5 and 2. 5, whereas ferrous sulfate was added at Fe to As molar ratios equal to 0, 2. 5, 5, 10 and 20. Phosphates addition to contaminated soil decreased Pb leachability, but resulted in significant mobilization of As. Simultaneous immobilization of Pb and As was obtained only when soil was treated with mixtures of phosphates and ferrous sulfate. Arsenic uptake by plants was also seen to increase when soil was treated only with phosphates, but co-addition of ferrous sulfate was efficient in maintaining As phytoaccumulation at low levels. The addition of at least 1. 5 M/M phosphates and 10 M/M iron sulfate to soil reduced the dissolved levels of Pb and As in the water extracts to values {{in compliance with the}} EU drinking water standards. However, both additives contributed in the acidification of soil, decreasing pH from 7. 8 to values as low as 5. 6 and induced the mobilization of pH sensitive elements, such as Zn and Cd.

High resolution solid state 31 P and 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance were used to characterize this complex and to monitor the structural changes occurring to it during an 8 -week incubation period in a loamy soil. A pot experiment was conducted on the two soils after labelling the available P with 32 PO 4 ions. This experiment allowed for the determination of the agronomic effectiveness of the chitosan-polyphosphate complex compared to polyphosphate and to <b>monocalcium</b> <b>phosphate.</b> Results showed that chitosan immobilized up to 147 mg P kg– 1 as pyrophosphate and hexametaphosphate. This reaction did not involve major structural changes in the pyrophosphate or hexametaphosphate groups nor in the chitosan.
