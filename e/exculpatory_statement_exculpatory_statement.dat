5000|$|... 1971 - Appeared in the Supreme Court {{on behalf}} of the Crown in the matter of Ruth Thelma Piche. The major issues {{involved}} the right to silence, the voluntariness of inculpatory statements, and the admissibility of inconsistencies between <b>exculpatory</b> <b>statements</b> given at different times. Piche, pre-Charter and prior to the landmark of R v Lavallee, is an early burning bed case.|$|R
50|$|Cousin filed a {{civil suit}} against a number of {{employees}} {{of the police department}} and district attorney's office. He alleged a number of violations of his civil rights. He alleged that the prosecution withheld a number of <b>exculpatory</b> <b>statements,</b> coerced and intimidated Rowell, and took steps to prevent his own defense witnesses from testifying on his behalf by illegally detaining them. The courts ruled against him on the basis that prosecutors have absolute immunity.|$|R
50|$|The appeal failed. The three appeal judges {{reached a}} split {{decision}} on whether the fresh evidence relating to Love's testimony (and relating to a potentially <b>exculpatory</b> <b>statement</b> made to the police by Love's sister, which had not been disclosed to the Defence at the trial) would have significantly affected {{the outcome of the}} original trial, and thus should be heard. Lord Cullen and Lord Sutherland both opined that it would have not, with Lord McCluskey dissenting. Campbell and Steele were returned to prison.|$|R
25|$|Miranda v. Arizona, , was a {{landmark}} {{decision of the}} United States Supreme Court. In a 5–4 majority, the Court held that both inculpatory and <b>exculpatory</b> <b>statements</b> made in response to interrogation by a defendant in police custody will be admissible at trial only if the prosecution can show that the defendant was informed {{of the right to}} consult with an attorney before and during questioning and of the right against self-incrimination before police questioning, and that the defendant not only understood these rights, but voluntarily waived them.|$|R
5000|$|... "Hearsay is a statement, {{other than}} one {{made by the}} {{declarant}} while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove {{the truth of the}} matter asserted." [...] Per Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(a), a statement made by a defendant is admissible as evidence only if it is inculpatory; <b>exculpatory</b> <b>statements</b> made to an investigator are hearsay and therefore may not be admitted as evidence in court, unless the defendant testifies. When an out-of-court statement offered as evidence contains another out-of-court statement it is called double hearsay, and both layers of hearsay must be found separately admissible.|$|R

As a concomitant of that right, a recent United States Supreme Court decision held that {{a defendant}} 2 ̆ 7 s failure to offer <b>exculpatory</b> <b>statements</b> during such an investigation may not be used in the subsequent trial for the purpose of impeachment as a prior inconsistent statement.

50|$|In April 1937 von Cramm was interrogated by Gestapo {{about his}} {{intimate}} relationship with Herbst. A rent boy had denounced him {{and others from}} hearsay of Berlin's gay scene, some falsely. For the Nazis the denunciation of von Cramm was just a minor offshoot of the big Blomberg-Fritsch Affair. In an effort to minimise his sentence von Cramm tried to reduce the duration of his liaison with Herbst to the time before the aggravation of the anti-gay laws {{which took place in}} 1935. In an <b>exculpatory</b> <b>statement</b> he also claimed to be blackmailed by Herbst in order to avoid a harsh sentence for a breach of exchange control regulations. Gottfried von Cramm was sentenced to one year in jail but came out on probation after seven months. His mother had intervened and met Hermann Göring {{who was a member of}} the Rot-Weiss Tennis Club where von Cramm originated.|$|R
5000|$|Scrope's {{involvement}} in the conspiracy surprised contemporaries, and continues to puzzle historians. Ian Mortimer claims Scrope had merely insinuated himself into the confidence of Cambridge and Grey in order to betray the conspiracy, just as Edward, Duke of York had done with the Epiphany Rising in 1400, but was forestalled by Edmund Mortimer's revelation of the conspiracy to the King on 31 July. Pugh, however, finds Scrope's <b>exculpatory</b> <b>statements</b> at trial unconvincing, and states that Scrope never pretended that he had intended to inform the King of the conspiracy. Pugh also contends that [...] "there was no plot in 1415 to assassinate Henry V and his three brothers and that heinous charge, {{by far the most}} sensational in the indictment, was fabricated to ensure that Cambridge, Gray and Scrope did not escape the death penalty as a well-deserved punishment for the various other offences that they undoubtedly had committed".|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} detect deception, in {{everyday}} social interactions and psychological evaluations, can literally {{mean the difference between}} life and death. Beyond physiological and nonverbal techniques for detecting deception, research has focused on criteria designed to evaluate the content of verbal statements to distinguish between true or actually experienced events versus internally manufactured or fabricated events. Criteria from two techniques that have received empirical support, criteria-based content analysis and reality monitoring, were used to create an 11 -item Deception Detection Checklist (DDCL). In this study, 130 college undergraduates used the DDCL to rate the <b>exculpatory</b> <b>statements</b> of two accused child molesters: one truthful, the other untruthful. The 11 items composing the DDCL, as well as a measure of perceived truthfulness, were all scored on 7 -point Likert-type scales. Nine of the 11 items on the DDCL significantly differentiated between the true and untrue statements in the predicted direction. Overall scores on the DDCL indicated that the false statement was rated as significantly more deceptive than the true statement. The DDCL possessed good reliability, and a series of factor analyses provided strong support for the construct validity of the measure. The 7 psychometrically strongest items from the DDCL included variables assessing the extent to which statements included clarity of detail, spatial details, temporal details, and contextual details, as well as the relevance, reconstructability, and realism of the statement. These results indicate that subjects were able to use this measure to reliably differentiate between true and false statements made by accused child molesters...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} study uses a verbal content analysis measure, the Forensic Assessment of Client Truthfulness, {{derived from the}} most empirically-supported measures in deception detection (i. e. Criterion-Based Content Analysis and Reality Monitoring). This measure is employed in the study to distinguish between true and false statements in forensic psychological evaluations. The study contains four research conditions including the true and false statements of men accused of sex offenses and of men claiming an insanity defense. Using a repeated measures design, the four statements were rated by 127 university students. Using factor analyses, ANOVA analyses, and t-tests, {{the results showed that}} the eight items composing the FACT all significantly differentiate between true and false statements. Further, the FACT is able to differentiate between different types of false statements (i. e. lies of commission and lies of omission) and different types of true <b>statements</b> (i. e. confessions and <b>exculpatory</b> <b>statements).</b> The results also suggest that that truth is a multidimensional construct containing two types of information: statement details (e. g. clarity of detail) and statement quality (e. g. realism). Concluding a statement is true involves a one-step cognitive process in which attributes of truthfulness are present. However, concluding a statement is false involves a two-step cognitive process in which attributes of truthfulness are absent and attributes of untruthfulness are present. This poster describes how to use the FACT, whether informally or as a structured test, as an adjunct to clinical judgment in ascertaining client veracity, a concern in the criminal justice system...|$|R

40|$|For {{approximately}} {{the last fifteen}} years, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police have been mounting highly sophisticated undercover sting operations in Canada known colloquially as Mr. Big stings. These undercover operations involve multiple officers posing {{as members of a}} ruthless, powerful and wealthy criminal organization in order to trick suspects into making confessions to serious crimes, nearly always homicides. The undercover officers essentially orchestrate a chance meeting with the suspect, known operationally as the “target”, and exert their considerable influence and resources to convince him that he is being inducted into a criminal gang. The target is typically a person suspected of having committed a murder in the past, but who has never been charged due to lack of evidence. Over a period of months or weeks the undercover officers attempt to build a relationship with the target based on fear, greed, companionship, or a combination of those or other emotions. The target is given tasks to perform which appear criminal in nature, but which are actually staged crimes in which every participant is an undercover officer. The target is eventually told he must meet with the boss of the gang, the “Mr. Big” after whom the sting is named, in order for a final decision to be made on whether or not the target can join the gang. The target is told that he must confess to the previous murder of which he is suspected in order to join the gang. Sometimes the target confesses readily, other times he protests his innocence, but Mr. Big will not accept <b>exculpatory</b> <b>statements.</b> Often further inducements are offered by Mr. Big, most notably a promise to derail the investigation by using his influence over corrupt justice system participants. If the suspect admits culpability he will be charged with the crime and nearly always convicted at trial. Canadian courts have exercised virtually no control over police tactics in these cases. Defence counsel have argued against the use of the evidence {{on the basis of a}} breach of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms with regard to the right to silence and also with regard to abuse of process. These arguments have been unsuccessful. Defence counsel have also argued unsuccessfully that the statements should be inadmissible under Canadian hearsay law. It has also been argued, equally unsuccessfully, that the undercover operators should be treated as persons-in-authority, and hence that the statements elicited from the targets should have to be proven voluntary beyond a reasonable doubt. Canadian judges have also been unwilling to allow the defence to lead expert evidence in these cases to tell the trier of fact about the possibility of false confessions. The ultimate result is that there is no control over police tactics in these stings. There has been one proven wrongful conviction as a result of these stings, that of Kyle Wayne Unger. Other wrongful convictions may come to light. Short of its outright abolition, probably the best way to control the sting and prevent wrongful convictions is to subject the statements to a formal voluntariness inquiry...|$|R

50|$|A {{victim is}} murdered by {{stabbing}} and a suspect is arrested for the murder. Evidence includes a knife {{covered with blood}} found near the victim and the accused found covered in blood at the murder scene. During the investigation, the police interview a witness claiming to have seen the stabbing. The witness makes {{a statement to the}} police that another unidentified person committed the crime, not the accused. The witness's <b>statement</b> is <b>exculpatory</b> evidence as it introduces reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused. The police either do not believe the witness's account or else find the witness unreliable and choose not to follow up on the lead. The prosecutor is obliged to inform the accused and his or her attorney of the witness's statement even though the police doubt the witness's version of events. Failure to do so would provide grounds for a motion to dismiss the charges or an appeal of a subsequent guilty verdict.|$|R
40|$|Court-ordered {{psychological}} {{evaluations of}} criminal defendants generally include two types: mental status (competence or sanity) versus risk assessment. When defendants are deceptive in mental status evaluations, lies of commission, in which symptoms of psychopathology are feigned (malingering), are most likely. When defendants are deceptive in risk assessments, lies of omission, in which antisocial impulses are concealed or denied, are most likely. Four research conditions, {{consisting of the}} true and false statements of two men accused of sex offenses and two men claiming an insanity defense, were rated by participants on a test of truthfulness containing eight items derived from Criterion-Based Content Analysis and Reality Monitoring. All items, {{as well as the}} collective test score, significantly differentiated between true and false statements. Further, the lie of commission was rated as significantly more false than the lie of omission, and a confession was rated as more truthful than a true <b>statement</b> involving only <b>exculpatory</b> information, which is in accordance with the theory of cognitive load. Factor analyses provided support for the construct validity of the test of truthfulness and two subscales. Further, the data suggests that statements judged true are characterized by the presence of attributes of truthfulness, while statements judged false are characterized by the absence of attributes of truthfulness along with the presence of attributes of untruthfulness...|$|R
