40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{investigate}} epidemiological and health economic aspects of dementia and drug use in older people, through economic modelling and analyses of population-based studies. The major findings from the separate studies are summarized below. Study I We aimed to investigate whether dementia was associated with higher drug costs in 4, 108 participants aged ≥ 60 years from the Swedish National Study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen and Nordanstig (SNAC-K and SNAC-N). Overall, the average crude cost of drug use was 6, 147 SEK per year for people with dementia and 3, 810 SEK per year for people without dementia. The cost of nervous system drugs was {{more than five times}} higher in persons with dementia than without. However, the higher crude costs for drug use in people with dementia were confounded by comorbidities and residential setting. In fact, the strongest drug cost driver was comorbidity followed by residential setting. Study II We aimed to investigate inappropriate drug use (IDU) and risk of hospitalizations and mortality in older persons and in persons with dementia and to also estimate the costs of IDU-related hospitalizations. In this study, based on data from SNAC-K and SNAC-N, the National Patient Register and the Cause of Death Register, we used logistic and Cox regression models to analyse associations between IDU, hospitalizations and mortality in the whole study population and in the subpopulation of persons with dementia. We found a higher risk of hospitalization (adjusted OR= 1. 46; 95 % CI 1. 18 - 1. 81) and mortality (adjusted HR= 1. 15; 95 % CI 1. 01 - 1. 31) in the whole study population and with hospitalization (adjusted OR= 1. 88; 95 % CI 1. 03 - 3. 43) in the subpopulation of persons with dementia, after adjustment for confounding factors. There was also a tendency for higher costs for hospitalizations with IDU than without IDU, although not statistically significant. Study III We aimed to describe the costs of an incident cohort of persons with dementia through simulation modelling. With input from epidemiological data, the Markov model estimated approximately 24, 000 incident cases of dementia in Sweden in 2005. The incident cohort was run in the model <b>for</b> <b>ten</b> <b>cycles</b> of one year each. State specific costs were used and defined by the Clinical Dementia Rating scale. Results of the simulation showed that the total costs of the cohort were 27. 7 billion SEK. The average annual cost of one person with dementia was 269, 558 SEK. The severe state of dementia accounted for the largest proportion of costs for incident dementia cases. Costs of drugs in dementia only accounted for about 2 % of the costs in the model. The main cost driver was institutional care, even for mild dementia. Study IV We aimed to introduce a hypothetical economic model of a disease modifying treatment (DMT) for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We created a Markov model built on Swedish conditions with two arms; one representing the hypothetical treatment and the other arm representing no treatment. States and progression of the disease were defined with Mini Mental State Examination. Epidemiological data of incidence, prevalence and costs of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), studies of conversion from MCI to AD and official statistics were used as input in the model. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio was 293, 002 SEK/Quality Adjusted Life Year. The treated persons showed increased survival (8. 7 years) versus the non-treated persons (7. 8 years). With a societal willingness to pay of 600, 000 SEK, the hypothetical treatment can be considered as cost effective. The main reasons for the higher costs with DMT were the costs of DMT itself and the prolonged survival with DMT. Conclusion: The observed higher crude drug costs in dementia were confounded by comorbidities and residential setting. We also found that IDU was associated with an increased risk of hospitalization and mortality among older persons. This underlines the need for cautious prescribing to elderly patients. However, further studies are needed to investigate the association between IDU and costs for hospitalizations. The highest accumulated costs in dementia occur in severe dementia and the major cost driver is institutionalization, even in mild dementia. Drugs, on the other hand, constitute only a minor part of the total costs. Our study of a hypothetical DMT showed that DMT in AD is projected as not being cost saving if the treatment prolongs survival. Still, if a societal willingness-to pay level of 600, 000 SEK is adopted, the treatment can be considered as cost effective...|$|E

40|$|Future NASA {{missions}} are increasingly seeking to use actuators for precision positioning to accuracies {{of the order}} of fractions of a nanometer. For this purpose, multilayer piezoelectric stacks are being considered as actuators for driving these precision mechanisms. In this study, sets of commercial PZT stacks were tested in various AC and DC conditions at both nominal and extreme temperatures and voltages. AC signal testing included impedance, capacitance and dielectric loss factor of each actuator {{as a function of the}} small-signal driving sinusoidal frequency, and the ambient temperature. DC signal testing includes leakage current and displacement as a function of the applied DC voltage. The applied DC voltage was increased to over eight times the manufacturers' specifications to investigate the correlation between leakage current and breakdown voltage. Resonance characterization as a function of temperature was done over a temperature range of - 180 C to + 200 C which generally exceeded the manufacturers' specifications. In order to study the lifetime performance of these stacks, five actuators from one manufacturer were driven by a 60 volt, 2 kHz sine-wave <b>for</b> <b>ten</b> billion <b>cycles.</b> The tests were performed using a Lab-View controlled automated data acquisition system that monitored the waveform of the stack electrical current and voltage. The measurements included the displacement, impedance, capacitance and leakage current and the analysis of the experimental results will be presented...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{presents}} a strategic oxidative desulfurization system able to efficiently operate under sustainable conditions, i. e. using an eco-friendly oxidant {{and without the}} need of extractive organic solvents. The catalytic performance of Eu(PW 11 O 39) 2 @aptesSBA- 15 was evaluated for the oxidative desulfurization of a multicomponent model diesel using a solvent-free or biphasic systems. The results reveal its remarkable desulfurization performance achieving complete desulfurization after just 2 h of reaction. Moreover, the composite has shown a high recycling ability without loss of catalytic activity <b>for</b> <b>ten</b> consecutive ODS <b>cycles.</b> Interestingly, under solvent-free conditions {{it was possible to}} maintain the desulfurization efficiency of the biphasic system while being able to avoid the use of harmful organic solvents. In this case, a successful extraction of oxidized sulfur compounds was found conciliating centrifugation and water as extraction solvent. Therefore, this work reports an important step towards the development of novel eco-sustainable desulfurization systems with high industrial interest. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

40|$|Automation in an {{industry}} using programmable logic controller (PLC) can be enumerated by optimizing the use of process control equipment, decreases the response time for process and equipment contingencies, provides information about process status, manages process logic at the plant floor level and increases overall productivity and plant efficiency. The primary reason for designing such a system is to eliminate large cost involved in replacing complicated relay based machine control system & to reduce process time. Ratio control system is feed forward system where one variable is controlled in ratio to another to satisfy some higher level objectives. Two difference chemicals are supplied from different tanks in proper ratio by maintaining the flow of quantity. Then desired mixture is obtained &checks the ratio of composition if any unbalanced, controlled by controlled values of supply tanks. Then this mixture is distributed as per requirements. In Industries <b>for</b> <b>ten</b> machines, total <b>cycle</b> time with existing PLC based system is 75 sec. But our modified PLC based system total cycle time is improved as 45 sec. Hence total reach time of distribution system is improved...|$|R

40|$|A solvothermal route was {{developed}} to synthesize a series of ZnO-based mixed oxides. The performance of these materials was investigated for H 2 S removal at room temperature {{in order to find}} an environmental and economically efficient material for the reactive H 2 S adsorption. Compared to commercially available and synthesized zinc oxide nanoparticles, which is commonly used for H 2 S removal, it reveals that the adsorption capacity rises drastically by co-precipitating bismuth oxide (12 times higher as compared to the commercial zinc oxide material) with a precursor molar ratio of 25 % Bi and 75 % Zn respectively. The H 2 S adsorption capacity of this new mixed oxide integrating bismuth and zinc was determined using Infrasorp (19. 6 mg− 1) and breakthrough measurements (79. 9 mg of H 2 S/g of adsorbent). Characterization of the material before and after H 2 S treatment using SEM, EDX, ICP-OES, elemental analysis, XRD, N 2 physisorption, FTIR and Raman gave essential insights in the chemical and morphological structure of the solids. Regeneration was tested, showing the ability of this material to restore partially its capacity <b>for</b> more than <b>ten</b> <b>cycles.</b> This bismuth/zinc mixed oxide material is not yet reported in literature and presents a promising capacity for H 2 S adsorption and a wide range of application perspectives...|$|R
