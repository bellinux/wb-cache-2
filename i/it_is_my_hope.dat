It concerns a dear friend of mine who is no longer with us. His name is Ryan White. He was a hemophiliac who was diagnosed with the AIDS virus when he was eleven. He died shortly after turning eighteen, the very time most young people are beginning to explore life's wonderful possibilities. My friend Ryan was a very bright, very brave, and very normal young man who never wanted to be a symbol or a spokesperson for a deadly disease. Over the years, I've shared many silly, happy, and painful moments with Ryan and I was with him {{at the end of his}} brief but eventful journey. Ryan is gone and just as anyone who has lost a loved one to AIDS, I miss him deeply and constantly. He is gone, but I want his life to have meaning beyond his passing. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>hope,</b> President-elect Clinton, that you and your administration commit the resources needed to eliminate this awful disease that took my friend, and ended so many promising lives before their time. This song is for you Ryan". - Michael Jackson, January 1993.|$|E

Unfortunately, this recent decision and decisions taken on other similar cases, prove that the court system in the United States has become {{more or less a}} tool that the executive branch can easily manipulate through unfounded allegations and fear mongering. If anything, this decision is a loss to all Americans and to the rule of law.|$|R

2500|$|At {{the time}} of the murder, Davis was acting {{governor}} as Governor Pete Wilson was out of the country on a trade visit. [...] Wilson's spokesman stated that the governor did not proactively volunteer rewards but would act only after local law enforcement requested it. On February 8, Wilson rescinded the offer Davis had made, citing the Cosby family's request that no taxpayer money be used as a reward. [...] "The Cosby family has my heartfelt sympathy," [...] Wilson said in a statement. [...] "I also regret that the Cosby family has had to respond to a barrage of media attention with regards to rewards offered by the state and other entities. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>hope</b> that withdrawing this reward brings a close to this issue and takes a burden off the Cosby family." ...|$|E
