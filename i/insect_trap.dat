50|$|A {{pheromone}} trap {{is a type}} of <b>insect</b> <b>trap</b> {{that uses}} pheromones to lure insects. Sex pheromones and aggregating pheromones are the most common types used.

50|$|<b>Insect</b> <b>traps</b> {{are used}} to monitor or {{directly}} reduce populations of insects or other arthropods. They typically use food, visual lures, chemical attractants and pheromones as bait and are installed {{so that they do}} not injure other animals or humans or result in residues in foods or feeds. Visual lures use light, bright colors and shapes to attract pests. Chemical attractants or pheromones may attract only a specific sex. <b>Insect</b> <b>traps</b> are sometimes used in pest management programs instead of pesticides but are more often used to look at seasonal and distributional patterns of pest occurrence. This information may then be used in other pest management approaches.|$|R

50|$|Ecological ways of {{removing}} pest Lepidoptera species {{are becoming more}} economically viable, as research has shown ways like introducing parasitic wasp and flies. For example, Sarcophaga aldrichi, a fly which deposited larvae feed upon the pupae of the forest tent caterpillar moth. Pesticides can affect other species other than the species they are targeted to eliminate, damaging the natural ecosystem. Another good biological pest control method {{is the use of}} pheromone traps. A pheromone trap is a type of <b>insect</b> <b>trap</b> that uses pheromones to lure insects. Sex pheromones and aggregating pheromones are the most common types used. A pheromone-impregnated lure is encased in a conventional trap such as a Delta trap, water-pan trap, or funnel trap.|$|E
50|$|Above {{the male}} flowers is {{a ring of}} hairs forming an <b>insect</b> <b>trap.</b> Insects, {{especially}} owl-midges Psychoda phalaenoides, are attracted to the spadix by its faecal odour and a temperature up to 15°C warmer than the ambient temperature. The insects are trapped beneath the ring of hairs and are dusted with pollen by the male flowers before escaping and carrying the pollen to the spadices of other plants, where they pollinate the female flowers. The spadix may also be yellow, but purple is the more common.In autumn, the lower ring of (female) flowers forms a cluster of bright red berries which remain after the spathe and other leaves have withered away. These attractive red to orange berries are extremely poisonous. The berries contain oxalates of saponins which have needle-shaped crystals which irritate the skin, mouth, tongue, and throat, and result in swelling of throat, difficulty breathing, burning pain, and upset stomach. However, their acrid taste, coupled with the almost immediate tingling sensation in the mouth when consumed, means that large amounts are rarely taken and serious harm is unusual. It {{is one of the}} most common causes of accidental plant poisoning based on attendance at hospital emergency departments.|$|E
40|$|Documentation {{of insect}} {{diversity}} {{is an important}} component of the study of biodiversity, community dynamics, and global change. Accurate identification of insects usually requires catching individuals for close inspection. However, because insects are so diverse, most trapping methods are specifically tailored to a particular taxonomic group. For scientists interested in the broadest possible spectrum of insect taxa, whether for long term monitoring of an ecosystem or for a species inventory, the use of several different trapping methods is usually necessary. We describe a novel composite method for capturing a diverse spectrum of insect taxa. The Composite <b>Insect</b> <b>Trap</b> incorporates elements from four different existing trapping methods: the cone trap, malaise trap, pan trap, and flight intercept trap. It is affordable, resistant, easy to assemble and disassemble, and collects a wide variety of insect taxa. Here we describe the design, construction, and effectiveness of the Composite <b>Insect</b> <b>Trap</b> tested during a study of insect diversity. The trap catches a broad array of insects and can eliminate the need to use multiple trap types in biodiversity studies. We propose that the Composite <b>Insect</b> <b>Trap</b> is a useful addition to the trapping methods currently available to ecologists and will be extremely effective for monitoring community level dynamics, biodiversity assessment, and conservation and restoration work. In addition, the Composite <b>Insect</b> <b>Trap</b> will be of use to other insect specialists, such as taxonomists, that are interested in describing the insect taxa in a given area...|$|E
