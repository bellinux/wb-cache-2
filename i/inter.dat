5|$|In 2010 Artmedia were relegated {{from the}} Corgon Liga under their new name of MFK Petržalka, {{finishing}} 12th and bottom. FC Petržalka akadémia currently competes in 5. liga after bankruptcy in summer 2014. Another known club {{from the city}} is FK <b>Inter</b> Bratislava. Founded in 1945, they have their home ground at Stadium ŠKP <b>Inter</b> Dúbravka in Dúbravka, (formerly at Štadión Pasienky) and currently plays in the 3. liga. There are many more clubs with long tradition and successful history {{despite the lack of}} success in last years, e.g. LP Domino Bratislava currently playing in 4. liga; FK Rača Bratislava competing in the 3. liga as well as Inter; FK ŠKP <b>Inter</b> Dúbravka Bratislava, following ŠKP Devín (successful team from 1990s) and partially following the original <b>Inter</b> (original <b>Inter</b> bankrupted in 2009, sold the Corgoň Liga license to FK Senica and legally merged with FC ŠKP Dúbravka; current <b>Inter</b> has taken over the tradition, name, colours, fans etc., but legally is no successor of the original Inter); FC Tatran Devín, the club that was successful mostly at youth level and merged with ŠKP Bratislava in 1995; MŠK Iskra Petržalka, playing under the name ŠK Iskra Matadorfix Bratislava in the former 1st League (today 2nd) in 1997/98.|$|E

5|$|After the 1998 World Cup, Baggio {{signed with}} his {{favourite}} childhood club Internazionale {{in order to}} compete in the UEFA Champions League. However, this proved to be an unfortunate move, as after injuries, disappointing results and several managerial changes throughout the season (including Luigi Simoni, Mircea Lucescu and Roy Hodgson), Baggio struggled to gain playing time, and was used out of position as a winger. Baggio scored 5 goals and provided 10 assists in 23 appearances during the 1998–99 season, as <b>Inter</b> finished in eighth place, missing out on a European spot. He helped <b>Inter</b> to a Coppa Italia semi-final, losing out to eventual winners Parma. Baggio scored a goal against his former club Bologna in a European Play-off match, but <b>Inter</b> lost both matches, failing to qualify for the UEFA Cup. Baggio also scored four goals in the Champions League, helping lead <b>Inter</b> through the qualifying rounds to the quarter-finals, where they were eliminated by eventual winners Manchester United, also scoring a memorable brace against defending champions Real Madrid in the group stage.|$|E

5|$|Due to his {{performances}} with Brescia, Pirlo {{was spotted}} by <b>Inter</b> coach Mircea Lucescu, {{who signed the}} playmaker. Pirlo was unable {{to break into the}} first squad permanently, however, and <b>Inter</b> finished eighth in the 1998–99 Serie A campaign. <b>Inter</b> loaned Pirlo to Reggina for the 1999–2000 season, alongside young <b>Inter</b> teammates Roberto Baronio and Mohamed Kallon. After an impressive season, he returned to <b>Inter</b> but was once again unable to break into the first team, making just four league appearances. He spent {{the second half of the}} 2000–01 season on loan at his former club, Brescia, where he played alongside his childhood idol, offensive playmaker Roberto Baggio. As Baggio occupied the attacking midfield role for Brescia, manager Carlo Mazzone made a ground-breaking decision, becoming the first coach to deploy Pirlo as a deep-lying playmaker, rather than as an offensive midfielder, a deeper creative role in which he particularly excelled, due to his long passing ability. Despite initially struggling against relegation that season, Brescia would eventually manage a comfortable seventh-place finish in Serie A, also reaching the Coppa Italia quarter-finals, qualifying for the 2001 Intertoto Cup. A notable moment in Pirlo's Brescia career was his long pass which assisted Baggio's late equaliser against Juventus at the Stadio delle Alpi, on 1 April 2001.|$|E
5|$|Having had an {{unsuccessful}} trial with Barcelona {{at the age}} of 15, Balotelli was signed by <b>Inter</b> in 2006 on loan with a pre-set price of €150,000 to co-own the player. In June 2007 <b>Inter</b> exercised the option and purchased another half for additional €190,000. On 8 November 2007, as part of Sheffield F.C.'s 150th anniversary celebrations, Balotelli featured in a friendly between the two sides at Sheffield United's Bramall Lane. The game finished 5–2 to <b>Inter,</b> with Balotelli scoring twice. He made his first team and Serie A debut on 16 December 2007, replacing David Suazo in a 2–0 win against Cagliari. Three days later he was featured in the starting lineup in a Coppa Italia match against Reggina, scoring two goals in a 4–1 win. Balotelli gained national attention after he scored two goals against Juventus in the return leg of the Coppa Italia quarter-finals, being instrumental in a 3–2 away win for <b>Inter.</b> His first Serie A goal then came in April 2008 in a 2–0 away win against Atalanta. <b>Inter</b> {{went on to win the}} 2007–08 Serie A. Balotelli was a substitute in the 2008 Supercoppa Italiana final against Roma. He came on as a replacement for Luís Figo, scoring in the 83rd minute. <b>Inter</b> went on to win the final 6–5 on penalties after the match ended 2–2.|$|E

5|$|In November 2008, Balotelli {{became the}} {{youngest}} <b>Inter</b> player (at 18 years and 85 days) to score in the Champions League when he scored a goal in a 3–3 draw against Cypriot side Anorthosis Famagusta, beating the previous record set by Obafemi Martins (at 18 years and 145 days). In an April 2009 match with Juventus where he scored Inter's only goal in a 1–1 draw, Balotelli was racially abused by Juventus fans throughout the game. This led <b>Inter</b> owner Massimo Moratti {{to say that he}} would have pulled the team off the pitch had he been present. The racist chants were also condemned by Juventus chairman Giovanni Cobolli Gigli and Juventus were given a one-game home-fan ban because of the incident. <b>Inter</b> won Serie A for the fourth time in a row.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} season, {{he won his}} first Supercoppa Italiana title against Serie A champions Milan, and Parma finished fourth in Serie A once again, tied with <b>Inter</b> for the final remaining Champions League spot. Parma, however, lost 3–1 to <b>Inter</b> in the European playoff match. The club was knocked out in the round of 16 of both the UEFA Cup and the Coppa Italia.|$|E
5|$|<b>Inter</b> Milan faced Valencia in {{the opening}} match of the tournament; manager Roberto Mancini named an {{experienced}} <b>Inter</b> team that included defender Marco Materazzi and forward Zlatan Ibrahimović. Valencia began the much the stronger of the two, and went ahead in the 13th minute when Jaime Gavilán scored. The midfielder had received the ball from a cross, and managed to guide it under goalkeeper Francesco Toldo. Referee Alan Kelly turned down <b>Inter</b> Milan's appeals for a penalty, when a challenge by Valencia defender Iván Helguera had caused Luís Figo to tumble in the area. <b>Inter</b> nearly equalised through Maxwell as his effort hit the post, but conceded their second goal of the match minutes before the interval. Materazzi fouled David Villa outside the penalty area, and his deflected free-kick sailed into the net. Substitutions for {{both sides in the}} second half led to further chances, all of which came to nothing.|$|E

5|$|The {{competition}} {{follows a}} point scoring system {{much like the}} Amsterdam Tournament, whereby each team plays two matches, with three points awarded for a win, one point for a draw and none for a loss. An additional point is awarded for every goal scored. Arsenal did not face Valencia, and <b>Inter</b> did not play against Paris Saint-Germain. On {{the first day of}} the Emirates Cup, Valencia beat <b>Inter</b> Milan by two goals, while Arsenal defeated Paris Saint-Germain 2–1. Valencia's loss to Paris Saint-Germain on day two meant Arsenal needed to beat <b>Inter</b> Milan in order to finish top of the group. They went a goal behind in the second half, but goals from Alexander Hleb and Robin van Persie secured the cup win. The tournament was well attended with over 110,000 filling the Emirates Stadium across the two-day tournament.|$|E
5|$|A.Paul Ince joined Internazionale in August 1995, in a £7.5million transfer. As part of {{the deal}} that took the England midfielder to <b>Inter,</b> both teams {{mutually}} {{agreed to participate in the}} Pirelli Cup and a friendly at Old Trafford.|$|E
5|$|Baggio {{was used}} {{scarcely}} and {{often as a}} substitute, scoring only 4 goals in 18 appearances during the regular Serie A season. He made five appearances in the Coppa Italia, with his only goal coming against local rivals Milan in the second leg of the quarter-finals, as he helped <b>Inter</b> reach the final, only to be defeated by Lazio. Despite his limited playing time, Baggio still managed several important goals to help <b>Inter</b> to a fourth-place finish, alongside Parma, such as his match winning goal against Hellas Verona, which he scored after coming off the bench, after being excluded from the team since 18 December 1999. Baggio had also previously helped to set up Inter's equaliser during the match. This {{was the first time}} Baggio had scored for <b>Inter</b> since his goal on 27 May of the previous season, and in the post-match the interview, he denied accusations made by Lippi in regard to his personal form.|$|E

5|$|Celtic {{qualified}} {{from their}} Europa League group.

5|$|Celtic {{reached the}} semi-final of the European Cup in 1972, with <b>Inter</b> Milan their opponents. The tie {{remained}} goal-less {{after the end}} of both games and 30 minutes of extra time in the second leg in Glasgow. As such, the tie went to penalty kicks to find a winner, the first time a European Cup tie was decided in this manner. <b>Inter</b> Milan's Sandro Mazzola took the first penalty kick and scored. Dixie Deans took the next penalty, Celtic's first, but fired his shot over the crossbar. The Italians scored all of their remaining penalties to eliminate Celtic.|$|E

5|$|Internazionale had {{the first}} attack of the match. With Renato Cappellini running down the wing and {{supplying}} a cross to Sandro Mazzola whose header hit Celtic goalkeeper Ronnie Simpson's knees. Internazionale won a penalty moments later. Jim Craig fouled Cappellini in the box, and Mazzola converted to put <b>Inter</b> in front after only six minutes. Once they had taken the lead, Internazionale retreated back into their defensive style, which allowed Celtic to attack. However, they struggled to get through Internazionale's defensive wall and were mainly restricted to long shots from outside the box. Bertie Auld hit the crossbar then a cross from Jimmy Johnstone was gathered up by Giuliano Sarti, who then tipped a header from the same player over the crossbar. Internazionale pulled nine men back, but Celtic kept attacking them. Tommy Gemmell's dangerous free-kick was saved by Sarti, he then speculatively attempted to lob the <b>Inter</b> 'keeper and hit the bar. Despite Celtic's inability to break through their opponents defence they were in complete control of the match and Internazionale {{were not able to}} attack. <b>Inter</b> had not had another chance since their goal, whilst Celtic found themselves foiled time and again by outstanding goalkeeping from Sarti.|$|E
