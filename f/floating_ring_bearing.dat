40|$|As one of {{the most}} common faults, rotor {{imbalance}} in a turbocharger will give rise to the bending vibration, which may cause damage to and even destroy the bearings and impellers. Therefore, it is necessary to detect rotor imbalance as early as possible. The present paper develops a mathematical model for investigating the rotor dynamic characteristics of a commercial automotive turbocharger supported on floating ring bearings. In order to reveal the behaviours of oil film instabilities the model takes into account nonlinear hydrodynamic oil film forces instead of linearization. A two-dimensional elastic collision model is introduced to deal with the rub-impact process between such solid parts as journal, floating ring and the bearing. In addition, the change of clearances in <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> <b>bearing</b> due to temperature increases are also estimated by ignoring the variation of lubricating oil viscosity.

However, there is no condition monitoring of this bearing because {{it is almost impossible to}} measure the clearance especially the inner clearance, in which the inner oil film directly bears the high speed rotation. In stead of measuring clearance directly, this paper has proposed a method that uses film pressure as a measure to monitor the bearing clearance and its variation.

Each fluid film of the <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> <b>bearing</b> is analyzed using a finite element model.

The <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> <b>bearing</b> analysis provides both floating ring speeds and bearing force coefficients for use in a linear rotordynamic model. The linear rotordynamic evaluation yields predictions of system stability as well as response to imbalance. The linear analysis employs a 27 -station finite element model to capture the flexibility of the shaft. The analysis evidences several modes that become unstable at very low speeds, including cylindrical and conical modes for both inner and outer fluid films. Typically, the frequencies of the unstable modes are close to half the ring speed or half the ring plus rotor speeds. These results are supported by a non-linear transient analysis of the rotor-bearing system. The transient predicts the amplitude of the limit cycle motion for the unstable modes. Non-linear transient predictions are generated for a range of lubricant supply conditions with varied supply temperature and pressure. Ring speed and shaft motion predictions are compared to measurements taken on an automotive turbocharger test apparatus. Eddy-current proximity probes measure the shaft motion {{at both ends of the}} shaft, while fiber optic probes measure the ring speeds. The non-linear transient predicts the frequency content of the measured response with fair accuracy, but it usually over-predicts the amplitude of the response. In particular, the analysis fails to predict the effect of increasing lubricant supply pressure. In general, increasing the lubricant supply pressure reduces shaft motion amplitude. This investigation also attempts to identify through shaft motion measurements the effects of aerodynamic loading of the compressor, if any. Shaft motion measurements taken with the compressor housing re-oriented (in order to re-direct the aerodynamic load) showed that the aerodynamic load impacted the static displacement of the rotor, but the dynamic response showed little deviation from the original measurements...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Physical {{models and}} fast {{computational}} programs aim {{to improve the}} design and performance of turbocharger (TC) rotordynamics. Most commercial automotive TCs incorporate <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> <b>bearings</b> (FRBs) owing to their low cost and reduced power losses. However, persistent subsynchronous motions afflict this type of rotor/bearing system, albeit reaching limit cycles that enable their continuous operation. FRBs comprise two fluid films in series and are prone to show one or two subsynchronous instabilities over extended speed ranges of operation. A flow model for prediction of FRB forced response is detailed here.

40|$|Automotive turbochargers {{have been}} widely applied in {{vehicles}} {{in order to increase}} the power output of internal combustion engines by increasing the air to fuel ratio entering the piston cylinders. Turbochargers use the exhaust flow to spin a turbine at speeds of up to 140, 000 r/min. Under such extreme working conditions, even a weak vibration can lead to the bearing failure and the whole turbocharger destroyed. In order to guarantee a safe operation, it is necessary to carry out a theoretical research on the dynamics performance of turbochargers. Therefore, the primary objective of this research is to develop a dynamics model for the turbocharger rotor system under multi-field coupled forces and then to study the dynamic characteristics and the stability of its rotor system according to the simulation and experimental results. A turbocharger is a special kind of rotating machinery because of the following aspects: Firstly, the turbocharger rotor system is supported by floating ring bearings. The impact of nonlinear multi-field coupled forces must be considered. Secondly, the turbocharger rotor system is a multi-span rotor bearing system that makes the modeling and simulation more complicated. Thirdly, the working speed range of the turbocharger covers multiple orders of critical speeds. This flexible rotor system cannot be studied using the conventional theory of rigid rotors. In this thesis, the lubrication system of a turbocharger is initially investigated. The analytical expressions of the hydrodynamic pressure distribution in the <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> <b>bearing</b> are derived using the infinitely long bearing theory, taking into account the oil inlet pressure and the cavitation area. The influences of external loads and oil inlet pressure on the oil flow rate into the inner clearance are analytically investigated, while considering the effect of the rotation of the ring. A finite element model is then developed for the turbocharger rotor system. In this model, the excitation forces considered include rotor imbalance, hydrodynamic forces, lubricant feed pressure and the dead weight. The dimensionless form of Capone hydrodynamic force model is extended into the <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> <b>bearing.</b> Following model development, modal analysis is carried out on both a free rotor system and a turbocharger rotor system. The effects of the structural parameters and working conditions, such as the rotor imbalance, lubricant viscosity, bearing clearances and lubricant feed pressure, on the stability of the turbocharger rotor system are studied. A turbocharger test rig is then designed and developed to monitor the turbocharger shaft motion. The experimental data agree well with the simulation results from the theoretical model. The primary contribution of the current research can be categorized into the following aspects: Firstly, the analytical expressions of the hydrodynamic pressure distribution have been solved. The equilibrium positions of the journal and ring have been deduced under different external loads and lubricant feed pressure. The relationship between the oil flow rate and the rotational velocity of the shaft has been obtained. Secondly, Capone hydrodynamic force model is introduced and extended to simulate the dynamic performance of the <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> <b>bearing.</b> The analytical expression of the hydrodynamic forces of double oil films have been derived based on the dimensionless form of the Reynolds Equations. Thirdly, the motion of the turbocharger shaft is simulated within a speed range of 0 to 8, 000 rad/s. The influences of structural parameters and working conditions on the stability of the turbocharger rotor system are clearly understood. It {{should be noted that the}} developed model still needs to be validated when turbocharger is operated at a relatively high speed, although it agrees well with experimental results within the speed range of 0 to 2, 000 rad/s.

30|$|High-speed turbochargers (TCs) {{have gained}} {{significant}} attention in recent years. They {{already have been}} widely used in commercial vehicles. The weight of a typical automotive TC is about 1  kg. It has 200  mm in length and 5 ‒ 15  mm in diameter and operates above 100000  r/min, which fails in the high-speed and light-weight rotor category. A small TC rotor with small unbalance can produce large vibration when it spins at high speed [1]. It is well known that the first exhaust TC was invented at the beginning of last century. There are many efforts to investigate the rotordynamics of TC rotor-bearing system [2, 3]. The <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> <b>bearing</b> (FRB) configuration is the simplest bearing design and the most widely used in small TCs. In such FRB design, two fluid films are connected in series in a floating ring, which are capable of providing higher damping and fewer friction losses than a single-film plain journal bearing [4]. However, due to its high speed and high nonlinear feature, the FRB system exhibits high magnitude sub-synchronous vibration for a wide speed range [5]. The bearing fluid-film whirl instability is the main source of the sub-synchronous vibration. The nonlinear reaction forces inside the bearings are usually causing the TC rotor to whirl in a limit cycle but may become large enough to cause permanent damages. Based on classical linear eigenvalue analysis presented by Kirk et al. [6], both inner and outer films always lead to the instability for high-speed TCs. Li et al. [7] developed a stability analysis and an identification method for rotor-bearings system. Surprisingly, because of high non-linear characteristics of the inner and outer oil films, it was observed that the loss of instability can induce the onset of stable limit cycles under sub-synchronous frequency via a Hopf bifurcation [8], which can always ensure the safe operation of a TC [9]. Interestingly, according to the published simulation and experimental results [10, 11], {{it has been shown that}} the proved the final occurrence of the above-mentioned possibilities is sensitive to the rotor-FRB system physical parameters of TC, such as bearing structural parameters, oil feeding conditions and imposed unbalance values. The deep sensitivity clearly implies the possibility to optimize the TC rotor dynamic response and reduce the vibration by adjusting the physical structural parameters of a TC.|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Turbochargers are commonly used to increase the power output and efficiency of internal combustion automotive engines. Conventional turbocharger rotors are usually supported on floating ring journal bearings (FRBs) running with engine oil as lubricant. FRBs are comprised of an inner and outer thin lubricated films in series, and offer lower power losses and also cooler operation conditions than a single-land hydrodynamic journal bearing (Wilcock, 1983). FRBs are also very attractive for turbomachinery because of the inherent high damping characteristics associated to the presence of two fluid films (Orcutt and Ng, 1968). However FRBs can lead to rotordynamic instability, exhibiting subsynchronous rotor whirl in most of their operating range. Nonetheless, FRBs often reach stable limit cycles, thus becoming cost-effective solutions to the rotor support design. The main objective of the research was to identify the fundamental physical parameters that affect the dynamic performance of a rotor supported on a <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> <b>bearing</b> from measurements of the rotor response to calibrated imbalance masses. Experiments were performed on a test rig to measure the system threshold of instability, amplitude of limit cycle, and range of whirl frequencies as a function of bearing load, rotor imbalance and the rotor speed. Measurements of the rotor response demonstrate that the rotor-FRB system renders an unstable behavior for almost the entire journal speed range and achieves a limit cycle at the maximum running speed (10, 000 rpm). The system non linearity is evidenced by two self-excited subsynchronous vibration components identified from the experiments. The first subsynchronous component is associated with the instability of the inner film and the second component is associated with the instability of the outer film. Localized absence of subsynchronous vibration components is evident for higher supply pressures at specific operating speeds. Full floating ring and semi floating ring conditions are examined in the study. The semi floating bearing ring is the most unfavorable condition for the rotor bearing system due to the high levels of vibration observed on the test rotor-FRB...|$|E

Currently, condition monitoring {{is not as}} widely applied on reciprocating compressors as compared to rotating compressors. However, research for monitoring various components of reciprocating compressors such as inlet and outlet valves and piston rings is conducted. There is industry interest into expanding this research to the main bearings of the compressor. Previous research on bearings focuses on either rolling element bearings or traditional journal bearings with not much information available on low speed applications of fully <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> journal <b>bearings</b> as are studied in this work.

40|$|The rotor dynamic {{behaviour}} of turbochargers (TC) {{has been paid}} significant attention because of its importance in their healthy operation.

The nonlinear bearing forces have been calculated by a newly proposed analytical method. An efficient numerical integration approach has been employed to conduct the investigation including the traditional unbalance and the considered engine excitation effects in question. The results show that the unbalance will place considerable influence on the rotor response at a low working speed. At high speeds, the effect will be prevented by the dominant sub-synchronous vibrations, which also prohibit the appearance of a chaotic state. The novel investigation with the proposed model considering engine excitation reveals that the engine induced vibration will greatly affect the TC rotor response at relatively lower rotor speeds as well. At higher speed range, the dominant effect of sub-synchronous vibrations is still capable of keeping the same orbit shapes as that without engine excitation from a relative viewpoint...|$|R

40|$|The present work {{advances}} {{progress on}} the validation against measurements of linear and nonlinear rotordynamic models for predicting the dynamic shaft response of automotive turbochargers (TCs) supported on floating ring bearings. Waterfall spectra of measured shaft motions at the compressor and turbine ends of a test TC rotor evidences a complex response, showing synchronous (1 X) and multiple subsynchronous frequencies along the entire operating speed range (maximum shaft speed ~ 65 krpm). Postprocessing of the raw test data by mathematical software allows filtering the synchronous and subsynchronous vibration components for later comparisons to predicted shaft motions. The static performance of the floating ring bearings is analyzed with in-house software (XLSFRBThermal??), which considers thermal expansion of the shaft and bearing components as well as static loading on the bearing due to lubricant feed pressure. In addition, the program calculates rotordynamic force coefficients for {{the inner and outer}} films of the <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> <b>bearing.</b> The turbocharger Finite Element (FE) structural model for the linear and nonlinear analyses includes lumped masses for the compressor and turbine wheels and the thrust collar. The mass imbalance distribution on the TC rotor is estimated from the test data using a procedure derived from the two-plane balancing method with influence coefficients. The linear model yields predictions of rotor synchronous (1 X) response to imbalance and damped eigenvalues. The analysis evidences that the rotor cylindrical-bending mode is unstable at all shaft speeds while the rotor conical model becomes more unstable as lubricant feed pressure decreases. The predicted synchronous (1 X) motions agree well with the test data, showing a critical speed at approximately 20 krpm. The linear stability results indicate the existence of three critical speeds occurring at 4, 20 and 50 krpm. The second critical speed corresponds to the rotor cylindrical-bending mode, showing larger amplitudes of motion at the compressor nose than at the turbine end. The third critical speed associated to the rotor first bending modes is well damped. In the nonlinear transient analysis, the nonlinear equations of motion of the system (rotor-FRB) are integrated, and the bearing reaction forces are calculated at each time step in a numerical integration procedure. The model then yields predictions of total motion which is decomposed into synchronous (1 X) and subsynchronous motions, amplitudes and frequencies. The nonlinear analysis predicts synchronous (1 X) amplitudes that correlate well with the test data at high shaft speeds (> 30 krpm) but underpredicts the imbalance response at low shaft speeds (< 30 krpm). The time transient simulations predict multiple frequency subsynchronous motions for shaft speeds ranging from 10 krpm to 55 krpm, with amplitudes and frequencies that are in good agreement with the measurements. Finally, the shaft motion measurements and predictions demonstrate that the turbocharger dynamic response does not depend greatly on the lubricant feed pressure and inlet temperature for the conditions tested...|$|E
40|$|Nonlinear response, bifurcations and {{stability}} of rotor-fluid film bearing systems are studied using various numerical investigation schemes such as autonomous/non-autonomous shooting, arc-length continuation, direct numerical integrations, Poincar? sections, Lyapunov exponents, etc. Two types of hydrodynamic bearings, a <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> <b>bearing</b> (FRB) and a tilting pad journal bearing (TPJB), are employed in this study. The nonlinear characteristic of each bearing is analyzed as supports of a rigid rotor system {{as well as a}} flexible rotor system. Depending on the existence of the unbalance force on the rotor/disks, autonomous (free vibration) and non-autonomous responses (mass unbalanced excitation) are both identified, and the nonlinear reaction force produced on the lubricant layer is obtained using the finite element method. In addition to isoviscosity lubricants, thermo-hydrodynamic lubricant model is developed to investigate thermal effects on rotordynamic bifurcations; in the procedure, a variable viscosity Reynolds equation and the energy equation are solved simultaneously. For computation efficiency in the analytical bifurcation study, an advanced shooting algorithm, which is combined with the deflation theory and the parallel computing strategy, is proposed for both the autonomous and the non-autonomous cases. In the study with flexible rotors, the finite element based beam models are employed and the model reduction technique such as Component Mode Synthesis is utilized to condense the system degree of freedom. This dissertation consists of four main discussions regarding: 1) nonlinear response and bifurcations of a rigid rotor supported by FRBs; 2) effects of a thermo-hydrodynamic (THD) FRB model on rotordynamic bifurcations; 3) nonlinear response and bifurcations of a rigid rotor supported by TPJBs; 4) extension of study to general, complex, multi-mass rotor beam models. In case 1), multiple coexistent solutions and bifurcation scenarios are identified, and those are depended on the ratio of floating ring length to diameter (L/D). Numerical illustrations regarding jumps between two stable limit cycles and quenching large vibrations are demonstrated, and chaos is investigated with the aid of Lyanpunov exponent. In case 2), the Hopf bifurcation onset is strongly dependent on thermal conditions, and the saddle node bifurcation points are significantly shifted compared to the isothermal model. In addition, the unbalanced responses stability and bifurcation onsets are highly reliant on the lubricant supply temperature. In case 3), loci of bifurcations are identified, and heavily loaded bearings and/or high unbalance force may induce consecutive transference of response in forms of synchronous to sub-synchronous, quasi-periodic responses and chaotic motions. The periodic doubling bifurcations, saddle node bifurcations and corresponding local stability are reliably determined by selections of pad preload, pivot offset, and lubricant viscosity sets. In case 4), two industrial applications such as a turbocharger supported by FRBs and an eight-stage centrifugal compressor supported by TPJBs are numerically analyzed. The turbocharger shows that torus appears with Neimark-Sacker bifurcation events and the motions are dominant in the high speed ranges (> 60, 000 rpm). In the compressor, sub-/super-synchronous motions are identified other than the ? 1 synchronous response, and the appearance of each harmonic is highly depended on the selection of pad preload and pivot offset...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with a theoretical investigation into the nonlinear dynamic behaviour of a turbocharger. Specifically the instabilities due to oil-whirl are examined. These are self-excited vibrations existing {{in the form of}} an in-phase whirl mode and a conical whirl mode. Waterfall plots were provided by Cummins Turbo-Technologies Ltd., Huddersfield, UK, based on test data using two different unbalance levels on a turbocharger. The test with the high unbalance indicated that there was shift in the sub-synchronous frequency to synchronous frequency between about 80, 000 rpm to 130, 000 rpm. The literature suggests that this self-excited vibration can be suppressed using forced excitation. Moreover, it is well known that the existence of limit cycles enables successful operation of a turbocharger. This limit cycle is a periodic motion attributed to the nonlinearity of the oil-film, other than the stable and the unstable equilibrium states predicted by the linear analysis. Hence, a nonlinear analysis is required to analyse the limit cycle and to determine the effect of synchronous excitation on it. In the literature a variety of parameters has been shown to influence the dynamic behaviour of a rotor-bearing system. To avoid over-complicated mathematical modeling, the influence of two such parameters: gyroscopic moment and shaft flexibility are first investigated in this thesis using linear stability theory to determine their significance. Effects of gyroscopic action are investigated using symmetric and asymmetric rigid rotors supported on short journal bearings with full-film using rigid and damped supports. In this thesis, the damper supported journal bearing is used to simulate the floating ring bearings that are commonly used in automotive turbochargers. The outer film of the <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> <b>bearing</b> is treated as an external damper, since the ring is assumed not to rotate but only wobble giving the damping effect from the squeezing action. A gyroscopic coefficient, which is defined as the ratio of the polar to the transverse moment of inertia of the rotor, is introduced. The threshold value of this coefficient is determined to be 1 for the suppression of the conical whirl instability. The stability of the in-phase whirl mode is unaffected by this parameter. A flexible rotor mounted in floating ring bearings with full-film, is analysed to confirm that it behaves as a rigid body up to a speed of 100, 000 rpm. Prior to the unbalance response study, a perfectly balanced rigid rotor supported by rigidly supported bearings is first analysed to determine the nonlinear behaviour of the in-phase whirl. To include the stiffness-like radial restoring force, an oscillating 2 ? -film cavitation model for the hydrodynamic bearings is used. The effect of a static load on the rotor is analysed to determine the nonlinear behaviour for a wide range of steady-state eccentricity ratios. A parameter plane separating the region of instability from that of stability is presented using linear analysis to determine the stability threshold at which the oil-whirl is initiated. The onset of oil-whirl phenomenon is shown to be the Hopf bifurcation. Particular emphasis is placed on examining the limit cycles (periodic oscillations) around the stability threshold. Reducing the nonlinear equation of motion to Poincare? normal form, the first Lyapunov coefficients are evaluated to show the change in the type of bifurcation from sub-critical bifurcation (disappearance of an unstable limit cycle) to super-critical bifurcation (appearance of a stable limit cycle) around the stability threshold. Such bifurcations are demonstrated through plots of orbits using numerical integration by the Runge-Kutta method. With some unbalance added to the rotor-system, waterfall plots are generated to simulate the response characteristics observed in the test data, by running-up the speed. After the Centre Manifold reduction, the equations of motions are averaged for analysis. Using a numerical and an analytical procedure, it is shown that the unbalance is more effective in the transient motion than in the steady-state condition. Unbalance introduces a reduction in the growth rate of whirl amplitude upto a certain optimum unbalance value, above which the effect is reversed. The mechanism behind this behaviour is shown to be the shift in phase caused by the unbalance at the start of whirling, when the dynamic forces are comparable with the unbalance force. This is due to the coupling effect of amplitude and phase in an unbalanced rotor syste...|$|E
30|$|Due to {{operational}} {{wear and}} uneven carbon absorption in compressor and turbine wheels, the unbalance (me) vibration is induced and {{could lead to}} sub-synchronous vibration accidents for high-speed turbocharger (TC). There are very few research works {{that focus on the}} magnitude effects on such induced unbalance vibration. In this paper, a finite element model (FEM) is developed to characterize a realistic automotive TC rotor with <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> <b>bearings</b> (FRBs). The nonlinear dynamic responses of the TC rotor system with different levels of induced unbalance magnitude in compressor and turbine wheels are calculated. From the results of waterfall and response spectral intensity plots, the bifurcation and instability phenomena depend on unbalance magnitude during the startup of TC. The sub-synchronous component 0.12 × caused rotor unstable is the dominant frequency for small induced unbalance. The nonlinear effects of induced unbalance in the turbine wheel is obvious stronger than the compressor wheel. As the unbalance magnitude increases from 0.05  g·mm to 0.2  g·mm, the vibration component changes from mainly 0.12 × to synchronous vibration 1 ×. When unbalance increases continuously, the rotor vibration response amplitude is rapidly growing and the 1 × caused by the large unbalance excitation becomes the dominant frequency.

The high nonlinearity there can always lead to quite complex and interesting phenomena rarely observed in other rotating applications. Using the run-up and run-down simulation method, this paper originally and systematically discusses {{the effect of}} bearing outer clearance on the rotordynamic characteristics of a realistic turbocharger rotor over the speed range up to 3000 Hz. The rotor is discretized by the Finite Element Method and supported by analytically calculated bearing forces. The linear analysis is proved {{to be effective in}} predicting the first two nonlinear jumps but inadequate to study the rotordynamic characteristics at higher rotor speeds. The nonlinearly simulated results show the appearances of distinct and interesting phenomena within the considered range of FRB outer clearance, which can be further divided into four groups. Within the same group, the simulation results are qualitatively similar to each other but quite dissimilar from the results from different groups. Moreover, the unwelcome Critical Limit Cycle Oscillation can be avoided by increasing the outer clearance size. Additionally, in some cases, the run-down simulations reveal distinct frequency maps as compared to the corresponding run-ups. Furthermore, it is seen that ring speed ratios can be considerably affected by the nonlinear jumps. Therefore, FRB outer clearance should be thoroughly examined to achieve the best rotordynamic performance. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Increasing quality {{demands of}} {{combustion}} engines require, amongst others, improvements of the engine’s acoustics and all (sub) components mounted to the latter. A significant impact to the audible tonal noise spectrum {{results from the}} vibratory motions of fast-rotating turbocharger rotor systems in multiple hydrodynamic bearings such as <b>floating</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>rings.</b> Particularly, the study of self-excited non-linear vibrations of the rotor-bearing systems is crucial for the understanding, prevention or reduction of the noise and, consequently, for a sustainable engine acoustics development. This work presents an efficient modeling approach for the investigation, optimization, and design improvement of complex turbocharger rotors in hydrodynamic journal <b>bearings,</b> including <b>floating</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>rings</b> with circular and non-circular bearing geometries. The capability of tonal non-synchronous vibration prevention using non-circular bearing shapes is demonstrated with dynamic run-up simulations of the presented model.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this investigation}} were to design and construct a high speed turbocharger test rig (TTR) to measure dynamics of differing turbocharger rotor bearing systems {{and to develop a}} coupled rotor-cartridge model for the ball bearing rotor system to corroborate the experimental and analytical results. The ball bearing rotor is supported by an angular contact ball bearing cartridge. In order to achieve the {{objectives of}} the experimental aspect of this study, a TTR was designed and developed with the capability of reaching speeds in excess of 100, 000 rpm driven by compressed air. The TTR was used to compare and contrast the whirl and friction characteristics of two identical turbochargers differing only by the support structure of the rotor system; one containing a <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> <b>bearing</b> turbocharger (FRBT) and the other a ball bearing turbocharger (BBT). A pair of displacement sensors was installed to measure the whirl of the rotor {{near the end of the}} compressor. The BBT was shown to be significantly more rigid and stable as compared to the FRBT with an average reduction in radial rotor motion of 47 %. The motion of the BBT consisted of mainly synchronous motion whereas the FRBT was dominated by subsynchronous motion throughout the entire range of speeds. The TTR was also used to compare frictional losses within the bearings. A study of run-down times after the pressurized air supply was removed indicated that the BBT has significantly lower frictional losses under all operating conditions tested with an average increase in run-down time of 14. 1 %. ^ A wireless telemetry based temperature sensor was designed specifically for the turbocharger ball bearing system to monitor the internal bearing temperature located on the cage during operation. It was shown to be able to withstand the harsh environments of turbocharger fnapplications operating at high speeds. The sensor accurately monitored transient bearing cage temperature due to changes in operating speed. ^ Custom sensors were developed in order to measure the axial forces acting on the rotor due to aerodynamic effects. The sensors utilized cantilever beams outfitted with strain gages to measure the applied load from the bearing cartridge. Results of dynamic testing indicated the magnitude and direction of the axial force is dependent on the operating conditions of the turbine and compressor. ^ To achieve the objectives of the analytical investigation, the explicit finite element method (EFEM) and the discrete element method (DEM) were coupled to investigate dynamics of flexible rotor systems supported by deep groove ball bearings. DEM was used to develop the dynamic bearing model (DBM) in which all of the components of the bearing (i. e. races, balls, and cage) have six degrees-of-freedom. The flexible shaft was modeled with a full 3 D elastic formulation using the EFEM. Rotor and inner races of the bearings were fully coupled such that both translation and rotation of the flexible rotor are transmitted to the bearings. The resulting reaction forces and moments calculated in DBM were in turn applied to the nodes of the shaft. The combined rotor-bearing model was used to investigate the motions of the inner races at low speeds and the resulting reaction forces and moments from the supporting bearings due to a large applied load on the shaft. In the current coupled modeling approach, the deformation of the shaft affected the internal components of the bearing by altering the orientation of the inner race which results in ball spin and slip. The preceding rotor-bearing model was extended to represent the turbocharger rotor-cartridge system that is under consideration. A DEM angular contact ball bearing cartridge model was coupled with an EFEM shaft to simulate the dynamics of the turbocharger test rig. The bearing cartridge consists of a common outer ring, a pair of split inner races, and a row of balls on each end of the cartridge. The coupled rotor-cartridge model was used to investigate the shaft motion and bearing dynamics as the system traverses critical speeds. The analytical and experimental shaft motion results were in close agreement. The cartridge model allowed for thorough investigation of bearing component dynamics. Effects of ball material properties were found to have a significant impact on turbocharger rotor and bearing dynamics. ...|$|E

A hybrid numerical method combining the differential transformation method and the {{finite difference method}} used to calculate pressure distribution of FRGB system and rotor orbits. The results obtained for the orbits of the rotor center are in good agreement with those obtained using the traditional finite difference approach. Moreover, the hybrid method avoids the numerical instability problem suffered by the finite difference scheme at low values of the rotor mass and computational time-step. Moreover, power spectra, Poincaré maps, bifurcation diagrams and Lyapunov exponents are applied to examine the nonlinear dynamic response of the FRGB system over representative ranges of the rotor mass and bearing number, respectively. The results presented summarize the changes which {{take place in the}} dynamic behavior of the FRGB system as the rotor mass and bearing number are increased and therefore provide a useful guideline for the bearing system...|$|R
40|$|Automotive turbochargers (TCs) {{increase}} {{internal combustion}} engine power and efficiency in passenger and commercial vehicles. TC rotors are usually supported on <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> <b>bearings</b> (FRBs) or semi-floating <b>ring</b> <b>bearings</b> (SFRBs), {{both of which are}} inexpensive to manufacture. However, fluid film bearings are highly nonlinear components of TC units and contribute to the complex behavior (i. e. bifurcations and frequency jumps between a first whirl frequency and a second whirl frequency) of the entire rotor-bearing system (RBS). The frequency jump phenomenon concerns the TC manufacturing industry due to increased levels of noise generation. This thesis presents progress on assessing the effects of some bearing parameters and operating conditions on the RBS dynamic forced performance and the frequency jump phenomenon. A fluid film bearing model is integrated into a finite element rotordynamics computational model for numerical prediction of the TC linear and nonlinear (time transient) forced response. Since automotive TCs operate with variable rotational speed, predictions are conducted with shaft acceleration/deceleration. Over most of its operating speed range, TC rotor nonlinear response predictions display two subsynchronous whirl frequencies w 1 and w 2 representing a conical mode and a cylindrical bending mode, respectively. At low shaft speeds w 1 is present up to a shaft speed (Omega bifurcation), where there is a frequency jump from w 1 to w 2. The second whirl frequency may persist up to the highest shaft speeds (depending on operating conditions). Results show during rotor deceleration the Omega bifurcation may be different from the one during rotor acceleration (hysteresis). Predictions show the following factors delay the Omega bifurcation: increasing oil supply pressure, decreasing oil supply temperature, and increasing shaft acceleration. Also, rotor imbalance distribution greatly affects Omega bifurcation and the shaft amplitude of total motion. Overall, this study shows the sensitivity of bifurcations and frequency jump phenomenon in TC nonlinear response due to various bearing parameters and operating conditions. Further analysis is required to generalize these findings and to assess the effect of other bearing parameters (i. e. clearances, outer film length, ring rotation, etc.) on this phenomenon. In addition further validation of the predictions against test data is required for refinement of the predictive tool...|$|R
40|$|As a {{high speed}} {{rotating}} device, a modern turbocharger rotor is commonly supported by <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> <b>bearings</b> (FRBs), owing to their cost effectiveness for mass production and good damping performance. Thanks {{to the rapid}} growth {{of the power of the}} modern computer, rotordynamic analysis of turbocharger rotor-bearing systems becomes feasible, and it is closely related to the healthy operation and noise generation of turbochargers. The work in this thesis is concerned with the nonlinear rotordynamic modelling, simulation and analysis in the rotor-FRB system of turbochargers. The conventional linear eigenvalue analysis is shown first in a gradually deepening manner to provide a deeper insight into the results from nonlinear simulations and reported experimental results. It is subsequently found the onset of first two nonlinear jumps can be effectively predicted by the linearized FRB model, although the rotordynamic characteristics at higher rotor speeds can hardly be linearly predicted. The desired oil-film forces for nonlinear simulations are calculated from a newly proposed analytical method, which is extended from the Capone’s journal bearing model. Stationary simulations under the perfectly balanced condition show two major subsynchronous components throughout the considered speed range, while the inclusion of in-phase unbalance places a considerable effect on the rotor response at relatively low speed and delays the occurrence of oil-film instability. However, at higher rotor speeds, the lower subsynchronous component can still establish the dominance. The engine induced vibrations are also considered, and it is seen the rotor response over the lower end of the speed range will be considerably affected, whereas, at higher rotor speeds, the engine induced vibrations can be suppressed by the dominant lower subsynchronous vibrations. Through carrying out many run-up and run-down simulations, the FRB outer clearance is found to be a critical parameter of the rotordynamic performance of the investigated TC rotor-FRB system, since distinct frequency maps are obtained with varying FRB outer clearances. The nonlinear effects of unbalance are also investigated, and it is observed the rotor response can be considerably affected by the amount and distribution of the imposed unbalance...|$|R

The measured data included leakage performance, attitude angle, lock-up eccentric ratio, and rotordynamic coefficients such as stiffness, damping and equivalent whirl frequency ratio to decide the whirling stability of seal were compared with <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> seal. When the thickness of bump <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> seals is increasing, leakage flow rate somewhat increases. Also, the lock-up eccentric ratio of the bump <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> seal with large thickness is {{lower than that of}} the <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> seal or small thickness of bump foil. The attitude angle increases linearly with the operating speeds in both cases. The direct damping coefficients increase significantly with the increments in bump-foil thickness and hydrostatic pressure-drop, but diminish with the rising rotor-speed. Especially, Coulomb friction damping force between the bump foil and housing surface contributes to the enhancement of direct damping coefficient value. Whirl frequency ratio of the <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> seal without bump shows somewhat small in low speed ranges. When bump foil thickness is 0. 074 mm or 0. 1 mm, WFR is insensitive in rotating speed and pressure.
