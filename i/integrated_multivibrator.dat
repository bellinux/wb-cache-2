50|$|Flashing LEDs {{are used}} as {{attention}} seeking indicators without requiring external electronics. Flashing LEDs resemble standard LEDs but they contain an <b>integrated</b> <b>multivibrator</b> circuit that causes the LED to flash with a typical period of one second. In diffused lens LEDs, this circuit is visible as a small black dot. Most flashing LEDs emit light of one color, but more sophisticated devices can flash between multiple colors and even fade through a color sequence using RGB color mixing.|$|E
40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{determination}} of ethanol in petrol using contactless impedance detector. Planar and tubular detection cells of various geometric parameters are tested. The cells are connected as a frequency determining capacitor in an <b>integrated</b> <b>multivibrator</b> circuit. Analyzed gasoline, whose dielectric constant depends on the ethanol content, forms the dieletric of the capacity cells. Therefore, for various contents of ethanol, {{the capacity of the}} detection cells varies and the multivibrator generates different frequency. Based on the calibration, the content of ethanol can be determined from the frequency measured. The results obtained are compared with those obtained by gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection...|$|E
