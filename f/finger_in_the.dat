5|$|The {{vertebral}} column {{was composed of}} nine cervical (neck) vertebrae, 13 dorsal (back) vertebrae, three sacral (hip) vertebrae, and at least 40 caudal (tail) vertebrae. The pubis faced forward, as with most saurischians. It had a slighter build than that of Plateosaurus, an otherwise similar dinosaur. The neck was proportionally longer than in most other plateosaurids, with the foremost cervicals being four times {{the length of the}}ir width. The forelimbs were only half the length of the hindlimbs but quite powerful, as indicated by the broad upper end of the humerus that provided attachment areas for a large arm musculature. Like Plateosaurus, it had five digits on each hand and foot. The hand was short and wide, with a large sickle shaped thumb claw used for feeding or defense against predators. The thumb was the longest <b>finger</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hand, while the fourth and fifth digits were tiny, giving the forepaws a lopsided look.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We here {{investigate}} {{a new approach}} to creating high quality-factor resonators for filtering and oscillator applications based on STW wave propagation. We show that breaking the finger width periodicity, as opposed to the spacing between fingers, is an effective way of reducing spurious bulk modes and hence unwanted ripples out of the resonance frequency range. However, this improvement in terms of filtering applications comes with the drawback of a decreased quality factor which makes such devices unsuitable to oscillator applications. On the other hand, we conclude from simulations that narrow <b>fingers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> transducers surrounded by wide <b>fingers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mirrors will lead to highest quality factors but increased losses. Experimental results at 750 MHz and 1. 015 GHz are presented with loaded quality factors <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 5800 - 6700 range and are compared with a simplified mixed matrix based model. I...|$|R
