The coating will pass through the gaps between the wires and level off at a uniform thickness.There are two main types of <b>wire</b> <b>bars.</b> Close <b>wire</b> wound <b>bars</b> will produce coating layers from 4 to 120μm.

2500|$|Drawing is a {{metalworking}} {{process which}} uses tensile forces to stretch metal or glass. As the metal is drawn (pulled), it stretches thinner, into a desired shape and thickness. Drawing is classified in two types: sheet metal drawing and <b>wire,</b> <b>bar,</b> and tube drawing. The specific definition for sheet metal drawing {{is that it}} involves plastic deformation over a curved axis. For <b>wire,</b> <b>bar,</b> and tube drawing the starting stock is drawn through a die to reduce its diameter and increase its length. Drawing is usually done at room temperature, thus classified a cold working process, however it may be performed at elevated temperatures to hot work large wires, rods or hollow sections {{in order to reduce}} forces.|$|R

40|$|A {{fabrication}} {{technique for}} producing flexible superconductor wire by extrusion of {{a composite of}} Ag 2 O‐YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 −x is reported. During the course of processing, the superconductive transition of the starting powder is maintained, thus obviating the need for subsequent heat treatment. This nonpoisoning behavior of Ag 2 O is of significant technical importance. Scanning electron fractography reveals a mixed mode fracture behavior of the material and the evidence of ductility. Magnetic measurements on the <b>extruded</b> <b>wires</b> show an onset temperature of 91 K. Resistivity measurements indicate that the electrical resistance of the as‐extruded wire essentially vanishes at liquid‐nitrogen temperature...|$|R
40|$|Friction {{extrusion}} is a {{novel and}} efficient manufacturing process for producing high-value material (e. g., metal wires) from low-cost precursors (e. g., powders) or from recycled metal wastes (e. g., chips). In the friction extrusion process, the precursor material experiences high pressure and frictional heating and undergoes large deformation and material flow before it is extruded to create the final product {{in the form of}} a wire. A three-dimensional thermo-fluid computational fluid dynamicsmodel has been developed to study the heat transfer and material flow patterns in the friction extrusion process. The precursor material in this study is aluminum alloy 6061 and it is modeled as a viscous non-Newtonian fluid with a viscosity that is temperature and strain rate dependent. The heat source because of viscous dissipation and frictional heating is modeled with a user defined volume heat source in a thin layer volume near the tool–precursor interface. The total heat source is taken to equal to the mechanical power input in the friction extrusion experiment. It is found that temperature predictions match reasonably well with experimental measurements. In order to study material flow patterns in the friction extrusion process, a small wire of different material was inserted into the precursor material in the experiment as a marker material and the marker material can be observed on <b>extruded</b> <b>wire</b> cross sections. Correspondingly, in the modeling, massless solid particles were released in the fluid as marker particles and they can be tracked and observed on <b>extruded</b> <b>wire</b> cross sections. The massless marker particles do not affect the fluid field and they flow with nearby fluid so they can represent the motion of the fluid where they were initially released. Both predictions and experimental measurements about the markers observed on <b>extruded</b> <b>wire</b> cross-sections show some features in common, such as (a) markers form continuous spirals on the cross-sections, and (b) the number of spirals decreases as friction extrusion continues. Results of this study suggest that the proposed thermo-fluid model can capture the main features of the heat transfer and material flow phenomena in the friction extrusion process and can be used to provide reasonable predictions of the temperature and material flow fields in the friction extrusion process.

40|$|The novel {{production}} method of screw extrusion {{was used to}} produce an electrical conducting wire of commercial pure aluminium. To optimize electrical properties, effects of impurity atoms in solid solution were examined by resistance measurements and microstructural analysis in LOM, SEM and TEM.

Precipitation kinetics, summarized in a newly assessed TTT-diagram, showed the most rapid precipitation around 450 degree Celcius. The produced screw <b>extruded</b> <b>wire</b> had a fine sub-grain structure arising from repeated deformation, recrystallization and concurrent precipitation during extrusion. The final product performed very well in terms of ultimate tensile strength and electrical conductivity; 61 MPa and 64. 30 %IACS, respectively.
