When the joint was made at a friction pressure of 30 MPa with a friction speed of 27 · 5 s− 1, the upsetting (deformation) occurred at the P-Al base metal. P-Al transferred to the half radius region of the weld interface on the low carbon steel side, and then it transferred toward the entire weld interface. When the joint was made at a friction time of 0 · 9 s, i. e. just after the initial peak of the friction torque, it had ∼ 93 % <b>joint</b> <b>efficiency</b> and fractured on the P-Al side. This joint had no intermetallic compound at the weld interface. Then, the <b>joint</b> <b>efficiency</b> slightly decreased with increasing friction time.

40|$|Aluminum-lithium alloys exhibit high strength, high elastic modulus, and low density {{as well as}} {{excellent}} cryogenic {{mechanical properties}} making them ideal material candidates for cryogenic tanks. NASA has proposed the use of 'built-up' structure for panels fabricated into cryogenic tanks replacing current conventional machining. Superplastically formed stiffeners would be joined to sheet (tank skin) that had been roll formed to the radius of the tank {{in order to produce}} panels. Aluminum-lithium alloys of interest for producing the built-up structure include alloy 2095 -T 6 stiffeners to 2095 -T 8 sheet and alloy 8090 -T 6 stiffeners to 2090 -T 83 sheet. Laser welding, with comparable joint properties, offers the following advantages over conventional welding: higher production rates, minimal degradation within the heat affected zones, and full process automation. This study established process parameters for laser beam welding, mechanical property determinations, metallographic characterization, and fabrication of prototype panels. Tensile tests representing partial penetration of the skin alloys provided <b>joint</b> <b>efficiencies</b> between 65 and 77 percent, depending upon alloy and degree of penetration. Results of tension shear tests of lap welds indicated that the combination of 2095 -T 6 to 2090 -T 8 exhibited significantly higher weld shear strength at the interface in comparison to welds of 8090 -T 6 to 2090 -T 83. The increased shear strength associated with 2095 is believed to be due to the alloy's ability to precipitation strengthening (naturally age) after welding...|$|R

It is shown that the usual convexity conditions that apply to Linear Programming problems are satisfied in this case. First order Kuhn-Tucker conditions are derived and interpreted.
