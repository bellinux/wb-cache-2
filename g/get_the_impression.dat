Any would-be predators that pass by after a worm has lost its crown will <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that the worm has died; this protects the animal from further attack. The crown typically reappears after about two weeks. When it does reappear, it is initially smaller in size, but it eventually grows back to its former size and color.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of this {{analysis}} an important point appears: all the fictitious accelerations must be included to obtain the correct trajectory. In particular, besides the Coriolis acceleration, the centrifugal force plays an essential role. It is easy to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> from verbal discussions of the cannonball problem, which focus on displaying the Coriolis effect particularly, that the Coriolis force is the only factor that must be considered, but that is not so. A turntable for which the Coriolis force is the only factor is the parabolic turntable. A somewhat more complex situation is the idealized example of flight routes over long distances, where the centrifugal force of the path and aeronautical lift are countered by gravitational attraction.|$|E
25|$|The {{surface of}} the Earth is a {{rotating}} reference frame. To solve classical mechanics problems exactly in an Earth-bound reference frame, three fictitious forces must be introduced: the Coriolis force, the centrifugal force (described below) and the Euler force. The Euler force is typically ignored because the variations in the angular velocity of the rotating Earth surface are usually insignificant. Both of the other fictitious forces are weak compared to most typical forces in everyday life, {{but they can be}} detected under careful conditions. For example, Léon Foucault was able to show that the Coriolis force results from the Earth's rotation using the Foucault pendulum. If the Earth were to maintain its current shape but rotate twenty times faster (making each day only ~72 minutes long), people could easily <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that such fictitious forces were pulling on them, as on a spinning carousel--those in temperate and tropical latitudes would, in fact, need to hold on in order to avoid being launched into orbit by the centrifugal force.|$|E

25|$|A {{few days}} later, the last {{chief of the}} Natchez arrived at the Tunica village with a hundred men, and {{an unknown number of}} women and children. They also {{concealed}} Chickasaw and Koroa in the canebrake around the village. Cahura-Joligo informed them that he could not receive them unless they gave up their arms. They replied that this was their intention, but asked if they could keep them awhile longer so their women did not <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that their unarmed men were prisoners. He consented to their request and proceeded to distribute food to his new guests. A celebratory dance was held till after midnight, when the Tunica retired to their cabins, thinking that the Natchez would do the same. The Natchez, Chicasaw and Koroa, attacked their hosts in their cabins, and killed all they managed to surprise while asleep. Cahura-Joligo killed four Natchez during the fighting, but was eventually killed along with twelve of his warriors. His war-chief Brides les Boeufs (Buffalo Tamer), with a dozen of his warriors, repulsed the attack and retook the Head Chief's cabin. He rallied his remaining warriors and, after fighting for five days and nights without interruption, regained control of the village. Twenty Tunica were killed and as many wounded in the fighting. They had killed 33 Natchez warriors and took three prisoners. Later they burned them in ritual punishment for the attack.|$|E

500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} were mixed, calling it a [...] "slow start to the season." [...] Dan Iverson of IGN {{reviewed}} the episode positively, noting that the episode [...] "would make even the most anti-Family Guy television viewers out there laugh pretty hard." [...] Iverson went on to comment, however, that [...] "it probably won't be remembered as fondly as some {{of the episode}}s from the first few seasons." [...] For him, the [...] "funniest aspect of the episode" [...] was the radio scene, in which [...] "we <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that [...] are immature, simple-minded idiots." [...] Brett Love of TV Squad reviewed the episode slightly more negatively, stating that [...] "the whole Peter story just didn't do much for me." [...] Love did find that the [...] "Stewie and Brian stuff was {{the best part of the}} episode," [...] but went on to proclaim that [...] "there are 20 more episodes to get it right." [...] In his review of the Family Guy Volume 5 box set, Francis Rizzo of DVD Talk wrote that the radio subplot is [...] "a perfect parody of everything that's wrong in radio." ...|$|E

500|$|The actress went on {{to explain}} that the storyline showed how Toyah regretted her actions and that young female viewers could learn from her mistake. She added [...] "Anyone {{watching}} can see Dobber is just using Toyah and I hope the message gets across to other girls not to fall into the same trap." [...] Toyah did not use protection with Dobber, so her sister, Leanne, persuaded her {{to go to the doctor}} for the morning-after pill. Taylor praised Leanne for being Toyah's [...] "conscience and the voice of common sense". She thought that Leanne had given her good and responsible advice on how to deal with what happened. The Daily Record's John Millar agreed with Taylor and wrote that the storyline was [...] "building to a stark warning for the millions of teenagers tuning into the Street." [...] Millar believed at no time did the viewers <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that Toyah was doing something [...] "admirable" [...] and proclaimed that Toyah was [...] "the sort of girl who needs care and affection, which explains why the poor soul was coaxed into losing her virginity after a holiday romance convinced her that she was in love." ...|$|E
500|$|At Metacritic, which assigns a {{normalised}} rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream critics, the album has received an average score of 82, indicating universal acclaim, based on 14 reviews. Pitchfork stated that [...] "One {{of the best}} things about Glass Swords is that, for all of its pop-goes-clubbing bluster, it's also as psychedelic, where the devil's in the zillion little details zigzagging across the tracks" [...] and that [...] "there's not a lot here that will redefine your ideas of what dubstep or electronic music in general can do. For all of Rustie's skill as a sculptor of very 21st-century beats, Glass Swords can feel just as much like a [...] "greatest bits" [...] collage." [...] Fact gave the album a five out of five rating, stating that [...] "you <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that it's the point Rustie has been building up to for the last five years; an album made in relative isolation, with zero self-consciousness, shame or thought for trend behind it." [...] Drowned in Sound gave the album an eight out of ten rating, finding that the album is [...] "equally impressive is the fact that this formula (or lack thereof) never grows tired. Thirteen tracks of excess could easily have been a recipe for sighs, but instead it is consistently addictive and grin-inducing." ...|$|E
500|$|Murad's force {{contained}} approximately 80,000 men and two cannons, {{which could}} fire [...] balls. His army contained a fresh corps of Janissaries, and 3,000 debtors and bankrupts fighting {{to regain their}} freedom. The Count of Gurrica persuaded Skanderbeg to incorporate a scorched earth strategy, by destroying all supplies that might {{be used by the}} Ottoman army. The Ottoman force paraded around the fortress and offered 300,000 aspras (Turkish currency) to those who would open the gate and let the Ottoman army in the fortress without a fight. The heralds proposing these offers went into the fortress at night time and the garrison commanders gave them a splendid dinner, so that they would <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that the enemy was well prepared for a lengthy siege. After the dinner their offers were rejected and they were sent back to the Sultan. The size of the Ottoman army troubled Skanderbeg because of the effects it could have on the morale of his soldiers and on the local population which supported the princes. Skanderbeg thus moved from village to village, disguised as a common soldier, and invoked the fighting spirit of the population. As a result of this activity, the local chieftains agreed to fight the Ottomans and persuaded Skanderbeg to draw up his plans in concert with theirs.|$|E

500|$|This {{crossover}} occurred {{through the}} Simpsons episode [...] "A Star Is Burns" [...] (1995). Groening was not {{fond of the}} crossover, publicly citing it as a thirty-minute advertisement for The Critic. Brooks said, [...] "for years, Al and Mike were two guys who worked their hearts out on this show, staying up until 4 {{in the morning to}} get it right. The point is, Matt's name has been on Mike's and Al's scripts and he has taken plenty of credit for a lot of their great work. In fact, he is the direct beneficiary of their work. The Critic is their shot and he should be giving them his support." [...] Reiss stated that he was a [...] "little upset" [...] by Groening's actions and that [...] "this taints everything at the last minute. [...] This episode doesn't say 'Watch The Critic all over it." [...] Jean added [...] "What bothers me about all of this, is that now people may <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that this Simpsons episode is less than good. It stands on its own even if The Critic never existed." [...] On Fox, The Critic was again short-lived, broadcasting ten episodes before its cancellation. A total of only 23 episodes were produced, and it returned briefly in 2000 with a series of ten Internet broadcast webisodes. The series has since developed a cult following thanks to reruns on Comedy Central and its complete series release on DVD.|$|E

Catalano swore three times to the terrorists that he was alone and did not reveal Lepère's presence. The Kouachi brothers were never aware of him being there. Lepère hid inside a cardboard box and sent the Gendarmerie text messages for around three hours during the siege, providing them with [...] "tactical elements such as [...] location inside the premises".|$|E

2500|$|Alexis Petridis of The Guardian, however, was {{favourable}} of 'Gotta Be You', {{referring to}} Austin as [...] " [...] clearly knows where Sugababes' strengths lie", further stating [...] " [...] adds a light, but nonetheless thrilling dusting of monotonal crunk-influenced synthesised honking to 'Gotta Be You'." [...] He was less favourable about their cover of 'Obsession', stating, [...] "sadly, Sugababes' version sands off the edges rather than amps up the lunacy: what's left is like 1980s night at karaoke". He also remarks that [...] "you <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> {{that they would}} be happier making R". In conclusion, however, he states that [...] "the album's strike rate is far higher than you might expect from a manufactured pop act's fourth album; it avoids the obvious pitfalls and its highpoints are genuinely high", giving the album 3 out of 5 stars.|$|E
2500|$|Los Angeles Times writer Jeff Weiss {{stated that}} [...] "No Mercy is largely {{consumed}} with penitence and a looming penitentiary sentence". Pitchfork Media's Tom Breihan commented that [...] "Throughout No Mercy, Tip remains an absolutely impeccable rapper, delivering even his lamest pieces of self-help nothingness in masterful clumps of singsong cadence and slurry double-time bounce. I <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> {{that he could}} still absolutely rip a track to shreds if he could only get himself excited about the prospect. And every so often, No Mercy crackles to life, and we hear flashes of the rap hero Tip could still be". Giving it a 4 out of 10 rating, David Amidon of PopMatters stated that [...] "While peaks and valleys {{can be used in}} a positive sense, the way Tip's offering here dips in and out of quality seems much too violent for most longtime followers to keep up with. There are references to making terrible choices personally, which is fine, but as a musician one assumes a certain responsibility to avoid those professional pitfalls as well". Rolling Stone writer Jody Rosen cited it as T.I.'s desire for redemption takes on gospel overtones and [...] "Make no mistake, T.I. still knows how to throw a party. No Mercy is a sleek pop-rap record: 14 taut, catchy songs with beats from big-name producers and an array of top-flight guests. No Mercy suggests that, among A-list rappers, T.I. is the one with the most well-honed pop sensibility".|$|E
