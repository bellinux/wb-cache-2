40|$|The Tn 1 and Tn 3 {{elements}} {{are closely related}} transposons which carry the structural gene for ampicillin resistance. Two classes of deletion mutants of the plasmid pMB 8 ::Tn 3 (RSF 1050) are unable to transpose ampicillin resistance but can be complemented in trans by a coresident Tn 1 or Tn 3 element. The analysis of the <b>sequences</b> <b>transposed</b> upon complementation of one class of mutants (type I) showed that the mutant element had undergone bona fide transposition. Complementation of the type II mutants led to the transposition of a sequence analogous to bacteriophage mu-promoted integration of non-mu DNA. The <b>transposed</b> <b>sequence</b> consisted of two Tn 3 elements which flanked a single copy of the pMB 8 portion of the RSF 1050 genome. Complementation data indicated that the type II mutants are defective {{in at least one}} trans-acting function which must be supplied for transposition to occur. The nature of <b>sequence</b> <b>transposed</b> from the type II mutant is the consequence of a defective cis-acting function (or site). In addition, the type II mutants were defective in a trans-acting function which regulated the frequency of transposition...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBacteriorhodopsin (BR) is a {{membrane}} protein of known structure, widely {{used for the}} homology modeling of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR). The observation of apparently <b>transposed</b> <b>sequence</b> similarities between some of the helical domains of BR and GPCR {{has led to the}} suggestion that exon shuffling may have occurred in the later evolution of GPCR, which would necessitate a different folding pattern for the seven transmembrane helices of GPCR. An alternate hypothesis is that duplication occurred in the evolution of an ancestral gene, such that helices 5 – 7 originated as duplicates of helices 1 – 3, leading to intragenic as well as intergenic similarities between helices 1 – 3 and 5 – 7 of BR and various GPCR. Analyses of GPCR and BR sequences suggest that such a duplication may have occurred; symmetry within the BR structure is also consistent with homology between these two regions. The hypothesis of evolution by duplication is consistent with the conventional, unshuffled homology model, which is also supported by the obvious conservation of the retinal binding Lys moiety on helix 7 in both BR and the mammalian opsins...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{formally}} exact statistical field theory for describing classical fluids with ingredients {{similar to those}} introduced in quantum field theory. We consider the following essential and related problems : i) {{how to find the}} correct field functional (Hamiltonian) which determines the partition function, ii) how to introduce in a field theory the equivalent of the indiscernibility of particles, iii) how to test the validity of this approach. We can use a simple Hamiltonian in which a local <b>functional</b> <b>transposes,</b> in terms of fields, the equivalent of the indiscernibility of particles. The diagrammatic expansion and the renormalization of this term is presented. This corresponds to a non standard problem in Feynman expansion and requires a careful investigation. Then a non-local term associated with an interaction pair potential is introduced in the Hamiltonian. It has been shown that there exists a mapping between this approach and the standard statistical mechanics given in terms of Mayer function expansion. We show on three properties (the chemical potential, the so-called contact theorem and the interfacial properties) that in the field theory the correlations are shifted on non usual quantities.

40|$|The genes {{encoding}} the variable, joining {{and constant}} regions of human immunoglobulin light chains have been localized {{to the short}} arm of chromosome 2. However, several VK genes lie outside of the locus: a single copy cluster of five VK genes is located on chromosome 22; an isolated but amplified VkI gene is found on chromosome 1; and several isolated VkI genes are on as-yet-unidentified chromosomes other than chromosome 2. Vk genes not contained within the kappa locus are termed orphons. We have attempted to gain insight into the mechanism of transposition of both the chromosome 22 cluster and the several amplified VkI genes by searching in the kappa locus for a parent copy of the former, and by analyzing the junctions between transposed VKI-containing segments and adjacent non-amplified regions. The chromosome 22 orphon cluster must have been non-duplicatively <b>transposed.</b> <b>Sequence</b> features at the junctions of this and other orphon regions are direct and inverted repeats, and, in one case, an Alu repeat.

40|$|The {{dipteran}} Chironomus tentans has complex tandemly repeated 350 -bp DNA sequences at or {{near the}} chromosome ends. As in Drosophila melanogaster, short simple repeats with cytosines and guanines in different strands have never been observed. We were therefore interested in learning whether the Chironomus repeats could have evolved from simple sequence telomeric DNA, which might suggest that they constitute a functional equivalent. We screened for repeat units with evolutionarily ancient features within the tandem arrays and recovered two clones with a less-evolved structure. Sequence analysis reveals that the present-day 350 -bp unit probably evolved from a simpler 165 -bp unit through the acquisition of <b>transposed</b> <b>sequences.</b> The 165 -bp unit contains DNA with a highly biased distribution of cytosine and guanine between the two strands, although with the ratios inverted in two minor parts of the repeat. It is largely built up of short degenerate subrepeats for which most of the sequence can be reconstructed. The consensus for the subrepeat sequence is similar to the simple telomeric repeat sequences of several kinds of eukaryotes.

This is done without commitment to a specific functional language. We analyse the design space for implementational models of functional strategies. For completeness, we also provide an operational reference model for implementing functional strategies (in Haskell).

In this report, we analyze {{the effects of}} eu-heterochromatic rearrangements involving a cluster of the X-linked heterochromatic (Xh) Stellate repeats on the representation of these sequences in salivary gland polytene chromosomes. The discontinuous heterochromatic Stellate cluster contains specific restriction fragments that were mapped along the distal region of Xh. We found that transposition of a fragment of the Stellate cluster into euchromatin resulted in its replication in polytene chromosomes. Interestingly, only the Stellate repeats that remain within the pericentric Xh and are close to a new eu-heterochromatic boundary were replicated, strongly suggesting {{the existence of a}} spreading effect exerted by the adjacent euchromatin. Internal rearrangements of the distal Xh did not affect Stellate polytenization. We also demonstrated trans effects exerted by heterochromatic blocks on the replication of the rearranged heterochromatin; replication of <b>transposed</b> Stellate <b>sequences</b> was suppressed by a deletion of Xh and restored by addition of Y heterochromatin. This phenomenon is discussed in light of a possible role of heterochromatic proteins in the process of heterochromatin underrepresentation in polytene chromosomes...|$|R

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. May 2008. Major: Molecular, Cellular, Developmental Biology and Genetics. Advisor: Dr. R. Scott McIvor. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); viii, 164 pages. Science and medicine are merging in development of gene therapy techniques {{that will likely}} become a recognized method {{for the treatment of}} human disease within our lifetime. The basic goal of gene therapy is to deliver therapeutic genes to target cell populations, allowing the cells themselves to generate a therapeutic gene product, for example to provide a gene product which is missing in the patient. Most of the current gene therapy trials have been based on the use of viral vectors to deliver therapeutic genes. These viral vectors are being used because they have already evolved mechanisms to efficiently enter cells. Because of the complications inherent in the use of viruses for delivery, a nonviral approach would have several advantages if it could achieve similar levels of efficiency. To this end, I set forth to characterize the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon system as a potential tool for effective nonviral gene transfer and its eventual use in clinical gene therapy protocols. The SB transposon system consists of a DNA cargo, usually plasmid based, which {{in the presence of the}} transposase integrates into chromosomal DNA. One of the key concerns for any gene delivery system is its ability to function in cells that are not dividing, as many cells in the body that are potential targets for gene therapy are non-dividing. In a series of in vitro experiments utilizing various techniques to halt cell division, I determined that cell division is likely not necessary for SB-mediated integration and expression to occur. Secondly, when tracking expression in vivo, it is not possible to distinguish the amount of gene product produced from integrated vs. nonintegrated transposons. Differentiating between these two sources of transgene expression soon after delivery, will allow insight into transposition efficiency in vivo that can relate to its clinical use. Using LoxP recombination sites, a Cre recombinase inducible mouse strain and transposons carrying a murine erythropoietin gene (Epo), I was able to silence expression from nonintegrated transposons and quantify in vivo gene expression specifically from <b>transposed</b> <b>sequences.</b> Over-expression of erythropoietin in the murine model became an unexpected problem due to subsequent erythrocytosis. Delivery of plasmid DNA to the livers of mice results in an initial spike of transgene expression and when coupled with the subsequent ubiquitous expression of the Epo transgene, circulating Epo levels remained greatly elevated, leading to serious health complications and death. To circumvent the initial spike of EPO expression, an inducible promoter was constructed that responds to hypoxic conditions. In this way, expression of erythropoietin should be regulated to prevent over-expression. Insights gained from these studies will contribute to our understanding of the capabilities of the SB system and its potential application to the treatment of human disease in the future...|$|R

In the first project, {{we consider the}} conformer space of melatonin as a a representative example of “real-life” flexible biomolecules. Geometries for all 52 unique conformers are optimized using spin-component scaled MP 2, and then relative energies are obtained at the CCSD (T) level near the complete basis set limit. These are then used to validate a variety of DFT methods with and without empirical dispersion corrections, {{as well as some}} lower-level ab initio methods. Basis set convergence is found to be relatively slow due to internal C-H…O and C-H…N contacts. Absent dispersion corrections, many DFT <b>functionals</b> will <b>transpose</b> the two lowest conformers. Dispersion corrections resolve the problem for most functionals. Double hybrids yield particularly good performance, as does MP 2. 5. In the second project, we propose a simple DFT-based diagnostic for nondynamical correlation effects. Aλ= (1 -TAE [ΧλC]/TAE[XC]) /λ where TAE is the total atomization energy, XC the “pure” DFT exchange-correlation functional, and ΧλC the corresponding hybrid with 100 λ% HF-type exchange. The diagnostic is a good predictor for sensitivity of energetics to the level of theory, unlike most of the wavefunction-based diagnostics. For GGA functionals, Aλ values approaching unity indicate severe non-dynamical correlation. The diagnostic is only weakly sensitive to the basis set (beyond polarized double zeta) and can be applied to problems beyond practical reach of wavefunction ab-initio methods required for other diagnostics...|$|R
40|$|Embryo {{formation}} {{is the first}} patterning process during vegetative plant growth. Using transposons as insertional mutagens in Arabidopsis, we identified the mutant edd 1 that shows embryo-defective development. The insertion mutation is lethal, arresting embryo growth between the globular and heart stages of embryonic development. The mutant phenotype cosegregates with a <b>transposed</b> Dissociation element. <b>Sequences</b> flanking the <b>transposed</b> element were isolated and used to isolate a full-length cDNA clone representing the wild-type EDD 1 gene. Complementation of the mutant through Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer of an EDD 1 wild-type copy as well as loss of the transposon concomitant with phenotypic reversion demonstrated that the transposon had caused the mutation. Based on homology to Escherichia coli, the EDD 1 gene is predicted to encode a novel glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GlyRS) {{that has not been}} identified previously in higher plants. An N-terminal portion of the plant protein is able to direct a marker protein into pea chloroplasts.

40|$|During {{the last}} 20 years, {{molecular}} and biochemical data concerning G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have accumulated, providing a detailed {{characterization of the}} structure and function of this large family of receptors.

40|$|Cancer {{represents}} a leading of {{cause of death}} in the developed world, inflicting tremendous suffering and plundering billions from health budgets. The traditional treatment approaches of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy have achieved little in terms of cure for this deadly disease. Instead, life is prolonged for many, with dubious quality of life, only for disease to reappear with the inevitable fatal outcome. “Blue sky” thinking is required to tackle this disease and improve outcomes. The realisation and acceptance of the intrinsic role of the immune system in cancer pathogenesis, pathophysiology and treatment represented such a “blue sky” thought. Moreover, the embracement of immunotherapy, the concept of targeting immune cells rather than the tumour cells themselves, {{represents a}} paradigm shift in the approach to cancer therapy. The harnessing of immunotherapy demands radical and innovative therapeutic endeavours – endeavours such as gene and cell therapies and RNA interference, which two decades ago existed as mere concepts. This thesis straddles the frontiers of fundamental tumour immunobiology and novel therapeutic discovery, design and delivery. The work undertaken focused on two distinct immune cell populations known to undermine the immune response to cancer – suppressive T cells and macrophages. Novel RNAi mediators were designed, validated and incorporated into clinically relevant gene therapy vectors – involving a traditional lentiviral vector approach, and a novel bacterial vector strategy. Chapter 2 deals with the design of novel RNAi mediators against FOXP 3 – a crucial regulator of the immunosuppressive regulatory T cell population. Two mediators were tested and validated. The superior mediator was taken forward as part of work in chapter 3. Chapter 3 deals with <b>transposing</b> the RNA <b>sequence</b> from chapter 2 into a DNA-based construct and subsequent incorporation into a lentiviral-based vector system. The lentiviral vector was shown to mediate gene delivery in vitro and functional RNAi was achieved against FOXP 3. Proof of gene delivery was further confirmed in vivo in tumour-bearing animals. Chapter 4 focuses on a different immune cell population – tumour-associated macrophages. Non-invasive bacteria were explored as a specific means of delivering gene therapy to this phagocytic cell type. Proof of delivery was shown in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, in vivo delivery of a gene by this method achieved the desired immune response in terms of cytokine profile. Overall, the data presented here advance exploration within the field of cancer immunotherapy, introduce novel delivery and therapeutic strategies, and demonstrate pre-clinically the potential for such novel anti-cancer therapies...|$|R

Evidence shows that these <b>sequences</b> <b>transpose</b> in the genome of T. ferrooxidans and help the bacterium adapt to changing environment of various salt concentrations and temperatures. Twelve strains, including the type strain ATCC 2370 have multiple copies of both families.

Three strains of Thiobacillus thiooxidans were similarly analyzed. Two of the strains have both families of repeated DNA sequences and the other strain have neither family. Analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphism indicated that the multiple copies of both, family 2 are conserved within and between strain of T. ferrooxidans and also between T. thiooxidans. In contrast the genomic locations in which members of family 1 and family 2 are found can vary between strains of T. ferrooxidans.

Plasmid DNA from transformant E. coli cells was isolated and the size of DNA was compared with plasmid DNA of T. ferrooxidans L 9. The transformant E. coli HB 101 cells were grown on plates containing different concentration of 9 antibiotics and at least three metal ions.
