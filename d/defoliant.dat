5|$|Up to {{four million}} people in Vietnam {{were exposed to the}} <b>defoliant,</b> with around one million now {{suffering}} serious health issues. The chemical is capable of damaging genes, resulting in deformities among the offspring of exposed victims. The U.S. government has documented higher cases of leukemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and various kinds of cancer in exposed veterans. Agent Orange also caused enormous environmental damage in Vietnam. Over 3,100,000 hectares (31,000km2 or 11,969mi2) of forest were defoliated. Defoliants eroded tree cover and seedling forest stock, making reforestation difficult in numerous areas. Animal species diversity sharply reduced in contrast with unsprayed areas.|$|E

40|$|A {{field study}} was {{conducted}} at the Maricopa Agricultural Center to {{determine the influence of}} plant water stress on the effectiveness of <b>defoliants</b> and yield of cotton. Irrigation termination dates of 12 August, 24 August, and 8 September were used to achieve different levels of plant water stress at the time <b>defoliants</b> were applied (22 September). The <b>defoliants</b> tested performed well on cotton, which had termination irrigations in August. Def 6 was not as effective as other <b>defoliants</b> in defoliating plants with an 8 September termination irrigation, unless used in combination with Prep. Cotton with an 8 September termination irrigation produced lint yields 9 % higher than cotton with August irrigation termination dates...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} at the University of Arizona Maricopa Agricultural Center, Maricopa, AZ in 1994 to {{determine the influence of}} plant water status at the time of defoliation on effectiveness of <b>defoliants</b> and yield of Pima cotton. Several irrigation termination dates were used to achieve different levels of plant water stress at the time <b>defoliants</b> were applied. A single application of <b>defoliants</b> did not provide adequate defoliation under the conditions of this test. The earliest irrigation termination date resulted in the highest defoliation percentage. High CWSI values at the time <b>defoliants</b> were applied were related to the highest defoliation percentages, but were not necessarily related to satisfactory defoliation. The CWSI appears to have limited value as a guide to determine when to defoliate Pima cotton...|$|R
5|$|Mayerson, with Sgt. Charles E. Hartz {{as their}} {{principal}} client, filed the first US Agent Orange class-action lawsuit, in Pennsylvania in 1980, for the injuries military personnel in Vietnam suffered through exposure to toxic dioxins in the <b>defoliant.</b> Attorney Mayerson co-wrote the brief that certified the Agent Orange Product Liability {{action as a}} class action, the largest ever filed as of its filing. Hartz's deposition {{was one of the}} first ever taken in America, and the first for an Agent Orange trial, for the purpose of preserving testimony at trial, as it was understood that Hartz would not live to see the trial because of a brain tumor that began to develop while he was a member of Tiger Force, Special Forces, and LRRPs in Vietnam. The firm also located and supplied critical research to the Veterans' lead expert, Dr. Codario, including about 100 articles from toxicology journals dating back more than a decade, as well as data about where herbicides had been sprayed, what the effects of dioxin had been on animals and humans, and every accident in factories where herbicides were produced or dioxin was a contaminant of some chemical reaction.|$|E

5|$|Between 1950 and 1952, {{trials were}} {{conducted}} in Tanganyika, at Kikore and Stunyansa, to test arboricides and <b>defoliants</b> under tropical conditions. The chemicals involved were 2,4-D, 2,4,5-T, and endothall (3,6-endoxohexahydrophthalic acid). During 1952–53, the unit supervised the aerial spraying of 2,4,5-T over the Waturi peninsula in Kenya to assess the value of <b>defoliants</b> in the eradication of tsetse fly.|$|R

25|$|The <b>defoliant</b> Agent Orange, used {{extensively}} by British {{forces in the}} Malayan Emergency and American forces in the Vietnam War, was a mix of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T. The compound 2,4-D is still in use and {{is thought to be}} safe, but 2,4,5-T was more or less banned by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 1979. The dioxin TCDD is an unavoidable contaminant produced in the manufacture of 2,4,5-T. As a result of the integral dioxin contamination, 2,4,5-T has been implicated in leukemia, miscarriages, birth defects, liver damage, and other diseases.|$|E

25|$|Most cotton in the United States, Europe and Australia is {{harvested}} mechanically, {{either by}} a cotton picker, {{a machine that}} removes the cotton from the boll without damaging the cotton plant, or by a cotton stripper, which strips the entire boll off the plant. Cotton strippers are used in regions where it is too windy to grow picker varieties of cotton, and usually after application of a chemical <b>defoliant</b> or the natural defoliation that occurs after a freeze. Cotton is a perennial crop in the tropics, and without defoliation or freezing, the plant will continue to grow.|$|E
25|$|As the PAVN main force laid siege to Long Tieng and Sam Thong, {{a smaller}} column {{branched}} off to attack Bouamlong on 23 February 1970. The PAVN regulars almost overran the ADC irregulars, {{as they came}} up against the perimeter wire. The communists besieged Bouamlong until <b>defoliant</b> cleared the cover from the militia position's perimeter on 6 March. The siege eased for a fortnight. Then, in early April, fresh assailants arrived—the 141st Regiment of the 312th Division. On 10 April 1970, they overran the outlying outpost of Phou Then seven kilometers southwest of Bouamlong. On 13 April, the PAVN threw a heavy barrage of artillery fire at Bouamlong while Dac Cong sappers tunneled into its inner perimeter. The sappers emerged from their tunnels to momentarily overwhelm some startled militia, but were unsuccessful in carrying the position. The siege continued.|$|E
25|$|GM 22 and GM 23 marched northward without {{opposition}} {{through the}} marshy {{southern edge of}} the Plain of Jars for five days, GM 22 leading, GM 23 trailing. Then GM 22 split in two; part of the unit swerved eastward on its own axis of advance. The two prongs of GM 22 would reunite at the Lat Houang junction of Routes 4 and 5 by the end of August. There they found a feast of abandoned livestock. On 31 August, the U.S. Air Force began five days of spraying <b>defoliant</b> on communist-held rice paddies on the plain. The ongoing success of the campaign was credited to air power. Besides the heavy daily contribution of 140 sorties per day of the U.S. Air Force, fewer than 30 Royal Lao Air Force AT-28s flew over 90 sorties per day of close air support.|$|E

40|$|Field {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} over a four year period at the Maricopa Agricultural Center to determine the influence of nitrogen (N) fertility level on the effectiveness of chemical <b>defoliants</b> for short- season cotton production. Excessive N resulted in dense foliage and cotton that was difficult to defoliate. When plants were deficient in N from mid- season to termination, <b>defoliants</b> were very effective, but lint yields were reduced. The effectiveness of <b>defoliants</b> decreased as the petiole NO 3 -N content increased. The optimum fertility program for short-season cotton is one that provides sufficient N during the season to produce maximum lint yields, but allows the crop to become deficient in N {{at the end of the}} season, prior to chemical defoliation...|$|R

500|$|Agent Orange is an {{herbicide}} and <b>defoliant</b> chemical, {{one of the}} [...] "tactical use" [...] Rainbow Herbicides. It {{is widely}} known for its use by the U.S. Military {{as part of its}} herbicidal warfare program, Operation Ranch Hand, during the Vietnam War from 1961 to 1971. It is a mixture of equal parts of two herbicides, 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D.

500|$|Many {{experts at}} the time, {{including}} Arthur Galston, opposed herbicidal warfare due to {{concerns about the}} side effects to humans and the environment by indiscriminately spraying the chemical over a wide area. As early as 1966, resolutions {{were introduced to the}} United Nations charging that the U.S. was violating the 1925 Geneva Protocol, which regulated the use of chemical and biological weapons. The U.S. defeated most of the resolutions, arguing that Agent Orange was not a chemical or a biological weapon as it was considered a herbicide and a <b>defoliant</b> and it was used in effort to destroy plant crops and to deprive the enemy of concealment and not meant to target human beings. The U.S. delegation argued that a weapon, by definition, is any device used to injure, defeat, or destroy living beings, structures, or systems, and Agent Orange did not qualify under that definition. It also argued that if the U.S. were to be charged for using Agent Orange, then Britain and its Commonwealth nations should be charged since they also used it widely during the Malayan Emergency in the 1950s. In 1969, Britain commented on the draft Resolution 2603 (XXIV): [...] "The evidence seems to us to be notably inadequate for the assertion that the use in war of chemical substances specifically toxic to plants is prohibited by international law." ...|$|E

Dropp resulted in higher defoliation percentages and 30 % fewer unopened bolls at harvest than Def- 6. Although the irrigation termination dates provided a range of CWSI values at the time of chemical termination, no clear relationship was found between CWSI values and defoliation percentages. Short season cotton (149 days) produced 3. 2 bales of lint/A compared to 4. 4 bales for a full-season crop (208 days) ...|$|R
