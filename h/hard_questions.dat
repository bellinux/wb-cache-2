40|$|I’ve {{chosen to}} honor Monroe Freedman’s iconic {{essay on the}} <b>hardest</b> <b>questions</b> for a {{criminal}} defense attorney by posing the same question for prosecutors. What is the <b>hardest</b> <b>question</b> for a prosecutor? This in itself is a <b>hard</b> <b>question.</b> The thousands of federal, state, and local prosecutors in the country would likely give widely varying responses – discretionary charging, immunity grants, bargained pleas, unreliable witnesses, police testimony, and disclosure duties, for starters. Too, prosecutors are not a generic group. Just as some defense lawyers might recoil or be indifferent to Freedman’s provocative thesis, so might many prosecutors reject or be indifferent to what I propose is the <b>hardest</b> <b>question</b> for them. For prosecutors, the <b>hardest</b> <b>question</b> they face is whether the person they are prosecuting is actually innocent. Nobody except the accused really knows {{the answer to that}} question, certainly not the prosecutor, however strongly he may believe in the defendant’s guilt and the credibility of the proof...|$|R

2500|$|Lead singer Bono {{explained}} {{that he had to}} ask himself a few <b>hard</b> <b>questions</b> before carrying on recording: [...] "I wanted to check where I was to where I am. So I went back and listened to all the music that made me {{want to be in a}} band, right from the Buzzcocks, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Echo & The Bunnymen, all that stuff. And what was interesting is, that was what a lot of people in bands now are listening to anyway. So in a funny way, it made us completely contemporary." ...|$|E

[...] She also stated, [...] "I'm 29 now, I've talked to everyone who was around during that time, I've asked the <b>hard</b> <b>questions.</b> I do not believe my sister. Our father [...] many things; this is not one of them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Critic Roger Ebert lauded {{the film}} in his film review, writing, [...] "The Official Story is part polemic, part thriller, part tragedy. It belongs on the list with films like Z, Missing and El Norte, which examine the human aspects of {{political}} unrest. It is a movie that asks some very <b>hard</b> <b>questions</b> ... Alicia is played in the movie by Norma Aleandro, whose performance won the best actress award at this year's Cannes Film Festival. It is a performance that {{will be hard to}} forget, particularly since so much of it is internal. Some of the key moments in the film come as we watch Aleandro and realize what must be taking place inside her mind, and inside her conscience. Most political films play outside the countries that they are about; [...] "The Official Story" [...] is now actually playing in Argentina, where it must be almost unbearably painful for some of the members of its audiences. It was almost as painful for me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the Manchester Arena bombing, Hopkins {{wrote that}} [...] "Britain {{is faced with}} some <b>hard</b> <b>questions</b> the people charged with {{protecting}} {{us are going to}} have to answer sooner or later". [...] Hopkins asserted that the suicide bomber, Salman Abedi, was known to the police, and questioned how he was permitted to re-enter Britain unchallenged after visiting Libya. [...] "Our leaders allow such deeply suspicious characters back into Britain," [...] wrote Hopkins, [...] "and then expect us to swallow their lies that we will not give in to terror?" [...] Hopkins also tweeted about the need for a [...] "final solution", the Nazis' term for the Holocaust, on the morning following the May 2017 Manchester Arena bombing. Although the tweet was soon deleted and reworded as a [...] "true solution", Hopkins claimed the original was only a typographical error (she had also misspelled Manchester). The motive for the attack, and the background of the suicide bomber, was unknown at the time Hopkins made the comment.|$|E

2500|$|The Texas Education Agency, Pearson Education (Texas' state {{assessment}} contractor), and Texas {{public school}} educators collaborate {{to create a}} STAAR assessment. First, educators from all over Texas review the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (the statewide curriculum)(state-mandated curriculum) to determine the objectives to assess on each grade level. However, there are usually guidelines to which questions should be tested more or not as much. Then educators determined how the objectives could be best assessed and developed guidelines outlining eligible test content and test-item formats. This information is transferred to the TEA and given to Pearson Education, who develops test items based on the objectives and guidelines, and the TEA reviews those items. Teacher committees are brought to Austin to review the proposed test items, and finally the items are field-tested on some Texas students, called a [...] "mock test." [...] Using the input of the teacher committee {{and the results of}} field-testing, TEA and Pearson build the real STAAR. Very <b>hard</b> <b>questions</b> are usually removed from the test. A more detailed explanation is available from the Student Assessment Division of TEA. Most of the procedure follows the TAKS' development procedure.|$|E
2500|$|While not {{active in}} any Watergate {{activities}} per se, Gray was aware through {{his dealings with}} John Dean that the White House was concerned about what might be discovered from a full-field FBI investigation and explored {{what he could do}} to limit the investigation or shift it away from the Bureau’s jurisdiction. As Dean wrote in his Watergate memoir “Blind Ambition,” he used Gray as a shill knowing that “we could count on Pat Gray to keep the Hunt material from becoming public, and he did not disappoint us.” [...] In fact, even though he thought of this as a political not criminal situation and that he was ultimately serving the President as the “nation’s chief law enforcement officer,” Gray would come dangerously close to collusion because he chose to be useful to the White House without asking the <b>hard</b> <b>questions.</b> Dean goes on to say, “I met Pat Gray secretly at his home in southwest Washington. We were both apprehensive about the meeting as we walked to a park and sat down on a bench overlooking the Potomac, discussing my request to obtain FBI 302s and AirTels on the Watergate investigation." ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 21, 2006, The Globe and Mail {{published}} an editorial on the affair. Calling the controversy a [...] "small uproar", it defended {{the right of}} the journalist to question such phenomena, the [...] "need to ask <b>hard</b> <b>questions</b> and explore uncomfortable avenues", saying that it [...] "merely wondered". The editor claimed not to be surprised by the hundreds of letters of protest received, including those of First Ministers Charest and Harper. The editorial validated Wong's claims of alienation in Quebec, which the Globe called [...] "politics of exclusion". Asking whether this exclusion led to marginalization and perhaps alienation, it said that the answer is [...] "arguable". However, it called the marginalization and alienation of the three shooters [...] "obvious". About whether it could be associated with the murders, it answered that [...] "o such evidence exists". In a sentence apparently intended to balance the assertions, it implied {{at the same time that}} an even worse discrimination existed in the Quebec of the past, as it wrote: [...] "By the same token, it would be remiss to forget that today’s Quebec is not the Quebec of yesteryear." [...] The Globe and Mail did not issue an apology for Jan Wong's piece, as requested by many, including the unanimous House of Commons.|$|E
