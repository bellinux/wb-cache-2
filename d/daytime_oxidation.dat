40|$|Accurate {{characterization}} of gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) chemical oxidation pathways and their kinetics {{is critically important}} for assessing the transfer of atmospheric mercury to bioaquatic systems. Recent comprehensive field measurements {{have suggested that the}} nitrate radical (NO 3) plays a role in efficient nighttime oxidation of GEM, and that the role of the hydroxyl radical (OH) as a GEM oxidant has been underestimated. We used the CAABA/MECCA chemical box model and additional kinetic calculations to analyze these measurement results, in order to investigate the nighttime and <b>daytime</b> <b>oxidation</b> of GEM. We assumed a second-order reaction for the NO 3 induced nighttime oxidation of GEM. Our analysis demonstrated that nighttime oxidation of GEM has {{to be included in the}} model to account for the measured variations in nighttime reactive gaseous mercury (RGM) concentration. A lower limit and best-fit rate constant for GEM nighttime oxidation are provided. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a rate for nighttime oxidation of GEM has been determined based on field measurements. Our analysis further indicates that OH has a much more important role in GEM oxidation than commonly considered. A lower-limit rate constant for the OH–RGM reaction is provided...|$|E
40|$|Shipboard {{measurements}} of atmospheric and seawater DMS {{were made at}} 12 °S, 135 °W for 6 days during March 1992. The mean seawater DMS concentration during this period was 4. 1 ± 0. 45 nM (1 σ, n = 260) and the mean atmospheric DMS mole fraction was 453 ± 93 pmol mol− 1  (1 σ, n = 843). Consistent atmospheric diel cycles were observed, with a nighttime maximum and daytime minimum and an amplitude of approximately 85 pmol mol− 1. Photochemical box model calculations were made to test the sensitivity of atmospheric DMS concentrations to the following parameters: 1) sea-to-air flux, 2) boundary layer height, 3) oxidation rate, and 4) vertical entrainment velocities. The observed relationship between the mean oceanic and atmospheric DMS levels {{require the use of}} an air-sea exchange coefficient which is at the upper limit end of the range of commonly used parameterizations. The amplitude of the diel cycle in atmospheric DMS is significantly larger than that predicted by a photochemical model. This suggests that the sea-to-air DMS flux is higher than was previously thought, and the rate of <b>daytime</b> <b>oxidation</b> of DMS is substantially underestimated by current photochemical models of DMS oxidation...|$|E
40|$|Measurements of {{nitrous acid}} (HONO) were {{performed}} {{as part of}} the 2007 Border Air Quality and Meteorology Study (BAQS-Met) at the Harrow Ontario supersite between 20 June and 10 July 2007. Nitrous acid is an important precursor of the hydroxy radical and understanding its chemistry is important to understanding <b>daytime</b> <b>oxidation</b> chemistry. The HONO measurements were made using a custom built Long Path Absorption Photometer (LOPAP). The goal of this work was to shed light on sources of daytime HONO in the border region. During the course of the campaign HONO mixing ratios consistently exceeded expected daytime values by as much as a factor of 6. Mean daytime concentrations of 61 pptv were observed. While HONO decay began at sunrise, minimum HONO values were not measured until the late afternoon. There was little difference between the daytime (mean= 1. 5 %) and night-time (mean= 1. 7 %) ratios of HONO/NO 2 . Thus there was a very strong daytime source of HONO which is consistent with other recent studies. Correlations of daytime HONO production with a variety of chemical and meteorological parameters indicate that production is dependent on UV radiation, NO 2 and water vapour but is not consistent with a simple gas phase process. Apparent rate constants for the production of HONO from photolyticly excited NO 2 and water vapour vary from 2. 8 – 7. 8 × 10 &minus; 3 molec− 1 s− 1 , during the campaign...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of nitrogen oxides (NOx) on <b>daytime</b> atmospheric <b>oxidation</b> cycles is well known, with clearly defined high- and low-NOx regimes. During the day, oxidation reactions—which {{contribute to the}} formation of secondary pollutants such as ozone—are proportional to NOx at low levels, and inversely proportional to NOx at high levels. Night-time oxidation of volatile organic compounds also influences secondary pollutants but lacks a similar clear definition of high- and low-NOx regimes, even though such regimes exist. Decreases in anthropogenic NOx emissions in the US and Europe coincided with increases in Asia over the last 10 to 20 years, and have altered both <b>daytime</b> and nocturnal <b>oxidation</b> cycles. Here we present measurements of chemical species in the lower atmosphere from day- and night-time research flights over the southeast US in 1999 and 2013, supplemented by atmospheric chemistry simulations. We find that night-time oxidation of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC) is NOx-limited when the ratio of NOx to BVOC is below approximately 0. 5, and becomes independent of NOx at higher ratios. The night-time ratio of NOx to BVOC in 2013 averaged 0. 6 aloft. We suggest that night-time oxidation in the southeast US is in transition between NOx-dominated and ozone-dominated...|$|R
40|$|Only a {{few years}} ago the {{presence}} of Reactive Gaseous Mercury (RGM) was believed to be almost exclusively the result of anthropogenic emissions and that sustained high RGM concentrations in the MBL were not considered likely. During the past ten years, an in-depth investigation was carried out in the Marine Boundary Layer (MBL) of the Mediterranean Sea to quantify and possibly explain spatial and temporal patterns of Hg-species concentrations. This paper provides an overview of modeling results and atmospheric measurements performed during several cruise campaigns performed aboard the Research Vessel (RV) URANIA of the CNR over the Mediterranean sea basin. RGM concentrations have been modelled using a photochemical box model of the MBL and compared to measured data obtained during the research cruises. The comparison results supports the hypothesis that there are <b>daytime</b> mercury <b>oxidation</b> reactions occurring which have not yet been identified. Major findings of key studies carried out during ten years of ship-borne activities have been highlighted...|$|R
40|$|Simulations with a {{regional}} chemical transport model show that anthropogenic emissions of {{volatile organic compounds}} and nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO 2) lead to a dramatic diurnal variation of surface ozone (O 3) in Houston, Texas. During the <b>daytime,</b> photochemical <b>oxidation</b> of volatile organic compounds catalyzed by NOx results in episodes of elevated ambient O 3 levels significantly exceeding the National Ambient Air Quality Standard. The O 3 production rate in Houston is significantly higher than those found in other cities over the United States. At night, a surface NOx maximum occurs because of continuous NO emission from industrial sources, and, consequently, an extensive urban-scale “hole” of surface ozone (< 10 parts per billion by volume in the entire Houston area) {{is formed as a}} result of O 3 removal by NO. The results suggest that consideration of regulatory control of O 3 precursor emissions from the industrial sources is essential to formulate ozone abatement strategies in this region...|$|R
40|$|Using a {{combination}} of field measurement data and a modified photochemical box model, strong evidence is presented {{to suggest that the}} rate of <b>daytime</b> <b>oxidation</b> of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) by OH radicals is insufficient to describe the measured conversion. Quasi-Lagrangian measurements were made at two sites in the eastern Atlantic (Research Vessel and Mace Head Research Station, Ireland) as part of the Atmospheric Chemistry Studies in the Oceanic Environment (ACSOE) program. Periods of connected flow between the two sites were identified, air parcel transit times were estimated, and measurements of the main DMS oxidation products (MSA, SO 2, and nss-SO 4 2 −) were compared with model predictions to establish whether the model's chemical mechanism could account for observed changes. The main finding was that during daytime periods with maritime air masses, the model failed to predict a sufficient increase in DMS oxidation products during the estimated transit time. This was despite a tendency to overprediction of the progress of nitrogen chemistry during air mass advection, and independent checks on the model estimates of hydroxyl radical concentrations through measurements. In the light of this, the involvement of halogen species (most probably halogen oxides) or heterogeneous oxidation processes is tentatively suggested as the cause of enhanced daytime DMS oxidation in the marine boundary layer (MBL). Increasing the rate constant for the OH + DMS reaction by a factor of 3. 3 (as a crude way of simulating parallel channels of DMS oxidation) permitted model results to reproduce the measurements very much more closely...|$|E
40|$|Biogenic {{volatile}} organic compounds (BVOCs), in particular isoprene and monoter penes, dominate the oxidation capacity of the tropical boundary layer and {{play an important role}} in the formation of the radiatively and ecologically significant gas ozone. This work investigates the oxidation of isoprene and monoterpenes in the tropical boundary layer using a box model of atmospheric chemistry, which is adapted for this purpose. The model output is compared with measurements of atmospheric composition and fluxes made over the tropical rainforest during the Oxidant Particle and Photochemical Processes (OP 3) campaign in Sabah, Malaysia. The model can replicate 03 and NOx concentrations well during the daytime, but at night, the simplified mixing assumptions of the model compromise the representation of deposition of these species. A simple parametrisation for an effective night-time deposition velocity for ozone can correct this poor representation. Conversely, the ability of the model to simulate the <b>daytime</b> <b>oxidation</b> chemistry of isoprene and the concentration of the oxidant OH is severely compromised. Possible reasons for the poor model performance in this regard are discussed and tested. The most satisfactory solution to improve model fit appears to be a reduction in the rate of reaction of lsoprene/rnonoterpenes with OH, based upon the hypothesis of segregation of these species in the boundary layer. However, a novel method of calculating the segregation intensity from isoprene concentration measurements rules out this hypothesis. The reason for the model-measurement discrepancies of isoprene and OH remains unsolved. Following this detailed assessment of the strengths and limitations of the model, it is used as a predictive tool to investigate the effect of a change in BVOC emission on atmospheric chemistry. Conversion of natural rainforest to oil palm plantation substantially increases isoprene emissions, and will lead to dangerously high boundary layer ozone concentrations if future NOx concentrations are allowed to approach those in Western Europe. Meanwhile, landscape-scale circadian control can modify the magnitude and timing of isoprene emission, significantly affecting boundary layer ozone and oxidant concentrations. Further measurement studies to confirm landscape-scale circadian control of isoprene emissions are required. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} and kinetics of reactions {{important to the}} troposphere have been investigated using a high pressure, turbulent, discharge-flow technique coupled to a chemical ionization mass spectrometer. The ability to accurately model tropospheric chemistry depends on kinetic and mechanistic information {{for a wide variety}} of species. The gas-phase chemistry of the troposphere is dominated by the oxidation of trace species such as methane. One important intermediate in the oxidation of methane is the methylperoxy radical (CH 302). The kinetic rate coefficient of the reaction of CH 302 with NO was measured at 298 K and 100 Torr. The kinetics of the reaction of CH 302 with HO 2 were then examined. Aromatics are another important class of trace species found in the troposphere. The <b>daytime</b> <b>oxidation</b> of toluene is initiated by reaction with the OH radical. Rate coefficients and detailed mechanistic information for this oxidation pathway are poorly understood. The kinetics of the reaction of toluene with OH were measured at 298 K and 100 Torr. The detection of radical intermediates in this pathway was also accomplished using CIMS. Biogenic hydrocarbons also have complex oxidation mechanisms which are poorly understood. Many of these compounds are cyclic alkenes or dienes with complicated oxidation mechanisms. Propylene (C 3 H 6) is a very simple alkene and can be studied as a proxy to larger biogenic compounds. The rate coefficient for the reaction of propylene with OH was measured at 100 Torr for a range of temperatures (235 - 305 K). (cont.) The rate coefficient for the reaction of the hydroxy-propylperoxy radical (CH 3 CH(OO) CH 2 OH) with NO was also measured at 100 Torr for a range of temperatures (235 - 305 K). This technique was also extended to the study of the important reaction of NO with the [beta]- or [delta]-hydroxy-peroxy radical formed in the oxidation of isoprene (C 5 H 8 OHO 2) at 100 Torr and 298 K. by Keith Edward Broekhuizen.

40|$|We {{report in}} situ {{measurements}} of total peroxy nitrates (6 PNs) and total alkyl nitrates (6 ANs) in a forested–urban location {{at the top}} of the Kleiner Feldberg mountain in south-west Germany. The data, obtained using thermal dissociation cavity ring-down spectroscopy (TD-CRDS) in August–September 2011 (PARADE campaign) and July 2015 (NOTOMO campaign), represent the first detailed study of 6 PNs and 6 ANs over continental Europe. We find that a significant fraction of NOx (up to 75 %) is sequestered as organics nitrates at this site. Furthermore, we also show that the night-time production of alkyl nitrates by reaction of NO 3 with biogenic hydrocarbons is comparable to that from <b>daytime</b> OH-initiated <b>oxidation</b> pathways. The 6 ANs / ozone ratio obtained during PARADE was used to derive an approximate average yield of organic nitrates at noon from the OH initiated oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) of ∼ 7 % at this site in 2011, which is comparable with that obtained from an analysis of VOCs measured during the campaign. A much lower AN yield, < 2 %, was observed in 2015, which may result from sampling air with different average air mass ages and thus different degrees of breakdown of assumptions used to derive the branching ratio, but it may also reflect a seasonal change in the VOC mixture at the site...|$|R
40|$|Both primary {{biological}} {{aerosol particles}} (PBAPs) and oxidation products of biogenic {{volatile organic compounds}} (BVOCs) contribute significantly to organic aerosols (OAs) in forested regions. However, {{little is known about}} their relative importance in diurnal timescales. Here, we report biomarkers of PBAP and secondary organic aerosols (SOAs) for their diurnal variability in a temperate coniferous forest in Wakayama, Japan. Tracers of fungal spores, trehalose, arabitol and mannitol, showed significantly higher levels in nighttime than daytime (p [*]<[*] 0. 05), resulting from the nocturnal sporulation under near-saturated relative humidity. On the contrary, BVOC oxidation products showed higher levels in daytime than nighttime, indicating substantial photochemical SOA formation. Using tracer-based methods, we estimated that fungal spores account for 45  % of organic carbon (OC) in nighttime and 22  % in <b>daytime,</b> whereas BVOC <b>oxidation</b> products account for 15 and 19  %, respectively. To our knowledge, we present for the first time highly time-resolved results that fungal spores overwhelmed BVOC oxidation products in contributing to OA especially in nighttime. This study emphasizes the importance of both PBAPs and SOAs in forming forest organic aerosols...|$|R
40|$|New {{particle}} formation (NPF) {{events are}} typically observed during <b>daytime</b> when photochemical <b>oxidation</b> takes place. However, nighttime nucleation mode particles {{have been observed}} across various locations only sporadically. We present 11 years (2003 - 2013) of air ion number size distribution data from the SMEAR II station in Hyytiala, Finland, where during {{a third of the}} nights a sub- 3 nm negative (n = 1324 days) and positive (n = 1174 days) ion events took place. To investigate nocturnal clustering at sizes above the constant small ion pool, we defined cluster events (CE) as a nocturnal event with 2 - 3 nm ion concentrations reaching 70 cm- 3 between 18 : 00 and 24 : 00 local time. CE (n = 221 days) were characterized by a rapid, 10 -fold increase in the median 2 - 3 nm ion concentration from the start (similar to 10 cm(- 3)) to the event peak (similar to 100 cm(- 3)). Furthermore, small and intermediate ions during the CE, NPF events and nonevents were compared: while concentrations of 1. 5 - 2 nm ions were the highest during CE (median 235 cm(- 3)), as compared with the NPF events (96 cm(- 3)) or the daytime and nighttime nonevents (similar to 20 cm(- 3)), 3 - 7 nm ion concentrations increased notably only during NPF events (median 52 cm(- 3)). Specifically, ion concentrations during CE decreased for sizes above- 2. 4 nm (3 nm in diameter in nighttime Hyytiald...|$|R
40|$|Aerosol {{particles}} are ubiquitous {{in the atmosphere}} and induce significant impacts on human health and climate that depend on their physical and chemical properties, such as size, composition, and mixing state (chemical associations). Measurements of aerosol composition at the single-particle level are necessary to better understand these effects. Aerosol time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ATOFMS) is able to monitor the size and chemical composition of individual particles in real time. In this doctoral research, ATOFMS analysis was extended to identify new mass spectral markers and improve the potential for quantitative measurements. Development of novel instrumentation was also undertaken. Ion markers indicative of organosulfate compounds were identified in ATOFMS mass spectra collected in Atlanta, GA. In this study, the mixing state and temporal behavior of particulate organosulfate compounds were observed for the first time. Organosulfates were overwhelmingly detected in carbonaceous submicron particles and the temporal trends indicated that they likely formed by the <b>daytime</b> <b>oxidation</b> of isoprene followed by aqueous reaction with sulfate overnight. These results highlight the roles of mixing state and multi-phase reactivity on the formation of secondary organic aerosols. ATOFMS measurements of thermally-conditioned aerosol residuals obtained during the 2005 Study of Organic Aerosols in Riverside, CA were analyzed to determine the impacts of atmospheric aging on the laser desorption/ionization process. Coatings of secondary species suppressed the ionization efficiency, thereby impacting the mass spectral peak areas; however, a novel analysis method was found to correct these artifacts and produced strong agreement with collocated quantitative instrumentation. This new analysis technique was then applied to investigate the mixing-state dependence of aerosol volatility observed in Riverside. It was observed that particulate nitrate evaporated at different temperatures from different particle types (e. g., organic vs. biomass burning), which may influence the regional transport of nitrate species. ATOFMS provides important insights into size-resolved particle sources; however it heavily fragments most organic species, resulting in loss of the molecular information. Therefore, a novel chemical ionization mass spectrometer was developed to better characterize the molecular organic aerosol constituents. In particular, an ion funnel was incorporated into a home- built proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometer. Initial characterization studies and ion simulations indicated that the ion funnel can provide high-efficiency ion transfer from the ionization region to the mass spectrometer. These results demonstrate the potential for this instrument to ultimately achieve highly sensitive analyses of organic aerosol...|$|E
40|$|Chemical {{modelling}} {{studies have}} been conducted over north-western Europe in summer conditions, showing that night-time dinitrogen pentoxide (N 2 O 5) heterogeneous reactive uptake is important regionally in modulating particulate nitrate and has a~modest influence on oxidative chemistry. Results from Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model simulations, run with a detailed volatile organic compound (VOC) gas-phase chemistry scheme and the Model for Simulating Aerosol Interactions and Chemistry (MOSAIC) sectional aerosol scheme, were compared with a series of airborne gas and particulate measurements made over the UK in July 2010. Modelled mixing ratios of key gas-phase species were reasonably accurate (correlations with measurements of 0. 7 – 0. 9 for NO 2 and O 3). However modelled loadings of particulate species were less accurate (correlation with measurements for particulate sulfate and ammonium were between 0. 0 and 0. 6). Sulfate mass loadings were particularly low (modelled means of 0. 5 – 0. 7 μg kg − 1 air, compared with measurements of 1. 0 – 1. 5 μg kg − 1 air). Two flights from the campaign were used as test cases – one with low relative humidity (RH) (60 – 70 %), the other with high RH (80 – 90 %). N 2 O 5 heterogeneous chemistry was found to not be important in the low-RH test case; but in the high-RH test case it had a strong effect and significantly improved the agreement between modelled and measured NO 3 and N 2 O 5. When the model failed to capture atmospheric RH correctly, the modelled NO 3 and N 2 O 5 mixing ratios for these flights differed significantly from the measurements. This demonstrates that, for regional modelling which involves heterogeneous processes, it is essential to capture the ambient temperature and water vapour profiles. The night-time NO 3 oxidation of VOCs across the whole region was found to be 100 – 300 times slower than the <b>daytime</b> OH <b>oxidation</b> of these compounds. The difference in contribution was less for alkenes (× 80) and comparable for dimethylsulfide (DMS). However the suppression of NO 3 mixing ratios across the domain by N 2 O 5 heterogeneous chemistry has only a very slight, negative, influence on this oxidative capacity. The influence on regional particulate nitrate mass loadings is stronger. Night-time N 2 O 5 heterogeneous chemistry maintains the production of particulate nitrate within polluted regions: when this process is taken into consideration, the daytime peak (for the 95 th percentile) of PM 10 nitrate mass loadings remains around 5. 6 μg kg − 1 air, but the night-time minimum increases from 3. 5 to 4. 6 μg kg − 1 air. The sustaining of higher particulate mass loadings through the night by this process improves model skill at matching measured aerosol nitrate diurnal cycles and will negatively impact on regional air quality, requiring this process to be included in regional models...|$|R
40|$|Gas-phase {{biogenic}} {{volatile organic}} compounds (BVOCs) are oxidized in the troposphere to produce secondary pollutants such as ozone (O 3), organic nitrates (RONO 2), and secondary organic aerosol (SOA). Two coupled zero-dimensional models {{have been used to}} investigate differences in oxidation and SOA production from isoprene and α -pinene, especially with respect to the nitrate radical (NO 3), above and below a forest canopy in rural Michigan. In both modeled environments (above and below the canopy), NO 3 mixing ratios are relatively small (<  0. 5  pptv); however, daytime (08 : 00 – 20 : 00  LT) mixing ratios below the canopy are 2 to 3 times larger than those above. As a result of this difference, NO 3 contributes 12  % of total <b>daytime</b> α -pinene <b>oxidation</b> below the canopy while only contributing 4  % above. Increasing background pollutant levels to simulate a more polluted suburban or peri-urban forest environment increases the average contribution of NO 3 to daytime below-canopy α -pinene oxidation to 32  %. Gas-phase RONO 2 produced through NO 3 oxidation undergoes net transport upward from the below-canopy environment during the day, and this transport contributes up to 30  % of total NO 3 -derived RONO 2 production above the canopy in the morning (∼[*] 07 : 00). Modeled SOA mass loadings above and below the canopy ultimately differ by less than 0. 5  µg m − 3, and extremely low-volatility organic compounds dominate SOA composition. Lower temperatures below the canopy cause increased partitioning of semi-volatile gas-phase products to the particle phase and up to 35  % larger SOA mass loadings of these products relative to above the canopy in the model. Including transport between above- and below-canopy environments increases above-canopy NO 3 -derived α -pinene RONO 2 SOA mass by as much as 45  %, suggesting that below-canopy chemical processes substantially influence above-canopy SOA mass loadings, especially with regard to monoterpene-derived RONO 2...|$|R
40|$|Aerosol samples (TSP, n = 58) were {{collected}} on day- and night-time basis at Mangshan {{in the north of}} Beijing, China in autumn 2007 to better understand the status of air quality and the influence of urban pollutants in the northern vicinity of Beijing. The samples were analyzed for aerosol mass, total carbon (TC), low molecular weight α, ω-dicarboxylic acids (C 2 -C 12), ketoacids (ωC 2 -ωC 9, pyruvic acid), α-dicarbonyls (glyoxal and methylglyoxal), as well as aromatic (phthalic, iso- and tere-phthalic) diacids. Aerosol mass and TC concentrations are higher in daytime than in nighttime. TC/aerosol mass ratios in this study are lower than those reported in megacities in East Asia, but higher than those reported in marine aerosols. Molecular distributions of diacids demonstrated that oxalic (C 2) acid was the most abundant species, comprising 38 – 77 % of total diacids, followed by succinic (C 4) and malonic (C 3) acids. For most compounds, the concentrations were higher in daytime than nighttime, indicating that diacids are produced in <b>daytime</b> by photochemical <b>oxidation</b> of organic precursors emitted from anthropogenic sources in Beijing during the transport to Mangshan area by the northward wind. However, we found that C 2 concentrations are higher in nighttime than in daytime. A positive correlation of C 2 to glyoxylic acid (ωC 2) was obtained at night when relative humidity increased up to 100 %, suggesting that aqueous phase production of C 2 occurs in nighttime via the oxidation of ωC 2. Depletion of C 2 by photolysis of Fe-oxalato complexes might be another reason for the lower concentrations of C 2 in daytime samples. High phthalic acid/C 4 ratios in the aerosol samples suggest that automobile combustion and coal burning products are important sources, which are subjected to photochemical oxidation during the atmospheric transport of urban aerosols from Beijing. In contrast, higher concentrations of methylglyoxal in nighttime than daytime may suggest that isoprene emitted from the northern forest area is oxidized in daytime and then transported to the sampling area at night by northerly winds. This study demonstrates that secondary organic aerosols are significantly produced and aged in the vicinity of Beijing during atmospheric transport...|$|R
