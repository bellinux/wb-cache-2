5|$|There were 21deaths in New England, {{including}} eight drownings in Maine. Throughout the United States, {{damage was}} estimated at $42,815,000. Damage was less from Edna than from Carol, primarily due to its strongest winds not occurring {{at the time of}} highest tides, and its track <b>farther</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east. Throughout New England, 260,000people lost power, most of whom in Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|Except for chemicals, {{all of the}} old {{industries}} have disappeared {{and there has been}} diversification, in particular because of the close links to the motorway system and the development of warehousing and distribution centres. A new town was built to the east of the existing town in the 1960s and 1970s, and areas of private housing have been established <b>farther</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east; this has resulted in the population more than doubling from around 26,000 to its present level of 70,000.|$|E
5|$|In Buckingham Township, PA 263 {{becomes a}} four-lane {{undivided}} road passes {{a mix of}} farmland and homes as {{it comes to the}} community of Furlong. Here, the road intersects Edison Furlong Road/Forest Grove Road and forms the border between Doylestown Township to the west and Buckingham Township to the east. At the intersection with the eastern terminus of PA 313 (Swamp Road), the route fully enters Buckingham Township again and turns northeast past a mix of farms and woods with some residences. <b>Farther</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northeast, the route reaches the community of Buckingham and crosses PA 413 (Durham Road).|$|E

5|$|Near {{the point}} of its first landfall, few {{structures}} were destroyed and ocean overwash across the barrier island was limited, though {{the extent of the}} damage far exceeded that of Hurricane Charley. Wind damage to citrus groves led to a near total loss near the coast of east-central Florida between West Palm Beach and Melbourne, with lesser damage <b>farther</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west across the Kissimmee River basin. Between Hurricane Charley and Frances, citrus losses totaled $2billion (2004 dollars). Significant tree damage was reported within golf courses along the Treasure Coast, with an average of 300-500 trees experiencing damage per course.|$|E
5|$|One {{consequence}} of this fact appears in the bit-reversed ordering of integer data types used by some computer algorithms, such as the Cooley–Tukey fast Fourier transform. This ordering has the property that the <b>farther</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left the first 1 occurs in a number's binary expansion, or the more times it is divisible by 2, the sooner it appears. Zero's bit reversal is still zero; it can be divided by 2 any number of times, and its binary expansion does not contain any 1s, so it always comes first.|$|E
5|$|Route 57 {{begins at}} an {{interchange}} with US22 in Lopatcong Township, {{where the only}} movements possible here between the two highways are westbound Route 57 to westbound US22 and vice versa. The road heads to the east on the Morris and Essex Turnpike, a two-lane undivided road. The route heads through a mix of businesses and farm fields, with Norfolk Southern's Washington Secondary rail line paralleling {{the road to the}} south.

5|$|Storms that {{approach}} the southwestern United States, {{and by extension}} Arizona, generally form closer to the Mexican shoreline than average, making them more likely to recurve northwards {{under the influence of}} an approaching trough. These troughs tend to extend <b>farther</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south during {{the latter part of the}} Pacific hurricane season, in the period between late August and early October. These pronounced troughs thus produce a synoptic-scale flow that is conducive to steering hurricanes towards the southwestern United States.|$|E
5|$|The American {{plan was}} that Putnam would direct the {{defenses}} from Brooklyn Heights, while Sullivan and Stirling and their {{troops would be}} stationed on the Guan Heights. The Guan (hills) were up to 150 feet high and blocked the most direct route to Brooklyn Heights. Washington believed that, by stationing men on the heights, heavy casualties could be inflicted on the British before the troops fell {{back to the main}} defenses at Brooklyn Heights. There were three main passes through the heights; the Gowanus Road farthest to the west, the Flatbush Road slightly <b>farther</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east, {{in the center of the}} American line where it was expected that the British would attack, and the Bedford Road farthest to the east. Stirling was responsible for defending the Gowanus Road with 500 men, and Sullivan was to defend the Flatbush and Bedford roads where there were 1,000 and 800 men respectively. Six-thousand troops were to remain behind at Brooklyn Heights. There was one lesser-known pass through the heights <b>farther</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east called the Jamaica Pass, which was defended by just five militia officers on horses.|$|E
5|$|After the battle, Tsar Alexander I laid all {{the blame}} on M. I. Kutuzov, Commander-in-chief of the Allied Army. However, {{it is clear that}} Kutuzov's plan was to retreat <b>farther</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rear where the Allied Army had a sharp {{advantage}} in logistics. Had the Allied Army retreated further, they might have been reinforced by Archduke Charles's troops from Italy, and the Prussians might have joined the coalition against Napoleon. A French army {{at the end of her}} supply lines, in a place which had no food supplies, might have faced a very different ending from the one they achieved at the real battle of Austerlitz. This essentially was Kutuzov's successful strategy in 1812, after the Battle of Borodino.|$|E

5|$|<b>Farther</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west, {{a complex}} island arc {{assemblage}} formed above a subduction zone. To the east, in western Colorado, a mountain range similar to today's Himalayas called the Uncompahgre Mountains bordered the Utah lowland. The interfingering of the Kaibab with the White Rim Sandstone, now exposed in Capitol Reef National Park area, {{to the east}} suggests that the marine facies of the Kaibab migrated eastward {{in response to a}} relative sea-level rise, or transgression (the White Rim is not exposed in the Zion area). The sea moved back and forth across Utah, but by the Middle Permian, the sea had withdrawn and the Kaibab Limestone was exposed to erosion, creating karst topography and channels reaching 30m (100ft) in depth.|$|E
5|$|Forming at 31° N, {{the storm}} formed farther north {{than any other}} Pacific {{tropical}} cyclone at the time, though, in 2000, Tropical Storm Wene formed <b>farther</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north. The cyclone marked the first known occurrence of a mid-Pacific upper tropospheric low developing into a tropical cyclone, though Tropical Storm Fausto in 2002 redeveloped in a similar occurrence to the hurricane. The cyclone attained hurricane status at 40° N, a record for a Pacific hurricane. Only Tropical Storm Dot in 1970, Hurricane John in 1994, Tropical Depression Guillermo in 1997, and Tropical Storm Wene in 2000 were tropical cyclones north of the latitude, of which only John was a hurricane; none maintained tropical cyclone status further north than the cyclone.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, Route 10 was {{designated}} to run along a new, never-built alignment <b>farther</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north, running through Belleville, Bloomfield, Glen Ridge, Montclair, West Orange, {{and along the}} Livingston/Roseland border, roughly along much of the routing of present-day CR 611 (Eagle Rock Avenue), and following its current alignment through Morris County to Ledgewood. A spur of the route was also planned in 1952 to run from Montclair south to Orange. A year later, in the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 10 was defined onto its current alignment, with its eastern terminus moved to Prospect Avenue in West Orange. In 1998, the Ledgewood Circle at the western terminus of the route was replaced with a signalized T-intersection. In the mid-2000s, an $11.5 million project was undertaken to improve safety on the portion of Route 10 in Hanover and East Hanover Townships by widening existing lanes and adding turning lanes to the road.|$|E

5|$|On {{the line}} <b>farther</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south, North Korean T-34 tank fire hit E Company at midnight. First Lieutenant Charles Ellis, the company commander, {{attempted}} to rally his men but they crumbled under fire, retreating without orders. During the night everyone in E Company ran off the hill except Ellis and 11 men. Several E Company men fled through a mine field they {{had set up}} and were killed. North Korean fire pinned Ellis' men down after dawn on September 1. When {{three or four of}} the group tried to escape, North Korean machine gun fire killed them. Ellis and the remaining men stayed in their foxholes on the hill for two days, repelling several attacks in that time. Ellis was then able to withdraw south, up the mountain to the 3rd Battalion's position. In his withdrawal, Ellis, discovering {{a man who had been}} injured earlier in a mine explosion, entered the mine field to rescue him.|$|E
5|$|Route 10 was {{designated}} in 1927 {{to run from}} Jersey City to Dover, following the former Newark and Mount Pleasant Turnpike west of Newark. The route continued east from its present-day routing on current CR 577, Park Avenue, CR 508, and Route 7 to end at US 1/9 at the Tonnele Circle. An alignment of Route 10 <b>farther</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north of its current alignment in Essex County was proposed in 1952; however, it was never constructed with the route being designated to its present alignment a year later. Since 1953, Route 10 has seen improvements that eliminated the Ledgewood Circle at the western terminus in 1998 and improved safety along {{the portion of the}} route in Hanover and East Hanover Townships in the mid-2000s.|$|E
5|$|The Allies {{marched in}} normal order in two main columns, {{the first line}} on the left, the second line on the right; <b>farther</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right, though, marched a column {{consisting}} of the foot reserve, and {{between the first and}} second lines trundled the reserve artillery. The right wing cavalry advanced at the head and the left wing cavalry at the tail of the two main columns. Noting some Prussian movement, Soubise ordered a wheeling pivot to the east, a complicated maneuver under parade-ground conditions, and difficult in the field, with troops unfamiliar with each other, on uneven terrain. At first, the columns retained regulation distance, wheeling eastward toward Zeuchfeld, but then part of the reserve infantry moved between the two main columns, hampering the movements of the reserve artillery. In addition, the troops on the outer flank of the wheel found themselves unable to keep up with the overly rapid movement of the inner pivot.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Schellenberg {{was part}} of the Grand Alliance's {{campaign}} of 1704 to prevent the Franco-Bavarian army from threatening Vienna, the capital of Habsburg Austria. The campaign began in earnest on 19 May when the Duke of Marlborough began his 250-mile (400km) march from Bedburg near Cologne towards the Elector of Bavaria's and Marshal Marsin's Franco-Bavarian army on the Danube. Marlborough had initially deceived the French commanders– Marshal Villeroi in the Spanish Netherlands and Marshal Tallard along the Rhine– into thinking his target was Alsace or the Moselle <b>farther</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north. However, when the Elector was notified on 5 June of Marlborough's march from the Low Countries, he had correctly predicted that it was his principality of Bavaria that was the Allies' real target.|$|E
5|$|The Mendocino Fault is seismically active with mostly {{small and}} {{moderate}} earthquakes, but the largest event that was unequivocally {{associated with the}} fault was the M6.9 earthquake on September 1, 1994, at 125.8 W longitude. Aftershocks of that event with corresponding dextral strike-slip focal mechanisms occurred <b>farther</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east {{and close to the}} Mendocino Triple Junction. Another large event (7.3–7.6) occurred on January 31, 1922 (with an aftershock of M7+ the next day) but the sources of these shocks could not be determined with any precision as the first seismographs did not arrive in the area until 1932. Due to their offshore epicenters all of these events caused little damage though were felt across a broad area. Previous Gorda plate events include the July 13 and August 17, 1991, shocks of 6.8 and 7.1 and the M7.3 event on November 10, 1980, west of Arcata.|$|E
