500|$|Directed by both Usher {{and music}} video {{director}} Chris Robinson, [...] "My Boo" [...] clip was filmed in New York City. The storyline {{of the video}} {{is a reflection of}} the song's lyrics. The footage starts with Usher in a living room watching a video for [...] "Bad Girl", a song from Confessions. The [...] "Bad Girl" [...] intro features Usher singing the song in a club setting while admiring a scantily-dressed woman. He turns the set off and slumps <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> before laying on it with his foot propped up. After a moment of silent, nostalgic reflection, he begins to sing the intro of [...] "My Boo". The video then shows him and Alicia Keys in their separate quarters, preparing to head out, while singing their part of the song. Usher eventually steps out on streets of New York; likewise, Keys is out in her car. She leaves the car and walks down the street, and the couple meet up in the middle of Times Square, cuddling each other and on the brink of kissing. The music video debuted on MTV's Total Request Live at number nine on September 16, 2004. It remained on the countdown for twenty-seven days, becoming the only Confession video to chart.|$|E
500|$|Ray drags {{the case}} {{to the top of the}} stairs and meets Eddie. Gerald lays Sabrina <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa,</b> places a cushion over her face and shoots her. Gerald turns off the music as the {{doorbell}} is heard. Answering the door, Gerald sees a man (Novak) who holds up a sign reading [...] "Hello, my name is Paul. I am deaf & dumb." [...] The reverse of the sign reads [...] "Do you need any cleaning products today?" [...] Gerald heads inside and hides Sabrina's body as Paul waits. Gerald splashes his soup onto the blood and invites Paul to clean it. Ray runs down the stairs and meets Paul; he proceeds to buy rope before returning upstairs. Paul continues to clean, but sees the bullethole in the cushion, and then the suitcase being lowered outside the window. Gerald heads outside to investigate, but Eddie and Ray drop the case on his head. The burglars run past Paul and look out to see the canvas in the pool, before both being shot by Paul. Paul rings someone and says [...] "Hello, it's me. Yeah, it's done." [...] He looks to the fake painting, and says [...] "I've got it right here. Yeah, it's fine. Not a peep out of anyone." [...] He takes down the painting and walks out, as the real canvas is seen sinking in the pool.|$|E
2500|$|The {{difficulty}} {{of this argument}} for some compatibilists {{lies in the fact}} that it entails the impossibility that one could have chosen other than one has. For example, if Jane is a compatibilist and she has just sat <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa,</b> then she is committed to the claim that she could have remained standing, if she had so desired. But it follows from the consequence argument that, if Jane had remained standing, she would have either generated a contradiction, violated the laws of nature or changed the past. Hence, compatibilists are committed to the existence of [...] "incredible abilities", according to Ginet and van Inwagen. One response to this argument is that it equivocates on the notions of abilities and necessities, or that the free will evoked to make any given choice is really an illusion and the choice had been made all along, oblivious to its [...] "decider". David Lewis suggests that compatibilists are only committed to the ability to do something otherwise if different circumstances had actually obtained in the past.|$|E

60|$|Mrs. Micawber was amazed, {{but very}} glad to see me. I was {{very glad to}} see her too, and, after an affectionate {{greeting}} on both sides, sat <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> small <b>sofa</b> near her.|$|R

60|$|George {{rose and}} offered me the round arm-chair. It {{was the highest}} honour he could do me. He asked me what I would drink.

6000|$|... [CHLOE'S passion fades out {{as quickly}} as it blazed up. She [...] sinks <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa,</b> shudders, looks here and there, and [...] then for a moment up at him.] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{send her}} here too, an' look alive, lass." [...] So saying, Captain Dunning sat <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa,</b> {{and began to}} beat the floor with his right foot {{somewhat}} impatiently.|$|E
