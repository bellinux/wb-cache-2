500|$|The Dada series makes ample use of contrast, ellipses, ridiculous {{imagery and}} {{nonsensical}} verdicts. Tzara {{was aware that}} the public could {{find it difficult to}} <b>follow</b> <b>his</b> <b>intentions,</b> and, in a piece titled Le géant blanc lépreux du paysage ("The White Leprous Giant in the Landscape") even alluded to the [...] "skinny, idiotic, dirty" [...] reader who [...] "does not understand my poetry." [...] He called some of his own poems lampisteries, from a French word designating storage areas for light fixtures. The Lettrist poet Isidore Isou included such pieces in a succession of experiments inaugurated by Charles Baudelaire with the [...] "destruction of the anecdote for the form of the poem", a process which, with Tzara, became [...] "destruction of the word for nothing". According to American literary historian Mary Ann Caws, Tzara's poems may be seen as having an [...] "internal order", and read as [...] "a simple spectacle, as creation complete in itself and completely obvious." ...|$|E

60|$|Major Walsham went {{no more to}} the wars, nor did he <b>follow</b> <b>his</b> {{original}} <b>intention</b> {{of entering}} the medical profession. Indeed, there was no occasion {{for him to do}} either. For Aggie insisted on his leaving the army; and she had a very strong voice in the matter. James had not long been home before he and the young lady came to an understanding. Before speaking to her, James had consulted his old friend.|$|R
5000|$|Messersmith and McNally {{won their}} case before {{arbitrator}} Peter Seitz, {{who was fired}} by the owners the day afterward. McNally <b>followed</b> through on <b>his</b> <b>intention</b> to retire but Messersmith signed a three-year, $1 million deal with the Atlanta Braves. Among other things, then-Braves owner Ted Turner suggested the nickname [...] "Channel" [...] for Messersmith and jersey number 17, {{in order to promote}} the television station that aired Braves games. Major League Baseball quickly nixed the idea.|$|R

Shortly after his father's death {{he went to the}} University of Leipzig to study law, but soon dropped out of the course and visited Dresden and Berlin before returning to London in the summer of 1796. Boswell was a tall and muscular man who was thought by his sister to have exceeded his expectations. Having inherited land from his father, he took care of his inheritance and by 1801 the rents paid annually to him were more than his father had received. Boswell had an active interest in agriculture and was keen on country sports.|$|R
50|$|In {{a similar}} vein, Nelson Rockefeller {{was said to}} be a {{caretaker}} Vice President of the United States (1974 - 1977). He was nominated for the office by President Gerald Ford, who had succeeded the resigned President Richard Nixon. Rockefeller made it apparent that he had no further presidential ambitions of his own (unlike many Vice Presidents), despite having run for the office three times in the past, and {{he had no intention of}} even running for a full term in the vice presidential office. He <b>followed</b> through on <b>his</b> <b>intention</b> when Ford's running mate in the 1976 presidential election was Senator Bob Dole.|$|R
5000|$|For 25 years Jens Bjørneboe was {{a center}} of unrest in Norwegian {{cultural}} life: Passionately concerned with contemporary problems in nearly all their aspects, controversial and with the courage to be so, with a conscious will to carry things to extremes. He {{was not to be}} pigeonholed. He dropped in on many philosophical and political movements, but couldn't settle down in any of them. He was a wanderer, always traveling on in search of what was for him the truth—and he was a free man, in that he always ruthlessly <b>followed</b> <b>his</b> innermost <b>intentions.</b> Perhaps he could say, like Søren Kierkegaard, that [...] "subjectivity is truth," [...] for he knew no other guide than his personal conviction and his own impulses—but he related not merely to himself; his deepest concern was society and the person in society. His subjective grasp always involved the totality.|$|R
40|$|Digitized {{microfilm}} {{of correspondence}} and papers from the Andrew Dickson White collection. White {{and his wife}} traveled in Europe through the summer and early fall, {{and there were many}} letters arranging meetings with Burr, the Evanses, and Fiske as well as family letters from Ithaca and Syracuse. The relations between capital and labor were commented upon by Sage on June 20, and in a very different manner on the 28 th by Gardiner Greene Hubbard. Ernest Huffcut wrote on August 10 of the difficulty White would face in accepting the Republican nomination for congressman from Democratic Governor Hill's own district. In September Evans wrote, I suppose there is no legislative body in the whole world which contains so many men incapable of forming sound judgments. White wrote on October 29 of Roosevelt's pluck and spirit, and said that even losing he would gain a triumph. White himself was offered an appointment to the Interstate Commerce Commission by President Cleveland, but declined. On his return to Ithaca White did not immediately take an active part in Cornell affairs. President Adams turned over to him many of Architect Henry Van Brunt's letters concerning plans for the library, but he was not named by the trustees to fill a vacancy in the board at their January meeting. That White <b>followed</b> <b>his</b> <b>intention</b> of turning <b>his</b> hand to writing is attested to by the number of letters on the reel from editors and publishers. Some prominent names that appear are Curtis Guild, Henry and Fanny Garrison Villard, and Charles Waldstein. The Syracuse Water Company was being threatened by the formation of a new company, and White, a stockholder, was kept informed of developments by the company president, D. H. Bruce...|$|R
