25|$|The United States {{immigration}} {{system provides}} channels for legal, permanent economic immigration, especially for high-skilled workers. For low-skilled workers, temporary or seasonal legal immigration {{is easier to}} acquire. The United States immigration system rests on three pillars: family reunification, provision of scarce labor (as in agricultural and specific <b>high-skilled</b> <b>worker</b> sectors), and protecting American workers from competition with foreign workers. The current system sets an overall limit of 675,000 permanent immigrants each year; this limit {{does not apply to}} spouses, unmarried minor children or parents of U.S. citizens. Outside of this number for permanent immigrants, 480,000 visas are allotted for those under the family-preference rules and 140,000 are allocated for employment-related preferences. The current system and low number of visas available make it difficult for low-skilled workers to legally and permanently enter the country to work, so illegal entry becomes the way immigrants respond to the lure of jobs with higher wages than what {{they would be able to}} find in their current country.|$|E

Married and widowed employees, on the other hand, are associated with a lower probability of becoming unemployed. Note that the coefficient for employment in an ICT-intensive industry or in a GAV industry is not significantly different from zero.

So they will prefer a shorter retirement delay. However, the <b>high-skilled</b> <b>workers</b> are in a different case. As their human capital will accumulate and ramp up, the <b>high-skilled</b> <b>workers</b> will feel increasingly fulfilled with the payment and their jobs.

Whereas trade does not affect the firm-internal assignment of workers to tasks, it reduces the range of tasks produced by <b>high-skilled</b> <b>workers</b> within firms and thereby lowers firm-level productivity, if low-skilled wages are fixed by a minimum wage.

The labor market is dual featuring low-skilled and <b>high-skilled</b> <b>workers</b> and simple and complex jobs. Simple jobs pay a minimum wage, while wages in the complex jobs are determined by Nash bargaining. Opportunities for low-skilled workers are limited to simple jobs; while high-skilled unemployed can apply for both types of jobs, and thereby can accept to be downgraded. We analyze the outcomes of simple job subsidy policies assuming that government budget is balanced thr ough taxes on occupied workers. We ﬁ rst give conditi ons for the existence and uniqueness of a steady-state equilibrium and we then analyze the effects of different ﬁscal instruments. We show that in this set-up, increasing simple job sub sidies does not necessarily reduce low-skilled unemployment or unemployment spells. By introducing heterogeneous skills and possible down-grading of the <b>high-skilled</b> <b>workers,</b> we show that the effectiveness of such policies in reducing the classical unemployment is decreasing.

40|$|My thesis {{explores the}} {{following}} question: how workers of different skill are allocated across jobs and unemployment over the business cycle. I {{am interested in}} understanding the "over-qualification" of workers that occurs during periods of high unemployment, as increased congestion {{in the labor market}} hinders workers from finding a suitable match. I focus on the skill mismatch that takes the form of <b>high-skilled</b> <b>workers</b> transitorily accepting low-skill jobs, thereby influencing the labor market prospects of low-skilled workers. In the first chapter, I develop a business cycle matching model with heterogeneous workers and jobs, which helps understand the role of over-qualification on labor productivity and across-skill unemployment dynamics. I capture the across-skill search externalities and spillover effects that arise when low- and <b>high-skilled</b> <b>workers</b> compete for low-skill jobs, by relaxing the common assumption that all workers qualify for any type of vacancy. I show that the skill mix of vacancies changes over the cycle, thus altering the allocation of workers of different skill across jobs and unemployment. In addition, my model explains observed differences in labor market outcomes of different skill groups, including the higher sensitivity of low-skilled unemployment to changes in economic activity. In the second chapter, I test the empirical relevance of over-qualification. I ask whether the risk of unemployment induces <b>high-skilled</b> <b>workers</b> to accept transitorily low-skill jobs until a better job comes along. To this end, I study the mismatch rates and job level dynamics of <b>high-skilled</b> <b>workers.</b> Unlike existing studies that only examine how the business cycle affects job level probabilities, I adopt dynamic panel data estimation methods, in which the worker's lagged state (i. e., whether unemployed or mismatched) enters the model as an explanatory variable. I find evidence suggestive of the existence of over-qualification. The mismatch rates of higher educational groups are higher and exhibit more cyclical variation. Moreover, I find that <b>high-skilled</b> <b>workers</b> are more likely to move into lower job levels when they are unemployed and the unemployment rate is high. In addition, my results point to the existence of an upgrading in the job levels of mismatched <b>high-skilled</b> <b>workers</b> when the unemployment rate is low...|$|R

30|$|We {{demonstrate}} that the wage gap between young and experienced workers has increased over time, although the absolute cohort size of young workers has declined and the share of <b>high-skilled</b> young <b>workers</b> has increased. In contrast to the findings for the U.S., this is associated with a slight decline in the chances of <b>high-skilled</b> <b>workers</b> to obtaining analytical jobs only. At the same time, however, we have found a clear decrease in the opportunity of young workers to work in top-paying jobs. Although the share of young workers in top-paying occupations has overall risen (particularly during the 1990 s), the relative chances of obtaining a top-paying occupation have fallen slightly within the groups of high-skilled labor market entrants. Besides the reduced probability of getting a top-paying job, wage growth has declined substantially, in particular {{for the two groups}} of <b>high-skilled</b> <b>workers</b> considered and for medium-skilled workers. Nevertheless, with consideration of the long-run picture our empirical evidence does not speak for a distinct reversal in wage expectations of <b>high-skilled</b> <b>workers.</b> Although wage growth for cohorts entering the labor market after 2000 has been smaller than for cohorts entering in the 1990 s, it recaptured its magnitude from around the year 1990.

30|$|To summarize, the {{empirical}} figures {{indicate that the}} share of <b>high-skilled</b> <b>workers</b> performing non-routine analytical jobs has remained rather constant for long periods, {{but there is some}} heterogeneity between high-uni-skilled and high-fh-skilled employees. The increase of <b>high-skilled</b> <b>workers</b> in routine cognitive jobs may hint at an academization of these jobs. For the high-uni-skilled, the share of routine cognitive tasks has increased continuously at the expense of non-routine interactive tasks, whereas the remaining task shares have remained on rather constant levels over time. For the high-fh-skilled, the share of routine cognitive tasks has increased similarly at the expense of two groups: on the one hand, the shares of non-routine analytical tasks before 1985 and after 2003 have decreased, and on the other hand, non-routine interactive tasks had decreased between 1987 and 1992. Overall, besides these tendencies, a clear cascading pattern – as described in Beaudry et al. (2014) – cannot be confirmed for the two groups of <b>high-skilled</b> <b>workers</b> in Germany since the pattern of the task composition is too persistent to provide unambiguous indications for declining labor market chances of the young.|$|R
