25|$|Romney {{generally}} opposes federal {{financial aid}} {{for college and}} other post-secondary education. While campaigning for the presidency in 2012, he argued that students should not expect government handouts to fund their education. In response to {{a high school senior}} who had asked what kind of college tuition assistance Romney would seek to provide as president, Romney replied, “I know that it would be popular for me {{to stand up and say}} I’m <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> government money to make sure you pay for your college. But I’m not going to promise that. What I’m going to tell you is shop around, get a good price.... Don’t take on too much debt, and don’t expect the government to forgive the debt that you take on. Recognize that you’re going to have to pay it back.” He similarly told a law student who had asked what kind of federal assistance might be available in a Romney presidency for graduate students struggling to repay education loans: “I wish I could tell you that there’s a place to find really cheap money or free money and we could pay for everyone’s education. That’s just not going to happen.” He encouraged young people to be entrepreneurially-minded and to take risks, even to consider borrowing money from their parents if necessary to further their careers.|$|E

Bevin also called {{for the elimination of}} many of Kentucky's $10 billion in [...] "tax expenditures", which he called [...] "Frankfort-speak for loopholes". Asked to specify which expenditures he would eliminate, Bevin said, [...] "I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> specifics at this point in time. There are many of these loopholes that frankly are not conducive to developing the economy. There are some that make sense, and those will continue. ...e have already identified what many of them will be. But at this point, we're {{going to have to look}} at them in totality.

500|$|Walter Yetnikoff, the {{president}} of Jackson's record company CBS Records, approached MTV about playing the [...] "Billie Jean" [...] video, which MTV had not ever played in spite of Jackson's success as a musical artist. Yetnikoff became enraged when MTV refused to play the video, and he threatened {{to go public with}} MTV's stance on racial discrimination. [...] "I said to MTV, 'I'm pulling everything we have off the air, all our product. I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> any more videos. And I'm going to go public and fucking tell them about the fact you don't want to play music by a black guy.'" [...] MTV relented and played the [...] "Billie Jean" [...] video in heavy rotation. After the video was aired, Thriller went on to sell an additional 10 million copies. The short film was inducted into the Music Video Producers Hall of Fame in 1992. In a 2005 poll of 31 pop stars, video directors, agents, and journalists conducted by telecommunications company 3, the music video was ranked fifth in their [...] "Top 20 Music Videos Ever". The video was also ranked as the 35th greatest music video in a list compiled by MTV and TV Guide at the millennium.|$|E
500|$|De Fratus is {{a devout}} Roman Catholic who, {{though he was}} raised in a large Catholic family, {{struggled}} with his faith after an injury early in his career, but ultimately determined the injury was a gift from God to help him better understand his faith: [...] "I really feel that the setback was God telling me, ‘Hey you are not done. [...] You are not done yet figuring out what you need to figure out, and I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> a little more time.’ [...] There is a big reason why that injury happened and I feel that I used it as best as I could have." [...] He noted {{that he would like to}} take classes at a seminary to help proselytize to others. Early in his professional career, he struggled to find fellow Catholics, and noted that most of his teammates were either Protestants or not religious. Moreover, in many small towns that house minor league teams, there are no Catholic churches, so De Fratus found it easy to slide away from leading a Catholic lifestyle. However, upon realizing that there is more to life than material success, he discovered a need for God, and has thus developed his faith. Aside from his faith, he enjoys writing and recording music, and playing the guitar. He has two brothers, the older of whom, Steve, played in the minor leagues, and the younger of whom, Chris, caught a foul ball during De Fratus's major league debut.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} {{were looking}} for someone who had a [...] "Paris Hilton quality" [...] to play Shannon, but she could not just be shallow, as the storyline would require more than that. A lot of women auditioned before the producers finally settled on Maggie Grace. She was written to be a bitch in the first season as the producers needed a character they could use to create opposition and conflict. The producers thought it would be interesting for there to be more to Shannon and Boone's relationship than just Boone's possessive brotherly interest. They {{came up with the idea}} for them to be unrelated stepsiblings, who have a romantic encounter, which became the twist for their backstory. When Boone is killed at the end of season one, it forces Shannon into a more adult existence on the Island. Grace noted Boone is [...] "the only person that ever really knew and loved Shannon, in spite of herself. Of course, losing him, especially with so much left unsaid and unresolved, will change her irrevocably." [...] This freed her up to develop her relationship with Sayid. Naveen Andrews, who plays Sayid, came up with the idea for Shannon and Sayid relationship. He thought, [...] "What would really shock Middle-America? What if Sayid was to have a relationship with a woman that looked like Miss America? The most unlikely pairing… to come completely from left field." [...] This pairing made Shannon [...] "less flighty... more of a person to be reckoned with." [...] According to Lost producer Carlton Cuse, [...] "The relationships [...] expect on the show are not necessarily the ones that we [...] necessarily are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you,</b> but we want to try to find ways in which characters that you don't expect to kind of connect to one another to connect in ways that are kind of surprising." ...|$|E

2500|$|Composer Hans Zimmer, {{who scored}} Nolan's Batman film trilogy and Inception, also scored Interstellar. Zimmer and Nolan strived {{to develop a}} unique sound for Interstellar. Zimmer said: [...] "The textures, the music, and the sounds, and the thing we sort of created has sort of seeped into other people's movies a bit, so it's time to reinvent. The endless string (ostinatos) need to go by the wayside, the big drums are {{probably}} in the bin." [...] Zimmer also said that Nolan did not provide him a script or any plot details for writing music for the film and instead gave the composer [...] "one page of text" [...] that [...] "had {{more to do with}} [...] story than the plot of the movie".

2500|$|Three members (Garred, Pritchard and Harris) of The Kooks all met as {{students}} at the BRIT School in Croydon, all three moving further south to join BIMM (where they met Rafferty who was from Brighton) in 2002.

Speaking to MTV Garred said, [...] "we had a vision on how we wanted the band to look and stuff—so we bought some clothes and these hats, it was fun." [...] Sharing a love of The Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, The Police, and David Bowie, Pritchard got Harris and Rafferty involved {{under the guise of}} a school music project. Pritchard himself said [...] "We got together just on a whim, really." [...] With a strong demo of their material Garred and Pritchard went in search of a gig, and according to Garred, they were able to book their first show simply because the landlord liked their hats. [...] "So we went in to get a gig, we don't have a demo blid burnt, and this guy told us, 'Well, you can't get a gig if you don't have a demo, but I like your hats, so I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> a gig'", said Garred.
