Actually {{there are}} similar efforts to {{legitimate}} {{the ideas of}} karma and rebirth, not wholly incompatible with naturalism but not reducible to it, as a helpful system of spiritual ethics. For instance, Joseph Loizzo suggests there is a role in contemporary philosophy and psychology for an intergenerational theory of human agency informed by the Buddhist theory of karma. He provides new interpretations of karma in light of psychological naturalism, and raises {{the idea that the}} rebirth of self as neither same nor different is descriptive of the natural process of intergenerational inheritance of habit patterns in the course of parentings and early development. The model of intergenerational agency he suggested is based on a comparative study of ordinary language philosophy in ancient India and the contemporary West. Its premise is that most theories of moral development and psychological agency are limited by the insistence on a substantial or essential <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> the <b>designation</b> of a person or self. Ordinary language philosophy offers greater conceptual freedom because it accepts a distinctively human theory of self as a linguistic construction that refers to mind/body systems and elements {{in which there is no}} substantial or essential self. This conceptual freedom permits a model of human agency as an open system of linguistic reference that can be transmitted across generations in the course of language acquisition. For further discussion on this topic, please see Loizzo (2011).|$|R
