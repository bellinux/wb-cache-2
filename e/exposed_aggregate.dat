2500|$|The second design {{obstacle}} {{involved the}} look of the building. [...] Arthur Q. Davis, of Davis & Curtis, said that the design team's goal was to avoid the typical blocky, monumental mass that typified too many office buildings. [...] The architects wanted to introduce a [...] "new vocabulary" [...] to D.C. architecture, one which emphasized a sense of floating, gracefulness, and rectilinear elements. According to Nathaniel Curtis, Jr., Davis's business partner, [...] "A controversy existed between those who wanted to maintain the granite and marble of the Federal City and the new thinkers who favored <b>exposed</b> <b>aggregate</b> concrete, steel, and glass." [...] In April 1963, the joint venture led by Curtis & Davis produced a low structure with glass panels held in place by aluminum frames. [...] Two symmetrical wings extended down either side of 10th Street SW. CFA, however, felt that the Modernist structure did not fit with the Neoclassical architecture of the capital. The CFA, which had explicit statutory authority over the aesthetics of the building, prodded the architectural joint venture to design a smaller building and to use traditional masonry. [...] The commission argued that [...] "uniqueness of individual design" [...] must come second to retaining a unified look for buildings along the National Mall.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Advanced {{processing}} {{techniques for}} the application of Fibre Reinforced Polymer (FRP) materials to repair concrete structures include the adoption of a vacuum consolidation process coupled with heat and/or resin injection to improve the curing process, bond strength and speed of application. The vacuum can contribute to the penetration of the resin into the surface around the <b>exposed</b> <b>aggregates</b> in order to achieve higher bond in strengthened elements. Since, debonding of FRP materials from the substrate is a brittle failure, it is essential to study this phenomenon and propose significant ways to improve the behaviour of the bondline. In this article, the interfacial bond behaviour of FRP laminates attached to concrete in the presence of vacuum and heat/resin injection is studied. The results of single lap shear tests have been utilized to investigate the capability of this system in strengthening of concrete elements. In this regard, several FRP-bonded concrete prisms will be examined in a single lap shear test set-up. Further, the effects of bondline thickness on the bond performance of adhesively bonded joints are studied...|$|R

Mass loss was higher and even lethal for isolated Chamaeleo chameleon eggs. However, aggregated eggs lost less water and most survived this period. After hydric stress, all surviving eggs gained mass via water absorption, and aggregation nega- tively aVected water uptake. Isolated eggs hatched at smaller sizes than aggregated eggs. Aggregation also favoured hatching synchrony. Large clutches may favour hatching success of terrestrial Xexible-shelled eggs incu- bated under severe drought conditions. Peer reviewe...|$|R

In relation to a potential therapeutic mechanism for atypical antipsychotic medications, clozapine {{has been shown to}} increase both NRG- 1 levels and synaptic markers in rodents. As evidence continues to mount for a potential restoration in connectivity by antipsychotic medications being a mode of efficacy we chose {{to examine the effects of}} the atypical antipsychotic clozapine and the typical antipsychotic haloperidol on NRG- 1 and SNARE protein transcripts in human brain <b>aggregates</b> <b>exposed</b> to plasma levels chronically for a period of three weeks. At the end of this exposure period we performed quantitative real-time PCR to investigate the mRNA levels of NRG- 1, VAMP- 1 and SNAP- 25. Overall we found that clozapine had the ability to upregulate NRG- 1 (+ 3. 58 fold change) and VAMP- 1 (+ 1. 92) while SNAP- 25 remained unchanged. Changes for haloperidol <b>exposed</b> <b>aggregates</b> were below our cut-off of + 1. 5. Overall the results of our investigation lend further support to atypical antipsychotic medications having the potential to increase levels of neurotrophic and synaptic markers such as NRG- 1 and VAMP- 1, the former being a strong candidate susceptibility gene for schizophrenia. In the absence of frank neuronal loss in schizophrenia, restoration of neuronal and synaptic functions by atypical antipsychotics in the brains of schizophrenics maybe a key mechanism of therapeutic efficacy by re-establishing normal connectivity and functioning...|$|R

30|$|We {{experimentally}} investigated thermal {{modifications of}} porous dust aggregates composed of micrometersized grains by furnace, electrical discharge, and laser radiation heating. In the furnace, porous SiO 2 aggregates of 95 % porosity at first underwent surface diffusion sintering, {{which led to}} progressively increasing necking between adjacent particles. Subsequently, viscous flow dissolved the particulate structure of the still porous sample, and finally melting occurred. <b>Exposing</b> <b>aggregates</b> of various grain types to electrical discharges dispersed most of the sample and left it thermally unprocessed. Nevertheless, some material was thermally processed to sintered aggregates and a tiny fraction to solidified melt spherules with diameters of less than 180 μm and most with interior bubbles. In comparison, radiative laser heating {{turned out to be}} a much more efficient process to produce melt spherules of chondrule size, and voids were rarer than in discharge heating. Besides providing material data for further applications, our work also allows a direct conclusion to be drawn on chondrule formation. Low energetic efficiency and aggregate destruction exclude chondrule formation from loosely-bound aggregates inside hypothetical nebular lightning channels. However, radiative heating of whatever origin, including possible lightning, remains a candidate process of chondrule formation.|$|R

40|$|The {{consumption}} of high-consumption households is more exposed to fluctuations in aggregate consumption and income {{than that of}} low-consumption households in the Consumer Expenditure (CEX) Survey. The exposure to aggregate consumption growth of households in the top 10 percent of the consumption distribution in the CEX is about five times that of households in the bottom 80 percent. Given real aggregate per capita consumption growth about 3 percentage points less than its historical mean during the past year, these figures predict that the ratio of {{consumption of}} the top 10 percent to the bottom 80 percent has fallen by about 15 percentage points (relative to trend). Using income data from Piketty and Saez (2003), we show that the income (especially the wage income) of rich households is more <b>exposed</b> to <b>aggregate</b> fluctuations, so their higher income exposure is a likely contributor to their higher consumption exposure. Finally, we find a striking change in the exposure of the incomes of high-income households: prior to the early 1980 's, the incomes of high-income households were not more <b>exposed</b> to <b>aggregate</b> fluctuations. Thus, while high-income households currently bear an inordinately large share of aggregate fluctuations, this is a recent occurrence. ...|$|R
