Woods won the match 2&1 to collect a check for $1,100,000, with Duval picking up $400,000. Both players donated $200,000 to charity, split between the <b>First</b> <b>Tee</b> initiative and charities of their choice.

25|$|The Memorial Tournament {{continues}} the PGA Tour's philanthropic focus through its relationships with Central Ohio charities. The most significant {{of which is}} its relationship with Nationwide Children's Hospital since 1976. Contributions generated through the support of over 2,600 volunteers are distributed each year to the Hospital's unrestricted giving fund. This fund assists in ensuring Central Ohio continues {{to have one of}} the best children's hospitals in the United States. The Memorial Tournament has raised more than $5.7million to support the programs and services at Nationwide Children's Hospital in those 30-plus years. In 2005 the Memorial made a pledge that will elevate its level of giving to more than $11million in the coming years. Unique and successful relationships also exist with Fore Hope, James Cancer Hospital, Wolfe Associates, The <b>First</b> <b>Tee,</b> Central Ohio Junior Golf Association, Shriners, Lions Club and many more.|$|E

Prior to the renovation, there was poor management, dirty grounds, and [...] "a proliferation of prostitutes and drug dealers operating much too close for comfort plagued the grounds."

2500|$|The total {{distance}} from the <b>first</b> <b>tee</b> box to the 18th green can be quite long; total yardages [...] "through the green" [...] can be in excess of , and when adding in the travel distance between the green of one hole and the tee of the next, even skilled players may easily travel five miles or more during a round. At some courses, electric golf carts are used to travel between shots, which can speed-up play and allows participation by individuals unable to walk a whole round. On other courses players generally walk the course, either carrying their bag using a shoulder strap or using a [...] "golf trolley" [...] for their bag. These trolleys {{may or may not}} be battery assisted. At many amateur tournaments including U.S. high school and college play, players are required to walk and to carry their own bags, but at the professional and top amateur level, as well as at high-level private clubs, players may be accompanied by caddies, who carry and manage the players' equipment and who are allowed by the rules to give advice on the play of the course. A caddie's advice can only be given to the player or players for whom the caddie is working, and not to other competing players.|$|E
2500|$|One of Louis's other passions was {{the game}} of golf, in which he also played a {{historic}} role. He was a long-time devotee of the sport since being introduced to the game before the first Schmeling fight in 1936. In 1952, Louis was invited to play as an amateur in the San Diego Open on a sponsor's exemption, becoming the first African American to play a PGA Tour event. Initially, the PGA of America was reluctant to allow Louis to enter the event, having a bylaw at the time limiting PGA membership to Caucasians. However, Louis's celebrity status eventually pushed the PGA toward removing the bylaw, but the [...] "Caucasian only" [...] clause in the PGA of America's constitution was not amended until November 1961. It {{paved the way for}} the first generation of African-American professional golfers such as Calvin Peete. Louis himself financially supported the careers of several other early black professional golfers, such as Bill Spiller, Ted Rhodes, Howard Wheeler, James Black, Clyde Martin and Charlie Sifford. He was also instrumental in founding The <b>First</b> <b>Tee,</b> a charity helping underprivileged children become acquainted with {{the game of}} golf. His son, Joe Louis Barrow, Jr., currently oversees the organization.|$|E

2500|$|With {{the stadium}} threat to Langston Golf Course gone, {{a number of}} {{improvements}} went ahead. In 1988, the Nation's Capital Bicentennial Celebration committee said it would spearhead a $15 million fund-raising project to build a family golf center at Langston. This project, however, was not forthcoming. In 1999, heavy rains washed away some fairways and greens, exposing buried trash (such as household appliances). An $8 million project to regrade the course to improve drainage began. A year later, the concessionaire agreed to begin a series of projects to bring Langston Golf Course up to Professional Golfers Association standards. In 2002, a print of a painting by noted local artist Linwood Barnes depicting Clyde Martin taking the first drive at Langston Golf Course was hung in the clubhouse. In May 2002, Langston Golf Course {{became one of the}} first courses to host a <b>First</b> <b>Tee</b> chapter, a program designed to interest minorities and economically disadvantaged children in golf. In 2002 and 2003, Langston Golf Course opened a putt-and-chip practice area for young golfers and a four-hole course for novices. An academic resource center with computer stations, a small library, and tutoring and study programs was also opened. Students from local junior and senior high schools who study their schoolwork in the education center for an hour are awarded a free hour golf on the course. In 2002, about 200 students took advantage of the educational center. (The number had risen to 400 students by 2006.) The National Park Service and the concessionaire also established a strategic plan to raise $12 million to $17 million in public and private funds to complete the upgrade to PGA tour standards, build a new clubhouse with banquet facilities, establish a museum dedicated to African American golfers, replace the driving range, and expand the education center. In 2007, D.C. Delegate to Congress Eleanor Holmes Norton introduced the [...] "Golf Course Preservation and Modernization Act" [...] in Congress, legislation which would allow the National Park Service (NPS) to lease Langston and the other federally owned golf courses in the District of Columbia (rather than simply offer a concession contract). A long-term lease, Norton said, would allow the lessee to obtain high levels of capital investment funds and greatly improve the courses.|$|E

5000|$|The word tee {{is derived}} from the Scottish Gaelic word [...] meaning house and is related to the 'house' (the {{coloured}} circles) in curling. This would make sense, as the <b>first</b> golf <b>tees</b> were within a circle of one golf club length round the hole. Nowadays, modern courses have separate, designated tee boxes for each hole. For example, the ninth hole of a course is played from the ninth tee to the ninth green, and similarly for the other holes.|$|R

5000|$|The Golden Tee series {{began as}} a project at Incredible Technologies to create a large scale golf {{simulator}} for sizable family entertainment centers. The idea was scrapped, but not before programmer Larry Hodgson had already written software to create virtual golf courses. Rather than discard his work, Hodgson retooled the concept to develop a golf game for regular arcade cabinets. He worked with co-designer Jim Zielinski, who initially rendered the courses using Deluxe Paint. Instead of a regular joystick and buttons for controls, they used a trackball, which Incredible Technologies had previously used for Capcom Bowling.The <b>first</b> Golden <b>Tee</b> was playtested in bars, a venue which would become a popular location for Golden <b>Tee</b> cabinets. This <b>first</b> iteration was sold exclusively as a kit {{that could be used}} to convert existing arcade machines to Golden Tee. Released in 1989, the <b>first</b> Golden <b>Tee</b> sold relatively well, but the series first found great success with Golden Tee 3D several years later. [...] The 1995 Peter Jacobsen's Golden Tee 3D Golf was the first in the series to support online networked play. Rather than being networked to each other, the cabinets were all linked to a central computer which compared scores for tournament play. The first test tournament, held on 24 game cabinets in the Chicago area from November 24 to December 17, 1995, awarded real money to the winners, including a $1,000 grand prize. The tournament gave rise to a large competitive play scene for the franchise.|$|R
