500|$|Bandslam was The Washington Post's critic choice, {{having a}} perfect score of 4/4 stars. Bandslam was somehow {{associated}} with High School Musical {{in a couple}} of reviews. However, the reviews concluded the comparisons positively, saying that Bandslam was [...] "actually a lot quirkier than the posters would have you believe." [...] New Jersey's local newspaper, The Star Ledger says that the plot is nicely skewed: [...] "Basically, it's the standard teen picture – girl torn between bad boy and nice guy – with a gender switch." [...] Michael Phillips of The Los Angeles Times praised the film by saying: [...] "Bandslam <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> movie given that the odds of it having been a pretty bad movie were steep." [...] Critic Andy Webster of The New York Times said that Bandslam may not entirely break new teen-movie ground, but it does offer intriguing glimpses of performers ready to bolt from the Disney stable.|$|E

Swash wrote that it [...] "highlighted the diverging facets of hip-hop in the last decade; the former was gangsta rap for the noughties, while West was the thinking man's alternative." [...] Similarly, according to DJBooth, while Graduation is far from being West's best studio album, it nevertheless <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> piece of work while the outcome of its competition with 50 Cent stands as a historical moment in hip-hop culture: [...] "Graduation isn’t Kanye's best, it's very few people's favorite, but it’s still an okay body of work. He’s literally transitioning into stardom right before our very eyes and attempting to embody that moment in time. Kanye's victory over 50 is the bookmark for when rap changed, it was no longer ran by the gangsters, the doors opened for Drake, Kid Cudi and J. Cole. Graduation is a monument, a hip-hop treasure, a Kanye classic." ...|$|E

[...] He went on to state that while Velvet Revolver's [...] "heritage is evident on most of the songs", Contraband [...] "improves with repeat listening, which is encouraging." [...] Velvet Revolver's second album Libertad saw the band's style change with the presence of producer Brendan O'Brien, noted by Allmusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine.

2500|$|At 10:00am, October 28, Kennedy {{first learned}} of Khrushchev's {{solution}} to the crisis to remove the 15 Jupiters in Turkey and the Soviets would remove the rockets from Cuba. Khrushchev had made the offer in a public statement {{for the world to}} hear. Despite almost solid opposition from his senior advisers, Kennedy quickly embraced the Soviet offer. [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> play of his," [...] Kennedy said, according to a tape recording that he made secretly of the Cabinet Room meeting. Kennedy had deployed the Jupiters in March of the year, causing a stream of angry outbursts from Khrushchev.

Vice President Lyndon Johnson was the first to endorse the missile swap but others continued to oppose the offer. Finally, Kennedy ended the debate. [...] "We can't very well invade Cuba with all its toil and blood," [...] Kennedy said, [...] "when we could have gotten them out by making a deal on the same missiles on Turkey.

2500|$|Digital Spy writer, Mayor Nissim, {{asserted}} that [...] "aside from the vocals and lyrics, {{much of the}} music here wouldn't sound {{out of place in}} the UK or US charts, which is both a good and bad thing." [...] He also {{went on to say that}} [...] "the fact Manos and several other songs feature rather Americanised production can prevent them from completely hitting the mark" [...] because, as he put it, [...] "Furtado's tunes don't always get the Spanish wallop her vocals deserve." [...] MusicOMH said in its review that [...] "For the most part, the album <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> listen" [...] and claimed that songs from the album are [...] "pleasant but never overly diverting." [...] Paul Lester, a writer for BBC, gave the album a mixed review and said the music is [...] "equally inoffensive". The writer compared it to her previous release, Loose and claimed that [...] "Timbaland's inventive approach to dance motion is much missed". Entertainment Weekly also stated, [...] "Without the Midas touch of studio magician Timbaland, Furtado has only her nasal, pleasant-enough vocals and a distinctly middlebrow musicality." [...] Kevin Liedel of Slant Magazine was very critical, writing, [...] " [...] manifests itself here in a labored and predictable fashion" [...] and also said it is [...] "heartless, with forced sincerity".|$|E
2500|$|Vince Aletti from Rolling Stone {{also gave}} an {{unfavorable}} review, stating [...] "the formula is more rigorously locked in than before, {{and the range}} so tightly circumscribed that Houston's potential seems to have shrunk rather than expanded" [...] and the record is [...] "smug, repressive and ridiculously safe." [...] Also, he made some sarcastic comments about the first single, [...] "I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)", calling it [...] "How Will I Know II", spoken at Hollywood's blockbuster sequels. Robert Hilburn, in his review for Los Angeles Times, regarded the album as [...] "another commercial blockbuster", writing that the record is [...] "a series of highly accessible selections that will work {{on a variety of}} radio formats." [...] However, he expressed his considerable disappointment that Whitney did precious little to define the singer's vision, adding that she had a sensational voice but didn't assert much vocal character on it. Dolores Barclay of The Associated Press complimented Houston on her vocal ability: [...] "Whitney Houston has a fine instrument and uses it well. Her voice takes us to places we know and to places we might want to forget and to places we dream about." [...] But she, like other critics, was critical of the song material on the record, commenting [...] "There is no depth, and not much excitement. Nor does this talented song stylist and Grammy winner take risks and try something just a little daring." [...] St. Petersburg Times showed a favorable attitude toward her new album at large, stating [...] " [...] is, first and foremost, a product. It has been carefully designed, manufactured and packaged. As such, it's easy to be cynical about. But as products go, this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> one."
