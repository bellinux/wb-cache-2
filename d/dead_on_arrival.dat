40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effects of pen size on stress responses (during loading and unloading) and transport losses at the packing plant. This study took place between July and August. Twenty-six loads of split sex market weight pigs (n = 4, 522) from three conventional grow-finish sites were used in a randomized complete block design. Each site had two rooms with both treatment groups represented in each room. The small pen (SP) treatment had 36 pigs/pen (0. 59 m 2 *pig- 1). The large pen treatment (LP) had 324 pigs/pen (0. 59 m*pig- 1). Both pen size treatments were sorted from pen mates at the time of marketing. Pigs were moved in groups of four to six using sort boards and electric prods, when necessary. Treatments were randomly assigned to a trailer deck (0. 42 m 2 *pig- 1). Straight deck trailers were used and pigs were transported 1 h to a commercial harvest facility. During loading and unloading, the number of pigs displaying open mouth breathing (OMB), skin discoloration (SD), and muscle tremors (MT) were recorded. At the plant, dead and non-ambulatory pigs were recorded during unloading, and total losses were defined as the sum of dead and non-ambulatory pigs at the plant. Data was analyzed using Proc Glimmix of SAS. Statistical analysis could not be run on the incidence of muscle tremors or non-ambulatory pigs at loading or injured and <b>deads</b> <b>on</b> <b>arrival</b> (DOA) at the harvest facility because there were too many zeros in the dataset. Incidence of MT was 0. 04...|$|R

This study took place between December and March. Thirty three loads of mixed sex market weight pigs (n = 5802) from three conventional grow-finish sites were used in a randomized complete block design. Each site had two rooms with both treatment groups represented in each room. The large pen, pre-sorted (LPS) treatment had 292 pigs/pen (0. 67 m 2 *pig - 1). LPS pigs were sorted from pen mates 18 h prior to loading. The large pen, not pre-sorted treatment (LNPS) also had 292 pigs/pen (0. 67 m 2 *pig- 1). LNPS pigs were sorted from pen mates at the time of marketing. Pigs were moved in groups of four to six using sort boards and electric prods, when necessary. Treatments were randomly assigned to a trailer deck (0. 41 m 2 *pig- 1). Straight deck trailers were used and pigs were transported 1 h to a commercial harvest facility.

Now one of its members staggers into a Christian mission but dies within hours. He carries identification: he is Gerald Clark, ex-Special Forces. Two years before the expedition, while in Iraq, the CIA operative's left arm was amputated at the shoulder. Photographs of the corpse and fingerprints reveal that the arm has grown back perfectly.
