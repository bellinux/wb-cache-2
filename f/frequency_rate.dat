50|$|Motion {{tracking}} or {{motion capture}} {{started as a}} photogrammetric analysis tool in biomechanics research in the 1970s and 1980s, and expanded into education, training, sports and recently computer animation for television, cinema, and video games as the technology matured. Since the 20th century the performer has to wear markers near each joint to identify the motion by the positions or angles between the markers. Acoustic, inertial, LED, magnetic or reflective markers, or combinations of any of these, are tracked, optimally at least two times the <b>frequency</b> <b>rate</b> of the desired motion. The resolution {{of the system is}} important in both the spatial resolution and temporal resolution as motion blur causes almost the same problems as low resolution. Since the beginning of the 21st century and because of the rapid growth of technology new methods were developed. Most modern systems can extract the silhouette of the performer from the background. Afterwards all joint angles are calculated by fitting in a mathematic model into the silhouette. For movements you can't see a change of the silhouette, there are hybrid Systems available who can do both (marker and silhouette), but with less marker.|$|E
40|$|What is the {{stimulus}} presentation {{rate at which}} the human brain can discriminate each exemplar of a familiar visual category? We presented faces at 14 <b>frequency</b> <b>rates</b> (1. 0 - 16. 66 Hz) to human observers while recording high-density electroencephalogram (EEG). Different face exemplars elicited a larger steady-state visual evoked (ssVEP) response than when the same face was repeated, but only for stimulation frequencies between 4 and 8. 33 Hz, with a maximal difference at 5. 88 Hz (170 ms cycle). The effect was confined to the exact stimulation frequency and localized over the right occipito-temporal cortex. At high <b>frequency</b> <b>rates</b> (> 10 Hz), the response to different and identical exemplars did not differ, suggesting that the fine-grained analysis needed for individual face discrimination cannot be completed before the next face interrupts, or competes, with the processed face. At low rates (< 3 Hz), repetition suppression could not be identified at the stimulation frequency, suggesting that the neural response to an individual face is temporally dispersed and distributed over different processes. These observations indicate that at a temporal rate of 170 ms (6 faces/s) the face perception network is able to fully discriminate between each individual face presented, providing information about the temporal bottleneck of individual face discrimination in humans. These results also have important practical implications for optimizing paradigms that rely on repetition suppression, and open an avenue for investigating complex visual processes at an optimal range of stimulation <b>frequency</b> <b>rates...</b>|$|R

5000|$|He also {{invented a}} {{mechanical}} device, the Goldschmidt tone wheel, used in early radio receivers {{to receive the}} new continuous wave radiotelegraph signals. The first radio transmitter, the spark-gap transmitter, produced a string of damped waves {{that sounded like a}} buzz or tone in a radio receiver, so the pulses of radio waves used to transmit Morse code were audible as [...] "beeps" [...] in the receiver. However, the new transmitters like the Goldschmidt alternator generated unmodulated continuous waves, which were inaudible in receivers. To make them audible, the tone wheel receiver used the heterodyne principle to convert the radio frequency to an audio frequency. The tone wheel was a disk with contacts around the rim, spun by a small electric motor, which interrupted the incoming radio signal at a radio <b>frequency</b> <b>rate.</b> The tone wheel acted as a crude beat frequency oscillator (BFO), introducing a second radio frequency which combined with the received signal to create a [...] "beat" [...] (heterodyne) frequency at the difference of the two frequencies, in the audio range. For example, if the frequency of the received signal was 60,000 Hz, the tone wheel could be adjusted to introduce a frequency of 59,000 Hz, creating a 1,000 Hz tone which could be heard in the earphones as a musical [...] "beep" [...] whenever the carrier was present.|$|E

40|$|In {{a highly}} dynamic visual {{environment}} {{the human brain}} needs to rapidly differentiate complex visual patterns, such as faces. Here, we defined the temporal frequency tuning of cortical face-sensitive areas for face discrimination. Six observers were tested with {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) when the same or different faces were presented in blocks at 11 <b>frequency</b> <b>rates</b> (ranging from 1 to 12 Hz). We observed a larger fMRI response for different than same faces - the repetition suppression/adaptation effect - across all stimulation <b>frequency</b> <b>rates.</b> Most importantly, the magnitude of the repetition suppression effect showed a typical Gaussian-shaped tuning function, peaking on average at 6 Hz for all face-sensitive areas of the ventral occipito-temporal cortex, including the fusiform and occipital "face areas" (FFA and OFA), as well as the posterior temporal sulcus. This effect was due both to a maximal response to different faces in a range of 3 to 6 Hz and to a sharp drop of the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal from 6 Hz onward when the same face was repeated during a block. These observations complement recent scalp EEG observations (Alonso-Prieto et al., 2013), indicating that the cortical face network can discriminate each individual face when these successive faces are presented every 160 - 170 ms. They also suggest that a relatively fast 6 Hz rate may be needed to isolate the contribution of high-level face perception processes during behavioral discrimination tasks. Finally, these findings carry important practical implications, allowing investigators to optimize the stimulation <b>frequency</b> <b>rates</b> for observing the largest repetition suppression effects to faces and other visual forms in the occipito-temporal cortex...|$|R
