5|$|Behavioural {{interventions}} {{attempt to}} identify and reduce the antecedents and consequences of problem behaviours. This approach has not shown success in improving overall functioning, but can help to reduce some specific problem behaviours, such as incontinence.

Alternatively, bone defects are graded from A to D (A=10+mm of bone, B=7–9mm, C=4–6mm and D=0–3mm) where an implant's likelihood of osseointegrating is related to the grade of bone.|$|E
5|$|Fielding's ninth play, the {{unsuccessful}} The Letter Writers Or, a New Way to Keep a Wife at Home, ran {{for four}} nights as a companion piece to The Tragedy of Tragedies but was soon after replaced by The Welsh Opera on 22 April 1731. The play followed two characters whose wives are busy having affairs {{and how they}} attempt to keep their wives faithful.

On the contrary, virtually all forts identified as built or occupied in the 4th century on the Danube lay on, very near or even beyond the river, strikingly similar to the 2nd-century distribution.|$|E

5|$|RAD {{is one of}} {{the least}} {{researched}} and most poorly understood disorders in the DSM. There is little systematic epidemiologic information on RAD, its course is not well established and it appears difficult to diagnose accurately. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> clarity about the presentation of attachment disorders over the age of five years and difficulty in distinguishing between aspects of attachment disorders, disorganized attachment or the consequences of maltreatment.|$|E
5|$|Thurso {{has been}} twinned with Brilon, Germany since 1972, after two {{men from the}} {{respective}} towns met in London and agreed a formal link. The twinning has come under threat as Thurso High School no longer participates in its activities and there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> young people willing to preserve relationships between the towns.|$|E
5|$|Children with RAD are {{presumed to}} have grossly {{disturbed}} internal working models of relationships {{that may lead}} to interpersonal and behavioral difficulties in later life. There are few studies of long-term effects, and there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> clarity about the presentation of the disorder beyond the age of five years. However, the opening of orphanages in Eastern Europe following the end of the Cold War in the early-1990s provided opportunities for research on infants and toddlers brought up in very deprived conditions. Such research broadened the understanding of the prevalence, causes, mechanism and assessment of disorders of attachment and led to efforts from the late-1990s onwards to develop treatment and prevention programs and better methods of assessment. Mainstream theorists in the field have proposed that a broader range of conditions arising from problems with attachment should be defined beyond current classifications.|$|E

5|$|Complementary therapies {{have been}} {{investigated}} for treating people with acne. Low-quality evidence suggests topical application of tea tree oil or bee venom may reduce {{the total number of}} skin lesions in those with acne. Tea tree oil is thought to be approximately as effective as benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid, but has been associated with allergic contact dermatitis. Proposed mechanisms for tea tree oil's anti-acne effects include antibacterial action against P. acnes, and anti-inflammatory properties. Numerous other plant-derived therapies have been observed to have positive effects against acne (e.g., basil oil and oligosaccharides from seaweed); however, few studies have been performed, and most have been of lower methodological quality. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> high-quality evidence for the use of acupuncture, herbal medicine, or cupping therapy for acne.|$|E
5|$|Four {{different}} attachment classifications {{have been}} identified in children: secure attachment, anxious-ambivalent attachment, anxious-avoidant attachment, and disorganized attachment. Secure attachment is when children feel they can rely on their caregivers to attend to their needs of proximity, emotional support and protection. It is considered to be the best attachment style. Anxious-ambivalent attachment is when the infant feels separation anxiety when separated from the caregiver and does not feel reassured when the caregiver returns to the infant. Anxious-avoidant attachment is when the infant avoids their parents. Disorganized attachment is when there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> attachment behavior.|$|E
5|$|In {{countries}} where {{women have to}} do paid work in order to feed their family, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> regulation and safety standards regarding female workers due to {{the large amount of}} informal work available. In Thailand for example, due to the severe economic crisis in 1997, many women have jobs in the informal industry, and often do home-based work so that they can do their domestic jobs concurrently with their paid jobs. This increases the work intensity by women doing more than one job at a time, and has been shown to have deteriorating effects on women's health.|$|E

5|$|In the {{clinical}} sense, a disorder {{is a condition}} requiring treatment as opposed to risk factors for subsequent disorders. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> consensus about the precise {{meaning of the term}} 'attachment disorder' although there is general agreement that such disorders only arise following early adverse caregiving experiences. Reactive attachment disorder indicates the absence of either or both the main aspects of proximity seeking to an identified attachment figure. This can occur either in institutions, or with repeated changes of caregiver, or from extremely neglectful primary caregivers who show persistent disregard for the child's basic attachment needs after the age of 6 months. Current official classifications of RAD under DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10 are largely based on this {{understanding of the nature of}} attachment.|$|E
5|$|Symptoms of {{diabetes}} insipidus should prompt a formal fluid deprivation test {{to assess the}} body's response to dehydration, which normally causes concentration of the urine and increasing osmolarity of the blood. If these parameters are unchanged, desmopressin (an ADH analogue) is administered. If the urine then becomes concentrated and the blood osmolarity falls, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> ADH {{due to lack of}} pituitary function ("cranial diabetes insipidus"). In contrast, there is no change if the kidneys are unresponsive to ADH due to a different problem ("nephrogenic diabetes insipidus").|$|E
5|$|The main {{economic}} sector in Tubas is agriculture. There {{is a total}} of 150,000 dunams of arable land, of which 124,450 dunams are covered by forests and 10,604 dunams cultivated. Although the land is fertile, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> water for irrigation. The only spring used is the nearby Ein Far'a. Field crops account for 49% of the cultivable land, while fruit orchards account for 40% and vegetables make-up 11%. Israeli trenches around the neighboring villages of Ras al-Ahmar and Khirbet al-'Atuf prevent access to nearly 40% of Tubas' arable lands.|$|E

5|$|The {{strength}} of research support for each recommendation varies; {{some of the}} more robustly researched and supported recommendations include the negative effects of noisy sleep environments, alcohol consumption in the hours before sleep, engaging in mentally difficult tasks before sleep, and trying too hard to fall asleep. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> evidence for the effects of certain sleep hygiene recommendations, including getting a more comfortable mattress, removing bedroom clocks, not worrying, and limiting liquids. Other recommendations, such as the effects of napping or exercise, have a more complicated evidence base. The effects of napping, for example, seem to depend on the length and timing of napping, in conjunction with how much cumulative sleep an individual has had in recent nights.|$|E
5|$|Unusual eating {{behavior}} {{occurs in}} {{about three-quarters of}} children with ASD, {{to the extent that}} it was formerly a diagnostic indicator.
