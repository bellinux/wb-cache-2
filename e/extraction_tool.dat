40|$|Abstract — Metal fills, {{which are}} used to reduce metal {{thickness}} variations due to chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP), increase the capacitances in a circuit. Although current <b>extraction</b> <b>tools</b> are accurate in handling grounded fills and regular interconnects, for floating fills, these tools are based on certain approximations, such as assuming that floating fills are grounded or each fill is merged with neighboring ones. To reduce such inaccuracies, we provide a design of experiments (DOE), which {{will be used in}} addition to what is available in the <b>extraction</b> <b>tools</b> for regular interconnects. Through the proposed DOE set, a design or mask house can generate normalized fill tables to remove the inaccuracies of the <b>extraction</b> <b>tools</b> in the presence of floating fills. The capacitance values are updated using these normalized fill tables. The proposed DOE enables extensive analyses of the fill impacts on coupling capacitances. We show through extensive 3 D field solver simulations that the assumptions used in extractors result in significant inaccuracies. We present analyses of fill impacts for an example technology, and also provide analyses using the normalized fill tables {{to be used in the}} extraction flow for three different standard fill algorithms.

50|$|Interconnect {{capacitance}} {{is calculated}} {{by giving the}} <b>extraction</b> <b>tool</b> the following information: the top view layout of the design {{in the form of}} input polygons on a set of layers; a mapping to a set of devices and pins (from a Layout Versus Schematic run), and a cross sectional understanding of these layers. This information is used to create a set of layout wires that have added capacitors where the input polygons and cross sectional structure indicate. The output netlist contains the same set of input nets as the input design netlist and adds parasitic capacitor devices between these nets.|$|E

Adults are about 12 cm long. They have grey-brown upperparts with small black and white spots and pale grey underparts with a light brown rump. Additional distinctive features include a light grey line over the eye, a long slightly decurved thin bill, a long barred tail and dark legs. They actively hunt on the ground, around and under objects, probing with their bill as their <b>extraction</b> <b>tool.</b> They mainly eat insects and spiders. Its song is a trill that becomes more varied during the nesting season.|$|E
50|$|Interconnect {{resistance}} is calculated {{by giving the}} <b>extraction</b> <b>tool</b> the following information: the top view layout of the design {{in the form of}} input polygons on a set of layers; a mapping to a set of devices and pins (from a Layout Versus Schematic run), and a cross sectional understanding of these layers including the resistivity of the layers. This information is used to create a set of layout sub.wires that have added resistance between various sub-parts of the wires. The above Interconnect Capacitance is divided and shared amongst the sub-nodes in a proportional way. Note that unlike Interconnect Capacitance, Interconnect Resistance needs to add sub-nodes between the circuit elements to place these parasitic resistors. This can greatly increase the size of the extracted output netlist and can cause additional simulation problems.|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} few years, several works in the {{literature}} have addressed the problem of data extraction from Web pages. The importance of this problem derives from the fact that, once extracted, the data can be handled in a way similar to instances of a traditional database. The approaches proposed in the literature {{to address the problem}} of Web data extraction use techniques borrowed from areas such as natural language processing, languages and grammars, machine learning, information retrieval, databases, and ontologies. As a consequence, they present very distinct features and capabilities which make a direct comparison difficult to be done. In this paper, we propose a taxonomy for characterizing Web data <b>extraction</b> <b>tools,</b> briefly survey major Web data <b>extraction</b> <b>tools</b> described in the literature, and provide a qualitative analysis of them.

Our solution is based on two main components, a terminology <b>extraction</b> <b>tool</b> and a domain-specific ontology. The terminology <b>extraction</b> <b>tool</b> identifies the terminology that describes {{the contents of a}} particular document. Then, these terms are linked to a domain-specific ontology.

40|$|Considering {{the fact}} that most of the {{multimedia}} database systems include querying by object features, a novel approach for color and shape querying and retrieval is proposed. The approach is histogram-based and it is supported by an auxiliary object <b>extraction</b> <b>tool</b> in the query-by-feature component of a multimedia database system. The object <b>extraction</b> <b>tool</b> is semi-automatic, hence it can successfully capture salient object regions for most of the images and/or video frames. The use of the object <b>extraction</b> <b>tool</b> facilitates object-based querying of color and shape content. In the histogram-based approach, the color and shape can be integrated to improve the performance of querying. It is shown through performance experiments that the histogram-based approach overcomes the deficiencies of the existing methods for querying by shape. The evaluation of the effectiveness and the robustness of the histogram-based approach is also presented via performance experiments...|$|E

40|$|Extracting {{the brain}} cortex from {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) head scans is an essential preprocessing step of which the accuracy greatly affects subsequent image analysis. The currently popular Brain <b>Extraction</b> <b>Tool</b> (BET) produces a brain mask which may be too smooth for practical use. This paper presents a novel brain <b>extraction</b> <b>tool</b> based on three-dimensional geodesic active contours, connected component analysis and mathematical morphology. Based on user-specified intensity and contrast levels, the proposed algorithm allows an active contour to evolve naturally and extract the brain cortex. Experiments on synthetic MRI data and scanned coronal and axial MRI image volumes indicate successful extraction of tight perimeters surrounding the brain cortex. Quantitative evaluations on both synthetic phantoms and manually labeled data resulted in better accuracy than BET in terms of true and false voxel assignment. Based on these results, we illustrate that our brain <b>extraction</b> <b>tool</b> is a robust and accurate approach for the challenging task of automatically extracting the brain cortex in MRI data...|$|E
