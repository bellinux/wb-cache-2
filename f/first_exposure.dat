5|$|Thanks to {{research}} conducted by the Musée suisse de l'appareil photographique at Vevey, much more {{is known about the}} pigeon cameras developed {{at about the same time}} by the Swiss clockmaker Christian Adrian Michel (1912–1980) in Walde. He was assigned to the Swiss Army's carrier pigeons service in 1931, and in 1933 he began work on adapting Neubronner's panoramic camera to 16mm film, and improving it with a mechanism to control the delay before the <b>first</b> <b>exposure</b> and to transport the film between exposures. Michel's camera, patented in 1937, weighed only , and may have been one of the first to have a timer operated by clockwork.|$|E
5|$|Early Philippine {{sculpture}} {{is characterized}} by frontal nudity. One of the earliest forms are the bulols by the Ifugao people which serve as an assurance for bountiful harvests. The original function of these sculptures {{are related to the}} ceremonies and beliefs of the tribes who created them. Arab and Russian missionaries also brought beveled type of carvings in the form of Okkil. The beginnings of this sculpture type started with the Islamization of Sulu. The Spanish colonization of the country did not hinder Filipinos creating sculptures for objects of adoration. During this time, sculptures of deities and saints were used to teach Filipinos Christian doctrines. During the American colonialism, worshippers of faith were not discouraged to sculpt in order to adorn churches. Filipinos' <b>first</b> <b>exposure</b> to painting happened when Spain conquered the Philippines and these were used as religious propaganda often displayed in churches. However, as education progressed and wealth increased, more and more artists started to shift from the traditional religious motifs to a more secular pattern of imagery.|$|E

5|$|In May 1958, No.1 Applied Flying Training School began {{equipping}} with Vampire jet trainers at RAAF Base Pearce, Western Australia. As RAAF {{pilots were}} now gaining their <b>first</b> <b>exposure</b> to jets elsewhere, No.2 OTU took {{over from the}} fighter squadrons the responsibility of converting trained jet pilots to Sabres. Reflecting its new primary role, it was renamed No.2 (Fighter) Operational Conversion Unit (No.2 OCU) in September 1958, and ceased Vampire courses the same month. Wing Commander Neville McNamara, later Chief of the Air Staff (CAS) and Chief of the Defence Force Staff, served as commanding officer from August 1959 until January 1961. During his tenure, the unit undertook exercises with No.75 Squadron at RAAF Bases Amberley, Townsville and Darwin. Two Sabre pilots from No.2 OCU and one from No.75 Squadron died in separate incidents early in 1960; each had attempted to eject at low level and suffered fatal head injuries from colliding with the aircraft's canopy during the ejection sequence. All RAAF Sabres were grounded until ARDU developed a modification to shatter the canopy immediately before the pilot ejected.|$|E
5|$|Poliomyelitis {{is highly}} {{contagious}} via the fecal-oral (intestinal source) and the oral-oral (oropharyngeal source) routes. In endemic areas, wild polioviruses can infect {{virtually the entire}} human population. It is seasonal in temperate climates, with peak transmission occurring in summer and autumn. These seasonal differences are far less pronounced in tropical areas. The time between <b>first</b> <b>exposure</b> and first symptoms, known as the incubation period, is usually 6 to 20days, with a maximum range of 3 to 35days. Virus particles are excreted in the feces for several weeks following initial infection. The disease is transmitted primarily via the fecal-oral route, by ingesting contaminated food or water. It is occasionally transmitted via the oral-oral route, a mode especially visible in areas with good sanitation and hygiene. Polio is most infectious between 7 and 10 days {{before and after the}} appearance of symptoms, but transmission is possible as long as the virus remains in the saliva or feces.|$|E
5|$|Stowell's article {{attracted}} intense attention, {{and placed}} Albert Victor {{among the most}} notable Ripper suspects, but his innocence was soon proven. Gull died before Albert Victor, and so {{could not have known}} about Albert Victor's death. All three doctors who were attending Albert Victor at his death in 1892 concurred that he had died of pneumonia, and given the timescale of syphilitic disease progression, it is highly improbable that Albert Victor had syphilis. The first symptoms of mental illness that arise from syphilitic infection tend to occur about 15 years from <b>first</b> <b>exposure.</b> While the timescale of disease progression is never absolute, for Albert Victor to have suffered from syphilitic insanity in 1888, he would probably have to have been infected at the age of nine in about 1873, six years before he visited the West Indies. Stowell claimed that his suspect had been incarcerated in a mental institution, when Albert Victor was serving in the British army, making regular public appearances, and visiting friends at country houses. Newspaper reports, Queen Victoria's diary, family letters, and official documents prove that Albert Victor was attending functions in public, or meeting foreign royalty, or hundreds of miles from London at the time of each of the five canonical murders.|$|E

40|$|In {{teaching}} reading, educators {{strive to}} find the balance between a code-emphasis approach and a meaning-oriented literacy approach. However, {{little is known about}} how different approaches to literacy can benefit bilingual children’s early reading acquisition. To investigate the novel hypothesis that children’s age of <b>first</b> bilingual <b>exposure</b> can interact with different approaches to literacy, we tested 56 Spanish-English bilingual children (ages 7 – 9), with birth exposure to Spanish and either early (before age 3) or late (3 – 4) age of <b>first</b> bilingual <b>exposure</b> to English. The children attended reading programs identified with either phonics or whole language emphasis. Consistent with our hypothesis, differential outcomes were linked to different ages of <b>first</b> bilingual <b>exposure.</b> Early bilingual exposure to English was associated with more advanced reading abilities under whole language emphasis, while later (ages 3 – 4) exposure was associated with better decoding and reading abilities under phonics emphasis. The findings show that knowing the age of a child’s <b>first</b> bilingual language <b>exposure,</b> as it corresponds to different periods in child development, may contribute to an educator’s design of reading instruction that best accommodates young bilingual learners...|$|R
