2500|$|A {{molecule}} {{of dietary}} fat typically consists of several fatty acids (containing long chains of carbon and hydrogen atoms), bonded to a glycerol. They are typically found as triglycerides (three fatty acids attached to one glycerol backbone). Fats may {{be classified as}} saturated or unsaturated depending on the detailed structure of the fatty acids involved. Saturated fats {{have all of the}} carbon atoms in their fatty acid chains bonded to hydrogen atoms, whereas unsaturated fats have some of these carbon atoms double-bonded, so their molecules have relatively fewer hydrogen atoms than a saturated fatty acid of the same length. Unsaturated fats may be further classified as monounsaturated (one double-bond) or polyunsaturated (many double-bonds). Furthermore, depending on the location of the double-bond in the fatty acid chain, unsaturated fatty acids are classified as omega-3 or omega-6 fatty acids. Trans fats are a type of unsaturated fat with trans-isomer bonds; these are rare in nature and in foods from natural sources; they are typically created in an industrial process called (partial) hydrogenation. [...] There are nine kilocalories in each gram of fat. Fatty acids such as conjugated linoleic acid, catalpic acid, <b>eleostearic</b> <b>acid</b> and punicic acid, in addition to providing energy, represent potent immune modulatory molecules.|$|E

It is often called simply <b>eleostearic</b> <b>acid</b> although there is also a β-eleostearic acid (the all-trans or (9E,11E,13E) isomer).

40|$|ABSTRACT: Tung oil is an {{industrial}} drying oil containing ca. 90 % PUFA. We previously reported on enzymes {{required for the}} synthesis of linoleic (6 % of FA) and <b>eleostearic</b> (80 %) <b>acids</b> and here describe the cloning and functional analysis of an omega- 3 FA desaturase (FAD 3) required for the synthesis of linolenic acid (1 %). The tung FAD 3 cDNA was identified by screening a tung seed cDNA library using the polymerase chain reaction and degenerate primers encoding conserved regions of the FAD 3 enzyme family. Expression of this cDNA in yeast cells, cultured {{in the presence of}} linoleic acid, resulted in the synthesis and accumulation of linolenic acid, which accounted for up to 18 % w/w of total cellular FA. Tung FAD 3 activity was significantly affected by cultivation temperature, with the great-est amount of linolenic acid accumulating in yeast cells grown at 15 °C. The amount of linolenic acid synthesized in yeast cells by tung FAD 3 is ca. 10 -fold higher than that observed by expres-sion of a rapeseed (Brassica napus) FAD 3 in yeast, suggesting that tung FAD 3 might be useful for biotechnological production of omega- 3 FA in transgenic organisms...|$|R
40|$|The {{oleaginous}} yeast Apiotrichum curvatum ATCC 20509 {{was grown}} on various lipids as carbon sources. When commercial oils {{were used as}} substrates, the yeast triglyceride had a fatty acid profile {{similar to that of}} the substrate oil, but the glyceride structure was altered. The yeast did not utilize saturated free fatty acids with less than 14 carbons. An emulsion of palmitic acid was well utilized by the yeast, however stearic and arachidic acid emulsions gave very limited and no growth, respectively. Palmitic and stearic acids were extensively desaturated before being deposited in the yeast triglyceride. Oleic acid supported very good yeast growth; eicosenoic acid supported limited growth; erucic acid gave very poor growth. The yeast grew on petroselinic acid and deposited it extensively in its triglyceride. When the medium was supplemented with 1000 ppm butylated hydroxyanisole, linoleic and linolenic acids supported excellent growth and lipid accumulation. The yeast deposited ricinoleic, <b>eleostearic</b> and vernolic <b>acids</b> in its triglyceride when the yeast was grown on triglycerides containing these fatty acids, but the yeast triglyceride contained less of these fatty acids than were found in the substrate oils. When crambe oil was used as a carbon source for the yeast, fatty acids with 20 or more carbons were concentrated in the residual substrate oil. The yeast incorporated very little of the cholesterol in the growth medium into its depot fats. Oleic-linoleic mixtures in various combinations gave good growth and yielded triglycerides with an extensive range of acyl compositions. Plots of the percentage of oleate and linoleate on the glycerol positions vs. the percentage in the whole yeast triglyceride gave linear relations over most of the range for each acyl group. A simple mathematical model of triglyceride assembly was proposed to explain this observation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Seeds of Momordica charantia (bitter melon) produce {{high levels}} of <b>eleostearic</b> <b>acid,</b> an unusual {{conjugated}} fatty acid with industrial value. Deep sequencing of non-normalized and normalized cDNAs from developing bitter melon seeds was conducted to uncover key genes required for biotechnological transfer of conjugated fatty acid production to existing oilseed crops. It is expected that these studies will also provide basic information regarding the metabolism of other high-value novel fatty acids. Results Deep sequencing using 454 technology with non-normalized and normalized cDNA libraries prepared from bitter melon seeds at 18 DAP resulted {{in the identification of}} transcripts {{for the vast majority of}} known genes involved in fatty acid and triacylglycerol biosynthesis. The non-normalized library provided a transcriptome profile of the early stage in seed development that highlighted the abundance of transcripts for genes encoding seed storage proteins as well as for a number of genes for lipid metabolism-associated polypeptides, including Δ 12 oleic acid desaturases and fatty acid conjugases, class 3 lipases, acyl-carrier protein, and acyl-CoA binding protein. Normalization of cDNA by use of a duplex-specific nuclease method not only increased the overall discovery of genes from developing bitter melon seeds, but also resulted in the identification of 345 contigs with homology to 189 known lipid genes in Arabidopsis. These included candidate genes for <b>eleostearic</b> <b>acid</b> metabolism such as diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 and 2, and a phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 -related enzyme. Transcripts were also identified for a novel FAD 2 gene encoding a functional Δ 12 oleic acid desaturase with potential implications for <b>eleostearic</b> <b>acid</b> biosynthesis. Conclusions 454 deep sequencing, particularly with normalized cDNA populations, was an effective method for mining of genes associated with <b>eleostearic</b> <b>acid</b> metabolism in developing bitter melon seeds. The transcriptomic data presented provide a resource for the study of novel fatty acid metabolism and for the biotechnological production of conjugated fatty acids and possibly other novel fatty acids in established oilseed crops. </p...|$|E
40|$|Seeds of the {{tung tree}} (Vernicia fordii) produce large {{quantities}} of triacylglycerols (TAGs) containing ∼ 80 % <b>eleostearic</b> <b>acid,</b> an unusual conjugated fatty acid. We present a comparative analysis of the genetic, functional, and cellular properties of tung type 1 and type 2 diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGAT 1 and DGAT 2), two unrelated enzymes that catalyze the committed step in TAG biosynthesis. We show that both enzymes are encoded by single genes and that DGAT 1 is expressed at similar levels in various organs, whereas DGAT 2 is strongly induced in developing seeds {{at the onset of}} oil biosynthesis. Expression of DGAT 1 and DGAT 2 in yeast produced different types and proportions of TAGs containing <b>eleostearic</b> <b>acid,</b> with DGAT 2 possessing an enhanced propensity for the synthesis of trieleostearin, the main component of tung oil. Both DGAT 1 and DGAT 2 are located in distinct, dynamic regions of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and surprisingly, these regions do not overlap. Furthermore, although both DGAT 1 and DGAT 2 contain a similar C-terminal pentapeptide ER retrieval motif, this motif alone is not sufficient for their localization to specific regions of the ER. These data suggest that DGAT 1 and DGAT 2 have nonredundant functions in plants and that the production of storage oils, including those containing unusual fatty acids, occurs in distinct ER subdomains...|$|E
40|$|Nucleotide-binding {{domain and}} leucine-rich repeat {{containing}} (NLR) family are intracellular sentinels of cytosolic homeostasis that orchestrate immune and inflammatory responses in infectious and immune-mediated diseases. NLRX 1 is a mitochondrial-associated NOD-like receptor {{involved in the}} modulation of immune and metabolic responses. This study utilizes molecular docking approaches to investigate the structure of NLRX 1 and experimentally assesses binding to naturally occurring compounds from several natural product and lipid databases. Screening of compound libraries predicts targeting of NLRX 1 by conjugated tri-enes, polyketides, prenol lipids, sterol lipids, and coenzyme A-containing fatty acids for acti-vating the NLRX 1 pathway. The ligands of NLRX 1 were identified by docking punicic acid (PUA), <b>eleostearic</b> <b>acid</b> (ESA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) to the C-terminal fragment of the human NLRX 1 (cNLRX 1). Their binding and that of positive control RNA to cNLRX 1 were experimentally determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy. In addition, the ligand binding sites of cNLRX 1 were predicted in silico and validated experi-mentally. Target mutagenesis studies demonstrate that mutation of 4 critical residue...|$|E
40|$|Regardless of the applications: {{therapeutic}} vehicle or membrane {{model to}} mimic complex biological systems; {{it is of}} a great importance to develop simplified, reproducible and rapid model assays allowing for a relevant assessment of the liposomal membrane oxidation and therefore antioxidant activity of selected molecules. Here, we describe a new and high-throughput assay that we called “Vesicle Conjugated Autoxidizable Triene (VesiCAT) ”. It is based on specific UV absorbance spectral properties of a new phospholipid probe, synthesized with natural conjugated <b>eleostearic</b> <b>acid</b> extracted from Tung oil. The VesiCAT assay has been developed with two different radical generators (2, 2 ′-azobis(2 -amidinopropane) dihydrochloride; AAPH and 2, 2 ′-azobis(2, 4 -dimethylvaleronitrile); AMVN), producing a constant flux of oxidant species, either in membrane or in aqueous phase. This method appears very efficient in assessing the effect of various pure antioxidant molecules in their ability to preserve liposomes from oxidative degradation. In addition, the AAPH- and AMVN-induced oxidations offer the possibility of extracting different but complementary information with respect to the antioxidants efficacy. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of biodiesel production from tung oil was investigated. The esterification {{reaction of the}} free fatty acids of tung oil was performed using Amberlyst- 15. Optimal molar ratio of methanol to oil {{was determined to be}} 7. 5 : 1, and Amberlyst- 15 was 20. 8 wt% of oil by response surface methodology. Under these reaction conditions, the acid value of tung oil was reduced to 0. 72 mg KOH/g. In the range of the molar equivalents of methanol to oil under 5, the esterification was strongly affected by the amount of methanol but not the catalyst. When the molar ratio of methanol to oil was 4. 1 : 1 and Amberlyst- 15 was 29. 8 wt% of the oil, the acid value decreased to 0. 85 mg KOH/g. After the transesterification reaction of pretreated tung oil, the purity of tung biodiesel was 90. 2 wt%. The high viscosity of crude tung oil decreased to 9. 8 mm(2) /s at 40 degrees C. Because of the presence of <b>eleostearic</b> <b>acid,</b> which is a main component of tung oil, the oxidation stability as determined by the Rancimat method was very low, 0. 5 h, but the cold filter plugging point, - 11 degrees C, was good.

40|$|AbstractInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a {{debilitating}} and widespread immune-mediated illness characterized by excessive inflammatory and effector mucosal responses leading to tissue destruction at the gastrointestinal tract. Interactions among the immune system, the commensal microbiota {{and the host}} genotype are thought to underlie the pathogenesis of IBD. However, the precise etiology of IBD remains unknown. Diet-induced changes {{in the composition of}} the gut microbiome can modulate the induction of regulatory versus effector immune responses at the gut mucosa and improve health outcomes. Therefore, manipulation of gut microbiota composition and the local production of microbial-derived metabolites by using prebiotics, probiotics and dietary fibers is being explored as a promising avenue of prophylactic and therapeutic intervention against gut inflammation. Prebiotics and fiber carbohydrates are fermented by resident microflora into short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in the colon. SCFAs then activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ, a nuclear transcription factor with widely demonstrated anti-inflammatory efficacy in experimental IBD. The activation of PPARγ by naturally ocurring compounds such as conjugated linoleic acid, pomegranate seed oil-derived punicic acid, <b>eleostearic</b> <b>acid</b> and abscisic acid has been explored as nutritional interventions that suppress colitis by directly modulating the host immune response. The aim of this review is to summarize the status of innovative nutritional interventions against gastrointestinal inflammation, their proposed mechanisms of action, preclinical and clinical efficacy as well as bioinformatics and computational modeling approaches that accelerate discovery in nutritional and mucosal immunology research...|$|E
40|$|The {{seed oil}} {{derived from the}} tung (Aleurites fordii Hemsl.) tree {{contains}} approximately 80 % α-eleostearic acid (18 : 3 Δ 9 cis, 11 trans, 13 trans), an unusual conjugated fatty acid that imparts industrially important drying qualities to tung oil. Here, we describe the cloning and functional analysis of two closely related Δ 12 oleate desaturase-like enzymes that constitute consecutive steps in the biosynthetic pathway of <b>eleostearic</b> <b>acid.</b> Polymerase chain reaction screening of a tung seed cDNA library using degenerate oligonucleotide primers resulted in identification of two desaturases, FAD 2 and FADX, that shared 73 % amino acid identity. Both enzymes were localized to the endoplasmic reticulum of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv Bright-Yellow 2) cells, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction revealed that FADX was expressed exclusively within developing tung seeds. Expression of the cDNAs encoding these enzymes in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) revealed that FAD 2 converted oleic acid (18 : 1 Δ 9 cis) into linoleic acid (18 : 2 Δ 9 cis, 12 cis) and that FADX converted linoleic acid into α-eleostearic acid. Additional characterization revealed that FADX exhibited remarkable enzymatic plasticity, capable of generating a variety of alternative conjugated and Δ 12 -desaturated fatty acid products in yeast cells cultured {{in the presence of}} exogenously supplied fatty acid substrates. Unlike other desaturases reported to date, the double bond introduced by FADX during fatty acid desaturation was in the trans, rather than cis, configuration. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that tung FADX is grouped with Δ 12 fatty acid desaturases and hydroxylases rather than conjugases, which is consistent with its desaturase activity. Comparison of FADX and other lipid-modifying enzymes (desaturase, hydroxylase, epoxygenase, acetylenase, and conjugase) revealed several amino acid positions near the active site that may be important determinants of enzymatic activity...|$|E
