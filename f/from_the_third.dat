5|$|In early human {{embryonic}} life, {{a series of}} five branchial arches and four branchial pouches form {{that give rise to}} the human face, neck, and surrounding structures. The pouches are numbered such that the first pouch is the closest {{to the top of the}} embryo's head and the fourth is the furthest from it. The parathyroid glands originate from the interaction of the endoderm of the third and fourth pouch and neural crest mesenchyme. The position of the glands reverses during embryological life. The pair of glands which is ultimately inferior develops <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>third</b> pouch with the thymus, whereas the pair of glands which is ultimately superior develops from the fourth pouch. During embryological development, the thymus migrates downwards, dragging the inferior glands with it. The superior pair are not dragged downwards by the fourth pouch to the same degree. The glands are named after their final, not embryological, positions. Since the thymus's ultimate destination is in the mediastinum of the chest, it is occasionally possible to have ectopic parathyroids derived <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>third</b> pouch within the chest cavity if they fail to detach in the neck.|$|E
