2500|$|During {{a battle}} with an enemy called the <b>Iron</b> <b>Nail,</b> the Super-Soldier Serum within Rogers's body was neutralized, causing him to age rapidly to match his chronological age of over 90 years. No longer able {{to take part in}} field {{missions}} but retaining his sharp mind, Rogers decided to take on a role as mission coordinator, organizing the Avengers' plans of attack from the mansion, while appointing Sam Wilson as his official [...] "replacement" [...] as Captain America. When various Avengers and X-Men were inverted into villains and several villains inverted into heroism due to a miscast spell by the Scarlet Witch and Doctor Doom, Rogers not only coordinated the efforts of Spider-Man and the inverted villains, now called the [...] "Astonishing Avengers", but also donned his old armor to battle the inverted Falcon, until the heroes and villains could be returned to normal with the aid of the White Skull (the inverted Red Skull).|$|E
60|$|The candle was {{set down}} on the stone flooring, close to the wall, and the two lads started to work without delay. In a corner of his jacket, Dick found an old {{jack-knife}} {{that had not been}} taken away from him, and this he used on the mortar. Sam had nothing but a long, rusty <b>iron</b> <b>nail,</b> so their progress was necessarily slow.|$|E

The daughter went and told Esben, and asked him what she should do. Esben told her to take an <b>iron</b> <b>nail</b> and wrap a piece of skin round it: she could then give her mother this to bite at.|$|E

50|$|Another major {{difference}} {{was the use}} of <b>iron</b> <b>nails</b> versus the use of wood pegs to hold the ship together. Korean ships were held together by interlocking teeth in the wood and wood pegs. The Japanese warships, on the other hand, relied on <b>iron</b> <b>nails</b> which, as time passed and corrosion and rust set in, eventually weakened the hull.|$|R
60|$|She {{then took}} a torch from the {{attendant}} maidens, both of whom seemed to shrink back with fear, which was readily caught by Dame Gillian, although she was not probably aware of the cause. But Rose Flammock, unbidden, followed her mistress without hesitation, as Berwine conducted her through a small wicket at {{the upper end of}} the apartment, clenched with many an <b>iron</b> <b>nail,</b> into a second but smaller anteroom or wardrobe, at the end of which was a similar door. This wardrobe had also its casement mantled with evergreens, and, like the former, it was faintly enlightened by the moonbeams.|$|E
6000|$|Every {{house had}} doors and Venetian windows, painted partly with lamp-black {{made from the}} candle-nut, and partly with red ochre, which contrasted powerfully with the {{dazzling}} coral lime that covered the walls. On a prominent position stood a handsome church, which was quite a curiosity in its way. It was a hundred feet long by fifty broad, and was seated throughout to accommodate upwards of two thousand persons. It had six large folding-doors, and twelve windows with Venetian blinds; and although a large and substantial edifice, it had been built, we were told by the teacher: {{in the space of}} two months! There was not a single <b>iron</b> <b>nail</b> in the fabric, and the natives had constructed it chiefly with their stone and bone axes and other tools, having only one or two axes or tools of European manufacture. Everything around this beautiful spot wore an aspect of peace and plenty; and as we dropped our anchor within a stone's-cast of the substantial coral wharf, I could not avoid contrasting it with the wretched village of Emo, where I had witnessed so many frightful scenes. When the teacher afterwards told me that the people of this tribe had become converts only a year previous to our arrival, and that they had been living before that in the practice of the most bloody system of idolatry, I could not refrain from exclaiming, [...] "What a convincing proof that Christianity is of God!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... [FN#3] I mean a civilised column. [...] "Herse" [...] {{is the old}} {{military}} {{name for}} a column opposed to [...] "Haye," [...] a line. So we read that at far-famed Cressy the French fought en battaille a haye, the English drawn up en herse. This {{appears to have been}} the national predilection of that day. In later times, we and our neighbours changed style, the French preferring heavy columns, the English extending themselves into lines. [FN#4] The Albanians, delighting in the noise of musketry, notch the ball {{in order to make it}} sing the louder. When fighting, they often adopt the excellent plan-excellent, when rifles are not procurable-of driving a long <b>iron</b> <b>nail</b> through the bullet, and fixing its head into the cartridge. Thus the cartridge is strengthened, the bullet is rifled, and the wound which it inflicts is death. Round balls are apt to pass into and out of savages without killing them, and many an Afghan, after being shot or run through the body, has mortally wounded his English adversary before falling. It is false philanthropy, also, to suppose that in battle, especially when a campaign is commencing, it is sufficient to maim, not to kill, the enemy. Nothing encourages men to fight so much, as a good chance of escaping with a wound-especially a flesh wound. I venture to hope that the reader will not charge these sentiments with cruelty. He who renders warfare fatal to all engaged in it will be the greatest benefactor the world has yet known. [FN#5] The late Captain Nolan. [FN#6] The first symptom of improvement will be a general training to the Bayonet exercise. The British is, and for years has been, the only army in Europe that does not learn the use of this weapon: how long does it intend to be the sole authority on the side of ignorance? We laughed at the Calabrese levies, who in the French war threw away their muskets and drew their stilettos; and we cannot understand why the Indian would always prefer a sabre to a rifle. Yet we read without disgust of our men being compelled, by want of proper training, to [...] "club their muskets" [...] in hand-to-hand fights,-when they have in the bayonet the most formidable of offensive weapons,-and of the Kafirs and other savages wresting the piece, after drawing off its fire, from its unhappy possessor's grasp. [FN#7] I began to treat it hydropathically with a cooling bandage, but my companions declared that the water was poisoning the wound, and truly it seemed to get worse every day. This idea is prevalent throughout Al-Hijaz; even the Badawin, after once washing a cut or a sore, never allow air or water to touch it. [FN#8] Hawamid is the plural of Hamidah, Shaykh Sa'ad's tribe. [FN#9] Shuab properly means a path through mountains, or a watercourse between hills. It is generally used in Arabia for a [...] "Valley," [...] and sometimes instead of Nakb, or the Turkish Bughaz, a [...] "Pass." [...] [FN#10] Others attribute these graves to the Beni Salim, or Salmah, an extinct race of Hijazi Badawin. Near Shuhada is Jabal Warkan, one of the mountains of Paradise, also called Irk al-Zabyat, or Thread of the Winding Torrent. The Prophet named it [...] "Hamt," [...] (sultriness), when he passed through it on his way to the Battle of Badr. He also called the valley [...] "Sajasaj," [...] (plural of Sajsaj, a temperate situation), declared it was a valley of heaven, that 70 prophets had prayed there before himself, that Moses with 70,000 Israelites had traversed it on his way to Meccah, and that, before the Resurrection day, Isa bin Maryam should pass through it with the intention of performing the Greater and the Lesser Pilgrimages. Such are the past and such the future honours of the place. [FN#11] The Indians sink wells in Arabia for the same reason which impels them to dig tanks at home,-"nam ke waste,"-"for the purpose of name"; thereby denoting, together with a laudable desire for posthumous fame, a notable lack of ingenuity in securing it. For it generally happens that before the third generation has fallen, the well and the tank have either lost their original names, or have exchanged them for others newer and better known. [FN#12] Suwaykah derives its name from the circumstance that in the second, or third, year of the Hijrah (Hegira), Mohammed here attacked Abu Sufiyan, who was out on a foray with 200 men. The Infidels, in their headlong fight, lightened their beasts by emptying their bags of [...] "Sawik." [...] This is the old and modern Arabic name for a dish of green grain, toasted, pounded, mixed with dates or sugar, and eaten on journeys when it is found difficult to cook. Such is the present signification of the word: M.C. de Perceval (vol. iii., p. 84) gives it a different and a now unknown meaning. And our popular authors erroneously call the affair the [...] "War of the Meal-sacks." [...] [FN#13] A popular but not a bad pun-"Harb" [...] (Fight), becomes, by the alteration of the H, [...] "Harb" [...] (Flight). [FN#14] The old Arabic proverb is [...] "A greater wiseacre than the goat of Akhfash"; it is seldom intelligible to the vulgar. [FN#15] That is to say, [...] "I will burn them (metaphorically) as the fiery wick consumes the oil,"-a most idiomatic Hijazi threat. [FN#16] A [...] "cold-of-countenance" [...] is a fool. Arabs use the word [...] "cold" [...] in a peculiar way. [...] "May Allah refrigerate thy countenance!" [...] i.e. may it show misery and want. [...] "By Allah, a cold speech!" [...] that is to say, a silly or an abusive tirade. [FN#17] That is to say, they would use, if necessary, the dearest and noblest parts of their bodies (their eyes) to do the duty of the basest (i.e. their feet). [FN#18] Writers mention two Al-Akik. The superior comprises the whole site of Al-Madinah, extending from the Western Ridge, mentioned below, to the cemetery Al-Bakia. The inferior is the Fiumara here alluded to; it is on the Meccan road, about four miles S.W. of Al-Madinah, and its waters fall into the Al-Hamra torrent. It is called the [...] "Blessed Valley" [...] because the Prophet was ordered by an angel to pray in it. [FN#19] The esoteric meaning of this couplet is, [...] "Man! this is a lovely portion of God's creation: then stand by it, and here learn to love the perfections of thy Supreme Friend." [...] [FN#20] Al-Harratayn for Al-Harratani, the oblique case of the dual and plural noun being universally used for the nominative in colloquial Arabic. The other one of the Two Ridges will be described in a future part of this Book. [FN#21] The city is first seen from the top of the valley called Nakb, or Shuab Ali, close to the Wady al-Akik, a long narrow pass, about five miles from Al-Madinah. Here, according to some, was the Mosque Zu'l Halifah, where the Prophet put on the Pilgrim's garb when travelling to Meccah. It is also called [...] "The Mosque of the Tree," [...] because near it grew a fruit tree under which the Prophet twice sat. Ibn Jubayr considers that the Harim (or sacred precincts of Al-Madinah) is the space enclosed by three points, Zu'l Halifah, Mount Ohod, and the Mosque of Kuba. To the present day pilgrims doff their worldly garments at Zu'l Halifah. [FN#22] That is to say, [...] "throughout all ages and all nations." [...] The Arabs divide the world into two great bodies: first themselves, and, secondly, [...] "'Ajami," [...] i.e. all that are not Arabs. Similar bi-partitions are the Hindus and Mlenchhas, the Jews and Gentiles, the Greeks and Barbarians, &c., &c. [FN#23] Robust religious men, especially those belonging to the school of Al-Malik, enter into Al-Madinah, after the example of Ali, on foot, reverently, as the pilgrims approach Meccah. [FN#24] Barbosa makes three days' journey from Yambu' to Al-Madinah, D'Herbelot eight, and Ovington six. The usual time is from four to five days. A fertile source of error to home geographers, computing distances in Arabia, is their neglecting the difference between the slow camel travelling and the fast dromedary riding.

In the absence of k iron values, no scientific discussion on the right Fe 0 amount can be performed. This is arguably the main reason why published results are highly qualitative in nature. As an example, the community-scale Fe 0 arsenic filter developed at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB filter) uses commercial <b>iron</b> <b>nails</b> of unknown k iron values (Chaudhari et al. 2014).
