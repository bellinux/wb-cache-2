Primary and secondary windings are located on a stator and supplied from two power sources with close frequencies. In a winding less tooth rotor each tooth determines a pair of poles of the motor.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the cyclic fatigue resistance of used nickel-titanium rotary instruments, clinically operated by a traditional <b>high-torque</b> <b>motor</b> and a new low-torque electric motor. Fifty instruments (ProFile, Maillefer, Baillagues, Switzerland) {{for each of the}} following sizes were used:. 06 - 25,. 06 - 20, and. 04 - 25. They were divided into three groups: A = 10 new instruments (control), B = 20 used instruments operated by a <b>high-torque</b> <b>motor,</b> and C = 20 used instruments operated by a low-torque motor. Each instrument was used in 10 clinical cases (at least six molars). Cyclic fatigue testing of new and used instruments was performed with a device that allowed the instruments to rotate freely inside a stainless-steel artificial canal at 350 rpm. Data were recorded and statistically analyzed. Mean (and SD) numbers of rotation-to-breakage cycles for. 06 - 25,. 06 - 20, and. 04 - 25 instruments were, respectively: group A 463 (85), 535 (101), and 613 (105); group B 229 (64), 343 (92), and 233 (84); and group C 352 (77), 454 (89), and 466 (86). Results showed that group A instruments exhibited significantly higher values of rotation-to-breakage cycles (two-sample t test, p < 0. 01), when compared with groups B and C, respectively. Statistically higher resistance to cyclic fatigue was noted for group C in all sizes compared with group B (two-sample t test, p < 0. 01), showing that the use of endodontic motor with lower torque values reduced cyclic fatigue of nickel-titanium rotary instruments...|$|E

Often a gear reduction {{is incorporated in}} order to be able to use a larger more efficient propeller. This can be a traditional gear box, coaxial planetary gears or a transmission with belts or chains.

In this paper, a magnetic-geared PM brushless motor is presented. It is a novel low-speed and <b>high-torque</b> <b>motor</b> which merges the advantages of conventional PM brushless motor and PM gear. Its topology and operation principle are introduced.

40|$|Fracture of nickel-titanium {{rotary files}} is an {{iatrogenic}} error which can seriously jeopardize root canal therapy. If a <b>high-torque</b> <b>motor</b> is used, the instrument-specific limit-torque (fracture limit) is often exceeded, thus increasing {{the risk of}} intracanal failure. A possible {{solution to this problem}} is to use a low-torque endodontic motor which operates below these values. If the torque is set just below the limit of elasticity for each instrument, the risk of fracture is likely to be markedly reduced. The purpose of this paper was to discuss mechanical properties of NiTi rotary instruments, the rationale for selecting low torque values, and to use clinically a new endodontic motor (step-motor) which operates below the limit of elasticity of each rotary file. The step-motor was found to be helpful in reducing the risk of instrument fracture. Irreversible material damage (plastic deformation) and instrument fracture were rarely seen. Low-torque instrumentation also increased tactile sense and, consequently, mental awareness of rotary instrumentation...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{feasibility}} and {{potential benefits of}} high frequency alternating current (HFAC) for vehicle auxiliary electrical systems. A 100 Vrms, 50 kHz sinusoidal AC bus is compared with 14 V DC and 42 V DC electrical systems in terms of mass and energy efficiency. The investigation {{is focused on the}} four main sub-systems of an on-board electrical network, namely: the power generation, power distribution, power conversion and the electrical loads. In addition, a systemlevel inquiry is conducted for the HFAC bus and a comparable 42 V DC system. A combination of computer simulation, analytical analysis and experimental work has highlighted benefits for the HFAC power distribution sub-system and for low-torque motor actuators. Specifically, the HFAC conductor mass is potentially 70 % and 30 % lighter than comparable 14 V DC and 42 V DC cables, respectively. Also, the proposed cable is expected to be at least 80 % more energy efficient than the current DC conductor technology. In addition, it was found that 400 Hz AC machines can successfully replace DC motor actuators with a rated torque of up to 2 Nm. The former are up to 100 % more efficient and approximately 60 % lighter and more compact than the existing DC motors in vehicles. However, it is argued that the HFAC supply is not feasible for <b>high-torque</b> <b>motor</b> actuators. This is because of the high energy losses and increased machine torque ripple {{associated with the use of}} HFAC power. The HFAC power conversion sub-system offers benefits in terms of simple power converter structure and efficient HFAC/DC converters. However, a significant limitation is the high power loss within HFAC/AC modules, which can be as high as 900 W for a 2. 4 kW load with continuous operation. Similar restrictions are highlighted for the HFAC power generation sub-system, where up to 400 W is lost in a 4 kW DC/HFAC power module. The conclusion of the present work is that the HFAC system offers mass and energy efficiency benefits for the conventional vehicle by leveraging the use of compact lowtorque motor actuators and lightweight wiring technology.

A robot may fall down if the operator lacks adequate skill even if it is a traversable step. In addition, the difference between the traveling sequences of active and passive sub-crawlers lies {{in the manner in which}} the rear sub-crawlers are utilized. Passive sub-crawlers can only rotate using gravity; consequently, no downward power to lift the robot body is generated. Adopting passive sub-crawlers has many advantages. It can reduce the number of <b>high-torque</b> <b>motors,</b> reduce the robot weight, and save energy.

40|$|Although it {{is known}} that diverse {{bacterial}} flagellar motors produce different torques, the mechanism underlying torque variation is unknown. To understand this difference better, we combined genetic analyses with electron cryo-tomography subtomogram averaging to determine in situ structures of flagellar motors that produce different torques, from Campylobacter and Vibrio species. For the first time, to our knowledge, our results unambiguously locate the torque-generating stator complexes and show that diverse <b>high-torque</b> <b>motors</b> use variants of an ancestrally related family of structures to scaffold incorporation of additional stator complexes at wider radii from the axial driveshaft than in the model enteric motor. We identify the protein components of these additional scaffold structures and elucidate their sequential assembly, demonstrating that they are required for stator-complex incorporation. These proteins are widespread, suggesting that different bacteria have tailored torques to specific environments by scaffolding alternative stator placement and number. Our results quantitatively account for different motor torques, complete the assignment of the locations of the major flagellar components, and provide crucial constraints for understanding mechanisms of torque generation and the evolution of multiprotein complexes...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{evolution}} of molecular machines underpins {{our understanding of the}} development of life on earth. A well-studied case are bacterial flagellar motors that spin helical propellers for bacterial motility. Diverse motors produce different torques, but how this diversity evolved remains unknown. To gain insights into evolution of the <b>high-torque</b> ε-proteobacterial <b>motor</b> exemplified by the Campylobacter jejuni motor, we inferred ancestral states by combining phylogenetics, electron cryotomography, and motility assays to characterize motors from Wolinella succinogenes, Arcobacter butzleri and Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus. Observation of ~ 12 stator complexes in many proteobacteria, yet ~ 17 in ε-proteobacteria suggest a “quantum leap” evolutionary event. Campylobacter-type motors have high stator occupancy in wider rings of additional stator complexes that are scaffolded by large proteinaceous periplasmic rings. We propose a model for motor evolution wherein independent inner- and outer-membrane structures fused to form a scaffold for additional stator complexes. Significantly, inner- and outer-membrane associated structures have evolved independently multiple times, suggesting that evolution of such structures is facile and poised the ε-proteobacteria to fuse them to form the <b>high-torque</b> Campylobacter-type <b>motor...</b>|$|R

40|$|As {{a part of}} the Acquisition and Guidance Unit for the Gemini {{project a}} light-weight, 50 cm flat mirror has been {{designed}} at the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Optics and Precision Mechanics in Jena as a subcontractor of the Carl Zeiss Jena company. A light-weight design of the mirror and its mount was essential since the total mass of the whole assembly including the positioning system was limited to 50 kg while interferometric quality of the mirror surface was required for arbitrary orientation. The overall surface error was below 54 nm r. m. s. while 27 nm was achieved in the central part. The mirror was fabricated from low-expansion glass ceramics to avoid thermally induced deformations. By milling pockets into its rear surface the mass of the mirror was reduced by 70 %. The mirror is mounted kinematically via six solid-state hinges to three steel levers. The levers are connected to the mount frame at their centers via ball-and-sphere joints. This arrangement determines the position of the mirror uniquely while it allows for the thermal expansion of the mount frame. The position of the mirror as well as its tilt around an axis perpendicular to the optical one may be controlled a precision of 20 µm and 3 arcsec, respectively. The tilt axis is driven directly by two <b>high-torque</b> <b>motors.</b> To avoid an excessive power consumption of the motors the torque of the mirror had to be compensated for by a counterweight mechanism.

40|$|Wheelchair-bound {{individuals}} who have limited or no upper-limb usage have difficulty with picking and placing of objects, opening doors, and other {{activities of daily living}} (ADLs), such as turning on a light switch or drinking from a cup. A wheelchair-mounted robot arm (WMRA) would aid individuals with completing ADLs and increase their independence, therefore an improved WMRA has been designed. Building upon previous WMRA research and incorporating research from industrial robot arms, carbon fiber tubing is the main component for the structure of the arm, a novel development for WMRAs. Factors that go into WMRA design include weight, speed, safety, robustness, cost, and the anticipated tasks. Many of these factors, such as weight, speed, and cost, can be improved upon compared to previous WMRAs by using carbon fiber materials. The use of carbon fiber enables the arm to be strong, but also lighter weight than other WMRAs. Testing was conducted on the pultruded carbon fiber tubing to ensure that the structure of the arm could withstand the necessary bending and tensile forces for the arm to hold up to 3. 85 kg, the standard weight of a gallon of milk, at the end effector. The arm 2 ̆ 7 s carbon fiber frame also allows the motor and sensor wiring to run internally, which improves the arm 2 ̆ 7 s safety and aesthetics, while protecting it from the arm 2 ̆ 7 s external environment.

40|$|Abstract. Up to {{now most}} of the efforts for {{developing}} HTS technology have been directed to devices for grid applications. However, HTS synchronous machines as motors and generators {{become more and more}} interesting within the world-wide development programs. Replacing the copper winding of the rotor by an HTS one and introducing an iron-less air-core stator winding the very compact HTS machine has less than half the weight and volume, higher efficiency and an excellent operational behavior when compared to the conventional devices. These features make HTS rotating machines very attractive for e. g. ship drives and industrial applications for the processing industry and power generation in power plants and wind parks.

40|$|Lowering {{the gear}} {{reduction}} in actuators by utilizing <b>high-torque</b> low-speed <b>motors</b> enables {{the use of}} less expensive and simpler gear systems and decreases the overall system inertia. Variable reluctance machines can produce high torque at low speeds. Their static torque, a critical quantity for determination of low speed operation, is colnpared for three variable reluctance motor design variations using linear analysis. Saturation effects, which are crucial to the accurate determination of static torque, are modeled using a dual energy technique first proposed by Lord Rayleigh. Dual energy techniques utilizing flux tubes and magnetomotive force slices are developed into a numerical method for predicting nonlinear three-dimensional magnetostatic field parameters. The dual energy method offers a compromise between the accurate but laborious finite element method and the speed of simplified lumped parameter magnetic circuit calculations. A two-dimensional dual energy model of a variable reluctance motor is developed. Results of calculations on a 4 kW Oulton machine are compared to measurements and other calculation methods.

50|$|A <b>high-torque,</b> {{insulated}} electric <b>motor,</b> usually {{rated at}} 250-750 W (⅓ to 1 horsepower) for a domestic unit, spins a circular turntable mounted horizontally above it. Induction motors rotate at 1,400-1,800 rpm {{and have a}} range of starting torques, depending on the method of starting used. The added weight and size of induction motors may be of concern, depending on the available installation space and construction of the sink bowl. Universal motors rotate at higher speeds (about 2,800 rpm), have high starting torque, and are usually lighter, but are noisier than induction motors, partially due to the higher speeds and partially because the commutator brushes rub on the slotted commutator. Contaminated water leaking on to the commutator can lead to major damage, which is why most garbage disposals today use induction motors. The higher starting torque of those appliances with a permanent magnet motor ensures in most cases {{that there will be no}} blockage.|$|R
50|$|Gearless {{traction}} {{machines are}} low-speed (low-RPM), <b>high-torque</b> electric <b>motors</b> powered either by AC or DC. In this case, the drive sheave is directly {{attached to the}} end of the motor. Gearless traction elevators can reach speeds of up to 4000 ft/min m/s, A brake is mounted between the motor and gearbox or between the motor and drive sheave or at the end of the drive sheave to hold the elevator stationary at a floor. This brake is usually an external drum type and is actuated by spring force and held open electrically; a power failure will cause the brake to engage and prevent the elevator from falling (see inherent safety and safety engineering). But it can also be some form of disc type like 1 or more calipers over a disc in one end of the motor shaft or drive sheave which is used in high speed, high rise and large capacity elevators with machine rooms(an exception is the Kone MonoSpace's EcoDisc which is not high speed, high rise and large capacity and is machine room less but it uses the same design as is a thinner version of a conventional gearless traction machine) for braking power, compactness and redundancy (assuming there's at least 2 calipers on the disc), or 1 or more disc brakes with a single caliper at one end of the motor shaft or drive sheave which is used in machine room less elevators for compactness, braking power, and redundancy (assuming there's 2 brakes or more).|$|R
40|$|The Biomimetic Robotics Group is {{attempting}} to build the fastest quadruped robot powered by electromagnetic means. The limitations in achieving this goal are the torque produced from motors used to power the robot, {{as well as the}} mass and power dissipation of these motors. These limitations formulate the need for a lowmass <b>high-torque</b> low-loss <b>motor.</b> This thesis outlines the process of designing a permanent-magnet synchronous motor that meet the goals of the robot while minimizing the total mass. The motor designed from this thesis is compared to motors currently used by the Group when quantifying improvements made. In the process of achieving the goal, a design was formulated using fundamental electromagnetic principles. This design was then tested using finite element analysis. The final design was fabricated in house and wired by hand. The fabricated motor was tested to quantify key performance parameters such as peak cogging torque, peak motor torque, and thermal time constant under robot conditions. The motor designed by this thesis was able to produce more torque than the current motor being used by the Biomimetic Robotics Group, by a factor of 1. 6, while decreasing the mass by 23 %. A lower than desired packing factor was achieved since the motor was wired by hand resulting in a higher power dissipation and lower than expected motor torque. This design will be used in the quadroped robot after improvements are made to the cogging torque and packing factor. by Niaja Nichole Farve. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a framework to automate {{the process of}} designing Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) powertrain architectures. An algorithm was developed to assemble and compare all possible configurations of powertrain components. Combinatorics was used to discover all possible combinations of: an internal combustion engine, <b>high-torque</b> low-speed electric <b>motor,</b> low-torque high-speed electric motor, planetary gearset, and five-speed discrete gearbox. The Graph Theoretic Method was used to generate the powertrain models. The powertrain models were comprised of steady-state equations in symbolic form. An optimal control strategy is required to fairly compare the different topologies because a powertrain control strategy is dependant on the configuration. Dynamic Programming {{was used to determine}} the control law that minimizes the energy consumption for a given drivecycle. Evaluating every possible topology would take an extremely long time, so topologies were evaluated using a multi-stage screening process. The first stage examined the structure of the powertrain and used heuristics to eliminate infeasible topologies; 512 topologies were feasible. The second stage eliminated topologies that could not meet basic driving performance; 193 topologies were feasible. Basic driving performance was tested using a section of the US 06 drivecycle. The sizes of three components were optimized to ensure the topology is feasible independent {{of the size of the}} components. The third stage eliminated topologies which could not achieve driving performance design goals; 159 could achieve the performance requirements, but only 119 were reasonably fuel efficient. The driving performance goals were implemented with a drivecycle based on the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV) goals. The sizes for five components were optimized at this stage. The 20 most fuel efficient powertrains were selected for further evaluation. Additionally, 4 common powertrains were evaluated for reference. The size of the components were optimized for a combination of the PNGV drivecycle and the HWFET drivecycle. The most fuel efficient topology was found to be a Powersplit hybrid which has a discrete gearbox between the final drive and the powersplit device. The electric motor, planetary carrier gear, and gearbox were connected in parallel. It was found that Parallel-like, Powersplit-like, and Complex-like topologies were were the most efficient powertrain configurations. Powertrains containing two gearboxes were more efficient because the geartrain models ignored mechanical inefficiencies...|$|R
