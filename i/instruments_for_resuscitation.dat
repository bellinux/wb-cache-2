5000|$|A {{crash cart}} or code cart (crash trolley in UK medical jargon) or [...] "MAX cart" [...] {{is a set}} of trays/drawers/shelves on wheels used in {{hospitals}} for transportation and dispensing of emergency medication/equipment at site of medical/surgical emergency for life support protocols (ACLS/ALS) to potentially save someone's life. The cart carries <b>instruments</b> <b>for</b> cardiopulmonary <b>resuscitation</b> and other medical supplies while also functioning as a support litter for the patient.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Joel J. Nobel founded ECRI Institute [...] after a four-year-old boy {{died in his}} arms from a {{defibrillator}} failing to work. He focused his energy on improving resuscitation technology and organization, which led to ECRI Institute being founded. Joel also invented the MAX Cart, a mobile resuscitation system designed to save lives by enabling rapid medical action. The cart carries <b>instruments</b> <b>for</b> cardiopulmonary <b>resuscitation</b> and other medical supplies while also functioning as a support litter for a patient. A prototype of the MAX medical emergency crash cart has been accepted into the permanent collection of the Smithsonian National Museum of American History, Medicine and Science Division, {{as part of its}} historical collection of cardiology and emergency-medicine objects. Nobel, a surgeon and inventor, designed and patented MAX in 1965 while a resident at Pennsylvania Hospital, in order to speed the delivery of emergency cardiopulmonary care to patients. Life magazine profiled the invention in a 1966 feature called [...] "MAX, the Lifesaver." [...] In 2001, Dr. Jeffrey C. Lerner became ECRI Institute’s second President and Chief Executive Officer.|$|R

40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} {{performed}} {{to determine the effect}} of antenatal corticosteroid the interval between administration and delivery affect on neonatal outcomes. Material and Methods: An observational study was performed on all deliveries between 28 - 34 weeks gestation where delivery occurred vaginally after completing a single course of antenatal corticosteroid (dexamethasone). Women were divided into 3 groups {{on the basis of the}} interval from first corticosteroid dose to delivery (7 days). The primary outcome was the need <b>for</b> neonatal <b>resuscitation</b> and the secondary outcome was respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), which was described as “need for ventilation with positive pressure O 2 during the first 24 hrs of life”. P value < 0. 05 was significant. Results: Of 104 neonates whose mothers received a full course of antenatal corticosteroid, 29 delivered < 2 days, 41 delivered 2 - 7 days, and 34 delivered more than 7 days after the initial dose. Overall, those delivering within 2 days after the first injection of corticosteroid had more need <b>for</b> <b>resuscitation</b> and ventilation than those infants delivering between 2 - 7 days and after 7 days. Infants delivering between 2 - 7 days had a lower incidence of need <b>for</b> <b>resuscitation</b> and receiving respiratory support for more than 24 hours. Conclusion: We found that the interval between corticosteroid administration and delivery influences the incidence of need <b>for</b> <b>resuscitation</b> and ventilation. Infants delivering less than 2 days of corticosteroid exposure have a higher frequency of need <b>for</b> <b>resuscitation</b> and ventilation than delivering between 2 - 7 days and after 7 days...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{task force}} on Acute Circulatory Failure of the Scandinavian Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine {{produced}} this guideline with recommendations concerning the use of crystalloid vs. colloid solutions in adult critically ill patients with acute circulatory failure. METHODS: Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to grade the quality of evidence and to determine {{the strengths of the}} recommendations. As efficacy and harm may vary in different subpopulations of patients with acute circulatory failure, we produced recommendations for general intensive care unit (ICU) patients and those with sepsis, trauma and burn injury. RESULTS: For general ICU patients and those with sepsis, we recommend using crystalloids <b>for</b> <b>resuscitation</b> rather than hydroxyethyl starch and we suggest using crystalloids rather than gelatin and albumin. For patients with trauma we recommend to use crystalloids <b>for</b> <b>resuscitation</b> rather than colloid solutions. For patients with burn injury we provide no recommendations as there are very limited data from randomised trials on fluid resuscitation in this patient population. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend using crystalloid solutions rather than colloid solutions <b>for</b> <b>resuscitation</b> in the majority of critically ill patients with acute circulatory failure...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{evaluate}} the local use of written "Do not resuscitate" orders to designate inpatients unsuitable <b>for</b> cardiopulmonary <b>resuscitation</b> {{in the event}} of cardiac arrest. DESIGN [...] Point prevalence questionnaire survey of inpatients' medical and nursing records. SETTING [...] 10 acute medical and six acute surgical wards of a district general hospital. PARTICIPANTS [...] Questionnaires were filled in anonymously by nurses and doctors working on the wards surveyed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Responses to questionnaire items concerning details about each patient, written orders not to resuscitate in the medical case notes and nursing records, whether prognosis had been discussed with patients' relatives, whether a "crash call" was perceived as appropriate for each patient, and whether the "crash team" would be called {{in the event of}} arrest. RESULTS [...] Information was obtained on 297 (93. 7 %) of 317 eligible patients. Prognosis had been discussed with the relatives of 32 of 88 patients perceived by doctors as unsuitable <b>for</b> <b>resuscitation.</b> Of these 88 patients, 24 had orders not to resuscitate in their medical notes, and only eight of these had similar orders in their nursing notes. CONCLUSIONS [...] In the absence of guidelines on decisions about resuscitation, orders not to resuscitate are rarely included in the notes of patients <b>for</b> whom cardiopulmonary <b>resuscitation</b> is thought to be inappropriate. Elective decisions not to resuscitate are not effectively communicated to nurses. There should be more discussion of patients' suitability <b>for</b> <b>resuscitation</b> between doctors, nurses, patients, and patients' relatives. Suitability <b>for</b> <b>resuscitation</b> should be reviewed on every consultant ward round...|$|R
40|$|Small-volume {{resuscitation}} of {{critically ill}} patients with hyperoncotic albumin offers {{a number of}} theoretical advantages, such as increasing intravascular volume {{in excess of the}} volume of fluid administered and reducing interstitial edema. Whilst iso-oncotic albumin {{has been shown to be}} equi-effective to isotonic saline <b>for</b> the <b>resuscitation</b> of critically ill patients without associated traumatic brain injury, the efficacy of hyperoncotic albumin <b>for</b> <b>resuscitation</b> has not been evaluated in large-scale randomized-controlled trials. Overall, the evidence <b>for</b> <b>resuscitation</b> with hyper-oncotic albumin is limited by studies of poor methodological quality with heterogenous study populations and control regimens. There is marginal qualitative evidence of improvements in surrogate outcomes in disparate patient populations, but no evidence of any survival benefit associated with resuscitation with hyperoncotic albumin. Given the lack of evidence and clinical uncertainty about the efficacy of hyperoncotic albumin, a large-scale randomized-controlled trial is required to determine its role in the acute resuscitation of hypovolemic or hypoalbuminemic critically ill patients...|$|R

40|$|Background: over 60 % {{of older}} people {{have at least one}} {{admission}} to hospital in their last year of life, with the majority of people having multiple admissions. In Bankstown, New South Wales, Australia, we have a diverse ethnic and cultural population. We were interested in bed utilisation, documentation, and follow through of 'care plans' as well as 'not for resuscitation' orders {{in the last year of}} life of the older people in our area. Methods: we reviewed and collected data from the medical records of patients over 65 years of age who died in our hospital. Reviewers included a medical registrar, a research officer and two geriatricians. We collected a wide range of information pertaining to the 12 [*]months before death. This included demographics, chronic illnesses, geriatric syndromes, number of admissions, bed days, care plans, and not <b>for</b> <b>resuscitation</b> orders as well as other relevant data. Results:  110 patients' records were reviewed. The mean age was 80 years and 31 % were from a non English‐speaking background. The average number of admissions was 2. 4 and the average number of bed days in the last year of life was 25. Sixty‐one of the patients had a care plan and a not <b>for</b> <b>resuscitation</b> order, 91 % of which were written shortly before death. Using bi‐variate analysis of old age (over 80), number of chronic illnesses, or geriatric syndromes present, the number of bed days was positively correlated to care plan and not <b>for</b> <b>resuscitation</b> orders. Logistic multivariate analysis of chronic illnesses revealed that stroke (P= 0. 024) as well as stroke and fracture (P= 0. 008) were strongly correlated with care plan and not <b>for</b> <b>resuscitation</b> orders. Only 8 patients had an advanced care plan documented prior to last admission. When advanced care plans were documented, they were generally clearly written and followed through appropriately (7 out of 8). Conclusion: this study showed that in our diverse population there were multiple admissions and utilisation of hospital beds for older people in their last year of life. Care plans and not <b>for</b> <b>resuscitation</b> orders were rarely documented prior to last admission. However, when advanced care plans were done, they were usually well documented and followed through appropriately. 5 page(s...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate whether the use of albumin-containing fluids <b>for</b> <b>resuscitation</b> in patients with sepsis was associated with a decreased mortality rate. We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane library for eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) up to March 2014. The selection of eligible studies, assessment of methodological quality, and extraction of all relevant data were conducted by two authors independently. In total, 15 RCTs were eligible for analysis. After pooling the data, we found there was no significant effect of albumin-containing fluids on mortality in patients with sepsis of any severity (RR: 0. 94, 95 % CI: 0. 87, 1. 02 and RD: - 0. 01, 95 % CI: - 0. 03, 0. 01). The results were robust to subgroup analyses, sensitivity analyses and trial sequential analyses. The present meta-analysis did not demonstrate significant advantage of using albumin-containing fluids <b>for</b> <b>resuscitation</b> in patients with sepsis of any severity.
