25|$|<b>Inkjet</b> {{printers}} are a type {{of computer}} printer that operates by propelling tiny droplets of liquid ink onto paper.|$|E
25|$|Stepper motors {{were and}} still are often used in {{computer}} printers, optical scanners, and digital photocopiers to move the optical scanning element, the print head carriage (of dot matrix and <b>inkjet</b> printers), and the platen or feed rollers. Likewise, many computer plotters (which since the early 1990s have been replaced with large-format <b>inkjet</b> and laser printers) used rotary stepper motors for pen and platen movement; the typical alternatives here were either linear stepper motors or servomotors with closed-loop analog control systems.|$|E

40|$|Abstract-This paper {{reports on}} {{formation}} of high aspect micro patterns on low temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) substrates by integrating micro <b>inkjetting</b> with electroless plating. Micro <b>inkjetting</b> was realized {{by using an}} <b>inkjetting</b> printer that ejects ink droplets from a printhead. This printhead consists of a glass nozzle with a diameter of 50 µm and a piezoelectric transducer that is coated on the nozzle. The silver colloidal solution was <b>inkjetted</b> on a sintered CT 800 ceramic substrate, followed by curing at 200 °C for 60 minutes. As a result, the silver trace with a thickness of 200 nm was obtained. The substrate, with the ejected silver thin film as the seed layer, was then immersed into a preinitiator solution to coat a layer of palladium for enhancing the deposition of nickel. Electroless nickel plating was successfully conducted {{at a rate of}} 0. 39 µm /min, and the thickness of traces was plated up to 84 µm.

25|$|Like ink jet {{material}} depositioning, <b>inkjet</b> etching (IJE) deposits precise {{amounts of}} solvent onto a substrate designed to selectively dissolve {{the substrate material}} and induce a structure or pattern. <b>Inkjet</b> etching of polymer layers in OLED's {{can be used to}} increase the overall out-coupling efficiency. In OLEDs, light produced from the emissive layers of the OLED is partially transmitted out of the device and partially trapped inside the device by total internal reflection (TIR). This trapped light is wave-guided along the interior of the device until it reaches an edge where it is dissipated by either absorption or emission. <b>Inkjet</b> etching can be used to selectively alter the polymeric layers of OLED structures to decrease overall TIR and increase out-coupling efficiency of the OLED. Compared to a non-etched polymer layer, the structured polymer layer in the OLED structure from the IJE process helps to decrease the TIR of the OLED device. IJE solvents are commonly organic instead of water based due to their non-acidic nature and ability to effectively dissolve materials at temperatures under the boiling point of water.|$|E

Because living cells are easily damaged by heat and mechanical stress [5], the biocompatibility of the dispensing system must be assessed by evaluating the effect of the dispensing process on cell viability and proliferation. Living cells have been dispensed using various printing systems such as thermal <b>inkjets</b> [11], piezoelectric <b>inkjets</b> [12 – 15], electrostatics [5], lasers [18], and electrohydrodynamic jets [19].|$|R

25|$|Vendors {{typically}} {{stress the}} total cost to operate the equipment, involving complex calculations that include all cost factors involved in the operation {{as well as the}} capital equipment costs, amortization, etc. For the most part, toner systems are more economical than <b>inkjet</b> in the long run, even though inkjets are less expensive in the initial purchase price.|$|E
25|$|Zhuhai {{manufactured}} and supplied 70% of the world's ribbons, 60% of the world's aftermarket <b>inkjet</b> cartridges and 20% of the world's third-party laser toner cartridges.

50|$|In {{comparison}} to technologies like thermal wax, dye sublimation, and laser printing, <b>inkjets</b> {{have the advantage}} of practically no warm up time, and often lower cost per page.

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been {{tremendous}} interest in all-printed electronics {{as a means of}} achieving ultra-low-cost electronic circuits with uses in displays and disposable electronics applications such as RFID tags. While {{there have been a few}} demonstrations of printed organic transistors to date, {{there has been}} little work on the associated passive component and interconnection technologies required to enable the development of all-printed RFID circuits. In particular, low-resistance conductors are crucial to achieve the high-Q inductors necessary for RFID. Here, we demonstrate <b>inkjetted</b> nanoparticle-Au conductors on plastic with sheet resistances as low as 0. 03 ohms/square. We describe the optimization of the jetting parameters, and their impact on final film morphology and electrical properties. We also demonstrate a bridging technology based on an <b>inkjetted</b> polyimide interlevel dielectric. Using this process, we demonstrate multilevel interconnect and passive component structures including conductor patterns, crossover bridges, and tapped planar spiral inductors. Together, these represent an important step towards the realization of all-printed RFID...|$|R
25|$|The term {{mechatronics}} {{is typically}} {{used to refer}} to macroscopic systems but futurists have predicted the emergence of very small electromechanical devices. Already, such small devices, known as Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), are used in automobiles to tell airbags when to deploy, in digital projectors to create sharper images, and in <b>inkjet</b> printers to create nozzles for high definition printing. In the future it is hoped the devices will help build tiny implantable medical devices and improve optical communication.|$|E
25|$|Trash was a {{historic}} release {{as it was}} issued without a record company and initially offered to fans via a low-key guestbook entry, made by King, on www.level42.com. Using an Apple Mac, CD burner and <b>inkjet</b> printer, King manufactured the CD himself and posted it directly to fans, charging £17 plus postage. He hand signed and numbered early copies. Clearly not anticipating {{the popularity of the}} album, the initial CDs were numbered as part of a series of 100. Word soon spread of the CD and King eventually sold over 1,000 copies.|$|E
25|$|Design or artwork is {{generally}} prepared in advance, although some professional and highly experienced hand engravers {{are able to}} draw out minimal outlines either on paper or directly on the metal surface just prior to engraving. The work to be engraved may be lightly scribed on the surface with a sharp point, laser marked, drawn with a fine permanent marker (removable with acetone) or pencil, transferred using various chemicals in conjunction with <b>inkjet</b> or laser printouts, or stippled. Engraving artists may rely on hand drawing skills, copyright-free designs and images, computer-generated artwork, or common design elements when creating artwork.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{specialty}} {{application for}} <b>inkjets</b> is producing prepress color proofs for printing jobs created digitally. Such printers {{are designed to}} give accurate color rendition of how the final image will look (a [...] "proof") when the job is finally produced on a large volume press such as a four-colour offset lithography press. An example is an Iris printer, whose output is what the French term Giclée was coined for.|$|R
50|$|Screen {{printing}} {{is appropriate}} for fabricating electrics and electronics due to its ability to produce patterned, thick layers from paste-like materials. This method can produce conducting lines from inorganic materials (e.g. for circuit boards and antennas), but also insulating and passivating layers, whereby layer thickness {{is more important than}} high resolution. Its 50 m²/h throughput and 100 µm resolution are similar to <b>inkjets.</b> This versatile and comparatively simple method is used mainly for conductive and dielectric layers, but also organic semiconductors, e.g. for OPVCs, and even complete OFETs can be printed.|$|R
40|$|A {{procedure}} {{was developed to}} form openings in dielectric layers for subsequent contact formation based on <b>inkjetting</b> hydrocarbon wax. Basic investigations on the process focussing on obtaining the minimal feature size are presented. Continuous fine line openings below 20 m width in the mask were obtained, which allowed for wet chemical etching of the underlying anti-reflective coatings. Subsequently nickel and Silver plating were used to form ohmic contacts, leading to a width of the metallization of down to about 30 mu;m. The results were achieved on micro-structured silicon surfaces covered by a silicon nitride layer commonly used in the photovoltaic industry...|$|R
25|$|Lower cost in the future: OLEDs can {{be printed}} onto any {{suitable}} substrate by an <b>inkjet</b> printer or even by screen printing, theoretically making them cheaper to produce than LCD or plasma displays. However, fabrication of the OLED substrate is currently more costly {{than that of}} a TFT LCD. Roll-to-roll vapor-deposition methods for organic devices do allow mass production of thousands of devices per minute for minimal cost; however, this technique also induces problems: devices with multiple layers can be challenging to make because of registration—lining up the different printed layers to the required degree of accuracy.|$|E
25|$|Vacuum {{deposition}} is not {{a suitable}} method for forming thin films of polymers. However, polymers can be processed in solution, and spin coating is a common method of depositing thin polymer films. This method is more suited to forming large-area films than thermal evaporation. No vacuum is required, and the emissive materials can also be applied on the substrate by a technique derived from commercial <b>inkjet</b> printing. However, as the application of subsequent layers tends to dissolve those already present, formation of multilayer structures is difficult with these methods. The metal cathode may {{still need to be}} deposited by thermal evaporation in vacuum. An alternative method to vacuum deposition is to deposit a Langmuir-Blodgett film.|$|E
25|$|The {{applications}} for sol gel-derived products are numerous. For example, scientists {{have used it}} to produce the world’s lightest materials and also some of its toughest ceramics. One of the largest application areas is thin films, which can be produced {{on a piece of}} substrate by spin coating or dip coating. Protective and decorative coatings, and electro-optic components can be applied to glass, metal and other types of substrates with these methods. Cast into a mold, and with further drying and heat-treatment, dense ceramic or glass articles with novel properties can be formed that cannot be created by any other method. Other coating methods include spraying, electrophoresis, <b>inkjet</b> printing or roll coating.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, {{a large number of}} {{advances}} have been made in numerical techniques to track moving interfaces. These include Level Set Methods, Fast Marching Methods, Ordered Upwind Methods, and Escape Arrival Methods. These techniques rely on recasting the Lagrangian problem of moving interface as a static partial differential equa-tion, most typically {{in the form of an}} initial value or boundary value Hamilton-Jacobi-type equation. In this paper, we review some of the most recent applications of these techniques, including applications to jetting devices in <b>inkjets</b> and industrial printing, superconformal deposition in semiconductor manufacturing, and seismic imaging in geophysical imaging.

A nearly perfect HC-texture with 18. 2 % reflection after texturization was obtained despite printing irregularities in the masking step. Lifetime measurements after emitter diffusion and anti-reflection coating show that the HC-texture is also better passivated than of the 25. 8 % reflecting acidic texture {{that was used in}} the reference group. An overall efficiency gain of 0. 6 % might be deduced when using a HC-texture instead of the acidic texture...|$|R
50|$|The printer head is {{attached}} to a metal bar that ensures correct alignment, but horizontal positioning is controlled by a band that attaches to sprockets on two wheels at each side which is then driven with an electric motor. This band may be made of stainless steel, phosphor bronze or beryllium copper alloys, nylon or various synthetic materials with a twisted nylon core to prevent stretching. Actual position can be found out either by dead count using a stepper motor, rotary encoder attached to one wheel or a transparent plastic band with markings that is read by an optical sensor on the printer head (common on <b>inkjets).</b>|$|R
