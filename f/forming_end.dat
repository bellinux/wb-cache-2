50|$|Other {{applications}} of trommel screens {{can be seen}} in the screening process of composts as an enhancement technique. It selects composts of variable size fractions to get rid of contaminants and incomplete composted residues, <b>forming</b> <b>end</b> products with a variety of uses. Besides this, the food industries use trommel screens to sort dry food of different sizes and shapes. The classification process will help to achieve the desired mass or heat transfer rate and avoid under or over-processing. It also screens tiny food such as peas and nuts that are strong enough to resist the rotational force of the drum.|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, {{thin-walled}} super-diameter pipes {{are produced}} by the method of plastic bending of sheets.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new tooling system for <b>forming</b> <b>end</b> shells of {{aluminum}} beverage cans to improve panel wall thinning. Shell forming simulations are then performed {{to investigate the}} effective factors on forming quality using the finite element method. The structural optimization technoloygy based on numerical simulations is finally applied to search optimum design points of the new tooling system. Optimization results show that panel wall thinning of end shell can be improved 7. 4 % by the design optimization of forming processes and tool profiles in the new tooling system, {{as compared with the}} base line model of conventional tooling system. It is also confirmed that the end shell formed by the new tooling system has higher buckling strength under internal pressure...|$|E
