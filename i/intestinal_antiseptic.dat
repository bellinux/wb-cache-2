40|$|Acute {{diarrhea}} (AD) is {{the most}} frequent gastroenterological disorder, and {{the main cause of}} dehydration in childhood. It is manifested by a sudden occurrence of three or more watery or loose stools per day lasting for seven to 10 days, 14 days at most. It mainly occurs in children until five years of age and particularly in neonates in the second half-year and children until the age of three years. Its primary causes are gastrointestinal infections, viral and bacterial, and more rarely alimentary intoxications and other factors. As dehydration and negative nutritive balance are the main complications of AD, {{it is clear that the}} compensation of lost body fluids and adequate diet form the basis of the child’s treatment. Other therapeutic measures, except antipyretics in high febrility, antiparasitic drugs for intestinal lambliasis, anti-amebiasis and probiotics are rarely necessary. This primarily regards uncritical use of antibiotics and <b>intestinal</b> <b>antiseptics</b> in the therapy of bacterial diarrhea. The use of antiemetics, antidiarrhetics and spasmolytics is unnecessary and potentially risky, so that it is not recommended for children with AD...|$|R

The treatment regimen bacterial etiology involves the suppression of pathogenic and conditionally pathogenic with {{the restoration of the}} normal intestinal microflora. For effective antibiotic pharmacotherapy of intestinal infections are widely used drug combinations with the additionof nifuroxazide, as well as enzymatic and normalizing bowel motility broad-spectrum drugs. <b>Intestinal</b> <b>antiseptics</b> nifuroxazide characterized by broad spectrum of antibacterial action against Staphylococcus spp, Clostridium spp, E. coli, Salmonella spp, Shigellaspp, Proteus spp, Klebsiellaspp, Enterobacter spp, V. cholerae, H. pylori, Yersinia spp, and also the lack of effect on the normal intestinal flora, high safety profile. Recently, for the treatment of intestinal infections nifuroxazide often combined with pre- and probiotics for complex correction of the intestinal microflora disorders. For complex therapy of intestinal infections, we have developed an original combined medicine "Diaplant", in the form of capsules, comprising as active ingredients nifuroxazide (200 mg) in combination with plant substance plantaglucide (200 mg). Plantaglucide drug obtained from Plantago major has spasmolytic, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activity, normalizes bowel peristalsis, while reducing the tone of smooth muscles of the stomach and intestines, reduces swelling folds of the gastric mucosa, and contained therein polysaccharides in the form of pectins have properties of prebiotic and have immunostimulatory effects. Aim of the work – study of antibacterial action of combined drug "Diaplant" containing nifuroxazide and plantaglucide in regard to test strains and clinical strains of microorganisms allocated from patients with bacterial diarrhea. Materials and methods. Estimation of antimicrobial activity was performed under conditions in vitro by method of serial dilutions. The object of research is a combined drug " Diaplant ", a reference drug"Enterofuril" manufacture of ("Bosnalijek" Bosnia and Herzegovina). For the evaluation of drugs samples activity used the following test strains: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Basillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Proteus vulgaris ATCC 4636, Pseudomonas aeruginosa АТСС 27853, Candida albicans ATCC 885 / 653. Clinical material comes from the Center of medical and environmental research to the bacteriological laboratory. Was allocated and identified 109 strains of conditionally pathogenic microorganisms. Results and its discussion. For clinical and test strains S. aureus MIC indicators for combined drug «Diaplant" were 15. 0 mg / l, whereas the reference drug "Enterofuril" MIC equaled 30. 0 mg / l. For E. coli - MIC indicators for combined drug «Diaplant" was 7. 5 mg / l, for an "Enterofurila" - 15. 0 - 30 mg l. MIC for combined drug "Diaplant" against different clinical strains of Enterobacteriaceae species ranged from 15. 0 mg / l to 30. 0 mg / l in comparison with "Enterofurilom", where the MIC was 30 mg / l - 60 mg / l. For yeasts and clinical strains C. albicans MIC combination drug "Diaplant" product is 15. 0 mg / l, whereas equal to 30. 0 mg / l for the control drug "Enterofuril" MIC. For test strains, such as P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853, P. vulgaris ATCC 4636, MIC "Diaplant" drug was 100. 0 mg / l, whereas control drug "Enterofuril" MIC was above > 100. 0 mg / l. For clinical strains of P. mirabilis and P. vulgaris MIC "Diaplant" was 30. 0 mg / l, whereas the MIC "Enterofuril" equal to 60. 0 mg / l. For clinical P. aeruginosa strains MIC "Diaplant" was 100. 0 mg / l, whereas control drug "Enterofuril" MIC was above > 100. 0 mg / l. It has been established that 80 - 95...|$|R

Diarrhea {{is one of the}} public health problems in Indonesia. For treatment of diarrhea, most Indonesian tribes use young leaves of Psidium guajava L. as a remedy. They consume it because this medicinal plant is easily found, mainly in the rural area, and because it is also cheaper than western medicine. In the treatment of diarrhea, Psidium guajava L. can be use in several ways, such as infusion or decoction, infusions of young leaves of plant itself or a decoction as a mixture with other parts of the same plant. The mixture can also be combined with other medicinal plants. Some active constituents that have properties with primary impact on the gut as anti-dirrheic are, tannins, pectin and essential oils. The tannins have properties as astringent or antiseptic. Astringent precipitates proteins in the mucous membrane and reduces <b>intestinal</b> motility. The <b>antiseptic</b> maybe also have some antibacterial effect. Pectin covers the digestive tract by forming a thin coat over the mucous, membrane. Essential oils have properties as an antiseptic and an antispasmodic. Tannins and essential oils are found mostly in young leaves of Psidium guajava L.

Diazepam was used as a reference anxiolytic agent in this study. The results of this study showed a dose-dependent anxiolytic and analgesic activity of asafoetida, with a mild sedative effect in high doses. Compared to diazepam, the asafoetida seems to be a better alternative for the treatment of anxiety disorders. However, further experimental and clinical studies are warranted to accurately assess its safety and efficacy for treatment of chronic anxiety...|$|E
40|$|FOR {{the past}} several years {{interest}} has increased in the use of sulphur as an agent to combat parasitic diseases of poul-try. Philips, Carr, and Kennard (1921) believed that a ration containing 2 percent flowers of sulphur had interesting possibili-ties as an <b>intestinal</b> <b>antiseptic.</b> More re-cently Herrick and Holmes (1936) re-ported that flowers of sulphur holds much promise in the prevention of coccidiosis. These latter workers (1938) later stated that various types of sulphur could be used to prevent coccidiosis, but that ordinary flowers of sulphur seemed to be more satisfactory than the other kinds used in their tests. Dickinson and Scofield (1939) question the ability of flowers of sulphur to con-trol coccidiosis when the chicks are kept under conditions favoring natural infec-tion. Emmel (1937, 1939) reported that commercial flour sulphur is of value in controlling poultry lice, mites, fleas, ticks, and Capillaria contorta. Carpenter (1939) stated that sulphur flour gave better pro-tection against inoculations of coc'cidia than flowers of sulphur due to its greater fineness.
