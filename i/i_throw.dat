25|$|I have {{a sinking}} fastball {{to either side}} of the plate, a cutter (which changes the {{direction}} of my fastball so it breaks instead of sinking), {{to either side of}} the plate, a curveball <b>I</b> <b>throw</b> at three speeds and three angles, a straight change—using the same arm speed and position as a fastball but with a grip and a release that slows it dramatically, and changeups to different locations that <b>I</b> <b>throw</b> off my sinker which look like batting practice fastballs. Different locations, different speeds, and slightly different arm angles on all those pitches give me a wide palette of choices.|$|E

500|$|During {{his playing}} career, Rivera was {{regarded}} as a team leader within the Yankees organization, often mentoring younger pitchers and counseling teammates. He had a team-first mindset and deferred most discussions about individual accolades to team goals and his teammates, praising them for making his presence in games possible. When once asked to describe his job, Rivera put it simply, [...] "I get the ball, <b>I</b> <b>throw</b> the ball, and then I take a shower." ...|$|E

In the aforementioned Scientific American interview from 1999, he was reported as having bristled at the question: [...] "My {{name is not}} Strangelove. I don't know about Strangelove. I'm not interested in Strangelove. What else can I say?... Look. Say it three times more, and <b>I</b> <b>throw</b> you out of this office." [...] In one episode of Mission Hill (1999), a character appears to be inspired by Edward Teller. The character is very old, has pictures of himself and other scientists in his home office and {{is known as the}} father of the nuclear bomb.|$|E

60|$|Presently, when B.'s {{boat was}} just right for his anglers to see {{everything}} my way, I felt a tug on my line. I leaped up, let the reel run. Then <b>I</b> <b>threw</b> on my drag and leaned over to strike. But he let go. Quickly <b>I</b> <b>threw</b> off the drag. The sailfish came back. Another tug! I let him run. Then threw on the drag and got ready. But, no, he let go. Again <b>I</b> <b>threw</b> off the drag and again he came back. He was hungry, but he was cunning, too, and too far back for me to see. I let him run fifty feet, threw on the drag, and struck hard. No go! I missed him. But again <b>I</b> <b>threw</b> off the drag, let out more line back to him, {{and he took the}} bait the fourth time, and harder than ever. I let him run perhaps a hundred feet. All the time, of course, my boat was running. I had out a long line--two hundred yards. Then <b>I</b> <b>threw</b> on the drag and almost cracked the rod. This time I actually felt the hook go in.|$|R

500|$|Though {{he was not}} a power pitcher, Hoffman was a strikeout pitcher. His 9.36 K/9 was the fifth-highest in MLB history, {{and highest}} ever among relievers. Sports {{journalist}} Fran Zimniuch wrote in Fireman: The Evolution of the Closer in Baseball that Hoffman was [...] "a thinking man's closer, using guile rather than heat." [...] As the velocity of his fastball decreased, he compensated with a devastating changeup that is as synonymous a pitch with Hoffman as the splitter is with Bruce Sutter or the cutter is with Mariano Rivera. [...] "It's a tough situation throwing a change-up in the ninth inning, unless you've got Trevor's changeup", closer Billy Wagner said. [...] "There's not many guys who have a changeup that's dominating", All-Star third basemen Scott Rolen said. [...] "But his is dominating. It's a weapon. That's not usually a word you use with a changeup." [...] Robb Nen, a retired closer, was amazed at how Hoffman got better after he lost velocity on his fastball. [...] "I don't think I could do it, to just lose the ability to throw 95 and still be one of the best. I have tremendous respect for him", Nen said. Another retired closer, Troy Percival, concurred about the difficulty in transforming from a power pitching style. [...] "It's not easy to do. Guys who throw 95, 96 [...] have an ego about being able to do that. [...] just went right into, 'Hey, you know, <b>I</b> <b>throw</b> 87 now. This is what I've got.' And he goes out there and gets it done just as well as he ever did." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 2006, {{she started}} working with Danja, who {{contacted}} songwriters such as Keri Hilson, Jim Beanz, Marcella Araica and Corte Ellis to work with him. The team wrote seven tracks for Spears: [...] "Gimme More", [...] "Break the Ice", [...] "Get Naked (I Got a Plan)", [...] "Hot as Ice", [...] "Perfect Lover", [...] "Outta This World" [...] and [...] "Get Back". Danja explained that the creative process was not difficult at first since he was [...] "left to do pretty much whatever I wanted to", and [...] "if she felt it, she was gonna ride with it. If she didn't, you'd see it in her face." [...] Hilson wrote [...] "Gimme More" [...] with Spears in mind after Danja played her the instrumental, saying, [...] "I just started singing, 'Give me, Give me' and added a little more in and just having fun and messing around really." [...] Spears began recording with them at Studio at the Palms in Las Vegas in August 2006, while she was seven months pregnant with Jayden James. Recording continued at Spears' house in Los Angeles, three weeks after she gave birth. Hilson commented that [...] "She gave 150 percent. [...] I don't know any other mother that would do that." [...] Danja added that despite all her problems in her personal life, [...] "As far as her work ethic, I haven't seen anybody come in like that {{and do what you}} go to do." [...] Regarding the sound of the album, he deemed it as bigger, more mature and [...] "a new Britney", explaining: [...] "I come from hip-hop, so it's underlined with , but <b>I</b> <b>throw</b> it down." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the end of}} the game, Young {{showed his}} jubilation at finally being able to win [...] "the big one" [...] while {{accepting}} the MVP trophy. [...] "There were times when this was hard! But this is the greatest feeling in the world! [...] No one — no one! — can ever take this away from us! No one, ever! It's ours!" [...] Young and his teammates were equally enthusiastic in the locker room afterwards. [...] "We're part of history", said guard Jesse Sapolu. [...] "This is probably the best offense people will see in their lifetimes." [...] "Is this great or what?" [...] Young added. [...] "I mean, I haven't thrown six touchdown passes in a game in my life. Then <b>I</b> <b>throw</b> six in the Super Bowl! Unbelievable." ...|$|E
2500|$|In late 2014, whilst {{promoting}} the film Into the Woods, Tracey Ullman revealed plans {{to write something}} new for television in the following year. [...] "Every five years it comes to me to sort of do what I do again and <b>I</b> <b>throw</b> a load of stuff at the wall, {{and some of it}} works and some of it obviously doesn't, but that's the nature of television. I love TV." [...] Her American Showtime series, Tracey Ullman's State of the Union ran for three seasons, concluding in 2010. It was a departure and a return of sorts. Instead of playing just original characters (a staple of Ullman's comedy) the show saw her imitating real people (celebrities, politicians, etc.) something she hadn't done since her early days at the BBC with Three of a Kind, the show that made her a household name in Great Britain.|$|E
2500|$|Richie {{said that}} about halfway through the reveal episode, Alfie [...] "resigns himself {{to the fact that}} it's over between Kat and Alfie, there is no going back", and said that Neilson said halfway through the 15-minute scene that Alfie would be thinking, [...] "I {{understand}} you've done this with somebody... We can get over this... What do you mean... it's been going on for months? We can get over it, because I know you don't love him... What, you love this guy? It's someone we know? Someone in the pub...?", and said that Alfie needs to know who it is for his own peace of mind, though [...] "his whole life just crumbles in his hands". Richie said that viewers would be surprised by the final reveal, stating that [...] "it's really interesting about how we play the Branning card as to which one of them it is. The way it's worded, you believe it's one brother in particular and then that all changes and you go, 'oh it's him!' Because we make people believe it's another Branning—the way its worded, the way I face up to one of them. The audience will all think it's one person in particular, but then <b>I</b> <b>throw</b> a curve ball and it all kicks off. It's great." [...] Richie said that Alfie cannot understand why Kat is having an affair with Derek, which [...] "makes him sick". He also stated that viewers would find out in January 2013 why Kat had the affair with the person she did. He said: [...] "It's an ongoing story, which is really interesting, to see why Kat was with Alfie and why she went for this bloke because they both offer her different things." [...] Richie speculated that the reason Kat had an affair with Derek is [...] "because Derek is the total polar opposite of Alfie" [...] and Kat is [...] "attracted to danger", which is not like Alfie, and Kat is [...] "used to danger, she's used to excitement. What she got from Alfie was the fairytale, what she wanted was the nightmare". However, the reasons for Kat having the affair were never explained on screen.|$|E
