40|$|We {{report on}} {{low-temperature}} specific heat measurements of superconducting amorphous Zr 100 -xCux (19 ≤ x ≤ 64) alloys prepared by sputtering that we compare to corresponding alloys obtained by fast liquid-quenching technique. Whereas the superconducting transition temperature Tc {{is very close}} for these two kinds of amorphous alloys, indicating that it is almost insensitive to the higher degree of structural disorder inherent to sputtering, both the electronic coefficient γ and the lattice β T 3 contribution are larger for the sputtered alloys. The common character of an increasing value of γ with the Zr content is considerably enhanced for the sputtered alloys. However, such surprisingly high y values do not lead to any anomalous behaviour for the superconductivity process, as proved by the complete <b>electronic</b> <b>condensation</b> below Tc. All thermodynamic parameters are sensitive to structural relaxation, at variance with the liquid-quenched alloys, whereas the Tc depression is of the same magnitude in both kinds of alloys...|$|E
40|$|Evidence of both {{fractional}} and integer quantum hall effects (QHE) {{in three}} dimensional bulk replica opal (250 nm diameter) structures of non-crystalline carbon are presented. In a remarkably soft quantum limit of ~ 40 K temperature and about one tesla of magnetic field clear hall steps, such as n= 2 / 3, 4 / 5, 1 {{and others were}} observed to be coordinated with the minima of longitudinal magneto-resistance. This behavior is indicative of macroscopic quantum phenomenon associated with <b>electronic</b> <b>condensation</b> into a strongly correlated quantum liquid (QL). For other systems, such as very high mobility, two-dimensional, electron (hole) -gas or (TDEG) these effects typically arise under high magnetic fields (B) and at low temperatures (T), i. e., in the extreme quantum limit (B/T> 1). Currently, QHE is applied as calibration benchmark, international resistance standard, and a characterization technique for semiconductor heterostructures. We believe that applications can be widespread if the devices and the operating conditions were more accessible. Comment: 14 pages, 4 figure...|$|E
40|$|Electronic {{systems are}} {{sometimes}} exposed to harsh environmental conditions of temperature and humidity. Moisture transfer into <b>electronic</b> enclosures and <b>condensation</b> can cause several {{problems such as}} corrosion and alteration in thermal stresses. It is therefore essential to study the local climate inside the enclosures {{to be able to}} protect the electronic systems. In this work, moisture transfer into a typical electronic enclosure is numerically studied using CFD. In order to reduce the CPU-time and make a way for subsequent factorial design analysis, a simplifying modification is applied in which the real 3 D geometry is approximated by a 2 D axial symmetry one. The results for 2 D and 3 D models were compared in order to calibrate the 2 D representation. Furthermore, simulation results were compared with experimental data and good agreement was found...|$|R
40|$|Purpose RNA {{interference}} (RNAi) is {{a process}} by which small interfering RNAs (siRNA) induce sequence-specific gene silencing. Therefore, siRNA is an emerging promise as a novel therapeutic. In order to realize the high expectations for therapeutic applications, efficient delivery systems for siRNA are necessary. Methods In this study, {{a new series of}} biodegradable poly (amido amine) s with disulfide linkages in the backbone was synthesized out of N,N′-cystaminebisacrylamide (CBA), 4 -amino- 1 -butanol (ABOL) and ethylene diamine (EDA). Effects of different percentages of butanolic side chains and protonatable fragments in the main chain on siRNA complexation, cellular uptake, gene silencing and toxicity were investigated. Results Incorporation of EDA in the polymer resulted in increased siRNA condensation.

40|$|Electronic {{systems are}} exposed to harsh {{environmental}} conditions such as high humidity in many applications. Moisture transfer into <b>electronic</b> enclosures and <b>condensation</b> can cause several problems as material degradation and corrosion. Therefore, {{it is important to}} control the moisture content and the relative humidity inside electronic enclosures. In this work, moisture transfer into a typical polycarbonate electronic enclosure with a cylindrical shape opening is studied. The effects of four influential parameters namely, initial relative humidity inside the enclosure, radius and length of the opening and temperature are studied. A set of experiments are done based on a fractional factorial design in order to estimate the time constant for moisture transfer into the enclosure by fitting the experimental data to an analytical quasi-steady-state model. According to the statistical analysis, temperature and the opening length are found as the most significant factors. Based on analysis of variance of the derived time constants, a semi-empirical regression model is proposed to predict the moisture transfer time constant with an adjusted R 2 of 0. 98; which demonstrated that the model can be used for estimation with a reasonable accuracy. The results show that the temperature has the highest effect on the moisture transfer time constant. Furthermore, the length of the opening is found to be more influential on the moisture transfer time constant at lower temperatures compare to high temperatures, according to the predictions made through the semi-empirical model...|$|R
