40|$|The {{subject of}} the {{bachelor}} thesis is The Quality of <b>Game</b> <b>Meat</b> and <b>Game</b> <b>Farmed</b> Herds. The main goal {{of this study was}} to focus on the quality parameters of the <b>meat</b> or <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> and also on the already existing conclusions of those scientific studies, which dealt with some specific indicators of <b>farmed</b> and hunting <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> quality. The thesis includes the game's devision, description of some of its kinds and information on game keeping, hunting development and even on gaining the game itself. Besides it covers also veterinary and hygienic requirements on the meat and on the release of the game to the market. Considerable part of the thesis deals with possible biological, chemical and physical risks of meat consumption. The major differences between <b>farmed</b> and hunting <b>game</b> as well as selected kinds of <b>farmed</b> <b>game</b> are described in the conclusion of the thesis...|$|R

Implementation of {{existing}} meat hygiene legislation {{can be costly}} to the <b>game</b> <b>farm</b> owner in terms of slaughter facilities and human resources. This can consequently force farmers and processors to operate outside of the law when delivering <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> to the market. In answer to this a <b>Game</b> <b>Meat</b> Scheme was negotiated between Wildlife Ranching South Africa, represented by the researcher and the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. Nevertheless, the <b>Game</b> <b>Meat</b> Scheme only offers a 5 year period of grace for legal compliance for game farmers producing for the local meat market. Concerns of Wildlife Ranching South Africa on the implementation of such and other legal procedures on <b>game</b> <b>farms</b> motivated the comparative research on regulated and non-regulated game carcasses. Dependent and independent variables were researched to compare game carcasses intended for the export market (aspiring to strict requirements), and game carcasses intended for the local market (no control measures). The swabbing sampling technique used by the researcher was verified against the excision method (used by the export market). The {{results of this study}} have further led to a proposed innovation in the testing and verification of current legislation culminating in the <b>Game</b> <b>Meat</b> scheme and a new <b>Game</b> <b>Meat</b> Guide that could lead to the development of practical guidelines for the hunting process on the farm...|$|R
40|$|The {{purchasing}} {{and marketing}} of <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> by supermarkets and butcheries in the Western Cape Province of South Africa was researched by the survey method. Two supermarket groups in South Africa indicated that they do market <b>game</b> <b>meat,</b> and springbok (Antidorcas marsupialis) was the species that most supermarkets sold. Both supermarket groups {{indicated that they would}} sell more <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> if available. They also mentioned that a central marketing structure would facilitate the sale of <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> and ensure consistent quality. Thirteen of the twenty butcheries that sell <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> were also in favour of a central marketing structure. The butcheries indicated that consumers are not adequately informed about the health benefits and cooking methods of <b>game</b> <b>meat.</b> Some of the meat buyers at butcheries were ignorant of the qualities of meat that are important when purchasing <b>game</b> <b>meat.</b> It is evident that <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> marketers should exercise stricter control over the quality of <b>game</b> <b>meat,</b> and that supermarkets and butcheries are not promoting <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> extensively enough.

40|$|Thesis (DTech. {{degree in}} Environmental Health) [...] Tshwane University of Technology, 2011. The South African <b>game</b> <b>farming</b> {{industry}} {{has become a}} world leader in the utilization of <b>game,</b> including the <b>meat</b> of <b>game</b> animals. The fast growth in the <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> industry is fuelled by health conscious consumers for meat with a low fat content. Although research on the production potential of African ungulates has been done, little {{has been done on}} the factors in the supply chain that affect the provision of safe <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> to the consumer. A literature review of the study field was completed to obtain an understanding of the value chain. In order to obtain information regarding the status of existing policies, strategies and practices that may impact on <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> safety, questionnaires were distributed to game farmers, hunters, butcheries, provincial offices of Veterinary Public Health (VPH) and Environmental Health (EH) as well as municipalities. Interviews were also conducted with those members of national departments who are responsible for policy making. The results represent the first systematic analysis of the current status of the South African legal framework and its application in relation to <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> safety as well as the practices by stakeholders that impact on the provision of safe <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> to the consumer. The results provide information on the current status of <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> control in South Africa, a description of the <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> supply chain and essential food safety management points in the supply chain; game farmer, hunter and butchery practices; and the knowledge of stakeholders in the <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> industry. 220 The main conclusions drawn from the study were as follows: (1) that the <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> industry is growing in South Africa; (2) that <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> reaches the consumers through a complex supply chain with various stakeholders; (3) that gaps exist in the supply chain that may impact negatively on the supply of safe <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> to the consumer. These gaps apply in particular on the farm, during hunting and control after the farm gate; (4) that there is an inconsistent application of policies and regulations by controlling authorities that leads to fragmentation in the control of <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> safety; and (5) that there is a certain degree of unfamiliarity on the part of stakeholders with regard to the <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> supply chain. A theoretical model was suggested {{that can be used in}} the development of strategies and policies that will help to alleviate the identified concerns and problems that may impact negatively on the provision of safe <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> to the consumer...|$|R
40|$|The study explores South African respondents’ {{attitudes toward}} <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> and finds the {{differences}} between the attitudes of consumer and non-consumer respondents of <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> toward the following attributes of game meat: sensory characteristics; health benefits; <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> production ethics; animal welfare; safety for human consumption; availability; price; promotion; and preparation. This quantitative study determined the attitudes of 1096 consumers and 310 non-consumers of <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> with an online survey using questionnaires. Recruitment was done through social media and e-mail forwarding. The differences in attitudes between consumer and non-consumer respondents were determined using Fishbein’s attitude-toward-the-object model. Based on attitudes toward individual attributes, respondents classified some product attributes as important in their decision to consume, or not to consume, <b>game</b> <b>meat.</b> Respondents indicated that the availability, sensory characteristics, <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> production ethics and health benefits are considered to be important in their consumption of <b>game</b> <b>meat.</b> To market <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> purposefully, the industry should focus on these attributes.

40|$|The expectations, {{perceptions}} and purchasing behaviour of consumers of <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> were Researched by a survey method using a structured, self-administered questionnaire. The {{sample consisted of}} 300 South African consumers and included 100 white, 100 coloured and 100 black consumers. It is evident that South African consumers perceive <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> differently than they do the 'traditional' meat types such as beef, mutton/lamb, chicken and pork. They do not consider <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> as a 'regular' type of meat, but rather as an exotic, seasonal product. Furthermore, South African consumers indicated {{that they are not}} willing to pay more for <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> than other types of meat. South African consumers indicated that they consider the fat content of meat as an important quality when they purchase meat, as they aspire towards consuming lean meat. This research not only shows that South African consumers are ill-informed regarding the positive attributes of <b>game</b> <b>meat,</b> but also that producers and marketers of <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> are not doing enough to promote <b>game</b> <b>meat.</b> This provides an excellent opportunity for <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> producers and marketers, as <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> is lower in fat than pork, lamb or beef.

40|$|In the Republic of Croatia, <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> is {{consumed}} {{far less than}} meat of domestic animals. Yearly <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> consumption amounts to only 0. 55 kg per household member. Consumers prefer meat of domestic animals, because it is cheaper, {{not paying attention to}} specific nutritive advantages of <b>game</b> <b>meat.</b> A research on the <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> market and consumers’ preferences was carried out on 101 examinees, chosen among inhabitants of Slavonia and Baranja. The majority of questioned inhabitants did consume <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> (92 %), of whom 66 % consider <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> to be of better quality than meat of domestic animals. Significant number of examinees considers <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> as healthy food, being also convinced that game was healthier to consume if hunted in their natural environment, than if reared on specialized farms (90 %). Irrespective of quality, only 22 % of examinees buy <b>game</b> <b>meat,</b> and 51 % think such meat is too expensive. This is the main reason why consumers have <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> only once a month (51 %). Taking into consideration monthly income of their respective household, 58 % of examinees can afford <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> only once a month, and, if having an opportunity, they would opt for meat of roe deer (55 %) and rabbit (25 %). When asked what would stimulate the <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> market in Croatia, 56 % of examinees believe this could be achieved by lowering of prices, 27 % think the issue could be addressed by opening of specialty stores, and only 17 % opted for more aggressive marketing activities...|$|R
40|$|The {{perceptions}} {{and consumption of}} <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> by overseas tourists visiting the Western Cape, South Africa, was researched {{by means of the}} survey procedure using a structured, self-administered questionnaire. The research group consisted of sixty tourists, most of whom were German and Belgian. All respondents indicated that they know <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> and have eaten it, while most respondents (86 %) indicated that they like <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> and would eat it again. The respondents further indicated <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> as the meat type they most favoured to order in restaurants in South Africa. This provides an opportunity for the restaurant industry to market <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> on a larger scale.

40|$|The <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> {{industry}} {{is continuing to}} grow in South Africa. Several stakeholders {{are involved in the}} <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> supply chain and a high level of knowledge is necessary to ensure compliance with legislation and standards. It was therefore necessary to determine the level of knowledge of the stakeholders since this has not been determined before. Information regarding the extent ofstakeholders' knowledge and the possible impact on compliance to standards was obtained through a desk-top study and an analysis of questionnaire responsesfrom industry, consumers and relevant authorities.

40|$|Abstract <b>Game</b> <b>meat</b> {{may contain}} {{variable}} amounts {{of lead in}} the form of fine metallic residues originating from hunting ammunition. The effect of frequent <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> consumption on the blood lead levels of hunters, who are a high-risk lead exposure group, was studied. Blood lead levels of hunters and control subjects were measured using isotope dilution ICP-MS. Dietary infor-mation about <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> consumption was obtained from a questionnaire. The blood lead concentrations ranged from 21 – 171 ng/mL with a geometric mean of 57 ng/mL (n= 25). However, the individual blood lead concentrations of the hunters did not correlate with the number of their weekly <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> meals (r= 0. 046). The blood lead levels were compared with a control group (n= 21), which consisted of voluntary blood donors from the same region. Analysis of variance, adjusted for age, did not reveal {{a significant difference between the}} two populations (p= 0. 89). Thus, it was concluded that fre-quent consumption of wild <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> has no significant effect on blood lead levels...|$|R

40|$|M. Tech. Environmental Health, Tshwane University of Technology, 2005. The <b>Game</b> <b>Farming</b> Industry in South Africa {{has progressed}} to, not only become {{a world leader}} in {{extensive}} sustainable utilization of game species, but has now tapped into the local and international meat market. Due to demand by inter alia, health conscious consumers, <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> has developed from being traditionally only eaten in the dried form i. e. biltong or dried wors, to {{a large number of}} <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> dishes in popular restaurants and <b>game</b> <b>farm</b> lodges. Although research was done on the health qualities of <b>game</b> <b>meat,</b> not much is known about possible zoonotic diseases when it is consumed. The well published and much talked about tuberculosis epidemic in all the National Parks, reserves, conservation areas and <b>game</b> <b>farms</b> suggested the ideal field for the research. <b>Game</b> <b>meat</b> from all the abovementioned areas is made available on the market for consumption. Therefore, the main reason for the study was to determine whether the causative organism for tuberculosis namely Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis) can, when present, survive the secondary processing methods of cooking and drying. Lung, heart, lymph node, liver, kidney and muscle tissue from buffalo and kudu carcasses (n= 14), identified to have tuberculosis were obtained from the Hluhluwe Umfolozi Park as part of their culling programme. These tissue samples were exposed to the cooking (n= 672) and drying process (n= 56) in a controlled environment in the tuberculosis laboratory at Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute. The cooked and dried samples were processed, incubated for 10 weeks and interpreted. Samples that showed growth typical of M. bovis, were further analysed by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) to perform species conformation. Twenty three (23) of the slants obtained from samples exposed to the cooking process, showed growth while none of the slants obtained from samples exposed to drying showed any growth. One of the twenty three slants that showed growth was from kudu while the rest were from buffalo. None of the growth was confirmed as M. bovis when analysed by means of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). The results showed that the cooking and drying process kills M. bovis when present. <b>Game</b> <b>meat</b> is safe for consumption, when properly cooked at adequate temperature and after sufficient length of time. Furthermore, biltong, derived from the drying process, (i. e. reduced water activity, lower hydrogen-ion concentration and an increased salt content), should be the preferred method of preparation as no growth whatsoever was observed. More growth was observed with buffalo than with kudu. The game industry should take the responsibility to inform and educate the public and commercial market of the best methods and practices to follow with processing and the possible dangers of consuming buffalo, an identified carrier animal of M. bovis...|$|R

The research project "Safety of <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> obtained through hunting" (LEMISI) was conducted in Germany with the purpose of examining the entry of lead as well as copper and zinc into the <b>meat</b> of hunted <b>game</b> when using either lead or non-lead ammunition. The outcome of this study shows that the usage of both lead-based ammunition and alternative non-lead ammunition results in the entry of copper and zinc into the edible parts of the game. Using non-lead ammunition does not entail dangerously elevated levels of copper and zinc, so replacing lead ammunition with alternative ammunition does not introduce a further health problem with regard to these metals. The levels of copper and zinc in <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> found in this study are in the range found in previous studies of game. The content of copper and zinc in <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> is also comparable to those regularly detected in meat and its products from livestock (pig, cattle, sheep) for which the mean human consumption rate is much higher. From the viewpoint of consumer health protection, the use of non-lead ammunition does not pose an additional hazard through copper and zinc contamination. A health risk due to the presence of copper and zinc in <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> at typical levels of consumer exposure is unlikely for both types of ammunition...|$|R

To examine the {{association}} between diet and circulating levels of blood lipid levels in a northern Swedish population. Study design. We compared a group with traditional lifestyle (TLS) based on reindeer herding (TLS group) with those from the same area with a non-traditional lifestyle (NTLS) typical of more industrialized regions of Sweden (NTLS group). The analysis was based on self-reported intake of animal source food (i. e. non-game <b>meat,</b> <b>game</b> <b>meat,</b> fish, dairy products and eggs) and the serum blood level {{of a number of}} lipids [total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), triglycerides (TG), glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids]. Results. The TLS group had higher cholesterol, LDL and HDL levels than the reference group. Of the TLS group, 65 % had cholesterol levels above the threshold for increased risk of coronary heart disease (&#x 2265; 240 mg/dl), as compared to 38 % of the NTLS group. Self-reported consumption of <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> was positively associated with TC and LDL. Conclusions. The high <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> consumption of the TLS group is associated with increased cholesterol levels. High intake of animal protein and fat and low fibre is known to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, but other studies of the TLS in northern Sweden have shown comparable incidences of cardiovascular disease to the reference (NTLS) group from the same geographical area. This indicates that factors other than TC influence disease risk.
