25|$|Economic {{inequality}} affects equity, {{equality of}} outcome and subsequent equality of opportunity.

25|$|In neoclassical economics, <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> <b>is</b> {{described}} {{with growth}} models (e.g., the Solow–Swan model) {{in terms of}} equilibrium ("steady state"). Input per worker and output per worker grow at the same rate. Therefore, capital intensity remains constant over time. At the same time, in equilibrium, {{the rate of growth}} of employment is constant over time. Translated into terms of labor theory of value, this means that the value composition of capital does not rise, and the constant rate of growth of employment also indicates, in terms of the labor theory of value, that {{there is no reason for}} the rate of profit to decline.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally, {{embracing}} liberal market economics {{was considered}} to be the universal path for economic growth, and thus development for all humanity. Yet, continuing conflict and human rights abuses following the end of the Cold War and the fact that two-thirds of the global population seemed to have gained little from the economic gains of globalization, led to fundamental questions about the way development was practiced. Accordingly, human development has emerged in the 1990s to challenge the dominant paradigm of liberal economy in the development community. Human development proponents argue that <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> <b>is</b> insufficient to expand people’s choice or capabilities, areas such as health, education, technology, the environment, and employment should not be neglected.|$|E
25|$|Regarding {{the case}} of India, the authors deny an {{equivalence}} between inclusive political institutions and electoral democracy. Electoral democracy is the de jure system adopted by a country while political institutions refer to the de facto structure and quality of political system of a certain country. For example, India's political system has long been dominated by the Congress Party; the provision of public goods is preyed upon by political Patrimonialism; various members of Lok Sabha (the Indian legislature) face criminal charges; and caste-based inequality still exists. The quality of democracy is very poor and thus the political institutions are flawed in India, which explains why economic institutions are equally poor and <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> <b>is</b> stymied.|$|E
25|$|In this section, Lomborg {{looks at}} the world's natural {{resources}} and draws a conclusion that contrasts starkly {{to that of the}} well known report The Limits to Growth. First, he analyzes food once more, this time from an ecological perspective, and again claims that most food products are not threatened by human growth. An exception, however, is fish, which continues to be depleted. As a partial solution, Lomborg presents fish farms, which cause a less disruptive impact on the world's oceans. Next, Lomborg looks at forests. He finds no indication of widespread deforestation, and notes that even the Amazon still retains more than 80% of its 1978 tree cover. Lomborg points out that in developing countries, deforestation is linked to poverty and poor economic conditions, so he proposes that <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> <b>is</b> the best means to tackle the loss of forests.|$|E

25|$|Acemoglu and Robinson {{counter that}} their theory distinguishes between {{political}} and economic institutions {{and that it is}} not political institutions that contribute to growth directly but economic institutions shaped by the political institutions. In the case of China, even though the political institutions on a higher level are far from inclusive, the incentive to reform Chinese economy does come from political institutions; in 1978 from Deng Xiaoping's Opening up policy {{at the end of the}} internal political feud during the Cultural Revolution. This exactly fits into the theory that the change in political institutions has shaped economic institutions and thus has influenced economic performance. This <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> <b>is</b> further expected to shape the political institutions in China in the future. One can only say that China is an outlier to the theory when in the future China becomes as wealthy as U.S. or Germany but still remains an authoritarian regime.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory of}} ignorance, by Lionel Robbins, {{focuses on the}} market failure as causes for lack of {{economic}} development. It describes the purpose of governments as the distribution of resources. As resources are scarce, the regime has to allocate those resources wisely to encourage economic growth. Therefore, lack of <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> <b>is</b> caused by the inability to carry out correct decisions in allocating economic resources. For example, the previous president of Ghana, Kwame Nkrumah, focused his policies only on developing the country's industries, {{which turned out to}} be disastrous to the economy. His successor, Kofi Abrefa Busia, knowing the mistakes of Nkrumah, still carried out the same expansionary economic policy, not because he did not know what policy was good or bad—because of ignorance—but because the institutional design in Ghana pushed him to do so. This example demonstrates that ignorance oversimplifies the situations and cannot offer a satisfactory explanation for why nations fail. First, this theory assumes that rulers are benevolent, and ignore the possibility that rulers intentionally carry out bad economic decisions for personal interests. Second, if a leader's ignorance is the cause, then by having a better and less ignorant leader, the country will witness greater economic growth. Yet, this isn't always the case.|$|E
25|$|Georgescu {{argues that}} Daly's {{steady-state}} economy will provide no ecological salvation for mankind, especially {{not in the}} longer run. Due to the geologic fact that mineral ores are deposited and concentrated very unevenly in the crust of the Earth, exploration and extraction of mineral resources will sooner or later be faced with the principle of diminishing returns, whereby extraction activities are pushed to still less accessible sites and still lower grades of ores. In the course of time, then, extraction costs and market prices of the incremental amount of resources will tend to increase. Eventually, all minerals will be exhausted, but the economic exhaustion will manifest itself long before the physical exhaustion provides the ultimate backstop for further activity: There will still be deposits of resources left in the crust, but the geologic concentration of these deposits will remain below the critical cutoff grade; hence, continued extraction will no longer pay off, and the market for these resources will then collapse. This long-term dynamics works itself through any economic (sub-)system, regardless of the system's geographical location, its size and its state of development (whether a progressive, a steady or a declining state). In effect, the arguments advanced by Daly {{in support of his}} steady-state economy apply with even greater force in support of a declining-state economy, Georgescu points out: When the overall purpose is to ration and stretch mineral resource use for as long time into the future as possible, zero <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> <b>is</b> more desirable than growth is, true; but negative growth is better still! In this context, Georgescu also criticises Daly for not specifying at what levels man-made capital and human population are to be kept constant in the steady-state.|$|E

500|$|The second {{televised}} debate organised by the Finnish Broadcasting Company on 14 April was {{the last}} before the election and it included all the eight parliamentary parties. The economy was a dominant theme of the debate. Jutta Urpilainen reiterated her claim that the incumbent government was furthering {{the establishment of a}} flat tax. She also accused the government for advancing the interests of the richest percentage {{at the expense of the}} poor people. Jyrki Katainen denied the claims, but the two main governing coalition parties, the NCP and the Centre Party, were the only parties opposed to increasing welfare for the unemployed. Prime Minister Mari Kiviniemi of the Centre Party had previously been quiet on spending cuts, but when pressed on the issue by the debate's moderator she was rather indiscreet on cutting funding for the public sector and the Defence Forces. However, she still insisted that cuts may not be necessary if the <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> <b>is</b> sufficiently high in the following years. Cuts on defence spending were supported by most parties, but Timo Soini contested this by saying that national security can not depend on economic conjectures. The crisis concerning the breaches against the campaign funding laws during the previous electoral campaign in 2007 was also discussed. Kiviniemi admitted that mistakes had been made. Soini called the mishandling an example of corruption and was glad that it was exposed. Kiviniemi discreetly said to Soini that the press had written about events in Soini's party as well. Soini's reply to this was: [...] "The press? Your people are on trial!" ...|$|E
