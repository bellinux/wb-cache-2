5|$|In the {{following}} days, gay leaders refused {{to apologize for}} {{the events of that}} night. This led to increased political power <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> community, which culminated in the election of Mayor Dianne Feinstein to a full term {{the following}} November. In response to a campaign promise, Feinstein appointed a pro-gay Chief of Police, which increased recruitment of gay people in the police force and eased tensions.|$|E
5|$|On a civic level, {{the closure}} of gay bathhouses in San Francisco became a bitter {{political}} fight <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> community. Activists {{put pressure on the}} San Francisco Public Health director to educate people about how AIDS is transmitted, and demanded he close bathhouses as a matter of public health.|$|E
5|$|Bathhouses are {{not always}} {{identifiable}} as such from the outside. Some bathhouses are clearly marked and well lit, others have no marking other than a street address on the door. Bathhouses sometimes display the rainbow flag, which is commonly flown by businesses to identify themselves as gay-run or gay-friendly. Bathhouses commonly advertise widely <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> press and sometimes advertise in mainstream newspapers and other media. In 2003 Australia began airing possibly the world's first television advertisements for a gay bathhouse when advertisements on commercial television in Melbourne promoted Wet on Wellington, a sauna in Wellington Street, Collingwood.|$|E

5|$|Campbell {{moved from}} Seattle to San Francisco in 1975, {{getting a job}} in a {{hospital}} near The Castro and immersing himself in the political and social life of the community, which had become a center for the LGBT community over the previous few years. By 1981, he had enrolled in a training program at University of California, San Francisco, to become an adult health nurse practitioner, with a view to focusing on healthcare <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> and lesbian community.|$|E
5|$|Gay men {{and lesbians}} came {{together}} to work in grassroots political organizations responding to organized resistance in 1977. A coalition of conservatives named Save Our Children staged a campaign to repeal a civil rights ordinance in Dade County, Florida. Save Our Children was successful enough to influence similar repeals in several American cities in 1978. However, the same year a campaign in California called the Briggs Initiative, designed to force the dismissal of homosexual public school employees, was defeated. Reaction {{to the influence of}} Save Our Children and the Briggs Initiative <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> community was so significant that it has been called the second Stonewall for many activists, marking their initiation into political participation.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Newsom gained {{national}} attention when he directed the San Francisco city–county clerk to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, {{in violation of}} the then-current state law. In August 2004, the Supreme Court of California annulled the marriages that Newsom had authorized, as they conflicted with state law at that time. Still, Newsom's unexpected move brought {{national attention}} to the issues of gay marriage, solidifying political support for Newsom in San Francisco and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> community.|$|E

5|$|The book is an {{extensive}} work of investigative journalism, {{written in the}} form of an encompassing time line; the events that shaped the epidemic are presented as sequential matter-of-fact summaries. Shilts describes the impact and the politics involved in battling the disease on particular individuals <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gay,</b> medical, and political communities. Shilts begins his discussion in 1977 with the first confirmed case of AIDS, that of Grethe Rask, a Danish doctor working in Africa. He ends with the announcement by actor Rock Hudson in 1985 that he was dying of AIDS, when international attention on the disease exploded.|$|E
5|$|The {{tone of the}} Seattle {{campaign}} against Initiative Thirteen was different from those in Miami and St. Paul; it focused consistently on privacy and civil rights. Instead of educating the public about different subcultures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> community, they printed effective posters showing an eye peeping through a keyhole and a family living in a fishbowl. High-profile liberal figures, labor unions, and other large organizations including the Church Council of Greater Seattle opposed Initiative Thirteen. David Estes {{did not have the}} enthusiasm and momentum modeled by Bryant and other communities though his campaign used many of their tactics. On election day, Initiative Thirteen was rejected by 63%.|$|E
5|$|Birmingham {{is home to}} many national, {{religious}} and spiritual festivals including a St. George's Day party. The Birmingham Tattoo is a long-standing military show held annually at the National Indoor Arena. The Caribbean-style Birmingham International Carnival takes place in odd numbered years. The UK’s largest two-day Gay Pride is Birmingham Pride (LGBT festival), which is typically held over the spring bank holiday weekend in May. The streets of Birmingham's gay district pulsate with a carnival parade, live music, a dance arena with DJs, cabaret stage, women's arena and a community village. Birmingham Pride takes place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> village. From 1997 until December 2006, the city hosted an annual arts festival ArtsFest, the largest free arts festival in the UK at the time. The city's largest single-day event is its St. Patrick's Day parade (Europe's second largest, after Dublin). Other multicultural events include the Bangla Mela and the Vaisakhi Mela. The Birmingham Heritage Festival is a Mardi Gras style event in August. Caribbean and African culture are celebrated with parades and street performances by buskers.|$|E

5|$|The {{success of}} that initial shoot {{convinced}} Poole to plan two more segments and seek theatrical {{distribution for the}} completed work. He hired Tommy Moore and Casey Donovan for the third segment, Inside. When Fisk's scene partner from Bayside heard about the potential distribution deal, he refused to sign release forms until he was guaranteed 20% of the profits. Instead, Poole decided to scrap the segment and re-shoot with Fisk and Donovan. The resulting footage was so good that Poole decided to use Donovan for the second segment as well, entitled Poolside, and construct the loose storyline around him. The three segments were filmed on a budget of $8,000 over three successive weekends in August 1971 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> resort area of Cherry Grove, New York, on Fire Island.|$|E
5|$|Problems {{had also}} arisen in Buczynski's {{relationship}} with Slater. Living and working {{together at the}} same premises, they had begun to argue regularly, and had both been taking part in sexual activity with other men, particularly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> bathhouses which could then be found in New York. By the summer of 1974 they had broken up, and although they briefly remained roommates, Buczynski soon collected together his belongings and moved back in {{with his mother and}} step-father in Ozone Park, where he converted the basement into a bedroom for himself. No longer working at The Warlock Shop, he found himself broke and isolated from the city's occult community, ultimately ceasing active coven work by September 1974. Eventually, he obtained a part-time job at the BookMasters bookstore at 1482 Broadway in Times Square, and it was while commuting home on the subway one night that he met Bennie Geraci (1950–), a native of New Orleans who had moved to the city. Buczynski and Geraci soon entered into a relationship, with the former moving into the latter's small rented flat in Rego Park, Queens, which was shared with four other men. In January 1975, he lost his job due to the economic recession, but was able to secure a job as an office boy at J. Aron and Company, a commodities trading corporation based in Wall Street.|$|E

25|$|There are {{suggestions}} that homophobia {{on the part}} of the police delayed the linking of all the murders and that they were initially not handled well, but police eventually connected all five killings.
