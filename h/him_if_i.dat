500|$|Hornish again {{returned}} to Penske in 2006. The team changed manufacturers, joining Honda when Toyota and Chevrolet left the series after the 2005 season. His season highlight was the Indianapolis 500, {{when he passed}} Marco Andretti for the lead on the final lap {{to win in the}} second-closest margin of victory in the race's history. Hornish later said about the pass, [...] "I figured I came all this way, I ought to give myself one more shot at it. I kind of looked at it as, I was going to drive over <b>him</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had to. For Marco to come as a rookie and drive like that he should be proud no matter what." [...] His second win of the season was at Richmond (after leading for all but 38 laps), and he took the points lead after winning the next race at Kansas. His fourth and final win of the season was at Kentucky, when he started second and led for 57 laps. In the season-ending race at Chicagoland Hornish qualified for the pole position and finished third, clinching his third series championship and Penske's first. Although he and Dan Wheldon finished the year with the same number of points, the tie was broken by wins; Hornish had four, and Wheldon two.|$|E

2500|$|... "At the Barnes-Roosevelt libel {{trial in}} Syracuse I came across James J. Montague, a {{hardened}} reporter on a highly anti-Roosevelt newspaper, {{walking up and}} down and cursing. I asked him what moved him to these expletives. 'Roosevelt, damn him,' said Montague; 'I can't keep hating <b>him</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> get anywhere within twenty feet of him, and I'm always accidentally doing it. He's spoiling my story.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|While {{murdering a}} police officer is usually a capital offense in Colorado, on June 9, 2005, Denver District Attorney Mitch Morrisey {{announced}} that Gómez-García would be charged with second degree murder and first degree attempted murder. [...] These charges posed a maximum of 32–96 years in prison. [...] Morrisey justified the charges, stating, [...] "It is my understanding that I would be prohibited from extraditing <b>him</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> sought first-degree murder charges in this case." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} {{is an example of}} this type of experience: ‘My husband died in June 1945, and 26 years afterwards when I was at Church, I felt him standing beside me during the singing of a hymn. I felt I would see <b>him</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> turned my head. The feeling was so strong I was reduced to tears. I had not been thinking of him before I felt his presence. I had not had this feeling before that day, neither has it happened since then.’ ...|$|E
2500|$|Fisher's aim was 'efficiency of {{the fleet}} and its instant {{readiness}} for war', which won him support amongst {{a certain kind of}} navy officer. He believed in advancing the most able, rather than the longest serving. This upset those he passed over. Thus, he divided the navy into those who approved of his innovations and those who did not. As he became older and more senior he also became more autocratic and commented, 'Anyone who opposes me, I crush'. He believed that nations fought wars for material gain, and that maintaining a strong navy deterred other nations from engaging it in battle, thus decreasing the likelihood of war: [...] On the British fleet rests the British Empire. Fisher also believed that the risk of catastrophe in a sea battle was far greater than on land: a war could be lost or won in a day at sea, with no hope of replacing lost ships, but an army could be rebuilt quickly. When an arms race broke out between Germany and Britain to build larger navies, the German Kaiser commented, 'I admire Fisher, I say nothing against <b>him.</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> were in his place I should do all that he has done and I should do all that I know he has in mind to do'.|$|E
5000|$|He {{was known}} for his fascination with the macabre and other forms of sexual eccentricity. When Selwyn visited a dying Henry Fox, he was refused admission. When Fox learned of this he quipped, [...] "If Mr. Selwyn calls again, show <b>him</b> up. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> am alive, I shall be glad to see <b>him,</b> and <b>if</b> <b>I</b> am dead, I am sure he will be delighted to see me!" ...|$|R

2500|$|Joseph Smith, {{the founder}} of the Latter Day Saint movement, was a strong proponent of capital punishment, and favored {{execution}} methods that involved the shedding of blood as retribution for crimes of bloodshed. In 1843, he or his scribe commented that the common execution method in Christian nations was hanging, [...] "instead of blood for blood according to the law of heaven." [...] Years before making this remark, however, Smith was quoted as saying that the hanging of Judas Iscariot was not a suicide, but an execution carried out by Saint Peter. In a March 4, 1843 debate with church leader George A. Smith, who argued against capital punishment, Smith said that if he ever had the opportunity to enact a death penalty law, he [...] "was opposed to hanging" [...] the convict; rather, he would [...] "shoot him, or cut off his head, spill his blood on the ground, and let the smoke thereof ascend up to God." [...] In the church's April 6, 1843 general conference, Smith said he would [...] "wring a thief's neck off if I can find <b>him,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> cannot bring him to justice any other way." [...] Sidney Rigdon, Smith's counselor in the First Presidency, also supported capital punishment involving the spilling of blood, stating, [...] "There are men standing in your midst that you can't do anything with them but cut their throat and bury them." [...] On the other hand, Smith was willing to tolerate the presence of men [...] "as corrupt as the devil himself" [...] in Nauvoo, Illinois, who [...] "had been guilty of murder and robbery," [...] in the chance that they might [...] "come to the waters of baptism ...|$|E
