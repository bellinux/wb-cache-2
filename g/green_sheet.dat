The Stillwater meandered here, and little breaks {{on the water}} gave {{evidence}} of feeding trout. We had several miles of meadow, and then sheered {{off to the left}} up into the timber. It was a spruce forest, very still and fragrant. We climbed out up on a bench, and across a flat, up another bench, out of the timber into the patches of snow. Here snow could be felt in the air. Water was everywhere. I saw a fox, a badger, and another furry creature, too illusive to name. One more climb brought us {{to the top of the}} Flattop Pass, about eleven thousand feet. The view in the direction from which we had come was splendid, and led the eye to the distant sweeping ranges, dark and dim along the horizon. The Flattops were flat enough, but not very wide at this pass, and we were soon going down again into a green gulf of spruce, with ragged peaks lifting beyond. Here again I got the suggestion of limitless space. It took us an hour to ride down to Little Trappers Lake, a small clear <b>green</b> <b>sheet</b> of water. The larger lake was farther down.

60|$|We wandered gaily {{over the}} hill, calling {{to each other}} with {{laughter}} and jest, getting parted and delightfully lost in that little pathless wilderness, and finding each other unexpectedly in nooks and dips and sunny silences, where the wind purred and gentled and went softly. When the sun began to hang low, sending great fan-like streamers of radiance up to the zenith, we foregathered in a tiny, sequestered valley, full of young green fern, lying {{in the shadow of}} a wooded hill. In it was a shallow pool--a glimmering <b>green</b> <b>sheet</b> of water on whose banks nymphs might dance as blithely as ever they did on Argive hill or in Cretan dale. There we sat and stripped the faded leaves and stems from our spoil, making up the blossoms into bouquets to fill our baskets with sweetness. The Story Girl twisted a spray of divinest pink in her brown curls, and told us an old legend of a beautiful Indian maiden who died of a broken heart when the first snows of winter were falling, because she believed her long-absent lover was false. But he came back in the spring time from his long captivity; and when he heard that she was dead he sought her grave to mourn her, and lo, under the dead leaves of the old year he found sweet sprays of a blossom never seen before, and knew that it was a message of love and remembrance from his dark-eyed sweet-heart.|$|E
60|$|Did time, and {{advancing}} years, {{and feelings}} {{that had become}} deadened by experience, contribute to render the view less striking, less grand, in any way less pleasing than we had hoped to find it? So far from this, all our expectations were much more than realized. In one particular, touching which we do not remember ever to have seen anything said, we were actually astonished at the surpassing glory of Niagara. It was the character of sweetness, if we can so express it, that glowed over the entire aspect of the scene. We were less struck with the grandeur of this cataract, than with its sublime softness and gentleness. To water in agitation, use had so long accustomed us, perhaps, as in some slight degree to lessen the feeling of awe that is apt to come over the novice in such scenes; but we at once felt ourselves attracted by the surpassing loveliness of Niagara. The gulf below was more imposing than we had expected to see it, but it was Italian in hue and softness, amid its wildness and grandeur. Not a drop of the water that fell down that precipice inspired terror; for everything appeared to us {{to be filled with}} attraction and love. Like Italy itself, notwithstanding so much that is grand and imposing, the character of softness, and the witchery of the gentler properties, is the power we should ascribe to Niagara, in preference to that of its majesty. We think this feeling, too, is more general than is commonly supposed, for we find those who dwell near the cataract playing around it, even to the very verge of its greatest fall, with a species of affection, as if they had the fullest confidence in its rolling waters. Thus it is that we see the little steamer, the Maid of the Mist, paddling up quite near to the <b>green</b> <b>sheet</b> of the Horse-Shoe itself, and gliding down in the current of the vortex, as it is compelled to quit the eddies, and come more in a line with the main course of the stream. Wires, too, are suspended across the gulf below, and men pass it in baskets. It is said that one of these inventions is to carry human beings over the main fall, so that the adventurer may hang suspended in the air, directly above the vortex. In this way do men, and even women, prove their love for the place, all of which we impute to its pervading character of sweetness and attraction.|$|E

The dispersion state and viscosity of PAA-NH 4 -added PZT aqueous slurries strongly depended on the slurry pH. Well-dispersed PZT slurries with negligibly small Pb 2 + dissolution were obtained in the alkaline side due to the electrostatic steric hindrance effect of adsorbed polyelectrolyte dispersant molecules with a high dissociation ratio of carboxylic acid groups. The homogeneous dense microstructure and the enhancement of the piezoelectric properties of PZT ceramic bodies were achieved by preparing the aqueous PZT slurry with an optimum amount of dispersant.

Especially, if that's the point to increase the signal propagation speed and to match the thermal expansion to the silicon ship. The project that corresponds to this trend deals with development of a glass-ceramic composite, that has a low dielectric constant (4 - 5), a low thermal expansion coefficient (3 - 4. 10 "-" 6 K"-" 1), a thermal conductivity of #>=# 2 W/mK, a low porosity of < 2 % and a low surface roughness.
