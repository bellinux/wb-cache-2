In order {{to investigate the}} causes and control methods of the <b>drive</b> <b>line,</b> the box-shaped part with curved bottom was designed based on the shape characteristics of automobile panel. Then this part was taken as an experimental model to analyze the causes and forming process of the <b>drive</b> <b>line</b> on its surface. Finally, influencing laws on the <b>drive</b> <b>line</b> from the draw bead, the important forming process parameter, were obtained by the experiments. The {{results showed that the}} draw bead has great impact on the <b>drive</b> <b>line.</b> Different setting ways of the draw beads can make good control for the formation, displacement and its direction of the <b>drive</b> <b>line.</b> Besides, it is an important way for setting the draw beads properly to prevent the stamping parts from the formation of the <b>drive</b> <b>line...</b>|$|R

40|$|The 'hydrid' is {{a fairly}} new serial {{hydraulic}} hybrid <b>drive</b> <b>line</b> concept. The term ‘hydrid’ is used for hydraulic <b>drive</b> <b>lines</b> in which four constant displacement Floating Cup (FC) wheel drive units are pressure controlled by means of two Innas Hydraulic Transformers (IHT). It {{has been shown in}} earlier publications that a four wheel <b>drive</b> hydrid <b>drive</b> <b>line</b> with wheel hub motors realises reductions of fuel consumption and CO 2 emission of more than 50 %. In modern passenger cars, there is a large gap between - on one hand - the engine power and wheel torque necessary to fulfil the maximum performance requirements and - on the other hand - the quite modest power and torque demand in normal, every-day use. This gap is the main reason for the rather bad energy efficiency of modern passenger cars. Contrary to other hybrid concepts, the hydrid can bridge this gap and achieve large reductions without compromising performance. This paper shows how the use of floating cup technology, the pressure amplification capability of the Innas hydraulic transformer (IHT) and a four wheel <b>drive</b> <b>line</b> topology, come together to realise this. After that a serial hydrid front wheel <b>drive</b> <b>line</b> is presented, which can realise similar reductions but uses only one IHT and two FC drive units, which attach to the front axle differential. Finally, some ideas for other serial hydrid <b>drive</b> <b>lines</b> are given...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} ofthis {{research is}} to demonstrate a practical approach to balance and synchronize a monitor assembly line which is characterized by several manufacturing constraints. The constraints as such could lower production rates ofthe line ifthey are not considered as integrated parts ofthe whole system. The research begins with manufacturing constraint analysis to identifr which one has the most impact and govems the productivity of the line. The output of the analysis is then used for comparing the efficiency between single-model assembly line balancing and multi-model assembly line balancing approaches. In addition, the algorithms to balance the line, i. e. COMSOAL and the current factory method, are compared. The research enquiry is investigated by computer simulation. An experimental design with 3 factors, namely line balancing methods, line balancing algorithms, and conveyor speeds, are conducted to evaluate the significance ofthe factors measured {{by the number of}} stations, <b>line</b> <b>efficiency,</b> output, and throughput time. It is found that the number of stations used in the multi-model assembly line balancing is less than the single-model one. In addition, the line balancing methods and line balancing algorithms provide significant enhancements to <b>line</b> <b>efficiency,</b> output, and throughput time. The multi-model assembly line balancing combined with COMSOAL method contributes to higher <b>line</b> <b>efficiency,</b> higher output, and less throughput time. Moreover, the conveyor speeds only influence the throughput time, without any impact on <b>line</b> <b>efficiency</b> and output. Key words: Multi-model line-balancing, Computer simulation. 1...|$|R
