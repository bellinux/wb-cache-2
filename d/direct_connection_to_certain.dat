40|$|Non-Commutative (NC) {{effects in}} planar quantum {{mechanics}} are investigated. We have constructed a Master {{model for a}} noncommutative harmonic oscillator by embedding it in an extended space, following the Batalin-Tyutin [5] prescription. Different gauge choices lead to distinct NC structures, such as NC coordinates, NC momenta or noncommutativity of a more general kind. In the present framework, all of these can be studied in a unified and systematic manner. Thus the dual nature of theories having different forms of noncommutativity is also revealed. Keywords: Noncommutative quantum mechanics, Constraint systems, Batalin-Tyutin quantization. Introduction: Non-Commutative (NC) Quantum Field Theories (QFT) [1] have {{created a lot of}} interest in the High Energy Physics community because of its <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> <b>to</b> <b>certain</b> low energy limits of String theory [2]. Noncommutativity is induced in the open string boundaries that are attached to D-branes, in the presence of a two-form background field. This phenomenon in turn renders the D-branes into NC manifolds. Stringy effects are manifested i...|$|E
40|$|Effects of noncommutativity are {{investigated}} in planar quantum mechanics in the coordinate representation. Generally {{these issues are}} addressed by converting to the momentum space. In {{the first part of}} the work we show noncommutative effects in a Gaussian wavepacket through the broadening of its width. We also rederive results on ∗-product of Gaussian wavepackets. In the second part, we construct a ”Master ” model for a noncommutative harmonic oscillator by embedding it in an extended space. Different gauge choices leading to different forms of noncommutativity, (such as between coordinates only, between momenta only or noncommutativity of a more general kind), can be studied in a unified and systematic manner. Thus the dual nature of these theories are also revealed. Keywords: Noncommutative quantum mechanics, Constraint systems, Batalin-Tyutin quantization.
