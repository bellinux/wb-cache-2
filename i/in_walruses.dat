In other odontocetes, parts of the frontal and maxillae cover the temporal fossae. In Odobenocetops, these bones are reduced and narrowed so that the temporal fossae is open dorsally. The periotic and tympanic bones are similar to those in other dolphins. No mandible has been recovered and only few postcranial elements.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2008 With ongoing climate change, food {{resources}} {{may be reduced}} for Pacific walruses (Odobenus rosmarus divergens). Significant differences in walrus foraging habitat (benthic communities) or diet might indicate changes in prey quality or quantity. In this study, benthic infaunal biomass, abundance, and composition were compared between 1970 - 1974 and 2006 at stations southwest of St. Lawrence Island. Sediment grain size was compared because it strongly determines benthic community structure. Wet weights, counts, and species composition of prey items found in stomachs of walruses collected near the island were compared between the 1980 s and 2007. Benthic invertebrate biomass and abundance increased mainly due to high Nuculidae biomass and abundance, although results may be skewed by low sample size. Silt fractions increased regionally. No significant dietary differences were detected <b>in</b> <b>walruses.</b> Walruses may have undergone a population redistribution or decline in response to benthic community changes that would be undetected in stomach content analyses...|$|E
40|$|Herein {{we report}} results from studies on {{walruses}} in Svalbard conducted in 2000 - 2010. Data from newly developed satellite relay data loggers (SRDLs) revealed seasonal differences in habitat use of adult male walruses. During winter, {{they moved into}} areas of > 90 % ice concentration, traveling as far as 600 km from ice-free water. Breeding areas deep into the pack ice were identified based on timing of the occupancy and diving behaviour. When the breeding season was over, walruses with SRDLs that were still transmitting locations returned to the coast, showing high site fidelity to the previous year’s summering area. Haul-out data from the SRDLs provided correction factors for an aerial survey of walruses that covered all known haul-out sites within the Svalbard Archipelago. This survey estimated 2, 629 (95 % CI; 2, 318 – 2, 998) walruses to be in Svalbard during August 2006. Blubber biopsies from adult male walruses analyzed for fatty acids (FAs) showed vertical stratification similar to that observed in many other marine mammals. However, differences between layers were less pronounced, possibly because the thick dermis of walruses provides an insulating shield, affecting the FA composition of the outer blubber. The FA composition of the inner blubber most closely resembled the lipids in Mya truncata and Buccinum spp., which are considered the most important walrus prey in Svalbard. A study investigating the use of skin biopsies for assessing levels of organochlorines (OCs) <b>in</b> <b>walruses</b> found {{a significant relationship between}} OC levels in skin and blubber. Another contaminant study found a significant decrease in levels of PCBs and DDE <b>in</b> <b>walruses</b> in Svalbard from 1993 to 2002 - 04. Large inter-individual variation in OC levels was found, although all of the study animals were adult males from roughly the same location. In FA analyses of the inner blubber this variation appeared to be diet-related, with high OC levels having FA compositions in the inner blubber that closely matched seal tissues, while those with low levels matched typical invertebrate prey. Various enzymes, proteins, metabolites, minerals, and hormones were measured in blood samples to serve as baseline data for future health-related studies of both wild and captive walruses. Historical sex-distribution of walruses in southern Svalbard was investigated based on mandible measurements of individuals hunted during the 19 th century. The analyses showed that female walruses were once more common in south-eastern Svalbard than they are today. </p...|$|E

40|$|Walruses, Odobenus rosmarus, play a {{key role}} in the Arctic ecosystem, {{including}} northern Indigenous communities, which are reliant upon walruses for aspects of their diet and culture. However, walruses face varied environmental threats including rising sea-water temperatures and decreasing ice cover. An underappreciated threat may be the large amount of solar ultraviolet radiation (UV) that continues to reach the Arctic as a result of ozone loss. UV has been shown to negatively affect whales. Like whales, walrus skin is unprotected by fur, but in contrast, walruses spend long periods of time hauled-out on land. In this study, we combined the results of histological analyses of skin sections from five Atlantic walruses, Odobenus rosmarus rosmarus, collected in Nunavik (Northern Quebec, Canada) with qualitative data obtained through the interviews of 33 local walrus hunters and Inuit Elders. Histological analyses allowed us to explore UV-induced cellular lesions and interviews with experienced walrus hunters and Elders helped us to study the incidences and temporal changes of UV-induced gross lesions <b>in</b> <b>walruses.</b> At the microscopic scale, we detected a range of skin abnormalities consistent with UV damage. However, currently such UV effects do not seem to be widely observed at the whole-animal level (i. e., absence of skin blistering, erythema, eye cataract) by individuals interviewed. Although walruses may experience skin damage under normal everyday UV exposure, the long-term data from local walrus hunters and Inuit Elders did not report a relation between the increased sun radiation secondary to ozone loss and walrus health...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2014 The {{changing}} Arctic ecosystem may prompt Pacific walruses (Odobenus rosmarus divergens) {{to change}} their usual diet of lower trophic level prey (e. g., benthic invertebrates) by increasing the consumption of higher trophic level prey (HTLP). Prey-switching may have consequences to walrus populations through increased energetic costs, increased stress response, declines in body condition, and exposure to diseases, including the zoonotic parasite Trichinella spp. Trichinella is possibly transmitted to walruses via predation or scavenging on seals. The goal {{of this study was}} to quantify reliance on HTLP using stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios, and assess potential correlations among consumption of HTLP and sea ice extent, sex, Trichinella infection, body lipid stores, and cortisol concentrations used as an index of the stress response. Walrus diet is comprised of ~ 1 - 22 % HTLP and reliance on HTLP may be correlated with sea ice extent in a complex way. Trichinella was present in ringed seal (Pusa hispida, 1 / 57), Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus, 3 - 7 / 32), and polar bear (Ursus maritimus, 1 / 1), but was not detected <b>in</b> <b>walruses</b> (0 / 137) regardless of %HTLP in the diet. Walrus blubber and attached skin contained 44. 6 ± 12. 4 % lipid wet weight, which was lower than that found for other Arctic marine mammals; however, the inclusion of skin likely decreased our %lipid values. While the absolute value of %lipid from blubber and attached skin was not a suitable substitute for %lipid from blubber only, we were still able to detect the influence of biological factors, with sex-linked variability in walrus lipid stores observed. Cortisol analysis from full-thickness blubber resulted in a wide range of concentrations (2. 77 to 34. 04 ng/g), but showed that this stress hormone can be extracted from blubber. While neither %lipid nor blubber cortisol was correlated with the proportion of HTLP in walrus diet, they may serve as minimally-invasive methods for health monitoring of walruses. Overall, dietary plasticity of walruses is robust and switching to HTLP is not likely to have immediate adverse effects on the Pacific walrus population...|$|E

40|$|Until {{recently}} Atlantic walruses (Odobenus rosmarus rosmarus) {{have been}} subject to relatively intense exploitation in West Greenland. Animals in this stock have also been hunted in Nunavut/Canada. However, the demographic identity of these animals and their connection with <b>walruses</b> <b>in</b> neighbouring areas is poorly resolved, hampering the determination of sustainable harvest levels. It has been suggested that <b>walruses</b> <b>in</b> West Greenland are genetically linked with walruses at SE Baffin Island (Canada) where they are also hunted for subsistence purposes. To determine the relationship(s) between <b>walruses</b> <b>in</b> these areas we conducted a genetic analysis including recent samples from West Greenland, Southeast Baffin Island in western Davis Strait, Hudson Strait in Canada and Northwest Greenland in northern Baffin Bay. Seventeen microsatellite markers were applied to all samples. <b>Walruses</b> <b>in</b> West Greenland and at Southeast Baffin Island did not differ from each other and therefore may be regarded as belonging to the same stock. However, <b>walruses</b> <b>in</b> these two areas differed genetically from both Northwest Greenland and Hudson Strait walruses. These findings support (1) that there are subunits within the range of <b>walruses</b> <b>in</b> the Hudson Strait-Davis Strait-Baffin Bay region and (2) that walruses along E Baffin Island and W Greenland constitute a common population that receive some influx from Hudson Strait. Thus, sustainable catch levels in Southeast Baffin Island (Nunavut) and in West Greenland must be set in light of the finding that they belong to the same stock, which is exploited in these two areas. This requires Canadian-Greenlandic co-management of the W Greenland-SE Baffin Island walrus stock. </p...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{chemical}} composition of animal tissues such as teeth appears to reflect an individual’s exposure to its geochemical environment. In this study, the lead (Pb) isotope composition of dental cementum {{was used to}} investigate the stock structure of Atlantic walrus (Odobenus rosmarus rosmarus) in the Canadian Arctic and Greenland. The 12 communities providing walrus samples for this study represent most of the Canadian and Greenlandic villages where walrus still form {{an important part of}} the traditional Inuit diet. Significant differences between locations in mean Pb isotope ratios and the limited overlap of the ranges of values indicate that each village harvested walrus herds that exploited substantially different geological/geographical habitats. This geographic segregation based on isotopic signatures suggests that most walrus stocks (i. e., the groups of walrus that interact with hunters at each community) are more localized in their range than previously thought. 208 Pb/ 207 Pb and 208 Pb/ 204 Pb were the most important stock discriminators, reflecting the influence of local geological Th/U composition (i. e., 208 Pb) on Pb isotope composition <b>in</b> <b>walrus</b> teeth. 204 Pb-based isotope ratios <b>in</b> <b>walrus</b> were consistently higher (more radiogenic) and more homogeneous than those in regional terrestrial bedrock, a difference probably due to selective leaching of radiogenic Pb from mineral phases into seawater and mixing during weathering and transport.
