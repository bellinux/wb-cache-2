Work proceeded quickly, and the ship was launched on 11 December 1915. After the completion of fitting-out work, the ship was commissioned <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>High</b> Seas Fleet on 2 April 1916. Bremse followed her sister the same year at AG Vulcan. She was launched on 11 March 1916 and completed {{in less than four}} months; the ship was commissioned into the fleet on 1 July 1916.

5|$|Grosser Kurfürst {{was ordered}} under the {{provisional}} name Ersatz Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm and {{built at the}} AG Vulcan shipyard in Hamburg under construction number 4. Her keel was laid in October 1911 and she was launched on 5 May 1913. At her launching ceremony, Prince Oskar of Prussia christened the ship. Due to the heightening political tensions in Europe in mid-1914, the final construction work was accelerated, so {{the first set of}} dockyard trials were conducted on 15 July, and fitting-out work was completed by the 30th, the day she was commissioned <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>High</b> Seas Fleet. Grosser Kurfürst cost the Imperial German Government 45 million Goldmarks.|$|E
5|$|In 1912, the Russian Navy sought {{builders}} {{for a pair}} {{of light}} cruisers; the Schichau-Werke shipyard in Danzig won the contract. The two ships were originally ordered by the Russian Navy as Maraviev Amurskyy and Admiral Nevelskoy from the Schichau-Werke that year. The two ships were laid down in 1913; Maraviev Amurskyy was launched on 11 April 1914, after which fitting-out work commenced. Both ships were requisitioned by the German Navy on 5 August 1914, and were renamed Pillau and Elbing, respectively. Elbing was launched on 21 November 1914.

After the battle, the four surviving ships {{were removed from the}} front-line fleet and employed in secondary tasks. The Treaty of Versailles permitted Germany to retain several old battleships for coastal defense, including the four Deutschland-class ships.|$|E

5|$|Although no {{missions}} {{were actually}} located along the Santa Ana River or within the watershed, the river basin was nearly depleted of native people because the Spanish {{forced them to}} work at nearby missions, including Mission San Gabriel Arcangel and Mission San Luis Rey. The affected tribes were usually renamed after the missions, resulting in tribal names such as Gabrieliño and Luiseño. Difficult working and living conditions and European diseases such as smallpox killed much of the native population during the roughly 50-year-long Mission Period. The Secularization Act of 1833, passed by the newly independent country of Mexico, eventually brought {{an end to the}} Mission Period. The post-Mission Period native population was almost entirely devastated. The population was very little, their native religions were nearly lost, and most of their land had been taken by Spanish settlers. Although the Mexican government's original intention with the Secularization Act was to provide the Native Americans with their own land and property, most of the provisions made by the act never actually happened. Spanish settlers continued to press into the remaining tribal lands, and eventually, the tribes were forced into the surrounding desert lands or <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> mountains.|$|E
5|$|Born in Teddington, {{south-west}} London, Coward {{attended a}} dance academy in London as a child, making his professional stage début {{at the age}} of eleven. As a teenager he was introduced <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> society in which most of his plays would be set. Coward achieved enduring success as a playwright, publishing more than 50 plays from his teens onwards. Many of his works, such as Hay Fever, Private Lives, Design for Living, Present Laughter and Blithe Spirit, have remained in the regular theatre repertoire. He composed hundreds of songs, in addition to well over a dozen musical theatre works (including the operetta Bitter Sweet and comic revues), screenplays, poetry, several volumes of short stories, the novel Pomp and Circumstance, and a three-volume autobiography. Coward's stage and film acting and directing career spanned six decades, during which he starred in many of his own works.|$|E
5|$|Derfflinger was {{constructed}} at Blohm & Voss in Hamburg under construction number 213. She {{was the least}} expensive of the three ships, {{at a cost of}} 56 million gold marks. The ship was ready to be launched on 14 June 1913, but during the ceremony, one of the wooden sledges upon which the hull rested became jammed. It took until 12 July for her to enter the water. She was commissioned <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>High</b> Seas Fleet on 1 September 1914, shortly after the outbreak of World War I. Lützow was built at the Schichau dockyard in Danzig under construction number 885, at the cost of 58million gold marks. The ship was launched on 29 November 1913, and after lengthy trials, commissioned on 8 August 1915. Hindenburg, the final member of the class, was built at the Imperial Dockyard in Wilhelmshaven, under construction number 34. The ship was built at a cost of 59million gold marks, the most expensive of the three vessels. She was launched on 1 August 1915 and commissioned on 10 May 1917.|$|E

5|$|Increasing {{numbers of}} {{mountain}} tourists, ease of access <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> mountain environment, plus promotion and encouragement by tour companies offering ascents of Mont Blanc {{to people with}} little or no previous alpine experience, have led to an increase in mountain accidents and even inappropriate demands to be rescued. With up to 30,000 climbing parties now attempting to ascend Mont Blanc each year, it has gained the reputation of being one of the world's deadliest mountains. Deaths from mountaineering-related accidents across the Mont Blanc massif average almost 100 a year, with the majority occurring on Mont Blanc itself. There have also been various stunts, some of which the local authorities have decried as reckless or stupid. In recent years, guards have been placed on the most popular route of ascent to Mont Blanc's summit at peak periods {{in order to ensure that}} those entering the mountain environment are adequately equipped and skilled. This has led to calls to limit access to the most popular summits and for the mountains to be treated with greater respect.|$|E
5|$|Other {{formations}} {{were also}} formed but were mostly eroded following uplift from the Laramide orogeny which started around 70million years ago (mya). This event created the Rocky Mountains {{far to the}} east and helped to close the sea that covered the area. A large part of western North America started to stretch itself into the nearby Basin and Range topography around 15mya. While not part of this region, the greater Bryce area was stretched <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>High</b> Plateaus by the same forces. Uplift of the Colorado Plateaus and the opening of the Gulf of California by 5mya changed the drainage of the Colorado River and its tributaries, including the Paria River, which is eroding headward in between two plateaus adjacent to the park. The uplift caused the formation of vertical joints which were later preferentially eroded to form the free-standing pinnacles called hoodoos, badlands, and monoliths we see today.|$|E
