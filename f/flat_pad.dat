60|$|Accordingly, {{when his}} father put the two bags of grain upon the horse, and ordered Jemmy to go to mill with them, Jemmy thought that the {{opportunity}} had come. He had observed that the circus riders, instead of a saddle, used upon {{the backs of their}} horses a sort of <b>flat</b> <b>pad,</b> which afforded a much more convenient footing than any saddle; and as to standing on the naked back of a horse, it was manifestly impossible for any body but a rope-dancer. When, however, Jemmy saw his father placing the bags of grain upon the horse, he perceived at once that a good broad and level surface was produced by them, which was much more extended and level, even than the pads of the circus-riders. He instantly resolved, that the moment that he got completely away from the village, he would mount upon the bags and ride standing--and ride so, too, just as long as he pleased.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{a finite}} element sub-modelling method {{is used to}} {{estimate}} the stress distribution and the crack propagation lifetime in Aluminium alloy, Al 7075 -T 6 specimens. Different contact geometries, i. e. cylinder-on-flat and flat-on-flat, and different contact span width's with different pad's compression forces are analysed. It is found that fretting fatigue life for two based cylindrical pads is shorter than that for two based <b>flat</b> <b>pads</b> and in two based <b>flat</b> <b>pads</b> is shorter than that for perfectly <b>flat</b> <b>pads.</b> In the case of two based <b>flat</b> <b>pads,</b> stress distribution in the pad with width of 3. 1 mm is about 14 % higher than that in the pad with the width of 6. 2 mm and about 21 % higher than that in the pad with the width of 9. 3 mm. Similarly, stress in cylindrical pads with width of 3. 1 mm is 36 % higher than that in the pad with width of 6. 2 mm and 130 % higher than that in the pad with width of 9. 3 mm. Stresses increased by 21 % for pad force of 1800 N and around 40 % for pad force 2400 N compared with 1200 N pad force. Also {{it is observed that}} by increasing pad width for both <b>flat</b> and cylindrical <b>pads,</b> crack propagation lifetime increased. Furthermore, fretting fatigue crack growth rate raises when pads compression force increases...|$|R

40|$|A recent {{assessment}} of suprathermal electron heat flux dropouts (HFDs) {{in the solar}} wind eliminated 90 % as possible signatures of field lines disconnected from the Sun at both ends (Pagel et al., 2005 b). The primary reason for elimination was {{the presence of a}} residual field-aligned strahl presumably signaling field lines connected to the Sun. Using high-time-resolution data from the Wind spacecraft, this paper tests whether the residual strahls were an artifact of averaging over pitch angle distributions (PADs) with and without strahls. An automated search for <b>PADs</b> without strahls (<b>flat</b> <b>PADs)</b> yields an occurrence rate of only 14 % within HFDs, but a detailed case study shows that these <b>flat</b> <b>PADs</b> are imbedded within intervals of nearly <b>flat</b> <b>PADs,</b> that is, PADS with residual strahls that cannot be artifacts of averaging. An attractive alternative is that the residual strahls result from intermixing of originally back-scattered fluxes (haloes) of unequal intensities on field lines that have either disconnected or interchange reconnected at the Sun. A reevaluation of reported streaming of higher-energy electrons in HFDs suggests a similar cause. While the high-time-resolution data show high variability of PAD profiles within HFDs, this paper reopens the possibility that a substantial fraction signal disconnection or interchange reconnection. Estimated occurrence rates of fields having undergone these processes based upon published HFD rates are of the same order of magnitude as the surprisingly low values of 1 - 5 % recently predicted by a model of a balanced heliospheric flux budget (Owens and Crooker, 2007) ...|$|R

40|$|The elastic {{properties}} of gum rubber and fluoroelastomers were studied {{by a variety}} of numerical and experimental methods. Results were applied to the design of <b>flat</b> pressure <b>pads</b> for microelectronic applications. The goal was to develop an understanding sufficient that designers could quickly develop acceptable fluoroelastomer pressure pads without further detailed studies. The effort centered on optimizing the performance of a 14 mm square by 0. 8 mm thick pad under a fixed normal force. The primary optimization criterion was minimization of the maximum normal contact stresses applied by the pad to a rigid surface. Judicious perforation of <b>flat</b> <b>pads</b> greatly reduced adverse contact stress gradients. The preferred design used four 1. 2 mm holes symmetrically arrayed in a 4 mm square grid centered on the pad.

50|$|In this method, {{the bottom}} V-die is {{replaced}} by a <b>flat</b> <b>pad</b> of urethane or rubber. As the punch forms the part, the urethane deflects and allows the material to form around the punch. This bending method has a number of advantages. The urethane will wrap the material around the punch and the end bend radius will be very close to the actual radius on the punch. It provides a non-marring bend and is suitable for pre-painted or sensitive materials. Using a special punch called a radius ruler with relieved areas on the urethane U-bends greater than 180° can be achieved in \ne hit, something that is not possible with conventional press tooling. Urethane tooling should be considered a consumable item and while they are not cheap, they are {{a fraction of the cost}} of dedicated steel. It also has some drawbacks, this method requires tonnage similar to bottoming and coining and does not do well on flanges that are irregular in shape, that is where the edge of the bent flange is not parallel to the bend and is short enough to engage the urethane pad.|$|E
50|$|They {{can come}} in many {{different}} configurations {{from that of a}} pure race boat to that of a recreational craft. A padded v-hull is very similar in basic shape to the popular v-hull which simply forms a vee when looking {{at the back of the}} watercraft. The difference in design with the padded v-hull is that where the point of the vee would be on the bottom of a plain v-hull there is a flat area ranging from six to ten inches wide. When looking at a padded v-hull from underneath, the front of the hull shows a vee which slowly starts to taper and blend back to the <b>flat</b> <b>pad</b> area. This back portion of the hull is the pad and it will protrude from the vee surface one-half to one-full inch. The pad more efficiently provides hydrodynamic lift due to very low deadrise planing surface, compared to the vee hull lifting surfaces. This highly efficient lift helps to unwet the less efficient vee sections hull which reduces drag tremendously. It uses hydrodynamic pressure to ride higher in the water. As the boats speed increases, water pressure builds on the flat surface of the pad causing the boat to ride higher in the water and ultimately the boat will be riding on just the pad area. At low speeds these hulls ride and handle just the same as a regular v-hull of the same size and weight. Once speeds increase the padded hull will out accelerate and have a higher top speed than a plain v-hull since the padded hull has less drag once speeds increase.|$|E

The transition from the Hertzian configuration to the contact between a nominally <b>flat</b> <b>pad</b> and contacting flat surface is discussed, and {{it is found that}} the strength of the contact decays surprisingly slowly.

One of these includes rectangular recesses, compared to designs with no recesses, significantly improves stiffness and is superior to spherical recesses [13].

Wang et al. [16] focused on the interaction of shock waves with boundary layer, which caused the instability of aerostatic bearing with orifice restrictor. Xiong et al.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{fretting}} fatigue pad is simulated as a flat punch having rounded corners. The contact problem is solved {{under conditions of}} normal loading and a shearing force, less than that necessary to cause full sliding. Further, the interior stress state induced is found, and it is shown that, unless the corner radius becomes vanishingly mall, the stress field {{in the region of}} the pad corners is well defined. A crack is then inserted in the region of high tension, and a solution for the crack-tip stress intensity factor found, using the method of distributed dislocations. Thus, a complete solution in mechanics is generated for a nominally <b>flat</b> <b>pad,</b> most often used in {{fretting fatigue}} experiments, but having a slightly modified geometry. Finally, issues regarding design against fretting fatigue are discussed: it is concluded that the use of this geometry is generally highly recommended, as a optimum between the Hertzian, and the limit flat geometries. This advantage was not evident from a stress field analysis...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} qualitative elastoplastic simulations {{and analyses}} of fretting fatigue. Three hardening constitutive models are considered, {{and their effects}} on stick–slip conditions and lifetime prediction are compared. The computational analysis consists of the estimation of the shakedown limit cycle and the fatigue prediction using Dang Van or Crossland criterion. A particular configuration, the interaction of a <b>flat</b> <b>pad</b> with rounded corners in contact with a flat substrate made, respectively, of Inconel In 718 and Titanium Ti 64 alloys, is studied. The shakedown state is analysed using the cyclic and ratcheting equivalent strain concepts already discussed in the literature. In the paper, different fretting maps, based on slip, shakedown and fatigue regimes, are numerically produced and analysed. A new variable, the global slip percentage, is proposed for the characterization of the stick–slip regimes. Analyses {{of a series of}} slip maps show that the different hardening models do not introduce significant changes in the stick–slip conditions. Using finite element method simulations combined with fatigue limit criteria (Dang Van and Crossland), fretting fatigue maps are qualitatively reproduced. The main contribution of this work is a comparative discussion on the influence of the hardening models complexity on such maps...|$|E
40|$|Fretting fatigue is a phenomenon, {{in which}} two contact {{surfaces}} undergo a small relative oscillatory motion due to cyclic loading. There {{is a need to}} analyze the effects of contact geometry on crack propagation under fretting fatigue condition. In this investigation, a finite element modeling method was used to study the effects of different contact geometries along with crack-contact interaction on crack propagation lifetime. Different contacts geometries, i. e. cylindrical on flat and flat on flat along with different contact-span width were analyzed. Also effects of different contact-span on stress distribution at contact interface were investigated. The computed crack propagation life was compared with experimental results. It was found that the crack initiated near the contact trailing edge for all contact geometries, which completely matches with experimental observations. In terms of crack propagation for different contact-spans, it was realized that fretting fatigue life for two based cylindrical pad was shorter than that for two-based <b>flat</b> <b>pad.</b> Also by increasing contact-span width for both flat and cylindrical pads, crack propagation lifetime increases.
