5|$|Solidarity lending is a {{cornerstone}} of microcredit, and the system is now used in more than 43 countries. Although each borrower must belong to a five-member group, the group {{is not required to}} give any guarantee for a loan to its members. Repayment responsibility rests solely on the individual borrower. The group and the centre oversee that everyone behaves responsibly and none gets into a repayment problem. No formal joint liability exists, i.e. group members are not obliged to pay on behalf of a defaulting member. But, in practice the group members often contribute the defaulted amount with an intention to collect the money from the defaulted member at a later time. Such behaviour is encouraged because Grameen does not extend <b>further</b> <b>credit</b> to a group in which a member defaults.|$|E
5|$|The year 1720 {{brought an}} end to {{external}} threats to Rogers' rule. With Spain and Britain at peace again, the Spanish made no further move against the Bahamas. Vane never returned, having been shipwrecked and captured in the Bay Islands—a year later, he was hanged in Jamaica. This did not end Rogers' problems as governor. Overextended from financing New Providence's defences, he received no assistance from Britain, and merchants refused to give him <b>further</b> <b>credit.</b> His health suffered, and he spent six weeks in Charleston, South Carolina, hoping to recuperate. Instead, he was wounded in a duel with Captain John Hildesley of HMS Flamborough (1707), a duel caused by disputes between the two on New Providence. Troubled {{by the lack of}} support and communication from London, Rogers set sail for Britain in March 1721. He arrived three months later to find that a new governor had been appointed, and his company had been liquidated. Personally liable for the obligations he had contracted at Nassau, he was imprisoned for debt.|$|E
25|$|The {{removal of}} the horoi clearly {{provided}} immediate economic relief for the most oppressed group in Attica, and it also brought an immediate end to the enslavement of Athenians by their countrymen. Some Athenians had already been sold into slavery abroad and some had fled abroad to escape enslavement – Solon proudly records in verse the return of this diaspora. It has been cynically observed, however, that few of these unfortunates were {{likely to have been}} recovered. It has been observed also that the seisachtheia not only removed slavery and accumulated debt, it also removed the ordinary farmer's only means of obtaining <b>further</b> <b>credit.</b>|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} 1949, {{movie theater}} {{operator}} United Paramount Theatres (UPT) was forced by the U.S. Supreme Court to become an independent entity, separating itself from Paramount Pictures. For its part, ABC {{was on the verge}} of bankruptcy, with only five owned-and-operated stations and nine full-time affiliates. Its revenues, which were related to advertising and were indexed compared to the number of listeners/viewers, failed to compensate for its heavy investments in purchasing and building stations. In 1951, a rumor even mentioned that the network would be sold to CBS. In 1951, Noble held a 58% ownership stake in ABC, giving him $5 million with which to prevent ABC from going bankrupt; as banks refused <b>further</b> <b>credit,</b> that amount was obtained through a loan from the Prudential Insurance Company of America.|$|E
500|$|On July23, 1923, Raphael Beck, who had {{designed}} the seal for the 1901Pan-American Exposition, wrote to Mint Director Scobey {{to complain that}} the reverse design resembled his seal, which he had copyrighted in 1899, and that Beach should be given no <b>further</b> <b>credit</b> for it. The letter was forwarded to the Commission of Fine Arts for comment. In October, Fraser wrote to Beck, stating that he had suggested to Beach that he use figures to represent the continents instead of maps, {{and that he had}} never seen the Pan-American seal until Scobey forwarded the letter. According to Bowers, [...] "A comparison of the 1901 and 1923 designs, however, shows that this was highly unlikely." ...|$|E
2500|$|In early 1980, {{the banks}} refused AMC <b>further</b> <b>credit.</b> Lacking both capital and {{resources}} for the new, truly modern products it needed to offer, the company turned to Renault for a $90million loan (US$ in [...] dollars). By September that year, AMC's U.S. market share had fallen to 1.7%, and in November sales dropped 19.1%. AMC warned stockholders that the company could be bankrupted {{if they did not}} approve a plan for Renault to acquire as much as 59% of the company. On December 16, 1980, AMC shareholders [...] "overwhelmingly approved making the French Government-owned Renault" [...] their company's principal owner.|$|E
50|$|White {{started his}} career in 1973, when he played with Los Angeles-based The Boyz, in a line-up which {{included}} Mick Brown and George Lynch (both of later Dokken fame). He is <b>further</b> <b>credited</b> as being a vocalist in early incarnations of London and Mötley Crüe.|$|R
5000|$|Waters has <b>further</b> <b>credited</b> his {{influences}} as, among others, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Herschell Gordon Lewis, Federico Fellini, William Castle and Ingmar Bergman. He {{has stated}} that he takes {{an equal amount of}} joy and influence from high-brow [...] "art" [...] films and sleazy exploitation films.|$|R

2500|$|The Husker {{defense is}} {{known by the}} {{nickname}} of the [...] "Blackshirts." [...] Depictions of the Blackshirts often include a skull and crossbones. This nickname originated in the early 1960s and continued as {{a reference to the}} black practice jerseys worn by first-string defensive players during practice. This tradition developed when Bob Devaney had Mike Corgan, one of his assistant coaches, find contrastive jerseys to offset the red jerseys worn by the offense in practice. <b>Further</b> <b>credit</b> is given to George Kelly, Devaney's defensive line coach until 1968, who frequently referred to the top defensive unit by the name; eventually the rest of the coaching staff caught on, while the first mention of the Blackshirts in print was not until 1969.|$|E
2500|$|Banks {{refused to}} provide AMC <b>further</b> <b>credit</b> {{to develop new}} {{products}} for the changing marketplace, so AMC turned to Renault for a $90million loan. As the U.S. economy entered the early 1980s recession, AMC {{signed an agreement with}} Renault giving a share in AMC's ownership in exchange for the rights to sell Renault cars in the U.S. During the time when Chrysler received US$1.5billion in loan guarantees when Congress passed the [...] "Chrysler Corporation Loan Guarantee Act of 1979", AMC was not considered by lawmakers to be [...] "too big to fail" [...] and thus the smallest U.S. automaker sought assistance from the French government-owned company. By the end of 1980, Renault held a controlling interest of AMC. Some called it [...] "Franco-American Motors," [...] a pun on the French-American combination and the Franco-American food company.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most direct}} threat to the {{survival}} of the States Army in the months after the lightning advance of the French into the Dutch heartland was a financial one: the three occupied provinces Gelderland, Overijssel, and Utrecht no longer paid the troops that were on their [...] "repartition," [...] which would soon have resulted in the loss of these regiments. Holland therefore agreed to temporarily take over the financing of these troops, on top of the 58% of the costs of the war that it normally already paid. But on the level of the company a different liquidity crisis threatened to ruin the captains. First of all, many [...] "sollicitors-military," [...] afraid they would not be repaid, refused to extend <b>further</b> <b>credit.</b> At the same time the confusion caused by the hasty retreat of the field army behind the Dutch Water Line, combined with the haphazard return of the garrisons of the Dutch fortresses that had so ignominiously capitulated to the French, caused large apparent diminutions of the effective strength of the companies that the captains had to replenish for their own account under the system described above. This threatened to bankrupt many captains, just when they were needed the most. At the behest of William III the government now stepped in to avert this danger which might have resulted in a breakdown of the army. The States of Holland agreed to compensate the captains for the loss of soldiers at a fixed rate, which enabled the captains to bring their companies up to strength again without courting financial ruin. A soldier killed in action would bring 33 guilders (later increased to 50 guilders); a trooper with his horse 150 guilders. This system was continued {{until the end of the}} Dutch Republic in 1795. Henceforth the government bore the [...] "business risk" [...] of war. In exchange the captains lost their entrepreneurial status and were transformed to professional officers in the modern sense, with all that entailed for tightened discipline. The advantage for the army was that its losses (for instance after battles) were much more rapidly replenished, enabling it to maintain a heightened state of readiness.|$|E

50|$|On December 21, 1915, several SPD {{members in}} the Reichstag, the German parliament, voted against the {{authorization}} of <b>further</b> <b>credits</b> to finance World War I, an incident that emphasized existing tensions between the party's leadership and the left-wing pacifists surrounding Hugo Haase and ultimately led to the expulsion of the group from the SPD on March 24, 1916.|$|R
50|$|Having pleaded {{no contest}} to the burglaries of Patridge and Lohan, Nicholas Prugo was sentenced on April 15, 2013 {{to two years in}} prison.

60|$|There came a Saturday when Jimmy, jobless and fundless, dreaded {{his return}} to the Indiana Avenue rooming-house, where he knew the landlady would be eagerly {{awaiting}} him, for he was a week in arrears in his room rent already, and had been warned he could expect no <b>further</b> <b>credit.</b>|$|E
6000|$|For Martin's {{troubles}} were many. The {{aftermath of}} the cub reporter's deed was even wider than Martin had anticipated. The Portuguese grocer refused him <b>further</b> <b>credit,</b> while the greengrocer, who was an American and proud of it, had called him a traitor to his country and refused further dealings with him--carrying his patriotism {{to such a degree}} that he cancelled Martin's account and forbade him ever to attempt to pay it. The talk in the neighborhood reflected the same feeling, and indignation against Martin ran high. No one would have anything to do with a socialist traitor. Poor Maria was dubious and frightened, but she remained loyal. The children of the neighborhood recovered from the awe of the grand carriage which once had visited Martin, and from safe distances they called him [...] "hobo" [...] and [...] "bum." [...] The Silva tribe, however, stanchly defended him, fighting more than one pitched battle for his honor, and black eyes and bloody noses became quite the order of the day and added to Maria's perplexities and troubles.|$|E
5000|$|An {{agent of}} {{musician}} Ray Charles read the ABC news story, and purchased one of Lakey's paintings for Charles. Later, in 2010, Lakey contributed the foreword to the Ray Charles biography, [...] "You Don't Know Me: Reflections of My Father, Ray Charles," [...] by Ray Charles (Jr.) Robinson and Mary Jane Ross, {{in which he}} <b>further</b> <b>credited</b> Charles’ influence upon his early career.|$|R
50|$|The United States {{regularly}} sponsors the spraying {{of large}} amounts of herbicides such as glyphosate over the jungles of Central and South America {{as part of its}} drug eradication programs. Environmental consequences resulting from aerial fumigation have been criticized as detrimental to some of the world's most fragile ecosystems; the same aerial fumigation practices are <b>further</b> <b>credited</b> with causing health problems in local populations.|$|R

5000|$|According to Ludwig von Mises, [...] "There is {{no means}} of {{avoiding}} the final collapse of a boom brought about by credit expansion.
