5|$|After Burebista's death, {{the empire}} {{he had created}} {{dissolved}} into smaller kingdoms. From the reign of Tiberius to Domitian, Dacian activity was reduced into a defensive state. The Romans abandoned plans of mounting an <b>invasion</b> against Dacia. In 86 AD, however, the king Decebalus successfully re-united the Dacian kingdom under his control. Domitian attempted a hasty <b>invasion</b> against the Dacians which ended in disaster. A second <b>invasion</b> later brought peace between Rome and Dacia for nearly a decade, until in 98 AD Trajan became emperor. Trajan also pursued two conquests of Dacia, the first in 101–102 AD which concluded in a Roman victory. Decebalus was forced to agree to harsh terms of peace, but did not honour them. This sparked a second <b>invasion</b> of Dacia in 106 AD which ended {{the independence of the}} Dacian kingdom, and brought about its break-up.|$|E

5|$|Glimmer, Taxable and Big Drum were World War II {{deception}} operations.

5|$|Group Captain James Stagg of the Royal Air Force (RAF) met Eisenhower on {{the evening}} of 4 June. He and his {{meteorological}} team predicted that the weather would improve enough for the <b>invasion</b> to proceed on 6 June. The next available dates with the required tidal conditions (but without the desirable full moon) would be two weeks later, from 18 to 20 June. Postponement of the <b>invasion</b> would have required recalling men and ships already in position to cross the Channel, and would have increased the chance that the <b>invasion</b> plans would be detected. After much discussion with the other senior commanders, Eisenhower decided that the <b>invasion</b> should go ahead on the 6th. A major storm battered the Normandy coast from 19 to 22 June, which would have made the beach landings impossible.|$|E

5|$|In {{the next}} two decades there would be two Persian invasions of Greece, {{including}} some of the most famous battles in history. During the first <b>invasion,</b> Thrace, Macedon and the Aegean islands were added to the Persian Empire, and Eretria was duly destroyed. However, the <b>invasion</b> ended in 490 BC with the decisive Athenian victory at the Battle of Marathon. Between the two invasions, Darius died, and responsibility for the war passed to his son Xerxes I. Xerxes then led the second <b>invasion</b> personally in 480 BC, taking an enormous (although oft-exaggerated) army and navy to Greece. Those Greeks who chose to resist (the 'Allies') were defeated in the twin battles of Thermopylae and Artemisium on land and at sea respectively. All of Greece except the Peloponnesus thus fell into Persian hands, but then seeking to finally destroy the Allied navy, the Persians suffered a decisive defeat at the Battle of Salamis. The following year, 479 BC, the Allies assembled the largest Greek army yet seen and defeated the Persian <b>invasion</b> force at the Battle of Plataea, ending the <b>invasion</b> and the threat to Greece.|$|E

5|$|Operation Overlord was {{the name}} {{assigned}} {{to the establishment of}} a large-scale lodgement on the Continent. The first phase, the amphibious <b>invasion</b> and establishment of a secure foothold, was codenamed Operation Neptune. To gain the air superiority needed to ensure a successful <b>invasion,</b> the Allies undertook a bombing campaign (codenamed Operation Pointblank) that targeted German aircraft production, fuel supplies, and airfields.

5|$|Operations Taxable, Glimmer and Big Drum were {{tactical}} military deceptions {{conducted on}} 6 June 1944 {{in support of}} the Allied landings in Normandy. The operations formed the naval component of Operation Bodyguard, a wider series of tactical and strategic deceptions surrounding the <b>invasion.</b> Small boats, along with aircraft from RAF Bomber Command, simulated <b>invasion</b> fleets approaching Cap d'Antifer, Pas-de-Calais and Normandy. Glimmer and Taxable played on the German belief, amplified by Allied deception efforts over the preceding months, that the main <b>invasion</b> force would land in the Calais region. Big Drum was positioned on the western flank of the real <b>invasion</b> force to try to confuse German forces about the scale of the landings. These operations complemented Operation Titanic, which was intended to confuse the Germans about the D-Day airborne forces.|$|E

40|$|Summary: Biological <b>invasions</b> are a {{widespread}} and significant component of human-caused global environmental change. The extent of <b>invasions</b> of oceanic islands, and their consequences for native biological diversity, {{have long been}} recognized. However, <b>invasions</b> of continental regions also are substantial. For example, more than 2, 000 species of alien plants are established in the continental United States. These <b>invasions</b> represent a human-caused breakdown of the regional distinctiveness of Earth’s flora and fauna- a substantial global change in and of itself. Moreover, there are well-documented examples of invading species that degrade human health and wealth, alter the structure and functioning of otherwise undisturbed ecosystems, and/or threaten native biological diversity. <b>Invasions</b> also interact synergistically with other components of global change, notably land use change. People and institutions working to understand, prevent, and control <b>invasions</b> are carrying {{out some of the}} most important- and potentially most effective- work on global environmental change. _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________...|$|R
