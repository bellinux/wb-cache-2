Getting the tapes out of Iraq proved difficult for Winter and O'Mahoney, who remained in the UK. They had to rely on journalists from many news agencies, especially those in the BBC News's Baghdad Bureau high-risk team, to smuggle the tapes out of Iraq. When curfews were enforced, weeks passed before the producers received new footage because it was impossible <b>for</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>to</b> leave their homes or the country.|$|E

His candle factory went bankrupt and Meucci was forced to unsuccessfully seek funds from rich Italian families. In 1860, he asked his friend Enrico Bandelari to look for Italian capitalists willing to finance his project. However, military expeditions led by Garibaldi in Italy had made the political situation in that country too unstable <b>for</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>to</b> invest. Meucci then published his invention in the New York Italian-language newspaper L'Eco d'Italia, although no copy of such reports have ever been located dating back to searches prior to his court case in the 1880s.|$|E

500|$|Commentators {{have noted}} that the Earthsea novels in general {{received}} less critical attention because they were considered children's books. Le Guin herself took exception to this treatment of children's literature, describing it as [...] "adult chauvinist piggery". In 1976, literary scholar George Slusser criticized the [...] "silly publication classification designating the original series as 'children's literature'". Barbara Bucknall stated that [...] "Le Guin was not writing for young children when she wrote these fantasies, nor yet for adults. She was writing for 'older kids.' But in fact she can be read, like Tolkien, by ten-year-olds and by adults. These stories are ageless because they deal with problems that confront us at any age." [...] Only in later years did A Wizard of Earthsea receive attention from a more general audience. Literary scholar T. A. Shippey {{was among the first}} to treat A Wizard of Earthsea as serious literature, assuming in his analysis of the volume that it belonged alongside works by C. S. Lewis and Fyodor Dostoevsky, among others. Margaret Atwood said that she saw the book as [...] "a fantasy book for adults", and added that although the book could be categorized as either young adult fiction or as fantasy, but since it dealt with themes such as [...] "life and mortality and who are we as human beings", it could be read and enjoyed by anybody older than twelve. The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction echoed this view, saying the series's appeal went [...] "far beyond" [...] the young adults for whom it was written. It went on to praise the book as [...] "austere but vivid", and said the series was more thoughtful than the Narnia books by C. S. Lewis. In his 1980 history of fantasy, Brian Attebery called the Earthsea trilogy [...] "the most challenging and richest American fantasy to date". Slusser described the Earthsea cycle as a [...] "work of high style and imagination", and the original trilogy of books a product of [...] "genuine epic vision". In 1974, critic Robert Scholes compared Le Guin's work favorably to that of C. S. Lewis, saying, [...] "Where C. S. Lewis worked out a specifically Christian set of values, Ursula LeGuin works not with a theology but with an ecology, a cosmology, a reverence for the universe as a self-regulating structure." [...] He added that Le Guin's three Earthsea novels were themselves a sufficient legacy <b>for</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>to</b> leave. In 2014 David Pringle called it [...] "a beautiful story—poetic, thrilling, and profound".|$|E

Ruffalo said, [...] "That's a very difficult moment <b>for</b> <b>anybody,</b> <b>to</b> have all their perceptions completely shattered, but I think the Doctor finally comes to a peace about his inabilities and his downfall, and admits to an admiration for his wife's strengths."
