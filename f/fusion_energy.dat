5|$|LIFE, {{short for}} Laser Inertial <b>Fusion</b> <b>Energy,</b> was a <b>fusion</b> <b>energy</b> effort run at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory between 2008 and 2013. LIFE {{aimed to develop}} the {{technologies}} necessary to convert the laser-driven inertial confinement fusion concept being developed in the National Ignition Facility (NIF) into a practical commercial power plant, a concept known generally as inertial <b>fusion</b> <b>energy</b> (IFE). Two designs were considered, operated as either a pure fusion or hybrid fusion-fission system. LIFE used the same basic concepts as NIF, but aimed to lower costs using mass-produced fuel elements, simplified maintenance, and diode lasers with higher electrical efficiency.|$|E
5|$|The krypton {{fluoride}} laser {{is important}} in nuclear <b>fusion</b> <b>energy</b> research in confinement experiments. The laser has high beam uniformity, short wavelength, and the spot size can be varied to track an imploding pellet.|$|E
5|$|Comparing {{the driver}} energy input to the <b>fusion</b> <b>energy</b> output {{produces}} a number known as <b>fusion</b> <b>energy</b> gain factor, labelled Q. A Q value {{of at least}} 1 {{is required for the}} system to produce net energy. Since some energy is needed to run the reactor, in order for there to be net electrical output, Q has to be at least 3. For commercial operation, Q values much higher than this are needed. For ICF, Qs on the order of 25 to 50 are needed to recoup both the electrical generation losses and the large amount of power used to power the driver. In the fall of 1960, theoretical work carried out at LLNL suggested that gains of the required order would be possible with drivers on the order of 1MJ.|$|E

5000|$|The Tri Alpha {{design is}} based on the colliding beam fusion concept, in which the fuel {{particles}} are accelerated to the required <b>fusion</b> <b>energies</b> directly in a particle accelerator. This contrasts with more common designs that slowly heat a bulk fuel to these temperatures inside a confinement vessel of some sort.|$|R

5|$|In most <b>fusion</b> <b>energy</b> designs, fusion {{neutrons}} {{react with}} a blanket of lithium to breed new tritium for fuel. A major issue with the fission–fusion design is that the neutrons causing fission are no longer available for tritium breeding. While the fission reactions release additional neutrons, these {{do not have enough}} energy to complete the breeding reaction with Li-7, which makes up more than 92% of natural lithium. These lower energy neutrons will cause breeding in Li-6, which could be concentrated from the natural lithium ore. However, the Li-6 reaction only produces one tritium per neutron captured, and more than one T per neutron is needed to make up for natural decay and other losses. Using Li-6, neutrons from the fission would make up for the losses, but only at the cost of removing them from causing other fission reactions, lowering the reactor power output. The designer has to choose which is more important; burning up the fuel through fusion neutrons, or providing power through self-induced fission events.|$|E
25|$|It is {{expected}} this will cause about 20MJ of <b>fusion</b> <b>energy</b> to be released, {{resulting in a}} net <b>fusion</b> <b>energy</b> gain of about 15 (G=Fusion energy/UV laser energy). Improvements in both the laser system and hohlraum design are expected to improve the energy absorbed by the capsule to about 420kJ, which, in turn, could generate up to 100-150MJ of <b>fusion</b> <b>energy.</b> However, the baseline design allows for a maximum of about 45MJ of <b>fusion</b> <b>energy</b> release, due {{to the design of}} the target chamber. This is the equivalent of about 11kg of TNT exploding.|$|E
25|$|If {{matter is}} {{sufficiently}} heated (hence being plasma), fusion reactions may occur due to collisions with extreme thermal kinetic energies of the particles. Thermonuclear weapons produce {{what amounts to}} an uncontrolled release <b>fusion</b> <b>energy.</b> Controlled thermonuclear <b>fusion</b> <b>energy</b> {{has yet to be}} achieved.|$|E

50|$|For {{elements}} {{lighter than}} iron on the periodic table, nuclear <b>fusion</b> releases <b>energy</b> while fission consumes it. For iron, {{and for all}} of the heavier elements, nuclear <b>fusion</b> consumes <b>energy,</b> but nuclear fission releases it. Chemical elements up to the iron peak are produced in ordinary stellar nucleosynthesis. Heavier elements are produced only during supernova nucleosynthesis. This is why we have more iron peak elements than in its neighbourhood.|$|R

25|$|A {{scenario}} {{has been}} presented {{of the effect of}} the commercialization of fusion power on the future of human civilization. ITER and later DEMO are envisioned to bring online the first commercial nuclear <b>fusion</b> <b>energy</b> reactor by 2050. Using this as the starting point and the history of the uptake of nuclear fission reactors as a guide, the scenario depicts a rapid take up of nuclear <b>fusion</b> <b>energy</b> starting after the middle of this century.|$|E
25|$|Another {{aspect of}} <b>fusion</b> <b>energy</b> {{is that the}} cost of {{production}} does not suffer from diseconomies of scale. The cost of water and wind energy, for example, goes up as the optimal locations are developed first, while further generators must be sited in less ideal conditions. With <b>fusion</b> <b>energy</b> the production cost will not increase much even if large numbers of stations are built, because the raw resource (seawater) is abundant and widespread.|$|E

25|$|Only about 20% of the <b>fusion</b> <b>energy</b> yield {{appears in}} the form of charged {{particles}} with the remainder carried off by neutrons, which limits the extent to which direct energy conversion techniques might be applied.|$|E

40|$|The role of {{tensor force}} is {{investigated}} {{by using the}} time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) theory in the collision 16 O+ 40 Ca. The full tensor force is incorporated in our TDHF implementation. The calculations are performed in three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate without any symmetry restrictions. We study the effect of tensor force on Coulomb barrier, upper <b>fusion</b> threshold <b>energy,</b> and energy contribution of the time-odd and tensor terms in Skyrme energy functional. The Coulomb barrier obtained from the energy functional with frozen density approximation is compared with the available experimental data. We find that the tensor force may change the upper <b>fusion</b> threshold <b>energy</b> {{in the order of}} a few MeV for the collision 16 O+ 40 Ca.

25|$|Fusion {{is another}} {{area with a}} history of {{research}} at ORNL, dating back to the 1970s. The <b>Fusion</b> <b>Energy</b> Division pursues short-term goals to develop components such as high temperature superconductors, high-speed hydrogen pellet injectors and suitable materials for future fusion research.
