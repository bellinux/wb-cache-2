25|$|In 1985, W. R. Roush and {{co-workers}} {{found out that}} tartrate modified allylic boronates offer a simple, highly attractive approach to the control of facial selectivity in reactions with chiral and achiral aldehydes. In the following years, W.R. Roush {{and co-workers}} extended this strategy to the synthesis of 2-Butene-1,4-Diols and Anti-Diols. This <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>reaction</b> is known as Rouch asymmetric allylation.|$|E

Suzuki and co-workers extend this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>reaction</b> to other organoboron compounds and other alkenyl, aryl, alkyl halides and triflate. The palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction organoboron compounds and these organic halides to form carbon-carbon bonds are known as Suzuki–Miyaura Cross-Coupling.|$|E

25|$|Acrylamide (C3H5NO; mW: 71.08) when {{dissolved}} in water, slow, spontaneous autopolymerization of acrylamide takes place, joining molecules together by head on tail fashion to form long single-chain polymers. The {{presence of a}} free radical-generating system greatly accelerates polymerization. This <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>reaction</b> is known as vinyl addition polymerisation. A solution of these polymer chains becomes viscous but does not form a gel, because the chains simply slide over one another. Gel formation requires linking various chains together. Acrylamide is carcinogenic, a neurotoxin, and a reproductive toxin. It is also essential to store acrylamide in a cool dark and dry place to reduce autopolymerisation and hydrolysis.|$|E
500|$|Chromium(III) ions tend to form {{octahedral}} complexes. [...] The {{color of}} these complexes {{is determined by}} the ligands attached to the Cr center. [...] Commercially available chromium(III) chloride hydrate is the dark green complex Cl. [...] Closely related compounds have different colors: pale green Cl2 and violet Cl3. If water-free green chromium(III) chloride is dissolved in water, the green solution turns violet after some time as the chloride in the inner coordination sphere is replaced by water. This <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>reaction</b> is also observed with solutions of chrome alum and other water-soluble chromium(III) salts.|$|E

[...] Alex Frail of The Massachusetts Daily Collegian said, [...] "One of his funnier bits, Jeff the Diseased Lung, took aim at the tobacco industry; landed on cigarette packs throughout Australia and on billboards throughout Uruguay; and delivered t-shirts to Togo. The power to spark a movement like Jeff the Diseased Lung isn't shared by Oliver's contemporaries." [...] Jeffrey Wasserman, {{vice president and director}} of RAND Health, opined: [...] "John Oliver's 'Jeff' character is of course a mockery of an iconic figure, the Marlboro Man, whose legacy turned out to be cruelly ironic. As Oliver noted in his show, four former Marlboro men died of smoking-related causes. Let's hope that 'Jeff' going viral causes current and prospective smokers—mainly teens and preteens—to recognize cigarette smoking for what it is: the most deadly habit." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Shelton himself, {{the initial}} idea for [...] "Savior's Shadow" [...] {{came to him}} in his sleep in May 2015. Although the singer did not {{remember}} the exact dream, he recalled [...] "four lines of lyrics and [...] melody", which drew him to [...] "grab his smartphone and s the passage into the memo function before it was lost". He {{enlisted the help of}} married couple Jessi Alexander and Jon Randall to complete the track, who were ironically experiencing changes in their lives, much like Shelton. The finalized recording was done at Shelton's private home in Los Angeles, California in his bedroom's closet for [...] "best effect". Alexander claimed that the track [...] "came deep from Blake's soul" [...] and demonstrated that his tenth studio album If I'm Honest would [...] "be extremely personal". She remarked that the writing became more emotional, as the track was finished [...] "just one month after his divorce from Miranda Lambert". When Shelton released the single on April 8, 2016 through Warner Bros.

Pitchfork Medias writer Jess Harvell criticized the song by writing, [...] "Opener 'Stand Up for Love' is subtitled the '2005 World Children's Day Anthem', which {{should tell you}} all {{you really need to}} know, i.e. Diane Warren should be banned under the Geneva Conventions". Fiona Mckinlay criticized the fact that the song was used as an opener for #1's and felt it wasn't [...] "really causing any <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>reaction</b> before they get started properly with Independent Woman Pt.1". Houston Chronicles Michael D. Clark described the track as [...] "overwrought and overproduced; at best, it's a future prom theme". Matthew Jacobs of The Huffington Post felt it was [...] "great" [...] the song was used for World's Children day but described it as a [...] "total snoozefest". A writer for Billboard magazine commented that the song lacked the potential to become a chart-topper. He went on to describe it as a [...] "schmaltzy AC ballad aiming to display the individual talents" [...] of Destiny's Child's members, adding that it was [...] "ironic" [...] as the group's other songs on the disc focused mainly on production.

At the time, McShane described {{his role in the}} show as the leader of a peace cult, who was also a former warrior that has since renounced violence, also noting that it was a [...] "complete one-off." [...] McShane also revealed that his character would [...] "bring back a much-loved character everybody thinks is dead," [...] leading many to speculate prior to the season that he would either play a role in bringing back Jon Snow, or the Hound, whose fate had also been called into question since his disappearance. McShane was asked about whether there was pressure involved with joining a show that has become an [...] "international hit," [...] with McShane responding [...] "No pressure! It's the most popular TV show in the world, isn't it? I enjoyed meeting showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss – nobody ever expects the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>reaction</b> this has gotten. It's kind of like Deadwood when we started off, but they've managed to go another three seasons. It's interesting because you're a part of the show, but you're not part of the show. I only needed Rory for my scenes, so I didn't meet anybody else in it."

Pew observed [...] " [...] stinks, quite honestly ... The engineer slept through the entire session for a start". In Melbourne, in December 1980 and January 1981, they joined engineer and producer, Tony Cohen, in Armstrong's Audio Visual Studios (A.A.V. Studio 2) and Richmond Recorders, to record their tracks. Music journalist, Toby Creswell, noted that the band [...] "struggled with creating their own identity some of them also began indulging an appetite for alcohol and heroin".

2500|$|Skin-prick {{testing is}} easy to do and results are {{available}} in minutes. Different allergists may use different devices for testing. Some use a [...] "bifurcated needle", {{which looks like a}} fork with two prongs. Others use a [...] "multitest", which may look like a small board with several pins sticking out of it. In these tests, a tiny amount of the suspected allergen is put onto the skin or into a testing device, and the device is placed on the skin to prick, or break through, the top layer of skin. This puts a small amount of the allergen under the skin. A hive will form at any spot where the person is allergic. This test generally yields a positive or negative result. It is good for quickly learning if a person is allergic to a particular food or not, because it detects IgE. Skin tests cannot predict if a reaction would occur or what <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>reaction</b> might occur if a person ingests that particular allergen. They can, however, confirm an allergy in light of a patient's history of reactions to a particular food. Non-IgE-mediated allergies cannot be detected by this method.|$|E

2500|$|British {{director}} Brian Grant {{was hired}} to direct Summer's video for [...] "She Works Hard for the Money". The video was a success, being nominated for MTV Music Video Awards for Best Female Video and Best Choreography; Summer {{became one of the}} first black artists, and the first African-American Female Artist to have her video played in heavy rotation on MTV. Grant would also be hired to direct Summer's Costa Mesa HBO concert special, A Hot Summers Night. Grant who was a fan of the song State of Independence had an idea for a grand finale. He wanted a large chorus of children to join Summer on stage at the ending of the song. His team looked for local school children in Orange County, to create a chorus of 500 students. On the final day of rehearsals, the kids turned up and they had a full rehearsal. [...] According to Grant, [...] "It looked and sounded amazing. It was a very emotional, very tearful experience for everyone who was there." [...] He thought if this was that <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>reaction</b> in rehearsal, then what an impact it would have in the concert. After the rehearsal Grant was informed that he could not use the kids because the concert would end after 10 pm; children could not be licensed to be on stage at such a late hour (California had strict child labor laws in 1983). [...] "It's a moment that I regret immensely: a grand finale concept I came up with that couldn't be filmed in the end". When the final sequence was filmed, Summer's daughter Mimi and her family members joined her on stage for [...] "State of Independence".|$|E
2500|$|Upon release, Sheila Prophet of Record Mirror {{felt the}} album was [...] "worth giving a spin" [...] and said: [...] "This is their {{comeback}} album - the one that'll make 'em or break 'em. It features [...] "Gypsy Roadhog" [...] {{and most of the}} other tracks are in the same vein - solid, rocking numbers, but just not quite distinctive enough {{to make it in the}} same way as [...] "Cum On Feel the Noize" [...] or [...] "Coz I Luv You" [...] did. Part of the problem is that they seem to be trying too hard - laying everything on, instead of sticking with simplicity. The result is that it sounds, heavy, cluttered, even, a bit old-fashioned. Noddy's voice still sounds great, and Dave turns in some pretty nifty guitar, but there's just too much of everything. In the old days, lyrics weren't too important to Slade, but now they're writing songs with meaning." [...] Pete Makowski of New Musical Express wrote: [...] "The band were always on form when they worked within the most basic of formats. Rock and Roll! This album is high energy on a primeval scale. It's got all the ball bustin' riffs you'll find nestling comfortably alongside yer ZZ Tops and Nugents. It's got the same suicidal pace of the Aerosmith Rocks album. It's packed with strong tunes, lotsa potential singles and the lyrical content is more interesting." [...] Tony Ciarochi of Fairbanks Daily News-Miner said: [...] "...their latest album definitely packs the kind of punch that would get that <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>reaction</b> from a crowd of concert goers. Although it is fairly basic rock 'n' roll, the British humor and sarcasm with which it is presented make it a refreshing chance from some of the more bland sledgehammer rock grounds dominant in America." ...|$|E
60|$|From that moment, Dillon was as {{silent as}} the grave. They reached {{the edge of}} the cliffs, without encountering the party that had been sent in quest of Barnstable, and at a point near where they had landed. The old seaman paused an instant on the verge of the precipice, and cast his {{experienced}} eyes along the wide expanse of water that lay before him. The sea was no longer sleeping, but already in heavy motion, and rolling its surly waves against the base of the rocks on which he stood, scattering their white crests high in foam. The cockswain, after bending his looks along the whole line of the eastern horizon, gave utterance to a low and stifled groan; and then, striking the staff of his harpoon violently against the earth, he pursued his way along {{the very edge of the}} cliffs, muttering certain dreadful denunciations, which the conscience of his appalled listener did not fail to apply to himself. It appeared to the latter, that his angry and excited leader sought the giddy verge of the precipice with a sort of wanton recklessness, so daring were the steps that he took along its brow, notwithstanding the darkness of the hour, and the violence of the blasts that occasionally rushed by them, leaving behind a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>reaction,</b> that more than once brought the life of the manacled captive in imminent jeopardy. But it would seem the wary cockswain had a motive for this apparently inconsiderate desperation. When they had made good quite half the distance between the point where Barnstable had landed and that where he had appointed to meet his cockswain, the sounds of voices were brought indistinctly to their ears, in one of the momentary pauses of the rushing winds, and caused the cockswain to make a dead stand in his progress. He listened intently for a single minute, when his resolution appeared to be taken. He turned to Dillon and spoke; though his voice was suppressed and low, it was deep and resolute.|$|E
