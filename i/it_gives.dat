2500|$|The haka, while {{normally}} {{enjoyed by}} spectators, has been criticised as an unsporting attempt to intimidate the opposition before the match begins. [...] However, most teams {{accept that the}} haka is part of rugby's heritage and {{face up to the}} All Blacks during its performance, with both teams standing about 10 metres apart. The 2007 Portuguese Rugby team Captain Vasco Uva said of the haka that [...] " [...] faced <b>it,</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> the respect it deserved and <b>it</b> <b>gave</b> us motivation and we knew if <b>it</b> <b>gave</b> them strength, <b>it</b> was also a point of strength for us." ...|$|R

50|$|The city of Paris {{proved more}} open {{than the state}} to the ideas {{advanced}} by Goubaux, and allowed him to open the establishment called at first the École municipale Francois Ier, changed to Collège Chaptal in 1848.Courses began on 7 October 1844. The school was supervised by a board composed of the director, Prosper Gobaux, and six members of the municipal council.It was located on a site between the Rue Blanche and Rue de Clichy.The school did not conform to the normal pattern of state schools. In its lower, or preparatory classes <b>it</b> <b>gave</b> elementary primary education.In its middle classes <b>it</b> <b>gave</b> advanced primary education, and in its upper classes <b>it</b> <b>gave</b> scientific secondary education. There were also elements of classical secondary education, since <b>it</b> <b>gave</b> some Latin classes.|$|R

5|$|An {{important}} theoretical {{decision for}} White {{is to choose}} whether to play a2–a3. While this move protects the b4 square and threatens the pawn advance b2–b4, it encourages Black's rook lift Ra8–a6–h6. As Lalic puts it:It was {{not so long ago}} that 8.a3, with the obvious intention of expanding with b2–b4, was the standard move. However, after Black responds with the logical a7–a5, it became apparent in tournament practice that the inclusion of these moves is in fact in Black's favour, as <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> his queen's rook access into play via the a6-square.|$|E
5|$|Bromine oxides {{are not as}} {{well-characterised}} as {{chlorine oxides}} or iodine oxides, as they are all fairly unstable: it was once thought {{that they could not}} exist at all. Dibromine monoxide is a dark-brown solid which, while reasonably stable at −60°C, decomposes at its melting point of −17.5°C; it is useful in bromination reactions and may be made from the low-temperature decomposition of bromine dioxide in a vacuum. It oxidises iodine to iodine pentoxide and benzene to 1,4-benzoquinone; in alkaline solutions, <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> the hypobromite anion.|$|E

This long poem, composed between 1940 and 1965, is often critically regarded as her best work and {{also one of}} the finest poems of the twentieth century. <b>It</b> <b>gives</b> a deep and detailed analysis of her epoch and her approach to it, including her important encounter with Isaiah Berlin (1909–97) in 1945. Her talent in composition and translation is evidenced in her fine translations of the works of poets writing in French, English, Italian, Armenian, and Korean.|$|E

I hate when there's too much editing. I like the steadiness of the performance because then you can really enjoy the movement of the body. You see the skill.|$|E
5|$|It is {{generally}} read as being set in India, though <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> no {{details of the}} actual situation. Some {{research has suggested that}} the poem was written with a specific incident in mind, the execution of one Private Flaxman of The Leicestershire Regiment, at Lucknow in 1887. A number of details of this execution correspond to the occasion described by Kipling in the poem, and he later used a story similar to that of Flaxman's as a basis for the story Black Jack.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the finless sleeper ray can {{generate}} a defensive electric shock from paired electric organs in its disc. <b>It</b> <b>gives</b> birth to live young, with the developing embryos nourished by yolk. A litter size of four has been recorded from one individual. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the finless sleeper ray as Vulnerable. This slow-reproducing species is caught by intensive bottom trawl and possibly other fisheries throughout its range, which likely cause high mortality {{regardless of whether it}} is discarded or utilised.|$|E

5|$|Listeners {{unfamiliar}} with contemporary Christian music (CCM) often assume that Loder sings hymn-style music. Her career {{is unusual in}} that it began in CCM; most young musicians choose music genres such as country and pop, which are generally considered more likely to bring commercial success. Loder has asserted that she chose CCM because <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> purpose to her music; many of her songs are about God, but {{they may also be}} interpreted as being about other subjects.|$|E
5|$|Metallic bonding can be {{classified}} {{as a type of}} covalent bonding for which the constituent atoms of the same type and do not combine with one another to form a chemical bond. Atoms will lose an electron(s) forming an array of positive ions. These electrons are shared by the lattice which makes the electron cluster mobile, as the electrons are free to move as well as the ions. For this, <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> metals their relatively high thermal and electrical conductivity as well as being characteristically ductile.|$|E
