5|$|The third letter openly {{incorporates}} Swift's {{argument that}} political authority {{stems from the}} consent of a population. As such, the third letter {{has been seen as}} a response in part to the <b>Declaratory</b> <b>Act,</b> which had undermined the independence and the authority of Irish legislature and judiciary in favour of the British. The <b>Declaratory</b> <b>Act</b> removed the ability for any in Ireland to speak for the people of Ireland, and it was necessary for the act to be removed before the people could be heard.|$|E
5|$|A {{secondary}} rhetorical battle began between Walpole and the Irish {{in regard}} to Wood's patent; {{the rest of the}} constitutional debate was over the nature of Poynings' Law, a law that was brought back into use through the <b>Declaratory</b> <b>Act</b> (1720). Poyning's Law was a law that the British claimed allowed them to control all of Ireland's legal actions and to revoke the Irish parliamentary independence. Traditionally, the rulers of Ireland viewed themselves as a kingdom and not a colony that would be controlled by Poyning's Law. The Drapier agreed with the Irish interpretation of the law and incorporated aspects of Molyneux's arguments that combined proof the law was misinterpreted and Locke's political philosophy.|$|E
5|$|Clashes {{over the}} {{interpretation}} and {{legality of the}} Petition began almost immediately, with the Lords and Commons arguing with the King as early as 20 June 1628, leading to the prorogation of Parliament on the 26th. The Petition of Right was not a formal statute, and despite it being reaffirmed as a bill by the Long Parliament in 1641, {{the legal status of}} the initial Petition has been debated. It has been considered a <b>declaratory</b> <b>act,</b> a private bill, or simply a petition, which permitted an individual harmed by the government to take action against the crown. A petition is the oldest form of Parliamentary proceeding, and the one through which most early statutes were originally passed; the King would be petitioned to take action by Members of Parliament, and would assent to their request; laws passed in this way include Magna Carta and the Statute of Westminster. Whether or not this made it legally binding was debated. Modern historians have either taken two positions on the matter. Either the recognition of the Petition was a judicial matter and at best a private bill, and as such it was not binding on the King or on Parliament, or it had the strength of a public bill; it was a legislative act, and as such legally binding.|$|E

40|$|This Article {{examines}} the Court 2 ̆ 7 s treatment of declaratory judgment actions. It {{demonstrates that the}} Court 2 ̆ 7 s ‘procedural only’ view of the Act frustrates congressional intent and is neither analytically sound nor practical. Part I discusses the general rules governing federal question jurisdiction and the Court 2 ̆ 7 s method for dealing with declaratory judgment cases. Part II explores the history and purpose of the <b>Declaratory</b> Judgment <b>Act</b> {{and its relationship to}} federal question jurisdiction. This study demonstrates that the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s assumptions about the jurisdictional import of the <b>Declaratory</b> Judgment <b>Act</b> find no support in the legislative history. Further, it shows that the Court 2 ̆ 7 s stated approach to subject matter jurisdiction questions in declaratory judgment cases is directly in conflict with Congress 2 ̆ 7 s intentions. Part III {{examines the}} Court 2 ̆ 7 s confused treatment of declaratory judgment cases. It shows that, while professing to allow the <b>Declaratory</b> Judgment <b>Act</b> no jurisdictional effect, the Court has endorsed cases and procedures that permit the Act to expand federal question jurisdiction. Thus, in limited situations the Court has given effect to congressional intent, albeit unintentionally. Part IV shows that the anomaly created by the Court can only be reconciled with congressional intent by giving the Act the full jurisdictional effect Congress clearly contemplated. This solution is contrary to the Court 2 ̆ 7 s express position, but is the only way in which the true purpose of the <b>Declaratory</b> Judgment <b>Act</b> can be served...|$|R
25|$|Under the 1911 Act, Parliament (that is, the Commons and the Lords acting together) {{delegated}} {{its ability}} to pass legislation to another body (the Commons alone). Following legal principles established when the United Kingdom granted legislative powers to assemblies in its colonies in the late 18th century, a subordinate legislative body cannot use the Act under which legislative power was delegated to it to expand its competence without an express power {{to do so in}} the enabling Act (see <b>Declaratory</b> <b>Act).</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1892 the Free Church, {{following}} {{the example of}} the United Presbyterian Church and the Church of Scotland, and with union with those denominations as the goal, passed a <b>Declaratory</b> <b>Act</b> relaxing the standard of subscription to the confession.

40|$|In {{a recent}} article, we {{proposed}} that the <b>Declaratory</b> Judgment <b>Act</b> of 1934 was intended, contrary to the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s long-standing interpretation, to enlarge the subject matter jurisdiction of the federal courts. When Congress considered the Act, jurisdictional concerns centered around whether declaratory judgments would violate the case-or-controversy clause, not whether introduction of the device would expand the federal question jurisdiction Congress already had authorized. There is, indeed, substantial evidence that Congress intended to expand federal question jurisdiction to include at least two, and possibly three, case models; {{there is virtually no}} evidence supporting the contrary position taken by the Supreme Court in Skelly Oil Co. v. Phillips Petroleum Co. and subsequent cases. We concluded that a complaint seeking declaratory relief ought to be evaluated for jurisdictional purposes on its face, under the same rules as complaints seeking coercive relief. Certainly nothing {{in the history of the}} <b>Declaratory</b> Judgment <b>Act</b> suggests that a complaint seeking declaratory relief should be denied federal adjudication merely because the court would have lacked jurisdiction if the complaint instead had sought coercive relief. We therefore argued that the jurisdictional analysis prescribed by the Court in Skelly Oil should be abandoned, and that the <b>Declaratory</b> Judgment <b>Act</b> should be recognized as having created a cause of action and expanded federal question jurisdiction...|$|R
500|$|After the 1989 {{amendments}} to the Constitution and the ISA, there was academic discourse {{on the effect of}} section8B(1) on the future development of the common law. The amendments merely caused a time warp in the common law, taking it back to 1971. As they did not amount to a codifying or <b>declaratory</b> <b>Act</b> seeking to replace the common law of judicial review, there is uncertainty whether the courts may continue to develop the common law and move away from the legal position laid down in Lee Mau Seng. Michael Rutter has asserted that the common law can indeed continue to change.

2500|$|In London, the Rockingham {{government}} came {{to power}} (July 1765) and Parliament debated whether to repeal the stamp tax or to send an army to enforce it.

Parliament agreed and repealed the tax (February 21, 1766), but insisted in the <b>Declaratory</b> <b>Act</b> of March 1766 that they retained full power to make laws for the colonies [...] "in all cases whatsoever".

40|$|The <b>Declaratory</b> Judgment <b>Act</b> of 1934 {{was quickly}} tagged by the US. Supreme Court {{as a simple}} {{procedural}} measure. That said, {{the addition of the}} declaratory judgment option has dramatically increased the rights of would-be defendants. This is of special interest in patent law, where without the ability to initiate legal action, an alleged infringer would typically have no recourse but to either drop a lucrative business and lose a massive investment, or to languish in legal limbo while potentially accruing liability for treble damages. The option of a mirror-image lawsuit removes the patentee 2 ̆ 7 s ability to decide unilaterally when, where-and, effectively whether-to file suit. For this reason, patent litigation is exemplary of the normative values that led to the passage of the <b>Declaratory</b> Judgment <b>Act,</b> including the delicate balance of ripeness, standing, and judicial access. Indeed, the Act 2 ̆ 7 s proponents had patent law firmly in mind. Over the years, however, courts have begun to lose sight of this objective. Following the jurisprudence of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, district courts have increasingly applied an overly formalistic standard of justiciability in declaratory actions involving patent disputes, thereby unduly decreasing judicial access, and shifting the balance of power back to the patentee. This is largely due to confusion by the Federal Circuit and the district courts between baseline and discretionary jurisdiction. Interestingly, the courts have-by analogy from patent law-articulated the same strict standard in copyright and trademark disputes, yet they have applied the standard more broadly, thereby more closely following the normative values embodied in the <b>Declaratory</b> Judgment <b>Act.</b> This Article examines the normative purpose behind the Declaratory Judgment Act; the standards articulated and applied in intellectual property disputes; and the recent case law on the topic, culminating in the timely, although somewhat misguided, US. Supreme Court decision of January 9, 2007. The Article proposes a more appropriate standard for evaluating declaratory judgment jurisdiction in intellectual property disputes, and provides a four-part spectrum of factors for district courts to consider in exercising their discretion, in order to best align declaratory jurisprudence with the normative values that led to its creation...|$|R
