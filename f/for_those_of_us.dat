Between Fringe and its lead-in show Bones, Fox finished in third place for the night. The Fringe episode's low ratings have been attributed by critics to the unexpected end to the 2010 World Series, which caused Fringe to air a week earlier than expected. Den of Geek columnist Billy Grifter attributed the low ratings to the parallel universe focus, commenting [...] "if you weren't a fan beforehand, you'll {{not be able to}} follow what's going on now. <b>For</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> that did step onto the Fringe elevator early, it's a great ride, but I can see that it's a difficult proposition to attract new viewers."

500|$|In {{his first}} {{scouting}} handbook, Aids to Scouting (1899), Baden-Powell published {{many of the}} lessons he learned from Burnham and this book was later used by boys' groups {{as a guide to}} outdoor fun. At the urging of several youth leaders, Baden-Powell decided to adapt his scouting handbook specifically to training boys. While Baden-Powell went on to refine the concept of Scouting, publish Scouting for Boys (1908), and become the founder of the international Scouting movement, Burnham has been called the movement's father. James E. West, Chief Scout Executive for the Boy Scouts of America (BSA), summarized Burnham's historical relevance to Scouting: [...] "There is an especial significance <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> in Scouting in this man's list, for he was engaged for this work by Lord Baden Powell, who was then connected with the British Army in Africa, and who had unbounded admiration for the scouting methods of Frederick Burnham.
