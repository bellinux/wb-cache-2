Gui {{was involved in a}} drink-driving incident in Ningbo in December 2003 in which a 23-year-old girl was killed while crossing the road. The victim's mother disagreed with the police investigation report that her daughter should bear secondary responsibility for not paying attention to traffic, since she had heard from witnesses that the car had been speeding, so she risked her life to experiment on herself {{with the help of her}} son and a driver for 10 days, demonstrating that the <b>driving</b> <b>speed</b> had to exceed 110 km/h for the accident to occur. She appealed to the Zhejiang Provincial Public Security Department, which upon reexamination concluded that Gui should bear full responsibility for the incident in May 2004. Her experiment was widely reported in the Chinese media. The victim's parents later filed a civil lawsuit against Gui for compensation. The Ningbo Municipal Intermediate People's Court ruled the following August that Gui had committed a crime, for which Gui received a two-year suspended jail term. He then departed for Germany, thus violated his probation terms. In 2004, after leaving China, he worked for a German affiliate of Nordpool Consulting.|$|E

25|$|However, most {{contemporary}} authors credit Daniel Khazzoom for the re-emergence of the rebound {{effect in the}} research literature. Although Khazzoom {{did not use the}} term, he raised {{the idea that there is}} a less than one-to-one correlation between gains in energy efficiency and reductions in energy use, because of a change in the 'price content' of energy in the provision of the final consumer product. His study was based on energy efficiency gains in home appliances, but the principle applies throughout the economy. A commonly studied example is that of a more fuel-efficient car. As each kilometre of travel becomes cheaper, there will be an increase in <b>driving</b> <b>speed</b> and/or kilometres driven, as long as the price elasticity of demand for car travel is not zero. Other examples might include the growth in garden lighting after the introduction of energy-saving compact fluorescent lamps or the increasing size of houses driven partly by higher fuel efficiency in home heating technologies. If the rebound effect is larger than 100%, all gains from the increased fuel efficiency would be wiped out by increases in demand (the Jevons paradox).|$|E

When drivers optimize with respect to <b>driving</b> <b>speeds,</b> we discuss three alternative approaches. The first two rely on constructing drivers’ utility functions, and the last on revealed government preferences similar to that used by Ashenfelter and Greenstone (2002) (A-G). The two last approaches are based on observations of changed <b>driving</b> <b>speeds</b> when speed limits and speeding penalties change. When drivers are law obedient and adhere to speed limits only the A-G approach can be used. Their approach is however unrealistic in putting overly great demand on government information about VSL, and in addition provides upwardly biased average VSL estimates.

40|$|Volunteering {{has long}} been known for its {{positive}} effects on the individual and the community. However, no research to date has examined the safety of individuals when volunteering their services. The safety of individuals when driving a vehicle is particularly a concern in the nonprofit sector as volunteers are leaving organizations due to fear of public liability. As such, this paper aims to identify the internal motivational factors influencing the safety of volunteers when driving a vehicle (n = 73). Utilizing Clary’s et al. (1998) scale of the motivational functions served by volunteering, we found that individuals who volunteer their services for ego-related functioning (protective) {{were more likely to report}} higher self-reported <b>driving</b> <b>speeds,</b> while individuals who volunteer their services for altruistic purposes (values) were more likely to report lower self-reported <b>driving</b> <b>speeds.</b> In turn, higher self-reported <b>driving</b> <b>speeds</b> were found to be associated with a greater number of self-reported crashes in the past two years. These results have important implications for volunteer driving organizations, as these results suggest that some motivations are associated with poorer driving performance...|$|R

2500|$|Tesla {{responded by}} {{publishing}} logs of the vehicle's charge levels and <b>driving</b> <b>speed</b> that contradicted Broder's account on several factual details. Tesla implied that Broder's behavior forced {{the car to}} fail. Broder replied to the criticism in a blog post and suggested that the speed discrepancies may have been because the car had been equipped with 19-inch wheels rather than the specified 21-inch wheels. In {{the midst of the}} controversy, a CNN reporter recreated Broder's trip without exhausting the battery. However, two key differences distinguished the two journeys. The weather was about [...] warmer and CNN did the trip in one day; the Times let the car sit overnight without being plugged in. A reporter from CNBC also recreated the trip in one day without incidents. One week later, a group of Tesla owners recreated Broder's trip without problems. One owner was delayed because his car failed to charge and required two firmware updates.|$|E
60|$|Opposite Chiricahua, {{where the}} road forked, Link Stevens headed the car {{straight}} south and gradually increased speed. Madeline faced another endless gray incline. It was the San Bernardino Valley. The singing of the car, the stinging of the wind warned her to draw the hood securely down over her face again, {{and then it was}} as if she was riding at night. The car lurched ahead, settled into that <b>driving</b> <b>speed</b> which wedged Madeline back as in a vise. Again the moments went by fleet as the miles. Seemingly, there was an acceleration of the car till it reached a certain swiftness--a period of time in which it held that pace, and then a diminishing of all motion and sound which contributed to Madeline's acute sensation. Uncovering her face, she saw Link was passing another village. Could it be Bernardino? She asked Link--repeated the question.|$|E
40|$|The {{first part}} of this report {{contains}} a consideration on the 1991 safety development on motorways in relationship to the speed development. The second part of the report contains a consideration on the traffic safety development since May 1998. This part describes specifically how the speed development on the Dutch motorways relates to international developments. It appears that the 1989 - 1990 stabilization in <b>driving</b> <b>speeds</b> on the 100 and 120 km/h roads continued in the Netherlands in 1991. The international traffic safety comparison shows that the Dutch motorways belong to the safest motorways.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{different ways}} in which empirical estimates of the value of a statistical life (VSL) can be derived from observations of highway <b>driving</b> <b>speeds</b> and how these speeds are affected by speed limits and penalties for speeding. Assuming that drivers optimise with respect to <b>driving</b> <b>speeds,</b> we derive three alternative such concepts. The first two of these are based on construction of driver utility functions, and the last one on revealed government preferences as in a paper by Ashenfelter and Greenstone (2004 a). The two last (but not the first) are based on observations of changed <b>driving</b> <b>speeds</b> when speed limits and penalties for speeding change. When drivers instead are law-abiding and adhere to speed limits, only the last approach can be used. While Ashenfelter and Greenstone's may be the only viable approach given current data availability, we also indicate some potential problems with their results, in putting great demand on government information about VSL, and in possibly overvaluing VSL since mortality risk is considered as the only social cost of increased highway speeds. © 2005 LSE and the University of Bath...|$|R
