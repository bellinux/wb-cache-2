[...] He added [...] "If we wanted to manufacture a bomb, we would announce it." [...] On the same day as the President's announcement, Ali Akbar Salehi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, told Reuters that their 20% enrichment production, was going [...] "very well," [...] adding [...] "There is no limit on enrichment. We can enrich up to 100%... But we never had the intention and {{we do not have the}} intention to do so, unless we need (to)."

2500|$|Goku's {{character}} {{has been well}} received by publications for manga, anime and other media. Anime News Network noted Goku as {{a good source of}} comedy and remarked that after everything he experiences, he still remains a naïve character. Tim Jones from THEM Anime Reviews noted that Goku is not an omnipotent character in the first anime series, unlike Dragon Ball Z, and does not disappear {{for long periods of time}} between sagas. They also liked the way the series' depict his entire adventures, making him a good main character. Rationalmagic.com praised Goku's innocence as one of the funniest parts of the series. According to Julius Weideman, Goku's journey and ever-growing strength resulted in the character winning [...] "the admiration of young boys everywhere." [...] In 2015, the Japan Anniversary Association officially declared May 9 as [...] In Japanese the numbers 5 and 9 can be pronounced as [...] "Go" [...] and [...] "Ku" [...] respectively. Jason Thompson stated that unlike the [...] "manly" [...] heroes of other popular shōnen manga of the late 1980s and early 1990s, such as City Hunter and Fist of the North Star, Toriyama made his protagonist (Goku) cartoonish and small, thus starting a trend that Thompson says continues to this day. One Piece creator Eiichiro Oda and Naruto creator Masashi Kishimoto said that Goku inspired their protagonists as well as series structure. Commenting on Goku's popularity, Kishimoto stated that when people hear the name [...] "Son Goku", no longer <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>think</b> of the Journey to the West character, but instead Dragon Balls protagonist comes to mind. Additionally, for the second half of the series, Kishimoto created an ape named Son Goku in reference to Toriyama's character to the point the ape has four tails just like the four-star Dragon Ball Goku earned from his grandfather.|$|E
