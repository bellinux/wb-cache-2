2500|$|The Elimination Chamber {{match is}} a {{variation}} of elimination-based matches which draws elements from steel cage and Hell in a Cell matches, in that the wrestling ring {{is surrounded by a}} large steel fenced cage supported by girders. The Elimination Chamber is a circular-like chain-linked structure that encloses the ring. Its floor is platformed over the ringside area around the ring which elevates and levels it with the ring mat. Within the Elimination Chamber, facing the outside of each ring post behind each ring corner, are four enclosures referred to as inner chambers. The match is contested by six participants, with two beginning the match in the ring, while the other four are held within each inner chamber. Every five minutes, one of the four participants within a chamber is released into the ongoing match. In matches involving two three-member tag teams, two participants are released into the match once every ten minutes. And in matches involving two six to ten-member tag teams, the match begins two participants from both teams and there was eight periods consists of two participants are released the pods and into the match once every five minutes while a member from one of the teams (usually determined by a coin toss or [...] " [...] rock, paper, scissor") would enter the structure once every other three minutes rather than releasing the pods one-by-one and into a match. This continues until all four have been released, and so an Elimination Chamber match typically lasts over twenty or more minutes. The objective of the match is to eliminate each opponent from the match by scoring a pinfall or a submission. These can occur in the ring or on the chamber's <b>elevated</b> <b>floor</b> but starting in the 2012 event, all pinfalls and submissions must take place in the ring. Disqualifications and count-outs do not apply in the process of elimination. The winner of the match is the last remaining participant after all others have been eliminated (or after all members of the opposing tag team are eliminated in either the tag team matches or the twelve-on-twelve tornado tag team elimination matches).|$|E

60|$|The {{poet and}} his family are in {{possession}} of what may be considered the very best burial-places that the church affords. They lie in a row, right across the breadth of the chancel, the foot of each gravestone being close to the <b>elevated</b> <b>floor</b> on which the altar stands. Nearest to the side-wall, beneath Shakespeare's bust, is a slab bearing a Latin inscription addressed to his wife, and covering her remains; then his own slab, with the old anathematizing stanza upon it; then that of Thomas Nash, who married his granddaughter; then that of Dr. Hall, the husband of his daughter Susannah; and, lastly, Susannah's own. Shakespeare's is the commonest-looking slab of all, being just such a flag-stone as Essex Street in Salem used to be paved with, when I was a boy. Moreover, unless my eyes or recollection deceive me, there is a crack across it, as if it had already undergone some such violence as the inscription deprecates. Unlike the other monuments of the family, it bears no name, nor am I acquainted with the grounds or authority on which it is absolutely determined to be Shakespeare's; although, being in a range with those of his wife and children, it might naturally be attributed to him. But, then, why does his wife, who died afterwards, take precedence of him and occupy the place next his bust? And where are the graves of another daughter and a son, who have a better right in the family row than Thomas Nash, his grandson-in-law? Might not one or both of them have been laid under the nameless stone? But it is dangerous trifling with Shakespeare's dust; so I forbear to meddle further with the grave (though the prohibition makes it tempting), and shall let whatever bones be in it rest in peace. Yet I must needs add that the inscription on the bust seems to imply that Shakespeare's grave was directly underneath it.|$|E

50|$|Data {{centers have}} {{their roots in}} the huge {{computer}} rooms of the early ages of the computing industry. Early computer systems, complex to operate and maintain, required a special environment in which to operate. Many cables were necessary to connect all the components, and methods to accommodate and organize these were devised such as standard racks to mount equipment, raised floors, and cable trays (installed overhead or under the <b>elevated</b> <b>floor).</b> A single mainframe required {{a great deal of}} power, and had to be cooled to avoid overheating. Security became important - computers were expensive, and were often used for military purposes. Basic design-guidelines for controlling access to the computer room were therefore devised.|$|E

5000|$|Compared to porcelain, onggi has a {{microporous}} structure {{and has been}} found to assist in the fermentation in food processing such as the preparation of gochujang (fermented chili pepper, bean and rice paste), doenjang (fermented bean paste), kimchi (fermented seasoned vegetables), and soy sauce. Onggi with proper porosity and permeability needs to be used in order to produce an optimally ripened quality in fermented foodstuff. Fine-tuned onggi containers are, in fact, suitable for many different kinds of fermented products. Since early times, Korea has been famous for fermented foods. In ancient Chinese historiography, in the Biographies of the Wuhuan, Xianbei, and Dongyi (...) in the Records of Wèi (...) , {{which is part of the}} Records of the Three Kingdoms, there is this remark: [...] "Goguryeo people have a custom of making fermented foods". The abundance of soybean, which grows naturally in Korea, the fresh fishery resources from the sea surrounding the Korean Peninsula and a proper climate for microbial development, all give account of the importance of fermentation as food processing. However, onggi ware also contributed to the development of fermented dishes within Korean cuisine. Large onggi ware were stored on the jangdokdae, an <b>elevated</b> <b>floor</b> near the house.|$|E
50|$|Working {{during the}} interwar period, Trewern was {{involved}} in designing a variety of projects such as the Country Press building, Elizabeth and Edward Streets, Brisbane (1924-5), Heindorff House, Queen Street, Brisbane (1926) and Inchcolm, Wickham Terrace, Brisbane (1929). His domestic work included houses such built in the Ascot, Hamilton, Cield, Coorparoo and Greenslopes. He designed houses {{in a range of}} styles, including the Californian bungalow Gibson residence in Manly (1919). His Californian bungalows have features quite similar to the traditional houses of Queensland with <b>elevated</b> <b>floors,</b> pitched roofs, condensed floor plans and outdoor living and sleeping areas. The Raff residence in Clayfield (1923) and his own house at Greenslopes (1926) are good examples of designs presenting those features.

With eight single beds and two double beds, housemates were forced to share beds, and when a Housemate was evicted from the series, their bed was removed from the house, effectively preventing bed swapping. The showers in the bathroom this season were made of glass which led out into the garden, thus providing Housemates with no privacy.
