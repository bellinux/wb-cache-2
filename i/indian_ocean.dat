5|$|The <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> Dipole is an atmospheric–oceanic {{phenomenon}} {{characterized by}} differences in sea surface temperatures between {{the eastern and}} western sections of the tropical <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean.</b> Similar to the Antarctic Oscillation, the <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> Dipole is characterized by two phases: a positive and a negative phase. In the positive phase, the eastern section of the tropical <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> is cooler (lower sea surface temperature) and the western section is warmer than normal (higher sea surface temperature). On the other hand, the negative phase is characterized by warmer sea surface temperatures on the eastern section and cooler sea surface temperatures on the western section of the tropical <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean.</b> Studies {{have shown that the}} <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> Dipole is partly responsible for variations in precipitation in Argentina and South America in general. During a positive phase, precipitation is higher in the Río de la Plata Basin due to teleconnections.|$|E

5|$|The French <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> {{territories of}} Île de France and Île Bonaparte were heavily {{fortified}} island bases from which French frigates {{were able to}} launch raids against British trade routes across the <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> during the Napoleonic Wars. In late 1808, a squadron of four frigates departed France for the region under Commodore Jacques Hamelin with orders to prey on the convoys of East Indiamen that regularly crossed the <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean.</b> During the late spring of 1809, these frigates dispersed into the Bay of Bengal, attacking British shipping and coastal harbours around {{the rim of the}} Eastern <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean.</b> The Royal Navy was also preparing an operation in the region, a staggered campaign intended to blockade, isolate and subsequently capture both Île deFrance and Île Bonaparte, eliminating the final French territories and bases east of Africa.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of 1806, control of the <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> in the Napoleonic Wars was disputed. The French Empire and its client state the Kingdom of Holland held {{significant}} naval bases in the region, from which their warships could operate against British interests. The French islands of Île Bonaparte and Isle de France dominated the central <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean,</b> their position allowing raiders to cruise British trade routes and attack isolated convoys, while the Dutch colonies at the Cape of Good Hope and the Dutch East Indies controlled the points of entry to the ocean from east and west with their own naval squadrons. The British, whose bases in India gave them control of the Northern <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean,</b> were able to obtain supplies and reinforcements from Europe more easily than their enemies, as the Royal Navy was already dominant in European waters, but British forces in the region were still insufficient to make {{a significant impact on}} the French and Dutch territories. Control of the <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> was essential for the British war effort, because the British economy relied heavily on trade with the holdings of the Honourable East India Company in India and with other ports in the east, particularly in China.|$|E

5|$|In late April 2002, {{an area of}} convection, or thunderstorms, persisted to the west-southwest of Diego Garcia in the south-central <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean,</b> {{associated}} with a trough near the equator. The system had a broad circulation, and initially moved slowly to the east-southeast. It developed due {{to an increase in}} the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO), which moved eastward across the <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean.</b> The same system spawned a disturbance in the northern <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> that later struck Oman as a tropical cyclone. Such simultaneous systems in opposite hemispheres occasionally occur in the spring or autumn; in May 2002, the powerful MJO pulse produced two such sets of storms, later producing a set in the eastern <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> that became a deep depression that struck Myanmar and Tropical Storm Errol to the southwest of Indonesia. On April30, Météo-France (MFR) classified the system as a zone of disturbed weather. It slowly organized, prompting the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to issue a tropical cyclone formation alert late on May2, around the time that MFR classified it as Tropical Disturbance14. The thunderstorms became more concentrated around an increasingly well-defined center, and with minimal wind shear, the system strengthened into Tropical Depression14 on May3. That day, the JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Cyclone23S.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean,</b> loggerheads feed {{along the}} coastlines of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, {{and in the}} Arabian Sea. Along the African coastline, loggerheads nest from Mozambique's Bazaruto Archipelago to South Africa's St Lucia estuary. The largest <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> nesting site is Oman, on the Arabian Peninsula, which hosts around 15,000 nests, giving it the second largest nesting {{population}} of loggerheads in the world. Western Australia is another notable nesting area, with 1,000–2,000 nests per year.|$|E

5|$|Kona lows, most extra{{tropical}} cyclones, {{and tropical}} upper tropospheric cyclones are cold core lows. In {{the eastern half}} of the north Pacific ocean and north <b>Indian</b> <b>ocean,</b> the formation of a weak circulation underneath a mid to upper-tropospheric low which has cut off from the main belt of the westerlies during the cold season (winter) is called a subtropical cyclone. In the case of the north <b>Indian</b> <b>ocean,</b> the formation of this type of vortex leads to the onset of monsoon rains during the wet season.|$|E
5|$|Severe Cyclonic Storm Agni was a {{tropical}} cyclone of the 2004 North <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> cyclone season notable for its record {{proximity to the}} equator. It was the second North <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> cyclone to receive a name, after Onil earlier in the year. Agni formed on November28 well to the southwest of India in the Arabian Sea, and steadily intensified as it tracked northwestward. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) estimated peak 1minute sustained winds of 120km/h (75mph), while the India Meteorological Department (IMD) estimated peak 3minute sustained winds of 100km/h (65mph); the IMD is the official warning center for the north <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean.</b> After peaking, it weakened due to wind shear, dry air, and cooler waters, and the JTWC issued its final advisory on December3 as it approached the coast of Somalia. The remnants of Agni moved along the Somalian coastline until dissipating on December5.|$|E
5|$|The 1960 North <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> cyclone season {{featured}} two deadly tropical cyclones {{that killed}} approximately 20,000people collectively in East Pakistan (present-day Bangladesh).

The official Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre in this basin is the India Meteorological Department (IMD), while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center releases unofficial advisories. On average, five storms form in the North <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> every season with dual peaks in activity during May and November. Cyclones that occurred between 45°E and 100°E were included in seasonal records by the IMD.|$|E
