40|$|There {{are many}} factors which affect the {{performance}} of a drum closure during drop tests. Important test conditions are: weight of package, <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>drop,</b> and angle of impact. Structural characteristics of the package determine its ability to withstand the test conditions imposed. These characteristics include: package diameter, shell material and thickness, strength of internal fill material (e. g., fiberboard), and configuration of closure (clamp-ring, bolted flange, etc.). For the clamp-ring closure configuration a study of published drop test results has shown that packages having a weight ratio of less than 50 per cent were typically able to retain their lids in hypothetical accident condition, 30 -ft drop tests. Those having weight ratios greater than 50 per cent typically failed. Prior testing over the integrity of the clamp-ring closure, consistently demonstrated that the clamp-ring is unable to retain the drum lid in thirty foot drop tests of packages containing the maximum allowed weight (640 lb), which confirms the previous studies. To determine if the clamp-ring closure is adequate for packages with lower weight contents, a series of tests were performed on packages weighing around 325 lb (i. e., a typical shipping weight for DOE packages) at a range of impact angles as detailed in this report. The test results consistently demonstrated that the standard clamp-ring closure is unable to retain the drum lid of standard 6 M packages weighing 325 lb...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} the generalized design rules for a new stilling basin for use with the straight drop spillway. This generalized stilling basin design was developed because experience in the field had shown that there was no satisfactory stilling basin for the straight drop spillway. However, limited field experience indicates that this new design will adequately protect the downstream channel from scour. Water falling over the spillway crest falls onto a flat apron. The nappe is broken up by floor blocks, which also prevent damaging scour of the downstream channel banks. Scour of the downstream channel bed is prevented by an end still. Flaring wingwalls, triangular in elevation, prevent erosion of the dam fill. For proper operation of the stilling basin, the contraction of the flow at the ends of the spillway opening must be partially suppressed. The stilling basin can be used {{for a wide range of}} discharge, head on the crest, crest length, <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>drop,</b> and downstream tailwater level. An important finding is that the stilling basin length computed for the minimum tailwater levels. Dangerous scour of the downstream channel may occur if the nappe is supported sufficiently by high tailwater so that it lands beyond the end of the stilling basin. A method of computing the stilling basin length for all tailwater levels is presented. The design rules developed as a result of the laboratory tests were carefully checked an verified. An example shows how these rules are applied to the design of field structure.

The film theory, advanced to interpret the compaction phenomena, has been, discussed {{in the light of the}} present work and led to the development of a new theory which is capable of interpreting all phenomena encountered in compaction. A general equation has been derived, and proved dimensionally, to determine the max. density of any type of soil compacted under dynamic energy, once the mechanical analysis and specific gravity of the soil are known. Another general equation has been derived to determine the optimum moisture content of any type of soil. An investigation, on the effect of compaction under static loads on tensile-strength, of Staines and Blue London Clays and Clayey Brickearth is given in, the course of this thesis. A new device was developed to measure the tensile strength as low as 2 lb/sq. in. Such investigations have shown that compaction increases the tensile strength of clays, which in turn increases with increase in compactive effort. The effect of the spent lye, from the paper industry, and hydrated lime on the compaction characteristics bios and stabilization of London Clay, has been investigated. The spent lye from the sulphite process reduces the capillary water absorption of the clay. Hydrated lime, which is cheaper than cement, is very effective in amounts of 10 %, for the stabilization of London Clay.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{establish}} the dynamics of maximal voluntary contraction force (MVCF), <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>drop</b> jump (DJ) and electrically evoked quadriceps muscle force at different stimulation frequencies during and after 100 DJs (stretch-shortening exercise, SSE). Healthy untrained men (n = 11; age = 21. 8 ± 1. 7 years) participated in the study. DJs were performed with 30 s intervals between jumps from the height of 0. 5 m with counter-movement to 90 degrees angle in the knee and immediate maximal rebound. The force of the quadriceps muscle, evoked by electrical stimulation at 1 Hz (Pt), 20 Hz (P 20) and 100 Hz (P 100) frequencies (electrically evoked performance, EEP), MVCF and height of DJ (voluntary evoked performance, VEP) were established during SSE (after 10, 50, 100 DJ) as well as at 1, 4, 8, 24, 48 and 72 h after SSE. Time-course of P 20 and P 100 during and after SSE was time (ANOVA: p < 0. 001) and frequency dependent (ANOVA: p < 0. 001) The Pt, P 20 and P 100 decreased significantly (p < 0. 01) more than MVCF and H of DJ during SSE. At the beginning of SSE (during 1 - 10 DJs) P 20 and P 100 decreased significantly (p < 0. 001) more than during 11 - 50 and 51 - 100 DJs. There was a significant (p < 0. 05) increase in Pt, P 20 and P 100 from 8 h to 48 h, whereas height of DJ and MVCF significantly decreased at that time. In conclusion, the differences in time course of VEP and EEP are most evident at beginning of SSE, where VEP does not change as EEP decreases, and within 8 - 48 hours after SSE, where VEP decreases as EEP increase...|$|E

The series of drop tests were done with lump size coals, to determine a possible critical <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>drop</b> coal for lump degradation. The rate of coal degradation decreased sharply below the critical height and increased significantly above the critical height. The largest drop experienced by coal lumps during ship loading was 30 m. A series of drop tests were planned 3 drops at 10 m, 4 drops at 7. 5 m, 5 drops at 6 m, 6 drops at 5 m, 10 drops at 3 m, 15 drops at 2 m, and 30 drops at 1 m. The results showed that above 3 m critical heights replacing large drops with a number of smaller drops could reduce the fines generation. The presence of more than 10 % of coal fines by mass with lump coal had a cushioning effect, which reduced the lump degradation by as much as 12 %. The effects of the end surface were also evaluated by drop tests onto steel plates, conveyor belting and coal stockpiles. The different size of coal did not show significant difference of fine generation. The effect of stabilization of the coal was also evaluated by comparing fresh coal lumps that had been through a handling process. The normal unweathered coal samples were exposed to the weathering condition for 1 -month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and one year. These weathered coal samples were tested with the drop breakage apparatus and compare with the drop test results of normal unweathered coal. It was found that the rate of fines generation of weathered coal increased up to a certain period; thereafter the fines generation became almost constant during drop tests...|$|E

Seventy-six gymnasts and 91 moderately active subjects volunteered to participate in this study. Drop jumps (DJ) were performed from 20 -, 40 -, 60 -, 80 -, and 100 -cm heights. Flight time (FT) and contact time (CT) were recorded using contact mat. Flight time to contact time (FC) ratio and Bosco expression (BE) were calculated. Male gymnasts scored similar FT to their controls, whereas female gymnasts had significantly longer FT compared with their peers. The gymnasts obtained significantly shorter CT than their control groups, whereas their FC ratios were significantly higher and increased when the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the <b>drops</b> was close to 60 cm.

The drop on the electrode butt end was approximated as a semiellipsoid. It has been stated that at the building-up current is equal to 500 A, TMF induction of TMF, at which the drop tears away from the butt ends of the electrodes, does not much depend on the diameter of the electrodes and is approximately 20 mTl.
