5|$|To {{meet the}} {{transport}} <b>demand,</b> <b>the</b> State and Union government constructed a mass rapid transit system, including the Delhi Metro. In 1998, the Supreme Court of India ordered that all public transport vehicles in Delhi must be fuelled by {{compressed natural gas}} (CNG). Buses {{are the most popular}} means of public transport, catering to about 60% of the total <b>demand.</b> <b>The</b> state-owned Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) is a major bus service provider which operates the world's largest fleet of CNG-fuelled buses. Delhi Bus Rapid Transit System runs between Ambedkar Nagar and Delhi Gate.|$|E

5000|$|The above equation, when plotted with {{quantity}} <b>demanded</b> (...) on <b>the</b> ''''-axis {{and price}} (...) on the -axis, gives <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> curve, {{which is also}} known as <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> schedule. <b>The</b> downward sloping nature of a typical <b>demand</b> curve illustrates <b>the</b> inverse relationship between quantity demanded and price. Therefore, a downward sloping <b>demand</b> curve embeds <b>the</b> law of <b>demand.</b>|$|R

5|$|Another reason exports {{cannot be}} {{promoted}} is because in all likelihood, an underdeveloped country {{may only be}} skilled enough to promote the export of primary goods, say agricultural goods. However, since such commodities face inelastic <b>demand,</b> <b>the</b> {{extent to which they}} will sell in the market is limited. Although when population is at a rise, additional demand for exports may be created, Nurkse implicitly assumed that developed countries are operating at the replacement rate of population growth. For Nurkse, then, exports as a means of economic development are completely ruled out.|$|E

The comics were written by Ian Flynn, who also authors the main comic series. Some issues were published in Jetix Magazine in the United Kingdom and Italy.|$|E
5|$|Argentina {{regularly}} receives {{cold air}} from the south that can reach low latitudes owing {{to the influence of}} the Andes. Cold waves are usually accompanied with severe snowstorms or extremely cold conditions that can have a devastating impact on the country's economy. These snowstorms and/or extremely cold conditions can partially or completely paralyze activities in large areas of Patagonia and the center of the country. In addition, cold conditions can lead to energy shortages during the winter months due to increased <b>demand.</b> <b>The</b> low temperatures brought by these cold waves can cause frosts that can damage plants, severely affecting agricultural production and devastating the local economy.|$|E

5|$|Besides the anime {{television}} series, {{there have}} been two other animated adaptations: The Very Short Azumanga Daioh Movie, a six-minute trailer released to movie theaters to publicize the upcoming television series, and Azumanga Web Daioh, a shorter original net animation made available for paid streaming on chara-ani.com beginning from December 28, 2000, then offered as a paid download for a limited time. Azumanga Web Daioh was originally intended to gauge whether there was enough interest to create a web-released anime adaptation; because of overwhelming <b>demand,</b> <b>the</b> original plan for web-release was changed to a television release. It featured different voice actors and music from the regular series.|$|E
5|$|Between 1835 and 1850, Sir Charles Barry remodelled {{the castle}} in the Scottish Baronial style for the 2nd Duke of Sutherland.

5|$|By 925, Romanos Lekapenos {{felt himself}} {{strong enough to}} <b>demand</b> <b>the</b> payment of tribute from the Muslim cities {{on the western side}} of the Euphrates. When they refused, in 926, Kourkouas led the army across the border. Aided by his brother Theophilos and an Armenian {{contingent}} under the strategos of Lykandos, Mleh (Melias in Greek sources), Kourkouas targeted Melitene (modern Malatya), the center of an emirate which had long been a thorn in Byzantium's side. The Byzantine army successfully stormed the lower city, and although the citadel held out, Kourkouas concluded a treaty by which the emir accepted tributary status.|$|E

5|$|In 1889 Waterloo Station (renamed from Waterloo Bridge {{station in}} 1886) was {{equipped}} with new signals, which required a gantry spanning all the lines into the station.

At this time the LSWR also leased a small plot of land west of the Westminster Bridge Road entrance to serve as the site of new offices for the LNC, designed by Cyril Bazett Tubbs.|$|E
