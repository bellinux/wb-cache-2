40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIObjectives: We {{assessed}} {{the agreement of}} body fat and fat-free mass measured by simpler methods against the four-compartment model (4 C). Methods: In 60 obese schoolchildren (body mass index 95 th percentile) {{between the ages of}} 8 and 13 y who were recruited from one school in Chile, multicompartmental body composition was estimated with the use of isotopic dilution, plethysmography (BodPod), radiographic absorptiometry (DEXA), and anthropometric equations. These results were compared to those of the 4 C model, which is considered the gold standard. Results: For body fat, the 4 C model showed the best agreement with DEXA <b>for</b> boys in <b>Tanner</b> stages I and II (r ¼ 0. 971) and with isotopic dilution <b>for</b> boys in <b>Tanner</b> stages III and IV (r ¼ 0. 984). The best agreement in girls occurred with isotopic dilution, regardless of pubertal stage (r ¼ 0. 948 <b>for</b> <b>Tanner</b> stages I and II; r ¼ 0. 978 <b>for</b> <b>Tanner</b> stages III and IV). Both isotopic dilution and the Huang, Ellis, and Deurenberg anthropometric equations underestimated body fat in boys; by contrast, DEXA, BodPod, and the Slaughter equation overestimated body fat in boys. All of the equations underestimated body fat in girls. For fat-free mass in both boys and girls, the 4 C model showed the best agreement with isotopic dilution, regardless of pubertal stage. The Huang equation showed the best agreement for boys (r ¼ 0. 730 <b>for</b> <b>Tanner</b> stages I and II; r ¼ 0. 695 <b>for</b> <b>Tanner</b> stages III and IV) and <b>for</b> girls in <b>Tanner</b> stages I and II (r ¼ 0. 884). The Ellis equation had the best agreement <b>for</b> girls in <b>Tanner</b> stages III and IV (r ¼ 0. 917). Conclusions: For obese Chilean children of both sexes, isotopic dilution and DEXA were the twocompartment methods that had the best agreement with the gold-standard 4 C model for both body fat and fat-free mass; these were followed by the Huang and Ellis anthropometric equations...|$|R
