5|$|The Norwegian Air Ambulance {{operates}} both {{a helicopter}} and <b>fixed-wing</b> air ambulance service out of Brønnøysund Airport. Aircraft operations are subcontracted to Lufttransport, which operates an AgustaWestland AW139 helicopter and a Beech King Air <b>fixed-wing</b> aircraft. Both are manned by medical personnel from Helgeland Hospital Trust. In 2011, the helicopter flew 465 missions and the <b>fixed-wing</b> aircraft 1022 missions.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fixed-wing</b> {{aircraft}} – These can be {{used for}} either acute emergency care in remote areas (such as in Australia, with the 'Flying Doctors'), for patient transport over long distances (e.g. a re-patriation following an illness or injury in a foreign country), or transportation between distant hospitals. Helicopter and <b>fixed-wing</b> ambulances are discussed in greater detail at air ambulance.|$|E

5|$|On 3 April, {{given the}} {{deterioration}} in the defences around Phnom Penh, Ambassador John Gunther Dean requested the deployment of the 10-man Operation Eagle Pull command element which landed at Pochentong on a BirdAir C-130 plane. The command element supervised the ongoing <b>fixed-wing</b> evacuation of more than 750 Cambodians {{over the next seven}} days in the face of 80–90 rounds of 105mm artillery and 107mm rocket fire each day. By 10 April Khmer Rouge fire had become so heavy that the <b>fixed-wing</b> evacuation was ended.|$|E
5|$|The Civil Air Patrol {{operates}} and maintains <b>fixed-wing</b> aircraft, training gliders, ground vehicles, {{and a national}} radio communications network.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the First World War, {{for the first time since}} the Napoleonic Wars, the {{population}} of the British Isles was in danger of attack from naval raids. The country also came under attack from air raids by zeppelins and <b>fixed-wing</b> aircraft, another first.|$|E
5|$|Emergency {{ambulance}} – The {{most common}} type of ambulance, which provide care to patients with an acute illness or injury. These can be road-going vans, boats, helicopters, <b>fixed-wing</b> aircraft (known as air ambulances) or even converted vehicles such as golf carts.|$|E
5|$|Helicopter – Usually {{used for}} {{emergency}} care, either in places inaccessible by road, or {{in areas where}} speed is of the essence, as {{they are able to}} travel significantly faster than a road ambulance. Helicopter and <b>fixed-wing</b> ambulances are discussed in greater detail at air ambulance.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to major conflicts, USMC AV-8Bs {{have been deployed}} in support of contingency and humanitarian operations, providing <b>fixed-wing</b> air cover and armed reconnaissance. The aircraft served in Somalia throughout the 1990s, Liberia (1990, 1996, and 2003), Rwanda (1994), Central African Republic (1996), Albania (1997), Zaire (1997), and Sierra Leone (1997).|$|E
5|$|The charter unit within Air Greenland {{is led by}} Hans Peter Hansen and employs 8 people, with 13 {{helicopters}} and 3 <b>fixed-wing</b> aircraft at its disposal. Excess capacity of airplanes is used for regular charters to tourist destinations in Europe, Asia, and Africa.|$|E
5|$|With the {{retirement}} of the Harrier GR7/9 in 2010, there remained no carrier-capable <b>fixed-wing</b> aircraft available to the Royal Navy or Royal Air Force. Their expected replacement is the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the size}} of the Queen Elizabeth class would enable it to {{accommodate}} most current and projected carrier-based <b>fixed-wing</b> aircraft, the lack of arresting gear means that, as initially completed, it is only capable of operating either STOVL aircraft, such as the AV-8B Harrier or F-35B Lightning, tiltrotor aircraft such as the V-22 Osprey, or aircraft that do not require either catapult-assisted take-off or arrested recovery.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} {{evacuation}} plan agreed with the DAO, Air America committed 24 of its 28 available helicopters to support {{the evacuation}} and 31 pilots agreed to stay in Saigon to support the evacuation; this meant that most helicopters would have only one pilot rather than the usual two. At 08:30 on 29 April, with the shelling of Tan Son Nhut Airport subsiding, Air America began ferrying its helicopter and <b>fixed-wing</b> pilots from their homes in Saigon to the Air America compound at Tan Son Nhut, {{across the road from}} the DAO Compound. Air America helicopters started flying to the rooftop LZs in Saigon and either shuttled the evacuees back to the DAO Compound or flew out to the ships of TF76. By 10:30 all of Air America's <b>fixed-wing</b> aircraft had departed Tan Son Nhut, evacuating all non-essential personnel and as many Vietnamese evacuees as they could carry and headed for Thailand. At some point during the morning VNAF personnel took 5 ICCS UH1-H Hueys and one Air America Bell 204 from the Air America ramp.|$|E
5|$|Between 1995 and 2004 {{there were}} 2,630 {{accidents}} involving GA aircraft, of which 139 were fatal, {{resulting in the}} loss of 317 lives. The majority of accidents involved small <b>fixed-wing</b> aircraft engaged in private flights, and analysis attributes the most common causes of these to: flight handling skills; poor judgement or airmanship; lack of training or experience; and omission of, or inappropriate, action.|$|E
5|$|Early {{variants}} {{included the}} Su-25UB two-seat trainer, the Su-25BM for target-towing, and the Su-25K for export customers. Some aircraft were being upgraded to Su-25SM standard in 2012. The Su-25T and the Su-25TM (also {{known as the}} Su-39) were further developments, not produced in significant numbers. The Su-25, and the Su-34, were the only armoured, <b>fixed-wing</b> aircraft in production in 2007. Su-25s are in service with Russia, other CIS states, and export customers.|$|E
5|$|Five {{days after}} the shootdown, USAF OPC {{officials}} began including Black Hawk flight times in the daily ATO and included the correct IFF code in the ATO provided to Eagle Flight. OPC officially ended on 31 December 1996. Over the six years of the operation, coalition participants flew a total of 62,000 <b>fixed-wing</b> and rotary-wing sorties. The Black Hawk shootdown was the only serious accident to occur during the operation.|$|E
5|$|It has direct {{applications}} for search and rescue, counterdrug, disaster relief and impact assessment, and homeland security, {{and has been}} deployed by the Civil Air Patrol (CAP) in the US on the Australian-built Gippsland GA8 Airvan <b>fixed-wing</b> aircraft. CAP, the civilian auxiliary of the United States Air Force, is a volunteer education and public-service non-profit organization that conducts aircraft search and rescue in the US.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of her career, over thirty {{aircraft}} were either lost or heavily damaged while operating from Melbourne. The majority of the aircraft ditched or crashed over the side, but some losses were due to catapult or arrestor cable failures. After Melbourne was decommissioned, the Fleet Air Arm ceased <b>fixed-wing</b> combat aircraft operation in 1984, with the final Tracker flight saluting the decommissioned carrier.|$|E
5|$|RSI {{may also}} be used in prehospital {{emergency}} situations when a patient is conscious but respiratory failure is imminent (such as in extreme trauma). This procedure is commonly performed by flight paramedics. Flight paramedics often use RSI to intubate before transport because intubation in a moving <b>fixed-wing</b> or rotary-wing aircraft {{is extremely difficult to}} perform due to environmental factors. The patient will be paralyzed and intubated on the ground before transport by aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The 2006 New York City {{plane crash}} {{occurred}} on October 11, 2006, when a Cirrus SR20 general aviation, <b>fixed-wing,</b> single-engine light aircraft {{crashed into the}} Belaire Apartments in New York City at about 2:42p.m. local time (18:42 UTC). The aircraft struck {{the north side of}} the building, located on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, causing a fire in several apartments, which was extinguished within two hours.|$|E
5|$|The April 1957 OAG shows 414 weekday <b>fixed-wing</b> {{departures from}} Midway: 83 American, 83 United, 56 TWA, 40 Capital, 35 North Central, 28 Delta, 27 Eastern, 22 Northwest, 19 Ozark, 11 Braniff, 5 Trans-Canada, and 5 Lake Central. Air France, Lufthansa, and REAL (of Brazil) {{had a few}} flights per week. Midway {{was running out of}} room and in any case could not handle the 707 and DC-8 jets that {{appeared}} in 1959; every Chicago jet flight had to use O'Hare, which had opened to the airlines in 1955. Electras and Viscounts could have continued to fly out of Midway, but O'Hare's capacious new terminal opened in 1962, allowing airlines to consolidate their flights. From July 1962 until United returned in July 1964, Midway's only scheduled airline was Chicago Helicopter. In August 1966 a total of four <b>fixed-wing</b> arrivals were scheduled, all United 727s (United was alone at Midway until early 1968).|$|E
5|$|The term {{ambulance}} does, however, {{extend to}} {{a wider range of}} vehicles other than those with flashing warning lights and sirens. The term also includes a large number of non-urgent ambulances which are for transport of patients without an urgent acute condition (see below: Functional types) and a wide range of urgent and non-urgent vehicles including trucks, vans, bicycles, motorbikes, station wagons, buses, helicopters, <b>fixed-wing</b> aircraft, boats, and even hospital ships (see below: Vehicle types).|$|E
5|$|There are an {{estimated}} 27,000 civil aircraft registered in the UK, 96percent of which are engaged in GA activities. In 2005 the GA fleet comprised 9,000 <b>fixed-wing</b> aircraft, 4,100 microlights, 1,300 helicopters, 1,800 airships/balloons, 2,500 gliders and some 7,000 hang gliders. Estimates put the number of foreign-registered GA aircraft based in the UK at 900.|$|E
5|$|These {{aircraft}} {{were due}} to become obsolete in the late 1950s, and the RAN considered purchasing modern aircraft of French or Italian design, which were better suited to light carrier operations than equivalent British aircraft, or replace Melbourne with a larger carrier. Instead of pursuing either alternative, the Australian government announced in 1959 that Melbourne would be reconfigured during her 1963 refit to operate as a helicopter carrier. The <b>fixed-wing</b> aircraft of the Fleet Air Arm were marked for replacement by 27 Westland Wessex anti-submarine helicopters. A reduction of embarked plane numbers to four Sea Venoms and six Gannets, along with regular rotation and careful use of the aircraft, extended their service life until the mid-1960s, while {{the size of the}} air group was maintained by carrying up to ten Wessex helicopters. The decision to retire the <b>fixed-wing</b> component of the Fleet Air Arm was rescinded in 1963, and on 10 November 1964, a AU£212million increase in defence spending included the purchase of new aircraft for Melbourne.|$|E
5|$|Two {{international}} airports {{capable of}} serving large airliners – Kangerlussuaq Airport and Narsarsuaq Airport – were constructed as U.S. Air Force military bases during the Second World War {{and continue to}} be used for transatlantic flights. All other regional airports are STOL-capable and are served with Dash 7 and Dash 8 <b>fixed-wing</b> aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Air Greenland A/S, {{also known}} as Greenlandair, is the flag carrier airline of Greenland, jointly owned by the SAS Group (37.5%), the Greenlandic Government and the Danish Government. It {{operates}} a fleet of 32 aircraft, including 1 airliner used for transatlantic and charter flights, 9 <b>fixed-wing</b> aircraft primarily serving the domestic network, and 22 helicopters feeding passengers from the smaller communities into the domestic airport network. Flights to heliports in the remote settlements are operated on contract {{with the government of}} Greenland.|$|E
5|$|At 03:58, C-130E, #72-1297, {{flown by}} a crew from the 776th Tactical Airlift Squadron, was {{destroyed}} by a 122mm rocket while taxiing to pick up refugees after offloading a BLU-82 at Tan Son Nhut Air Base. The crew evacuated the burning aircraft on the taxiway and departed the airfield on another C-130 that had previously landed. This was the last USAF <b>fixed-wing</b> aircraft to leave Tan Son Nhut. Between 04:30 and 08:00 up to 40 artillery rounds and rockets hit around the DAO Compound.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{difficulty}} and risk of meeting the Huaorani on the ground, the missionaries chose to drop gifts to the Huaorani by <b>fixed-wing</b> aircraft. Their drop technique, developed by Nate Saint, involved flying around the drop location in tight circles while lowering the gift from the plane on a rope. This kept the bundle in roughly {{the same position as}} it approached the ground. On October 6, 1955, Saint made the first drop, releasing a small kettle containing buttons and rock salt. The gift-giving continued during the following weeks, with the missionaries dropping machetes, ribbons, clothing, pots, and various trinkets.|$|E
5|$|During the war, the Germans {{carried out}} 51 airship raids and 52 <b>fixed-wing</b> bomber raids on England, which {{together}} dropped 280 tons of bombs. The casualties amounted to 1,413 killed, and 3,409 wounded. The success of anti-air defence measures was limited; of the 397 aircraft {{that had taken}} part in raids, only 24 Gothas were shot down (though 37 more were lost in accidents), despite an estimated rate of 14,540 anti-air rounds per aircraft. Anti-zeppelin defences were more successful, with 17 shot down and 21 lost in accidents.|$|E
5|$|Grand Theft Auto clones offer {{players the}} ability to steal and drive a number of vehicles. Games have {{included}} all kinds of vehicles, such as cars, helicopters, boats, jet-skis, <b>fixed-wing</b> aircraft, and military vehicles. Reviewers have compared these games {{based on the number}} of vehicles they offer, with greater choice resulting in better reviews. Players can also use vehicles as weapons, either by driving into enemies, or by damaging the vehicle until it explodes. Some games allow vehicles to perform stunts. Games in the genre thus incorporate elements of driving simulation games. Some games even allow players to customize their vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{two types}} of <b>fixed-wing</b> {{aircraft}} were operated from Melbourne. de Havilland Sea Venom FAW.53 fighter aircraft were flown by 805 Squadron RAN and 808 Squadron RAN, while Fairey Gannet anti-submarine strike aircraft were operated by 816 Squadron RAN and 817 Squadron RAN. At {{the time of their}} arrival, the Sea Venoms were the only radar equipped and all-weather combat aircraft in the Southern Hemisphere. At Melbournes commissioning, the standard air group consisted of eight Sea Venoms and two squadrons of eight Gannets, with two Bristol Sycamore search-and-rescue helicopters added shortly after the carrier entered service.|$|E
5|$|Offshore {{helicopter}} operations commenced out of Brønnøysund Airport in 1981, when Helikopter Service was contracted for fly to exploration {{field on}} Trænabanken. A combined <b>fixed-wing</b> and helicopter hangar {{was completed in}} 1983. The contract changed to Lufttransport from 1984. Operations remained limited and in 1989 the airport only saw 34 helicopter flights. The exploration resulted in a positive find on the Norne field, which started production in 1997. Norsk Helikopter, later renamed Bristow Norway, established a helicopter base at Brønnøysund Airport n 2002 and took over flights to the Skarv Oil Field.|$|E
5|$|The Brazilian Air Force sent five <b>fixed-wing</b> {{aircraft}} and three helicopters {{to the region}} for an extensive search and rescue (SAR) operation. As many as 200 personnel were reported {{to be involved in}} the operation, among them a group of Kayapo people familiar with the forest. The crash site of Gol Flight 1907 was spotted on 30September by the BAF, at coordinates , 200km (120mi) east of Peixoto de Azevedo, near Fazenda Jarinã, a cattle ranch. It was reported that rescue personnel had difficulty reaching the crash site due to the dense forest.|$|E
5|$|The December 1970 OAG shows 86 weekday arrivals (77 jet) on 13 <b>fixed-wing</b> {{airlines}} from 31 airports, but the August 1974 shows 14 arrivals (all jet) on four airlines, and in 1976–79 Midway {{had only}} {{the two or three}} Delta DC-9s from St Louis. Midway Airlines arrived on October 31, 1979 with DC-9 nonstops to Kansas City, Detroit and Cleveland Lakefront; they expanded greatly in the 1980s. Their September 1989 timetable shows 117 weekday departures to 29 cities, plus 108 departures on their commuter affiliates to 22 more cities. Midway quit flying in 1991.|$|E
5|$|The Harrier has two control {{elements}} {{not found in}} conventional <b>fixed-wing</b> aircraft: the thrust vector and the reaction control system. The thrust vector refers to the slant of the four engine nozzles and can be set between 0° (horizontal, pointing directly backwards) and 98° (pointing down and slightly forwards). The 90° vector is normally deployed for VTOL manoeuvring. The reaction control is achieved by manipulating the control stick and is similar in action to the cyclic control of a helicopter. While irrelevant during forward flight mode, these controls are essential during VTOL and STOL manoeuvres.|$|E
5|$|The RAN had no {{need for}} most of its <b>fixed-wing</b> {{aircraft}} after Melbourne was decommissioned in 1982, and two years later the ten remaining A-4Gs were sold to the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) for training purposes. Between 1986 and 1991 these aircraft were upgraded and re-designated A-4Ks. Two of the former A-4Gs crashed during 2001, resulting in the death of a pilot. The RNZAF's Skyhawks were retired in 2001. Eight A-4Ks, including six former A-4Gs, were sold to Draken International in 2012 and are in service supporting United States military training exercises.|$|E
