25|$|However, metal <b>foil</b> <b>capacitors</b> do {{not have}} {{self-healing}} properties. A breakdown in the dielectric film of a film/foil capacitor leads to an irreversible short circuit. To avoid breakdowns caused by weak spots in the dielectric, the insulating film chosen is always thicker than theoretically required by the specific breakdown voltage of the material. Films of less than 4µm generally are not used for film/foil capacitors because of their excessively high numbers of point defects. Also. the metallic foils only can be produced down to about 25µm in thickness. These tradeoffs make the film/foil capacitor the most robust but also the most expensive method for increasing surge current handling.|$|R
50|$|Most of the {{material}} in this section is a summary from the Massachusetts College of Fine Arts (MCLA) library website.Sprague used $25,000 of his savings to open Sprague Specialties Company {{at his home in}} Quincy, MA, in 1926. One of his first products was the mini condenser (an old name for capacitor). Mini condensers were commonly used in radio applications for noise filtering, signal coupling and tone controls. Early capacitors were two pieces of metal foil wrapped between wax paper or any other type of suitable insulation material. The type of insulating material determined the capacitor's storage capacity (measured in Farads) and the voltage tolerated. Wire leads from the capacitor connect to each metal <b>foil.</b> <b>Capacitors</b> were also useful in high power applications like motors, and soon Sprague turned his attention those areas as well.|$|R
25|$|Leakage is {{equivalent}} to a resistor in parallel with the capacitor. Constant exposure to heat can cause dielectric breakdown and excessive leakage, a problem often seen in older vacuum tube circuits, particularly where oiled paper and <b>foil</b> <b>capacitors</b> were used. In many vacuum tube circuits, interstage coupling capacitors are used to conduct a varying signal from the plate of one tube to the grid circuit of the next stage. A leaky capacitor can cause the grid circuit voltage to be raised from its normal bias setting, causing excessive current or signal distortion in the downstream tube. In power amplifiers this can cause the plates to glow red, or current limiting resistors to overheat, even fail. Similar considerations apply to component fabricated solid-state (transistor) amplifiers, but owing to lower heat production {{and the use of}} modern polyester dielectric barriers this once-common problem has become relatively rare.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} concept of pulsed plasma {{thruster}} (PPT) micropulsing. Micropulsing was a premise behind a power processing unit (PPU) and an energy storage unit (ESU) design that for certain mission profiles, it was advantageous to operate a PPT at lower energy but higher frequency rather than at a higher energy but lower frequency. This premise allows for reductions in the ESU volume and mass without paying a penalty in thrust. To complete the evaluation, an independent spark plug initiation unit, a {{high voltage power supply}} and a variety of mica <b>foil</b> <b>capacitors</b> at 2. 6, 5, 10, and 20 capacitance were used to conduct a series of tests on a single PPT to map performance levels of thrust, impulse bit, efficiency and specific impulse over a comparable power range. Testing at NASA Glenn Research Center was conducted with breadboard PPT hardware. The test results showed that operating in the lower energy ESU micropulsing mode produced similar thrust levels to a higher energy ESU operating at high power level. Further testing however showed a reduction in specific impulse and efficiency when the smaller capacitances were used at the highest power levels. This would require more fuel mass for a mission that was predominately high power, potentially negating the ESU mass savings. Therefore, micropulsing is advantageous where most of a mission profile occurs at low power, but retains the ability to conduct high thrust maneuvers when necessary...|$|R

5000|$|For decades, {{scientists}} and engineers have been attempting to make computers smaller and more efficient. A crucial component of computers are capacitors. A capacitor is a device that is made {{of a pair of}} electrodes separated by an insulator that each stores an opposite charge. A capacitor stores a charge when it is removed from the circuit that it is connected to; the charge is released when it is replaced back into the circuit. Capacitors have an advantage over batteries in that they release their charge much more quickly than a battery. [...] Traditional or <b>foil</b> <b>capacitors</b> are composed of thin metal conducting plates separated by an electrical insulator, which are then stacked or rolled and placed in a casing. The problem with a traditional capacitor such as this is that they limit how small an engineer can design a computer. Scientists and engineers have since turned to nanotechnology for a solution to the problem. [...] Using nanotechnology, researchers developed what they call “ultracapacitors.” An ultracapacitor is a general term that describes a capacitor that contains nanocomponents. Ultracapacitors are being researched heavily because of their high density interior, compact size, reliability, and high capacitance. This decrease in size makes it increasingly possible to develop much smaller circuits and computers. Ultracapacitors also have the capability to supplement batteries in hybrid vehicles by providing a large amount of energy during peak acceleration and allowing the battery to supply energy over longer periods of time, such as during a constant driving speed. This could decrease the size and weight of the large batteries needed in hybrid vehicles as well as take additional stress off the battery. However, the combination of ultracapacitors and a battery is not cost effective due to the need of additional DC/DC electronics to coordinate the two.|$|R

40|$|In many domains, {{characterizations}} {{of a given}} attribute are imprecise, uncertain and incomplete in the available learning examples. The definitions of classes may be vague. Learning systems are frequently forced {{to deal with such}} uncertainty. Traditional learning systems are designed to work in the domains where imprecision and uncertainty in the data are absent. Those learning systems are limited because of their impossibility to cope with uncertainty [...] a typical feature of real-world data.

An inductive learning problem is formulated as to find a fuzzy logic relation with a degree of truth, in which a fuzzy gain calculation method is used to guide heuristic search.

Hydrogen was produced using pure aluminum powder at the observed temperature range of 230 – 340  °C and under corresponding saturated vapor pressure, and hydrogen production increased significantly with temperature. The reaction mechanism is in accordance with water reduction by aluminum, which results {{in the production of}} hydrogen and formation of boehmite (AlO(OH)) as a by-product. In an attempt to determine a more environmentally friendly hydrogen production method, the application of aluminum derived from waste, i.e., aluminum casing and aluminum <b>foil</b> from <b>capacitor</b> waste, was also examined. A similar mechanism to that with pure aluminum powder was indicated, but with a lower reaction rate due to the smaller specific surface area of the waste material.

Kinetic analysis of the reactions suggests that the reaction rate is strongly affected by the pore size and the reaction pressure.
