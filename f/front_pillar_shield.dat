He has full control over their density, being able to make them soft to cushion impacts or falls, or hard as rock to inflict damage. He can create a wide variety of shapes including <b>pillars,</b> <b>shields,</b> body armor, platforms to levitate himself and others, etc. He has also been shown launching his bricks as projectiles.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} faces west on Broadway. Because it sits {{between two}} raised rail lines, {{it is nearly}} invisible until one is next to it. The only sign still visible inside or outside the building is a painted notice on the <b>front</b> <b>pillar</b> that says “No Parking Cabs Only”. The method of construction has retained its integrity after 50 years of abandonment.|$|R

50|$|The Forum at {{the present}} Meienbergstrasse lane hosted on its eastern side (Rütistrasse) a stone with two {{distinctive}} <b>front</b> <b>pillars.</b> The forum was accessible by a wide staircase and by a double door to the main room. The foundations are rreserved, {{as well as the}} pivots of the door leaf and the locking hole. Due to its central location and the <b>front</b> <b>pillars,</b> the building may also interpreted as a temple. The front of the large square was completed by symmetrical lateral walls. To the west of the plant, there was another stone building with columns, maybe uses as a Curia or temple.Public institutions, such as the spas, are suspected at the area of the present cemetery at the St. Ursula church, and a walled temple precinct with two Gallo-Roman temples, a fire altar and two chapels on the northwest of the settlement at the Seewiese area, then the edge of the settlement on Kempratnerbucht. On the exit road (Rütistrasse-Rebacker) towards Vitudurum, a digger fire field with around 50 burials archaeologically was recorded.|$|R

50|$|The New School's {{teaching}} and learning philosophies are derived mainly from Howard Gardner's theory of Multiple Intelligences and the Coalition of Essential Schools with which it is affiliated. As a result, The New School is known for a teaching style based around essential questions and critical thinking, {{with a focus on}} student-centered learning. Symbolic of the school's multiple-intelligence orientation is a series of illuminated designs mounted on the eight <b>front</b> <b>pillars</b> of the new addition, each design symbolic of one of the eight intelligences.|$|R
50|$|The Thebes Courthouse in Thebes, Illinois, is {{the former}} county {{courthouse}} of Alexander County. Plans to build the courthouse began in 1845, when the county seat moved to Thebes from Unity. Architect L. I. Lightner planned the courthouse, which he designed in a Southern Greek Revival style featuring a two-story porch and four <b>front</b> <b>pillars.</b> Contractor Ernstt Barkhausen built the courthouse for $4,400, and the building was completed in 1848. It served as Alexander County's courthouse until the county seat moved to Cairo in 1860.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{wind tunnel}} {{measurement}} and numerical simulation of a 50 % scaled sedan model surface pressure distribution {{were made in}} order to provide fundamental data for improving the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation accuracy of the aerodynamic noise related flow field around automobiles. The pressure measurement positions of the wind tunnel experiment were on the side window and the door. The wind tunnel test section speed was 30 m/s at 0 ° yawing angle. As for the CFD simulation, the wind tunnel shape computational domain and four settings of the near wall computational mesh were made. Both the k-ω SST and the Realizable k-ε turbulence models were chosen. And three value ranges of the near wall computational mesh’s dimensionless wall distance (y) were realized. Compared with the experimental data, the pressure coefficient (CP) simulation results showed good agreement with the measurement at the re-attaching region on the side window and the attaching region on the door. But the large CP prediction errors happened in the region of the <b>front</b> <b>pillar</b> vortex, the side view mirror wake. It was also shown that the predicted CP values were almost independent of the y value, except the comparatively larger CP predicted errors on the side window obtained by using the k-ω SST turbulent model when the y value ranged from 4 to 7. Further unsteady CFD simulation and the exterior aerodynamic noise measurement need be carried out due to the unsteady features of the separated flows, including the <b>front</b> <b>pillar</b> vortex and the side view mirror wake...|$|R

50|$|Nail Men or Men of Nails (Nagelmänner) were {{a form of}} {{propaganda}} and fundraising {{for members of the}} armed forces and their dependents in the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the German Empire in World War I. They consisted of wooden statues (usually of knights in armour) into which nails were driven, either iron (black), or coloured silver or gold, in exchange for donations of different amounts. Some took different forms, including <b>pillars,</b> <b>shields</b> or local coats of arms and crosses, especially the Iron Cross, and in German {{there are a variety of}} alternate names for them, including Wehrmann in Eisen or eiserner Wehrmann (Iron Guardian), Nagelfigur, Nagelbild or Nagelbrett (Nail Figure or Nail Board), Wehrschild (Defence Shield) and Kriegswahrzeichen (War Monument). The most famous were the original Wehrmann in Eisen in Vienna and the 'Iron Hindenburg', a 12 metre (42 foot) statue of Hindenburg adjacent to the Victory Column in Berlin.|$|R
50|$|Compared to the Mark 1, {{appearance}} of the car was transformed by an increase of 18% in cabin glass area greatly improving vision. The car was re-engineered above the waistline, slender <b>front</b> <b>pillars</b> allowed a wider windscreen and the rear window almost wrapped around to the enlarged side windows now with the familiar Jaguar D-shape above {{the back door and}} fully chromed frames for all the side windows. The radiator grille was amended and larger side, tail and fog lamps repositioned. Inside a new heating system was fitted and ducted to the rear compartment (although still notoriously ineffective). There was an improved instrument layout that became standard for all Jaguar cars until the XJ series II of 1973.|$|R

50|$|A trigonon is {{represented}} {{on one of}} the Athenian red-figured vases from Cameiros in the island of Rhodes, dating from the 5th century BCE, which are preserved in the British Museum. The triangle is here an irregular one, consisting of a narrow base to which one end of the string was fixed, while the second side, forming a slightly obtuse angle with the base, consisted of a wide and slightly curved sound-board pierced with holes through which {{the other end of the}} strings passed, being either knotted or wound round pegs. The third side of the triangle was formed by the strings themselves, the <b>front</b> <b>pillar,</b> which in modern European harps plays such an important part, being always absent in these early Oriental instruments. A small harp of this kind having 20 strings was discovered at Thebes, Greece in 1823.|$|R

Father Agustin wore a threadbare cassock and clumsy rawhide shoes, but he had an air of quiet dignity, and his sharply cut {{features}} were of the Gothic type, which is not uncommon in Spain. His accent was also clean Peninsular. James Grahame, who sat opposite across the chessboard, wore the same vague but recognizable stamp of breeding, though his duck suit was getting ragged and his red silk sash was obviously cheap. He had steady gray eyes, and light hair, a rather prominent nose and a firm mouth. He looked older than his thirty years. The lines on his forehead hinted at stern experience, and his alertness was partly masked by an easy self-control. Walthew was younger, and dressed with scrupulous neatness in duck, with smart tan shoes. His face was mobile, his glance quick but open, and his mouth sensitive; he {{had the look of}} an aristocratic American.|$|R
50|$|Intef {{is mainly}} known from his Theban tomb. This is a saff-tomb (TT386). It was fully decorated. The facade has several pillars with paintings, while the {{corridor}} behind {{was covered with}} relief decorated stone slabs. Behind the corridor there is a chapel also once decorated with slabs of stone, this time painted. Several of the paintings are well preserved on the <b>front</b> <b>pillars</b> and the wall behind them. They show the siege of a Palestine fortress, hunting in the marshes, agricultural scenes and workshops. The slabs of the corridor and cult chapel are only preserved in fragments. In the tomb appears the throne name: Mentuhotep II, confirming the dating of Intef under this king. At the cult chamber is {{the entrance to the}} underground burial chamber and there is standing uninscribed sarcophagus of Intef. In the tomb was also found a statue of Intef. Finally, in the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek in Copenhagen is a stela of the general.|$|R
50|$|This {{instrument}} {{consists of}} a pear-shaped body, to which is added a curved neck supported on a <b>front</b> <b>pillar</b> or arm springing from the body, and therefore reminiscent of the harp. There are twelve catgut strings. The curved fingerboard, almost parallel with the neck, is provided with frets, and has in addition a thumbkey for each string, by means of which the accordance of the string is mechanically raised a semitone at will. The dital or key, on being depressed, acts upon a stop-ring or eye, which draws the string down against the fret, and thus shortens its effective length. The fingers then stop the strings as usual over the remaining frets. A further improvement was patented in 1816 as the British harp lute. Other attempts possessing less practical merit than the dital harp were the lyra-guitarre, which appeared in Germany, {{at the beginning of}} the 19th century; the accord-guitarre, towards the middle of the same century; and the keyed guitar.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In this study, {{we propose}} {{the method of}} optimally {{selecting}} material of <b>front</b> <b>pillar</b> (A-pillar) and package tray for minimizing weight while satisfying vehicle requirements on static stiffness and dynamic stiffness. First, we formulate a material selection optimization problem. Next, we establish the CAE procedure of evaluating static stiffness and dynamic stiffness. Then, to enhance the efficiency of design work, we integrate and automate the established CAE procedure using a commercial process integration and design optimization (PIDO) tool, PIAnO. For effective optimi-zation, we adopt the approach of metamodel based approximate optimization. As a sampling method, an orthogonal array (OA) is used for selecting sampling points. The response values are evaluated at the sampling points and then these response values are used to generate a metamodel of each response using the radial basis function regression (RBFr). Using the RBFr models, optimization is carried out an evolutionary algorithm that can handle discrete design variables. Material optimization result reveals that the weight is reduced by 49. 8 % while satisfying all the design constraints...|$|R

5000|$|Flowers, {{together}} with their containers, are {{an important element of}} the decorations for the tea ceremony. The flowers arranged in the simple [...] "thrown-in" [...] (nageire) manner suitable for tea ceremony are called chabana (茶花), and the containers for them are generically referred to as hanaire (花入). Hanaire may be of bronze or other metal, celadon and other types of ceramic, bamboo, or basketry. Bamboo hanaire (take-hanaire) came into being with the development of wabi-cha, as did hanaire of domestic Japanese ceramic ware such as Bizen ware and Shigaraki ware. Basketry hanaire (kago-hanaire) usually are reserved for use in the warm season, when the chabana will consist of an assortment of seasonal grassy flowers. The chabana may be hung on the back wall of the tokonoma, or on its main <b>front</b> <b>pillar</b> (tokobashira), in which cases the hanaire will have a ring attached to the back, or a small hole in the back, for the hook. Also, there are metal and bamboo hanaire designed to be hung by a chain from a hook in the ceiling of the tokonoma.

The church windows were destroyed in 1943 by the blast waves of bomb explosions nearby. The large main staircase at the tower was destroyed in 1944 by a bomb hit and the church roof of fire bombs. After rebuilding, the church interior from 1951 got a white coating on the walls with an orange-coloured ceiling. The new church windows were re-glazed in a yellowish hue. The two side altars were removed. In addition, there were a total of five side chapels in the church between the pillars in the inner church and the two side walls of the church ship. They were dedicated to various saints, such as Saint Elizabeth, Saint Rita and Saint Agnes. Behind the left <b>front</b> <b>pillar</b> was the entrance to the pulpit, which had a rectangular sounding board. The church was put under cultural heritage management in 1986 together with its location and the assignment to the Ernst May settlement around the church.
