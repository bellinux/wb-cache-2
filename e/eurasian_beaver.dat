25|$|The North American and Eurasian beavers are {{the only}} extant {{members of the family}} Castoridae, {{contained}} in a single genus, Castor. Genetic research has shown the modern European and North American beaver populations to be distinct species and that hybridization is unlikely. Although superficially similar to each other, there are several important differences between the two species. Eurasian beavers tend to be slightly larger, with larger, less rounded heads, longer, narrower muzzles, thinner, shorter and lighter underfur, narrower, less oval-shaped tails and shorter shin bones, making them less capable of bipedal locomotion than the North American species. Eurasian beavers have longer nasal bones than their North American cousins, with the widest point being {{at the end of the}} snout for the former, and in the middle for the latter. The nasal opening for the Eurasian species is triangular, unlike that of the North American race, which is square. The foramen magnum is rounded in the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>beaver</b> and triangular in the North American. The anal glands of the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>beaver</b> are larger and thin-walled with a large internal volume compared to that of the North American species. The guard hairs of the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>beaver</b> have a longer hollow medulla at their tips. Fur colour is also different. Overall, 66% of Eurasian beavers have pale brown or beige fur, 20% have reddish brown, nearly 8% are brown and only 4% have blackish coats. In North American beavers, 50% have pale brown fur, 25% are reddish brown, 20% are brown and 6% are blackish.|$|E
50|$|Aigas began a beaver {{demonstration}} project in 2006. Two <b>Eurasian</b> <b>beavers</b> were released into a 200-acre enclosure, {{which includes a}} loch and surrounding woodland. The beavers have since built lodges and {{had a number of}} kits.|$|R

50|$|The fur colour of <b>Eurasian</b> <b>beavers</b> varies geographically. Light, chestnut-rust is the {{dominant}} colour in Belarus.

25|$|These {{areas of}} water are {{inhabited}} by <b>Eurasian</b> <b>beaver,</b> which had disappeared {{some years ago}} due to intensive hunting, but which have now recovered their original population. Besides this, it is mostly a richness of birds that distinguishes the park's wetlands. It constitutes the southernmost extent in Sweden of the nesting area of many species, such as the greater scaup, the oldsquaw, the common scoter, and also a focus of important populations of red-necked phalarope, ruff, common greenshank and wood sandpiper. One also finds sometimes the Eurasian curlew, which is considered an endangered species.|$|E
25|$|Relatively low MHC {{diversity}} {{has been}} observed in the cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus), <b>Eurasian</b> <b>beaver</b> (Castor fiber), and giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca). In 2007 low MHC diversity was attributed a role in disease susceptibility in the Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii), native to the isolated island of Tasmania, such that an antigen of a transmissible tumor, involved in devil facial tumour disease, appears {{to be recognized as}} a self antigen. To offset inbreeding, efforts to sustain genetic diversity in populations of endangered species and of captive animals have been suggested.|$|E
25|$|The beaver (genus Castor) is a large, {{primarily}} nocturnal, semiaquatic rodent. Castor {{includes two}} extant species, the North American beaver (Castor canadensis) (native to North America) and <b>Eurasian</b> <b>beaver</b> (Castor fiber) (Eurasia). Beavers {{are known for}} building dams, canals, and lodges (homes). They are the second-largest rodent in the world (after the capybara). Their colonies create one or more dams to provide still, deep water to protect against predators, and to float food and building material. The North American beaver population was once more than 60 million, but as of 1988 was 6–12 million. This population decline {{is the result of}} extensive hunting for fur, for glands used as medicine and perfume, and because the beavers' harvesting of trees and flooding of waterways may interfere with other land uses.|$|E
5000|$|Localization of resources: in some species, such as <b>Eurasian</b> <b>beavers</b> (Castor fiber), {{localization}} of {{an adequate}} lodge area (a pond or a stream) is more beneficial {{in a group}} setting.

40|$|Mammalian scent marking {{is often}} {{associated}} with territorial defense. However, males and females may demonstrate different activity patterns and play different roles. Female mammals nurture the young during lactation, while males purportedly perform other tasks more frequently, such as territorial maintenance and defense. This paper investigates the contribution made by mated pairs of adult males and females to territorial scent-marking in the obligate monogamous <b>Eurasian</b> <b>beavers</b> (Castor fiber). We hypothesized that both sexes should show territorial behavior, and predicted that they deposit a higher proportion of scent marks at borders. We also hypothesized that a sexual dimorphism exists due to reproductive constraints on the females, and predicted that males should invest significantly more in scent-marking behavior than females during summer. We obtained behavioral data by radio tracking six mated pairs of <b>Eurasian</b> <b>beavers</b> during spring and summer 2000 - 2001 on two rivers in southeastern Norway. Our results showed that both males and females clustered their scent marks near territorial borders, but males deposited a larger number of scent marks than females and spent more time at borders. Males were also found to have a higher scent marking rate and scent marks per night than females during summer, but not during spring. Overall, scent marks per night were higher in males than females. We conclude that both males and females <b>Eurasian</b> <b>beavers</b> carry out territorial behavior by scent marking, but males carry a larger part of the territorial defense during summer when females lactate. Our results are discussed {{in the light of the}} codefense hypothesis...|$|R
25|$|The {{two species}} are not genetically compatible. North American beavers have 40 chromosomes, while <b>Eurasian</b> <b>beavers</b> have 48.

2500|$|The <b>Eurasian</b> <b>beaver</b> (Castor fiber) {{was nearly}} hunted to {{extinction}} in Europe, both for fur and for castoreum, a secretion from its scent gland {{believed to have}} medicinal properties. However, the beaver is now being re-introduced throughout Europe. Several thousand live on the Elbe and the Rhône and in parts of Scandinavia. A thriving community lives in northeast Poland, and the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>beaver</b> also returned to the Morava River banks in Slovakia and the Czech Republic. They have been reintroduced in Scotland (Knapdale), Bavaria, Austria, Netherlands, Serbia (Zasavica bog), Denmark (West Jutland) and Bulgaria and are spreading to new locations. The beaver became extinct in Great Britain in the sixteenth century: Giraldus Cambrensis reported in 1188 (Itinerarium ii.iii) that {{it was to be}} found only in the Teifi in Wales and in one river in Scotland, though his observations are clearly second hand. In 2001, Kent Wildlife Trust successfully introduced a family of beavers at Ham Fen, the last remaining ancient fenland in the county close to the town of Sandwich; these are now established and are breeding. In October 2005, six Eurasian beavers were reintroduced to Britain in Lower Mill Estate in Gloucestershire; in July 2007 a colony of four Eurasian beavers was established at Martin Mere in Lancashire, and a small population of probably Eurasian beavers is being monitored in Devon. [...] A trial re-introduction occurred in Scotland in May 2009. Feasibility studies for a reintroduction to Wales are at an advanced stage and a preliminary study for a reintroduction of beavers to the wild in England has recently been published.|$|E

Four species of mammals present in the park are considered endangered in Sweden. Thus, the Eurasian lynx [...] can be observed regularly around Öbyhalvön, Tinäset and Gärdsvekarna, alongside brown bears and gray wolves, although these are less frequent.

5000|$|The {{history of}} Bobrowniki {{dates back to}} {{the early years of the}} Kingdom of Poland, when this area was under {{authority}} of a castellan from Sieciechow.

40|$|Recent {{technological}} innovations {{have led to}} the development of miniature, accelerometercontaining electronic loggers which can be attached to free-living animals. Accelerometers provide information on both body posture and dynamism which can be used as descriptors to define behaviour. We deployed tri-axial accelerometer loggers on 12 free-ranging <b>Eurasian</b> <b>beavers</b> Castor fiber in the county of Telemark, Norway, and on four captive <b>beavers</b> (two <b>Eurasian</b> <b>beavers</b> and two North American beavers C. canadensis) to corroborate acceleration signals with observed behaviours. By using random forests for classifying behavioural patterns of beavers from accelerometry data, we were able to distinguish seven behaviours; standing, walking, swimming, feeding, grooming, diving and sleeping. We show how to apply the use of acceleration to determine behaviour, and emphasise the ease with which this non-invasive method can be implemented. Furthermore, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of this, and the implementation of accelerometry on animals, illustrating limitations, suggestions and solutions. Ultimately, this approach may also serve as a template facilitating studies on other animals with similar locomotor modes and deliver new insights into hitherto unknown aspects of behavioural ecolog...|$|R

40|$|<b>Eurasian</b> <b>beavers</b> (Castor fiber) live {{in family}} groups that defend territories against other conspecifics. Part of this {{territorial}} defence involves constructing scent mounds near the stream bank within territories and marking them with castoreum, a urine-based fluid from the castor sacs, and (or) anal-gland secretion. The {{aim of this}} study was to test the hypothesis that <b>Eurasian</b> <b>beavers</b> show one or more forms of territorial behavior when an intruder, simulated in the form of experimental scent mounds (ESMs), has scent-marked inside the territory. We predicted that beavers would show a stronger response to ESMs with castoreum than to those without. Results showed that 85 % of all beaver families (N = 20) made one or more behavioral responses to ESMs marked with castoreum from foreign adult males, whereas no ESMs presented without castoreum received a response. We therefore conclude that a main function of territorial marking by beavers is to advertise spatially related dominance status, thereby providing opportunities for intruders to assess the presence of the owner and reducing the cost and risks of agonistic conflict for both the owner and intruders. Additionally, it appears to be the scent emitted from an ESM and not the sight of it to which beavers respond...|$|R
50|$|In 2001, the Kent Wildlife Trust {{with the}} Wildwood Trust and Natural England {{imported}} two families of <b>Eurasian</b> <b>beavers</b> from Norway {{to manage a}} wetland nature reserve.

Territorial beavers were presented with scent from neighbouring and stranger adult males. Thirty-nine different active beaver families, 18 in 1998 and 21 in 1999, were presented with a two-way choice between two pairs of experimental scent mounds; mounds with castoreum from a neighbour and a stranger, and mounds with anal gland secretion from a neighbour and a stranger. Direct observations of the families during evenings showed that: (1) beavers sniffed both castoreum and anal gland secretion from a stranger significantly longer than from a neighbour, and (2) beavers responded aggressively (stood on the mound on their hind feet, pawing and/or overmarking) significantly longer to castoreum, but not to anal gland secretion, from a stranger than from a neighbour.
