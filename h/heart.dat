5|$|<b>Heart</b> {{failure is}} where the <b>heart</b> can't beat out enough blood {{to meet the needs}} of the body. It is {{generally}} a chronic condition, associated with age, that progresses gradually. Each side of the <b>heart</b> can fail independently of the other, resulting in <b>heart</b> failure of the right <b>heart</b> or the left <b>heart.</b> Left <b>heart</b> failure can also lead to right <b>heart</b> failure (cor pulmonale) by increasing strain on the right <b>heart.</b> If the <b>heart</b> is unable to pump sufficient blood, it may accumulate throughout the body, causing breathlessness in the lungs (pulmonary congestion; pulmonary edema), swelling (edema) of the feet or other gravity-dependent areas, decrease exercise tolerance, or cause other clinical signs such as an enlarged liver, cardiac murmurs, or a raised jugular venous pressure. Common causes of <b>heart</b> failure include coronary artery disease, valve disorders and diseases of cardiac muscle.|$|E
5|$|A 113-page guidebook titled To <b>Heart</b> 2: Master Guide was {{published}} by MediaWorks on January 15, 2005. The book contains poster artwork, the 'face patterns' of each character, selected CG scenes and a guide on how to play through each character's scenarios. Voice actress interviews are also included, {{as well as a}} brief guide on how to play through each scenario in To <b>Heart.</b> This was followed by another 192-page guidebook for the visual novel titled The Essence of To <b>Heart</b> 2: To <b>Heart</b> 2 Official Guidebook, which {{was published}} by Enterbrain on March 4, 2005. The book contains detailed character descriptions, a complete walk through to every heroine in the game, computer graphics, and interviews with the game's development staff. Enterbrain also released a 223-page guidebook entitled The Essence of To <b>Heart</b> 2 Portable: To <b>Heart</b> 2 Portable Official Guidebook for the PlayStation Portable version of the game on August 18, 2009. The guidebook is based on the original Essence for the PlayStation 2 game, but contained new and revised content for the PSP version.

5|$|Abnormalities in {{the normal}} sinus rhythm of the <b>heart</b> can prevent the <b>heart</b> from {{effectively}} pumping blood, and are generally identified by ECG. These cardiac arrhythmias can cause an abnormal but regular <b>heart</b> rhythm, such as a rapid <b>heart</b> rate (tachycardia, classified as arising from above the ventricles or from the ventricles) or a slow <b>heart</b> rate (bradycardia); or may result in irregular rhythms. Tachycardia is generally defined as a <b>heart</b> rate faster than 100 beats per minute, and bradycardia as a <b>heart</b> rate slower than 60. Asystole is the cessation of <b>heart</b> rhythm. A random and varying rhythm is classified as atrial or ventricular fibrillation depending if the electrical activity originates in the atria or the ventricles. Abnormal conduction can cause a delay or unusual order of contraction of the <b>heart</b> muscle. This can {{be a result of}} a disease process, such as <b>heart</b> block, or congenital, such as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Afterload, or {{how much}} {{pressure}} the <b>heart</b> must generate to eject blood at systole, is influenced by vascular resistance. It can be influenced by narrowing of the <b>heart</b> valves (stenosis) or contraction or relaxation of the peripheral blood vessels.|$|E

5|$|Archosaurs (crocodilians and birds) {{and mammals}} show {{complete}} {{separation of the}} <b>heart</b> into two pumps {{for a total of}} four <b>heart</b> chambers; it is thought that the four-chambered <b>heart</b> of archosaurs evolved independently from that of mammals. In crocodilians, there is a small opening, the foramen of Panizza, {{at the base of the}} arterial trunks and there is some degree of mixing between the blood in each side of the <b>heart,</b> during a dive underwater; thus, only in birds and mammals are the two streams of blood – those to the pulmonary and systemic circulations – permanently kept entirely separate by a physical barrier.|$|E
5|$|Bloodless <b>heart</b> {{surgery was}} pioneered by American surgeon Denton Cooley. It was also {{performed}} by doctor Jerome Kay in Los Angeles and the procedure soon {{spread around the}} world. Panday, who trained under the Canadian surgeon Wilfred Gordon Bigelow, adopted the technique and tailored it to Indian conditions. He performed bloodless open <b>heart</b> surgeries at KEM in the 1970s and 1980s. Bloodless <b>heart</b> surgery was cost-effective in India, as it did not require blood transfusions, reduced the chances of infection in case of infected blood, and further reduced postoperative costs. Bloodless <b>heart</b> surgery was also performed on Jehovah's Witnesses, as they refused donated blood.|$|E
5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 20th century, <b>heart</b> disease had surpassed {{infectious}} disease as {{the leading cause of death}} in the United States, and it is currently the leading cause of deaths worldwide. Since 1948, the ongoing Framingham <b>Heart</b> Study has shed light on the effects of various influences on the <b>heart,</b> including diet, exercise, and common medications such as aspirin. Although the introduction of ACE inhibitors and beta blockers has improved the management of chronic <b>heart</b> failure, the disease continues to be an enormous medical and societal burden, with 30 to 40% of patients dying within a year of receiving the diagnosis.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two stories}} {{about the origin of}} the name. One is that it was named by a {{traveler}} who arrived in the cove and found his [...] "Heart's Delight" [...] there. The second says that <b>Heart's</b> Delight and the communities of <b>Heart's</b> Desire and <b>Heart's</b> Content were named after fishing vessels, the <b>Heart's</b> Delight, the <b>Heart's</b> Desire and the <b>Heart's</b> Content, that fished out of the surrounding harbour during the fishery in the 17th and 18th centuries. <b>Heart's</b> Delight was settled in the late 18th century. The earliest reference to <b>Heart's</b> Delight in the Trinity parish records is the birth of Elizabeth Wolfrey, daughter of William and Elizabeth, in 1785.|$|R

5|$|Cardiomyopathy is a {{noticeable}} {{deterioration of the}} <b>heart</b> muscle's ability to contract, {{which can lead to}} <b>heart</b> failure. The causes of many types of cardiomyopathy are poorly understood; some identified causes include alcohol, toxins, systemic disease such as sarcoidosis, and congenital conditions such as HOCM. The types of cardiomyopathy are described according to how they affect <b>heart</b> muscle. Cardiomyopathy can cause the <b>heart</b> to become enlarged (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), constrict the outflow tracts of the <b>heart</b> (restrictive cardiomyopathy), or cause the <b>heart</b> to dilate and impact the efficiency of its beating (dilated cardiomyopathy). HOCM is often undiagnosed and can cause sudden death in young athletes.|$|E
5|$|Cardiovascular {{diseases}}, {{which include}} {{diseases of the}} <b>heart,</b> are {{the leading cause of}} death worldwide. The majority of cardiovascular disease is noncommunicable and related to lifestyle and other factors, becoming more prevalent with ageing. <b>Heart</b> disease is a major cause of death, accounting for an average of 30% of all deaths in 2008, globally. This rate varies from a lower 28% to a high 40% in high-income countries. Doctors that specialise in the <b>heart</b> are called cardiologists. Many other medical professionals are involved in treating diseases of the <b>heart,</b> including doctors such as general practitioners, cardiothoracic surgeons and intensivists, and allied health practitioners including physiotherapists and dieticians.|$|E
5|$|Coronary artery {{bypass surgery}} {{is one such}} operation. In this operation, one or more arteries {{surrounding}} the <b>heart</b> that have become narrowed are bypassed. This is done by taking blood vessels harvested from {{another part of the}} body. Commonly harvested veins include the saphenous veins or the internal mammary artery. Because this operation involves the <b>heart</b> tissue, a machine is used so that blood can bypass the <b>heart</b> during the operation.|$|E

5|$|Coronary {{artery disease}} {{is also known}} as ischemic <b>heart</b> disease, is caused by {{atherosclerosis}} – a build-up of plaque along the inner walls of the arteries which narrows them, reducing the blood flow to the <b>heart.</b> A stable plaque may cause chest pain (angina) or breathlessness during exercise or at rest, or no symptoms at all. A ruptured plaque can block a blood vessel and lead to ischaemia of the <b>heart</b> muscle, causing unstable angina or a <b>heart</b> attack. In the worst case this may cause cardiac arrest, a sudden and utter loss of output from the <b>heart.</b> Obesity, high blood pressure, uncontrolled diabetes, smoking and high cholesterol can all increase the risk of developing atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease.|$|E
5|$|Diseases {{may also}} affect the {{pericardium}} which surrounds the <b>heart,</b> which when inflamed is called pericarditis. This {{may result from}} infective causes (such as glandular fever, cytomegalovirus, coxsackievirus, tuberculosis or Q fever), systemic disorders such as amyloidosis or sarcoidosis, tumours, high uric acid levels, and other causes. This inflammation affects {{the ability of the}} <b>heart</b> to pump effectively. When fluid builds up in the pericardium this is called pericardial effusion, which when it causes acute <b>heart</b> failure is called cardiac tamponade. This may be blood from a traumatic injury or fluid from an effusion. This can compress the <b>heart</b> and adversely affect the function of the <b>heart.</b> The fluid can be removed from the pericardial sac using a syringe in a procedure called pericardiocentesis.|$|E

5|$|Exercise {{and fitness}} levels, age, body temperature, basal {{metabolic}} rate, {{and even a}} person's emotional state can all affect the <b>heart</b> rate. High levels of the hormones epinephrine, norepinephrine, and thyroid hormones can increase the <b>heart</b> rate. The levels of electrolytes including calcium, potassium, and sodium can also influence the speed and regularity of the <b>heart</b> rate; low blood oxygen, low blood pressure and dehydration may increase it.|$|E
5|$|For {{diseases}} of the <b>heart</b> rate or rhythm, {{a number of different}} antiarrhythmic agents are used. These may interfere with electrolyte channels and thus the cardiac action potential (such as calcium channel blockers, sodium channel blockers), interfere with stimulation of the <b>heart</b> by the sympathetic nervous system (beta blockers), or interfere with the movement of sodium and potassium across the cell membrane, such as digoxin. Other examples include atropine for slow rhythms, and amiodarone for irregular rhythms. Such medications are not the only way of treating {{diseases of}} <b>heart</b> rate or rhythm. In the context of a new-onset irregular <b>heart</b> rhythm (atrial fibrillation), immediate electrical cardioversion may be attempted. For a slow heartbeat or <b>heart</b> block, a pacemaker or defibrillator may be inserted. The acuity of onset often affects how a rhythm disturbance is managed, as does whether a rhythm causes hemodynamic instability, such as low blood pressure or symptoms. An instigating cause is investigated for, such as a <b>heart</b> attack, medication, or metabolic problem.|$|E
5|$|For many {{diseases}} of the <b>heart,</b> including atrial fibrillation and valvular disease, and after a <b>heart</b> operation, anticoagulation {{in the form of}} aspirin, warfarin, clopidogrel or novel oral anticoagulants is often given simultaneously, because of an increased risk of stroke or, {{in the context of a}} clotted <b>heart</b> vessel, rethrombosis.|$|E
