5000|$|CML Microcircuits is {{believed}} to be the oldest fabless semiconductor company in the UK. Formed in December 1968, CML was created by George Gurry from a frequency <b>detection</b> <b>switch</b> company. The idea was to create single chip solutions rather than a ‘box' using several standard components. It was called Consumer Microcircuits Ltd then and it originally focused on possible supply of remote controls to the toy industry, with certain advances into technology that would be used in the same industry, for example, the logic circuit for generating cyclic signals. [...] Everyone came to know the company as CML so in 2002 the company was re-branded as CML Microcircuits. The offices were in London's Old Street until 1971 when the company moved to Essex and to the current location in Langford, Essex in 1999.|$|E
40|$|This {{protocol}} {{describes a}} new and rapid isothermal reaction process designed to amplify and detect a specific DNA sequence in purified DNA extracted from cultured cells. The protocol uses a DNA nanomachine that comprises two molecular switches that function in concert to isothermally amplify and detect a DNA target. First, a molecular beacon <b>detection</b> <b>switch</b> is 2 ̆ 7 activated 2 ̆ 7 only if a DNA target sequence is present. A DNA primer and DNA polymerase are used to lock the beacon in an activated conformation. Second, an amplification and signal-transduction switch is initiated following successful activation. A nicking endonuclease and the DNA polymerase are used to replicate the DNA target. Both switches operate simultaneously at 40 °C in a single reaction to rapidly generate multiple copies of the DNA target in a cyclic polymerization reaction. This protocol enables femtomole amounts of a DNA target to be reproducibly amplified and detected i...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} support context-dependency in model-based development, three {{components}} need to be realised: Context <b>Detection,</b> Context <b>Switching</b> and Context Handling. Context detection is the process for detecting changes in context, while context switching brings the system in the new state {{that needs to be}} supported. Finally, context handling adapts the interaction possibilities to the current context. In this paper we discuss an approach for context <b>detection</b> and <b>switching</b> for virtual environments that is based on the Event-Condition-Action paradigm. Both context <b>detection</b> and <b>switching</b> are split-up and supported by our graphical notation for the design of multimodal interaction techniques. The main advantage of this approach is that we provide the designer with a flexible context system, supported by scalable diagrams...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} novel probe systems for real-time PCR that provide higher specificity, greater sensitivity, and lower cost relative to dual-labeled probes. The seven DNA <b>Detection</b> <b>Switch</b> (DDS) -probe systems reported here employ two interacting polynucleotide components: a fluorescently labeled probe and a quencher antiprobe. High-fidelity detection is achieved with three DDS designs: two internal probes (internal DDS and Flip probes) and a primer probe (ZIPR probe), wherein each probe {{is combined with}} a carefully engineered, slightly mismatched, error-checking antiprobe. The antiprobe blocks off-target detection {{over a wide range}} of temperatures and facilitates multiplexing. Other designs (Universal probe, Half-Universal probe, and MacMan probe) use generic components that enable low-cost detection. Finally, single-molecule G-Force probes employ guanine-mediated fluorescent quenching by forming a hairpin between adjacent C-rich and G-rich sequences. Examples provided show how these probe technologies discriminate drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis mutants, Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7, oncogenic EGFR deletion mutations, hepatitis B virus, influenza A/B strains, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the human VKORC 1 gene...|$|E

30|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the problem of the fault <b>detection</b> for <b>switched</b> T-S fuzzy systems with actuator faults. The system faults and unknown disturbances are considered to be in a finite frequency domain. An effective fault detection filter is designed to measure the fault sensitivity and disturbance robustness. By using Parseval’s theorem and S-procedure, a new finite frequency method of fault <b>detection</b> for <b>switched</b> T-S fuzzy systems is formulated. Sufficient linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) conditions are proposed to design the fault detection filter, which can guarantee the finite frequency H_- and H_∞ performance. The effectiveness of the given finite frequency method for switched T-S fuzzy systems is illustrated through two numerical simulation examples.|$|R
5000|$|A {{dangerous}} {{variant of}} shafting involves entering elevator shafts, either {{to ride on}} the top of the elevators, or to explore the shaft itself. This activity is sometimes called elevator surfing. The elevator is first switched to [...] "manual" [...] mode, before boarding or exiting, and back to [...] "automatic" [...] mode after, to allow normal operation (and avoid <b>detection).</b> <b>Switching</b> elevators, getting too near the ceiling (or under the elevator) or the counterweight (or cables), or otherwise failing to follow safety precautions can lead to death or injury, which tends to inconvenience both the individual at fault and the hacking [...] "community". Crackdowns may increase in both frequency and harshness, both legally and with respect to physical access to coveted locations.|$|R
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of prospective memory (PM) typically increases from childhood to young adulthood and then decreases in later adulthood. The current study used event-related brain potentials (ERPs) {{to examine the}} development of the neural correlates of processes associated with the detection of a PM cue, switching from the ongoing activity to the prospective task, retrieval of the intention from memory or task set configuration, and strategic monitoring of the environment. The study included 99 participants that were 7. 5 to 83 years of age. Slow wave activity related to strategic monitoring was reliable across the lifespan suggesting that all ages were able to allocate attentional resources to facilitate PM. Additionally, components of the ERPs related to cue <b>detection,</b> <b>switching,</b> and task configuration were reliable across the lifespan, suggesting that similar processes contribute to PM at all ages. In children, PM errors may have resulted from a decoupling of processes supporting cue <b>detection</b> and <b>switching</b> from the ongoing activity to the prospective element of the task. In younger and older adults, PM errors appeared to result from the failure to detect PM cues in the environment. These findings lead to the conclusion that different processes may contribute to variation in PM across the lifespan...|$|R

40|$|Material {{indentation}} is {{a popular}} method for determining the mechanical properties of biomaterials. The basic premise of an indentation experiment is to physically displace the sample using an indenter that measures resistive force, in order to formulate a force-displacement curve. However, doing so requires estimating the initial contact event between the indenter and the sample—a statistical changepoint detection problem {{that has not been}} rigorously addressed in the biomaterials literature to date. Here we adopt a hierarchical Bayesian approach to contact point determination based on switching regressions, which generalizes an algorithm popular with practitioners and enables both hyperparameter estimation as well as uncertainty quantification. Results using several experimentally obtained silicone indentation data sets indicate that our approach outperforms existing techniques.

40|$|We have {{constructed}} {{an experimental}} station (beamline) at the National Synchrotron Light Source to measure circular dichroism (CD) using soft x-rays (250 {le} hv {le} 900 eV) {{from a time}} modulated elliptically polarizing wiggler. The polarization of the soft x-ray beam switches periodically between two opposite polarizations, hence permitting the use of phase-sensitive (lock-in) detection. While the wiggler can be modulated at frequencies up to 100 Hz, switching transients limit the actual practical frequency to {approx} 25 Hz. With analog <b>detection,</b> <b>switching</b> transients are blocked by a chopper synchronized to the frequency and phase of the wiggler.

One way to evaluate the mixer is to measure how fast the activity <b>detection</b> <b>switches</b> for continuously changing speakers in different seat positions.

Due to time and space constraints, the speech mixer presented here was subjectively evaluated by a remote speaker for scenarios involving conversation with passengers seated in different seat positions in real driving conditions. During {{the first part of the}} conversation, the mixer was turned off, and for second part of the conversation, the mixer was turned on. The remote speakers always positively acknowledged the improved speech situation from the car when the mixer was turned on.|$|R
