5|$|The 193738 {{season was}} purely domestic, with no {{international}} matches, {{but it was}} an opportunity for all players to push for selection in the squad for the 1938 Ashes tour. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>another</b> disappointing season for Queensland, who were again winless; they lost three matches, hung on for a draw, eight wickets down in another, and the other two fixtures were washed out before the second innings. Tallon scored 204 runs at 22.66 without managing a half-century and made 17 dismissals.|$|E

5|$|Colbeck {{was born}} in Bradford and {{attended}} Pudsey Tyersal School. Bradford City youth team coach Jon Pepper {{brought him to the}} club in 2002, and having rising through the junior ranks at City, Colbeck had barely featured for the reserves when he made his senior debut in a League Cup defeat to Notts County on 25 August 2004 at Valley Parade. It was his only first-team game during the season. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>another</b> 17months before his next appearance for City when he was a late substitute on 7 January 2006 in a 1–0 defeat to Chesterfield. Colbeck broke into the team on a more regular basis and made 11appearances, including five starts, during {{the latter half of the}} 2005–06 season, and was one of six junior players to earn a one-year contract at the League One club.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{troubles}} in 1878, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>another</b> good season for Grace {{on the field}} as he completed a sixth successive double with 1,151 runs and 153 wickets.

In the field, he held 42 catches and took 153 wickets with a best analysis of 8–23. His bowling average was 14.43; he took five wickets in an innings 13 times and ten wickets in a match six times.|$|E
5|$|Five {{years after}} the original, Thompson {{returned}} to Nanny McPhee with 2010's Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang. Her screenplay transported the story to Britain during the Second World War, and incorporated a new cast including Maggie Gyllenhaal. Building on the first film's success, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>another</b> UK box office number one and the sequel was widely seen as an improvement. The same year, Thompson reunited with Alan Rickman for the BBC television film The Song of Lunch, which focused on two unnamed characters meeting at a restaurant 15 years after ending their relationship. Thompson's performance earned her a fourth Emmy Award nomination.|$|E

5|$|In April 1963, Galaxy Publishing {{brought out}} {{the first issue of}} Worlds of Tomorrow, another science-fiction {{magazine}}, also edited by Pohl. The magazine published some well-received material and was profitable, but Guinn, the publisher and owner, decided in 1967 {{that it would be better}} to have Galaxy resume a monthly schedule; both Worlds of Tomorrow and Galaxy were bimonthly at that time, while If was monthly. With the August 1967 issue Worlds of Tomorrow was merged with If, though <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>another</b> year before Galaxy actually switched to a monthly schedule. By this time, If had become monthly again, starting with the July 1964 issue (though the schedule had an initial hiccup, omitting September 1964).|$|E

The part of the western wall that fell had crashed through the wall and roof of the neighbouring Royal Avenue Theatre (now the Playhouse Theatre) in Northumberland Avenue, which was being reconstructed at the time. Six people died (two workmen on the roof, a W.H. Smith bookstall vendor and three workmen on the Royal Avenue Theatre site).|$|E
5|$|Max Power conceded {{a penalty}} scored by Reuben Reid {{early in the}} {{penultimate}} {{game of the season}} against Plymouth. He himself equalised the score inside the first half, but soon after Plymouth regained the lead through Tareiq Holmes-Dennis. With ten minutes remaining, the hosts doubled the lead and though Kayode Odejayi scored in the final minutes <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>another</b> Tranmere defeat. As Hartlepool United, since December led by former Tranmere Rovers manager Ronnie Moore, won their home game against Exeter City, Tranmere lost their last chance to remain in the Football League. In the final game of the season Alan Rogers gave teenager Tolani Omotola an opportunity to make his Football League debut as Bury won the game by a single Tom Soares goal, to win promotion to the League One.|$|E

5|$|Mercedes {{hit back}} in the second session on Friday night, with Nico Rosberg leading his {{teammate}} Lewis Hamilton by about a tenth of a second. The Ferraris were about half a second behind, with Räikkönen again the faster of the two. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>another</b> dismal session for Jenson Button who had to park his car halfway through the session, though he was able to come back for a couple of laps {{towards the end of the}} session. A late red flag came out when Vettel, braking slowly into turn one, was clipped by the Force India of Sergio Pérez, taking off part of his front wing endplate.|$|E
5|$|As {{with his}} {{previous}} crossings, steamers took the crowds from Circular Quay, although this time only four were needed, while another 600–700 people {{made their own}} way to the site. The ride was scheduled for 3 pm on 23 December, but delays meant L'Estrange did not appear until 6 pm. Although the length of rope was over 182 metres, it was only just over nine metres above the water. The stay wires were held in boats on either side, with the crews rowing against each other to keep it steady. L'Estrange rode his bicycle towards the centre, where, with the rope swinging to and fro, he stopped briefly to steady himself but instead, realising he was losing his balance, {{he was forced to}} leap from the rope and fell into the water below. Although he was unhurt, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>another</b> knock to his reputation. A repeat attempt was announced for the following weekend. Again steamers took a dwindling crowd to Banbury Bay where they found L'Estrange's rope had been mysteriously cut, and he cancelled the performance. The Daily Telegraph reported that many in the crowd, who had paid for tickets on the steamers, felt they had been scammed.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his form}} in 193839, Tallon eagerly awaited {{the arrival of}} England for the 194041 tour of Australia. He was only 23 and {{regarded}} as an almost certain selection following his record-breaking performance with both bat and gloves. However, {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War called a halt to his rise and robbed him of the opportunity to represent his country while in his prime as a cricketer; official international cricket did not resume until he was 29. In the meantime, domestic cricket continued in 193940. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>another</b> poor season for Queensland, who won only once and lost their remaining five matches. Tallon scored two fifties before scoring 154 in his last Sheffield Shield innings of the season. This set Victoria a target of 230, but they reached it for the loss of only one wicket. Tallon was selected for The Rest of Australia in a one-off match against New South Wales {{at the end of the}} season, but managed only a duck and eight. He ended the summer with 401 runs at 28.62 and 17 dismissals.|$|E

5|$|Grace's first {{match was}} for the United South of England Eleven (USEE) against Twenty of Rochdale from Thursday, 2 May to Saturday, 4 May at Butcher's Meadow in Rochdale. The match was drawn after USEE had been behind on first innings. Although they saved the game, largely because Grace scored 57 in the second innings, {{it was not an}} auspicious {{performance}} by a team that included W. G. and Fred Grace along with five players who had taken part in the inaugural Test series in Australia the previous year: Henry Charlwood, Harry Jupp, James Lillywhite, Billy Midwinter and James Southerton. From Rochdale, Grace travelled by train to London for his next fixture on Monday, 6 May and Tuesday, 7 May which was for MCC at Lord's against a team called the Colts of England. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>another</b> odds match with 11 against 22 and another draw. Grace made scores of 15 and 9. His team included A. N. Hornby, Alfred Shaw and Fred Morley.|$|E
5|$|In 1908–09, the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association became {{completely}} {{professional and}} {{changed its name}} to the Eastern Canada Hockey Association (ECHA). This led to the retirement of several stars, including Ottawa's Harvey Pulford and Montreal's Russell Bowie, who insisted on keeping their amateur status. The Montreal Victorias and Montreal HC founded the Interprovincial Amateur Hockey Union, leaving only Ottawa, Quebec, Montreal Wanderers and Montreal Shamrocks in the ECHA. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>another</b> season of player turn-over for Ottawa. Besides Pulford, Ottawa lost Alf Smith, who formed a competing Ottawa Senators professional team in the Federal League, and Tommy Phillips, who joined Edmonton. The club picked up Bruce Stuart from the Wanderers, Fred Lake from Winnipeg and Dubby Kerr from Toronto. This lineup had a successful season, winning 10 out of 12 games. Walsh led all scorers with 38 goals in 12 games, while Stuart had 22 and Kerr had 20. The season was clinched with a win against the Wanderers on March 3 in Ottawa, 8–3, as Ottawa won the league and Stanley Cup.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} session on Friday afternoon, Nico Rosberg was fastest, setting a time of 1:21.531. With the track tarmac still being very new, the surface was {{slippery}} and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>another</b> session that {{saw a lot of}} drivers get caught out. The biggest accident of the practice came after just five minutes, when Max Verstappen crashed at the exit of the stadium, bringing out red flags. After the running resumed, Valtteri Bottas lost the rear of his Williams FW37, caused by a fault in his DRS flap, and crashed at turn one. He {{was not the only one}} having problems in the first corner, as Sergio Pérez, Carlos Sainz Jr. and Pastor Maldonado also went off there. Lewis Hamilton meanwhile had an off-track moment at turn four. Romain Grosjean had to end his first practice of the weekend early, when a clutch failure saw him park his car 28 minutes into the session. Jenson Button ran 25 laps and finished ninth fastest albeit spending half of the session in the pit lane, while the team equipped his car with a new power unit. Behind Rosberg, the two Red Bull drivers were second and third, ahead of Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel.|$|E
