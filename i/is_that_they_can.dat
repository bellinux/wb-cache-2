5|$|Freshwater {{bivalves}} in {{the order}} Unionoida have a different lifecycle. Sperm is drawn into a female's gills with the inhalant water and internal fertilization takes place. The eggs hatch into glochidia larvae that develop within the female's shell. Later they are released and attach themselves parasitically to the gills or fins of a fish host. After several weeks they drop off their host, undergo metamorphosis and develop into juveniles on the substrate. An advantage of this to the molluscs <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> disperse upstream along with their temporary hosts, rather than being constantly swept downstream by the water flow.|$|E
5|$|Their surface carries {{specific}} tools {{designed to}} cross the barriers of their host cells. The {{size and shape of}} viruses, and the number and nature of the functional groups on their surface, is precisely defined. As such, viruses are commonly used in materials science as scaffolds for covalently linked surface modifications. A particular quality of viruses <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be tailored by directed evolution. The powerful techniques developed by life sciences are becoming the basis of engineering approaches towards nanomaterials, opening a wide range of applications far beyond biology and medicine.|$|E
5|$|Cagebirds such as canaries, budgerigars, cockatoos, lovebirds, quails, finches, and parrots {{are popular}} pets, whether for their song, their behaviour, their {{colourful}} plumage, or {{their ability to}} mimic speech. Among reasons for their popularity <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be kept in homes too small or otherwise unsuitable for dogs or cats. The cagebird trade {{in some parts of}} the world threatens certain species with extinction, when birds are illegally captured in the wild. For example, in Indonesia, at least 13 species are close to extinction including the Indonesian national bird, the Javan hawk-eagle, while five subspecies including the scarlet-breasted lorikeet may have become extinct in the wild.|$|E

5|$|Newborns {{have black}} natal coats and bright pink skin. Females {{are the primary}} {{caregivers}} of infants, but males also play a role. In its first few days, the infant {{may be unable to}} stay attached to its mother and relies on her for physical support. However, its grasp grows stronger by its first week and it is able to cling to its mother's fur by itself. By two weeks, the infant begins to explore its surroundings for short periods, but stays near her. The distance the infant spends away from its mother increases the older it gets. In general, higher-ranking females are usually more relaxed parents than females of lower rank, which usually keep their offspring close to them. However, this difference only lasts for approximately the first eight weeks of an infant's life. Olive baboons do not seem to practice co-operative parenting, but a female may groom an infant that is not hers. Subadult and juvenile females are more likely to care for another's young, as they have not yet produced offspring of their own. One theory for why immature females tend to seek out infants <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> prepare for their future roles as mothers. Infant baboons born to first-time mothers suffer higher mortality than those born to experienced mothers, which suggests that prior experience in caring for infants is important. Adult males in the groups also care for the infants, as {{they are likely to be}} related to them. Males groom infants, reducing the amount of parasites they may have, and calm them when they are stressed. They may also protect them from predators, such as chimpanzees. However, adult males exploit infants and use them to reduce the likelihood that other males will threaten them.|$|E
25|$|An {{advantage}} of open compressors <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> {{be driven by}} non-electric power sources, such as an internal combustion engine or turbine. However, open compressors that drive refrigeration systems are generally not totally maintenance-free throughout {{the life of the}} system, since some gas leakage will occur over time.|$|E
25|$|One {{feature of}} {{distributed}} grids <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be formed from computing resources belonging {{to one or}} more multiple individuals or organizations (known as multiple administrative domains). This can facilitate commercial transactions, as in utility computing, or make it easier to assemble volunteer computing networks.|$|E
50|$|Lobate debris aprons {{may be a}} {{major source}} of water for future Mars colonists. Their major {{advantage}} over other sources of Martian water <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> easily mapped from orbit and they are closer to the equator where manned missions are more likely to land.|$|R

25|$|One of the {{arguments}} made in favour of the flexibility mechanisms <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> reduce the costs incurred by Annex I Parties in meeting their Kyoto commitments. Criticisms of flexibility have, for example, included the ineffectiveness of emissions trading in promoting investment in non-fossil energy sources, and adverse impacts of CDM projects on local communities in developing countries.|$|E
25|$|Interpreters {{are used}} to execute source code from a {{programming}} language line-by-line. The interpreter decodes each statement and performs its behavior. One advantage of interpreters <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> easily be extended to an interactive session. The programmer is presented with a prompt, and individual lines of code are typed in and performed immediately.|$|E
25|$|It is {{noteworthy}} that intermodulation distortion is not present in the live audio and so it represents an artificial coloration to the live sound. One advantage of higher sampling rates <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> relax the low-pass filter design requirements for ADCs and DACs, but with modern oversampling sigma-delta converters this advantage is less important.|$|E
30|$|The {{advantages}} of joint optimization approaches for TC <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> {{take into account}} multiple objectives of outputs including throughput, interference, connectivity, and fairness. On the other hand, they have disadvantages because they involve more input parameters (like including traffic demands) and hence yield more complex optimization and coordination operations in the network.|$|R
50|$|Their {{advantages}} over orbiting spacecraft <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> make observations to a microscopic level and can conduct physical experimentation. Disadvantages of rovers compared to orbiters are the higher chance of failure, due to landing and other risks, and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> {{limited to a}} small area around a landing site which itself is only approximately anticipated.|$|R
50|$|When {{going from}} the {{classical}} theory to the quantum theory of supermembranes it <b>is</b> found <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> only exist in 11 dimensions, just as superstrings can only exist in 10 dimensions. When examining the energy spectrum (the allowed frequencies that a string can vibrate in) it <b>was</b> found <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> only <b>be</b> in discrete values corresponding to the masses of different particles.|$|R
25|$|What makes formal theorems {{useful and}} of {{interest}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> {{be interpreted as}} true propositions and their derivations may {{be interpreted as a}} proof of the truth of the resulting expression. A set of formal theorems may be referred to as a formal theory. A theorem whose interpretation is a true statement about a formal system is called a metatheorem.|$|E
25|$|Exokernels in {{themselves}} are extremely small. However, they {{are accompanied by}} library operating systems (see also unikernel), providing application developers with the functionalities of a conventional operating system. A major advantage of exokernel-based systems <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> incorporate multiple library operating systems, each exporting a different API, for example one for high level UI development and one for real-time control.|$|E
25|$|Electrodes {{can either}} be placed {{directly}} on brain areas of interest or can {{be placed in the}} subdural space of the brain. Subdural electrodes can shift slightly and can be affected by cerebrospinal fluid in the subdural space, which could interfere with the current used to stimulate the brain from the electrodes and possibly cause shunting and dissipate the current, making the stimulation's effect less accurate. However, an advantage of subdural electrode grids <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be left in the brain for multiple days, and allow functional testing during stimulation outside the operating room.|$|E

50|$|Absorbent {{products}} (include shields, undergarments, protective underwear, briefs, diapers, adult {{diapers and}} underpants) {{are the best}} known product types to manage incontinence. They are generally easy {{to get hold of}} in pharmacies or supermarkets. The advantages of using these <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> barely need any fitting or introduction by a health care specialist. The disadvantages with absorbent products <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> bulky, leak, have odors and can cause skin breakdown.|$|R
25|$|Every human {{community}} possesses language, which many regard as an innate and defining condition of humanity. However, {{the development of}} writing systems, and {{the process by which}} they have supplanted traditional oral systems of communication, have been sporadic, uneven and slow. Once established, writing systems generally change more slowly than their spoken counterparts. Thus they often preserve features and expressions which are no longer current in the spoken language. One of the great benefits of writing systems <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> preserve a permanent record of information expressed in a language.|$|E
25|$|In {{optimization}} problems, heuristic algorithms {{can be used}} to find {{a solution}} close to the optimal solution in cases where finding the optimal solution is impractical. These algorithms work by getting {{closer and closer to the}} optimal solution as they progress. In principle, if run for an infinite amount of time, they will find the optimal solution. Their merit <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> find a solution very close to the optimal solution in a relatively short time. Such algorithms include local search, tabu search, simulated annealing, and genetic algorithms. Some of them, like simulated annealing, are non-deterministic algorithms while others, like tabu search, are deterministic. When a bound on the error of the non-optimal solution is known, the algorithm is further categorized as an approximation algorithm.|$|E
25|$|Though the Animorphs {{can assume}} {{the form of}} any animal they touch, there are several {{limitations}} to the ability. The most vital <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> stay in animal form for a maximum of two hours, otherwise they {{will be unable to}} return to human form. Others include having to de-morph back to human in between morphs, only tight clothing being able to be carried over with a morph, and having to consistently maintain concentration during a morph to prevent the animal's natural instincts from overwhelming the human intellect. A benefit to morphing is that it allows the team to heal any superficial, non-genetic injury, sustained as a human or in a morph. Also, while in morph, they can telepathically communicate with anyone nearby.|$|E
5000|$|Their {{drawbacks}} <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> take {{a relatively}} {{long period of}} time to [...] "stabilize" [...] their load amount, and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> require a constant supply of water to the [...] "water brake housing" [...] for cooling. In many parts of the country, environmental regulations now prohibit [...] "flow through" [...] water, and so large water tanks must be installed to prevent contaminated water from entering the environment.|$|R
40|$|Strategic {{programming}} is an idiom for generic programming where {{the concept of}} a strategy plays a central role. A strategy is a generic, dataprocessing action. Strategies are first-class citizens as witnessed by a combinator style. Two important characteristics of strategies <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> traverse into compound data, and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> customized by type-specific actions. We provide a general definition of strategic programming, and we demonstrate how this idiom can be realized inside several programming language paradigms...|$|R

25|$|Biological {{weapons are}} {{difficult}} to detect, economical and easy to use, making them appeal to the terrorists. The cost of a biological weapon {{is estimated to be}} about 0.05 percent the cost of a conventional weapon in order to produce similar numbers of mass casualties per kilometer square. Moreover, their production is very easy as common technology can be used to produce biological warfare, like that used in production of vaccines, foods, spray devices, beverages and antibiotics. A major factor about biological warfare that attracts terrorists <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> easily escape, before the government agencies or secret agencies have even started their investigation. This is because the potential organism has incubation period of 3 to 7 days, after which the results begin to appear, thereby giving the terrorists a lead.|$|E
25|$|Access network: The {{user can}} {{connect to the}} IP-core of NGN in various ways, most of which use the {{standard}} Internet Protocol (IP). User terminals such as mobile phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs) and computers can register directly on NGN-core, {{even when they are}} roaming in another network or country. The only requirement <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> use IP and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). Fixed access (e.g., Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), cable modems, Ethernet), mobile access (e.g. W-CDMA, CDMA2000, GSM, GPRS) and wireless access (e.g.WLAN, WiMAX) are all supported. Other phone systems like plain old telephone service and non-compatible VoIP systems, are supported through gateways. With the deployment of the NGN, users may subscribe to many simultaneous access-providers providing telephony, internet or entertainment services. This may provide end-users with virtually unlimited options to choose between service providers for these services in NGN environment.|$|E
25|$|Optical fibers {{can be used}} as {{sensors to}} measure strain, temperature, {{pressure}} and other quantities by modifying a fiber so that the property to measure modulates the intensity, phase, polarization, wavelength, or transit time of light in the fiber. Sensors that vary the intensity of light are the simplest, since only a simple source and detector are required. A particularly useful feature of such fiber optic sensors <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can,</b> if required, provide distributed sensing over distances of up to one meter. In contrast, highly localized measurements can be provided by integrating miniaturized sensing elements with the tip of the fiber. These can be implemented by various micro- and nanofabrication technologies, such that they do not exceed the microscopic boundary of the fiber tip, allowing such applications as insertion into blood vessels via hypodermic needle.|$|E
