The recreation of songs from the original film, [...] "Ye Mera Dil" [...] and [...] "Khaike Paan Banaraswala", received mixed comments. Joginder Tuteja from Bollywood Hungama gave the album a 4 out of 5, noting its success at surprising its listener, and wrote [...] "Shankar Ehsaan Loy do exceedingly well with the soundtrack and establish their supremacy as the composer trio who can give their own even while rearranging the songs from the past." [...] Planet Bollywood gave a rating of 6.5 out of 10, praising its lyrics and vocals, and termed [...] "Aaj Ki Raat" [...] as [...] "the best song in the entire soundtrack". Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com was less impressed with the album, calling it [...] "Snazzy, good mix" [...] and writing [...] "This lavish enterprise <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of everything.

500|$|Tim Ashley {{wrote in}} The Guardian in 2009 that Khachaturian's {{popularity}} {{fell in the}} West, because of his image as one of Soviet music's [...] "". He argued, [...] "Such a view is simplistic, given {{that he had a}} major brush with the authorities in 1948. But it's also easy to see how he acquired his awkward reputation when you hear his Violin Concerto, dating from 1940. It's an immensely attractive work, full of his trademark Armenian folk flourishes, and the swaying, hypnotic Andante is notably beautiful. But the unforced optimism of the outer movements now seems unthinking when we realise it was composed at a time when Stalin was giving Prokofiev and Shostakovich hell." [...] In 2003 conductor Marin Alsop opined that Khachaturian is [...] "very underperformed" [...] and [...] "somewhat underrated". She commented further: [...] "His music, of course, <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of the edginess of the 20th-century sound, the dissonances coming in. But {{at the same time it}} marries this beautiful neo-romanticism and lush orchestration and the over-the-top approach, so I think, he can be quite relevant these days." ...|$|E

I wanted to have an idea that I wanted to communicate, and something communicable." [...] Moore noted that he did occasionally use his [...] "mumbling" [...] method as it [...] "puts you in the right direction as far as sounds, vowel sounds, and stresses on certain syllables.

King later confirmed the album's release date was pushed back to late summer 2009. An article on Slayer's website confirmed the album's name.

Moore, the band's vocalist and lyricist, has described {{the process of writing}} lyrics as an [...] "audio Rorschach test". The lyrics on Office of Strategic Influence feature political themes, but the lyrics on later releases are less political, instead being based on Moore's personal experiences.

[...] Stephanie Ochona reviewed for Renowned for Sound and gave the soundtrack 4.5 out of 5 ratings, she said, [...] "Set in the 80s where drugs and other experimentation was all the rage, music plays a big factor in the entire atmosphere of the movie. The soundtrack includes {{a diverse group of}} artists, from country stars, indie icons and modern rockers. All the songs featured help bring out the kind of mood a movie like Dallas Buyers Club is." [...] Ochona also said that, [...] "Without such an accurate soundtrack, the film wouldn't have made such a big impact, and both the visual and aural aspects work together to create a beautiful story of a man fighting for the right to live his life." ...|$|E
500|$|Several {{scenes in}} Inside Man {{required}} multiple-camera setups, {{which meant that}} Libatique had to instruct and work with multiple camera operators. Lee {{wanted to create a}} visual distinction between the characters Russell (Owen) and Frazier (Washington), while incorporating visual metaphors. Russell's scenes, in which he masterminds the bank heist, were shot with a Steadicam to suggest that the character is in control. Frazier's scenes, in which he is tasked with handling the hostage situation, were filmed with multiple hand-held cameras to display the character's confusion. Libatique explained, [...] "I said, 'We want {{to create a sense of}} control and largely centered frames with Clive’s character, and we want to have movement with Denzel’s.' Having three operators on the same character, I’d watch all three. In a handheld shot, a long lens <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of movement and a wider lens is inherently smoother. I would actually talk to the operator and tell him not to be so steady. It was the first time I’d worked with so many operators where I wasn’t one myself." [...] Telephone conversations between Russell and Frazier were shot using two cameras simultaneously filming the actors performing on two different sets of a soundstage at Steiner Studios. [...] Steadicam operator Stephen Consentino estimated that 80% of the film was shot with hand-held cameras or a Steadicam. A total of seven cameras were used to film the scene where the hostages are finally released. A Technocrane was used for a crane shot that would cover the following moment, in which the hostages are placed in buses.|$|E

The German source which estimates for all the North Korea's past nuclear test has instead made an initial estimation of 14kt, which is about the same (revised) yield as its previous nuclear test in 2013. However the yield estimation for January 2016 nuclear test was revised to 10kt in the subsequent nuclear test from North Korea.|$|E
