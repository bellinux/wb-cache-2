40|$|Well {{into the}} twentieth century, brick and stone were the {{materials}} used <b>in</b> <b>external</b> <b>walls.</b> Bricklaying and stonemasonry were the construction technologies employed for the exterior walls of virtually all major structures. However, with the rise in quality of life, the massive walls alone became incapable of fulfilling all the developed needs. Adjacent systems and layers had then to {{be attached to the}} massive layer. Nowadays, the external wall is usually composed of a layered construction. Each external wall function is usually represented by a separate layer or system. The massive layer of the wall is usually responsible for the load-bearing function. Traditional massive external walls vary in terms of their external appearance, their composition and attached layers. However, their design and construction process is usually a repeated process. It is a linear process where each discipline is concerned with a separate layer or system. These disciplines usually take their tasks away and bring them back to be re [...] ‐integrated in a layered manner. New massive technologies with additional function have recently become available. Such technologies can provide the external wall with other functions in addition to its load [...] ‐bearing function. The purpose of this research is to map the changes required to the traditional design and construction process when massive technologies with additional function are applied <b>in</b> <b>external</b> <b>walls.</b> Moreover, the research aims at assessing the performance of massive solutions with additional function when compared to traditional solutions in two different contexts, the Netherlands and Egypt.

40|$|Purpose / Context - This {{paper will}} examine the {{predicted}} energy consumption (MJ/m 2) of a resi-dential house made of rammed earth in sub-tropical, tropical and temperate climates of Australia using design data of the building fabric and glazing. Methodology - To improve energy performance of this building project, thermal simulation and comprehensive simulated data analysis were conducted, using BERSPro {{and according to the}} NatHERS Technical Note. This includes detailed analysis of heating and cooling energy (MJ/m 2). Different constructions, including rammed earth wall, lightweight wall and heavy weight wall were used as building fabrics to achieve a cost effective, energy efficient and sustainable solution Results- Thermal performance of rammed earth is similar to other constructions in sub-tropical and tropical climate. No insulation is required for a rammed earth built house in tropical climate for the proposed floor plan. However, it requires more insulation with rammed earth <b>in</b> <b>external</b> <b>walls</b> to achieve NCC-complaint 6 star rating in temperate climate. Key Findings / Implications – The research highlighted that the rammed earth <b>in</b> <b>external</b> <b>walls</b> of the proposed house achieved minimum 5 stars in sub-tropical climate and minimum 6 stars in tropi-cal climate without any changes of other building elements i. e. insulation, glazing, awning. On the other hand, rammed earth house in temperate climate didn’t achieve 6 stars without changing other building elements. Originality - Two research questions are highlighted in this study (a) What would be the thermal performance of the rammed earth compared to other constructions in these three climate zones (b) What are the changes required to any building element for energy performance improvement of this building project?

For this reason, the U-value of the entire wall may increase by up to 35 %.

The proposals include the following main principles in relation to fire-separation requirements: In case of internal fire exposure the protective structure for combustible building parts needs to meet {{at least half of the}} fire-separating requirement for the compartment of concern. In case of external fire exposure the protection time requirement can be 15 minutes less than for the internal protection. The proposals are applicable for residential buildings and offices.

40|$|This paper aims {{to present}} a study on validating a passive and {{quantitative}} infrared thermography (PQIRT) methodology to estimate the size of debond in rendered and tile composites <b>in</b> <b>external</b> <b>walls</b> of high-rise buildings. The accuracies of the PQIRT methodology were evaluated under four conditions, including (i) nine depths of debonds, (ii) three temperature ranges, (iii) two types of composites and (iv) changes of heat flux during a 2 -h diurnal and continuous monitoring. The method processed infrared images with a simple spatial pixel differentiation algorithm to determine temperature gradients, where the absolute temperature value was no longer required. The methodology was validated by comparing the estimated and the actual sizes of the debonds by statistical error analysis. In the rendered composites, the percentage error was at most 15 % for cover depths of debond {{up to 20 mm}} for all temperature ranges. In the tile composites, the error was at most 30 % for cover depths of debond up to 9 mm at all temperature conditions, while the estimation was erroneous for cover depths beyond 9 mm.

40|$|Purpose - Tile {{finishes}} {{are very}} commonly used <b>in</b> <b>external</b> <b>walls</b> of buildings. However, the ageing {{process of the}} tile system is very seldom studied, which makes maintenance scheduling on external wall finishes impossible. The paper aims to contend that weathering exposure {{is one of the}} main accelerators of delamination. This paper seeks to test empirically the effects of orientation and shading on the probability of wall tile delamination. Design/methodology/approach - This paper analyses the weathering effects, including orientation and shading, on thepercentage of deliminated areas of the external wall tiles by regression in a large estate in Hong Kong. Wall tile delamination data are collected from ten blocks of a high-rise housing estate in Hong Kong, multiple linear regression is used to analyse the effects of orientation and shading on the probability of failure of the wall tiling systems. Findings - The results of this paper indicate the effects of orientation and shading on the proportion of delamination of the external wall tile finishes. Research limitations/implications - The results agree with our contention that shaded areas are found to have lower rate of delamination, while north-west and exposed façades are found with serious delamination. The results have great implications on maintenance scheduling for external wall tile finishes. Exposed areas receiving intensive thermal and moisture cycles are found to have significantly higher probability of failure. The study is limited by the small number of samples. Practical implications - The results provide a set of data on the probability of failure of external wall tiling systems, for further ageing and durability analyses of external wall tiling systems. The findings are also of importance to designers and property managers for choosing external wall finishes and shading devices; and for maintaining external wall tile finishes. Originality/value - This paper is the first study on the probability of failure and weathering impacts on external wall tiling systems. It is also the first attempt to achieve the objectives by means of empirical evidence. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

This type of construction is common in Australia, the USA and Europe. In Australia plasterboard is commonly used <b>in</b> <b>external</b> <b>walls</b> with brick veneer as the outer skin of buildings. Plasterboard, however, is considered as a non-structural material and {{in the design of the}} studs in wall frames, the strengthening effects of the plasterboard in carrying axial (or other) loads is ignored. The Australian standard for cold-formed steel structures AS/NZS 4600 (1996) permits the use of lateral and rotational support to the steel studs in the plane of the wall provided by the lining material. However, it does not specify the magnitude of lateral or rotational support that can be used for the stud wall frames. Miller and Pekoz (1994 a) have carried out experiments on studs subjected to axial compression loads and concluded that the experimental results contradict the shear diaphragm model assumed by American specification (AISI, [...] .,, [...] ,. [...] 1986). A suitable design method to accurately predict the structural behaviour of studs under axial compression, bending and combined ·. axial compression and bending is required. As a first step in the development of the design methods, the axial compression loads must be studied. The objective of this research is therefore to determine a design model for the gypsum plasterboard lined cold-formed steel stud walls that can accurately represent their behaviour and to accurately predict the ultimate strength of the stud walls under axial compression. For this purpose, an extensive research project was undertaken using the following: 20 full scale tests on typical cold-formed steel stud wall frames (unlined, one side and both sides lined), 24 short stud column tests to study the effects of plasterboard lining on local buckling of flanges, fmite element analysis (FEA) of full scale cold- Y. K Telue: Behaviour and design of plasterboard lined cold-formed steel studwall·systems formed steel stud wall frames including validation with full scale test results and a detailed parametric study using FEA. It has been shown in this research that lining the plasterboard on one or both sides can increase the ultimate load of the' stud considerably. The Australian -and AISI specifications were found to be inadequate in predicting the ultimate loads and failure modes of the studs. This research has shown that by using appropriate effective length factors, the ultimate load and the failure modes of both the unlined and the. lined studs can be accurately. predicted using the provisions of AS/NZS 4600 (1996). In the case of lined studs, it has been shown that the effective length factors in the plane of the wall and·. for torsion can be related to the ratio of the fastener spacing to the total unbraced height' of the studs.

Mathematical inversion of the heat distribution over an <b>external</b> <b>wall</b> surface enables the measurement and calculation of debond size and boundary. It has been proven that the proposed methodology and algorithm are accurate, and can be used generally because they are not affected by factors like depth of debond, sizes of debond, surface temperatures, temperature scales set in the infrared camera and time when the thermograms are taken. This quantitative method allows the evaluation of the long term durability and facilitates planning of rehabilitation of tall buildings.
