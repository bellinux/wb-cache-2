50|$|An {{inverter}} {{can be used}} {{to control}} the speed of the compressor motor to drive variable refrigerant flow in a refrigeration or air conditioning system to regulate system performance. Such installations are known as <b>inverter</b> <b>compressors.</b> Traditional methods of refrigeration regulation use single-speed compressors switched on and off periodically; inverter-equipped systems have a variable-frequency drive that control the speed of the motor and thus the compressor and cooling output. The variable-frequency AC from the inverter drives a brushless or induction motor, the speed of which is proportional to the frequency of the AC it is fed, so the compressor can be run at variable speeds—eliminating compressor stop-start cycles increases efficiency. A microcontroller typically monitors the temperature in the space to be cooled, and adjusts the speed of the compressor to maintain the desired temperature. The additional electronics and system hardware add cost to the equipment, but can result in substantial savings in operating costs.|$|R

First, the reasons why the compressor vibrates are discussed, unbalanced forces of comprssor moving parts are the source of the vibration. The flexible parts in the vibration transmission route are also very critical, they are inner discharge tube, suspension springs, rubber grommets, and so on. When the natural frequencies of the system are similar to the source excitation frequencies, resonance will happen, vibrations will be very large. Second, one <b>inverter</b> <b>compressor</b> vibrations were tested, and the results show that the vibrations varied a lot in different speeds and directions. Then the reasons why the <b>inverter</b> <b>compressor</b> vibrations are very large in some speeds are analyzed in the third part. The natural frequencies of shell and grommets system and inner discharge tube were got by experiment or simulation. The results show that those natural frequencies are too close to the soure excitation frequencies in some speeds, that is the reason why the compressor vibrates so large. By the grommets and inner discharge tube redesigns, the natural frequecies are moved far away from excitation frequencies, the compressor vibrations are reduced.

40|$|Nowadays, {{with the}} unceasing human {{population}} growth and fast economic development, the global energy demand is also increasing unceasingly. Meanwhile, the increasing carbon dioxide emission has become a significant environmental problem. Building energy has now accounted for about 1 / 5 of the primary energy consumption all over the world. The number in China was 23. 39 % in 2009 {{and it is still}} growing fast. In particular, building sector has great potential of energy saving. With the development of renewable energy like solar energy and wind power, the energy structure in China can be more reasonable. What s more, part of the heating demand can be covered by heat pump whose efficiency is much higher than electric heating and gas heating. 	The conversion efficiency of a photovoltaic (PV) cell is greatly influenced by its temperature. According to experimental results, every 1 °C rise in cell temperature reduces the conversion efficiency by about 0. 4 % for multi-crystalline cells. Therefore, many researches have been done to decrease the PV panel temperature to increase the performance. Different types of PV/T collectors were developed to realize the comprehensive utilization of solar photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) energy. The main difference of these collectors is working media which can be air, water, refrigerant and heat pipe. 	When the air or the water was used as working media of PV/T collectors, it was usually heated to a high temperature for direct heating usage. This was actually on the opposite direction of conversion efficiency improvement. In this thesis, a PV panel was combined with a heat pump system. The refrigerant used in this work is propane (R 290) and it is an environmental friendly working fluid whose ODP and GWP is 0 and 3. The evaporator of the heat pump was fixed under the PV panel. This combination, which is called PV evaporator in the following, can improve the conversion efficiency by cooling the PV cells and absorb solar thermal energy to produce hot water with the help of heat pump at the same time. What s more, the temperature of refrigerant is constant and relatively low during evaporation, this is good for the performance of PV cells. Based on the concepts above, a test rig of PV/T heat pump system was designed and built. Experimental researches were taken under summer weather conditions of Trondheim. According to the experimental results, the conversion efficiency of the PV panel can reach 15. 5 % in the best case, it was increased by 6. 9 % compared with the nominal value. The efficiency was influenced by solar radiation, ambient temperature and angle of incidence. A higher ambient temperature leads to a lower efficiency. The influence of the solar irradiance is complicated, ordinarily, a higher solar radiation may cause a decline in efficiency. The PV evaporator can absorb heat both from solar radiation and environment, the heat-collecting efficiency ranged from 0. 45 to 0. 77 in the tests. The COP of the heat pump is greatly influenced by the condenser supply water temperature. COP decreases with the increasing condenser supply water temperature. Solar radiation and ambient temperature {{have a positive impact on}} COP. The average COP of the heat pump can reach 4. 3 when the water was heated from 14. 8 °C to 50. 6 °C. The fractional errors of the measured conversion efficiency, COP are 5 % and 5. 2 %. Simulation of the test rig was made by EES to study the performance of PV/T heat pump system at different places and climates. The effectiveness of the simulation was validated by comparing the simulated results and experimental results. Daily performance analysis on April 30 in Shanghai was done, and it indicated that a higher air temperature leads to a better comprehensive performance. Annual operation simulated results in Shanghai, Oslo, New Delhi were analyzed. Monthly average value of air temperature, solar radiation and wind speed was adopted as the rated condition for annual performance evaluation. The annual average COP in Shanghai, Oslo, New Delhi are 3. 5, 2. 8 and 4. 4, respectively. And the annual average conversion efficiency in Shanghai, Oslo, New Delhi are 16. 4 %, 17. 3 %, 15. 5 %.

40|$|A linear {{compressor}} for {{a domestic}} refrigerator-freezer has {{energy saving potential}} compared with a reciprocating compressor because of a low friction loss and free piston system. A linear compressor can control the piston stroke since {{it does not have}} mechanical restriction of piston movement.

40|$|Disponible au lien suivant : [URL] audienceA {{heat pump}} enables one to {{transfer}} heat from a heat source to {{a heat sink}} using mechanical work. In water heating systems, the heat sink is water and the heat source can be ambient or exhaust air, {{the ground in a}} closed water loop, groundwater in an open loop or any other medium in which heat can be recovered. In normal operating conditions, the produced thermal energy is at least two times higher than the mechanical work consumed. That is why heat pumping technology can be interesting compared to conventional boilers or electric heaters. This chapter deals with vapour-compression air-source heat pumps applied to water systems for space heating and domestic hot water production. First, the classic subcritical heat pump cycle is detailed in terms of processes by means of Mollier diagrams. Basic notions will be given concerning the efficiency of the cycle (coefficient of performance, exergetic efficiency) depending on different parameters such as temperature, high and low pressure, subcooling and superheating. This cycle is then compared to the transcritical cycle used with CO 2 for hot water production. The list of advantages (such as temperature glide at high pressure) and drawbacks (such as lower efficiency for low temperature water heating) of this cycle will tend to limit the use of the CO 2 transcritical cycle to DHW production. Secondly, some of the major improvements brought to the vapour compression cycle will be reported through works made by the research community on multi-stage and <b>inverter</b> <b>compressors,</b> expansion devices, such as ejectors and work recovery devices and the design or the specific use of heat exchangers. Multi-stage compressors enable one to achieve higher pressure ratios and to reduce the heat losses during the compression. Ejectors recover some kinetic energy of expansion and increase the suction pressure at the compressor. Work recovery devices produce some mechanical work that can be reused at compression to reduce the energy consumption. Other improvements are made using internal heat exchangers, desuperheaters for domestic hot water production, microchannels instead of regular tubes for refrigerant and a special fin design to enhance the convection heat transfer coefficient. Heat pumps can also satisfy simultaneous needs in heating and cooling to carry out energy savings. Finally, dealing with air-source heat pumps compels to examine two points: the frosting problems and the defrosting strategies. Frosting reduces the global performance by diminishing the air flow cross section area and by adding a thermal resistance between air and refrigerant. It appears when the ambient air temperature is low and grows faster when the air humidity is high. These conditions occur during winter, when the needs in space heating are high. So an efficient defrosting strategy becomes necessary to ensure the user a satisfactory winter seasonal performance. Conventional defrosting strategies such as hot-gas bypass, reversed-cycle, electric heating and other strategies more in a research phase using air recirculation or a two-phase thermosiphon are discussed in the final part of this chapter...|$|R

40|$|AbstractModern {{manufacturing}} industry needs {{to produce a}} precision product, minimal defects and also low maintenance so the production costs could be reduce as minimum as possible. Also to meets with environment and international standard, the efficient machinery tools needed to fulfill the standard requirement. On conventional oil chiller with On/Off system {{was not able to}} meet industrial needs, because it is bad accurate and low energy efficiency. Variable speed mode (VSM) replaced conventional ON/OFF system. VSM is a mode using an inverter to get high accuracy in keeping oil temperature steady out of the target. An accurate oil temperature control system within a very restricted range could be achieved by VSM system. In order to get low deviation from the targeted temperature, the oil cooling system with VSM need controlled by an inverter-driven refrigerator which has been applied to a new theory to control the oil temperature.

40|$|The {{capacities}} of performance improvements of low and mid-size heat pumps are studied in this project. For the new buildings market, {{the components of}} the heat pump match already well the requirements for high performance and monovalent heating. Minor improvements are to be expected on <b>inverter</b> driven <b>compressors</b> and on the integration of the domestic water in the heat pump cycle. This study is focused on the retrofit market (replacement of existing oil burners). For this case the existing air-water heat pumps are not economical and performance decrease rapidly at low air temperatures. A two-stage heat pump with two phase injection and an economiser vessel has been built in collaboration with Termogamma. It has been compared to a single-stage configuration (Pompe à chaleur biétagée à haute performance, Phase I). The measurements at steady state conditions show significant improvements on heat output and coefficient of performance for the refrigerants R 22 and R 407 C. In phase 2 of this project the tests are focused on a new defrosting scheme using energy stored at low exergy in the economiser. This method is compared to the reversed cycle defrosting at critical conditions A 2 /W 50 / 93 r. h. Both defrosting methods have equivalent performance reduction. Relative heat output reduction is - 12 % COP is reduced by - 4 % comparing to the steady state conditions (evaporator not frosted). Combining the two methods, reversed cycle and economiser, the overall performances are further improved (heat output - 7 % and COP - 3 %). The complete cycle length was limited by oil migration effects. The mechanisms of oil migration in two-stage heat pumps will be examined in a starting project at the Laboratory for Industrial Energy Systems (LENI). Several types of refrigerants are compared in the single-stage and two-stage case by simulation. The simulation includes real compressor and exchanger characteristics. The results show the important decrease of the coefficient of performance and the reduction of the heat output at low air temperatures. At higher temperatures the single stage mode is more adapted for the existing compressors. COP crossing occurs between 0 °C and 5 °C external air temperature. For the retrofit application, traditional heat pump design cannot be explored efficiently in the case of monovalent heating. This two stage concept is very promising, but oil migration problems have to be solved for commercialisation. The refrigerant cycle can be simplified, according to the refrigerant type used. The economiser did not show the expected improvement for the defrosting cycle. The major part of the energy potential could not be explored in the tests. For an air-air heat pump the increased refrigerant charge can be justified with the important improvements on the defrosting (only hot gas defrosting can be implemented in this case) ...|$|R
40|$|Variable {{capacity}} {{heat pumps}} represent {{the next wave}} of technology for heat pumps. In this report, the performance of two variable capacity heat pumps (HPs) is compared to that of a single or two stage baseline system. The units were installed in two existing research houses located in Knoxville, TN. These houses were instrumented to collect energy use and temperature data while both the baseline systems and variable capacity systems were installed. The homes had computer controlled simulated occupancy, which provided consistent schedules for hot water use and lighting. The temperature control and energy use of the systems were compared during both the heating and cooling seasons. Multiple linear regression models were used along with TMY 3 data for Knoxville, TN in order to normalize the effect that the outdoor air temperature has on energy use. This enables a prediction of each system's energy use over a year with the same weather. The first system was a multi-split system consisting of 8 indoor units and a single outdoor unit. This system replaced a 16 SEER single stage HP with a zoning system, which served as the baseline. Data was collected on the baseline system from August 2009 to December 2010 and on the multi-split system from January 2011 to January 2012. Soon after the installation of the multi-split system, some of the smaller rooms began over-conditioning. This was determined to be caused by a small amount of continuous refrigerant flow to all of the indoor units when the outdoor unit was running regardless of whether they were calling for heat. This, coupled {{with the fact that the}} indoor fans run continuously, was providing enough heat in some rooms to exceed the set point. In order to address this, the indoor fans were disabled when not actively heating per the manufacturer's recommendation. Based on the measured data, the multi-split system was predicted to use 40 % more energy in the heating season and 16 % more energy in the cooling season than the baseline system, for the typical meteorological year weather data. The AHRI ratings indicated that the baseline system would perform slightly better than the multi-split system, but not by as large of a margin as seen in this study. The multi-split system was able to maintain more consistent temperature throughout the house than the baseline system, but it did allow relative humidity levels to increase above 60 % in the summer. The second system was a split system with an <b>inverter</b> driven <b>compressor</b> and a single ducted air handler. This unit replaced a 16 SEER two stage HP with a zoning system. Data was collected on the baseline system from July 2009 to November 2010 and on the ducted inverter system from December 2010 to January 2012. The ducted inverter system did not offer a zone controller, so it functioned as a single zone system. Due to this fact, the registers had to be manually adjusted in order to better maintain consistent temperatures between the two levels of the house. The predicted heating season energy use for the ducted inverter system, based on the measured energy use, was 30 % less than that of the baseline system for the typical meteorological year. However, the baseline system was unable to operate in its high stage due to a wiring issue with the zone controller. This resulted in additional resistance heat use during the winter and therefore higher energy use than would be expected in a properly performing unit. The AHRI ratings would indicate that the baseline system would use less energy than the ducted inverter system, which is opposite to the results of this study. During the cooling season, the ducted inverter system was predicted to use 23 % more energy than the baseline system during the typical meteorological year. This is also opposite of the results expected by comparing the AHRI ratings. After a detailed comparison of the ducted inverter system's power use compared to that of a recently installed identical system at a retro-fit study house, there is concern that the unit is not operating as intended. The power use and cycles indicate that the unit is performing more like a single stage unit than a variable capacity unit. Analysis of the data indicates that a change in operating behavior occurred during a service call shortly after the installation of the unit. The logbook only indicates that refrigerant charge was added, but does not indicate any other change. This is being investigated further. While the energy comparison results of these two variable capacity heat pumps is generally underwhelming, it is difficult to draw any hard conclusions about the maximum attainable efficiency of these units when optimally installed. Both units appear to have undesirable conditions associated with the installation or operation, which could have had an adverse effect on their energy use...|$|R
