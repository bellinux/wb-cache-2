40|$|Fiber/matrix {{interface}} cracking {{plays an}} important role in determining the final failureof unidirectional (UD) composites. When subjected to longitudinally tensile loading,fiber/matrix interface <b>debonds</b> originate from fiber breaks or initial defects propagatealong loading direction. Depending on the quality of fiber/matrix interface, debondscould keep growing longitudinally which leads to the degradation of compositestiffness or kink out of interface and connect with neighboring <b>debonds</b> or fiberbreaks that forms a so called critical fracture plane which leads to the final failure ofUD composite. For UD composite subjected to transversely tensile loading, theinitiation, growth and coalesce of arc-shape fiber/matrix interface <b>debonds</b> result inthe formation of macro-size transverse cracks, the propagation and multiplication ofthese transverse cracks, although would not directly lead to the final failure ofcomposite, could cause significant stiffness degradation of composite structures. In the presence thesis, the growth of a fiber/matrix interface <b>debond</b> of a UDcomposite with hexagonal fiber packing under longitudinal and transverse tensileloading was investigated numerically, with the special focus on the influence ofneighboring fibers. In the current study, energy release rate (ERR) is considered as thedriving force for the <b>debond</b> growth and was calculated based on J Integral andVirtual Crack Closure Technique (VCCT) using finite element software ANSSY. Papers A – C in the present thesis deal with the influence of neighboring fibers on theERR of a <b>debond</b> emanating from a fiber break under longitudinal loading condition. In longitudinal loading case, <b>debond</b> growth is mode II dominated. In paper A, anaxisymmetric model consisting 5 concentric cylinders that represent broken fiber withdebond, surrounding matrix, neighboring fibers, surrounding matrix and effectivecomposite was generated. It’s found that there are two stages of <b>debond</b> growth, thefirst stage is when <b>debond</b> length is short, the ERR decreases with increasing debondlength, and the presence of neighboring fibers significantly increase the ERR ofdebond. For relatively long <b>debond,</b> the <b>debond</b> growth is steady when ERR is almostconstant regardless of <b>debond</b> length. In steady state of <b>debond</b> growth, the presenceof neighboring fibers have little effect on the ERR. In papers B and C, a 3 -D modelwas generated with broken fiber and its 6 nearest fibers in a hexagonal packed UDcomposite were modelled explicitly, surrounded by the homogenized composite. Based on the obtained results, it’s shown that ERR is varying along <b>debond</b> front, andhas its maximum at the circumferential location where the distance between two fibercenter is the smallest. This indicates that the <b>debond</b> front is not a circle. For steadystate <b>debond,</b> the presence of neighboring fibers have little effect on averaged ERR(averages of ERR along <b>debond</b> front). For short <b>debond,</b> the presences ofneighboring fibers increases the averaged ERR, and that increase is more significantwhen inter-fiber distance is the smallest. Paper D investigates the growth of afiber/matrix <b>debond</b> along fiber circumference under transverse loading. It’s foundthat <b>debond</b> growth in this case is mixed-mode, and both mode I and mode II ERRcomponents increase with increasing <b>debond</b> angle and then decreases. Debondgrowth is mode I dominated for small <b>debond</b> angle and then switch to mode IIdominated. The presence of neighboring fibers have an enhancement effect on debondgrowth up to certain small <b>debond</b> angle and then changes to a protective effect. InPaper E, the interaction between two arc-size <b>debond</b> under transverse loading isinvestigated. It’s found that when two <b>debonds</b> are close to each other, the interactionbetween two <b>debond</b> becomes much stronger, and that interaction leads to the increaseof ERR of each <b>debond</b> significantly, which facilitates further growth for bothdebond...|$|R

The aim of the present study was to quantitatively compare clinical survival of rebonded brackets with different ARI scores with new brackets rebonding. Materials and Methods: The subjects in the present study consisted of 74 patients with 76 <b>debonded</b> brackets on maxillary first and second premolars. After refreshing the bracket base of the <b>debonded</b> brackets, they were assigned in two groups: group A with 27 brackets of ARI≥ 4 and group B with 28 brackets of ARI≤ 2. In 21 cases, new brackets were used (group C). The frequency of the debonding in each rebonded group during treatment was calculated in intervals of 6, 12, 18 mounths after onset of bracket rebonding. Chi-squared test was used to compare the frequency of <b>debonded</b> brackets.

40|$|Most {{existing}} {{models for}} the problem of fibre/matrix stress-transfer through a partially <b>debonded</b> interface roughly solve the stress distribution in the <b>debonded</b> zone, neglecting {{the presence of the}} perfectly bonded zone. However the stress interactions between two zones is what makes the problem essentially different from the stress-transfer problem for a perfectly bonded interface. This paper suggests a variational approach based on the principle of minimum complementary energy not only in a perfectly bonded zone but also in a zone with a discontinuous interface. The <b>debonded</b> interface is treated as an external boundary on which a presumed interfacial shear stress is specified. A new analytical model, including stress non-uniformity in the radial direction and crack interaction, is derived to describe the stress state around fibre breaks and debonding tips in a single fibre embedded in an infinite matrix. For the presumed shear stress at the <b>debonded</b> interface the minimisation procedure renders the most accurate closed-form solution (under used assumptions) for both interactive zones. Finally, the 'best' shear stress distribution at the <b>debonded</b> interface is found by using Coulomb's friction law and simple numerical iterations. The stress profiles along both axial and radial directions are presented and compared with results from a numerical model(1) available in the literature and also from finite-element analysis. Good agreements are achieved. Extensive applications of this approach and the derived model are also discussed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|E

Indeed, besides the usual macroscopic displacement field, the macroscopic kinematics contains two other scalar fields.

To predict the failure load in design, a proper <b>debonding</b> model is required. It is now commonly accepted that the <b>debonding</b> process can be modelled as the propagation of an interfacial crack within which the shear stress (tau) decreases gradually with shear displacement (delta).

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{the case}} of RC members {{strengthened}} with CFRP, two kinds of failure will occur: a premature failure which is a <b>debonding</b> failure of anchorage zone can be detected {{in addition to the}} <b>debonding</b> failure mode which is induced by the crack occurrence of RC beam. The <b>debonding</b> failure of the anchorage zone means the CFRP cannot be used efficiently, and even leads to the inactivation of RC beam strengthened with CFRP. The test and FEM analysis give regularities of distribution of the shear stress of <b>debonding</b> failure of anchorage zone of RC beam strengthened with CFRP. The regularities of distribution of the stress of <b>debonding</b> failure mode, which is induced by the crack occurrence of RC beam, are simulated by FEM analysis.

The eective-medium approach makes use of the concept of a fictitious fiber whose load-carrying capacity is taken to be lost in the <b>debonding</b> direction but remains intact in the transverse direction. The finite-element analysis allows one to examine further the influence of <b>debonding</b> angle on the stiness of the composite and it also provides the needed magnitude for this angle at which the eective-medium ap-proach applies. It is found that the angle has to be suciently wide, but not so wide as to lead to a potential complete <b>debonding.</b> Such an angle also increases when the fibers become more ribbon-like, but it decreases with increasing volume concentration. The basic assumption that the fictitious fiber has zero, or very low, load-carrying capacity along the <b>debonding</b> direction is also verified by the finite-element results. For both double and single <b>debonding</b> the Young’s modulus of the composite along the <b>debonding</b> direction can be significantly reduced as the <b>debonding</b> angle increases. The local stress distributions inside the fiber and the matrix are also illustrated for both types of <b>debonding.</b> Ó 200...|$|R
