40|$|Centromeric {{regions in}} many complex {{eukaryotic}} species contain highly repetitive satellite DNAs. Despite {{the diversity of}} centromeric DNA sequences among species, the functional centromeres in all species studied to date are marked by CENP-A, a centromere-specific histone H 3 variant. Although it is well established that families of multimeric higher-order alpha satellite are conserved at the centromeres of human and great ape chromosomes and that diverged monomeric alpha satellite is found in old and new world monkey genomes, {{little is known about}} the organization, function, and evolution of centromeric sequences in more distant primates, including lemurs. Aye-Aye (<b>Daubentonia</b> <b>madagascariensis)</b> is a basal primate and is located at a key position in the evolutionary tree to study centromeric satellite transitions in primate genomes. Using the approach of chromatin immunoprecipitation with antibodies directed to CENP-A, we have identified two satellite families, <b>Daubentonia</b> <b>madagascariensis</b> Aye-Aye 1 (DMA 1) and <b>Daubentonia</b> <b>madagascariensis</b> Aye-Aye 2 (DMA 2), related to each other but unrelated in sequence to alpha satellite or any other previously described primate or mammalian satellite DNA families. Here, we describe the initial genomic and phylogenetic organization of DMA 1 and DMA 2 and present evidence of higher-order repeats in Aye-Aye centromeric domains, providing an opportunity to study the emergence of chromosome-specific modes of satellite DNA evolution in primate genomes...|$|R
5000|$|Nosy Mangabe is a {{small island}} reserve located in Antongil Bay about 2 km {{offshore}} {{from the town of}} Maroantsetra in north-east Madagascar. it is accessible by small boat and is part of the larger Masoala National Park complex. It is a tropical rainforest preserve and sanctuary for a species of lemur, the aye-aye (<b>Daubentonia</b> <b>madagascariensis).</b> It lies close enough to Maroantsetra for a day trip, although an overnight stay is recommended for seeing the nocturnal aye-aye.|$|R
50|$|Although {{it lacks}} a toothcomb (a {{specialized}} dental structure {{found in most}} lemuriforms), its front dentition is enlarged and procumbent. Its cranial and dental traits are {{comparable to that of}} the aye-aye (<b>Daubentonia</b> <b>madagascariensis),</b> suggesting a possible close relationship. Such a close relationship between an African fossil primate and the aye-aye within the lemur radiation could suggest that lemur evolution involved two dispersal events from Africa to Madagascar. However, affinities are unclear because the similarities may be due to convergent evolution.|$|R

5|$|Reproduction {{starts in}} November for Coquerel's giant mouse lemur at Kirindy Forest; the estrous cycle runs {{approximately}} 22days, while estrus lasts {{only a day}} or less. The mating season in this southern population {{is limited to a}} few weeks, whereas the northern giant mouse lemur is thought to breed throughout the year, a trend seen in only two other species of lemur: the aye-aye (<b>Daubentonia</b> <b>madagascariensis)</b> and the red-bellied lemur (Eulemur rubriventer). The northern giant mouse lemur had been observed breeding year-round in captivity if their litter did not survive or was removed, but at the time this population was thought to be Coquerel's giant mouse lemur.|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} 6 captive {{aye-ayes}} (<b>Daubentonia</b> <b>madagascariensis)</b> to discriminate scents from conspecifics of different age-sex classes was tested. The animals {{were presented with}} either unscented logs or logs that had been placed in: (1) their own cage, (2) the cages of adult males or (3) the cages of adult females with female offspring. Responses to the logs, measured by approaching, proximity, tapping, gnawing, sniffing, scent marking and vocalizations, were recorded for 30 min following presentation. Logs from females with offspring provoked the highest responses, and immature aye-ayes investigated logs more than adults of either sex. These results suggest that, {{as in many other}} prosimians, olfaction {{plays an important role in}} the communication systems of aye-ayes...|$|R
50|$|The {{reserve is}} mainly covered by dense {{deciduous}} dry forest {{and is the}} last place for the critically endangered lemur, Perrier's sifaka (Propithecus perrieri).

In addition subfossils of the following lemurs have been found at Ankarana: greater bamboo lemur (Prolemur simus), indri (Indri indri), the sloth lemurs (Babakotia radofilai), Mesopropithicus dolichobrachion and Palaeopropithicus cf ingens plus Pachylemur sp., the huge Megaladapis cf madagascariensis/grandidieri, and the baboon lemur Archaeolemur sp.|$|R
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{extinction}} of Plesiorycteropus, but MacPhee assumed it may have happened around 1000 years ago, when the extinction {{of the rest of the}} subfossil fauna of Madagascar is thought to have concluded. Nothing like it was reported by 17th-century European explorers of the island, and one bone has been radiocarbon dated to around 2150 Before Present (200 BCE). Its extinction is somewhat anomalous, as other recently extinct Madagascan animals—such as subfossil lemurs, Malagasy hippopotamuses, the giant fossa, and elephant birds—were generally larger and not exclusively insectivorous; also, some species with likely more specialized diets, such as the falanouc (Eupleres goudoti) and aye-aye (<b>Daubentonia</b> <b>madagascariensis),</b> did survive. Early human colonists of Madagascar may have caused the extinction of Plesiorycteropus through the destruction of the forest and other disturbances.|$|R

40|$|Arboreal {{animals with}} prehensile hands must balance the complex demands of bone strength, {{grasping}} and manipulation. An informative {{example of this}} problem {{is that of the}} aye-aye (<b>Daubentonia</b> <b>madagascariensis),</b> a rare lemuriform primate that is unusual in having exceptionally long, gracile fingers specialized for foraging. In addition, they are among the largest primates to engage in head-first descent on arboreal supports, a posture that should increase loads on their gracile digits. We test the hypothesis that aye-ayes will reduce pressure on their digits during locomotion by curling their fingers off the substrate. This hypothesis was tested using simultaneous videographic and pressure analysis of the hand, foot and digits for five adult aye-ayes during horizontal locomotion and during ascent and descent on a 30 degrees instrumented runway. Aye-ayes consistently curled their fingers during locomotion on all slopes. When the digits were in contact with the substrate, pressures were negligible and significantly less than those experienced by the palm or pedal digits. In addition, aye-ayes lifted their hands vertically off the substrate instead of 'toeing-off' and descended head-first at significantly slower speeds than on other slopes. Pressure on the hand increased during head-first descent relative to horizontal locomotion {{but not as much as}} the pressure increased on the foot during ascent. This distribution of pressure suggests that aye-ayes shift their weight posteriorly during head-first descent to reduce loads on their gracile fingers. This research demonstrates several novel biomechanical trade-offs to deal with complex functional demands on the mammalian skeleton...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT A {{study was}} carried out between July and August 1989 on the usage of the manual digits of one captive aye-aye (<b>Daubentonia</b> <b>madagascariensis)</b> at the Tsimbazaza Zoo, Antananarivo. Manipulation of the digits was {{examined}} by direct observation and by analysis of tapes taken with a video-camera. The third digit (the most slender) and the fourth digit (the longest) of both hands, were us-ed for scooping foods: the average duration of one scoop was 11. 9 seconds for the third digit and 14. 7 seconds for the fourth digit, with no substantial difference between them (t-test, p>O. 05). The aye-aye alternated between using {{the third and fourth}} digits, accor-ding to the foods presented. The third digit was also used for tapping food. The average duration of one tapping bout was 2. 9 seconds. The fourth digit was often used for grooming and for grasping a twig or holding Onto wire mesh while traversing. This report forms the experimental part of a series of papers examining the hard-nut adap-tation hypothesis of the aye-aye's ecological niche. In this investigation, the captive female aye-aye showed some extraordinary examples of feeding behavior. The aye-aye ate all foods except sugar cane, by using her third and fourth digits after tapping the food with her third digits. Primates often feed by holding a food item with the hands and biting off pieces direct-ly with the mouth. But the aye-aye did not eat in such a manner. This feeding behavior shows the specialization for consuming the contents of hard nuts of ramy (Canarium spp.) under natural conditions, and that the aye-aye's morphological characteristics are closely adapted to such a feeding method...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} high-coverage draft genome {{assembly}} of the aye-aye (<b>Daubentonia</b> <b>madagascariensis),</b> a highly unusual nocturnal primate from Madagascar. Our assembly totals ∼ 3. 0 billion bp (3. 0 Gb), {{roughly the size of}} the human genome, comprised of ∼ 2. 6 million scaffolds (N 50 scaffold size = 13, 597 bp) based on short paired-end sequencing reads. We compared the aye-aye genome sequence data with four other published primate genomes (human, chimpanzee, orangutan, and rhesus macaque) {{as well as with the}} mouse and dog genomes as nonprimate outgroups. Unexpectedly, we observed strong evidence for a relatively slow substitution rate in the aye-aye lineage compared with these and other primates. In fact, the aye-aye branch length is estimated to be ∼ 10 % shorter than that of the human lineage, which is known for its low substitution rate. This finding may be explained, in part, by the protracted aye-aye life-history pattern, including late weaning and age of first reproduction relative to other lemurs. Additionally, the availability of this draft lemur genome sequence allowed us to polarize nucleotide and protein sequence changes to the ancestral primate lineage—a critical period in primate evolution, for which the relevant fossil record is sparse. Finally, we identified 293, 800 high-confidence single nucleotide polymorphisms in the donor individual for our aye-aye genome sequence, a captive-born individual from two wild-born parents. The resulting heterozygosity estimate of 0. 051 % is the lowest of any primate studied to date, which is understandable considering the aye-aye's extensive home-range size and relatively low population densities. Yet this level of genetic diversity also suggests that conservation efforts benefiting this unusual species should be prioritized, especially in the face of the accelerating degradation and fragmentation of Madagascar's forests...|$|R
40|$|This report forms one of {{a series}} of papers {{examining}} my hypothesis that the aye-aye's (<b>Daubentonia</b> <b>madagascariensis)</b> unusual adaptation is more reasonably explained by a diet of hard-nuts rather than one of wood-boring insect larvae. An extensive survey showed that the distribution of the aye-aye and that of Canarium spp. (which bears hard-nuts) overlapped on the eastern coast and in the central highland of Madagascar. An intensive study was conducted at the Nosy Mangabe Special Reserve on a total of 33 nights during three different periods in 1988 and 1989. I observed the aye-ayes eating ramy nuts (Canarium spp.) throughout the entire observation period, the parasitical outgrowth of the cambial layer of Afzelia bijuga from June through October except for August, insect larvae, beans of Entada phaseoloides, and the flowers of Macaranga cuspidata from September to October. The aye-aye spends a relatively high proportion (over 40 %) of its time engaged in feeding during October and December when ramy forms the main part of its diet, while from June to July, and September, when other food items are additionally consumed, the proportion of resting time becomes relatively high (over 10 %). Although the aye-aye was often spotted singly, it was also common to see more than one individual (up to four) adjacent to another (13 % of all the observation units in which the aye-aye was spotted) throughout the observation periods. Two species of ramy (Canarium spp.) are distributed in the Nosy Mangabe Special Reserve. C. Boivini bore fruits over the entire observation period. A single nut of the ramy provides of 4. 38 kcal of energy and requires about two minutes on average for consumption. I estimated the nightly energy intake as 262. 8 kcal...|$|R
40|$|This report aims {{to clarify}} the nocturnal {{activity}} of the aye-aye (<b>Daubentonia</b> <b>madagascariensis)</b> under captive conditions to compare it with that under natural conditions. The aye-aye was nocuturnal and showed activity at any time at night. However, from 02 : 00 hrs until just prior to dawn, it often rested. It frequently returned to the nest throughout this period to take long rests of {{more than half an}} hour. The aye-aye's activities were classified into four categories: feeding, moving, resting and other activities. The average proportions of these activities were 14. 8 %, 25. 3 %, 56. 7 % and 3. 2 %, respectively. The relative proportions of the activities showed seasonal changes. Rises in atmospheric temperature were highly correlated with increases in the proportion of moving (r= 0. 908). Generally speaking, the proportion of feeding was high in the early evening and gradually fell as night progressed. The four activities were sub-divided into several component acts. In terms of component acts, hanging was positively correlated with a rise in temperature (r= 0. 889), while sitting was negatively correlated (r=- 0. 862), suggesting that the activity of the aye-aye is generally enhanced with rises in atmospheric temperature. The aye-aye engaged in tapping and gnawing throughout the period. These acts consisted of along duration of gnawing at definite places on the window or the steel frame of the door. Since the proportion of feeding activity was virtually undetermined under natural conditions because of intermittent observations and fragmented data, we assumed that it would be similar to that seen in the captive condition. On average, the aye-aye engaged in feeding for 89 minutes during a night, and consumed 48. 5 ramy fruits or ingested 212 kcal. The energy intake from this quantity of ramy fruits would be sufficient, considering the basal metabolic rate of prosimians. These analyses support a hard-nut adaptation hypothesis suggesting that ramy fruit is an important staple food of the aye-aye. During the period of study, the aye-aye was presented with 12 diet items such as coconuts, ramy nuts, bread, etc. The weight of food consumed during meals was measured over 16 nights to calculate the energy intake of the aye-aye, which was found on average 306. 1 kcal per meal. The response of the aye-aye to light was markedly different from other nocturnal prosimians. The aye-aye was not apparently disturbed when exposed to intense light...|$|R
40|$|Retroviruses infect a {{wide range}} of vertebrates. The {{understanding}} of the deep history and host distribution of retroviruses remains far from complete. Retroviruses can be integrated into their host genomes and occasionally become vertically inherited genomic loci. These integrated retroviruses, known as endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), provide "molecular fossils" for past retroviral infections and are useful for studying the deep history and ecology of retroviruses. ERVs are highly abundant in vertebrate genomes. However, endogenous foamy viruses and lentiviruses appear to be extremely rare. The primary focus of the research presented here is to discover and analyze novel endogenous foamy viruses and lentiviruses in animal genomes. Foamy virus has been thought to exclusively infect three placental mammal superorders (Laurasiatheria, Euarchontoglires, and Xenarthra). The discovery of endogenous foamy viral elements (CoeEFV) in the genome of the coelacanth (Latimeria chalumnae) extends the host range of foamy viruses to fish lineages (Appendix A). I demonstrate that foamy viruses have likely codiverged with their vertebrate hosts for more than 407 million years. The discovery of CoeEFV provides evidence for an ancient marine origin of retroviruses. Endogenous foamy virus-like elements (PSFVaye) were also identified within the genome of a Malagasy lemur, the aye-aye (<b>Daubentonia</b> <b>madagascariensis)</b> (Appendix B). Phylogenetic analysis shows that PSFVaye is divergent from all currently known simian foamy viruses, suggesting a potentially ancient association between foamy viruses and primate species. Another novel endogenous foamy virus (CaEFV) was identified in the genome of the Cape golden mole (Chrysochloris asiatica). The discovery of CaEFV reveals foamy virus infection in the placental mammal superorder Afrotheria and the long-term cospeciation between foamy viruses and placental mammals (Appendix C). Lentivirus has been thought to have a relatively recent origin. Endogenous lentivirus insertions (MELV) were discovered within the genomes of some species of the Weasel family (Mustelidae) (Appendix D). I verified the presence of MELV insertions in the genomes of several species of the Lutrinae and Mustelinae subfamilies but not the Martinae subfamily, which suggests that the lentiviral invasion likely occurred between 8. 8 and 11. 8 million years ago. Phylogenetic analysis suggests MELV might represent a novel lentiviral group. The discovery of MELV extends the host range of lentiviruses to the Caniformia. Endogenous lentiviruses (GvaELV) were also identified in the genome of the Sunda flying lemur (Galeopterus variegatus) (Appendix E). Phylogenetic analysis shows that GvaELV is a sister group of all known lentiviruses. The discovery of GvaELV might give a clue to the early evolution of lentiviral genome architecture. In summary, the discoveries and analyses of these novel ERVs provide important insights into the deep history and ecology of foamy viruses and lentiviruses as well as the retroviruses as a whole...|$|R
40|$|For primates, {{and other}} {{arboreal}} mammals, adopting suspensory locomotion {{represents one of}} the strategies an animal can use to prevent toppling off a thin support during arboreal movement and foraging. While numerous studies have reported the incidence of suspensory locomotion in a broad phylogenetic sample of mammals, little research has explored what mechanical transitions must occur in order for an animal to successfully adopt suspensory locomotion. Additionally, many primate species are capable of adopting a highly specialized form of suspensory locomotion referred to as arm-swinging, but few scenarios have been posited to explain how arm-swinging initially evolved. This study takes a comparative experimental approach to explore the mechanics of below branch quadrupedal locomotion in primates and other mammals to determine whether above and below branch quadrupedal locomotion represent neuromuscular mirrors of each other, and whether the patterns below branch quadrupedal locomotion are similar across taxa. Also, this study explores whether the nature of the flexible coupling between the forelimb and hindlimb observed in primates is a uniquely primate feature, and investigates the possibility that this mechanism could be responsible for the evolution of arm-swinging. To address these research goals, kinetic, kinematic, and spatiotemporal gait variables were collected from five species of primate (Cebus capucinus, <b>Daubentonia</b> <b>madagascariensis,</b> Lemur catta, Propithecus coquereli, and Varecia variegata) walking quadrupedally above and below branches. Data from these primate species were compared to data collected from three species of non-primate mammals (Choloepus didactylus, Pteropus vampyrus, and Desmodus rotundus) and to three species of arm-swinging primate (Hylobates moloch, Ateles fusciceps, and Pygathrix nemaeus) to determine how varying forms of suspensory locomotion relate to each other and across taxa. From the data collected in this study it is evident the specialized gait characteristics present during above branch quadrupedal locomotion in primates are not observed when walking below branches. Instead, gait mechanics closely replicate the characteristic walking patterns of non-primate mammals, with the exception that primates demonstrate an altered limb loading pattern during below branch quadrupedal locomotion, in which the forelimb becomes the primary propulsive and weight-bearing limb; a pattern similar to what is observed during arm-swinging. It is likely that below branch quadrupedal locomotion represents a “mechanical release” from the challenges of moving on top of thin arboreal supports. Additionally, it is possible, that arm-swinging could have evolved from an anatomically-generalized arboreal primate that began to forage and locomote below branches. During these suspensory bouts, weight would have been shifted away from the hindlimbs towards forelimbs, and as the frequency of these boats increased the reliance of the forelimb as the sole form of weight support would have also increased. This form of functional decoupling may have released the hindlimbs from their weight-bearing role during suspensory locomotion, and eventually arm-swinging would have replaced below branch quadrupedal locomotion as the primary mode of suspensory locomotion observed in some primate species. This study provides the first experimental evidence supporting the hypothetical link between below branch quadrupedal locomotion and arm-swinging in primates. Dissertatio...|$|R
