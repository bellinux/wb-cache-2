5|$|In {{the absence}} of an {{external}} field, the director of a liquid crystal is free to point in any direction. It is possible, however, to force the director to point in a specific direction by introducing an outside agent to the system. For example, when a thin polymer coating (usually a polyimide) is spread on a glass substrate and rubbed in a single direction with a cloth, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> liquid crystal molecules in contact with that surface align with the rubbing direction. The currently accepted mechanism for this is believed to be an epitaxial growth of the liquid crystal layers on the partially aligned polymer chains in the near surface layers of the polyimide.|$|E
25|$|There is also {{an attempt}} to bring nanofluidic {{technology}} into energy conversion. In this case, the electrical charged wall behaves as the stator, while the flowing solution as the rotor. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> when the pressure-driven solvent flowing through a charged nanochannel, it can generate a streaming current and a streaming potential. This phenomenon {{can be used in}} electrical energy harvesting.|$|E

Another disadvantage associated with the double haploidy is the cost involved in establishing tissue culture and growth facilities. The over-usage of doubled haploidy may reduce genetic variation in breeding germplasm. Hence one has to take several factors into consideration before deploying doubled haploidy in breeding programmes.|$|E

25|$|Studies done on both gymnotiforms and mormyrids {{have shown}} that there are species in both groups that have {{significant}} EOD changes from larvae to adult.

25|$|The sex-specific {{transcription}} of somatostatin gene {{coincides with}} the establishment of sex differences in SDN-POA. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> somatostatin mRNA appears in the SDN-POA of both males and females. On postnatal day 8 through postnatal day 35, the area of somatostatin mRNA-positive cells was significantly larger in males than in females, with males attain the maximum size of that area on day15 before decrease whereas females show no changes. Eventually the expression of somatostatin mRNA shows no difference between sexes. It is possible that somatostatin is related to the estrogen-dependent organization of SDN-POA.|$|E
25|$|The Internet {{can also}} be {{exploited}} for activities such as terrorism, internet fraud and pedophilia. In recent years, {{there has been an}} increase in crimes that involved the use of the Internet such as e-mails and Internet Relay Chat (IRC), as it is relatively easy to remain anonymous. These conspiracies carry concerns for security and protection. From a forensic linguistic point of view, there are many potential areas to explore. While developing a chat room child protection procedure based on search terms filtering is effective, there is still minimal linguistically orientated literature to facilitate the task. In other areas, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> the Semantic Web has been involved in tasks such as personal data protection, which helps to prevent fraud.|$|E
25|$|Various {{physical}} and physiological forces like light intensity, humidity, temperature, wind speeds etc. {{are thought to}} have influenced evolution of leaf shape and size. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> high trees rarely have large leaves, owing to the obstruction they generate for winds. This obstruction can eventually lead to the tearing of leaves, if they are large. Similarly, trees that grow in temperate or taiga regions have pointed leaves, presumably to prevent nucleation of ice onto the leaf surface and reduce water loss due to transpiration. Herbivory, not only by large mammals, but also small insects has been implicated as a driving force in leaf evolution, an example being plants of the genus Aciphylla, that are commonly found in New Zealand. The now-extinct moas (birds) fed upon these plants, and the spines on the leaves probably discouraged the moas from feeding on them. Other members of Aciphylla that did not co-exist with the moas were spineless.|$|E

500|$|Convict {{cichlids}} are a biparental species, so {{the parents}} will usually cooperate by carrying out tasks specific to their individual parental roles when raising their offspring.

[...] Both parents are {{able to carry out}} all of the parental care tasks to a certain extent.
