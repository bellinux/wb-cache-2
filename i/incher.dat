500|$|A 2009 {{advertising}} campaign in Singapore for the company's new BK Super Seven <b>Incher</b> cheeseburger, caused a notable {{controversy over the}} content of the ad. Originally and erroneously attributed to Burger King's advertising firm at the time, Crispin Porter + Bogusky, which had generated controversy with some misogynistic and culturally insensitive American and European advertisements, it was later revealed that a local, unnamed Singaporean firm was responsible for the campaign. The print version of the advertisement (pictured) made an overt association with the sandwich and oral sex using imagery and less-than subtle innuendo in the printed description in the advertisement. Critics across the globe complained that the ad was [...] "disgusting", and went [...] "too far".|$|E

The 9.2-inch <b>incher</b> was a quick-firing gun like the 6-incher, and its heavier shell made it a formidable weapon {{by the standards of the}} day when King Edward VII and her sisters were designed; it was adopted out of concerns that British battleships were undergunned for their displacement and were becoming outgunned by foreign battleships that had begun to mount [...] intermediate batteries. The four 9.2-inchers were mounted in single turrets abreast the foremast and mainmast, and King Edward VII thus could bring two of them to bear on either broadside. Even then, King Edward VII and her sisters were criticised for not having, a uniform secondary battery of 9.2-inch guns, something considered but rejected because of the length of time it would have taken to design the ships with such a radical revision of the secondary armament layout. In the end, it proved impossible to distinguish 12-inch and 9.2-inch shell splashes from one another, making fire control impractical for ships mounting both calibres, although King Edward VII had fire-control platforms on her fore- and mainmasts rather than the fighting tops of earlier classes.|$|E

50|$|Three ships {{underwent}} extensive rebuilds {{during the}} 1930s, becoming anti-aircraft (AA) cruisers, resulting in all previous armament being removed. The ships were Coventry, Curacoa and Curlew, with Curacoa being {{the last of}} the three to be rebuilt in 1939; the other two ships having been converted in 1935. Coventry and Curlew were given ten 4 in guns (two later being removed from Coventry) and sixteen 3 <b>inchers</b> for their AA role. Curacoa had a slightly different armament, being equipped with eight 4-inch guns and four 3 in guns, and later-on in the Second World War, four 20 mm Oerlikons. Cardiff and Ceres were to have undergone the same conversion, but this was prevented by the outbreak of war.|$|R

30|$|The Center for Higher Education Policy Studies CHEPS, <b>INCHER</b> and NIFU-STEPS (2008) have {{assessed}} {{these dimensions}} of autonomy through a questionnaire sent to and answered by national experts and through interviews with relevant stakeholders. They coded {{the extent to}} which autonomy has been achieved in organizational, policy and financial autonomy on an ordinal scale from 1 (low) to 5 (high) (for organizational autonomy) and 1 (low) to 3 (high) for policy and financial autonomy. The scores only reflect a comparative picture at the national level. They ignore possible differences on the regional, federal or institutional level within a country. They indicators also do not capture differences that may exist in levels of autonomy across degree courses, for example in the selectivity of undergraduate versus postgraduate degrees.|$|E

[URL] national survey data and a variety of secondary sources, this chapter explores key challenges facing the academic profession in Australia today and how academics have responded. Particular attention is given to how academics have responded to a more managerial university administration and culture, with a much stronger emphasis on entrepreneurial activities within departments and faculties and enhanced university-industry links. The chapter summarizes major Australian policy and contextual changes, explores how academics in general have reacted, and documents aspects of the impact of changes on academic qualifications, work roles and practices, job satisfaction and academic values.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} impact of the ERASMUS {{programme}} on quality improvement in European higher education in particular in the areas of teaching, research, student services and the openness to society with a focus at the institutional and system level. The study puts an emphasis on the identification of the contribution of ERASMUS to the development of high level strategies in these areas and to the various services higher education delivers. In addition, the study provides recommendations to make the current programme more effective and innovative in spreading internationalisation and quality in European higher education. The study concentrates on ERASMUS before the Lifelong Learning programme (2007 - 2013) as {{it is too early to}} evaluate {{the impact of}} the new ERASMUS LLL actions. The research consortium of CHEPS, <b>INCHER</b> and ECOTEC conducted a literature review, surveys among various institutional stakeholders of ERASMUS affiliated higher education institutions and 20 case studies to provide more in depth information on the various ways in which the ERASMUS programme has impacted on the operation of these institutions.
