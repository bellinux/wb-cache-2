The American heiress Margaret Lanier Cravens (1881–1912) became a patron; after knowing him a short time she offered a large annual sum {{to allow him to}} focus on his work. Cravens killed herself in 1912, after the pianist Walter Rummel, long the object of her affection, married someone <b>else.</b> <b>She</b> may also have been discouraged by Pound's engagement to Dorothy.|$|E

Claire and Julia are the rebels, the failures, the embarrassments that must be tolerated. When Julia arrives home, Claire greets her more honestly, more warmly than do Julia’s parents.|$|E
25|$|In 1844 {{their mother}} took {{the girls to}} Paris to {{continue}} their studies, first with Francesco Piermarini, {{and then with the}} distinguished tenor Marco Bordogni. Bordogni thought highly of Sophie: it is said that he allowed her to sing only scales and solfeggi which he composed for her, for two whole years. After that time mother Crüwell wanted to remove her, saying that she had learnt scales enough and that {{if she was going to}} do nothing <b>else</b> <b>she</b> might as well get married and give it up. Bordogni persuaded mother that she would have a wonderful career, and that she should go on to complete her studies in Milan. A first public appearance in January 1846 was reported in the musical journal Revue et Gazette Musicale de Paris.|$|E

25|$|By {{the time}} Carrington takes the Doctor {{to meet the}} astronauts a {{criminal}} named Reegan has organised their abduction, killing the soldiers and scientists guarding them. When the Doctor and Liz examine the site, they realise that human tissue could not have withstood the degree of radiation being emitted by the mysteriously irradiated astronauts. The Doctor believes the real astronauts are still in orbit, and that the three space suits contain alien beings. Reegan engineers the kidnapping of Liz Shaw to aid his own scientist, Lennox, a disgraced Cambridge professor, in keeping the alien astronauts alive. Reegan has even been supplied with a device {{to communicate with the}} aliens, and sends them to the Space Centre to kill Quinlan. It now becomes clear to UNIT that the aliens are emitting radiation like walking reactors, and that to touch them brings instant death. It is also evident, to Liz, that Reegan is taking orders from someone <b>else.</b> <b>She</b> helps Lennox escape, and he tries to reach the Brigadier, but his bid for freedom is cut short by Reegan’s merciless revenge.|$|E
25|$|Davydova {{also participated}} in the 1981 World Championships, her last major {{international}} event. The USSR won team gold. Davydova contributed more points towards the Soviet team score than anyone <b>else.</b> <b>She</b> {{finished third in the}} all-around final after an improper landing in the balance beam event. Had she not sat down on her beam dismount she would have won gold. Davydova suffered a serious neck injury in pre-competition warm up but still finished 3rd AA and was the only gymnast from any nation to make all 4 event finals. Davydova was the total points top scoring gymnast at the 1981 World Championships. She won silver on floor and bronze on bars. She would have won gold on vault but was unable to stand the incredibly difficult vault of her own invention, full twist on front tuck off. Jackie Fie, the US Head Judge on vault at the 81 World championships wrote that if the other vaults were to be marked out of 10 then Davydova's one should be scored out of 10.5. Davydova's vault was the pinnacle of the event. It was the most difficult vault of the competition – in either women's or men's gymnastics. Davydova {{is the only one who}} has done a vault that a male gymnast has not. Until Gabrielle Douglas 2015, she was the only IOC Olympic champion, since 1980, to have medalled in a World Championships after she had won the Olympic AA title.|$|E

When asked by an interviewer, [...] "What are her most distinctive personal graces?", Palmer replied, [...] "Above everything <b>else</b> <b>she</b> displayed a disposition of the most Christian forgiveness." [...] In covering her death and funeral, the mainstream newspapers in Hawaii that had supported the overthrow and annexation, recognized that she had been held in great esteem around the world.

500|$|Recording {{sessions}} for the film's songs and soundtrack began in September 1995, and {{took place at}} the CTS Studios in London with Madonna accompanied by co-actors Antonio Banderas and Jonathan Pryce. However, trouble arose as Madonna was not comfortable with laying down a [...] "guide vocal" [...] simultaneously with an 84 piece orchestra inside the studio. She was used to singing over a pre-recorded track and not have musicians listen to her. Also, unlike her previous soundtrack releases, she had little to no control over the project. An emergency meeting was held between Parker, Webber and Madonna where it was decided that the singer would record her part in a more contemporary studio while the orchestration would take place somewhere <b>else.</b> <b>She</b> also had alternate days off from the recording.|$|E
500|$|Folklorist Maria Tatar sees “Thumbelina” as {{a runaway}} bride story and notes {{that it has}} been viewed as an allegory about {{arranged}} marriages, and a fable about being true to one’s heart that upholds the traditional notion that the love of a prince is to be valued above all <b>else.</b> <b>She</b> points out that in Hindu belief, a thumb-sized being known as the innermost self or soul dwells in the heart of all beings, human or animal, and that the concept may have migrated to European folklore and taken form as Tom Thumb and Thumbelina, both of whom seek transfiguration and redemption. She detects parallels between Andersen’s tale and the Greek myth of Demeter and her daughter, Persephone, and, notwithstanding the pagan associations and allusions in the tale, notes that [...] "Thumbelina" [...] repeatedly refers to Christ‘s suffering and resurrection, and the Christian concept of salvation.|$|E
500|$|In December 1983, Jerôme Dahan and Laurent Boutonnat, two friends, {{composed}} {{a song called}} [...] "Maman a tort", about lesbian love between a girl committed to a mental hospital and her nurse. To find a performer, they held a casting. A girl aged 15–16 was initially chosen to perform the song, before being rejected because she {{was too young to}} sing its sexually ambiguous lyrics. Boutonnat then decided to ask one of his friends, Mylène Gautier, to sing the track. Both composers have said that they thought Gautier seemed psychotic and thus was the ideal person to record the track. Boutonnat said: [...] "As soon as I saw her, with her triangular face, I realized that this would be her and nobody <b>else.</b> <b>She</b> looked crazy, it was perfect." [...] After they decided to work with her, Gautier took the pseudonym of Farmer, as a tribute to actress Frances Farmer.|$|E

500|$|For most of {{the nineteenth}} and twentieth centuries, Mary Shelley {{was known as the}} author of Frankenstein and the wife of famous Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley. As late as 1961, Rambles had never been reprinted and, as scholar Elizabeth Nitchie explained, [...] "scant use has been made of it, and copies of it are rather scarce." [...] However, she argued that some of Mary Shelley's [...] "best writing" [...] was in Rambles. Novelist Muriel Spark agreed in her book on Shelley, writing that Rambles [...] "contains more humour and liveliness than occur in {{anything}} <b>else</b> <b>she</b> wrote". In the 1970s, with the rise of feminist literary criticism, scholars began to pay attention to Shelley's other works. With the publication of scholarship by Mary Poovey and Anne K. Mellor in the 1980s, Mary Shelley's [...] "other" [...] works—her short stories, essays, reviews, dramas, biographies, travel narratives, and other novels—began to be recognised as literary achievements. In the 1990s, Mary Shelley's entire corpus, including Rambles, was reprinted.|$|E

500|$|In {{the romantic}} comedy Love & Friendship, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in early 2016, Beckinsale reunited with her Last Days of Disco {{collaborators}} Stillman and Sevigny. The film revolved around her character, a wry and calculating woman named Lady Susan, as she pursues a wealthy and hapless man for marriage originally intended for her daughter, though she eventually marries him herself. The film was universally acclaimed by critics and found commercial success in arthouse cinemas. Justin Chang of Variety described the role as [...] "one {{of the most}} satisfying screen roles of her career Beckinsale magnetizes the screen {{in a way that}} naturally underscores how far ahead of everyone <b>else</b> <b>she</b> is: an effect that doesn’t always work to the movie’s advantage." [...] Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter remarked, [...] "There aren’t great depths to the role, but Beckinsale excels with the long speeches and in defining her character as a very self-aware egoist." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Forgive Me" [...] is an R, {{soul and}} dance-pop song written in A minor. It moves at 120 {{beats per minute}} and is set in common time. On it, Lewis {{performs}} her highest pitch (G5) in falsetto during the final chorus, and her lowest pitch (A3) during each verse. The song refers to a protagonist in a one-sided relationship who leaves her boyfriend and eventually finds someone to reciprocate her love. Though she has found love from someone <b>else,</b> <b>she</b> defends herself and asks her ex-boyfriend for forgiveness. In an interview with Digital Spy, Lewis explained why she decided in change the musical genre of her previous singles, from contemporary R to dance-pop. She said: [...] "I {{wanted to do something}} a bit different and the chance to work with Akon came about. I'm really pleased with how it's turned out and it's great that it's different, rather than what I always do."

500|$|The next track [...] "I Know It" [...] has a gentler {{swing to}} it and {{features}} music from piano, a saxophone, synth phrases while having an offbeat chord change. [...] "Holiday" [...] consists of a four-bar sequence, featuring instrumentation from guitars, electronic drums and handclaps from the Oberheim DMX, cowbell played by Madonna and a synthesized string arrangement. A side-by-side repetitive progression is achieved by making use of the chorus. Towards {{the end of the}} song, a change in the arrangement happens, where a piano break is heard. Lyrically, the song expresses the universal sentiment that everybody needs a holiday. In [...] "Think of Me", Madonna warns her erring lover that he should pay her attention or <b>else</b> <b>she</b> would leave. The song consists of beats from the Linn drum machine and a saxophone interlude. [...] "Physical Attraction" [...] is a medium paced track, with synth bass, a guitar line, sounds of a brass and Madonna singing in a shrill voice, about the attraction between herself and a boy. The last song on the album is [...] "Everybody", which starts with a heavily synthesized and spoken introduction, with Madonna taking a loud intake of breath. She displayed her bubblegum-pop like voice in the song, which was also doubletracked.|$|E
