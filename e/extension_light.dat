500|$|An {{application}} for a light railway order for the Hatfield Moor <b>Extension</b> <b>Light</b> Railway was made in November 1904, and was granted on 5 August 1905. The contract to build {{it was given to}} John Moffat of Manchester on 27 September 1907, and the contract price was £14,649. Construction took one and a half years, and the branch opened on 1 March 1909. Because the area through which it ran is low-lying, and had been the subject of drainage schemes since [...] 1626, the railway had several bridges over rivers and drains. Between Epworth and Sandtoft goods station, it crossed the Folly Drain, the New Idle River and the River Torne. Beyond the station it crossed the North Idle Drain, and then ran along the bank of the Hatfield Waste Drain to reach its terminus at Hatfield Moor, close to the Hatfield Peat Works, then owned by the British Moss Litter Company (BMLC).|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} light quality, {{as used in}} {{photoperiod}} extension, on vegetative growth and floral development of pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp. ] were studied using three photoperiod-insensitive lines, QPL 2, Prabhat, and Hunt, and one photoperiod-sensitive line, Royes. Plants were grown in controlled-environment cabinets under day/night temperature regimes of 24 / 16 °C (low) and 28 / 24 °C (high) for 72 days after emergence (DAE). The five light treatments consisted of 12 and 16 -h photoperiods and a 12 -h photoperiod extended to 16 h with low-intensity lighting from either incandescent (I), fluorescent (F), or incandescent plus fluorescent (I+F) lamps. Little genetic variation occurred in vegetative response (main stem length and node number, leaf area and shoot dry weight) to <b>extension</b> <b>light</b> source. Response varied with temperature, plant age and growth stage. Main stem node appearance and stem extension tended to decline following floral initiation (FI), whereas leaf area and shoot dry weight accumulation increased rapidly after 35 or 42 DAE, irrespective of whether plants were vegetative or floral. Plants were larger under the high-temperature regime. Temperature altered plant response to <b>extension</b> <b>light</b> source. I-extension promoted growth under both temperature regimes, whilst I+F promoted growth under high temperatures but was unexpectedly inhibitory under low. Under high temperatures F extension was inhibitory prior to FI, but promoted later growth during floral bud development (FBD). Under low temperatures, F-extension was not inhibitory during the pre-initiation phase. The four genotypes differed in their floral response to <b>extension</b> <b>light</b> source, the effect on initiation and development of floral primordia varying dependent upon temperature. Low temperatures resulted in sensitivity to <b>extension</b> <b>light</b> source, delaying FI and FBD. In Royes, failure to initiate under low temperatures was associated with small plant size (≤ 3. 5 g shoot dry weight). High temperatures tended to negate the delaying effects of <b>extension</b> <b>light</b> source, but resulted in photoperiod sensitivity, delaying FI in the early-flowering lines QPL- 2 and Prabhat. Under high temperatures, Royes was insensitive (FI and FBD) to extensions containing incandescent light (I, I+F). Under high temperatures, time of flowering was least affected by incandescent extensions (I, I+F), and most by F-extension, which delayed FBD in all lines. Under low temperatures, I+F extensions resulted in the greatest variation in flowering time. It was concluded that where heterogeneity exists in floral response to the intensity and/or quality of light, use of artificial lighting to select for photoperiod sensitivity may lead to misclassification...|$|E

40|$|The Talbot {{effect is}} a well studied {{phenomenon}} by which grating pseudoimages appear at certain periodic distances when monochromatic light is used. Recently, numerical simulations have shown a new phenomenon; when a polychromatic light beam is used in a double grating system, {{the intensity of the}} pseudoimages presents a transverse-profile that remains unaffected over a wide range of propagation distances. This effect can be used to increase the tolerances of gratings based optical devices, such as displacement measurement systems, interferometers, and spectrometers. The pseudoimages formation with a polychromatic and finite <b>extension</b> <b>light</b> source is analytically and experimentally demonstrated. Relatively simple analytical expressions for the intensity and the contrast allow us to predict when pseudoimages present a constant contrast and when they disappear. Furthermore, we experimentally obtain the pseudoimages using the proposed configuration, corroborating the theoretical predictions...|$|E
40|$|Benthic primary {{production}} and oxygen consumption are important components of lake biogeochemical cycling. We performed whole–lake nutrient manipulations in Arctic Alaska {{to assess the}} controls of lake morphometry, nutrients, and light on benthic community metabolism. One deep, stratified lake (Lake E 5) and one shallow, well–mixed lake (Lake E 6) in the Alaskan Arctic were fertilized {{with low levels of}} nitrogen (56 mg N m− 3 yr− 1) and phosphorus (8 mg P m− 3 yr− 1) from 2001 to 2013. Benthic {{primary production}} was not stimulated by fertilization in either lake. In the deep lake, decreased water clarity is consistent with an increase in phytoplankton biomass during fertilization. Benthic GPP decreased by 7 – 47 mg C m− 2 d− 1 (not statistically significant) and benthic respiration increased from 87 [*]±[*] 20 to 167 [*]±[*] 9 (SE) mg C m− 2 d− 1. The areal hypolimnetic oxygen deficit increased by 15 mg O 2 m− 2 d− 1 each year during the 13 yr of monitoring, apparently driven by lower (more negative) benthic NEP. In the shallow lake, phytoplankton concentration did not change with fertilization. As a result, the light environment did not change and benthic GPP did not decrease. Overall the data suggest that (1) benthic algae are not nutrient limited in either the deep or shallow lake, (2) lake morphometry modulated the overall nutrient impact on benthic metabolism by controlling the response of phytoplankton, and by <b>extension,</b> <b>light</b> and organic carbon supply to the benthos, (3) year–to–year variability in light attenuation explains considerable variability in benthic GPP between lakes and years, (4) correlations between both dissolved organic carbon concentrations and light attenuation coefficients (kd) between lakes suggests a regional control on light attenuation, and (5) the dissolved oxygen concentrations in the deep experimental lake are highly sensitive to nutrient enrichment...|$|E
40|$|Tree {{architecture}} {{is an important}} determinant of the height <b>extension,</b> <b>light</b> capture, and mechanical stability of trees, and it allows species to exploit the vertical height gradient in the forest canopy and horizontal light gradients at the forest floor. Tropical tree species partition these gradients through variation in adult stature (Hmax) and light demand. In this study we compare 22 architectural traits for 54 Bolivian moist-forest tree species. We evaluate how architectural traits related to Hmax vary with tree size, and we present a conceptual scheme in which we combine the two axes into four different functional groups. Interspecific correlations between architecture and Hmax varied strongly from negative to positive, depending on the reference sizes used. Stem height {{was positively related to}} Hmax at larger reference diameters (14 ¿ 80 cm). Species height vs. diameter curves often flattened toward their upper ends in association with reproductive maturity for species of all sizes. Thus, adult understory trees were typically shorter than similar-diameter juveniles of larger species. Crown area was negatively correlated with Hmax at small reference heights and positively correlated at larger reference heights (15 ¿ 34 m). Wide crowns allow the small understory species to intercept light over a large area at the expense of a reduced height growth. Crown length was negatively correlated with Hmax at intermediate reference heights (4 ¿ 14 m). A long crown enables small understory species to maximize light interception in a light-limited environment. Light-demanding species were characterized by orthotropic stems and branches, large leaves, and a monolayer leaf arrangement. They realized an efficient height growth through the formation of narrow and shallow crowns. Light demand {{turned out to be a}} much stronger predictor of tree architecture than Hmax, probably because of the relatively low, open, and semi-evergreen canopy at the research site. The existence of four functional groups (shade-tolerant, partial-shade-tolerant, and long- and short-lived pioneer) was confirmed by the principal component and discriminant analysis. Both light demand and Hmax capture the major variation in functional traits found among tropical rain forest tree species, and the two-way classification scheme provides a straightforward model to understand niche differentiation in tropical forests...|$|E
