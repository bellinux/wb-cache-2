5|$|Robert Kubica {{was quickly}} losing {{ground on the}} two Ferraris and Hamilton. Alonso passed Rosberg for seventh, and quickly closed in on Heidfeld, but stayed behind <b>him</b> <b>until</b> <b>he</b> pitted on Lap 16. Alonso {{attempted}} to get past on Lapfive, but ran wide, giving the position back to the German. Hamilton also pitted on Lap 16, with Massa pitting on Lap 19 and Räikkönen on Lap 21.|$|E
5|$|Longfellow {{moved to}} Cambridge {{to take a}} job at Harvard College as Smith Professor of Modern Languages and of Belles Lettres. A friend, Cornelius Conway Felton, {{recommended}} that Longfellow rent a room {{on the third floor of}} the home of a Professor Stearns on Kirkland Street; Longfellow stayed there for the 1836–1837 academic year. He disliked the place, however, and sought out better accommodations. Beginning in the summer of 1837, he rented rooms on the east side of the second floor of the home on Brattle Street, now owned by Elizabeth Craigie. At first, Mrs. Craigie thought he was a student at Harvard and refused to rent to <b>him</b> <b>until</b> <b>he</b> convinced her that he was a professor as well as the author of the book she was reading, Outre-Mer.|$|E

5|$|On December 17, Judge Sanderson finally {{ruled that}} prize {{fighting}} was illegal in San Francisco {{and the courts}} would not determine who the winner was. Sharkey retained the purse, but the decision provided no vindication for Earp. Until the fight, Earp had been a minor figure known regionally in California and Arizona. Afterward, his name was known {{from coast to coast}} in the worst possible way. Earp sold his interest in his horses on December 20 and left San Francisco shortly afterward. He only returned when he caught a boat to Alaska. Earp's decision left a smear on his public character that followed <b>him</b> <b>until</b> <b>he</b> died and afterward.|$|E
5|$|On {{returning}} from his unsuccessful mission to Japan, Nuyts {{took up his}} position as the third Governor of Formosa, with his residence in Fort Zeelandia in Tayouan (modern-day Anping). One of his early aims was to force an opening for the Dutch to trade in China — something which had eluded them since they arrived in East Asia in the early 17th century. To further this goal, he took the Chinese trade negotiator Zheng Zhilong hostage and refused to release <b>him</b> <b>until</b> <b>he</b> agreed to give the Dutch trading privileges. More than thirty years later {{it was to be}} Zheng's son Koxinga who ended the reign of the Dutch on Formosa.|$|E
5|$|Anderson visited Confederate sympathizers as he traveled, {{some of whom}} viewed him as a {{hero for}} {{fighting}} the Union, whom they deeply hated. Many of Anderson's men also despised the Union, and he was adept at tapping into this emotion. The Union soldier held captured at Centralia {{was impressed with the}} control that Anderson exercised over his men. Although many of them wished to execute this Union hostage, Anderson refused to allow it. On October 6, Anderson and his men traveled to meet General Price in Boonville, Missouri. Price was disgusted that Anderson used scalps to decorate his horse, and would not speak with <b>him</b> <b>until</b> <b>he</b> removed them. He was, however, impressed by the effectiveness of Anderson's attacks. Anderson presented him with a gift of fine Union pistols, likely captured at Centralia. Price instructed Anderson to travel to the Missouri railroad and disrupt rail traffic, making Anderson a de facto Confederate captain.|$|E

5|$|Charles {{writes a}} love song for Marge, who seems {{completely}} oblivious to <b>him</b> <b>until</b> <b>he</b> tells her {{that he is in}} love with her. She explains to him that she loves Homer, and that he should tell his wife how he feels about her. He agrees, and decides to take Marge back to Homer and then get rid of Verity. When the two arrive in Springfield, Homer and the children are ecstatic to see Marge. However, Verity has already decided to leave Charles, and has found a new partner: Marge's sister Patty. They were brought together by their hatred for Homer and begin to insult him. When an offended Homer threatens to vote in favor of a law that prohibits same-sex couples from adopting children, Patty forces Homer into confessing that he is too lazy to actually do it. At the end of the episode, Homer plays a guitar and expresses his undying love for his newly bought plasma television and (to a lesser extent) Marge.|$|E
5|$|Fortunately for the party, {{the reunification}} of worlds has opened the {{pathways}} to ancient sites where weapons and powers used to quell Enuo's rise a thousand years past lay in wait. So armed, the party enters the Rift, seeking out Exdeath {{at the center of}} the inter-dimensional nexus where they, too, fall prey to the Void. With help from their fallen allies, the party survives and is returned before Exdeath, now manifested as a demonic sylvan, battling <b>him</b> <b>until</b> <b>he</b> weakens and is swallowed by his own power. He then transforms into Neo Exdeath, intent on destroying the very essence of reality, himself with it. Exdeath is ultimately defeated, and, using the power of the Crystal shards, the heroes seal the Void once more and restore the reunified world and its Crystals. The game's ending varies based on how many party members are still alive at Neo Exdeath's defeat, detailing the events after the world's resurrection. At the end, the remaining group visits the Guardian Tree, and find that the fallen party members have returned to life.|$|E
5|$|On 19 and 20 October, Singaporean police {{questioned}} Took as part {{of their}} investigations; he said that three Chinese men kidnapped the girl. After questioning Took, police accompanied him home and to the police station again for a polygraph test. On the way, they stopped at a restaurant along Pasir Panjang Road for a meal. While eating, Took said he needed to go to the toilet, escaped, took a taxi to Woodlands and sneaked across the Causeway to Malaysia. Singaporean police searched for <b>him</b> <b>until</b> <b>he</b> turned himself in on 30 October, confessing that he had accidentally strangled Huang Na during a game of hide-and-seek in a storeroom. The following day, Huang Na's body was found at Telok Blangah Hill Park, and Took was charged with her murder. Direct Singapore Funeral Services oversaw her funeral for free. Thousands attended Huang Na's wake and funeral; some gave bai jin and gifts, such as sweets, flowers and her favourite Hello Kitty merchandise. However, some Singaporeans tried to make money from the girl's death by buying 4D numbers associated with her. Others spread rumours that Shuying was having affairs and was greedy for donations.|$|E

5|$|Pelat {{had been}} a friend of François Mitterrand, then President of France, and at the centre of a scandal {{involving}} French Prime Minister Pierre Bérégovoy. As an investigative judge, Jean-Pierre could not dismiss any information brought to his attention pertaining to the case, especially if it might {{have led to a}} scandal similar to the one implicating an illegal Masonic lodge named Propaganda Due in the 1982 Banco Ambrosiano bank failure in Italy, Jean-Pierre ordered a search of Plantard's home. The search turned up a hoard of false documents, including some proclaiming Plantard the true king of France. Plantard admitted under oath that he had fabricated everything, including Pelat's involvement with the Priory of Sion. Plantard was threatened with legal action by the Pelat family and therefore disappeared to his house in southern France. He was 74 years old at the time. Nothing more was heard of <b>him</b> <b>until</b> <b>he</b> died in Paris on 3 February 2000.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} Walter Skinner {{was played}} by actor Mitch Pileggi, who had unsuccessfully auditioned for {{the roles of}} two or three other characters on The X-Files before getting the part. At first, {{the fact that he was}} asked back to audition for the recurring role slightly puzzled <b>him,</b> <b>until</b> <b>he</b> discovered the reason he had not previously been cast in those roles—Carter had been unable to envision Pileggi as any of those characters, because the actor had been shaving his head. When Pileggi auditioned for Walter Skinner, he had been in a grumpy mood and had allowed his small amount of hair to grow. His attitude fit well with Skinner's character, causing Carter to assume that the actor was only pretending to be grumpy. Pileggi later realized he had been lucky that he had not been cast in one of the earlier roles, as he believed he would have appeared in only a single episode and would have missed the opportunity to play the recurring role.|$|E

5|$|Assisted in her {{investigations}} by , Arisa's classmate who learns Tsubasa's identity, she encounters , Arisa's {{best friend}} whom the King manipulates; , Arisa's boyfriend; , a transfer student whom Arisa had befriended online and {{who serves as}} the messenger of the King; and , Manabe's childhood friend who lost the use of her legs after a failed suicide attempt provoked by the King. Arisa awakens from her coma, but pretends to have amnesia and returns to Midori's side. She reveals {{that she was the}} original King: although she granted harmless wishes in the beginning, she eventually stole the answers to an exam for Mariko's wish, fearing disappointment if she refused. Midori caught her in the act, and she shared the task of granting the class's wishes with <b>him,</b> <b>until</b> <b>he</b> injured her mother, in an attempt to grant her wish. Midori then replaced her as King, using violence and bullying to grant wishes. Horrified by his cruelty and the perceived similarities between them, she then reached out to her twin, hoping that Tsubasa would be able to uncover the truth. Tsubasa learns that Midori suffered psychological trauma in his childhood after being abandoned by his mother and witnessing his twin, Akari, die of neglect. She later foils his attempt to kill her mother, as he hated his own mother and believed that Arisa hated hers as well. Arisa confesses that she loves him for noticing her loneliness, and he realizes that he loves her too. In the conclusion, Arisa's mother spends more time with her, and Arisa reconciles with Tsubasa.|$|E

5|$|On July 23, 1864, Anderson led 65 men to Renick, Missouri, robbing {{stores and}} tearing down {{telegraph}} wires on the way. They {{had hoped to}} attack a train, but its conductor learned of their presence and turned back before reaching the town. The guerrillas then attacked Allen, Missouri. At least 40 members of the 17th Illinois Cavalry and the Missouri State Militia were in town but took shelter in a fort. The guerrillas were only able to shoot their horses before reinforcements arrived, killing three of Anderson's men. In late July, the Union military sent a force of 100 well-equipped soldiers, and 650 other men, after Anderson. On July 30, Anderson and his men kidnapped the elderly father of the local Union militia's commanding officer. They tortured <b>him</b> <b>until</b> <b>he</b> was near death and sent word to the man's son in an unsuccessful attempt to lure him into an ambush, before releasing the father with instructions to spread word of his mistreatment. On August 1, while searching for militia members, Anderson {{and some of his}} men stopped at a house full of women and requested food. While they rested at the house, a group of local men attacked. The guerrillas quickly forced the attackers to flee, and Anderson shot and injured one woman as she fled the house. This action angered his men, who saw themselves as the protectors of women, but Anderson dismissed their concerns, stating that such things were inevitable. They chased the men who had attacked them, killing one and mutilating his body. By August 1864, they were regularly scalping the men that they killed.|$|E
