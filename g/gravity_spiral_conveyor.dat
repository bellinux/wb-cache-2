40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} a proposal construction of the <b>spiral</b> <b>conveyor</b> serving to the transport wheat from the container to the grinding equipment. The introduction describes the theoretical part of the screw <b>conveyors,</b> <b>spiral</b> <b>conveyors</b> and transported materials. This is followed by construction solution and calculation {{of the most important}} parts of the conveyor...|$|R
50|$|The {{advantage}} of a <b>spiral</b> <b>conveyor</b> {{is that it can}} be used with a minimum amount of control software. The disadvantages are that a relatively large area (floor space) is required compared with other product lifts and vertical transport takes {{a great deal of time}} on account of the number of cycles which the transport belt completes. Certain products can also become misshapen since they are transported at an angle. One only has to think of plastic bottles which are wrapped in clingfilm which can become permanently misshapen if the clingfilm has still not completely cooled. A product is only supported at two angles on a <b>spiral</b> <b>conveyor,</b> because of the lifting angle and the radius within which the transport conveyor is placed. If a product has to be supported so that it is flat during transport, this will not be possible with a <b>spiral</b> <b>conveyor.</b> The drive motor of a <b>spiral</b> <b>conveyor</b> must always be controlled with a frequency regulator in order to prevent excessive slippage of the transport belt. It is also necessary to take account that products must not touch at intake. If products are touching each other at intake, the products can become jammed, which can result in the transport belt breaking down. It is, therefore, recommended that a good feed mechanism be provided for a <b>spiral</b> <b>conveyor.</b> In the case of most <b>spiral</b> <b>conveyors,</b> products must also be presented centrally, as the eccentric loading of <b>spiral</b> <b>conveyors</b> can cause excessive slippage. If a product becomes stuck for any reason, there is a good to a very good chance that the lamellae of the transport belt will disintegrate, which can cause a considerable loss in production along the whole of the production line, something which is associated with huge additional costs for replacements.|$|R

50|$|Just like <b>spiral</b> <b>conveyors</b> also a {{vertical}} conveyor that use forks {{are able to}} transport material loads in a continuous flow. With these forks the load can be taken from one horizontal conveyor and put down on another horizontal conveyor on a different level. By adding more forks more products can be lifted at the same time. Conventional vertical conveyors have the restriction that the input and output of material loads must have the same direction. By using forks many combinations of different input- and output levels in different directions are possible. A vertical conveyor with forks can even be used as {{a vertical}} sorter. Compared to a <b>spiral</b> <b>conveyor</b> a vertical conveyor - with or without forks - takes up less space.|$|R
50|$|A {{continuous}} product lift or reciprocating elevator can {{be chosen}} for the upright transporting of products. Such lifts are found in two forms: an L-shaped conveyor or mat lift and a fork-lift. An L-shaped conveyor or platform lift is a goods lift in which the products lie on a support which is suspended between a number of chains. This {{means that there is}} a considerable risk of contamination (with oil or grease) where use is made of traditional chains. A possible disadvantage of such a lift is that it requires more control, but the area required is again appreciably less than with a <b>spiral</b> <b>conveyor.</b> The difference in height which is able to be bridged with only one drive motor is almost unlimited. When bridging a greater height, it is necessary with <b>spiral</b> <b>conveyors</b> to place several systems one above the other. Another disadvantage of an L-shaped conveyor or a platform lift {{is the fact that it}} is difficult to control the transfer of products on intake to the system, with the incorrect receiving of a product being able to cause considerable consequential damage and with considerable additional costs to be expected as a result of lost production just as in the case of a <b>spiral</b> <b>conveyor.</b>|$|R

50|$|A {{discontinuous}} conveyor {{also called}} a reciprocating elevator, lifts the product on to a platform using a platform, roller conveyor or belt conveyor and then moves the platform with {{the product to}} another level. Because of the cycle time required for input and output as well as lifting/lowering movements, such a conveyor can only be used for smaller capacities. Continuous conveyors {{are more suitable for}} bigger capacities. There are two important solutions which can be used for this group. It is possible to choose a <b>spiral</b> <b>conveyor</b> or a continuous product lift. Both solutions are able to handle several products at a time.|$|R
50|$|All the {{aggregates}} like lime, sand, soil, coal ash, {{and other}} stuff are {{loaded into the}} batching hoppers by the loading machine. After measuring, the belt feeder transports the aggregates into mixing device. Meanwhile, stabilizing powders like lime, cement and others are transferred from powder material warehouse to the batch hopper by <b>spiral</b> <b>conveyor,</b> and then moved to the belt feeder by powder material feeder. All the ingredients {{are going to the}} mixing device for final processing. At last, the feeding belt conveyor is waiting for the final product to deliver it to the storage warehouse.|$|R
50|$|In {{internal}} logistics, {{there are}} various ways for getting product flows up or down. A solution which is often used is the deployment of incline or lowering belts. When placed at an angle in order to bridge a height difference, such belt conveyors also {{have the advantage of}} covering a certain distance. A disadvantage is the loss of much useful floor space {{as a result of the}} presence of the necessary supports for the belt conveyor. A bigger distance over a smaller floor area can be bridged using a product lift or a vertical conveyor. A continuous conveyor or a discontinuous conveyor can be chosen as a vertical conveyor. Continuous conveyors can take the form of a <b>spiral</b> <b>conveyor,</b> an L-shaped conveyor or platform lift or a product lift fitted with a fork.|$|R
40|$|A {{theoretical}} and experimental {{investigation of the}} separation achieved in a column crystallizer which utilizes a <b>spiral</b> <b>conveyor</b> was conducted {{to determine the effect}} of variables associated with continuous flow operation. A system that exhibits negligible solid solubility was used. Several feed mixtures containing less than 31, 000 p. p. m. weight cyclohexane in benzene were employed. The principal variables evaluated in this study in a column of constant length were the feed position, internal crystal rate, and flow rates of terminal streams. A mathematical model is developed which considers axial dispersion and mass transfer between the liquid adhering to the crystals and the bulk liquid. The model satisfactorily explains the effect of the variables associated with continuous flow operation and shows that axial dispersion is more dominant in continuous flow than in total reflux operation. It is shown that multiple pass or cascade operation is necessary to produce material of purity higher than a critical level which is related to the feed composition. This occurs because of impurities in the crystal phase which are likely caused by volumetric inclusions...|$|R

40|$|Introduction <b>Spiral</b> <b>conveyors</b> {{effectively}} carry solid masses as free or partly {{free flow}} of materials. They create good throughput {{and they are the}} perfect solution to solve the problems of transport, due to their simple structure, high efficiency and low maintenance costs. This study aims to investigate the performance characteristics of conveyors as function of auger diameter, rotational speed and handling inclination angle. The performance characteristic was investigated according to volumetric efficiency. In another words, {{the purpose of this study}} was obtaining a suitable model for volumetric efficiency changes of steep auger to transfer agricultural products. Three different diameters of auger, five levels of rotational speed and three slope angles were used to investigate the effects of changes in these parameters on volumetric efficiency of auger. The used method is novel in this area and the results show that performance by ANFIS models is much better than common statistical models.

50|$|When the City & South London Railway {{opened in}} 1890 {{access to the}} {{platforms}} was by two hydraulic lifts, each capable of carrying 50 passengers. The later extensions had electric lifts and five were provided at Bank. Access to the Waterloo & City Railway in 1898 was by slopes and steps, and the Great Northern & City Railway (GN&CR) used both hydraulic and electric lifts. The Central London Railway provided electric lifts {{when it opened in}} 1900, and the opening of Bond Street station was delayed as the lifts were not ready. The UERL controversially imported 140 electric lifts from Otis Elevator Company in the U.S. for its three lines. Each carrying about 70 passengers, they were provided at every station except Gillespie Road (now Arsenal) and Embankment, where access was provided via the District's station. Hydraulic lifts were provided at Finsbury Park, powered from the GN&CR pumping station. and at Holloway Road there was an experimental <b>spiral</b> <b>conveyor,</b> but this was never used by the public. Each lift was manned, and at some quiet stations in the 1920s the ticket office was moved into the lift, or it was arranged that the lift could be controlled from the ticket office.|$|R
50|$|A Fork lift can be {{arranged}} {{in more ways than}} an L-shaped conveyor or a platform lift and a <b>spiral</b> <b>conveyor.</b> A fork-lift is a product lift which lifts products from a conveyor using a fork and then places them at a different level on another conveyor. Such a fork-lift makes it possible to introduce or remove products at an angle of 90 degrees. As a result, the number of possible input and output combinations is somewhat larger. Because of the possibility of sliding conveyors in or out of the lift, a fork-lift can also be used as a vertical sorting system. With such a sorting installation, a product can be entered and removed at any level and a product can be lifted and lowered using one lift. The power and thus the energy consumption of the drive is considerably lower with a fork-lift than with other systems, since only the product weight needs to be transported and the forks maintain a balance between each other in the rising and lowering section. Another difference between a fork-lift and an L-shaped conveyor or platform lift is the complexity of the control. With an L-shaped conveyor or platform lift, input and output must be completely synchronous, whereas this is not necessary with a fork-lift. This ensures considerably simpler controls.|$|R
50|$|When two galaxies pass by {{each other}} in close proximity, their shapes distort due to each other's <b>gravity.</b> The outside <b>spiral</b> arms splay out into space, often casting stars and dust into the abyss as their host galaxies drift slowly back towards {{each other in}} orbit. These spiral distortions are called tidal arms, or more commonly, tidal tails.|$|R
50|$|Articulated rotor {{systems with}} drag hinges allow each {{individual}} blade to advance or lag in its rotation {{to compensate for}} stress on the blade caused by the acceleration and deceleration of the rotor hub (due to momentum conservation). When the spacing of the blades becomes irregular, it shifts the rotor's center of gravity from the axis of rotation, which causes an oscillation. When the airframe begins to rock {{back and forth from}} the oscillation, the oscillations can reinforce each other and cause the rotor's center of <b>gravity</b> to <b>spiral</b> away from the axis of rotation to a point beyond the compensating ability of the damping system.|$|R
40|$|Physical {{mechanisms}} that can influence rotation curves of spiral galaxies are discussed. For dark matter studies, possible contributions due to magnetic fields and non-Newtonian gravitational accelerations should be carefully acconted for. We {{point out that}} magnetic fields are particularly important in outermost parts of the disk. In the framework of general relativity the physical reason of an enhanced <b>gravity</b> in <b>spiral</b> galaxies depends on the assumed metric. The additional gravity is provided for Schwarzschild metric by nonluminous mass, whereas for Vaidya metric [1] by emission of radiative energy. In the latter case the non-Newtonian acceleration displays 1 /r behaviour. Also matter flows contribute to non-Newtonian gravity. PACS numbers: 98. 52. Nr., 98. 62. Dm. 1...|$|R
40|$|Optimum {{enriching}} {{possibilities of}} chromite ores from the abandoned Topraktepe mine were investigated. To obtain the best enriching method(s), shaking table, multi <b>gravity</b> separator, humprey <b>spiral</b> and jigging tests were tested. The best grades for Cr 2 O 3 are 55. 65 % by shaking table, 57. 52 % by multigravity separator, 54. 58 % by humprey spiral test and 50. 68 % by jigging.

40|$|Detailed {{characterization}} {{and recovery}} of apatite from a sedimentary phosphate ore slime of a gravity plant of Yichang, China, were investigated. The phosphate ore slime consisted mainly of apatite, quartz, dolomite, and clay.

Other different characterizations, such as apatite grain size distribution, apatite liberation, particle density distribution, and theoretical grade recovery, were also analyzed by mineral liberation analyser (MLA). Based on the results, a new gravity-flotation process, which was comprised of <b>spiral</b> <b>gravity</b> and reverse flotation, was proposed to process the slime. In the new process, the apatite was firstly recovered by two-stage <b>spiral</b> <b>gravity,</b> avoiding direct flotation. The gravity concentrate was the feed for the reverse flotation.

50|$|Prior to sowing, {{the seeds}} {{are subject to}} Rhizobium culture. Seeds are planted preferably in flat beds in rows 30 cm apart and spaced at 10cm, and in depths of less than 5 cm. Farm yard manure or compost is used to enhance the {{fertility}} of the fields before sowing, say at 15 to 20 tons per ha. While sowing, chemicals added are 50 kg N/ha and 40 kg P205/ha, depending on the inherent fertility values of the soil which can be ascertained by testing the soil. Irrigation water is provided immediately after sowing and then after 30, 70-75, 85-90, and 105-110 days; good drainage is facilitated to prevent any water-logging. Other cultivation methods of hoeing and weeding are done as required. Harvesting is done when the lower leaves of the plant start shedding and the pods turn colour. Timely manual harvesting is done by way of cutting using sickles. The harvested plants are tied in bundles and dried for 5-7 days. Threshing, by hand or using mechanical methods, is done to separate the seeds from the plants. A vacuum <b>gravity</b> separator or <b>spiral</b> <b>gravity</b> separator is used to clean the seeds which are then graded.

40|$|<b>Spiral</b> <b>gravity</b> {{separators}} are devices used in {{mineral processing}} to separate particles {{based on their}} specific gravity or size. The spiral geometry allows for the simultaneous application of gravitational and centripetal forces on the particles, which leads to segregation of particles. However, this segregation mechanism is not fundamentally understood, and the spiral separator literature does not tell a cohesive story either experimentally or theoretically. While experimental results {{vary depending on the}} specific spiral separator used, present theoretical works neglect the significant coupling between the particle dynamics and the flow field. Using work on gravity-driven monodisperse slurries on an incline that empirically accounts for this coupling, we consider a monodisperse particle slurry of small depth flowing down a rectangular channel that is helically wound around a vertical axis. We use a thin-film approximation to derive an equilibrium profile for the particle concentration and fluid depth and find that, in the steady state limit, the particles concentrate towards the vertical axis of the helix, leaving a region of clear fluid. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was to}} verify the effect of the seed-processing stages on the physical and physiological qualities and on the incidence of S. sclerotiorum in soybean seeds. In this study, seeds from eight cultivars coming from production fields naturally infested in the counties of the State of Goiás, Brazil, from two harvests (2009 / 2010 and 2010 / 2011), were used.

The following parameters were evaluated: seed- moisture content, physical purity, germination and tetrazolium. Additional tests and the detection of S. sclerotiorum in paper roll and the neon method were performed. The processing of soybean seeds improves the physical and physiological quality of the seed lots, in addition to eliminating sclerotia.

It addresses science questions such as: What is the equation of state of ultra dense matter? What are the effects of strong <b>gravity</b> on matter <b>spiraling</b> into black holes? It would be optimized for sub-millisecond timing to study phenomena at the natural timescales of neutron star surfaces and black hole event horizons and to measure mass and spin of black holes. These measurements are synergistic to imaging and high-resolution spectroscopy instruments, addressing much smaller distance scales than are possible without very long baseline X-ray interferometry, and using complementary techniques to address the geometry and dynamics of emission regions. A sky monitor (2 - 50 keV) acts as a trigger for pointed observations, providing high duty cycle, high time resolution monitoring of the X-ray sky with ~ 20 times the sensitivity of the RXTE All-Sky Monitor, enabling multi-wavelength and multi-messenger studies. A probe-class mission concept would employ lightweight collimator technology and large-area solid-state detectors, technologies which have been recently greatly advanced during the ESA M 3 study. Given the large community interested in LOFT (> 800 supporters, the scientific productivity of this mission is expected to be very high, similar to or greater than RXTE (~ 2000 refereed publications).

40|$|We report ALMA {{observations}} of CO(3 - 2) emission in the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 1566, at a spatial resolution of 25 pc. Our {{aim is to}} investigate the morphology and dynamics of the gas inside the central kpc, and to probe nuclear fueling and feedback phenomena. NGC 1566 has a nuclear bar of 1. 7 kpc radius and a conspicuous grand design spiral starting from this radius. The ALMA field of view, of diameter 0. 9 kpc, lies well inside the nuclear bar and reveals a molecular trailing spiral structure from 50 to 300 pc in size, which is contributing to fuel the nucleus, according to its negative <b>gravity</b> torques. The <b>spiral</b> starts with a large pitch angle from the center and then winds up in a pseudo-ring at the inner Lindblad resonance (ILR) of the nuclear bar. This {{is the first time}} that a trailing spiral structure is clearly seen driving the gas inwards inside the ILR ring of the nuclear bar. This phenomenon shows that the massive central black hole has a significant dynamical influence on the gas, triggering its fueling. The gaseous spiral is well correlated with the dusty spiral seen through extinction in HST images, and also with a spiral feature emitting 0. 87 mm continuum. This continuum emission must come essentially from cold dust heated by the interstellar radiation field. The HCN(4 - 3) and HCO+(4 - 3) lines were simultaneously mapped and detected in the nuclear spiral. The HCO+(4 - 3) line is 3 times stronger than the HCN(4 - 3), as expected when star formation excitation dominates over active galactic nucleus (AGN) heating. The CO(3 - 2) /HCO+(4 - 3) integrated intensity ratio is ∼ 100. The molecular gas is in remarkably regular rotation, with only slight non-circular motions at the periphery of the nuclear spiral arms.

40|$|Mamelodi Quarries, which {{currently}} mine the Franspoort nepheline syenite, produces aggregate and crusher sand {{for the local}} building industry. The mine is located northeast of Pretoria, South Africa {{on the road to}} Cullinan. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the use of the Franspoort nepheline syenite as an alumina and alkali resource for the glass and ceramics industry at Mamelodi Quarries, and to evaluate the production of a concentrate of zircon and rare earth elements as economic by-products. International standards require a nepheline product with a ferric oxide content of less than 0. 35 weight percent. The Franspoort nepheline syenite contains 3. 37 weight percent of ferric oxide. The iron-containing minerals present are aegirine, aegirine-augite, magnetite, ilmenite and pyrite. The removal of iron-bearing minerals was attempted by high-intensity wet magnetic separation, low-intensity dry magnetic separation, <b>spiral</b> <b>gravity</b> separation, and heavy liquid separation to produce a saleable nepheline product. This product is the cleaned final concentrate, of the different separation tests, which contains the lowest iron concentration for application in the glass and ceramic industry. The mineral assemblage was determined with a petrographic study as well as X-ray diffraction and electron microprobe analyses. Material from the different separation tests was analysed with X-ray fluorescence to obtain the chemical composition and to evaluate the final iron content of the nepheline product. The dry magnetic separation method produced the best results. The nepheline product has a ferric oxide content of 0. 68 weight percent compared to the starting concentration of 3. 37 weight percent. The ferric oxide concentration is, however, above the accepted levels for the glass and ceramics industry. The ferric oxide content is attributed to small iron-rich mineral inclusions, which are locked in feldspar and nepheline. The final nepheline product is not suitable for the use in the glass and ceramic industry. Zircon was concentrated the best by the use of heavy liquid separation. Zircon is in most cases locked in the minerals albite, microcline, and nepheline. The rare earth elements are mostly associated with zircon and fluorite and therefore it will not be viable to produce it as a by-product.
