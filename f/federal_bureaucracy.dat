5|$|After {{four years}} in Charlottesville, Scalia entered public service in 1971. President Richard Nixon {{appointed}} him {{general counsel for the}} Office of Telecommunications Policy, where one of his principal assignments was to formulate federal policy for the growth of cable television. From 1972 to 1974, he was chairman of the Administrative Conference of the United States, a small independent agency that sought to improve the functioning of the <b>federal</b> <b>bureaucracy.</b> In mid-1974, Nixon nominated him as Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel. After Nixon's resignation, the nomination was continued by President Gerald Ford, and Scalia was confirmed by the Senate on August 22, 1974.|$|E
5|$|Roosevelt won the 1940 presidential election. After Minton {{left office}} in January 1941, {{he was given}} a {{position}} in the Roosevelt administration as a reward for his loyalty during the court packing failure. He served as one of the president's advisers and a liaison between the White House and Congress. The extent of his duties is not fully known; Linda Gugin has speculated that he may have managed Roosevelt's patronage system. Minton was responsible for getting several officials appointed to high offices in the <b>federal</b> <b>bureaucracy</b> and numerous others appointed to lower ranking positions. He also convinced Roosevelt to support the creation of a Senate defense committee chaired by Truman, a position that brought Truman into the national spotlight and helped him gain the vice presidency.|$|E
5|$|During the campaign, Bevin {{criticized the}} Affordable Care Act {{and called for}} {{repealing}} it in its entirety. His proposed alternatives included allowing insurance providers to compete across state lines, capping damages awarded for pain and suffering, allowing individuals to purchase health insurance with pre-tax earnings, and providing federal block grants to states {{to allow them to}} cover individuals with pre-existing conditions. He opposed tax increases and the allocation of federal earmarks. He called for massive spending cuts in the <b>federal</b> <b>bureaucracy,</b> specifically the Department of Education and the Veterans Administration, and for reforming eligibility requirements for entitlement programs, including raising age requirements, imposing means tests, and ending federal benefits to illegal immigrants. He opposed U.S. intervention in the Syrian Civil War and the disbursement of foreign aid to countries that deny basic freedoms to their citizens or are guilty of human rights violations. He opposed federal agribusiness subsidies and warantless federal surveillance and called for simplifying the child adoption process. Endorsed by Gun Owners of America, he pledged to resist any restrictions on the types of guns or ammunition that citizens could purchase. A supporter of congressional term limits, Bevin signed a pledge authored by the non-profit U.S. Term Limits stating that, if elected, he would co-sponsor and vote for a bill restricting individuals to three terms in the U.S. House of Representatives and two terms in the U.S. Senate.|$|E

In 2012, CCA spent nearly $1.8 million lobbying Congress and <b>federal</b> <b>bureaucracies</b> on {{issues relating to}} homeland security, law enforcement, immigrant detention, and information disclosure legislation.|$|R
50|$|Turkey Tayac {{started using}} a new name as he {{organized}} a movement for Native American peoples that privileged self-ascriptive forms of identification. In one of their projects in the 1960s, the Piscataway issued identification cards to Native Americans, rather than have tribes apply to and rely on state and <b>federal</b> <b>bureaucracies</b> to issue them on their behalf.|$|R
25|$|The book grounds {{the reader}} in {{background}} material about worldwide extremism ideologies and {{the operations of}} al-Qaeda across the world. Nance explains that al-Qaeda examines their targets from a perspective of distance, breaking them into groups of those close and distant. The author notes close targets of al-Qaeda include <b>federal</b> <b>bureaucracies</b> in India, Bangladesh, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia. Distant targets include Israel, Europe (and the United Kingdom), Australia, and the United States.|$|R
25|$|To {{manage the}} growing <b>federal</b> <b>bureaucracy,</b> Presidents have {{gradually}} surrounded themselves with {{many layers of}} staff, who were eventually organized into the Executive Office of the President of the United States.

25|$|Why We Want You to Be Rich {{notes in}} the {{introduction}} it is not intended as a technical manual with specific recommendations. The book warns the reader that the American middle class strata is shrinking due to multiple factors including oncoming retirement of the baby boomers, rising costs of light crude oil, decreasing employer pay to employees, increasing national debt of the United States, and a declining power of the United States dollar. The authors caution that individuals should not rely on the <b>federal</b> <b>bureaucracy</b> for support from problems including the middle-class squeeze, economic globalization, and threats of terrorism. They assert that employment opportunities are not formed from the government but rather through entrepreneurship.|$|E
25|$|Hoover {{became a}} {{conservative}} spokesman {{in opposition to}} the domestic and foreign policies of the New Deal. He opposed entry into the Second World War and was not called on to serve in any public role during the war. He had better relations with President Harry S. Truman, and Hoover helped produce a number of reports that changed U.S. occupation policy in Germany. Truman also appointed Hoover to head the Hoover Commission, intended to foster greater efficiency throughout the <b>federal</b> <b>bureaucracy,</b> and Hoover served on a similar commission under President Dwight D. Eisenhower. By {{the time of his death}} in 1964, he had rehabilitated his image. Nevertheless, Hoover is generally not ranked highly in historical rankings of Presidents of the United States.|$|E
50|$|Media reform {{refers to}} {{proposed}} attempts to reform mass media towards an agenda {{which is more}} in tune with public needs and away from a perceived bias toward corporate (or, in many cases, government or political) biases. Media reform advocates also place a strong emphasis upon enabling those who are marginalized or semi-marginalized by their individual incomes, immutable characteristics or desperate conditions to possess access to means of publication and dissemination of information. They do not come from a concern with policy, or with a desire to democratize <b>federal</b> <b>bureaucracies</b> and regulations.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{allegations}} of misconduct involving a California assisted reproduction clinic transferring embryos from uncon-senting donors into recipients oblivious of the source, {{resulting in the}} birth of several babies, have initiated a growing national concern that there is insufficient ethical supervision in reproductive medicine. The nation was appalled, practi-tioners felt betrayed and patients expressed concern. A basic trust was violated. That this could happen became an unsettling worry leading several organizations and vocal individuals to call for more regulation at the state or federal level similar to the British Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA). While ethical guidance is imperative for assisted reproduct-ive technology, it is my belief that cumbersome state and <b>federal</b> <b>bureaucracies</b> are an inappropriate means to accomplis...|$|R
25|$|Former President Herbert Hoover was {{chairman}} of the 12-member bipartisan Congressional Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch, which was established prior to the passage of the National Security Act of 1947. As part of the Commission, the Task Force on National Security Organization (led by Ferdinand Eberstadt) examined the effectiveness of the intelligence agencies and reviewed <b>federal</b> <b>bureaucracy.</b> After a series of hearings, the Hoover Commission submitted a 121-page report written by Eberstadt's task force on January 13, 1949. The Eberstadt Report found that the National Security Act of 1947 soundly constructed the national security organization; however there remained organizational and qualitative inadequacies in national intelligence and the Central Intelligence Agency. The report's biggest criticism concerned the lack of coordination efforts between the CIA, the military, and the State Department that resulted in duplication efforts, and subjective and biased intelligence estimates.|$|E

In February 1927, Congress took up the McNary-Haugen bill again, this time narrowly passing it, and Coolidge vetoed it. In his veto message, he expressed {{the belief that the}} bill would do nothing to help farmers, benefiting only exporters and expanding the <b>federal</b> <b>bureaucracy.</b> Congress did not override the veto, but it passed the bill again in May 1928 by an increased majority; again, Coolidge vetoed it.

500|$|William Hayden English (August 27, 1822– February 7, 1896) was an American {{congressman from}} Indiana and the Democratic nominee for vice {{president}} in 1880. English entered politics at a young age, becoming a part of JesseD. Bright's conservative faction of the Indiana Democratic Party. [...] After a few years in the <b>federal</b> <b>bureaucracy</b> in Washington beginning in 1845, he returned to Indiana and participated in the state constitutional convention of 1850. [...] He {{was elected to the}} state house of representatives in 1851 and served as its speaker at the age of twenty-nine. [...] After a two-year term in the state house, English represented Indiana in the federal House of Representatives for four terms from 1853 to 1861, working most notably to achieve a compromise on the admission of Kansas as a state.|$|E
5000|$|Immigration Act of 1882 was {{the first}} broad United States federal {{immigration}} enforcement law.

2500|$|With the {{war over}} and slavery abolished, the federal {{government}} focused on improving the governance of the territories. It subdivided several territories, preparing them for statehood, following the precedents set by the Northwest Ordinance of 1787.

2500|$|American {{conservative}} commentators such as National Review writers Jonah Goldberg and Mark Steyn {{have argued}} that the website's launch was a disaster that presages larger problems throughout the entire law, with Goldberg asserting that [...] "the Republicans who insisted that this monstrosity had to be delayed are looking {{just a little bit more}} reasonable with every passing tick." [...] In a statement, the Republican National Committee (RNC) responded to President Obama's comments that the [...] "tech surge" [...] was code for a [...] "spending surge" [...] and will waste millions of dollars. Said statement also read, [...] "The <b>federal</b> <b>bureaucracy</b> has proven itself too slow, too bloated, too incompetent, and too outdated to manage America’s health care." ...|$|E
2500|$|Trump and Kiyosaki {{emphasize}} that business owners help create opportunity for others, writing, that the <b>federal</b> <b>bureaucracy</b> {{does not have}} the power to create meaningful employment, ascribing this power instead to those who engage in entrepreneurship. The book puts forth a strategy for success elaborated upon in five segments. The authors refer to this strategy as the [...] "Midas Touch" [...] formula, and write that such expertise is a requisite part of learning how to become a good business owner. These qualities include smaller innumerable characteristics, networking skills, brand name value, concentration to the task at hand, and mental fortitude. The authors warn about the middle-class squeeze, writing, that the oncoming disappearance of the middle class creates an opportunity for readers to gain wealth.|$|E
50|$|Iron triangles are three-pronged {{relationships}} {{that are used}} between interest groups. Generally these interest groups are composed of businesses, congressional committees, and Federal agencies set {{to deal with a}} certain issue. These iron triangles do not have the general welfare of the public in mind, but are for the furthering of favorable policies for the interest group. For example, an iron triangle dealing with fossil fuels would be composed of a business or corporation dealing in fossil fuels, a congressional committee who oversees fossil fuel laws and regulations, and a fossil fuel Federal Agency which makes sure these laws are obeyed. However, iron triangles do not benefit the public, they only benefit the players within the iron triangle. Some cases these iron triangles not only benefit inside the ring, but often do so {{at the expense of the}} constituencies that Congress and these <b>Federal</b> <b>bureaucracy’s</b> are supposed to represent.|$|R
50|$|By 1928, however, Calles {{had become}} distrustful of Morones, who had presidential ambitions. He was also wary of labor's socialist {{interpretation}} of the Revolution. He broke the CROM's power by ordering the <b>federal</b> arbitrating <b>bureaucracies</b> to declare all CROM strikes illegal.The CROM's leadership had become so corrupt that it had lost its influence with the rank-and-file, and was thus unable to organize action in its favor.|$|R

"Although Jackson {{dismissed}} {{far fewer}} government employees {{than most of}} his contemporaries imagined and {{although he did not}} originate the spoils system, he made more sweeping changes in the <b>Federal</b> <b>bureaucracy</b> than had any of his predecessors. What is even more significant is that he defended these changes as a positive good. At present when the use of political patronage is generally considered an obstacle to good government, it is worth remembering that Jackson and his followers invariably described rotation in public office as a [...] "reform." [...] In this sense the spoils system was more than a way to reward Jackson's friends and punish his enemies; it was also a device for removing from public office the representatives of minority political groups that Jackson insisted had been made corrupt by their long tenure." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hoover entered {{office with}} a plan to reform the nation's {{regulatory}} system, believing that a <b>federal</b> <b>bureaucracy</b> should have limited regulation over a country's economic system. Hoover sought a balance among labor, capital, and the government, and he has been variously labeled a corporatist or associationalist. Hoover saw the presidency as a vehicle for improving the conditions of all Americans by encouraging public-private cooperation—what he termed [...] "volunteerism". He tended to oppose governmental coercion or intervention, as he thought they infringed on American ideals of individualism and self-reliance. Hoover made extensive use of commissions to study issues and propose solutions, and many of those commissions were sponsored by private donors rather than by the government. One of the commissions started by Hoover, the Research Committee on Social Trends, was tasked with surveying the entirety of American society.|$|E
2500|$|Bannon has {{advocated}} {{reductions in}} immigration, and restrictions on free trade, particularly with China and Mexico. He {{is in favor}} of raising federal income taxes to 44% for those earning incomes over $5 million a year as a way to pay for middle class tax cuts. He also supports significantly increasing spending on infrastructure, describing himself as [...] "the guy pushing a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan". Bannon is opposed to government bailouts, describing them as [...] "socialism for the very wealthy". He generally believes in reducing the size of the <b>federal</b> <b>bureaucracy,</b> declaring at the Conservative Political Action Conference he favored the [...] "deconstruction of the administrative state". However, he does support increased regulation of internet companies like Facebook and Google, which he regards as akin to utilities in the modern age. He opposed the merger between Time-Warner and AT on antitrust grounds. He was a strong opponent of the Paris climate agreement within the administration, successfully persuading the President to withdraw from it.|$|E

The implementation of this policy showcases the extent to which agencies obey their elected leaders when their organizational capacities are threatened.

40|$|There is a {{familiar}} story {{about the history of}} government-subsidized housing in the United States, and it goes something like this: during the Great Depression, amidst widespread public concern about degraded dwelling conditions amongst the poor, federal housing programs of unprecedented scope and ambition are approved and implemented. An enormous burst of public housing construction ensues, and continues through most of the 1960 s as part of President Lyndon B. Johnson’s Great Society. Unfortunately, much of the housing is ill-conceived: it is architecturally out of scale with its surroundings, and designed {{in such a way that}} it eventually becomes unsafe. Furthermore, its management is ensnared in a tangle of hopelessly incompetent and unresponsive public housing authorities and <b>federal</b> <b>bureaucracies.</b> By the late 1960 s, public housing has become a nightmarish trap for its impoverished denizens, worse than the original slum neighborhoods that it often replaced, which at least offered a modicum of safety and social connections to their inhabitants. This ill-conceived overreach of the American welfare state, along with a sharp rightward lurch amongst the U. S. electorate with the election of Richard Nixon in 1968, eventually leads to an almost total retreat of the federal government from financing below-market housing. Ever since, the message from the American public sector to the poor has been that they are essentially on their own for finding adequate, safe, affordable housing...|$|R
