"Ah, Miss Dolly, if {{you knew}} how much, how very much you haf {{enlarged}} my happiness, and made this <b>efening</b> shine for me, you would more often be a little friendly, for this winter has been all summer to me, since I knew you and your kind home, and now I haf no sorrow but that after the next lesson I come no more unless you gif me leaf. See now I must say this even here, when so much people are about us, because I cannot stop it; and you will forgif me that I cannot wait any longer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, my friend! He ees {{call the}} 'cobblestone,' also the 'pouding-stone,' when he ees {{at his home}} in the country. He ees also a small 'boulder.' I pick him up; I crack him; he made three {{separate}} piece of conglomerate sandstone. I bring him home to my wife in my pocket. She rejoice; we are happy. When comes the <b>efening,</b> I sit down and make him a label; while my wife, she sit down and write of the Aztec. Ah, my friend, you shall say of the geology it ees a fine, a BEAUTIFUL study; but the study of the wife, and what shall please her, believe me, ees much finer! Believe your old Uncle 'Ennery every time! On thees question he gets there; he gets left, nevarre!" ...|$|R

[...] And he pointed to my work 'Yes,' they say to one another, these so kind ladies, 'he is a stupid old fellow, he will see not what we do, he will never observe that his sock heels go not in holes any more, he will think his buttons grow out new when they fall, and believe that strings make theirselves.' [...] "Ah! But I haf an eye, and I see much. I haf a heart, and I feel thanks for this. Come, a little lesson then and now, or--no more good fairy works for me and mine." ...|$|R

Nor can I tell {{why you should}} wear nature-sandals, nor why you should wear such cheap plue clothes. These are outside my instructions. Trifles, perhaps. Officially {{they are to be}} ignored.

5000|$|In Manchu cuisine, perilla {{leaves are}} used to make <b>efen</b> ( [...] ; [...] "steamed bun"). Often {{translated}} into Chinese as sū hàozǐ ( [...] ; [...] "perilla mouse"), zhān hàozǐ ( [...] ; [...] "glutinous mouse"), or sūyè bōbō ( [...] ; [...] "perilla leaf bun"), the perilla buns are made with glutinous sorghum or glutinous rice flour dough filled with red bean paste and wrapped with perilla leaves. The dish is related to Food Extermination Day (...) , a traditional Manchu holiday celebrated on every 26th day of the 8th month of the lunar calendar.|$|E

[...] He stopped to kiss his hand again toward the door, and lighted a cigarette. [...] "The geologian would not that he should break up the happy <b>efening</b> of his friends by thees small detail. He put aside his head--so; he say, 'A leetle freestone, a leetle granite, now and then, for variety; they are building in Montgomery Street.' I take the hint, like a wink to the horse that has gone blind. I attach to myself part of the edifice that is erecting himself in Montgomery Street. I crack him; I bring him home. I sit again at the feet of my beautiful Urania, and I label him 'Freestone,' 'Granite;' but I do not say 'from Parrott's Bank'--eet is not necessary for our happiness." ...|$|R
6000|$|I said {{something}} like this to Miller and Fowler, when we met at the club one afternoon not long after the final meeting of Cameron's Amateur Psychical Society, and I added: [...] "I must confess that most of the spirits I have met seem to me merely parasitic or secondary personalities (to use Maxwell's term), drawn from the psychic or from myself. Nearly every one of the mediums I have studied has had at least one guide, whose voice and habit of thought were perilously similar to her own. This, in some cases, has been laughable, as when 'Rolling Thunder,' a Sioux chief (Indians are all chiefs in the spirit world), appears and says: 'Goot <b>efening,</b> friends; id iss a nice night alretty.' And yet I have seen a whole roomful of people receive communications from a spirit of this kind with solemn awe. I burn with shame for the sitters and psychic when this kind of thing is going on." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of all genes {{have so far}} been identified and annotated systematically through in silico gene finding. Here we report the finding of 3662 strand-specific transcriptionally active regions (TARs) in the genome of Bacillus subtilis {{by the use of}} tiling arrays. We have measured the genome-wide expression during mid-exponential growth on rich (LB) and minimal (M 9) medium. The identified TARs account for 77. 3 % of the genes as they are currently annotated and additionally we find 84 putative non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) and 127 antisense transcripts. One ncRNA, ncr 22, is predicted to act as a translational control on cstA and an antisense transcript was observed opposite the housekeeping sigma factor sigA. Through this work we have discovered a long conserved 3 ′ untranslated region (UTR) in a group of membrane-associated genes that is predicted to fold into a large and highly stable secondary structure. One of the genes having this tail is <b>efeN,</b> which encodes a target of the twin-arginine translocase (Tat) protein translocation system...|$|E
