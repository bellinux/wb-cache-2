5|$|Crest badges, {{much like}} clan tartans, do not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>history,</b> and owe much to Victorian era romanticism, having only been worn on the bonnet since the 19th century. The {{original}} badges used by clans {{are said to}} have been specific plants worn in bonnets or hung from a pole or spear.|$|E
5|$|Seabirds {{and humans}} <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>history</b> together: they have {{provided}} food to hunters, guided fishermen to fishing stocks and led sailors to land. Many species are currently threatened by human activities, and conservation efforts are under way.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} species of cacti {{have been shown to}} contain psychoactive agents, {{chemical}} compounds that can cause changes in mood, perception and cognition through their effects on the brain. Two species <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>history</b> of use by the indigenous peoples of the Americas: peyote, Lophophora williamsii, in North America, and the San Pedro cactus, Echinopsis pachanoi, in South America. Both contain mescaline.|$|E

5|$|The Somerset Levels—specifically dry {{points at}} Glastonbury and Brent Knoll— also <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>history</b> of settlement, and {{are known to}} have been settled by Mesolithic hunters. Travel in the area was {{facilitated}} by the construction of one of the world's oldest known engineered roadways, the Sweet Track, which dates from 3807 BC or 3806 BC.|$|E
5|$|The {{conventional}} {{approach was}} probably {{the first to be}} employed, since it is comparatively easy to destroy weeds by burning them or ploughing them under, and to kill larger competing herbivores. Techniques such as crop rotation, companion planting (also known as intercropping or mixed cropping), and the selective breeding of pest-resistant cultivars <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>history.</b>|$|E
5|$|Skeptics {{argue that}} {{conspiracy}} theorists grossly overestimate {{the influence of}} ex-Nazis and neo-Nazis on American society, and point out that political repression at home and imperialism abroad <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>history</b> in the United States that predates the 20th century. Some political scientists, such as Sheldon Wolin, have {{expressed concern that the}} twin forces of democratic deficit and superpower status have paved the way in the U.S. for the emergence of an inverted totalitarianism which contradicts many principles of Nazism.|$|E

5|$|Somewhere between 29 and 67 {{species are}} {{recognised}} in the genus, with estimates {{of as many as}} 100. Incomplete herbarium collections make it difficult to determine whether certain groups represent single species, or groups of similar species. Attalea species <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>history</b> of human use, and include economically important sources of palm oil and fibre. Many species are fire tolerant and thrive in disturbed habitats. Their seeds are animal dispersed, including some which are thought to have been adapted for dispersal by now-extinct Pleistocene megafauna.|$|E
5|$|The Betsimisaraka ("the many inseparables") are {{the second}} largest ethnic group in Madagascar after the Merina and make up {{approximately}} fifteen percent of the Malagasy people. They occupy a large stretch of the eastern coastal region of Madagascar, from Mananjary {{in the south to}} Antalaha in the north. The Betsimisaraka <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>history</b> of extensive interaction with European seafarers and traders that produced a significant subset with mixed European-Malagasy origins, termed the zana-malata. European influence is evident in the local valse (waltz) and basesa musical genres, which are typically performed on the accordion. Tromba (spirit possession) ceremonies feature strongly in Betsimisaraka culture.|$|E
5|$|The annual {{third group}} {{overnight}} nature trip to Wisconsin, {{dates back to}} 1974, and the eighth group French immersion trip began in the 1970s with trips to Paris and since the mid-1990s to Quebec. Other lower school traditions, such as the Native American Fair and class visit to the Coonley Estate, also <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>history</b> at Avery Coonley. Middle school traditions include the alternating annual Greek and Shakespeare Fests, the sixth group World's Fair, and a seventh group trip to Washington, DC.|$|E

5|$|The {{intertidal}} mud flats {{of the bay}} <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>history</b> of use for fishing, with {{structures on}} Stert Flats being dated by dendrochronological analysis to between 932 and 966. It is the last site in England used for 'mudhorse fishing' in which a wooden sledge is propelled across the mudflats to collect fish from nets. Catches include: Thinlip mullet, plaice, dogfish, cuttlefish, skate, shrimp, prawns, sea bass, and sole. Watchet Boat Museum displays the unusual local flatner boats which were used for fishing in the bay, along with associated artefacts.|$|E
5|$|Attalea species <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>history</b> {{of human}} utilisation. Carbonised Attalea maripa seeds {{have been found}} in archaeological sites in Colombia dating back to 9000 BP. A variety of species remain {{important}} sources of edible oil, thatch, edible seeds and fibre. The leaves of Attalea butyracea and A.maripa are used extensively for thatching. Several species are oil palms, with A.speciosa among the most important economically. Products extracted from A.speciosa were reported to support over 300,000 households in the Brazilian state of Maranhão in 2005, and in 1985 it was estimated to support over 450,000 households throughout the Brazil. Piassava fibres, extracted from the leaf bases of A.funifera, are commercially important, and generated about US$20 million in annual income to Brazilian farmers in 1996.|$|E
5|$|Many fungi produce biologically active compounds, {{several of}} which are toxic to animals or plants and are {{therefore}} called mycotoxins. Of particular relevance to humans are mycotoxins produced by molds causing food spoilage, and poisonous mushrooms (see above). Particularly infamous are the lethal amatoxins in some Amanita mushrooms, and ergot alkaloids, which <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>history</b> of causing serious epidemics of ergotism (St Anthony's Fire) in people consuming rye or related cereals contaminated with sclerotia of the ergot fungus, Claviceps purpurea. Other notable mycotoxins include the aflatoxins, which are insidious liver toxins and highly carcinogenic metabolites produced by certain Aspergillus species often growing in or on grains and nuts consumed by humans, ochratoxins, patulin, and trichothecenes (e.g., T-2 mycotoxin) and fumonisins, which have significant impact on human food supplies or animal livestock.|$|E

5|$|Rwanda {{does not}} <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>history</b> of written literature, {{but there is}} a strong oral {{tradition}} ranging from poetry to folk stories. Many of the country's moral values and details of history have been passed down through the generations. The most famous Rwandan literary figure was Alexis Kagame (1912–1981), who carried out and published research into oral traditions as well as writing his own poetry. The Rwandan Genocide resulted in the emergence of a literature of witness accounts, essays and fiction by a new generation of writers such as Benjamin Sehene. A number of films have been produced about the Rwandan Genocide, including the Golden Globe-nominated Hotel Rwanda, Shake Hands with the Devil, Sometimes in April, and Shooting Dogs, the last two having been filmed in Rwanda and having featured survivors as cast members.|$|E
5|$|Several old bronze statues {{that line}} the {{courtyard}} of the temple <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>history</b> as war loot. They were originally Khmer statues, found at Angkor Wat in Cambodia, and were taken to Ayutthaya in 1431 by the Siamese. In 1564, the Burmese king Bayinnaung conquered Ayutthaya and took thirty such statues to Bago (Pegu). In 1599, King Razagri of Mrauk U invaded Bago and brought the statues to Mrauk U. Finally, Thado Minsaw took them to Amarapura in 1785. According to local belief, many more of these statues were brought from Arakan. However, King Thibaw melted many of them to cast cannons for fortification of his palace. Of the thirty statues Bayinnaung brought from Siam, only six remain today, and are displayed in the temple complex. They are a major attraction because of their purported healing qualities.|$|E
5|$|The game {{takes place}} within the fictional {{universe}} in which prior Traveller releases are also set. The most significant power in this universe is the human-dominated Imperium which predominates across thousands of inhabited solar systems. Bordering the regions controlled by the Imperium are other interstellar powers including the Zhodani Consulate. The Imperium and the Zhodani <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>history</b> of tense relations and, as the game begins, rumors of another frontier war are circulating. Against this backdrop, a security agent working for Sharushid, a large corporation active throughout the Imperium, discovers that a company sub-sector chief named Konrad Kiefer is secretly aiding the Zhodani by smuggling arms {{across the border into}} the hands of dissidents in preparation for an uprising within the Imperium to be coordinated with a Zhodani attack. This security agent encounters five experienced adventurers in a bar on the planet Efate and entrusts them with evidence of Kiefer's treachery. These adventurers are tasked with delivering the evidence to a second Sharushid agent located in another solar system and ultimately with stopping Kiefer and his conspiracy against the Imperium. The player assumes control over the party just after the security agent entrusts it with the evidence against Kiefer.|$|E
