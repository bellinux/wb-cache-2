The rules that should {{be observed by the}} mapmaker are described. In the next section are delineated the current possibilities how to create hachures in <b>digital</b> <b>cartography.</b> The existing algorithms are evaluated. On the basis of the rules and research of literature is designed own methodology. Emphasis is put on automation using digital terrain model. The work as well contains testing the algorithm on the real data. Key words: hachures, <b>digital</b> <b>cartography,</b> hypsograph...|$|R

40|$|Landslides, scree {{and other}} {{specific}} terrain objects in topographical databases and <b>digital</b> <b>cartography</b> Abstract Topographic maps capture {{detailed information about}} terrain. In traditional analogous way of creating these maps, understandable and illustrating cartographic symbology was used. However, certain spheres of symbology were modified with transition to digital topographic databases and <b>digital</b> <b>cartography.</b> Now they carry less information and are less illustrative. Main cause of this inaccuracy is imperfection of the cartographic software, which is unable to create appropriate symbology. This diploma thesis tries to solve aforesaid problem for some specific terrain objects as scree and landslides. These shapes are distinctive geomorphologic phenomenon in terrain, but they are often neglected as their occurrence in our territory is infrequent. Key words: topographic maps, <b>digital</b> <b>cartography,</b> scree, landslide, specific terrain objec...|$|R
40|$|Through an {{historical}} review of cinematic maps – or “cinemaps ” – this paper argues that contemporary <b>digital</b> <b>cartography</b> was conceptualized in films. This argument is first developed through {{a discussion of}} the emergence of animated maps in docudramas of the 1910 s. These early cinemaps were followed by more sophisticated examples that foreshadowed the structure and design principles of “modern ” cartography. The cinemap that appears in the movie M (Fritz Lang 1931) can be considered the first “modern ” map as it prefigures many of the current functions of contemporary <b>digital</b> <b>cartography</b> such as the combination image/map, use of sound, shifts in perspective, and spatial analysis. The remaining functions of <b>digital</b> <b>cartography,</b> including zooming and live data rendering were conceptualized in cinema by the 1960 s, as illustrated by examples from movies such as Casablanca, Dr. Strangelove and Goldfinger. When professional cartographers were creating their first animated maps, most of the functions of contemporary <b>digital</b> <b>cartography</b> had already been implemented in cinema. Building on these results, the paper anticipates the future incursion of mapping technologies into interpersonal, confidential, and private spaces through the study of contemporary cinemaps...|$|R

40|$|Managing {{spatial data}} in paper maps is quite {{different}} from managing digital spatial information. Sometimes manual vectorization of scanned maps {{is the only way to}} produce <b>digital</b> <b>cartography,</b> especially when the only source of spatial information is a paper map. Digital scanning and manual vectorization are two processes well known for adding error to data and accuracy is a particularly important issue for users of spatial information. The National Ecological Reserve (Reserva Ecológica Nacional- REN) established in the Portuguese national law protects areas with a diversified bio-physic structure and specific ecological characteristics. This information is often required to manage several human activities, such as mineral extraction, real estate, industry, tourism, etc. REN maps were originally produced in paper and were vectorized to produce <b>digital</b> <b>cartography.</b> The objective of this study is to measure the spatial accuracy and to assure the conformity with the original cartography. The accuracy of the REN <b>digital</b> <b>cartography</b> was assessed through a stratified sampling scheme, with strata defined as ecological classes within each county.

40|$|Increased {{activity}} in <b>digital</b> <b>cartography</b> and geographic information systems has clarified {{the need for}} standards and has sharply increased the demand for them. Nations {{are looking at the}} standards question in different ways and with different urgencies, based on their progress in <b>digital</b> <b>cartography</b> and geographic and (or) land informa tion systems, identification of responsible agencies for development and promulgation of standards and the diver sity of perceptions about the need for standards. This paper comments on the standards development experience in the U. S. A. and in several other countries. WHY ARE STANDARDS NEEDED? If we are to understand the importance of digital carto graphic standards, we must examine the fundamental dif ferences between conventional printed graphics (maps) and digital representations of spatial data. With the former, spatial relationships and cartographic features are drawn directly and symbolized for relatively easy visual percep tion by the map reader, while in the digital domain, there is need to be specific and unambiguous in coding the spa tial relationships among various data elements that con stitute the surficial and deep structure of the carto graphic model. Further, this must be done in accordance with acceptable ADP practice. In <b>digital</b> <b>cartography,</b> problems arise when an individual or an organization attempt to use data from a data base compiled by another individual or organization.

40|$|Abstract:-. Usually, {{every country}} has {{specific}} organisms {{in charge of}} the design, production, spread and update of fundamental cartography. Each one of these organisms produces cartographic projects with the procedures, tools and staff better adapted to its objectives. Final result of cartographic campaigns are usually products that are presented on paper or other tangible formats. During the last years, cartographic organisms offer as one of their products the <b>digital</b> <b>cartography,</b> that is much more versatile if the end user applies appropriate computer tools. Specially with the spread of the Internet, GPS navigators and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), <b>digital</b> <b>cartography</b> has turned into one of the main products which has reveal the need of establishing a network of cartographic servers for the organisms that use geographic information. In this way, some national (IDEE) and European (INSPIRE) initiatives are being developed. We should support these meritorious initiatives, that should go beyond the current approaches. In this paper the need of change of the approach and the way cartography is produced is reviewed, as well as the advantages that would appear based on the Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDI) framework...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper will}} {{demonstrate}} how new technologies in cartographic environment integrate acquisition, management and representation techniques for georefencing data processing. Moreover, {{there is an}} ever-growing demand for a more “representative ” and “world widespread” <b>digital</b> <b>cartography.</b> More representative means the capabilities in describing physical phenomena but also social, economic and cultural data that are necessarily connected to geographical aspects. More widespread derives from the growing use of cartographic products by non-specialized users. Among the different formats of numerical cartography, threedimensional maps are certainly the more suitable. These represent a cartographic typology corresponding to different levels of accuracy and details to describe reality, such as DTM and city modelling. They provide geometrical and qualitative information coming {{from the use of}} historical documents and present-day aerial and terrestrial photo suitably processed: such as orthophotos mapped onto DTM for a more truthful description of territory.
