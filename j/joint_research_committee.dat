This study investigates the development of morphology in the interlanguage of English learners of Xhosa.

The elicitation tasks employed range from fairly unstructured conversation tasks to highly structured sentence-manipulation tasks. The learners have varying levels of competence {{at the beginning of the}} study and they are exposed to input mainly in formal contexts of learning. One of the aims of the study is to investigate whether the features of interlanguage identified in other studies appear in the learner language in this study. Most other studies discussed in the literature have investigated the features of the interlanguage produced by learners of analytic and inflectional languages. However, this study analyses the interlanguage of learners of an agglutinative language. Studies of other languages have concluded that learners do not use inflectional or agreemen...|$|E
40|$|This article {{highlights}} the emerging literature on therapist responsiveness in psychotherapy and examines several concepts {{used to identify}} dimensions of responsiveness. Some methodological obstacles are identified to studying responsiveness in a systematic manner, and several examples of existing responsiveness research are reviewed. It is argued that meaningful theory on responsiveness has emerged from research methods that are qualitative and interpretive and that the writing of systematic case studies can be of particular importance since only the presentation of a case unfolding over time can disclose {{some of the more}} complex aspects of therapist responsiveness. Examination of a series of systematic case studies of the treatment of post traumatic case disorder in South Africa was used to derive a model for guiding therapist responsiveness with respect with what to focus on at a particular phase of the therapy within a particular session. Material from the cases is used to illustrate aspects of the model related to building social support for the client and promoting emotional processing of trauma memories.

With the aim of producing reproducible data on the modification of a pesticide under controlled photodegradation conditions, we have now undertaken a study where both the substrate and the pesticide are well characterized. This {{is the case for}} norflurazon deposited onto an aluminium substrate, in particular regarding the reproducibility of preparation of the samples and the change with time of their chemical composition. Degradation parameters have been derived from the variation in yield of ions representative of the molecule and of its breakdown products and, particularly, from the time required for 50 % dissipation of their initial concentration (DT 50). DT 50 values ranging between 1 and 10 h have been found. An interpretation of the degradation process is proposed from the decay of other ions. As expected, the degradation is faster when the UV sunlight is unfiltered (a factor of 3. 8 for the molecule, and around 5 for the breakdown products) ...|$|R
40|$|Objective. The {{potential}} of NaHCO 3 versus human serum to induce germ tube formation in Candida albicans was investigated. Specimens. A total of 100 isolates {{were obtained from}} oral swabs of patients presenting with thrush. Approval for the study was granted by the <b>Joint</b> <b>Research</b> Ethics <b>Committee</b> (JREC/ 23 / 08). Method. Confirmed C. albicans isolates by routine methods were tested for germ tube induction using 5 different concentrations of Tris-maleate buffered NaHCO 3 and Tris-maleate buffer control. Standard control strains included were C. albicans (ATCC 10231) and C. krusei (ATCC 6258). Microculture was done in 20 [*]μL inoculums on microscope slides for 3 hours at 37 °C. The rate of germ tube formation at 10 -minute intervals was determined on 100 isolates using the optimum 20 [*]mM Tris-maleate buffered NaHCO 3 concentration. Parallel germ tube formation using human serum was done in test tubes. Results. The optimum concentration of NaHCO 3 in Tris-maleate buffer for germ tube induction was 20 [*]mM for 67 % of isolates. Only 21 % of isolates formed germ tubes in Tris-maleate buffer control. There {{was no significant difference}} in induction between human serum and Tris-maleate buffered NaHCO 3. Conclusion.

This exchange type was developed by three members of the <b>Joint</b> Electronic <b>Research</b> <b>Committee,</b> JERC, which was formed in 1956 and lasted until 1969. This consisted of the British Post Office (GPO), Siemens Brothers & Co Ltd (shortly to be part of AEI, who were subsequently merged with GEC in the early 1960s), Automatic Telephone & Electric Co. Ltd (known as AT&E and merged with Plessey in 1961), the British company Ericsson Telephones Ltd (also merged with Plessey in 1961) - see http://web.ukonline.co.uk/freshwater/histatm.htm), General Electric Co. (GEC), and Standard Telephones & Cables Ltd. (STC). The three members of the JERC who actually built the exchange were STC, AEI and AT&E. STC built the common control, AEI the switching, line scanning and test console, whilst AT&E took care of the dialling capturing equipment (registers) and the incoming and outgoing junctions. (A 'junction' in British telephonic terms was not a junction in the everyday sense, but the name given to the pair of wires connecting a call between a satellite exchange and the main exchange.) The actual development of the TXE1 started around 1963, and went into service in 1968. There were models of the AEI equipment at Blackheath, London and the ATE equipment at Edge Lane, Liverpool.
