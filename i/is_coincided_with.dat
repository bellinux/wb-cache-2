40|$|Abstract [...] Image shape {{restoration}} {{based on}} mathematical transformation {{is a successful}} approach to nonlinear distortions in computer vision, robot vision and pattern recognition. The key {{of this process is}} to find the distortion function and its inverse function. Usually, the distortion function is unknown or unclear. Even in the case of that when the function is known, it remains difficult o compute or estimate the parameters necessary for the restoration. To overcome this problem, in this paper, Coons transformation utilizing the boundary functions for the distorted images have been used to approximate he exact distortion function. The boundary functions are calculated using B-spline curve interpolation, which <b>is</b> <b>coincided</b> <b>with</b> the necessary condition of major elements that constitute a Coons transformation.

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{demonstrate}} that the radiofrequency (RF) electric field in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be modified {{in order to enhance}} patient safety. The heating of metallic devices in MRI is directly related to electric field distribution. On the other hand the MR image homogeneity is related to forward polarized component of the magnetic field (transmit sensitivity). In order to prevent heating, electric field-free zones should be generated in the body without significantly altering the transmit sensitivity. For this purpose the linearly polarized birdcage coil is proposed as a metallic device friendly MRI coil. The zero electric field plane of the linear birdcage coil <b>is</b> <b>coincided</b> <b>with</b> the location of the metallic device and the heating is reduced as shown by simulations and experiments. One disadvantage of this approach is, the linear coils generate twice as much whole body average SAR when compared to quadrature birdcage coils.

Surfactins have the common following structural traits: a heptapeptide with a chiral sequence LLDLLDL interlinked with a β-hydroxy fatty acid and with a d-Leu in position 3 and 6 and a l-Asp in position 5. Amino acid residues in position 2, 4 and 7 belong to the amino acids group including Val, Leu and Ile (Jacques 2011; Hue et al. 2001). With a Gln in the position 1 are named lichenysin which are different from surfactin with the Glu in the position 1 (Qiu et al. 2014). Some of the isoforms had the same m/z by ESI–MS, but they were in different HPLC fraction.
