5|$|Parallel {{computing}} {{is a type}} of computation {{in which}} many calculations or the execution of processes are carried out simultaneously. Large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which can then be solved at the same time. There are several different forms of parallel computing: bit-level, instruction-level, data, and task parallelism. Parallelism has been employed for many years, mainly in high-performance computing, but interest in it has grown lately due to the physical constraints preventing frequency scaling. As power consumption (and consequently <b>heat</b> <b>generation)</b> by computers has become a concern in recent years, parallel computing has become the dominant paradigm in computer architecture, mainly in the form of multi-core processors.|$|E

Temperature-dependent thermal conductivities and internal <b>heat</b> <b>generations</b> are assumed for both materials. The nonlinear system of differential equations is solved with the differential transformation method (DTM) {{which is a}} semi-analytical technique. The temperature and entropy generation data derived from the DTM are validated against analytical solution for convective composite walls with temperature-independent thermal conductivities and internal <b>heat</b> <b>generations.</b> In {{the view of the}} fact that composite walls are one of the classical examples in many scientific communities, the local and total entropy generations presented in this study can be useful addition for many scientific and engineering fields where one wants to minimize the irreversibility of the system...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} the effect of Joule <b>heating</b> <b>generation</b> on the {{hydrodynamic}} profile and the solute transport found in electrophoretic devices is addressed in this article. The research is focused on the following two problems: The first one is centered around the effect of Joule heating on the hydrodynamic velocity profile and it is referred to as "the carrier fluid problem. " The other one is related to the effect of Joule heating on the solute transport inside electrophoretic cells and it is referred to as "the solute problem". The hydrodynamic aspects were studied first to yield the velocity profiles required for analysis of the solute transport problem. The velocity profile obtained in this study is analytical and the results are valid for non-Newtonian fluids carriers. To this end, the power-law model was used to study the effect of the rheology of the material in conjunction with the effect of Joule <b>heating</b> <b>generation</b> inside batch electrophoretic devices. This aspect of the research was then effectively used to study the effect of Joule <b>heating</b> <b>generation</b> on the motion of solutes (such as macromolecules) under the influence of non-Newtonian carriers. This aspect of the study was performed using an area-averaging approach that yielded analytical results for the effective diffusivity of the device...|$|R

25|$|Besides cooling, {{cutting fluids}} also aid the cutting process by {{lubricating}} {{the interface between}} the tool's cutting edge and the chip.

40|$|Abstract. The {{recently}} derived {{characteristics of}} small scale variability {{associated with the}} Weimer E-field convection model (Matsuo et al. 2002) are used as an additional input to the Coupled Thermosphere Ionosphere Plasmasphere Electrodynamics Model (CTIPE) to study the influence of auroral E-field variability on the thermosphere and ionosphere during quiet times. It is assumed that the Weimer electric field model has an approximate Gaussian distribution of small-scale variability around the mean and that this variability is fully defined by the high-latitude standard deviation pattern associated with the mean. The variability as described by the standard deviation {{is larger than the}} mean in most of the polar cap and auroral zone. Since in the Gaussian distribution case the average field and the variability have equal weight contributions to Joule <b>heating</b> <b>generation,</b> the inclusion of small-scale variability in CTIPE more than doubles the hemispheric Joule <b>heating</b> <b>generation.</b> The inclusion of variability brings the modeled thermospheric temperature and neutral composition structure in better agreement with observations during geomagnetic quiet conditions, resulting in better ionospheric modeling. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{finite element analysis}} of non-isothermal elasto-plastic multiphase geomaterials in dynamics including frictional <b>heating</b> <b>generation.</b> A fully coupled mathematical model is developed within the Hybrid Mixture theory. A computationally efficient reduced formulation is derived following the u-p-T approach. Two strain localization problems are simulated. The first one is a plain strain compression test of globally undrained water saturated dense sand. The second test concerns a rapid strain localization example inspired by the Vajont landslide (Italy, 1963). The numerical results show that cavitation occurs at strain localization in the first test and the frictional heating increases slightly {{the temperature in the}} shear band, anticipating the onset of cavitation in comparison with the case neglecting the heating generated by friction. The second numerical test shows a temperature increase in the shear band much higher than the boiling temperature of the liquid water, with consequent formation of a vapor cushion and loss of shear strength. These simulations show that frictional <b>heating</b> <b>generation</b> may have a role in dynamic strain localization, in particular during the development of rapid catastrophic landslides...|$|R

25|$|These instabilities may {{be caused}} by the {{decrease}} of the friction force with an increasing velocity of sliding, by material expansion due to <b>heat</b> <b>generation</b> during friction (the thermo-elastic instabilities), or by pure dynamic effects of sliding of two elastic materials (the Adams-Martins instabilities). The latter were originally discovered in 1995 by George G. Adams and João Arménio Correia Martins for smooth surfaces and were later found in periodic rough surfaces. In particular, friction-related dynamical instabilities are thought to be responsible for brake squeal and the 'song' of a glass harp, phenomena which involve stick and slip, modelled as a drop of friction coefficient with velocity.|$|E
