500|$|The {{short film}} was {{produced}} by Emma Ludbrook, Allan Wachs and Jared Leto, who also directed. Although it is billed as a [...] "Bartholomew Cubbins Film" [...] (Leto's [...] longtime pseudonym), [...] "City of Angels" [...] is the first directorial project directly credited to Jared Leto. He explained, [...] "It {{was the first time}} I'd <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> <b>that.</b> I'd used several different names, but it was just such a personal thing. I thought it was appropriate to put my name on that piece." [...] Previous collaborator Devid Levlin served as director of photography. It was edited by Leto, Benjamin Entrup and Mischa Meyer. The short film included commentary from Kanye West, Christopher Lloyd Dennis, Juliette Lewis, Heather Levinger, Haywood, Lindsay Lohan, Olivia Wilde, Steve Nash, Ashley Olsen, Lily Collins, James Franco, Selena Gomez, Alan Cumming, Anthony Warfield, Jovan Rameau, Holly Beavon, Shaun White, Corey Feldman, and Yosh. [...] "City of Angels" [...] marked the second collaboration of Thirty Seconds to Mars with Kanye West, as they first worked together on the track [...] "Hurricane" [...] (2010).|$|E
2500|$|Bradley Cooper {{said that}} [...] "logistically, {{to get from}} point A to point B [...] {{incredibly}} difficult and the bureaucracy and getting things done. There are always tons {{of people around the}} set and Todd loves a lean set and it was always the opposite, so watching a director deal with that – especially when it was Todd Phillips – was interesting." [...] He then went on to say, in a later part of the interview, that [...] "it was the hardest shoot that I had <b>ever</b> <b>done,</b> <b>that</b> Zach had <b>ever</b> <b>done,</b> <b>that</b> Ed had ever done and that Todd had ever done." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gators {{starting}} quarterback Danny Wuerffel threw for 242 yards and five touchdowns {{before leaving the}} game in the third quarter. [...] With the Gators leading 38–17 in the fourth quarter, Gators backup quarterback Eric Kresser threw for two more touchdowns, one with 1:21 remaining, to make the final score 52–17. [...] After the game, Gators coach Steve Spurrier stated that he had wanted to be the first opponent to hang [...] "half a hundred" [...] on the Bulldogs in their own stadium because [...] "we heard no one had <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> <b>that</b> before." [...] The Gators' fifty-two points remains the record for most scored against Georgia [...] "between the hedges." ...|$|E

2500|$|This novel caused Adams {{to become}} acquainted with the {{well-known}} scientist Richard Dawkins. As Dawkins explains, [...] "As soon as I finished it, I turned back to page one and read it straight through again – the only time I have <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> <b>that,</b> and I wrote to tell him so. He replied {{that he was a}} fan of my books, and he invited me to his house in London." [...] Adams would later introduce Dawkins to the woman who was to become his third wife, the actress Lalla Ward, best known for playing the character Romana in Doctor Who. One of her early serials on the programme was City of Death, which Adams wrote, and which shares certain plot elements with the novel.|$|E
2500|$|At a 19 May press conference, de Gaulle {{asserted}} {{again that}} he was at the disposal of the country. As a journalist expressed the concerns of some who feared that he would violate civil liberties, de Gaulle retorted vehemently: [...] "Have I <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> <b>that?</b> On the contrary, I have re-established them when they had disappeared. Who honestly believes that, at age 67, I would start a career as a dictator?" [...] A constitutionalist by conviction, he maintained throughout the crisis that he would accept power only from the lawfully constituted authorities. De Gaulle did not wish to repeat the difficulty the Free French movement experienced in establishing legitimacy as the rightful government. He told an aide that the rebel generals [...] "will not find de Gaulle in their baggage".|$|E
2500|$|Florida {{was ahead}} 210 less than 12 {{minutes into the}} contest. [...] Gators {{starting}} quarterback Danny Wuerffel threw for 242 yards and five touchdowns before leaving {{the game in the}} third quarter. [...] "Danny Wuerffel was near perfect in the game," [...] Spurrier said. [...] "He only had one bad throw." [...] With the Gators leading 3817 in the fourth quarter, Gators backup quarterback Eric Kresser threw for two more touchdowns, one with 1:21 remaining, to make the final score 5217. [...] After the game, Gators coach Steve Spurrier stated that he had wanted to be the first opponent to hang [...] "half a hundred" [...] on the Bulldogs in their own stadium because [...] "we heard no one had <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> <b>that</b> before."

2500|$|Emerson would {{occasionally}} cover or sample other musical works in his compositions. Permission to use pieces was sometimes denied by the composer or his family; for example Gustav Holst's daughter refused to grant official permission for rock bands to perform her late father's composition Mars, the Bringer of War. However, {{a number of}} composers did grant permission for their works to be used. Aaron Copland {{said that there was}} [...] "something that attracted [...] " [...] about ELP's version of [...] "Fanfare for the Common Man", and so approved its use, although he said, [...] "What they do in the middle (i.e., the modal section between repeats of Copland's theme), I'm not sure exactly how they connect that with my music" [...] Alberto Ginastera, on the other hand, enthusiastically approved Emerson's electronic realisation of the fourth movement of his first piano concerto, which appeared on their album Brain Salad Surgery under the title [...] "Toccata". Ginastera said, [...] "You have captured the essence of my music, and no one's <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> <b>that</b> before." ...|$|E
2500|$|After Sondheim {{finished}} Evening Primrose, Jerome Robbins {{asked him}} to adapt Bertolt Brecht's The Measures Taken despite the composer's general dislike of Brecht's work. Robbins wanted to adapt another Brecht play, The Exception and the Rule, and asked John Guare to adapt the book. Leonard Bernstein had not written for the stage in some time, and his contract as conductor of the New York Philharmonic was ending. Sondheim was invited to Robbins' house {{in the hope that}} Guare would convince him to write the lyrics for a musical version of The Exception and the Rule; according to Robbins, Bernstein would not work without Sondheim. When Sondheim agreed, Guare asked: [...] "Why haven't you all worked together since West Side Story?" [...] Sondheim answered, [...] "You'll see". Guare said that working with Sondheim was like being with an old college roommate, and he depended on him to [...] "decode and decipher their crazy way of working"; Bernstein worked only after midnight, and Robbins only in the early morning. Bernstein's score, which was supposed to be light, was influenced by his need to make a musical statement. Stuart Ostrow, who worked with Sondheim on The Girls Upstairs, agreed to produce the musical (now entitled A Pray By Blecht and, later, The Race to Urga). An opening night was scheduled, but during auditions Robbins asked to be excused for a moment. When he did not return, a doorman said he had gotten into a limousine to go to John F. Kennedy International Airport. Bernstein burst into tears and said, [...] "It's over"; Sondheim said, [...] "I was ashamed of the whole project. It was arch and didactic in the worst way." [...] He wrote one-and-a-half songs and threw them away, the only time he has <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> <b>that.</b> Eighteen years later, Sondheim refused Bernstein and Robbins' request to retry the show.|$|E

50|$|In 1952, Jones, halfbacks Gib Dawson and Billy Quinn and fullback Dick Ochoa created Texas' all-time {{greatest}} backfield combination. All four {{made the}} All-Southwest Conference team, {{the only time}} one's school's backfield <b>ever</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> in conference history. Against Texas A&M, Jones, Dawson and Quinn all rushed for more than 100 yards, the first time 3 players <b>ever</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> in a single game for a Longhorn team, and a feat that has only been repeated once since. The team set the school record for rushing, and the school and conference records for total offense. Jones won the Houston Post's Southwest Conference MVP Trophy. The Longhorns won the Southwest Conference and beat Tennessee in the 1953 Cotton Bowl.|$|R

6000|$|... "And do {{you think}} bad of me now? Did you not tell me before I went out that you would trust me, and have you so soon {{forgotten}} your trust? Look at me, mamma. What have I <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> <b>that</b> you should think me to be such as she says?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Then {{they went}} to Dr. Tempest, who was also an old man. [...] "Yes, my Lord, I shall be proud to second you," [...] said the rector. [...] "I didn't think <b>that</b> I should <b>ever</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> to one of your name in Silverbridge." ...|$|R

50|$|Devin Booker {{would not}} only be the fifth rookie in Suns history to record at least 900 points in {{franchise}} history behind only Amar'e Stoudemire, Michael Finley, Walter Davis, and Alvan Adams, but he'd also be the youngest player to <b>ever</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> in franchise history.|$|R

6000|$|All this Lightfoot saw as {{he stood}} among the little hemlock-trees {{at the top of}} the ridge behind the hunter. He saw and he understood.

60|$|Apparently {{nobody had}} <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> <b>that.</b> There were ruined castles on the {{overhanging}} cliffs and crags all the way; these {{were said to}} have their legends, like those on the Rhine, and what was better still, they had never been in print. There was nothing in the books about that lovely region; it had been neglected by the tourist, it was virgin soil for the literary pioneer.|$|E
50|$|Adi and Avi throw a {{challenge}} at each other. Adi will behave like Avi is {{his girlfriend and}} Avi too will consider him as her boyfriend. Avi {{will try to make}} Adi express his love for her and Adi tells her he will never <b>ever</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b>|$|R

6000|$|... "Why, what <b>did</b> I <b>ever</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> {{was good}} to you, except marry Mr. Grandcourt?"

[...] "And I should not have <b>done</b> <b>that</b> unless it had pleased myself." [...] She tossed up her chin, and reached her hat.|$|R
6000|$|... "I was {{not afraid}} of her. When she spoke to me, I would {{have nothing to say}} to her;--not a word; not a word;--not a word." [...] As he said this he waved his hands about.

6000|$|Less {{clear and}} more instinctive than her {{desire for a}} {{proposal}} was her inclination to see just all that Mr. Magnet was disposed to do, and hear all that he was disposed to say.

But then none of the boys, the [...] "others" [...] {{with whom she had}} at times stretched a hand towards the hem of emotion, had <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> <b>that.</b> She had an obscure feeling that perhaps presently Mr. Magnet must light up, be stirred and stirring. Even now his voice changed very interestingly when he was alone with her. His breath seemed to go--as though something had pricked his lung. If it hadn't been for that new, disconcerting realization of an official pressure behind him, I think she would have been quite ready to experiment extensively with his emotions....|$|E

Only, do you remember what some French novelist once said?--"A poet's sweetest poem is always the one he has never been able to compose." [...] I often think that's true of music, too. Away up in the higher stories of one's brain somewhere, there's a tune floating about, or rather a whole oratorio full of them, that one can never catch and fix upon ruled paper. The idea's there, such a beautiful and vague idea, so familiar to one, but so utterly unrealisable on any known instrument--a sort of musical Ariel, flitting before one and tantalising one for ever, but never allowing one to come up with it and see its real features. I'm always dissatisfied with what I've actually written, and longing to crystallise into a score the imaginary airs I can never catch. Except in this last piece of mine; that's the only thing I've <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> <b>that</b> thoroughly and completely pleases me. Come and see me next week, and I'll play it over to you.' ...|$|E
50|$|Parkin {{decided he}} wanted to leave in 1930, at the age of thirty-four, and he was put on the {{transfer}} list at £100.
