The Fox network's reasoning was that clip shows cost half of what a normal episode costs to produce, but they could sell syndication rights at full price.|$|E
5|$|In the 1250s, the {{fortunes}} of the Hospitallers at Krak des Chevaliers took a turn for the worse. A Muslim army estimated to number 10,000men ravaged the countryside around the castle in 1252 after which the Order's finances declined sharply. In 1268 Master Hugh Revel complained that the area, previously home to around 10,000people, now stood deserted and that the Order's property in the Kingdom of Jerusalem produced little income. He also noted that by this point there were only 300 of the Order's brethren left in the east. On the Muslim side, in 1260 Baibars became Sultan of Egypt, following his overthrow of the incumbent ruler Qutuz, and went on to unite Egypt and Syria. As a result, Muslim settlements that had previously paid tribute to the Hospitallers at Krak des Chevaliers no longer felt intimidated <b>into</b> <b>doing</b> so.|$|E

Having cleared her name in a congressional hearing, Alex is reinstated as an FBI agent and assigned to the field office in New York City, specifically the operations section, and now strives to uncover the true mastermind behind the bombings as the 2016 Presidential election draws ever closer. Prior to the election, the terrorist kills Natalie Vasquez and Drew Perales to force Alex <b>into</b> <b>doing</b> his bidding. At the end of season one, Liam is revealed to be the traitor, with Alex and Ryan killing him in the finale. After the bombings, the ensuing publicity, and Simon Asher's death, Alex is fired from the FBI. Two months after the presidential election, Alex is approached by Matthew Keyes (Henry Czerny), the director of the CIA, who extends an offer for her to join and work for the organization.|$|E
5|$|In The Tempest, Shakespeare {{presents}} {{two powerful}} sorcerers, Prospero and Sycorax, who have both controlled the island. Initially {{it appears that}} the two characters are a contrasting pair: the benevolent Prospero and the rapacious Sycorax. However, upon closer analysis, {{the differences between the two}} characters disappear and the similarities grow. For example, Prospero, like Sycorax, coerces Ariel <b>into</b> <b>doing</b> his bidding, using the sprite to regain his inheritance as a Duke, and tortures Caliban with magic the way Sycorax tortured Ariel. Also, both Prospero and Sycorax were exiled from their respective homelands and both have children, which was possibly the reason why they were both spared being executed. The fine line between Sycorax's black magic and Prospero's white blurs even further during his renunciation of magic in Act V, a speech which has strong parallels to one given by the dark witch Medea in the Metamorphoses. In comparing himself to Medea, Prospero is implicitly comparing himself to Sycorax. Emphasizing the relationship between Prospero and Sycorax demonstrates the ambiguity of Prospero's supposedly benevolent character.|$|E

Together with Ema, Phoenix traces the origins of the murder to an incident two years prior, in which a serial killer allegedly murdered Edgeworth's predecessor while trying to escape custody. Damon Gant, a senior police captain, is tricked into admitting that he framed Ema for the murder in order to manipulate Lana <b>into</b> <b>doing</b> his bidding. Though Lana is cleared of murder charges, she agrees to resign her post in order to face judgement for protecting Gant. With Ema being sent to Europe to continue training as a forensic investigator, Phoenix looks forward to continuing his career defending the innocent.|$|E
5|$|Paul, {{a member}} of his old unit, {{contacts}} him and reveals he is suffering similar terrifying experiences but is immediately killed when his car explodes. Jacob is dragged away from the wreckage by a bespectacled man. Commiserating after the funeral, the members of Jacob's old platoon confess that they have all been experiencing similarly horrifying hallucinations. Believing that they are suffering the effects of a military experiment performed on them without their knowledge or consent, the men hire a lawyer to investigate but he backs out of the case after reading military files documenting that the soldiers were never in combat and were discharged for psychological reasons. Jacob’s comrades soon apprehensively back down – Jacob angrily suspects they have been threatened <b>into</b> <b>doing</b> so. Jacob himself is later thrown into a car with intimidating men in suits who warn him against further investigation. He jumps from the moving car and is injured. He is taken to a hospital where he is restrained on a stretcher and wheeled down corridors full of grotesquely deformed patients before doctors, wielding barbaric metal instruments, inform him he is dead.|$|E
5|$|About a {{month before}} Minh's junta was overthrown, Khánh was {{approached}} {{by one of the}} principal tacticians in the removal of Diệm, General Đỗ Mậu. A colonel {{at the time of the}} previous coup, Mậu had been head of military security under Diệm. Although he did not explicitly command troops, Mậu had a thorough knowledge of the backgrounds of most of the senior ARVN officers and their strengths and weaknesses. This had allowed him to help engineer the previous coup. The MRC respected Mậu, but their fears about his shrewdness led them to place him in the relatively powerless post of Minister of Information. Mậu's closest aides were posted further away from any real power in an attempt to fragment his networks of influence. Mậu began to search for officers to replace the junta, searching for exiles in Cambodia and France as well as those who had returned to Vietnam after the overthrow of Diệm. The most important link in Mậu's plan was Colonel Nguyễn Chánh Thi, the former paratroop commander who had fled to Cambodia in the wake of the failed 1960 coup attempt against Diệm. Mậu persuaded the junta to install Thi as Khánh's deputy in I Corps. He tricked the junta <b>into</b> <b>doing</b> so by reasoning that as Khánh had largely been responsible for putting down the 1960 revolt, Thi would be an ideal mechanism for keeping Khánh in check, claiming that the two would be implacably opposed to one another. Privately, Mậu predicted that Thi would be a bridge between him in Saigon and Khánh in Huế. He was correct in thinking that the 1960 conflict would be irrelevant in the shifting of allegiances over time and that the pair would work together for their current aims of advancement. Mậu recruited a second figure in the form of General Trần Thiện Khiêm, who was one of Khánh's fellow cadets and had worked with Mậu during the November coup. Khiêm had assisted Diệm in putting down the 1960 plot and had since been demoted from being Chief of Staff of the ARVN to the commander of the III Corps that surrounded Saigon. Khiêm readily joined the plot and controlled the 5th and 7th Divisions of the ARVN, which were based in Biên Hòa and Mỹ Tho north and south of Saigon respectively. This brought the two division commanders subordinate to Khiêm into the plot, as long as they would obey his orders. Khiêm, Khánh and Mậu kept in touch surreptitiously on a regular basis, supplementing their forces with an assortment of Marine, Air Force and Special Forces officers. Another was General Dương Văn Đức, who had recently returned from exile in Paris and was an assistant to Kim, the chief of the junta's general staff. During this time, the plotters received encouragement from Harkins through their American advisers, something seen as crucial to the plot's increasing momentum.|$|E
