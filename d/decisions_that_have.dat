25|$|For civil matters, {{the repeal}} of section56A means that the Subordinate Courts Act no longer {{stipulates}} that constitutional questions must be referred to the High Court. However, this continues to be necessary in Magistrate's Court proceedings because these courts lack jurisdiction to deal with constitutional questions, as mentioned above. Assuming that declarations can be sought from District Courts, <b>decisions</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> been made by these courts may be appealed to the High Court and the Court of Appeal in the usual manner. Alternatively, a party apply to the High Court for the constitutional question {{to be heard in}} a separate action.|$|E

She {{temporarily}} joined forces with J. Howard's other son, James Howard Marshall III, whom the elder Howard had disowned. Howard III claimed that J. Howard Marshall had verbally promised him {{a portion of the}} estate; like Smith, Howard III was also left out of J. Howard's will. The case went on for more than a decade, producing a highly publicized court battle in Texas and several judicial <b>decisions</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> gone both for and against Smith in that time.|$|E
25|$|Both high RD and RI {{individuals}} {{are found to}} have difficulty in making <b>decisions</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> future consequences. Individuals high in RD experience greater reinforcement when initially engaging in the addictive behaviour, and experience stronger conditioned associations with continued use. Individuals high in RI experience greater difficulty resisting cravings {{even in the face}} of negative consequences. Some moderators of RD and RI on the severity of addiction are stress and negative affect (such as feeling depressed). That is, individuals high in RD/RI who also experience high levels of negative affect or stress, present more severe addictive behaviours. For example, if an individual is experiencing emotional distress, the distress experienced may lessen impulse control if they believe that engaging in addictive behaviour will decrease negative affect. According to this model, adolescents who are high in RI are at greater risk for developing addictions. Interestingly, low RI has been shown to moderate some of the risk of addiction due to family history. High RI for individual without a family history of addiction has been related to poor decision-making.|$|E

500|$|Much of the undoing of McCarthyism came at {{the hands}} of the Supreme Court.

[...] Two Eisenhower appointees to the court—Earl Warren (who was made Chief Justice) and William J.

500|$|Xenosaga Episode I is a {{role-playing}} video game; {{the player}} controls {{a party of}} characters that expands {{during the course of}} the game, navigating them through a variety of environments tied to the progression of the story. Gameplay segments are separated by story sequences, which are told mainly through traditional full-motion cutscenes. Exploring environments, the party can collect a variety of items, some of which can be used in gameplay to boost a character's statistics or restore health. During the course of the game, a database is unlocked that documents the game's story events and terminology. The player can access several mini-game [...] "plug-in" [...] systems through Shion's portable console, and an e-mail system that allows players to make playful <b>decisions</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> little significance to the main plot. The console can also be used to access to cleared areas of the game; these grant access to side quests separate from the main storyline.|$|E

2500|$|After {{a number}} of {{controversial}} refereeing <b>decisions</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> gone against Stoke, Pulis has advocated {{the introduction of a}} relegation system for referees to stop poor decisions.

[...] They then went on to beat Bolton 5–0, making Pulis the first manager to guide Stoke to an FA Cup Final. Stoke, however, lost the final 1–0 to Manchester City, with Yaya Touré scoring the only goal. By reaching the final, Stoke qualified for the 2011–12 UEFA Europa League, after Manchester City confirmed a place in the UEFA Champions League. Despite the defeat, club chairman Peter Coates believes that Pulis is Stoke's greatest ever manager.|$|E
