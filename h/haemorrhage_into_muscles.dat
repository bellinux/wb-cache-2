40|$|A hypercoagulable {{state has}} been {{demonstrated}} in human falciparum malaria in mild and complicated forms of the disease. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) was implicated by some authors, but deemed a rare occurrence by others. The possibility of coagulopathy in Babesia canis rossi infections in the canine patient has also been suggested in the literature, but minimal {{work has been done}} to evaluate the clinicopathological nature of it in further detail. In the canine babesiosis (CB) pathogenesis thought-process, DIC has been implicated. A DIC-like syndrome, as evidenced by intravascular fibrin deposition and <b>haemorrhage</b> <b>into</b> <b>muscles</b> and tissues was found at post mortem in one study. On the basis of these findings, it was postulated that DIC might be a serious complication of severe Babesia infection in the dog. Clinical DIC (haemorrhagic diathesis) is however seldom seen. It was also hypothesised in the literature that the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) demonstrated in the complicated form of Babesia was caused, in addition to tissue damage due to local hypoxia, by microthrombi {{as a result of a}} coagulopathy. This needs to be further investigated. Pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) has not been implicated in CB, however thromboemboli in the lungs were found in dogs with immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia (IMHA) for which a similar mechanism of venous stasis, hypercoagulability and endothelial damage (as found in CB) is proposed. In humans, PTE is believed to be a major underdiagnosed contributor to mortality in 5 to 15 % of hospitalised adults. If early diagnosis of PTE can be achieved, the mortality rate can certainly be decreased. A similar situation with resultant serious implications in complicated CB cases may exist. Clinically, PTE is suspected if a patient with a known prothrombotic condition develops sudden dyspnoea and tachypnoea. These clinical symptoms are frequently seen in complicated CB patients and may, in addition to being a compensatory mechanism for the metabolic acidosis and anaemia, be attributed to thrombus-induced mechanical changes in lung function. Pulmonary scintigraphy provides a sensitive means of diagnosing PTE. It was (and some authors still do) believed that a ventilation scintigraphic scan should be done in association with a perfusion scan to increase the specificity and accuracy of diagnoses. However, authors of the recent PISA-PED study in humans proposed that the sensitivity and specificity of a perfusion scan, without a ventilation scan, in patients with suspected PTE was sufficient. The incidence of PTE or the use of pulmonary perfusion scintigraphy in CB dogs has never been studied. The objective of this study was to prospectively evaluate the scintigraphic pulmonary perfusion pattern in hospitalised Babesia dogs in an attempt to ascertain whether a scintigraphic pattern consistent with PTE does indeed occur in these patients. The study consisted of a normal control group of nine mature healthy Beagle dogs aged 36 – 43 months and weighing 9. 9 – 15 kg and a Babesia group with 14 dogs of a variety of breeds that were naturally infected with Babesia, aged 6 – 103 months and weighing 6. 3 – 25. 5 kg. Pulmonary perfusion scintigraphy was performed after making thoracic radiographs and performing a blood gas analysis in both groups. The scintigraphic images were visually inspected for changes suggestive of PTE. Surprisingly, not a single dog in the Babesia group had segmental or wedge-shaped perfusion defects which would have resulted in a high probability for PTE. The scintigraphic pulmonary perfusion pattern demonstrated was not significantly different between the two groups (p = 1. 00). Many dogs in both groups had a mottled appearance on the right and left dorsal oblique images, which was not believed to be consistent with clinically relevant PTE. This study provides baseline data that may be used to further investigate the pulmonary perfusion pattern in Babesia dogs.

40|$|Objective: Two {{adult males}} are {{reported}} whose deaths occurred 19 h and five days, respectively, after blunt craniocervical injury. In case 1, although interstitial haemorrhage {{was present in}} four samples of bruised paravertebral muscle, only one sample had an early acute inflammatory cell infiltrate. In case 2 microscopic examination of two bruises showed <b>haemorrhage</b> <b>into</b> <b>muscle</b> and adipose tissue, again with no significant inflammatory reaction and only occasional haemosiderin-containing macrophages. These cases demonstrate considerable variability in histological response to blunt trauma in human tissues and suggest that samples taken from areas of extravasated blood in a bruise may not manifest the type of vital reaction that occurs in areas {{where there has been}} direct tissue damage. As the presence and/or degree of inflammation may be influenced by the site of tissue sampling, interpretations of the age of a bruise based on histologic reaction should, therefore, be undertaken with caution.

40|$|Congenital {{fibrinogen}} {{disorders are}} caused by mutations {{in one of the}} three fibrinogen genes that affect the synthesis, assembly, intracellular processing, stability or secretion of fibrinogen. Functional studies of mutant Bβ-chains revealed the importance of individual residues as well as three-dimensional structures for fibrinogen assembly and secretion. This study describes two novel homozygous fibrinogen Bβ chain mutations in two Slovak families with afibrinogenemia and hypofibrinogenemia. Peripheral blood samples were collected from all subjects with the aim of identifying the causative mutation. Coagulation-related tests and rotational thromboelastometry were performed. All exons and exon–intron boundaries of the fibrinogen genes (FGA, FGB and FGG) were amplified by PCR followed by direct sequencing. Sequence analysis of the three fibrinogen genes allowed us to identify two novel homozygous mutations in the FGB gene. A novel Bβ chain truncation (BβGln 180 Stop) was detected in a 28 -year-old afibrinogenemic man with bleeding episodes including repeated <b>haemorrhaging</b> <b>into</b> <b>muscles,</b> joints, and soft tissues, and mucocutaneous bleeding and a novel Bβ missense mutation (BβTyr 368 His) was found in a 62 -year-old hypofibrinogenemic man with recurrent deep and superficial venous thromboses of the lower extremities. The novel missense mutation was confirmed by molecular modelling. Both studying the molecular anomalies and the modelling of fibrinogenic mutants help us to understand the extremely complex machinery of fibrinogen biosynthesis and finally better assess its correlation with the patient’s clinical course...|$|R

40|$|Scurvy is the {{nutritional}} deficiency state associated with lowered levels of ascorbic acid (vitamin C). Lack of ascorbic acid leads to suppression of collagen synthesis and {{the synthesis of}} defective collagen among other metabolic derangements. Weakening of vascular walls results in signs and symptoms mimicking other diseases such as bleeding diatheses and deep vein thrombosis. Scurvy is rarely encountered in Western countries {{where there is a}} broad community understanding of the importance of nutritional requirements and where foods containing ascorbic acid are readily available. As a result of these factors early diagnosis may be hampered where it is not considered in the differential diagnosis, and consequently, prolonged suffering of the patient. Scurvy is easily treated with high doses of oral ascorbic acid, although recurrences may occur. Education of health care providers in recognizing the signs and symptoms of scurvy therefore cannot be over emphasized, particularly in societies in which nutritional deficiencies are considered uncommon. A case of scurvy presenting primarily with oral manifestations is reported here. Key words: Ascorbic acid, case report, gingivitis, oral medicine, scurvy, vitamin C.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Spontaneous <b>haemorrhage</b> <b>into</b> a {{parathyroid}} adenoma is a {{rare and}} potentially life-threatening presentation. CASE PRESENTATION: We report {{the case of a}} 45 year old female recently diagnosed with primary hyperparathyroidism who presented with chest discomfort and acute airway compromise due to spontaneous extracapsular <b>haemorrhage</b> <b>into</b> a parathyroid adenoma. Computed tomography (CT) imaging showed a hypopharyngeal haematoma extending 10 cm into the superior mediastinum. Surgical decompression of the cyst followed by enbloc resection of the parathyroid tumour was performed after elective intubation. Calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels had fallen prior to surgery and remain normal post-operatively. CONCLUSION: Spontaneous parathyroid haemorrhage should be considered in any patient with unexplained spontaneous cervical haemorrhage, particularly if there is a history of hyperparathyroidism.

40|$|The {{epidemics}} we have observed, {{were due}} to the presence and growth in the frogs of Bacillus hydrophilus fuscus. This was proved by recovering the bacillus in pure culture from the body fluids of frogs sick or dead of the disease, and the inoculation of healthy frogs with an emulsion of the pure culture, and by obtaining the same clinical picture and pathological findings as in the original diseased frogs; and, finally, by recovering the bacillus in pure culture from frogs inoculated and sick or dying {{as a result of}} the inoculation. The disease is widely distributed throughout North America and Europe, and in this country and Canada is known as "red-leg. " It has been observed by us chiefly in the warm weather of September and October. The disease is characterized by congestion of the ventral surfaces of the body, with more or less ulceration in, and hæmorrhage beneath, the skin, bloating due to serous exudation into the lymph sacs, gradual failure to respond to stimuli, which symptoms are followed by coma and death, the last being occasionally preceded by tetanic seizures. After death <b>hæmorrhages</b> <b>into</b> the <b>muscles</b> and degenerative changes in the muscles, spleen, liver, and, to a slight degree, in the intestinal tract, are found. The blood shows an advanced degree of anæmia and leucocytosis. Predisposing causes of the disease are lesions of the skin, which seem to be the usual portal of entry of the infection, and lowered resistance from heat and from anæmia. By a series of controlled experiments with inoculated frogs we have shown that, while temperatures a little above freezing have no harmful effect upon the frogs, they completely control all manifestations of the disease in inoculated or diseased frogs, if the frogs are left in the cold for a period as long as seven days; and, further, that even short periods in the cold chamber will bring about a delay of the fatal results in diseased or inoculated frogs. The anæmia so often found in apparently healthy frogs seems in many cases to be due to the presence in the lungs of the frog of a parasite, the Distomum cylindraceum, which, occurring in sufficiently large numbers in an individual frog, is capable of materially diminishing the available supply of red corpuscles. Severe laking of the blood, the presence of numerous isolated red-cell nuclei, and great diminution in the number, or almost total absence of the red cells in the diseased frogs, are in proportion to the severity of the infection and due to bacterial action. The presence of the hæmatozoan parasite, the Drepanidium, does not play any part as a predisposing or exciting cause of the disease. The ascarid Rhabdomena nigrovenosum, although frequently present as a parasite in the lungs of the frogs, plays no part in causing or promoting the disease...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{highlight}} the clinical presentation, investigation {{and treatment of}} <b>haemorrhage</b> <b>into</b> the pancreatic duct. DESIGN: Retrospective study and review of publications. SETTING: University hospital, Switzerland. SUBJECTS: All 4 cases from 1972 to 1993.
