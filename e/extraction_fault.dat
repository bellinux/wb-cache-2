It is shown that the observed DL(T) curve can be accurately modeled using non equally probable, realistic faults predicted from defect statistics data and IC layout. The deviation of DL(T) from the one estimated by the Williams-Brown equation is shown to be caused by two effects. First, the topology of the most likely realistic faults determine their susceptibility, which is typically lower than the stuck-at fault susceptibility. Second, the incompleteness of a given test set and the detection technique (such as static voltage testing) determine a non 100 % defect coverage.

40|$|Objectives: To {{validate}} and accredit a set {{of three}} multiplex endpoint PCR assays, targeting the most important carbapenemase and minor extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) resistance genes, {{according to the international}} ISO 15189 particular requirements for the quality and competence of medical laboratories. Methods: Specific primers targeting ESBLs and carbapenemases were collected from the literature or designed internally. The multiplex PCRs were validated for sensitivity, specificity, intra- and inter-run reproducibility and accuracy by means of external quality control (EQC) using a collection of 137 characterized and referenced isolates. For each multiplex PCR assay, the presence of an extraction control ruled out false-negative results due to PCR inhibition or <b>extraction</b> <b>faults.</b> Amplicons were separated by capillary electrophoresis (QIAxcel system, Qiagen). The protocols and validation files were reviewed in the setting of an external audit conducted by the Belgian organization for accreditation (BELAC). Results: Sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility for each targeted gene were 100 %. All isolates from the three EQC panels were correctly identified by each PCR assay (accuracy 100 %). The validation files were controlled by BELAC, and the PCR protocols were accepted as accredited according to ISO 15189. Conclusions: Three home-made multiplex PCRs targeting the major carbapenemases and four minor class A ESBL genes encountered in Gram-negative bacteria were accredited according to the ISO 15189 standards. This validation scheme could provide a useful model for laboratories aiming to accredit their own protocols. © The Author 2013.
