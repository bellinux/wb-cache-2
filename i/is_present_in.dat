5|$|Salt <b>is</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> most foods, but in {{naturally}} occurring foodstuffs such as meats, vegetables and fruit, it <b>is</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> very small quantities. It is often added to processed foods (such as canned foods and especially salted foods, pickled foods, and snack foods or other convenience foods), where it functions {{as both a}} preservative and a flavoring. Dairy salt {{is used in the}} preparation of butter and cheese products. Before the advent of electrically powered refrigeration, salting {{was one of the main}} methods of food preservation. Thus, herring contains 67mg sodium per 100g, while kipper, its preserved form, contains 990mg. Similarly, pork typically contains 63mg while bacon contains 1,480mg, and potatoes contain 7mg but potato crisps 800mg per 100 g. The main sources of salt in the diet, apart from direct use of sodium chloride, are bread and cereal products, meat products and milk and dairy products.|$|E
