50|$|While Shull’s {{focus on}} modern-style homes set her {{apart from other}} designer/builders, she was {{certainly}} not alone. Notable architects such as Ludwig Mies Van Der Rohe and Joseph Eichler lead the way, influencing the work of others. Shull's designs shared some similarities with Eichler's California Contemporary homes: post-and-beam construction, which allowed for expansive, floor-to-ceiling windows and sliding glass doors; vertical siding; and decorative <b>escutcheon</b> <b>plates</b> on exterior doors. Shull's concept for a modern home design combined streamlined interiors with casual living spaces outdoors. Her interior sketches showed modern, informal living areas with easy-to-maintain furnishings.|$|R

The stairs have turned balusters and substantial newel posts with chamfered rectangular tops. On the first floor, the former residence partition walls have been removed, however the remaining large space retains its timber lined ceilings, a single fretwork ceiling ventilator panel, a former kitchen fireplace, and a fireplace in the south eastern corner with fine timber panelling and ceramic tiled surrounds.

50|$|The Robert Roe Blacker House, often {{referred}} to as the Blacker House or Robert R. Blacker House, is a residence in Pasadena, California, which is now on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. It was built in 1907 for Robert Roe Blacker and Nellie Canfield Blacker. It was designed by Henry and Charles Greene of the renowned Pasadena firm of Greene and Greene. This house was a lavish project for the Greene brothers, costing in excess of US$100,000.00 ($ today). Everything for the house was custom designed, down to the teak <b>escutcheon</b> <b>plates</b> of the upstairs mahogany panel doors to the linen closets with their ebony cloud adorned keys.|$|R
5000|$|The temple {{incorporates}} {{a variety of}} symbolic elements that evoke basic doctrinal beliefs of the LDS Church concerning Jesus Christ and his teachings as understood by Latter-day Saints, as well as symbols important within the local community. Manhattan temple design motifs include [...] "living waters," [...] beehives, olives and olive trees, grapevines, starbursts, and the Statue of Liberty. Even the furniture upholstery tacks incorporate specific symbolic elements (e.g., crowns, stars, beehives, etc.). Carved into the medium-stain oak wood panels and molding are beehives, while door handle <b>escutcheon</b> <b>plates</b> incorporate the Statue of Liberty torch together with fig or grape leaves and stars. Curved archways above ordinance room doors and mirrors contain design elements specifically adapted from the Salt Lake Temple.|$|R
5000|$|The {{traditional}} {{door knob}} has a bolt or spindle running through it that sits just above a cylinder, {{to which the}} spindle is connected. Turning the knob pulls the cylinder {{in the direction of}} the turn. The end of the cylinder is the [...] "latch bolt" [...] (more simply known as the [...] "latch"), which protrudes into a space carved out of the door frame, and which prevents the door from being opened if the knob is not turned. A spring or similar mechanism causes the latch to return to its protruding state whenever the knob is not being turned. <b>escutcheon</b> <b>plates</b> are the keyhole covers, usually circular, through which keys pass to enter the lock body. If the door handles have a square or rectangular plate on which the handle is mounted this is called the backplate. The backplate can be plain (for use with latches), pierced for keyholes (for use with locks), or pierced and fitted with turn knobs and releases (for use with bathroom locks). The plate on the front edge of the lock where the latch bolt protrudes is called the faceplate.|$|R

All three include, as its central element, the traditional Portuguese shield placed over an armillary sphere or.

50|$|Leaving {{employment}} with Western Electric Company in 1920, Schlage {{opened a}} shop in San Francisco in the present-day financial district. The Schlage Lock Company was incorporated with a starting capital of $30. In the same year, {{he applied for}} a patent for a lock that could be drilled into a door with only two holes. This new cylindrical lock had a single plate, serving as both <b>escutcheon</b> and striker <b>plate,</b> wrapping around the door's edge. It was mostly used on interior doors, where it replaced the older Mortise lock.|$|R
50|$|A lockset (alternatively lock set) is the {{hardware}} and components {{that make up}} the locking or latching mechanism that can usually be found on a door or other hinged object but can also include sliding doors and dividers.The components of a lockset can include (but are not limited to) the door handles (commonly both inside and outside), latchbolt, dead bolt, face <b>plate,</b> strike <b>plate,</b> <b>escutcheon,</b> thumbturn, push button, turn button, and other trim. The lockset and associated hardware typically defines a door's function and how a user could (or could not) access the two adjacent spaces defined by the opening associated with the lockset.|$|R
5000|$|The initial shield {{evolved to}} a field argent with five {{escutcheons}} azur forming a cross, the dexter and sinister ones pointing to the center, with each <b>escutcheon</b> semée of <b>plates.</b> This is the first confirmed model of Portuguese shield in use. Apparently, it was introduced still in the reign of Afonso Henriques (Afonso I) and definitely {{was used in the}} reign of Portugal's following King Sancho I (1185-1211). There are several legends that explain the origin of the five escutcheons and of the <b>plates.</b> The <b>escutcheons</b> are said that they represent either the five wounds of Christ in the Cross, the five wounds suffered by Afonso Henriques in the Battle of Ourique or the five moor kings defeated by him in this same battle. Regarding the plates, it is said that either they represent the pieces of silver received by Judas Iscariot to betray Jesus or the sovereignty of the Portuguese Kings symbolized by the right to issue their own money. A more mundane theory explains the origin of this shield in the original material shield of Afonso Henriques, which included a cross made by two blue leather bands nailed to a white field and which, after being successively hit in battle, had these bands ripped off, except the five pieces more close to the clusters of nails. These five pieces of blue leather and the heads of the nails, being so allegedly the origin of the five escutcheons azur, each semée of plates.|$|R
5000|$|The Portuguese shield {{itself is}} the result of about 300 years of evolution, from the 12th to the 15th centuries. The {{putative}} initial shield used by Afonso Henriques, who became the first King of Portugal, was field argent with a cross azur. This evolved to a field argent with five escutcheons azur forming a cross, the dexter and sinister ones pointing to the center, with each <b>escutcheon</b> semée of <b>plates.</b> When Afonso III became King in 1247, he maintained the shield he used as brother of King Sancho II: the then Portuguese shield added with a bordure gules semée of castles or. When the master of the Order of Aviz became King in 1385, as John I, the cross of the order (cross vert with fleur-de-lis in its points) was inserted in the shield, with its points appearing in the bordure gules, between the castles or. Later, the semée of plates of each of the five escutcheons gradually evolved to fixed five plates disposed in saltire and, because of this, each of these escutcheons started to be known as quina (the face [...] "five" [...] of a dice). By synecdoche, the Portuguese shield started to be referred as the five quinas or simply as the quinas. Finally, in 1481, King John II ordered the correction of the Portuguese shield, eliminating its features identified as heraldic errors. So, the cross of the Order of Aviz was taken off and the dexter and sinister escutcheons were set upright. Later the semée of castles or of the bordure evolved to seven fixed castles, this being the version in use today.|$|R
