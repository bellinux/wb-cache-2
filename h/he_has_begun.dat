As his career has progressed, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>begun</b> to incorporate a more attacking approach to his play, which {{has resulted in a}} greater number of goals and assists, and his six goals from midfield made him Manchester City's leading scorer in the 2006–07 season, ahead of strikers Georgios Samaras, Bernardo Corradi, Émile Mpenza and Darius Vassell.|$|E
5|$|Modi led the BJP in the 2014 general election, {{which gave}} the party a {{majority}} in the Lok Sabha, the first time a single party had achieved this since 1984. Modi himself was elected to parliament from Varanasi. Since taking office, Modi's administration has tried to raise foreign direct investment in the Indian economy, increased spending on infrastructure, and reduced spending on healthcare and social welfare programmes. Modi has attempted to improve efficiency in the bureaucracy, and centralised power through the abolition of the planning commission. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>begun</b> a high-profile sanitation campaign, and weakened or abolished environmental and labour laws. Credited with engineering a political realignment towards right-wing politics, Modi remains a figure of controversy domestically and internationally over his Hindu nationalist beliefs and his role during the 2002 Gujarat riots, cited as evidence of an exclusionary social agenda.|$|E

25|$|After issuing the {{challenge}} to McKinney, Joe begins to find himself becoming very popular around the office for his bravery. Meg and Natalie, however, do not feel fighting McKinney will solve anything, and both attempt to tell Joe as much, to no avail. Joe seeks out the aid of an ex B movie star-turned-martial arts instructor named Chuck Scarett (Jim Belushi) to teach him to defend himself. Things seem to finally be going right for Joe, as <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>begun</b> to see Meg and has even been given a promotion at work he had been hoping for. When Meg realizes Jeremy (Greg Germann), a colleague she works closely with for the company (who {{also happens to be}} attracted to her), only gave Joe a non-existing position at the office to prevent him from suing the company, she resigns in fear that she might one day have to demote or even fire Joe. Meg again tries to persuade Joe not to fight McKinney, and finally gives him an ultimatum: if he does not call off the fight with McKinney, their relationship is over.|$|E

500|$|Ben Krohn Hawkins is {{the protagonist}} in Carnivàle. He begins {{the story as}} a young Oklahoma farmer and chain gang {{fugitive}} who is {{picked up by a}} traveling carnival when his mother dies. Ben has displayed inexplicable healing powers since childhood, and with the beginning of the series, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>begun</b> to suffer dreams and visions of people unknown to him. As Ben learns from staying with the carnival, he seems to be related to Henry Scudder, a man who once worked at the carnival. He also learns that his powers come with a price [...] to give life, he must take life; to raise the dead, he has to deliberately kill someone else. When the beginning of season two makes the mysterious happenings in the carnival clearer, Ben is told to find the preacher of his dreams to prevent an unfolding chain of catastrophic events. Henry Scudder, at this point revealed to be Ben's father, allegedly knows the preacher's name, and after a number of near misses and harrowing encounters, Ben is able to bring Scudder before the carnival's Management.

500|$|Jillian Bowe of Zap2it was {{surprised}} by the decision to age both Fenmore and Summer Newman (Hunter King) at the same time. Omar White-Nobles of TVSource wrote, [...] "Don't they grow up fast?", referring to soap opera rapid aging syndrome.

Roger Newcomb of the website We Love Soaps wondered if the character would [...] "have issues with his parents the way other aged kids on the show have of late". [...] Fairman later stated of Ehrich's portrayal: [...] "Recently, the powers-that-be at Y chose to age Lauren and Michael’s tot of a son, Fenmore, to a teenager (another victim of Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome) and with that comes new complex problems for the Baldwins, and as it appears “Fen” may be a chip off the old block ... sort to speak.

Luke Kerr, also of Zap2it, wrote that he [...] "really likes" [...] Ehrich as Fenmore, stating: [...] "He has totally mastered the Baldwin/Fisher crazy behind-the-eyes element of early Michael and Kevin (Greg Rikaart)." [...] Jamey Giddens also wrote of the character's family storyline, saying: [...] "A father hellbent on preventing his son from going down the same unspeakable path he once traveled; a mother who refuses to believe her child could be guilty of the heinous crime he's being accused of committing.

2500|$|In 1997 visual poets Tim Gaze and Jim Leftwich first {{applied the}} word asemic to name their quasi-calligraphic writing gestures. They {{then began to}} {{distribute}} them to poetry magazines both online and in print. The authors explored sub-verbal and sub-letteral forms of writing, and textual asemia as a creative option and as an intentional practice. Since the late 1990s, asemic writing has blossomed into a worldwide literary/art movement. It has especially grown {{in the early part}} of the 21st century, though there is an acknowledgement of a long and complex history, which precedes the activities of the current asemic movement, especially with regards to abstract calligraphy, wordless writing, and verbal writing damaged beyond the point of legibility. Jim Leftwich has recently stated that an asemic condition of an asemic work is an impossible goal, and that it is not possible to create an art/literary work entirely without meaning. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>begun</b> to use the term [...] "pansemic" [...] to describe this type of work.
