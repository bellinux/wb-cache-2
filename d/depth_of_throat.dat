50|$|There are 5 {{pieces to}} each Fillet weld {{known as the}} Root, Toe, Face, Leg and <b>Throat.</b> The root <b>of</b> the weld {{is the part of}} deepest {{penetration}} which is the opposite angle of the Hypotenuse. The toes of the weld are essentially the edges or the points of the hypotenuse. The face of the weld is the outer visual or hypotenuse that you see when looking at a fillet weld. The legs are the opposite and adjacent sides to the triangular fillet weld. The leg length is usually designated as the size of the weld. The <b>throat</b> <b>of</b> the weld is the distance {{from the center of the}} face to the root of the weld. Typically the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>throat</b> should be at least as thick as the thickness of metal you are welding.|$|R
40|$|UnrestrictedIn this thesis, {{we discuss}} the {{possibility}} of exploring the statistical mechanics description {{of a black hole}} from the point view of supergravity. Specifically, we study five dimensional microstate geometries of a black hole or black ring. At first, we review the method to find the general three-charge BPS supergravity solutions proposed by Bena and Warner. By applying this method, we show the classical merger of a black ring and black hole in general are irreversible. On the other hand, we review the solutions on ambi-polar Gibbons-Hawking (GH) base which are bubbled geometries. There are many possible microstate geometries among the bubbled geometries. Particularly, we show that a generic blob of GH points that satisfy certain conditions can be either a microstate geometry of a black hole or black ring without horizon. Furthermore, using the result of the entropy analysis in classical merger as a guide, we show that one can have a merger of a black-hole blob and a black-ring blob or two black-ring blobs that corresponds to a classical irreversible merger. From the irreversible mergers, we find the scaling solutions and deep microstates which are microstate geometries of a black hole/ring with macroscopic horizon.; These solutions have the same AdS throats as classical black holes/rings but instead <b>of</b> having infinite <b>throats,</b> the throat is smoothly capped off at a very large depth with some local structure at the bottom. For solutions that produced from U(1) times U(1) invariant merger, the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>throat</b> is limited by the flux quantization. The mass gap is related with the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> this <b>throat</b> and we show the mass gap of these solutions roughly match with the mass gap of the typical conformal-field-theory (CFT) states. Therefore, based on AdS/CFT correspondence, they can be dual geometries of the typical CFT states that contribute to the entropy of a black hole/ring. On the other hand, we show that for the solutions produced from more general merger (without U(1) times U(1) invariance) the throat can be arbitrarily deep. This presents a puzzle from the point view of AdS/CFT correspondence. We propose that this puzzle may be solved by some quantization of the angle or promoting the flux vectors to quantum spins. Finally, we suggest some future directions of further study including the puzzle of arbitrary long AdS throat and a general coarse-graining picture of microstate geometries...|$|R
40|$|Published in : ISH Journal of Hydraulic Engineering, Vol. 21, No. 1, 65 – 84 In this paper, two multi-variable {{regression}} {{models have been}} developed to predict the discharge and approach velocity coefficients from relevant independent variables. The {{regression models}} are developed based on relevant experimental data obtained from testing nine different flow measurement long-throated flumes with symmetrical rectangular compound cross-sections. The long-throated flume was used in the compound cross-section to experimentally estimate the discharge and approach velocity coefficients using mainly head measurements and cross-section dimensions as required by the stage-discharge equations. The independent variables used in predicting the two coefficients represent dimensionless parameters defined using the gauged head at the head measurement section, floodplain <b>depth,</b> length <b>of</b> <b>throat</b> in the direction of flow, and cross-section geometry at the control section. Several statistically-based analyses were performed to verify the reliability of the developed multi-variable regression models. All deployed analyses have indicated that the two regression models are associated with high predictive strength. Therefore, the main contribution of this paper is the development of regression-based models to predict the discharge and approach velocity coefficients {{that can be used in}} conjunction with stage-discharge equations to estimate the flow in a symmetric rectangular channel with compound cross-section...|$|R

Enemy though the beast was, he was less an enemy to the ape-man than those blacks who had trapped him, for though Tarzan of the Apes claimed many fast and loyal friends among certain tribes of African natives, there were others of degraded character and bestial habits that he looked upon with utter loathing, and of such were the human flesh-eaters of Numabo the chief. For a moment Numa, the lion, glared ferociously at the naked man-thing upon the tree limb above him. Steadily those yellow-green eyes bored into the clear eyes of the ape-man, and then the sensitive nostrils caught {{the scent of the}} fresh blood of Bara and the eyes moved to the carcass lying across the brown shoulder, and there came from the cavernous <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> the savage <b>throat</b> a low whine.|$|R

30|$|Four typical {{types of}} {{residual}} oil, residual oil trapped in dead ends, oil ganglia in pore throats, oil at pore corners and oil film adhered to pore walls, were studied. According to main pore structure characteristics and the fundamental morphological features of residual oil, four displacement models for residual oil were proposed, in which pore-scale flow behavior of viscoelastic fluid was analyzed by a numerical method and micro-mechanisms for mobilization of residual oil were discussed. Calculated {{results indicate that}} the viscoelastic effect enhances micro displacement efficiency and increases swept volume. For residual oil trapped in dead ends, the flow field of viscoelastic fluid is developed in dead ends more deeply, resulting in more contact with oil by the displacing fluid, and consequently increasing swept volume. In addition, intense viscoelastic vortex has great stress, under which residual oil becomes small oil ganglia, and finally be carried into main channels. For residual oil at pore throats, its displacement mechanisms are similar to the oil trapped in dead ends. Vortices are developed in the <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> the <b>throats</b> and oil ganglia become smaller. Besides, viscoelastic fluid causes higher pressure drop on oil ganglia, as a driving force, which can overcome capillary force, consequently, flow direction can be changed and the displacing fluid enter smaller throats. For oil at pore corners, viscoelastic fluid can enhance displacement efficiency as a result of greater velocity and stress near the corners. For residual oil adhered to pore wall, viscoelastic fluid can provide a greater displacing force on the interface between viscoelastic fluid and oil, thus, making it easier to exceed the minimum interfacial tension for mobilizing the oil film.|$|R
