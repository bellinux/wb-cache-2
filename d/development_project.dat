40|$|ABSTRACT The {{purpose of}} this study was to have a fresh look at the local {{governance}} status through exploring governance factors affecting community participation in public <b>development</b> <b>projects.</b> The study also has investigated the actors and factors shaping participation as well as causes for non-participation. For the purpose of the study six wards within two divisions of Poli and Mbuguni and Meru district headquarters were selected. In the wards a total of 80 respondents from among the community members were interviewed through a structured questionnaire. Others were Village chairman Village Executive Officers Ward Executive Officers and Councilors were also interviewed and involved in the FGD. Data were analyzed using SPSS. Simple descriptive statistics and cross tabulation and figures were used in the analysis. The analysis showed that the communities were participated in the public <b>development</b> <b>projects</b> and people were participating through financial material and labor contribution to the public <b>development</b> <b>projects.</b> The analysis also showed that the government supported the ongoing public <b>development</b> <b>projects</b> including through provision of fund and expertise. The study showed the benefit of community participation in the <b>development</b> <b>projects</b> or programs like ownership of the projects and enjoying the benefits accrued from the projects. The study also indicated that there is significant change in terms of governance as influencers of community participation in public <b>development</b> <b>projects.</b> Despite the fortunes study showed some challenges found in wards and villages being the incidence of corruptions and misuse of public resources which were mentioned to slow community participation in public <b>development</b> <b>projects.</b> It was therefore concluded that adhering to the good governance principles contribute positively towards community participation in public <b>development</b> <b>projects...</b>|$|R

5|$|CenturyLink Field is {{bordered by}} the {{junction}} of Interstates 5 and 90 {{to the east and}} State Route 99 to its west. The State Route 519 corridor connects I-90 to the neighborhood. Local governments compromised with both the Seahawks and Mariners on the location of new ramps over the train tracks that run along the east sides of CenturyLink and Safeco Fields. An overpass for S Royal Brougham Way, the road that borders the south edge of the CenturyLink Field complex, to improve access and safety was completed in May 2010. The stadium has 2,000 parking spaces in its parking garage and 8,400 in the surrounding lots to accommodate automobile traffic. Beginning in December 2011, construction of the Stadium Place mixed-use <b>development</b> <b>project</b> replaced much of the north lot.

5|$|In 1953, the US Secretary of Defense, Charles E. Wilson, {{raised the}} {{possibility}} of a joint ballistic missile programme with the Minister of Supply, Duncan Sandys. This resulted in an agreement on collaboration being signed on 12 August 1954, and a British Medium Range Ballistic Missile (MRBM) <b>development</b> <b>project</b> codenamed Blue Streak. The United States pursued Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile (IRBM) development in parallel. Indeed, it had two IRBM projects: the US Army's Jupiter and the USAF's Thor. When Sandys, now the Minister of Defence, visited the United States in January 1957, he found the Americans anxious to deploy IRBMs in Britain. Macmillan and Eisenhower agreed to do so during their summit in Bermuda in March 1957, and a formal agreement was drawn up on 17 December 1957, although {{it was not until the}} end of the month that it was definitely determined that Britain would receive Thor and not Jupiter missiles.

40|$|Since the mid 1970 s {{there has}} been an {{increasing}} effort to adopt community participation as a necessary instrument for people driven development. NGOs and governments have come to use this participatory approach not only to empower local people, but also to give them a platform to plan and implement their own <b>development</b> <b>projects.</b> However in Zimbabwe, the government has failed to fund most projects and it has created a gap for NGOs to provide most, if not all services in rural communities. NGOs have been seen as better institutions to facilitate <b>development</b> <b>projects</b> and to engage local people to actively participate in development issues. Community participation is a central component in <b>development</b> <b>projects</b> as the projects respond to the people’s needs and that local people are in full control and ownership of these projects. This study is an assessment of community participation in NGO <b>development</b> <b>projects</b> in Zimbabwe. The study investigates the extent of community participation in <b>development</b> <b>projects</b> and it is guided by the Participatory Development (PD) theory. Research findings reveal that community participation is minimal in <b>development</b> <b>projects</b> of Bulilima and Mangwe districts in Zimbabwe. Local people are just passive participants of the <b>development</b> <b>projects</b> who are told what to do. The local people’s contributions and influences are sidelined in the planning and decision-making processes; instead these are made by the rural elite who plan and make decisions on behalf of the local people. It is the view of this study that the purpose of community participation is to create opportunities for local people to participate in planning, decision making, implementation, allocation and distribution of resources. The <b>development</b> <b>projects</b> should be responsive to the people’s needs. Similarly, participatory development just like community participation is a process whereby communities are given the opportunity to determine their future in terms of their needs and resources. In this regard, it is relevant that rural communities actively participate in planning, decision making, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of <b>development</b> <b>projects.</b> By so doing, the projects become not only successful but also sustainable...|$|R
