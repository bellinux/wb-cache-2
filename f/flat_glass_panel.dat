D. research currently carried out at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU), which investigates the possibilities to design and build a shell structure from <b>flat</b> <b>glass</b> <b>panels.</b> The structure is a so-called plate (facetted) structure, which is a relatively unknown, though very efficient structure type. By combining this structural typology with laminated float glass, a very transparent structure becomes possible. Since smooth shell structures are prone to buckling, {{it is very important}} to assess the behaviour of the glass facetted structure in this respect. During the research different aspects that are important for {{the stability of}} the structure have been investigated using a finite element model. Important was for instance the sensitivity of the structure to imperfections. Furthermore, the influence of the stiffness of the joints between the glass facets turns out to play an important role in the behaviour of the structure. Especially the normal stiffness (k_n) is vital, while the bending stiffness (k_m) is less important. Other aspects that have been considered are the robustness of the structure and the influence of the stiffness of the panels. The research has shown that the structural system and its combination with laminated float glass looks very promising. Design and ConstructionCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

The model allows for derivation of the load-deflection response of square or rectangular multilayered <b>glass</b> <b>panels</b> subject to uniform loads.

40|$|Can {{creative}} material translation reshape artistic appropriation {{to escape}} the cycle of mimicry and mockery linked to contemporary visual art practice? To explore creativity in material translation, my project has been divided into three case studies, each translating a different pattern, from a different context and material, into my chosen pattern-making language of glass murrine. In the first case study I translate a Moorish plasterwork pattern from the Alhambra, in Granada, Spain. This pattern has been copied before: a translation of fidelity printed by Owen Jones in his publication The Grammar of Ornament, 1856. 1 Jones’ pattern and my patterns {{will be used to}} examine fidelity and infidelity in material translation. In the second case study I translate Paisley, a Kashmiri textile pattern appropriated and adapted by western manufacturers in the 19 th-century. Paisley's history of adaptation will be examined in relation to my translation, to compare the two methods {{in the context of a}} single decorative idiom. In the third case study, I translate a stamp- printed furnishing textile pattern designed by Bernard Adeney in the 1930 s. This translation will be an isolated interaction between two makers, a similar position to the critique of contemporary visual appropriation, allowing for a comparison between infidelity and appropriation. Murrine has been chosen as my material language because of its ability to create patterns with colour, depth and unlimited variation. The murrine technique involves the heating up and stretching of canes or sheets of coloured glass, arranged in designs that become very small when elongated. These stretched lengths are then cut in cross-section to form mosaic tiles. Developed by the Greeks and Egyptians, the murrine technique has been under constant development for the last 2000 years. I have further refined the technique, incorporating new methods such as waterjet cutting. I have made final artworks from each set of murrine in the format of <b>flat</b> <b>glass</b> <b>panels,</b> each exploring its pattern in a unique way. An examination of each artwork, its process of translation – including drawings, computer models, photomontage and other designing methods – and its material and contextual change will forge the link between making and writing in this project. My original contribution to knowledge is the exploration of a practical act of visual translation, analysing material change and creativity. The project serves as a model for material translation, questioning the contemporary act of appropriation in both art and culture. The project developed through my rejection of contemporary practices of appropriation, along with my passion for the spiritual nature of pattern and the glass technique of murrine. My theoretical framework is built around the linguistic concept of ‘creative translation’. Linguistic theorists such as Jorge Luis Borges ‘treated translation as a creative force in which specific translation strategies might serve a variety of cultural and social functions’. 2 My project will adapt this linguistic concept to visual practice, investigating its relevance to material language...|$|R

In this application, individual <b>glass</b> <b>panel</b> is supported on two sides (roof and foundation) and subjected to in-plane shear force (lateral wind), out-of-plane distributed load (perpendicular wind) and in-plane compression force (self weight of the roof, snow). While several studies on glass plate behaviour under distributed load and column buckling exist, shear buckling of two sides supported <b>glass</b> <b>panel</b> has not been investigated yet. Therefore, research on this topic gives original and innovative importance to both theoretical (<b>glass</b> <b>panel</b> under shear loading) and practical (use of glass envelope for building stabilization) applications. Two structural concepts are developed: point support concept - the <b>glass</b> <b>panel</b> {{is attached to the}} substructure by bolted connections at corners linear support concept - the <b>glass</b> <b>panel</b> is glued to the substructure by two shorter sides. The local behaviour of the connection devices and the global behaviour of the <b>glass</b> <b>panel</b> under in-plane shear force are studied by means of experimental investigations, numerical modelling and parametric analyses. Experimental investigation and numerical simulation of connection devices was conducted in order to better understand the behaviour of different types of glass/substructure bolted (for point support) and glued (for linear support) connections. Deformation, stress distribution and local influence on the surrounding glass were analyzed. From these studies, the most suitable connection device for load introduction was chosen and implemented in the <b>glass</b> <b>panel.</b> Tests on full size <b>glass</b> <b>panels</b> were conducted in order to estimate the shear buckling behaviour of a <b>glass</b> <b>panel.</b> Also the influence of different boundary conditions (point and linear) and load interaction (in-plane shear force with out-of-plane distributed load and in-plane compression force) on global <b>glass</b> <b>panel</b> behaviour were analyzed. The specimen deformation, the stress distribution and the failure mode have been analyzed. Advanced numerical models of point and linear supported <b>glass</b> <b>panel</b> were implemented using the Finite Element Code Ansys. Elastic buckling analysis was used to determine the critical shear buckling force, shear buckling coefficient and shear buckling mode shape, further used as the initial geometrical imperfection. By means of nonlinear buckling analyses the global <b>glass</b> <b>panel</b> behaviour was studied analysing <b>glass</b> <b>panel</b> deformations, stresses distribution and support reactions.

Recently even structural glass elements {{have been developed}} {{and the application of}} glass in structural elements is becoming more common. The ongoing development of new glass types and different production and processing methods resulted in the manufacturing of thin chemically strengthened aluminosilicate glass by AGC. Thin glass is mainly applied in the electronics industry, but the increased strength, optical properties, toughness, bending resistance and weather resistance make it a promising material for application in buildings. The Netherlands is the globe’s number two food exporter {{and more than half of}} the nation’s land area is used for agriculture and horticulture. Research on the optimisation of greenhouse designs is a hot topic in the Netherlands to maintain this leading position. The greenhouse industry provides an appropriate application for <b>flat</b> thin <b>glass</b> <b>panels,</b> because of the possibility to increase both light transmittance and structural performance. The goal of the research presented in this report is to determine the feasibility of the application of thin chemically strengthened aluminosilicate glass in greenhouse coverings. The research was divided into four topics that are relevant for greenhouse designs: building physics, structural properties, structural behaviour and economics. The building physics research was conducted in collaboration with the Greenhouse Technology team of the Wageningen University & Research. The light transmittance results showed an increased hemispherical light transmittance for thin glass when compared to regular float glass. The investigation of the structural properties of thin chemically strengthened aluminosilicate glass was based on available literature and the material properties provided by the producer. For this research a characteristic bending tensile strength of 260 MPa has been assumed. However, further research is recommended for the determination of the accurate bending tensile strength and design impact strength of thin glass. The structural behaviour of a thin <b>glass</b> <b>panel</b> in a greenhouse covering was investigated by executing both numerical and experimental analyses. The numerical analysis of the reference system showed that it is necessary to stiffen the thin <b>glass</b> <b>panel</b> for <b>flat</b> application in a Venlo greenhouse system. Multiple variants were designed and studied by numerical and experimental analyses. The IGU panel turned out to be the most promising variant for future application of thin chemically strengthened aluminosilicate glass in greenhouse coverings. As a main outcome it was concluded that thin chemically strengthened aluminosilicate glass has a better light transmittance, higher bending strength and increased impact strength than regular float glass. This leads to a higher crop yield and lower costs for transportation, construction, maintenance and insurance which makes thin glass an attractive alternative. At this moment, however, the material costs are very high and the decreased thickness and increased flexibility resulted in a lower stiffness. It is therefore not likely that a single layer of uncoated thin chemically strengthened aluminosilicate glass will result in a feasible greenhouse covering design. Nevertheless, the use of thin chemically strengthened aluminosilicate glass can result in an optimised greenhouse covering design when applied as an insulating (IGU) panel. Building Engineerin...|$|R
