50|$|The {{informal}} economy or the informal sector, {{also referred to}} by the names “black market” and “underground market,” consists of entrepreneurs who engage in economic activities that fail to fulfill certain legal requirements even though their objectives are actually lawful. Perhaps the talipapa and sidewalk vendors can be good examples of this sector of the economy. Other examples could include the street children who sell sampaguita, or even people who engage in criminal acts affecting the economy, such as human trafficking, drug trafficking, and theft. The other more popular forms of informality can perhaps be the <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> <b>sector</b> (loan sharks) {{and the proliferation of}} informal settlements, or squatters’ areas. People normally dive into the informal sector due to poverty where they are somehow forced to produce or create income, or even due to the feeling that they are not being treated fairly by economic institutions. People who engage in informal activities somehow believe that informal economic activity is an expression of freedom from all the binding policies of the economy, and it is only then when they finally feel the true essence of being in a free market economy.|$|E
40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate the interaction of formal and informal financial markets and their impact on economic activity in quasi-emerging market economies. Using a four-sector dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with asymmetric information in the formal financial sector, we come up with three fundamental findings. First, we demonstrate that formal and <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> <b>sector</b> loans are complementary in the aggregate, suggesting that an increase in the use of formal financial sector credit creates additional productive capacity that requires more <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> <b>sector</b> credit to maintain equilibrium. Second, it is shown that interest rates in the formal and informal financial sectors do not always change together in the same direction. We demonstrate that in some instances, interest rates in the two sectors change in diametrically opposed directions with the implication that the <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> <b>sector</b> may frustrate monetary policy, the extent of which depends on the size of the <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> <b>sector.</b> Thus, the larger the size of the <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> <b>sector</b> the lower the likely impact of monetary policy on economic activity. Third, the model shows that the risk factor (probability of success) for both high and low risk borrowers plays an important role in determining the magnitude by which macroeconomic indicators respond to shocks.

To provide a solid platform for the study, various theoretical studies are examined allowing for knowledge on informal finance in Henan, including the definition, the background information and the scale of <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> <b>sector.</b> To put the need for formalising informal finance in Henan, this thesis also examines different perspectives of informal financial regulation both in Henan and worldwide. A regulatory framework is provided based on analyses of these theoretical studies. In order to fill the gap between theriacal solutions and actual practices in the context of Henan, it is essential to gather field data regarding Henan’s informal finance and its regulation. The scope of the field research is thus covers an online questionnaire survey of 224 Henan’s residents to gain a general picture of Henan’s <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> <b>sector</b> through seeking their opinions and aspirations. The data generated from the online survey are then triangulated with the considered views of 20 field workers in Henan. The views of the 20 field workers, including the managers of informal financial institutions, the government officials and the financial experts are solicited through in-depth interviews. The key findings that emerged out of the field data analysis is that Henan’s <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> <b>sector</b> could be potentially formalised through seven strategies, including expansion of private investment channels and promotion of interest rate liberalisation, reinforcement of government control and legislation over informal finance, reformation of credit culture, establishment of a sound credit history system and integration of formal and informal financial institutions. A set of regulatory recommendations based on the key findings is also provided. It is expected that these recommendations, if implemented, would allow Henan’s <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> <b>sector</b> to gain higher transparency and reliability, eventually become an alternative financing channel for Henan’s residents.

Successive financial sector reforms, which seek to enhance the role of monetary policy instruments in macroeconomic management, in view of the theoretical and empirical link between monetary policy and general price level, have been implemented with less than satisfactory results. This paper examines the monetary policy in stabilizing price level in Nigeria. We employ the Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model, with in-built differencing to take care of unit root in these time series data, to capture this relationship. From our findings, we discover that, money supply has no significant relationship with price level in Nigeria. This, we believe, may be due to the influence of the large <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> <b>sector</b> which controls a very significant fraction of money in circulation.

40|$|To {{the best}} our knowledge, {{in the first}} {{empirical}} macroeconomic examination of the nexus between financial intermediation and mobile phones, Asongu employs two conflicting financial system definitions {{in the assessment of}} how mobile phones have stimulated financial development in Africa. Within the framework of the dominant International Monetary Fund's International Financial Statistics (2008) definition, mobile phones are established to be negatively associated with financial intermediary dynamics of depth, activity and size. Conversely, when the previously neglected <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> <b>sector</b> is integrated into the conception, definition and measurement of the financial system, mobile phones are positively (negatively) correlated with the informal (formal) financial intermediation sector. The empirical evidence is based on 52 African countries. Causality in the established linkages has been confirmed in subsequent studies by the same author. At least three policy implications derive from the findings. First, the role of informal financial intermediation is increasing to the detriment of formal financial mechanisms. Second, in order to capture the positive effect of mobile phones on finance, it is imperative to integrate the missing <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> <b>sector</b> component into the IMF definition of the financial system.

It also considers how policymakers and service providers in the formal and <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> <b>sectors</b> rationalize control of resources and the effects on mobile populations.

It examines how structural inequities restrict banking resources from those who lack full personhood or citizenship. This thesis uncovers the paradox that while banking is a vital resource in establishing full participation in United States society, it remains largely inaccessible to migrant workers, particularly the undocumented. The financial sectors’ neoliberal model has effectively barred low-income, mobile populations through the erasure of small deposit accounts and increased scrutiny of customers. Migrant workers face corporeal and economic mobility difficulties, which depreciate their low wages even farther. The United States’ current financial industry violates second generation human rights as codified in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1966) [particularly article six], and also in Articles 23 - 29 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) as the Unbanked and underbanked cannot access their own money.

This paper introduces complementary indicators to the existing Financial Development and Structure Database (FDSD). Dynamic panel system GMM estimations are applied. Different specifications, non-overlapping intervals and control variables are used to check the consistency of estimated coefficients. Our results suggest that from an absolute standpoint (GDP base measures), all financial sectors are pro-poor. However, three interesting findings are drawn from measures of sector importance. (1) The expansion of the formal financial sector {{to the detriment of}} other financial sectors has a disequalizing income effect. (2) Growth of informal and semi-formal financial sectors {{at the expense of the}} formal financial sector has an income equalizing effect.

40|$|The author {{analyzes}} the financial system's role in {{economic growth and}} stability, addressing several core policy issues associated with <b>financial</b> <b>sector</b> reform in emerging economies. He studies finance's role {{in the context of}} a circuit model, with interacting rational, forward-looking, heterogeneous agents. He shows finance to essentially complement the price system in coordinating decentralized intertemporal resource allocation choices made by agents operating with limited information and incomplete trust. He discusses the links between finance and incentives for efficiency and stability in the context of the circuit model. He also identifies incentives and incentive-compatible institutions for reform strategies for <b>financial</b> <b>sectors</b> in emerging economies. Among his conclusions: 1) Circuit theory features important methodological advantages to analyze the role of finance, and to assess structural weaknesses of financial systems under different institutional settings and in different stages of economic development. 2) Incentives for prudence and honesty can protect the stability of the circuit by directing private sector forces unleashed by liberalization. In particular: a) Financial institutions should be encouraged to invest in reputational capital. b) Governments should complement the creation of franchise value by strengthening supervision and by adopting a regulatory regime based on rules designed to align the private incentives of market players with the social goal of financial stability. c) Safety nets to reduce systemic risk should minimize the moral hazard from stakeholders by limiting risk protection and by making the cost of protection sensitive to the risk taken. d) Governments should encourage self-policing in the <b>financial</b> <b>sector.</b> e) Where information and trust are scarce, there is a potential market for them, and governments can greatly improve incentives for optimal provision of information. f) Governments should strengthen the complementarity between the formal and the <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> <b>sectors.</b> Emphasizing incentives is not to deny the importance of good rules, capable regulators andsupervisors, and strong enforcement measures. It is to suggest that the returns on investments to set up rules, institutions, and enforcement mechanisms can be greater if market players have an incentive to align their own objectives with the social goal of financial stability.

40|$|Purpose: We make {{available}} new critical macroeconomic financial indicators {{to the research}} community. Nothing is more powerful than a phenomenon whose time has come. What is the macroeconomic empirical context of growing mobile banking? Perhaps one of the deepest empirical hollows in the financial development literature has been the equation of financial depth in the perspective of money supply to liquid liabilities. This equation has put on the margin, a burgeoning phenomenon whose time has come: mobile banking. Design/Methodology: We decompose financial depth into formal, semi-formal and informal sectors and then assess the incidence of mobile banking on each constituent. Thus the IFS (2008) definition of the financial system is extended to incorporate an <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> <b>sector</b> in line with Asongu(2011). Three hypotheses based on eight propositions are tested using a plethora of endogeneity-robust and HAC standard errors estimation techniques. Findings: The <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> <b>sector</b> (a previously missing component {{in the definition of}} money supply: M 2) is positively affected by mobile banking, while the incidence of mobile banking is negative on formal and semi-formal financial intermediary development. The paper contributes {{at the same time to}} the macroeconomic literature on measuring financial development and responds to the growing field of economic development by means of <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> <b>sector</b> promotion, microfinance and mobile banking. It suggests a practicable way to disentangle the effects of mobile banking on various financial sectors. Research implications: Since empirical research on the phenomenon has been hampered by lack of data, we {{make available}} macroeconomic financial indicators to the research community. The present paper is also in response to the numerous calls on the research gap in the literature that emphasize the need for research on mobile banking. The mobile-finance nexus is gaining momentum, yet relatively little scholarly research explores the incidence of these m-banking/m-payment (systems) on financial development. Practical implications: (1) There is a burgeoning role of informal finance in developing countries. (2) The incidence of the growing phenomenon of mobile banking cannot be effectively assessed at a macroeconomic level by traditional financial development indicators. (3) It is a wake-up call for scholarly research on informal financial intermediary development indicators which will guide monetary policy; since a great chunk of the monetary base (M 0) in less developed countries is now captured by mobile banking. Originality/value: New financial indicators for mobile banking assessment based on insufficiencies in the financial development literature: liquid liabilities as applied to developing countries is misleading because a great chunk of the monetary base does not transit through the banking system but via informal networks like the growing phenomenon of mobile banking. ...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the determinants of}} informal savings in Southwestern Nigeria using the linear probability model and multiple regression technique. It utilizes cross-section data generated from a {{survey conducted by the}} authors between October and November 1989 on the savings habit and utilization in the informal sector. The empirical results revealed that savings behaviour in the <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> <b>sector</b> is affected by income, age, occupation, education and region of residence. They showed that the self-employed, less educated and rural population identified more with informal savings and had a higher informal savings ratio. The two cardinal variables from economic theory (income and age) accounted for the bulk of the variation in the level of informal savings. The empirical results confirm that marginal propensity to save informally is positive, less than one; but the absolute income hypothesis that marginal propensity to save is greater than average propensity to save in the <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> <b>sector</b> is contradicted. The result suggests that with a rising income, the average propensity to save informally declines while, presumably, the fraction of income saved increases in the formal sector. Evidence of people becoming more thrifty was also established, but savings of this kind was not really and could not have been motivated by the reason of saving-up towards retirement. In the process of capital accumulation, a conclusion of the paper is that savings policy should target the self-employed in the informal sector. Another conclusion reached by the paper is that any policy that succeeds in achieving increased earnings in the informal sector has a tendency of increasing the propensity to save in the formal financial sector, even {{at the expense of the}} informal one...|$|E

40|$|The {{financial}} {{systems and}} financial markets {{of developing countries}} have a common feature: the dualism. This means the co-existence and operation side by side of a formal or institutional <b>financial</b> <b>sector</b> and of an <b>informal</b> or non-institutional <b>financial</b> <b>sector.</b> The great diversity of <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> activities makes difficult to evaluate the actual extent of informal finance in each economy, but empirical evidence {{in a number of}} less developed countries suggests that such extent is always relevant. Many examples bear witness of vitality of informal finance in filling the gaps left by operations of formal financial intermediaries: segments of the market neglected, credit rationing pursued through non-price allocation, exorbitant transaction costs shifted off to borrowers. The informal sector plays {{a significant role in the}} economy in terms of employment opportunities and poverty alleviation. This sector generates income-earning opportunities for a large number of people. In India, a large section of the total workforce is still in the informal sector, which contributes a sizeable portion of the country's net domestic product. The informal sector got an inherent ability to adopt the changing economic condition, technological changes and changing customer perceptions with its inbuilt indigenous management practices...|$|R

Empirically, the project explores the formal and <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> practices of the research participants in relation to banking, savings, credit, debt management, insurance as well as remittance sending. In addition, it reviews the different levels and types of risks encountered by migrants in their everyday lives, and how these shape their financial decisionâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 0 making. The thesis develops a framework combining current thinking from risk research with transnational migration and economic geography scholarships in order to uncover the social and geographical embeddedness of migrantsâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 financial decisionâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 0 making. It shows how the risks of financial hardship managed through migration actually evolve across space and time so that some migrants find themselves confronted by the very same risks of economic and social exclusion they sought to avoid by moving. Most noticeably, this research shows how such risks are managed by migrants through â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 8 mixing and matchingâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 a range of <b>informal</b> and formal <b>financial</b> practices whereby the costs of being financially excluded are balanced against, and shaped by, migration histories and experiences of living in a highly financialised and increasingly migrantâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 0 averse society...|$|R
30|$|This study re-examined the {{relationship}} among remittances, financial development and economic growth in 20 selected countries in Sub-Sahara Africa. We employed both the MG and PMG/ARDL model with VAR Granger causality/block exogeneity test. After establishing cointegration among the variables, the estimated results indicated that remittances exert significant positive effects on economic growth both {{in the short run}} and the long run. In the same vein, financial development significantly increases economic growth both in the long run and in the short run. In addition, we found unidirectional causalities to run from economic growth to remittances and from financial development to economic growth. On the other hand, no causal relationship was found between remittances and financial development in the SSA countries. The absence of causality between remittances and financial development justifies the earlier result of substitute relationship between them. This suggests a disconnection between remittance inflow and the financial markets in SSA reflecting low financial development and remittance inflow through the <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> markets. This may equally suggest that the number of remittance recipients that access financial services in SSA is still small compared to the volume of remittance inflow. Low penetration and concentration of banks could be hindrances in terms of far distance to the nearest financial units. This study, therefore, concludes that both remittances and financial development constitute effective sources of economic growth in SSA region, however, the interrelationship between remittance and financial development does not matter in the growth process in SSA. The findings of this study have generated important policy implications and recommendations. In the first instance, this study ascertained that remittances do promote economic growth in the SSA countries. The conclusion can be explained from the optimistic view that increase in aggregate demand would result from increase in consumption and investment of the remittance receiving families. The productive sector can then benefit from the increase in the aggregate demand through the multiplier effects. Furthermore, causality is found to run from economic growth to remittances. The implication of the causal effect is that availability of the growth potentials and investment opportunities at the home countries attract the huge flow of remittances from abroad to the SSA countries. Secondly, the study revealed that financial development is a powerful tool to improve economic growth in the SSA countries with causality running from financial development to economic growth. The policy recommendation is that improved financial services, financial instruments and the payment system are necessary for economic growth in SSA countries both in the short run and long run. The short and the long term financial policies in SSA should be focused towards improving the <b>financial</b> <b>sector</b> performance through the formulation and implementation of sound financial reforms to deepen the <b>financial</b> <b>sector.</b> There should be diversification of the banking services and increased financial inclusion {{such as the use of}} mobile banking, internet banking, automated Teller machines (ATM) and rural banking that will integrate more remittance-recipient households in SSA from the <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> <b>sectors</b> into the formal financial system for inclusive growth.|$|R
