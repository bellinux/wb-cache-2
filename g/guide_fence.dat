50|$|Humans started hunting {{reindeer}} in the Mesolithic and Neolithic periods, {{and humans}} are today the main predator in many areas. Norway and Greenland have unbroken traditions of hunting wild reindeer {{from the last}} glacial period until the present day. In the non-forested mountains of central Norway, such as Jotunheimen, {{it is still possible}} to find remains of stone-built trapping pits, <b>guiding</b> <b>fences,</b> and bow rests, built especially for hunting reindeer. These can, with some certainty, be dated to the Migration Period, although it is not unlikely that they have been in use since the Stone Age.|$|R
40|$|Jigsaw {{machines}} are common cutting tools {{and used in}} a large scale in wood working industries. The main problem with jigsaw usage is imprecision cutting due to blade deflection and human handling method. In this paper, a new design of second guided roller for the jigsaw to avoid blade deflection is introduced. A steel arm which holding the second guided roller and a platform with a <b>guided</b> <b>fence</b> are also presented. The cutting finding with and without using this tool is compared and reported. It is found that the jigsaw paired with this tool is able to cut a better straight line with a smooth cutting surface...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We give a {{sound and}} {{complete}} fence insertion procedure for concurrent finite-state programs running under the classical TSO memory model. This model allows “write to read ” relaxation {{corresponding to the}} addition of an unbounded store buffer between each processor and the main memory. We introduce a novel machine model, called the Single-Buffer (SB) semantics, and show that the reachability problem for a program under TSO {{can be reduced to}} the reachability problem under SB. We present a simple and effective backward reachability analysis algorithm for the latter, and propose a counter-example <b>guided</b> <b>fence</b> insertion procedure. The procedure is augmented by a placement constraint that allows the user to choose places inside the program where fences may be inserted. For a given placement constraint, we automatically infer all minimal sets of fences that ensure correctness. We have implemented a prototype and run it successfully on all standard benchmarks together with several challenging examples that are beyond the applicability of existing methods. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCache {{coherence}} protocols using self-invalidation and self-downgrade {{have recently}} seen increased popularity {{due to their}} simplicity, potential performance efficiency, and low energy consumption. However, such protocols result in memory instruction reordering, thus causing extra program behaviors that are often not intended by the programmer. We propose a novel formal model that captures the semantics of programs running under such protocols, and employs a set of fences that interact with the coherence layer. Using the model, we perfform a reachability analysis that can check whether a program satisfies a given safety property with the current set of fences. Based on an algorithm in [19], we describe a method for insertion of optimal sets of fences that ensure correctness of the program under such protocols. The method relies on a counter-example <b>guided</b> <b>fence</b> insertion procedure. One feature of our method {{is that it can}} handle a variety of fences (with different costs). This diversity makes optimization more difficult since one has to optimize the total cost of the inserted fences, rather than just their number. To demonstrate the strength of our approach, we have implemented a prototype and run it {{on a wide range of}} examples and benchmarks. We have also, using simulation, evaluated the performance of the resulting fenced programs...|$|R

40|$|This study aims {{to develop}} a mobile mapping system with the {{integration}} of vehicle-based navigation data, stereo images and laser scanning data for collecting, detecting, and positioning road objects, such as road boundaries, traffic marks, road signs, traffic signal, road <b>guide</b> <b>fences,</b> electric power poles and so on. In the hand of hardware, a hybrid inertial survey system (HISS) which combined an inertial navigation system (INS), two GPS receiver, and an odometer acquires the posture data was developed. Two sets of stereo camera systems are used to collect colour im-ages and three laser scanners are employed to acquire range data for road and roadside objects. On the other hand, an advanced data integration technology was developed {{for the purpose of}} pre-cise/automatic road sign extraction, traffic mark extraction, and road fence extraction and so on, by fusing collected initial navigation data, stereo images and laser range data. The major contribu-tions of this research are high-accuracy object positioning and automatic road mapping by integration-based processing of multi-sensor data. A lot of experiments were performed to certify and check the accuracy and efficiency of our mobile mapping technology. From achieved results of these experiments, our developed vehicle borne multi-sensor based mobile mapping system is efficient system for generating high-accuracy and high-density 3 D road spatial data more rapidly and less expensively...|$|R
5000|$|The Aspetuck Historic District is a {{historic}} district that preserves part of the historic village. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. [...] It occupies about 80 acre {{on the banks of}} the Aspetuck River and includes the oldest section of Easton. The 22 houses in the historic district date from 1750 to 1850. Some structures in the district are examples of Colonial Revival architecture. [...] The district is considered significant for being a [...] "Connecticut farming community that hasn't seen much change" [...] and the home of Helen Keller in her later years. Helen Keller, who was blind and deaf, often walked through the neighborhood by herself, using as her <b>guide</b> a <b>fence</b> that extended down to the Aspetuck River.|$|R
50|$|When {{the ride}} opened in 2004, the ride's {{entrance}} queue featured theming and special effects to resemble an ancient tomb. The entrance sign was mounted onto bamboo sticks and stone columns with propane torches. Next {{to the entrance}} was a tent which resembles Lara Croft's base with two motorcycles. Beyond the entrance were Chinese stone soldiers and a stone wall with images resembling deities found in ancient Buddhist and Hindu artworks. The queue and exit were <b>guided</b> by rope <b>fences.</b> Bat sounds looped while riders waited in the station.|$|R
2500|$|... : Table saws {{commonly}} have a <b>fence</b> (<b>guide)</b> {{running from}} the front of the table (the side nearest the operator) to the back, parallel to the cutting plane of the blade. The distance of the fence from the blade can be adjusted, which determines where on the workpiece the cut is made. The fence is commonly called a [...] "rip fence" [...] referring to its use in guiding the workpiece during the process of making a rip cut. Most table saws come standard with a rip fence, but some high end saws are available without a fence so a fence of the user's choice can be purchased separately.|$|R
