40|$|Sponsored by the DOE Industrial Energy Efficiency Grand Challenge program, our {{research}} {{team at the}} Georgia Institute of Technology conducted laboratory studies and confirmed the concept of making wood <b>pulp</b> using a <b>dry</b> <b>pulping</b> technology. This technology is a new process different from any prior pulping technology used in Kraft and CTMP pulping. Three different kinds of <b>dry</b> <b>pulping</b> methods were investigated. (a) <b>Dry</b> <b>Pulping</b> at Atmospheric Pressure: The first one is to dry and bake the pretreated woodchips in a conventional oven at atmospheric pressure {{without the use of}} a catalyst. (b) <b>Dry</b> <b>Pulping</b> at Reduced Pressure: The second method is to dry the pretreated woodchips first in a vacuum oven in the presence of anthraquinone (AQ) as a pulping catalyst, followed by baking at elevated temperature. (c) Liquid Free Chemical Pulping, LFCP. The third method is to first remove the free water of pretreated woodchips, followed by <b>dry</b> <b>pulping</b> using a conventional Kraft pulping digester with AQ and triton as additives. Method one: Experimental results indicated that <b>Dry</b> <b>Pulping</b> at Atmospheric Pressure could produce pulp with higher brightness and lower bulk than conventional Kraft pulp. However, tensile strength of the acquired pulp is much lower than traditional Kraft pulp, and their Kappa number and energy consumption are higher than conventional Kraft pulp. By fully analyzing the results, we concluded that wood fibers might be damaged during the drying process at elevated temperature. The main reason for wood fiber damage is that a long drying time was used during evaporation of water from the woodchips. This resulted in an un-uniform reaction condition on the woodchips: the outside layer of the woodchips was over reacted while inside the woodchips did not reacted at all. To solve this problem, <b>dry</b> <b>pulping</b> at reduced pressure was investigated. Method two: To achieve uniform reaction throughout the entire reaction system, the water inside the pretreated woodchips was evaporated first under vacuum condition at low temperature. Then, the dry woodchips were baked at high temperature (120 - 130 C) at atmospheric pressure. The qualities of the pulp made with this method were improved compared to that made with method one. The pulp shows higher brightness and lower bulk than Kraft pulping. The tensile strength is significantly higher than the pulp made from the first method. Although the pulp is stronger than that of TMP pulp, it is still lower than conventional Kraft fiber. Method Three: The third dry method was done in a Kraft pulping digester at elevated pressure but without free liquid in the digester. With this method, pulp that has almost the same qualities as conventional Kraft pulp could be produced. The screen yield, Kappa number, fiber brightness, pulp strength and pulp bulk are almost identical to the conventional Kraft pulp. The key advantages of this <b>dry</b> <b>pulping</b> method include ca. 55 % of cooking energy saved during the pulping process, as high as 50 wt% of NaOH saving as well as 3 wt% of Na 2 S saving comparing to Kraft one. By analyzing fiber properties, yields, chemical and energy consumptions, we concluded that the <b>dry</b> <b>pulping</b> method based on Liquid Free Chemical Pulping, LFCP, could be very attractive for the pulp and paper industry. More fundamental studies and scale up trials are needed to fully commercialize the technology. We expect to conduct pilot trials between 12 to 24 months of period if the DOE or industry can provide continual research funding. Based on the technology we demonstrated in this report, several pilot trial facilities in the United States will be available after small modifications. For example, the Herty Foundation in Savannah, Georgia is one of these potential locations. DOE funding for continuous study and final lead to commercialization of the technique is important...|$|R

40|$|The genus Rosa {{contains}} over 100 {{species that}} are widely distributed mostly in Europe, Asia, the Middle East and North America. Rosa canina L. (dog rose) is an erect shrub of up to 3. 5 meters height, sometimes climbing; its branches are often curved or arched. Petals are white to pale pink, rarely deep pink and fruit ripens late. Information about the biology and biochemistry of Rosa canina L. has allowed a good documentation by presenting it in several ways (botanical, agro technical, chemical composition and uses). The dog rose hips (Cynosbati fructus) comprise several biologically active compounds, such as: sugars, organic acids, pectins, flavonoids, tannins, carotenoids, fatty acids, vitamins (particularly vitamin C and also vitamins B 1, B 2, K, PP, E), macro- and microelements etc. Rosa canina. L. fruits have constituted {{an important source of}} food and medicine for many cultures. Common food preparations using rose hips include juice, wine, tea, jelly, jam, as well as mixed with dried salmon eggs. Dog rose can be found all the mountains in the Republic of Macedonia. Usually grows in areas exposed to the sun, mostly on the southern slopes outside the forest or roadsides. The aim of our study was to evaluate the amount of the main phyto-chemicals (vitamin C, total polyphenols, and total flavonoids) content in the dog rose pulp obtained from two genotypes var. transitoria, altitude 1120 m, and var. assiensis, altitude 410 m. The results of our study revealed that regarding the content of vitamin C, the results have significant difference between the studied genotypes: 432. 2 mg/ 100 g <b>dry</b> <b>pulp</b> for var. transitoria versus 154. 3 mg/ 100 g <b>dry</b> <b>pulp</b> for var. assiensis. Contrary to these findings, the content of total polyphenos was found to be similar for the both genotypes: 594. 3 mg/ 100 g <b>dry</b> <b>pulp</b> for var. transitoria and 570. 3 mg/ 100 g <b>dry</b> <b>pulp</b> for var. assiensis. The content of total flavonoids expressed as mg quercitin/ 100 g <b>dry</b> <b>pulp</b> were 131 for var. transitoria and 172. 4 for var. assiensis.
