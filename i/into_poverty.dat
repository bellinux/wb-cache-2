5|$|During the 1930s, {{parts of}} the state began {{suffering}} the consequences of poor farming practices, extended drought and high winds. Known as the Dust Bowl, areas of Kansas, Texas, New Mexico and northwestern Oklahoma were hampered by long periods of little rainfall and abnormally high temperatures, sending thousands of farmers <b>into</b> <b>poverty</b> and forcing them to relocate to more fertile areas of the western United States. Over a twenty-year period ending in 1950, the state saw its only historical decline in population, dropping 6.9 percent as impoverished families migrated out of the state after the Dust Bowl.|$|E
5|$|In the Middle Ages, {{land was}} {{to some extent}} held collectively in South Wales, as in feudal England, with villages {{surrounded}} by ridge-and-furrow open fields. In contrast, in North Wales, farmers {{living in the same}} hamlet may have co-operated to the extent of sharing plough teams, but land was held by individuals. Throughout the Middle Ages, sheep were less significant than hardy upland cattle. Welsh medieval land holdings, however, were disrupted by partible inheritance (where all the land was shared amongst all the sons of a landowner), creating small farms which often sank <b>into</b> <b>poverty.</b> Partible inheritance was abolished by Parliament in 1542.|$|E

5|$|The poem is a lyrical {{description}} {{of the life of}} a tribe he was living with along the Amazon river. While it has echoes of Tennyson in the rhymes and rhythms the poem itself is not overly Romantic, serving more as a tool to set the scene and then draw contrast between {{the lives of the people}} living here and those in England. The poem is a comment on savagery and greed, making the point that some in England were more 'savage' than those on the Amazon, either by a greed for gold or by their greed for gold driving others <b>into</b> <b>poverty.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1891 Joyce wrote a poem on {{the death}} of Charles Stewart Parnell. His father was angry at the {{treatment}} of Parnell by the Catholic church, the Irish Home Rule Party and the British Liberal Party and the resulting collaborative failure to secure Home Rule for Ireland. The Irish Party had dropped Parnell from leadership. But the Vatican's role in allying with the British Conservative Party to prevent Home Rule left a lasting impression on the young Joyce. The elder Joyce had the poem printed and even sent a part to the Vatican Library. In November of that same year, John Joyce was entered in Stubbs' Gazette (a publisher of bankruptcies) and suspended from work. In 1893, John Joyce was dismissed with a pension, beginning the family's slide <b>into</b> <b>poverty</b> caused mainly by his drinking and financial mismanagement.|$|E
5|$|The Old Curiosity Shop is a 1911 American silent short drama film {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film is an adaptation of The Old Curiosity Shop by Charles Dickens that {{was limited to the}} time constrictions of the single reel format. The film focuses on the grandfather who gambles <b>into</b> <b>poverty</b> and the consequences which eventually claim the life of Little Nell. Its survival and attribution as a Thanhouser film was noted by Kamilla Elliott in her 2003 book Rethinking the Novel/Film Debate under the title Little Nell. In 2012, the work was confirmed to be a Thanhouser production at the Pordenone Silent Film Festival. The identification of the film as Little Nell arose due to head of the film having been lost.|$|E

5|$|Born <b>into</b> <b>poverty</b> in 1882, Hobbs wished from {{an early}} age to pursue a career in cricket. His early batting was undistinguished, but a sudden {{improvement}} in 1901 brought him to the attention of local teams. In 1903 he successfully applied to join Surrey, with the support of England batsman Tom Hayward. His reputation grew and when he qualified to play for Surrey, he scored 88 on his first-class debut and a century in his next game. Over the following seasons, he established himself as a successful county player and in 1908 made his Test debut for England, scoring 83 in his first innings. After some mixed early performances for England, Hobbs' success against South African googly bowlers made his place secure, and by 1911–12, when he scored three centuries in the Test series against Australia, critics judged him the world's best batsman. In county cricket, he developed an attacking, dynamic style of play and was very successful up until 1914. After serving in the Royal Flying Corps during the First World War, he maintained his reputation when cricket resumed in 1919, but his career was threatened by appendicitis, which caused him to miss most of the 1921 season. When he returned, he was a more cautious batsmen and used a safer style of play. Subsequently, he became more consistent and scored prolifically in both Test and domestic cricket until his retirement. In this period, he played some of his most acclaimed innings.|$|E

40|$|Summary This study {{analyzes}} {{the persistence of}} poverty in both rural and urban areas in Ethiopia during 1994 - 2004. The key finding is that households move frequently {{in and out of}} poverty but the difficulty of exiting from poverty, like the chance of avoiding slipping back, increases with the time spent in that state and varies considerably between male- and female-headed households. Our results imply {{that it is important to}} design anti-poverty policies both to hinder households from slipping <b>into</b> extreme <b>poverty</b> and to minimize the length of the poverty spell for households once they have fallen <b>into</b> it. <b>poverty</b> persistence hazard models state dependence Ethiopia...|$|R
