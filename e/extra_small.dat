5|$|Whack Ball is {{comparable}} to Breakout: the player controls a large ball with the Menacer to push a smaller on-screen ball into color-changing bricks that line the wall. One all of the bricks change color, the player moves to the next level. Some bricks are power-ups that change the larger ball's size or add <b>extra</b> <b>small</b> balls into play. Players who hit flashing bricks are punished. Inadvertently guiding the ball {{through a hole in}} the wall ends the game.|$|E
25|$|Type II systems {{lack the}} Cas6 gene and instead utilize RNaseIII for cleavage. Functional type II systems encode an <b>extra</b> <b>small</b> RNA that is {{complementary}} to the repeat sequence, {{known as a}} trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA). Transcription of the tracrRNA and the primary CRISPR transcript results in base pairing {{and the formation of}} dsRNA at the repeat sequence, which is subsequently targeted by RNaseIII to produce crRNAs. Unlike the other two systems the crRNA does not contain the full spacer, which is instead truncated at one end.|$|E
25|$|Depending {{upon the}} path of the ball, the batsman will either move forward or back in his attempt to {{intercept}} it. A forward movement is designated a front foot shot, whereas a backwards movement is designated a back foot shot. A front foot shot is typically used to address a ball arriving at between ankle and thigh height. The batsman will step forward towards the ball, bending his front knee to bring his bat down to the anticipated height of the ball. By moving forwards, the batsman is also able to intercept the ball immediately after it has pitched, thus nullifying any potentially dangerous lateral movement. A back foot shot is typically used to address a ball arriving at between thigh and head height. The batsman will step back and, if necessary, stand on his tip toes to raise his bat to the height of the ball. By stepping back towards the wicket, he also receives the advantage of having an <b>extra</b> <b>small</b> amount of time to react to any unexpected lateral movement or variation in bounce.|$|E
