5|$|After {{the first}} year of development, Gas Powered Games found that {{they were not going to}} be able to finish the game within the planned two years; not only was the {{seamless}} world without loading screens harder to create than they had thought, but, according to lead developer Bartosz Kijanka, they had been overambitious in choosing how many innovative features they could put into the game's custom engine, such as the wide range through which the virtual camera system could zoom in and out. Other features supported and later dropped included allowing up to ten characters at once—and therefore maintaining up to ten areas of the single-player world—instead of the final maximum of eight, and a weather system that included wind blowing projectiles off course. According to Kijanka, the developers also spent a lot of time changing technologies mid-development, such as building a custom animation editor before moving to a licensed one, and starting with the OpenGL graphics library only to switch to Direct3D. As a result, the team was required to work 12–14 hour days and weekends for most of the development time in order to complete the game within four years. In a 2011 interview, Taylor stated that in retrospect the final cost in development time of the seamless world may have been too high, and also that the team tried to make too large of a game for their budget; he believed that a game with closer to 35 hours of playtime instead of 70 would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> and more polished experience given their constraints.|$|E

He was already ill and old for his years, so would probably not have succeeded Heath as party leader, but might have prevented Thatcher from doing so.|$|E
25|$|Pompey married Cornelia, a {{daughter}} of Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius Scipio. Some people disliked this because Cornelia was much younger and she would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> match for his sons. There were also people who thought that Pompey gave priority to his wedding over dealing with {{the crisis in the}} city. Pompey was also seen as being partial in the conduct of some trials. He succeeded in restoring order and chose his father-in‑law as his colleague for the last five months of the year. Pompey was granted an extension of his command in his provinces and was given an annual sum for the maintenance of his troops. Cato warned Pompey about Caesar’s manoeuvres to increase his power by using the money he made from the spoils of war to extend is patronage in Rome and urged him to counter Caesar. Pompey hesitated, and Cato stood for the consulship in order to deprive Caesar of his military command and have him tried. However, he was not elected.|$|E

Scott's critical biographer Roland Huntford records that the surgeon Edward L Atkinson, who had accompanied the southern party {{to the top of the}} Beardmore, had recommended either Lashly or Crean for the polar party rather than Edgar Evans. Scott in his diary recorded that Crean [...] wept with disappointment at the prospect of having to turn back, so [...] close to the goal.|$|E

Futterman also commented on the song's selection, though from a slightly different angle: [...] "In theory it's charming—and there are definitely moments of the 'I can dance/You can't dance' exchange that were enjoyable—but we couldn't ever imagine this song as something Finn would have voluntarily picked." ...|$|E

500|$|In Cobb's view, the {{transfer}} of personnel to the yawl may have been intended as a temporary safety measure.

If, however, the line had subsequently parted, Mary Celeste would have sailed away empty leaving the yawl to founder with its occupants. Begg notes the illogicality of attaching the yawl to a vessel that the crew thought was about to explode or sink, while the modern writer Macdonald Hastings asks whether Briggs, an experienced captain, would have effected a panicky abandonment of the ship when, [...] "If the Mary Celeste had blown her timbers, she would still <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> bet for survival than the ship's boat."

500|$|... "If I Were a Boy" [...] {{was written}} by BC Jean and Toby Gad. It is the opening ballad of the I Am ... disc of the double album I Am... Sasha Fierce. It is the only song on either disc that Beyoncé did not co-write. Most of the lyrics were written by Jean, who was {{inspired}} by the break-up of a romantic relationship. One day Jean and Gad visited a pizzeria in Times Square in New York City. Although tempted, Jean refrained from eating pizza because she was dieting. She then thought that if she were a boy, she would have eaten without regret. After reflecting on the idea, she concluded that she would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> man than her past lover. Gad captured Jean's ideas on a pocket recorder, and they went to the studio the same day. Once there, she wrote the lyrics and melody in about 15 minutes. She then recorded the song in less than half an hour, with Gad on the guitar.|$|E
500|$|For the 1969 season, Rindt {{signed for}} the 1968 World Constructors' Champion Lotus, where {{he joined the}} {{defending}} Drivers' Champion Graham Hill. Rindt felt uncomfortable with the move, owing to the notorious unreliability of the Lotus car; in a twenty-month period between 1967 and 1969, the team was involved in 31 accidents. Hill alone had nine crashes between 1968 and 1970, which led him to joke: [...] "Every time I am being overtaken by my own wheel, I know I am in a Lotus." [...] When Rindt joined Lotus, his friend and de facto manager Bernie Ecclestone, who had negotiated the deal, remarked that they were aware that Brabham may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> choice of team but {{the speed of the}} Lotus gave Rindt a chance to win the championship. Rindt commented: [...] "At Lotus, I can either be world champion or die."

2500|$|Though his {{achievements}} as {{a critic of}} fiction were impressive, Leavis is often viewed as <b>having</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> critic of poetry than of the novel. In New Bearings in English Poetry Leavis attacked the Victorian poetical ideal, suggesting that nineteenth-century poetry sought the consciously ‘poetical’ and showed a separation of thought and feeling and a divorce from the real world. The influence of T. S. Eliot is easily identifiable in his criticism of Victorian poetry, and Leavis acknowledged this, saying in The Common Pursuit that, [...] "It was Mr. Eliot who made us fully conscious of the weakness of that tradition" [...] In his later publication Revaluation, the dependence on Eliot was still very much present, but Leavis demonstrated an individual critical sense operating {{in such a way}} as to place him among the distinguished modern critics.|$|R
500|$|The {{history of}} China after the {{revolution}} is that the CPC did not pursue a slow gradual change in the economy as some believed in 1944. [...] Regardless, 25 years later Service believed that American cooperation with the CPC might have prevented the excesses that occurred under Mao Zedong's leadership after the war. After {{the same number of}} years, [...] John Davies, in his memoir, Dragon by the Tail, defended his belief that the CPC would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> Chinese ally for the U.S. than the Kuomintang. Davies believes that the U.S. interests would have been better served allying with the CPC based on Realpolitik practical considerations. Allying with the CPC would have prevented it from allying with the Soviet Union, and lessened the risk and anxiety that the U.S. and the world experienced in the Cold War. In the [...] "Lost Chance" [...] theory, the United States missed the opportunity to build a friendly relationship with the CPC and prevent their later alignment with the Soviet Union.

500|$|Due to the {{impending}} Writers Guild of America strike, writer and co-executive producer Maurice Hurley developed the teleplay {{in a day}} and a half from fan fiction written by Deborah McIntyre and Mona Clee. Due to the strike, certain story ideas were removed from the plot including the planned first appearance of the Borg which was subsequently delayed until the [...] episode [...] "Q Who". This was because [...] "The Neutral Zone" [...] was originally intended to be the first of a two-part episode, but due to the strike there wasn't enough time to write the second part and so the story was shortened. The second episode would have seen the Enterprise and the Romulans team up against the Borg. The script that was shot was a first draft, and due to the writer's strike in place, no amendments were subsequently made. Director James L.

RONS normally serve the cells as second messengers to regulate many of the intracellular signaling cascades that govern multiple cellular activities. However, when the amount of RONS exceeds the cell’s ability to metabolize/eliminate them, the cell becomes stressed and acquires genetic and epigenetic aberrations and dysregu-lated intracellular signaling cascades. In addition, there <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> {{understanding of the role}} of tissue inflammation in the carcinogenesis process.

500|$|Critical {{reception}} of the compilation album was positive overall; many reviewers appreciated the album in its entirety but criticized select tracks. The AU Review Robert Lyon awarded the album a score of 8.2 on a 10-point scale. Lyon thought [...] "Clap Your Hands" [...] began the album [...] "brilliantly" [...] and complimented additional individual tracks, but noted the compilation offered no previously unreleased material and that the bonus DVD was only available through select retailers. Mikey Cahill of News Limited awarded the album four points on a five-point scale.

Freya Davies of ArtsHub suggested [...] "Bring Night" [...] would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> opening track. Davies criticized select tracks, such as [...] "Destiny" [...] and [...] "Day Too Soon" [...] due to Sia's [...] "inarticulate" [...] singing, but also complimented faster tempo songs which highlighted her [...] "vocal strength" [...] ("Titanium" [...] and [...] "Buttons"). Davies concluded: [...] "Sia's ability to combine cult and popular appeal is successfully demonstrated by the strength of this compilation album. Its weaknesses are momentary; overall, it is a fun salute to the past 15 years and a respectable look to the future." ...|$|E
500|$|Axe to Fall {{received}} little negative criticism. Jared W. Dillon of Sputnikmusic (who had previously given No Heroes a 4.5 out of 5) gave the album {{a score of}} 2.5 out of 5, citing his distaste for {{the large number of}} guest musicians. Dillon stated that Converge [...] "seems out of ideas as they enlisted a group of musicians associated with the band to fill in at various points of the record" [...] and rhetorically asked, [...] "why replace the band on a decent portion of their new record with far less talented, less interesting musicians?" [...] He also criticized the album's longer and slower track, [...] "Wretched World." [...] When compared to Converge's similar previously released-tracks, (No Heroess [...] "Grim Heart/Black Rose" [...] and Jane Does [...] "Jane Doe") Dillon claimed that the song [...] "never builds to anything" [...] and [...] "cuts off seemingly just as it should've started." [...] Noel Gardner of Drowned in Sound also found Axe to Falls two closing tracks underwhelming and felt that it [...] "would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> album for finishing at track 11."

500|$|The Blessing has {{provoked}} a more divided response. Waugh's judgement was {{that those who}} criticised the book were [...] "lazy brutes..... can't bear to see a writer grow up". More recently, Philip Hensher and others have [...] argued that although the novel is immensely enjoyable and that Mitford's [...] "marvellous voice" [...] is undiminished, she is on less sure ground with her [...] "Frenchness" [...] than with the English country house ambience, and her picture of France {{as the embodiment of}} everything civilised is less than convincing. Similar mixed comments greeted Mitford's final novel, Don't Tell Alfred, Waugh again hailing it as her best, [...] "clamouring for a sequel". In this judgement he was largely alone; other critics perceived in the anecdotal framework of the book an uncertainty as to what it was about. An American reviewer wondered what parts were to be taken seriously: [...] "What exactly goes on?... Can you always tell an Etonian, even when he goes beat? Is all modern architecture a fraud? Do U-people really talk this way?" [...] Similar questions were raised in the Times Literary Supplements review, in relation to Mitford's fictional output as a whole: [...] "Would she <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> novelist if she had 'tried harder', gone in further, dropped the pose of amateurishness, cut the charm, looked beyond the worlds that she knew and, more importantly, loved?" ...|$|E
