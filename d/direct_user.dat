25|$|In {{contrast}} to traditional dictionaries, which {{are designed to}} be used by human beings, dictionaries for natural language processing (NLP) are built to be used by computer programs. The final user is a human being but the <b>direct</b> <b>user</b> is a program. Such a dictionary {{does not need to be}} able to be printed on paper. The structure of the content is not linear, ordered entry by entry but has the form of a complex network (see Diathesis alternation). Because most of these dictionaries are used to control machine translations or cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) the content is usually multilingual and usually of huge size. In order to allow formalized exchange and merging of dictionaries, an ISO standard called Lexical Markup Framework (LMF) has been defined and used among the industrial and academic community.|$|E
