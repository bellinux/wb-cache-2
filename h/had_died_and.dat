5|$|Olga Rudge, {{pregnant}} with Pound's child, followed them to Italy. She had {{little interest in}} raising a child, but may have felt that having one would maintain her connection to him. In July 1925 she gave birth to their daughter, Mary. Olga placed the child with a German-speaking peasant woman whose own child <b>had</b> <b>died,</b> <b>and</b> who agreed to raise Mary for 200 lire a month.|$|E
5|$|After marrying Robin Petyarre, {{brother of}} artist Gloria Petyarre, Josepha Petrick {{moved to the}} region of Utopia, {{north-east}} of Alice Springs, which is where she was living when she began painting around 1990. They had seven children, one of whom, Damien Petrick, {{went on to become}} an artist like his mother. By 2008, Josie Petrick's husband <b>had</b> <b>died,</b> <b>and</b> Petrick was dividing her time between Alice Springs and Harts Range, to its north-east.|$|E
5|$|All {{but four}} of the women from Lidice were {{deported}} immediately to Ravensbrück concentration camp (four were pregnant– they were subjected to forced abortions at the same hospital where Heydrich <b>had</b> <b>died</b> <b>and</b> the women were then sent to the concentration camp). Some children were chosen for Germanization, and 81 were killed in gas vans at the Chełmno extermination camp. Both towns were burned and Lidice's ruins were levelled. At least 1,300 people were massacred after Heydrich's death.|$|E

5|$|An English folk tale {{tells how}} an old woman, a {{supposed}} witch, cursed her landlord {{and all his}} possessions when he demanded the unpaid rent for her cottage. Soon afterwards, a large toad fell on his wife and caused her to collapse. The toad was thrown into the fire but escaped with severe burns. Meanwhile, the old witch's cottage had caught fire and she was badly burnt. By next day, both toad and witch <b>had</b> <b>died,</b> <b>and</b> {{it was found that}} the woman's burns exactly mirrored those of the toad.|$|E
5|$|Between 1859 and 1860, Frewin Hall {{housed the}} future Edward VII whilst he {{attended}} Christ Church. The chapel and old kitchen were planned to {{form part of}} a new, third, quadrangle for Brasenose. The valuable rents that the shops {{on the south side}} of Brasenose earned the college provided the most significant reason for the delay in further expansion, which only began in 1886 when work on the west side was started. It was finally completed in 1911, the last work having been done to the High Street frontage. Frewin Hall was reconstructed between 1887 and 1896, as were the chapel and antechapel. It had been in 1886 that Cradock <b>had</b> <b>died</b> <b>and</b> was replaced by Albert Watson.|$|E
5|$|By 1948, Rothenberg's father <b>had</b> <b>died</b> <b>and</b> his mother, Lotte (1894–1990), {{had become}} a {{naturalized}} United States citizen. To be with her in New York City, Rothenberg journeyed to Canada, arriving in Halifax, Nova Scotia; traveling from there to Toronto, he lived for a while at Wycliffe College, where he worked briefly as a construction laborer. On 19 November 1948, he crossed the international border into the United States at Buffalo, with $12.00 in his pocket. In 1951, he volunteered for the United States Army, transferred to the Air Force, and served in the Korean War until 1955. He remained guided by {{a deep sense of}} duty and a strong sense of American patriotism throughout his life.|$|E

5|$|In 1004-5 al-Maʿarri {{learned that}} his father <b>had</b> <b>died</b> <b>and,</b> in reaction, wrote an elegy where he praised his father. Years later he would travel to Baghdad where he became well {{received}} in the literary salons of the time, {{though he was a}} controversial figure. After the eighteen months in Baghdad, al-Maʿarri returned home for unknown reasons. He may have returned because his mother was ill, or he may have run out of money in Baghdad, as he refused to sell his works. He returned to his native town of Maʿarra in about 1010 and {{learned that his}} mother had died before his arrival.|$|E
5|$|In November 1978, Armstrong {{was working}} at his farm near Lebanon, Ohio. As he jumped off {{of the back of}} his grain truck, his wedding ring got caught in the wheel, tearing off the tip of his left hand's ring finger. He {{collected}} the severed digit and packed it in ice, and surgeons reattached it at the Jewish Hospital in Louisville, Kentucky. In February 1991, a year after his father <b>had</b> <b>died,</b> <b>and</b> nine months {{after the death of his}} mother, he suffered a mild heart attack while skiing with friends at Aspen, Colorado.|$|E
5|$|On 11 June 838 {{the emir}} Ziyadat Allah <b>had</b> <b>died,</b> <b>and</b> was succeeded by his brother, Abu Iqal ibn al-Aghlab. The new emir sent fresh troops to Sicily, where the Muslims regained {{the upper hand}} after Mousele's departure: in 839–840, the Muslims {{captured}} the fortresses of Corleone, Platani, Caltabellotta, and possibly also Marineo, Geraci and other forts, and in 841, they raided from Enna as far as Grotte.|$|E

5|$|Schwester Selma and Dr. Wallach adopted {{three girls}} who had been {{abandoned}} in the hospital. One was Samoohah Calderon, whose mother <b>had</b> <b>died</b> <b>and</b> whose father had been drafted into the Turkish army; the infant's grandparents asked them to keep the baby. The second adoptee, Bolissa, was given to them by her father, who had carried her {{all the way from}} Syria; her mother had died en route. Bolissa was killed in the 1948 Ben Yehuda Street bombing. The third adoptee was named Sarina. The girls grew up on hospital grounds and were sent to school; one of the girls became a nurse; another a dental technician.|$|E
5|$|The 27-year war can {{be divided}} roughly into three periods of major {{fighting}} – from 1975 to 1991, 1992 to 1994, and from 1998 to 2002 – broken up by fragile periods of peace. By the time the MPLA finally achieved victory in 2002, more than 500,000 people <b>had</b> <b>died</b> <b>and</b> over one million had been internally displaced. The war devastated Angola's infrastructure, and severely damaged the nation's public administration, economic enterprises, and religious institutions.|$|E
5|$|The painting, {{the figures}} painted from life when possible, {{does not contain}} all the signers. Some <b>had</b> <b>died</b> <b>and</b> images could not be located. One figure {{had participated in the}} {{drafting}} but did not sign the final document; another refused to sign. In fact the membership of the Second Continental Congress changed as time passed, and the figures in the painting were never in the same room at the same time.|$|E

5|$|Though Endeavour {{was now in}} good condition, {{her crew}} were not. During the ship's stay in Batavia, all but 10 of the 94people aboard had been taken ill with malaria and dysentery. By the time Endeavour set sail on 26 December, seven crew members <b>had</b> <b>died</b> <b>and</b> another forty were too sick to attend their duties. Over the {{following}} twelve weeks, a further 23 died from disease and were buried at sea, including Spöring, Green, Parkinson, and the ship's surgeon William Monkhouse.|$|E
5|$|Unaware of {{her death}} four years prior, the Swedish {{mathematician}} Gösta Mittag-Leffler considered nominating her for the 1926 Nobel Prize in Physics, and wrote to Shapley requesting more information on her work on Cepheid variables, offering to send her his monograph on Sofia Kovalevskaya. Shapley replied, letting Mittag-Leffler know that Leavitt <b>had</b> <b>died,</b> <b>and</b> suggesting that the true credit belonged to his (Shapley's) interpretation of her findings. She was never nominated, because the Nobel Prize is not awarded posthumously.|$|E
5|$|After the war the British {{discovered}} Ball's grave, {{which had}} been behind enemy lines, in the Annoeullin Cemetery. In December 1918, personnel of No. 207 Squadron RAF erected a new cross {{in place of the}} one left by the Germans. The Imperial War Graves Commission (now Commonwealth War Graves Commission) were working at the time to consolidate the British war graves into fewer cemeteries; 23 British bodies in graves in the location where Ball was buried were moved to the Cabaret Rouge British Cemetery, but at his father's request Ball's grave was allowed to remain. Albert Sr. paid for a private memorial to be erected over Ball's grave, No. 643, in what later became the Annoeullin Communal Cemetery and German Extension. Ball's is the only British grave from the First World War in this extension, the rest being German. Ball's father also bought the French field where his son <b>had</b> <b>died</b> <b>and</b> erected a memorial stone on the crash site.|$|E

5|$|During {{this period}} her mother <b>had</b> <b>died,</b> <b>and</b> Bryher had {{divorced}} her husband, only to marry H.D.'s new male lover, Kenneth Macpherson. H.D., Bryher, and Macpherson lived together and traveled through Europe {{as what the}} poet and critic Barbara Guest termed in her biography of H.D. as a 'menagerie of three.' Bryher and Macpherson adopted H.D.'s daughter, Perdita. In 1928, H.D. became pregnant but chose to abort the pregnancy in November. Bryher and Macpherson set up the magazine Close Up (to which H.D. regularly contributed) as a medium for intellectual discussion of cinema. In 1927, the small independent film cinema group POOL or Pool Group was established (largely funded with Bryher's inheritance) and was managed by all three. Only one POOL film survives in its entirety, Borderline (1930), which featured H.D. and Paul Robeson in the lead roles. In common with the Borderline novellas, the film explores extreme psychic states {{and their relationship to}} surface reality. As well as acting in this film, H.D. wrote an explanatory pamphlet to accompany it, a piece later published in Close Up.|$|E
5|$|For the People's Republic of Poland, 1956 {{was a year}} of transition. The {{international}} situation significantly weakened the hard-line Stalinist faction in Poland; Polish communist leader Bolesław Bierut died in March; it was three years since Stalin <b>had</b> <b>died</b> <b>and</b> his successor at the Soviet Union's helm, Nikita Khrushchev, denounced him in February. Protests by workers in June in Poznań had highlighted the people's dissatisfaction with their situation. In October, the events set in motion resulted in the rise in power of the reformers' faction, led by Władysław Gomułka. After brief, but tense, negotiations, the Soviets gave permission for Gomułka to stay in control and made several other concessions resulting in greater autonomy for the Polish government. For Polish citizens this meant a temporary liberalization. Eventually though, hopes for full liberalization were proven false, as Gomułka's regime became more oppressive. Nonetheless, the era of Stalinization in Poland had ended.|$|E
5|$|In November 1860, Tubman {{conducted}} {{her last}} rescue mission. Throughout the 1850s, Tubman {{had been unable}} to effect the escape of her sister, Rachel, and Rachel's two children, Ben and Angerine. Upon returning to Dorchester County, Tubman discovered that Rachel <b>had</b> <b>died,</b> <b>and</b> the children could be rescued only if she could pay a US$30 bribe. She had no money, so the children remained enslaved. Their fates remain unknown. Never one to waste a trip, Tubman gathered another group, including the Ennalls family, ready and willing to take the risks of the journey north. It took them weeks to safely get away because of slave catchers, forcing them to hide out longer than expected. The weather was unseasonably cold and they had little food. The children were drugged with paregoric to keep them quiet while slave patrols rode by. They safely reached the home of David and Martha Wright in Auburn, New York, on December 28, 1860.|$|E
