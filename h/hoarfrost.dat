5|$|Dew {{point is}} the {{temperature}} to which a given parcel of air must be cooled, at constant atmospheric pressure, for water vapor to condense into water. The condensed water is called dew. The dew point is a saturation point. When the dew point temperature falls below freezing {{it is called the}} frost point, as the water vapor no longer creates dew but instead creates frost or <b>hoarfrost</b> by deposition. The dew point is associated with relative humidity. A high relative humidity indicates that the dew point is closer to the current air temperature. If the relative humidity is 100%, the dew point is equal to the current temperature. Given a constant dew point, an increase in temperature will lead to a decrease in relative humidity. At a given barometric pressure, independent of temperature, the dew point determines the specific humidity of the air. The dew point is an important statistic for general aviation pilots, as it is used to calculate the likelihood of carburetor icing and fog. When used with the air temperature, a formula can be used to estimate the height of cumuliform, or convective, clouds.|$|E

40|$|The climatic {{record of}} the {{earliest}} spring in Romania, regarding the south-east {{part of the country}} – Spring 2016. In the past 30 years it has been an increasing frequency of early SPRING ARRIVAL. Therefore, vegetation development started in early February. In March, the warm weather continued almost throughout the month, and the <b>hoarfrosts</b> from March became hereby destructive. Frequently, the vegetation in April was in very advanced stages. Even though the temperatures rose in April, cooling in April and late spring <b>hoarfrosts</b> have occurred and caused considerable damage. In this study we analyze the climatic macroprocesses that led to the apparition of an absolute climate record for the earliest spring arrival in 2016.

He also printed on textiles using his solvent-transfer technique to make the <b>Hoarfrosts</b> (1974–76) and Spreads (1975–82), and in the Jammers (1975–76), created a series of colorful silk wall and floor works. Urban Bourbons (1988–95) focused on different methods of transferring images onto a variety of reflective metals, such as steel and aluminum. In addition, throughout the 1990s, Rauschenberg continued to utilize new materials while still working with more rudimentary techniques, such as wet fresco, as in the Arcadian Retreat (1996) series, and the transfer of images by hand, as in the Anagrams (1995–2000). As part of his engagement with the latest technological innovations, he began making digital Iris prints and using biodegradable vegetable dyes in his transfer processes, underscoring his commitment to caring for the environment.|$|R

2500|$|In the Hebrew Bible, manna is {{described}} twice: once in [...] {{with the full}} narrative surrounding it, and once again in [...] {{as a part of}} a separate narrative. In the description in the Book of Exodus, manna {{is described}} as being [...] "a fine, flake-like thing" [...] like the frost on the ground. It is described in the Book of Numbers as arriving with the dew during the night. Exodus adds that manna was comparable to <b>hoarfrost</b> in size, similarly had to be collected before it was melted by the heat of the sun, and was like a coriander seed that is white. Numbers describes it as having the appearance of bdellium, adding that the Israelites ground it and pounded it into cakes, which were then baked, resulting in something that tasted like cakes baked with oil. Exodus states that raw manna tasted like wafers that had been made with honey. The Israelites were instructed to eat only the manna they had gathered for each day. Stored manna [...] "bred worms and stank": the exception being that stored the day before the Sabbath (Preparation Day), when twice the amount of manna was gathered. This manna did not spoil overnight, because, Exodus 16:23-24 states:This is what the Lord commanded: [...] "Tomorrow is to be a day of rest, a holy Sabbath to the Lord. So bake what you want to bake and boil what you want to boil. Save whatever is left and keep it until morning." [...] So they saved it until morning, as Moses commanded, and it did not stink or get maggots in it.In the Bread of Life Discourse in John's Gospel, the evangelist refers three times to the manna which the Jews' ancestors ate in the desert: the Jews refer to the manna given to them by Moses as a sign of God's promised covenant, and Jesus asserts that the manna was from God and not from Moses, and that the people who ate it were nourished on their journey but ultimately died. In contrast, according to the gospel, Jesus offered living bread, and whoever ate this bread would never die.|$|E

40|$|Although 2013 {{has been}} {{classified}} as the sixth warmest {{year in the}} history (OMM Michel Jarraud), regionally, in the south-west of Romania, the climatic variability was exceptionally, marked by sudden changes from a warm and droughty weather to a cold (even cool) and rainy weather. Climatic alternations were registered in every month of the year. After the warmish and capricious summer, the autumn thermal regime came in the south-west of Romania. The autumn of 2013 was marked by three intense cooling, one {{in the end of}} September that continued in the beginning of October and culminated with low temperatures, negative minimum thermal values and intense <b>hoarfrosts,</b> which destroyed the vegetable crops. In November, the high daily air temperature means led to gradual enforcements, and in {{the end of the month}} autumn crops were in advanced development stages, and at rape the floral stems and bottoms appeared.

40|$|Microclimate {{modification}} {{induced by}} intermittent water sprinkling {{at ground level}} {{has proven to be}} suitable to enhance protection against spring <b>hoarfrosts</b> in orchards. This research investigates about the efficiency of different sprinkler types and water volumes in enhancing air temperature in the canopy layer and to optimise the amount and the cycling of the water applied. Tests have been done over three consecutive years in purpose-built boxes delimited by polyethylene film where different sprinklers and sprayers tested were positioned along two pipes. Microsprinklers and microsprayers with different characteristics and outflow capacity were compared to evaluate whether the size of the drops can induce modification of energy balance at the surface. The impact of below tree water sprinkling on the temperature profile appeared to be evident independently on the irrigation device and of the outflow tested. While no substantial differences between sprinklers and sprayers did not arise when the temperatures kept above 3 °C, when temperatures fell below 3 °C (even down to 7 /− 8 °C), a better performance of the microsprinklers with respect to microsprayers was observed. Differences tend to fade out with height. In the same temperature conditions, a better performance of the microsprinklers with higher outflow (65 l/h) with respect to the same model characterised by a lower outflow (45 l/h) clearly emerged...|$|R
40|$|Received on , {{reviewed}} on , accepted on The paper analyses the climatic and agroclimatic conditions {{during the}} spring of 2011. Although the climatic global warming process continues, in some years, the climatic evolutions are atypical in Oltenia {{as well as in the}} entire country, and, consequently, the spring of 2011 was cold and droughty. Compared to the last 12 springs, the thermal regime indicates that the spring of 2011 was unique, and the pluviometric regime that it was droughty, although the agricultural crops were not affected due to the lower thermal regime that maintained a satisfactory degree of the soil humidity. The late spring <b>hoarfrosts</b> on 7 and 8 May have also had damaging effects in Oltenia. In consequence, there were some stagnation periods for the agricultural crops, and some important delays for the vegetables crops, and there were significant damages in the places where the seedlings were removed in the field. As a consequence of the thermal variations, there have been some diseases and pests, especially Monilinia laxa in stone fruits. Although the periods of weather cooling are considered beneficial to the climate general evolution on the planet, if they appear in the late spring, they represent an important climatic risk factor. Thus, their forecast is welcome especially for the agriculture. This paper is useful for the Ph. D. and master graduates and to all the researchers in the climate and agroclimate field...|$|R

40|$|In {{the autumn}} of 2013, in Oltenia, weather {{evolution}} {{has been marked by}} an exceptional variability with fast transitions from a warm weather to an extremely cold and even excessively cold in some intervals and from an excessively rainy weather to a droughty weather. These fast transitions from one extreme to another of weather aspect are due to the increase of climatic variability, an aspect which is directly connected to climatic global warming. After the warmish summer of 2013, in the end of August, beginning with August 24, a cooling process has begun which has slowly continued during the whole month of September and has strengthened in the last two days. The cooling climax was registered in the interval October 4 - 5, when negative thermal minimum values were registered, frost in the air and ground and early <b>hoarfrosts</b> which affected crops, especially the vegetable crops. In November the high daily air temperature means led to gradual enforcements, and in {{the end of the month}} the autumn crops were in advanced development stages, and in rape the floral stems and studs appeared.

6000|$|A {{little before}} evening Thumb {{suddenly}} stopped, and stood listening. They {{went on a}} little farther, and again he stood still, with lifted head, snuffing the air. And soon they all heard plainly {{the sound of a}} great river. In the last light of sunset the travellers broke out of the forest and looked down on the waters of the deep and swollen Obea-munza. Along its banks grew giant sedge, stiff and grey with frost like meal. In this sedge little birds were disporting themselves, flitting and twittering, with long plumes of every colour that changes in the sunlight, brushing off with their tiny wings the gathered <b>hoarfrost</b> into the still sunset air. The Mulgars stood like painted wooden images, with their bundles and cudgels, staring down at the river, wide and turbulent, its gloomy hummocks of ice and frozen snow nodding down upon the pale green waters. They glanced at one another as if with the question on their faces, [...] "How now, O Mulla-mulgars?" ...|$|E
60|$|I do {{not think}} I was disturbed, though I confess to having been a little amazed to see how {{profound}} this valley was into which we were descending, yet how swiftly climbed the sun, as if to pace with us so {{that we should not}} be in shadow, howsoever fast we journeyed. I was astonished to see flowers of other seasons than summer by the wayside, and to hear in June, for no other month could bear such green abundance, the thrush sing with a February voice. Here too, almost at my right hand, perched a score or more of robins, bright-dyed, warbling elvishly in chorus as if the may-boughs whereon they sat were white with <b>hoarfrost</b> and not buds. Birds also unknown to me in voice and feather I saw, and little creatures in fur, timid yet not wild; fruits, even, dangled from the trees, as if, like the bramble, blossom and seed could live here together and prosper.|$|E
60|$|By and by, in {{a little}} time, the outward world puts on a drear austerity.

All summer long they have murmured like the noise of waters; they have roared loudly while the branches were wrestling with the thunder-gust; they have made music both glad and solemn; they have attuned my thoughts by their quiet sound as I paced to and fro beneath the arch of intermingling boughs. Now they can only rustle under my feet. Henceforth the gray parsonage begins to assume a larger importance, and draws to its fireside,--for the abomination of the air-tight stove is reserved till wintry weather,--draws closer and closer to its fireside the vagrant impulses that had gone wandering about through the summer.|$|E

[...] It was shrewdly chill in the grey November morning, a <b>hoarfrost</b> lying white on the fields. I took the cloak gladly and bestowed myself in the tree, so that I had a wide view down Lihons way, whence we expected our enemies, the road running plain to see for leagues, like a ribbon, when once the low sun had scattered the mists. It was a long watch, and a weary, my hands being half frozen in my steel gauntlets. Many of our men slept; if ever a wayfarer crossed the bridge hard by he was stopped, gagged, and trussed in a rope's end. But wayfarers were few, and all were wandering afoot.

One day, however, after he had returned late from the market town, she found that she had stolen a march upon that indefatigable early riser. The kitchen was all blackness. She crossed the castle-yard to the wood-cellar, her steps printing the thick <b>hoarfrost.</b> A scathing breeze blew out of the north-east and slowly carried a regiment of black and tattered clouds over the face of heaven, which was already kindled with the wild light of morning, but where she walked, in shelter of the ruins, the flame of her candle burned steady.

6000|$|When Thumb awoke {{they sat}} quietly mumbling and talking {{together}} a while. Beyond {{the mouth of}} the cavern stood the beehive-houses of the Mountain-mulgars, each in its splash of lengthening shadow. Day drew on to evening. An eagle squalled in space. Else all was still; no living thing stirred. For these Men of the Mountains have no need to keep watch. They sleep secure in their white huts. None can come in, and none go out but first they must let down their ladders. Thumb scrambled up, and he and Nod hobbled off softly together to where the cataract hung like a shrine of <b>hoarfrost</b> in pillars of green ice from the frozen snows above. The evening was filled with light of the colour of a flower. Even the snow that capped the mountains was faintest violet and rose, and far in the distance, between the peaks of Zut and misty Solmi, stretched a band of darkest purple, above which the risen moon was riding in pale gold. And Nod knew that there, surely, must be Battle's Sea. He pointed Thumb to it, and the two Mulgars stood, legs bandy, teeth shining, eyes fixed. Nod gazed on it bewitched, till it seemed he almost saw the foam of its league-long billows rolling, and could catch in his thin round ear the roar and surge Battle had so often told him of. [...] "Ohé! if my Oomgar were but with me now!" [...] he thought. [...] "How would his eyes stare to see his friend the sea!" ...|$|E
60|$|There is snow in yonder cold {{gray sky}} of the morning!-and, through the {{partially}} frosted window-panes, I {{love to watch}} the gradual beginning of the storm. A few feathery flakes are scattered widely through the air, and hover downward with uncertain flight, now almost alighting on the earth, now whirled again aloft into remote regions of the atmosphere. These are not the big flakes, heavy with moisture, which melt as they touch the ground, and are portentous of a soaking rain. It is to be, in good earnest, a wintry storm. The two or three people, visible on the side-walks, have an aspect of endurance, a blue-nosed, frosty fortitude, which is evidently assumed {{in anticipation of a}} comfortless and blustering day. By nightfall, or at least before the sun sheds another glimmering smile upon us, the street and our little garden will be heaped with mountain snow-drifts. The soil, already frozen for weeks past, is prepared to sustain whatever burden may be laid upon it; and, to a northern eye, the landscape will lose its melancholy bleakness and acquire a beauty of its own, when Mother Earth, like her children, shall have put on the fleecy garb of her winter's wear. The cloud-spirits are slowly weaving her white mantle. As yet, indeed, there is barely a rime like <b>hoarfrost</b> over the brown surface of the street; the withered green of the grass-plat is still discernible; and the slated roofs of the houses do but begin to look gray, instead of black. All the snow that has yet fallen within the circumference of my view, were it heaped up together, would hardly equal the hillock of a grave. Thus gradually, by silent and stealthy influences, are great changes wrought. These little snow-particles, which the storm-spirit flings by handfuls through the air, will bury the great earth under their accumulated mass, nor permit her to behold her sister sky again for dreary months. We, likewise, shall lose sight of our mother's familiar visage, and must content ourselves with looking heavenward the oftener.|$|E
6000|$|... 11. Some {{essential}} points {{respecting the}} flower I shall note, however, before ending. There is one large and frequent species of it {{of which the}} flowers are delicately yellow, touched with tawny red, forming {{one of the chief}} elements of wild foreground vegetation in the healthy districts of hard Alpine limestone.[26] This is, I believe, the only European type of the large Cape varieties, in all of which, judging from such plates as have been accessible to me, the crests or fringes of the lower petal are less conspicuous than in the smaller species; and the flower almost takes the aspect of a broom-blossom or pease-blossom. In the smaller European varieties, the white fringes of the lower petal are the most important and characteristic part of the flower, and they are, among European wild flowers, absolutely without any likeness of associated structure. The fringes or crests which, towards the origin of petals, so often give a frosted or gemmed appearance to the centres of flowers, are here thrown to the extremity of the petal, and suggest an almost coralline structure of blossom, which in no other instance whatever has been imitated, still less carried out into its conceivable varieties of form. How many such varieties might have been produced if these fringes of the Giulietta, or those already alluded to of Lucia nivea, had been repeated and enlarged; as the type, once adopted for complex bloom in the thistle-head, is multiplied in the innumerable gradations of thistle, teasel, hawkweed, and aster! We might have had flowers edged with lace finer than was ever woven by mortal fingers, or tasselled and braided with fretwork of silver, never tarnished--or <b>hoarfrost</b> that grew brighter in the sun. But it was not to be, and after a few hints of what might be done in this kind, the Fate, or Folly, or, on recent theories, the extreme fitness--and consequent survival, of the Thistles and Dandelions, entirely drives the fringed Lucias and blue-flushing milkworts out of common human neighbourhood, to live recluse lives with the memories of the abbots of Cluny, and pastors of Piedmont.|$|E
60|$|So we {{advanced}} {{into this}} ghostly city, continuing to hold our course through narrow streets and lanes, all filled and flowing with water. Some {{of the corners}} where our way branched off, were so acute and narrow, that it seemed impossible for the long slender boat to turn them; but the rowers, with a low melodious cry of warning, sent it skimming on without a pause. Sometimes, the rowers of another black boat like our own, echoed the cry, and slackening their speed (as I thought we did ours) would come flitting past us like a dark shadow. Other boats, of the same sombre hue, were lying moored, I thought, to painted pillars, near to dark mysterious doors that opened straight upon the water. Some of these were empty; in some, the rowers lay asleep; towards one, I saw some figures coming down a gloomy archway from {{the interior of a}} palace: gaily dressed, and attended by torch-bearers. It was but a glimpse I had of them; for a bridge, so low and close upon the boat that it seemed ready to fall down and crush us: one of the many bridges that perplexed the Dream: blotted them out, instantly. On we went, floating towards the heart of this strange place--with water all about us where never water was elsewhere-- clusters of houses, churches, heaps of stately buildings growing out of it--and, everywhere, the same extraordinary silence. Presently, we shot across a broad and open stream; and passing, as I thought, before a spacious paved quay, where the bright lamps with which it was illuminated showed long rows of arches and pillars, of ponderous construction and great strength, but as light to the eye as garlands of <b>hoarfrost</b> or gossamer--and where, for the first time, I saw people walking--arrived at a flight of steps leading from the water to a large mansion, where, having passed through corridors and galleries innumerable, I lay down to rest; listening to the black boats stealing up and down below the window on the rippling water, till I fell asleep.|$|E
6000|$|One {{after one}} the stars have risen and set, Sparkling upon the <b>hoarfrost</b> on my chain: The Bear, that prowled all night about the fold Of the North-star, hath shrunk into his den.

Sunless and starless all, the desert sky Arches above me, empty as this heart [...] 10 For ages hath been empty of all joy, Except to brood upon its silent hope, As o'er its hope of day the sky doth now.

[...] 20 But still I heard them wander {{up and down}} That solitude, and flappings of dusk wings Did mingle with them, whether of those hags Let slip upon me once from Hades deep, Or of yet direr torments, if such be, I could but guess; and then toward me came A shape as of a woman: very pale It was, and calm; its cold eyes did not move, And mine moved not, but only stared on them. Their fixed awe went through my brain like ice; [...] 30 A skeleton hand seemed clutching at my heart, And a sharp chill, as if a dank night fog Suddenly closed me in, was all I felt: And then, methought, I heard a freezing sigh, A long, deep, shivering sigh, as from blue lips Stiffening in death, close to mine ear. I thought Some doom was close upon me, and I looked And saw the red moon through the heavy mist, Just setting, and it seemed as it were falling, Or reeling to its fall, so dim and dead [...] 40 And palsy-struck it looked. Then all sounds merged Into the rising surges of the pines, Which, leagues below me, clothing the gaunt loins Of ancient Caucasus with hairy strength, Sent up a murmur in the morning wind, Sad as the wail that from the populous earth All day and night to high Olympus soars. Fit incense to thy wicked throne, O Jove! ...|$|E
60|$|In the winter, the {{botanist}} needs not confine {{himself to}} his books and herbarium, and give over his out-door pursuits, but may study a new department of vegetable physiology, what may be called crystalline botany, then. The winter of 1837 was unusually favorable for this. In December of that year, the Genius of vegetation seemed to hover by night over its summer haunts with unusual persistency. Such a <b>hoarfrost,</b> as is very uncommon here or anywhere, and whose full effects can never be witnessed after sunrise, occurred several times. As I went forth early on a still and frosty morning, the trees looked like airy creatures of darkness caught napping; on this side huddled together with their gray hairs streaming in a secluded valley, which the sun had not penetrated; on that hurrying off in Indian file along some watercourse, while the shrubs and grasses, like elves and fairies of the night, sought to hide their diminished heads in the snow. The river, viewed from the high bank, appeared of a yellowish green color, though all the landscape was white. Every tree, shrub, and spire of grass, that could raise its head above the snow, {{was covered with a}} dense ice-foliage, answering, as it were, leaf for leaf to its summer dress. Even the fences had put forth leaves in the night. The centre, diverging, and more minute fibres were perfectly distinct, and the edges regularly indented. These leaves were {{on the side of the}} twig or stubble opposite to the sun, meeting it for the most part at right angles, and there were others standing out at all possible angles upon these and upon one another, with no twig or stubble supporting them. When the first rays of the sun slanted over the scene, the grasses seemed hung with innumerable jewels, which jingled merrily as they were brushed by the foot of the traveller, and reflected all the hues of the rainbow as he moved from side to side. It struck me that these ghost leaves, and the green ones whose forms they assume, were the creatures of but one law; that in obedience to the same law the vegetable juices swell gradually into the perfect leaf, on the one hand, and the crystalline particles troop to their standard in the same order, on the other. As if the material were indifferent, but the law one and invariable, and every plant in the spring but pushed up into and filled a permanent and eternal mould, which, summer and winter forever, is waiting to be filled.|$|E

Of these, {{however, the}} one whose root is deepest and range widest will be denied by many readers, and doubted by others, so {{that it may be}} well to say a word or two farther in its {{interpretation}} and defense--the saying, namely, that [...] "faith cannot dwell in hideous towns," [...] and that [...] "familiarity with beauty is a most powerful aid to belief." [...] This is a curious saying, in front {{of the fact that the}} primary force of infidelity in the Renaissance times was its pursuit of carnal beauty, and that nowadays (at least, so far as my own experience reaches) more faith may be found in the back streets of most cities than in the fine ones. Nevertheless the saying is wholly true, first, because carnal beauty is not true beauty; secondly, because, rightly judged, the fine streets of most modern towns are more hideous than the back ones; lastly--and this is the point on which I must enlarge--because universally the first condition to the believing there is Order in Heaven is the Sight of Order upon Earth; Order, that is to say, not the result of physical law, but of some spiritual power prevailing over it, as, to take instances from my own old and favorite subject, the ordering of the clouds in a beautiful sunset, which corresponds to a painter's invention of them, or the ordering of the colors on a bird's wing, or of the radiations of a crystal of <b>hoarfrost</b> or of sapphire, concerning any of which matters men, so called of science, are necessarily and forever silent, because the distribution of colors in spectra and the relation of planes in crystals are final and causeless facts, orders, that is to say, not laws. And more than this, the infidel temper which is incapable of perceiving this spiritual beauty has an instant and constant tendency to delight in the reverse of it, so that practically its investigation is always, by preference, of forms of death or disease and every state of disorder and dissolution, the affectionate analysis of vice in modern novels being a part of the same science. And, to keep to my own special field of study--the order of clouds,--there is a grotesquely notable example of the connection between infidelity and the sense of ugliness in a paper in the last Contemporary Review, in which an able writer, who signs Vernon Lee, but whose personal view or purpose remains to the close of the essay inscrutable, has rendered with considerable acuteness and animation the course of a dialogue between one of the common modern men about town who are the parasites of their own cigars and two more or less weak and foolish friends of hesitatingly adverse instincts: the three of them, however, practically assuming their own wisdom to be the highest yet attained by the human race; and their own diversion on the mountainous heights of it being by the aspect of a so-called [...] "preposterous" [...] sunset, described in the following terms:-- ...|$|E
