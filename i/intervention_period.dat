50|$|In {{addition}} to regular exercise, nutritional antioxidants may combat free radical formation—as {{has been reported}} for GPLC. In this study, subjects received oral GPLC at a dosage of either 1.5 or 4.5 grams per day {{over the course of}} an eight-week <b>intervention</b> <b>period.</b> With both dosages, the post-intervention level of malondialdehyde, a marker of lipid peroxidation, was decreased as compared to pre-intervention values.

More work using GPLC to combat resistance exercise-induced lipid peroxidation has also noted favorable findings (unpublished data). While many athletes now use GPLC as a component of their dietary supplement regimen, future work is needed to investigate the impact of GPLC on decreasing oxidative stress resulting from strenuous exercise.|$|E

A research study conducted by a board-certified dermatologist assigned postmenopausal women (50-65 years of age) with mild to moderate photoaging to drink either one Revival Soy protein shake or to remain on their normal diet for 6 months. After 6 months of dietary soy consumption, improvements were seen in facial wrinkling, discoloration, and overall appearance.

50|$|One {{specific}} {{example of}} this containment policy {{could be seen in}} Israel in 2007. This policy had an <b>intervention</b> <b>period</b> from April, 2007, to May, 2008. A nationwide outbreak of CRE (which peaked in March, 2007 at 55.5 cases per 100,000 patient days) necessitated a nationwide treatment plan. The intervention entailed physical separation of all CRE carriers and appointment of a task force to oversee efficacy of isolation by closely monitoring hospitals and intervening when necessary. After the treatment plan (measured in May, 2008), the number of cases per 100,000 patient days decreased to 11.7. The plan was effective because of strict hospital compliance, wherein each was required to keep detailed documentation of all CRE carriers. In fact, for each increase in compliance by 10%, incidence of cases per 100,000 patient days decreased by 0.6. Therefore, containment on a nationwide scale requires nationwide intervention.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose was}} to {{study the effects of}} {{flaxseed}} supplementation as a part of daily diet on serum lipids, fatty acids and plasma enterolactone. Design: Eighty volunteers participated in this clinical nutrition study which was carried out in a controlled, double-blind and cross-over manner. The subjects were randomized to diet sequences AB or BA. Diet A meals contained 1. 3 g= 100 g ground flaxseed and 5 g= 100 g flaxseed oil. Also 3 – 4 g= 100 of inulin and wheat fiber was added. AB diet with non-supplemented foods served as control. Test subjects were on both diets for 4 weeks separated by a 4 -week wash-out period. Fifteen test subjects continued an open part of the study for 4 additional months. Interventions: The dietary intake, basic blood values, serum lipids, fatty acids and enterolactone were measured at baseline, after both <b>intervention</b> <b>periods</b> and during the open study, at baseline and after 2 and 4 months. Serum thiocyanate and blood cadmium were controlled after both <b>intervention</b> <b>periods.</b> Results: The percentage of flaxseed supplemented test food out of total dietary intake was 20 % of energy. The test food contained significantly higher amounts of fiber, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and especially a-linolenic acid than the control food.

30|$|Another {{limitation}} {{of the study is}} the short symptom duration before the treatment (1  month) and the relative short follow-up time.

Additionally a longer duration of symptoms before treatment may have had an influence on the results. However, previous studies of this scientific group have shown that the effectiveness of the proposed treatment protocol is maintained even during much longer periods of symptomatology (Abat et al. 2014 a, b). Despite all this, it is possible that a <b>period</b> of longer <b>intervention</b> might affect the results. Therefore, future studies will be necessary.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} 52 weeks of soccer or {{resistance}} training were investigated in untrained elderly men. The subjects aged 68. 1 ± 2. 1 yrs were randomised into a soccer (SG; n = 9), a resistance (RG; n = 9) and {{a control group}} (CG; n = 8). The subjects in SG and RG, respectively, trained 1. 7 ± 0. 3 and 1. 8 ± 0. 3 times weekly on average during the <b>intervention</b> <b>period.</b> Muscle function and body composition were determined before and after 16 and 52 weeks of the <b>intervention</b> <b>period.</b> In SG, BMI was reduced by 1. 5 % and 3. 0 % (p< 0. 05) after 16 and 52 weeks, respectively, unchanged in RG and 2 % higher (p< 0. 05) in CG after 52 weeks of the <b>intervention</b> <b>period.</b> In SG, the response to a glucose tolerance test was 16 % lower (p< 0. 05) after 16 wks, but not after 52 wks, compared to before the <b>intervention</b> <b>period,</b> and unchanged in RG and CG. In SG, superoxide dismutase- 2 expression was 59 % higher (p< 0. 05) after 52 wks compared to before the <b>intervention</b> <b>period,</b> and unchanged in RG and CG. In RG, upper body lean mass was 3 and 2 % higher (p< 0. 05) after 16 and 52 wks, respectively, compared to before the <b>intervention</b> <b>period,</b> and unchanged in SG and CG. In RG, Akt- 2 expression increased by 28 % (p< 0. 01) and follistatin expression decreased by 38 % (p< 0. 05) during the 52 -wk <b>intervention</b> <b>period,</b> and was unchanged in SG and CG. Thus, long-term soccer training reduces BMI and improves anti-oxidative capacity, while long-term resistance training impacts muscle protein enzyme expression and increases lean body mass in elderly men.

We therefore investigated whether chronic consumption of pistachio nuts modifies the urine metabolome in prediabetic subjects. We designed a randomized crossover clinical trial in 39 prediabetic subjects. They consumed a pistachio-supplemented diet (PD, 50 % carbohydrates, 33 % fat, including 57 g/d of pistachios daily) and a control diet (CD, 55 % carbohydrates, 30 % fat) for 4 months each, separated by a 2 -week wash-out. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NRM) was performed to determine changes in 24 -h urine metabolites. Significant changes in urine metabolites according to the different <b>intervention</b> <b>periods</b> were found in uni- and multivariate analysis. Score plot of the first two components of the multilevel partial least squares discriminant analysis (ML-PLS-DA) showed a clear separation of the <b>intervention</b> <b>periods.</b> Three metabolites related with gut microbiota metabolism (i. e., hippurate, p-cresol sulfate and dimethylamine) were found decreased in PD compared with CD (P&lt;. 05). Moreover, cis-aconitate [intermediate of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) ] was also found decreased following PD compared with CD. Intragroup analysis showed that creatinine levels were significantly increased in PD (P=. 023), whereas trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) was found significantly reduced following PD (P=. 034). Our results suggest that chronic pistachio consumption may modulate some urinary metabolites related to gut microbiota metabolism and the TCA cycle; all associated with metabolic derangements associated with insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes...|$|R
