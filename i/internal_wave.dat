2500|$|Water can {{be moved}} through coral reefs in various ways, {{including}} current rings, surface waves, internal waves and tidal changes. [...] Movement is generally created by tides and wind. As tides interact with varying bathymetry and wind mixes with surface water, internal waves are created. An <b>internal</b> <b>wave</b> is a gravity wave that moves along density stratification within the ocean. When a water parcel encounters a different density it will oscillate and create internal waves. While internal waves generally have a lower frequency than surface waves, they often form as a single wave that breaks into multiple waves as it hits a slope and moves upward. This vertical break up of internal waves causes significant diapycnal mixing and turbulence. Internal waves can act as nutrient pumps, bringing plankton and cool nutrient-rich water up to the surface.|$|E

Internal waves in a continuously stratified medium may propagate vertically {{as well as}} horizontally. The dispersion relation for such waves is curious: For a freely-propagating <b>internal</b> <b>wave</b> packet, the direction of propagation of energy (group velocity) is perpendicular to the direction of propagation of wave crests and troughs (phase velocity). An <b>internal</b> <b>wave</b> may also become confined to a finite region of altitude or depth, {{as a result of}} varying stratification or wind. Here, the wave is said to be ducted or trapped, and a vertically standing wave may form, where the vertical component of group velocity approaches zero.

50|$|The surface tide propagates as a wave, {{in which}} water parcels {{in the whole}} water column {{oscillate}} {{in the same direction}} at a given phase (i.e., in the trough or at the crest, Fig. 1, top).

If there are two levels in the ocean, such as a warm surface layer and cold deep layer separated by a thermocline,then motions on the interface are possible. The interface movement is large compared to surface movement. The restoring force for internal waves and tides is still gravity but its effect is reduced because the densities of the 2 layers are relatively similar compared to the large density difference at the air-sea interface.
