After seeing the trailer for Monsters, Inc., Madrid concluded that Chronicle Books had passed her work to Pixar and that the film was based on her work. In October 2001, she filed the suit against Chronicle Books, Pixar, and Disney in a federal court in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Her lawyer asked the court to issue a preliminary injunction, that would forbid Pixar and Disney from releasing the film while the suit was pending.|$|E

25|$|Between 1775 and 1781, Seward {{was a guest}} and {{participant}} at the much-mocked salon held by Anna Miller at Batheaston, near Bath. However, it {{was here}} that Seward's talent was recognised and her work published in the annual volume of poems from the gatherings, a debt that Seward acknowledged in <b>her</b> <b>Poem</b> to the Memory of Lady Miller (1782).|$|E
25|$|We see {{examples}} of this homesick imagination in <b>her</b> <b>poem</b> “Dialogue Between Old England and New” which emphasizes {{the relationship between the}} motherland and the colonies as parental; and gives assurance that the bond between the two countries will continue. It also implies that whatever happens to England will also affect America. The poem often refers to England as “mother” and America as “Daughter”, which emphasizes the bond Bradstreet feels herself to her home country.|$|E

50|$|Some of <b>her</b> <b>poems</b> were anthologised {{in books}} of New Zealand poems by Chapman, Bennett and Vincent O’Sullivan, {{but none of}} <b>her</b> <b>poems</b> were {{included}} in Allen Curnows influential 1960 Penguin anthology because of a disagreement over selection of them. Her reputation declined after her death, from her association with the English Georgian poets and with the inclusion of some of <b>her</b> <b>poems</b> in the 1930 anthology Kowhai Gold which was rather self-consciously New Zealand.|$|R
25|$|In an {{era when}} women had to tread {{carefully}} in society's orbit, Seward struck a middle ground. In her work, Seward could be alternately arch and teasing, as in <b>her</b> <b>poem</b> entitled Portrait of Miss Levett, {{on the subject of}} a Lichfield beauty later married to Rev. Richard Levett. She contributed to Boswell's Life of Samuel Johnson (1791) but was not particularly happy with the way her material was treated by Boswell. Her work was widely circulated.|$|E
25|$|In {{her first}} {{collection}}, Standing Female Nude (1985), {{she uses the}} voices of outsiders, for example in the poems 'Education for Leisure' and 'Dear Norman'. Her next collection Feminine Gospels (2002) continues this vein, showing an increased interest in long narrative poems, accessible in style and often surreal in their imagery. Her 2005 publication, Rapture (2005), {{is a series of}} intimate poems charting the course of a love affair, for which she won the £10,000 T.S. Eliot Prize. In 2007, she published The Hat, a collection of poems for children. Online copies of her poems are rare, but <b>her</b> <b>poem</b> dedicated to U A Fanthorpe, Premonitions, is available through The Guardian, and several others via The Daily Mirror.|$|E
25|$|Seward was {{the eldest}} of two {{surviving}} daughters of Thomas Seward (1708–1790), prebendary of Lichfield and Salisbury, and author, and his wife Elizabeth. Elizabeth Seward later had three further children (John, Jane and Elizabeth) who all died in infancy, and two stillbirths. Anna Seward mourned their loss in <b>her</b> <b>poem</b> Eyam (1788). Born in 1742 at Eyam, a small mining village in the Peak District of Derbyshire where her father was the rector, she and her sister, Sarah some sixteen months younger than she was, passed nearly all their life in the relatively small area of the Peak District of Derbyshire and Lichfield, a cathedral city in the adjacent county of Staffordshire to the west, an area now corresponding to the boundary of the East Midlands and West Midlands regions.|$|E

50|$|<b>Her</b> next <b>poem,</b> 'Maughold Head', was {{published}} {{at the start}} of February 1950, after which <b>her</b> <b>poems</b> were published regularly in the Ramsey Courier. <b>Her</b> first published <b>poem</b> in the Anglo-Manx dialect was 'A Lament', which appeared in September 1950. <b>Her</b> <b>poems</b> were quickly picked up as special evocations of the Isle of Man and they were recited at meetings of Manx Societies in England alongside poems by the Manx National Poet, T. E. Brown, as early as November 1951. <b>Her</b> <b>poems,</b> 'Maughold Head' and 'In Exile', were set to music by C. Sydney Marshall and had been cut to record by February 1960.|$|R
25|$|In 1749 {{her father}} was {{appointed}} to a position as Canon-Residentiary at Lichfield Cathedral and {{the family moved to}} that city, where her father educated her entirely at home. They lived in the Bishop's Palace in the Cathedral Close. When a family friend, Mrs. Edward Sneyd, died in 1756, the Sewards took in one of her daughters, Honora Sneyd, who became an 'adopted' foster sister to Anna. Honora was nine years younger than Anna. Anna Seward describes how she and her sister first met Honora, on returning from a walk, in <b>her</b> <b>poem</b> The Anniversary (1769). Sarah (known as 'Sally') died suddenly at the age of nineteen of typhus (1764). Sarah was said to be of admirable character, but less talented than her sister. Anna consoled herself with her affection for Honora Sneyd, as she describes in Visions, written a few days after her sister's death. In the poem she expresses the hope that Honora ('this transplanted flower') will replace her sister (whom she refers to as 'Alinda') in her and her parents affections.|$|E

500|$|Early in {{her writing}} career, Angelou began {{alternating}} {{the publication of}} an autobiography and a volume of poetry. [...] Her publisher, Random House, placed the poems in Diiie, along with her next four volumes, in her first collection of poetry, The Complete Collected Poems of Maya Angelou (1994), perhaps to capitalize on her popularity following her reading of <b>her</b> <b>poem</b> [...] "On the Pulse of Morning" [...] at President Bill Clinton's inauguration in 1993. [...] A year later, in 1995, Angelou's publisher placed four more poems in a smaller volume, entitled Phenomenal Woman.|$|E
50|$|Shange is also {{incredibly}} {{influenced by}} music, particularly Jazz and Blues artists. <b>Her</b> <b>poems</b> are lyrical and sometimes {{reminiscent of the}} style of improvisation in jazz. i live in music, for instance, is explicitly about Shange's love of music, and doesn't stick to a particular rhythm or meter (like most of <b>her</b> <b>poems).</b> Shange recorded a version of i live in music accompanied by the William Goffigan Ensemble, which demonstrates both the connection between <b>her</b> <b>poems</b> and music, and her poetry's innate musicality.|$|R

500|$|According to Lupton, [...] "On the Pulse of Morning" [...] is Angelou's {{most famous}} poem. Lupton {{has argued that}} [...] "Angelou's {{ultimate}} greatness will be attributed" [...] to the poem, and that Angelou's [...] "theatrical" [...] performance of it, using skills she learned as an actor and speaker, marked {{a return to the}} African-American oral tradition of speakers such as Frederick Douglass, Martin Luther King, Jr. and Malcolm X. British reporter Kate Kellaway compared Angelou's appearance as she read the poem at Clinton's inauguration with the eight-year-old child in Caged Bird, noting that the coats she wore in both occasions were similar: [...] "She looked magnificent, sternly theatrical with an unsmiling bow mouth. She wore a coat with brass buttons, a strange reminder of the eight-year-old Maya Angelou who stood in a courtroom, terrified {{at the sight of the}} man who had raped her". Gillespie stated regarding Kellaway's observations: [...] "But standing tall on the steps of the Capitol, she was light-years removed from that terrible time, and America was no longer an 'unfriendly place.' <b>Her</b> <b>poem</b> 'On the Pulse of Morning' was a soaring call for peace, justice, and harmony. Capturing the hope embodied in the human spirit, it was a solemn and joyful reminder that all things are possible. She wished us 'Good morning' in <b>her</b> <b>poem,</b> and one felt as if a new day was truly dawning." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1993, Angelou recited <b>her</b> <b>poem</b> [...] "On the Pulse of Morning" [...] at {{the inauguration}} of President Bill Clinton, {{becoming}} the first poet to make an inaugural recitation since Robert Frost at President John F. Kennedy's inauguration in 1961. [...] Her recitation resulted in more fame and recognition for her previous works, and broadened her appeal [...] "across racial, economic, and educational boundaries". The recording of the poem won a Grammy Award. In June 1995, she delivered what Richard Long called her [...] "second 'public' poem", titled [...] "A Brave and Startling Truth", which commemorated the 50th anniversary of the United Nations.|$|E
