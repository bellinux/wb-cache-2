5|$|After {{considerable}} {{debate and}} various experiments, {{the law was}} changed again in 1972. In an attempt to reduce pad-play the new version, {{which is used to}} this day, allowed batsmen to be out lbw in some circumstances if they did not attempt to hit the ball with their bat. Since the 1990s, the availability of television replays and, later, ball-tracking technology to assist umpires <b>has</b> <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> percentage of lbws in major matches. However, the accuracy of the technology and the consequences of its use remain controversial.|$|E
5|$|Another {{increasing}} {{issue is}} the rise in conditional cash transfer programs in Latin America, such as the Oportunidades program in Mexico. Although this program is meant to provide poor families {{with an increase in}} income, the conditionalities has led to a time poverty for the family members who are in charge of fulfilling the conditions, most oftentimes the woman.

5|$|Demand from {{middlemen}} {{and specialized}} animal trade mafias <b>has</b> <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> profitability of slow loris hunting and driven many hunters to catch any they spot by climbing or shaking trees. In the Mondulkiri Province in Cambodia, slow lorises are shaken out {{of trees and}} then bludgeoned {{to death with a}} stick. In Indonesia, slow lorises are worth more alive, so hunters climb the tree to reach them and place a V-shaped stick around their neck to immobilize them. If the slow loris is found in with an infant, the parent is often killed.|$|E
5|$|Infections {{are most}} {{commonly}} {{acquired in the}} urban environment. In recent decades, the expansion of villages, towns and cities in {{the areas in which}} it is common, and the increased mobility of people <b>has</b> <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> number of epidemics and circulating viruses. Dengue fever, which was once confined to Southeast Asia, has now spread to Southern China, countries in the Pacific Ocean and America, and might pose a threat to Europe.|$|E
5|$|Some species {{including}} honey bees, bumblebees, and stingless bees live socially in colonies. Bees are {{adapted for}} feeding on nectar and pollen, the former primarily as an energy source {{and the latter}} primarily for protein and other nutrients. Most pollen is used as food for larvae. Bee pollination is important both ecologically and commercially; the decline in wild bees <b>has</b> <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> value of pollination by commercially managed hives of honey bees.|$|E

5|$|The New Zealand Post Office had a {{monopoly}} over telecommunications until 1987 when Telecom New Zealand was formed, initially as a state-owned enterprise and then privatised in 1990.

5|$|The {{floating}} bridges carry Interstate 90 and State Route 520 across Lake Washington to the Eastside suburbs. The SR 520 Albert D. Rosellini Evergreen Point Floating Bridge, {{which opened}} in 2016 as the replacement for another floating bridge at the same site, is the longest floating bridge in the world. The Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge had previously been replaced after the original span sunk in 1990 when water filled an open maintenance hatch during refurbishing. Age and the 2001 Nisqually earthquake have damaged several other spans. The risk of future earthquakes <b>has</b> <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> need to replace already deteriorated bridges in the city, such as the Alaskan Way Viaduct and the Magnolia Bridge.|$|E
5|$|The spongy {{bones of}} the woodpecker's skull and the {{flexibility}} of its beak, both of which provide protection for the brain when drumming, have provided inspiration to engineers; a black box needs to survive intact when a plane falls from the sky, and modelling the black box with regard to a woodpecker's anatomy <b>has</b> <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> resistance of this device to damage sixty-fold. The design of protective helmets is another field being influenced by the study of woodpeckers.|$|E

5|$|In Malaysia, {{large areas}} of {{rainforest}} were felled {{to make way for}} oil palm plantations and with few tree cavities for breeding, the barn owl population, with its ability to control rodent pests, diminished. The provision of two hundred nest boxes in a trial saw almost one hundred percent occupancy and as the programme expanded, the plantations supported one of the densest barn owl populations in the world. Similarly, providing nesting boxes <b>has</b> <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> number of barn owls in rice-growing areas of Malaysia where the rodents do much damage to the crop. However, although barn owl numbers have increased in both these instances, it is unclear as to how effective this biological control of the rats is as compared to the trapping and baiting that occurred previously.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} {{justification for}} the GRC scheme is to entrench minority representation in Parliament. However, opposition parties have questioned the usefulness of GRCs in fulfilling this purpose, especially since Singapore has not faced the issue of minorities being under-represented in Parliament. In fact, statistics show that all PAP minority candidates have won regularly {{and that the only}} two MPs to lose their seats in 1984 were Chinese. One of them was beaten by a minority candidate. In addition, Joshua Benjamin Jeyaratnam of the Workers' Party of Singapore won a by-election in 1981 at Anson, a largely Chinese constituency, and the first elected Chief Minister of Singapore was David Marshall who was Jewish. Technically, as the size of GRCs <b>has</b> <b>increased,</b> <b>the</b> minority has had less representation overall as the proportion of minority MPs per GRC has been reduced. Since minority MPs are a numerical minority in Parliament, their political clout has also been reduced.|$|E
5|$|The weak {{magnetosphere}} around Venus {{means that}} the solar wind is interacting directly with its outer atmosphere. Here, ions of hydrogen and oxygen are being created by the dissociation of neutral molecules from ultraviolet radiation. The solar wind then supplies energy that gives some of these ions sufficient velocity to escape Venus's gravity field. This erosion process results in a steady loss of low-mass hydrogen, helium, and oxygen ions, whereas higher-mass molecules, such as carbon dioxide, {{are more likely to}} be retained. Atmospheric erosion by the solar wind probably led to the loss of most of Venus's water during the first billion years after it formed. The erosion <b>has</b> <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> ratio of higher-mass deuterium to lower-mass hydrogen in the atmosphere 100 times compared to the rest of the solar system.|$|E
