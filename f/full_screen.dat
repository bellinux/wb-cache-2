5|$|On January 21, 2003, Universal Pictures {{released}} The Bourne Identity in the U.S. on VHS {{as well as}} on DVD in two formats: a single-disc widescreen collector's edition and a single-disc <b>full</b> <b>screen</b> collector's edition. Both contain supplemental materials {{including a}} making-of documentary, a commentary from director Doug Liman and deleted scenes. On July 13, 2004, Universal released a new DVD of the film in the U.S. in preparation for the sequel's cinema debut. This DVD came in the same two formats: a single-disc widescreen (Extended edition) and a single-disc <b>full</b> <b>screen</b> (Extended edition). Both contain supplemental materials including interviews with Matt Damon, deleted scenes, alternative opening and ending, a documentary on the consulate fight and information features on the CIA and amnesia. The alternate ending on the DVD has Bourne collapsing during the search for Marie, waking up with Abbott standing over him, and getting an offer to return to the CIA. Neither contain the commentary or DTS tracks present in the collector's edition. The film was also released on UMD for Sony's PlayStation Portable on August 30, 2005 and on HD DVD on July 24, 2007. With the release of The Bourne Ultimatum on DVD, a new DVD of The Bourne Identity was included in a boxed set with The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum. The boxed set is entitled The Jason Bourne Collection. A trilogy set was released on Blu-ray in January 2009.|$|E
40|$|The social {{acceptability}} {{and durability}} of two house screening interventions were addressed using focus group discussions, questionnaires, indoor climate measurements, and durability surveys. Participants recognized that screening stopped mosquitoes (79 – 96 %) and other insects (86 – 98 %) entering their houses. These {{and other benefits}} were appreciated by significantly more recipients of <b>full</b> <b>screening</b> than users of <b>screened</b> ceilings. <b>Full</b> <b>screened</b> houses were 0. 26 °C hotter at night (P = 0. 05) than houses with screened ceilings and 0. 51 °C (P < 0. 001) hotter than houses with no screening (28. 43 °C), though only 9 % of <b>full</b> <b>screened</b> house users and 17 % of screened ceiling users complained about the heat. Although 71 % of screened doors and 85 % of ceilings had suffered some damage after 12 months, {{the average number of}} holes of any size was < 5 for doors and < 7 for ceilings. In conclusion, house screening is a well-appreciated and durable vector control tool...|$|R

5|$|A major concept used in {{the series}} {{was the idea of}} a running clock. This {{initially}} came from Joel Surnow, who wanted the audience to always know what time it was in the show's fictional timeline. This was done by an on-screen digital clock that appears before and after commercial breaks, and a smaller clock also appears at other points in the narrative. The time shown is the in-universe time of the story. When the running clock is shown <b>full</b> <b>screen,</b> an alternating pulsating beeping noise (like the kind seen on a time bomb) for each second can usually be heard. On rare occasions, a silent clock is used. This usually follows the death of a major character or an otherwise dramatic event.|$|E

The effect of these processes on the line shape of the muonic x rays is studied here. Equations for the electron 1 s-level population and for the muonic-x-ray center of gravity are derived and applied to representative examples of medium- and high-Z muonic atoms.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundHouse {{screening}} should {{protect people}} against malaria. We assessed whether {{two types of}} house screening—full screening of windows, doors, and closing eaves, or installation of screened ceilings—could reduce house entry of malaria vectors and frequency of anaemia in children {{in an area of}} seasonal malaria transmission. MethodsDuring 2006 and 2007, 500 occupied houses in and near Farafenni town in The Gambia, an area with low use of insecticide-treated bednets, were randomly assigned to receive <b>full</b> <b>screening,</b> screened ceilings, or no screening (control). Randomisation was done by computer-generated list, in permuted blocks of five houses in the ratio 2 : 2 : 1. Screening was not treated with insecticide. Exposure to mosquitoes indoors was assessed by fortnightly light trap collections during the transmission season. Primary endpoints included the number of female Anopheles gambiae sensu lato mosquitoes collected per trap per night. Secondary endpoints included frequency of anaemia (haemoglobin concentration < 80 g/L) and parasitaemia {{at the end of the}} transmission season in children (aged 6 months to 10 years) who were living in the study houses. Analysis was by modified intention to treat (ITT), including all randomised houses for which there were some outcome data and all children from those houses who were sampled for haemoglobin and parasitaemia. This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN 51184253. Findings 462 houses were included in the modified ITT analysis (<b>full</b> <b>screening,</b> n= 188; screened ceilings, n= 178; control, n= 96). The mean number of A gambiae caught in houses without screening was 37 · 5 per trap per night (95 % CI 31 · 6 – 43 · 3), compared with 15 · 2 (12 · 9 – 17 · 4) in houses with <b>full</b> <b>screening</b> (ratio of means 0 · 41, 95 % CI 0 · 31 – 0 · 54; p< 0 · 0001) and 19 · 1 (16 · 1 – 22 · 1) in houses with screened ceilings (ratio 0 · 53, 0 · 40 – 0 · 70; p< 0 · 0001). 755 children completed the study, of whom 731 had complete clinical and covariate data and were used in the analysis of clinical outcomes. 30 (19 %) of 158 children from control houses had anaemia, compared with 38 (12 %) of 309 from houses with <b>full</b> <b>screening</b> (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0 · 53, 95 % CI 0 · 29 – 0 · 97; p= 0 · 04), and 31 (12 %) of 264 from houses with screened ceilings (OR 0 · 51, 0 · 27 – 0 · 96; p= 0 · 04). Frequency of parasitaemia did not differ between intervention and control groups. InterpretationHouse screening substantially reduced the number of mosquitoes inside houses and could contribute to prevention of anaemia in children. FundingMedical Research Council...|$|R
