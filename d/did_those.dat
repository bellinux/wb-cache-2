5|$|Spanish Florida {{never really}} {{recovered}} its economy or population {{from the effects}} of the war, and it was ceded to Britain in the 1763 Treaty of Paris following the Seven Years' War. Indians who had been resettled along the Atlantic coast chafed under British rule, as <b>did</b> <b>those</b> allied to the British in this war. This discontentment flared into the 1715 Yamasee War that posed a major threat to South Carolina's viability. The loss of population in the Spanish territories contributed to the 1732 founding of the Province of Georgia, which was granted on territory that Spain had originally claimed, as was also the case with Carolina. James Moore took military action against the Tuscaroras of North Carolina in the Tuscarora War which began in 1711, and many of them fled north as refugees to join their linguistic cousins the Iroquois.|$|E

25|$|The {{location}} of the bomb inside the bus meant {{the front of the}} vehicle remained mostly intact. Most of the passengers {{at the front of the}} top deck survived, as <b>did</b> <b>those</b> near the front of the lower deck, including the driver, but those at the rear of the bus suffered more serious injuries. The extent of the damage caused to the victims' bodies resulted in a lengthy delay in announcing the death toll from the bombing while the police determined how many bodies were present and whether the bomber was one of them. Several passers-by were also injured by the explosion and surrounding buildings were damaged by debris.|$|E

25|$|Differences {{lie in the}} {{presentation}} of megaloblastic anemia induced by either folate or B12 deficiency. Megaloblastic anemia related to deficiency in B12 generally results in peripheral neuropathy, whereas folate-related anemia often results in affective, or mood disorders. Neurological effects are not often associated with folate-related megaloblastic anemia, although demyelinating disorders may eventually present. In one study, mood disturbances were recorded {{for the majority of}} patients presenting with megaloblastic anemia in the absence of B12 deficiency. In addition, folate concentrations within blood plasma {{have been found to be}} lower in patients with both unipolar and bipolar depressive disorders when compared with control groups. In addition, depressive groups with low folate concentrations responded less well to standard antidepressant therapy than <b>did</b> <b>those</b> with normal levels within plasma. However, replication of these findings are less robust.|$|E
25|$|There was however {{one huge}} {{improvement}} created by Wyatt – the cloisters. This two-storeyed gallery {{which was built}} around all four sides of the inner courtyard, provided the house with not only the much needed corridors to link the rooms, but also a magnificent gallery to display the Pembroke collection of classical sculpture. Wyatt died before completion, but not before he and Lord Pembroke had quarrelled over the designs and building work. The final touches were executed by Wyatt's nephew Sir Jeffry Wyatville. Today nearly two hundred years later Wyatt's improvements do not jar the senses {{as much as they}} <b>did</b> <b>those</b> of the great architectural commentators James Lees-Milne and Sir Sacheverell Sitwell writing in the 1960s. That Wyatt's works are not in the same league of style as the south front, and the Tudor tower, is perhaps something for future generations to judge.|$|E
25|$|The {{promulgation}} of law for {{the protection}} of a position held purely on religious grounds cannot therefore be justified. It is irrational, as preferring the subjective over the objective. But it is also divisive, capricious and arbitrary. We do not live in a society where all the people share uniform religious beliefs. The precepts of any one religion – any belief system – cannot, by force of their religious origins, sound any louder in the general law than the precepts of any other. If they <b>did,</b> <b>those</b> out in the cold would be less than citizens; and our constitution would be {{on the way to a}} theocracy, which is of necessity autocratic. The law of a theocracy is dictated without option to the people, not made by their judges and governments. The individual conscience is free to accept such dictated law; but the State, if its people are to be free, has the burdensome duty of thinking for itself.|$|E

25|$|In {{the course}} of this short prelude, the {{batteries}} ranged along the little eminences which rose {{on either side of the}} valley of the Ligny, opened a furious cannonade along the whole extent of the front lines of the contending armies. Ligny, as also Saint-Amand (when repossessed by the Prussians), both of which lay so directly under the French guns, seemed devoted to destruction. Their defenders, sheltered in a great degree by stone walls, hollow ways, and banked up hedges, appeared perfectly motionless while the deluge of shot and shell poured fast and thick around them; but no sooner <b>did</b> <b>those</b> in Ligny discover a dusky mass emerging from the clouds of smoke which enveloped the heights above them, and wending its course downwards upon the lower portion of the village, than they rushed out of their concealment, and lining with their advanced skirmishers the outermost enclosures, prepared to meet the onset which would probably bring them into closer contact with the French, and lead to a struggle in which physical strength and innate courage combined with individual skill and dexterity, might effect a result unattainable by a recourse to projectiles alone.|$|E
25|$|The {{intended}} {{mission of}} the college's former patron, the Congregation of the Christian Brothers established in 1902 by Edmund Ignatius Rice, was the education of poor boys in Ireland by providing them with basic levels of literacy. This was the broad aim of the school when it opened its doors in 1856 at Eblana Avenue {{in what was then}} known as Kingstown (now Dún Laoghaire), a port town south of Dublin City. As the years went by, the aims of the Christian Brothers got broader and with it so <b>did</b> <b>those</b> of the Dún Laoghaire school. By the 1920s, the school was preparing boys for the state examinations and sending increasing number of students to third level. The growth in population in Dún Laoghaire, with an increasing Catholic middle class demographic, led to an increase in the demand for the school. To that end, a decision was made to procure Monkstown Park in 1949 and to move the entire secondary department to this location. The school then in effect split, with the secondary department (now known as C.B.C. Monkstown) moving location while the primary school (known as C.B.S. Eblana Avenue) remained at the original site. A private junior school was then opened at the Monkstown College with Eblana Avenue taking secondary students again from 1954.|$|E

[...] He paid for thousands of copies of McKinley's speeches to be printed, and shipped quantities of McKinley posters, badges, and buttons across the nation. [...] New Hampshire Senator William E.

500|$|Today Glastonbury Abbey {{presents}} itself as [...] "traditionally the oldest above-ground Christian {{church in the}} world," [...] which according to the legend was built at Joseph's behest to house the Holy Grail, 65 or so years {{after the death of}} Jesus. The legend also says that as a child, Jesus had visited Glastonbury along with Joseph. The legend probably was encouraged during the medieval period when religious relics and pilgrimages were profitable business for abbeys. William Blake mentioned the legend in a poem that became a popular hymn, [...] "Jerusalem" [...] (see And <b>did</b> <b>those</b> feet in ancient time).|$|E

[...] Jolie later donated $200,000 to The Malala Fund for girls education. Former First Lady of the United States Laura Bush wrote an op-ed piece in The Washington Post in which she compared Yousafzai to Holocaust diarist Anne Frank. Indian director Amjad Khan announced that he would be making a biographical film based on Yousafzai.|$|E
500|$|The {{tour for}} the Foo Fighters' fifth album, In Your Honor, had both {{acoustic}} and electric shows {{to fit the}} song variety in that record.

Grohl took this advice when composing his following album. Grohl added that [...] "we didn't plan the new album to be half rock and half acoustic", picking the songs the band considered the best, with [...] "demos which ranged from psycho fucking Nomeansno to sloppy, Tom Petty country to fucking piano-driven songs".|$|E

500|$|Even as Rhodes and {{his school}} wrote, {{another group of}} historians was setting out on the full {{rehabilitation}} of Johnson, using {{for the first time}} primary sources such as his papers, provided by his daughter Martha before her death in 1901, and the diaries of Johnson's Navy Secretary, Gideon Welles, first published in 1911. The resulting volumes, such as David Miller DeWitt's The Impeachment and Trial of President Andrew Johnson (1903), presented him far more favorably than they <b>did</b> <b>those</b> who had sought to oust him. In James Schouler's 1913 History of the Reconstruction Period, the author accused Rhodes of being [...] "quite unfair to Johnson", though agreeing that the former president had created many of his own problems through inept political moves. These works had an effect; although historians continued to view Johnson as having deep flaws which sabotaged his presidency, they saw his Reconstruction policies as fundamentally correct.|$|E
500|$|Wilson {{was born}} in Winchester, Massachusetts on March 16, 1982. While he was in second grade, he moved to Londonderry, New Hampshire. Today, he talks little of his {{childhood}} except to discuss his father, Mike Wilson, who was an Air Force veteran and a demanding perfectionist. During fall, he would have Brian bag leaves and bury them in the woods; and in winter, he would have Brian spend seven hours shoveling snow on weekends. Brian said in a 2011 interview, [...] "I think that's how {{you need to be}} raised. It's not your friend, it's your dad. And he's going to be strict. And one day you're going to understand why. And sometimes, it's a little too late. They might pass away, and you might not get that chance to say thanks or understand why you <b>did</b> <b>those</b> things. But when you become a man, you understand why." ...|$|E
500|$|King Charles II patronised Cresswell's establishments, as he <b>did</b> <b>those</b> of Madam Damaris Page; he {{declared}} Cresswell's to be [...] "a Sound organisation". She became {{as well known}} as the politicians of her time, largely shielded from legal proceedings by her extensive London network of clients across the court, the guilds and government. Her increasing immunity from prosecution furthered her stature as a hate figure, particularly with the many thousands of London apprentices who could not afford her bawds, and bound {{by the terms of}} their contracts, were forbidden to marry. The houses of Cresswell and Page were a target for the 1668 Bawdy House Riots that swept London. Starting on Shrove Tuesday, the rioting lasted for five days, as young apprentices burnt and smashed the royally supported brothels. To some, the brothels symbolised Charles's continental style court: licentious and awash with unaffordable debauchery. The apprentices attacked her [...] "cathouse" [...] in Moorfields, assaulting the women, tearing up the bedding, looting the property and destroying the building.|$|E
