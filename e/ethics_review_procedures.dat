40|$|The {{ethics and}} {{governance}} {{of research in}} children’s services raise particular issues. These include the governance of access to children, and ethical issues such as consent. In addition, since 2003, there have been major reforms {{in the way that}} children’s services are planned and delivered in central and local government. Children’s services in England comprise a very varied constituency, ranging from lone providers to institutional provision, and including private, voluntary and public sector provision. In 2009, following a period of informal consultation with key stakeholders, the former DCSF commissioned this research which aimed to identify and evaluate existing arrangements for research governance and ethics review in children’s services in England. It also aimed to make recommendations for the future development of those governance arrangements with the overall goal of ensuring a more coherent and transparent system. The first stage of the work involved thorough scoping reviews of relevant research literature on ethics issues in research with children and young people, and of initiatives relating to research governance and <b>ethics</b> <b>review</b> <b>procedures.</b> At the same time, an electronic survey was circulated by email to all 152 local authority Children’s Services Directorates...|$|E
40|$|To date {{there is}} no {{established}} consensus of assessment criteria for evaluating research ethics review. We conducted a scoping review of empirical research assessing ethics review processes {{in order to identify}} common elements assessed, research foci, and research gaps to aid in the development of assessment criteria. Electronic searches of Ovid Medline, PsychInfo, and the Cochrane DSR, ACP Journal Club, DARE, CCTR, CMR, HTA, and NHSEED, were conducted. After de-duplication, 4234 titles and abstracts were reviewed. Altogether 4036 articles were excluded following screening of titles, abstracts and full text. A total of 198 articles included for final data extraction. Few studies originated from outside North America and Europe. No study reported using an underlying theory or framework of quality/effectiveness to guide study design or analyses. We did not identify any studies that had involved a controlled trial [...] randomised or otherwise [...] of <b>ethics</b> <b>review</b> <b>procedures</b> or processes. Studies varied substantially with respect to outcomes assessed, although tended to focus on structure and timeliness of ethics review. Our findings indicate a lack of consensus on appropriate assessment criteria, exemplified by the varied study outcomes identified, but also a fragmented body of research. To date research has been largely quantitative, with little attention given to stakeholder experiences, and is largely cross sectional. A lack of longitudinal research to date precludes analyses of change or assessment of quality improvement in ethics review...|$|E
40|$|This article explores a {{range of}} ethical issues that arise in {{community-based}} participatory research (CBPR), drawing on literature and examples from practice. The experience of CBPR practitioners adds further weight to the growing critique by many other social researchers of regulatory approaches to research ethics (which focus on rule following in accordance with research governance frameworks, codes of conduct and <b>ethics</b> <b>review</b> <b>procedures).</b> Yet, whilst many of the ethical challenges in CBPR are common to social research generally (informed consent, anonymity, issues of ownership of data and findings), the dynamic, complex and value-based nature of CBPR gives them particular prominence. There are also specific issues relating to the ethics of partnership working, collaboration, blurring of boundaries between researchers and researched, community rights, community conflict and democratic participation that are more frequently encountered in CBPR. Four practice examples are used to demonstrate this argument. These are taken from a young women's community allotment, a community organisation researching poverty, a youth peer research project and a museum-based digital storytelling project. The article concludes that current institutional ethical codes, guidelines and ethical review procedures are not particularly well-suited to CBPR, in that they adopt principle-based and regulatory approaches to ethics; whereas character- and relationship-based approaches to ethics are also very important in CBPR, which is adopted by many researchers with a strong value commitment to social justice...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to describe the}} performance of health research <b>ethics</b> <b>review</b> <b>procedures</b> of six research centres in Tanzania. Data collection was done through a self-administered questionnaire and personal interviews. The results showed that there were on average 11 members (range = 8 - 14) in each Research Ethic Committee. However, female representation in the committees was low (15. 2 %). The largest proportion of the committee members was biomedical scientists (51. 5 %). Others included medical doctors (19. 7 %), social scientists (7. 6 %), laboratory technologists (10. 6 %), religious leaders (4. 5 %), statisticians (3. 0 %), teachers (1. 5 %) and lawyers (1. 5). Committee members had different capacities to carry out review of research proposals (no capacity= 2 %; limited capacity= 15 %; moderate capacity= 20 %; good capacity= 48 %, excellent capacity= 13 %). Only {{half of the respondents}} had prior ethics review training. Although the majority deemed that ethical guidelines were very important (66 %), there were challenges in the use of ethical guidelines which included lack of awareness on the national accreditation mechanisms for ethics committee (59 %). Adherence to ethical principles and regulations was influenced by being a scientist (OR = 42. 47), being an employee of a professional organization (OR = 15. 25), and having an interests in the use of ethical guidelines (OR = 10. 85) These findings indicate the need for capacity strengthening (through training and resource support), inclusion of more female representation and other mandatory professions to the research ethics committees...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Atoifi Adventist Hospital is a 90 bed general {{hospital}} in East Kwaio, Malaita, Solomon Islands {{providing services to}} the population of subsistence villagers of the region. Health professionals {{at the hospital and}} attached College of Nursing have considerable human capacity and willingness to undertake health research. However they are constrained by limited research experience, training opportunities, research systems, physical infrastructure and access to resources. This brief commentary describes an 'Introduction to Health Research' workshop delivered at Atoifi Adventist Hospital in September 2009 and efforts to move from 'research workshop' to 'research work'. The Approach Using a participatory-action research approach underpinned by decolonising methodologies, staff from Atoifi Adventist Hospital and James Cook University (Queensland, Australia) collaboratively designed, implemented and evaluated a health research workshop. Basic health research principles and methods were presented using active learning methodologies. Following the workshop, Atoifi Adventist Hospital and Atoifi College of Nursing staff, other professionals and community members reported an increased awareness and understanding of health research. The formation of a local Research Committee, improved <b>ethics</b> <b>review</b> <b>procedures</b> and the identification of local research mentors followed the week long workshop. The workshop has acted as a catalyst for research activity, increasing structural and human resource capacity for local health professionals and community leaders to engage in research. Discussion and Conclusions Participants from a variety of educational backgrounds participated in, and received benefit from, a responsive, culturally and linguistically accessible health research workshop. Improving health research systems at a remote hospital and aligning these with local and national research agendas is establishing a base to strengthen public health research and practice on Malaita, Solomon Islands...|$|E
40|$|Information and Communications Technology (ICT) is {{a concept}} that {{represents}} the convergence of some defining technologies of our time (information technology, computer technology and media technology) and the increasing influences its research and usage have on the society today. With such distinctive features as pervasiveness, ubiquity, malleability, interactivity, augmentation, autonomy and virtualization, ICT research and usage provide an array of ethical and social challenges. However, most contemporary research on ICT ethics concentrates only either on the usage of ICT artefacts or on questions that raise significant theoretical or practical interest such as ICT implants or eHealth. There has been little research on the ethical and social issues associated with research and development. This research draws attention back to the beginning- research and development. It seeks to find out how ethical issues are considered in ICT research being carried out in the UK computing departments/faculties. It investigates {{the current state of the}} art with regard to ethics reviews of ICT research through establishing its relevance, availability and effectiveness. The fact that high quality researches (including European projects) in ICT are currently being carried out in so many UK computing departments, which also produce engineers for IT companies, justifies the choice of the UK in this research. Even though a quantitative tool of questionnaire was used as part of the data collection methods, the interpretive and subjective nature of this research find reference in the use of interviews for the main data collection and dialectical hermeneutics for data analysis. Through a dialectical hermeneutic process, the different understandings on availability, relevance and effectiveness of ethics reviews of ICT research emerged. These understandings showed the strengths and weaknesses of the current <b>ethics</b> <b>review</b> <b>procedures</b> in the UK computing departments which provided the basis for relevant recommendations to policy makers.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we examine “ethics creep”, a concept {{developed}} by Haggerty (2004) {{to account for}} the increasing bureaucratization of research ethics boards and institutional review boards (REB/IRBs) and the expanding reach of <b>ethics</b> <b>review.</b> We start with an overview of the recent surge of academic interest in ethics creep and similar arguments about the prohibitive effect of <b>ethics</b> <b>review.</b> We then introduce elements of Michel Foucault's theoretical framework which are used to inform our analysis of empirical data drawn from a multi-phase study exploring the accessibility of community-engaged research within existing <b>ethics</b> <b>review</b> structures in Canada. First, we present how ethics creep emerged both explicitly and implicitly in our data. We then present data that demonstrate how REB/IRBs are experiencing their own form of regulation. Finally, we present data that situate <b>ethics</b> <b>review</b> alongside other trends affecting the academy. Our results show that <b>ethics</b> <b>review</b> is growing in some ways while simultaneously being constrained in others. Drawing on Foucauldian theory we reframe ethics creep as a repressive hypothesis which belies the complexity of the phenomenon it purports to explain. Our discussion complicates ethics creep by proposing an understanding of REB/IRBs that locates them at the intersection of various neoliberal discourses about the role of science, ethics, and knowledge production...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to answer the question, “does the <b>ethics</b> committee <b>review</b> process in Malaysia provide meaningful protection to mentally incapacitated adults who enrol in clinical research trials?” This question is answered by examining three {{important aspects of the}} <b>ethics</b> <b>review</b> process. First, the quality of the deliberations of ethics committees is examined by looking at the underlying principles that are meant to guide ethics decision-making. Second, the thesis looks at the current regulatory framework under which ethics committees operate and considers the adequacy of these guidelines in protecting human subjects. Finally, this thesis considers the notion of conflicts of interests in the clinical trials arena and calls into question the independence of the <b>ethics</b> <b>review</b> process and how this impacts on the interests of human subjects in general and mentally incapacitated adults in particular. The conclusion reached {{at the end of this}} thesis is that the <b>ethics</b> <b>review</b> process in Malaysia fails adequately to provide meaningful protection to mentally incapacitated adults. While the reasons for this are many, several factors are particularly significant, namely, the creation of a globalised clinical trials market, the lack of formal and systematic training of ethics committee members and the institutional structures of ethics committees. Although the main focus of this thesis is the Malaysian <b>ethics</b> <b>review</b> process, many of the comments and discussions put forward in this thesis are highly relevant to the <b>ethics</b> <b>review</b> processes in other jurisdictions given the international regulatory scheme that currently governs the conduct of clinical trials in many parts of the world...|$|R
