5|$|In {{over one}} or more sittings, a highly skilled {{sculptor}} from Madame Tussauds Studios who is given {{direct access to the}} celebrity will record the colours of the <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> <b>eyes,</b> and over 500 precise body measurements are referenced. Most important is to capture the look of the celebrity to reflect the personality of each unique individual. The next task is to make a clay model of the head and body which is used to create a mould. Wax cast of the head and hands are made from the mould, and the eyes are inserted. Each eye is hand-painted to achieve a perfect match of the original. Real human hair is then inserted painstakingly strand by strand.|$|E
25|$|In the American {{mass media}} {{as well as}} popular culture, Hispanic is often {{incorrectly}} used to describe a subject's race or physical appearance. In general, Hispanics are assumed to have traits such as dark <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> <b>eyes,</b> and brown or olive skin. Many others are viewed as physically intermediate between whites, blacks and/or Amerindians.|$|E

25|$|Some Uyghur {{scholars}} claim modern Uyghurs {{descent from}} both the Turkic Uyghurs and the pre-Turkic Tocharians (Yuezhi), and relatively fair <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> <b>eyes,</b> {{as well as other}} so-called 'Caucasoid' physical traits, are not uncommon among Uyghurs.

40|$|We {{identified}} the genetic variants for eye color by Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) in a Dutch Caucasian family-based population sample {{and examined the}} genetic correlation between <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> <b>eye</b> color using data from unrelated participants from the Netherlands Twin Register. With the Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis software package, we found strong genetic correlations between various combinations of <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> <b>eye</b> colors. The strongest positive correlations were found for blue eyes with blond <b>hair</b> (0. 87) <b>and</b> brown <b>eyes</b> with dark hair (0. 71), whereas blue <b>eyes</b> with dark <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> brown <b>eyes</b> with blond hair showed the strongest negative correlations (- 0. 64 and - 0. 94, respectively). Red hair with green/hazel eyes showed the weakest correlation (- 0. 14). All analyses were corrected for age and sex, and we explored the effects of correcting for principal components (PCs) that represent ancestry and describe the genetic stratification of the Netherlands. When including the first three PCs as covariates, the genetic correlations between the phenotypes disappeared. This is not unexpected since <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> <b>eye</b> colors strongly indicate the ancestry of an individual. This {{makes it difficult to}} separate the effects of population stratification and the true genetic effects of variants on these particular phenotypes...|$|R

40|$|STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Clinicians {{providing}} edentulous {{patients with}} complete dentures are often {{confronted with the}} problem of not knowing the patient's natural tooth color. It would be valuable to be able to determine this from other facial features. PURPOSE: The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the possibility of predicting tooth color in the elderly from <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> <b>eye</b> color, facial skin complexion, and gender. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The lightness (L*), chroma (C*), and hue (h*) of the color of 541 natural teeth were measured for a white study population (94 subjects, 75 to 77 years old, 55. 3 % male) by means of a single measurement with a clinically applicable spectrophotometer. <b>Hair</b> <b>and</b> <b>eye</b> color <b>and</b> facial skin complexion were recorded in categories. Mixed-effects regression models were calculated for each L*, C*, and h* value with <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> <b>eye</b> color, facial skin complexion, and gender as independent variables (alpha=. 05). RESULTS: Only gender <b>and</b> <b>hair</b> color in univariate analysis <b>and,</b> additionally, <b>eye</b> color in multivariate analysis, were significant predictors of tooth color. Higher L* values (lighter color) were associated with lighter <b>eye</b> color <b>and</b> with female gender. The C* value was lower (less saturated) for women. More yellow/green than yellow/red h* values were associated with hair colors other than black and with female gender. However, the parameter estimates of the variables were rather low. CONCLUSIONS: Determination of tooth color from <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> <b>eye</b> color <b>and</b> from gender in the white elderly was only partially possible...|$|R

25|$|Some {{types of}} {{albinism}} affect only {{the skin and}} hair, while other types affect the skin, <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> <b>eyes,</b> and in rare cases only the eyes. All of them are caused by different genetic mutations. Albinism is a recessively inherited trait in humans where both pigmented parents may be carriers of the gene and pass it down to their children. Each child has a 25% chance of being albino and a 75% chance of having normally pigmented skin. One common type of albinism is oculocutaneous albinism or OCA, which has many subtypes caused by different genetic mutations.|$|E
25|$|During the Mexican Revolution, Álvaro Obregón {{invited a}} group of Canadian German-speaking Mennonites to resettle in Mexico. By the late 1920s, some 7,000 had immigrated to Chihuahua State and Durango State, almost all from Canada, only a few from the U.S. and Russia. Today, Mexico {{accounts}} for about 42% of all Mennonites in Latin America. Mennonites in the country stand out because of their fair skin, <b>hair,</b> <b>and</b> <b>eyes.</b> They are a largely insular community that speaks a form of German and wear traditional clothing. They own their own businesses in various communities in Chihuahua, and account for {{about half of the}} state's farm economy, excelling in cheese production.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{following}} Willow's {{reconciliation with}} Tara, Warren (Adam Busch), {{one of the}} Trio, shoots Buffy; a stray shot kills Tara {{right in front of}} Willow. In an explosion of rage and grief, Willow soaks up all the dark magic she can, which turns her <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> <b>eyes</b> black. In the final episodes of the season Willow becomes exceedingly strong, surviving unharmed when Warren hits her in the back with an axe. She hunts Warren, tortures him by slowly pushing a bullet into his body, then kills him by magically flaying him. Unsatisfied, she attempts to kill the other two members of the Trio but is unsuccessful due to her weakening power. She solves this problem by killing her 'dealer' from earlier in the season and draining him of his magic. When she is confronted by Buffy they begin to fight, only to be stopped by Giles who has borrowed magic from a coven of wiccans. Willow successfully drains him of this borrowed magic, fulfilling his plan and causing her to feel all the pain of everyone in the world. She tries to ease the pain by destroying the world, finally to be stopped by Xander.|$|E

40|$|Research {{has shown}} that human {{partners}} are more similar than expected by chance {{on a variety of}} traits. Studies examining <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> <b>eye</b> colour show some evidence of positive assortment. Positive assortment may reflect attraction to self-similar characteristics but is also consistent with attraction to parental traits. Here, we examine self-reported partner <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> <b>eye</b> colour <b>and</b> the influence that own and parental colour characteristics have on these variables. Parental characteristics were found to correlate positively with actual partner characteristics for both men and women. Regression analysis predicting partner characteristics from maternal and paternal traits (which controls for own traits) revealed the greater importance of the opposite-sex parent over the same-sex parent in predicting both <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> <b>eye</b> colour of actual partners. The findings may reflect an influence of parental colour characteristics on human partner choice. Attraction to opposite-sex parental characteristics is seen {{in a wide variety of}} animals where it is usually attributed to imprinting processes in infancy. Although the mechanism is unclear and not necessarily confined to infancy, the data reported here are consistent with a somewhat analogous process to imprinting occurring in humans. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Thorpe {{was elected to the}} club's committee {{at the end of his}} first term; in November 1949 he became its president. Outside Oxford, Thorpe showed a genuine commitment to Liberalism in his enthusiastic contributions to the party's national election campaigns, and on reaching his 21st birthday in April 1950, applied to have his name added to the party's list of possible parliamentary candidates.|$|E

Jim Farber of the New York Daily News described her as [...] "Sporting a thick thatch of wig <b>hair,</b> <b>and</b> <b>eyes</b> darkened by coal-black makeup... sullen and arty... Janet, however, never looked tougher, or more in control." [...] In the video, a sign appears with the logo of the song's title. The scene then changes a spacecraft traveling past Earth before the camera zooms in inside. Then, the lights came on and reveal Michael and Janet inside a small hole. Suddenly, the spacecraft zooms out through the outer part of the galaxy, sending them screaming. In the first verse, Michael {{is seen in the}} room where he is floating on gravity. Then, Michael is shown in a room with thousands of guitars where he breaks one while Janet sings the next verse. Then, it shows Michael dancing on the wall while Janet looks at her nail before playing a game of tag. Then, it shows Michael and Janet in a room where they are using a remote control by changing pictures of Gregory Peck, art painting, statues, etc. Next, it shows both Michael and Janet in the media room where they are playing a video game which Michael wins. Then, Janet sports a skimpy bikini in some scenes while {{at the core of the}} craft, grabs at her breasts, gives the camera a middle finger and simulates male urination where Michael is shown taking controls into some kind of Observation. (In the out-takes, there is a still color photograph of Michael also giving the camera a middle finger.) Meanwhile, Michael is seen in a white room while wearing a black robe where he is meditating before screaming which breaks the glass above him. Then, Michael and Janet perform a dance breakdown. Then, it cuts back to the media room where Janet is dancing with Michael being seen on the television screen while Janet does the same thing with Michael. Then, Michael is seen playing a tennis game where he is using a robotic orb to break jars. The video has influences of Japanese sci-fi Anime - several clips of the Zillion anime series, Vampire Hunter D 1985 movie, and the movie Akira can be seen in the background screens. The version of the video included on Michael Jackson's Vision is uncut and contains the [...] "Stop fucking with me" [...] lyric, which was censored in HIStory on Film, Volume II.|$|E
