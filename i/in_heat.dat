40|$|This paper applies a semi-parametric {{approach}} to estimating a generalised model of investments <b>in</b> <b>heating</b> installations. The {{results suggest that}} marginal costs of investments <b>in</b> <b>heating</b> installations increase quickly at small investment levels, whereas the increase slows down at higher investment levels. Therefore, standard parametric adjustment cost models are probably biased such that they underestimate the costs of small investments and overestimate the costs of large investments. Results also show that investments <b>in</b> <b>heating</b> installations are very responsive to changes in energy prices. Therefore, an energy tax may be an effective instrument to encourage investments <b>in</b> new energy-saving <b>heating</b> installations. Copyright 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. ...|$|R
