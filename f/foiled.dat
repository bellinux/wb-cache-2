40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel technique for joining similar and dissimilar metal <b>foils,</b> namely micro clinching with cutting by laser shock forming. A {{series of experiments}} were conducted to study the deformation behavior of single layer material, during which many important process parameters were determined. The process window of the 1060 pure aluminum <b>foils</b> and annealed copper <b>foils</b> produced by micro clinching with cutting was analyzed. Moreover, similar material combination (annealed copper <b>foils)</b> and dissimilar material combination (1060 pure aluminum <b>foils</b> and 304 stainless steel <b>foils)</b> were successfully achieved. The effect of laser energy on the interlock and minimum thickness of upper <b>foils</b> was investigated. In addition, the mechanical strength of different material combinations joined by micro clinching with cutting was measured in single lap shearing tests. According to the achieved results, this novel technique is more suitable for material combinations where the upper <b>foil</b> is thicker than lower <b>foil.</b> With the increase of laser energy, the interlock increased while the minimum thickness of upper <b>foil</b> decreased gradually. The shear strength of 1060 pure aluminum <b>foils</b> and 304 stainless steel <b>foils</b> combination was three times as large as that of 1060 pure aluminum <b>foils</b> and annealed copper <b>foils</b> combination...|$|R

40|$|<b>Foil</b> {{bearings}} {{are widely}} used for oil-free micro turbomachinery. One of the critical technical issues related to reliability of the <b>foil</b> bearings is a coating wear on the top <b>foil</b> and rotor during start/stops. Bearing cooling is also mandatory for certain applications because the <b>foil</b> bearings can generate significant amount of heat depending on operating conditions. Usually axial flow is used through {{the space between the}} top <b>foil</b> and bearing sleeve. In this thesis, a hybrid air <b>foil</b> bearing with external pressurization is introduced. The hybrid operation eliminates the coating wear during start-up/shut down, and also reduces drag torque during starts. Furthermore, this hybrid <b>foil</b> bearing does not need cooling system. An experimental test with a loaded bearing under hydrostatic mode demonstrates the high potential of hybrid air <b>foil</b> bearings. The load capacity of the hybrid <b>foil</b> bearing was measured at 20, 000 rpm, and compared with that of hydrodynamic <b>foil</b> bearing. The hybrid <b>foil</b> bearing has much higher load capacity than the hydrodynamic <b>foil</b> bearing. The starting torque was also measured and compared with hydrodynamic bearing. A simple analytical model to calculate top <b>foil</b> deflection under hydrostatic pressurization has been developed. Predictions via orbit simulations indicate the hybrid air <b>foil</b> bearings can have a much higher critical speed and onset speed of instability than the hydrodynamic counter part. Major benefits of the hybrid <b>foil</b> bearings also include very low starting torque, reduced wear of the top <b>foil</b> and rotor, and very effective cooling capability by the pressurized air itself. This new concept of hybrid air <b>foil</b> bearings are expected to be widely applied to the oil free turbomachinery industry, especially for heavily loaded and/or high temperature applications...|$|R
