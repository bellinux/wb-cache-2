40|$|High <b>electric</b> field <b>strengths</b> at {{the edge}} of the {{metallization}} of insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) power modules are, besides defects in the substrate or the potting gel, the main reason for partial discharge. These critical <b>electric</b> field <b>strengths</b> occur at the energized contact where it is bordered by the insulating ceramic and the cover (mostly silicone gel). The reduction of high <b>electric</b> field <b>strengths</b> for increasing the threshold voltage for partial discharge has been studied in several publications based on experiments as well as on simulations. Simulations allow the localization of the critical spots and the quantification of the maximum <b>electric</b> field <b>strength.</b> However, a systematic study of the singularities of the <b>electric</b> field <b>strength</b> at the sharp edges is lacking. Such singularities are investigated in this article. The calculation of an absolute <b>electric</b> field <b>strength</b> value is only possible for finite edge radii. For sharp edges, however, the maximum <b>electric</b> field <b>strength</b> returned by simulation depends on the grid size: Through the finite grid size a virtual edge radius is induced that suppresses the singularity {{at the edge}}. To get around this problem, a mesh-independent evaluation procedure is introduced. With this procedure it is possible to quantitatively evaluate the <b>electric</b> field <b>strength</b> in the vicinity of the sharp edge. As an example, the influence of the offset between the top and bottom metallization layer on the maximum <b>electric</b> field <b>strength</b> is studied. Moreover, the influence of the thickness of the involved layers and of the shape of the electrodes is discussed. Also, the impact of the material properties of the involved dielectrics is examined. In addition to electrostatic simulations we have carried out electric transient simulations, which show that the ratio of the conductivities of the involved dielectric materials plays a major role for determining the maximum <b>electric</b> field <b>strength...</b>|$|R

The analytical method of the <b>electric</b> field <b>strength</b> in the industrially used EP has been experimentally achieved, but a general method of calculation of the <b>electric</b> field <b>strength</b> is not established at present. Our present study is devoted to the establishment of a calculation method for the <b>electric</b> field <b>strength</b> distribution in EP with any electrode structure. In our previous paper, in the case where the space in cylindrical EP is filled with clean gas, a good agreement was obtained in the comparison of the calculated values by means of the method of successive approximative theoretical equation derived by Uhlman and Mayer. In this paper, we made this calculation method better and further tried to calculate the <b>electric</b> field <b>strength</b> distribution in EP involved dust gas with the method of successive approximation. At the first, we measured the radius of ionization region by taking photographs of corona glow points and determined <b>electric</b> field <b>strength</b> of the boundary between ionization and space charge region.

There are various electrode systems provided by the current IEC and ASTM standard. In this paper, influence from the shape of a circular metallic electrode with guard ring, which is very common in DC conductivity measurement for its simple structure, is investigated. Mineral oil with different aging times are tested using this electrode system. According to IEC and ASTM standard, there are four parameters of this electrode system that can affect the DC conductivity measurement, distance between two electrodes, distance between guard and guarded electrode, outer radius of the guard ring and the outer radius of the guarded electrode. Here, we are going to add a new parameter, the edge radius to the system, which is not mentioned in current standards but is quite important in liquid dielectrics measurement. The experimental result shows that increase the edge radius can lead to a higher applied voltage in DC conductivity measurement. The distribution of <b>electric</b> <b>strength</b> of this electrode system is simulated by Comsol Multiphysics.
