25|$|The MOSFET's {{advantages}} in <b>digital</b> <b>circuits</b> do not translate into supremacy in all analog circuits. The {{two types of}} circuit draw upon different features of transistor behavior. <b>Digital</b> <b>circuits</b> switch, spending {{most of their time}} either fully on or fully off. The transition {{from one to the other}} is only of concern with regards to speed and charge required. Analog circuits depend on operation in the transition region where small changes to Vgs can modulate the output (drain) current. The MOSFET and bipolar junction transistor (BJT) is preferred for accurate matching (of adjacent devices in integrated circuits), higher transconductance and certain temperature characteristics which simplify keeping performance predictable as circuit temperature varies.|$|E

In modern networks, this is usually controlled using the Signalling System 7 (SS7) protocol, or one of its variants.

25|$|The X2Y {{footprint}} {{results in}} lower mounted inductance. This is particularly {{of interest for}} use in high-speed <b>digital</b> <b>circuits</b> with clock rates of several 100MHz and upwards. There the decoupling of the individual supply voltages on the circuit board is difficult to realize due to parasitic inductances of the supply lines. A standard solution with conventional ceramic capacitors requires the parallel use of many conventional MLCC chips with different capacitance values. Here X2Y capacitors are able to replace up to five equal-sized ceramic capacitors on the PCB. However, this particular type of ceramic capacitor is patented, so these components are still comparatively expensive.|$|E
25|$|Some ICs combine analog {{and digital}} MOSFET {{circuitry}} {{on a single}} mixed-signal integrated circuit, making the needed board space even smaller. This creates a need to isolate the analog circuits from the <b>digital</b> <b>circuits</b> on a chip level, leading {{to the use of}} isolation rings and silicon on insulator (SOI). Since MOSFETs require more space to handle a given amount of power than a BJT, fabrication processes can incorporate BJTs and MOSFETs into a single device. Mixed-transistor devices are called Bi-FETs (bipolar FETs) if they contain just one BJT-FET and BiCMOS (bipolar-CMOS) if they contain complementary BJT-FETs. Such devices have the advantages of both insulated gates and higher current density.|$|E

2500|$|Many new {{developments}} are targeted at reducing parasitic inductance (ESL).
