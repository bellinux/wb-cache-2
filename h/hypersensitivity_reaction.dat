5|$|In the mid-1980s, Swiss {{physician}} René Flammer {{discovered an}} antigen within the mushroom that stimulates an autoimmune reaction causing the body's immune cells to consider its own {{red blood cells}} as foreign and attack them. Despite this, {{it was not until}} 1990 that guidebooks firmly warned against eating P.involutus, and one Italian guidebook recommended it as edible in 1998. The relatively rare immunohemolytic syndrome occurs following the repeated ingestion of Paxillus mushrooms. Most commonly it arises when the person has ingested the mushroom {{for a long period of}} time, sometimes for many years, and has shown mild gastrointestinal symptoms on previous occasions. The Paxillus syndrome is better classed as a <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>reaction</b> than a toxicological reaction as it is caused not by a genuinely poisonous substance but by the antigen in the mushroom. The antigen is still of unknown structure but it stimulates the formation of IgG antibodies in the blood serum. In the course of subsequent meals, antigen-antibody complexes are formed; these complexes attach to the surface of blood cells and eventually lead to their breakdown.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Adverse event reports (AERs) {{submitted}} to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were reviewed to confirm the platinum agent-associated mild, severe, and lethal <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>reactions.</b> Methods: Authorized pharmacovigilance tools were used for quantitative signal detection, including the proportional reporting ratio, the reporting odds ratio, the information component given by a Bayesian confidence propagation neural network, and the empirical Bayes geometric mean. Excess 2, given by the multi-item gamma Poisson Shrinker algorithm, {{was used to evaluate}} the effects of dexamethasone and diphenhydramine on oxaliplatin-induced <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>reactions.</b> Results: Based on 1, 644, 220 AERs from 2004 to 2009, carboplatin and oxaliplatin proved to cause mild, severe, and lethal <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>reactions,</b> whereas cisplatin did not. Dexamethasone affected oxaliplatin-induced mild <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>reactions,</b> but had lesser effects on severe and lethal reactions. The effects of diphenhydramine were not confirmed. Conclusion: The FDA's adverse event reporting system, AERS, with optimized data mining tools is useful to authorize potential associations between platinum agents and <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>reactions.</b> </p...|$|R

25|$|Concerns {{are being}} raised about the metal {{sensitivity}} and potential dangers of metal particulate debris. New publications have demonstrated development of pseudotumors, soft tissue masses containing necrotic tissue, around the hip joint. It appears these masses are more common in women and these patients show {{a higher level of}} iron in the blood. The cause is unknown and is probably multifactorial. There may be a toxic reaction to an excess of particulate metal wear debris or a <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>reaction</b> to a normal amount of metal debris.|$|E
25|$|Robert Koch {{developed}} tuberculin in 1890. Inoculated into {{individuals who}} have had tuberculosis, it produces a <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>reaction,</b> and is still used to detect {{those who have been}} infected. However, Koch used tuberculin as a vaccine. This caused serious reactions and deaths in individuals whose latent tuberculosis was reactivated by the tuberculin. This was a major setback for supporters of new vaccines. Such incidents and others ensured that any untoward results concerning vaccination and related procedures received continued publicity, which grew as the number of new procedures increased.|$|E
25|$|Hypersensitivity {{reactions}} are less common in nonantibiotic sulfonamides, and, though controversial, {{the available evidence}} suggests those with hypersensitivity to sulfonamide antibiotics {{do not have an}} increased risk of <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>reaction</b> to the nonantibiotic agents. A key component to the allergic response to sulfonamide antibiotics is the arylamine group at N4, found in sulfamethoxazole, sulfasalazine, sulfadiazine, and the anti-retrovirals amprenavir and fosamprenavir. Other sulfonamide drugs do not contain this arylamine group; available evidence suggests that patients who are allergic to arylamine sulfonamides do not cross-react to sulfonamides that lack the arylamine group, and may therefore safely take non-arylamine sulfonamides. It has therefore been argued that the terms 'sulfonamide allergy' or 'sulfa allergy' are misleading, and should be replaced by a reference to a specific drug (e.g. 'cotrimoxazole allergy').|$|E

5000|$|Patients taking {{betahistine}} dihydrochloride {{may experience}} several <b>hypersensitivity</b> and allergic <b>reactions.</b> In the November 2006 issue of [...] "Drug Safety," [...] Dr. Sabine Jeck-Thole and Dr. Wolfgang Wagner reported that betahistine dihydrochloride may cause several allergic and skin-related side effects. These include rash {{in several areas}} of the body; itching and hives; and swelling of the face, tongue and mouth. Other <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>reactions</b> reported include tingling, numbness, burning sensations, shortness of breath and laboured breathing. The study authors suggest that <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>reactions</b> may be {{a direct result of}} betahistine's role in increasing histamine levels throughout the body. <b>Hypersensitivity</b> <b>reactions</b> quickly subside after betahistine has been discontinued.|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} stages of allergy, a type I <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>reaction</b> against an {{allergen}} encountered {{for the first time and}} presented by a professional antigen-presenting cell causes a response in a type of immune cell called a TH2 lymphocyte, which belongs to a subset of T cells that produce a cytokine called interleukin-4 (IL-4). These TH2 cells interact with other lymphocytes called B cells, whose role is production of antibodies. Coupled with signals provided by IL-4, this interaction stimulates the B cell to begin production of a large amount of a particular type of antibody known as IgE. Secreted IgE circulates in the blood and binds to an IgE-specific receptor (a kind of Fc receptor called FcεRI) on the surface of other kinds of immune cells called mast cells and basophils, which are both involved in the acute inflammatory response. The IgE-coated cells, at this stage, are sensitized to the allergen.|$|E

2500|$|The {{pulmonary}} toxicity {{caused by}} nitrofurantoin {{can be categorized}} into acute, subacute, and chronic pulmonary reactions. The acute and subacute reactions {{are thought to be}} due to a <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>reaction</b> and often resolve when the drug is discontinued. Acute reactions have been estimated to occur in about one in 5000 women who take the drug. These reactions usually develop 3–8 days after the first dose of nitrofurantoin, but may occur from a few hours to a few weeks after starting the drug. Symptoms include fever, dyspnea, chills, cough, pleuritic chest pain, headache, back pain, and epigastric pain. [...] Chest radiograph will often show unilateral or bilateral infiltrates similar to pulmonary edema. Treatment includes discontinuation of the nitrofurantoin, which should result in symptom improvement within 24 hours.|$|E
2500|$|Microbial superantigens are {{molecules}} {{expressed by}} bacteria and other microorganisms {{that have the}} power to stimulate a strong immune response by activation of T-cells. These molecules generally have regions that resemble self-antigens that promote a residual autoimmune response – this is the theory of molecular mimicry. Staphylococcal and streptococcal superantigens have been characterised in autoimmune diseases – the classical example in post group A streptococcal rheumatic heart disease, where there is similarity between M proteins of Streptococcus pyogenes to cardiac myosin and laminin. It has also been shown that up to 70% of patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (previously known as Wegener's granulomatosis) are chronic nasal carriers of Staphylococcus aureus, with carriers having an eight times increased risk of relapse. [...] This would therefore be considered a type II <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>reaction.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Rheumatic fever is a {{systemic}} disease affecting the connective tissue around arterioles, and can occur after an untreated strep throat infection, specifically due to group A streptococcus (GAS), Streptococcus pyogenes. It {{is believed to}} be caused by antibody cross-reactivity. This cross-reactivity is a type II <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>reaction</b> and is termed molecular mimicry. [...] Usually, self reactive B cells remain anergic in the periphery without T cell co-stimulation. [...] During a streptococcal infection, mature antigen-presenting cells such as B cells present the bacterial antigen to CD4+T cells which differentiate into helper T2 cells. Helper T2 cells subsequently activate the B cells to become plasma cells and induce the production of antibodies against the cell wall of Streptococcus. However the antibodies may also react against the myocardium and joints, producing the symptoms of rheumatic fever. S. pyogenes is a species of aerobic, cocci, gram-positive bacteria that are non-motile, non-spore forming, and forms chains and large colonies.|$|E
