50|$|Lauryldimethylamine oxide (LDAO), {{also known}} as <b>dodecyldimethylamine</b> oxide (DDAO), is an amine oxide based {{zwitterionic}} surfactant, with a C12 (dodecyl) alkyl tail. It {{is one of the}} most frequently-used surfactants of this type. Like other amine oxide based surfactants it is antimicrobial, being effective against common bacteria such as S. aureus and E. coli, however it is also non-denaturing and may be used to solubilize proteins.|$|E
40|$|Chromatophores of Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides {{yield the}} antenna complex B 850 {{in either of}} two states, {{depending}} on the method of isolation. Methods using dodecyl (= lauryl) dimethylamine oxide yield B 850 with an absorption spectrum like that in vivo: the bands at 800 and 850 nm, due to the bacteriochlorophyll (Bchl) components Bchl- 800 and Bchl- 850, are in ratio A 800 /A 850 = 0. 65 ± 0. 05. When B 850 is isolated by methods using dodecyl sulfate, the Bchl- 800 is attenuated or absent. Bchl assays of these materials and of the isolated antenna complex B 875 yielded the following extinction coefficients, ±SD, {{on the basis of}} the molarity of Bchl: For B 875, ε 875 = 126 ± 8 mM- 1 cm- 1. For B 850 in the normal (high-Bchl- 800) state, ε 850 = 132 ± 10 mM- 1 cm- 1. For the individual components of Bchl in B 850, ε 850 of Bchl- 850 = 184 ± 13 mM- 1 cm- 1 and ε 800 of Bchl- 800 = 213 ± 28 mM- 1 cm- 1. With these coefficients the molecular ratio of Bchl- 850 to Bchl- 800 equals 1. 8 ± 0. 4 for B 850 in the high-Bchl- 800 state. Starting with B 850 depleted of Bchl- 800, the addition of <b>dodecyldimethylamine</b> oxide restored the 800 -nm absorption band. The 850 -nm band became shifted toward the blue, narrowed, and slightly attenuated, and its associated circular dichroism became 20 % more intense. Free Bchl added with <b>dodecyldimethylamine</b> oxide accelerated the restoration of Bchl- 800 and retarded the attenuation of Bchl- 850. We conclude that free Bchl can interact reversibly with a binding site for Bchl- 800 in the B 850 complex, with dodecyl sulfate favoring dissociation and <b>dodecyldimethylamine</b> oxide promoting association. Thus the reversible dissociation of a native chlorophyll-protein complex has now been demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|The acetate salts {{of seven}} {{tertiary}} amines, which provided {{a series of}} increasing alkyl chain length from C 8 to C 18, were screened for fungicidal effectiveness against basidiomycetes and soft-rot fungi in pine and birch timber respectively. <b>Dodecyldimethylamine</b> acetate was the most effective against basidiomycetes (toxic threshold 1. 6 - 3. 2 kg/m 3). Tetradecyldimethylamine acetate was the most effective against soft-rot fungi, but some decay (mean loss of wood substance 3. 1 %) occurred at 6 kg/m 3, the highest level tested. Decreasing alkyl chain lengths (below C 12,) greatly reduced effectiveness whereas increasing alkyl chain length (above C 14) caused only a gradual reduction in fungitoxicity...|$|E
40|$|Ca 2 + {{has been}} shown to be {{essential}} for the retention of maximal O 2 -evolving activity in Photosystem 2 particles extracted by using <b>dodecyldimethylamine</b> oxide from Anacystis nidulans thylakoids. The effect cannot entirely be mimicked by using Mg 2 +. Ca 2 + stimulates electron transport from diphenylcarbazide to 2, 6 -dichloroindophenol catalysed by lead-inhibited cation-free preparations, showing the presence of two cation-binding sites in these particles. Photosystem 2 preparations extracted in Ca 2 +-containing buffer show the presence of three polypeptides at mol. wt. 30000, 33000 and 36000, which are absent or much decreased in preparations extracted in Mg 2 +-containing buffer.

40|$|An {{investigation}} of clavulanic acid behavior {{in an aqueous}} two-phase micellar system employing the surfactants n-decyltetraethylene oxide (C(10) E(4)) and <b>dodecyldimethylamine</b> oxide (DDAO) was carried out. According to the results, clavulanic acid partitions evenly between the two phases of DDAO micellar system, mixed DDAO C(10) E(4) micellar system, as well as C 10 E 4 micellar system. Therefore, electrostatic interactions between positively charged DDAO-containing micelles and negatively charged drug were {{not strong enough to}} influence the partitioning. Nevertheless, clavulanic acid extraction from Streptomyces clavuligerus fermentation broth in C(10) E(4) micellar system employing a previous protein denaturation step provided recovery of 52 % clavulanic acid with removal of 70 % of the contaminant proteins, which is already promising as a purification strategy.

30|$|Bromothymol blue (BTB) {{thin films}} were {{prepared}} by depositing {{a thin layer}} of a solution containing tetraorthosilicate and BTB pH indicator in the presence of surfactants, namely cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (C 19 H 42 BrN, CTAB) or <b>dodecyldimethylamine</b> oxide (C 14 H 31 NO, 69 %), C 16 H 35 NO (11 %), Genaminox LA onto a glass slide substrate. CTAB or GLA surfactants were used to improve the mesostructure of the host material and to increase its porosity. Optical BTB thin films were found to be sensitive against pH and behave as free BTB. This provides evidence for weak interactions between the BTB molecules and the host silica matrix. The effects of the sol mixture on the stability and reproducibility and the colorimetric response to solutions of different pH were examined and pKa values were determined. The BTB thin film sensors showed an advantage over the encapsulated monolithic sensors in which the thin film sensors exhibit a faster response time than the monolithic disks. These pH sensors showed reproducibility and high stability behavior.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} explores {{intermediate}} stages in detergent solubilization of liposomes and Ca 2 +-ATPase membranes by {{sodium dodecyl sulfate}} (SDS) and medium-sized (∼C 12) nonionic detergents. In all cases detergent partitioning in the membranes precedes cooperative binding and solubilization, which is facilitated by exposure to detergent micelles. Nonionic detergents predominantly interact with the lipid component of Ca 2 +-ATPase membranes below the CMC (critical micellar concentration), whereas SDS extracts Ca 2 +-ATPase before solubilization of lipid. At the transition to cooperative binding, n-dodecyl octaethylene glycol monoether (C 12 E 8), Triton X- 100, and <b>dodecyldimethylamine</b> oxide induce fusion of small unilamellar liposomes to larger vesicles before solubilization. Solubilization of Ca 2 +-ATPase membranes is accompanied by membrane fragmentation and aggregation rather than vesicle fusion. Detergents with strongly hydrophilic heads (SDS and β-d-dodecylmaltoside) only very slowly solubilize liposomal membranes and do not cause liposome fusion. These properties are correlated with a slow bilayer flip-flop. Our data suggest that detergent solubilization proceeds {{by a combination of}} 1) a transbilayer attack, following flip-flop of detergent molecules across the lipid bilayer, and 2) extraction of membrane components directly by detergent micelles. The present study should help in the design of efficient solubilization protocols, accomplishing the often delicate balance between preserving functional properties of detergent sensitive membrane proteins and minimizing secondary aggregation and lipid content...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} two {{research}} {{areas that are}} particularly relevant to the practical application of surfactant science: (1) the micellization of multicomponent surfactant mixtures, and (2) the micellization of pH-sensitive (or amphoteric) surfactants. Surfactant formulations of practical utility typically consist of many surfactant components. In many practical applications, pH-sensitive surfactants are added as a secondary surfactant because they enhance performance properties, including solubility, foaming, and mildness to the skin or to the eyes. In addition, pH-sensitive surfactants may be used eectively in novel applications where pH variations can be utilized to control self-assembly, including controlled drug release, targeted gene delivery, and the fabrication of nanoscale materials for optics, electronics, and sensors. First, a molecular-thermodynamic (MT) theory was developed to account for counterion binding to mixed micelles composed of ionic-nonionic and ionic-zwitterionic binary surfactant mixtures. The theory successfully predicted the degree of counterion binding ([beta]) of monovalent and multivalent ions to mixed micelles {{as a function of}} the micelle composition ([alpha]). (cont.) The theory was also found to be consistent with the concept of critical counterion binding. An inection in the [beta vs. [alpha] curve was correlated to a micelle shape transition. Second, the MT theory was generalized to include pH eects in order to model the micellization of pH-sensitive surfactants. The theory was validated by comparing predictions of critical micelle concentrations (cmc's), micelle aggregation numbers, and micellar titration behavior to experimental data for alkyldimethylamine oxide surfactants, which are cationic in the protonated state (at low pH) and zwitterionic in the deprotonated state (at high pH). The MT theory qualitatively reproduced the minimum in the cmc and the maximum in the micelle aggregation number, which are both observed experimentally at intermediate pH values, resulting from the synergy between the two forms of the pH-sensitive surfactant in the micelle. This self-synergy, which was previously attributed by other researchers to the formation ofsurfactant-surfactant hydrogen bonds in the micelle, was rationalized instead in terms of electrostatic interactions operating between surfactants and bound counterions in the micelle. Very good quantitative agreement was obtained for the predicted cmc's in solutions containing no added salt. (cont.) In particular, the experimentally observed maximum in the cmc, which originated from changes in the solution ionic strength, was reproduced by the MT theory but not by the empirical regular solution theory (RST). Micellar titration data were also examined in terms of the relative values of the micellar deprotonation equilibrium parameter (pK). The pK was related to the derivative of the electrostatic contribution to the free energy of micellization (gelec) with respect to. The molecular model of gelec predicted pK > 0 in the limit of micelles composed entirely of the deprotonated form of the pH-sensitive surfactant, consistent with the experimental data. Third, a theory based on RST was developed to model the titration behavior of micelles containing a pH-sensitive surfactant and an arbitrary number of conventional surfactants. The conventional surfactants were successfully modeled as a single eective surfactant, thus considerably simplifying the theoretical analysis of multicomponent surfactant mixtures. The RST description was validated using experimental micellar titration data for single surfactant systems (obtained from the literature) and for binary surfactant mixtures (measured as part of this thesis). (cont.) Experimental uncertainties in the micellar titration data were examined, and a new method was introduced to account for these uncertainties by using a weighted regression analysis. Fourth, a MT theory was developed to model the micellization of mixtures containing an arbitrary number of conventional surfactants. The maximum micelle radius was examined theoretically for a ternary surfactant mixture. Due to the limited availability of experimental data, only the predicted cmc's were compared with the experimental cmc's. Good agreement was obtained for the predicted cmc's, which were comparable to, and sometimes better than, the cmc's determined using RST. The MT theory was also used to model a commercial nonionic surfactant (Genapol UD- 079), which was modeled as a mixture of 16 surfactant components. The predicted cmc agreed remarkably well with the experimental cmc. The monomer concentration was predicted to increase signicantly above the cmc. In addition, the monomer and the micelle compositions were predicted to vary signicantly with surfactant concentration. These composition variations were rationalized in terms of competing steric and entropic eects and a micelle shape transition near the cmc. (cont.) Finally, the MT theory was further generalized to model the micellization behavior of mixtures of a pH-sensitive surfactant and an arbitrary number of conventional surfactants. Predicted values of the solution pH of mixtures of a pH-sensitive surfactant and an ionic surfactant, as well as of the cmc's of mixtures of two pH-sensitive surfactants, compared favorably with the experimental values. The MT theory was also validated using micellar titration data for varying compositions of mixed micelles containing <b>dodecyldimethylamine</b> oxide (C 12 DAO) and a cationic, nonionic, or anionic surfactant. The MT theory accurately modeled the titration behavior of C 12 DAO mixed with the nonionic surfactant. However, C 12 DAO appeared to interact more favorably with the anionic and the cationic surfactants than waspredicted by the MT theory. The MT theories presented in this thesis represent the rst molecular-based models of the micellization behavior of the following systems: (1) pH-sensitive surfactants, (2) mixtures of three or more conventional surfactants, and (3) mixtures of pH-sensitive surfactants and conventional surfactants. The MT theories resulted in qualitative and quantitative predictions of the micellization properties for a variety of surfactant systems. (cont.) A simpler theory based on RST was also developed to model titrations of micelles containing pH-sensitive and conventional surfactants. In addition, this thesis resulted in the rst experimental study of the eect of micelle composition on the titration behavior of mixed micelles containing a pH-sensitive surfactant and a conventional surfactant. The resulting MT theories have provided fundamental, physical insight, and they may also decrease the need for the costly and time-consuming process associated with "trial-and-error" surfactant formulation. by Arthur Clayton Goldsipe.
