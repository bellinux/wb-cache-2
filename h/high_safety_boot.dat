40|$|<b>Safety</b> <b>boots</b> are {{compulsory}} in many occupations {{to protect}} the feet of workers from undesirable external stimuli, particularly in harsh work environments. The unique environmental conditions and varying tasks performed in different occupations necessitate a variety of boot designs to match each worker 2 ̆ 7 s occupational safety and functional requirements. Unfortunately, <b>safety</b> <b>boots</b> are often designed more for occupational safety {{at the expense of}} functionality and comfort. In fact, there is a paucity of published research investigating the influence that specific variations in work boot design have on fundamental tasks common to many occupations, such as walking. This literature review aimed to collate and examine what is currently known about the influence of boot design on walking in order to identify gaps in the literature and develop evidence-based recommendations upon which to design future research studies investigating work boot design...|$|R
50|$|During the 1980s, workwear such as {{the donkey}} jacket and Doc Martens <b>safety</b> <b>boots</b> were popular street attire for British skinheads, suedeheads, {{hardcore}} punks and football hooligans.

2500|$|In the {{industrial}} settings such as paint or flour plants {{as well as}} in hospitals, antistatic <b>safety</b> <b>boots</b> are sometimes used to prevent a buildup of static charge due to contact with the floor.

Being of military age and without uniform caused many to be stopped by police and questioned about avoiding call-up.|$|R

25|$|Black <b>safety</b> <b>boots,</b> {{identical}} to those worn by United States Coast Guard personnel with their Operational Dress Uniform, are worn with the NWU Type I. Brown or tan boots can be authorized for wear with the Type II and III, though black is the standard color for sailors located in the contiguous United States.

25|$|Traditional {{shoelaces}} {{were made}} of leather, cotton, jute, hemp, or other materials used {{in the manufacture of}} rope. Modern shoelaces often incorporate various synthetic fibers, which are generally more slippery and thus more prone to coming undone than those made from traditional fibers. On the other hand, smooth synthetic shoelaces generally have a less rough appearance, suffer less wear from friction, and are less susceptible to rotting from moisture. Specialized fibers like flame resistant nomex are applied in <b>safety</b> <b>boots</b> for firefighters.|$|R
50|$|In some cases, {{the wearing}} of boots may be {{required}} by laws or regulations, such as the regulations in some jurisdictions requiring workers on construction sites to wear steel-toed <b>safety</b> <b>boots.</b> Some uniforms include boots as the regulated footwear. Boots are recommended as well for motorcycle riders. High-top athletic shoes are generally not considered boots, {{even though they do}} cover the ankle, primarily due to the absence of a distinct heel.

50|$|Sturdy and {{comfortable}} boots or shoes are essential because workers {{are on their}} feet much of the day. Hiking or <b>safety</b> <b>boots</b> are preferred because they protect feet from injury. Open-toed shoes or sandals are not allowed because bare feet can easily be injured. An extra pair of socks is beneficial when it rains or is cold. Gloves of two types are needed. First responders wear welder's gloves or Nomex gloves protect their hands when pushing a hot car or removing a hot car part from the racing surface. Other workers may wear insulated gloves to protect their hands from the cold.|$|R
50|$|The Variable-Angle Ramp is a German-developed {{method for}} obtaining {{pedestrian}} slip resistance values. Flooring samples are mounted horizontally on the ramp tester and an operator clad in <b>safety</b> <b>boots</b> or bare feet performs a standardized {{walk up and}} down the sample while wearing a harness to stop the operator from being injured. The sample is slowly inclined until the operator slips on the surface. The angle at which the subject slips is then recorded. Two operators repeat this test three times and then an average is calculated. The repeatability of this test method was extensively documented. Tests can be performed dry, wet with soapy water, wet with oil, etc.|$|R
5000|$|By {{the time}} of Reddy's 50th birthday, the {{corporate}} climate for electric utilities had changed considerably. The growing influence {{of the environmental movement}} in the late 60s, coupled with the fuel shortages of the early 70s, had directed the utilities’ focus away from expansion and toward conservation. RKI began to advise its licensees on environmental issues, urging them to use the character to advance a message of [...] "environmental improvement." [...] Reddy Kilowatt clip art began to depict the character in various “green” poses: planting seedlings and installing energy-efficient lighting, for example. In the late 90s Reddy hung up his pointed-toed <b>safety</b> <b>boots,</b> replacing them with track shoes.|$|R

40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} {{study was conducted}} to determine the prevalence of compliance on personal protective equipments among 240 workers in three different divisions involving steel production division, direct reduction iron division and the mechanical division at a steel factory in Terengganu. A series of guided questionnaire were issued to all the workers in the three divisions to measure the prevalence of compliance to five types of personal protective equipments which consist of safety helmet, mask, eye-protective gear, ear-plugs and <b>safety</b> <b>boots.</b> The prevalence compliance to safety helmet, mask, eye protection gear; ear-plugs and <b>safety</b> <b>boots</b> was 67. 1 %, 35. 3 %, 32. 0 %, 41. 1 % and 99. 2 % respectively. There was a significant relationship (p< 0. 05) between the compliance to safety helmets with type of work being done and for ear-plugs, relationship with compliance were significantly associated with type of work done, duration of use and fit-testing. Findings of this study also supports the hypothesis that compliance was associated with unimpeded movement, unaffected productivity and unhindered work task (p< 0. 05). Age and tenure in service have no significant relationship with compliance. Knowledge on safety and health issues were shown to relate to compliance with safety helmets (p< 0. 01). It is suggested that the management embark on risk assessment programs to be able to explicitly determine the suitability of personal protective equipment being used in regards to type of work, specifications and comfort of workers. Management should also take a firm stand by developing a policy that supports compliance of personal protective equipments...|$|R
