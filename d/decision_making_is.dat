Participants responded to questions in a survey about <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> style, socio-emotional processes, cognitive control processes, and deviant peers. The goals of the research were to test the relation between <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> processes (intuitive and deliberative) and risk behaviors, to test the potential overlap between intuitive and deliberative <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> as described in the more traditional dual-process models and the socio-emotional and cognitive control systems of the neurobiological model, and to extend the neurobiological model by examining the role of individual and social contextual factors in risk behavior. This research is intended to strengthen, expand, and improve our existing knowledge of youth <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> and risk behavior. Results showed that cognitive control processes and deliberative <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> <b>were</b> related to each other whereas socio-emotional processes and intuitive <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> <b>were</b> not.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to argue that {{intuitive}} methods of moral <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> <b>are</b> objective tools on the grounds that they are reasons based. First, I will conduct a preliminary analysis in which I highlight the acceptance of methodological pluralism in the practice of medical ethics. Here, the point is to show the possibility of using intuitive methods given the pluralism framework. Second, I will argue that the best starting point of elaborating such methods is a bottom-up perspective. Third, I will address the worry of subjectivism. Under the influence of certain rationalist positions and recent developments in cognitive science and moral psychology, one might think that intuitive methods of moral <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> <b>are</b> essentially subjective and emotion based. If moral intuitions are the result of emotional reactions and intuitive reasoning is emotionally driven, then there are reasons to believe intuitive methods are subjective and relative to particular psychological constitution. Against this picture, I will argue that intuitive methods of moral <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> <b>are</b> essentially reasons-based. A Wittgensteinian approach will show that intuitive methods of moral <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> <b>are</b> conceptually linked with criteria of morality...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to develop a model of ethical <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> which will provide a generic and {{comprehensive}} philosophical and psychological theoretical foundation for the extension of current theoretical knowledge of ethical behaviour in organizations. In addition, the study's purpose is to provide information which might enhance the practitioner's ability to make ethically right, good, and authentic decisions. The primary data for the study are 14 theoretical models of ethical <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> developed in or having relevance ot administrative contexts. The study employs an interpretative-theoretical methodology of model construction which is both rigorous and deliberative. This methodology consists of four sequential phases: exploration, analysis, classification, and explanation. The five questions posed are as follows: (1) What is the purpose of ethical <b>decision</b> <b>making?</b> (2) What <b>are</b> the theoretical foundations of ethical <b>decision</b> <b>making?</b> (3) What <b>are</b> the elements of ethical <b>decision</b> <b>making?</b> (4) What <b>are</b> the moderators of ethical <b>decision</b> <b>making?</b> (5) What <b>is</b> the process of ethical <b>decision</b> <b>making?</b> The study concludes that there are two general purposes of ethical <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> in administrative contexts, member utility and organizational utility. Member utility refers to the enhanced effectiveness of organizational members who are able to avoid ethical transgression; organizational utility refers to the general enhancement of the organization in terms of efficiency and effectiveness as mediated through the organizational culture and climate. The theoretical foundations for ethical <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> <b>are</b> philosophical and psychological. Seven elements of ethical <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> <b>are</b> identified in the model. These elements are the recognition of the ethical issue, alternative generation, ethical evaluation of the alternatives, ethical judgement, intention, overt ethical/unethical behaviour, and ethical evaluation of behaviour. The moderators of ethical <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> <b>are</b> eclectic and have been grouped into five distinct categories of influencing variables. They are: individual, issue specific, significant other, situational, and external moderators. The moderators influence the decision maker and the ethical decision-making process. The model proposes that the process that ought to be employed by decision makers is open and rational. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R
