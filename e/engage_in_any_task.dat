40|$|The {{concept of}} resting state {{networks}} refers to coherent fluctuations of brain activity, which appear when the subjects are not <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>task</b> or superior cognitive process. Such networks {{have been identified}} in functional magnetic resonance studies and reflect a high connectivity level of the human brain. The concept has gained notoriety and has become routine among groups using functional magnetic resonance in their studies. The activity of the resting state networks has been studied in ageing, mild cognitive impairment and several neurological and psychiatric diseases. Additionally, its existence has been proved in non-human primates and rats. A general overview of the concept is presented here, as well as the acquisition and analysis tools. Moreover, some relevant evidence on this subject matter as well as its impact on several clinical entities are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Parkinson 3 s disease (PD) {{is largely}} {{attributed}} to disruptions in the nigrostriatal dopamine system. These neurodegenerative changes {{may also have}} a more global effect on intrinsic brain organization at the cortical level. Functional brain connectivity between neurocognitive systems related to cognitive processing is critical for effective neural communication, and is disrupted across neurological disorders. Three core neurocognitive networks have been established as playing {{a critical role in}} the pathophysiology of many neurological disorders: the default-mode network (DMN), the salience network (SN), and the central executive network (CEN). In healthy adults, DMN–CEN interactions are anti-correlated while SN–CEN interactions are strongly positively correlated even at rest, when individuals are not <b>engaging</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>task.</b> These intrinsic between-network interactions at rest are necessary for efficient suppression of the DMN and activation of the CEN during a range of cognitive tasks. To identify whether these network interactions are disrupted in individuals with PD, we used resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) to compare between-network connectivity between 24 PD participants and 20 age-matched controls (MC). In comparison to the MC, individuals with PD showed significantly less SN–CEN coupling and greater DMN–CEN coupling during rest. Disease severity, an index of striatal dysfunction, was related to reduced functional coupling between the striatum and SN. These results demonstrate that individuals with PD have a dysfunctional pattern of interaction between core neurocognitive networks compared to what is found in healthy individuals, and that interaction between the SN and the striatum is even more profoundly disrupted in those with greater disease severity...|$|R
40|$|Running title: Social {{relations}} and the default state Iacoboni et al. 2 Some human brain areas are tonically active in a resting state when subjects are not <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> overt <b>task.</b> The activity of these area decreases when subjects are <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> {{a wide variety of}} laboratory tasks designed to study cognitive operations. It has been suggested that these areas, among them the medial parietal and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, may support a "default state ” of the human brain. Passive visual observation of laboratory stimuli typically yields no change in activity in these default areas, compared to rest. Here we report functional magnetic resonance imaging data on normal subjects watching realistic movie clips depicting everyday social interactions. In contrast with previous findings on the default state brain areas, the observation of the relational segment of the movie clip, during which two persons interact, yielded increased activity in the medial parietal and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, compared to rest and to observation of the segment of the movie clip depictin...|$|R
30|$|These studies provide strong {{evidence}} that people make predictive eye movements while viewing naturalistic activity. However, no previous studies have tested whether predictive looking varies {{as a function of}} event structure. Therefore, in a series of two studies that were designed as close replications of one another, we used a new anticipatory looking task, called the Predictive Looking at Action Task (PLAT), to investigate the time course of predictability. For this task, participants’ eyes were tracked as they watched movies of an actor performing an everyday activity that consisted of sequences of goal-directed actions. Participants were not told to <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> explicit <b>task</b> other than paying attention to the movie. Prediction was measured based on the amount of time participants spent looking at the object the actor was about to touch during the three seconds before the actor actually contacted the object. This task therefore allowed predictive looking to be time locked to object contact and made it possible to analyze the time course of predictive looking. We hypothesized that looking to the to-be-contacted object would increase as time to object contact approached, providing an index of predictive looking.|$|R
40|$|Two {{studies have}} tested the moderators between acute {{exercise}} and executive function gains. In study 1, 60 participants {{were assigned to}} 2 groups and performed a handgrip squeezing task at 30 % of their maximal voluntary contraction or a stepping task to the cadence of a metronome. Rate of perceived exertions (RPE) and heart rate were measured at 30  s intervals. Trail-making test (TMT) was administered prior to task performance, following RPE[*]=[*] 6 and RPE[*]=[*] 9. In study 2, 83 participants were assigned to 1 of 5 groups. They performed either a handgrip squeezing task or a stepping task up to RPE[*]=[*] 6 or RPE[*]=[*] 9. Participants {{in the control group}} have not been <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> exercise <b>tasks.</b> Measures of executive function were administered at rest, immediately following exercise tasks, and after 15  min delay. Results from study 1 revealed that both the handgrip squeezing and stepping tasks improved TMT scores after RPE[*]=[*] 9 (p[*]<[*]. 001). In study 2, executive function scores improved following the handgrip and stepping tasks regardless of the exercise intensity. The control condition resulted in similar results to that of the handgrip and stepping conditions. These findings help delineate the role of moderators in the acute exercise–cognitive gains linkage. Alternative “control” conditions must be tested for broader conclusions and implications...|$|R
6000|$|Yet, {{strong as}} he felt himself, he was incited to toil the more {{diligently}} by an anxiety lest death should surprise him {{in the midst of}} his labors. This anxiety, perhaps, is common to all men who set their hearts upon anything so high, in their own view of it, that life becomes of importance only as conditional to its accomplishment. So long as we love life for itself, we seldom dread the losing it. When we desire life for the attainment of an object, we recognize the frailty of its texture. But, side by side with this sense of insecurity, there is a vital faith in our invulnerability to the shaft of death while <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>task</b> that seems assigned by Providence as our proper thing to do, and which the world would have cause to mourn for should we leave it unaccomplished. Can the philosopher, big with the inspiration of an idea that is to reform mankind, believe that he is to be beckoned from this sensible existence at the very instant when he is mustering his breath to speak the word of light? Should he perish so, the weary ages may pass away--the world's, whose life sand may fall, drop by drop--before another intellect is prepared to develop the truth that might have been uttered then. But history affords many an example where the most precious spirit, at any particular epoch manifested in human shape, has gone hence untimely, without space allowed him, so far as mortal judgment could discern, to perform his mission on the earth. The prophet dies, and the man of torpid heart and sluggish brain lives on. The poet leaves his song half sung, or finishes it, beyond the scope of mortal ears, in a celestial choir. The painter--as Allston did--leaves half his conception on the canvas to sadden us with its imperfect beauty, and goes to picture forth the whole, if it be no irreverence to say so, in the hues of heaven. But rather such incomplete designs of this life will be perfected nowhere. This so frequent abortion of man's dearest projects must be taken as a proof that the deeds of earth, however etherealized by piety or genius, are without value, except as exercises and manifestations of the spirit. In heaven, all ordinary thought is higher and more melodious than Milton's song. Then, would he add another verse to any strain that he had left unfinished here? ...|$|R
40|$|Non-averaged scalp-recorded brain {{potentials}} {{were analyzed}} in four right-handed humans {{while they were}} either silently reading a book, or in idle alert conditions. The dimensionality of chaotic strange attractors was estimated from the EEG at each of 14 scalp electrodes, using the point correlation dimension PD 2 algorithm. When the subject was fully alert but not <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> specific <b>task,</b> PD 2 was between 5. 2 and 5. 9. When the subject was silently reading a book, PD 2 bifurcated to significantly higher values (6. 6 - 6. 9) in the left lateral anterior extrasylvian temporal cortex, but did not change in the adjacent left perisylvian cortex nor over {{the right side of}} the brain. The PD 2 increases occurred without <b>any</b> significant change <b>in</b> vigilance level as assessed from the unchanged mean voltage of concomitant gamma (40 Hz) EEG oscillations. A small barely significant PD 2 increase was only noticed in the left lateral precentral region. The increase of chaotic dimensionality in the left lateral extrasylvian temporal cortex during reading reflects enhanced processing operations in the semantic (Wernicke) areas and is in line with recent PET imaging data. These results provide for the first time evidence of a focal chaotic fractal dimension increase that is related to specific cognitive brain processing operations.

40|$|Human and primate {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that performance of tasks that induce asymmetrical physiological activation of the cerebral hemispheres leads to a reduction of tympanic temperature (TT) ipsilateral to the most active hemisphere. It is possible that diseases that interfere in an asymmetrical fashion with the degree of cerebral activity cause similar TT changes. There are not, however, normative studies of the acceptable interaural difference in TT in normal subjects at rest. This study was done to establish normative values for interaural TT values measured by means of infrared tympanic thermometry in resting normal subjects not <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> specific <b>task.</b> TT values were measured in 47 normal volunteers (20 men and 27 women, aged 39. 38 ± 12. 57 years old) at rest; mean interaural differences of TT were calculated. Mean right ear TT was 36. 85 ± 0. 50 ºC and mean left ear TT was 36. 74 ± 0. 57 ºC; these values are in agreement with those already reported in the literature. Mean interaural TT difference was 0. 25 ºC (SD 0. 21 ºC). These findings indicate that maximal normal values for interaural TT differences, with confidence levels of 99 % and 95 %, are, respectively, 0. 88 and 0. 67 ºC. The value of interaural differences of TT as a marker of asymmetrical hemispheric activity in neurological patients will have to be established by additional studies...|$|R

50|$|Daniel Kahneman took a {{different}} approach to describing attention, by describing its division, rather than selection mechanisms. He describes attention as a resource in which energy or mental effort is required. Mental effort is used while <b>engaging</b> <b>in</b> performing <b>any</b> mental <b>task,</b> and the greater the complexity, the greater the effort needed to solve a task. Kahneman believes there are three basic conditions which needed to be met for proper completion of a task. By combining total attentional capacity, momentary mental effort, and appropriate allocation policy of the attentional capacity, a person will exert enough mental effort to overcome mental tasks. The key component is allocating enough attention, as a resource, to the task at hand. Kahneman also noted that arousal influences the total attentional capacity <b>in</b> <b>any</b> given situation. <b>In</b> addition, his model incorporates the ideas of voluntary and reflexive attention, which affect allocation policy. In order to direct attention appropriately, one must attend to relevant information, while neglecting irrelevant information to prevent becoming distracted. This mental effort theory proposed by Kahneman provides an overview of the influences and interdependencies of attention allocation, which is meant to supplement attention selection models.|$|R
40|$|International audienceMajor {{advances}} in resting-state functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) techniques {{in the last two decades}} have provided a tool to better understand the functional organization of the brain both in health and illness. Despite such developments, characterizing regulation and cerebral representation of mind wandering, which occurs unavoidably during resting-state fMRI scans and may induce variability of the acquired data, remains a work in progress. Here, we demonstrate that a decrease or decoupling in functional connectivity involving the caudate nucleus, insula, medial prefrontal cortex and other domain-specific regions was associated with more sustained mind wandering in particular thought domains during resting-state fMRI. Importantly, our findings suggest that temporal and between-subject variations in functional connectivity of above-mentioned regions might be linked with the continuity of mind wandering. Our study not only provides a preliminary framework for characterizing the maintenance and cerebral representation of different types of mind wandering, but also highlights the importance of taking mind wandering into consideration when studying brain organization with resting-state fMRI in the future. Over the past two decades, resting-state functional connectivity measured by {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) has played an essential role in understanding brain functional networks in healthy and patient populations 1 – 5. Resting-state functional connectivity is measured by the temporal co-activation level of spontaneous fMRI signals between spatially distinct brain regions in the absence of a perceptual or behavioral task 6. Although the participants are not <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> particular <b>task,</b> there is increasing evidence that spontaneous thoughts (known as mind wandering, daydreaming, self-generated mental activity or task-unrelated thought) that are minimally constrained by external perception emerge during fMRI scans and may potentially affect resting-state fMRI data 7, 8. Mind wandering during resting-state fMRI has been assessed using different approaches. Questionnaires can be administered, following the resting-state fMRI scan, in which participants are asked to report the presence and frequency of spontaneous thoughts across various domains. Resting-state fMRI studies have employed several types of retrospective measures to assess spontaneous thoughts: Amsterdam Resting-State Questionnaire (ARSQ) 9, New York Cognition Questionnaire (NYC-Q) 10 – 12, and Resting-State Questionnaire (ReSQ) 13, 14. Alternatively, mind-wandering has been assessed using experience or thought sampling in conjunction with resting-state fMRI scanning 15 – 20. While regions within the default mode networ...|$|R
