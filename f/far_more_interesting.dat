Schwartz criticized the episode's killing and resurrection of May as [...] "one of the weaker storytelling tricks in an otherwise solid episode—and as expected, May came back and is just fine." [...] Writing for Nerdist, Joseph McCabe had mixed feelings about the episode's political angle {{and the use of}} Inhumans as a stand-in for minorities, but praised the chemistry between Coulson, Mack, and Fitz, and the further exploration of Jeffrey Mace. McCabe was highly critical of guest star Lorenzo James Henrie, calling him [...] "no more charismatic here than he was in Fear the Walking Dead, and his character is every bit as unsympathetic as his misguided rebel was on that show, wheelchair or no."

Derakhshani argued that it [...] "has some rough, tedious patches– at 130 minutes, it's simply too long. And its reiteration of Hollywood cliches isn't always successful.

500|$|As {{the show}} went on, Lansbury assumed {{a larger role}} behind the scenes. In 1989, her own company, Corymore Productions, began co-producing the show with Universal. Nevertheless, she began to tire of the series, and in {{particular}} the long working hours, stating that the 1990–91 season would be the show's last.

[...] For the eighth season, the show's setting moved to New York City, where Jessica had taken a job teaching criminology at Manhattan University; the move was an attempt to attract younger viewers and was encouraged by Lansbury. Having become a [...] "Sunday-night institution" [...] in the U.S., the show's ratings improved during the early 1990s, becoming a Top Five programme. However, CBS executives, hoping to gain a larger audience, moved it to Thursdays at 8pm, opposite NBC's new sitcom, Friends. Lansbury was angry at the move, believing that it ignored the show's core audience. The final episode of the series aired in May 1996, and ended with Lansbury voicing a [...] "Goodbye from Jessica" [...] message at the end. Tom Shales wrote in The Washington Post, [...] "The title of the show's last episode, [...] "Death by Demographics," [...] is in itself something of a protest. 'Murder, She Wrote' is partly a victim of commercial television's mad youth mania." [...] At the time it tied the original Hawaii Five-O as the longest-running detective drama series in television history, and the role would prove to be the most successful and prominent of Lansbury's career. Lansbury initially had plans for a Murder She Wrote television film that would be a musical with a score composed by Jerry Herman. While this project didn't materialise, it was transformed into Mrs Santa Claus – in which Lansbury played Santa Claus' wife – which proved to be a ratings hit.|$|E
