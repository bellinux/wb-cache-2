40|$|The {{conventional}} view of <b>going-private</b> <b>transactions</b> is {{that they}} are designed to enhance the efficiency of the firm. A starkly different view is that these and other control transactions are motivated to effect transfers from other stakeholders in the firm to equity holders. This study exploits data describing pension terminations as a way to test these theories. The authors conclude that the efficiency theory can plausibly explain a substantial number of leveraged-buyout-related terminations, but not enough to undermine the transfer theory. More specific predictions from the efficiency theory are needed to structure more exacting tests. Copyright 1992 by American Finance Association. ...|$|R

40|$|This Article {{examines}} {{whether the}} cost of complying with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) contributed to the rise in going-private transactions after its enactment. Prior studies of this issue generally suffer from a mistaken assumption that by going-private, a publicly traded firm necessarily immunizes itself from SOX. In actuality, the need to finance a <b>going-private</b> <b>transaction</b> often requires firms to issue high-yield debt securities that subject the surviving firm to SEC reporting obligations and, as a consequence, most of the substantive provisions of SOX. This Article thus explores a previously unexamined natural experiment: to the extent SOX contributed to the rise in going-private transactions, one should observe after 2002 a transition away from high-yield debt in the financing of going-private transactions towards other forms of 2 ̆ 2 SOX-free 2 ̆ 2 finance. Using a unique dataset of going-private transactions, this Article examines the financing decisions of 468 going-private transactions occurring in the eight-year period surrounding the enactment of SOX. Although SOX-free forms of subordinated debt-financing were widely available during this period, I find no {{significant change in the}} overall rate at which firms used high-yield debt financing in structuring going-private transactions after SOX was enacted. Cross-sectional analysis, however, reveals that the use of high-yield financing marginally declined after 2002 for small- and medium-sized transactions, while significantly increasing for large-sized transactions. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the costs of SOX have disproportionately burdened small firms. They also strongly suggest that non-SOX factors were the primary impetus for the 2 ̆ 2 name brand 2 ̆ 2 buyouts commonly evoked as evidence that SOX has harmed the competitiveness of US capital markets...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the role of an initial public {{offering}} (IPO) in maximizing the proceeds an initial owner obtains in selling his company. In deciding whether to undertake an IPO, and what fraction of ownership to retain, the initial owner must balance two factors.

However, by directly bargaining with a potential buyer, he maximizes his proceeds from the sale of control rights.

40|$|In this dissertation, I {{explore the}} {{evolution}} of corporate board structures in leveraged buyouts (LBOs). As a particular form of corporate restructuring activity, the LBO is deemed the most efficient in enhancing corporate performance (Bowman, Singh, Useem 2 ̆ 6 Bhadury 1999). To account for the LBO 2 ̆ 7 s success and staying power, the discipline of debt and the incentives of managerial equity participation represent the leading explanations (Halpern, Kieschnick 2 ̆ 6 Rotenberg 1999; Jensen 1989). A third, although much less studied, source of value in the LBO is the board of directors. ^ To explore board restructurings in LBOs, I focus on the reverse leveraged buyout, or R-LBO. Because an R-LBO involves a <b>going-private</b> <b>transaction</b> that re-enters the public markets via a secondary initial public offering (SIPO), its use allows for a 2 ̆ 2 peek behind the curtain 2 ̆ 2 to observe organizational changes accomplished during the private phase of the restructuring {{and the impact of}} those changes on post-buyout firm performance. Specifically, I examine changes in the board composition of 65 R-LBOs and 65 time-, size- and industry-matched Continuing Firms spanning a 25 -year period (1979 - 2004). I rely on agency theory and the resource dependence perspective to investigate the following three research questions: Do board structures predict companies engaging in buyouts versus those that do not engage in buyouts? To what extent are the boards of R-LBOs altered during the buyout phase? What are the linkages between changes in the R-LBOs 2 ̆ 7 board characteristics and the performance changes of these restructured firms? ^ This dissertation contributes to the ongoing debate on whether the LBO creates value, and if so, how and for whom. I report several results from the descriptive statistics and econometric analyses of the data. For instance, firms with a dual (CEO-chair) structure are {{more likely to engage in}} R-LBO. I find that modifications to R-LBO boards are strongly related to changes in performance. As such, my dissertation finds support for both agency and resource dependence arguments for the board as a distinctive source of value in leveraged buyouts. I discuss the implications of these and additional results for research and practice. ...|$|E

40|$|We present {{evidence}} {{that changes in}} tax laws passed in the 1980 s, culminating with the Tax Reform Act of 1986, had a first order effect on observed merger and acquisition activity in the US. We also present evidence of increased reliance on certain institutional arrangements (unit management buyouts and <b>going-private</b> <b>transactions)</b> used to effect mergers and acquisitions that were designed to reduce the nontax costs of transacting, thereby enabling tax benefits to be realized in {{a larger number of}} mergers and acquisitions than might otherwise have occurred. We begin with a "closed-economy" perspective, focusing on the effects of changes in tax laws on the demand for mergers and acquisitions of us corporations by US corporations. We then broaden the scope of inquiry by modeling and testing the effects of changes in tax laws on the demand for mergers and acquisitions of US corporations by foreign multinationals. Here we predict and present confirmatory {{evidence that}} while the 1986 Tax Act discouraged transactions among US corporations, it increased the demand for merger and acquisition transactions between US sellers and foreign buyers. ...|$|R
40|$|Many <b>going-private</b> <b>transactions</b> are motivated—at least ostensibly—by {{the desire}} to escape the burdens and costs of public ownership. Although these burdens have many purported manifestations, one {{commonly}} cited is the risk of litigation, which may be borne both directly by the firm and/or its fiduciaries, or reflected in director and officer insurance premia funded at company expense. An important issue for the 2 ̆ 2 litigation risk 2 ̆ 2 justification of privatization is whether alternative (and less expensive) steps falling short of going private—such as governance reforms—may augur sufficiently against litigation exposure. In this Article, I consider whether, controlling for other variables related to firm-specific attributes, various measurable attributes of governance help to predict subsequent litigation exposure. Although there are some governance features (such as multiple board service, {{the presence of a}} staggered/classified board, institutional investing, and the proactive adoption of a governance policy) that predict subsequent liability exposure, most governance indicia appear to be of negligible predictive value, both statistically and economically. In light of these findings, this Article discusses implications for both the private-equity market and for corporate/securities law more generally...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} how ownership structures affect <b>going-private</b> <b>transactions</b> in Europe. We examine both market reactions around the acquisition announcements and post-transaction performance, {{and we find}} that CARs around going-private announcements are negatively related to the stake held by its largest shareholder. The market reaction around the goingprivate announcement is also negatively related to the company’s stock price performance before the announcement, supporting the undervaluation hypothesis. The existence of large controlling shareholders allows us to investigate deals initiated by the company’s controlling shareholder. When the largest shareholder, particularly a family, takes a firm private, posttransaction operating performances are better than those of firms taken private by new owners, which experience significant worsening in profitability. We also compare the U. K. to non-U. K. going private: U. K. deals have higher returns for target shareholders, but worse posttransaction performance. We find that using an LBO to delist the company impacts neither abnormal returns nor operating performance. Finally, firms go private to restructure their workforce, {{in terms of both}} employee number and cost. This has a positive impact on the firm’s productivity and efficiency, increasing the profit for employees. JEL Classification: G 3...|$|R
40|$|This Article {{examines}} whether recent shifts among {{private and}} public markets {{are part of a}} more general phenomenon of 2 ̆ 2 shapeshifting 2 ̆ 2 among corporate entities. A shapeshift is a transformation of corporate form involving the creation or use of a new legal entity and one or more changes in structure, including capital structure and the allocation of control rights. Shapeshifting includes not only going private and private equity IPO transactions, but forms of public-company regulatory arbitrage and use of variable interest entities, structured investment vehicles, collateralized debt obligations, and related forms. I assess whether the insights of Ronald Coase and Tibor Scitovsky might be relevant to the analysis of shapeshifting, particularly private-equity transactions. I examine whether parties might shapeshift over time among seemingly Kaldor-Hicks efficient (or perhaps inefficient) regimes and draw some preliminary conclusions about different shapeshifting transactions. I argue that there are parallels between the rationales for shapeshifting and Coase 2 ̆ 7 s arguments about why transactions take place in firms rather than in markets. Coasian boundary determinations essentially are a function of direct and indirect costs. Shapeshifting is no different, yet regulatory interference leads firms to shift shape in undesirable ways. Specifically, <b>going-private</b> <b>transactions</b> have a stronger normative justification than structured finance transactions, because they are subject to lower direct and indirect costs. I conclude that scholars considering one category of shapeshifting might sharpen their normative analysis through comparisons to other shapeshifting transactions...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} four chapters. The first chapter developed a new warning system for international currency crises. The existing crisis indicators in the literature are essentially static. We {{examine the relationship between}} the foreign reserves dynamics and currency crises. It is shown that rapid reserve depletion is a prominent feature before the collapse of the exchange rate system. Our model provides clear warning signals for policy makers to take actions before the reserves has reached a critical value that heralds the arrival of a full-blown crisis. The second chapter employed a competing risk model to investigate the crisis-driven exit and orderly exit from fixed exchange rate regime for the period 1972 - 2001. It is found that the time spent within a regime is itself a significant determinant of the probability of an exit. Different types of exits exhibit different patterns of duration dependence. Crisis-driven exits have a positive duration dependence pattern while orderly exits show a negative duration dependence pattern, even after controlling for country specific characteristics and unobserved heterogeneity. The Competing Risk model yields several interesting results. It is found that the more open the economy, the lower the likelihood of leaving an exchange rate peg, and that the higher the trade concentration, the lower the probability of an orderly exit. Further, financial openness increases the probability of having an orderly exit. There is also strong evidence that a lower reserve growth rate and the incidence of bank crisis are associated with a higher likelihood of crisis driven exits. The third chapter examines whether the gains from incentive realignment have driven corporations out of the public security market. It is shown that going private transactions are due to the reduction in the diversification gains from the public market. For firms whose managers own most equity and are highly leveraged, they have low incentive gains prior to the public-to-private transaction. Such firms go private because of financial distress and dwindling profitability. These kinds of going-private activities are counter-cyclical. On the other hand, a financially healthy firm with a low managerial ownership has high anticipated incentive gains. The gain from incentive realignment is the dominant factor for these <b>going-private</b> <b>transactions.</b> Such firms go private because of an increase in profitability or an improvement in financial distress. We show that these going-private activities are pro-cyclical. The fourth chapter investigates the sources of economy fluctuations in China since its economic reform in 1978. Under the framework of a standard neoclassical open economy model with time-varying frictions (wedge), we study the relative importance of efficiency, labor, investment and foreign debt wedges on recent business cycles phenomena in China. The business accounting procedure suggests that productivity best explains the behavior of aggregate economic variables in China throughout the 1978 - 2006 periods. Labor wedge {{plays a major role in}} explaining the movement of labor enforcement. Foreign debt wedge and investment wedge primarily affect the composition of output between consumption, investment and trade balance, and have a modest role in explaining the fluctuation of output. Our results imply that the reform on inefficiency factor utilization and labor market rigidity should be a focus of future government policies. He, Qing. Adviser: Tai Leung Chong.
