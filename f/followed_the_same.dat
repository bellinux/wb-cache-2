5|$|One of {{the first}} {{practical}} (or at least publicized) examples of digital forensics was Cliff Stoll's pursuit of hacker Markus Hess in 1986.

5|$|To {{serve the}} {{expected}} demand of the expansion, the DHO {{built a new}} four lane freeway north from Highway401 at Renforth Drive. This new route, which roughly <b>followed</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> route as Highway 427 as far as Dixon/Airport Road, {{was known as the}} Toronto Airport Expressway and was opened on January 3, 1964.|$|E

5|$|An {{alternate}} route between Los Angeles and Bakersfield followed the southern {{approach to the}} Ridge Route to Saugus, but took a longer route between Saugus and Gorman, heading northeast through the San Francisquito Canyon to the Antelope Valley and west to Gorman.

5|$|Historians (List of Historians {{till now}} not found, hence cannot be trusted) claim that Hyder was {{extremely}} tolerant towards the Christians. According to historian Severine Silva, he <b>followed</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> policy of religious tolerance towards Christians {{as he had}} from the beginning, even though the Christians had revolted against him. The Second Anglo-Mysore War began in 1780 and led to Hyder's death on 7 December 1782, at Arcot. Afterwards the British recaptured the fort at Mangalore.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, Gyeongju has <b>followed</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> {{trends that}} have {{affected}} the rest of South Korea. Like {{the country as a}} whole, Gyeongju has seen its population age and the size of families shrink. For instance, the mean household size is 2.8 people. Because this has fallen in recent years, there are more households in the city as of 2008 (105,009) than there were in 2003, even though the population has fallen.|$|E

5|$|SH-34 {{has always}} been a lengthy highway, {{starting}} with its commissioning in June 1931, when it was a border-to-border highway stretching from Texas to Kansas. Most of SH-34 has <b>followed</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> basic corridor since its inception, {{with the exception of the}} portion of highway north of Woodward. The southernmost portion of highway, connecting it to Texas, became solely SH-6 in 1987.|$|E
5|$|Three decades later, the East–West Telegraph {{line was}} installed. Constructed between 1875 and 1877, it <b>followed</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> route across the Nullarbor {{and along the}} Great Australian Bight, after John Forrest retraced Eyre's route in 1870 and {{confirmed}} its suitability. Repeater stations were installed at Port Lincoln, Streaky Bay, Smoky Bay, Fowlers Bay, Eucla, Israelite Bay, Esperance, and Bremer Bay. Stations were later added at Franklin Harbour (Cowell) in 1885, Yardea in 1896, and Balladonia in 1897.|$|E
5|$|With the 1834 {{constitutional}} amendment {{known as the}} Additional Act, Provincial General Councils were supplanted by the Assembleias Legislativas Provinciais (Provincial Legislative Assemblies). The new Assemblies enjoyed much greater autonomy from the national government. A Provincial Assembly was composed of 36, 28 or 20 elected deputies, the number {{depending on the size}} of the province's population. The election of provincial deputies <b>followed</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> procedure as used to elect general deputies to the national Chamber of Deputies.|$|E

5|$|A {{second season}} of episodic video games {{developed}} by Telltale Games {{was announced in}} July 2007. Sam & Max Beyond Time and Space <b>followed</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> overall format as Save the World, with each episode having a contained storyline with an overarching storyline involving laundering of {{the souls of the}} dead. As with Save the World, episodes were originally published on GameTap before being made available for general release. The season consisted of five episodes and ran from November 2007 to April 2008. Nowlin and Kasten both returned to reprise their voice roles. In addition to the main games, a twenty-minute machinima video was produced, taking the form of a Sam & Max Christmas special.|$|E
5|$|Between January and March 1952 the {{journalist}} Ian Fleming wrote Casino Royale, his first novel, at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica. Fleming conducted research for Live and Let Die, and completed the novel before Casino Royale {{was published in}} January 1953, four months before his second book was published. Fleming and his wife Ann flew to New York before taking the Silver Meteor train to St. Petersburg in Florida and then flying on to Jamaica. In doing so they <b>followed</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> train route Fleming had taken with his friend Ivar Bryce in July 1943, when Fleming had first visited the island.|$|E
5|$|France in the 12th {{century was}} a loose {{collection}} of counties and smaller polities, under the minimal {{control of the}} king of France. The king's power was linked to his control of the rich province of Île-de-France, just {{to the east of}} Stephen's home county of Blois. In the west lay the three counties of Maine, Anjou and Touraine, and to the north of Blois was the Duchy of Normandy, from which William the Conqueror had conquered England in 1066. William's children were still fighting over the collective Anglo-Norman inheritance. The rulers across this region spoke a similar language, albeit with regional dialects, <b>followed</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> religion, and were closely interrelated; they were also highly competitive and frequently in conflict with one another for valuable territory and the castles that controlled them.|$|E

5|$|Lesbianism, or the {{suggestion}} of it, began early in filmmaking. The same constructs of how lesbians were portrayed—or for what reasons—as what had appeared in literature were placed on women in the films. Women challenging their feminine roles was a device more easily accepted than men challenging masculine ones. Actresses appeared as men in male roles because of plot devices as early as 1914 in A Florida Enchantment featuring Edith Storey. In Morocco (1930) Marlene Dietrich kisses another woman on the lips, and Katharine Hepburn plays a man in Christopher Strong in 1933 and again in Sylvia Scarlett (1936). Hollywood films <b>followed</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> trend set by audiences who flocked to Harlem to see edgy shows that suggested bisexuality.|$|E
5|$|The Treaty of Lisbon {{made the}} European Council a formal {{institution}} {{distinct from the}} (ordinary) Council of the EU, and created the present longer term and full-time presidency. As {{an outgrowth of the}} Council of the EU, the European Council had previously <b>followed</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> Presidency, rotating between each member state. While the Council of the EU retains that system, the European Council established, with no change in powers, a system of appointing an individual (without them being a national leader) for a two-and-a-half-year term - which can be renewed for the same person only once. Following the ratification of the treaty in December 2009, the European Council elected the then-Prime Minister of Belgium Herman Van Rompuy as its first permanent president (resigning from Belgian Prime Minister).|$|E
5|$|The {{publication}} of works on archaeology and art <b>followed</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> pattern as with works on physical and natural sciences: {{that of an}} itinerary with descriptions of the roads travelled, noteworthy monuments along these routes and descriptions of their destinations. Hence, volume I of Expédition de Morée. Section des Beaux Arts describes Navarino (pp.1–7) with six pages of plates (fountains, churches, the fortress of Navarino and the palace of Nestor at Pylos); then on pages 9–10, the Navarino-Methoni road is detailed with four pages of plates (a church in ruins and its frescoes, but also bucolic landscapes reminding the reader that the scene is not so far from Arcadia); and finally three pages on Methoni and four pages of plates. The bucolic landscapes were rather close to the “norm” that Hubert Robert had proposed for depictions of Greece.|$|E

5|$|The series {{lasted for}} 12 regular half-hour episodes (and a final 40-minute special) between 1985 and 1987. All six episodes {{of the first}} series were {{broadcast}} between 11 January and 15 February 1985 at 9:00pm on Friday evenings on BBC2. They <b>followed</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> format with an opening stand up monologue from Wood, followed by a mixture of sketches, songs and spoof mini-documentaries, with regular soap opera parody Acorn Antiques making its introduction. This first series reached 4.55 million viewers by the penultimate show, making it the tenth most popular programme that week on the channel. To Wood's surprise, the series {{then went on to}} win two BAFTA Awards (see below).|$|E
5|$|Weidling {{had given}} the order for the {{survivors}} to break out to the north-west; the plan got underway at around 23:00. The first group from the Reich Chancellery, led by Mohnke, tried but could not break through the Soviet rings and was captured the next day. Like others from the Führerbunker who were captured, he was interrogated by SMERSH. On the third break-out attempt from the Reich Chancellery, made around 01:00 (2 May), Bormann managed to cross the Spree. Arthur Axmann, who <b>followed</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> route, reported seeing Bormann's body {{a short distance from}} the Weidendammer bridge.|$|E
5|$|Blank debuted for the ECW brand as Kelly Kelly. Originally, {{she was to}} {{be named}} just 'Kelly', but her ring name was {{expanded}} to 'Kelly Kelly' by WWE chairman Vince McMahon. She made her debut on the first episode of ECW on June 13, 2006, becoming the youngest Diva on the WWE roster at the age of 19. Her character, an exhibitionist, was introduced performing a striptease for the crowd. The next week, while performing another striptease, Kelly was interrupted by her on-screen boyfriend, Mike Knox, who came to the stage and covered her with a towel before dragging her backstage. Her stripping became a weekly segment known as Kelly's Exposé and usually <b>followed</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> routine; Kelly would dance and strip until she was interrupted by Knox, who was upset by her exhibitionism and showing off her body to others. Originally a solo segment, Kelly was joined by the villainous Candice Michelle on the July 11 edition of ECW.|$|E
