50|$|As {{they enter}} Earth's atmosphere, Exeter sends Cal and Ruth {{on their way}} in their aircraft, declining an {{invitation}} to join them. Exeter is dying and the ship's energy is nearly depleted. The saucer flies out over the ocean and rapidly accelerates until it is enclosed in a <b>fireball,</b> <b>crashes</b> <b>into</b> the water and explodes.|$|R
50|$|Some {{months later}} a massive <b>fireball</b> <b>crashes</b> <b>into</b> the water near Liberty Island. It is {{revealed}} to be a spaceship which resembles a human (Eddie Murphy), controlled by 100 tiny humanoid aliens. Its Captain (also played by Murphy) pilots the spaceship from the command deck located in its head, {{with the help of}} his second-in-command Number 2 (Ed Helms), and researcher Number 3 (Gabrielle Union). The spaceship looks very human, but the aliens don't know how to act in society and the ship displays numerous superpowers. A superstitious cop named Dooley (Scott Caan) desperately searches for the alien.|$|R

50|$|The legendary Bakuryū Styracosaurus (Bakuryū Sutirakosaurusu) {{appears on}} a mountaintop to Abare Max when Brachio was {{attacked}} by the second Anomalogaris, leaving the Abarangers unable to fight with the other Bakuryū and helpless against Ballugigenia. With him is the DinoGarry (Dainogyarī), a chariot containing the War Steel Dinosaur SpinoGold (Bukōryū Supinogōrudo) helmet and War Steel Dinosaur RhamphoGold (Bukōryū Ranfogōrudo) axes. Styraco and the DinoGarry are called the StyracoGarry (Sutirakogyarī) when Styraco is pulling the DinoGalley. They destroyed Ballugigenia, and Styraco became Abare Max's partner. Its attack is <b>Fireball</b> <b>Crash</b> (Faiyābōru Kurasshu); {{because it is an}} ancient Bakuryū, it cannot speak to humans and communicates telepathically with the Abarangers.|$|R
50|$|The car chase between Cobretti and the Night Slasher was {{originally}} longer and ended differently. In the theatrical version Nightslasher shoots at Cobretti's car and causes him to <b>crash</b> <b>into</b> the boat. In {{the original version}} Night Slasher and his driver are the first ones who <b>crash</b> <b>into</b> the boat; Cobretti fails to stop his car in time and <b>crashes</b> <b>into</b> them. Shots of Night Slasher's car turning around and him breathing in relief after Cobra crashes his car were taken from an earlier part of the chase and the shot of Cobretti seeing the boat before he <b>crashes</b> <b>into</b> it was actually taken from Nightslasher's car crash. In the theatrical version, Night Slasher's crashed car is still visible in scene where Cobretti <b>crashes</b> <b>into</b> the boat.|$|R

50|$|The {{film has}} a Japanese Zero fighter being damaged over a naval base and then {{deliberately}} <b>crashing</b> <b>into</b> a naval base hangar. This {{is actually a}} composite of three incidents at Pearl Harbor attack: in the first wave, a Japanese Zero <b>crashed</b> <b>into</b> Fort Kamehameha's ordnance building; in the second wave, a Japanese Zero did deliberately <b>crash</b> <b>into</b> a hillside after U.S. Navy CPO John William Finn at Naval Air Station at Kāneʻohe Bay had shot and damaged the aircraft; also during the second wave, a Japanese aircraft that was damaged <b>crashed</b> <b>into</b> the seaplane tender USS Curtiss.|$|R
50|$|As {{a rule of}} thumb, if the two {{vehicles}} {{have similar}} physical structure, <b>crashing</b> <b>into</b> another car is equivalent to <b>crashing</b> <b>into</b> a rigid surface (like a wall) at half of the closing speed. This means that rear-ending a stationary car while travelling at 50 km/h (30 mph) is equivalent, in terms of deceleration, to <b>crashing</b> <b>into</b> a wall at 25 km/h (15 mph). The {{same is true for}} the vehicle <b>crashed</b> <b>into.</b> However, if one of the vehicles is significantly more rigid (e.g. the rear of a truck) then the deceleration is more typically reflected by the full closing speed for the less rigid vehicle.|$|R
