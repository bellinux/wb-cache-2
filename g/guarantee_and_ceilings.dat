Among predefined system family types in Revit, the Wall element is most appropriate for modeling parametric smoke curtains <b>and</b> <b>ceiling</b> signboards. By means of modifying several Wall properties, such as base constraint, base offset, top constraint, top offset, and thickness, the appearance of Wall elements can resemble smoke curtains <b>and</b> <b>ceiling</b> signboards. The elements with different locations, heights and sizes can be easily and parametrically modeled in the BIM model.|$|R
