40|$|South Asia and Southeast (SE) Asia {{have some}} {{historical}} links {{from the past}} in respect of religion, tradition, culture, food habits, trade, language and population migration. Pig rearing {{is an important part}} of smallholders’ livelihood and socio-cultural belief among pig producers in both regions. Its distribution is largely determined by ethnicity and religion. Because of socio-religious sentiments towards pig rearing and pork consumption, pigs population <b>in</b> South <b>Asia</b> is much smaller than <b>in</b> SE <b>Asia.</b> Vietnam and the Philippines are the two major producers of pig among the SE Asian countries while India is the leading country <b>in</b> South <b>Asia.</b> The pig sub-sector in some of the countries <b>in</b> SE <b>Asia</b> is growing at a faster pace because of industrialisation of farming system and transformation of smallholder backyard system to more commercial farming system in response to market demand. Industrialisation of pig farming <b>in</b> South <b>Asia</b> is yet to take place although the transformation is going on at a slower pace. Naturally, SE Asia is endowed by a few more productive indigenous breeds compared to South <b>Asia.</b> Artificial insemination <b>in</b> pigs is more widely prevalent <b>in</b> SE <b>Asia</b> than <b>in</b> South <b>Asia,</b> although natural breeding is still predominant at smallholders’ level in both regions. Feed regime for pigs is found to be better <b>in</b> SE <b>Asia</b> than <b>in</b> South <b>Asia</b> <b>in</b> terms of use of more grains and protein sources. Cultivation of food-feed crops (sweet potato, maize, cassava etc.) for feeding of pigs is more popular <b>in</b> SE <b>Asia</b> than <b>in</b> South <b>Asia.</b> The housing system in both regions is in a transformation stage from scavenging to semi-intensive to intensive although the degree widely varies among the countries. There are many common diseases affecting pigs in both regions. Among these, classical swine fever (CSF) is a major disease affecting pigs in both regions. Vaccination against CSF is more common <b>in</b> SE <b>Asia</b> than <b>in</b> South <b>Asia.</b> The porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) that has been posing a major threat to the pig industry <b>in</b> SE <b>Asia</b> for the last several years has just been reported recently <b>in</b> South <b>Asia</b> (NE India). Disease prevention mechanisms through vaccination and deworming are more common and widely practiced <b>in</b> SE <b>Asia.</b> Marketing system of pig/ pork in rural areas is almost the same in both regions although it is more advanced in urban centers <b>in</b> SE <b>Asia.</b> The pig subsector <b>in</b> SE <b>Asia</b> has been a prominent component of the government development policies more than it has historically been <b>in</b> South <b>Asia</b> Export market for pork is more vibrant and growing rapidly in a few countries (eg. Thailand, Vietnam) <b>in</b> SE <b>Asia</b> while this is almost nil <b>in</b> South <b>Asia.</b> Pork safety is an important issue in both regions although there are wide country variations. Overall, the pig subsector <b>in</b> SE <b>Asia</b> is more advanced in terms of wider prevalence of better breed, feed, healthcare, processing and market infrastructure including industrial farming system and export-import market than South Asia. It could be anticipated that South Asia could be benefited from some of the lessons of pig systems <b>in</b> SE <b>Asia...</b>|$|R
