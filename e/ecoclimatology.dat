In order to minimize both the production loss and the quality, and to guide the choice of adaptation strategies and management, further studies to investigate the impacts of climate change on agriculture - in the spatial and temporal scales - and their pathogens are needed. The main goal of this work was to explore the global climate impact on the <b>ecoclimatology</b> of the citrus blackfly (Aleurocanthus woglumi Ashby) in State of Par치. To do so, the thermal requirements of Aleurocanthus woglumi Ashby developed in laboratory and on the ecoclimatological zoning based on the annual insect population was first analyzed using air temperature data series from 15 meteorological stations. Then, the populational increase of the studied insect through the projections of global climate model CCSM 3. 0, between years 2030 and 2090, was simulated and analyzed. The results of simulations suggest {{that the number of}} generations of the insect will increase 50 % in Par치 state...|$|E

However, considerable uncertainty remains, especially concerning intra and inter-annual variability of fire incidence. The main goals of our global-scale study were to characterise spatial-temporal patterns of fire activity, to identify broad geographical areas with similar vegetation fire dynamics, and to analyse the relationship between fire activity and the El Ni침o-Southern Oscillation. This study relies on 10 years (mid 1996 ?mid 2006) of screened European Space Agency World Fire Atlas (WFA) data, obtained from Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) and Advanced ATSR (AATSR) imagery. Empirical Orthogonal Function {{analysis was used to}} reduce the dimensionality of the dataset. Regions of homogeneous fire dynamics were identified with cluster analysis, and interpreted based on their eco-climatic characteristics. The impact of 1997 ? 1998 El Ni침o is clearly dominant over the study period, causing increased fire activity in a variety of regions and ecosystems, with variable timing. Overall, this study provides the first global decadal assessment of spatial-temporal fire variability and confirms the usefulness of the screened WFA for global fire <b>ecoclimatology</b> research...|$|E
