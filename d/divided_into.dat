50|$|The renal artery {{enters into}} the kidney {{at the level}} of the first lumbar {{vertebra}} just below the superior mesenteric artery. As it enters the kidney, it <b>divides</b> <b>into</b> branches: first the segmental artery, which <b>divides</b> <b>into</b> 2 or 3 lobar arteries, then further <b>divides</b> <b>into</b> interlobar arteries, which further <b>divide</b> <b>into</b> the arcuate artery, which leads into the interlobular artery, which form afferent arterioles. The afferent arterioles form the glomerulus (network of capillaries enclosed in Bowman's capsule). From here, efferent arterioles leaves the glomerulus and <b>divide</b> <b>into</b> peritubular capillaries, which drain into the interlobular veins and then into arcuate vein and then into interlobar vein, which runs into lobar vein, which opens into the segmental vein and which drains into the renal vein, and then from it blood moves into the inferior vena cava.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: According to the {{viewpoints}} of “one <b>divides</b> <b>into</b> two”, “one <b>divides</b> <b>into</b> three” (e. g. Neutrosophy) and “one <b>divides</b> <b>into</b> many”, {{at present}} there exist six kinds of {{matter in the}} universe altogether (one <b>divides</b> <b>into</b> six). If there exists the ordinary matter (called matter for short), there must exist its opposite. However there may exist more than one kind of its opposite, today the known opposites of matter may be the antimatter and dark matter; Other three kinds of matter are the neutral ones: the first neutral matter between matter and antimatter (Prof. Smarandache named it unmatter), the second neutral matter between matter and dark matter, and the third neutral matter between antimatter and dark matter. Similarly, if there exists the original “law of universal gravitation” (positive law of universal gravitation), there must exist its opposites (negative laws of universal gravitation), and the neutral ones (neutral laws of universal gravitation). According to this analysis, {{it is impossible to}} find the unified and ultimate gravitational theory. Key words: One <b>divides</b> <b>into</b> two; one <b>divides</b> <b>into</b> three; one <b>divides</b> <b>into</b> many; Neutrosophy; six kinds of matter; positive (original) law of universal gravitation; negative law of universal gravitation; neutral law of universal gravitation...|$|R
