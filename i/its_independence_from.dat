5|$|Locating new bodies is {{also not}} without {{political}} disputes. The European Central Bank's (ECB) seat had to symbolise <b>its</b> <b>independence</b> <b>from</b> political control, and was located in a city which did not already host a national government or European institution. New agencies are also being based in eastern Europe since 2004 to balance the distribution of agencies across the EU.|$|E

5|$|The country regained <b>its</b> <b>independence</b> <b>from</b> Spain, in 1640, in a coup d'état {{that placed}} on the throne John, Duke of Bragança, as King John IV. Under his rule, the {{national}} flag was slightly changed as the ogival shield became rounded. It was from this reign forward that the royal arms and the kingdom's arms became separate banners.|$|E
5|$|When Mexico won <b>its</b> <b>independence</b> <b>from</b> Spain in 1821, the United States did not {{contest the}} new republic's claims to Texas, and both presidents John Quincy Adams (1825–1829) and Andrew Jackson (1829–1837) {{persistently}} sought, through official and unofficial channels, to procure all or portions of provincial Texas from the Mexican government, without success.|$|E
5|$|By 1991, most Armenians from Azerbaijan and Azerbaijanis from Armenia {{were forced}} to move to their {{respective}} countries, as remaining in their homes became nearly impossible. Although Armenia had proclaimed <b>its</b> <b>independence</b> <b>from</b> the Soviet Union on 23 August 1990, {{it was not until}} on 21 September 1991, a month after the failed August Coup in Moscow, when the overwhelming majority of Armenians voted for the independence in a nationwide referendum.

5|$|Named after Bernardo de Gálvez y Madrid, Count of Gálvez (born in Macharaviaya, Malaga, Spain), Galveston's first European {{settlements}} on {{the island}} were built around 1816 by French pirate Louis-Michel Aury to help the fledgling Republic of Mexico fight Spain. The Port of Galveston was established in 1825 by the Congress of Mexico following <b>its</b> <b>independence</b> <b>from</b> Spain. The city was the main port for the Texas Navy during the Texas Revolution, and later served as {{the capital of the}} Republic of Texas.|$|E
5|$|Not {{long after}} the end of the war, the Republic of South Maluku (RMS) {{declared}} <b>its</b> <b>independence</b> <b>from</b> the nascent Indonesia. Rijadi was sent to the frontline on 10 July 1950 as part of Operation Senopati. To retake the island of Ambon, Rijadi took half his forces and invaded the eastern shores, while the other half was tasked with invading from the northern coast. Although the second group experienced heavy resistance, Rijadi's group was able to take to the beach in native canoes unopposed; they later landed more infantry and armour.|$|E
5|$|The High Court {{rendered}} its {{judgment on}} 9 January 1998. It accepted the appellant's assertion that Article 73(a) was an empowering provision. Hence since section 6(3) of the RSIA had clearly and unambiguously excluded Article 73(a) of the Malaysian Constitution from applying in Singapore following <b>its</b> <b>independence</b> <b>from</b> Malaysia, Parliament had disempowered itself from legislating extraterritorially. Applying {{this to the}} case, the Court held that Parliament had no legislative power to enact section 37(1) of the PCA.|$|E

5|$|The {{area around}} Kirkcaldy has been {{inhabited}} since the Bronze Age. The first document {{to refer to}} the town is from 1075, when Malcolm III granted the settlement to the church of Dunfermline. David I later gave the burgh to Dunfermline Abbey, which had succeeded the church: a status which was officially recognised by Robert I in 1327. The town only gained <b>its</b> <b>independence</b> <b>from</b> Abbey rule when it was created a royal burgh by Charles I in 1644.|$|E
5|$|When Lithuania {{declared}} <b>its</b> <b>independence</b> <b>from</b> Russia in 1918, {{the song}} was declared the national anthem. It held this status until Lithuania was annexed into the Soviet Union during World War II. During the interwar period, there had been suggestions to modify the words to include a reference to God. It was decided, in Kudirka's memory, that the lyrics should remain as he had written them.|$|E
5|$|Belgium gained <b>its</b> <b>independence</b> <b>from</b> the United Netherlands in 1830 and was {{established}} as a popular and constitutional monarchy under a bicameral parliamentary democracy. A liberal Constitution was written in 1831 which codified the responsibilities and restrictions imposed on the monarch. Although the King, as head of state, was prevented from acting without the approval of a government minister, he was allowed full control of military matters {{in his capacity as}} Commander-in-Chief. Which responsibility would take precedence if they became incompatible was left ambiguous and this uncertainty would {{lie at the heart of}} the Royal Question. The first king, Leopold I, accepted the terms of the Constitution but attempted to use its ambiguities to subtly increase his own powers. This was continued by his successors, although with little real success.|$|E

5|$|Gabon gained <b>its</b> <b>independence</b> <b>from</b> France on 17 August 1960. The {{country had}} a {{relatively}} high standard of living and {{was considered one of}} the more stable countries in West Africa, both politically and economically. At the time of the coup, the country had an estimated US$200 average annual income {{and was one of the}} few countries in Africa with a positive trade balance, with exports exceeding imports by 30 percent. As of 1964, the country was among the largest producers of uranium and manganese in French Africa, which Time suggested was one of the reasons for France's response to the coup. It also had petroleum, iron, and logging interests stationed in Gabon.|$|E
5|$|Gangtok rose to {{prominence}} {{as a popular}} Buddhist pilgrimage site after {{the construction of the}} Enchey Monastery in 1840. In 1894, the ruling Sikkimese Chogyal, Thutob Namgyal, transferred the capital to Gangtok. In the early 20th century, Gangtok became a major stopover on the trade route between Lhasa in Tibet and cities such as Kolkata (then Calcutta) in British India. After India won <b>its</b> <b>independence</b> <b>from</b> Britain in 1947, Sikkim chose to remain an independent monarchy, with Gangtok as its capital. In 1975, after the integration with the union of India, Gangtok was made India's 22nd state capital.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1840s, California fought for <b>its</b> <b>independence</b> <b>from</b> Mexico in the Mexican–American War. The Santa Ana river played an {{important}} part in the victory of the Americans over the Mexican army. In 1847, one year after the Bear Flag Revolt, a Mexican military force set out northwards to attack a smaller American force in the Los Angeles area. However, the Santa Ana River flooded, preventing the Mexicans from crossing the river to attack the Americans. When the river's flow finally subsided, the American forces had been reinforced enough to drive the Mexicans out of the region.|$|E

5|$|Quiriguá {{apparently}} retained <b>its</b> <b>independence</b> <b>from</b> Copán {{and continued}} to flourish {{until the beginning of}} the 9th century. Relations between the two cities had improved somewhat by 810, when king Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat of Copán visited Quiriguá in order to carry out a k'atun-ending ritual. However, 810 was also the year when the last hieroglyphic texts were raised at Quiriguá, although a reduced level of construction continued in the city centre. After this, Quiriguá falls into silence, engulfed by the greater phenomenon of the Classic Maya collapse– it had lost its reason for existence when trade no longer flowed along the Motagua; within a few years Quiriguá was all but deserted and sites throughout the Motagua Valley suffered severe decline or abandonment.|$|E
5|$|Scotland in the Late Middle Ages, {{between the}} deaths of Alexander III in 1286 and James IV in 1513, {{established}} <b>its</b> <b>independence</b> <b>from</b> England under figures including William Wallace in the late 13th century and Robert Bruce in the 14th century. In the 15th century under the Stewart Dynasty, despite a turbulent political history, the Crown gained greater political control {{at the expense of}} independent lords and regained most of its lost territory to approximately the modern borders of the country. However, the Auld Alliance with France led to the heavy defeat of a Scottish army at the Battle of Flodden in 1513 and the death of the king James IV, which would be followed by a long minority and a period of political instability.|$|E
5|$|South Sudan gained <b>its</b> <b>independence</b> <b>from</b> Sudan in 2011, but the South Sudanese Civil War made it {{difficult}} for the nation to garner the support of five sport federations as required for its National Olympic Committee to gain recognition by the International Olympic Committee. Guor Marial, a South Sudanese refugee living in the United States, competed in the men's marathon at the 2012 Summer Olympics, but did so as an Independent Olympic Athlete after refusing to compete for Sudan. South Sudan became the 206th IOC member in August 2015, with the affiliations of track and field, basketball, association football, handball, judo, table tennis, and taekwondo. The nation chose Marial at its flagbearer for both the opening and closing ceremonies.|$|E
