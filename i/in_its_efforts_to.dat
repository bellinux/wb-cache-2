5|$|German {{forces in}} Stalingrad {{soon began to}} run out of supplies, some {{soldiers}} were forced to live on horse meat. By the end of 1942, the distance between the German 6th Army and forces outside of the encirclement was over , and most of the German formations in the area were extremely weak. Hitler's insistence in holding Stalingrad to the last risked the existence of the 6th Army. The end of the German offensive also allowed the Red Army to continue <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> cut off German forces in the Caucasus, which would begin in the middle of January. On the other hand, the encirclement of the 6th Army and the operations to destroy it tied down a considerable number of Soviet troops, which affected Soviet operations on other sectors.|$|E

25|$|It {{is certain}} that {{the idea for the}} {{application}} of Marinus was suggested to Boris I by Formosus of Portus. Formosus and Marinus were friends and close associates. Marinus was an influential diplomat who participated in many missions between Rome and Constantinople. However, Hadrian II did not approve of him and suggested for the office one of his trusted men— the subdeacon Silvester. With his decision the Pope underestimated the ambitions of Boris I for independent church policy, which led to the alienation of the Bulgarian ruler from Rome and indirectly helped the Patriarchate of Constantinople <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> influence the events in Bulgaria.|$|E
25|$|The {{revolution}} arose {{mainly in}} response to the decline of the Qing state, which had proven ineffective <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> modernize China and confront foreign aggression. Many underground anti-Qing groups, with the support of Chinese revolutionaries in exile, tried to overthrow the Qing. The brief civil war that ensued was ended through a political compromise between Yuan Shikai, the late Qing military strongman, and Sun Yat-sen, the leader of the Tongmenghui (United League). After the Qing court transferred power to the newly founded republic, a provisional coalition government was created along with the National Assembly. However, political power of the new national government in Beijing was soon thereafter monopolized by Yuan and led to decades of political division and warlordism, including several attempts at imperial restoration.|$|E

25|$|There {{have been}} two {{prominent}} efforts to establish a major professional football league outside the NFL's auspices since the USFL's lawsuit, neither of which has resulted in lawsuits or antitrust challenges. In 2001, NBC, shut out of its TV contract with pro football {{for the first time}} since the 1960s, formed the XFL as a joint venture with the World Wrestling Federation. The league played one short season, during the winter, and emphasized entertainment value over top-flight competition. Amid rapidly declining interest and viewer disappointment in the product, the XFL shut down. The United Football League sought to create a parallel pro league in 2009; the UFL managed to put a respectable product on the field but was shut out <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> secure the paying television contract that was required to make the league's finances viable, and amid massive financial losses it played its last games in 2012, by which point the league was unable to draw fans or pay its players.|$|E
25|$|From 1996 to the 1997 election, the party's {{executive}} {{tried to}} refurbish the party's image and shed its controversial past. A number of ethnic minorities were sought out as Reform {{candidates for the}} upcoming 1997 election. Also, Reform changed tactics by running a candidate in every riding in Canada, including those in Quebec. The party increased its total seats to 60 and became the Official Opposition. Despite this breakthrough, however, Reform failed to win any seats east of Manitoba. The 1997 election also saw {{the return of the}} Progressive Conservative Party to official party status following their electoral dominance of the conservative vote in eastern Canada. The party was considerably hampered <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> reach Francophone voters because of Manning's inability to speak fluent French. There was also a perception of the party as being anti-Quebec due to its position on official bilingualism and its opposition to the Meech Lake Accord.|$|E

Suspecting an attack, Rosenberg put Stutterheim in command of three battalions, six squadrons, and a horse artillery battery and ordered him to hold the village of Paring, which is midway between Hausen and Eckmühl. At 6:00 AM Stutterheim reported the French advance and his corps commander reinforced him {{to a total of}} six battalions. The French division of Louis Friant soon attacked Paring with the 108th and 111th Line Infantry Regiments. While the 108th mounted a frontal assault, the 111th turned Austrian right flank. Paring fell and 400 Austrians were captured, but the contest occupied the French until 11:00 AM. Meanwhile, Stutterheim's cavalry harassed the Bavarian division of Bernhard Erasmus von Deroy <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> capture the town of Schierling to the west of Eckmühl.
