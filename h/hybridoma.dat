5|$|The {{principle}} of monoclonal antibody production, called <b>hybridoma</b> technology, {{was published in}} 1975 by Georges Köhler and César Milstein, who were awarded the 1984 Medicine Nobel Prize for their discovery together with Niels Kaj Jerne. Muromonab-CD3 was the first monoclonal antibody to be approved for clinical use in humans, in 1986.|$|E
5|$|Specific {{antibodies}} {{are produced}} by injecting an antigen into a mammal, such as a mouse, rat, rabbit, goat, sheep, or horse for large quantities of antibody. Blood isolated from these animals contains polyclonal antibodies—multiple antibodies that bind to the same antigen—in the serum, which can now be called antiserum. Antigens are also injected into chickens for generation of polyclonal antibodies in egg yolk. To obtain antibody that is specific for a single epitope of an antigen, antibody-secreting lymphocytes are isolated from the animal and immortalized by fusing them with a cancer cell line. The fused cells are called hybridomas, and will continually grow and secrete antibody in culture. Single <b>hybridoma</b> cells are isolated by dilution cloning to generate cell clones that all produce the same antibody; these antibodies are called monoclonal antibodies. Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies are often purified using Protein A/G or antigen-affinity chromatography.|$|E
25|$|Initially, murine {{antibodies}} {{were obtained}} by <b>hybridoma</b> technology, for which Jerne, Köhler and Milstein received a Nobel prize. However the dissimilarity between murine and human immune systems led to the clinical failure of these antibodies, except in some specific circumstances. Major problems associated with murine antibodies included reduced stimulation of cytotoxicity and the formation complexes after repeated administration, which resulted in mild allergic reactions and sometimes anaphylactic shock. <b>Hybridoma</b> technology {{has been replaced by}} recombinant DNA technology, transgenic mice and phage display.|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of <b>hybridomas</b> derived from CD 5 + B lymphocytes {{is important for}} studying the immunoglobulin gene repertoire and antibody specificity of this B-lymphocyte subpopulation. However, <b>hybridomas</b> derived from these lymphocytes invariably lose surface membrane expression of CD 5 following hybridization. This impedes the unequivocal assignment of the generated <b>hybridomas</b> to the CD 5 + B-lymphocyte subpopulation from unsorted, or partially sorted, cells. Recent {{studies have shown that}} mRNA transcripts of the CD 5 gene and the protein product can be detected in the cytoplasm of some mouse <b>hybridomas,</b> indicating that although surface expression has been lost, they may have been generated from CD 5 + B lymphocytes. These studies, however, have been unable to discount completely the possibility that aberrant cytoplasmic expression of the CD 5 gene occurred as a direct consequence of the hybridization process. To confirm that cytoplasmic CD 5 expression in the <b>hybridomas</b> is in fact directly related to the B-lymphocyte origin we have generated <b>hybridomas</b> from FACS-sorted CD 5 + and CD 5 - murine splenic B lymphocytes, and determined their surface and cytoplasmic CD 5 expression by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Our findings reveal that all <b>hybridomas</b> derived from CD 5 + B lymphocytes (nine <b>hybridomas)</b> were negative for surface but positive for cytoplasmic CD 5 expression, whereas all <b>hybridomas</b> derived from CD 5 - B lymphocytes (nine <b>hybridomas)</b> were negative for both surface and cytoplasmic CD 5 expression. This finding shows that staining for cytoplasmic CD 5 expression provides an accurate method of determining the cellular origin of murine B-lymphocyte <b>hybridomas...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{produced}} autoreactive T cell <b>hybridomas</b> {{that can}} be induced to secrete interleukin 2 by co-culture with either syngeneic splenic stimulator cells or syngeneic Ia-positive B cell-B lymphoma <b>hybridomas.</b> These autoreactive <b>hybridomas</b> arose from the fusion of pork insulin- primed lymph node T cells with the AKR thymoma BW 5147 and occurred at a higher frequency than the expected insulin-specific <b>hybridomas.</b> Mapping studies using recombinant strains and blocking studies using monoclonal anti-Ia antibodies localized the stimulatory determinant to the I-Ad subregion of the major histocompatibility complex. These T cell <b>hybridomas</b> {{did not appear to}} be directed at any foreign antigen present in the culture system because activation occurred in serum- free, insulin-free medium (Iscove's medium). Such <b>hybridomas</b> should prove to be a potent tool in studying the biologic significance and function of the autoreactive response...|$|R
40|$|<b>Hybridomas</b> {{producing}} antibodies against soluble antigens have in {{most cases}} been difficult to establish. After fusion of myeloma cells with spleen cells obtained from mice immunized with a soluble protein, <b>hybridomas</b> ecreting specific antibodies have been observed to occur very rarely among non-specific <b>hybridomas.</b> We found that the frequency of specific <b>hybridomas</b> correlates directly with the increase over background of the frequency of blast and/or plasma cells in the spleen (measured by cell size analysis) after antigenic stimulation. High yields of specific <b>hybridomas</b> were obtained simply by following a novel immunization technique consisting of several conventional preim-munization courses followed by 4 very high doses of antigen in saline {{on each of the}} last 4 days before fusion...|$|R

25|$|The {{medium must}} be enriched during in vitro {{selection}} to further favour <b>hybridoma</b> growth. This {{can be achieved by}} the use of a layer of feeder fibrocyte cells or supplement medium such as briclone. Culture-media conditioned by macrophages can be used. Production in cell culture is usually preferred as the ascites technique is painful to the animal. Where alternate techniques exist, ascites is considered unethical.|$|E
25|$|Anti-gliadin {{antibodies}} can {{be generated}} in mice or rabbits by immunizing whole purified gliadins, proteolytic fragments of gliadin, or synthetic peptides that represent epitopes of gliadin. After developing an immune response, B-cells from mice can be fused with immortalizing cells to form a <b>hybridoma</b> that produces monoclonal antibodies (Mab or MoAb). Mab can be expressed in culture or via ascites fluid production to produce large amounts of a single antibody isoform.|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the effect of}} gene transfer into human-human <b>hybridomas</b> by electroporation on their production of immunoglobulin. Drug-resistant hyblidomas were easily obtained after transfection of <b>hybridomas</b> with the pSV 2 -neo or Eco gpt-E 1 A plasmid DNA by electroporation. Cell viability after electroporation and selection condition of drug-resistant <b>hybridomas</b> affected frequences of transfection. Drug-resistant <b>hybridomas</b> showed different productivities of monoclonal antibodies which have different binding properties for antigen. These results suggested that gene transfer technique would be useful for producing <b>hybridomas</b> which secrete a lot of superior monoclonal antibodies. 電気穿孔法による外来遺伝子のヒ卜型ハイブリドーマへの導入法及びその抗体産生に及ぼす影響を検討した. 電気穿孔法により,抗原特異的抗体を産生するヒ卜型ハイブリドーマHB 4 C 5,HF 10 B 4 及びH 15 F 2 に薬剤耐性遺伝子をもつpSV 2 -neoやEco gpt-E 1 Aプラスミドを容易に導入することができた. 電気穿孔法によるハイブリドーマへの遺伝子導入効率は電気パルスの条件及び形質転換体のスクリー二ング法に大きく依存した. ヒト型ハイブリドーマへpSV 2 -neoを導入することにより,抗体産生能及び抗体の反応性に変化が認められた. これらの結果は,優れた抗体産生能を持つハイブリドーマの作製手段として,ハイブリドーマへの外来遺伝子の導入が利用しうることを示唆した...|$|R
40|$|AbstractImmunoglobulin {{production}} stimulating factor-IIα, which enhances immunoglobulin {{production of}} human and mouse <b>hybridomas</b> was purified from cell lysate of human Burkitt's lymphoma, Namalwa cells, and identified as glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase.

The enzyme enhanced immunoglobulin productivity of transcription-suppressed <b>hybridomas,</b> but did not enhance that of translation-suppressed <b>hybridomas.</b> From these results, {{it is suggested that}} this enzyme takes part in the post-translational control or the enhancement of translation activity to stimulate immunoglobulin production of <b>hybridomas...</b>|$|R
40|$|Activation of CD 4 + T {{cells is}} a crucial step in the {{elimination}} of Histoplasma capsulatum yeast cells from tissues. However, only {{a limited amount of}} information exists concerning the immunobiology of H. capsulatum-reactive T cells that are CD 4 +. To facilitate the analysis of the functional activities of this T-cell subpopulation, we developed a panel of 10 murine T-cell <b>hybridomas</b> from splenocytes of immune C 57 BL/ 6 mice. All <b>hybridomas</b> reacted with monoclonal anti-CD 4 + antibody and released interleukin- 2 after stimulation with histoplasmin. Within 3 weeks, the reactivity of <b>hybridomas</b> to histoplasmin declined dramatically, yet the cells responded vigorously to yeast-phase preparations that were enriched for cytosol, cell wall, or cell membrane. Of 10 <b>hybridomas</b> studied, only one recognized heterologous fungal antigens. Responsiveness to yeast-phase antigens was restricted by I-Ab. We mapped determinants in cytosol and cell wall or cell membrane by the technique of one-dimensional T-cell immunoblotting. The patterns of responses of <b>hybridomas</b> to cytosol were nearly uniform. All <b>hybridomas</b> responded to two immunodominant regions in cytosol with masses ranging from {{less than or equal to}} 18 to 26 kilodaltons (kDa) and 35 to 39 kDa. All <b>hybridomas</b> tested responded to determinants in the cell wall or cell membrane preparation with masses of 35 to 39 kDa. These <b>hybridomas</b> provide a useful tool for defining yeast-phase antigens that trigger T-cell activation...|$|R
25|$|Immunotherapy {{developed}} in the 1970s following {{the discovery of the}} structure of antibodies and the development of <b>hybridoma</b> technology, which provided the first reliable source of monoclonal antibodies. These advances allowed for the specific targeting of tumors both in vitro and in vivo. Initial research on malignant neoplasms found mAb therapy of limited and generally short-lived success with blood malignancies. Treatment also had to be tailored to each individual patient, which was impracticable in routine clinical settings.|$|E
25|$|The {{major part}} of Milstein's {{research}} career was devoted to studying the structure of antibodies and the mechanism by which antibody diversity is generated. It was {{as part of this}} quest that in 1975 he, together with Georges Köhler (a postdoctoral fellow in his laboratory), developed the <b>hybridoma</b> technique for the production of monoclonal antibodies—a discovery recognised by the award of the 1984 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. This discovery led to an enormous expansion in the exploitation of antibodies in science and medicine.|$|E
25|$|The {{selective}} {{culture medium}} is called HAT medium {{because it contains}} hypoxanthine, aminopterin and thymidine. This medium is selective for fused (<b>hybridoma)</b> cells. Unfused myeloma cells cannot grow because they lack HGPRT and thus cannot replicate their DNA. Unfused spleen cells cannot grow indefinitely because of their limited life span. Only fused hybrid cells, referred to as hybridomas, are able to grow indefinitely in the media because the spleen cell partner supplies HGPRT and the myeloma partner has traits that make it immortal (similar to a cancer cell).|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, {{the results}} of the {{development}} of two microfluidic devices (static and high­ throughput) for efficient electrofusion of cells were described and evaluated. Electrofusion of cells is an important tool for generating antibody producing <b>hybridomas.</b> These <b>hybridomas</b> are the result of the fusion between a B-cell and a myeloma cell. The conventional method for generating <b>hybridomas</b> has a very low efficiency (typically around 0. 001 %). In combination with the increasing need for antibodies, this has motivated us to explore a more efficient method for generating <b>hybridomas.</b> In our opinion, microtluidic chips offer several advantages compared to the conventional systems...|$|R

B 17 scid/scid mice, Six {{to eight months}} after injection, only cells with the B 1 phenotype were retained in the spleens and peritoneal cavities of these mice. The lamina propria of the intestine contained many peritoneal, donor-derived, immunoglobulin A (IgA) -producing cells, The mesenteric lymph nodes of these mice {{were found to be}} a major site of proliferation and generation of IgA plasmablasts, We established eight IgA-producing <b>hybridomas</b> from the mesenteric lymph nodes of such mice, and all the <b>hybridomas</b> reacted with different but partially overlapping fecal bacterial populations, Cloning and sequencing of the V-H genes of these <b>hybridomas</b> showed that two <b>hybridomas</b> utilized germ line-encoded V-H genes while the V-H genes of the other six <b>hybridomas</b> showed somatic mutations, some of which are indicative of an antigen-driven selection process...|$|R
25|$|Relapse of {{glioblastoma}} {{is attributed}} to the recurrence and persistence of tumor stem cells. In a small trial, a tumor B-cell <b>hybridoma</b> vaccine against tumor stem cells elicited a specific tumor immune reaction thus enhancing immune response to the disease. Larger trials, including tests of different EGFR signaling patterns {{and their relationship to}} tumor stem cells are being conducted. The test of rindopepimut failed in a phase III trial in 2016. Other immunotherapeutic and vaccine-type approaches are at different stages of development, but conclusive results are not yet available.|$|E
25|$|Several {{monoclonal}} antibody technologies {{had been developed}} recently, such as phage display, single B cell culture, single cell amplification from various B cell populations and single plasma cell interrogation technologies. Different from traditional <b>hybridoma</b> technology, the newer technologies use molecular biology techniques to amplify the heavy and light chains of the antibody genes by PCR and produce in either bacterial or mammalian systems with recombinant technology. One {{of the advantages of}} the new technologies is applicable to multiple animals, such as rabbit, llama, chicken and other common experimental animals.|$|E
25|$|Thymidine kinases {{have a key}} {{function}} in the synthesis of DNA and therefore in cell division, as {{they are part of}} the unique reaction chain to introduce thymidine into the DNA. Thymidine is present in the body fluids as a result of degradation of DNA from food and from dead cells. Thymidine kinase is required for the action of many antiviral drugs. It is used to select <b>hybridoma</b> cell lines in production of monoclonal antibodies. In clinical chemistry it is used as a proliferation marker in the diagnosis, control of treatment and follow-up of malignant disease, mainly of hematological malignancies.|$|E
40|$|Interleukin 6 (IL- 6) {{serves as}} a growth factor for mouse plasmacytomas. As a model for IL- 6 -mediated growth of plasmacytomas, we study IL- 6 -dependent B-cell <b>hybridomas,</b> which can be {{generated}} through fusion of B lymphocytes with a plasmacytoma cell line, e. g., SP 2 / 0. In the present report, we have investigated the peculiar behavior of B-cell <b>hybridomas</b> with respect to IL- 6 dependence. We demonstrate that although newly generated <b>hybridomas</b> are IL- 6 dependent, many <b>hybridomas</b> lose this dependency at frequencies as high as 50 %, shortly after fusion. We speculated {{that the loss of}} IL- 6 -dependent growth is due to the well-known chromosomal instability of B-cell <b>hybridomas.</b> Consequently, loss of IL- 6 dependence is the result of loss of a specific chromosome(s). This model implies the existence of an "IL- 6 dependency" gene, the loss of which makes <b>hybridomas</b> capable of proliferating in the absence of IL- 6. Because SP 2 / 0 is IL- 6 independent, the IL- 6 -dependent phenotype of B-cell <b>hybridomas,</b> and hence the IL- 6 dependency gene, must be derived from the B lymphocyte. We have tested this model by generating human/mouse B-cell <b>hybridomas</b> through fusion of human B lymphocytes with SP 2 / 0. We then analyzed the human chromosome content of 10 IL- 6 -dependent and 14 IL- 6 -independent subclones. From that analysis we concluded that the presence of human chromosome 21 correlated with IL- 6 dependence. This correlation was confirmed by microcell fusion experiments in which a single copy of chromosome 21 was introduced into IL- 6 -independent <b>hybridomas,</b> resulting in reconstitution of the IL- 6 -dependent phenotype. We therefore conclude that chromosome 21 carries an IL- 6 dependency gen...|$|R
40|$|We have {{previously}} described {{the development of}} virus-specific helper T cell <b>hybridomas</b> which recognize structural determinants shared by type 1 and type 3 reoviruses that {{have been exposed to}} UV radiation. We have found that T-cell <b>hybridomas</b> become persistently infected with live type 3 reovirus used for the immunization. Persistently infected T-hybridoma cells were found to spontaneously produce interleukin 2 (IL- 2). To analyze the mechanism of induction of IL- 2 secretion of persistently infected T-cell <b>hybridomas,</b> we exposed T-cell <b>hybridomas</b> specific for UV-treated virus to replicating type 3 reovirus. The T-cell <b>hybridomas</b> became infected but did not produce IL- 2 unless simultaneously exposed to syngeneic I-A+ antigen-presenting cells. In this situation, the persistently infected T-cell <b>hybridomas</b> produced IL- 2 without being reexposed to virus. This process was not a consequence of nonspecific IL- 2 gene activation, which occurs in cells persistently infected with reovirus, because reovirus infection did not activate IL- 2 secretion in T-cell <b>hybridomas</b> with other antigenic specificities. Reovirus exposure also resulted in persistent infection of certain antigen-presenting B-cell tumor lines. The persistently infected B-cell tumor lines could stimulate reovirus-specific helper T cells but not T-cell <b>hybridomas</b> of other specificities. The data support the thesis that persistent infection of reovirus-specific T cells creates a mechanism in which the virus released from these cells is processed and then reexpressed by I-A+ antigen-presenting cells. The IA antigen and reovirus structures on the antigen-presenting cells then restimulate the T cells through their specific receptors, resulting in IL- 2 synthesis and release. These observations may be relevant to mechanisms of autoimmunity induced by virus...|$|R
40|$|During {{attempts}} to generate Sendai virus-specific T-cell <b>hybridomas,</b> {{a number of}} autoreactive T-cell <b>hybridomas</b> were produced. These hybrids secrete IL- 2 in response to class II-positive syngeneic cells {{in the absence of}} added Sendai virus. Class II molecules on the stimulator cells are involved since monoclonal anti-class II antibodies block the reaction, and mapping studies using recombinant mouse strains show the response is class II restricted. <b>Hybridomas</b> adapted to grow in serum-free medium do not respond to syngeneic cells in the absence of serum; however, addition of fetal calf serum (FCS) restores the response. The component of FCS responsible for the stimulation of the <b>hybridomas</b> has been partially purified and characterized, and its mode of action investigated. These findings suggest that the putative 'autoreactive' T-cell <b>hybridomas</b> reported by others may be specific for a component of the culture medium rather than being truly self-reactive...|$|R
25|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} {{are typically}} made by cell culture that involves fusing myeloma cells with mouse spleen cells immunized with the desired antigen. Rabbit B-cells {{can be used}} to form a rabbit <b>hybridoma.</b> Polyethylene glycol is used to fuse adjacent plasma membranes, but the success rate is low, so a selective medium in which only fused cells can grow is used. This is possible because myeloma cells have lost the ability to synthesize hypoxanthine-guanine-phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT), an enzyme necessary for the salvage synthesis of nucleic acids. The absence of HGPRT is not a problem for these cells unless the de novo purine synthesis pathway is also disrupted. Exposing cells to aminopterin (a folic acid analogue, which inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, DHFR), makes them unable to use the de novo pathway and become fully auxotrophic for nucleic acids, thus requiring supplementation to survive.|$|E
25|$|Milstein's {{early work}} on {{antibodies}} {{focused on the}} nature of their diversity at the amino acid level {{as well as on the}} disulphide bonds by which they were held together. Part of this work was done in collaboration with his wife, Celia. The emphasis of his research then shifted towards the mRNA encoding antibodies where he was able to provide the first evidence for the existence of a precursor for these secreted polypeptides that contained a signal sequence. The development of the <b>hybridoma</b> technology coupled to advances in nucleic acid sequencing then allowed Milstein to chart the changes that occurred in antibodies following antigen encounter. He demonstrated the importance of somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin V genes in antibody affinity maturation. In this process, localised mutation of the immunoglobulin genes allows the production of improved antibodies which make a major contribution to protective immunity and immunological memory. Much of his work in recent years was devoted to characterising this mutational process with a view to understanding its mechanism and, indeed, he contributed a manuscript for publication on this topic less than a week before he died.|$|E

40|$|We have {{analyzed}} {{somatic hypermutation}} of an immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain transgene. <b>Hybridomas</b> expressing the transgene were produced from immunized transgenic mice and transgene copies were sequenced to assay for mutation. In two IgM-producing <b>hybridomas,</b> {{as well as}} in several IgG-producing <b>hybridomas,</b> mutations were found in the VDJ region of the transgene. In the IgM-producing <b>hybridomas,</b> both mutated and unmutated transgene copies were present and expressed as mRNA. Several mutated transgene copies were present in a single cell and these showed different patterns of mutation. Two IgG-producing <b>hybridomas</b> isolated from a single animal also showed a hierarchical pattern of mutation indicating that transgene mutations can accumulate during B cell proliferation, similar to the mutational process for endogenous antibody genes. Among <b>hybridomas</b> that expressed both IgG and IgM molecules derived from the transgene, the isotype-switched gamma transgene copy exhibited a higher level of mutation than the mu transgene copies.

Activated B lymphocytes and plasma cells {{are present in}} the synovial tissue and are thought to contribute to the immunopathology of the rheumatoid joint. To investigate rheumatoid synovial B lymphocytes, we have generated B cell <b>hybridomas</b> from synovial tissue of an RA patient. Here we describe the immunoglobulin VH gene repertoire of eight IgM- and 10 IgG-secreting synovial-derived <b>hybridomas.</b> The VH 4 gene family is highly represented (38. 5 %) in this panel of <b>hybridomas</b> compared with the frequency of VH 4 gene expression in circulating B lymphocytes reported previously (19 - 22 %) and with the VH 4 gene frequency we observed in a panel of <b>hybridomas</b> derived in the same manner from the spleen and tonsil of normal individuals (19 %). The increased frequency of VH 4 gene expression was not due to the expansion of a single B cell clone in vivo as none of these <b>hybridomas</b> was clonally related.
