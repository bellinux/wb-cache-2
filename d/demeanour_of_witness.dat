40|$|Two studies {{investigated}} the impact <b>of</b> <b>witness</b> <b>demeanour</b> {{on the extent}} to which mock jurors were influenced by the strength <b>of</b> the <b>witness</b> 2 ̆ 7 testimony. The first study (N = 87) manipulated the strength <b>of</b> a <b>witness</b> 2 ̆ 7 testimony (strong versus weak) and the witness 2 ̆ 7 non-verbal behaviour (stereotypically deceptive versus non-deceptive). As expected, the strength of the testimony only influenced mock jurors 2 ̆ 7 perceptions when the witness displayed stereotypically non-deceptive non-verbal behaviour. A second study (N = 101) tested whether this effect was due to reliance on stereotypical but accurate cues to deception or stereotypical but inaccurate cues to deception. Participants were presented with the strong testimony from the first study in either an audio-visual format or audio-only format. Participants were only influenced by the stereotypically deceptive or non-deceptive non-verbal behaviours <b>of</b> the <b>witness</b> when such cues were accessible via audio-visual information. In the audio-only condition, where only the accurate stereotypical cues were accessible, there was no difference in evaluations as a function <b>of</b> <b>witness</b> behaviour. Results suggest that instructing jurors to rely on the <b>demeanour</b> <b>of</b> a <b>witness</b> when evaluating the credibility <b>of</b> that <b>witness</b> may be counter-productive...|$|R
50|$|Evidence is {{the corner}} stone of all legal proceedings. It is therefore, of great significance, for its {{sanctity}} to be protected. A judge or magistrate before whom the legal contest is fought is intrinsically unconnected {{with the facts}} {{which led to the}} dispute. His ability to resolve the dispute based on the facts as presented by the disputants depends to a large extent on the quality of evidence adduced by the parties. Assigning probative value on the evidence of the disputants and, their witnesses, equally depend on the forensic skills of the trial court in observing the <b>demeanours</b> <b>of</b> those <b>witnesses.</b> The basis for the proscription of offences relating to perjury or false evidence is underscored by the inherent danger in wrongful conviction or wrongful acquittal where the evidence adduced by the parties, were false.|$|R

25|$|The 1992 {{short film}} Le batteur du Boléro {{concerns}} {{a performance of}} Boléro, focusing on the <b>demeanour</b> <b>of</b> the main snare drummer.|$|R
60|$|Francis {{thought that}} the <b>demeanour</b> <b>of</b> Ruggiero was {{somewhat}} altered from that which he had assumed at the previous investigation, and that he looked sullen and anxious.|$|R
6000|$|... "Calmly!" [...] {{interrupted}} Mr Osten, growing {{still more}} {{angry at the}} quiet <b>demeanour</b> <b>of</b> his son; [...] "do you mean to insinuate that--that--. What do you mean, sir?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr Sampson {{expressed}} {{his belief that}} such was the <b>demeanour</b> <b>of</b> Angels. Miss Lavvy replied with solemnity, 'No, dearest George, I am but too well aware that I am merely human.' ...|$|R
60|$|There was {{a murmur}} of sympathy and admiration from the miners at the dauntless <b>demeanour</b> <b>of</b> the newcomer, {{while the two}} policemen shrugged their {{shoulders}} and renewed a conversation between themselves.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Horser {{leaned over}} the table. His eyes were bloodshot, his tone was fierce and threatening. Mr. Sabin was coldly courteous. The {{difference}} between the <b>demeanour</b> <b>of</b> the two men was remarkable.|$|R
60|$|Mary had {{meantime}} {{entered her}} mother's room, {{with a look}} that revealed the whole to Mrs. Ponsonby, who had already been somewhat startled by the <b>demeanour</b> <b>of</b> {{the father and son}} at breakfast.|$|R
5000|$|In Bellini's painting, {{while on}} one hand, the figures and the setting give {{the effect of}} great realism, Bellini's {{interest}} in Byzantine icons is displayed in the hierarchical enthronement and <b>demeanour</b> <b>of</b> the Madonna.|$|R
2500|$|The final {{negotiations}} were made between Antiochus III and Demetrius. Antiochus III was reportedly highly {{impressed by the}} <b>demeanour</b> <b>of</b> the young prince, and offered him one of his daughters in marriage, around 206 BC: ...|$|R
50|$|Verse 26 {{praises the}} splendid {{physique}} and gentle <b>demeanour</b> <b>of</b> Ayushchandra, stating {{that he was}} a source of joy to good people, just like the holy city of Kashi was a source of salvation for them.|$|R
60|$|Hortense {{received}} her former pupil with a <b>demeanour</b> <b>of</b> more dignity than warmth. She had been seriously offended by Mr. Helstone's proceedings, and had all along considered Caroline to blame in obeying her uncle too literally.|$|R
60|$|Kate {{mentioned}} to her uncle the changed <b>demeanour</b> <b>of</b> the Governor, {{but he could}} give no explanation; he had heard of no political troubles, but supposed that family matters might easily have saddened the good man.|$|R
50|$|Helena (Nellie in the English dub) - She is the triplet {{with the}} green ribbon. She has the sweetest <b>demeanour</b> <b>of</b> the triplets. She also has a love for food and sweets, which {{sometimes}} leads to trouble.|$|R
6000|$|Julian Avenel {{saw with}} {{surprise}} the <b>demeanour</b> <b>of</b> the reverend stranger. [...] "Beshrew me," [...] he said, [...] "these new-fashioned religioners have fast-days, I warrant me--the old ones used to confer these blessings chiefly on the laity." ...|$|R
60|$|It is {{necessary}} to dwell for some brief space on the appearance and <b>demeanour</b> <b>of</b> young Glendinning, ere we proceed to describe his interview with the Abbot of St. Mary's, at this momentous crisis of his life.|$|R
60|$|Seymour's was furious. The senior day-room {{to a man}} {{condemned}} Sheen. The junior day-room was crimson in {{the face}} and incoherent. The <b>demeanour</b> <b>of</b> a junior in moments of excitement generally lacks that repose which marks the philosopher.|$|R
60|$|There was {{something}} curiously different about the <b>demeanour</b> <b>of</b> Julian's trusted servant, {{as he took}} his master's coat and hat. Even Julian, engrossed {{as he was in}} the happenings of the evening, could scarcely fail to notice it.|$|R
60|$|Trusty Tomkins was {{presently}} ushered in, bearing {{himself with}} an iron gravity, which neither the terrors of the preceding night, nor the dignified <b>demeanour</b> <b>of</b> the high-born personage before whom he stood, were able for an instant to overcome.|$|R
60|$|Lord Dawlish {{had listened}} to this speech in perfect silence. He now rose and began to pace the room. He looked warm and uncomfortable. His demeanour, in fact, {{was by no means}} the {{accepted}} <b>demeanour</b> <b>of</b> the lucky heir.|$|R
60|$|Upon his tour, {{he and his}} {{followers}} were everywhere most hospitably received at the stations at which they halted. Everywhere he heard the same tale of sheep killed, cattle and horses driven off, and the insolent <b>demeanour</b> <b>of</b> the natives.|$|R
60|$|We {{perceived}} at once, {{as soon as}} we {{came into}} the main street again, from the excited <b>demeanour</b> <b>of</b> the crowd and from the anxious faces of people running to and fro that something of great moment must be happening.|$|R
50|$|The {{advertisements}} feature comedians Stephen Curry and Dave Lawson and a footballer re-enacting one or {{more famous}} incidents from that player's career. Curry plays the straight man to Lawson, while the <b>demeanour</b> <b>of</b> the player varies depending upon that player's personality.|$|R
50|$|Kaye has {{suggested}} that the general <b>demeanour</b> <b>of</b> Strutter, his dress sense, drug addictions and foul language are based on a combination of David Kleinfeld, the lawyer played by Sean Penn in the Al Pacino film Carlito's Way, and Joe Pesci.|$|R
60|$|Both {{the young}} men looked a little haggard and anxious, but {{otherwise}} they were irreproachably dressed, {{and there was not}} the slightest sign, about their courtly <b>demeanour,</b> <b>of</b> the terrible catastrophe, which they must have felt hovering round them and round their chief.|$|R
60|$|Frida {{rose and}} {{followed}} him, moved by some unconscious wave of instinctive sympathy. The four children {{of this world}} were left together on the lawn by the rustic table, to exchange views by themselves on the extraordinary behaviour and novel <b>demeanour</b> <b>of</b> the mysterious Alien.|$|R
60|$|Two tramps of supernatural {{exuberance}} {{called at}} the cottage shortly after breakfast to ask George, {{whom they had}} never even consulted about their marriages, to help support their wives and children. Nothing {{could have been more}} care-free and debonnaire than the <b>demeanour</b> <b>of</b> these men.|$|R
50|$|A tall, wiry, loose-jointed young man, with unkempt {{hair and}} the general <b>demeanour</b> <b>of</b> a caged eagle, Mr Windsor {{is a native of}} Wyoming, who comes to New York to further his career as a journalist. In Psmith, Journalist, he and Psmith become friends, and work {{together}} to improve the city.|$|R
50|$|John Goldies son, Lieutenant Goldie, R.N., {{many years}} later {{recalled}} the general persona and <b>demeanour</b> <b>of</b> Burns as he first knew him {{and went on to}} recount the great change in appearance and confidence that came over the bard after his time in Edinburgh following the publication of his poems.|$|R
6000|$|... "Astounded at this weighty query, {{and at the}} philosophic <b>demeanour</b> <b>of</b> his visitor, {{our hero}} made shift to bid him welcome and to demand his name and quality. As the old man {{answered}} him his voice rose and fell in musical cadences, like the sighing of the east wind, while an ethereal and aromatic vapour pervaded the apartment.|$|R
60|$|The {{chattering}} {{of voices}} sank upon their advent, {{it became a}} hissing whisper, then a faint drone like that of bees, and then utter silence. In the solemn and grave <b>demeanour</b> <b>of</b> the dalals there was something almost sacerdotal, so that when that silence fell upon the crowd the affair took on the aspect of a sacrament.|$|R
60|$|The {{first thing}} he noticed on {{reaching}} the School House was the strange <b>demeanour</b> <b>of</b> the butler. Whenever Fenn had had occasion to call on the headmaster hitherto, Watson had admitted him with {{the air of a}} high priest leading a devotee to a shrine of which he was the sole managing director. This evening he seemed restless, excited.|$|R
60|$|We have {{mentioned}} the weighty reasons which induced Mr. Mowbray {{to look upon}} the stranger whom a general invitation had brought into their society, with unfavourable prepossessions; and these were far from being abated by the <b>demeanour</b> <b>of</b> Tyrrel, which, though perfectly well-bred, indicated a sense of equality, which the young Laird of St. Ronan's considered as extremely presumptuous.|$|R
