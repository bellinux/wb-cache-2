500|$|The {{lieutenant}} {{had kept}} {{many of his}} men below deck and in anticipation of being boarded told them to prepare for close fighting.

[...] The two vessels contacted one another as the Adventures grappling hooks hit their target and several grenades, made from powder and shot-filled bottles and ignited by fuses, broke across the sloop's deck.

500|$|As {{shown in}} [...] "Ensign Ro", during an away team mission to capture Orta, Ro manages {{to get the}} team taken hostage. As a result, Picard {{confines}} her to her quarters. But Picard discovers that the Bajorans were {{not responsible for the}} attack on the Federation colony, and Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg) convinces Ro to tell Picard of Kennelly's plan. Ro was under orders to offer arms to Orta, to trick him to revealing his presence so the Cardassians can destroy his vessel. At that point, Kennelly would intervene and order Picard not to intervene to keep the peace treaty with the Cardassians. Picard allows the plan to proceed, but the Cardassians destroy an <b>empty</b> <b>ship</b> before revealing that the Cardassians had staged the attack in order to enlist aid against the Bajorans. At the conclusion of the episode, Picard offers Ro a position on the crew of the Enterprise, which she accepts.|$|E
2500|$|The ship's {{ballast water}} {{capacity}} of [...] {{is divided into}} sixteen segregated ballast tanks, six pairs located in the double hull around the cargo tanks, two fore peak tanks and two aft peak tanks. She has two electrically driven ballast pumps rated at 2,500 m3/h × 35 m and 3,000 m3/h × 70 m. The ballast capacity is needed to maintain correct trim especially during drydocking — the <b>empty</b> <b>ship</b> has an aft trim of [...] and an uneven weight distribution may damage the hull girder.|$|E

60|$|But no more; enough {{has been}} said {{to show that the}} old Dutch whalers of two or three centuries ago were high livers; and that the English whalers have not {{neglected}} so excellent an example.

25|$|The Gibraltar convoys of World War II were oceangoing trade convoys of {{merchant}} ships sailing between Gibraltar and the United Kingdom. Gibraltar convoy routes crossed U-boat transit routes from French Atlantic {{ports and}} were {{within range of}} Axis maritime patrol aircraft making these convoys vulnerable to observation and interception by bombers, submarines, and surface warships during the Battle of the Atlantic. OG convoys brought supplies from the United Kingdom to Gibraltar from September 1939 until September 1942. Beginning with Operation Torch, OG convoys were replaced by KM convoys transporting military personnel and supplies from the United Kingdom to and past Gibraltar into the Mediterranean Sea. HG convoys brought food, raw materials, and later <b>empty</b> <b>ships</b> from Gibraltar to the United Kingdom from September 1939 until September 1942. After Operation Torch, HG convoys were replaced by MK convoys returning mostly <b>empty</b> <b>ships</b> from the Mediterranean to the United Kingdom. KM and MK convoys ended in 1945.|$|R

"I {{followed}} {{him all over}} the <b>empty</b> <b>ship</b> to and fro, here and there, with no living soul about but the two of us, because the old ship-keeper had locked himself up in the galley--both doors. Suddenly poor Charley mutters, in a crazy voice: 'I'm done here,' and strides down the gangway with me at his heels, up the dock, out at the gate, on towards Tower Hill. He used to take rooms with a decent old landlady in America Square, to be near his work.|$|E
60|$|I {{felt very}} dim, {{and only a}} bit of myself. And I dozed blankly. The {{afternoon}} grew more sunny. The ship turned southwards, and with the wind and waves behind, it became much warmer, much smoother. The sun had the lovely strong winey warmth, golden over the dark-blue sea. The old oak-wood looked almost white, the afternoon was sweet upon the sea. And in the sunshine and the swishing of the sea, the speedier running of the <b>empty</b> <b>ship,</b> I slept a warm, sweet hour away, and awoke new. To see ahead pale, uplooming islands upon the right: the windy Egades: and on the right a mountain or high conical hill, with buildings on the summit: and in front against the sea, still rather far away, buildings rising upon a quay, within a harbor: and a mole, and a castle forward to sea, all small and far away, like a view. The buildings were square and fine. There was something impressive--magical under the far sunshine and the keen wind, the square and well-proportioned buildings waiting far off, waiting like a lost city in a story, a Rip van Winkle city. I knew it was Trapani, the western port of Sicily, under the western sun.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. Rather lovely really," [...] {{she answers}} wistfully. To {{tell the truth}} there is {{something}} in the long, slow lift of the ship, and her long, slow slide forwards which makes my heart beat with joy. It is the motion of freedom. To feel her come up--then slide slowly forward, with a sound of the smashing of waters, is like the magic gallop of the sky, the magic gallop of elemental space. That long, slow, waveringly rhythmic {{rise and fall of the}} ship, with waters snorting as it were from her nostrils, oh God what a joy it is to the wild innermost soul. One is free at last--and lilting in a slow flight of the elements, winging outwards. Oh God, to be free of all the hemmed-in life--the horror of human tension, the absolute insanity of machine persistence. The agony which a train is to me, really. And the long-drawn-out agony of a life among tense, resistant people on land. And then to feel the long, slow lift and drop of this almost <b>empty</b> <b>ship,</b> as she took the waters. Ah God, liberty, liberty, elemental liberty. I wished in my soul the voyage might last forever, that the sea had no end, that one might float in this wavering, tremulous, yet long and surging pulsation while ever time lasted: space never exhausted, and no turning back, no looking back, even.|$|E

50|$|The Ballast Bank, {{known as}} 'Wee Ireland' was formed from sand {{unloaded}} from <b>empty</b> <b>ships</b> {{that had been}} loaded with it as ballast.

5|$|A salvage {{attempt was}} ordered by Secretary of State William Paget only {{days after the}} sinking, and Charles Brandon, the king's brother-in-law, took charge of {{practical}} details. The operation followed the standard procedure for raising ships in shallow waters: strong cables were attached to the sunken ship and fastened to two <b>empty</b> <b>ships,</b> or hulks. At low tide, the ropes were pulled taut with capstans. When the high tide came in, the hulks rose and with them the wreck. It would then be towed into shallower water and the procedure repeated until the whole ship could be raised completely.|$|R

With other Mediterranean-based vessels, the three ships escorted the 'troopers' to a mid-ocean meeting point where craft from the Eastern fleet took over on 8 February.
