5000|$|... #Caption: Established on August 1, 1863, Point Lookout was {{the largest}} {{and one of the}} worst Union prisoner-of-war camps. It was located at the extreme tip of St. Marys County, on the long, low, and barren {{peninsula}} where the Potomac River joins the Chesapeake Bay. The prisons official name was Camp Hoffman but it was hardly ever used. Before long, the prison became the most populated and largest Union prison, at one time holding 20,000 prisoners, because it was so close to the battlefields on the Eastern Theater. Besides chronic diarrhea, dysentery and typhoid fever had become epidemic at the camp while smallpox, scurvy, and the itch had become quite common. Because of the topography, drainage was poor, and the area was subject to extreme heat in the summer and cold in the winter. This exacerbated the problems created by inadequate food, clothing, <b>fuel,</b> <b>housing,</b> and medical care. As a result, approximately 3,000 prisoners died there over 22 months.(Image credit: Library of Congress) ...|$|E
50|$|Udall {{describes}} many large-scale {{impacts on}} natural resources, terming them “The Big Raid on resources”. The {{first was the}} need for lumber in a growing nation for <b>fuel,</b> <b>housing</b> and paper. Udall states that it was with this first big raid on the earth’s natural resources that the myth of superabundance began to show its fallacy. It was only {{towards the end of}} the nineteenth century that people were awakened to the empty hillsides and the vastness of blackened woods from the lumber industry. Petroleum followed, as it was widely believed that oil was constantly made inside the earth, and so, like everything else, was inexhaustible. Then came seal hunting, and by 1866 the seal population that originally numbered approximately five million was drastically cut in half. Many of the seals were shot in the water and never recovered, allowing for enormous waste. The Fur Seal Treaty which came about in 1911 saved the seals from becoming the first major marine species to become extinct thanks to the myth of superabundance.|$|E

40|$|Bamboos {{constitute}} {{a very important}} and versatile resource worldwide. A lot of Asian, African and South American people rely on bamboo products for their housing and farming tools. Meanwhile, the shoots of these plants are regarded as vegetables in East and South-East Asian nations. China has the greatest bamboo forest area (extension) and {{the largest number of}} bamboo species (more than 590 species), many of them with significant economic importance, being Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis), the most important bamboo species in China, due to its usage not only as timber but also for food. China has paid unprecedented attention in recent decades to bamboo forest management. The vast economic profits derived from silviculture have contributed much to rural development and poverty alleviation. Bamboo industry has become the pillar of economy in mountainous areas. Besides being a tool for poverty alleviation in rural areas, bamboo plantations are also a significant carbon sink and a key option to mitigate land degradation. This paper highlights such aspects as bamboo silviculture (fertilization, pruning, thinning, irrigation, shoot and timber harvesting) its domestic and international applications (timber, plywood, food, paper, <b>fuel,</b> <b>housing,</b> etc.) in daily life, and  its current role in Chinese industry and economy, without particular reference to any of its species...|$|E

50|$|The {{origin of}} these housing bubbles {{involves}} two major factors: 1) Low {{interest rates in}} the U.S. and Europe following the 2000-2001 U.S. recession; and 2) Significant growth in savings available from developing nations due to ongoing trade imbalances. These factors drove a large increase in demand for high-yield investments. Large investment banks connected the housing markets to this large supply of savings via innovative new securities, <b>fueling</b> <b>housing</b> bubbles in the U.S. and Europe.|$|R
40|$|Armenia, {{founded in}} the third century as a Christian state, endured centuries of rule by the Ottoman, Persian, and Russian empires {{until the end of}} World War I. Following the Bolshevik {{revolution}} in 1918, an autonomous state was established for a brief time {{in the eastern part of}} Armenia in what had been part of the Russian Empire. Independence was lost to Russian control in November 1920. Status as a separate republic within the USSR was granted in 1936, but potential for conflict was created by placing mainly Armenian regions within the borders of Azerbaijan. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Republic of Armenia declared its independence in 1991. Conflict with Azerbaijan over the Armenian region of Nagorno-Karabakh drained economic resources and created a refugee problem. In addition to these economic disruptions, Armenia had suffered a devastating earthquake in 1988. As a result, the country’s only nuclear power plant was shut down as a precautionary measure. At the same time, unrest in the Republic of Georgia and historic enmity toward Turkey disrupted trade and added to the energy, <b>fuel,</b> <b>housing,</b> and food shortages that idled Armenia’s research and manufacturing industries, especially during severe winters in 1992 and 1993.

40|$|Sorghum is an {{important}} grain crop {{in many parts of}} the world, especially in dry regions. It is {{an important}} crop for food and feed, and its role in energy production is currently growing. In Ethiopia, sorghum is a multi-purpose crop used for many different functions such as <b>fuel,</b> <b>housing</b> and animal feed. Information on genetic diversity levels among and within sorghum accessions will increase the efficiency of the sorghum improvement programmes. Field experiments were conducted in Potchefstroom, South Africa, during the summer growing seasons of 2009 and 2010, to estimate the level of phenotypic diversity among 22 sorghum accessions. The experiment was laid out in a randomised complete block design with three replications. Nine qualitative and 20 quantitative morphological traits were recorded. Analysis of variance for the quantitative traits revealed that differences among accessions were highly significant for all traits. Qualitative traits diversity index values varied from 31 % (panicle compactness and shape) to 84 % (glume colour). The pair-wise genetic distances based on phenotypic traits showed varying genetic distances. Cluster analysis of the phenotypic traits resulted in four distinct groups of accessions with genetic distances ranging from 0. 40 to 1. 59. Therefore, the phenotypic markers provide a useful measure of genetic distances among sorghum accessions to identify potential donors or parental material for future breeding efforts...|$|E

50|$|Radioactive steam will vent {{into the}} {{atmosphere}} due to the water eventually evaporating. The spent fuel will eventually {{set fire to the}} building, and the steam pressure will cause the storage facilities to explode, causing a (non nuclear) explosion, emitting radiation not only in the immediate area of the plant but around the globe due to winds. The resulting nuclear disasters spread fallout over large areas. This is repeated dozens of times as shutdown nuclear plants and spent <b>fuel</b> <b>houses</b> explode.

50|$|In theory, the {{modularity}} of a MOB {{allows the}} full spectrum of air support, ranging from vertical/short takeoff and landing (VSTOL) aircraft using a single platform to conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL) aircraft utilizing several serially aligned modules approaching 2 km (6,000 feet) in length. The cluster could have an air strip that could hold a large aircraft such as C-130 or C-17. In addition, a MOB accepts ship-borne cargo, provides nominally 280,000 m² (3 million square feet) for equipment storage and maintenance, stores 40 million litres (10 million gallons) of <b>fuel,</b> <b>houses</b> up to 3,000 troops (an Army heavy brigade), and discharges resources to the shore via a variety of landing craft.
