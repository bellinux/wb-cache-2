These airfields range in their size, infrastructure provisions, operational capability and environment. Over {{the last ten}} years, the management of maintenance at these airfields has uncovered unique problems, allowed trials of various maintenance approaches to be conducted and presented many opportunities to learn valuable lessons for the future. Surface enrichment of asphalt using both tar-based and bitumen-based materials has been performed on many pavements. This {{has proven to be}} an effective means of increasing the period between asphalt overlays. Such treatments require careful attention to the application rates and selection of the enrichment product. The interface between concrete and asphalt surfaced pavements presents a design challenge. If not detailed appropriately, differential thermal expansion and contraction can lead to shoving and cracking of asphalt as well as spalling of concrete. In extreme conditions, it is possible to retrofit an <b>isolation</b> <b>joint</b> to these interfaces to improve their condition. Hot bitumen sprayed seals can provide an appropriate surfacing for the operation of non-jet aircraft. While the materials and equipment are generally the same as for road pavements, the subtle design and specification differences are not commonly understood by contractors. Careful design and construction management is required to obtain the optimum sealed surface for an aircraft pavement. The repair of minor concrete spalling is likely to be required on many aircraft parking aprons. A range of materials have been trial tested with varying degrees of success. A proprietary semi-rigid epoxy {{has been found to be}} the most reliable and durable product for concrete spall repairs, with trenches of asphalt suitable for cracked slabs. Asphalt surfacings will unavoidably be segregated in isolated areas and over time aggregate will erode from the surface. Use of 14 mm asphalt surfacing, in lieu of the traditional 20 mm asphalt mix, requires grooving of the surface to achieve the required skid resistance but significantly reduces built-in segregation. Polymer modified bitumen emulsion slurries effectively treat remaining areas of segregated and eroded asphalt...|$|E

The retrofit is intended to allow the two-tier bridge to withstand a 7.4 magnitude earthquake on the Hayward Fault and an 8.3 magnitude quake on the San Andreas Fault. The foundation piers were strengthened by wrapping the lower section of structural steel in a concrete casing, installing new shear piles, and adding bracing to the structural steel towers. <b>Isolation</b> <b>joints</b> and bearings were also added to the main bridge structures (cantilever spans over the navigation channels) to strengthen the structure.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{events such}} as natural catastrophes or {{terrorism}} attacks have highlighted the necessity to ensure the structural integrity of buildings under exceptional actions. Accordingly, a European RFCS project entitled “Robust structures by joint ductility” {{has been set up}} in 2004, for three years, with the aim to provide requirements and practical guidelines for the design of steel and composite structures under exceptional actions. In this project, the importance of the structural joints has been shown; as a particular case, these ones experience additional high tying forces after the loss of a column, {{as a result of the}} development of membrane forces in the beams located just above the damaged column. Moreover a reversal of moments occurs in some joints. In this paper design models for the evaluation of the mechanical properties of joints in such extreme situations are presented.

40|$|Concrete expands and {{contracts}} with variations in temperature. Concrete shrinks as it cures. Concrete slabs curl and warp from temperature and moisture gradients {{from the top}} {{to the bottom of}} the slab. These natural responses cause concrete pavement to crack at fairly regular intervals. A fundamental of jointed concrete pavement design is to introduce a jointing system to control the location of this expected cracking. Of the three joint types, contraction, construction and <b>isolation,</b> contraction <b>joints</b> are specifically for crack control. Statistically, contraction joint systems provide assurance of crack control in new concrete pavement. However, certain design or construction factors may influence the success of a contraction joint system. Substantial changes in the weather during and after construction can induce uncontrolled cracking despite proper jointing techniques. Because of the complexity of the interrelating factors, uncontrolled cracks will occur in some new concrete pavements. These cracks generally develop within the first sixty days. When uncontrolled cracks do occur, agencies and contractors must address them to ensure long-term performance equivalent to normal pavement. There appears to be little consistency in this practice and this paper provides a summary of the causes and recommendations for minimizing the potential for cracking. The paper provides a single source review of the factors that contribute to uncontrolled cracking, including proper concrete mixture design and jointing techniques that can minimize risk of early uncontrolled cracking. The paper concludes with a summary of industry standard practice for the repair of uncontrolled cracks...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{choice of}} foreign country {{markets and the}} {{selection}} of corresponding market entry strategies belong to classical questions in the international business research, which – despite their high relevance for business success – {{have not yet been}} consistently solved. The research in these fi elds is advanced and of high quality, though very fragmented and limited to very specifi c research questions (like Brouthers 2002, Lee et al 2010, Schwens et al 2011, Johanson/Vahlne 1977, Koch 2001, Morschet et al 2008). As a consequence, it rarely intends to develop a scientifi cally based holistic approach, theory or model which would support complex decision-making and analysis of these key questions of internationalization of a fi rm. As in the business practice these two decisions of a company’s internationalization are not taken in complete <b>isolation,</b> a <b>joint</b> analysis of market and entry strategy selection is seen as helpful in practice and is able to enrich research. In this paper the author presents a conceptual model, which provides an extended and integrated explanation of the country market selection and entry strategy choice. The model creation was based on a multi-theoretical approach and on analysis of previous theoretical and empirical scientifi c work in the fi eld. The Uppsala Theory was combined with the institutional based view, transaction cost economics and the concepts of “customer coordination need ” and “systematic choice”. The paper ends with propositions of hypotheses for an empirical verifi cation of the new model. An additional purpose of this work is to stimulate intensive discussion and research in creating a general theory of company’s internationalization, which is still missing...|$|R

40|$|The {{end of the}} Cold War {{marked a}} major break for {{migration}} policies in Europe.

Loads in bars are determined in a symbol form {{using the method}} of <b>joint</b> <b>isolation</b> by the computer mathematics Maple system. The peculiarity of the considered truss structure is its external static indeterminacy. In fact, all efforts and reactions of supports can be determined from the equilibrium conditions.

40|$|Connectivity {{analysis}} {{focuses on}} the interaction between brain regions. Such relationships inform us about patterns of neural communication and may enhance our understanding of neurological disorders. This thesis proposes a generative framework that uses anatomical and functional connectivity information to find impairments within a clinical population. Anatomical connectivity is measured via Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI), and functional connectivity is assessed using resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). We first develop a probabilistic model to merge information from DWI tractography and resting-state fMRI correlations. Our formulation captures the interaction between hidden templates of anatomical and functional connectivity within the brain. We also present an intuitive extension to population studies and demonstrate that our model learns predictive differences between a control and a schizophrenia population. Furthermore, combining the two modalities yields better results than considering each one in <b>isolation.</b> Although our <b>joint</b> model identifies widespread connectivity patterns influenced by a neurological disorder, the results are difficult to interpret and integrate with our regioncentric knowledge of the brain. To alleviate this problem, we present a novel approach to identify regions associated with the disorder based on connectivity information. Specifically, we assume that impairments of the disorder localize to a small subset of brain regions, which we call disease foci, and affect neural communication to/from these regions. This allows us to aggregate pairwise connectivity changes into a region-based representation of the disease. Once again, we use a probabilistic formulation: latent variables specify a template organization of the brain, which we indirectly observe through resting-state fMRI correlations and DWI tractography. Our inference algorithm simultaneously identifies both the afflicted regions and the network of aberrant functional connectivity. Finally, we extend the region-based model to include multiple collections of foci, which we call disease clusters. Preliminary results suggest that {{as the number of}} clusters increases, the refined model explains progressively more of the functional differences between the populations. by Archana Venkataraman.

40|$|Models {{to capture}} the physics of jointed {{structures}} have been proposed for over 40 years. These models approximate {{the behavior of the}} joint under carefully developed operating conditions. When these conditions change, the model has to be changed. Recent developments in numeric codes like finite elements have created interest in incorporating joint models into the design process but joint models need to represent the joined structure over a broader operating range. This work investigates the dynamic response of a structure with a <b>joint.</b> <b>Isolation</b> of a few dominant effects may give way to a model able to capture a broader operating range. To isolate the effects of the joint two specimens were created. A specimen that is without a joint serves as a control. The second specimen is geometrically similar and contains a double lap joint with a bolt fastener. The differences between the specimens represent the effects of the bolt. Control variables of bolt tension, excitation level and sampling time were chosen. Amplitude response and hysteresis curves were recorded. This data was used to examine the non-linear response of the bolted specimen. Qualitative observations are included. The control specimen shows little effect from non-linear behavior in the frequency response. The bolted specimen shows non-linear behavior in the frequency response. When the joint is introduced to the geometry the system drops in amplitude, drops in resonant frequency, and demonstrates a non-linear softening effect. As the initial bolt tension is reduced the magnitudes of these changes increase. In addition when the system is allowed to dwell with a single sine wave at resonance the amplitude of the response often increases. Hysteresis curves reveal that more than a softening non-linearity affects the response. The curve shows a softening affect when displacing in one direction and a hardening affect when displacing in the opposite direction. This may be affected by the geometry as the control specimen demonstrates a tri-linear stiffness. It is evident that previous joint models do not capture all of the effects observed. Additional research to link the physical cause to the observed affect will aid in adjusting or creating a joint model to be used in numeric codes...|$|R

40|$|Osteoarthritis (OA) is {{a common}} joint disease, mainly effecting the elderly population. The cause of OA {{seems to be an}} {{imbalance}} in catabolic and anabolic factors that develops with age. IL- 1 is a catabolic factor known to induce cartilage damage, and transforming growth factor (TGF) -beta is an anabolic factor that can counteract many IL- 1 -induced effects. In old mice, we observed reduced responsiveness to TGF-beta-induced IL- 1 counteraction. We investigated whether expression of TGF-beta and its signaling molecules altered with age. To mimic the TGF-beta deprived conditions in aged mice, we assessed the functional consequence of TGF-beta blocking. We isolated knee joints of mice aged 5 months or 2 years, half of which were exposed to IL- 1 by intra-articular injection 24 h prior to knee <b>joint</b> <b>isolation.</b> Immunohistochemistry was performed, staining for TGF-beta 1, - 2 or - 3, TGF-betaRI or -RII, Smad 2, - 3, - 4, - 6 and - 7 and Smad- 2 P. The percentage of cells staining positive was determined in tibial cartilage. To mimic the lack of TGF-beta signaling in old mice, young mice were injected with IL- 1 and after 2 days Ad-LAP (TGF-beta inhibitor) or a control virus were injected. Proteoglycan (PG) synthesis (35 S-sulfate incorporation) and PG content of the cartilage were determined. Our experiments revealed that TGF-beta 2 and - 3 expression decreased with age, as did the TGF-beta receptors. Although the number of cells positive for the Smad proteins was not altered, the number of cells expressing Smad 2 P strongly dropped in old mice. IL- 1 did not alter the expression patterns. We mimicked the lack of TGF-beta signaling in old mice by TGF-beta inhibition with LAP. This resulted in a reduced level of PG synthesis and aggravation of PG depletion. The limited response of old mice to TGF-beta induced-IL- 1 counteraction is not due to a diminished level of intracellular signaling molecules or an upregulation of intracellular inhibitors, but is likely due to an intrinsic absence of sufficient TGF-beta receptor expression. Blocking TGF-beta distorted the natural repair response after IL- 1 injection. In conclusion, TGF-beta appears {{to play an important role}} in repair of cartilage and a lack of TGF-beta responsiveness in old mice might be at the root of OA development...|$|R
