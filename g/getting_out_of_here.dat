5000|$|In an {{interview}} with the New York Times, she said the sexual assault [...] "ranks as unpleasant; that's all it ranks....everyone's made such a big deal about this indecent assault, but the only thing that makes it indecent is that it was non-consensual. I asked myself, 'Is it going to prevent me from <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>here?</b> Is there a risk of death attached to it? Is it permanently disabling? Is it permanently disfiguring? Lastly, is it excruciating?' If it doesn't fit one of those five categories, then it isn't important."

40|$|The {{prevention}} of Japanese encephalitis in travelers presents {{the juxtaposition of}} 4 factors: a disease that is widespread throughout Asia, a disease with a low incidence in travelers, a vaccine about which there are safety concerns, and a clinical course that can result in death or permanent disability in two-thirds of symptomatic cases. Travel medicine practitioners often seem to be polarized into 2 groups: a group that gives more weight to {{the severity of the}} disease (and therefore often recommend vaccination) and another group that is more persuaded by the low occurrence of cases in travelers (and therefore rarely recommend vaccination). This review assesses the known risks of contracting Japanese encephalitis and the risks associated with the vaccine and tries to develop an appropriate way to recommend this vaccine to travelers who may be at significant risk. The popular movie “Chicken Run ” is about chickens trying to escape from a prisoner-of-war camp–like enclosure to avoid being turned into chicken pot pies. After a series of unsuccessful escape attempts, one of the fearful chickens says to the heroine, Ginger, “The chances of us <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>here</b> are a million to one. ” To which Ginger replies, “Then there’s still a chance. ...|$|E
40|$|Reference {{to future}} time in English is {{expressed}} {{by a variety}} of morphosyntactic constructions: the modal construction with will (1 a), the periphrastic go-future (1 b), the simple present (1 c) and the present progressive (1 d). (1) a. I said, “I’ll get in touch with Madame and see if I’ll get them. ”(QEP. QC/ 006) b. “You wanted honesty, I’m gonna give you honesty. ”(QEP.

And I said, “If things don’t change around here, I’m <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>here.</b> ”(QEP. QC/ 037) Opinion is divided on whether these constructions are interchangeable (e. g. Binnick 1971;Palmer 1987) or whether each form expresses different nuances of meaning (e. g. Leech 1971; Wekker 1976), with a plethora of explanations offered for the choice of variant. However, since most of these explanations rely on speaker intent or attitude towards the realization of the future eventuality, they do not readily lend themselves to empirical testing. Moreover, the choice of variant may be determined by a combination of factors, making it difficult to assess the contribution of each explanation on a one-by-one basis.
