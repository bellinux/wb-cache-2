40|$|A clear {{visualization}} of the operative field is {{of critical importance}} in endoscopic surgery. During surgery the endoscope lens can <b>get</b> <b>fouled</b> by body fluids (eg, blood), ground substance, rinsing fluid, bone dust, or smoke plumes, resulting in visual impairment. As a result, surgeons spend part of the procedure on intermittent cleaning of the endoscope lens. Current cleaning methods that rely on manual wiping or a lens irrigation system are still far from ideal, leading to longer procedure times, dirtying of the surgical site, and reduced visual acuity, potentially reducing patient safety. With the goal of finding a solution to these issues, a literature review was conducted to identify and categorize existing techniques capable of achieving optically clean surfaces, and to show which techniques can potentially be implemented in surgical practice. The review found that the most promising method for achieving surface cleanliness consists of a hybrid solution, namely, that of a hydrophilic or hydrophobic coating on the endoscope lens {{and the use of}} the existing lens irrigation system. </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} fouling of {{conventional}} filter fabrics and membranes was studied. In {{the beginning of}} the thesis fouling and how it can be measured and predicted is reviewed. Information on different methods on how fouling canbe decreased or cleaned away is also given. The experimental part is divided into two sections; fabric filtration and membrane filtration. Fouling of the filter fabrics was studied with silica or cupper slurries and fouling of the membranes was studied with pulp and paper mill waters. The fouled filter materials were characterised according to many different methods. The most useful way to observe fouling is to measure the changes in the permeate flux. Fouling can also be seen visually e. g. with scanning electron microscopy. Consequently, also the reason for the fouling in question might be found. Different filtration characteristics affect fouling e. g. as the filtration pressure was increased it did not have much influence on the permeate flux, but the pressure caused the membrane to <b>get</b> <b>fouled</b> faster. Also, an increase of shear rate on the membrane surface decreased fouling. Different pretreatment methods for the effluent were tested in membrane filtration to decrease fouling. The tested methods; biological treatment, ozonation, enzymatic treatment and flocculation, did not have a clear influence on the fouling of the membrane, but e. g. a biological treatment combined with ultrafiltration made the tested groundwood mill circulation water purer than ultrafiltration alone...|$|E
