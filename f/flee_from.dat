5|$|Flock {{behaviour}} in sheep {{is generally}} only exhibited {{in groups of}} four or more sheep; fewer sheep may not react as expected when alone or with few other sheep. Being a prey species, the primary defense mechanism of sheep is to <b>flee</b> <b>from</b> danger when their flight zone is entered. Cornered sheep may charge and butt, or threaten by hoof stamping and adopting an aggressive posture. This is particularly true for ewes with newborn lambs.|$|E

5|$|Horses are prey {{animals with}} a strong fight-or-flight response. Their first {{reaction}} to threat is to startle and usually flee, although they will stand their ground and defend themselves when flight is impossible or if their young are threatened. They {{also tend to be}} curious; when startled, they will often hesitate an instant to ascertain the cause of their fright, and may not always <b>flee</b> <b>from</b> something that they perceive as non-threatening. Most light horse riding breeds were developed for speed, agility, alertness and endurance; natural qualities that extend from their wild ancestors. However, through selective breeding, some breeds of horses are quite docile, particularly certain draft horses.|$|E
5|$|In 1552 Mercator {{moved from}} Leuven to Duisburg in the Duchy of Cleves. He never gave {{his reasons for}} the move but several factors may have been involved: not having been born in Brabant he could never be a full citizen of Leuven; Catholic {{intolerance}} of religious dissidents in the Low Countries was becoming ever more aggressive and a man suspected of heresy once would never be trusted; the Erasmian constitution and the religious tolerance of Cleves must have appeared attractive; {{there was to be}} a new university in Duisburg and teachers would be required. He was not alone; over the years to come many more would <b>flee</b> <b>from</b> the oppressive Catholicism of Brabant and Flanders to tolerant cities such as Duisburg.|$|E
5|$|In {{a threat}} display, the mamba usually opens its inky black mouth, spreads its narrow neck-flap and {{sometimes}} hisses. It {{is capable of}} striking at considerable range and occasionally may deliver a series of bites in rapid succession. Its venom is primarily composed of potent neurotoxins that may cause fast onset of symptoms. Despite its reputation for being formidable and highly aggressive, like most snakes, it usually attempts to <b>flee</b> <b>from</b> humans unless threatened or cornered. The black mamba is rated as least concern on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)'s Red List of Endangered species.|$|E

5|$|Péron's {{interview}} describes {{some aspects}} of the behaviour of the King Island emu. He writes that the bird was generally solitary but gathered in flocks of ten to twenty at breeding time, then wandered off in pairs. They ate berries, grass and seaweed, and foraged mainly during morning and evening. They were swift runners, but were apparently slower than the mainland birds, due to being fat. They swam well, but only did so when necessary. They reportedly liked the shade of lagoons and the shoreline, rather than open areas. They used a claw on each wing for scratching themselves. If unable to <b>flee</b> <b>from</b> the hunting dogs of the sealers, they would defend themselves by kicking, which could inflict a great deal of harm.|$|E
