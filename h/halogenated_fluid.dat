40|$|Geikielite and titanoclinohumite in {{association}} with Fo-Mg. Al. Spl-Ap-Phl-An-fassaitic Cpx-Chu-Cal-Dol assemblage, are being reported {{for the first time}} from a marble quarry in the vicinity of Rajapalaiyam town. This locality forms part of the Madurai block of the 550 Ma Southern Granulite Terrain and exhibits metamorphic P-T conditions ranging from 7 - 9 Kbars at 800 - 1000 degreesC as deduced from the Sil-Opx-Grt-Crd-Bt bearing pelitic assemblages. The role of CO 2 {{in the formation of the}} granulites has been dealt with most of the papers, but, only recently attention is being paid to the role of F rich halogenated fluids, in the formation of humite bearing minerals and in the migration of elements like Ti, Zr and REE. The metamorphic fluid activity which led to the formation of the above unique Fo-Spl-Ap-Chu assemblage including the geikielite and titanoclinohumite minerals can be associated with intrusive granites. The charnockitic pods in the deformed calcitic marble zone may also have helped in providing Ti, P, and Zr. K-rich <b>halogenated</b> <b>fluid</b> activity seems to be common to the 550 Ma eastern Gondwana segments...|$|E
40|$|The {{main results}} of an {{experimental}} and numerical investigation on condensation heat transfer inside circular and square cross section mini/microchannels are hereafter presented. The experimental investigation is performed inside a circular and a square cross section channel with hydraulic diameter of around 1 mm: the local heat transfer coefficients are measured during condensation in both channels at varying mass flux, vapour quality, channel inclination and <b>fluid</b> properties. Pure <b>halogenated</b> <b>fluids</b> have been tested. These experimental data are {{used to compare the}} heat transfer characteristics of the two microchannels during condensation and tohighlight the effect of the cross sectional shape. Ad-hoc experimental tests have been performed to show the effect of inclination in the same square cross section microchannel. The experimental results are compared against three-dimensional simulations for {{a better understanding of the}} forces governing condensation inside these geometries. The VOF (Volume Of Fluid) method is used to track the vapour-liquid interface and the effects of interfacial shear stress and surface tension are both taken into account. Depending on the mass flux values, the liquid film is assumed laminar or turbulent while the vapour flow is turbulent for all the simulated mass velocities. At low mass flux, when the effect of shear stress diminishes and surface tension forces compete with gravity force to determine the shape of the liquid film at the wall, the square shape displays better performance than the circular one. Ad-hoc simulations have also been performed with a lower channel diameter for comparison with the 1 mm diameter geometry...|$|R
40|$|In the {{beginnings}} of mechanical refrigeration, {{at the end of}} the nineteenth century, carbon dioxide was one of the first refrigerants to be used in compression-type refrigerating machines, later gaining widespread application mainly onboard refrigerated ships, but common in other sectors of refrigeration as well. It was only immediately after World War II that CO 2 was rapidly eclipsed as a refrigerant, due to the advent of the synthesised <b>halogenated</b> working <b>fluids,</b> addressed as safe and ideal refrigerants at that time. Because of the stratospheric Ozone depletion environmental issue, CFC and HCFC working fluids are now in the process of being phased out of use under the Montreal Protocol. The Global Warming environmental issue casts concern over the use of the new HFC fluids as substitute refrigerants, because of their high GWP values, which make them subject to regulations under the Kyoto Protocol. In this mixed situation, CO 2 is being revisited as a fully environmentally friendly and safe refrigerant. An intense research activity on its prospective applications is underway in many research establishments in Europe, Japan and North America, and important results have already been reached in exploiting the peculiar characteristics of this high-pressure fluid operated with a transcritical cycle. In some applications CO 2 systems have already been commercialised; this applies to heat pump water heaters, as a brine in indirect systems and in the low temperature stage of cascade systems. The paper critically analyses the prospects for the future return of CO 2 as a working fluid, or sometimes as a brine with change of phase, in important application areas. These include air conditioning and heat pump systems in the residential and commercial sectors, commercial and transport refrigeration and mobile air conditioning...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{hydrofluorocarbons}} (BFCs) {{which were}} developed as alternative refrigerants and insulating foam blowing agents to replace chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) {{is now being}} affected by scientific investigations of greenhouse warming and questions {{about the effects of}} refrigerants and blowing agents on global warming. A Total Equivalent Warming Impact (TEWI) assessment analyzes the environmental affects of these <b>halogenated</b> working <b>fluids</b> in energy consuming applications by combining a direct effect resulting from the inadvertent release of HFCs to the atmosphere with an indirect effect resulting from the combustion of fossil fuels needed to provide the energy to operate equipment using these compounds as working fluids. TEWI is a more balanced measure of environmental impact because it is not based solely on the global warming potential (GWP) of the working fluid. It also shows the environmental benefit of efficient technologies that result in less CO{sub 2 } generation and eventual emission to the earth`s atmosphere. The goal of TEWI is to assess total global warming impact of all the gases released to the atmosphere, including CO{sub 2 } emissions from energy conversion. Alternative chemicals and technologies have been proposed as substitutes for HFCs in the vapor-compression cycle for refrigeration and air conditioning and for polymer foams in appliance and building insulations which claim substantial environmental benefits. Among these alternatives are: (1) Hydrocarbon (HC) refrigerants and blowing agents which have zero ozone depleting potential and a negligible global warming potential, (2) CO{sub 2 } as a refrigerant and blowing agent, (3) Ammonia (NH{sub 3 }) vapor compression systems, (4) Absorption chiller and heat pumping cycles using ammonia/water or lithium bromide/water, and (5) Evacuated panel insulations. This paper summarizes major results and conclusions of the detailed final report on the TEWI- 111 study...|$|R
