40|$|Potato {{production}} and prices in Indonesia {{are linked to}} the global economy through international trade. Indonesian exports of fresh table potatoes rose steadily {{for more than a decade}} before peaking in 1995 at 103, 000 tonnes, or about 10 percent of national potato production. Exports have since declined by more than two-thirds from their peak. This paper examines trends in potato trade in Indonesia and the system of export marketing in North Sumatra. It is in small farms in this province in Indonesia where nearly all potatoes grown for the country’s export market are produced. To gather data and information, the authors used a rapid market appraisal methodology, including semi-structured interviews with key informants and analysis of secondary market data. Potato marketing channels, costs and margins were also assessed. The marketing systems appeared to be competitive and functioned with relative efficiency. Interviews with potato traders in the major <b>import</b> <b>destination</b> of Singapore revealed that Indonesian potatoes are preferred for their freshness, tast...|$|E

To measure trade competition and the consequent strategic interdependence among trading countries, we develop a new measure, structural equivalence, which assesses competitive threats that a country faces from others whose firms export the same products to the same <b>importing</b> <b>destinations.</b> Employing this new measure, we analyze a panel of 140 countries {{for the period of}} 1980 - 2003.

We then test separately whether trade competition abets upward and downward environmental races. We find that trade competition among structurally equivalent countries abets downward {{races in the}} case of air pollution. Our analyses do not lend support to the race to the top hypothesis for either air or water pollution. This suggests that countries respond asymmetrically to pressures when their structurally equivalent competitors ratchet down their regulations as opposed to ratcheting up their regulations. ...|$|R

40|$|Examining {{the current}} extent of trade between South Korea and Australia (specifically New South Wales), this paper argues {{that there is}} likely to be {{significant}} value from the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement (KAFTA), particularly for agricultural exporters. Introduction The Republic of Korea (South Korea) {{is one of the most}} significant trading partners for Australia, and specifically New South Wales, ranking 3 rd as an export and 7 th as an <b>import</b> <b>destination</b> nationally and at the State level. Given this, there are likely to be significant economic gains for both countries once the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement (KAFTA) is formalised. According to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the agreement will result in a $ 653 million a year boost to the Australian economy. There will be a number of significant tariff and non-tariff economic gains from this agreement for both South Korea and Australia. The envisaged boost to Australian exporters comes as the KAFTA will see import tariffs in South Korea removed on the majority of exports. South Korean exporters will experience similar benefits once Australian import tariffs are removed. In the non-tariff area, Australian telecommunication companies will be able to have much greater control over South Korean service suppliers and Australian financial service suppliers will be able to open in South Korea. It will also be easier for South Korean companies to invest in Australia, with the foreign investment review threshold to be increased from $ 248 million to $ 1. 078 billion. The NSW Department of Trade and Investment, which identified South Korea as one of the State’s top ten priority markets in the NSW International Engagement Strategy, welcomed the announcement that Australia had concluded the KAFTA negotiations. This paper will specifically estimate the value from tariff reductions as they relate to merchandise exports. Its main finding is that, over the period of implementation, there {{is likely to be}} significant value for Australia (and New South Wales) from this FTA, particularly for agricultural exporters. As a preliminary to that analysis, this paper examines the current extent and nature of trade between South Korea and Australia and, more specifically, between South Korea and New South Wales. It should be noted that this paper relates only to tariff reductions under Chapter 2 of the KAFTA. Economic gains related to other components of the KAFTA (e. g. from easing of foreign investment regulation and reductions to barriers in other non-merchandise trade) are not estimated. While there are significant potential benefits for Australian exporters from the KAFTA, it may impact negatively on domestic business in terms of increased competition resulting from cheaper South Korean merchandise imports. This aspect of the KAFTA is not assessed in this paper...|$|E
40|$|The {{trade of}} live marine animals for home and public aquaria {{has grown into}} a major global industry. Millions of marine fishes and {{invertebrates}} are removed from coral reefs and associated habitats each year. The majority are imported into the United States, with the remainder sent to Europe, Japan, {{and a handful of other}} countries. Despite the recent growth and diversification of the aquarium trade, to date, data collection is not mandatory, and hence comprehensive information on species volume and diversity is lacking. This lack of information makes it impossible to study trade pathways. Without species-specific volume and diversity data, it is unclear how importing and exporting governments can oversee this industry effectively or how sustainability should be encouraged. To expand our knowledge and understanding of the trade, and to effectively communicate this new understanding, we introduce the publically-available Marine Aquarium Biodiversity and Trade Flow online database ([URL] This tool was created to communicate the volume and diversity of marine fishes and/or invertebrates imported into the US over three complete years (2008, 2009, and 2011) and three partial years (2000, 2004, 2005). To create this tool, invoices pertaining to shipments of live marine fishes and invertebrates were scanned and analyzed for species name, species quantities, country of origin, port of entry, and city of <b>import</b> <b>destination.</b> Here we focus on the analysis of the later three years of data and also produce an estimate for the entirety of 2000, 2004, and 2005. The three-year aggregate totals (2008, 2009, 2011) indicate that just under 2, 300 fish and 725 invertebrate species were imported into the US cumulatively, although just under 1, 800 fish and 550 invertebrate species were traded annually. Overall, the total number of live marine animals decreased between 2008 and 2011. In 2008, 2009, and 2011, the total number of individual fish (8. 2, 7. 3, and 6. 9 million individuals) and invertebrates (4. 2, 3. 7, and 3. 6 million individuals) assessed by analyzing the invoice data are roughly 60 % of the total volumes recorded through the Law Enforcement Management Information System (LEMIS) dataset. Using these complete years, we back-calculated the number of individuals of both fishes and invertebrates imported in 2000, 2004, and 2005. These estimates (9. 3, 10. 8, and 11. 2 million individual fish per year) were consistent with the three years of complete data. We also use these data to understand the global trade in two species (Banggai cardinalfish, Pterapogon kauderni, and orange clownfish, Amphiprion ocellaris / percula) recently considered for Endangered Species Act listing.

40|$|The {{intention}} {{of this paper}} is to provide "for the first time " a conceptual framework on how a level of IPRs is linked to bilateral intra-industry trade (IIT) flows. The proposed analysis of the rela-tionship between IPRs and IIT {{of this paper is}} couched in a simple and intuitive framework that answers a positive question of how intellectual property rights (IPRs-) induced market expansion, and market power effects are related to the horizontal and vertical intra-industry trade flows. The proposed intuitive framework introduces a demand-side approach and a supply-side approach in explaining the link between IPRs and intra-industry trade (IIT) flows. The supply-side approach explores how a country’s IPRs affect its own exports (supply). In contrast, the demand-side ap-proach examines the effect a country’s IPRs have on its own imports (demand). The presented conceptual framework of this paper provides intuitive evidence that in determining bilateral in-tra-industry trade (IIT) flows in a two-country world, the demand approach posits that bilateral trade flows may increase or decrease due to improvements in IPRs in the <b>importing</b> <b>destination</b> country, while the supply-side approach states that the bilateral trade flows may also increase or decrease due to strong (high) IPRs in the exporting country.

40|$|Illegal, {{unregulated}} and unreported (IUU) {{fishing is}} a major problem in many of the world's fisheries. The stocks most severely impacted centre on those characterised by high economic value, such as abalone, as well as long lived and slow growing species such as Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides). Effective management of these stocks as well as assessment of the impacts of IUU fishing on the resources is impeded by the technical difficulties associated with determining the magnitude of the IUU catches. The South African abalone Haliotis midae fishery rates as an extreme example of extraordinarily high levels of illegal and unreported (IU) catch. To assess the level and trends in IU catches, we used a combination of approaches that included collation of confiscation records from law enforcement, development of a novel index (the confiscations per unit policing effort—CPUPE), estimation of illegal catches using a spatial and age-structured assessment model, and cross-checking of model outputs through comparison with trade data on abalone <b>imports</b> in <b>destination</b> countries. The model-predicted 2008 IU estimate was 860 tonnes, more than 10 times the total allowable catch (TAC) for that year, and implied that, on average, 14 % of all IU catches are confiscated. Associated management responses included the listing of H. midae on Appendix III of CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora), and a temporary closure of the commercial fishery. We summarise both technical and management lessons to be learnt from this integrated approach to assess and verify the magnitude of IU fishing...|$|R
40|$|This report {{provides}} an overview of the world trade of lighting fixtures industry, with 2012 production and consumption data at world-wide level and data on the evolution (2007 - 2012) of lighting fixtures trade in 60 countries selected according to their contribution to international trade of lighting fixtures. The world imports and exports of lighting fixtures are broken down by geographical area (European Union 27 + Norway and Switzerland, Central and Eastern Europe outside the EU & Russia, Asia and Pacific, Middle East and Africa, North and South America) and by High Income countries and Middle and Low Income countries. Trade data are also available in a country format: historical series on lighting fixtures exports and imports, origin of <b>imports</b> and <b>destination</b> of exports, country rankings to place all statistics in a broad worldwide context and allowing comparisons among specific interest areas. The report offers opportunities for lighting fixtures exporters, arising from the increasing openness of markets and a rich collection of key country-data, allowing comparisons among specific interest areas. Products considered as core of the research: residential lighting, commercial lighting, Christmas and traffic lighting, Lighting fixtures components.

40|$|The {{impact of}} tourism {{consumption}} on imports has hardly {{been discussed in}} the literature. The issue {{is an important one}} however, and must be explained further in relation to the evaluation of the impact that tourism, or tourism events in particular, have on a <b>destination.</b> <b>Imports</b> can be seen to be a leakage that limits the positive impact of expenditure on a destination. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to discuss the principal methodological questions that arise in the estimation of the impact of tourism consumption on import flows and to explore how this methodology can be applied to tourism events. Various methodologies are available for analysing the relationship between expenditure on tourism events and imports: the open and the closed input-output models, the social accounting matrix model and computable general equilibrium models. The advantages and disadvantages of each model in the context of tourism events are explained and some advantages in terms of coherence of the open input-output models are highlighted. Examples are used to illustrate the relevance of import leakages and the application of the methods proposed...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} {{relationship}} between exporting/importing status and firm productivity. We use a rich product-firm-level dataset providing both revenue and quantities of all products for a large panel of Danish manufacturing firms over the period 1998 - 2005 and link it to another dataset describing firms’ international trade transactions by product. We use our detailed product level information to compute a firm level deflator and avoid the criticism of biased estimates due {{to the use of}} industry level deflator. We find that both importing and exporting behaviours are strongly associated with productivity, but firms involved in both importing and exporting are the most productive. We also find evidence of a self-selection into importing and exporting but no learning effect. Finally, we try to distinguish between cost effect and product quality effect by analyzing the importance of the origin of <b>imports</b> and the <b>destination</b> of exports. We find that both imports from countries with abundant and cheap labor like China and from countries with similar level of development matter, although the mechanism through which productivity is affected is likely to be different. In addition, exporting to more distant OECD economies is more strongly associated to productivity than exporting to neighboring or other EU countries, especially when controlling for the price specific effectno; keywords...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I analyse the export {{behaviour}} of firms located in different Central European countries (Austria, Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovakia) {{with respect to}} migration. Ever since the seminal article by Gould (1994) on immigrant links to their home country and due to empirical research following his contribution, it is a well established result that immigrants from a particular country spur exports to and <b>imports</b> from that <b>destination.</b> Chaney (2008) shows that a decrease in fixed costs of exporting increases the number of exporters (extensive margin), whereas a reduction in variable costs also increases the volume exported by each exporting firm (intensive margin). Empirical contributions using firm-level data focus on various aspects influencing costs of exporting (like spillover effects of nearby firms or financial factors), but leave out the issue of migration. I combine detailed information coming from a questionnaire conducted among 8, 300 firms on the export behaviour to different countries with regional data on migration from the European Labour Force Survey (LFS). I find evidence that both the propensity to export and – to a much smaller extent – the volume of sales of exporting firms to a particular destination is higher for firms located in regions with {{a larger number of}} immigrants from that country. I conclude that migrants mainly reduce fixed costs of exporting. Firm-level data, Export destinations, Immigrants, Margins of trade...|$|R
40|$|The {{scheme of}} a three-scale {{input-output}} analysis {{is presented in}} this study to investigate the water use profile of the urban economy in Beijing. Defined as total water including direct and indirect water, embodied water for an urban economy supported by massive domestic and foreign trade can be decomposed into nine categories corresponding to three sources (local withdrawal, domestic imports, and foreign <b>imports)</b> and three <b>destinations</b> (local final demand, domestic exports, and foreign exports). Based on statistics for Beijing in 2010, the case urban economy is endowed with just 3. 53 billion m 3 of local water withdrawal, whereas the total embodied water demand is estimated up to 13. 61 billion m 3, almost quadruple the local water withdrawal. The extra 10. 08 billion m 3 of indirect water use is obtained via cross-boundary trade. Overall, Beijing's total water demand is satisfied mainly by domestic imports by a share of more than 60 %, and partly by foreign imports by a share of around 20 %. The unintentionally induced water embodied in domestic and global trade plays {{an essential role in}} satisfying the water demand, which has essential implications for decision making to ease urban water scarcity.

Followed up by the Director General of Customs and Excise No. Kep- 205 /BC / 2003 : That to increase non-oil exports is necessary to simplify the procedures for granting Ease <b>Import</b> Export <b>Destination</b> Facility (KITE). The method used descriptive survey of a sample unit by 33 employees in the Office of Import Facility for Export Purpose (KITE) Regional Office of Directorate General of Customs and Excise, West Java, which consists of the Head of Customs Facilities, Head of Section, Head of Sub Division of General, Inspector, Officer Receiver Documents, Technical Support Officer, and other employees. Testing research hypotheses using path analysis, to data processing results of questionnaires used a computer program microsoft office excel and SPSS for Windows Version 17. 00. Based on the results of research and discussion, it can be concluded that cultural relations organization, the physical condition of the office, and the individual needs of employees with employee service performance are positive and are in a strong category. Meaning positive relationship here is if the organizational culture and the physical condition of the office increased, as well as individual needs are met with a good employee, then the employee will increase service performance. Organizational culture, the physical condition of the office, and the needs of individual employees {{have a significant effect on}} the performance of employee services in West Java Regional Office KITE by 79. 79 %. The influence of organizational culture contributed by 21. 53 %, the physical condition of the office by 46. 46 %, and the individual needs of employees amounted to 11. 8 %, and the remaining 20. 21 % influenced by other factors outside of this research, such as leadership style, work motivation, and career development.
