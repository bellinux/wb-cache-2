40|$|MODELLING OF LUMPY CLAY FILLS Jan Najser Abstract An {{extensive}} {{open cast mining}} {{of brown}} coal has been taking place in NW Bohemia since 1940 's. During the mining process, overburden clay {{is placed in the}} form of irregularly shaped lumps of typical dimensions up to 500 mm into large spoil heaps. The total thickness of the lumpy clay landfills is usually 20 - 50 m. Their material has a double porosity structure: the porosity of intact clay (intragranular porosity) and the voids between clay lumps (intergranular porosity). The total porosity of the fresh fill can be up to 70 %. This soil presents special challenges for geotechnical design, primarily because of its high and non-uniform settlement. Further, the progressive tranformation from the "granular" to "fine-grained" material makes the lumpy clay difficult to characterise and model. The aim of the presented thesis is to describe the behaviour of the landfill and the change of its structure by means of field measurements, the centrifuge and numerical modelling. During site investigation for a motorway over a 20 - 30 years old landfill, two trial embankments were built and monitored over the period of 3 and 6 years respectively.

To this end, PAL-XFEL equipment {{has to be kept}} precisely aligned (Linear Accelerator +/- 100 um, Undulator +/- 50 um). As a part of the process for installing PAL-XFEL, a GPS-used surface geodetic network is being constructed for precise equipment measurement and alignment, and the installation of a tunnel measurement network inside buildings is in preparation; additionally, the fiducialization of major equipment is underway. After PAL-XFEL equipment is optimized and aligned, if the ground and buildings go through vertical changes during operation, misalignment (and tilt) of equipment including various magnets and RF structures will cause errors in the electron beam trajectory, which will lead to changes to the beam parameter.

40|$|International audienceMeasurements {{of strain}} and {{vibrations}} due to seismic and volcanic processes are mandatory for the understanding and the {{monitoring of the}} behavior of these systems. In the future, risk mitigation will depend on our capability to detect in a reliable way small precursors of large seismic and volcanic events and to assess the seismic/aseismic spatial and temporal distribution and evolution of crustal strain in these unstable systems. The robustness of strain and motion detection is primary linked to measurement accuracy, but also to the number and repartition of instrument. This implies that instrument cost and maintenance are essential for the development of networks. To date, only GPS sensors are robust enough to be deployed {{for long periods of time}} with limited problems of maintenance. Tiltmeters and strainmeters capabilities are often plagued by numerous technical problems limiting their usefulness. On the basis of existing or prototype sensors, we develop new instruments (seismometers, tiltmeters, strainmeters) using an interferometric motion measurement. Both Laser source and fringe analysis are connected to the mechanical sensor with long optic fiber (100 m - 10 km) depending on applications (volcanoes, sea bottom, boreholes) The fiber signal transmission is a major improvement by comparison with usual electric wires (cost, data channels, lightning, weight). Also, the absence of embedded electronic on the sensor is a guarantee for reliability and toughness. The proposed optical cell is an extrinsic all-fiber Fabry-Perot type interferometer (EFFPI). While being intrinsically insensitive to external perturbations to the sensing arm such as from stress/strain and temperature variations, the EFFPI is, however, extremely sensitive to changes in its sensing cavity length caused by parameters such as displacement, strain, and mechanical deformation along the optical axis. Coupled to well-advanced associated technologies in terms of laser sources (stability, output power), optical fiber (quality, low losses, couplers, connectics), photodetection (bandwidth, gain, low-noise) and real-time interferometric signal demodulation, this interferometer is today a mature device whose performance potential can be exploited in in-situ environmental monitoring of seismic activities (earthquakes and volcanoes) and in predicting the related risks. In the framework of the LINES project, we develop three types of mechanical sensors: a long baseline tiltmeter based on <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>levelling,</b> a borehole tiltmeter based on a simple pendulum and a seismometer for detecting vibrations at frequencies higher than 1 Hz. A common building principle is an external laser source and phase detector: as this part of the tool is remotely connected through an optic fiber to the underground sensor, this overcomes most of electric, power and maintenance problem occurring with non-optical devices. Moreover, this allows simple analog data transmission for a real-time network monitoring.
