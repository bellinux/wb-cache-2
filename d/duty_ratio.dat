50|$|When a load is {{directly}} connected to the solar panel, the operating point of the panel will rarely be at peak power. The impedance seen by the panel derives the operating point of the solar panel. Thus by varying the impedance seen by the panel, the operating point can be moved towards peak power point. Since panels are DC devices, DC-DC converters must be utilized to transform the impedance of one circuit (source) to the other circuit (load). Changing the <b>duty</b> <b>ratio</b> of the DC-DC converter results in an impedance change as seen by the panel. At a particular impedance (or <b>duty</b> <b>ratio)</b> the operating point {{will be at the}} peak power transfer point. The I-V curve of the panel can vary considerably with variation in atmospheric conditions such as radiance and temperature.

In this study, embossing stamp and substrate with different geometries are used to investigate the flow behavior under both isothermal and non-isothermal conditions.

40|$|A new discrete-amplitude {{pulse width}} {{modulation}} (DAPWM) scheme for a high-efficiency linear power amplifier is proposed. A radio frequency (RF) input signal is divided into an envelope and a phase modulated carrier. The low-frequency envelope is modulated {{so that it can}} be represented by a pulse whose area is proportional to its amplitude. The modulated pulse has at least two different pulse amplitude levels in order that the <b>duty</b> <b>ratios</b> of the pulse are kept large for small input. Then, an RF pulse train is generated by mixing the modulated envelope with the phase modulated carrier. The RF pulse train is amplified by a switching-mode power amplifier, and the original RF input signal is restored by a band pass filter. Because <b>duty</b> <b>ratios</b> of the RF pulse train are kept large in spite of a small input envelope, the DAPWM technique can reduce loss from harmonic components. Furthermore, it reduces filtering efforts required to suppress harmonic components. Simulations show that the overall efficiency of the pulsed power amplifier with DAPWM is about 60. 3 % for a mobile WiMax signal.

40|$|Direct torque control(DTC) of an {{induction}} motor fed by a {{voltage source inverter}} is a simple scheme that does not need long computation time and can be implanted without mechanical speed sensors and is insensitive to parameter variations. In principle, the motor terminal voltages and currents are sampled and used to estimate the motor flux and torque. Based on estimates of the flux position and the instantaneous errors in torque and stator flux magnitude, a voltage vector is selected to restrict the torque and the flux errors within their respective torque and flux hysteresis bands. In the conventional DTC, the selected voltage vector is applied for the whole switching period regardless {{of the magnitude of}} the torque error. This can result in high torque ripple. A better drive performance can be achieved by varying the <b>duty</b> <b>ratio</b> of the selected voltage vector during each switching period according to the magnitude of the torque error and position of the stator flux.
