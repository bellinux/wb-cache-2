Having previously played professional rugby league and Australian rules football, <b>Hunt</b> <b>is</b> {{the first person}} in Australia to have reached elite professional level in three different football codes. He was born in Auckland, New Zealand but has represented Australia in both rugby codes after his family emigrated there when he was eleven years old.|$|E
5|$|On March 3, 2006, Williams {{appeared}} on Larry King Live where Paul McCartney and then wife Heather Mills argued the seal hunt was inhumane because seal cubs were being clubbed to death. Williams said the annual <b>hunt</b> <b>is</b> supported by scientists, veterinarians and {{organizations like the}} UN and the World Wildlife Fund, and that 90% of seals are killed by bullet. Williams accused the McCartneys of being used by IFAW, Greenpeace and PETA to help them raise funds. He then invited the McCartneys to visit Newfoundland and Labrador.|$|E

5|$|Captain Jack Sparrow is on a {{quest to}} find the fabled Fountain of Youth and crosses paths with a former lover, Angelica. She forces Jack aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge, a ship captained by the infamous pirate Blackbeard, Angelica's father. Both are also {{in search of the}} Fountain; Angelica to save her father's soul, Blackbeard to escape a prophecy of his demise {{at the hands of a}} one-legged man. Joining the <b>hunt</b> <b>is</b> former pirate captain Barbossa, now a {{privateer}} in King George II's Navy, who is in a race against the Spanish for the Fountain of Youth.|$|E
5|$|The Mounties {{convince}} Kripik {{to come to}} {{the post}} to answer questions, and Kripik agrees. Several months pass. Hunt and Balk give Kripik the freedom of the post, and Hunt learns about the horrors the white traders visited on the Eskimo. When the Eskimo village moves on to new hunting rounds, Kripik's family stays behind to wait for him. They begin to starve, and Kripik learns of their plight. However, the rigid and rule-bound Inspector White has arrived at the RCMP outpost, and he demands that Kripik not only no longer be allowed to hunt during the day but also be chained down in his bed at night. Hunt tries to dissuade White, but White insists — and <b>Hunt</b> <b>is</b> forced to break his word that Kripik will not be chained.|$|E
5|$|The deer- and boar-hunting {{scenes are}} less clearly connected, {{although}} scholars {{have attempted to}} link each animal to Gawain's reactions in the parallel seduction scene. Attempts to connect the deer hunt with the first seduction scene have unearthed a few parallels. Deer hunts of the time, like courtship, {{had to be done}} according to established rules. Women often favoured suitors who hunted well and skinned their animals, sometimes even watching while a deer was cleaned. The sequence describing the deer <b>hunt</b> <b>is</b> relatively unspecific and nonviolent, with an air of relaxation and exhilaration. The first seduction scene follows in a similar vein, with no overt physical advances and no apparent danger; the entire exchange is humorously portrayed.|$|E
50|$|Albert <b>Hunt</b> <b>was</b> the {{inventor}} of the wigwag, a grade crossing signal used in transportation. <b>Hunt</b> <b>was</b> a mechanical engineer from Southern California.

5|$|An {{examination}} of a hunting tradition in northern Europe follows, where falcons assist humans in hunting by catching wild game, such as rabbits and pheasants. Further collaboration with man and animal is highlighted, {{this time with}} cheetahs. To demonstrate the cheetah's speed and effectiveness, a chase between a group of cheetahs and ostriches is arranged, in which the birds are hunted down and killed. The next animal collaborators are dogs, which hunt wild boar in Patagonia and a puma which has attacked a herd of sheep and a shepherd. In cities, however, stray dogs are the ones hunted by dog catchers, which the narrator claims demonstrates that the <b>hunt</b> <b>is</b> still active, but the prey has changed. Indios also use dogs to hunt monkeys, but their efforts are compared to mercenaries hunting the Indios themselves to clear them from their native land for development. In one such instance, mercenaries retaliate against a death of a workman by hunting down a group of Indios, one of which they torture, castrate and murder. Various scenes of wildlife are then shown, after which orangutans are hunted {{to be sold to}} zoos. The film then ends with the coexistence of man and animal between Erik Zimen, an ecologist, and wolves, the group of animals he wishes to save.|$|E
5|$|Grand Teton National Park is {{the only}} U.S. National Park that permits hunting, but only of elk {{in an effort to}} keep the populations of that species regulated. This {{provision}} was included in the legislation that combined Jackson Hole National Monument and Grand Teton National Park in 1950. While some National Parks in Alaska permit subsistence hunting by indigenous natives and a few other National Park Service managed areas allow hunting under highly regulated circumstances, hunting in U.S. National Parks is not generally allowed. In Grand Teton National Park, hunters are required to obtain Wyoming hunting licenses and be deputized as park rangers. Hunting is restricted to areas east of the Snake River and north of Moran, Wyoming, the <b>hunt</b> <b>is</b> permitted only east of U.S. Route 89. Proponents of continuing the elk hunt, which occurs in the fall, argue that the elk herd would become overpopulated without it, leading to vegetation degradation from overgrazing elk herds. Opponents cite that there has been an increase of predators such as the wolf and grizzly bear in Grand Teton National Park, rendering the annual hunt unnecessary and exposing hunters to attacks by grizzly bears as they become accustomed to feeding on remains left behind from the hunt.|$|E
5|$|In July 2008, {{speculation}} {{began on}} what Hunt would do past the expiration {{of his contract}} {{at the end of}} the 2009 season. With some high-profile defections of star league players to cashed-up rugby union clubs from France, <b>Hunt</b> <b>is</b> expected to be the target of offers from overseas and within Australia. Australian rugby union club Queensland Reds stated their intentions to attempt to lure Hunt to the rugby union code, with the reasoning being his successful young career in rugby union. From within the NRL competition, Sydney based clubs Sydney Roosters and St. George Illawarra Dragons stated their intentions to make a bid for Hunt for his services in the 2010 season, claiming they could double Hunt's three-year deal from 2006, reported to be around $200,000. The Broncos however, were still expected to be a factor in his decision with the possibility of the captaincy a possible lure to remain with the Broncos.|$|E

5|$|The {{writer of}} the {{scenario}} is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. Lonergan was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The film {{can be seen as}} having another loose aspect to labor issues. The film directly followed first Thanhouser film to address the subject: The Girl Strike Leader. The film loosely refers labor relations when Jack <b>Hunt</b> <b>is</b> killed in a riot while on strike duty and the young widow is struggles to make ends meet. Thanhouser subjects would deal with other pressing social issues in The Girls of the Ghetto, another July 1910 release. The plot of The Lucky Shot employed the deus ex machina technique to resolve the financial needs of the widow and her child. Another plot of a needy family suddenly finding a concealed fortune within their house would be reused in The Thunderbolt. The film director and the cameraman are unknown and the only credits known for the cast is that of Marie Eline as the little boy and Mrs. George W. Walters {{in the role of the}} miserly woman. Other members cast may have included the other leading players of the Thanhouser productions, Anna Rosemond, Frank H. Crane and Violet Heming.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, for {{progress}} of the semiconductor devices, synchronous motor is used for variable speed drive. However, the hunting often gives rise to speed fluctuation of the rotor. In this paper, the occurring conditions of <b>hunting</b> <b>is</b> investigated by Lyapunov's direct method, and the suppression control of the <b>hunting</b> <b>is</b> proposed. The all machine parameters and drive frequency affect the hunting. In these analysis, the physical aspect of <b>hunting</b> <b>is</b> derived from simulations. The suppression control that bases on the physical aspect of the <b>hunting</b> <b>is</b> proposed. The control method would suppress the hunting perfectly by controlling inverter output voltage...|$|R
