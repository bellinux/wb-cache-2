25|$|As is {{the case}} for Quebec's other {{national}} parks (with the exception of Pingualuit and Kuururjuaq national parks, which are administered by Nunavik parks), the Mont-Saint-Bruno national park has been administered by the Société des établissements de plein air du Québec (SÉPAQ) since 1999. The SÉPAQ oversees the provision of activities and services as well as park protection and promotion. The exploitation of natural resources for forestry, mining or energy production is forbidden, as it is in any other of Quebec's parks, and so are hunting, trapping and poaching. The passage of gas or oil pipelines is also forbidden in all parks except for <b>existing</b> <b>installations.</b>|$|E
25|$|The current edition (17th) of the {{regulations}} requires that all socket outlets in most domestic installations have RCD protection, though there are exemptions. Cables buried in walls must also be RCD protected (again with some specific exemptions). {Refer to 17th Edition Amendment 1 effective from January 2012} Provision of RCD protection for circuits present in bathrooms and shower rooms reduces the requirement for supplementary bonding in those locations. Two RCDs {{may be used to}} cover the installation, with upstairs and downstairs lighting and power circuits spread across both RCDs. When one RCD trips, power is maintained to at least one lighting and power circuit. Other arrangements, {{such as the use of}} RCBOs, may be employed to meet {{the regulations}}. The new requirements for RCDs do not affect most <b>existing</b> <b>installations</b> unless they are rewired, the distribution board is changed, a new circuit is installed, or alterations are made such as additional socket outlets or new cables buried in walls.|$|E

2500|$|The {{level of}} {{remuneration}} is still prescribed under the EEG until 2017. [...] However {{the way that}} new installations receive their remuneration has changed. [...] Most plant operators must now directly market their output, for which they get an additional market premium payment instead of an explicit feed-in tariff. [...] This premium {{is the difference between}} the average monthly wholesale price at the EEX energy exchange and the fixed remuneration stated in the EEG. [...] Installations under 100kW are exempt from these provisions and <b>existing</b> <b>installations</b> will continue to operate under the rules under which they were established. [...] From 2014–2017 onwards, defined remuneration rates will be replaced by competitive bidding, also known as auctions or tenders. [...] Those investors offering the lowest prices will then receive support. [...] The new act does not specify the auction model in detail, but potential designs were piloted in 2015 using ground-mounted photovoltaic systems.|$|E
