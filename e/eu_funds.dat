25|$|Like other post-socialist {{regimes in}} eastern Europe, Bulgaria found the {{transition}} to capitalism rather painful and not easy as expected. State-owned enterprises lost their former markets and could not adapt to the now free-market competition. This led to massive unemployment {{in the city and}} emigration waves in 90s. Since 2000, Ruse has been continually regaining its former leading status.

25|$|Six {{territories of}} the Netherlands — {{all of which}} are Caribbean islands — have OCT status.

The {{inhabitants}} of the islands are EU citizens owing to their Dutch citizenship, with the right to vote in elections to the European Parliament. Initially they did not have voting rights for such elections, but the European Court of Justice granted them such rights, when they ruled their exclusion from the franchise was contrary to EU law, as all other Dutch citizens resident outside the EU did have the right to vote. None of the islands use the euro as their currency. The US dollar is used on Bonaire, St. Eustatius and Saba, while Curaçao and St. Maarten utilize their own shared currency the Antillean guilder, and finally the currency of Aruba is the Aruban florin.|$|E

Prime Minister Milanović welcomed the decision as historic and as the first such decision made by Croatians alone; {{he also said that}} the referendum represented a turning point for Croatia. Croatian Parliament Speaker Boris Šprem said that a new chapter of Croatian history and better fortune for the nation was dawning. The Croatian Minister of the Economy, Radimir Čačić, concluded that Croatia's credit rating would have been downgraded if the referendum had not passed. He also stated that, since the referendum passed, it was a good opportunity to upgrade the rating. Minister of Finance Slavko Linić stated that he was pleased with the result, but not with the voter turnout. He disagreed with Čačić that the credit rating could be saved by this result, since everybody had already counted on Croatian entry to the EU. Foreign and European Affairs Minister Vesna Pusić {{commented that the}} result was good news for Europe, which faced internal problems. Former Speaker Vladimir Šeks said that the low turnout was caused by external factors– the debt crisis in Europe and a loss of confidence in Croatian political parties and institutions. Luka Bebić, also a former speaker of the Parliament, added that it was good that Croats had voted to join the EU. Former Croatian foreign minister Gordan Jandroković commented that the result is especially important for the nation's youth, and former Croatian President Stjepan Mesić stated that Croatia should be competitive and use <b>EU</b> <b>funds,</b> adding that {{it is not enough to}} be happy with entering the EU. He also commented on claims that joining the EU was tantamount to entering a new Yugoslavia, saying that [...] "only idiots think that Yugoslavia should be renewed".|$|E
