50|$|He {{was one of}} the few Labour MPs to {{represent}} a predominantly rural area and concentrated on agriculture and <b>EEC</b> <b>issues.</b> Although mildly supportive of devolution, Thomas was opposed to what he regarded as the excesses of Welsh nationalism.|$|R
50|$|After the {{reversal}} of the disarmament issue, the CDS returned to its efforts to oppose Clause IV. The CDS also supported British entry into the European Economic Community, which most Gaitskellites supported. CDS influence began to wane, first with the splitting of Gaitskell over the <b>EEC</b> <b>issue</b> in 1962, then with his death and replacement as party leader by the Bevanite Harold Wilson in 1963, a position he retained until 1976. After Wilson became Prime Minister in the 1964 general elections the CDS shut down.|$|R
40|$|In December 1982 the National Council for the Aged {{published}} a discussion document entitled, Retirement: A General Review. The document raised a <b>number</b> of important <b>issues</b> {{including that of}} flexible retirement. It pointed out {{that one of the}} remarkable aspects of retirement {{is the extent to which}} 65 became accepted as the normal age of retirement. This has never been satisfactorily explained. There are no economic, social, gerontological or other reasons for the selection of this particular age. The practice of compulsory retirement at a fixed age is now being questioned and the principle is gaining acceptance that people should be given the maximum opportunity to choose their time of retirement within reasoflable limits. In December 1982 the <b>EEC</b> <b>issued</b> a recommendation to member states on the principles of a Community policy with regard to retirement age...|$|R

50|$|However, {{many of the}} Gaitskellites held leading {{positions}} in Harold Wilson's Cabinet of 1964-70. Many of them - e.g. Roy Jenkins and Bill Rodgers but not Anthony Crosland or Douglas Jay - became supporters of British membership of the <b>EEC,</b> an <b>issue</b> on which Labour was split in the 1970s and which helped to precipitate the SDP split of 1981.|$|R
40|$|In Part I, after {{discussing}} the international context, this Article outlines the <b>EEC</b> <b>issues.</b> Part II traces the early development {{of freedom of}} services and shows how there was reluctance to implement freedom of services. As will be shown in Part III, the European Court of Justice accorded direct effect to freedom of services so that this freedom can be invoked before state courts; it has preeminence over state rules that restrain freedom of services. Part IV discusses the other freedoms that contribute to freedom of services. The policy on coordination and approximation of laws, i. e. the policy on Community legislation, has undergone quite a change, which can be traced {{in the field of}} services. This trend will be explored in Part V. Finally, in Part VI, broadcasting and insurance will be used as examples of the ongoing struggle between preservation of state powers {{on the one hand and}} the striving for freedom of services in the Common Market on the other...|$|R
