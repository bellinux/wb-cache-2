We're just people. #AllLivesMatter," [...] to which Baer responded with a scathing column on Crashburn Alley, a blog affiliated with ESPN, in which he stated that De Fratus is [...] "complicit in perpetuating a system which inflicts violence on those who didn’t {{have the luxury of}} being born white and male and straight and in an economically-stable area." [...] Subsequently, De Fratus penned a retort to Baer via Facebook, in which he commented, [...] "I sincerely hope that you will take the time to talk to me personally next time before you decide to hide behind your computer screen and criticize me, my upbringing and my character based on 140 characters. I do not apologize for anything I have said. I have a platform and <b>I</b> <b>WILL</b> <b>use</b> it for the agenda of love." ...|$|E
500|$|Farmer {{waited until}} {{three weeks before}} the primary {{election}} to begin seriously campaigning and focused on population centers such as Lexington, Louisville, Bowling Green, and the Northern Kentucky area, where Republican voters were more concentrated. At that time, campaign finance reports showed that Farmer had spent about half of the $36,055 raised for his campaign, while his opponent, Leonard [...] "Buck" [...] Beasley, had raised only $450 and spent nothing. While he proposed no major changes to the operation of the agriculture department, Farmer emphasized teamwork as a means to improve the state's agricultural sector, cited the need to find new markets for Kentucky agricultural products, and expressed a desire to improve the public perception of the agriculture industry, saying [...] "Farmers have a great story to tell, and <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>use</b> any name recognition I have gained through my experience with UK basketball to help them tell it." [...] He also raised the possibility of engaging other former basketball players to promote the work of the agriculture department and indicated that he would lobby to have half of Kentucky's allocation of the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement directed to the state's Agriculture Development Board.|$|E
2500|$|According {{to various}} sources, Talaat Pasha had {{developed}} plans {{to eliminate the}} Armenians as early as 1910. Danish philologist Johannes Østrup wrote in his memoirs that {{in the autumn of}} 1910, Talaat talked openly about his plans to [...] "exterminate" [...] the Armenians with him. According to Østrup, Talaat stated: [...] "If I ever come to power in this country, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>use</b> all my might to exterminate the Armenians." [...] In November of that year, a decision to carry out such a plan was made in Thessaloniki where a secret conference was held by prominent members of the CUP. The conference concluded that the Ottoman Empire, which promoted equality among Muslims and non-Muslims alike, was not ideologically compatible anymore, and that the Ottoman Empire should adopt a policy of Turkification. Talaat, who attended the conference, was a leading advocate of this policy shift and stated in a speech that: [...] "there can be no question of equality, until we have succeeded in our task of ottomanizing the Empire." [...] Such a decision ultimately required the assimilation of non-Turkish elements within the empire and if necessary, it could be done through force. British ambassador Gerard Lowther concluded after the conference that the: [...] "committee have given up any idea of Ottomanizing all the non-Turkish elements by sympathetic and Constitutional ways has long been manifest. To them 'Ottoman' evidently means 'Turk' and their present policy of 'Ottomanization' is one of pounding the non-Turkish elements in a Turkish mortar." ...|$|E
