5|$|Enzyme {{kinetics}} cannot prove which {{modes of}} catalysis {{are used by}} an enzyme. However, some <b>kinetic</b> <b>data</b> can suggest possibilities to be examined by other techniques. For example, a ping–pong mechanism with burst-phase pre-steady-state kinetics would suggest covalent catalysis might be important in this enzyme's mechanism. Alternatively, the observation of a strong pH effect on Vmax but not Km might indicate that a residue in the active site {{needs to be in}} a particular ionisation state for catalysis to occur.|$|E
5|$|The Lineweaver–Burk plot or double {{reciprocal}} plot is {{a common}} way of illustrating <b>kinetic</b> <b>data.</b> This is produced by taking the reciprocal of {{both sides of the}} Michaelis–Menten equation.

In the case of using benzyldimethylsilane as a directing group it is proposed that benzyldimethylsilane reacts with the trisboryl iridium catalyst through reversible addition of the Si-H bond to the metal center, followed by selective ortho-C–H bond activation via oxidative addition and reductive elimination.|$|E

500|$|Knowledge of the enzyme's {{structure}} is helpful in interpreting <b>kinetic</b> <b>data.</b> [...] For example, the structure can suggest how substrates and products bind during catalysis; what changes occur during the reaction; {{and even the}} role of particular amino acid residues in the mechanism. [...] Some enzymes change shape significantly during the mechanism; in such cases, {{it is helpful to}} determine the enzyme structure with and without bound substrate analogues that do not undergo the enzymatic reaction.|$|E
500|$|The most {{striking}} {{outcomes of the}} analysis of Kinesin-5 motility {{is that it is}} slow – about 10 times slower than conventional Kinesin-1 – with a velocity in the range of 50 nanometers per second and that it could generate very high levels of mechanical force (7-9 picoNewtons per molecule). [...] These values come from three types of experimental data: microtubule gliding assays, single molecule motility assays, and optical trap assays. In microtubule gliding assays, kinesins are attached to a glass surface and microtubules are laid down over the top. [...] Since the motors are attached to the glass, their motile behavior translates into movement of the microtubule across the anchored kinesins, akin to someone crowd surfing. [...] These experiments gave us the first analysis of Kinesin-5 motility. [...] By attaching microtubules to the glass surface first, then adding Kinesin-5 with free microtubules in solution, it was possible to adapt the microtubule gliding assays to show that Kinesin-5 can crosslink two microtubules and move them in opposite directions. [...] This experiment showed that Kinesin-5 was indeed capable of carrying out the role that had been proposed for it in mitosis – sliding oppositely oriented microtubules in the mitotic spindle. [...] To study the behavior of individual Kinesin-5 molecules, single molecule motility assays were performed by attaching microtubules to a glass surface, then adding a dilute solution of Kinesin-5 with a fluorophore attached. [...] This experimental setup enables the observer to follow separate Kinesin-5 molecules as they “walk” along the microtubule, providing not only information about velocity, but also about processivity – the ability of a kinesin to take multiple steps along the microtubule without dissociating. [...] In single molecule motility assays, velocities for Kinesin-5 were similar to those seen in microtubule gliding assays, and the motor was observed to be weakly processive. In optical trap experiments, Kinesin-5 molecules are attached to a bead that can be held in place by a finely focused laser. [...] By moving the bead close to a microtubule, the kinesin can bind to the microtubule and begin stepping, pulling the bead along behind it. [...] Since the bead is being held in place by the trap laser, it acts like a spring and exerts a force that resists the forward movement of the kinesin. [...] This allows for the measurement of the stall force – the maximum amount of force that can be exerted by a motor before it releases from the microtubule. [...] Optical trap experiments showed that Kinesin-5 generates a maximum of 7 picoNewtons of force before releasing, but that its behavior differs from that of other kinesins in that there was no observable plateau phase in which the motor “struggles” at its maximal force generation before letting go. [...] Extrapolation of <b>kinetic</b> <b>data</b> suggests that the maximal observed force generated in the optical trap by Kinesin-5 is actually an underestimate and that it theoretically can exert up to 9 picoNewtons of force as a maximum, although further experimental work is required to test this.|$|E
