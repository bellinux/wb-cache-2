He saw nature--he saw books through me; and never did I weary of gazing for his behalf, and of putting into words the effect of <b>field,</b> <b>tree,</b> town, river, cloud, sunbeam--of the landscape before us; of the weather round us--and impressing by sound on his ear what light could no longer stamp on his eye. Never did I weary of reading to him; never did I weary of conducting him where he wished to go: of doing for him what he wished to be done. And there was a pleasure in my services, most full, most exquisite, even though sad--because he claimed these services without painful shame or damping humiliation. He loved me so truly, that he knew no reluctance in profiting by my attendance: he felt I loved him so fondly, that to yield that attendance was to indulge my sweetest wishes.|$|E

His {{donation}} {{of land for}} a railroad station site established the town {{as the center of}} the San Joaquin Valley's [...] booming wheat business. Railroad officials commemorated his vision by naming the fledgling City in his honor. When mining fever began to fade, wheat demand slackened. Kings River water was diverted for crop irrigation, and the region began its over 100-year tradition of bountiful <b>field,</b> <b>tree,</b> and vine fruit harvests. In 1913 the land was developed with cement sidewalks, sewer systems, as well as the construction of the first steel water tower. With water and railroad services in place, farming families of European immigrants were recruited, and the settlement was incorporated in 1913, with Ordinance No. 1 adopting and prescribing the style of a Common Seal on February 25, 1913. An important element in the early town was a colony of German Mennonites, whose strong traditions and values still shape Reedley's culture. The population today is diverse and multicultural and Reedley boasts a current population equal to [...] Each of the town's major ethnic groups has shown strong civic leadership, a desire to retain cultural and religious traditions, and the ability to work successfully together for Reedley's betterment.

The area's 41 organizations and 12 civic clubs include Filipino community organizations, a Finnish organization, and American Lebanese Women's Club, several Hispanic and Latin American organizations, and a Japanese organization among the many sports, cultural, conservation, charitable, and civic associations. In 1988 Reedley celebrated the first 100 years of its multicultural heritage, and the 75th anniversary of incorporation.

40|$|Field {{trees are}} an {{integral}} part of the farmed parkland landscape in West Africa and provide multiple benefits to the local environment and livelihoods. While field trees have received increasing interest in the context of strengthening resilience to climate variability and change, the actual extent of farmed parkland and spatial patterns of tree cover are largely unknown. We used the rule-based predictive modeling tool Cubist® to estimate <b>field</b> <b>tree</b> cover in the west-central agricultural region of Senegal. A collection of rules and associated multiple linear regression models was constructed from (1) a reference dataset of percent tree cover derived from very high spatial resolution data (2 m Orbview) as the dependent variable, and (2) ten years of 10 -day 250 m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) composites and derived phenological metrics as independent variables. Correlation coefficients between modeled and reference percent tree cover of 0. 88 and 0. 77 were achieved for training and validation data respectively, with absolute mean errors of 1. 07 and 1. 03 percent tree cover. The resulting map shows a west-east gradient from high tree cover in the peri-urban areas of horticulture and arboriculture to low tree cover in the more sparsely populated eastern part of the study area. A comparison of current (2000 s) tree cover along this gradient with historic cover as seen on Corona images reveals dynamics of change but also areas of remarkable stability of <b>field</b> <b>tree</b> cover since 1968.

40|$|UK {{legislation}} aims {{to conserve}} and enhance biological diversity within the UK and so accurate measurements of forest biodiversity {{are important to}} assess efficacy of management activities in this context. Forest structural diversity metrics {{can be used as}} indicators of biodiversity and airborne LiDAR data provide a means of producing these metrics. Forest structure metrics derived from LiDAR can be significantly affected by the canopy conditions the datasets are collected under. Existing studies have combined and compared leaf-on and leaf-off LiDAR datasets in existing analyses, however the majority of these utilise field sites where climate, species and terrain are very different to those found in the UK. Additionally, studies comparing leaf-on and leaf-off LiDAR over forested areas assess the changes in pulse penetration through the canopy and how this effects forest structure metrics and not the effect on modelled forest structure diversity. The novel aim of this research is to assess and compare the accuracy of forest structural diversity modelled from two LiDAR surveys collected under leaf-on and leaf-off conditions, and do so in a UK forest environment. A robust methodology for correcting the absolute and relative accuracy between datasets was adopted and comparative analysis of ground detection and return height metrics (maximum, mean and percentiles of return height) and return height diversity (L-CV, CV, kurtosis, standard deviation, skewness and variance) was undertaken. Regression models describing the <b>field</b> <b>tree</b> size diversity measurements were constructed using diversity metrics from each LiDAR dataset in isolation and, where appropriate, a mixture of the two.

40|$|Aim {{of study}} : The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to test the validity of the DBH and total height allometric models fitted to the crown polygon data obtained by the application of a crown delineation and individualisation algorithm which uses the geometrical relationships between the points in the original LiDAR point clouds in the Pinus sylvestris L. stands. Area of study : The study area is located in the province of Álava in the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country. Material and Methods : The crowns are delineated using data from airborne LiDAR point clouds obtained in the 2008 overflight of the Basque Autonomous Community. The DBH and total height data for field trees are obtained from the plots in the 4 th National forest inventory. Main Results : For the adjusted total height and DBH models coefficients of determination of 0. 87 and 0. 74 respectively were obtained. The root mean squared errors were 10. 67 % and 18. 97 % respectively. The distributions of obtained DBH and total height fitted values and the distributions of the DBH and total height of the field trees are very similar except for the DBH below 15 cm. Research highlights : For stands of Pinus sylvestris L. in Álava, the geometrical relationships between the points that correspond to laser signal echoes obtained with airborne LiDAR sensors can be used directly to delineate approximations of the horizontal projections of the crowns of the trees. Although the procedure set out here was developed for stands of P. sylvestris L. in Álava, it can be applied to other conifers in regular stands by adjusting the working parameters of the function which delineates the crowns on the basis of the point cloud.

Four rainwater harvesting micro-catchments (L-, Saucer, Furrow and control(Pit) were tested on four tree species viz Acacia senegal, Acacia tortillis, Ziziphus spina-cristi and Grewia tenax in three replicate sites(Mussea, Tono and Rumalya) at South Darfur State. The results showed significant differences (p≤ 0. 01) in soil moisture reserves under the different water harvesting techniques for all tree growth stages and measurement periods. All treatments were significantly more effective than pit water harvesting technique (control treatment). L-micro-catchment consistently retained more runoff water and produced the highest moisture content than other techniques in both seasons followed by saucer micro-catchment then furrows at the initial and development stages. Saucer -micro-catchment ranked second to L - micro-catchment in moisture conservation. Saucer-micro-catchment gave more moisture at soil upper layers (0 - 30 cm) immediately above the bunds which was reflected in good plant performance. On the other hand L -micro-catchment stored more water in the medium and lower layers of the soil (30 - 60 cm). Moreover the trees of L-water harvesting treatment were significantly taller (73 cm, 63 cm, 58 cm and 56 cm) - Acacia tortilis, Acacia senegal, Ziziphus spina-cristi and Grewia tenax, respectively. L-water harvesting method gave the highest shoot length than other water harvesting treatments.
