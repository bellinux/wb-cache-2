He also worked with Andy Samberg in the movie and while shooting, Ice collaborated both with Samberg and Sandler musically. In August, Ice {{performed}} at the 2011 Gathering of the Juggalos, where it was officially announced that he had signed with Psychopathic Records. His sixth studio album, WTF, was released on August 19 through Radium Records. While the record featured an array of different styles, like other recent Vanilla Ice albums, it also featured Ice's return to Electronica, with songs like [...] "Turn It Up", [...] "Rock Star Party", [...] "Nightmare Disco" [...] and [...] "Cadillac Ninjas". On the new record and its numerous musical genres, Ice was quoted saying [...] "It's like techno hip-hop. European. I live a lot in Europe, and when I'm over there I get way into the techno stuff and <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> new music. So I thought I'd make a record of it. I did the thing and {{it was a lot of}} fun".|$|E
500|$|The twins' mother Rina {{said that}} when they were two years old, they would take pot lids out of the {{cupboards}} and run around the kitchen, going [...] "Vroom, vroom," [...] like they were driving cars– this before they had seen a car. In 1945, {{at the age of}} five, he and Aldo were racing their hand-crafted wooden cars through the steep streets of their hometown. Later, the brothers were hired by a garage to park cars, Andretti described the experience in his book What's It Like Out There: [...] "The first time I fired up a car, felt the engine shudder and the wheel come to life in my hands, I was hooked. It was a feeling I can't describe. I still get it every time <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> a race car." [...] Andretti's first racing experience was in a new youth racing league called Formula Junior [...] in Ancona, Italy when he was thirteen years old. However, the [...] Formula Junior story is likely apocryphal. In an interview during an , Mr. Andretti recounts the story of his early days of Dirt Track racing in Pennsylvania with his brother, Aldo, and implies that he and his brother made up the story of racing in the Formula Junior league because they looked the part after having purchased racing suits from Italy.|$|E
2500|$|Ullman {{contends that}} her impersonations are played with great admiration and affection. [...] "I hope {{they take it}} in the right spirit!" [...] One person {{impersonated}} who's reacted positively to her portrayal as a kleptomaniac Dame who wreaks havoc on an unsuspecting public is actress Judi Dench. Dench's daughter, Finty Williams, posted a clip of Ullman playing her mother on Facebook with the caption, [...] "brilliant, just brilliant." [...] Critics also praised the impersonation, with one writer saying: [...] "Her impersonation of Dench is so spot on that, {{for a second or}} two, you can't be sure she is not the real deal. Her performance easily transcends the make-up thanks to her mastery of posture, gesture and facial control as well as pitch- perfect vocals." [...] While filming on location, on-lookers asked if they were filming a James Bond film after catching Ullman in character. At the 36th London Critics' Circle Film Awards, Judi Dench introduced herself as [...] "Tracey Ullman." [...] In April 2017, while speaking to BBC Radio 4's Front Row, Dench commented on Ullman's portrayal, saying that she doted on it, and dubbed Ullman as brilliant. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> trouble now if I go into a shop with a bag over my arm [...] A man came up to me in M the other day and said to me, 'I've got my eye on you'." ...|$|E

5000|$|Although openly gay, Holter {{has stated}} that he likes writing work beyond his own {{personal}} experience: [...] "I am black and I am gay, but the minute that I only write work that is about being that—I don’t think that’s interesting. <b>I</b> like <b>getting</b> <b>into</b> {{the head of a}} white woman in her 30s. <b>I</b> like <b>getting</b> <b>into</b> the head of an Asian dude in his 20s." ...|$|R
