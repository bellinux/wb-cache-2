40|$|Moraxella osloensis, a gram-negative bacterium, is {{associated}} with Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita, a nematode parasite of slugs. This bacterium-feeding nematode has potential for the biological control of slugs, especially the <b>grey</b> <b>garden</b> <b>slug,</b> Deroceras reticulatum. Infective juveniles of P. hermaphrodita invade the shell cavity of the slug, develop into self-fertilizing hermaphrodites, and produce progeny, resulting in host death. However, {{the role of the}} associated bacterium in the pathogenicity of the nematode to the slug is unknown. We discovered that M. osloensis alone is pathogenic to D. reticulatum after injection into the shell cavity or hemocoel of the slug. The bacteria from 60 -h cultures were more pathogenic than the bacteria from 40 -h cultures, as indicated by the higher and more rapid mortality of the slugs injected with the former. Coinjection of penicillin and streptomycin with the 60 -h bacterial culture reduced its pathogenicity to the slug. Further work suggested that the reduction and loss of pathogenicity of the aged infective juveniles of P. hermaphrodita to D. reticulatum result from the loss of M. osloensis from the aged nematodes. Also, axenic J 1 /J 2 nematodes were nonpathogenic after injection into the shell cavity. Therefore, we conclude that the bacterium is the sole killing agent of D. reticulatum in the nematode-bacterium complex and that P. hermaphrodita acts only as a vector to transport the bacterium into the shell cavity of the slug. The identification of the toxic metabolites produced by M. osloensis is being pursued...|$|E
40|$|Laboratory-reared <b>grey</b> <b>garden</b> <b>slugs,</b> Deroceras reticu-latum, {{were exposed}} to soil and food treated with solu-tions of three metal salts (CdC 12, ZnCl,, PbClJ) in three {{environmentally}} relevant concentrations, each for 21 days. Metal concentrations were determined in the soil,,food and slugs by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (A AS). Zinc was localized ultrastructurally in the hepato-pancreatic cells by means of energy-filtering transmission electron microscopy (EFTEM). Zinc, and also high amounts of copper, could be detected by electron spectroscopical imaging (ESI) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) in spherites of the basophilic cells. Ultrastructural responses to metal impact were investi-gated in two cell types of the hepatopancreas (digestive and basophilic cells) and the cellular responses {{were found to be}} dose- and metal-dependent. In order to evalu-ate the toxicity of the respective metal concentrations to the slugs, the ultrastructural reactions were semi-quanti-jied and summarized as complex reaction patterns of numerous organelles. This novel approach provides a basis,for the use of data from standardized tests as a back-ground for risk assessment studies in theJield. Copyrigh...|$|R

40|$|Moraxella osloensis is a gram-negative {{bacterium}} associated with Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita, a slug-parasitic nematode that has prospects for biological control of mollusk pests, especially the <b>grey</b> <b>garden</b> <b>slug,</b> Deroceras reticulatum. This bacterium-feeding nematode {{acts as a}} vector that transports M. osloensis into the shell cavity of the slug, and the bacterium is the killing agent in the nematode-bacterium complex. We discovered that M. osloensis produces an endotoxin(s), which is tolerant to heat and protease treatments and kills the slug after injection into the shell cavity. Washed or broken cells treated with penicillin and streptomycin from 3 -day M. osloensis cultures were more pathogenic than similar cells from 2 -day M. osloensis cultures. However, heat and protease treatments and 2 days of storage at 22 °C increased the endotoxin activity of the young broken cells but not the endotoxin activity of the young washed cells treated with the antibiotics. This suggests {{that there may be}} a proteinaceous substance(s) that is structurally associated with the endotoxin(s) and masks its toxicity in the young bacterial cells. Moreover, 2 days of storage of the young washed bacterial cells at 22 °C enhanced their endotoxin activity if they were not treated with the antibiotics. Furthermore, purified lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from the 3 -day M. osloensis cultures was toxic to slugs, with an estimated 50 % lethal dose of 48 μg per slug, thus demonstrating that the LPS of M. osloensis is an endotoxin that is active against D. reticulatum. This appears to be the first report of a biological toxin that is active against mollusks...|$|E
