5|$|Haarsma takes part {{in school}} visits {{to promote his}} book and {{encourage}} imagination and reading in the school children. His presentation lasts fifty minutes, and discussions center around space travel, exploration, The Rings of Orbis universe, and other interactive topics, thus allowing <b>for</b> <b>questions</b> from {{the students at the}} conclusion. To help illustrate the scientific topics, NASA supplied Haarsma with space related information to present.|$|E
5|$|The {{timelines}} displayed here cover {{events from}} the beginning of the 11th millennium to the furthest reaches of future time. A number of alternate future events are listed to account <b>for</b> <b>questions</b> still unresolved, such as whether humans will become extinct, whether protons decay, or whether or not the earth survives when the sun expands to the red giant.|$|E
5|$|There was a {{high demand}} for tickets, which RTÉ {{described}} as phenomenal. 4,000 applications were received for a capacity of 120 seats (originally 60 <b>for</b> <b>Questions</b> and Answers, which was subsequently doubled). A public invitation for comments and ideas on topics was issued by the makers of the show.|$|E
50|$|There was {{overwhelming}} support <b>for</b> both <b>questions.</b> Support was over 80% of yes votes <b>for</b> both <b>questions.</b> However, {{more than nine}} percent of ballots <b>for</b> <b>question</b> A were rejected, and more than eleven percent were rejected <b>for</b> <b>question</b> B. Turnout was slightly less than that in the general election.|$|R

5|$|Because he {{was delayed}} {{in getting the}} website online, Munroe {{had a lot of}} time {{thinking}} about the design of the blog. He eventually chose to display his entries as individual pages rather than using an infinite scrolling page, as he considers the latter more difficult to digest. Munroe usually chooses questions he already knows something interesting about, or after reading a scientific paper, he keeps an eye out <b>for</b> <b>questions</b> in which he can bring it up. Munroe has said that the volume of questions has been high enough that it is impossible to read all of them. Answering a question and writing a post takes him about a day of solid work.|$|E
5|$|After the presentation, {{the session}} was opened <b>for</b> <b>questions.</b> Nuzman {{clarified}} doubts by Arne Ljungqvist about doping legislation; Osório and Cabral answered two questions by Prince Albert of Monaco about accommodation and the project's legacy, respectively; and the President of Brazil himself {{responded to a}} question by Austin Sealy about organization risks. Following the presentations by the four Candidate cities, Nawal El Moutawakel presented {{the report of the}} Evaluation Commission to the Session. From a total of 106 eligible IOC members, 95 were available to vote in the first round. Members from the four bidding countries were not allowed to vote until their city was eliminated. Alpha Ibrahim Diallo, Kun Hee Lee, Saku Koivu and the IOC president were eligible members who did not vote. Chicago fell in the first round with 18 votes, while Tokyo received 22, Rio 26, and Madrid 28. In the second round, Tokyo was eliminated with 20 votes, while Madrid received 29 and Rio 46. Rio de Janeiro was elected in the final round with 66 votes over 32 for Madrid. The winning city was revealed by Jacques Rogge at 6:30 (CEST) during an announcement ceremony hosted by Lillian Gjerulf Kretz and Jonathan Edwards. Nearly 100,000 people celebrated the victory on Copacabana beach while watching the live broadcast. Following the announcement, Richard Carrión, Rogge, Nuzman and Paes signed the Host City Contract and officialized Rio de Janeiro as the host of the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games.|$|E
5|$|The British government's {{refusal to}} grant {{independence}} to Southern Rhodesia under the 1961 constitution was largely {{the result of}} the geopolitical and moral shifts associated with the Wind of Change, coupled with the UK's wish to avoid opprobrium and loss of prestige in the United Nations (UN) and the Commonwealth. The issue gained international attention in Africa and worldwide as a flashpoint <b>for</b> <b>questions</b> of decolonisation and racism. By the early 1960s, general consensus in the post-colonial UN—particularly the General Assembly, where the communist bloc and the Afro-Asian lobby were collectively very strong—roundly denounced all forms of colonialism, and supported communist-backed black nationalist insurgencies across southern Africa, regarding them as racial liberation movements. Amid the Cold War, Britain opposed the spread of Soviet and Chinese influence into Africa, but knew it would become an international pariah if it publicly expressed reservations or backed down on NIBMAR in the Southern Rhodesia question. Once the topic of Southern Rhodesia came to the fore in the UN and other bodies, particularly the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), even maintaining the status quo became regarded as unacceptable internationally, causing the UK government a great deal of embarrassment.|$|E
40|$|QuestionCube is a {{framework}} <b>for</b> <b>Question</b> Answering (QA) that combines several techniques to retrieve passages containing the exact answers <b>for</b> natural language <b>questions.</b> It exploits: (a) Natural Language Processing algorithms <b>for</b> <b>question</b> and candidate answers analysis both in English and Italian; (b) Information Retrieval probabilistic models for candidate answers retrieval and (c) Machine Learning methods <b>for</b> <b>question</b> classification.

50|$|There {{are five}} {{individual}} categories, and they are: Mystery, Geometry, Number Theory, Arithmetic, and Algebra. Each individual round contains three questions, varying in content but focusing on topics {{published by the}} test writer. Questions in individual rounds are worth 2 points each. (Before this was the case, questions would be worth the question number, i.e., one point <b>for</b> <b>question</b> one, two points <b>for</b> <b>question</b> two and three points <b>for</b> <b>question</b> three.) Students are given 10 minutes to complete the round, along with a 1-minute warning.|$|R

Methods are shown <b>for</b> decomposing <b>questions</b> into boolean combinations of <b>question</b> patterns and <b>for</b> using the concept network and logical forms together with WordNet <b>for</b> <b>question</b> answering. SEMEX’s encouraging performance against the TREC 2005 question answering test set is discussed...|$|R
25|$|In 2008, the U.S. version {{changed its}} format so that contestants were {{required}} to answer questions within a set time limit. The time limits were 15 seconds <b>for</b> <b>questions</b> 1–5, 30 seconds <b>for</b> <b>questions</b> 6-10, and 45 seconds <b>for</b> <b>questions</b> 11-14. After each of the 14 questions were answered correctly, the remaining time after giving an answer was banked for the million-dollar question. The clock for each question began counting down immediately after all of the question was revealed, and was temporarily paused when a lifeline was used. Contestants who exceeded the time limit were forced to walk away with any prize money they had won up to that point. The clock was later adopted by other international versions; for example, the British version adopted it on 3 August 2010, and the Indian version adopted it on 11 October the same year.|$|E
25|$|In 1984 and 1989, The Observer printed {{articles}} by Raphael which {{suggested that the}} lobbyist Ian Greer had been paying members of parliament to table parliamentary questions, {{an early stage of}} the Cash <b>for</b> <b>Questions</b> scandal.|$|E
25|$|In the {{previously}} safe seat of Tatton, where incumbent Conservative MP Neil Hamilton was facing charges of having taken cash <b>for</b> <b>questions,</b> the Labour and Liberal Democrat Parties {{decided not to}} field candidates in order that an independent candidate, Martin Bell, {{would have a better}} chance of winning the seat, which he did with a comfortable margin.|$|E

25|$|As Schultz and Schultz (2005) point out, {{significant}} gender differences in locus of control have not been found for adults in the U.S. population. However, these authors also note {{that there may be}} specific sex-based differences for specific categories of items to assess locus of control; for example, they cite evidence that men may have a greater internal locus <b>for</b> <b>questions</b> related to academic achievement.|$|E
25|$|Every sitting day {{a period}} of time is set aside <b>for</b> <b>questions</b> to be asked of ministers and select {{committee}} chairs. Questions to a minister must related to their official ministerial activities, not to his or her activities as a party leader or as a private Member of Parliament. In addition to questions asked orally during Question Time, Members of Parliament may also make inquiries in writing.|$|E
25|$|Tom Foreman, a {{broadcast}} journalist from CNN, {{was chosen to}} moderate the debate. Each man was allowed a five-minute opening statement, followed by a thirty-minute presentation of the evidence for his side; each man was then given five minutes to rebut the other's arguments, and then the floor was opened <b>for</b> <b>questions</b> that the audience had previously submitted on cards. Ham won the coin toss to determine which man delivered his opening statement first.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the second}} round, contestants {{have to answer}} the {{previous}} <b>question.</b> <b>For</b> example, when they were asked question 3, they {{would have given the}} correct answer <b>for</b> <b>question</b> 2. However, contestants have to say [...] "don't know" [...] or remain silent <b>for</b> <b>question</b> 1 to gain the point. There are ten questions to answer. Similarly to round 1, the contestant(s) who got the most number of questions correctly can remove one item of their list.|$|R
25|$|On the ACT, each {{question}} correctly answered is worth one raw point. There is no penalty for marking incorrect answers on the multiple-choice {{part of the}} test. Therefore, a student can answer all questions without suffering a decrease in their score <b>for</b> <b>questions</b> they answer incorrectly. This is parallel to several AP Tests eliminating the penalties for incorrect answers. To improve the result, students can retake the test: 55% of students who retake the ACT improve their scores, 22% score the same, and 23% see their scores decrease.|$|E
25|$|Social {{problems}} on annexed territory were {{discussed in the}} cabinet meeting on December 22, 1939. The interior minister, Ferenc Keresztes-Fischer, who was responsible <b>for</b> <b>questions</b> of common goods, health service and social policy, proposed a solution based on unification. The Minister for Upper Country, Andor Jaross, disagreed with this solution and proposed providing the Czechoslovak welfare system {{for those in the}} annexed areas for a transitional period, but had no objections to decreasing it to the Hungarian level. The cabinet finally agreed on a compromise. The elimination of Czechoslovak laws from annexed territory was understood as a duty, but {{it had to be done}} step by step. The first step was to decrease the value of a retirement pension from its Czechoslovak value (150 pengő) to its Hungarian value (60 pengő) through a transition value of 120 pengő. Sickness insurance for workers in agriculture was preserved in the form of Czechoslovak regulation for the moment, but it was changed from compulsory to voluntary. In Slovakia, the Czechoslovak system of welfare was preserved after the break-up of Czechoslovakia.|$|E
25|$|Wallace-Johnson did not {{immediately}} involve himself in Gold Coast politics. He surveyed the political atmosphere and reestablished connections he had made in his trips to Europe. Most of his activities involved political agitation, as he began working with the Gold Coast Drivers' Union, and started contributing articles to local newspapers like the Gold Coast Spectator, the Vox Populi and the Gold Coast Provincial Pioneer. He also helped workers who suffered injustice by preparing legal documentation for cases. Overall, he tried to raise political expectations regarding peoples' rights {{and their ability to}} influence political decision-making. Through contacts in London, he arranged <b>for</b> <b>questions</b> to be asked by sympathetic left wing Labour Party members in the British Parliament about working conditions and rights in the colonies. Wallace-Johnson also established a new form of mass demonstrations, in which members of the traditional elite no longer dominated African politics. In Wallace-Johnson's reformation of mass meetings, ordinary citizens could vocalise their political opinions. These people took full advantage of the new system; they frequently lambasted colonial authorities and the political establishment, in general. The idea won Wallace-Johnson widespread acclaim and adulation.|$|E

3000|$|Results of {{all three}} {{measures}} of association indicated a very weak positive correlation between RTE and the responses to either survey questions listed in the Methods section. <b>For</b> <b>Question</b> 1, the estimated Pearson correlation, Spearman's rho, and Goodman and Kruskal's gamma were equal to 0.082, 0.076, and 0.161, respectively. <b>For</b> <b>Question</b> 2, the corresponding results were 0.006, 0.026, and 0.061. For a strong positive correlation to be observed <b>for</b> either <b>question</b> given that the RTE values were so skewed to the right, the marginal distribution of the responses should also have a clear decreasing trend from 4 (very important/tried much harder) to 1 (not very important/tried not as hard), possibly with a distinct proportion of students choosing 4. However, {{it is not the}} case in the MCBS: <b>For</b> <b>Question</b> 1, the percentages were 27.9 % for [...] "very important", 38.4 % for [...] "important", 26.8 % for [...] "somewhat important", and 6.3 % for [...] "not very important". <b>For</b> <b>Question</b> 2, the percentages were 6.4 % for [...] "tried much harder", 16.8 % for [...] "tried harder", 57.7 % for [...] "tried about as hard", and 18.6 % for [...] "tried not as hard".|$|R
500|$|From 2008 to 2010, {{time limits}} {{were used for}} each question. Contestants were given up to 15 seconds each <b>for</b> <b>questions</b> one through five, 30 seconds each <b>for</b> <b>questions</b> six through ten, and 45 seconds each <b>for</b> <b>questions</b> eleven through fourteen. Unused time was banked, and if the {{contestant}} reached question fifteen, {{he or she was}} given 45 seconds plus the amount of time previously banked. If the clock reached zero before a contestant could provide a final answer, the contestant was forced to walk away with the winnings they had at that point. During the clock format era, a [...] "Millionaire Menu" [...] was introduced, in which categories are revealed for each question {{at the beginning of the}} game, and are made visible to the contestant for their future reference. Some prize levels also changed at the start of season eight. Most of the episodes in season eight (from the [...] "Million Dollar Tournament of Ten" [...] onward) featured special [...] "Celebrity Questions" [...] that were mid-level in monetary value, and were provided by notable individuals whose identities were not revealed until the contestant reached their special questions.|$|E
