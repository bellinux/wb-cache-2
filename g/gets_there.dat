Although he viewed that it [...] "lacks that album's series of highpoints", Landau commented that [...] "it ebbs and flows, occasionally threatening to spend itself on an insufficiency of ideas, but always retrieved, just in time, by Gaye's performance.

In Creem magazine, Robert Christgau called the record [...] "post-Al Green What's Going On, which means it's about fucking rather than the human condition, thank the wholly holey".|$|E
