Chief Wiggum suggests sending Bart to military school to correct his behavior. When the family visit the school, Lisa is impressed by the challenging curriculum and decides to attend with Bart.|$|E
5|$|Education in Malaysia {{falls under}} the remit of two federal ministries; the Malaysian Ministry of Education is {{responsible}} for primary and secondary education, while the Ministry of Higher Education has oversight over public universities, polytechnic and community colleges. Early childhood <b>education</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> directly controlled by the Ministry of Education as it does with primary and secondary education. However, the ministry does oversee the licensing of private kindergartens, the main form of early childhood education, {{in accordance with the}} National Pre-School Quality Standard, which was launched in 2013.|$|E
5|$|The Jordanian {{educational}} system {{consists of a}} two-year cycle of pre-school education, 10 years of compulsory basic education, and two years of secondary academic or vocational education, after which the students sit for the Tawjihi exams. 79% of children go through primary education, while secondary school enrollment has increased from 63% to 97% of high school aged students in Jordan. Between 79% and 85% {{of high school students}} in Jordan move on to higher education. According to the CIA World Factbook, the literacy rate in 2015 was 95.4%. UNESCO ranked Jordan's education system 18th out of 94 nations for providing gender equality in education. <b>Education</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> free in Jordan.|$|E

25|$|In a {{study of}} normal aging, {{education}} {{was found to be}} related to levels of cognitive functioning but unrelated to rates of cognitive change, suggesting that cognitive reserve reflects the persistence of earlier differences in cognitive functioning rather than differential rates of age-associated cognitive declines.

25|$|Another {{facet of}} this {{controversy}} is {{the effectiveness of}} the programs dependent upon resources that are pushed more toward students who are struggling. Gifted <b>Education</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> mandated in many states, making it elective for districts to earmark money for. Many lower-achieving districts and schools must make crisis decisions on programs that are not high priorities. As a result, gifted students at these schools are not served, or not served effectively.|$|E

25|$|Sexual <b>{{education}}</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> always {{taught the}} same in every country. For example, in France sex education {{has been part of}} school curricula since 1973. Schools are expected to provide 30 to 40 hours of sex education, and pass out condoms to students in grades eight and nine. In January, 2000, the French government launched an information campaign on contraception with TV and radio spots and the distribution of five million leaflets on contraception to high school students.|$|E
25|$|There is no fixed {{rules on}} {{when a child}} needs to start {{preschool}} education but majority would start when the child turns 3 years old. Schooling can begin earlier, from 3–6, in kindergarten. Preschool education usually lasts for 2 years, before they proceed to primary school at age 7. There is no formal preschool curriculum except a formal mandatory training and certification for principals and teachers before they may operate a preschool. The training covers lessons on child psychology, teaching methodologies, and other related curricula on childcare and development. Preschool <b>education</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> compulsory.|$|E

25|$|The BCTF {{began an}} illegal strike on October 7, 2005. It {{maintained}} that {{breaking the law}} for a just cause (having its collective bargaining rights limited and a contract imposed) was acceptable. Critics of the BCTF claimed that the illegal job action set a bad example for the children they teach. The job action was illegal because teaching in British Columbia was considered an essential service and teachers {{were not allowed to}} strike. The BCTF, however, maintained that under the provisions of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the non-binding decisions of the United Nations International Labour Organization, <b>education</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> an essential service and it had the right to political protest.|$|E
25|$|It {{was only}} in the 1960s that roads were built in Bhutan and Thimphu when the Third King of Bhutan took the {{initiative}} after receiving education in it. Prior to that, education was limited to monastic teachings in monasteries, except for a few privileged people who went to Darjeeling to receive western-type education. Dzongkha is compulsory in all schools. Schools are co-educational and <b>education</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> compulsory but school education is virtually free. Now, education has spread to all parts of the country. Thimphu has several educational institutions from schooling level to the college level in several disciplines. There are more private schools in Thimphu than in any other place in Bhutan, which are all {{under the control of the}} Department of Education. The National Training Authority administers three technical institutes.|$|E
25|$|In the Netherlands, {{students}} used to receive {{four years of}} preclinical training, followed by two years of clinical training (co-assistentschappen, or co-schappen for short) in hospitals. However, {{for a number of}} medical schools this has recently changed to three years of preclinical training, followed by three years of clinical training. At least one medical faculty, that of the Utrecht University, clinical training already begins in the third year of medical school. After 6 years, students graduate as basisartsen (comparable to Doctors of Medicine). As a result of the Bologna process, medical students in the Netherlands now receive a bachelor's degree after three years in medical school and a master's degree upon graduation. Prospective students can apply for medical education directly after finishing the highest level of secondary school, vwo; previous undergraduate <b>education</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a precondition for admittance.|$|E

Education crisis in Egypt is very complicated, public <b>education</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> capable of providing quality education and is hardly providing any education with the shortage in facilities, lack of trained educators and inflation in classes. Private (including International) is still incapable of reform for the lack of interest, shortage in trained educators, defective curricula, commercialization of education and finally a customized accreditation system that involves the irrevocable licensure of International schools based on candidacy for accreditation while candidacy for accreditation is originally based on the initial efficiency of the school in providing the educational services including its status as a legal education provider that it doesn't get to get unless it is a candidate school, which is setting the cart before the horse.|$|E
25|$|Over the years, {{government}} {{budget cuts}} {{have taken their}} toll. Israel was amongst the top-ranked nations in international rankings for science and mathematics performance in the 1960s, but dropped to 33 out of 41 nations in the 2002 survey. Wages for Israeli teachers are low compared to other industrialized countries, especially due to {{the small amount of}} frontal teaching hours with respect to other developed countries (the salary per hour {{is similar to that of}} the OECD standards), according to a survey of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The government-appointed Dovrat Commission, led by Shlomo Dovrat, concluded in 2004, that the key to improving Israeli <b>education</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> more money but better-quality teaching. The recommendations included a reform giving school principals the right to fire teachers of poor quality, and reward better ones with higher pay. These moves have been blocked by Israel's teachers' unions, which have paralyzed schools with a series of long strikes, mostly blocking the proposed reforms.|$|E
25|$|Among some {{immigrant}} groups, {{especially those}} who come from origin countries in which <b>education</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> free or widely available, first-generation immigrants may have had little formal schooling. Immigrant parents tend to have lower levels of formal schooling than U.S.-born parents. Low levels of education among parents can {{have a negative impact}} on their children's ability to succeed in school. On the other hand, the effort that these immigrant parents put into trying to help their children do well in school can have a significant impact on the academic achievement of students. Parents thus have some measure of control over the likelihood that their children will succeed in school. If children perceive their parents as supportive, they will be more likely to do well in their academic endeavors, regardless of the practical help their parents are actually able to provide. If parents are not invested in their children's success in school—or if they create barriers to children's education by asking children to work rather than attend school—this lack of emotional support can {{have a negative impact on}} children's likelihood of educational success.|$|E
