40|$|AbstractIn PHWR {{community}} 17 mm wide curved compact tension (CCT) specimen is {{most commonly}} used for fracture toughness testing in axial direction of pressure tube. This specimen geometry is different from Conventional CT specimen (ASTM E 1820 – 11) in two aspects. First being the curvature of the CCT specimen and second {{is that it does}} not meet the alternate thickness criteria of 2 ≤W/B≤ 4 for B = 3. 6 mm. Despite these differences, the eta and gamma factors used for the fracture toughness measurement of Conventional CT specimen according to ASTM E 1820 – 11 are also applied for CCT specimen. In this work, 17 mm wide blunt notched Conventional CT specimens of Zr- 2. 5 Nb pressure tube with different a/W ratios between 0. 3 and 0. 7 were loaded up to maximum load. The load separabilty was checked and <b>eta</b> <b>factor</b> was calculated using load separation method. The investigation of separation parameter (S) for reference cracks (ai/W) between 0. 45 and 0. 7 showed that (a) load was separable over whole range of plastic displacement for the CT specimens with ai/W between 0. 45 and 0. 7, except for small initial inseparable region, and (b) load was not separable over whole range of plastic displacement for the CT specimens with ai/W of 0. 35 and 0. 40. The small inseparable region in the CT specimens with ai/W between 0. 45 and 0. 7 is reported in literature to be due to initial blunting of the CT specimen. The <b>eta</b> <b>factor,</b> calculated using load separation method proposed by Sharobeam and Landes, was found to have a constant value of 2. 08 for ai/W in range of 0. 45 and 0. 70. The <b>eta</b> <b>factor</b> was found to be lower than that reported by Sharobeam and Landes as well as in ASTM 1820 – 11. Since load was not separable for CT specimens with a/W of 0. 35 and 0. 4, <b>eta</b> <b>factor</b> derived for this CT geometry cannot be used for a/W below 0. 45...|$|E

Peat, a low cost sorbent, has shown a high capacity for the sorption of single component metal ions attributed to extensive carboxylic acids within its structure. Copper and nickel ions were selected as typical metals in the effluents of electroplating industries. The effects of competitive sorption in batch systems were studied at various metal ion concentrations. In this study the Butler and Ockrent model was modified using a coefficient, eta. Two models were developed based on the interaction coefficient eta. The first model incorporates a constant fixed <b>eta</b> <b>factor</b> for each metal ion into the Butler-Ockrent equation. The second model incorporates a variable <b>eta</b> <b>factor</b> into the Butler-Ockrent equation; this interaction factor varies as a function of sorbent surface coverage.

40|$|This work {{examines}} {{the effect of}} weld strength mismatch on fracture toughness measurements defined by J and CTOD fracture parameters using single edge notch bend (SE(B)) specimens. A central objective {{of the present study}} is to enlarge on previous developments of J and CTOD estimation procedures for welded bend specimens based upon plastic <b>eta</b> <b>factors</b> (<b>eta)</b> and plastic rotational factors (r (p)). Very detailed non-linear finite element analyses for plane-strain models of standard SE(B) fracture specimens with a notch located at the center of square groove welds and in the heat affected zone provide the evolution of load with increased crack mouth opening displacement required for the estimation procedure. One key result emerging from the analyses is that levels of weld strength mismatch within the range +/- 20 % mismatch do not affect significantly J and CTOD estimation expressions applicable to homogeneous materials, particularly for deeply cracked fracture specimens with relatively large weld grooves. The present study provides additional understanding on the effect of weld strength mismatch on J and CTOD toughness measurements while, at the same time, adding a fairly extensive body of results to determine parameters J and CTOD for different materials using bend specimens with varying geometries and mismatch levels.

40|$|Impact loaded, pre-cracked Charpy {{specimens}} often play {{a crucial}} role in irradiation surveillance programs for nuclear power plants. However, the small specimen size (B = W = 10 mm) limits the maximum value of cleavage fracture toughness (Jc) that can be measured under elastic-plastic conditions without loss of crack tip constraint. In this investigation, plane-strain impact analyses provide detailed resolution of crack-tip fields for impact loaded specimens. Crack-tip stress fields are characterized in terms of J-Q trajectories and the Toughness Scaling Model which is applicable for a cleavage fracture mechanism. Results of the analyses suggest deformation limits at fracture in the form of b >MJc/ao, where M approaches 25 - 30 for a strongly rate sensitive material at impact velocities of 3 - 6 m/ s. Based on direct comparison of the static and dynamic J-values computed using a domain-integral formulation, a new proposal emerges for the transition time, the time after impact at which inertial effects diminish sufficiently for simple evaluation of J using the plastic <b>eta</b> <b>factor</b> approach.

40|$|AbstractA test {{standard}} for single edge notched tension (SENT) fracture toughness testing was issued in 2014 by British Standards as BS 8571 : 2014. Prior to BS 8571, most guidance on SENT test methodology {{was taken from}} DNV RP F 108 : 2006 for installation of girth welds under high strain, which is still commonly cited by pipeline design and fabrication standards such as DNV OS F 101 : 2013 for subsea pipelines. The intention of BS 8571 was to maintain some continuity with DNV RP F 108 to allow users time to adopt the new Standard, and therefore BS 8571 included the DNV specimen design and J formulae, but also offered a different J approach based on work by Shen & colleagues (2009) from CanmetMaterials, for specimen designs currently beyond those permitted in DNV RP F 108 but included in BS 8571. However, recent independent research by Zhu & McGaughy (2015) has identified an error in the K solutions adopted from DNV RP F 108 into BS 8571, and therefore, {{there is a need}} to review the various equations to calculate J for SENT specimens to ensure that the optimum approach is employed in BS 8571, both in terms of accuracy and ease of application. A review of different published solutions for the elastic K solutions, and plastic <b>eta</b> <b>factor</b> solutions, which comprise parts of the calculation of J has been carried out, to compare the range of possible solutions in relation to those currently used in BS 8571 : 2014. Furthermore numerical modelling of crack tearing resistance curves was undertaken to compare the two different methods currently given in BS 8571 to determine which would provide the best single approach appropriate for all SENT specimens tested to BS 8571. The analyses determined that the ‘Canmet’ solutions should be used for a single equation for J to cover specimens with W/B ratios from 0. 5 to 2 in future versions of BS 8571. This change will improve the accuracy of the determination of J from SENT specimens, with a simpler method, but little difference to the values of J for typical specimens which have been tested using BS 8571 to date...|$|E

This study was carried out using a full-scale model of a portion of a shading device, in a semi-anechoic chamber, using traditional and sound absorbing louvres. The psychoacoustic effects produced by the shading system were evaluated through comparisons between averaged values of loudness, roughness and sharpness levels, as well as sound pressure levels as reference. Results highlighted that the sound absorbing shading device offers good attenuation in terms of loudness, roughness and sound pressure level, with a small reduction in sharpness. The traditional shading system studied does not efficiently reduce the analysed parameters, or even worsens the situation. Several analyses of variance were carried out, one for each situation studied. The sound source position and the louvres' tilt angle both produce statistically significant effects on almost all of the variations of the parameters studied.

In all cases, ratios of isotope rates and the pressure dependence of enrichments, the agreement is good. While the initial focus was on isotope effects in the formation of O 3, predictions are made for isotope effects on ratios of rate constants in other reactions such as O+CO [...] >CO 2, O+NO [...] >NO 2, and O+SO [...] >SO 2...|$|R
40|$|The novel {{method for}} synthesizing o-nitrophenyl octyl ether from the {{etherification}} of sodium o-nitrophenoxide and 1 -bromooctane was investigated via third-liquid phase-transfer catalysis (TLPTC). The {{volume of the}} third-liquid phase formed increases with {{increasing the amount of}} catalyst employed, and about 91. 2 % of tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBPB) was accumulated in the third-liquid phase by adding 0. 07 mol of NaOH, leading to a higher reactivity. The product yield greater than 98 % was obtained within 3 h of reaction using TBPB at 80 degrees C. The variations of the catalytic intermediate in the third-liquid phase during reaction were explored. The consumption rate of the catalytic intermediate increased with the increase of reaction rates. The enhancement <b>factor</b> (<b>eta)</b> of the catalytic intermediate in third-liquid phase can be correlated as a linear function of the product yield (Y) in the organic phase as eta = alpha(1) - alpha(2) Y. Based on the experimental observations, a kinetic model of pseudo-first-order was proposed to successfully describe the overall reaction with the apparent activation energy to be 23. 32 kcal/mol for 0. 003 mol of TBPB used. The interfacial phenomenon affected by catalytic intermediate and catalyst was also performed. The third-liquid phase-transfer catalysis is demonstrated as an effective method to synthesize specialty chemicals. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTo {{test the}} {{validity}} of replacing a composite fermion by an elementary fermion, we calculate the transition rate from a state made of one free electron and one trion to a similar electron-trion pair, through the time evolution of such a pair induced by Coulomb interaction between elementary fermions. It is convenient to describe trion as one electron interacting with one exciton. This allows us to use the tools we have developed in the new composite-exciton many-body theory. The trion-electron scattering contains a direct channel in which ``in'' and ``out'' trions are made with the same fermions, and an exchange channel in which the ``in'' free electron becomes one of the ``out'' trion components. As expected, momenta are conserved in these two channels. The direct scattering is found to read as the bare Coulomb potential between elementary particles multiplied by a form factor which depends on the ``in'' and ``out'' trion relative motion indices eta and <b>eta</b> `, this <b>factor</b> reducing to delta(eta eta `) in the zero momentum transfer limit. In this direct channel, the trion at large distance reacts as an elementary particle, its composite nature showing up at large momentum transfer. In contrast, {{the fact that the}} trion is not elementary does affect the exchange channel for all momentum transfers. We thus conclude that a 3 -component fermion behaves as an elementary fermion for direct processes in the small momentum transfer limit only. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{best selling}} {{literature}} on relationships {{is written in}} terms of gender differences. Information and advice from psychologists and counselors is directed to either females or males based on counseling clients and personal experience. In this study, I present evidence that a gender list of attitudes and needs without age considerations cannot provide accurate information. This study included a sample of 1020 volunteers from a randomized group of individuals attending jury duty in Pima County, Arizona. The participants answered a questionnaire consisting of 44 items developed from four authors' best selling books on information and advice on relationships. The participant responses were evaluated in terms of three factors: gender, attendance in counseling, and age. Phi coefficients were calculated for the gender and counseling <b>factors.</b> <b>Eta</b> coefficients were calculated for females and males across four age groups. Meaningful results were determined by Cohen's criteria of effect size. Item responses were compared with expectations from the literature. The results indicate gender and age are necessary to accurately determine relationship attitudes and needs. The factors of gender and age provided specific information for females and males across age groups unavailable with dichotomous gender designations. The counseling sample did not respond consistently {{when compared to the}} non-counseling sample on items relating to counseling subjects. A comparison of item responses to the literature suggests participants did not respond to items consistently with information and advice in current self-help literature...|$|R
40|$|We {{measure and}} {{quantify}} properties of galactic outflows and diffuse gas at z >= 1 in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. Our novel subresolution model, Multi-Phase Particle Integrator (MUPPI), implements supernova feedback using fully local gas properties, {{where the wind}} velocity and mass loading are not given as input. We find the following trends at z = 2 by analysing central galaxies having a stellar mass higher than 10 (9) M-circle dot. The outflow velocity and mass outflow rate ((M) over dot(out)) exhibit positive correlations with galaxy mass and with the star formation rate (SFR). However, most of the relations present a large scatter. The outflow mass loading <b>factor</b> (<b>eta)</b> is between 0. 2 and 10. The comparison effective model generates a constant outflow velocity, and a negative correlation of eta with halo mass. The number fraction of galaxies where outflow is detected decreases at lower redshifts, but remains more than 80 per cent over z = 1 - 5. The outflow velocity correlation with SFR becomes flatter at z = 1, and eta displays a negative correlation with halo mass in massive galaxies. Our study demonstrates that both the MUPPI and effective models produce significant outflows at similar to 1 / 10 of the virial radius; {{at the same time}} shows that the properties of outflows generated can be different from the input speed and mass loading in the effective model. Our MUPPI model, using local properties of gas in the subresolution recipe, is able to develop galactic outflows whose properties correlate with global galaxy properties, and consistent with observations...|$|R
40|$|The bulk of our {{knowledge}} about sizes and albedos of TNOs and Centaurs is derived from observations of their thermal-emission continuum combined with thermal modeling. Spitzer and Herschel provided and are providing an unsurpassed wealth of photometric data for this purpose. We here report {{the results of a}} coherent re-analysis of all photometric Spitzer-MIPS observations of TNOs and Centaurs, 402 observations (AORs) of a total of 106 objects. Most objects are observed at 24 and 70 micron. This dataset is a super-set of that described in previous MIPS TNO publications (e. g., Stansberry et al., 2008, 2012; Brucker et al., 2009). We use the latest knowledge about MIPS data reduction and flux calibration. Where possible, the sky background is subtracted from multiple observations of the same target, leading to substantial improvements in SNR. Particular attention is paid to a coherent treatment of faint and non-detections, largely ignored in previous work, using the latest ephemerides. We use the NEATM (Harris, 1998) to determine sizes and albedos from the MIPS data. Correlations between albedo, size, and other physical or dynamical properties are discussed. Where possible, we also determine the beaming <b>factor</b> <b>eta,</b> a measure of the apparent color temperature and a proxy for thermal inertia. MIPS was a unique tool to measure TNO temperatures due to its spectral coverage (24 and 70 micron) straddling the thermal emission peak. Current and upcoming facilities lack similar "short-wavelength" capabilities. MIPS data therefore form a lasting legacy for the analysis of TNO data from far-IR facilities including Herschel and ALMA...|$|R
