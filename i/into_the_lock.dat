5|$|The locks were {{suitably}} sized for Severn Trows, which were , and could carry 60 tons. The canal was not {{provided with a}} towing path for horses. Some boats sailed along the canal, but most were bow-hauled by men. Framilode lock {{at the entrance to}} the canal was a tide lock, with multiple gates to cope with all states of the tide. When a vessel arrived at the junction, a rope would be taken from it to the shore, and attached to a capstan, which would then be used to haul the boat <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock.</b> Once the canal was open, the Proprietors worked hard to improve the facilities, and a number of warehouses were built. Many of the shareholders were also involved with the Thames and Severn Canal scheme, which was completed in 1789 and provided a through route between Wallbridge and the River Thames at Lechlade. The navigation was seen as a commercial waterway; pleasure boats were discouraged by the imposition of a charge of £1 (2012:£) for the use of each lock.|$|E
25|$|Debris {{which got}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> {{sometimes}} {{had to be}} removed with a pitchfork. If the paddle valve was stuck because of trash, the lock tender had a 20-foot poll with a hook to get the trash free.|$|E
25|$|On {{some parts}} of the Montgomery Canal bottom paddles are used in place of side paddles. Rather than passing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> through a culvert {{around the side of the}} lock gate, the water flows through a culvert in the bottom of the canal. The paddle slides {{horizontally}} over the culvert.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Bradley Headstone {{has tried}} to put the blame for his assault on Wrayburn onto Rogue Riderhood, by {{dressing}} in similar clothes when doing the deed. Riderhood realises this and attempts to blackmail Headstone. Headstone, overcome with the hopelessness of his situation, especially after discovering that Wrayburn has survived and has married Lizzie, is seized with a self-destructive urge and flings himself <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock,</b> pulling Riderhood with him so that both are drowned.|$|E
25|$|Some narrow locks (e.g. on Birmingham Canal Navigations) go even further. They have single gates at {{the lower}} end also. This speeds up passage, even though single lower gates are heavy (heavier than a single upper gate, because the lower gate is taller) and the lock has to be longer (a lower gate opens <b>INTO</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock,</b> it has to pass the bow or stern of an {{enclosed}} boat, and a single gate has a wider arc than two half-gates).|$|E
25|$|Banks demanded more {{protection}} and safe makers responded by designing larger, heavier safes. Safes {{with a key}} lock were still vulnerable through the key hole, and bank robbers soon learned to blast off the door by pouring explosives in this opening. In 1861, inventor Linus Yale Jr. introduced the modern combination lock. Bankers quickly adopted Yale's lock for their safes, but bank robbers came up with several ways {{to get past the}} new invention. It was possible to use force to punch the combination lock through the door. Other experienced burglars learned to drill holes <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> case and use mirrors to view the slots in the combination wheels inside the mechanism. A more direct approach was to simply kidnap the bank manager and force him to reveal the combination.|$|E

2500|$|Most locks were {{fitted with}} V gates, but some locks, {{particularly}} around Seven Locks (7, 9, 10, and 12), and also all three North Branch locks (Locks 73–75 [...] ), were re-fitted with mechanical drop gates {{to speed up}} traffic in those areas. (Note that lock 6 had been converted to a drop gate, and later converted back to a V gate.) With the mechanical locks, a lever pulls a rod which connects to a crank, connected to another rod which turned the wicket valve {{which was in the}} floor (below where the gate would rest when opened) and water flows below the floor and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock.</b> Hahn states this brought the time to lock through from about 10 minutes to around 3 minutes.|$|E
2500|$|The trigger engages one {{arm of a}} [...] "z"-shaped sear {{pivoting}} in its centre {{between two}} upstanding brackets riveted or brazed {{to the inside of}} the lockplate. The other arm of the sear passes through a hole in the lockplate, and engages in a blind hole on the inner side of the wheel, thus effectively locking it and preventing any rotation but only because of a secondary sear or wedge that is pressed under the rear arm of the sear—that is between the lockplate and the sear—when the forward part of it engages into the recess in the wheel. When the trigger is pulled, the secondary lever is withdrawn from its position and the strong pull of the mainspring pushes the unsupported [...] main sear back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> and the wheel is free to rotate. The mechanism may seem overconstructed, but it prevents the trigger mechanism from working against the very powerful mainspring as it is the case with all vertical acting sears in flint and percussion locks or even modern firearms that still have cocks (revolvers).|$|E
2500|$|Little Slackwater was {{a tricky}} place to navigate. Not {{only did it}} {{have a lot of}} hairpin turns, but also just before Guard lock #5, there was a strip of land in the water called [...] "the pier" [...] : loaded boats going {{downstream}} would have to go outside the pier, and unloaded boats on the inside, thus making steering difficult for the loaded boats to get <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock.</b> If the current was fast in the river it could go as fast as the boat, rendering the tiller useless, and thus, a boat could be almost impossible to steer. One man reported that at the slackwater, they had him sit {{at the front of the}} boat with a hatchet in case they had to cut the towline , and had a couple of [...] hatches turned upside down, so that they could escape to shore on the hatches. On 1 May 1903, the towline to Boat No. 6 broke, with Captain Keim, Mrs. Keim, their two daughters, and Harry Newkirk aboard. One daughter drowned, another suffered a broken leg, and the captain died later of injuries. The rest (including the mules aboard) survived.|$|E

With the gate open the magnets in the two levers repel each other so they do not lock or stick together, which might prevent the gate from closing properly. Advantages are very easy one-handed operation, re-engaging without additional user input and few mechanical parts that can fail.|$|R
