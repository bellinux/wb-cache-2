40|$|Abstract. The present {{research}} was conducted to provide information {{on the influence of}} stunning methods in conjunction with refrigeration and freezing time on the textural and rheological properties of raw pork meat. Textural properties such as hardness, cohesiveness, adhesiveness and fracture force of raw pork meat was analysed for fresh meat, after 3 days of refrigeration, 15 days, 30 days and 60 days freezing time. Meat hardness increased sharply after 3 days of refrigeration and showed no significant differences after 15 days of freezing compared to 3 days refrigeration time. The meat hardness decreased significantly after 30 days of freezing compared to samples freezed for 15 days. The hardness of meat samples from gas <b>stunned</b> <b>animals</b> was 2. 57 times higher, compared to the hardness of meat from electrical <b>stunned</b> <b>animals...</b>|$|R

40|$|The present {{research}} was conducted to provide information {{on the influence of}} stunning methods in conjunction with refrigeration and freezing time on the textural and rheological properties of raw meat. Pork raw meat, commercially available, was analyzed for textural properties such as hardness, cohesiveness, adhesiveness and fracture force. Sample were analyzed fresh, after 3 days of refrigeration, and 15 days, 30 days and 60 days freezing time in commercially available refrigerators mimicking the storing conditions used by consumers. For pork raw meat, hardness increased sharply after 3 days of refrigeration and showed no significant differences after 15 days of freezing compared to 3 days refrigeration time. After 30 days of freezing the raw pork meat samples’ hardness decreased significantly compared to the hardness of the samples freeze for 15 days. Hardness of gas stunning raw pork meat samples compared to electrical stunning raw pork meat samples was 2. 57 times higher indicating a better firmness of the gas stunning raw pork meat.

40|$|This study {{compared}} the stress induced in captive estuarine crocodiles, Crocodylus porosus, by two different handling methods: manual restraint (noosing with ropes) and immobilization by electro-stunning. To stun, a short charge (approx. 6 s) at 110 V {{was delivered to}} the back of the necks of C. porosus using a custom-built device, which immobilized the animals for 5 - 10 min. Immobilized and restrained animals were measured and sexed, and the condition of the skin assessed. Blood samples were taken from some animals immediately after restraint or immobilization. Other animals were returned to their pens to recover for periods of 30 min, 1, 4, 12, 24 or 48 hours after which they were stunned and blood samples taken. Individual animals (mean body length 1. 96 m, N= 99) were bled only once. Haematocrit and haemoglobin concentrations were measured and plasma samples were analysed for corticosterone, glucose and lactate levels. Following restraint, there were significant increases in haematocrit, haemoglobin, glucose, lactate and corticosterone concentrations in C. porosus. For restrained animals, recovery to baseline levels occurred after approximately 8 hours. The stress response of <b>stunned</b> <b>animals</b> was significantly reduced compared to manually captured and restrained crocodiles. Both groups showed a significant increase in haematocrit, haemoglobin concentration and lactate levels, however the magnitude of change was significantly reduced, and recovery was faster in <b>stunned</b> <b>animals.</b> No increase in either glucose or corticosterone levels occurred with immobilisation. The results imply that immobilization by electro-stunning is much less stressful. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent decades}} the {{availability}} of halal meat in shops, restaurants and public institutions in the UK has become a reoccurring feature of public debate. Muslims (as well as Jews) are exempt from the legal requirement to <b>stun</b> <b>animals</b> prior to slaughter and it is thus widely assumed that most halal meat in the UK is produced without stunning animals, when the reverse {{is in fact the}} case. There is a distinct lack of transparency in the UK meat industry and public understanding of these issues is not as clear-cut as it could be. Misunderstandings often emerge because halal meat is difficult to identify in the food supply chain. As meat from 'non-stunned' halal slaughter has become visible in recent decades, the commercial sensitivities associated with halal meat from <b>stunned</b> <b>animals</b> have also grown, with supermarkets now often failing to label meat as halal; this adds the confusion, both for Muslim and non-Muslim consumers alike. Not surprisingly, evidence suggests that as well as animal welfare considerations, public concern about {{the availability of}} halal meat and methods of slaughter in the UK is also linked to wider concerns about immigration and integration, as perpetuated through the media. In this paper I explore and compare these issues with developments that emerged around Jewish migration to the UK in the 19 th century, when public controversy emerged around the 'Alien Question'. During this period, Jewish migrants from Russian and Eastern Europe were seen to be responsible for unemployment, housing shortages, and the increasing cost of poverty, very similar concerns to those expressed about Muslim migrants and refugees today. Concerns about religious animal slaughter and animal welfare are consistent across these historical periods and the paper explores {{the extent to which these}} issues act as a proxy for real life problems connected to wider processes of socioeconomic development and change. Based on research on halal and kosher meat markets, and Jewish and Muslim communities (around Europe) over the last two years, I draw on a range of theoretical perspectives to illustrate the underlying complexities of the issues involved...|$|R
50|$|Captive bolt : Commonly {{used for}} cattle and other livestock. The bolt is fired through the {{forehead}} causing massive {{disruption of the}} cerebral cortex.

40|$|Assessing {{unconsciousness}} {{is important}} to safeguard animal welfare shortly after stunning at the slaughter plant. Indicators that can be visually evaluated are most often used when assessing unconsciousness, {{as they can be}} easily applied in slaughter plants. These indicators include reflexes originating from the brain stem (e. g. eye reflexes) or from the spinal cord (e. g. pedal reflex) and behavioural indicators such as loss of posture, vocalisations and rhythmic breathing. When physically stunning an animal, for example, captive bolt, most important indicators looked at are posture, righting reflex, rhythmic breathing and the corneal or palpebral reflex that should all be absent if the animal is unconscious. Spinal reflexes are difficult as a measure of unconsciousness with this type of stunning, as they may occur more vigorous. For stunning methods that do not physically destroy the brain, for example, electrical and gas stunning, most important indicators looked at are posture, righting reflex, natural blinking response, rhythmic breathing, vocalisations and focused eye movement that should all be absent if the animal is unconscious. Brain stem reflexes such as the cornea reflex are difficult as measures of unconsciousness in electrically <b>stunned</b> <b>animals,</b> as they may reflect residual brain stem activity and not necessarily consciousness. Under commercial conditions, none of the indicators mentioned above should be used as a single indicator to determine unconsciousness after stunning. Multiple indicators should be used to determine unconsciousness and sufficient time should be left for the animal to die following exsanguination before starting invasive dressing procedures such as scalding or skinning.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this review was to summarize the currently available data describing the sensitivity and specificity of indicators of unconsciousness and death in the following stun-kill methods and species combinations: 1) penetrative captive bolt for bovine animals, 2) head-only electrical stunning for pigs, 3) headonly electrical stunning for sheep and goats, 4) electrical waterbath for poultry (chickens and turkeys), 5) carbon dioxide at high concentration for pigs, 6) all authorized gas methods to slaughter chickens and turkeys (carbon dioxide at high concentration, carbon dioxide in two phases, carbon dioxide associated with inert gases and inert gases alone), 7) slaughter without stunning for bovine animals, 8) slaughter without stunning for sheep and goats, 9) slaughter without stunning for chickens and turkeys. The reference tests for unconsciousness and death were to have been measured using electroencephalography (EEG). The definition of unconsciousness and death based on EEG were not specified, and the definition used by authors was reported. The index tests of interest were a variety of indicators requested by the funding agency such as no corneal reflex and immediate collapse. The index tests differed by stun-kill methods and species combination. A comprehensive search identified 22 publications contained 24 species-stun/kill method combinations. No studies explicitly reported the sensitivity and specificity of the indicators in conscious and unconscious animals. Many studies reported the proportion of <b>stunned</b> <b>animals</b> with indicators, rather than the proportion of unconscious or conscious animals at a set time point with the indicators.

60|$|In {{order to}} crease a wild horse the hunter {{requires}} to {{be a perfect}} shot, {{and it is not}} every man of the west who carries a rifle that can do it successfully.

If it hits the exact spot the horse falls as instantaneously, and dead to all appearance; but, in reality, he is only stunned, and if left for a few minutes will rise and gallop away nearly as well as ever. When hunters crease a horse successfully they put a rope, or halter, round his under jaw, and hobbles round his feet, so that when he rises he is secured, and, after considerable trouble, reduced to obedience.|$|R
40|$|The European Union law on {{slaughter}} imposes {{the obligation}} to <b>stun</b> the <b>animal</b> before slaughter, {{with the exception of}} religious slaughter, among which falls the islamic (dir. 74 / 577 /CEE; reg. 1099 / 2009 /CE). The EU law, founded on philosophical assumptions other than those of the Jewish and Islamic tradition, therefore respects this tradition. Even the food safety legislation considers religious slaughter practices, when necessary. For the remains, it does not conflict with the practices of ritual slaughter, particularly Islamic (reg. 178 / 2002 /CE; reg. 852 / 2004 /CE; reg. 853 / 2004 /CE; reg. 1935 / 2004 /CE). The compliance with Islamic rules regarding food, which descend from the Koran, is attested, in Italiy, by a “halal” certification system. An Islamic religious authority (CO. RE. IS. – Comunità religiosa islamica italiana) oversees it, and issues a “Halal-Italia” certification.

5000|$|According to the law, <b>animals</b> {{should be}} <b>stunned</b> into {{unconsciousness}} {{prior to their}} slaughter to ensure a death with less suffering than in killing methods used earlier.

50|$|The largest {{species of}} Agkistrodon, Agkistrodon piscivorus, relies on venom to quickly catch prey. In a study {{conducted}} at the College of Medicine at the University of Florida, their venom was injected into the lymph fluid of a frog. The frog immediately suffocated because {{of the collapse of}} its lung sacs. The venom even resulted in lung constriction when directly applied {{to the surface of the}} frog's lungs. To test this, trace amounts of venom were dropped onto a single pulmonary sac in a frog's lung after it was anesthetized and its chest cavity dissected open. A drop of solution containing a venom concentration of 1 mg/mL was enough to cause contraction of the pulmonary artery adventitia after 5-8sec in a frog weighing 40g. The study found, however, that this toxic effect is simply a tool the snake can choose to employ from an accessory venom gland it has. In most instances, the viper injects a venom that tends to immobilize, not kill its prey before ingestion. In this case, the main venom glands secrete a toxin that inhibits the prey’s sympathetic response to flee or fend off its predator. This essentially <b>stuns</b> the <b>animal</b> so that the predator can easily attack.|$|R

40|$|At a {{slaughter}} plant, cattle {{are sometimes}} exposed to rough handling which may reduce animal welfare (AW). In an observational study at four Swedish commercial slaughter plants, AW-related behaviours of cattle {{and actions of}} abattoir stockpersons handling the same animals were recorded simultaneously. The objective was to estimate the occurrence of different behaviours and actions related to negative AW during driving and stunning at large-scale cattle abattoirs, assess associations between such behaviours and actions, and analyse differences between plants and animal categories (dairy cows, beef cows, adult bulls and heifers/bullocks). Direct continuous observations of focal animals were made using laptops either in {{a section of the}} driving race to the <b>stun</b> box (132 <b>animals)</b> or in the <b>stun</b> box (313 <b>animals),</b> generating a total of 14. 5 h of observations. The <b>animals</b> were <b>stunned</b> using a penetrating captive bolt gun or a rifle. Counts per animal of 14 behaviours and 16 stockperson actions were calculated. Sixteen percent of the observed animals displayed total behaviour counts > 5 in the driving race, and 2 % did so in the stun box; 32 and 8 % of the observed animals received total counts > 5 of stockperson actions in the race and stun box, respectively. We estimated that two-thirds of the animals were processed without displaying/receiving any of the behaviours/actions associated with severely negative AW. AW scores were acquired by adding together all observed behaviour counts (and action counts, separately) weighted by expert-assessed ratings denoting the degree of impaired AW. Spearman rank correlation was used to analyse associations between behaviour counts, action counts and AW scores. Only three moderate to strong correlations (ρ ≥ 0. 4, P ≤ 0. 001) between single behaviours/actions were found (“slapping rear” and “slapping front”; “prodding” and “shouting”; and “prodding” and “beating rear” in the driving race). The correlation between AW scores based on behaviours and actions was statistically significant but rather weak both in the driving race (ρ = 0. 37, P < 0. 0001) and stun box (ρ = 0. 22, P = 0. 0002). The effects of slaughter plant and animal category on behaviour counts and AW scores were estimated using standard or zero-inflated negative-binomial regression. The risks of most behaviours related to negative AW differed considerably between plants. In the stun box, adult bulls had a 2. 5 times higher risk of “struggling-kicking” (P = 0. 016) and a 2. 0 times higher risk of displaying “backing-turning” (P = 0. 016) than had dairy cows, indicating poorer welfare for the bulls...|$|R
40|$|Minipig breeds {{are being}} used as {{experimental}} animals in medico-biological research. The cardiovascular system of the pig frequently serves {{as the model for}} the human cardiovascular system. Histopathological myocardial alterations which may {{have an impact on the}} survivability in stress situations can be proven in clinically healthy fattened pigs. The objective is to examine whether similar myocardial alterations are present in minipigs. These processes must be distinguished from phenomena which result in the course of the use of the animals for research purposes. The present thesis is thus aiming at the completion of the spectrum of criteria concerning the experimental animal Berlin minipig. The hearts of 87 Berlin minipigs were examined. They were classified into different age groups (1, 2, 3, 6, 12, 24 months). 9 and/or 8 myocardium samples taken from each heart were prepared with hematoxylin and eosin staining, and 1 with Sudan red G staining. The following criteria were considered in the histological examination: inflammations, degenerations and necroses, fatty degenerations, dystrophic calcinoses, sarcosporidiosis as well as vascular alterations. The findings were collected semiquantatively by classifying them into different degrees of severity, they were compared with each other and statistically evaluated. For 35 hearts, the Luxol Fast Blue staining was applied in addition. The method of stunning was taken into account when the evaluation was made. The histological examination showed that pathological myocardial findings can be detected in clinically healthy Berlin minipigs. These alterations are age-dependent. Inflammatory processes had the highest incidence. The portion of tissue samples showing the said pathohistological alterations was 3. 4 % of the tissue samples examined in the first month of life, it rose to a maximum of 38. 9 % at an age of 12 months and it fell to 24. 4 % in the 24 th month of life. The portion of tissue samples showing degenerative and necrotic alterations was 25. 6 % at an age of 12 months, and 14. 4 % at an age of 24 months of life. No degenerative necrotic alterations were found in the 1 month old animals. Degeneration and necrosis were always connected with inflammatory alterations. Dystrophic calcinosis was only found in one tissue sample of the 6 -month-old Berlin minipigs. No degenerative fatty infiltration was found in any of the preparations. The portion of tissue samples with Sarcosporidia cysts varied between 0 % (1 and 2 months) and 30 % (12 months). Muscular-elastic intima proliferations at the intramural coronary arteries were found with a higher incidence with increasing age. The degree of severity of these processes was age-dependent, too. The first presence of swellings of the intima and of the media was proven in 6 -month-old animals (10. 5 % of the hearts). At an age of 12 and 24 months, their share was 50 % each. Intima-media swellings were exclusively found in the papillary muscles. The LFB staining is used for the detection of the myofibrillar degeneration as a form of early myocardial damage. The myofibrillar degeneration may occur in a diffuse form or as a myofibrillar degeneration of the transverse band type. An LFB-positive myocardial damage could be proven in 82. 9 % of the hearts that were examined. The <b>animals</b> <b>stunned</b> by the captive bolt pistol showed 75 % of LFB-positive myocardial damage, and the <b>animals</b> <b>stunned</b> by electroshock had a positive reaction to LFB of 93. 3 %. Two thirds (66. 7 %) of the pigs stunned by means of electroshock showed a moderate reaction. 13. 3 % of the hearts showed a moderate to severe myocardial damage. 6. 7 % each of the hearts of the pigs that had been stunned by means of electroshock showed a mild and a mild to moderate damage. In 6. 7 % of the hearts of this group no LFB-positive reaction could be determined. 25 % of the <b>animals</b> <b>stunned</b> by the captive bolt pistol showed a moderate damage. 15 % of them had the transitional form of a mild to moderate damage. In 25 % of the hearts of this examination group no LFB-positive damages at all could be proven. In one preparation each of the two groups that were examined, the myofibrillar degeneration of the transverse band type was proven whereas the remaining LFB-positive myocardial samples showed the diffuse type. An artifical damage of the cardiac muscle by the stunning and killing process itself seems to be given. Consequently, the significance of LFB staining for the determination of early myocardial damage in killed miniature pigs not caused by stunning is to be termed unreliable. The results show that pathohistological myocardial alterations can be proven in clinically healthy Berlin minipigs. The incidence and the degree of severity of the pathomorphological alterations are at the same level as was also determined for slaughter pigs of a different genetic stock. Infectious, infectious-toxic and metabolism-induced factors as well as repeated stress-induced micronecroses must be taken into consideration as the cause of the said alterations. When using the Berlin minipig in biomedical research, the presence of these natural myocardial alterations must be taken into account...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} and compare the influence of conventional and Kosher slaughter techniques in cattle on carcass and meat quality parameters. The conventional slaughter was done using a pneumatic captive bolt gun to <b>stun</b> the <b>animals</b> before sticking, while Kosher slaughter was done by sticking the animals and then stunning them with a 0. 22 calibre cash special captive bolt gun, 20 seconds later. The animals (n= 311) were randomly assigned into 4 treatment groups, namely; slaughter method (SM) (main group, sub-divided into: conventional slaughter technique (CST) and Kosher slaughter technique (KST)); electrical stimulation (ES), sub-divided into: electrically stimulated (ES) and non-stimulated (NES); gender (G), sub-divided into: male (M) and female (F); fat code (FC), sub-divided into: FC- 2 and FC- 3 (i. e. lean to medium fatness). The quality attributes evaluated were blood loss (BL), drip loss (DL), cooking loss (CL), presence of blood in the trachea (BLT), blood splash in the lungs (BS), shear force (SF), colour (L*, a* and b*), pH and temperature profile over 24 hours and the effect of subcutaneous fat thickness (SCF). Animals were mainly steers in the “A” age group with an average slaughter weight of about 400 kg. Different crossbreeds of Bonsmara, Brahman and Nguni cattle were used, which is typical of cattle slaughtered in South Africa. Blood loss, blood in trachea and blood splash were evaluated using 311 animals (CST, n= 141; KST, n= 170) but for the other parameters, smaller numbers were used because of the hectic nature of the trials. Evaluation of BL, BLT and BS were done in the abattoir and pH and temperature readings were also taken at 45 mins, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hrs post-mortem between the 10 th and 11 th rib on the m. longissimus dorsi which was where the carcasses were sampled for the meat quality analyses. The results of this study revealed that there was no significant difference (p> 0. 05) in % blood loss between the conventional and the Kosher group but the conventionally slaughtered group had a slightly higher bleed-out. Fat code had a significant (p= 0. 0475) influence on %BL, with FC- 2 (2. 42 %) group bleeding out slightly more than FC- 3 (2. 24 %). For % drip loss, there were no significant differences (p> 0. 05) between all the treatment groups except for fat code (p= 0. 0242), with FC- 3 (2. 95 %) samples exuding more water than FC- 2 (2. 42 %) meat samples. In terms of % cooking loss, there was a significant difference (p= 0. 0004) between the slaughter methods, with meat samples from the conventional method (22. 11 %) exuding more water than the meat from Kosher group (18. 16 %). For blood in trachea, there was a highly significant difference (p 0. 05) in all the treatments save for fat code, with FC- 3 group (6. 38) having thicker fat cover (p= 0. 0004) than FC- 2 (4. 44) which was anticipated. In terms of colour, there was a significant difference (p< 0. 0001) between slaughter methods for the L* value (lightness). Meat samples from the Kosher-killed animals (46. 08) were lighter than the conventionally killed ones (35. 40). Samples from the females (48. 29) were also significantly lighter (p= 0. 0057) than the males’ (37. 79). For a* value (redness), there was a significant difference (p< 0. 0001) between the slaughter methods. The conventional group meat (15. 58), were redder than the Kosher meat (10. 40). Gender effect was also significant (p< 0. 05), with meat from the males (13. 81) appearing redder than the females’ (11. 25). For b* value (yellowness), significant difference (p< 0. 0001) was also found between the slaughter methods. The Kosher meat samples (- 6. 49) appeared yellower than those from conventional slaughter (0. 26). FC- 3 samples (- 2. 36) were also significantly (p= 0. 0112) yellower than the FC- 2 samples (- 3. 05). For pH, analyses revealed a significant difference (p< 0. 0380) at 45 minutes post-mortem (pm) between slaughter methods. The kosher carcasses (pH= 6. 43) had a slightly higher pH compared to the conventionally slaughtered carcasses (6. 33). The ES carcasses (pH= 6. 16) also had a significantly lower (p< 0. 0001) pH compared to the NES carcasses (pH= 6. 89). At 3 hrs pm, only electrical stimulation showed a significant influence (p< 0. 0001). The ES carcasses (pH= 5. 72) were lower than the NES group (pH= 6. 49). At 6 hrs, only electrical stimulation still showed a significant influence (p< 0. 0001), with the ES carcasses (5. 56) still having a faster decline compared to the NES group (pH= 6. 01). At 12 hrs, the ES group (pH= 5. 61) still had a significantly (p= 0. 0008) lower pH than the NES group (pH= 5. 82). At 24 hrs, only the slaughter method showed a significant influence (p= 0. 0314) in carcass pH, with the Kosher carcasses (pH= 5. 53) having a slightly lower pH compared to the conventionally slaughtered ones (pH= 5. 56). The latter difference is probably not of any practical significance and could be ignored. Temperature at 45 minutes pm showed a significant difference (p= 0. 0248) between the slaughter methods with the carcasses from Kosher slaughter (36. 500 C) having a slightly lower temperature compared to those slaughtered conventionally (37. 220 C). At 3 hrs pm, the carcasses from Kosher slaughter (30. 060 C) had a significantly higher (p= 0. 0005) temperature than the conventional group (27. 050 C). The female carcasses (31. 260 C) also had significantly higher (p< 0. 05) temperature compared to the male carcasses (27. 890 C). The FC- 2 carcasses (28. 190 C) also had a significantly lower temperature (p= 0. 0149) compared to FC- 3 (30. 110 C) which was anticipated due to lower temperature decline in those with lower subcutaneous fat. At 6 hrs pm, the conventionally slaughtered carcasses (14. 710 C) still showed a significantly faster decline (p< 0. 0001) compared to those slaughtered by Kosher (20. 16). FC- 2 carcasses also showed a significantly (p= 0. 0104) lower temperature (16. 680 C) compared to FC- 3 (18. 740 C). At 12 hrs pm, the conventionally slaughtered carcasses (4. 720 C) still had a significantly (p< 0. 0001) lower temperature compared to the Kosher group (10. 240 C). The FC- 2 group (6. 690 C) also had a significantly (p= 0. 0011) lower temperature compared to the FC- 3 group (8. 890 C). Finally at 24 hrs after slaughter, slaughter method still showed a highly significant influence (p< 0. 0001) with the conventionally slaughtered carcasses having a much lower temperature (- 0. 420 C) compared to the Kosher group (3. 060 C). The male’ carcasses (0. 620 C) also had significantly lower (p< 0. 05), ultimate temperature compared to carcasses from the females (2. 990 C). There was also a significant difference (p< 0. 05) between the fat codes, with the FC- 2 carcasses (1. 010 C) showing a lower temperature, compared to the FC- 3 (1. 710 C) carcasses.
