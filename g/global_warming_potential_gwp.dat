2500|$|The <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> <b>potential</b> (<b>GWP)</b> {{depends on}} both the {{efficiency}} of the molecule as a greenhouse gas and its atmospheric lifetime. GWP is measured relative to the same mass of [...] and evaluated for a specific timescale.

Conversely, if a molecule has a longer atmospheric lifetime than [...] its GWP will increase with the timescale considered. Carbon dioxide is defined to have a GWP of 1 over all time periods.|$|E

30|$|Because all <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> <b>potentials</b> (<b>GWPs)</b> are {{calculated}} relative to CO 2, GWPs {{based on a}} shorter timeframe are larger for gases with shorter lifetimes than that of CO 2.

2500|$|However, recent {{technical}} advances {{allow the}} use of natural heat pump refrigerants that have very low <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> <b>potential</b> (<b>GWP).</b> CO2 refrigerant (R744, GWP=1) or ammonia (R717, GWP=0) also have the benefit, depending on operating conditions, of resulting in higher heat pump efficiency than conventional refrigerants. An example is a 14 MW(thermal) district heating network in Drammen, Norway which is supplied by seawater-source heatpumps that use R717 refrigerant, and has been operating since 2011. 90°C water is delivered to the district loop (and returns at 65°C). Heat is extracted from seawater (from [...] depth) that is 8 to 9°C all year round, giving an average coefficient of performance (COP) of about 3.15. In the process the seawater is chilled to 4°C; however, this resource is not utilized. In a district system where the chilled water could be utilized for air conditioning, the effective COP would be considerably higher.|$|E
