Institutional features; trade imbalances and demand variations; and customer demands for high frequency create a situation where liner shipping companies tend to operate {{with a high level}} of unutilised vessel capacity.

The analysis here concludes that two extreme strategies are followed: (a) Cut peaks, that is, to keep capacity limited so as to increase short-run revenue per transported unit, and (b) Never say no, which allows a higher level of unutilised capacity in order to maintain a high service level, good flexibility, and the possibility to grow in the market.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} demand for rail travel in this country which is {{difficult}} to satisfy. The result is increased congestion on Britain’s railways. One feature of rail infrastructure congestion is a direct link between <b>capacity</b> <b>utilisation</b> and reactionary delay. The latter is the secondary delay that an already late train causes to a following train. This thesis re-examines the relationship between <b>capacity</b> <b>utilisation</b> and performance (as expressed by the level of reactionary delay). It compares {{the effectiveness of the}} standard measure of <b>capacity</b> <b>utilisation</b> in Britain (the <b>Capacity</b> <b>Utilisation</b> <b>Index</b> or CUI) with amongst others a measure developed in the Netherlands (the Heterogeneity measure or HET) which uses a radically different approach. The analysis presented in this thesis finds that HET which measures how capacity is used through the spacing of trains, is a more effective predictor of the levels of reactionary delay than CUI which simply measures how much capacity is used. In both cases though, an exponential relationship between <b>capacity</b> <b>utilisation</b> and reactionary delay is preferred, reinforcing the work of previous researchers. In 2002 a congestion charge, called The Capacity Charge, was introduced in Britain. The idea was to encourage the Infrastructure Owner (now known as Network Rail) to accommodate more traffic whilst working with train operators to optimise <b>capacity</b> <b>utilisation</b> on the network. The Capacity Charge is based on the relationship between CUI and reactionary delay. However, this thesis shows that HET based tariffs would charge more for congestion than CUI based tariffs. In addition there is a greater differential between peak and off-peak charges. One conclusion is that CUI undercharges for congestion due to its failure to account for the impact of train ‘bunching’. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{adopts a}} {{holistic}} approach towards railway track capacity to develop methodologies for {{different aspects of}} defining, measuring, analysing, improving and controlling track <b>capacity</b> <b>utilisation.</b> Chapter 1 presents {{an overview of the}} concept of capacity and the railway capacity challenge is explained. Chapter 2 focuses on past approaches to defining and analysing the concept of railway capacity. Existing methods for estimating <b>capacity</b> <b>utilisation</b> are studied in four categories: analytical methods, parametric models, optimisation and simulation. Chapter 3 examines various factors affecting <b>capacity</b> <b>utilisation.</b> Chapter 4 develops the systems engineering foundation toward railway capacity. From process improvement methods, Six Sigma and its Define, Measure, Analyse, Improve and Control (DMAIC) cycle is chosen as the underlying framework of the thesis. Chapter 5 defines lean, micro and macro <b>capacity</b> <b>utilisation</b> based on the discrete nature of railway capacity. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is used to develop two novel methodologies to analyse lean <b>capacity</b> <b>utilisation.</b> A DEA model analyses relative efficiency of train operating companies based on their efficiency to transform allocated train paths (timetabled train kilometres) and franchise payments to passenger-kilometres while avoiding delays. A case study demonstrates its application to 16 train operating companies in the UK. The operational efficiency of stations is benchmarked from similar studies for ports and airports. Two models are developed for analysing technical efficiency and service effectiveness. 96 busiest stations in Great Britain are analysed by this method. For analysing <b>capacity</b> <b>utilisation</b> in the freight sector, the concept of ‘profit-generating capacity’ is introduced in chapter 6. It is applied in an American freight case study to choose between bulk and intermodal trains in a heterogeneous traffic. DEA is also used in another case study for identifying the most profitable commodities. Chapter 7 suggests using variation reduction and failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) to control <b>capacity</b> <b>utilisation.</b> For improving railway <b>capacity</b> <b>utilisation</b> it is suggested to find and improve the weakest line section, the weakest trains and the weakest station. A real world case study of the South West Main Line in Great Britain, demonstrates applying these aspects. For finding the weakest line section two existing methods of the UIC 406 and the CUI method are compared with each other. For finding the weakest trains a meso index is suggested. It can identify which trains can be removed to free up some capacity in the busiest section of the line. Simulating delays and removing the highest delay causing trains is another method suggested. The weakest stations are identified by applying the DEA methodology developed in chapter 5. Target values for train stops at each station are suggested to be fed to the tactical timetabling. It is concluded that developing methodologies to analyse, improve and control railway <b>capacity</b> <b>utilisation</b> is needed and the methodologies proposed in this thesis can be a stepping stone towards them.

40|$|Measuring <b>capacity</b> and <b>capacity</b> <b>utilisation</b> at seaport {{terminals}} {{is essential}} to ensure efficient utilisation of the infra- and superstructure of the seaport. Most of the methods that have so far been used to measure <b>capacity</b> <b>utilisation</b> {{are not easy to}} comprehend for a common seaport operator. Most of the methods are also data intensive and therefore not suited for developing countries. This article attempts to use well-known standard queuing models to measure <b>capacity</b> <b>utilisation</b> in a seaport using the seaport of Dar es Salaam (Tanzania) as a case study. Historical data on terminal performance for the general cargo and the container terminal have been collected to validate the model. Based on standard queuing models it has been found that terminal capacity for both terminals is being underutilised and that, as a result, ships are being subjected to unnecessarily long waiting times; a conclusion backed up by a more detailed simulation model. Although some assumptions on which common queuing models have been derived may not hold true in practice, it is argued that standard queuing models {{can be used as a}} quick scan for evaluating seaport terminal <b>capacity</b> <b>utilisation.</b> If accurate measurement is needed, more data may need to be collected to determine the actual ship arrivals and service time distributions and develop an appropriate simulation model. The methodology developed in this article, although validated using port performance data for the port of Dar es Salaam, is directly applicable to any other seaport. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Ltd...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we compare}} two {{alternative}} heterodox {{approaches to the}} analysis of long run economic growth.

We adopt a common framework based on the following assumptions. Firstly, we frame the analysis in discrete time. Secondly, we introduce a nonlinearity into the pricing equation. Finally, we introduce an explicit mechanism incorporating firms’ constant effort to bring together the current and the normal degree of <b>capacity</b> <b>utilisation.</b> We also explore the dynamic properties of the Classical and Kaleckian specifications of the basic model.

Trade imbalances and demand variations, market fluctuations and customer demands for high frequency {{create a situation}} where shipping companies tend to operate {{with a high level}} of unutilised vessel capacity. The purpose of the research is to identify the potential for enhancement of the physical vessel <b>capacity</b> <b>utilisation,</b> with the aim of reducing the cost per transported unit. The research is based on both qualitative and quantitative data included in three studies of short sea vessel concepts: ferries, RoRo vessels and container feeders. Vessel <b>capacity</b> <b>utilisation</b> can be enhanced by applying short-term and long-term measures and by counterbalancing supply and demand. Appropriate vessel design, efficient sailing schedules, stand-by cargo, price differentiation and improved communication between companies in the transport chain are among the most important improvement measures. Two approaches are available when matching supply and demand: to increase demand through larger market share, and to change supply in smaller and more frequent steps. Route characteristics and market conditions all affect the selection of an appropriate strategy for enhancement of vessel <b>capacity</b> <b>utilisation.</b> The different approaches are: the Cut peaks strategy, the Never say no strategy, or a combination of the two. The purpose of the Cut peaks strategy is to have a high average <b>capacity</b> <b>utilisation</b> by keeping the maximum capacity lower or increasing the market share. The Never say no strategy allows a higher level of unutilised capacity in order to have good flexibility, a possibility to grow in the market, and the ability to maintain a high service level. Knowledge gained from the research resulted in a framework for short sea shipping companies that are aiming at enhancing their vessel <b>capacity</b> <b>utilisation.</b> The framework consists of four elements: selection of <b>capacity</b> <b>utilisation</b> strategy, definition of sailing schedule, improvement measures for established vessel capacity, and improvement measures for changes in vessel capacity. The main objective of applying a conscious strategy and suitable improvement measures is to attain a long-term economic sustainable shipping service with a reasonable service level, flexibility and reliability towards customers. Consequently, both shipping companies and shippers benefit from the enhancement. Furthermore, society also gains if goods can be moved from road to sea, as short sea shipping is efficient in terms of environmental performance and energy efficiency and can ease road congestion...|$|R

Theoretically, capacity constraints limit the ability of firms to expand production {{in the short run}} and lead to increases in prices. Our results show that, on the one hand, price increases are more likely during periods when firms are faced with capacity constraints. Constraints due to the shortage of labour, in particular, lead to price increases. On the other hand, we also find evidence that firms are not reluctant to reduce prices in response to demand constraints. At the macro level, the implied capacity-utilisation Phillips curve has a convex shape during periods of excess demand and a concave shape during periods of excess supply. Our results are robust to the inclusion of proxies for changes in costs and the competitive position of firms. price setting, <b>capacity</b> <b>utilisation,</b> <b>capacity</b> constraints, demand constraints,non-linear Phillips curve, Switzerland...|$|R
