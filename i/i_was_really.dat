5|$|I'd {{done a lot}} {{of videos}} and wasn't always a hundred percent thrilled. For the most part, I was never thrilled with the results, so I figured I would give {{directing}} a shot. It was a pretty simple concept. Most of the scenes were featured at the amusement park, at a late-night outdoor celebration. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> happy to be able to include O.D.B in the remix video.|$|E
5|$|If it {{had gone}} by me, it's a two-on-one. So I got a little lucky there, but Derek gave me a great pass and when I got the pass I was moving across. As I skated across, Glenn had to move across the crease and had to open his pads a little. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> {{trying to get the}} puck on net, and I did. As I went across, Glenn's legs opened. I looked back, and I saw it go in, so I jumped.|$|E
5|$|Darla {{appears in}} twenty Angel episodes, mainly as an evil antagonist. The {{character}} {{is known for}} dying {{the most in the}} Buffy The Vampire Slayer franchise. Benz later emphasized: I just didn't know how it was going to happen. So when they sent me the script —which I basically had to sign my life away to read—I was sitting in my trailer and I just started to cry. I thought it was such a beautiful ending, it was the payoff and just really brought her whole life kind of to that one moment. So <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> upset my last day of filming because I really thought it was over to me.|$|E

60|$|THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. My knees <b>are</b> trembling. <b>I</b> fear <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>really</b> ill. Not {{so young}} as <b>I</b> <b>was.</b>|$|R

25|$|Soon I {{found myself}} on the main bandstand before this {{enormous}} crowd, Laine recalled. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> nervous, but I started singing 'Beside an Open Fireplace,' a popular song of the day. It was a sentimental tune and the lyrics choked me up. When I got done, the tears were streaming down my cheeks and the ballroom became quiet. I was very nearsighted and couldn't see the audience. I thought that the people didn't like me.|$|E
25|$|I {{was getting}} so heavy that even my vocalizing was getting heavy. I was tiring myself, I was perspiring too much, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> working too hard. And I wasn't really well, as in health; I couldn't move freely. And then I {{was tired of}} playing a game, for {{instance}} playing this beautiful young woman, and I was heavy and uncomfortable to move around. In any case, it was uncomfortable and I didn't like it. So I felt now if I'm going to do things right—I've studied all my life to put things right musically, so why don't I diet and put myself into a certain condition where I'm presentable.|$|E
6000|$|... "This <b>is</b> what <b>I</b> am," [...] said Margery {{to herself}} as she stepped blithely on. [...] "I never knew before what <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>really</b> a dryad under difficulties." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Nothing more? <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>really</b> {{speaking}} in confidence. You surely {{have heard of}} disagreements between him and Mrs. Vavasour?" ...|$|R
500|$|... "The Beatles were there," [...] said Madonna of her childhood, [...] "but I {{was more}} eager about The Supremes. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> into girl groups." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{featured}} guest actress Martha Plimpton as Sheriff Tracy Mathis. On her role, {{she later}} commented [...] "That episode turned out really well; <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> pleased with it, and where else but on Fringe would I {{get to play}} the sheriff of a small town?" ...|$|E
500|$|... "And then Mary J. Blige sang it. And then he {{took her}} vocal off it, and put my vocal back on, my demo vocal, without asking and {{released}} it. And I never even knew it was gonna happen, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> upset. Because I had just retired, I {{was trying to be}} a pop songwriter, not an artist." ...|$|E
60|$|Let me {{thank you}} heartily for your kind and prompt letter. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>really</b> and truly {{sensible}} of your friendliness.|$|R

500|$|The reason I {{added the}} piccolo trumpet and {{classical}} {{section in the}} middle of Let's All Chant' was mainly because I was embarrassed! I thought it was so stupid with that 'Ooh-ah' sound in it that I wanted to add something to lift the track musically. I have a classical background and went to a music conservatory, so <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> feeling embarrassed ...|$|E
500|$|EastEnders star, Natalie Cassidy also criticised the scenes, saying, [...] "You can't swear or show {{two people}} making love before the watershed, yet {{you can show}} people smoking class A drugs? <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> shocked." [...] Franks was not {{surprised}} that people complained, but defended the storyline, saying that [...] "the good that comes from storylines like this far outweighs whatever concerns people might have".|$|E
500|$|A {{shortage}} of new {{material and the}} slow progress of the sessions contributed to Dylan's decision to cancel three additional recording dates. Six weeks later Dylan confided to critic Robert Shelton, [...] "Oh, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> down. I mean, in ten recording sessions, man, we didn't get one song... It was the band. But you see, I didn't know that. I didn't want to think that".|$|E
2500|$|... "I'm {{certainly}} stoked by the result. It {{is such a}} great {{improvement on}} last year. It would have been great to have got gold, the top prize, but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>really</b> happy. It has been a long wait. I had to put it in my head that I'd get in some training this week, get a bit fitter. But <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>really</b> happy with myself; things have been going well for me. I rode well in Europe last year." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> suppose <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>really</b> {{engaged to}} Francis Shelmardine. But {{was there ever}} such a funny wooing? And what will Aunt Martha say? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sir, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>really</b> {{sorry if}} there is {{anything}} wrong about it--but --but it appears to me to dodge the water-lot question." ...|$|R
500|$|When {{asked about}} how the film was developing, Rosenberg stated, [...] "It's incredible. Sometimes it's like seeing {{exactly what was going}} through my head when I first had that spark in my head as a kid. Jon Favreau's {{bringing}} his own talent and vision with the adaptation, {{but at the same time}} it remains true to what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> trying to get at in the original story." ...|$|E
500|$|Ferraro said, [...] "When I made Far Side Virtual, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> into grime. I {{lived in}} Leeds {{for a year}} and I used to hear to kids {{listening}} to instrumentals on their phones, rapping over the top. I love the way that sounds: the texture of super compressed digital beats coming out of a cellphone and just a voice over it. Far Side Virtual was inspired by hearing music like that." ...|$|E
500|$|Koufax tried {{one more}} year of {{baseball}} and showed up for the 1961 season in better condition than he had in previous years. Years later he recalled, [...] "That winter was when I really started working out. I started running more. I decided <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> {{going to find out}} how good I can be." [...] During spring training, Dodger scout Kenny Myers discovered a hitch in Koufax's windup: he'd rear back so far that his vision was obstructed and he couldn't see the target.|$|E
6000|$|... "But it <b>is</b> what <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>really.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not pretending {{anything}}. <b>I</b> {{shall never}} <b>be</b> anything else," [...] said Mirah. [...] "I always feel myself a Jewess." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite sure. If <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>really</b> in {{love with}} her I {{certainly}} should not change. It <b>is</b> possible that <b>I</b> might <b>be</b> bullied out of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, Honain, what's this? 'Twould seem <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>really</b> joyful. There's {{inspiration}} in her very breath. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> another being. Nay! waste not kisses on those ugly fetters.' ...|$|R
500|$|Minaj {{has said}} that artists who have {{influenced}} her musical style include Lisa [...] "Left Eye" [...] Lopes, Lil Wayne, Smokey Robinson, Lauryn Hill, Jadakiss, Natasha Bedingfield, Remy Ma, Lil' Kim, Missy Elliott, Janet Jackson, Madonna, Beyoncé, Britney Spears, Marilyn Monroe, Grace Jones, M.I.A., Cyndi Lauper and TLC. She cites Foxy Brown and Jay-Z as major influences: [...] "I really loved [...] as a female rapper. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> interested in her mind and her aura [...] <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>really,</b> really into Jay-Z. Me and my friends in high school, we were reciting all of the Jay lyrics. His words were our words in our conversations all the time." [...] She said: [...] "I never really told Foxy how much she has influenced me and how much she changed my life, and you've gotta tell people that when they're alive to {{even be able to}} take the compliment, instead of paying tribute to them when they're no longer here", adding that Foxy Brown was [...] "the most influential female rapper" [...] for her, though she initially was compared to Lil Kim when she first debuted. Nicki and Lil Kim, often cited as Foxy's main rap rival, have reportedly exchanged words with each other, on social media and in their music.|$|E
500|$|In a 2008 {{interview}} with Christopher Coleman of Tracksounds.com, Gregson-Williams said that Hood attracted {{him to the}} project, adding: [...] "I happened {{to meet him at}} the Golden Globes dinner about three years ago. That night we were both nominees, but both losers. He had been nominated for Tsotsi and during the dinner I had spoken to him and he seemed like a really smart and creative guy...and into music. So <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> delighted when I got a call to meet him and discuss the possibilities for Wolverine." ...|$|E
500|$|Morrison said {{afterwards}} that he [...] "wasn't very happy" [...] with it. [...] "It {{consisted of}} songs {{that were left}} over from before and that they'd finally gotten around to using. [...] It wasn't really fresh. It was {{a whole bunch of}} songs that had been hanging around for a while. [...] <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> trying to make a country and western album." [...] He commented further that he seldom listened to it and had a bad taste in his mouth for both Street Choir and Tupelo Honey.|$|E
