30|$|In {{the present}} study, the energy {{consumption}} {{during the period}} of the “Thirteenth Five-Year Plan” and by 2030 was analyzed based on the developed bottom-up energy model. Three important constraints were considered in the analysis: (i) total CO 2 emissions will reach a peak value by 2030 as presented in INDC; (ii) CO 2 emission per GDP in 2020 should decrease 40  %– 45  % from those in 2005; and (iii) the proportion of non-fossil energy in total energy consumption should reach 15  %. China’s total carbon dioxide emission reductions and energy (mainly coal, oil, and <b>gas)</b> <b>consumptions</b> were calculated and analyzed subject to the constraints. Especially, the scenario analysis of oil and <b>gas</b> <b>consumptions</b> in transportation sector was conducted, and the importation roles of oil and gas were emphasized. Finally, in Sect. 4, the analysis results were reviewed and the improvement of fuel economy, quality of oil product, and fuel substitution in transportation sector were analyzed and discussed.|$|R

40|$|Summary Solar {{irradiation}} is recognised as {{an important}} parameter in the design process to determine the size of heating or cooling equipment for any building. There are numerous references to its effect in literature and the CIBS Guide contains information on, for example, mean monthly values for different latitudes and different times of year. Moreover, field studies have often measured solar irradiation specifically and modelling studies have given careful attention to it. Yet procedures to estimate energy consumption for the heating of buildings generally acknowledge temperature as the only meteorological variable {{to have a significant}} influence, and empirical analysis of measured data from field studies has, more often than not, failed to identify irradiation as a significant determinant of consumption. This apparent contradiction has been examined by statistically analysing measurements of weekly <b>gas</b> <b>consumptions</b> and associated data from three recent field studies of heating in dwellings. The results show that solar irradiation has an identifiable and significant effect. But the results also show that meteorological temperature and solar irradiation are themselves partially correlated. Thus the omission of solar irradiation from any analysis will result in its effect being partially attributed to temperature. The sensitivity of heating demand to changes in temperature will consequently be overestimated. The sun‘s influence on monitored <b>gas</b> <b>consumptions</b> for domestic heatin...|$|R
