In Guanacaste National Park both habitat type and degree of protection affect howler density and group structure. Howlers were found at the highest density and in the largest groups in areas of semievergreen forest, which ecological sampling indicates have the most consistent level of food production. Differences in density between the sector of the park that first received protected status and more recently protected areas may be due partially to the degree of protection the areas received.

Also, the types of land management practices farmers use differ across the different ecological zones. The policy implication is that agricultural interventions should be developed {{on the basis of}} agro-ecological zones, and blanket crop improvement packages should be avoided. The recommended policy action is that food crop farmers should be helped to improve the management of their agricultural lands by ecological zones at two levels. First, the practices that are common and promote agricultural production in each zone should be targeted for improvement. Such a policy will re-orient farmers towards the adoption of more sustainable farm practices. Second, land management practices that are not currently being used by farmers in each zone but have potential to improve crop production should be identified and promoted in the respective agro-ecological zones. A pro-active policy of this kind will provide farmers better land use alternatives in each ecological zone.

40|$|River food webs {{are subject}} to two regimes of {{longitudinally}} varying <b>ecological</b> control: <b>productivity</b> and disturbance. Light-limited productivity increases as channels widen downstream. Time windows for growth, however, shrink as discharge increases, substrate particle size decreases, {{and the frequency of}} flood-driven bed mobilization increases downstream. Mediterranean rivers are periodically reset by hydrologic events with somewhat predictable timing. Typically, a rainy winter with high river discharge is followed by summer drought with little or no rainfall and slowly declining river flow. The magnitude and timing of winter floods and severity of subsequent summer drought can vary considerably from year to year, however. Episodic scouring floods or prolonged periods of drought are experienced as disturbances, stressors, or opportunities by river biota. The timing, duration, and intensity of these hydrologic controls affect performances of individuals, distribution and abundances of populations, and outcomes and consequences of species interactions. These interactions in turn determine how river food webs will assemble, develop, and reconfigure after disturbance. We discuss how spatial variation in solar radiation and spatial and temporal variations in disturbance affects river food webs under Mediterranean climate seasonality, focusing primarily on long-term observations in the Eel River of northwestern California, USA...|$|R

Growth is necessary to solve economic and social problems, but harder to achieve as the age of plenty {{gives way to the}} age of scarcities. The challenge opens the door for an Asian economic model based on shifting of productivity from the individual to groups, <b>ecological</b> <b>productivity</b> instead {{of economic}} productivity, and a reversal to traditional Asian values – less materialistic than Western values. A new paradigm for economic thinking emerges to replace the one launched in the West 200 years ago. The key driver is the shift from distribution of benefits to burden sharing (a topic so far absent from economic theory). This makes the bulk of existing economic theory obsolete as it has been geared and refined over 200 years to guide politicians on the premise that more of everything is available. The American capitalism built upon ‘more of everything ’ comes to an end with scarcities of food, commodities, energy, water, and clean environment, reinforcing each other.

The {{aim of this study}} was to describe and classify the main soils occurring in the wetlands of the Southern Plateau of Santa Catarina, and propose criteria for identification of hydromorphic environments as an aid in demarcation of their boundaries. Soils of four wetlands, in the municipalities of Bom Jardim da Serra, Bom Retiro, Lages, and Painel were described, collected, and taxonomically classified. A transection was demarcated in each one in which soils were analyzed in sites with different degrees of hydromorphism, corresponding to the inner, transition, and outer areas. In hydromorphic areas, the content of organic matter in the soil is higher than in non-hydromorphic areas, which influences the color and classification of the soils. In these soils, Aquents, Aquepts, and Histosols predominate, and Udepts predominate in the outer area. The drainage class and the higher chroma in the subsurface horizons of the Udepts indicate that they are outside the boundaries of the wetlands. The dark color in the surface horizons, along with the greyish colors, associated or not with the presence of mottling in the subsurface horizons, were the most obvious characteristics of a hydromorphic condition, indicating that the soil is located in the transitional and inner areas of the wetlands...|$|E
40|$|For {{integrated}} {{water resources}} management both blue and green water resources in a river basin and their spatial and temporal distribution have to be considered. This is because green and blue water uses are interdependent. In sub-Saharan Africa, the upper landscapes are often dominated by rainfed and supplementary irrigated agriculture that rely on green water resources. Downstream, most blue water uses are confined to the river channels, mainly for hydropower and the environment. Over time and due to population growth and increased demands for food and energy, water use of both green and blue water has increased. This book provides a quantitative assessment of green-blue water use and their interactions. The book makes a novel contribution by developing a hydrological model that can quantify not only green but also blue water use by many smallholder farmers scattered throughout the landscape. The book provides an innovative framework for mapping <b>ecological</b> <b>productivity</b> where gross returns from water consumed in agricultural and natural vegetation are quantified.

40|$|From the 1960 s onwards, a `High External Input¿ dairy {{production}} model was applied widely in Cuba. Overall milk {{production of the}} national herd increased considerably, but the system was inefficient from both a financial and energetic point of view. In the early 1990 s, after the abrupt end of inflow of capital and other resources from Eastern Europe, the dairy sector collapsed. In the short term, the modern infrastructure of milk production deteriorated and the sector experienced profound vulnerability. However, in the longer term, this situation stimulated a search for more sustainable approaches, such as low external input Mixed Farming Systems (MFS). The current study aimed to evaluate two small scale prototype farms to assess the implications of converting `Low External Input¿ Dairy Farming Systems into MFS.

The year 2005 has to be seen as the corresponding year for all projections made in this Report.

Engineering can help &ldquo;to drive&rdquo; this evolution addressing it towards a condition of balance between individual and community requirements, especially referred to the effect of technological development on landscape. This effect can be referred to three dimensions: perceptive, functional and symbolic dimensions. The possible contribution to the management of landscape changes concerns all the three historic souls of Agricultural Engineering; in particular, Agricultural Hydraulics deals with the topic of landscape referring to both irrigation and the possible recreational use of canal systems; Agricultural Engineering determines plot form and size and woodland view; Rural Building deals with both the recovery of existing buildings and the design and making of new ones and their fitting in the landscape; moreover, the sector has developed new methods for the evaluation and the planning of rural land resources, especially about agriculture and forestry <b>productivity,</b> <b>ecological</b> stability and visual quality of rural land itself...|$|R

Traditional measurements {{such as those}} obtained from hemispherical photography (HP) measure solar irradiation, penetrating the forest canopy, but do not provide information regarding the three-dimensional canopy structure. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) is an active sensor technology able to describe structural forest attributes by measuring interceptions of emitted laser pulses with the canopy {{and is able to}} record the spatial distribution of the foliage in three dimensions. However, due to the beam area of the laser, interceptions are detected more frequently than using conventional HP, and GF is typically underestimated. This study investigates the effects of laser beam area on the retrieval of GF by using morphological image processing to describe estimation bias as a function of canopy perimeters. The results show that, using canopy perimeter, improvements in correlation between HP and TLS can be achieved with an increase in the coefficient of determination R 2 up to 28 % (from an original R 2 of 0. 66 to an adjusted R 2 of 0. 85) ...|$|R
