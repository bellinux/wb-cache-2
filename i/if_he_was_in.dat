5|$|Norio Tsukudani based Himegoto on {{an earlier}} four-panel manga she drew for fun during her time as a student. At that time, the main {{characters}} {{that make up the}} student council were instead members of the drama club. However, Tsukudani decided to change this when developing Himegoto to be serialized in Ichijinsha's Waai! magazine, and she decided {{it would be easier to}} manage a cross-dressing character <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the student council. Before creating Himegoto, Tsukudani read various works of fiction that featured cross-dressing boys, but many of them featured the boys being paired with other boys. When she proposed the idea of Himegoto, she wanted to pair a cross-dressing boy with girls, which Tsukudani herself wanted to read. In this way, she thought that a variety of different people would enjoy it.|$|E
5|$|Ruth had {{two hits}} {{in the second game}} of the season, but it quickly went {{downhill}} both for him and the Braves from there. The season soon settled down to a routine of Ruth performing poorly on the few occasions he even played at all, and the Braves lost most of their games. As April passed into May, Ruth's physical deterioration became even more pronounced. While he remained productive at the plate early on, he could do little else. His conditioning had become so poor that he could barely trot around the bases. He made so many errors that three Braves pitchers told McKechnie that they would not take the mound <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the lineup. Before long, Ruth stopped hitting as well. He grew increasingly annoyed that McKechnie ignored most of his advice. For his part, McKechnie later said that Ruth's huge salary and refusal to stay with the team while on the road made it nearly impossible to enforce discipline.|$|E
5|$|After Becket's {{election}} as archbishop, Foliot was nominated to the Diocese of London, {{to which he}} was translated on 6March 1163. His nomination had been put forward by the king, who wrote to the pope stating that Foliot would be more accessible as an adviser and confessor <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> London, rather than in Hereford on the Welsh Marches. Becket wrote to Foliot urging him to accept the translation. His transfer was confirmed by Pope Alexander III on 19 March 1163 and Foliot was enthroned at London on 28April 1163. Papal confirmation was required because the movement of bishops from one see to another was still frowned on at this time. The medieval chronicler Ralph de Diceto, who was a canon at London, states that the cathedral chapter at St Paul's Cathedral, London, the cathedral of the London diocese, approved of Foliot's selection. Becket was unable to attend Foliot's enthronement, and Foliot did not make a profession of obedience to the archbishop, arguing that he had already sworn an oath to Canterbury when he became Bishop of Hereford, and thus no further oath was required. The issue was sent to the papacy, but the pope refused to be pinned down to an answer. Foliot then attempted to make London independent of Canterbury by reviving Pope Gregory I's old plan for an archbishopric at London. Foliot proposed either to have London raised to an archdiocese along with Canterbury, or to have London replace Canterbury as the archiepiscopal seat for the southern province. Foliot did though support Becket in the latter's attempt to prevent the Archbishop of York having his archiepiscopal cross borne in procession before him when visiting the province of Canterbury.|$|E

Cancellara was in strong form, having won the Strade Bianche and having come fourth in E3 Harelbeke and Gent–Wevelgem the previous week. Boonen, however, was not in strong form: he had not won a major classic since 2012 and had not performed strongly in the previous week's races. Nevertheless, Cycling Weekly wrote [...] "you can never write the three-time Flanders winner off in a race like this." [...] The other former winners present at the start were Alexander Kristoff (...) , the defending champion, and Cancellara's teammate Stijn Devolder.

Daredevil penciler John Romita Jr. recalled that, [...] "Working with Al Williamson was much like working with my father [...] in that I felt that I was protected from mistakes. ...

500|$|Leading pro-establishment figures {{cast doubt}} on the mainland's {{supposed}} role in the disappearances: Ip Kwok-him said {{that it was possible to}} use mainland telephone lines in Hong Kong, so the phone call from a Shenzhen number did not necessarily mean Lee was in the mainland; he added that there was no evidence of abduction. After Lee's wife cancelled her police report, Yiu Si-wing disputed the need for LegCo to discuss his disappearance due to the cancellation; Michael Tien said that if Lee had voluntarily gone to the mainland, it could not be a question of mainland officials acting across the border; Wong Kwok-kin said that kidnappers demand ransoms and not cancellation of missing persons reports. Regina Ip said it was odd that Lee would be able to apparently telephone his wife freely <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> custody, unlike if he was detained in Hong Kong. Ng Leung-sing, during a Legislative Council discussion, claimed to have received a tip from [...] "an old friend" [...] that all five booksellers had taken clandestine speedboats to Wai Lingding Island (...) , an island south of Hong Kong that is administratively part of mainland China with no border facilities, and had been arrested for seeking prostitutes. The allegations of prostitution, criticised by pro-democracy figures as character assassination, were carried by TVB on its prime time evening news as the leading item. Ng later apologised under pressure, saying that he had repeated a rumour without having checked the facts but never mentioned Lee's name. Ng said he was merely trying to state that it was indeed possible to leave Hong Kong without identity documents, and that it was inappropriate to speculate at present. Lee's wife criticised Ng for his insincere apology.|$|E

2500|$|There {{had been}} much {{discussion}} in Denmark about the pseudonymous authors until the publication of Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments, 27 February 1846, where he openly admitted to be {{the author of the}} books because people began wondering <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was,</b> <b>in</b> fact, a Christian or not. Several Journal entries from that year shed some light on what Kierkegaard hoped to achieve. This book was published under an earlier pseudonym, Johannes Climacus. On 30 March 1846 he published , under his own name. A critique of the novel Two Ages (in some translations Two Generations) written by Thomasine Christine Gyllembourg-Ehrensvärd, Kierkegaard made several insightful observations on what he considered the nature of modernity and its passionless attitude towards life. Kierkegaard writes that [...] "the present age is essentially a sensible age, devoid of passion ... The trend today is in the direction of mathematical equality, so that in all classes about so and so many uniformly make one individual". In this, Kierkegaard attacked the conformity and assimilation of individuals into [...] "the crowd" [...] which became the standard for truth, since it was the numerical. How can one love the neighbor if the neighbor is always regarded as the wealthy or the poor or the lame? ...|$|E
2500|$|Furthermore: [...] "The Talmud is, of course, {{the great}} {{reservoir}} to which R. Isserles turns {{as the first}} step in attempting to solve a problem. The question at hand is immediately referred to an identical or similar case in the Talmud. The second step is the weighing of the opinions of the ראשונים, i.e. Alfasi (רי”ף), Tosafists, Nachmanides, etc. expanding and explaining the text. The opinion of the majority is followed by R. Isserles and even Maimonides, whom he respected very highly, is disregarded <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the minority. After the Rishonim, R. Isserles proceeds to examine writings of אחרונים, i.e. Mordechai, Ashri and Tur, and the latter is followed especially when the Tosafists agree with him. At this point, the Responsa of still later authorities are cited extensively in accordance with the well-established priniciple of הלכה כבתרא, paying due attention even to the opinions of contemporaries and to customs of Polish Jewry which the ב”י omitted. Thus, Isserles, in his responsa {{as well as in the}} ד”מ and his commentary on the Shulchan Aruch, served as a supplement and offered his community the code of Law adjusted to its authorities, customs, and needs. He spread the “cloth” over the table prepared by his contemporary, the ב”י." ...|$|E
2500|$|From Jeffrey's writing style, Hazlitt {{transitions}} to the conversational {{abilities of the}} man in company (and it is only in [...] "mixed company" [...] that [...] "Mr. Jeffrey shines"). Again, the portrait is mostly positive but with a few faults noted in passing. [...] "Mr. Jeffrey's conversation is equally lively, various and instructive. ... Whether it be politics, or poetry, or science, or anecdote, or wit, or raillery, he takes up his cue without effort" [...] and provides [...] "an uninterrupted flow of cheerfulness and animal spirits" [...] and enormous [...] "fund of information". Yet, again, his fault is that it is all too much: [...] "If he is ever tedious, it is from an excess of liveliness". In addition, he shows too much of the lawyer: [...] "what is said by another, seems to make no impression on him; he is bound to dispute, to answer it, as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> Court". Jeffrey also shows a bit too much of what Hazlitt finds typical of the character of Scottish intellectuals; in Scotland, [...] "they criticise every thing, analyse every thing, argue upon every thing, dogmatise upon every thing". This makes Jeffrey [...] "too didactic, too pugnacious, too full of electric shocks, too much like a voltaic battery", and he [...] "reposes too little on his own excellent good sense, his own love of ease, his cordial frankness of temper and unaffected candour." ...|$|E
