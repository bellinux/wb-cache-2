60|$|MY DEAR SIR:--Your doleful {{letter of}} the 8th was {{received}} on my return from Chicago last night. I do hope you are worse scared than hurt, though {{you ought to know}} best. We must not lose the district. We must make a job of it, and save it. Lay hold of the proper agencies, and secure all the Americans you can, at once. I do hope, on closer inspection, you will find they are not half gone. Make a little test. Run down one of the poll-books of the Edwardsville precinct, and take the first hundred known American names. Then quietly ascertain how many of them are actually going for Douglas. I think you will find less than fifty. But even if you find fifty, make sure of the other fifty, that <b>is,</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> of all you can, at all events. We will set other agencies to work which shall compensate for the loss of a good many Americans. Don't fail to check the stampede at once. Trumbull, I think, will be with you before long.|$|E
