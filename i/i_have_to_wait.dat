500|$|The {{building}} {{opened and}} immediately garnered widespread praise, especially for its acoustics. After attending {{a week of}} performances in the hall, a music critic for The New York Times wrote an enthusiastic account of the experience and congratulated the architects. One of Pei's associates told him during a party before the opening that the symphony hall was [...] "a very mature building"; he smiled and replied: [...] "Ah, but did <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> this long?" ...|$|E
500|$|Her love of tattoos, however, gained media {{attention}} in May 2010, after Lavigne and Brody Jenner each got matching tattoos {{of the word}} [...] "fuck" [...] on their ribs. Lavigne appeared in the June/July cover story for Inked magazine, where she discussed and showed off her tattoos, including an [...] "Abbey Dawn" [...] on her left forearm and an [...] "XXV" [...] and star on her right. Although she confirmed the [...] "fuck" [...] tattoo verbally in the article (calling it her [...] "favorite word") she had it applied after the magazine's photo shoot. She added that she eventually {{wanted to get a}} [...] "big-ass heart with a flag through it with a name... I'm going to wait a few years and make sure I still want it then. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> for that special someone to come back into my life." [...] In July 2010, Lavigne had her boyfriend's name, [...] "Brody", tattooed beneath her right breast. The couple announced that they broke up in January 2012.|$|E

2500|$|Humphries debuted the {{character}} off-Broadway in New York City {{in the late}} 1970s, but the show received such a poor review from The New York Times that Humphries later joked that he thought, [...] "Well, I'll go back to Broadway but I'll wait till the critic's dead – and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> 25 years. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> {{a quarter of a}} century for that critic to die." ...|$|R

2500|$|In {{the week}} {{following}} the race, Jones gave his {{view on the}} circumstances surrounding the race and whether championship points should be awarded, writing in Motor magazine [...] "My job is to drive racing cars, not to get involved in politics. As far as I'm concerned, the Spanish GP was no different from normal: it required the same amount of effort, it covered the same distance and I gave it the same dedication that I give to any other Grand Prix. These things would have been the same whether I'd won or lost. As it happened, I won the race, and now <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> and see if I'll be given the points." ...|$|E

60|$|It {{was such}} a change from the hard, ethical, {{slightly}} mechanized characters in the German play, which was as perfect an interpretation as I can imagine, to the rather pathetic notion of the Italian peasants, that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> adjust myself.|$|R
60|$|What {{will they}} do in England? was now the question. But for any {{knowledge}} as <b>to</b> that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> till <b>I</b> reached Washington.|$|R
6000|$|HE, with {{exemplary}} meekness: [...] "Only {{what you}} were saying before Grinnidge came in. You didn't whisper then. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> there for him while" [...] - ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I'll {{wait till}} the steamer goes into port, if <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> till midnight," [...] replied Mrs. Parkman positively. [...] "It is a shame! Such disgraceful management! Could not they {{find out how the}} tide would be here before they left Dover?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'If <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> {{three months}} before I can marry the princess I shall die!' was all this spoilt boy would say; and at length the king, in despair, {{resolved}} to send a fresh embassy to Desiree's father to implore him to permit the marriage to be celebrated at once. 'I would have presented my prayer in person, he added in his letter, 'but my great age and infirmities do not suffer me to travel; however my envoy has orders to agree to any arrangement that you may propose.' ...|$|E

60|$|I did {{not leave}} Waterton until after nine o'clock the next day, for, {{although}} I was early at the shop to which my bicycle had been sent, it was not quite ready for me, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait.</b> Fortunately no Willoughby came that way.|$|R

6000|$|... "My wife {{appeals to}} my father," [...] thinks poor Clive; [...] "it is from him she asks counsel, {{and not from}} me. Be it about the ribbon in her cap, or any other {{transaction}} in our lives, she takes her colour from his opinion, and goes to him for advice, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> till it is given, and conform myself to it. If I differ from the dear old father, I wound him; if I yield up my opinion, as I do always, it is with a bad grace, and I wound him still.

During the night I shall run down south, without lights, {{and have a look}} at her, even if <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> till the grey of the dawn to do so. She may see us; but if she does I shall crawl away at such pace that she shall not get any idea of our speed. She will certainly come nearer before a day is over, for be sure the bureau of spies is kept advised, and they know that when the country is awake each day increases the hazard of them and their plans being discovered. From their caution I gather that they do not court discovery; and from that that they do not wish for an open declaration of war. If this be so, why should we not come out to them and force an issue if need be?" ...|$|E

60|$|MY DEAR SISTER,-I mailed {{a letter}} to you and Ma this morning, but since then I have {{received}} yours to Orion and me. Therefore, I must answer right away, else I may leave town without doing it at all. What in thunder are pilot's wages to me? which question, I beg humbly to observe, is of a general nature, and not discharged particularly at you. But it is singular, isn't it, that such a matter should interest Orion, when it is of no earthly consequence to me? I never have once thought of returning home {{to go on the}} river again, and I never expect to do any more piloting at any price. My livelihood must be made in this country--and if <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> longer than I expected, let it be so--I have no fear of failure. You know I have extravagant hopes, for Orion tells you everything which he ought to keep to himself--but it's his nature to do that sort of thing, and I let him alone. I did think for awhile of going home this fall--but when I found that that was and had been the cherished intention and the darling aspiration every year, of these old care-worn Californians for twelve weary years--I felt a little uncomfortable, but I stole a march on Disappointment and said I would not go home this fall. I will spend the winter in San Francisco, if possible. Do not tell any one that I had any idea of piloting again at present--for it is all a mistake. This country suits me, and--it shall suit me, whether or no....|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Shame, gentlemen!’ he said. ‘Is this a {{time for}} Frenchmen and fellow-soldiers to fall out? We {{are in the midst}} of our enemies; a quarrel, a loud word, may suffice to plunge us back into irretrievable distress. Monsieur le Commandant, you have been gravely offended. I make it my request, I make it my prayer—if need be, I give you my orders—that the matter shall stand by until we come safe to France. Then, if you please, I will serve you in any capacity. And for you, young man, you have shown all the cruelty and {{carelessness}} of youth. This gentleman is your superior; he is no longer young’—at which word you are to conceive the Major’s face. ‘It is admitted he has broken his parole. I know not his reason, and no more do you. It might be patriotism in this hour of our country’s adversity, it might be humanity, necessity; you know not what in the least, and you permit yourself to reflect on his honour. To break parole may be a subject for pity and not derision. I have broken mine—I, a colonel of the Empire. And why? I have been years negotiating my exchange, and it cannot be managed; those who have influence at the Ministry of War continually rush in before me, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait,</b> and my daughter at home is in a decline. I am going to see my daughter at last, and it is my only concern lest I should have delayed too long. She is ill, and very ill,—at death’s door. Nothing is left me but my daughter, my Emperor, and my honour; and I give my honour, blame me for it who dare!’ ...|$|E
6000|$|This is {{a lovely}} place, which I am growing to love. The Pacific licks all other oceans out of hand; {{there is no place}} but the Pacific Coast to hear eternal roaring surf. When I get {{to the top of the}} woods behind Monterey, I can hear the seas {{breaking}} all round over ten or twelve miles of coast from near Carmel on my left, out to Point Pinas in front, and away to the right along the sands of Monterey to Castroville and the mouth of the Salinas. I was wishing yesterday that the world could get--no, what I mean was that you should be kept in suspense like Mahomet's coffin until the world had made half a revolution, then dropped here at the station as though you had stepped from the cars; you would then comfortably enter Walter's waggon (the sun has just gone down, the moon beginning to throw shadows, you hear the surf rolling, and smell the sea and the pines). That shall deposit you at Sanchez's saloon, where we take a drink; you are introduced to Bronson, the local editor ("I have no brain music," [...] he says; [...] "I'm a mechanic, you see," [...] but he's a nice fellow); to Adolpho Sanchez, who is delightful. Meantime I go to the P. O. for my mail; thence we walk up Alvarado Street together, you now floundering in the sand, now merrily stumping on the wooden side-walks; I call at Hadsell's for my paper; at length behold us installed in Simoneau's little white-washed back-room, round a dirty tablecloth, with François the baker, perhaps an Italian fisherman, perhaps Augustin Dutra, and Simoneau himself. Simoneau, François, and I are the three sure cards; the others mere waifs. Then home to my great airy rooms with five windows opening on a balcony; I sleep on the floor in my camp blankets; you instal yourself abed; in the morning coffee with the little doctor and his little wife; we hire a waggon and make a day of it; and by night, I should let you up again into the air, to be returned to Mrs. Henley in the forenoon following. By God, you would enjoy yourself. So should I. I have tales enough to keep you going till five in the morning, and then they would not be at an end. I forget if you asked me any questions, and I sent your letter up to the city to one who will like to read it. I expect other letters now steadily. If <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> another two months, I shall begin to be happy. Will you remember me most affectionately to your wife? Shake hands with Anthony from me; and God bless your mother.|$|E
