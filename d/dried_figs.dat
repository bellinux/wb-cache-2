5|$|The {{regional}} specialties {{that are}} a feature of early modern and contemporary cuisine were not in evidence in the sparser documentation that survives. Instead, medieval cuisine can be differentiated by the cereals and the oils that shaped dietary norms and crossed ethnic and, later, national boundaries. Geographical variation in eating was primarily the result of differences in climate, political administration, and local customs that varied across the continent. Though sweeping generalizations should be avoided, more or less distinct areas where certain foodstuffs dominated can be discerned. In the British Isles, northern France, the Low Countries, the northern German-speaking areas, Scandinavia and the Baltic, the climate was generally too harsh for the cultivation of grapes and olives. In the south, wine was the common drink for both rich and poor alike (though the commoner usually {{had to settle for}} cheap second pressing wine) while beer was the commoner's drink in the north and wine an expensive import.

40|$|Food safety {{management}} systems (FSMSs) and the scrutinisation {{of the food}} safety practices that are intended for adoption on the firm level both offer strategic value to the <b>dried</b> <b>fig</b> sector. This study aims to prove the hypothesis that export orientation is a major motivating force for the adoption of food safety systems in the Turkish <b>dried</b> <b>fig</b> firms. Data were obtained from 91 <b>dried</b> <b>fig</b> firms located in Aydin, Turkey. Interviews were carried out with firms’ managers/owners using a face-to-face questionnaire designed from May to August of 2010. While 36. 3 percent of the interviewed firms had adopted one or more systems, the rest had no certification. A binomial logistic econometric model was employed. The parameters that influenced this decision included contractual agreements with other firms, implementation of good practices by the <b>dried</b> <b>fig</b> farmers, export orientation and cost-benefit ratio. Interestingly, {{the rest of the}} indicators employed had no statistically significant effect on adoption behaviour. This paper focusses on the export orientation parameter directly in order to test the validity of the main research hypothesis. The estimated marginal effect suggests that when <b>dried</b> <b>fig</b> firms are export-oriented, the probability that these firms will adopt food safety systems goes up by 39. 5 percent. This rate was the first range observed among all the marginal probability values obtained and thus verified the hypothesis that export orientation is a major motivator for the adoption of food safety systems in the Turkish <b>dried</b> <b>fig</b> firms...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} the factors {{affecting}} {{the adoption of}} organic <b>dried</b> <b>fig</b> agriculture in Turkey were investigated. These factors were divided into three groups, these being social, structural and intellectual factors. The effect of these factors was established using the probit analysis method. It was found that, of the social factors, the education status, age and fig-growing experience of producers were important parameters in the adoption of organic <b>dried</b> <b>fig</b> agriculture. Meanwhile, among the structural/economic factors fig production amount stands out as an important parameter. As for intellectual factors, {{it was observed that}} the extent to which producers were conversant with subvention policies, kept up to date with <b>dried</b> <b>fig</b> export prices and/or were knowledgeable an the subject of aflatoxin were important parameters. As a result, in the diffusion of organic <b>dried</b> <b>fig</b> agriculture in Turkey education project about organic farming need to be increased. It was vital that producers be made aware of sustainable farming practices, quality and standards, export demand and expectations and the European Union and its practices.

40|$|The European Union (EU) {{market is}} one of the most {{important}} export markets of Turkey. Turkey is the leader country in the production and export of <b>dried</b> <b>fig</b> in the world and in the EU. This important product requires development of right marketing strategies in the EU market. Development of marketing strategies firstly involves identification of the target market. The purpose of this study is segmenting the EU market for <b>dried</b> <b>fig</b> and identifying potential target markets as well as making recommendations for the development of suitable marketing strategies. It is assumed that the firms, which have an internationally registered trademark and export to the EU, are able to set their own marketing strategies. Based on this assumption, a case study was conducted in a firm which has the largest number of internationally registered trademarks within the Aegean Region and produces and exports <b>dried</b> <b>fig.</b> Qualitative and quantitative methods were employed. Basically, the “Strategically Equivalent Segment” approach of Kale and Sudharshan (1987) is incorporated in the study. First, an interview was made with the vice president, who was responsible for foreign sales in the firm in question, in order to discover the market segmentation criteria.

Methyl bromide (MeBr) was the fumigant {{used to control}} pests until it was banned. The present study compared the use of MeBr (60 g m− 3 for 24 h) and alternatives—magnesium phosphide (1 and 2 g of phosphine (PH 3) per ton of <b>dried</b> <b>fig</b> for 5 days), and carbon dioxide (CO 2) at atmospheric pressure (in gas tight cubes for 5 days) and high pressure (2 h in pressurized tanks at 25 bars) —in controlling major pests (Ephestia cautella (Zell.) and Carpoglyphus lactis) of <b>dried</b> <b>fig</b> and in respect to <b>dried</b> <b>fig</b> quality. Fruit quality was investigated before exposure and after 2 months of storage at ambient conditions by analyzing moisture content, water activity, surface color, firmness, total soluble solids, titratable acidity, pH, and sugaring index. The effect on fruit surface was examined under a scanning electron microscope. The {{results show that the}} tested methods effectively controlled storage pests without any major adverse effects on quality, and each had an advantage for the implementation stage. Magnesium phosphide treatment of 1 g t− 1 for 5 days is recommended due to its low investment and operational costs, CO 2 in pressurized tanks is recommended due to its short exposure period, and CO 2 under atmospheric pressure in gas-tight cubes is recommended due to its low cost and suitability for organic production.
