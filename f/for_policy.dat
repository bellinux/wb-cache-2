First, <b>for</b> <b>policies</b> with high distributional uncertainties, we expect that less information is acquired collectively by a committee than <b>for</b> other <b>policies.</b> Second, <b>for</b> <b>policies</b> that show only size uncertainty, our model predicts intense efforts to acquire information collectively. ...|$|R
