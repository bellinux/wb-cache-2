5000|$|In {{order to}} avoid leakage at the packing or seal {{particularly}} when a liquid is dangerous, toxic, or noxious, <b>diaphragm</b> <b>pumps</b> are used for metering. <b>Diaphragm</b> <b>pumps</b> have a <b>diaphragm</b> through which repeated compression/decompression motion is transmitted. The liquid does not penetrate through the diaphragm, so the liquid inside the pump is sealed off from the outside. Such motion changes the volume of a chamber in the pump head so that liquid enters through an inlet check valve during decompression and exits through an outlet check valve during compression, {{in a manner similar}} to piston <b>pumps.</b> <b>Diaphragm</b> <b>pumps</b> can also be made which discharge at fairly high pressure. <b>Diaphragm</b> metering <b>pumps</b> are commonly hydraulically driven.|$|R

50|$|A <b>diaphragm</b> <b>pump</b> (also {{known as}} a Membrane pump) is a {{positive}} displacement pump that uses {{a combination of the}} reciprocating action of a rubber, thermoplastic or teflon diaphragm and suitable valves {{on either side of the}} diaphragm(check valve, butterfly valves, flap valves, or any other form of shut-off valves) to pump a fluid.|$|E

40|$|<b>Diaphragm</b> (membrane) <b>pumps</b> are {{reciprocating}} {{positive displacement}} pumps. Transport of liquid is achieved through reciprocating {{motion of the}} diaphragm. In the case of hydraulically actuated <b>diaphragm</b> <b>pumps,</b> <b>diaphragm</b> displacement is realized through the action of hydraulic fluid. Advantage {{of this approach is}} more uniform stress distribution across the diaphragm. The further development of this type of pumps is limited by largely unknown mechanical behavior of diaphragm structure, uninvestigated flow fields inside the pump and fluid-structure interaction. Finite element method (FEM) is numerical method commonly used for analysis of problems in mehcanics of solids. in previous works at our Institute, FEM has been successfully applied on range of engineering problems, such as simulation of pump doaphragms. however general nimerical tools are often unsuitable for engineering analysis of problems occurring in <b>diaphragm</b> <b>pumps.</b> In this work FEM and specially developed tools will be applied to investigate problems of diaphragm deformation...|$|R

50|$|A {{reciprocating}} pump is {{a class of}} positive-displacement pumps which includes the piston pump, plunger pump and <b>diaphragm</b> <b>pump.</b> When well maintained, {{reciprocating pump}}s will last for years or even decades; however, left untouched, they can undergo rigorous wear and tear. It is often used where a relatively small quantity of liquid is to be handled and where delivery pressure is quite large. In reciprocating pumps, the chamber in which the liquid is trapped, is a stationary cylinder that contains the piston or plunger.|$|E
50|$|A <b>{{diaphragm}}</b> <b>pump</b> uses {{a diaphragm}} to pump a fluid. A typical design {{is to have}} air on one side constantly vary in pressure, with fluid on the other side. The increase and decrease in volume caused {{by the action of}} the diaphragm alternately forces fluid out the chamber and draws more fluid in from its source. The action of the diaphragm is very similar to the action of a plunger with the exception that a diaphragm responds to changes in pressure rather than the mechanical force of the shaft.|$|E

5000|$|Liquid gasoline, being denser than air, is {{slower than}} air {{to react to}} a force applied to it. When the {{throttle}} is rapidly opened, airflow through the carburetor increases immediately, faster than the fuel flow rate can increase. This transient oversupply of air causes a lean mixture, which makes the engine misfire (or [...] "stumble")â€”an effect opposite to that which was demanded by opening the throttle. This is remedied {{by the use of}} a small piston or <b>diaphragm</b> <b>pump</b> which, when actuated by the throttle linkage, forces a small amount of gasoline through a jet into the carburetor throat. This extra shot of fuel counteracts the transient lean condition on throttle tip-in. Most accelerator pumps are adjustable for volume or duration by some means. Eventually, the seals around the moving parts of the pump wear such that pump output is reduced; this reduction of the accelerator pump shot causes stumbling under acceleration until the seals on the pump are renewed.|$|E
50|$|Ultra low volume fogging {{machines}} {{consists of}} a blower, a formulation-holding tank and in some equipment a pump. The machine can have an electric, battery or gasoline engine that drives the blower. The blower creates a low pressure area and forces air through the nozzle of the fog machine. Air pressure can be controlled by adjusting the engine speed. Formulation is delivered by means of either electric, gear, FMI or <b>Diaphragm</b> <b>pump</b> to deliver the formulation to the nozzle of the machine, or in other equipment it is delivered through creating a low air pressure in the formulation tank to force the formulation to the nozzle for easy application.The nozzle of the machine has a very specific shape, which causes a swirling motion of the air stream. The motion is achieved by means of several stationary fins that force the air to rotate. The formulation is delivered to the air {{by means of a}} supply tube that is situated {{in the center of the}} nozzle. The motion of the air shears the liquid formulation into very small droplets and then disperses it into the atmosphere. ULV fogging machines are the most preferred misting machines as the size of the droplets can be controlled by means of machine calibration.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} aimed at {{developing}} a small-sized air pump using an originally contrived balloon vibrator for wearable devices.

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the output {{capacity}} of a piezoelectric pump when transferring gas, this paper presents a compact resonant piezoelectric <b>diaphragm</b> <b>pump</b> (hereinafter {{referred to as the}} piezoelectric <b>diaphragm</b> <b>pump),</b> which is driven by a rectangular piezoelectric vibrator. The compact structure can effectively release the vibrating constraints of the vibrator, and enlarge its center output displacement, so as to increase the volume change rate of the pump chamber. Based on the structure and the working principle of this piezoelectric <b>diaphragm</b> <b>pump,</b> a dynamic model for the diaphragm system is established in this paper, and an analysis on factors affecting the resonant frequency of the system is then conducted. We tested on the prototype under the driving voltage of 260 Vpp. The results show that the diaphragm system reaches resonance under the driving frequency of 265 Hz, which is very close to the fundamental frequency of check valve. Compared with the rectangular piezoelectric vibratorâ€™s amplitude, the diaphragmâ€™s amplitude is double amplified. At this time, the piezoelectric <b>diaphragm</b> <b>pump</b> achieves the maximum gas flow rate as 186. 8 mL/min and the maximum output pressure as 56. 7 kPa...|$|E

40|$|In a {{recently}} invented class of piezoelectric <b>diaphragm</b> <b>pumps,</b> the electrode {{patterns on the}} piezoelectric diaphragms are configured so that the electric fields in the diaphragms have symmetrical radial (along-the-surface) components in addition to through-the-thickness components. Previously, it was accepted in the piezoelectric-transducer art {{that in order to}} produce the out-of-plane bending displacement of a <b>diaphragm</b> needed for <b>pumping,</b> one must make the electric field asymmetrical through the thickness, typically by means of electrodes placed on only one side of the piezoelectric material. In the present invention, electrodes are placed on both sides and patterned so as to produce substantial radial as well as through-the-thickness components. Moreover, unlike in the prior art, the electric field can be symmetrical through the thickness. Tests have shown in a given diaphragm that an electrode configuration according to this invention produces more displacement than does a conventional one-sided electrode pattern. The invention admits of numerous variations characterized by various degrees of complexity. Figure 1 is a simplified depiction of a basic version. As in other piezoelectric <b>diaphragm</b> <b>pumps</b> of similar basic design, the prime mover is a piezoelectric diaphragm. Application of a suitable voltage to the electrodes on the diaphragm causes it to undergo out-of-plane bending. The bending displacement pushes a fluid out of, or pulls the fluid into, a chamber bounded partly by the diaphragm. Also as in other <b>diaphragm</b> <b>pumps</b> in general, check valves ensure that the fluid flows only in through one port and only out through another port...|$|R
