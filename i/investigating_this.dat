5|$|Mulder finds Scully {{underground}} in Antarctica, {{in a large}} facility containing many {{humans in}} ice-like enclosures. He breaks Scully's confinement and uses the vaccine to revive her, but this disrupts the facility and cocooned aliens begin trying to escape. Just after the agents escape to the surface, a huge alien vessel emerges from beneath the ice and travels into the sky. Mulder watches it disappear into the distance as Scully regains consciousness. Some time later, Scully attends a hearing, where her testimony is disregarded and the evidence covered up. She hands over the only remaining proof of their ordeal, the bee that stung her, noting that the FBI is not currently capable of <b>investigating</b> <b>this</b> evidence. Outside, Mulder reads an article that has covered up the domes and crop field in Texas; Scully informs Mulder that she is willing to continue working with him.|$|E
5|$|Teams that toured other {{countries}} often became frustrated by lbws given against them; there was often an assumption of national bias by home umpires against visiting teams. Several studies <b>investigating</b> <b>this</b> perception {{have suggested that}} home batsmen are sometimes less likely than visiting batsmen to be lbw. However, the data is based on lbw decisions awarded, not on the success-rate of appeals to the umpire. Fraser points {{out that it is}} impossible to determine from these studies if any of the decisions were wrong, particularly as the lbw law can have different interpretations, or if other factors such as pitch conditions and technique were involved. A 2006 study examined the effect that neutral umpires had on the rate of lbws. Although the reasons were again ambiguous, it found that lbws increased slightly under neutral umpires regardless of team or location.|$|E
5|$|While the Enterprise is {{en route}} to Pacifica on a {{scientific}} mission, Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) receives a highly confidential message from an old friend, Captain Walker Keel (Jonathan Farwell) of the USS Horatio. Keel refuses to discuss his concerns, even though the frequency he is using {{is supposed to be}} a secure channel, and insists on a face-to-face meeting. Once they arrive at Dytallix B for this secret meeting, the crew discover the Horatio and two other Federation ships already present. Picard beams alone to the surface and is met by Captain Keel and the other captains. Keel reports strange orders from Starfleet headquarters and what he implies are suspicious deaths of Starfleet officers, and expresses concern of a conspiracy. Picard refuses to accept this without proof, but Keel warns him to remain wary. When the captain returns to the Enterprise, he is challenged by Counselor Troi (Marina Sirtis) about keeping his contact with Keel secret. Picard is skeptical about the conspiracy, but says that he trusts his old friend completely. The Enterprise resumes its previous journey. Picard has Commander Data (Brent Spiner) review all orders issued by Starfleet Command in the past six months. While the ship is still on its way to Pacifica, a disturbance is detected in nearby space. Upon <b>investigating</b> <b>this,</b> the Enterprise discovers a mass of debris that surely must be the shattered remains of the Horatio. Data completes his study and finds several strange orders from the senior levels of Starfleet. Picard informs his senior staff of the conspiracy theory, and orders the Enterprise to Earth.|$|E

In <b>investigating</b> <b>this</b> idea Lawrence determined that with the exception of D. variabilis, all dahlia species may be assigned to one of two groups for flower-colour: Group I (ivory-magenta) or Group II (yellow-orange-scarlet).|$|E
25|$|On 21 August, a {{man from}} Plovdiv, a {{southern}} Bulgarian, said that he recognized the suspected accomplice, who he said he worked with for five years, {{and said that the}} accomplice is a Bulgarian who has been involved with people who preach radical Islam. A report in the Bulgarian press reported that the Bulgarian police are <b>investigating</b> <b>this</b> lead as well.|$|E
25|$|In late January 2012, {{an unknown}} number of insurgents ambushed a thahan pran base before retreating. Rangers chased the insurgents and were fired upon from a pick-up truck. The rangers fired back in {{self-defence}} resulting in four dead civilians in the truck with others wounded. The rangers found AK-47 assault rifles, but also claimed that the four dead civilians were not affiliated with insurgents in any way. Soldiers from the 4th army regiment are <b>investigating.</b> <b>This</b> killing has angered many Thai Muslims as the four dead persons were mosque leaders (an imam, a moulana, a khatib, and a bilai).|$|E

25|$|An MP for {{the ruling}} Pakistan Peoples Party, Syed Mumtaz Alam Gillani, {{has come forward}} with {{testimony}} evidencing a purportedly serious security breach at the Marriott on the night between 16 and 17 September, several days before the bombing. Alam Gillani and two friends {{are said to have}} witnessed several large steel boxes being unloaded from a U.S. Embassy truck by a group of U.S. Marines and, according to someone at the hotel, transported to the fourth and fifth floors. Among the several people who witnessed this incident was Pakistan Peoples Party leader Sajjad Chaudhry. However, Alam Gilani {{was the only one who}} objected to and protested the apparent security breach taking place, but was met with silence from the American Marines. The hotel security staff did not respond to Alam Gilani's protests as they passively watched what was taking place, not being allowed to go near the boxes by the U.S. Marines. Alam Gilani has since denounced the newspaper account, asserting that he was merely making light conversation with the journalist; the newspaper, however, stands by its account. Pakistani authorities are also <b>investigating</b> <b>this</b> issue.|$|E
25|$|In November 1978, {{the body}} of truck driver J.T. McGarry, who had been shot {{multiple}} times, was found over 25 miles from his Ventura County home. Michael Hanline was suspected of having murdered him, {{with the help of}} an accomplice, because he and McGarry had both been involved with the same woman. Largely on this woman's testimony, Hanline was sentenced to life without parole in 1980. Soon after the CIP was established in 1999, the organization received correspondence from Hanline claiming his innocence. The CIP spent years <b>investigating</b> <b>this</b> case. They eventually discovered that a since-deceased attorney named Bruce Robertson had attempted to implicate Hanline in order to direct suspicion away from his own clients, and had intimidated potential witnesses. A witness had even placed Robertson at McGarry's home on the night of his murder. In addition, DNA testing pointed to Hanline's innocence, and it was established that the woman who testified against him had been on drugs, both on the night of the murder and at the time of her testimony. On November 24, 2014, Hanline was released from Ventura County Court a free man, and in April of the following year, a judge dismissed all charges against him, as the district attorney had decided not to retry the case. Having served 36 years behind bars, Hanline was the longest-incarcerated person whose conviction was reversed in the history of the State of California.|$|E

500|$|In Stansfield Business International Pte. Ltd. v. Minister for Manpower (1999), an {{employee}} fired for incompetence accused the plaintiff company of unfair dismissal and made representations to the Minister for Manpower under section14 of the Employment Act to be reinstated. After <b>investigating</b> <b>this</b> claim, the Ministry {{came to the}} conclusion that the dismissal was made without just cause and recommended payment to the employee. Although section 14(5) of the Employment Act provides that [...] "the decision of the Minister on any representation made under this section shall be final and conclusive and shall not be challenged in any court", the company applied for judicial review against the Minister's decision.|$|E
500|$|Maylam {{noted that}} he was {{initially}} attracted {{to the idea that}} the term hodening had derived from Woden â€“ an Old English name that he thought a more likely origin than the Old Norse Odin â€“ but that upon <b>investigating</b> <b>this</b> possibility found [...] "no sufficient evidence" [...] for it. He added that it would seem unlikely that the W would be lost from Woden in the Kentish dialect, citing the example of Woodnesborough, a Kentish village whose name is often interpreted as having derived from Woden and which clearly retains its use of W. Ultimately, he stated that [...] "one feels that the theory is based on inferences and analogies not strong enough for a foundation to carry the building erected on them". The idea of linking the tradition to Woden was also dismissed as unlikely by both Burne and Cawte.|$|E
500|$|Howard {{informed}} the Wiccan Lois Bourne â€” {{whom he met}} when she was holidaying near his second home, an old mill in Cornwall â€” that the Head of Atho {{had been in the}} possession of his family for many generations. Conversely, he told Valiente a different story about its origins: according to this account, Howard was living with relations on a Norfolk farm in 1930 when he met an old lady named Alicia Franch who lived with the Romani Gypsies. Franch allegedly first came across Howard when he was playing by a roadside pond on the summer solstice, and she took an interest in him, instructing him in her witchcraft tradition and leaving him a number of artefacts in her will, including the Head of Atho. In a newspaper interview with the Eastern Evening News he identified Swaffham as the location in which this had happened, adding that the old lady had left him a deed box containing [...] "teeth, nail parings and old parchments. The historian Ronald Hutton later commented that there was [...] "no means of <b>investigating</b> <b>this</b> story", but added that Howard could not be considered a trustworthy source.|$|E

500|$|The {{collection}} {{also received}} a review from University of Geneva postdoctoral research fellow in the faculty of law, Steven J. Barela, in the Journal of International Criminal Justice. Barela described the book as [...] "a constructive work with a wide purview {{onto one of the}} most pressing and difficult policy questions of our time". He stated, [...] "this volume provides a valuable entry point for <b>investigating</b> <b>this</b> kaleidoscope of legal and moral issues". Steven R. Ratner of the University of Michigan Law School reviewed the book for the American Journal of International Law, writing, [...] "In light of the complexity of the legal and moral issues, Targeted Killings is a welcome addition to the academic literature. It aims to combine in one volume perspectives from legal experts, moral philosophers, and military planners." [...] University of Reading law lecturer Robert P. Barnidge, Jr. wrote in the Boston University International Law Journal, [...] "Targeted Killings also provides some clarity as to the threshold between armed conflict and situations falling short of armed conflict". He concluded, [...] " [...] main contribution to the discussion lies in its focus on the willing use of violence on a significant scale by an organized group".|$|E
