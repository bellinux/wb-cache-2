5|$|Holmes {{described}} the Christmas setting as a juxtaposition between the joyful {{time of year}} and the grim world of Gotham City, including decorative Santas near Gothic gargoyles and Christmas lights in dark alleys. The city is dislodged from time and space, contrasting 1930s (and older) buildings with Batman's futuristic technology. The New Gotham area was designed for vertical movement, allowing the placement of enemies above and below Batman to create areas dense with activity. The game features high contrast between <b>darks</b> and lights, with exaggerated shadows and few balancing colors. The city was divided into residential, industrial and commercial neighborhoods, which were decorated accordingly: the industrial setting is bleak, the commercial area has corporate decorations and residential neighborhoods have lights in their windows.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{completion}} of Banjo-Kazooies development, Hollis immediately began another project. Originally set to be a tie-in for Tomorrow Never Dies, Rare was significantly outbid by another publisher, forcing Rare {{to develop a new}} concept with new characters. With a major emphasis on lighting, the game was named Perfect Dark. Hollis left Rare for Nintendo 14 months after the start of Perfect <b>Darks</b> development. Around the same time, numerous employees left the company and formed new studios. With major project leads departing, a new team took over its development and diminished the role of lighting in the game, making it a more straightforward first-person shooter. Despite the game's troubled development, it did not affect the progress of Rare's other teams. When Perfect Dark was still in development, Rare released two other titles, Jet Force Gemini and Donkey Kong 64. In 1999, Nintendo signed an agreement with Disney, and assigned Rare to develop several racing and adventure games featuring Mickey Mouse. The project later became Mickey's Speedway USA and Mickey Racing Adventure. Perfect Dark eventually resurfaced and it was released in 2000 to critical acclaim. The game sold approximately 2 million copies.|$|E

40|$|The <b>Dark</b> Triad is {{composed}} of three related subclinical personality traits: narcissism (excessive self-love, need for attention), psychopathy (cold, remorseless), and Machiavellianism (manipulative, cynical). The present study uses <b>Dark</b> Triad film/television characters to examine how <b>Dark</b> Triad people view others like them. It was hypothesized that (1) participants higher in the <b>Dark</b> Triad {{are more interested in}} films/television shows with <b>Dark</b> Triad characters, (2) participants higher in the <b>Dark</b> Triad have a more positive reaction to <b>Dark</b> Triad characters, and (3) <b>Dark</b> Triad participants see themselves in <b>Dark</b> Triad characters. Gender differences in <b>Dark</b> Triad character evaluations were also examined. Participants were shown trailers for films/television shows, most of which featured a <b>Dark</b> Triad character, and asked questions about the films/shows and specific characters. Participants were given a questionnaire that assessed their <b>Dark</b> Triad characteristics. Results showed no significant relationship between <b>Dark</b> Triad scores and interest in films/shows with <b>Dark</b> Triad leads. However, participants higher in the <b>Dark</b> Triad viewed <b>Dark</b> Triad characters more positively than others. Also, <b>Dark</b> Triad participants saw themselves in <b>Dark</b> Triad characters. It was found that the ability of <b>Dark</b> Triad participants to see themselves in these characters mediated the relationship between participants’ <b>Dark</b> Triad scores and their reactions to <b>Dark</b> Triad characters. In conclusion, <b>Dark</b> Triad characters are generally disliked, but this does not affect liking of films/shows featuring them. However, people higher in the <b>Dark</b> Triad do like these characters more than others, likely because they see the characters as similar to themselves...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In a {{companion}} paper (to be presented), lattice field theory methods {{are used to}} show that in two-color, two-flavor QCD there are stable nuclear states in the spectrum. As a commonly studied theory of composite <b>dark</b> matter, this motivates the consideration of possible nuclear physics in this and other composite <b>dark</b> sectors. In this work, early Universe cosmology and indirect detection signatures are explored for both symmetric and asymmetric <b>dark</b> matter, highlighting the unique features that arise from considerations of <b>dark</b> nuclei and associated <b>dark</b> nuclear processes. The present day <b>dark</b> matter abundance may be composed of <b>dark</b> nucleons and/or <b>dark</b> nuclei, where the latter are generated through <b>dark</b> nucleosynthesis. For symmetric <b>dark</b> matter, indirect detection signatures are possible from annihilation, <b>dark</b> nucleosynthesis, and <b>dark</b> nuclear capture and we present a novel explanation of the galactic center gamma ray excess based on the latter. For asymmetric <b>dark</b> matter, <b>dark</b> nucleosynthesis may alter the capture of <b>dark</b> matter in stars, allowing for captured particles to be processed into nuclei and ejected from the star through <b>dark</b> nucleosynthesis in the core. Notably, <b>dark</b> nucleosynthesis realizes a novel mechanism for indirect detection signals of asymmetric <b>dark</b> matter from regions such as the galactic center, without having {{to rely on a}} symmetric <b>dark</b> matter component. ar X i...|$|R

500|$|Retrospectively, Edge {{acknowledged}} that the game's frame rate and other dated elements of its design rendered it [...] "nigh-on unplayable". The magazine found the ambitious mentality which resulted in weapons and computer-controlled players being [...] "designed for possibilities rather than balance", both one of Perfect <b>Darks</b> most interesting aspects {{and the cause of}} its biggest problem: [...] "Restraint [...] would have made Perfect Dark a tighter, more focused experience, helped with those framerate issues, and removed almost all of the fun."

[...] However, The Observer gave a positive evaluation of the ballads; [...] "Hot Chip have had a happy way with a subliminal power ballad. And Made in the Dark can boast four of the best." [...] Pitchfork rated the album as 7/10 with a mixed review, describing it as a [...] "patchy, turbulent record" [...] due to the use of many different individual components and also said that it was a [...] "good record but not a great one".

40|$|We have {{considered}} a cosmological model of holographic <b>dark</b> energy interacting with <b>dark</b> matter and another unknown component of <b>dark</b> {{energy of the}} universe. We have assumed two interaction terms $Q$ and $Q'$ in order to include the scenario in which the mutual interaction between the two principal components (i. e., holographic <b>dark</b> energy and <b>dark</b> matter) of the universe leads to some loss in other forms of cosmic constituents. Our model is valid {{for any sign of}} $Q$ and $Q'$. If $QQ'$, then <b>dark</b> matter energy receives from <b>dark</b> energy and from the unknown component of <b>dark</b> energy. Observation suggests that <b>dark</b> energy decays into <b>dark</b> matter. Here we have presented a general prescription of a cosmological model of <b>dark</b> energy which imposes mutual interaction between holographic <b>dark</b> energy, <b>dark</b> matter and another fluid. We have obtained the equation of state for the holographic <b>dark</b> energy density which is interacting with <b>dark</b> matter and other unknown component of <b>dark</b> energy.

Also we have found the entropy at the horizon when the radius ($L$) of the event horizon measured on the sphere of the horizon.

500|$|Siegfried Kracauer said by {{coupling}} {{a fantasy}} in which Francis overthrows a tyrannical authority, with {{a reality in}} which authority triumphs over Francis, Caligari reflects a double aspect of German life, suggesting they reconsider their traditional belief in authority even as they embrace it. A contrast between levels of reality exists {{not only in the}} characterizations, but in the presentation of some of the scenes as well. This, as Barlow writes, [...] "reveals a contrast between external calm and internal chaos". For example, flashback scenes when Francis reads Dr. Caligari's diary, in which the doctor is shown growing obsessed with learning hypnotic powers, take place as Dr. Caligari is sleeping peacefully in the present. Another example is the fair, which on the surface appears to represent fun and escapism, but reveals a lurking sense of chaos and disaster in the form of Dr. Caligari and Cesare. The visual elements of the film also convey a sense of duality, particularly in the contrasts between black and white. This is particularly prevalent in the sets, where black shadows are set against white walls, but also in other elements like the costumes and make-up. For instance, Dr. Caligari wears mostly black, but white streaks are present in his hair and on his gloves. Cesare's face is a ghostly white, but the <b>darks</b> of his eyes are heavily outlined in black. Likewise, Jane's white face contrasts with her deep, dark eyes.|$|E
