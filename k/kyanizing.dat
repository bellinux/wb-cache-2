2500|$|For the {{preservation}} of anthropological and biological specimens during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, objects were dipped in or were painted with a [...] "mercuric solution". This was done to prevent the specimens' destruction by moths, mites and mold. Objects in drawers were protected by scattering crystalline mercuric chloride over them. [...] It finds minor use in tanning, and wood was preserved by <b>kyanizing</b> (soaking in mercuric chloride). [...] Mercuric chloride {{was one of the}} three chemicals used for railroad tie wood treatment between 1830 and 1856 in Europe and the United States. [...] Limited railroad ties were treated in the United States until there were concerns over lumber shortages in the 1890s. [...] The process was generally abandoned because mercuric chloride was water-soluble and not effective for the long term, as well as poisonous. [...] Furthermore, alternative treatment processes, such as copper sulfate, zinc chloride, and ultimately creosote; were found to be less toxic. [...] Limited <b>kyanizing</b> was used for some railroad ties in the 1890s and early 1900s.|$|E
50|$|Named after John Howard Kyan, who {{patented}} {{this process}} in England in 1833, <b>Kyanizing</b> consists of steeping wood in a 0.67% mercuric chloride preservative solution.|$|E
50|$|After {{construction}} of the Schwerin-Wismar railway, a station was needed at the terminus. The chosen site offered convenient access to the port of Wismar. By the end of 1847, the first buildings were built, two sheds for materials and a <b>kyanizing</b> works. Later a roundhouse, a carriage shed, a tool shed and a coke store and a coke oven were added. It was estimated that the {{construction of}} the planned entrance building would cost about 28,500 Thalers.|$|E
25|$|Since it was {{difficult}} to obtain stone for the locks, engineers built composite locks, sometimes of <b>kyanized</b> wood.|$|R
25|$|Locks 58-71 are {{composite}} locks. Because {{there was}} a scarcity of good building stone in the upper Potomac, they made those locks of rubble and undressed inferior stone. Since the stone was undressed, that made a rougher surface, so {{the interior of the}} lock had to be lined with wood so as not to damage the boats in the lock. The wood sheathing had to be replaced from time to time. Originally <b>kyanized</b> wood was used.|$|R
5000|$|... 4 Days, 40 Hours is a 1971 book by Riva Poor {{reporting}} on a [...] "revolution in work and leisure" [...] from a rearranged work week with {{four days of}} 10 hours each. In some cases, the book claims, companies can increase production and profit while giving employees more time off. For example, <b>Kyanize</b> Paints would make three batches of paint on each of 5 work days, leaving the factory closed on weekends. Employees agreed to work 2 extra hours Monday through Thursday, in exchange for Friday off. The factory was then able to make 4 batches of paint on each of 4 work days. This increased production from 15 to 16 batches.|$|R
50|$|Wood rot was {{an early}} {{maintenance}} evil. By 1841 a surface treatment called <b>Kyanizing</b> {{was found to be}} helpful, but used a toxic mercury compound for wood preservation â€” shortly thereafter the cheaper (and less toxic) Earlizing with copper and iron sulphates was adopted. When new longer routes made night travel necessary, passenger faced risks from collisions. South Carolina Canal and Rail Road Company experimented with a pine log fire on a flatcar covered in sand to provide light before inexpensive kerosene for lamps was invented.|$|E
