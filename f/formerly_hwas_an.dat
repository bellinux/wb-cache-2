40|$|The hemlock woolly adelgid (<b>HWA),</b> <b>a</b> {{native of}} Asia, is a 1 / 32 ” long reddish purple insect that lives {{within its own}} {{protective}} coating.

40|$|Background: Recent {{studies have}} shown the {{potential}} of Web-based interventions for changing dietary and physical activity (PA) behavior. However, the pathways of these changes are not clear. In addition, nonusage {{poses a threat to}} these interventions. Little is known of characteristics of participants that predict usage. Objective: In this study we investigated the users and effect of the Healthy Weight Assistant (<b>HWA),</b> <b>a</b> Web-based intervention aimed at healthy dietary and PA behavior. We investigated the value of a proposed framework (including social and economic factors, condition-related factors, patient-related factors, reasons for use, and satisfaction) to predict which participants are users and which participants are nonusers. Additionally, we investigated the effectiveness of the HWA on the primary outcomes, self-reported dietary and physical activity behavior. Methods: Our design was a two-armed randomized controlled trial that compared the <b>HWA</b> with <b>a</b> waiting list control condition. A total of 150 participants were allocated to the waiting list group, and 147 participants were allocated to the intervention group. Online questionnaires were filled out before the intervention period started and after the intervention period of 12 weeks. After the intervention period, respondents in the waiting list group could use the intervention. Objective usage data was obtained from the application itself. Results: In the intervention group, 64...|$|R
