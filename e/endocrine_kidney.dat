40|$|Partial {{ligation}} of the aorta {{between the}} renal arteries induces marked atrophy of the cortical tubules {{of the left}} (<b>endocrine)</b> <b>kidney</b> with a remarkable {{increase in the number}} and granularity of hypersecretory juxtaglomerular cells (JGC), which are found not only at the glomerular pole of arterioles but also in the walls of arteries and arterioles far removed from the glomerulus. Typical vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC), in which secretory granules appear, show a concomitant development of their Golgi complex and rough endoplasmic reticulum, with a gradual {{decrease in the number of}} their filaments. Microtubules also appear in the Golgi area. Thiery's periodic acid-thiocarbohydrazide-silver proteinate technique demonstrates that in these “intermediate” cells, as in mature JGC, the amount of glycogen is greater than in SMC. The newly-developed secretory granules of intermediate cells are stained by phosphotungstic acid at a low pH, as are the mature granules of JGC, an indication that both types contain glycoproteins. Light and electron microscopic autoradiography reveal that both JGC and “intermediate” cells of the vascular wall do not incorporate radioactive thymidine (injected during the 10 -day observation period). Thus, they develop by metaplasia of preexistent SMC. In control kidneys, radioactive thymidine is practically never incorporated into the nuclei of SMC but is found in a few glomerular and tubular cells of all zones except the papilla. The <b>endocrine</b> <b>kidney</b> shows virtually no reactive nuclei in vascular SMC, glomeruli, or tubular cells of the outer cortex.

40|$|Kidney {{transplantation}} is {{the best}} treatment option {{for the restoration of}} excretory and <b>endocrine</b> <b>kidney</b> function in patients with end-stage renal disease. The success of the transplant is linked to the genetic compatibility between donor and recipient, and upon progress in surgery and immunosuppressive therapy. Numerous studies have established the importance of innate immunity in transplantation tolerance, in particular natural killer (NK) cells represent a population of cells involved in defense against infectious agents and tumor cells. NK cells express on their surface the Killer-cell Immunoglobulin-like Receptors (KIR) which, by recognizing and binding to MHC class I antigens, prevent the killing of autologous cells. In solid organ transplantation context, and in particular the kidney, recent studies show some correlation between the incompatibility KIR / HLA and outcome of transplantation so as to represent an interesting perspective, especially as regards setting of immunosuppressive therapy. The {{purpose of this study was}} therefore to assess whether the incompatibility between recipient KIR receptors and HLA class I ligands of the donor could be a useful predictor in order to improve the survival of the transplanted kidney and also to select patients who might benefit of a reduced regimen. One hundred and thirteen renal transplant patients from 1999 to 2005 were enrolled. Genomic DNA was extracted for each of them and their donors and genotyping of HLA A, B, C and 14 KIR genes was carried out. Data analysis was conducted on two case-control studies: one aimed at assessing the outcome of acute rejection and the other to assess the long term transplant outcome. The results showed that two genes, KIR 2 DS 1 and KIR 3 DS 1, are associated with the development of acute rejection (p = 0. 02 and p = 0. 05, respectively). The presence of the KIR 2 DS 3 gene is associated with a better performance of serum creatinine and glomerular filtration rate (MDRD) over time (4 and 5 years after transplantation, p < 0. 05), while in the presence of ligand, the serum creatinine and MDRD trend seems to get worse in the long term. The analysis performed on the population, according to whether there was deterioration of renal function or not in the long term, showed that the absence of the KIR 2 DL 1 gene is strongly associated with an increase of 20...|$|E

Results:Seventy-one families were identified where both a parent and an offspring had kidney cancer, giving a familial risk for offspring of 1. 56 (1. 22 to 1. 95) and population attributable proportion of 0. 78 %. A risk for kidney cancer from an affected sibling was considerably higher with a SIR of 4. 72 (2. 28 to 9. 20), giving an attributable proportion of 0. 77 %. The discordant tumor site that was associated with kidney cancer between two generations was hemangioblastoma of central nervous system.

40|$|The {{assessment}} of the β-cell mass in experimental models of diabetes and ultimately in patients is a hallmark to {{understand the relationship between}} reduced β-cell mass/function and the onset of diabetes. It has been shown before that the GLUT- 2 transporter is highly expressed in both β-cells and hepatocytes and that D-mannoheptulose (DMH) has high uptake specificity for the GLUT- 2 transporter. As 19 -fluorine MRI has emerged as a new alternative method for MRI cell tracking because it provides potential non-invasive localization and quantification of labeled cells, the purpose of this project is to validate β-cell and pancreatic islet imaging by using fluorinated, GLUT- 2 targeting mannoheptulose derivatives (19 FMH) both in vivo and ex vivo. In this study, we confirmed that, similar to DMH, 19 FMHs inhibit insulin secretion and increase the blood glucose level in mice temporarily (approximately two hours). We were able to assess the distribution of 19 FMHs in vivo with a temporal resolution of about 20 minutes, which showed a quick removal of 19 FMH from the circulation (within two hours). Ex vivo MR spectroscopy confirmed a preferential uptake of 19 FMH in tissue with high expression of the GLUT- 2 transporter, such as liver, <b>endocrine</b> pancreas and <b>kidney.</b> No indication of further metabolism was found. In summary, 19 FMHs are potentially suitable for visualizing and tracking of GLUT- 2 expressed cells. However, current bottlenecks of this technique related to the quick clearance of the compound and relative low sensitivity of 19 F MRI need to be overcome. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

40|$|During {{the nineties}} {{of the past}} century, several authors underscored the {{necessity}} of measuring blood pressure during a regular clinical examination of veterinary patients, because hypertension occurs as an accessory symptom {{in the course of}} diseased conditions. In addition to blood pressure measurements, most authors believe that it is necessary also to examine intraocular pressure, like in human medicine. Hypertension can be defined as a chronic increase of the systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Systemic blood pressure is proportionate to the heart rate and total peripheral resistance, while physiological control depends on the reninangiotensin system, aldosterone, prostaglandin, adrenergic and neurogenic factors. Some other factors can also have an influence on the measured values of blood pressure (such as age, sex, race, temperament, environment, and, in part, also how and where the pressure measurement was taken). It has been generally accepted in veterinary medicine than an animal can be considered hypertensive if the measured systolic/diastolic pressures are higher than 180 / 100 mm Hg. Hypertension can be primary (sometimes also defined as essential or idiopathic) when it is a consequence of several factors which include heart, neurological, <b>kidney,</b> <b>endocrine,</b> and metabolic aspects. Hypertension is defined as secondary when it occurs as a consequence of certain chronic disorders (such as hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, hyperadrenocorticism, pheochromocytoma, and diabetes mellitus). Blood pressure can be measured in animals using direct or indirect methods. The oscilometric and the ultrasonographic methods are equally used in the world today. Following detailed studies by large numbers of authors, the physiological frameworks of blood pressure in animals have been precisely determined.

40|$|Stanniocalcin- 1 (STC 1) is an {{endocrine}} hormone originally {{discovered in the}} corpuscles of Stannius, <b>endocrine</b> glands on <b>kidneys</b> of bony fishes, and also has been identified in mammals. The mammalian STC 1 gene is widely expressed in various tissues {{and appears to be}} involved in diverse biological processes. There is growing evidence to suggest that altered patterns of gene expression have a role in human cancer development. Recently STC 1 has been identified as a stimulator of mitochondrial respiration and has been hypothesized to be functionally related to the Warburg effect, of which hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) - 1 {{plays a key role in}} reprogramming tumor metabolism. This prompted us to examine the involvement of HIF- 1 in the regulation of STC 1 expression in tumor hypoxia. Our data reveal that hypoxia can stimulate STC 1 gene expression in various human cancer cell lines, including those derived from colon carcinomas, nasopharyngeal cancer (CNE- 2, HONE- 1, HK- 1), and ovarian cancer (CaOV 3, OVCAR 3, SKOV 3). By far, the greatest response was observed in CNE- 2 cells. In further studies on CNE- 2 cells, desferrioxamine, cobalt chloride, and O 2 depletion all increased HIF- 1 α protein and STC 1 mRNA levels. Desferrioxamine treatment, when coupled with Fe replenishment, abolished these effects. RNA interference studies further confirmed that endogenous HIF- 1 α was a key factor in hypoxia-induced STC 1 expression. The ability of vascular endothelial growth factor to stimulate STC 1 expression in CNE- 2 cells was comparatively low. Collectively, the present findings provide the first evidence of HIF- 1 regulation of STC 1 expression in human cancer cells. The studies have implications as to the role of STC 1 in hypoxia induced adaptive responses in tumor cells. Copyright © 2005 by The Endocrine Society. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Millions {{of pounds}} of polychlorinated {{biphenyl}} (PCB) compounds have been produced in multiple countries for industrial applications {{over the last several}} decades. PCB exposure induces various adverse health effects in animals and humans. Environmental and occupational exposures to PCBs have been associated with liver, <b>kidney,</b> <b>endocrine,</b> and neurodevelopmental adverse effects. We have collected and reviewed animal and human data cited in the US National Library of Medicine from 2000 to 2010. In brief, our review shows new evidence, that is, in animal studies, exposure to one of the PCBs, A 1221, induces a significant alteration of serum luteinizing hormone. The effects were more profound in the F 2 generation, particularly with respect to fluctuations in hormones and reproductive tract tissues across the estrous cycle. Morphological analyses of brain tissue from rats exposed to A 1254 confirmed the results of an earlier work which showed that the relative size of the intra- and infrapyramidal (II-P) mossy fibers was smaller than that in the controls and also reduction in growth was selective for the II-P mossy fibers. PCB exposure increased anogenital distance and prostate size but decreased epididymal weight, epididymal sperm count, and motile epididymal sperm count. No effects were observed on testicular weight or size. The epidemiological data showed an association between diabetes mellitus prevalence and elevated concentrations of PCB 153. Additionally, prenatal PCB exposure studies were associated with a smaller thymic index at birth and could adversely affect immune responses to childhood vaccinations and resistance to respiratory infections. PCB exposure was also reported to adversely affect enamel development in children in a dose-dependent manner. Because PCBs and their metabolites are potential health hazards, understanding the risk factors associated with individual PCBs, PCB mixtures, and PCB metabolites is important. PCB exposures of vulnerable populations (pregnant women, fetuses, infants, and children) are of particular concern because of heightened sensitivity during this period of brain development.

Biliary glycoprotein (Bgp) isoforms {{play a role in}} cell adhesion, bile acid transport, and ecto-ATPase activity. MHV-resistant SJL/J mice express a different allele of Bgp 1 called Bgp 1 b. Analysis of the tissue and cellular distribution of Bgp 1 proteins can therefore provide new insight on both cellular functions and MHV-A 59 [...] induced pathogenesis. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Bgp 1 expression was analyzed in the digestive, respiratory, endocrine, urinary, and central nervous systems of adult BALB/c and SJL/J mice by immunocytochemistry and immunoelectron microscopy using a monoclonal Ab specific for the N-terminal domain of the Bgp 1 a proteins and polyclonal rabbit anti-Bgp 1, which recognizes both the Bgp 1 a and Bgp 1 b proteins. The function of Bgp 1 proteins as viral receptors was tested on tissue sections by a virus binding assay. MHV-A 59 replication was analyzed by immunocytochemistry. RESULTS: Bgp 1 expression was observed on membranes of epithelial cells (including hepatocytes, intestinal, endocrine, and respiratory epithelial cells), kidney proximal tubules, and endothelial cells in many tissues. It was usually localized at the apical pole of the cells and, when present, on the brush borders and the cilia. A new direct virus binding assay showed that MHV attachment onto cells correlates with Bgp 1 expression. Viral infection was detected in hepatocytes, lymphoid tissue, and the exocrine pancreas but not in <b>endocrine</b> cells, enterocytes, <b>kidney,</b> or respiratory cells. In the central nervous system, no immunolabeling of neurons or glial cells was found with anti-Bgp 1 Ab. CONCLUSIONS: Bgp 1 proteins are present on BALB/c and SJL/J epithelia and endothelia. These glycoproteins might be involved in cell-to-cell contacts, for example between hepatocytes. On BALB/c mice, Bgp 1 a expression is consistent with the tropism of MHV-A 59 for the liver. However, Bgp 1 a was also expressed on cells that were not infected by MHV-A 59...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis review {{concentrates}} on the characteristics and functionality of endocrine neurons in the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system, coexpressing two peptides, vasopressin and apelin. Vasopressin is synthesized in the soma of magnocellular neurons, then packaged in granules with its respective receptors. In these neurons, apelin is generated from a larger precursor proapelin and is detected in vesicles, some of them colocalize with vasopressin, for others there is a marked segregation of apelin and vasopressin immunoreactivity along the hypothalamo-hypophyseal axons. Furthermore, apelin receptors, like V 1 a-type and V 1 b-type vasopressin receptors, are synthesized by magnocellular vasopressin neurons. In lactating rodents, apelin given intracerebroventricularly inhibited the phasic electrical activity of vasopressin neurons, reduced plasma vasopressin levels and increased aqueous diuresis, showing that apelin acts as a potent diuretic neuropeptide, counteracting vasopressin actions through inhibition of vasopressin neuron activity and vasopressin release. Moreover, in response to potent physiological stimuli known to evoke increased phasic activity of vasopressin neurons (hyper-osmolarity like during dehydration), both the soma dendrites and neurohypophysial terminals loose their dense staining quality, and vasopressin is released by (i) dendrites in the extracellular space to optimize the characteristic phasic activity necessary to a sustained release of vasopressin and (ii) by terminals in blood circulation where vasopressin then ensures its main <b>endocrine</b> actions at <b>kidney</b> level (antidiuretic effect). Conversely, apelin accumulates in these neurons rather than being released into the bloodstream and probably into the nuclei. Thus, decreases in the local supply of apelin to magnocellular vasopressin cell bodies may facilitate the expression by vasopressin neurons of an optimized phasic activity, by decreasing the inhibitory actions of apelin on these neurons. Antagonistic regulation of apelin and vasopressin has a biological purpose, {{making it possible to}} maintain the water balance of the organism by preventing additional water loss via kidneys. This reveals a new physiological concept of dual and opposite functional potentiality for endocrine neurons coexpressing different neuropeptides in separate vesicles: depending on the degree of their electrical activation/inhibition, neurons release selectively the very coexpressed peptides that will ensure its accurate endocrine functions in perfect accordance with the hormonal demand...|$|R
40|$|Aim: Therapy with beta-emitter {{labelled}} 90 Y- or 177 Lu-DOTATOC is {{a promising}} option {{for treatment of}} gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NET). However, some patients become refractory to treatment with beta emitters. The alpha emitter 213 Bi has demonstrated the capability to break radioresistance to beta-radiation in vitro; we report a method for the synthesis of 213 Bi-DOTATOC in clinical levels and give an interim analysis of an ongoing dose escalation study assessing the toxicity and efficacy of intraarterially administered 213 Bi-DOTATOC. Methods: 213 Bi-DOTATOC was synthesized using a microwave assisted labeling protocol; quality control was performed using ITLC and Radio-HPLC. 17 GEP-NET patients, refractory to previous treatment with 90 Y-/ 177 Lu-DOTATOC, were enrolled. The activity administered during a single treatment cycle was escalated from 1 - 10 GBq and the cumulative activity administered was up to 20 GBq 213 Bi per patient. Response was assessed with contrast enhanced sonography, MRI, DSA, 68 Ga-DOTATOC-PET/CT and tumor markers. Markers for hematologic, <b>kidney</b> and <b>endocrine</b> toxicity were monitored initially, interim and following the final treatment. Results: The labeling protocol allowed reliable synthesis of 213 Bi-DOTATOC at doses up to 1. 5 GBq with specific activities up to 240 MBq/nmol and radiochemical purity of 99. 7 ± 0. 3 %. No acute <b>kidney,</b> <b>endocrine</b> or hematologic toxicity higher than grade 0 /I were observed after administration of ≤ 6 GBq per cycle. Moderate hair loss occurred in 3 out of 6 patients receiving single doses of 6 to 10 GBq; 1 case of radiation pneumonitis was observed in the patient receiving 10 GBq. While morphologic long term response is still pending, shrinkage of primary tumors as well as liver and bone metastases has already been observed. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that 213 Bi-DOTATOC can be reliably synthesized in clinical settings. The maximum tolerable dose of a single administration of 213 Bi-DOTATOC has been determined as 6 GBq. Therapeutic effects have been observed in several patients refractory to treatment with beta emitters. Peptide receptor alpha therapy with 213 Bi-DOTATOC is a new treatment option for GEP-NET patients refractory to standard therapies. JRC. E. 5 -Nuclear chemistr...|$|R
