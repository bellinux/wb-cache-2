By various subsets of dermatoglyphic variables (23 and 20 digital, 15 and 14 palmar, 4 summary traits) MANOVA revealed high intergroup heterogeneity among the groups of both sexes and within each sex. In the latter case the males are an exception when 15 and 14 (MLI removed) palmar variables are used. Standard discriminant analysis of the 23 <b>digital</b> <b>variables,</b> i. e. the radial and ulnar ridge counts {{on each of the}} 10 fingers plus total finger ridge count (TFRC), absolute finger ridge count (AFRC) and pattern intensity (PI), resulted in imperfect separation of males and females and an unclear picture of the biological relationships among the groups. In contrast, standard discriminant analysis of 20 <b>digital</b> <b>variables</b> (TFRC, AFRC and PI were removed from the analysis) resulted in separation of the sexes and a pattern of relationships among the populations consistent with their ethno-historical backgrounds. Standard discriminant analysis of 15 palmar dermatoglyphic variables failed to provide separation of the sexes and produced a pattern of relationships in disagreement with both the linguistic and ethno-historical backgrounds, even removing MLI (Main Line Index). Standard discriminant analysis of 4 summary dermatoglyphic variables (TFRC, AFRC, PI and MLI) yielded imperfect separation of males and females and an unclear pattern of relationships.

40|$|In this thesis, novel analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog {{generalized}} time-interleaved variable bandpass sigma-delta modulators are designed, analysed, {{evaluated and}} implemented that {{are suitable for}} high performance data conversion for a broad-spectrum of applications. These generalized time-interleaved variable bandpass sigma-delta modulators can perform noise-shaping for any centre frequency from DC to Nyquist. The proposed topologies are well-suited for Butterworth, Chebyshev, inverse-Chebyshev and elliptical filters, where designers have the flexibility of specifying the centre frequency, bandwidth {{as well as the}} passband and stopband attenuation parameters. The application of the time-interleaving approach, in combination with these bandpass loop-filters, not only overcomes the limitations that are associated with conventional and mid-band resonator-based bandpass sigma-delta modulators, but also offers an elegant means to increase the conversion bandwidth, thereby relaxing the need to use faster or higher-order sigma-delta modulators. A step-by-step design technique has been developed for the design of time-interleaved variable bandpass sigma-delta modulators. Using this technique, an assortment of lower- and higher-order single- and multi-path generalized A/D variable bandpass sigma-delta modulators were designed, evaluated and compared in terms of their signal-to-noise ratios, hardware complexity, stability, tonality and sensitivity for ideal and non-ideal topologies. Extensive behavioural-level simulations verified that one of the proposed topologies not only used fewer coefficients but also exhibited greater robustness to non-idealties. Furthermore, second-, fourth- and sixth-order single- and multi-path <b>digital</b> <b>variable</b> bandpass digital sigma-delta modulators are designed using this technique. The mathematical modelling and evaluation of tones caused by the finite wordlengths of these digital multi-path sigmadelta modulators, when excited by sinusoidal input signals, are also derived from first principles and verified using simulation and experimental results. The fourth-order digital variable-band sigma-delta modulator topologies are implemented in VHDL and synthesized on Xilinx® SpartanTM- 3 Development Kit using fixed-point arithmetic. Circuit outputs were taken via RS 232 connection provided on the FPGA board and evaluated using MATLAB routines developed by the author. These routines included the decimation process as well. The experiments undertaken by the author further validated the design methodology presented in the work. In addition, a novel tunable and reconfigurable second-order variable bandpass sigma-delta modulator has been designed and evaluated at the behavioural-level. This topology offers a flexible set of choices for designers and can operate either in single- or dual-mode enabling multi-band implementations on a single <b>digital</b> <b>variable</b> bandpass sigma-delta modulator.

40|$|Abstract — Digital filters {{capable of}} {{changing}} their frequency response characteristics are {{often referred to}} as <b>variable</b> <b>digital</b> filters (VDF’s) and have been found useful in a number of digital signal processing applications. An important class of VDF’s is the class of <b>digital</b> filters with <b>variable</b> fractional delay. This paper describes an enhanced weighted least-squares design for variable-fractional-delay finite-impulse response filters, which offers improved performance of the filters obtained with considerably reduced computational complexity compared to a recently proposed weighted least-squares (WLS) design method. The design enhancement is achieved by deriving a closed-form formula for evaluating the WLS objective function. The formula facilitates accurate and efficient function evaluations as compared to summing up a large number of discrete terms, which would be time consuming and inevitably introduce additional errors into the design.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} closed-form {{weighted}} least-squares solution for designing variable two-dimensional (2 -D) finite-impulse response (FIR) digital filters with continuously variable 2 -D fractional delay responses. First, the coefficients of the variable 2 -D transfer function {{are represented by}} using the polynomials {{of a pair of}} fractional delays (1 2). Then the weighted squared-error function of the variable 2 -D frequency response is derived without sampling the two frequencies (1 2) and two fractional delays (1 2), which leads to a significant reduction in computational complexity. With the assumption that the overall weighting function is separable and stepwise, the design problem is reduced to the minimization of the weighted squared-error function. Based on the error function, the closed-form optimal solutions for the coefficient matrices of the variable 2 -D transfer function can be determined through solving a pair of matrix equations. In addition, Cholesky decomposition is applied to the final closed-form expressions in order to avoid some numerical instability problem. An example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design method.

30|$|The {{apparatus}} {{necessary to}} measure the absolute P_de cannot fit in the cooling chamber; consequently, we measure P_de relative to a reference by sending diverging weak coherent pulses (WCPs) {{from the end of}} a fiber onto the APDs. Each APD’s active area is sufficiently small that it receives approximately uniformly distributed light intensity, despite the overall Gaussian profile of the incident optical mode. We use a 780  nm laser LD 3 (PicoQuant LDH 8 - 1) as the WCP source, pulsed at 40  MHz with full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 188  ps. The laser pulses are split by a 50 : 50 fiber beamsplitter (Thorlabs FC 780 - 50 B-FC). One output port is connected to a <b>digital</b> <b>variable</b> attenuator (OZ Optics DA- 100 - 35 - 770 / 830 / 850 - 5 / 125 - 5 - 40 -LL) and sends the laser pulses through a fiber to the APDs placed inside the cooling chamber. The other output port is connected to an optical-to-electrical converter (LeCroy OE 455, DC- 3.5  GHz) and the oscilloscope. Having oscilloscope access to both input laser pulses and output avalanche pulses allows us to measure Δ t_jitter (which requires using a pulsed laser, as opposed to continuous-wave such as LD 1).|$|E

30|$|Our setup {{consists}} of a single-mode (SM) continuous-wave 808  nm signal laser (QPhotonics QFLD- 808 - 100 S), and one multi-mode (MM) 0 - 30  W continuous-wave 808  nm annealing laser LD 2 (Jenoptik JOLD- 30 -FC- 12). The 808  nm wavelength is selected for the annealing laser to ensure that APDs fully absorb photons in the depletion region and generate heat energy. Typical depletion region thickness of thick-junction silicon APDs is 20 - 150 μm [38]. At 300  K, if the wavelength is too long (> 1, 100 nm), the APDs transmit most photons. If the wavelength is too short (< 500 nm), most photons are absorbed only at {{the surface of the}} APDs [39]. Absorption depth of 808  nm photons, at which the light intensity has fallen to 1 /e of the initial value, is ∼ 10 μm [39]. The pigtail of the signal laser LD 1 is connected to a 90 : 10 fiber beamsplitter (Thorlabs FC 780 - 90 B FC). One output port is connected to a power meter (PM 1; OZ Optics POM- 300 -VIS), while the other output port is connected to two attenuators in series: a screw attenuator reduces laser power to the nW range, and a <b>digital</b> <b>variable</b> attenuator (OZ Optics DA- 100 - 35 - 770 / 830 / 850 - 5 / 125 - 5 - 40 -LL) then brings laser illumination down to the single-photon level.

It then goes through 90 : 10 (reflection:transmission) non-polarizing beamsplitter (Thorlabs BS 029 90 : 10), a mechanical shutter (Thorlabs SH 05 with Thorlabs SC 10 controller), a focusing lens (Thorlabs C 220 TME-B), and reaches the APD.|$|E
