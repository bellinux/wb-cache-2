Nya Gamla Ullevi will be only the second Swedish top league stadium built since 1966, after Borås Arena that was opened in 2005.|$|E

500|$|Anderson's strong {{performance}} in {{his rookie season}} helped him participate in a three-day tryout for the NBA's Indiana Pacers in June 2008. He expected {{to take part in}} the team's training camp, but a trade involving Jarrett Jack and T. J. Ford led him to never receive the invite. On August 9, 2008, Anderson signed a contract with AEK Larnaca B.C. of the Cyprus Basketball Division 1. He finished the season averaging 17.8 points, 4.0 rebounds, and 4.2 assists, with the second-most assists in the league and the most points. In an interview with SLAM Online, Anderson said, [...] "It was very good competition. It's <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>when</b> you see European guys in the NBA. There are a lot of skilled and crafty players, not overly athletic but very skilled." [...] He played against players such as Bradley Buckman while in Cyprus. After the season concluded, Eurobasket.com named Anderson 2nd Team All-Cyprus League.|$|E

When Leslie asks whether he thinks the park will ever be made, a pragmatic Mark says it will be a difficult process with a lot of red tape, but she remains optimistic. During a fight, Andy admits to Ann that he postponed having the casts removed, but explains it was because, [...] "I really, really like it when you serve me food." [...] Ann throws him out, and Andy sees Mark kiss Leslie. Leslie stops his advances because she does not want to move forward when he is drunk. As Mark starts to leave, he falls into the pit. An amused Andy tells Ann, who rushes out to help him while Andy goes back inside and watches television.|$|E

During filming of the scene, it was reported widely among media sources after {{a fan of the}} series had snuck their way onto a nearby mountain and filmed {{a small portion of the}} fighting scenes that occurred. Robert Aramayo (young Eddard Stark) spoke about the filming of the scene in an interview following the airing of the episode and stated, [...] "We all went through a bunch of training, which continued through our three- or four-day shoot in Spain. It was intense. It was not easy. I did not find it easy to shoot that fight sequence. It's not an easy routine at all. And Luke Roberts, who plays Arther Dayne, he's incredible, man."

2500|$|Whereby {{religion}} is an institutional mechanism, spirituality {{is a personal}} one. Unlike religion, spirituality cannot be abandoned or switched. It is an integral component of one's consciousness. Womanist spirituality has six identifying characteristics—it is eclectic, synthetic, holistic, personal, visionary, and pragmatic. It draws from its resources and uses the summation of said resources to create a whole from multiple parts. Although it is ultimately defined by self, it envisions the larger picture and exists to solve problems and end injustice. Emilie Townes, a womanist theologian, further asserts that womanist spirituality grows out of individual and communal reflection on African American faith and life. She explains {{that it is not}} grounded in the notion that spirituality is a force but rather a practice separate from who we are moment by moment." [...] In a blaze of glory: womanist spirituality as social witness. Nashville: Abingdon Press. One of the main characteristics of womanism is its religious aspect, commonly thought of as Christian. This connotation paints the picture of spiritual black womanists being [...] "church going" [...] women that {{play a vital role in}} the operation of the church. In William's article Womanist Spirituality Defined she discusses how womanist spirituality is directly connected to an individual's experiences with God. For instance, Williams declares, [...] "the use of the term spirituality in this paper speaks of the everyday experiences of life and the way in which we relate to and interpret God at work in those experiences". However, this connotation is disputed in Monica Coleman's Roundtable Discussion: [...] "Must I Be a Womanist?" [...] where she focuses on the shortcomings of womanism that result from how individuals have historically described womanism. This holistic discussion of womanism is the result of a roundtable discussion. Coleman, who initiated the discussion, describes her thoughts on why she prefers black feminism as opposed to womanism, and she also discusses the limited scope that womanist religious scholarship embodies. Coleman offers deep insight into the spiritual aspect of womanism when she declares that, [...] "Intentionally or not, womanists have created a Christian hegemonic discourse within the field". Here Coleman explains that the majority of womanists have painted the spiritual aspect of womanism to be spiritual in terms of Christianity. A specific example of this occurs in Walker's [...] "Everyday Use", in the instance when the mother suddenly gains the courage to take a stand against her spoiled daughter as she declares, [...] "When I looked at her like that something hit me in the top of my head and ran down to the soles of my feet. <b>Just</b> <b>like</b> <b>when</b> I'm in church and the spirit of God touches me and I get happy and shout". This could be categorized as an example of the spiritual aspect of womanism because of the mention of relation to the Christian God. However, Coleman provides a counter example to this assumption when she states: [...] "How, for example, might a womanist interpret the strength Tina Turner finds in Buddhism and the role her faith played in helping her to leave a violent relationship?" [...] Here Coleman pokes a hole in the pre-conceived notions of womanist scholarship. Coleman believes that the notorious sector of spirituality that womanism is most known for referring to is limited in its scope. Womanist religious scholarship has the ability to spread across a variety of paradigms and represent and support radical womanist spirituality. Considering womanism as a whole, it is also important to understand how it relates to feminism.|$|E
