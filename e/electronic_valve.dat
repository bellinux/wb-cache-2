2500|$|In 1906, Lee de Forest {{invented the}} triode <b>electronic</b> <b>valve.</b> In 1915 he invented the first vacuum tube instrument, the audio piano. Then, until the {{invention}} of the transistor, the vacuum tube was an essential component in electric instruments. In 1935, the Hammond organ was introduced, exploiting previous limited production efforts like the [...] from 1923. It was capable of producing polyphonic sounds by virtue of a spinning shaft with many magnetic 'lobes' which would cycle past an electromagnetic pickup at a rate that would produce each desired tone. [...] "Tone Wheel Organ" [...] is the general name for this technology. The Hammond organ was connected to a power amplifier and a speaker cabinet. In 1929, the electric piano was invented. In 1939, Hammond introduced the Novachord which used about 170 vacuum tubes, coils, capacitors and resistors largely to create an upper octave of notes and then divide them in half using 'flip flop' circuits to create successively lower octaves from each note. But the instrument also has many features like envelopes for filter and amplifiers so that sounds can be contoured at the user's discretion, making it the first production analog synthesizer.|$|E

In {{this case the}} pressure control consisted {{of a set of}} <b>electronic</b> <b>valves</b> and <b>electronic</b> pressure regulators to provide three pressures that were previously provided by a technician (high pressure 800-1000mbar, low pressure 20-30mbar, and a small vacuum 15-150mbar). Three <b>electronic</b> <b>valves</b> switched between the three pressures and atmospheric pressure. The high pressure was used to prevent clogging the pipette, the low pressure was used when searching for cells, and the vacuum was used to help the gigasealing process.

40|$|In recent years, {{the use of}} <b>electronic</b> {{throttle}} <b>valve</b> {{systems has}} been very popular in the automotive industry. It is used to regulate the amount of air flow into the engine. Due {{to the existence of}} multiple nonsmooth nonlinearities, the controller design to the <b>electronic</b> throttle <b>valve</b> becomes difficult task. These nonlinearities including stick–slip friction, backlash, and a discontinuous nonlinear spring involved in the system. In {{the first part of this}} paper the <b>electronic</b> throttle <b>valve</b> system is presented first, and then the model is derived for each components of the throttle valve system. Later, the system dimension is reduced to two by ignoring the motor inductance at the end of this part of work. Actually this step enables us to design a nonlinear PID controller <b>electronic</b> throttle <b>valve</b> system. The simulation results, of applying a nonlinear PID controller to the <b>electronic</b> throttle <b>valve</b> system, show the effectiveness of the proposed controller in forcing the angle of the throttle valve to the desired opening angle in presence of nonlinearities and disturbances in throttle valve system model...|$|R

5000|$|Once {{more fully}} developed, <b>electronic</b> <b>valve</b> {{operation}} will yield even more benefits. Cylinder deactivation, for instance, {{could be made}} much more fuel efficient if the intake valve could be opened on every downstroke and the exhaust valve opened on every upstroke of the deactivated cylinder or [...] "dead hole". Another even more significant advancement will be {{the elimination of the}} conventional throttle. When a car is run at part throttle, this interruption in the airflow causes excess vacuum, which causes the engine to use up valuable energy acting as a vacuum pump. BMW attempted to get around this on their V-10 powered M5, which had individual throttle butterflies for each cylinder, placed just before the intake valves. With <b>electronic</b> <b>valve</b> operation, {{it will be possible to}} control engine speed by regulating valve lift. At part throttle, when less air and gas are needed, the valve lift would not be as great. Full throttle is achieved when the gas pedal is depressed, sending an electronic signal to the ECU, which in turn regulates the lift of each valve event, and opens it all the way up.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{method to}} {{determine}} the condensing temperature set point of air-cooled refrigeration system with an <b>electronic</b> expansion <b>valve</b> was discussed in this paper. This set point is fixed for a specific system {{and is based on}} the flow characteristic of the installed <b>electronic</b> expansion <b>valve</b> in variant opening and pressure drop. As common sense, at constant differential between condensing pressure and evaporating pressure, larger opening of expansion valve allows more refrigerant flowing through the expansion valve into evaporator. This feature offers an opportunity to lower the condensing temperature via increasing opening of expansion valve to enhance refrigeration efficiency and in the same time designed cooling capacity can be maintained at low ambient temperature. In this case it is supposed that the installed <b>electronic</b> expansion <b>valve’s</b> capacity was larger than the evaporator’s, and in fact that occurs frequently in refrigeration system designing. The benefits of this method could include: the capacity of <b>electronic</b> expansion <b>valve</b> is fully utilized, the refrigeration system will operate at a lower condensing pressure and the power consumption of compressor can decrease, hence the improvement of system efficiency is predictable...|$|R

50|$|A similar {{device is}} the {{vibrator}} power supply, used to power <b>electronic</b> <b>valve</b> radios from low-voltage batteries. Low voltage DC from the battery is chopped by a trembler circuit and this pulsed square wave {{used to drive}} a transformer, providing the 90V or so required by valves.
