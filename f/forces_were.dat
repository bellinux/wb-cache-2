M20 {{recoilless}} rifles destroyed the machine gun positions, and American mortars began firing on any North Korean positions they could locate. However, North Korean <b>forces</b> <b>were</b> quick to advance up the Notch, to {{the crest of the}} hill that made up the pass. There, the discovered B Company, 19th Infantry, encamped. The 19th Infantry was apparently not prepared for combat, as North Korean <b>forces</b> <b>were</b> able to hit the American force and drive it off the hill, killing several of the American soldiers with bayonets. At about 12:00, B Company was driven from the crest of the Notch, and further confusion erupted when US Air Force aircraft accidentally strafed the retreating B Company. Neighboring positions also mistakenly attacked B Company, which retreated with 12 killed.|$|E

5000|$|President Ronald Reagan in 1985 said [...] "the <b>Force</b> <b>is</b> with us", {{referring}} to the United States, to create the Strategic Defense Initiative. The Gospel According to Star Wars asserts that {{his use of the}} phrase was actually perverting Star Wars's [...] "self-dispossessing" [...] (or other-focused) ethos. The blessing [...] "May the <b>Force</b> <b>be</b> with you" [...] is the expression of a hope for others ("May the <b>Force</b> <b>be</b> with you"), not for ourselves as with Reagan ("The <b>Force</b> <b>is</b> with us"). Moreover, the Star Wars blessing is precisely a request for hope for others ("May the <b>Force</b> <b>be</b> with you"), whereas Reagan's claim sounds like a possessive assertion ("The <b>Force</b> <b>is</b> with us").|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Based on the {{deflection}} effect {{resulted from}} deformation, a new experiment device {{for measuring the}} jet impact force of laser cavity is developed. The device {{has been used in}} experiment and the typical signal of jet impact <b>force</b> <b>was</b> obtained. The variational characteristic of the <b>force</b> with time <b>was</b> given. The result shows that during the experiment the target material sustains three forces. In order of time, the first <b>force</b> <b>is</b> the laser ablation force, and the other two <b>forces</b> <b>are</b> jet impact <b>forces.</b> The first jet impact <b>force</b> <b>is</b> greater than the ablation force and the second jet impact <b>force</b> <b>is</b> smaller than the first jet impact force...|$|R

5|$|As the Chinese Civil War was raging at {{the time}} and Communist <b>forces</b> <b>were</b> attacking river boats {{travelling}} from Chongqing, it was judged necessary to transport the pig bristles from the city by air. The Kuomintang government agreed to allow RAAF and Royal Air Force aircraft to fly return flights between Hong Kong and Chongqing between 1 and 14 May only. After arriving in Hong Kong, the bristles would be shipped to Australia by sea. Both the Kuomintang government and the Communist <b>forces</b> <b>were</b> concerned about the presence of foreigners in China, and the Australian aircrew were warned that they would be imprisoned if they landed anywhere other than Chongqing or an emergency airstrip at Canton.|$|E
5|$|As the {{existing}} militia <b>forces</b> <b>were</b> unable to serve overseas under {{the provisions of}} the Defence Act 1903, an all-volunteer expeditionary force known as the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) was formed and recruitment began on 10 August 1914. The government pledged 20,000 men, organised as one infantry division and one light horse brigade plus supporting units. Enlistment and organisation was primarily regionally based and was undertaken under mobilisation plans drawn up in 1912. The first commander was Major General William Bridges, who also assumed command of the 1st Division. Throughout the course of the conflict Australian efforts were predominantly focused upon the ground war, although small air and naval <b>forces</b> <b>were</b> also committed.|$|E

5|$|Because {{the siege}} did not {{blockade}} the harbor, the city remained {{open for the}} Royal Navy, under Vice Admiral Samuel Graves, to bring in supplies from Nova Scotia and other places. Colonial forces could do little to stop these shipments due to the naval supremacy of the British fleet. Nevertheless, American privateers were able to harass supply ships, and food prices rose quickly. Soon the shortages meant the British <b>forces</b> <b>were</b> on short rations. Generally, the American <b>forces</b> <b>were</b> able to gather information {{about what was happening}} in the city from people escaping the privations of Boston, but General Gage had no effective intelligence of rebel activities.|$|E

50|$|<b>Force</b> <b>is</b> {{the action}} of one body on another. A <b>force</b> <b>is</b> either a push or a pull. A force tends to move a body in the {{direction}} of its action.

Thus, <b>force</b> <b>is</b> a vector quantity, because its effect depends on the direction {{as well as on the}} magnitude of the action.|$|R

However {{they were unable}} to hold it because of US air superiority and naval {{bombardment}} on the town. The North Korean supply chain had completely broken down and more food, ammunition, and supplies were not available. UN forces began their final counteroffensive against the stalled North Korean forces on August 15. Intense fighting around P'ohang-dong ensued for several days as each side suffered large numbers of casualties in back-and-forth battles. By August 17, UN <b>forces</b> <b>were</b> able to push North Korean troops out of the Kyongju and An'gang-ni areas, putting the supply road to Taegu out of immediate danger. By August 19 the North Korean forces had completely withdrawn from the offensive.|$|E

The Rwandan forces in the area were taken by surprise and were mostly unable to defend against the invasion, although the Rwandan police and army did succeed for a while in repelling the invasion in some areas, killing a number of rebel fighters in the process. It is likely the FAR <b>forces</b> <b>were</b> assisted by French troops, as the French government later rewarded around fifteen French paratroopers for having taken part in the rearguard.

50|$|A contact <b>force</b> <b>is</b> any <b>force</b> that {{requires}} contact to <b>be</b> enforced. Contact <b>forces</b> <b>are</b> also direct <b>forces.</b> Contact <b>forces</b> <b>are</b> ubiquitous (present, appearing, or found everywhere) and {{are responsible for}} most visible interactions between macroscopic (visible to the naked eye; not microscopic) collections of matter. Pushing a car up a hill or kicking a ball or pushing a desk across a room {{are some of the}} everyday examples where contact <b>forces</b> <b>are</b> at work. In the first case the <b>force</b> <b>is</b> continuously applied by the person on the car, while in the second case the <b>force</b> <b>is</b> delivered in a short impulse. Certain contact forces describe specific phenomena and are important enough to have been given unique names. The most common instances of this include friction, normal force and shear force. A contact <b>force</b> may also <b>be</b> described as the push experienced when two objects are pressed together.|$|R
