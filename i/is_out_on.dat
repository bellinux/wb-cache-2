25|$|Jake {{runs into}} a man named Bill outside a coffee shop, not realizing that this man is Sarah's father. When Jake confesses that he is heartbroken, Bill {{mentions}} {{that he has a}} daughter who is single but Jake declines. While drinking coffee with Sarah later, Bill quotes something that Jake said to him and Sarah realizes that Jake was talking about her. She heads over to Jake's with Mother Teresa, but he <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> the lake with his boat. When Jake can't hear her yelling from the shore she convinces a girls crew team to take her out to him. Eventually she dives in and swims over to his boat. After climbing in Sarah tells Jake how she feels about him and they kiss. Later, when telling the story of how they met, they mention in unison that they found each other at a dog park.|$|E
500|$|Tony [...] "le Stéphanois" [...] {{has served}} a five-year prison {{term for a}} jewel heist and <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> the street and down on his luck. His friend Jo {{approaches}} him about a smash-and-grab proposed by mutual friend Mario in which the threesome would cut the glass on a Parisian jeweler's front window in broad daylight and snatch some gems. Tony declines. He then learns that his old girlfriend, Mado, took up in his absence with gangster Parisian nightclub owner Pierre Grutter. Finding Mado working at Grutter's, Tony invites her back to his rundown flat. She is obviously well-kept, and Tony savagely beats her for being so deeply involved with Grutter. Tony changes his mind about the heist; he now accepts {{on the condition that}} they rob the jeweler's safe instead of the window. Mario suggests they employ the services of Italian compatriot César, a safecracker. The four devise and rehearse an ingenious plan to break into the store and disarm its sophisticated alarm system.|$|E
500|$|It {{was this}} concept which {{intrigued}} Madonna, {{while she was}} developing her third studio album True Blue (1986). She said, [...] "I hate it when people do master mixes of my records. I don't want to hear my songs changed like that. I don't know that I like it, people screwing with my records. The jury <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> it for me. But the fans like it, and really, this one was for the fans, for {{the kids in the}} clubs who wanted to hear these songs in a fresh new way." [...] She went to Warner with the idea of releasing her songs by remixing them in a complete dance tune. From Warner's point of view, the rise of remix was a commercial boon, because it meant making more money out of the same piece of music. Instead of paying Madonna to go to studio and record different tracks, they found that allowing her to record the same tracks in different formats was much less costly. Hence they decided to release the album, but gave full freedom to Madonna to choose the producers with whom she wanted to develop the remixes.|$|E

500|$|In 1909, Australian team-mate Trumper {{moved from}} Paddington, a suburb on Sydney's south shore to Chatswood on the {{northern}} side of the harbour, where Macartney lived. Macartney and Trumper played together for Gordon Cricket Club {{on the north shore}} and became close friends. Macartney regularly practised on the Trumper family's backyard turf pitch. Trumper's relocation made more frequent meetings possible, since the Sydney Harbour Bridge was not to open until 1932, and the only way of travelling between either side of the bay was by ferry. Trumper was regarded as the [...] "crown prince of the golden age of cricket", the finest and most stylish batsman of his era, {{and one of the most}} elegant strokemakers of all time. Under Trumper's influence, Macartney became more audacious and adventurous; Unlike their English counterparts, the Australians were proud of their spontaneous play. Macartney revered Trumper as both a cricketer and a person, and was to be a pall bearer when Trumper died in 1915 at the age of 37. However, unlike Trumper, Macartney was known for his habit of [...] "walking", the act of leaving the ground before or contrary to an umpire's decision if a batsman knows that he <b>is</b> <b>out.</b> <b>On</b> one occasion, Macartney felt so guilty that the umpire had incorrectly ruled him not out despite a clear edge that he attempted to throw his wicket away with a wild airborne shot. However, the ball went for six, and Trumper, his batting partner at the time, admonished him, saying that his good luck would be balanced by occasions when the umpire would give him out incorrectly.|$|E
500|$|Age of Empires III, {{released}} on October 18, 2005, {{was built on}} an improved version of the Age of Mythology game engine with the most significant changes being the updated graphics engine and {{the inclusion of the}} Havok physics middleware engine. The game is set in the period between 1421 and 1850, and players can choose one of eight European nations. The game introduced a large number of features, such as home cities. Described by Ensemble Studios as [...] "an important support system to your efforts in the New World," [...] home cities helped provide the player with resources, equipment, troops, and upgrades. They could be used across multiple games, and upgraded after each battle; it was compared to a role-playing game character by Ensemble Studios. The first expansion to Age of Empires III, The WarChiefs, was released October 17, 2006. Most gameplay changes in the expansion pack were small, but it introduced three new civilizations, with a focus on Native Americans. Most notable was the introduction of the [...] unit. The second expansion, The Asian Dynasties, went on sale October 23, 2007. It was a jointly developed product; Big Huge Games helped Ensemble Studios develop the game, with Brian Reynolds joining Bruce Shelley as lead designer. The game expanded the Age of Empires III universe into Asia, and introduced three new civilizations. Reception towards Age of Empires III was mixed; Game Revolution described it as [...] "about as much fun" [...] as a history textbook, while GameZone argued it was [...] "one of the best looking games, much less an RTS game, that <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> the market currently". It sold more than two million copies, and won the GameSpy [...] "real-time strategy game of the year" [...] award. The WarChiefs failed to equal the success of its predecessor, with a lower score on both Game Rankings and Metacritic, and The Asian Dynasties score was lower still with 80%.|$|E
500|$|The film {{opens with}} an inter-title that reads [...] "Poor little rich girl has {{no one to}} play with" [...] and cuts to Baby Helen with her doll, looking out the window. A group of {{children}} play Ring a Ring o' Roses in the yard. Next, Baby Helen goes to tea party {{set up on the}} yard and holds her doll, all by herself, with a lonely expression. The neighbor's dog, Shep comes out of his dog house and barks, and Baby Helen rises with a joyful expression. She takes a piece of a muffin and tosses it through the boxwood hedge separating the two yards. Shep eats the muffin and Helen invites him to her tea party. Shep runs along the hedge and passes through to join her. Helen instructs Shep with her finger and Shep barks in understanding, Helen takes her seat and shares a muffin with Shep. An inter-title announces that a week later, Helen <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> an errand. Helen passes through the hedge and skips down the sidewalk and Shep barks at her. As Helen crosses the street, she is struck by a passing automobile and Shep races to the rescue. He tugs at her dress at the waist and finding that he is unable to move her, runs to Helen's home and jumps against the screen door, barking repeatedly. As Helen's parents are summoned, Shep leads them to Helen, where a passerby has scooped up Helen {{from the middle of the}} street. All three depart and the scene changes to a dimly lit room with Helen laid on a bed, seemingly dead. Her parents watch over her, with sad faces as a doctor inspects her and folds her arms across her chest. Beyond saving, her parents bury their heads in the pillow next to Helen as the doctor pens a note. Then Shep is shown resting against the side of the door in a feeble and sorrowful looking position.|$|E

2500|$|Some of the {{innovations}} that NBC has brought for its NHL telecasts include putting a star clock underneath the scoreboard {{at the top}} of the screen. During each game, NBC takes one player from each team and clocks how long that player <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> the ice each time he comes out for a shift. In addition, goalies like Pittsburgh's Marc-Andre Fleury may wear cameras inside their masks, much like Fox asks catchers to do for its Major League Baseball game broadcasts. NBC also puts one of its analysts in-between the two teams' benches for what it calls [...] "Inside the Glass" [...] reporting, which was later emulated by sister network Comcast SportsNet, CBC and TSN. In addition to providing color commentary, this allows the analyst to observe and report on the benches, as well as interviewing the coaches periodically.|$|E
