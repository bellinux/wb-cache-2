When Thompson took office in January 2007, he, along with Diane Savino and Jeffrey Klein (both of whom later {{defected}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> to form {{the core of the}} Independent Democratic Conference), assumed the chairmanship of the New York Democratic Senate Campaign Committee by assuming control of Democratic campaigns development. He retained this position through the 2008 general election.|$|E

Prior to this {{she was a member of}} the Washington House of Representatives. In her first full term, a Majority Coalition Caucus was formed, taking control away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> in the state senate. Rivers was appointed to be majority whip for the session, a rare appointment for a freshman senator.

50|$|Labour gained Morton <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Liberal <b>Democrats,</b> {{defeating}} <b>the</b> Liberal <b>Democrat</b> {{group leader}} Peter Farmer, who {{announced his retirement}} from politics after his defeat. However Labour fell 14 votes short of taking Castle <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Liberal <b>Democrats</b> and lost Botcherby to independent Robert Betton. Meanwhile, the Conservatives gained Dalston <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Liberal <b>Democrats,</b> after <b>the</b> sitting Liberal <b>Democrat</b> councillor Steven Tweedie stepped down at the election.|$|R
50|$|Alexander, also {{an expert}} {{linotype}} operator, {{retired as a}} full-time worker <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> after 50 years in February 1962. His wife, Margaret Smith, whom he married in 1917, died in 1958.|$|R

5|$|In the 1946 elections, Republicans wrested {{control of}} both houses of Congress <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> {{for the first time}} since the Great Depression and gained control of the {{majority}} of state governments. The power of labor unions had expanded under Roosevelt and the Democrats, and when a 1946 railroad worker strike exacerbated a post-war recession the Republican majorities – over Barkley's objection – curbed union power via the Taft–Hartley Act. They also passed the Twenty-second Amendment, limiting the president to two terms, a posthumous slap at Roosevelt.|$|E
5|$|Morehead was {{nominated}} for lieutenant governor at his party's nominating convention in Baltimore, Maryland in 1831, and was elected on a split ticket with Democratic governor John Breathitt. He ascended to the governorship upon Breathitt's death in 1834. Saddled with a shortened term, Morehead {{was not able to}} formulate a significant legislative agenda, and stuck to the politically safe issue of internal improvements during his term. When his party changed its name to the Whig Party and wrested control of the General Assembly <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> in the summer of 1834, Morehead hosted the new party's first nominating convention in Frankfort.|$|E
25|$|In 1865, the 13th Amendment—abolishing slavery—became {{part of the}} Constitution when it was {{ratified}} by three-quarters of the states. Despite protests <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats,</b> the Republican Party made banning slavery part of its national platform in 1864. Senator Lyman Trumbull (R-IL) wrote {{the final version of}} the text, combining the proposed wordings of several other Republican congressmen.|$|E
50|$|Mahachon Party leader Sanan Kachornprasart {{claimed that}} former Democrat {{secretary-general}} Pradit Pattaraprasit {{had decided to}} join Mahachon and contest the election. However, Pradit, who had earlier resigned <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> party, denied Sanan's claim.|$|R

50|$|Sezgin {{was elected}} as the Mayor of Aydın in the 1955 local {{elections}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> Party. He {{was removed from}} office {{as a result of}} the 1960 coup d'état, during which <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> Party government led by Adnan Menderes was ousted from power.

25|$|The Democrats {{gained control}} of the Senate, and had {{complete}} control of Congress, having taken over the House in 1875. Hayes vetoed bills <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> that outlawed the Republican Enforcement Acts; however, with the military underfunded, Hayes could not adequately enforce these laws. Blacks remained involved in Southern politics, particularly in Virginia, which was run by the biracial Readjuster Party.|$|E
25|$|The South has {{produced}} various nationally known politicians and political movements. In 1948, {{a group of}} Democratic congressmen, led by Governor Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, split <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> in reaction to an anti-segregation speech given by Minneapolis mayor and future senator Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota. They founded the States Rights Democratic or Dixiecrat Party. During that year’s Presidential election, the party ran Thurmond as its candidate and he carried four Deep South states.|$|E
25|$|Bob Brown {{had been}} a Senator and the {{informal}} leader of the Australian Greens since 1996. By opposing Australia's participation in the Iraq War he established himself as the most prominent figure of the Australian left. But media predictions that the Greens would greatly increase their vote and win a Senate seat in every state, or even win House seats, were not realised. Although the Greens took some votes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats,</b> many flowed to other parties and the predicted big inroads into Labor's base vote did not occur.|$|E
50|$|The Conservatives gained Bagley <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Liberal <b>Democrats</b> while <b>the</b> Greens gained Porthill, {{its first}} seat on Shrewsbury Town Council, also <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Liberal <b>Democrats.</b> That left Labour with 7 seats, the Conservatives with 6, <b>the</b> Liberal <b>Democrats</b> with 3 and the Green Party with 1.|$|R

25|$|From 2010, {{the airport}} {{received}} state grants of NOK12 million. In February 2010, the Ministry of Transport and the airport {{signed an agreement}} for the grants to continue until at least 2014. Despite this, the airport ran into severe liquidity problems in October, and had to borrow NOK12 million from its owners. This caused the owners to elect a new board, led by Dag Aksnes, former director of Flesland. Local politicians <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> in Norway have proposed closing the airport {{because of the high}} subsidies needed from the municipality. With the Triangle Link being toll-free from 2013, they feel Haugesund Airport will be close enough.|$|E
25|$|The Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2003 was tabled in Parliament; with an Explanatory Memorandum {{circulated}} by Minister. The Minister {{delivered his}} Second Reading Speech on 6 November 2003. In 2004, the Parliamentary Library published {{an analysis of}} the Bill's history. In October 2003 the Senate referred the Bill to the Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee for inquiry and report. The Committee received submissions, conducted hearings, and tabled its Report on 21 June 2004. The Committee, by a majority composed of Senators <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> and Labor, recommended that the Senate oppose the government's legislation. Government senators on the Committee, in minority, recommended that the legislation be passed. Passage of the Bill stalled.|$|E

500|$|On December 16, 1861 Wilson {{introduced}} a bill to abolish slavery in Washington D.C. something he had desired to do since {{his visit to the}} nation's capital 25 years earlier. At this time fugitive slaves from the war were being held in prisons of Washington D.C. and faced the possibility of return to their owners. Wilson said of his bill that it would [...] "blot out slavery forever from the nation's capital". The measure met bitter opposition <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> who remained in the Senate after those from the southern states vacated their seats to join the Confederacy, but it passed. After passage in the House, President Lincoln signed Wilson's bill into law on April 16, 1862.|$|E
500|$|In 1855, Banks {{agreed to}} chair the {{convention}} {{of a new}} Republican Party convention, whose platform was intended to bring together antislavery interests <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats,</b> Whigs, Free Soilers, and Know Nothings. When Know Nothing Governor Henry Gardner refused {{to join in the}} fusion, Banks carefully kept his options open, passively supporting the Republican effort but also avoiding criticism of Gardner in his speeches. Gardner was reelected. [...] During the summer of 1855, Banks was invited to speak at an antislavery rally in Portland, Maine, his first major speaking opportunity outside Massachusetts. [...] In the speech, Banks expressed his opinion that the Union did not necessarily need to be preserved, say that under certain conditions it would be appropriate to [...] "let [...] slide". [...] Future political opponents would repeatedly use these words against him, accusing him of [...] "disunionism".|$|E
500|$|In federal {{elections}} since 2006, {{both parties}} have seen successes. Republican Senator George Allen lost close races in 2006, to Democratic newcomer Jim Webb, and again in 2012, to Webb's replacement, former Governor Tim Kaine. In 2008, Democrats won both United States Senate seats; former Governor Mark Warner was elected to replace retiring Republican John Warner. [...] The state went Republican in 13 out of 14 presidential elections from 1952 to 2004, including 10 in a row from 1968 to 2004. However, Democrat Barack Obama carried Virginia's 13 electoral votes in both the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections. In the 2010 elections, Republicans won three United States House of Representatives seats <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats.</b> Of the state's eleven seats in the House of Representatives, Republicans hold seven and Democrats hold four.

500|$|Rangel's {{dream of}} {{becoming}} chairman of Ways and Means took a tumble with the Republican Revolution of 1994, which {{took control of the}} House away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> {{for the first time in}} decades. [...] He did become the ranking Democrat of the committee in 1996. [...] Rangel was bitterly opposed to the Republican Contract With America, considering it an assault on America's poor, and strongly criticized Democrats such as President Bill Clinton and religious leaders such as John Cardinal O'Connor for perpetuating [...] "the silence of good people" [...] that he likened to what happened in Nazi Germany. [...] When Rangel made a similar allusion directed at new Ways and Means chair Bill Archer in 1995, Archer refused to speak to him for several years except at public meetings. [...] Rangel also strongly opposed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996, accusing Clinton of supporting it for political reasons and predicting its consequences would cast a million children into poverty.|$|E
500|$|Republicans {{remained}} {{in control of}} the House in the 42nd and 43rd Congresses, and Blaine was reelected as Speaker at the start of both of them, for a total term of six years in the Speaker’s chair. His popularity continued to grow, and Republicans dissatisfied with Grant mentioned Blaine as a potential candidate for President in 1872. Instead, Blaine worked steadfastly for Grant’s reelection, which was a success. Blaine’s growing fame brought growing opposition <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats,</b> as well, and during the 1872 campaign he was accused of receiving bribes in the Crédit Mobilier scandal Blaine denied any part in the scandal, which involved railroad companies bribing federal officials to {{turn a blind eye to}} fraudulent railroad contracts that overcharged the government by millions of dollars. No one was able to satisfactorily prove Blaine’s involvement. Though not an absolute defense, it is true that the law that made the fraud possible had been written before he was elected to Congress. [...] But other Republicans were exposed by the accusations, including Vice President Colfax, who was dropped from the ticket at the 1872 Republican National Convention.|$|E
2500|$|After 1968, with {{desegregation}} a settled issue, the Republicans began {{a strategy}} of trying to win conservative Southerners away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> and into the Republican Party. Nonetheless, a bloc of conservative Democrats, mostly Southerners, remained in the United States Congress throughout the 1970s and 1980s. These included Democratic House members as conservative as Larry McDonald, {{who was also a}} leader in the John Birch Society. During the administration of Ronald Reagan, the term [...] "boll weevils" [...] was applied to this bloc of conservative Democrats, who consistently voted in favor of tax cuts, increases in military spending, and deregulation favored by the Reagan administration.|$|E
