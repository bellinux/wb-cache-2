5000|$|The album {{included}} two different photoshoots by David Abdallah, whom Nancy constantly works with. As opposed to her previous typical-photoshoot album covers {{which did not}} achieve satisfaction, this album's was generally Nancy's most liked cover by the public. The cover shoot showed Nancy sitting {{at the back of}} a car, staring mysteriously outside the window, or simply with her eyes closed, appearing to be deep in thought and imagination. The cover came to match the album's theme of change and maturity, as it serves to impose the question of the album title, [...] "Betfakkar Fi Eih" [...] or [...] "What are you thinking about". In the other shoot included in the inlay booklet, Nancy poses in common photoshoot style, with rose petals flying all around her. The three different looks in the shoots and the three different hairstyles in the car shoot were the work of her make-up artist, Fady Kataya, and <b>hair</b> <b>styler,</b> Wasim Morqoss from Pace e Luce, respectively. The album booklet contains full Arabic lyrics to the songs.|$|E
