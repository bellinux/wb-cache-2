In this paper, software elements of this system are described, with an emphasis on components which allow for rapid prototyping and deployment of aircraft control laws. Through model-based design and automatic coding a common code-base is used for desktop analysis, piloted simulation and real-time flight control. The flight control system provides the ability to rapidly integrate and test multiple research control laws and to emulate component or sensor failures. Integrated integrity monitoring systems provide aircraft structural load protection, isolate the system from control algorithm failures, and monitor the health of telemetry streams.

30|$|This paper further {{exploits}} {{the advantage}} of a rotation-free isogeometric approach to the assessment of collapse limit loads of plastic thin plates in bending. The kinematic formulation relies on the displacement (deflection) approximation using NURBS, resulting in both exact geometric representation and high-order approximations. Only <b>deflection</b> <b>degrees</b> of freedom are involved in the underlying optimization problem. This enables us to design the resulting optimization problem with a minimum size and to reduce computational cost. We adopt a simple procedure to eliminate rotational degrees of freedom on essential boundary conditions related to the constraint of normal slopes. The resulting non-smooth optimization problem is then written in the form of minimizing a sum of Euclidean norms {{so that it can be}} solved using highly efficient interior-point solvers. Several numerical examples are provided to show the reliability and accuracy of the present formulation.|$|R

40|$|Freeplay is a {{significant}} source of nonlinearity in aeroelastic systems and is strictly regulated by airworthiness authorities. It splits the phase plane of such systems into three piecewise linear subdomains. Depending on the location of the freeplay, limit cycle oscillations can result that span either two or three of these subdomains. The purpose of this work is to demonstrate the existence of two-domain cycles both theoretically and experimentally. A simple aeroelastic system with pitch, plunge and control <b>deflection</b> <b>degrees</b> of freedom is investigated in the presence of freeplay in pitch. It is shown that two-domain and three-domain cycles can result from a grazing bifurcation and propagate in the decreasing airspeed direction. Close to the bifurcation, the two limit cycle branches interact with each other and aperiodic oscillations ensue. Equivalent linearization is used to derive the conditions of existence of each type of limit cycle and to predict their amplitudes and frequencies. Comparisons with measurements from wind tunnel experiments demonstrate that the theory describes these phenomena with accuracy. Comment: 26 pages, 16 figure...|$|R
40|$|A Balancing Domain Decomposition Method by Constraints (BDDC) is {{constructed}} and analyzed for the Reissner-Mindlin plate bending problem discretized with MITC finite elements. This BDDC algorithm {{is based on}} selecting the plate rotations and <b>deflection</b> <b>degrees</b> of freedom at the subdomain vertices as primal continuity constraints. After the implicit elimination of the interior degrees of freedom in each subdomain, the resulting plate Schur complement is solved by the preconditioned conjugate gradient method. The preconditioner {{is based on the}} solution of local Reissner-Mindlin plate problems on each subdomain with clamping conditions at the primal degrees of freedom and on the solution of a coarse Reissner-Mindlin plate problem for the primal degrees of freedom. The main results of the paper are the proof and numerical verification that the proposed BDDC plate algorithm is scalable, quasi-optimal, and, most important, robust with respect to the plate thickness. While this result is due to an underlying mixed formulation of the problem, both the interface plate problem and the preconditioner are positive definite. The numerical results also show that the proposed algorithm is robust with respect to discontinuities of the material properties...|$|R

In our research into magnetic field sensing and imaging, a 2 D magnetic field sensing system with magnetically-actuated micromirrors has been proposed. Before the system is constructed, extensive investigation of magnetically-actuated micromirrors with different structures and materials has been conducted via theoretical and experimental study.

40|$|Structural {{nonlinearities}} such as freeplay {{in control}} surface bearings and actuators or in connections between wings and external payloads sometimes lead to aeroelastic limit cycle oscillations at airspeeds {{lower than the}} linear flutter speed of the aircraft. In parallel, numerous studies demonstrated the potential of linear and nonlinear tuned vibration absorbers to increase the flutter speed of linear and continuously hardening aeroelastic systems such as two-degree- of-freedom wings or long span bridges. In this work, the effect of linear and nonlinear tuned vibration absorbers is studied on a wing with pitch plunge and control surface <b>deflection</b> <b>degrees</b> of freedom and with freeplay in pitch. Depending on the tuning of the linear absorber, the linear flutter speed of the system can be increased by 10 % or the onset of limit cycle oscillations due to the freeplay can be delayed by 7. 7 % and their amplitude can be significantly decreased. The addition of cubic hardening forces on the absorber can further decrease the limit cycle amplitude in a limited airspeed range {{at the cost of}} an increase in limit cycle amplitude in another airspeed range. Conversely, the addition of a freeplay hardening force on the absorber can decrease the limit cycle amplitude without any detrimental effect...|$|R

We investigated the feasibility of dual countermeasures to address space flight deconditioning of the musculoskeletal and cardiovascular systems, by combining centrifugation with lower-body exercise. The exercise device is a small stair-stepper with constant resistance {{provided by}} dampers beneath each foot, and is the first such device {{to be used in}} centrifuge studies. We modified the existing centrifuge to support the additional stresses due to exercise and added following structural elements: support struts on the rotation shaft, a redesigned footplate to which the exercise device was mounted, and horizontal support beams. We also added a sliding mattress with linear ball bearings on rails, so that the subject's body can move up and down while stepping. Design changes and exercise feasibility were validated by having subjects exercise during centrifugation at 23 rpm. We measured heart rate, blood pressure, forces on the feet, and <b>knee</b> <b>deflection</b> due to Coriolis accelerations, for up to four subjects. As expected, heart rate and blood pressure did increase normally with exercise on the centrifuge, relative to when not exercising. However, both heart rate and systolic blood pressure were higher for exercise on the non-spinning centrifuge than on the spinning centrifuge, attributable to the necessity of pulling against the stair-stepper's dampers in order to exercise while lying supine. Approximately half the subject's weight was exerted on the footplate when not exercising. (cont.) This was expected: since the subject's head was at zero radius and thus at 0 -g radially, the 100 % artificial gravity gradient along the body's longitudinal axis gave an average effective gravity of about 0. 5 g. More pressure (up to 80 % body weight) was exerted when the subject was stair-stepping. The measured lateral <b>deflection</b> of the <b>knee</b> during normal stair-stepping and knee bend exercises increased up to three inches compared to deflections in a non-rotating environment. This issue must be further addressed to determine if stair-stepping or knee bend exercises are to be used safely in artificial gravity. by Jessica Leigh Edmonds. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|To {{accurately}} {{predict the}} space weather effects of coronal mass ejection (CME) impacts at Earth one must know {{if and when}} a CME will impact Earth, and the CME parameters upon impact. Kay et al. (2015 b) presents Forecasting a CME's Altered Trajectory (ForeCAT), a model for CME deflections based on the magnetic forces from the background solar magnetic field.
