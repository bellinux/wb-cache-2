Program objectives include an actual in-plant demonstration in a process application. This paper will describe this program, the organic Rankine package, and the economics of its application in the petro-chemical process industry. Utilization of waste heat flows in the process industry has always been considered to the limits of economic feasibility. However, both economic and technical feasibility limit the use of waste heat flows with conventional approaches in the 250 F to 350 F range. A packaged organic Rankine power cycle can technically and economically convert this type of heat flow into useful power. The system under development by MTI is one based on a conventional <b>fluorocarbon</b> <b>refrigerant</b> to generate a nominal 1000 kW from typical liquid and vapor streams in the process plant. The 220 F nominal turbine inlet temperature of the unit is well suited to the 250 F to 350 F typical of these streams. The organic Rankine power package will be in operation at MTI's Energy Test Facility in late 1979. The first field test demonstration unit is scheduled to be shipped in late 1980...|$|E
40|$|European governments {{see that}} heat pumps could reduce carbon {{emissions}} in space- and hot-water heating. EU's Renewable Energy Directive designates heat pumps as renewable - eligible for various subsidies - if their carbon footprints are below an implied, average threshold. This threshold omits carbon generated by manufacture and emission of a heat-pump's <b>fluorocarbon</b> <b>refrigerant.</b> It also omits the footprint {{of the heat}} pump's hardware. To see if these omissions are significant, this study calculated carbon footprints of representative, residential heat pumps in the UK. Three findings emerged. First, in relation to power generation, which accounts for most of a heat-pump's greenhouse-gas emissions, fluorocarbons add another 20 % to the footprint. Second, at UK efficiencies a heat-pump footprint (in kg CO 2 e emitted per kWh delivered) is comparable or higher than footprints of gaseous fuels used in heating. It {{is lower than the}} footprint of heating oil and far lower than the footprints of solid fuels. Third, production and disposal of a heat pump's hardware is relatively insignificant, accounting for only 2 - 3 % of the overall heat-pump footprint. Sensitivities to the results were assessed: key factors are footprint of electricity generation, F-gas composition and leak rates and type of wall construction.

40|$|Abstract––At {{the turn}} of the century, annual <b>fluorocarbon</b> <b>refrigerant</b> {{emissions}} from mobile and unitary airconditioning equipments is likely to pass 100, 000 metric tonnes, corresponding to a global warming impact of more than 150 million metric tonnes of CO 2. Even larger indirect CO 2 emissions result from the generation of power to drive the systems. With its use of a non-flammable and non-toxic natural fluid, the transcritical CO 2 system is a primary candidate for next-generation air-conditioning systems. This motivated the authors to design a CO 2 air-conditioning system. In this paper, the authors present Effectiveness-NTU method of thermal design of a plain-fin and tube evaporator for CO 2 airconditioning system. Using Engineering Equation Solver, the authors have proposed an optimum design of the CO 2 evaporator by parametric optimization. Generally CO 2 heat exchangers are designed for high refrigerant mass flux and use small-diameter tubes or extruded flat micro-channel tubes. The designed plain-fin and tube evaporator uses 3 / 16 ” OD tubes giving near-mini channel effect. Achieving sufficient compactness of 787 m 2 /m 3 this evaporator is capable of giving 2. 2 kW of cooling effect. For CO 2, refrigerant-side heat transfer coefficients are higher than with fluorocarbons, and reduced internal surface areas can therefore be tolerated. In current design, the authors achieved around 7, 500 W/m 2 -K of CO 2 heat transfer coefficient...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} findings of a microporous molecular sieve zeolite composite membrane experimental study for dehumidification in building ventilation and air-conditioning systems. The dependence of membrane water and air permeance from inlet airflow parameters (flow rate, humidity, temperature), and permeate total pressure was experimentally studied. Based on the obtained results, the membrane dehumidification system and the membrane air-conditioning system?s annual energy efficiency were estimated in an actual building located in a hot and humid climate. Membrane dehumidification process application was considered in three main areas: an energy recovery ventilation (ERV) system, an outdoor air dehumidification for dedicated outdoor air system (DOAS), and an air-conditioning system that combines an evaporative cooling and the membrane dehumidification system. Application of the membrane separation process for building air-conditioning provides several advantages: improvement of an occupant?s health and comfort due to better ventilation rate, better energy efficiency, operation without <b>fluorocarbon</b> <b>refrigerant,</b> capability to collect pure water from the airstream during dehumidification process, no condensation during dehumidification provides mold resistant system, and separate control of sensible and latent load. The experimental data revealed, that with the existing technology studied zeolite membrane average effective air permeance does not exceed (3 ? 0. 5) E- 9 kmol/(kPa-m?-s), and average effective water permeance is at least (5 ? 2) E- 6 kmol/kPa-m?-s that provides a membrane selectivity coefficient above 1500. The analytical model of the membrane ERV systems showed that at the design conditions, the ERV system can provide 0. 78 cross-flow enthalpy effectiveness with a membrane area of 0. 25 m?/cfm (0. 42 m?/ (m?/h)). The application of the membrane dehumidification system in a typical office building can provide an increase in dehumidification process energy efficiency from coefficient of performance of 4. 1 to 7. 4. This change in the coefficient of performance will provide energy savings between 6 % and 10 % for a conventional HVAC system. The membrane air-conditioning system analysis show that the system operating in actual weather conditions of College Station, Texas can provide annual energy efficiency of 0. 98 kW/TR with further possibility to reduce energy consumption to 0. 62 kW/TR (COP 5. 7) ...|$|E
40|$|The high ozone {{depletion}} {{and global warming}} potentials of fluorocarbon refrigerants have resulted in prohibitions and restrictions in many markets. Hydrocarbon refrigerants have low environmental impacts and are successfully used in domestic refrigerators and car air conditioners but replacing fluorocarbons in centrifugal chillers for air conditioning applications is unknown. Hydrocarbon replacements need a heat transfer correlation for refrigerant in flooded evaporators and predictions for operating conditions, capacity and performance. Safety precautions for large quantities of hydrocarbon refrigerants are needed and control of overpressure in plantrooms requires accurate prediction. Reliable correlations exist for forced convection in a single phase flow, condensation outside tubes and evaporation off sprayed tubes. For flooded evaporators this thesis proposes a new correlation for forced convection boiling of any refrigerant. An enhancement factor is combined with a modified Chen coefficient using recent pool boiling and forced convection correlations outside tubes. This correlates within typically a factor of two to known boiling literature measurements for CFC- 113, CFC- 11, HCFC- 123, HFC- 134 a and HC- 601. The operating conditions, capacity and performance of replacement hydrocarbons in centrifugal chillers were predicted using fluorocarbon performance as a model. With the new heat transfer correlation hydrocarbon predictions for flooded evaporators were made. For any <b>fluorocarbon</b> <b>refrigerant</b> there exists a replacement mixture of hydrocarbons which with a rotor speed increase about 40 % gives the same cooling capacity in the same centrifugal chiller under the same operating conditions. For example replacing HCFC- 123 in a flooded evaporator with HC- 601 / 602 [90. 4 / 9. 6] and increasing the rotor speed by 43 % will increase the coefficient of performance by 4. 5 % at the same cooling capacity. The maximum plantroom overpressure considered was from leakage and ignition of a uniform air/refrigerant mixture with maximum laminar burning velocity. Flow was modelled using a turbulence viscosity due to Launder and Spalding and turbulent deflagration using a reaction progress variable after Zimont. These partial differential equations were solved approximately for two and three dimensional geometries using finite volume methods from the Fluent program suite. Simple overpressure predictions from maximum flame area approximations agreed with Fluent results within 13. 7 % promising safe plantroom design without months of computer calculation...|$|E

40|$|This paper reviews recent {{advances}} {{that have been}} made in enhancing film condensation of <b>fluorocarbon</b> <b>refrigerants</b> in ·a bundle of horizontal tubes. The emphasis in the discussion is on the effects of fin geometry, vapor shear and condensate inundation. It is shown that the fin geometry is an important factor that controls the heat transfer performance. The effect of vapor shear is much smaller for a finned tube than for a smooth tube. The effect of condensate inundation is more marked for a three-dimensional fin tube than for a two-dimensional fin tube. Also, the effect is more marked for an in-line tube bundle than for a staggered tube bundle. For a two-dimensional fin tube with and without the effect of vapor shear and for a bundle of two-dimensional fin tubes with negligible vapor shear, several theoretical models exist that can predict the heat transfer coeffi-cient with sufficient accuracy.

40|$|Evaporative CO 2 cooling has {{attracted}} {{a lot of interest}} as cooling fluid for particle physics detectors. Two detectors (the AMS on the International Space Station and the LHCb at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN) have been equipped with CO 2 cooling; many more particle detectors are considering it for the future. The cooling fluid for detectors must be radiation hard, therefore normal refrigerants cannot be used. Up to now most detectors were cooled with fluorocarbons in both single and two-phase. Evaporative CO 2 has proven to be superior with respect to the <b>fluorocarbon</b> <b>refrigerants</b> used now. In detectors it is highly important to have very low mass structures, as mass deviates the particle tracks which need to be measured accurately. CO 2 cooling is superior in small cooling channels. Therefore, cooling channels with CO 2 can be made much smaller than fluorocarbon channels, gaining at least a factor of 5 in applied cooling systems mass.

40|$|Magnetic {{refrigeration}} (MR) {{is potentially}} a high efficiency, low cost, and greenhouse gas-free refrigeration technology, {{and with the}} looming phase out of HCFC and HFC <b>fluorocarbons</b> <b>refrigerants</b> is drawing more attention {{as an alternative to}} the existing vapor compression refrigeration. MR is based on the magnetocaloric effect (MCE), which occurs due to the coupling of a magnetic sublattice with an external magnetic field. With the magnetic spin system aligned by magnetic field, the magnetic entropy changes by SM as a result of isothermal magnetization of a material. On the other hand, the sum of the lattice and electronic entropies of a solid must be changed by SM as a result of adiabatically magnetizing the material, thus resulting in an increase of the lattice vibrations and the adiabatic temperature change, ∆Tad. Both the isothermal entropy change SM and adiabatic temperature change ∆Tad are important parameters in quantifying the MCE and performance of magnetocaloric materials (MCM). In general, SM and ∆Tad are obtained using magnetization and heat capacity data and the Maxwell equations. Although Maxwell equations can be used to calculate MCE for first order magnetic transition (FOMT) materials due to the fact that the transition is not truly discontinuous, there can be some errors depending on the numerical integration method used. Thus, direct measurements of ∆Tad are both useful and required to better understand the nature of the giant magnetocaloric effect (GMCE). Moreover, the direct measurements of ∆Tad allow investigation of dynamic performance of FOMT materials experiencing repeated magnetization/demagnetization cycles. This research utilized a special test facility to directly measure MCE of Gd 5 Si 2 Ge 2, Gd 5 Si 2. 7 Ge 1. 3, MnFePAs, LaFeSiH, Ni 55. 2 M 18. 6 Ga 26. 2, Dy, Tb, DyCo 2, (Hf 0. 83 Ta 0. 17) Fe 1. 98, GdAl 2 and Nd 2 Fe 17, MCMs, both FOMT and second order magnetic transition (SOMT) materials, at different magnetizing speeds, and the resulting data will be compared to indirect MCE data.

40|$|This {{project was}} {{initiated}} by the Department of Energy {{in response to a}} request from the HVAC industry for consolidated information about alternative heating and cooling cycles and for objective comparisons of those cycles in space conditioning applications. Twenty-seven different heat pumping technologies are compared on energy use and operating costs using consistent operating conditions and assumptions about component efficiencies for all of them. This report provides a concise summary of the underlying principals of each technology, its advantages and disadvantages, obstacles to commercial development, and economic feasibility. Both positive and negative results in this study are valuable; {{the fact that many of}} the cycles investigated are not attractive for space conditioning avoids any additional investment of time or resources in evaluating them for this application. In other cases, negative results in terms of the cost of materials or in cycle efficiencies identify where significant progress needs to be made in order for a cycle to become commercially attractive. Specific conclusions are listed for many of the technologies being promoted as alternatives to electrically-driven vapor compression heat pumps using <b>fluorocarbon</b> <b>refrigerants.</b> Although reverse Rankine cycle heat pumps using hydrocarbons have similar energy use to conventional electric-driven heat pumps, there are no significant energy savings due to the minor differences in estimated steady-state performance; higher costs would be required to accommodate the use of a flammable refrigerant. Magnetic and compressor-driven metal hydride heat pumps may be able to achieve efficiencies comparable to reverse Rankine cycle heat pumps, but they are likely to have much higher life cycle costs because of high costs for materials and peripheral equipment. Both thermoacoustic and thermionic heat pumps could have lower life cycle costs than conventional electric heat pumps because of reduced equipment and maintenance costs although energy use would be higher. There are strong opportunities for gas-fired heat pumps to reduce both energy use and operating costs outside of the high cooling climates in the southeast, south central states, and the southwest. Diesel and IC (Otto) engine-driven heat pumps are commercially available and should be able to increase their market share relative to gas furnaces on a life cycle cost basis; the cost premiums associated with these products, however, make it difficult to achieve three or five year paybacks which adversely affects their use in the U. S. Stirling engine-driven and duplex Stirling heat pumps have been investigated in the past as potential gas-fired appliances that would have longer lives and lower maintenance costs than diesel and IC engine-driven heat pumps at slightly lower efficiencies. These potential advantages have not been demonstrated and there has been a low level of interest in Stirling engine-driven heat pumps since the late 1980 's. GAX absorption heat pumps have high heating efficiencies relative to conventional gas furnaces and are viable alternatives to furnace/air conditioner combinations in all parts of the country outside of the southeast, south central states, and desert southwest.

40|$|AbstractThe twenty {{first century}} is rapidly {{becoming}} the perfect energy storm, modern society {{is faced with}} volatile energy prices and growing environmental concerns as well as energy supply and security issues. One {{of the greatest challenges}} facing mankind in the twenty first century is energy. Fossil fuels such as coal, petroleum and natural gas have been the main energy resources for everything vital for human society. The burning of fossil fuels has caused and is causing damage to the environment of earth. By 2050 the demand for energy could double or even triple as the global population grows and developing countries expand their economies. This has already raised concerns over potential supply difficulties, depletion of energy resources and expediting environmental impacts like ozone layer depletion, global warming and climate change etc. The most abundant energy resource available to human society is solar energy. The utilization of solar energy is as old as human history. Among various types of renewable energy resources, solar energy is the least utilized. Air conditioning is essential for maintaining thermal comfort in indoor environments, particularly for hot and humid climates. Today, air conditioning comprising cooling and dehumidification has become a necessity in commercial and residential buildings and industrial processes. During the summer, the demand for electricity greatly increases because of the extensive use of air-conditioning systems. This is a source of major problems in the country's electricity supply and contributes to an increase of CO 2 emissions causing the environmental pollution and global warming. On the other hand, vapour compression air conditioning systems have impacts on stratospheric ozone depletion because of the chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) and the hydro <b>fluorocarbon</b> (HCFC) <b>refrigerants.</b> The use of solar energy to drive cooling cycles is attractive since the cooling load is roughly in phase with solar energy availability. To cool with solar thermal energy, one solution is to use an absorption chillier using water and lithium bromide solution. Solar air conditioning systems help to minimize fossil fuel energy use. Among the evolving energy efficient air conditioning technologies are liquid desiccant air conditioning (LDAC) systems, which have showed promising performance during the past decades and are believed to be a strong competitor with the widely used conventional air conditioning systems (CAC). Desiccant evaporation cooling technology is environmental friendly and can be used to condition the indoor environment of buildings. Unlike conventional air conditioning systems, the desiccant air conditioning systems can be driven by low grade heat sources such as solar energy and industrial waste heat. In this study, a focus is made on reduction in Air Conditioning capacity, fuel savings and emission reductions attainable through the use of solar energy...|$|R
