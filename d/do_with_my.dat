This generated much protest from Boycott supporters, who rallied, calling for his reinstatement at a meeting on 9 October in Ossett, Yorkshire. Bill Athey left the club at this time, and while Boycott in his biography maintained {{that he had no}} reason to believe that his actions had caused Athey's departure, Athey later stated to biographer Leo McKinstry that [...] "Boycott's attitude and the atmosphere he created had everything to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> decision to leave Yorkshire."

[...] He worked with his brother in a car body repair shop, and used the money to purchase a Ford coach. Pearson removed the fenders to convert the vehicle into a street rod. He jumped the car over ditches until he rolled it over. His mother paid him to junk the car and he used the money to purchase another car to build. In 1952, he raced a 1940 Ford at dirt tracks and won $30 in an outlaw class race. He kept winning and attracted the attention of Spartanburg's racing community, including Joe Littlejohn.|$|E

500|$|For Dicen Que Soy, George picked {{songs that}} had been {{previously}} recorded by female Latin singers such as Rocío Jurado and Lupita D'Alessio, {{with a focus on}} feminist lyrics. George, India, and Shirley Marte also wrote love songs ("Dejate Amar" [...] and [...] "No Me Conviene") for the album and added India's cover of George Benson's song [...] "I Just Want to Hang Around You" [...] as a counterbalance, in case the feminist songs did not prove popular. When describing the production, India said that [...] "This is me, my flavor in a tropical way, and showing what I can <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> voice." [...] The theme of the title track's lyrics revolves the singer being criticized by gossips without caring about their opinions. Puerto Rican singer Tito Nieves is featured on the song [...] "No Me Conviene" [...] and [...] "Vivir lo Nuestro" [...] was included as a bonus track for the album. [...] Musically, the production mixes romantic and hard salsa music along with funk and timba. The record took four months to complete.|$|E
500|$|Although Scott is antipathetic towards Richardson's final novel, not {{everyone}} {{was of the}} same opinion; Jane Austen was a devotee of the novel, {{which was part of}} her mental furniture to the point where she could claim to describe [...] "all that was ever said or done in the cedar parlour". She would for example casually compare a flower in a new cap she got to the white feather described by Harriet Byron as being in hers. Nevertheless, throughout her life she also subjected Grandison to much affectionate, even satirical mockery - adapting it into a dramatic lampoon (not published until 1980) around 1800. Her juvenalia also included a heroine who guyed Harriet Byron's frequent fainting, through being “in such a hurry to have a succession of fainting fits, that she had scarcely patience enough to recover from one before she fell into another”. As late as 1813, she would respond to a long letter from her sister Cassandra by exclaiming “Dear me!...Like Harriet Byron I ask, what am I to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> Gratitude”.|$|E

The {{recording}} sessions {{took place in}} studios around California and New York City, including Electric Lady Studios in New York, The Enterprise Studios in Burbank, California, Conway Recording Studios, The Record Plant and NRG Recording Studios in Hollywood. According to Aguilera, the recording sessions were much longer than she thought. She further explained that lots of things came up during that time, including her first break-up with her first boyfriend Jorge Santos. Aguilera also believed that the lyrics of Stripped were so personal, and her vocals [...] "represent a rawer, more bare-bones approach as well, with less of the ostentatious riffing that has miffed critics in the past". She stated, [...] "I did the vocal gymnastics thing because it was fun. That's why I like blues, too, because you can experiment more with that side of your voice. But I thought the lyrics on this record are so personal, deep and good that I wanted to make them stand out more than what I could <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> voice technically".|$|E

500|$|The most {{dramatic}} interview between Mary and Knox {{took place on}} 24 June 1563. Mary summoned Knox to Holyrood after hearing {{that he had been}} preaching against her proposed marriage to Don Carlos, the son of Philip II of Spain. Mary began by scolding Knox, then she burst into tears. [...] "What have ye to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> marriage?" [...] she asked, and [...] "What are ye within this commonwealth?" [...] "A subject born within the same, Madam," [...] Knox replied. He noted that though he was not of noble birth, he had the same duty as any subject to warn of dangers to the realm. When Mary started to cry again, he said, [...] "Madam, in God's presence I speak: I never delighted in the weeping of any of God's creatures; yea I can scarcely well abide the tears of my own boys whom my own hand corrects, much less can I rejoice in your Majesty's weeping." [...] He added that he would rather endure her tears, however, than remain silent and [...] "betray my Commonwealth". At this, Mary ordered him out of the room.|$|E

500|$|Promoted to captain on August 5, 1853, Grant was {{assigned}} to command Company F, 4th Infantry, at the newly constructed Fort Humboldt in California. He arrived at the fort on January 5, 1854, and reported to its commander Lieutenant Colonel Robert C. Buchanan. Grant was bored and depressed about being separated from his wife Julia, {{and he began to}} drink. An officer who roomed with Grant said he [...] "fell too much under the influence of liquor to properly perform his duties. Colonel Buchanan demanded he should resign." [...] Historian Jean Edward Smith says, [...] "The story rings true." [...] When Grant was reprimanded by Buchanan for one drinking episode, Grant told Buchanan if he did not reform he would resign. One Sunday, Grant was rumored to have been found at his company's paytable influenced by drink. Keeping his pledge to Buchanan, Grant resigned, effective July 31, 1854, without explanation. Buchanan endorsed Grant's letter of resignation but did not submit any report that verified the incident. Grant was neither arrested nor faced court-martial, while the War Department stated, [...] "Nothing stands against his good name." [...] Grant said years later, [...] "the vice of intemperance (drunkenness) had not a little to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> decision to resign." [...] With no means of support, Grant returned to St. Louis and reunited with his family, uncertain about his future.|$|E

500|$|As an {{openly gay}} man {{throughout}} his career, Sylvester {{came to be}} seen as a spokesman for the gay community. He informed a journalist that [...] "I realize that gay people have put me on a pedestal and I love it. After all, of all the oppressed minorities, they just have to be the most oppressed. They have all the hassles of finding something or someone to identify with [...] and they chose me. I like being around gay people and they've proven to be some of my closest friends and most loyal audiences." [...] Elsewhere, he nevertheless remarked that he felt his career had [...] "transcended the gay movement. I mean, my sexuality has nothing to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> music. When I'm fucking I'm not thinking about singing and vice versa." [...] He was openly critical of what he perceived as divisive tendencies within the gay community itself, noting that [...] "I get this conformist shit from queens all the time. They always want to read me. They always want me to do it their way. I am not going to conform to the gay lifestyle as they see it and that's for sure". He was particularly critical of [...] "clones" [...] gay men who dressed alike with boots, boot-cut jeans, checked shirts and handlebar mustaches [...] stating that all too often they judged those gay people who were flamboyant or extravagant.|$|E
500|$|The {{campaign}} {{between the}} two also saw racial dust-ups caused by perceptions of remarks made by campaign surrogates. [...] In March 2008 Ferraro gave {{an interview with the}} Daily Breeze in which she said: [...] "If Obama was a white man, he would not be in this position. And if he was a woman (of any color) he would not be in this position. He happens to be very lucky to be who he is. And the country is caught up in the concept." [...] (Ferraro had made a similar comment in 1988 disparaging Jesse Jackson's candidacy in the party's presidential primaries, saying that because of his [...] "radical" [...] views, [...] "if Jesse Jackson were not black, he wouldn't be in the race.") Ferraro justified the statements by referring to her own run for vice president. Echoing a statement she wrote about herself in 1988, Ferraro said that [...] "I was talking about historic candidacies and what I started off by saying (was that) {{if you go back to}} 1984 and look at my historic candidacy, which I had just talked about all these things, in 1984, if my name was Gerard Ferraro instead of Geraldine Ferraro, I would have never been chosen as a vice-presidential candidate. It had nothing to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> qualification." [...] Her comments resonated with some older white women, but generated an immediate backlash elsewhere. There was strong criticism and charges of racism from many supporters of Obama and Obama called them [...] "patently absurd". Clinton publicly expressed disagreement with Ferraro's remarks, while Ferraro vehemently denied she was a racist. Again speaking to the Breeze, Ferraro responded to the attacks by saying: [...] "I really think they're attacking me because I'm white. How's that?" [...] Ferraro resigned from Clinton's finance committee on , 2008, two days after the firestorm began, saying that she didn't want the Obama camp to use her comments to hurt Clinton's campaign.|$|E
500|$|In March 1955, St. Laurent tabled {{legislation}} {{to make the}} Department of Defence Production permanent. This would also extend the extraordinary powers of the Minister. [...] Fearful of another damaging confrontation between Howe and the Opposition, the Cabinet agreed that St. Laurent would guide the bill through, but after {{the first day of}} debate St. Laurent, who was prone to depression, absented himself. Tory frontbencher Donald Fleming contended that the extension could make the minister [...] "the virtual dictator of the economy". [...] With St. Laurent absent (or when present, silent), Howe took charge of the bill, and according to his biographers, Robert Bothwell and William Kilbourn, [...] "utterly failed to perceive that the bill and his manner of defending it were a godsend to the opposition". When Howe alluded to the Avro Arrow project and that he [...] "was out on a limb for $30 million", which gave him [...] "the shudders", the Opposition met the statement with jeers and cries of [...] "What's a million?" [...] The Tories were supported by the Social Credit MPs, while the Government gained the support of the CCF on this issue. [...] Interrupted by a lengthy governmental trip by Howe to Australia and New Zealand, the debate stretched on until midyear. In early July, Howe left town for a long weekend, after asking St. Laurent and Minister of Finance Walter Harris to maintain his stand while he was gone, although he gave Harris the authority to do as he saw fit. Without informing Howe, St. Laurent contacted Drew, and the two men agreed that the minister's powers would expire in 1959 unless sooner renewed. The amended bill passed the Commons in Howe's absence, and when he returned, he furiously accused Harris of making a deal behind his back. However, when Howe was told that it had been the Prime Minister's decision, he accepted it. [...] Howe had earlier turned down an Opposition offer to agree to a three-year extension of his ministerial powers, saying [...] "That would mean coming back to Parliament in three years, and I've more to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> time than amusing Parliament." [...] The extension was allowed to expire in 1959, although by then, Howe had left office.|$|E
