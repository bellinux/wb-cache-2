50|$|Whenever fluid is {{supplied}} to the cylinder the piston will move. This movement of piston is called as stroke. The piston can move in forward or reverse direction.The cylinders {{can be classified}} as double acting or single acting. In single acting cylinder work will be performed only in the forward stroke. The fluid will be supplied to the cylinder only during the forward stroke. The return stroke is achieved by the spring mounted in the cylinder. In <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> <b>cylinder</b> {{there will be two}} ports for the supply of fluid. Work can be obtained both at forward and reverse strokes.

50|$|A <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> <b>cylinder</b> is {{extended}} and retracted using {{hydraulic or pneumatic}} pressure in both directions. Double acting telescopic cylinders are thus much more complex in design than the single acting type. This additional complexity {{is due to the}} requirement of adding retracting piston faces to all of the cylinder stages and the difficulty in supplying pressurized fluid to the retraction pistons of the intermediate stages.|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} this is {{erecting}} the mast of a large mobile drilling rig. The mast is erected to the vertical position using a telescopic cylinder. However, to lower the mast, gravity is not available for the initial tilt back from the vertical position. Thus, the plunger stage only of the telescopic actuator is equipped as a <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> <b>cylinder</b> to provide the initial force to pull the mast back from vertical. Once the tilt back has been initiated, then gravity takes over and supplies the force to complete the full cylinder retraction. The remaining stages, therefore, are single acting. This special combination is much less complex and much less costly than using an entirely double acting design.|$|E

50|$|In general, {{based on}} the application, a {{pneumatic}} cylinder is usually a single <b>acting</b> <b>cylinder,</b> {{where there is a}} single port in the cylinder and were cylinder extension is done by compressed air and retraction by means of open coiled spring. In <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> <b>cylinders</b> two ports both extend and retract by means of compressed air.|$|R
5000|$|There {{may be one}} or more pistons. Each piston {{is inside}} a cylinder, into which a gas is introduced, either already under {{pressure}} (e.g. steam engine), or heated inside the cylinder either by ignition of a fuel air mixture (internal combustion engine) or by contact with a hot heat exchanger in the cylinder (Stirling engine). The hot gases expand, pushing the piston {{to the bottom of}} the cylinder. This position is also known as the Bottom Dead Center (BDC), or where the piston forms the largest volume in the cylinder. The piston is returned to the cylinder top (Top Dead Centre) (TDC) by a flywheel, the power from other pistons connected to the same shaft or (in a <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> <b>cylinder)</b> by the same process acting on the other side of the piston. This is where the piston forms the smallest volume in the cylinder. In most types the expanded or [...] "exhausted" [...] gases are removed from the cylinder by this stroke. The exception is the Stirling engine, which repeatedly heats and cools the same sealed quantity of gas. The stroke is simply the distance between the TDC and the BDC, or the greatest distance that the piston can travel in one direction.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{places where}} there is a space restriction, a {{foldable}} stair can be used. In accordance with this, we have simulated a mechanism in which the unfolding and folding of the stair is due to the linear motion of the slider at one end. The effect of the change in length of connecting rod that converts linear motion to rotary motion is to be analyzed. Here we consider 10 different lengths of the connecting rod. The force needed to move the slider is measured using MSC ADAMSTM software in each of these cases. Then a linear actuation circuit for the slider using a <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> <b>cylinder</b> is designed and simulated using Festo FluidSIMTM software.

50|$|Typical {{applications}} for <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> telescopic <b>cylinders</b> include the packer-ejector cylinders in garbage trucks and transfer trailers, horizontal compactors, telescopic excavator shovels, and roll-on/roll-off trucks. In {{all of these}} applications, the cylinder operates near horizontally and thus gravity is not available to retract the actuator. A <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> design is therefore required to both push and pull the telescoping mechanism.|$|R
50|$|Another {{problem can}} occur if a <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> {{telescopic}} <b>cylinder</b> encounters a load that pulls on the actuator during extension {{such as when}} a tilting load goes over center and opens the cylinder beyond the internal volume of the hydraulic oil.

40|$|A <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> <b>cylinder</b> {{operation}} has been fully monitored in its key functional parameters, focused on characterization of end-of-stroke cushioning and starting phases. Being the cylinder performance reliant in the piston constructive geometry, {{the number and}} location of piston circumferential grooves is a significant parameter affecting the internal cushioning system performance. An eddy current displacement sensor assembled in the piston allows assessment of piston radial displacement inside the cylinder tube, which is directly related with the studied operating phases. Due to such 3 D displacements, the piston becomes as an active and self-adjusting element along the functional cycle of the cylinder. Mechanical joints orientation and operating pressure are also relevant parameters affecting piston radial displacement and, thus, the cushioning and starting performance. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) results confirm the observed functional role of the perimeter grooves; the flow and pressure distributions, where develops a significant radial force, are also {{in accordance with the}} registered radial displacement.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel control design, developed to realise fast and accurate position {{control of a}} pneumatic actuator using inexpensive on/off solenoid valves. In contrast to conventional control methods, the proposed control method operates chatter free, based on air compression. The control principle was developed by investigating the dynamics of a pneumatic actuator with an identified mathematical model. This new approach is applied to a pneumatic <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> <b>cylinder,</b> controlled {{by a pair of}} 5 / 3 way directional single solenoid valves. The described closed-loop circuit copes with the discontinuities associated with the valve’s switching dynamics, and relatively long response time. The experimental apparatus uses an analogue displacement encoder for metering the piston’s position and velocity, and doesn’t incorporate pressure sensors thus ensuring a low cost system design. The results of experiments with various step responses show that the proposed control method performs well. The measured steady-state position errors are equal to the used potentiometer’s travel resolution, which is 0, 01 mm. Therefore this novel control and the related neumatic system design could be a cost effective alternative to the servo-pneumatic positioning systems...|$|E

50|$|In {{case the}} {{retracted}} {{length of the}} cylinder is too long for the cylinder {{to be built in}} the structure, Telescopic cylinder can be used. One has to realize that for simple pushing applications telescopic cylinders might be easily available; for higher forces and/or <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> <b>cylinders,</b> they must be designed especially and are very expensive. If hydraulic cylinders are only used for pushing and the piston rod is brought in again by other means, one can also use Plunger cylinders. Plunger cylinders have no sealing over the piston, if the piston even exists. This means that only one oil connection is necessary. In general the diameter of the plunger is rather large compared with a normal piston cylinder, whereas a hydraulic motor will always leak oil. A hydraulic cylinder does not have a leakage over the piston nor over the cylinder head sealing so that {{there is no need for}} a mechanical brake.|$|R
50|$|The above {{differential}} cylinder is also called a regenerative cylinder control circuit. This term {{means that the}} cylinder is a single rod, <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> hydraulic <b>cylinder.</b> The control circuit includes a valve and piping which during {{the extension of the}} piston, conducts the oil from the rod side of the piston {{to the other side of}} the piston instead of to the pump’s reservoir. The oil which is conducted to the other side of the piston is referred to as the regenerative oil.|$|R

Crop thinning {{is one of the most}} important stages in row crop production which is laborious and costly. The objective of this project is design and construction of a row crop thinning machine. Four main system units are plant sensors, ground sensors, control and thinning platforms. In this machine the unwanted plants on the rows are randomly removed by employing a pneumatically system. A blade on a vertical arm with pendulum motion removes the plant from the rows. The machine control system consists of an arm and a blade which is activated by a <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> <b>cylinder</b> and equipped with a relay and a timer. The pneumatic cylinder is controlled via a solenoid valve. Laboratory tests were conducted to validate the machine performance. Some other preliminary tests also were performed for optimization of parameters such as cinematic index and cutting length of blades. The laboratory tests (totally 9 tests) were performed with a constant forward speed and three levels of plant density, using artificial plants. The data were analyzed using SPSS software. The results show that satisfactory performance of the machine is achieved when the plant density is moderate i. e. the thinning performance reduces with higher plant distance in the row. The other effective variable on machine performance is the adjustment of sensor sensitivity, which is used to distinguish between week and strong plants. In general the machine performance is sensitive to plant shape and morphology, plant distribution pattern in the field, growing stage of the plants, time of thinning and the effectiveness of previous weeding operation...|$|E

50|$|The {{length of}} a {{hydraulic}} cylinder is the total of the stroke, {{the thickness of the}} piston, the thickness of bottom and head and the length of the connections. Often this length does not fit in the machine. In that case the piston rod is also used as a piston barrel and a second piston rod is used. These kinds of cylinders are called telescopic cylinders. If we call a normal rod cylinder single stage, telescopic cylinders are multi-stage units of two, three, four, five or more stages. In general telescopic cylinders are much more expensive than normal cylinders. Most telescopic <b>cylinders</b> are single <b>acting</b> (push). <b>Double</b> <b>acting</b> telescopic <b>cylinders</b> must be specially designed and manufactured.|$|R

In such a circumstance, both ports can be located in the barrel. An internal passageway must be fitted, however, so that the retracting fluid is supplied to the plunger section at full extension. This special passageway is in itself a telescopic assembly that extends with the cylinder and is outfitted with seals on the various stages.|$|R
