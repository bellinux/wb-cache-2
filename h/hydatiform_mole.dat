40|$|Introduction & Objective: <b>Hydatiform</b> <b>mole</b> {{is one of}} the {{emergency}} and high risk situations during pregnancy and is defined as swelling and hyperplasia of the placental chorionic villosities. It is histologically characterized by abnormal changes in placental villi including trophoblastic proliferation and stromal edema of villi. Its incidence in different regions of the world is different and various risk factors have been mentioned in different studies. The aim of the present study is determination of frequency of <b>hydatiform</b> <b>mole</b> and some relative factors in Mo'tazedi hospital, Kermanshah. Materials & Methods: In this descriptive analytic study, medical records of 200 women with the diagnosis of <b>hydatiform</b> <b>mole</b> who were admitted in Mo'tazedi hospital during a 10 year period (1998 - 2008) were retrospectively reviewed. Also, records of 400 healthy pregnant women who were admitted for delivery were reviewed as control group. The data were analyzed using SPSS software and statistical test including U. mann withney, kelmogrof esmereinof,fischer exact and chi square. Results: In this study frequency of <b>hydatiform</b> <b>mole</b> was 3. 1 / 1000 live birth frequency of complete and incomplete mole were 2. 07 / 1000 and 1. 04 / 1000 live birth,respectively.

History of previous molar pregnancy and irregular menstruation, were significantly effective on frequency of molar pregnancy. (p= 0. 004,p= 0. 01 respectively). Conclusion: Molar pregnancy is an emergency situation. There is a high incidence and a high recurrence rate of <b>hydatiform</b> <b>mole</b> in our country. <b>Hydatiform</b> <b>mole</b> should be considered as one of the probable diagnoses women in their reproductive age who refer with bleeding...|$|E
40|$|Background [...] The p 21 (WAF 1 /CIP 1) gene mediates growth arrest by {{inhibiting}} G 1 cyclin dependent kinases and {{has been}} considered as a downstream effector of the tumour suppressor gene p 53. Aim [...] To analyse the role of p 21 (WAF 1 /CIP 1) in gestational trophoblastic disease. Methods [...] The immunohistochemical expression of p 21 (WAF 1 /CIP 1) gene was measured in 33 placentas, 28 partial hydatidiform moles, 54 complete hydatidiform moles, and 13 choriocarcinomas in paraffin wax embedded tissue. The results were correlated with p 53 (DO 7) and Ki 67 (MIB 1) immunoreactivity as well as clinical progress. Results [...] p 21 (WAF 1 /CIP 1) immunoreactivity was found predominantly in the nuclei of the syncytiotrophoblasts. p 21 (WAF 1 /CIP 1) protein expression correlated with gestational age in normal placentas (p = 0. 0001) but not in hydatidiform moles (p = 0. 89). Complete hydatidiform moles and choriocarcinomas had a significantly higher p 21 (WAF 1 /CIP 1) expression compared with normal placentas and partial <b>hydatiform</b> <b>moles</b> (p 0. 05) in p 21 (WAF 1 /CIP 1) expression between the 17 patients who developed persistent gestational trophoblastic disease {{and those who did}} not. Conclusions [...] This study suggests that p 21 (WAF 1 /CIP 1) expression in trophoblastic disease may be induced by a p 53 independent pathway. The proliferative activity of gestational trophoblastic diseases might not be determined solely by the control of the cell cycle operated by p 21 (WAF 1 /CIP 1). p 21 (WAF 1 /CIP 1) expression is not an accurate prognostic indicator of gestational trophoblastic disease. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the validity of p 57 kip 2 in the diagnosis of hydatidiform moleMaterial and Method: Immunohistochemistry with the P 57 kip 2 antibody was done in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples of hydropic abortion (n= 20), simple abortion (n= 20), partial hydatidiform mole (n= 20) and complete hydatidiform mole (n= 20). Immunoreactivity was recorded separately in the different cellular components, such as villous cytotrophoblast, extravillous trophoblast, syncytiotrophoblast, stromal cells, and decidual cells. Then data were analyzed with suitable statistical test. Results: In partial <b>hydatiform</b> <b>mole</b> and also in simple and hydropic abortion, nuclear P 57 kip 2 expression was observed at high frequency in cytotrophoblast, villous stromal cells and maternal decidua, but was absent in syncytiotrophoblast. Absent of nuclear immunoreactivity of cytotrophoblasts was detected in the majority (95 %) of complete <b>hydatiform</b> <b>mole.</b> Significant difference was seen for P 57 kip 2 expression in complete <b>hydatiform</b> <b>mole</b> in comparison with hydropic abortion (P= 0. 001) and partial <b>hydatiform</b> <b>mole</b> (P= 0. 001).

40|$|Background: Gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) {{defines a}} heterogenenous group ofinterrelated lesions {{that arise from}} the trophoblastic {{epithelium}} of the placenta. There are severalhistologically distinct types of GTD: <b>hydatiform</b> <b>mole</b> (complete or partial), persistant/invasivegestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN), choriocarcinoma and placenta site trophoblastictumors. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the frequency and risk factors of GTD amongwomen admitted to Imam Khomeini Hospital in Ahvaz, Iran. Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted at Imam KhomeiniHospital in Ahvaz, Iran. All hospital records related to GTD (132) from 1996 until 2006 werereviewed. Demographic and histo-pathologic characteristics were extracted. Chi-square andFisher-exact tests were used to analyze all variables. P ≤ 0. 05 was considered statisticallysignificant. SPSS, version 11 was used for statistical analysis. Results: The mean age of patients was 27. 6 years. Most patients who presented with GTDwere of ages 18 - 35 years (71. 3 %). There was no relationship between age and hydatiformmole during the reproductive years. There were 28 (18. 9 %) patients over the age 40, of which 18 (15. 90 %) of these had a complete <b>hydatiform</b> <b>mole.</b> Within this group, 9 (6. 8 %) changedto a persistent mole.

METHODS: A cross-sectional, prospective and descriptive conducted on patients who underwent curretage due to a diagnosis of abortion or <b>hydatiform</b> <b>mole</b> whose material was sent for pathological examination. We excluded women who did not accept to participate and refused to sign the free informed consent form. We studied the following variables: pathological findings, age, race, number of pregnancies and previous abortions, gestational age at diagnosis, quantitative serum beta fraction of human chorionic gonadotropin and ultrasound findings. The data were compared to the to histological diagnosis, {{considered to be the}} gold standard. Data were stored and analyzed in Microsoft Excel® software and the Epi-Info program, version 6. 0 (STATCALC) and the results are presented as frequency (percentage) or mean±standard deviation. The &# 967; 2 test was used to determine the association between qualitative variables and the level of significance was set at p< 0. 005. RESULTS: A total of 515 curettage procedures were performed, 446 of which comprised the sample. The frequency of <b>hydatiform</b> <b>mole</b> was 2. 2 % (ten cases). The mean age of the patients with a mole was 31 ± 10 years, most patients were white and multiparous and had no history of previous abortions, but there was no significant association between these variables. The pregnancy loss occurred early in patients with and without a mole and the most common complaints in both groups were vaginal bleeding and cramps in the lower abdomen. Quantitative determination of human chorionic gonadotropin was performed in 422 cases (413 with and 9 without a <b>hydatiform</b> <b>mole).</b> The levels of the hormone were higher than 100, 000 mIU/mL in 1. 9 % of the patients without a <b>hydatiform</b> <b>mole</b> and in 44. 45 % of the patients with the disease (p= 0. 00004). All patients with this hormonal level had an ultrasound suspicion of <b>hydatiform</b> <b>mole</b> and one of them also had a clinical suspicion. A total of 333 patients underwent ultrasound examination. Of the patients with sonographic findings suggestive of molar pregnancy, there was confirmation in five (41. 7 %) cases. The other seven (58. 3 %) were false positives. A significant association was found between ultrasound suspected molar pregnancy and disease confirmation by histopathological analysis (p= 0. 0001). In 50 % of cases of <b>hydatiform</b> <b>mole</b> there was no suspicion of the disease according to clinical signs and symptoms, levels of beta fraction of human chorionic gonadotropin or sonographic findings.

40|$|Introduction & Objective: All {{cases of}} gestational trophoblastic tumors are curable if exact {{diagnosis}} and early treatment is done. The serum level of βHCG is a sensitive marker of the disease. In {{this study we}} intended to compare the "βHCG regression curves" in patients with molar pregnancy and trophoblastic tumor to determine which patients require chemotherapy and should start early treatment. Materials & Methods: Recorded data of 80 patients, consisting of 40 uneventful <b>hydatiform</b> <b>mole</b> cases and 40 trophoblastic tumor patients referred to Meshed Ghaem gynecology clinic were gathered and studied. Results: Mean age was 26. 7 years in the molar group and 27 in the gestational trophoblastic tumor group. There was a history of abortion {{in the past in}} 25 % of the patients of both groups. 67. 5 % of patients were in the stage 1 and thus were 100 % curable. The βHCG regression curve exceeded the normal range in the gestational trophoblastic tumors groups (P= 0. 001). Conclusion: This study showed that βHCG regression curve can be used to diagnose these tumors much earlier (a few weeks after evacuation) and thus start treatment sooner.

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that the extent of {{methylation}} of cytosine in vertebrate DNA is inversely correlated with gene expression. We studied cytosine methylation in and around the homologous human growth hormone (GH) and chorionic somatomammotropin (CS) genes to determine if these genes are undermethylated in DNA from tissues in which they are expressed (pituitary and placenta, respectively) compared to other tissues. Hpa II and Hha I (which cleave only unmethylated 5 ' CCGG 3 ' and 5 ' GCGC 3 ' respectively) and Msp I (which cleaves CCGG and CmeCGG) were used to digest DNA samples followed by gel electrophoresis, Southern transfer and hybridization with a GH cDNA probe. The extent of methylation of Hpa II and Hha I sites in the GH and CS genes was leukocyte much greater than pituitary greater than placenta = hydatidiform mole. Taken as a whole, our data support the hypothesis that undermethylation is a necessary but not sufficient condition for gene expression since placental and pituitary DNAs are less methylated than leukocyte DNA in this region. However, the correlation between gene expression and undermethylation is imperfect since (1) <b>hydatiform</b> <b>mole</b> DNA has a very similar methylation pattern compared to placental DNA even though moles make little or no CS and (2) the level of methylation of the GH gene compared to the CS gene does not vary in a tissue-specific manner...|$|E
40|$|The {{incidence}} of mole pregnancy {{appears to be}} higher in Iran than in Europe or North America. This gave {{us an opportunity to}} study a number of biochemical measurements related to the thyroid. In 14 patients with <b>hydatiform</b> <b>mole,</b> the T 3 resin uptake, serum thyroxine (T 4), ETR, T 3 RIA, human serum TSH (hTSH) and serum human Chorinic gonadotropin (hCG) were measured. Of the 14 patients 6 showed clinical symtoms of hyperthyroidism. The TBG was increased in all cases, as expected in pregnancy. The T 3 resin uptake was low in 4 of the 6 hyperthyroid cases, while the T 4 was evevated in all 6 cases. As measured by RIA, each of the 6 hyperthyroid women had high values of T 3 (greater than 3 ng/ml). The ETR was elevated in all 6 patients. The hTSH was normal in the 14 cases of mole pregnancy. After removal of the mole, the hTSH slightly rose in the 6 previously hyperthyroid cases. The hCG lev-', was high in all 14 individuals, due to the molar pregnancy. However, it was not significantly higher in the 6 patients with clinical hyperthyroidism. There was not a direct correlation between the level of hCG and the degree of hyperthyroidism. The hCG fell to zero after removal of the mole. We conclude that a significant portion (6 / 14) of women with mole pregnancy in Iran have clinical evidence of hyperthyroidism. This does not directly correlate with the total hCG level, but might be related to individual variability in the TSH-like effects of hCG or in sensitivity of the thyrotropin effects of hCG...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Trophoblast {{dysfunction}} is a {{major factor}} in defect placentation, which is thought to be an important etiology of abortions. Homeobox genes are transcription factors that regulate the transcription of other genes. They encode highly conserved DNA-binding domains (homeodomains) that regulate proliferation, differentiation and migration, important for pattern formation and organogenesis during embryogenesis in the development of multicellular organisms. Homeobox genes have also been shown to control normal development of the placenta. They are thought {{to play an important role}} in trophoblast proliferation and differentiation. Chloride channels are important in many cellular processes like electrolyte transport, pH regulation, water balance, cell potensials and apoptosis. Little is known about their involvement in trophoblasts and placentation. Our thesis consists of a literature review related to placenta, placentation, trophoblasts, homeobox genes, ion channel proteins and abortion. It also comprises a pilot study testing our hypothesis: that spontaneous/missed abortions and <b>hydatiform</b> <b>mole</b> are consequences of defect trophoblast function and signalling of homeobox genes in trophoblasts in the placental bed. We also studied the expression of an intracellular ion channel gene called CLIC 3. The pilot study was performed on a diagnostic material from first trimester abortions, partly in Oslo and partly at the Pregnancy Research Centre at the University of Melbourne. Material: Tissue micro arrays (TMAs) from the placental bed in normal (therapeutic abortions) and abnormal (spontaneous and missed abortions and moles) first trimester pregnancies. Methods: Immunohistochemical study of expression of the homeobox genes TGIF and HEX and the intracellular ion channel CLIC 3. Results: There was a reduction in the expression of Homeobox genes TGIF and HEX and of the ion channel protein CLIC 3 in the extravillous trophoblasts in the placental bed in the clinical abortions as compared to the normal controls (therapeutic abortions). The reduced expression was most markedly for HEX in missed abortions. The findings might indicate a defect trophoblast function in clinical first trimester abortions. The staining pattern in the positive cells varied, especially in the homeobox immunostainings. Further studies are needed...|$|E
30|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to detect the relation between serum progesterone and viability of pregnancy during the first trimester. Prospective study carried out in Al-Rashid Maternity and Ahmadi Kuwait oil company hospitals, over three years from February 2009 to February 2012. Two hundred and Sixty (260) pregnant women were hospitalized due to vaginal bleeding and/or abdominal pain during the first trimester of their pregnancies and were included in this study. Women included in this study were; sure of dates, conceived spontaneously with no history of infertility and had a positive serum pregnancy test. 2 ml blood samples were taken for women included in this study for serum progesterone assay. Women included in this study were followed by ultrasound for the viability of the pregnancy till the end of first trimester and the outcome of their pregnancy were recorded, while women with exogenous progesterone support or multiple pregnancies or suspected ectopic pregnancy or <b>Hydatiform</b> <b>mole</b> were excluded from this study. Data were collected and statistically analyzed to detect the relationship between serum progesterone level and viability of pregnancy during the first trimester. The mean age of the studied population was 32.7 [*]±[*] 5.1 years, the mean gestational age at progesterone assay was 9.7 [*]±[*] 0.5 week {{and by the end of}} the first trimester, women included in this study were classified according to the viability of their pregnancies into; viable pregnancy group 178 (68.5 %) cases and non-viable pregnancy group (ended by miscarriage) 82 (31.5 %) cases. The mean serum progesterone of the studied population was significantly high in viable pregnancy group (46.5 [*]±[*] 7.4 ng/ml) compared to non-viable pregnancy group (9.9 [*]±[*] 4.8 ng/ml), (p < 0.05). In this study; 6.7 % of viable pregnancies had serum progesterone level < 10 ng/ ml, while 20.7 % of non-viable pregnancies had serum progesterone level > 10 ng/ml, the serum progesterone at cut off level 10 ng/ml was 79.3 % sensitive to diagnose non-viable pregnancy and was 93.3 % specific to diagnose viable pregnancy. Also, in this study; 1.1 % of viable pregnancies had serum progesterone level < 20 ng/ ml, while 4.8 % of non-viable pregnancies had serum progesterone level > 20 ng/ml, the serum progesterone at cut off level 20 ng/ml was 95.1 % sensitive to diagnose non-viable pregnancy and was 98.9 % specific to diagnose viable pregnancy. Serum progesterone is a reliable marker for early pregnancy failure and single assay of its serum level can differentiate between viable and non-viable pregnancies.|$|E
40|$|Na mulher, a {{principal}} fonte de inibina B são as células da granulosa de folículos em crescimento, enquanto a inibina A é secretad{{a principal}}mente pelo corpo lúteo e pela placenta. Em mulheres inférteis submetidas a terapias de reprodução assistida, a inibina B se mostrou útil para predizer má resposta ovulatória, embora não tenha superado o desempenho de outros marcadores. No rastreamento pré-natal da síndrome de Down, a utilidade da inibina A foi repetidamente confirmada no segundo trimestre e começa a ser considerada também na bateria de testes do primeiro trimestre. Além das duas aplicações acima, a dosagem de inibina total pode contribuir para a identificação de casos de insuficiência ovariana autoimune. A inibina total também pode ser um marcador auxiliar no diagnóstico de tumores epiteliais do ovário, enquanto a dosagem de inibina B auxilia no diagnóstico de tumores de células da granulosa. O uso da inibina A pode se estender à avaliação de gestantes com ameaça de abortamento, com história de abortamento de repetição, com risco aumentado de pré-eclâmpsia, ou ainda nos primeiros dias de seguimento pós-esvaziamento de mola hidatiforme. Todas essas aplicações continuam em estudo, mas com possibilidade real de virem a ampliar o espectro diagnóstico das dosagens de inibinas em Ginecologia e Obstetrícia. The {{main source of}} inhibin B in women is the growing follicle granulosa cells, while inhibin A is mainly produced by the corpus luteum and the placenta. In infertile women submitted to therapies of assisted reproduction, inhibin B has shown to be useful to predict a poor ovulatory response, though {{it has not yet}} overcome the performance of other markers. In the pre-natal screening of the Down syndrome, inhibin A has been repeatedly confirmed as useful in the second trimester and has also started to be considered in the first trimester test battery. Besides the two applications above, the dosage of total inhibin may contribute to the identification of cases of autoimmune ovarian insufficiency. Total inhibin may also be an auxiliary marker in the diagnosis of ovarian epithelial tumors, while the amount of inhibin B helps in the diagnosis of granulosa cells tumors. The use of inhibin A may be extended to the evaluation of pregnant women with risk of abortion, with a history of repeated abortion, with increased risk of pre-eclampsia, or even in the first days of follow-up of <b>hydatiform</b> <b>mole</b> post-emptying. All those applications are still under study, but with a real possibility of helping to extend the diagnostic spectrum of inhibin dosage in Gynecology and Obstetrics...|$|E
