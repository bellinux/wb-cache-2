40|$|Worldwide {{demand for}} energy is {{increasing}} rapidly, partly driven by dramatic {{economic growth in}} developing countries. This growth has sparked concerns over the finite availability of fossil fuels {{and the impact of}} their combustion on climate change. Consequently, many recent research efforts have been devoted to the development of renewable fuels and sustainable energy systems. Interest in liquid biofuels, such as ethanol, has been particularly high because these fuels fit into the conventional infrastructure for the transportation sector. 	Ethanol is a renewable fuel produced through the anaerobic fermentation of sugars obtained from biomass. However, the relatively high energy demand of its production process is a major factor limiting the usefulness of ethanol as a fuel. Due to the dilute nature of the fermentation product stream and the presence of the ethanol-water azeotrope, the separation processes currently used to recover anhydrous ethanol are particularly inefficient. In fact, the ethanol separation processes account for a large fraction of the total process energy demand. 	In the conventional ethanol separation process, ethanol is recovered using several distillation steps combined with a dehydration process. In this dissertation, a new hybrid pervaporation-distillation system, named Membrane <b>Dephlegmation,</b> was proposed and investigated for use in ethanol recovery. In this process, countercurrent vapour-liquid contacting is carried out on the surface of a pervaporation membrane, leading to a combination of distillation and pervaporation effects. It was intended that this new process would lead to improved economics and energy efficiency for the entire ethanol production process. 	The Membrane <b>Dephlegmation</b> process was investigated using both numerical and experimental techniques. Multiphase Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) was used to study vapour-liquid contacting behaviour in narrow channels and to estimate heat and mass transfer rates. Results from the CFD studies were incorporated into a simplified design model and the Membrane <b>Dephlegmation</b> process was studied numerically. The results indicated that the Membrane <b>Dephlegmation</b> process was more efficient than simple distillation and that the ethanol-water azeotrope could be broken. Subsequently, a pilot-scale experimental system was constructed using commercially available, hydrophilic NaA zeolite membranes. Results obtained from the experimental system confirmed the accuracy of the simulations...|$|E
40|$|A {{mathematical}} model of <b>dephlegmation</b> processes (i. e. of partial condensation with countercurrent flow of rising vapour and falling condensate) {{has been proposed}} {{and the results of}} the simulation have been compared with those of five series of experimental runs carried out with two different binary systems. The agreement between calculated and measured values of the variables (compositions, temperatures, heat transfer surface) has been found satisfactory. Moreover, the extent of the rectification obtained from the experimental runs is generally small and appears to be slightly sensitive to both the temperature and the flow rate of the coolant...|$|E
