5000|$|A {{disc filter}} {{is a type}} of water filter used {{primarily}} in irrigation, similar to a screen filter, except that the filter cartridge is made of a number of plastic discs stacked {{on top of each other}} like a pile of poker chips. Each disc is covered with small grooves or bumps. The discs (or rings) each have a hole in the middle, forming a hollow cylinder in the middle of the stack. The water passes through the small passages in between and the impurities are trapped behind. The filtration quality is based on the quantity and size of particles that the <b>filtering</b> <b>element</b> is able to retain. Higher quality filtration simply means cleaner water. This depends on the geometry of the channels, including the size, length, angle, and number of generated intersection points. [...] The discs are typically color coded to denote the level of filtration. [...] Filtration quality is usually measured in microns, based on the smallest size particle filtered. The typical range is from 25 microns for the finest level of filtration to 400 microns for the coarsest. [...] Sometimes the filtration quality is given as the equivalent mesh size of a comparable screen filter. Typical mesh sizes range from 40 to 600. [...] When using mesh sizes, 40 is the coarsest and 600 is the finest or highest level of filtration.|$|E

Min-filters are the basic building blocks for translation invariant morphological operators, which are used to perform operations such as noise suppression, image smoothing, contrast enhancement, and edge detection. Min-filters are a special case of min-convolutions, which are used {{for a variety of}} applications, including signal processing, and com-binatorial optimization. The most widely used approach for computing min-filters decomposes the <b>filtering</b> <b>element</b> as a Minkowsky sum of smaller filters.

We present an efficient algorithm to compute the min-filter when the <b>filtering</b> <b>element</b> is a polygon for certain polygons. Because the polygon will be given as a non digital geometric object, we relax the conditions by allowing the algorithm to choose a valid digitization of the polygon for each placement.

40|$|Two advanced, hot gas, {{barrier filter}} system {{concepts}} {{have been proposed}} by the Siemens Westinghouse Power Corporation to improve the reliability and availability of barrier filter systems in applications such as PFBC and IGCC power generation. The two hot gas, barrier filter system concepts, the inverted candle filter system and the sheet filter system, were the focus of bench-scale testing, data evaluations, and commercial cost evaluations to assess their feasibility as viable barrier filter systems. The program {{results show that the}} inverted candle filter system has high potential to be a highly reliable, commercially successful, hot gas, barrier filter system. Some types of thin-walled, standard candle <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> can be used directly as inverted candle <b>filter</b> <b>elements,</b> {{and the development of a}} new type of <b>filter</b> <b>element</b> is not a requirement of this technology. Six types of inverted candle <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> were procured and assessed in the program in cold flow and high-temperature test campaigns. The thin-walled McDermott 610 CFCC inverted candle <b>filter</b> <b>elements,</b> and the thin-walled Pall iron aluminide inverted candle <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> are the best candidates for demonstration of the technology. Although the capital cost of the inverted candle filter system is estimated to range from about 0 to 15 % greater than the capital cost of the standard candle filter system, the operating cost and life-cycle cost of the inverted candle filter system is expected to be superior to that of the standard candle filter system. Improved hot gas, barrier filter system availability will result in improved overall power plant economics. The inverted candle filter system is recommended for continued development through larger-scale testing in a coal-fueled test facility, and inverted candle containment equipment has been fabricated and shipped to a gasifier development site for potential future testing. Two types of sheet <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> were procured and assessed in the program through cold flow and high-temperature testing. The Blasch, mullite-bonded alumina sheet <b>filter</b> <b>element</b> is the only candidate currently approaching qualification for demonstration, although this oxide-based, monolithic sheet <b>filter</b> <b>element</b> may be restricted to operating temperatures of 538 C (1000 F) or less. Many other types of ceramic and intermetallic sheet <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> could be fabricated. The estimated capital cost of the sheet filter system is comparable to the capital cost of the standard candle filter system, although this cost estimate is very uncertain because the commercial price of sheet <b>filter</b> <b>element</b> manufacturing has not been established. The development of the sheet filter system could result in a higher reliability and availability than the standard candle filter system, but not as high as that of the inverted candle filter system. The sheet filter system has not reached the same level of development as the inverted candle filter system, and it will require more design development, <b>filter</b> <b>element</b> fabrication development, small-scale testing and evaluation before larger-scale testing could be recommended...|$|R

40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} to study the aerodynamic thermal regeneration of a metallic fibrous particulate filter, which was used to reduce particulate emissions from diesel vehicles. Heated air diluted with nitrogen was used to initiate the regeneration process. Temperatures at 11 locations inside the filter were measured with embedded thermocouples which were equally spaced in the axial direction. Based on the temperature data, the instantaneous heat release of the filter was derived and analyzed. The peak regeneration temperature was found to occur at the region near the filter exit, and fibers in this region could melt when the temperature was sufficiently high. The normal regeneration temperature was around 800 °C to 1000 °C but local temperature {{could be as high}} as 1300 °C. Thermal regeneration of the filter was found to depend on several factors, including, oxygen concentration in the heated air, initial particulate loading, packing density, thickness of the <b>filtering</b> <b>element,</b> and flow rate of the heated air. It was found that for regeneration to occur, the temperature of the heated air should exceed 500 °C, the <b>filtering</b> <b>element</b> should have a minimum thickness of 50 mm and a minimum initial particulate loading of 2 gram. Regeneration, and hence, heat release, was found to start earlier at higher oxygen concentration in the heated air, higher heated air flow rate, lower packing density and higher initial particulate loading. Regeneration temperature was higher at higher oxygen concentration in the heated air, lower heated air flow-rate, higher packing density and higher initial particulate loading.
