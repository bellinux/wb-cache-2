5|$|Fasting {{is a risk}} factor, {{possibly}} because of depletion of liver glutathione reserves. The concomitant use of the CYP2E1 inhibitor isoniazid {{increases the risk of}} <b>hepatotoxicity,</b> though whether 2E1 induction is related to the <b>hepatotoxicity</b> in this case is unclear. Concomitant use of other drugs that induce CYP enzymes, such as antiepileptics including carbamazepine, phenytoin, and barbiturates, have also been reported as risk factors.|$|E

5|$|Calcium carbimide {{works in}} the same way as disulfiram; it has an {{advantage}} in that the occasional adverse effects of disulfiram, <b>hepatotoxicity</b> and drowsiness, do not occur with calcium carbimide.|$|E
5|$|Clinical or {{biochemical}} {{evidence of}} liver toxicity may develop in {{one to four}} days, although, in severe cases, it may be evident in 12hours. Right-upper-quadrant tenderness may be present and can aid in diagnosis. Laboratory studies may show evidence of liver necrosis with elevated AST, ALT, bilirubin, and prolonged coagulation times, particularly an elevated prothrombin time. After paracetamol overdose, when AST and ALT exceed 1000IU/L, paracetamol-induced <b>hepatotoxicity</b> can be diagnosed. In some cases, the AST and ALT levels can exceed 10,000IU/L.|$|E
5|$|RNAi in vivo {{delivery}} to tissues still eludes science—especially to tissues {{deep within the}} body. RNAi delivery is only easily accessible to surface tissues such as the eye and respiratory tract. In these instances, siRNA {{has been used in}} direct contact with the tissue for transport. The resulting RNAi successfully focused on target genes. When delivering siRNA to deep tissues, the siRNA must be protected from nucleases, but targeting specific areas becomes the main difficulty. This difficulty has been combatted with high dosage levels of siRNA to ensure the tissues have been reached, however in these cases <b>hepatotoxicity</b> was reported.|$|E
5|$|A person's {{history of}} taking {{paracetamol}} is somewhat accurate for the diagnosis. The {{most effective way}} to diagnose poisoning is by obtaining a blood paracetamol level. A drug nomogram developed in 1975, called the Rumack-Matthew nomogram, estimates the risk of toxicity based on the serum concentration of paracetamol at a given number of hours after ingestion. To determine the risk of potential <b>hepatotoxicity,</b> the paracetamol level is traced along the nomogram. Use of a timed serum paracetamol level plotted on the nomogram appears to be the best marker indicating the potential for liver injury. A paracetamol level drawn in the first four hours after ingestion may underestimate the amount in the system because paracetamol may still be {{in the process of being}} absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, a serum level taken before 4hours is not recommended.|$|E
5|$|Acetylcysteine, {{also called}} N-acetylcysteine or NAC, works to reduce {{paracetamol}} toxicity by replenishing body stores of the antioxidant glutathione. Glutathione reacts with the toxic NAPQI metabolite {{so that it}} does not damage cells and can be safely excreted. NAC was usually given following a treatment nomogram (one for patients with risk factors, and one for those without) but the use of the nomogram is no longer recommended as the evidence base to support the use of risk factors was poor and inconsistent and many of the risk factors are imprecise and difficult to determine with sufficient certainty in clinical practice. Cysteamine and methionine have also been used to prevent <b>hepatotoxicity,</b> although studies show that both are associated with more adverse effects than acetylcysteine. Additionally, acetylcysteine {{has been shown to be}} a more effective antidote, particularly in patients presenting greater than 8 hours post-ingestion.|$|E
5|$|If {{the patient}} {{presents}} {{less than eight}} hours after paracetamol overdose, then acetylcysteine significantly {{reduces the risk of}} serious <b>hepatotoxicity</b> and guarantees survival. If acetylcysteine is started more than 8hours after ingestion, there is a sharp decline in its effectiveness because the cascade of toxic events in the liver has already begun, and the risk of acute liver necrosis and death increases dramatically. Although acetylcysteine is most effective if given early, it still has beneficial effects if given as late as 48hours after ingestion. In clinical practice, if the patient presents more than eight hours after the paracetamol overdose, then activated charcoal is not useful, and acetylcysteine is started immediately. In earlier presentations, charcoal can be given when the patient arrives and acetylcysteine is initiated while waiting for the paracetamol level results to return from the laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Paracetamol ester prodrug with L-pyroglutamic acid (PCA), a biosynthetic {{precursor}} of glutathione, has been synthesized to reduce paracetamol <b>hepatotoxicity</b> and improve bioavailability. The toxicological studies of different paracetamol esters show that L-5-oxo-pyrrolidine-2-paracetamol carboxylate reduces toxicity after administration of {{an overdose of}} paracetamol to mice. The liver glutathione values in mice induced by intraperitoneal injection of the ester are superimposable with the GSH levels recorded in untreated mice control group. The mice group treated with an equivalent dose of paracetamol showed a significative decrease of glutathione of 35% (p<0.01 vs untreated control group). The oral LD50 {{was found to be}} greater than 2000 mg kg-1, whereas the intraperitoneal LD50 was 1900 mg kg-1. These results taken together with the good hydrolysis and bioavailability data show that this ester is a potential candidate as a prodrug of paracetamol.|$|E
5|$|Reports {{of severe}} and even fatal <b>hepatotoxicity</b> {{related to the}} use of {{methoxyflurane}} began to appear in 1966. These reports prompted anesthesiologists to subject this agent to intense and systematic scrutiny. A study published in 1973 by Cousins and Mazze demonstrated that compared with halothane, methoxyflurane produces dose-dependent and deleterious abnormalities in renal function. The authors showed that subclinical nephrotoxicity occurred following methoxyflurane at minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) for 2.5 to 3hours (2.5 to 3MAC hours), while overt toxicity was present in all patients at dosages greater than five MAC hours. This landmark study provided a model that would be used for the assessment of the nephrotoxicity of volatile anesthetics for the next two decades.|$|E
5|$|The {{toxic dose}} of {{paracetamol}} is highly variable. In general the recommended maximum daily dose for healthy adults is 4grams. Higher doses lead to increasing risk of toxicity. In adults, single doses above 10grams or 200mg/kg of bodyweight, whichever is lower, {{have a reasonable}} likelihood of causing toxicity. Toxicity can also occur when multiple smaller doses within 24hours exceed these levels. Following a normal dose of 1gram of paracetamol {{four times a day}} for two weeks, patients can expect an increase in alanine transaminase in their liver to typically about three times the normal value. It is unlikely that this dose would lead to liver failure. Studies have shown significant <b>hepatotoxicity</b> is uncommon in patients who have taken greater than normal doses over 3 to 4 days. In adults, a dose of 6grams a day over the preceding 48hours could potentially lead to toxicity, while in children acute doses above 200mg/kg could potentially cause toxicity. Acute paracetamol overdose in children rarely causes illness or death, and it is very uncommon for children to have levels that require treatment, with chronic larger-than-normal doses being the major cause of toxicity in children.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to oral activity, 17α-alkylation also confers a high potential for <b>hepatotoxicity,</b> and all 17α-alkylated AAS have been associated, albeit uncommonly {{and only after}} prolonged use (different estimates between 1 and 17%), with <b>hepatotoxicity.</b> In contrast, testosterone esters have only extremely rarely or never been associated with <b>hepatotoxicity,</b> and other non-17α-alkylated AAS only rarely, although long-term use may reportedly still {{increase the risk of}} hepatic changes (but at a much lower rate than 17α-alkylated AAS and reportedly not at replacement dosages).

25|$|Plaa's primary area of {{research}} was <b>hepatotoxicity,</b> in which his successes where achieved primarily by the investigation of mechanistic toxicology. His primary contributions were {{in the areas of}} cholestasis and toxic potentiation, in particular potentiation by haloalkanes. Although the use of the isolated perfused liver was already well-known, having been first used in the early 19th century, Plaa was the first to use it for the study of <b>hepatotoxicity.</b> A long-time career goal for him was to elaborate methods to determine human <b>hepatotoxicity</b> (and particularly cholestasis-inducing abilities in drugs) from animal tests; although this endeavour was never a success, it led to a much improved understanding of the mechanisms of cholestasis. According to Plaa, much of his mechanisms- and protocols-oriented research was an effect of his original formation in criminalistics.|$|E

25|$|Methyltestosterone {{should be}} used with caution in women and children, as it can cause {{irreversible}} virilization. Due to its estrogenicity, methyltestosterone can also accelerate epiphyseal closure and thereby produce short stature in children and adolescents. It can worsen symptoms in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia. Methyltestosterone {{should not be used}} in men with prostate cancer, as androgens can accelerate tumor progression.

25|$|Idiosyncratic (type B) injury occurs without warning, when agents cause non-predictable <b>hepatotoxicity</b> in {{susceptible}} individuals, {{which is}} not related to dose and has a variable latency period. This type of injury does not have a clear dose-response nor temporal relationship, and most often does not have predictive models. Idiosyncratic <b>hepatotoxicity</b> has led to the withdrawal of several drugs from market even after rigorous clinical testing as part of the FDA approval process; Troglitazone (Rezulin) and trovafloxacin (Trovan) are two prime examples of idiosyncratic hepatotoxins pulled from market.|$|E
25|$|Pioneered by Imperial Chemical Industries in Britain, its {{development}} {{was hailed as}} an anesthetic revolution. Originally thought to possess less <b>hepatotoxicity</b> than chloroform, and without the unpleasant pungency and flammability of ether, TCE use was nonetheless soon found to have several pitfalls. These included promotion of cardiac arrhythmias, low volatility and high solubility preventing quick anesthetic induction, reactions with soda lime used in carbon dioxide absorbing systems, prolonged neurologic dysfunction when used with soda lime, and evidence of <b>hepatotoxicity</b> as had been found with chloroform.|$|E
25|$|To avoid its toxic {{adverse effects}} Xanthium sibiricum must be processed. <b>Hepatotoxicity</b> has been {{reported}} with products containing Polygonum multiflorum, glycyrrhizin, Senecio and Symphytum. The herbs indicated as being hepatotoxic included Dictamnus dasycarpus, Astragalus membranaceous, and Paeonia lactiflora. Contrary to popular belief, Ganoderma lucidum mushroom extract, as an adjuvant for cancer immunotherapy, appears to {{have the potential for}} toxicity. A 2013 review suggested that although the antimalarial herb Artemisia annua may not cause <b>hepatotoxicity,</b> haematotoxicity, or hyperlipidemia, it should be used cautiously during pregnancy due to a potential risk of embryotoxicity at a high dose.|$|E

25|$|NSAAs {{may be an}} {{appealing}} option for {{those who wish to}} preserve sex drive and function and/or fertility, as well as for those who desire more selective action with fewer side effects than spironolactone and cyproterone acetate (which increase the risk of depressive symptoms, among other adverse effects). Bicalutamide specifically may also be a safer drug than cyproterone acetate or spironolactone, as it has a much lower risk of <b>hepatotoxicity</b> relative to cyproterone acetate and, unlike spironolactone, has no risk of hyperkalemia or other antimineralocorticoid-associated adverse reactions. However, bicalutamide does have a very small risk of <b>hepatotoxicity</b> itself, as well as of interstitial pneumonitis.|$|E
25|$|Cimetidine has a {{theoretical}} but unproven benefit in paracetamol toxicity. This is because N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), a metabolite of paracetamol (acetaminophen) {{that is responsible}} for its <b>hepatotoxicity,</b> is formed from it by the cytochrome P450 system (specifically, CYP1A2, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4).|$|E
25|$|<b>Hepatotoxicity</b> and drug-induced liver injury {{account for}} a {{substantial}} number of failures of new drugs in development and market withdrawal, highlighting the need for screening assays such as stem cell-derived hepatocyte-like cells, that are capable of detecting toxicity early in the drug development process.|$|E
25|$|Gastrointestinal complaints, such as indigestion, {{nausea and}} liver failure, {{have also been}} reported. <b>Hepatotoxicity</b> is {{possibly}} related to metabolism via amidation resulting in NAD production.

25|$|Due to its {{combined}} {{disadvantages of}} a relatively poor ratio of anabolic to androgenic activity, unusually high estrogenicity, {{and the potential for}} <b>hepatotoxicity</b> (as with other 17α-alkylated AAS), methyltestosterone has not been used as commonly as many other AAS either in medicine or for physique- or performance-enhancing purposes.|$|E
