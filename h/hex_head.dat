50|$|BA threads are {{extensively}} used in Model Engineering {{where the}} smaller <b>hex</b> <b>head</b> sizes make scale fastenings easier to represent. As a result, many UK Model Engineering suppliers still carry stocks of BA fasteners up to typically 8BA and 10BA. 5BA is also commonly {{used as it}} can be threaded onto 1/8 rod.|$|E
5000|$|Soon after SPS {{had begun}} {{producing}} the <b>hex</b> socket <b>head</b> set screw, Hallowell {{had the idea}} to make a <b>hex</b> socket <b>head</b> cap screw (SHCS). Hallowell said, [...] "Up to this moment {{none of us had}} ever seen a socket head cap screw, and what I am about to relate concerns what I believe was the first socket head cap screw ever made in this country U.S.." [...] SPS gave their line of screws the Unbrako brand name, chosen for its echoing of the word [...]|$|R
50|$|A {{possible}} {{distinction is}} that a screw is designed to cut its own thread; it has no need for access from or exposure {{to the opposite side}} of the component being fastened to. This definition of screw is further reinforced by the consideration of the developments of fasteners such as Tek Screws, with either round or <b>hex</b> <b>heads,</b> for roof cladding, self-drilling and self-tapping screws for various metal fastening applications, roof batten screws to reinforce the connection between the roof batten and the rafter, decking screws etc.On the other hand, a bolt is the male part of a fastener system designed to be accepted by a pre-equipped socket (or nut) of exactly the same thread design.|$|R

The CSG China Lake launchers have additional manufacturing to increase {{reliability of the}} China Lake Grenade Launcher cycling of action. CSG also replaced most flat <b>headed</b> screws to <b>hex</b> <b>headed</b> screws, the butt stock recoil pads are solid instead of the ventilated on the CSG launchers, no sling studs or swivels were installed initially on the CSG launchers. Manufacturing Metals were upgraded with hardness treatment and improved metallurgy since the original China Lake with both the Airtronic/Trident and CSG receivers and parts. Total number of privately owned China Lake launchers accounted for inside the United States is 16.|$|R
5000|$|On HST {{some parts}} were {{designed}} {{from the start}} as ORUs (and all used captive bolts with a standard 7/16" [...] double height <b>hex</b> <b>head),</b> later when {{it was decided to}} avoid returning HST to earth for repair, more systems and modules were designated as ORUs (but these use a wider variety of fasteners).|$|E
5000|$|A {{security}} {{version of}} the <b>hex</b> <b>head</b> includes a pin in the center. These fasteners {{are said to have}} a [...] "center pin reject" [...] feature to prevent standard hex wrenches from working. A special driver must be used to fasten or remove these fasteners. The TORX head's security variant also has such a pin for the same reason.|$|E
5000|$|For the Torx type of design, {{the angle}} is {{much closer to}} 90º than {{in the case of}} the <b>hex</b> <b>head,</b> and so for a given torque the {{potentially}} damaging radial force is much lower. This property allows the head of the fastener to be smaller for the same required torque, which can be an advantage in applications where space to accommodate the head is limited.|$|E
50|$|Square {{heads and}} sockets were {{the easiest to}} make in the era when hand filing was the typical method of manufacture. With the {{proliferation}} of modern manufacturing methods, such as milling, shaping, broaching, and advanced die forging, it became just as easy to make <b>hex</b> <b>heads</b> and sockets as square ones. The hex form allows easier wrenching in confined surroundings (where nearby obstacles obstruct the swing of the wrench), because fewer degrees of arc are needed on each swing before it is possible to reposition the wrench onto the next set of flats. Ratchet wrenches further reduce this problem, as the wrench need only swing as many degrees as it takes for the ratchet pawl to catch the next tooth.|$|R
5000|$|Wrenches in {{the form}} of —that is, a female driver to envelop the male head of a fastener—have existed for centuries. Early {{examples}} include the keys used to wind clocks since the Middle Ages. The heads and sockets were typically square; <b>hex</b> <b>heads</b> eventually became more common starting in the 20th century. The ratcheting socket wrench, with interchangeable (indexable) sockets, was invented by an American, J.J. Richardson, of Woodstock, Vermont, USA. The tool was patented (Pat. No. 38,914) through the Scientific American Patent Agency on June 16, 1863. The first illustration of the tool appears on pg. 248 of the April 16, 1864 issue of Scientific American. In current English usage, the term [...] "socket wrench" [...] connotes indexable sockets so strongly that most English speakers would resist calling a large non-indexable, non-racheting, socket-head wrench a [...] "socket wrench." ...|$|R
50|$|Shaft collars saw few {{improvements}} until 1910 through 1911, when William G. Allen and Howard T. Hallowell, Sr, working independently, introduced {{commercially viable}} <b>hex</b> socket <b>head</b> set screws, and Hallowell patented a shaft collar with this safety-style set screw. His safety set collar {{was soon copied}} by others and became an industry standard. The invention of the safety set collar {{was the beginning of}} the recessed-socket screw industry.|$|R
5000|$|The {{pitch of}} 0BA is 1 mm and {{the pitch of}} each higher {{numbered}} thread is obtained by multiplying the pitch of the lower number by 0.9 so K-BA has a pitch of [...] rounded to two significant figures in mm. The major diameter is given by , rounded to two significant figures in mm and the <b>hex</b> <b>head</b> size (across the flats) is 1.75 times the major diameter.|$|E
50|$|The #6-32 UNC is a thicker screw {{with a more}} coarse thread. This {{makes it}} more {{suitable}} for fastening larger parts and thicker materials requiring increased holding strength. Its larger size and coarse thread {{make it easier to}} work with during assembly, with less risk of cross threading. The integrated flange provides greater holding strength with less risk of pull through. The <b>hex</b> <b>head</b> makes it easier to work with during assembly with powered torque screwdrivers.|$|E
5000|$|Screw-in insert nuts have an {{external}} thread and <b>hex</b> <b>head</b> and are screwed {{in with a}} Flat Blade Screwdriver or an Allen wrench. The screw-in insert nuts come in various sizes and take different screw sizes. For example, a [...] "1/4-20" [...] insert nut will take a 1/4-20 inch bolt. The pre-drilled hole must be as deep as {{the length of the}} insert nut plus any portion of the bolt that may be screwed past the end of the nut in the work piece.|$|E
50|$|The Torx design {{allows for}} a higher torque to be exerted than a {{similarly}} sized conventional <b>hex</b> socket <b>head</b> without damaging the head and/or the tool. The diagram on the right depicts {{the interaction between the}} male and female components of a conventional hex drive and a Torx drive. The clearance between the components is exaggerated for clarity. The diagram does not show a true Torx profile, but illustrates the general shape and geometry.|$|R
5000|$|These {{fasteners}} are [...] "screws" [...] {{according to}} the Machinery's Handbook criteria, and the obsolescent term [...] "lag bolt" [...] {{has been replaced by}} [...] "lag screw" [...] in the Handbook. However, {{in the minds of many}} tradesmen, they are [...] "bolts", simply because they are large, with <b>hex</b> or square <b>heads.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Hex</b> {{socket screw}} <b>heads</b> are usually made by {{stamping}} {{the head with}} a die, plastically deforming the metal. Other ways to generate the hex socket include linear broaching and rotary broaching. Broaching the heads with a linear broach is essentially the metalworking analog of mortising wood with a mortising machine; a hole is drilled and then the corners are broached out. This operation often leaves little telltale curled chips still attached {{at the bottom of the}} socket. These are negligible for most applications.|$|R
50|$|The {{hand tool}} {{used to drive}} in most screws is called a screwdriver. A power tool that does the same job is a power screwdriver; power drills may also be used with {{screw-driving}} attachments. Where the holding power of the screwed joint is critical, torque-measuring and torque-limiting screwdrivers are used to ensure sufficient but not excessive force is developed by the screw. The hand tool for driving <b>hex</b> <b>head</b> threaded fasteners is a spanner (UK usage) or wrench (US usage), while a nut setter is used with a power screw driver.|$|E
50|$|They {{are almost}} always {{provided}} with a #2 Phillips drive. Sometimes a Torx drive is used instead. Both Phillips and Torx patterns may also be combined with a slot for a flat-blade screwdriver. Usually they are provided with a 1/4 in (0.25 in) flanged <b>hex</b> <b>head.</b> Non-standard metricized 5.5 mm flanged hex heads can also be encountered. Also common are pan head screws - a low disk with a chamfered outer edge. Because they are used in places where high torque is not required and easy removal and replacement may be desirable (such as on the side panels of the PC case), they are frequently available as thumbscrews with larger, knurled heads that can be removed with one's fingers or tools.|$|E
50|$|The {{manual system}} uses a screw {{that has a}} {{standard}} <b>hex</b> <b>head</b> or square head and is driven using an allen key or wrench. A manual knockout punch can handle holes from 0.5 to 1.25 in. The ratchet system has a custom ratcheting wrench that uses a ball screw to make the process faster and easier. This type of system has a mechanical advantage of approximately 220:1 and can punch holes up to 3 in in diameter in 10 gauge mild steel. A hydraulic system is much bulkier and heavier than the other systems {{but it is the}} easiest to use and can make holes up to 6 in in diameter. It is a two piece system where the dies are attached to the ram which is connected to the hydraulic unit via a flexible hose.|$|E
5000|$|In his autobiography, {{the founder}} of the Standard Pressed Steel Company (SPS; now SPS Technologies, Inc.), Howard T. Hallowell Sr, {{presents}} a version of events in which SPS developed a hex socket drive in-house, independently of Allen, circa 1911. From this came the [...] line of products. This account from Hallowell does not mention the Allen patent of 1910, nor the Allen safety set screw product line. Hallowell does describe, however, the same inspiration also mentioned in connection with Allen for a wave of adoption of the <b>hex</b> socket <b>head,</b> beginning with set screws and followed by cap screws. This was an industrial safety campaign, part of the larger Progressive Movement, to get headless set screws onto the pulleys and shafts of the line shafting that was ubiquitous in factories of the day. The headless set screws {{would be less likely to}} catch the clothing of workers and pull them into injurious contact with the running shaft.|$|R
5000|$|Jonah Hex was {{inspired}} to become a bounty hunter after murdering his first criminal, the outlaw Lucas [...] "Mad Dog" [...] McGill. He gunned down Mad Dog while the man was beating his wife outside of a saloon; in his inebriated stupor, Hex believed him to be his own father, Woodson Hex, abusing his mother, Virginia Hex. The local deputy insisted that even drunk it was the fastest draw he'd ever seen, {{and gave him the}} massive bounty on McGill's <b>head.</b> <b>Hex</b> accepted the money and scattered it on the streets as he left town by horseback. His first bounty poster was in 1866 on an old army buddy named Eddie Cantwell. The manhunter Arbee Stoneham stole Hex's reward by murdering Cantwell and then humiliated him by taking his guns. Eight years later they met again while Hex was bringing down the Jason Crowley gang, and he intended to take revenge on Stoneham but found him wheelchair-ridden; the two men went for a drink instead.|$|R
40|$|A locking {{fastener}} assembly comprising a fastener having a shaft (12) {{and a head}} (14 or 114) and first threads (16) for placing the shaft (12) in tension to clamp a part (18). A threaded washer (20) has second threads (22) for disposition between the head (14 or 114) and the part (18). A torsion spring (24) reacts between the head (14 or 114) and the washer (20) for urging the head (14 or 114) and the washer (20) to rotate in opposite directions. The assembly {{is characterized by the}} first and second threads (22) being of different pitches and in the same helical direction whereby the torsion spring (24) continually rotates the washer (20) to maintain a pre-load on the shaft (12). To assemble the components, the <b>hex</b> <b>head</b> (14 or 114) is first torsionally loaded against the washer (20) utilizing the torsional spring (24) such that the components would rotate apart if the pre-load was removed. The <b>hex</b> <b>head</b> (14 or 114) and washer (20) are of the same polygonal (hexagonal) shape and are rotated together with a conventional socket type wrench disposed over both at the same time. The {{locking fastener}} assembly is then tightened as the head (14 or 114) and washer (20) are rotated together or in unison to the desired torque...|$|E
40|$|The HEXPANDO is an expanding-head {{hexagonal}} wrench designed to retain fasteners {{and keep them}} from being dislodged from the tool. The tool is intended to remove or install socket-head cap screws (SHCSs) in remote, hard-to-reach locations or in circumstances when a dropped fastener could cause damage to delicate or sensitive hardware. It is not intended for application of torque. This tool is made of two assembled portions. The first portion of the tool comprises tubing, or a hollow shaft, at a length that gives the user adequate reach to the intended location. At {{one end of the}} tubing is the expanding hexagonal head fitting with six radial slits cut into it (one at each of the points of the hexagonal shape), and a small hole drilled axially through the center and the end opposite the hex is internally and externally threaded. This fitting is threaded into the shaft (via external threads) and staked or bonded so that it will not loosen. At {{the other end of the}} tubing is a knurled collar with a through hole into which the tubing is threaded. This knob is secured in place by a stop nut. The second assembled portion of the tool comprises a length of all thread or solid rod that is slightly longer than the steel tubing. One end has a slightly larger knurled collar affixed while the other end is tapered/pointed and threaded. When the two portions are assembled, the all thread/rod portion feeds through the tubing and is threaded into the expanding <b>hex</b> <b>head</b> fitting. The tapered point allows it to be driven into the through hole of the hex fitting. While holding the smaller collar on the shaft, the user turns the larger collar, and as the threads feed into the fitting, the <b>hex</b> <b>head</b> expands and grips the SHCS, thus providing a safe way to install and remove fasteners. The clamping force retaining the SHCS varies depending on how far the tapered end is inserted into the tool head. Initial tests of the prototype tool, designed for a 5 mm or # 10 SHCS have resulted in up to 8 lb (. 35. 6 N) of pull force to dislodge the SHCS from the tool. The tool is designed with a lead-in angle from the diameter of the tubing to a diameter the same as the fastener head, to prevent the fastener head from catching on any obstructions encountered that could dislodge the fastener during retrieval...|$|E
