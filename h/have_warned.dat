5|$|No {{official}} {{action was}} taken: Ireland was exporting food to Britain at the time. Also, Paul Emrys-Evans {{revealed that the}} convoy knew about the U-boat; the British stance was that, as it already knew {{of the presence of}} both Irish Oak and U-607, {{there was no need for}} Irish Oak to <b>have</b> <b>warned</b> the convoy.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the rocks}} beneath the city {{contained}} a vast reservoir of fresh water, {{known as the}} Trarza Lake, it is running out, owing to the large growth of the city. Engineers <b>have</b> <b>warned</b> it could run out by 2054, since it is not rain-fed, and is therefore non-renewable. The problem is particularly bad in the sandy shanty towns {{where the majority of}} the population lives. Many people already have to buy water, which is expensive compared with the average wage.|$|E

Scientists <b>have</b> <b>warned</b> of the possibility, {{under the influence of}} climate change, of a sudden alteration in circulation patterns of ocean currents that could drastically alter the climate in some regions of the globe. Ten per cent of the world's population—about 600 million people—live in low-lying areas vulnerable to sea level rise.|$|E
5|$|United Airlines {{issued a}} {{statement}} saying it had begun installing the device on its fleet of DC-6 and DC-6B aircraft one week before the accident, having used it successfully in service on their fleet of Douglas DC-7 aircraft. A Martin bar had not yet been fitted on Mainliner Idaho. United Airlines also said a program had begun to install reverse thrust indicator lights on all their DC-6 and DC-6B aircraft. The signals, fitted in the cockpit of the aircraft, would <b>have</b> <b>warned</b> the flight crew that the thrust lever had been pulled back too far, and the propellers had been reversed.|$|E

Meanwhile, Lucan's children were taken by their aunt, Lady Sarah Gibbs, to her home in Guilsborough, Northamptonshire, where they would remain for several weeks. On the day Veronica Lucan was discharged from hospital, a High Court hearing confirmed that the children could return to live with her. Repeated press intrusions later forced the family to move to a friend's home in Plymouth.|$|E

5|$|On August 14, 2009, the National Transportation Safety Board {{released}} a report regarding the incident. The report discussed several aspects of the collision, including locations of origin of the aircraft, planned destination, and air traffic control communications. In addition, the report discussed how one of the controllers at Teterboro Airport was on a phone call and did not warn the airplane pilot of the potential conflict. The National Air Traffic Controller's Union (NATCA) then issued their own press release disputing some of the phrasing in the NTSB's report. The NTSB then retracted some of its statements regarding the controller's part in the crash, saying that the controller could not <b>have</b> <b>warned</b> the plane about the tour helicopter because the tour helicopter {{was not on the}} controller's radar. The NTSB also removed NATCA as a party to the investigation as a result of NATCA's press release, as parties to NTSB investigations agree to let the NTSB control publicity during the investigation. NATCA may still submit information to the board regarding the accident, but they will not hold a seat on the investigation board.|$|E
5|$|The Douglas Aircraft Company {{designed}} {{a system that}} would prevent the accidental reversal of propeller blades in-flight. During development of the DC-6, the company installed a system that cut electrical power to the mechanisms which rotated the blades while the airplane was in the air. When there was enough weight on the landing gear (which would only be the case when the aircraft was on the ground), a switch which supplied electrical power to the mechanisms was closedmeaning that when the aircraft touched down the blades could be reversed and thus the airplane could be slowed. When the switch was closed, a red flag would swing into view in the cockpit of the aircraft, warning the crew that the blades could be reversed. Should the switch fail to close upon landing, the flag could be raised manually and electrical power to the mechanisms would be restored. When the aircraft took off, electrical power would be cut to the mechanisms so that the propeller blades could not be inadvertently reversed, and the red flag swung out of sight. Reverse thrust warning lamps, which would <b>have</b> <b>warned</b> the crew if the propellers were reversed, were not fitted on Mainliner Idaho.|$|E
