Young as he was, the neighboring farmers liked his tough mode of living, enjoyed his old-fashioned and concise proverbs, and had a high regard for his abilities.

He was selected to act, sometimes as an arbitrator of disputes, and sometimes as a supporter in local causes, which were probably tried in front of recuperatores (the judges for causes of great public interest). Consequently, he was enabled to strengthen by practice his oratorical abilities, to gain self-confidence, to observe the manners of men, to analyze the diversity of <b>human</b> <b>nature,</b> <b>to</b> apply the rules of law, and to practically investigate the principles of justice.|$|E

2500|$|Irenaeus’ {{conception}} of salvation {{relies heavily on}} the understanding found in Paul’s letters.

Human nature has become joined with God’s {{in the person of}} Jesus, thus allowing <b>human</b> <b>nature</b> <b>to</b> have victory over sin.

Without such, Xunzi argued, man would act virtuelessly and be steered by his own <b>human</b> <b>nature</b> <b>to</b> commit immoral acts. Han Fei's education and life experience during the Warring States period, and in his own Han state, contributed his synthesis of a philosophy {{for the management of}} an amoral and interest-driven administration, to which morality seemed a loose and inefficient tool.

2500|$|A third {{theme in}} both Paul’s and Irenaeus’s conceptions of {{salvation}} is {{the sacrifice of}} Christ being necessary for the new life given to humanity in the triumph over evil. It is in this obedient sacrifice that Jesus is victor and reconciler, thus erasing the marks that Adam left on <b>human</b> <b>nature.</b> <b>To</b> argue against the Gnostics on this point, Irenaeus uses Colossians [...] in showing that the debt which came by a tree has been paid for us in another tree.
