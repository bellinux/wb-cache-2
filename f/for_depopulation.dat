40|$|By early 2000, {{the number}} of {{commercial}} livestock herds in Michigan with bovine tuberculosis (TB) had increased {{to the point that}} policy makers were considering alternative ways to enable farmers to continue production with access to markets while eliminating TB and protecting the public's health. If at least one animal on a farm is found to have TB, a farmer currently has two choices about the future assuming the goal is to stay in the livestock business. Alternative one is depopulation; all animals are removed to a state facility, slaughtered, and tested. A new herd may be purchased after a state supervised clean up and waiting period is completed; this may take one year. Alternative two is test and remove; a recurring series of testing is initiated, but only individual reactor or suspect animals are removed for slaughter and further testing. In both alternatives, regulations allow indemnity payments to be made to the owner by the state and federal governments. This paper analyzes the financial impact of each alternative on two dairy benchmark farms. One has 75 milk cows, the other 150. Monthly cash flow projections for two years were made using FINFLO. A base projection was compared to the above alternatives assuming constant herd size (except for the impact of TB) and constant price levels. The main goal was to illustrate how a farmer might analyze the alternatives if faced with TB infected animals. The 75 cow farm started with $ 8, 309 of cash on January 1, 2000. The base projections resulted in cash of $ 34, 230 by December 31, 2001. Ending cash after two years <b>for</b> <b>depopulation</b> or test and remove were $ 16, 095 and $ 15, 801, respectively. The 75 cow farm started with a net worth of $ 624, 940 on January 1, 2000. The base projection increased net worth by $ 66, 542 over the two years. <b>For</b> <b>depopulation</b> or test and remove, the change in net worth by the end of 2001 was $- 15, 345 and $ 48, 256, respectively. The 150 cow farm started with $ 30, 659 of cash on January 1, 2000. The base projections resulted in cash of $ 40, 437 by December 31, 2001. Ending cash after two years <b>for</b> <b>depopulation</b> or test and remove were $ 2, 972 and $ 13, 290, respectively. The 150 cow farm started with a net worth of $ 1, 122, 940 on January 1, 2000.

No environmental studies of source hatcheries were completed. This case-control study {{was performed by}} comparing culture-confirmed Salmonella Infantis in Michigan residents, identified between May and July 1999, with two age- and neighbourhood-matched controls. Eighty environmental and bird tissue samples were collected from an implicated hatchery; all salmonella isolates underwent pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis. The study included 19 case-patients sharing the same PFGE subtype and 37 matched controls.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Diagnostic Medicine and PathobiologyMichael W. SandersonThe last {{outbreak}} for Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) in the United States (U. S.) was in 1929. Since {{that time}} the U. S. has not had any exposure to the disease or vaccination, creating a very susceptible livestock population. The central U. S. has a large susceptible livestock population including cattle, swine, sheep, and goats. The impact of FMD in the U. S. would be devastating. Simulation modeling is the only avenue available to study the potential impacts of an introduction in the U. S. 	 Simulation models are dependent on accurate estimates of the frequency and distance distribution of contacts between livestock operations to provide valid model results for planning and decision making including {{the relative importance of}} different control strategies. Due to limited data on livestock movement rates and distance distribution for contacts a survey was conducted of livestock producers in Colorado and Kansas. These data fill a need for region specific contact rates to provide parameters for modeling a foreign animal disease. FMD outbreaks often require quarantine, depopulation and disposal of whole herds in order to prevent the continued spread of the disease. Experts were included in a Delphi survey and round table discussion to critically evaluate the feasibility of depopulating a large feedlot. No clearly acceptable method of rapidly depopulating a large feedlot was identified. Participants agreed that regardless of the method used <b>for</b> <b>depopulation</b> of cattle in a large feedlot, {{it would be very difficult}} to complete the task quickly, humanely, and be able to dispose of the carcasses in a timely fashion. Simulation models were developed to assess the impact of livestock herd types and vaccination on FMD outbreaks in the central U. S. using the North American Animal Disease Spread Model (NAADSM), a spatially explicit, stochastic state-transition simulation model. Simulation scenarios with large vaccination zones had decreased outbreak length and number of herds destroyed. Vaccination did not provide additional benefit to control compared to depopulation alone when biosecurity and movement controls were high, however the ability to achieve high levels of biosecurity and movement control may be limited by labor and animal welfare concerns...|$|E
40|$|Investigations {{were carried}} out aimed at {{identifying}} potential sources of transmission of Campylobacter jejuni to broiler chickens, determining whether boots can mechanically transmit C. jejuni to susceptible chickens, determining the transmission rate of C. jejuni in broiler chickens, and assessing the effect of washing slaughterhouse fomites with chlorinated water {{on the level of}} C. jejuni contamination during the day. Bacteriological culture of samples taken in the premises of a broiler slaughterhouse showed that after washing and just before departure <b>for</b> <b>depopulation</b> of broiler farms, 75 %, 58. 33 %, 47. 22 %, 50 %, 54. 29 %, 66. 67 %, 31. 25 %, and 0 % of pallets, crates, truck beds, truck wheels, drivers' boots, catchers' boots, forklift wheels, and tractor wheels respectively, were contaminated with C. jejuni. Therefore it was concluded that slaughterhouse personnel and fomites could potentially transmit C. jejuni during partial depopulation of broiler flocks. The level of C. jejuni in consecutive sample batches of fomites (n = 30) that were collected in six periods of one hour each day (hence six batches), between 0530 and 1230 hrs, over six days, was found to range from 44. 83 % in the lst batch and 66. 67 % in the 5 th batch, indicating that washing fomites with pressurized chlorinated water makes no statistically significant difference (p> 0. 05) in the contamination level. The fomites sampled were pallets, crates, truck bed, truck wheels, and drivers' boots. Susceptible broiler chickens became colonized with C. jejuni after exposure to boots that had been worn in a pen with infected chickens demonstrating that boots can mechanically cause horizontal transmission of the bacterium. A transmission study conducted by introducing a bird infected with C. jejuni to 99 susceptible chickens demonstrated a rapid spread of the infection to all the birds within 48 hours and a transmission rate best represented by a simple epidemic curve. A transmission parameter beta (β), with a value of 2. 1 x 10 - 3 ± 0. 013 x 10 - 3 (mean ± standard error), was calculated by fitting the data into a simple deterministic epidemic model. The transmission rate in a population of 100 birds, predicted by this model, was very similar to that obtained in the experiment. Therefore, it was concluded that the transmission rate of C. jejuni in broilers resembles a simple epidemic...|$|E
40|$|The rapid {{development}} of tourism in the Adriatic region of Yugoslavia brings about, inter alia, considerable sociodemographic changes and causes {{before all the}} transfer of population from agricultural to other activities. Taking into account the economical possibilities brought about by tourism, as "well as plans {{for the development of}} shipbuilding, aluminium and other industries, the author of this article undertook an analysis of influences of such changes on agricultural production and social structure of population. At the beginning the Adriatic region was defined. It is a karst region situated between the coast line and Dinar’s mountain system. There is not much arrable land in it and the climate is rather dry. The relief and the climate of the Region caused a peculiar spatial arrangements of the population and its settlements. From old times the existence of people in this region has been depending on sea and transport between the coast and the inland. Nevertheless up to our century the population depended mostly on work in agriculture, especially on growing grape, olive, vegetable, tobacco and breeding sheep, goats and cattle. Nowdays too, peasants grow cereals quite often, but vields per hectare are very low. The annual deficit of wheat amounts up to 180, 000 tons. The author suggests to exclude cereals from agriculture in this region. Social agricultural enterprises in 1963. owned 23, 700 hectares of land or 5, 3 % of the total hectrage of arrable land in this region. The rest of land is being cultivated by private landowners. Their landestates are very small, for instance even 46, 8 % private landestates in Dalmatia and Hrvatsko Primorje are under 2 hectares. Is should be add that every landestate is divided, on the average, on 12, 6 plats each covering about 881 m 2. In such conditions socialistic agricultural enterprises and cooperatives really can not find their account in buying off such small parcels of land scattered about the stony relief. But {{they will be able to}} gain qualitative land when drainage works of many karst fields get completed. The main author’s attention is directed to the analysis of agricultural population. He explicates the following data: in 1961. 544, 000 persons were engaded in agriculture while the whole population numbered 1. 558, 000. During the period 1953. — 1961. the number of active agricultural population decreased from 315, 000 to 257, 000. In the commune Rijeka there is even only 1, 4 % of agricultural population while at the same time in the hinterland this percentage rise up to 70. On the Adriatic islands there is about 55 % of agricultural population on the average. As a matter of fact 33, 4 % of the total population in Adriatic region earns their living in agriculture, 24 % only in agriculture and 42, 6 % only in nonagricultural activities. Today 26, 9 % of labour power in agriculture is employed in industry, tourism and other nonfarm activities. In other words nonagriculturists (industrial and other workers, clarks and tradesmen) run 1 / 4 of the total number of privately owned landestates. Traditionally the Adriatic region was known as an emigratory region. At the beginning of this century quite a lot of people emigrated to both American continents and to many European countries too. Today these three migratory directions are significant: from the Adriatic region to the inland of Yugoslavia, from villages to towns within the Region itself and to foreign countries. From 1953. till 1961. population of Adriatic towns increased for 21, 4 % while population of Adriatic villages in the same period recorded the population growth of only 0, 6 %. As a matter of fact 104, 000 persons had left 3, 668 villages or 10 % of the present number of population in all Adriatic villages. Every day about 70, 000 persons travel to work from villages to towns and industrial centers. About 50 % of present rural inhabitants are not engaged in agriculture any more. Particularly interesting are the demographic processes on Adriatic islands. They had in 1961. only 8, 8 % more population then in 1857. Today on the largest Adriatic island Krk there is 24 % persons in the age over 60. As the main reason <b>for</b> <b>depopulation</b> tendencies on Adriatic islands, the author pointed out the agrarian crises which has started in 1910. At the end the author proposes some measures for the betterment and improvement of the situation on Adriatic islands...|$|E
40|$|Aims: To {{determine}} whether an association exists between partial depopulation of a flock and increased Campylobacter colonization in that flock. Methods and Results: Data from 1737 flocks of two Dutch integrators were used. Flocks that experienced partial depopulation {{were defined as}} 'exposed' and those that did not as 'nonexposed'. Multivariable modelling was accomplished with, in addition to 'exposure', the independent variables 'age of broilers at slaughter' and 'season' to adjust for possible confounding. The response variable was 'Campylobacter colonization'. The odds ratio (OR) <b>for</b> partial <b>depopulation</b> <b>for</b> integrator A was 0 · 8 [95 % CI (0 · 4, 1 · 8) ]; for integrator B the OR = 0 · 8 [95 % CI (0 · 5, 1 · 3) ].

Archaeological evidence shows the continuation of traditional Dacian burial practices; ceramic manufacturing continued throughout the Roman period, in both the province as well as the periphery where Roman control was non-existent. Differing interpretations can be made from the final scene on Trajan's Column, which either depicts a Dacian emigration, accelerating the depopulation of Dacia, or Dacians going back to their settlements after yielding to Roman authority.|$|R
40|$|Narrow {{conducting}} channels {{have been}} fabricated {{in the two}} dimensional electron gas in a GaAs-AlGaAs heterostructure, using a recently developed shallow mesa etch technique. Four terminal high field magnetoresistance measurements at temperatures down to 2 K have been performed on samples with etched width between 8 µm and 0. 5 µm. The Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations are studied, and clear evidence is presented <b>for</b> magnetic <b>depopulation</b> of 1 -dimensional subbands. The data for the 0. 5 µm wide channel are in satisfactory agreement with a simple analysis based on a parabolic confinement potential. Large sidewall depletion effects are found, in agreement with our recent analysis of the weak field negative magnetoresistance. We also observe irregular structure in the magnetoresistance. The dependence of the effects on {{the orientation of the}} magnetic field shows that the magnetoresistance arises from the orbital motion of the 2 -dimensional electrons. The magnitude and typical field scales of the aperiodic structure are in agreement with predictions based on the theory of universal conductance fluctuations. ...|$|R
