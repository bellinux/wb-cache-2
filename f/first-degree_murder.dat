5|$|On March 3, 2009, the Superior Court of the District of Columbia {{issued an}} arrest warrant for Guandique. He was {{returned}} to {{the custody of the}} District of Columbia Department of Corrections on April 20 via the Federal Transfer Center in Oklahoma City. Two days later, Guandique was charged in D.C. with Levy's murder.

Guandique pleaded not guilty at his arraignment, where a trial date was initially set for January 27, 2010. His lawyers argued that Guandique's federal prison cell was outside the jurisdiction of a court-ordered search. After errors in processing contaminated some of the gathered evidence with DNA from employees of the prosecution, the start date of the trial at the H. Carl Moultrie Courthouse was moved to October 4, 2010.|$|E

5|$|Upon her {{arrest on}} November 22, 1995, Green {{was charged with}} two counts of <b>first-degree</b> <b>murder,</b> two counts of {{attempted}} <b>first-degree</b> <b>murder,</b> and one count of aggravated arson. She was held on $3,000,000 bail—the highest ever required {{at that point in}} time by Johnson County, Kansas—and maintained her innocence throughout pre-trial motions and a show cause hearing. However, when the defense's own investigators verified the strength of forensic evidence against Green, she agreed to an Alford plea to all charges. On May 30, 1996, she was sentenced to two concurrent forty-year prison sentences. Green has petitioned for a new trial twice since her conviction. Her first request, which she eventually withdrew, was based on a claim of having been rendered incompetent for plea bargaining by the psychiatric medications she was taking at the time of her hearings; her second, which was denied by a judge, claimed that the evidence used to convict her of arson had been rendered obsolete by scientific advances.|$|E
5|$|Despite her confession, Wise {{pleaded not}} guilty to the charge of murdering Lily Gienke in front of a grand jury on March 23, 1925.

Fans and historians disapproved of the decision to destroy the gun, saying the event was historical and the gun should have been in a museum.|$|E
5|$|Minnesota's {{court system}} has three levels. Most cases {{start in the}} {{district}} courts, which are courts of general jurisdiction. There are 279 district court judgeships in ten judicial districts. Appeals from the trial courts and challenges to certain governmental decisions are heard by the Minnesota Court of Appeals, consisting of nineteen judges who typically sit in three-judge panels. The seven-justice Minnesota Supreme Court hears all appeals from the tax court, the workers' compensation court of appeals, <b>first-degree</b> <b>murder</b> convictions, and discretionary appeals from the court of appeals; it also has original jurisdiction over election disputes.|$|E

This clears the way for the more serious state charges.|$|R
50|$|Brothers, who had {{months earlier}} married {{his wife for}} the second time, was convicted of killing her, their new baby, two {{toddlers}} and his mother-in-law on July 6, 2003.

5|$|Breckinridge {{pressed to}} reform the state's {{criminal}} code, {{which was based on}} the English system and imposed the death penalty for over 200 different crimes. Inspired by Thomas Jefferson's failed attempt to reform Virginia's code, he first asked the Lexington Democratic Society to study ways to make punishments more proportional to crimes in November 1793. By 1796, he was drafting a new code based on the principles that criminals should be rehabilitated, victims should be compensated for their injury, the public should be reimbursed for the cost of prosecuting the criminal, and the punishment's severity should serve as a deterrent for would-be offenders. In January 1798, he introduced his proposed code in the General Assembly. A month later, the Assembly reformed the code, abolishing the death penalty for every crime except <b>first-degree</b> <b>murder.</b>|$|E
5|$|On April 13, {{the defense}} team {{notified}} Paul Morrison that Green wished to plea bargain.

Green denied being under the influence of any drug which would affect her judgment in making her plea or her ability to understand the proceedings in which she was participating.|$|E

50|$|Bernardo {{was tried}} {{for the murders}} of French and Mahaffy in 1995, and his trial {{included}} detailed testimony from Homolka and videotapes of the rapes. The trial, subject to a publication ban in Canadian newspapers and media, was moved to Toronto from St. Catharines (where the murders occurred). The ban did not affect American newspapers and television stations in nearby Buffalo, New York, which were easily available in southern Ontario. Bernardo testified that the deaths were accidental, later claiming {{that his wife was}} the actual killer. On September 1, 1995, Bernardo was convicted of a number of offences, including the two <b>first-degree</b> <b>murders</b> and two aggravated sexual assaults, and {{sentenced to life in prison}} without parole for at least 25 years.

During the penalty phase of Taylor's trial, his {{half-sister}} Leslie Beale traveled from Florida to testify about his harsh treatment under his stepfather and the three years that Taylor spent in a sex offender program at a Florida mental institution. On December 19, Taylor became the first convict in 40 years {{to be sent to}} death row by a Weber County court. Roth said that {{the facts of the case}} outweighed any mitigating circumstances. Taylor's father Albert attended most of his son's court proceedings until he died of heart failure on October 8, 1990. Taylor said he was not permitted to attend his father's funeral.|$|E
5|$|On June 25, a tipster, who {{was later}} {{revealed}} to be Taylor's sister Laurie Galli, contacted Washington Terrace Police officer Marcia Gathercole with information connected to the murder.
