5|$|In July 2008, {{the then}} Governor-General of Jamaica Sir Kenneth O. Hall, {{indicated}} that he wished to step down due to declining health. He was persuaded {{to remain in the}} post for an additional half-year. On 13 January 2009, the Prime Minister of Jamaica, Bruce Golding (of the <b>Jamaica</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party),</b> announced that Allen would succeed Kenneth Hall as governor-general. The announcement generated controversy, both because Allen had strong ties to the Seventh Day Adventist Church, and because as an Adventist, Allen might be unable to attend events due to his strict observation of the sabbath. On 28 January 2009, Allen resigned from his presidency of the West Indies Union. He also resigned as {{chairman of the board of}} Northern Caribbean University, and other religious organisations in 2009.|$|E
5|$|WINDALCO {{reported}} {{a loss of}} 10,000tons of aluminum due to flooding. Manufacturing companies reported J$18.3million (US$296,000) in losses, primarily from suspended operations. In November, the <b>Jamaica</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> sought J$3.2billion (US$51.8million) in additional funding to repair roads damaged by Hurricanes Ivan, Dennis, Emily, and Wilma. The following month, the Jamaica Agricultural Society received J$5.5million (US$88,266) from the Japanese embassy to assist 500farmers in Portland Parish. The long-term effects of Dennis were limited, with nearly every economic sector returning to normal within a few months. The only exceptions were exports of banana and coffee crops, {{both of which were}} still recovering from Hurricane Ivan in 2004. Overall implications to the nation's gross domestic product were negligible, merely flat-lining growth rather than causing decline. However, in combination with the effects of a drought early in 2005, inflation values required adjustment upwards from 9% to 14.3%.|$|E
50|$|On 3 September 2007, Spencer won the St Elizabeth North East seat by {{defeating}} the <b>Jamaica</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party's</b> Corris Samuels. The final count was 9,047 votes to 6,909.|$|R

50|$|Fayval Shirley Williams (born 28 May 1958) is a Jamaican {{politician}} {{who is the}} Member of Parliament for the St Andrew Eastern constituency. She is also State Minister in the Ministry of Finance and Planning with responsibility for fiscal policy having served as deputy spokesperson on Finance since April 2014. In June 2014, Fayval Williams was named {{as a member of}} the <b>Jamaica</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party's</b> Economic Advisory Council.|$|R
5|$|The {{community}} of Big Woods was significantly affected by flooding, with 30 families being {{isolated in the}} area. The only fatality from the storm also occurred in this community after a man was washed away while trying to rescue a family. The severity of damage in Big Woods prompted <b>Jamaica</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> Area Council Four chairman to state {{that it should be}} declared a disaster area. Torrential rains during a two-hour span overnight triggered most of the flooding in the area, isolating many homes and inundating several. In Westmoreland Parish, severe flooding inundated several homes and damaged roadways. One home sustained significant damage after a large tree fell on it. In Kingston, high winds damaged power lines and some homes. Water supply to most regions was cut due to damage to pipelines and high water turbidity. Widespread power outages occurred due to numerous downed trees and power lines.|$|E
5|$|The crisis deepened on 10 October 1970, when Guyanese Prime Minister Forbes Burnham {{announced}} that Sobers {{would not be}} allowed to enter Guyana until he apologised. This was a major issue for the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) as the team played at least one Test match a year in Georgetown, the Guyanese capital. The <b>Jamaica</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> called for Sobers to resign as captain four days later; Indira Gandhi, the Indian Prime Minister, then {{announced that}} if Sobers were not removed from the West Indies team, India would cancel its upcoming tour of the West Indies, scheduled for early 1971. The WICB considered its options. Cancelling matches in Guyana might prompt Burnham to instruct Guyanese members of the West Indian team to boycott, and sacking Sobers might cause Barbados to withdraw in protest; either way, the unity of the West Indies team was threatened. Meanwhile, no sign of an apology emanated from Sobers.|$|E

50|$|The People's National Party {{secured a}} {{landslide}} victory by winning 151 divisions to the <b>Jamaica</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party's</b> 75, {{in addition to}} the mayorship of Portmore. The results saw the PNP holding majorities in 12 of the 13 parish councils, with the 13th council, Trelawny, being tied by the two major political parties with one elected independent candidate. It was decided by the independent candidate that the mayorship of Falmouth, the capital of Trelawny, would be awarded to the PNP with the JLP receiving the deputy mayor position.|$|R
50|$|Strong {{trade unions}} {{continued}} to develop {{all around the}} Caribbean. These collected data on working conditions and wage levels, and became mass movements associated with political parties. Besides the BITU, the National Workers Union arose in <b>Jamaica,</b> the <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> of St. Kitts and the St. Kitts-Nevis Trades and Labour Union, and unions and parties in Antigua. All were of the same general view regarding wages and salaries for workers.|$|R

The <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> has formed a new centre-left city government including the <b>Labour</b> <b>Party,</b> the Liberal Party and the Christian Democrats.|$|R
50|$|The {{party had}} links with <b>labour</b> <b>parties</b> in Penang, Malacca, Perak and Singapore. On 26 June 1952, these parties formed the Pan-Malayan <b>Labour</b> <b>Party,</b> as {{a union of}} statewise <b>labour</b> <b>parties.</b> The Selangor <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> became an {{affiliate}} of PMLP. Mohamed Soppi had been {{the secretary of the}} Selangor <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> {{at the time of its}} foundation, but left this position to assume chairmanship of the Pan-Malayan <b>Labour</b> <b>Party.</b> Lee Moke Sang became General Secretary of PMLP. The PMLP would later become the <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> of Malaya.|$|R
50|$|Haugesunds Social-Demokrat {{was started}} in 1921, the same year the Social Democratic <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> {{broke away from the}} Norwegian <b>Labour</b> <b>Party.</b> In 1926, Haugesunds Social-Demokrat was {{incorporated}} into the <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> newspaper Haugesunds Arbeiderblad. In 1927, the Social Democratic <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> reconciled with the <b>Labour</b> <b>Party,</b> and the two parties again became one.|$|R
25|$|Strong {{economic}} growth, averaging approximately 6% per annum, {{marked the}} first ten years of independence under conservative <b>Jamaica</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> governments; they were led successively by Prime Ministers Alexander Bustamante, Donald Sangster and Hugh Shearer. The growth was fueled by strong private investments in bauxite/alumina, tourism, the manufacturing industry and, to a lesser extent, the agricultural sector.|$|E
25|$|As a result, the Bustamante-led <b>Jamaica</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> (the local {{component}} of the West Indian DLP) successfully forced Manley to hold a referendum in September 1961 on political secession from the Federation. It passed, with 54% of the vote, despite the opposition of Manley, the province's Chief Minister at the time. Manley himself lost the subsequent island elections in April 1962, and Bustamante became the first Prime Minister of an independent Jamaica on 6 August 1962.|$|E
25|$|The 2007 general {{election}} saw the <b>Jamaica</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> return to {{power for the}} first time since the election of 1989. Harding returned to the senate, and to the position of President of the Senate, becoming the first person to serve in that role over two non-contiguous periods. Immediately prior to the 2011 {{general election}} being called, Harding announced that he would be retiring from politics. At the time of his retirement, he was the longest-serving senator in Jamaican history.|$|E
50|$|The elected councillors for Wavertree are Helen Casstles (<b>Labour</b> <b>Party),</b> Rosie Jolly (<b>Labour</b> <b>Party)</b> and Dave Cummings (<b>Labour</b> <b>Party).</b>|$|R

25|$|In the 1976 general election, Harding ran as the <b>Jamaica</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> (JLP) {{candidate}} for the Saint Andrew East Rural seat in the Jamaican House of Representatives. The seat {{was held in the}} previous term by Eric Bell of the People's National Party (PNP), but Bell was not a candidate in 1976. Harding's opponent in the election was Roy McGann of the PNP. Harding lost the election, 8,710 to 5,929, a difference of 2,781 votes, and the People's National Party won the election overall.|$|E
25|$|As Leader of the Opposition Manley {{became an}} outspoken critic of the new {{conservative}} administration. He strongly opposed intervention in Grenada after Prime Minister Maurice Bishop was overthrown and executed. Immediately after committing Jamaican troops to Grenada in 1983, Seaga called a snap election – two years early – on the pretext that Dr Paul Robertson, General Secretary of the PNP, had called for his resignation. Manley, who may have been taken by surprise by the maneuver, led his party in a boycott of the elections, and so the <b>Jamaica</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> won all seats in parliament against only marginal opposition in six of the sixty electoral constituencies.|$|E
25|$|Oswald Gaskell Harding CD, QC, OJ (born 3 November 1935) is {{a former}} Jamaican {{politician}} from the <b>Jamaica</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party,</b> and the longest-serving senator in the nation's history. He was born in Kingston. Harding {{was the first person}} to serve as President of the Senate of Jamaica for two non-consecutive tenures, serving from 1980 to 1984 and from 2007 to 2011. First appointed to the Senate in 1977, he served in the body continuously until 2002, and rejoined the Senate from 2007 until his retirement from politics in 2011. His first period as a senator was the longest continuous tenure in the body's history.|$|E
50|$|He {{was deeply}} {{involved}} with the early development of the <b>Labour</b> <b>Party,</b> from establishing the Independent Political Labour League via the original New Zealand <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> and the United <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> to the current <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> formed in 1916. He was New Zealand <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> president 1918 to 1920, and stood as <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> candidate for Dunedin South in 1919; losing by only 84 votes against Thomas Sidey of the Liberal Party; he did not stand for parliament again.|$|R
5000|$|The 1992 <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> Deputy Leadership {{election}} {{followed the}} <b>Labour</b> <b>Party's</b> failure {{to win the}} 1992 general election and the subsequent resignation of deputy party leader Roy Hattersley. The ballot took place on 18 July 1992 at <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> Conference. Affiliated organisations had 40% of the vote, while Constituency <b>Labour</b> <b>Parties</b> and the Parliamentary <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> had 30% each in the electoral college.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} local <b>Labour</b> <b>parties</b> and clubs participated in the {{formation}} of the Communist Party of Canada in 1921.

25|$|Believing that Jamaica's {{strength}} lay in its agriculture, Christopher Hills co-founded the Jamaica Agriculture & Industrial Party (AIP) as {{an alternative}} to the two major political parties: <b>Jamaica</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> (JLP) and People's National Party (PNP), both of which he felt were too busy warring with each other to look out for the middle class and the country people who were the backbone of Jamaica's rural economy. Despite competing vigorously in the polls, the Hills couple were nevertheless close friends with JLP leader Sir Alexander Bustamante and Norman Manley, head of the PNP, who both served as Jamaican Prime Ministers. Norman Manley in fact had been best man at the Hills' wedding.|$|E
25|$|Manley was Prime Minister when Jamaica {{experienced}} a significant escalation {{of its political}} culture of violence. Supporters of his opponent Edward Seaga and the <b>Jamaica</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> (JLP) and Manley's People's National Party (PNP) engaged in a bloody struggle which began before the 1976 election and ended when Seaga was installed as Prime Minister in 1980. While the violent political culture was not invented by Seaga or Manley, and had its roots in conflicts between the parties from {{as early as the}} beginning of the two-party system in the 1940s, political violence reached unprecedented levels in the 1970s. Indeed, the two elections accompanied by the greatest violence were those (1976 and 1980) in which Seaga was trying to unseat Manley.|$|E
500|$|Whilst in England, he {{recorded}} the albums Exodus and Kaya. Exodus {{stayed on the}} British album charts for 56 consecutive weeks. It included four UK hit singles: [...] "Exodus", [...] "Waiting in Vain", [...] "Jamming", and [...] "One Love" [...] (a rendition of Curtis Mayfield's hit, [...] "People Get Ready"). During his time in London, {{he was arrested and}} received a conviction for possession of a small quantity of cannabis. In 1978, Marley returned to Jamaica and performed at another political concert, the One Love Peace Concert, again in an effort to calm warring parties. Near the end of the performance, by Marley's request, Michael Manley (leader of then-ruling People's National Party) and his political rival Edward Seaga (leader of the opposing <b>Jamaica</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party),</b> joined each other on stage and shook hands.|$|E
