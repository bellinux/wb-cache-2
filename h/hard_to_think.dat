Many consider this to have been a [...] "definitive role" [...] for Whitaker. In a manner similar to his preparation for Bird, he again immersed himself in his character's world—he studied Eastern philosophy and meditated for long hours [...] "to hone his inner spiritual hitman." [...] Jarmusch has told interviewers that he developed the title character with Whitaker in mind; The New York Times review of the film observed that [...] "t's <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of another actor who could play a cold-blooded killer with such warmth and humanity." ...|$|E

The critic Michael Oliver wrote, [...] "Fauré's Préludes are among the subtlest and most elusive piano pieces in existence; they express deep but mingled emotions, sometimes with intense directness... more often with the utmost economy and restraint and with mysteriously complex simplicity." [...] Jessica Duchen calls them [...] "unusual slivers of magical inventiveness." [...] The complete set takes between 20 and 25 minutes to play. The shortest of the set, No 8, lasts barely more than a minute; the longest, No 3, takes between four and five minutes.|$|E

Masterpiece is an overused word, but it's <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of another so powerful. Let Me In {{is the new}} standard for vampire movies." [...] Acclaimed horror author Stephen King wrote [...] "Let Me In is a genre-busting triumph. Not just a horror film, but the best American horror film in the last 20 years." [...] Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal wrote that the film [...] "is more than a respectful remake; 'Let Me In' is quietly stylish and thoroughly chilling in its own right." ...|$|E

[...] "We found it <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> football around the palm trees", he said. [...] "A preseason camp has to be hard, {{and you have to}} work hard. You can't do it in a place like Hawaii." [...] The team got off to a 1–3–1 start in 1961, and Adams fired him on October 14. Adams said the decision was [...] "based on the conclusion the material on hand has not been used to its fullest potential". Wally Lemm was given the head coaching job, but the shake-up prompted Speedie to resign. Under Lemm, the Oilers regrouped to win their second consecutive title.|$|E

500|$|Gilligan also {{extensively}} coached and lectured {{around the}} county, {{spending time in}} the English winters raising the team's profile. He encouraged the search for promising young cricketers, {{and most of the}} club's professional cricketers during its successful years in the 1930s were discovered during Gilligan's drive for new talent. Percy Fender believed that Gilligan allowed the team's professionals a greater say in Sussex's affairs than previously permitted. Fender wrote that Gilligan's teams enjoyed playing under him and that Gilligan {{was one of the most}} popular captains in county cricket. Cricket writer R. C. Robertson-Glasgow said: [...] "With him there was no sharpnesses, no petty restraints, no mathematical cricket. He won or lost plumb straight". Swanton wrote that [...] "Gilligan was essentially a friendly man, hail-fellow-well-met, and it is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that in the world of sport he ever made an enemy." ...|$|E
500|$|Jobs {{named his}} new company Next, Inc. A number of former Apple {{employees}} {{followed him to}} Next, including [...] Joanna Hoffman, Bud Tribble, George Crow, Rich Page, Susan Barnes, Susan Kare, and Dan'l Lewin. After consulting with major educational buyers from around the country, including a follow-up meeting with Paul Berg, a tentative specification for the workstation was drawn up. It {{was designed to be}} powerful enough to run wet lab simulations and cheap enough for college students to use in their dormitory rooms. Before the specifications were finished, however, Apple sued Next for [...] "nefarious schemes" [...] {{to take advantage of the}} cofounders' insider information. Jobs remarked, [...] "It is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that a $2billion company with 4,300-plus people couldn't compete with six people in blue jeans." [...] The suit was eventually dismissed before trial.|$|E
500|$|Swanton {{believed}} that Constantine {{was the first}} West Indian cricketer to make an impression on the British public: [...] "he... personified West Indian cricket from the first faltering entry in the Test arena in 1928 until the post-war emergence of the trinity of Worrell, Weekes and Walcott." [...] Swanton continued: [...] "There have been many all-rounders with better records... but it is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of one who made a more sensational impact [...] impossible to imagine his superior as a fielder anywhere." [...] In 1934 Neville Cardus described Constantine as a [...] "genius" [...] and the [...] "most original cricketer of recent years". R. C. Robertson-Glasgow called Constantine the most exciting cricketer to watch of all his contemporaries. This was partly because his style of cricket meant that he could alter {{the course of a}} match in a short space of time, although he developed his technique to minimise risk.|$|E

When we have asked people this question, they often say that they look away because looking at the other person is distracting and makes it <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>think.</b> Empirical support for this view has come from studies of gaze aversion, which have demon-strated that shifts of gaze may occur to free up cognitive resources, especially when people need <b>to</b> <b>think</b> more deeply about what they are saying (i. e., are experiencing high cogni-tive load, Beattie, 1981; Doherty-Sneddon & Phelps, 2005; Glenberg, Schroeder, & Robertson, 1998).

500|$|Deryck Cooke {{argues that}} Mahler's {{popularity}} escalated when a new, postwar generation of music-lovers arose, untainted by [...] "the dated polemics of anti-romanticism" [...] which had affected Mahler's {{reputation in the}} inter-war years. In this more liberated age, enthusiasm for Mahler expanded even into places—Spain, France, Italy—which had long been resistant to him. Robert Carr's simpler explanation for the 1950s Mahler revival is that [...] "it was the long-playing record [...] rather than the Zeitgeist which made a comprehensive breakthrough possible. Mahler's work became accessible and repeatable in the home." [...] In the years following his centenary in 1960, Mahler rapidly {{became one of the}} most performed and most recorded of all composers, and has largely remained thus. In Britain and elsewhere, Carr notes, the extent of Mahler performances and recordings has replaced a relative famine with a glut, bringing problems of over-familiarity. Harold Schonberg comments that [...] "it is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of a composer who arouses equal loyalty," [...] adding that [...] "a response of anything short of rapture to the Mahler symphonies will bring [...] long letters of furious denunciation." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his book}} Phil Spector: Out of His Head, Richard Williams writes that, unlike Lennon and McCartney on their 1970 solo albums, [...] "Harrison {{concentrated}} on pure joyous melodies – {{the kind of}} songs that had made the group so loved", and he says of [...] "Awaiting on You All": [...] "Spector repaid Harrison for his benediction on the Ike and Tina Turner album cover by {{turning it into a}} virtual remake of 'River Deep – Mountain High'." [...] Mark Ribowsky, another Spector biographer, writes of the producer's contribution to this and other songs on All Things Must Pass: [...] "Phil's rhythmically pounding basses and drum feels sutured George's sentimentality with cheerful energy and made Indian asceticism into dance music." [...] Simon Leng describes [...] "Awaiting on You All" [...] as a [...] "hot gospel stomper" [...] and [...] "the most successful example of Spector's work on the album". Writing for NME Originals in 2005, Adrian Thrills named [...] "Awaiting on You All" [...] and [...] "Wah-Wah" [...] as examples of [...] "a tendency to over-egg the mix" [...] on the otherwise [...] "magnificent" [...] All Things Must Pass, adding: [...] "it is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of another big rock album on which the tambourine is shaken quite so relentlessly." ...|$|E

40|$|Book synopsis: Over {{the past}} twenty years debates about {{pornography}} have raged within feminism and beyond. Throughout the 1970 s feminists increasingly addressed the problem of men's sexual violence against women, and many women reduced the politics of men's power to questions about sexuality. By the 1980 s these questions had become more and more focused on the issue of pornography [...] now a metaphor for the menace of male power. Collapsing feminist politics into sexuality and sexuality into pornography has not only caused some of the deepest splits between feminists, but made it <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> clearly about either sexuality or pornography [...] indeed, about feminist politics more generally. This provocative collection, by well-known feminists, surveys these arguments, and in particular asks why recent feminist debates about sexuality keep reducing to questions of pornography...|$|R

A considerable amount of the effect could be accounted for by an unweighted sum of the membership ratings for the 2 constituents. The part of the dominance effect that could not be explained by an unweighted sum was best predicted by exemplar-based pairwise differentiation between the 2 constituents, meaning that dominance partly depends on an interactional process.
