2500|$|In 1855, Friedrich Gaedcke (18281890) {{became the}} first to {{chemically}} isolate cocaine, the most potent alkaloid of the coca plant. Gaedcke named the compound [...] "erythroxyline". In 1884, Austrian ophthalmologist Karl Koller (18571944) instilled a 2% solution of cocaine into his own eye and tested its effectiveness as a local anesthetic by pricking the eye with needles. His findings were presented {{a few weeks later}} at annual conference of the Heidelberg Ophthalmological Society. The following year, William Halsted (18521922) performed the first brachial plexus block. Using a surgical approach in the neck, Halsted applied cocaine to the brachial plexus. In January 1900, Harvey Cushing (18691939) — who was at that time one of Halsted's surgical residents — applied cocaine to the brachial plexus prior to dividing it, during a <b>forequarter</b> amputation for sarcoma.|$|E

6000|$|... "There! There! Look yonder!" [...] The last cry {{came from}} Luke, {{and at his}} words all turned quickly, to see the wildcat crouch between two trees growing close to the rocks.

60|$|It was a risky shot to take, {{for youth}} and beast floundered around furiously. But {{something}} had to be done, and in a second one gun-shot rang out, followed quickly by another. The aims of both rangers had been true, and the wildcat was struck in the <b>forequarter</b> and in the head. With a snarl and a sputter it let go its hold of Henry and splashed madly around in the water.|$|E
60|$|The elk {{was hung}} {{up out of}} the reach of any wild beasts that might be prowling around, and the next day Henry and Sam Barringford skinned the animal and cut up the meat as Mrs. Morris desired it. The tongue was smoked, a small part of the <b>forequarter</b> pickled, and the {{remainder}} kept fresh by being hung up where it was cold. That day they dined on elk steaks and all pronounced the fresh meat very acceptable.|$|E

50|$|<b>Forequarter</b> {{amputation}} is amputation of the arm, scapula and clavicle. It {{is usually}} performed {{as a last}} resort to remove a cancer, but decreasingly so as limb-sparing operations improve.|$|E
50|$|A male courts {{a female}} by dancing side-to-side, <b>forequarters</b> held high, {{displaying}} his elongated antennae and vibrating his elongated forelegs. A receptive female responds by spreading her forelegs {{to contact the}} male's long forelegs. The male somersaults over her <b>forequarters</b> and flips over to land {{on her back and}} lock onto her genitals. After several minutes of copulation, the female ejects {{a large part of the}} semen and swallows it. Such behaviour seems to correlate with the success of fertile egg production. Given such elaborate behavioural and morphological adaptations, waltzing flies are of interest as a model system for studying of the evolution of sexual dimorphism.|$|R

5000|$|In October 1882 Berger amputated {{the whole}} upper limb {{of a patient}} with an enchondroma of the humerus, {{publishing}} a report the following year. In 1887 he published “L’Amputation du Membre Superieur dans la Contiguite du Tronc”, a detailed monograph on <b>forequarter</b> amputation. In the paper's historical review, Berger credited Ralph Cuming as the originator of the operation. Berger noted only two prior such operations for war injuries, by Cuming in 1808 and by Gaetani Bey in Cairo some thirty years later.|$|E
50|$|Coopworth sheep are a medium-sized, dual purpose, longwool breed, with {{an alert}} but quiet disposition. The long face is usually clean {{with a small}} topknot or bare head and a {{slightly}} Roman nose. They stand a bit taller than the NZ Romney and exhibit heavier muscling than the Border Leicester. The body is long with a good loin and hindquarter, light <b>forequarter</b> and a wide pelvis. The fleece, with pointed locks, has a well-defined crimp with bright luster and spinning count of 44-48 (35-39 micrometres) and a staple length of 6-8 inches. While only white Coopworths may be registered in New Zealand and Australia, both white and natural colored Coopworths are accepted for registration in the United States and Canada.|$|E
