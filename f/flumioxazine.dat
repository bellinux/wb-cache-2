40|$|Broad-leaved weeds {{constitute}} {{a serious problem}} {{in the production of}} winter legumes, but few selective herbicides controlling these weeds have been registered in Europe. Four field experiments were conducted in 2009 / 10 and repeated in 2010 / 11 in Greece to study the response of common vetch (Vicia sativa L.), lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.), chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) and red pea (Lathyrus cicera L.) to several rates of the herbicides pendimethalin, S-metolachlor, S-metolachlor plus terbuthylazine and flumioxazin applied pre-emergence, as well as imazamox applied post-emergence. Phytotoxicity, crop height, total weight and seed yield were evaluated during the experiments. The {{results of this study suggest}} that common vetch, lentil, chickpea and red pea differed in their responses to the herbicides tested. Pendimethalin at 1. 30 kg ha- 1, S-metolachlor at 0. 96 kg ha- 1 and <b>flumioxazine</b> at 0. 11 kg ha- 1 used as pre-emergence applied herbicides provided the least phytotoxicity to legumes. Pendimethalin at 1. 98 kg ha- 1 and both rates of S-metolachlor plus terbuthylazine provided the greatest common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.) control. Imazamox at 0. 03 to 0. 04 kg ha- 1 could also be used as early post-emergence applied herbicide in common vetch and red pea without any significant detrimental effect...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{study was}} carried out in the period 2010 – 2012 in a nursery field {{established}} on the territory of the Fruit-Growing Institute, Plovdiv. The effect of the combined soil-applied herbicide metolachlor + oxyfluorfen (Metofen) and the contact soil herbicide with foliar activity <b>flumioxazine</b> (Pledge 50 WP) on the vegetative habits of 'Nonpareil' almond cultivar grafted on almond seedling rootstock was evaluated. In the period 15 - 25 March, before beginning of vegetation, soil herbicides were applied in the row strip in the second-year nursery field. The following variants were included in the study: 1. Control (untreated, handweeded); 2. Metofen – 120 ml/da; 3. Metofen – 240 ml/da; 4. Pledge 50 WP – 8. 0 g/da; 5. Pledge 50 WP – 20. 0 g/da. The effect of the herbicides on weed infestation and on the vegetative habits of the cultivar/rootstock combination 'Nonpareil'/almond seedling rootstock was followed up. The results showed that the herbicides applied at the tested rates had a good control on weed infestation and the herbicide activity continued for 3. 5 - 4 months. That makes it possible to eliminate the competitive impact of weeds {{on the development of the}} grafted trees for 4 - 5 months after beginning of vegetation. Visual symptoms of phytotoxicity (chlorosis or necrosis in the leaves and shoots) or an obvious suppression of the development of the grafted trees in the treated variants were not established. A depressing effect on growth of the grafted trees was reported after treatment with Metofen. The contact herbicide with soil and foliar activity Pledge 50 WP – 8. 0 g/da can be applied for weed control in a second-year nursery field of almond trees grafted on bitter almond seedling rootstock. ...|$|E
