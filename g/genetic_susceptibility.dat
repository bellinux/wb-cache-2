5|$|Around {{one-third of}} people with {{psoriasis}} report {{a family history of}} the disease, and researchers have identified genetic loci associated with the condition. Identical twin studies suggest a 70% chance of a twin developing psoriasis if the other twin has the disorder. The risk is around 20% for nonidentical twins. These findings suggest both a <b>genetic</b> <b>susceptibility</b> and an environmental response in developing psoriasis.|$|E
5|$|Obesity is most {{commonly}} {{caused by a}} combination of excessive food intake, lack of physical activity, and <b>genetic</b> <b>susceptibility.</b> A few cases are caused primarily by genes, endocrine disorders, medications, or mental disorder. The view that obese people eat little yet gain weight due to a slow metabolism is not generally supported. On average, obese people have a greater energy expenditure than their normal counterparts due to the energy required to maintain an increased body mass.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Breast {{cancer is}} the most common {{malignancy}} in women. Radiotherapy is frequently used in patients with breast cancer, but some patients may be more susceptible to ionizing radiation, and increased exposure to radiation sources may be associated to radiation adverse events. This susceptibility may be related to deficiencies in DNA repair mechanisms that are activated after cell-radiation, which causes DNA damage, particularly DNA double strand breaks. Some of these <b>genetic</b> <b>susceptibilities</b> in DNA-repair mechanisms are implicated in the etiology of hereditary breast/ovarian cancer (pathologic mutations in the BRCA 1 and 2 genes), but other less penetrant variants in genes involved in sporadic breast cancer have been described. These same <b>genetic</b> <b>susceptibilities</b> may be involved in negative radiotherapeutic outcomes. For these reasons, it is necessary to implement methods for detecting patients who are susceptible to radiotherapy-related adverse events. This review discusses mechanisms of DNA damage and repair, genes related to these functions, and the diagnosis methods designed and under research for detection of breast cancer patients with increased radiosensitivity...|$|R

25|$|Cancer is the {{uncontrolled}} growth of cells coupled with malignant behaviour: invasion and metastasis (among other features). It {{is caused by}} the interaction between <b>genetic</b> <b>susceptibility</b> and environmental factors. These factors lead to accumulations of genetic mutations in oncogenes (genes that control the growth rate of cells) and tumor suppressor genes (genes that help to prevent cancer), which gives cancer cells their malignant characteristics, such as {{uncontrolled growth}}.|$|E
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of <b>genetic</b> variation in <b>susceptibility</b> to insecticides within a natural population of Drosophila melanogaster (Meigen) at Katsunuma (Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan) was examined. Two resistance factors for three organophosphate insecticides (OPs), a resistant-type acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and a cytochrome P 450 monooxygenase (cytochrome P 450), {{have already been}} suggested to be involved within the Katsunuma population. In this study, genetic variances were estimated for susceptibility to other classes of chemicals than OPs, permethrin (a pyrethroid) and dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT; an organo-chlorine), which existed simultaneously with <b>genetic</b> variances for <b>susceptibility</b> to OPs. Analyses of variance for susceptibility to permethrin and DDT showed highly significant variation among isofemale lines from the Katsunuma population, and the <b>genetic</b> variances for <b>susceptibility</b> to each insecticide fluctuated differently during this period. The impacts of fluctuations of <b>genetic</b> variation in <b>susceptibility</b> to one class of insecticides on <b>genetic</b> variation in <b>susceptibility</b> to other classes of insecticides existing simultaneously within the natural population were discussed...|$|R

25|$|It {{is poorly}} {{understood}} how ANCA are developed, although several hypotheses have been suggested. There {{is probably a}} genetic contribution, particularly in genes controlling the level of immune response â€“ although <b>genetic</b> <b>susceptibility</b> {{is likely to be}} linked to an environmental factor, some possible factors including vaccination or exposure to silicates. Two possible mechanisms of ANCA development are postulated, although neither of these theories answers the question of how the different ANCA specificities are developed, and there is much research still being undertaken on the development of ANCA.|$|E
25|$|MPyV is {{primarily}} spread among mice via the intranasal route and is shed in urine. <b>Genetic</b> <b>susceptibility</b> to MPyV infection among mice varies significantly, {{and not all}} MPyV strains are oncogenic. In general, only newborns and immunosuppressed mice (usually transgenic) develop tumors upon infection; although originally observed {{as a cause of}} parotid gland tumors, the virus may induce solid tumors {{in a wide variety of}} tissue types of both epithelial and mesenchymal origin. Although viruses in circulation among feral mice can be tumorigenic, under natural conditions the virus does not cause tumors; maternal antibodies have been shown to be critical in protecting neonates. It has been described as rare in modern laboratory mouse research colonies.|$|E

The etiology of PD is likely due, in part, to combinations of <b>genetic</b> <b>susceptibilities</b> and environmental factors. In rare familial cases, PD is due to genetic mutations. A number of new genetic and toxin models of PD and advances in older models are yielding important new information about the pathogenesis of PD. This has prompted us to critically review the current animal models for PD and discuss how these models may yield fresh insights into the pathogenesis of PD, {{as well as new}} therapeutic opportunities...|$|R
30|$|In addition, Morocco is {{a country}} of northwestern Africa {{composed}} predominantly of Berber and Arab ethnic groups.

We argue that it is through these biosensing networks that genetic and ovulation data become meaningful, and it is through this process that the biosensing body is acquired. We show how discussion and speculation, artefacts and body sensations, anticipations and corporeal imaginaries are part of what constitute and hold together the biosensing body...|$|R
25|$|Some <b>genetic</b> <b>susceptibility</b> {{may play}} a minor role in most cases. Overall, however, {{genetics}} {{is believed to be}} the primary cause of 5â€“10% of all cases. Women whose mother was diagnosed before 50 have an increased risk of 1.7 and those whose mother was diagnosed at age 50 or after has an increased risk of 1.4. In those with zero, one or two affected relatives, the risk of breast cancer before the age of 80 is 7.8%, 13.3%, and 21.1% with a subsequent mortality from the disease of 2.3%, 4.2%, and 7.6% respectively. In those with a first degree relative with the disease the risk of breast cancer between the age of 40 and 50 is double that of the general population.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause is}} {{typically}} unknown. It {{is believed to}} be due to <b>genetic</b> <b>susceptibility</b> that is triggered by an environmental factor such that an autoimmune disease occurs. This results in the destruction of skin pigment cells. Risk factors include a family history of the condition or other autoimmune diseases, such as hyperthyroidism, alopecia areata, and pernicious anemia. It is not contagious. Vitiligo is classified into two main types: segmental and non-segmental. Most cases are non-segmental, meaning they affect both sides; and in these cases, the affected area of the skin typically expands with time. About 10% of cases are segmental, meaning they mostly involve one side of the body; and in these cases, the affected area of the skin typically does not expand with time. Diagnosis can be confirmed by tissue biopsy.|$|E
25|$|In most of {{the current}} studies where {{positive}} correlations have been found between T. gondii antibody titers and certain behavioral traits or neurological disorders, T. gondii seropositivity tests are conducted after {{the onset of the}} examined disease or behavioral trait; that is, it is often unclear whether infection with the parasite increases the chances of having a certain trait or disorder, or if having a certain trait or disorder increases the chances of becoming infected with the parasite. Groups of individuals with certain behavioral traits or neurological disorders may share certain behavioral tendencies that increase the likelihood of exposure to and infection with T. gondii; as a result, it is difficult to confirm causal relationships between T. gondii infections and associated neurological disorders or behavioral traits. Provided there is in fact a causal link between T. gondii and schizophrenia, studies have yet to determine why some individuals with latent toxoplasmosis develop schizophrenia while others do not, however, some plausible explanations include differing <b>genetic</b> <b>susceptibility,</b> parasite strain differences, and differences in the route of the acquired T. gondii infection.|$|E

There are several studies showing pancreatic abnormalities in patients with Crohnâ€™s disease, a chronic inflammatory condition of the digestive tract. It has been suggested that pancreatitis could be an extrahepatic manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease, since its incidence in this disease is greater than that in the general population and in many cases no aetiological factor has been found [5].

500|$|Iron uptake is tightly {{regulated}} by the human body, which has no regulated physiological means of excreting iron. Only small amounts of iron are lost daily due to mucosal and skin epithelial cell sloughing, so control of iron levels is primarily accomplished by regulating uptake. Regulation of iron uptake is impaired in some people {{as a result of}} a genetic defect that maps to the HLA-H gene region on chromosome 6 and leads to abnormally low levels of hepcidin, a key regulator of the entry of iron into the circulatory system in mammals. In these people, excessive iron intake can result in iron overload disorders, known medically as hemochromatosis. Many people have an undiagnosed <b>genetic</b> <b>susceptibility</b> to iron overload, and are not aware of a family history of the problem. For this reason, people should not take iron supplements unless they suffer from iron deficiency and have consulted a doctor. Hemochromatosis is estimated to be the cause of 0.3 to 0.8% of all metabolic diseases of Caucasians.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The autistic {{spectrum}} disorders (ASD) form {{a set of}} multi-faceted disorders {{with significant}} genetic, epigenetic and environmental determinants. Oxidative and nitrosative stress (O&NS), immuno-inflammatory pathways, mitochondrial dysfunction and dysregulation of the tryptophan catabolite (TRYCATs) pathway play significant interactive roles in driving the early developmental etiology and course of ASD. O&NS interactions with immuno-inflammatory pathways mediate their effects centrally via the regulation of astrocyte and microglia responses, including regional variations in TRYCATs produced. Here we review {{the nature of these}} interactions and propose an early developmental model whereby different ASD <b>genetic</b> <b>susceptibilities</b> interact with environmental and epigenetic processes, resulting in glia biasing the patterning of central interarea interactions.
