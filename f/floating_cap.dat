2500|$|The grapes are harvested, either {{manually}} or by machine, {{when they}} are fully ripe. Sometimes grapes that have been harvested manually are sorted, either on the vines or at a sorting table on the wine-maker's premises, to ensure that rotten or insufficiently ripe grapes are removed. Grapes that have been harvested manually are usually crushed, then transferred to a tank. Pre-fermentation cold maceration is sometimes carried out. Alcoholic fermentation can then begin, normally after the addition of yeast. The next stage is the extraction of polyphenols (tannins and anthocyanins) and other chemical constituents of the grapes. In the past this {{was carried out by}} a process called pigeage, which involved repeatedly pushing the <b>floating</b> <b>cap</b> of grape solids back down into the fermenting juice. Now, however, extraction is normally brought about by a series of remontages. This involves pumping the juice {{from the bottom of the}} tank, then pouring it over the cap of grape solids to wash out the grapes' distinctive constituents. The temperature for alcoholic fermentation can be varied, but the normal average temperature at the height of fermentation is between 28 and 35 degrees Celsius. If the naturally generated temperature is too low, chaptalization may be carried out. This practice is subject to external regulations. Once alcoholic fermentation has finished, the liquid is removed from the tank and separated into free-run wine and press wine. Malolactic fermentation may take place next, but is dependent on temperature. The wine is drawn off and stored in barrels or vats to be matured. [...] The maturing process takes several months (6 to 24 months), after which the wine is fined, filtered and bottled.|$|E

Special issues such as the contribution of the soil profile, of the local amplification and of the rocking at the foundation level are dis-cussed. Soil-structure interaction is found to be essential for effective design of bridges especially for squat piers and soft soil...|$|R

The aim of the proposed research work {{was to develop a}} novel dual-compartment capsule (NDCC) with polymeric disc for gastroretentive dosage form, which will ultimately result in better solubility and bioavailability of Ofloxacin. <b>Floating</b> ring <b>caps</b> were formulated by using different natural polymers, separating ring band and swellable polymer located at the bottom of capsule. Formulated ring caps were assessed for coating thickness, In vitro buoyancy, In vitro drug release, release kinetics and stability studies. Coating attained by the capsule shell was found to be 0. 0643 mm. Depending on nature of natural polymer used, most of the formulations showed buoyancy for more than 9 hrs. Developed formulation demonstrated considerably higher drug release up to 9 hrs. The developed formulation FE 2 depicted the drug release according to Korsmeyer-Peppas model. There was not any significant change in performance characteristics of developed ring caps after subjecting them to stability studies. The present study suggests that the use of NDCC for oral delivery of Ofloxacin could be an alternative to improve its systemic availability which could be regulated by the floating approach. The designed dosage system can have futuristic applications over payloads which require stomach-specific delivery. 1...|$|R

40|$|The cold <b>cap</b> <b>floating</b> {{on top of}} {{the molten}} glass pool in liquid fed joule-heated ceramic melter plays an {{important}} role for operation of the vitrification process. A series of such phenomena as evaporation, melting and thermal decomposition of HLLW (high-level liquid waste) takes place within the cold-cap. An understanding of the varied thermal decomposition behavior of various nitrates constituting HLLW is necessary to elucidate a series of phenomena occurring within the cold-cap. In this study, reaction rates of the thermal decomposition reaction of 13 kinds of nitrates, which are main constituents of simulated HLLW (sHLLW), were investigated using thermogravimetrical instrument in a range of room temperature to 1000 [*]°C. The reaction rates of the thermal decompositions of 13 kinds of nitrates were depicted according to composition ratio (wt%) of each nitrate in sHLLW. It was found that the thermal decomposition of sHLLW could be predicted by the reaction rates and reaction temperatures of individual nitrates. The thermal decomposition of sHLLW with borosilicate glass system was also investigated. The above mentioned results will be able to provide a useful knowledge for understanding the phenomena occurring within the cold-cap...|$|R
40|$|Two {{synthesis}} pathways {{were employed}} throughout this work {{to create a}} variety of unique carbon materials. The first of these routes involves the photo-dissociation of liquids by direct irradiation with ultrashort laser pulses; while the second entails the bombardment of polycrystalline chemical layers by a pulsed laser induced carbon plasma. The pulsed laser irradiation (PLI) of liquid benzene (C 6 H 6) was found to result {{in the formation of}} amorphous carbon nanoparticles consisting of clusters of sp 2 -bonded aromatic rings bridged by sp hybridized polyyne functionalities. In a complimentary experiment, liquid toluene (C 6 H 5 CH 3) was irradiated under similar conditions leading to the synthesis of a series of free <b>floating</b> methyl <b>capped</b> polyynes, with chain lengths ranging from C 10 – C 20. The synthesis of polyynes is an active and cutting edge topic in material science and chemistry. In a more complex experiment, solutions of ferrocene and benzene were irradiated by fs-laser pulses resulting in highly ordered mesoscale structures exhibiting four unique geometries; ribbons, loops, tubes, and hollow spherical shells. After a purification process, the higher order structures were destroyed and replaced with nanoparticles consisting of three distinct species including; pure iron, and two phases in which part of the ferrocene molecule was bound to either carbon or iron/carbon complexes. This material is extremely interesting because it exhibits properties similar to that of an electret and is also ferromagnetic over a large temperature range. In the final liquid phase laser irradiation experiment, a new hybrid deposition technique was originated and used to coat stainless steel electrodes with disordered mesoporous nanocrystalline graphite. This method involves the laser induced breakdown of benzene and the subsequent electrodeposition of the resulting carbon ions. Another focus in this work involved the synthesis of a special class of polymer-like carbon nanomaterials using a new method that augments traditional pulsed laser deposition. This technique involves the plasma processing of frozen materials with a pulsed laser initiated graphitic plasma. We call this technique "pulsed laser induced plasma processing" or "PLIPP". Various thin film compositions were created by processing alkane and alkene ices. Finally, in a slight departure from the previous experiments, the effects of carbon ion bombardment on water ice were examined in an effort to understand certain astrophysical processes...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to prepare and {{evaluate}} gastro-retentive <b>floating</b> calcium pectinate (<b>CaP)</b> emulsion gel (EMG) beads, by the application of emulsion-gelation method and using riboflavin (RF) as amodel drug. Eight EMG beads formulations were prepared. Effect of variables such as pectin concentration,homogenization and curing times on preparation of appropriate beads was studied. The potential ofglutaraldehyde as a crosslinking agent, added to the curing liquid (0. 5 - 2 % w/v), for modifying the RF releasewas investigated. Beads formulations were then assessed for their physical characteristics including, percentageyield, morphology, particle size, flow properties, density, buoyancy as well as drug release characteristics. Results revealed that all EMG beads showed a density ≤ 1, a floating lag time less than 1 minute and buoyancyfor more than 24 hours. Release studies indicated that increasing the drug concentration from 0. 06 (F 1) to 0. 1 %(F 2) in the beads slightly slowed the drug release, where about 70 and 50 % of drug content were released in 60 minutes, respectively. For both F 1 and F 2, using 2 %w/v glutaraldehyde as a hardening agent entrapped the drugin the beads and hindered its release (T 50 % was nearly 24 hours), whereas using 0. 5 % glutaraldehyde offeredappropriate sustained drug release patterns (T 50 % were 3 and 4 hours for F 1 CL 0. 5 % and F 2 CL 0. 5 %). In conclusion,EMG beads of CaP could be used as suitable carriers for intragastric floating drug delivery and their releasebehavior could be modified by hardening with glutaraldehyde...|$|R

Apart from this, there are many changes that have taken place during the recent years both at the macroeconomic level as well as specific sector level. We observe that (i) foreign investment inflows (FII) have increased from Rs. 224.5 billion in the year 2000 to Rs. 2546.53 billion in 2014, (ii) Growth rate of gross domestic product (GDP) has been varying between 3.8 % to 9.6 % during the same period, and (iii) Private capital formation has changed from Rs. 1065. 24 billion in the year 2000 to 9978.16 billion in the year 2014 (Source: RBI, various annual reports and Handbooks of Statistics on Indian Economy). We also observe that short term interest rate (repo rate) has changed frequently, that reached an all-time high of 14.50 % in August of 2000 and a record low of 4.25 % in April of 2009. All these above-mentioned changes may affect the alternative sources of finance for investments and also the average lending rates of the commercial banks and financial institutions. “India is fifteen years ahead of China in economic and financial market reforms. Interest rates in India are market determined with the RBI doing away with ad hoc government funding in the late 1990 s. Government borrowing costs are market determined with the government bond yield curve being the benchmark that determines the borrowing costs for state governments, municipal corporations, banks and corporates.

60|$|To my {{surprise}} I touched bottom, for I had deemed {{that the water}} was very deep thereby. Next I found that I was standing on a step of hewn stone, and that a concealed staircase, cut in the rock, goes down, in that place, to {{the very bottom of}} the moat; for what purpose I know not, but so it is. {11} I climbed up the steps, shook myself, and wrung the water out of my hair, looking about the while for any sign of my enemy, who had blasphemed against my country and the Maiden. But there was nothing to see on the water save my own cloth <b>cap</b> <b>floating.</b> On {{the other side of the}} fosse, howbeit, men were launching a pleasure-boat, which lay by a stair at the foot of the further wall of the fosse. The sight of them made me glad to creep further up the steps that rounded a sharp corner, till I came as far as an iron wicket-gate, which seemed to cut off my retreat. There I stopped, deeming that the wicket must be locked. The men were now rowing the boat into the middle of the water, so, without expecting to find the gate open, I tried the handle. It turned, to my no little amazement; the gate swang lightly aside, as if its hinges had been newly oiled, and I followed the staircase, creeping up the slimy steps in the half-dark. Up and round I went, till I was wellnigh giddy, and then I tripped and reeled so that my body struck against a heavy ironed door.

30|$|It {{is clearly}} {{observed}} in FESEM image of Fig.  1 that the particle size of catalyst is changed, but {{this change is}} small {{as compared to the}} change in the diameter of CNTs. The maximum diameter of the catalyst particle observed is 90  nm (Fig.  1 a) for the catalyst film treated at 100  °C/h, whereas the minimum diameter of 20  nm (see Fig.  1 d) was found for the catalyst prepared at 600  °C/h; so the difference between minimum and maximum diameter of catalyst particle is only 4.5 times. For average diameter is concerned, it was observed that the average diameter of grown CNTs at 100  °C/h is around 70  nm while average diameter of grown CNTs at 600  °C/h is approximately 2  nm. So, difference in average diameter of CNTs for both cases is around 35 times. In addition to this, catalyst particles having diameter of 20  nm produced CNTs with diameter of 2  nm only. So, if diameter of CNTs is controlled by diameter of catalyst particle then grown CNTs must also have same range of diameter, and that did not happen in the present case. According to the existing growth mechanism theory [17], a carbon atom is first attached to the boundary of the catalyst particle and then more carbon atoms join them, resulting in a graphene cap on the catalyst particle. This graphene <b>cap</b> <b>float</b> over the catalyst particle with the boundary atoms of the graphene cap remains attached to the catalyst particle. Later on, more carbon atoms attached to the boundary atoms of graphene which causes the upward motion of graphene cap and therefore the formation of a cylindrical wall. So, in this case when carbon atoms attached on the boundary of catalyst particles then diameter of CNTs can be approximated same as diameter of catalyst. The researchers concluded that the effective attachment of carbon atom and, thereby, the formation of graphene network crucially depend on monoatomic steps at the boundary of the catalyst particle.|$|R
