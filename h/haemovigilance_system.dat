40|$|BACKGROUND Adverse {{reactions}} and preventive actions have accompanied transfusion medicine fromits beginning. Because of this, a <b>haemovigilance</b> <b>system</b> is imperative. The development ofthe <b>haemovigilance</b> <b>system</b> {{is taking place}} in Slovenia from 2000 ever since Law on BloodProcurement was adopted. METHODS The data of all adverse reactions was collected from 2002 in all hospitals where bloodtransfusions were being performed. Later, the collection of data of transfusion related unexpected red cell antibodies, near-miss events and of adverse {{reactions and}} events related tothe process begining with blood donation to the issuing of blood have begun. RESULTS From 2002 to 2006 there were 697 reports collected of nearly all types of adverse reactionsand events, with no report of any long-time morbidity or transfusion related deaths. 46 reactions were severe. There were considerable differences among Slovenian hospitalsbetween the number of reports compared to the number of blood components issued,ranging from 1 to 3. 5 adverse reactions per 1000 blood components issued. CONCLUSIONS The quality of adverse reactions and events reporting has been improving from 2002 to 2006.  The collected data represents the basis for the identification of critical points in theblood tranfusion chain as well as the improvement of blood transfusion safet...|$|E
40|$|Although {{the risk}} of transfusion-transmitted infections today is lower than ever, the supply of safe blood {{products}} remains subject to contamination with known and yet to be identified human pathogens. Only continuous improvement and implementation of donor selection, sensitive screening tests and effective inactivation procedures can ensure the elimination, or at least reduction, of {{the risk of}} acquiring transfusion transmitted infections. In addition, ongoing education and up-to-date information regarding infectious agents that are potentially transmitted via blood components is necessary to promote the reporting of adverse events, an important component of transfusion transmitted disease surveillance. Thus, the collaboration of all parties involved in transfusion medicine, including national <b>haemovigilance</b> <b>systems,</b> is crucial for protecting a secure blood product supply from known and emerging blood-borne pathogens...|$|R
40|$|Background. Haemovigilance {{hinges on}} a {{systematically}} structured reporting system, which unfortunately {{does not always}} exist in resource-limited settings. We determined the incidence and pattern of transfusion-related adverse events reported to the National Blood Service Zimbabwe. Materials and methods. A retrospective review of the transfusion-event records of the National Blood Service Zimbabwe was conducted covering the period from 1 January 1999 to 31 December 2011. All transfusion-related event reports received during the period were analysed. Results. A total of 308 transfusion adverse events (0. 046 %) were reported for 670, 625 blood components distributed. The majority (61. 6 %) of the patients who experienced an adverse event were female. The median age was 36 years (range, 1 - 89 years). The majority (68. 8 %) of the adverse events were acute transfusion reactions consisting of febrile non-haemolytic transfusion reactions (58. 5 %), minor allergies (31. 6 %), haemolytic reactions (5. 2 %), severe allergic reactions (2. 4 %), anaphylaxis (1. 4 %) and hypotension (0. 9 %). Two-thirds (66. 6 %) of the adverse events occurred following administration of whole blood, although only 10. 6 % of the blood was distributed as whole blood. Packed cells, which accounted for 75 % of blood components distributed, were associated with 20. 1 % of the events. Discussion. The incidence of suspected transfusion adverse events was generally lower than the incidences reported globally in countries with well-established <b>haemovigilance</b> <b>systems.</b> The administration of whole blood was disproportionately associated with transfusion adverse events. The pattern of the transfusion adverse events reported here highlights the probable differences in practice between different settings. Under-reporting of transfusion events is rife in passive reporting systems. © SIMTI Servizi Srl...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{describe}} a newly implemented <b>haemovigilance</b> <b>system</b> in a general university hospital. We present a series of short cases, highlighting particular aspects of the reports, and an overview of all reported incidents between 1999 and 2001. Incidents related to transfusion of blood products were reported by the clinicians using a standard preformatted form, giving a synopsis of the incident. After analysis, we distinguished, on the one hand, transfusion reactions, that are transfusions which engendered signs or symptoms, and, on the other hand, the incidents where management errors and/or dysfunctions took place. Over 3 years, 233 incidents were reported, corresponding to 4. 2 events for 1000 blood products delivered. Of the 233, 198 (85 %) were acute transfusion reactions and 35 (15 %) were management errors and/or dysfunctions. Platelet units gave rise to statistically (P < 0. 001) more transfusion reactions (10. 7 per thousand) than red blood cells (3. 5 per thousand) and fresh frozen plasma (0. 8 per thousand), particularly febrile nonhaemolytic transfusion reactions and allergic reactions. A detailed analysis of some of the transfusion incident reports revealed complex deviations and/or failures of the procedures in place in the hospital, allowing the implementation of corrective and preventive measures. Thus, the <b>haemovigilance</b> <b>system</b> in place in the 'Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois, CHUV' appears to constitute an excellent instrument for monitoring the security of blood transfusion...|$|E

This study is directed to determine the prevalence of P. falciparum infection and anti MSP 1 - 19 among clinically healthy blood donors as an example for <b>haemovigilance</b> <b>system,</b> and to initiate a <b>haemovigilance</b> <b>system</b> to improve blood transfusion safety and efficacy, {{for the first time in}} Sudan in police hospital blood bank. Beside examination that concern safety of blood transfusion which include HIV and HBV, screening for P. falciparum malaria has been included in this study.

40|$|The <b>haemovigilance</b> <b>system</b> in the U. K., the Serious Hazards of Transfusion (SHOT) scheme, was {{established}} in 1996 to collect reports of major adverse events associated with the transfusion of blood components. 92 % of eligible hospitals now participate in the scheme. The number of reports has increased every year due {{to an increase in}} the most frequent reported event, which is incorrect blood transfused (IBCT). Other complications of transfusion are all represented to a varying degree, but episodes of transfusion-transmitted infection are infrequent. The SHOT scheme has made many recommendations to improve the safety of transfusion, including that further research should be carried out into information technology solutions for safer transfusion, and into new strategies for reducing bacterial contamination and transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{recognition}} {{and management of}} transfusion reactions (TRs) are critical to ensure patient safety during and after a blood transfusion. Transfusion reactions are classified into acute transfusion reactions (ATRs) or delayed transfusion reactions, and each category includes different subtypes. Different ATRs share common signs and symptoms which can make categorisation difficult {{at the beginning of}} the reaction. Moreover, TRs are often under-recognised and under-reported. To ensure uniform practice and safety, it is necessary to implement a national <b>haemovigilance</b> <b>system</b> and a set of national guidelines establishing policies for blood transfusion and for the detection and management of TRs. In Oman, there are currently no local TR guidelines to guide physicians and hospital blood banks. This paper summarises the available literature and provides consensus guidelines to be used in the recognition, management and reporting of ATRs...|$|E
40|$|Background and {{objectives}} Monitoring the whole {{chain of events}} from the blood donors to recipients, documenting any undesirable or untoward effects and introducing measures to prevent their recurrence if possible, are components of haemovigilance systems. Only few sub-Saharan African countries have haemovigilance systems and there are very little data on adverse events of transfusion.

40|$|Background. Haemovigilance is {{a system}} {{consisting}} of the detection, collecting and analysis of information regarding unwanted and unexpected effects of blood transfusion that {{make it possible to}} take action in order to improve blood trasfusion safety. In a broader sense, it is defined as a set of surveillance procedures covering the whole transfusion chain from the collection of blood to the follow-up of recipients. In some European countries a <b>haemovigilance</b> <b>system</b> based on legislation was introduced during the last ten years, European Haemovigilance Network was organised and some results from the existing surveillance systems were reported. The paper presents haemovigilance activities in Slovenia. Conclusions. In Slovenia, many elements of haemovigilance are already included in the blood transfusion chain, but no unique system of data collection exists. We expect a new legislation on blood transfusion to help us with introducing a data collection system, analysis and activities in order to further improve blood transfusion safety. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background. The risk {{of severe}} adverse events to blood {{transfusion}} is very low. More frequent are adverse events to transfusion, {{which are not}} severe, but must also be treated. Introduction of the <b>haemovigilance</b> <b>system</b> {{is a way of}} detecting and analysing them in order to correct their cause and to prevent their recurrence. Methods. In 2002 we collected data on transfusion adverse events registered by the Blood Transfusion Centre of Slovenia and blood transfusion departments in Slovene general hospitals. Results. 86 adverse events to transfusion were reported in 2002.  The most frequent were non-haemolytic fever (42 cases) and allergic reactions (27 cases). 5 cases of haemolysis and 1 of pulmonary oedema were also reported. 11 cases were not categorised. Conclusions. We suppose that the collected data is not complete. However, it does give us insight into the clinical part of the transfusion chain. The most frequently registered adverse events in Slovenia are the same as in other countries. The presented data {{is the beginning of a}} systematic registration, using standard forms and reporting. Analysis and a followup activities are the basis for improvement of the blood transfusion safety and quality of treatment. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: A <b>haemovigilance</b> <b>system</b> {{makes it}} {{possible}} to identify critical points in blood transfusion chain from blood collection to the patient and to introduce new measures, thus creating conditions for better transfusion safety. Methods: Data on haemovigilance in Slovenia in years 2003 – 2010 were obtained from annual reports. The collected data were systematically and chronologically arranged, displayed in tables and analyzed using descriptive statistical methods. Results: From 2003 to 2010, there were 1, 333 adverse reactions reported: 511 allergic, 25 anaphylactoid, 604 febrile nonhaemolytic, 22 haemolytic reactions, 4 TRALI, 69 TACO, 11 suspected transfusion-transmitted infections and 74 cases classified as others. From 2003 – 2010, 104 (7. 8 %) reactions were considered severe. There are considerable differences among Slovenian hospitals as to the number of reports, ranging from 0. 4 to 3. 1 per 1, 000 blood components issued in 2010. Severe adverse events were reported, such as wrong blood in test tubes and incorrect blood component transfused. There were also some severe adverse reactions reported during the collection of blood from donors, defective plastic blood bags, positive test results and adverse events during the storage and distribution of blood. Conclusions: The collected data are the foundation for the improvement of blood safety by implementing new technologies as well as continuous training of clinical and transfusion staff and optimal blood usage...|$|E
40|$|In 2001, the WHO Office for Africa {{adopted a}} {{strategy}} for blood safety defining four targets. This paper describes the progress made by Mauritius {{in the implementation of}} this strategy. The blood safety indicators were collected and compared with the norms recommended by WHO. The country has formulated its blood policy and developed a strategic plan for its implementation since 2004. The total number of blood donations increased from 31, 228 in 2002 to 43, 742 in 2016, giving an annual blood collection rate evolving from 26. 3 per 1000 inhabitants in 2002 to 34. 2 per 1000 inhabitants in 2016. The percentage of voluntary donations rose from 60 % to 82. 5 %. Since 2002, all the blood units collected have been tested for the mandatory infectious markers. The Blood Transfusion Service has been certified ISO 2008 - 9001 and nucleic acid testing has been introduced. The preparation of blood components increased from 60 % to 98. 2 %. The most transfused blood components were red cell concentrates, platelet concentrates, and fresh frozen plasma. In addition to transfusion activities, there were other departments performing antenatal serology, tissue typing, special investigations, and reagent preparation. Despite the progress made, some challenges remain, namely, legal framework and <b>haemovigilance</b> <b>system.</b> A regulatory system for blood needs to be established...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the frequency and}} type of Acute Transfusion Reactions (ATRs) occurring in inpatients, reported to the transfusion service at Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan. Methods: This was a three years and seven months (from January 2005 till July 2008) retrospective review of all the transfusion reactions that were reported to the transfusion service at Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan. All the reactions were clinically evaluated by the blood bank physician. Transfusion reactions occurring during or within four hours after transfusion were evaluated and classified by standard and recognized definitions defined by American Association of Blood Banks. Results: The acute transfusion reactions (ATRs) reported {{during the study period}} were 212. However, out of these 212 ATRs, 182 ATRs were confirmed by blood bank physician, and included febrile non haemolytic reactions [89 (41. 9 %) ], allergic reaction [73 (34. 4 %) ], isolated hypotension [3 (1. 4 %) ], haemolytic reaction [4 (1. 8 %) ] and bacterial contamination [2 (0. 9 %) ]. Eleven (5. 1 %) ATRs were unclassifiable and were thus labeled as non specific reaction. Conclusion: The frequency of transfusion reactions in our patients was found to be 0. 082 %. Febrile non haemolytic reaction was the most frequent transfusion reaction followed by allergic reaction. This may be an under reported figure. There is a need for establishing a <b>haemovigilance</b> <b>system</b> for critical analysis of blood transfusion event...|$|E
40|$|Background: With the {{implementation}} of NAT in countries around the world, {{there is a growing}} pressure on the transfusion services in India to adopt NAT testing. India has about 2545 licensed Blood Centres. The Transfusion Services in India are fragmented, poorly regulated and the quality standards are poorly implemented. Blood Centres are still dependent on replacement/family donors and in most places laboratory testing for Transfusion transmitted infections is not quality assured, laboratory equipment are not calibrated and maintained, and validation of results is not carried out. Against the current scenario introducing NAT for screening of blood donors in India would pose a challenge. Aim: To study the prudence of universal NAT testing in India. Materials and Methods : A retrospective study of 5 years from 2008 - 2012 was undertaken to study the true reactivity of donors using WHO strategy II and III and therefore the true seroprevalence of TTI infections in the donor populations. Results : The true reactivity of the donors was much less as compared to the initially reactive donors due to the use of a well designed testing algorithm. In addition having a total voluntary blood collection along with good pre-donation counseling program also reduces the transmission of infections. Conclusions : What India essentially needs to do is religiously implement the strategies outlined in the WHO Aide-memoire. The blood should be collected only from voluntary non remunerative and repeat donors, there should be stringent donor selection with pre-donation counseling instituted. Strict implementation of quality management system, development of well defined testing startegies and strong <b>haemovigilance</b> <b>system</b> could take us {{a step in the right}} direction...|$|E
40|$|SHOT (Serious Hazards of Transfusion scheme) is the UK’s National {{confidential}} <b>haemovigilance</b> <b>system,</b> and {{was set up}} in 1996. It is an independent, confidential, professionally led haemovigilance scheme. Initially {{the reporting}} was voluntary but now required by several professional bodies. SHOT publishes annual reports with recommendations and circulates to all relevant organizations including the 4 UK Blood services, Departments of Health in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, all relevant professional bodies and reporting hospitals. Over the 17 years of reporting, the evidence gathered has prompted changes in transfusion practice from the selection and management of donors to changes in hospital practice, better education and training. Acute transfusion reactions and transfusion-associated circulatory overload carry the highest risk for morbidity and death. Greatest risk to patients remain errors in the process at the point of blood sampling, in the laboratory and at bedside administration. SHOT’s objectives are to use findings to improve standards of hospital transfusion practice, to educate users on transfusion hazards and prevention, to aid production of clinical guidelines in blood transfusion and to inform national policy on transfusion safety. MHRA is the UK competent authority to which serious adverse reactions and events have to be reported annually. Overall the most common adverse incidents are caused by errors, resulting in the transfusion of an incorrect component or one that does not meet the specific requirements of the patient (e. g. not irradiated or not appropriately antigen matched). TACO (transfusion associated circulatory overload) accounts for most deaths and major morbidity reported to SHOT but is overall underreported. Transfusions are not always given appropriately. This may be due to wrong haemoglobin results, failure to assess patients appropriately, or avoidable use of emergency O RhD negative units because of poor communication or planning. Review of cases of haemolytic transfusion reactions (HTR) shows that they are observed mainly in Sickle Cell Disease patients. HTR are associated with major morbidity (10 / 16 cases in sickle cell patients over 3 years) and death (a child in 2010). SCD patients are at particular risk of alloimmunization and this can be reduced by red cell phenotyping prior to the first transfusion followed by routine matching for at least the Rh and Kell groups. SHOT output data led over the time to the development of strategies to improve transfusion safety such as the implementation of guidelines for improving practice, implementation of the National Comparative Audit of Blood Transfusion programme, the publication of the Better blood transfusion initiatives and the establishment of The UK transfusion laboratory collaborative...|$|E
