The growth of development teams increased the likelihood that software bugs would appear, as code produced by programmers working in different teams was merged <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole.</b> A lack of technical standards among hardware manufacturers forced developers to support each manufacturer's implementation, or risk losing players.|$|E
5|$|If Sedna {{formed in}} its current location, the Sun's {{original}} protoplanetary disc must have extended as far as 75AU into space. Also, Sedna's initial orbit must have been approximately circular, otherwise its formation by the accretion of smaller bodies <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> {{would not have been}} possible, because the large relative velocities between planetesimals would have been too disruptive. Therefore, it must have been tugged into its current eccentric orbit by a gravitational interaction with another body. In their initial paper, Brown, Rabinowitz and colleagues suggested three possible candidates for the perturbing body: an unseen planet beyond the Kuiper belt, a single passing star, or one of the young stars embedded with the Sun in the stellar cluster in which it formed.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} Creangă's death, efforts began {{to collect his}} {{manuscript}} writings and the updated versions of his printed works. This project involved his son Constantin, alongside A. D. Xenopol, Grigore Alexandrescu and Eduard Gruber, the latter of whom obtained the works from Tinca Vartic. The first edition was published as two volumes, in 1890–1892, but the project {{came to an abrupt}} halt due to Gruber's insanity and death. Creangă's final known work, the fragment of Făt-frumos, fiul iepei, was published by Convorbiri Literare in 1898. The Gruber copies were sold to a Dr. Mendel, and only a part of them was recovered by exegetes, alongside various fragments accidentally discovered at Iași market, where they were being used for wrapping paper. The collection, structured <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> by folklorist Gheorghe T. Kirileanu, was published by Editura Minerva in 1902 and 1906. In addition to being mentioned in the memoirs of several prominent Junimists, Creangă had his political career fictionalized and satirized by Iacob Negruzzi, who transformed him, as Popa Smântână, into a character of his satirical poems Electorale ("Electorals"). The same author referred to his counterpart in one of his epigrams.|$|E

25|$|The {{paintings}} {{from this period}} are most remarkable for the vividness of the extreme violence and even the human denigration that is often depicted. Such representations are however, also rich in a lyrical content that was to characterise the artist from then on. The juxtaposition of the international tendencies that formed Orellana took a more definite form in this period: his old Spanish inheritance, the input from America, the wealth of archaeological culture and Italy with Conceptualism and Arte Povera. The artist had a solo show at the stand of Juana Mordo at the FIAC 1978, Paris, France. These amalgamated <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> that {{paved the way for}} new developments in Orellana's work.|$|E

25|$|Items must be {{collected}} and moved round the screen or {{placed in the}} inventory box to complete cases. Characters will either offer the player objects, or the player must seek out items that can be taken. Collectible items can be kept for later use by dragging the object into the Inventory box. Players must also look for scraps of the Carmen Notes, which describe where each thief will hide. These notes have each been torn into three pieces {{to make them more}} difficult to find. The player must click on the scraps of paper to assemble them <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> note. Once all the pieces of the Carmen note are found, the ACME handcuffs (known as Time Cuffs) activate and the player can decode Carmen's message to deduce her henchmen's location. Using the Time Cuffs on the relevant object reveals the thief, whom the Good Guide then arrests. After capturing each crook (with Dee Cryption captured once and the others captured twice), the player pursues Carmen herself.|$|E
25|$|Avicenna's {{psychology}} {{requires that}} {{connection between the}} body and soul {{be strong enough to}} ensure the soul's individuation, but weak enough to allow for its immortality. Avicenna grounds his psychology on physiology, which means his account of the soul is one that deals almost entirely with the natural science of the body and its abilities of perception. Thus, the philosopher's connection between the soul and body is explained almost entirely by his understanding of perception; in this way, bodily perception interrelates with the immaterial human intellect. In sense perception, the perceiver senses the form of the object; first, by perceiving features of the object by our external senses. This sensory information is supplied to the internal senses, which merge all the pieces <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole,</b> unified conscious experience. This process of perception and abstraction is the nexus of the soul and body, for the material body may only perceive material objects, while the immaterial soul may only receive the immaterial, universal forms. The way the soul and body interact in the final abstraction of the universal from the concrete particular is the key to their relationship and interaction, which takes place in the physical body.|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from fans and television critics. It was named by Vanity Fairs John Ortved as the show's fifth best episode. Ortved said, [...] "While the Simpsons {{people have always}} claimed evenhandedness in their satire, the show is, after all, hardly right-leaning, {{and it is hard}} to miss how gleefully the former President is mocked here." [...] Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, the authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, wrote: [...] "Very strange, this episode takes The Simpsons <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> new dimension of political satire.

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} {{and has been}} cited by many critics {{as one of the}} best in the series, with several commentators calling the twist ending shocking, unexpected and likely to change the direction of the entire series. Entertainment Weekly television writer Ken Tucker praised the twist of the episode, which he said [...] "sent the series spinning <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> new direction for next season". Tucker praised the Dexter writing staff, [...] "for maintaining the suspense while creating a whole new world within the Dexter world: the awful universe of Trinity and his own trapped family." [...] Bill Harris of the Toronto Sun said the episode was good before the final scene, but that the twist shed a whole different light on several scenes. Harris said of the twist, [...] "It's nice to know TV can still be that impactful, isn't it? But my God, what a stunner." ...|$|E

This two-part vocal fades as a solo harmonica plays a melody {{on top of the}} persistent quarter-note bass line and maraca that maintain the only rhythm throughout Episode 2. The section ends with a five-part harmony vocalizing a whole-note chord that is sustained by reverb for a further four beats. Lambert calls it the song's [...] "wake-up chord {{at the end of the}} meditation that transports the concept <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> new realm: it's an iconic moment among iconic moments.

When he learnt that the team would be building off each other’s work, he voiced concern that the finished product could be disjointed. After sharing his work with the team, he was particularly impressed by Froese's contributions. [...] "Edgar evolved the music, made it <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> other thing", Jackson said. Froese had interpolated funk sounds with Jackson’s hip-hop influences. Froese and Jackson then sent their work between The Alchemist and Oh No, who heavily sampled it. The Alchemist opined, [...] "We were sampling, taking a piece form here, a piece from there...We pitched stuff up, chopped it, tweaked it. Then we chose the tracks that worked and everyone came in and layered on that". DJ Shadow then mixed the team's creations together and matched it to the gameplay. Pavlovich considered [...] "how to make the hip-hop and rock score not sound like they were instrumentals of songs on the radio, but rather something unique to the score" [...] a challenge.|$|E
