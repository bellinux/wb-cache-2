40|$|During {{the last}} decade, {{agricultural}} commodity markets have experienced increasing volatility. In addition, {{the drop of}} coupled price support stressed that the philosophy of intervention of the CAP will leave European farmers more directly exposed to output price fluctuations. Our data analysis is a first attempt to investigate two main issues: on one hand we investigated how {{the changing of the}} EU first pillar policy, and the moving to a total decoupled intervention, affected the income variability of Italian farms; on the other hand we focused on the potential effects of farm characteristics on income variability. Our empirical analysis highlights that the increasing prices volatility has affected farm revenues and the change of EU policy support made market components less relevant for income stabilization objectives. On the contrary, <b>decoupled</b> <b>aids</b> are likely to have reduced the impact of last two year volatility. Moreover, we found that the stabilization role of EU policies have played a not negligible role in stabilizing farm incomes...|$|R

40|$|Event-driven {{programming}} {{has become}} a major paradigm in developing concurrent, distributed systems. Its benefits are often informally captured by the key tenet of “decoupling”, a notion which roughly captures the ability of modules to join and leave (or fail) applications dynamically, and to be developed by independent parties. Programming models for event-driven programming either make it hard to reason about global control flow, thus hampering sound execution, or sacrifice <b>decoupling</b> to <b>aid</b> in reasoning about control flow. This work fills the gap by introducing a programming model – dubbed cooperative decoupled processes – that achieves both decoupling and reasoning about global control flow. We introduce this programming model through an event calculus, loosely inspired by the Join calculus, that enables reasoning about cooperative decoupled processes through the concepts of pre- and postconditions. A linear type system controls aliasing of events to ensure uniqueness of control flow and thus safe exchange of shared events. Fundamental properties of the type system such as subject reduction, migration safety, and progress are established...|$|R
40|$|The {{compromise}} text for {{reform of the}} CAP was distributed at the June EU Agricultural Council meeting. It proposed a number of changes, notably: establishing an earlier start date for modulation; increasing support for young farmers through the rural development regulation; the maintenance of rotational set aside; the exclusion of certain payments from decoupling, including sheep and goat supplementary payments in less favoured and mountain regions, drying aid for cereals, and direct payments in outermost regions. A decision on additional quotas in the dairy sector was deferred as was decoupling pending the full implementation of dairy sector reform. A decision on the {{compromise text}} was deferred to allow member states more time to reflect. Comment: The decision to defer decoupling in the dairy sector until reform is completed, gives a clear indication that for other sectors such as sugar, substantial reform involving price reductions and increased product-specific direct aid payments will have to precede the incorporation of the sector into the single <b>decoupled</b> farm <b>aid</b> payments scheme.

40|$|Addressing the US Congress on February 5 th 2003 Commissioner Fischler set out {{the link}} between the EU's reform of the CAP and the EU's {{approach}} to the WTO agreement on agriculture. He claimed that EU policy has been 'gradually but consistently changing' and that there has been 'a clear move away from the most trade- and production-distorting measures of support'. He maintained that the EU was pursuing a policy of 'support of our farmers while further reducing trade distortion and production distortion'. He pointed out that the EU budget would only increase 1 % per annum between 2006 and 2013, despite a 50 % {{increase in the number of}} farmers to be assisted as a result of enlargement, and that the most important element of reform was 'a total <b>decoupling</b> of direct <b>aid</b> from production' and an increased emphasis on rural development. Against this background of CAP reform Commissioner Fischler maintained that EU proposals in the WTO 'take full account of the interests of the most important group of countries in the negotiations, the developing countries' He maintained that EU proposals did this by proposing increased access for developing country products and additional flexibility for developing countries in implementing their commitments. He also forcefully argued for the accommodation of non-trade concerns in any agricultural agreement, maintaining that this was not simply a ruse to hide increased farm expenditures. Having criticised US proposals, Commissioner Fischler closed by emphasising that both the USA and the EU will want to 'continue to support farmers and rural areas for the foreseeable future' and that therefore it was important to find common ground on this issue. Comment: Commissioner Fischler's statement on the move towards 'a total <b>decoupling</b> of direct <b>aid</b> from production' stands in distinct contrast to the assurances given to EU agriculture ministers only a few days before that the process of de-coupling support will be limited where 'there is a genuine risk of production dropping to unacceptable levels'. Clearly when talking to a domestic audience the Commissioner places a somewhat different emphasis on the overall trajectory of CAP reform. The emphasis on finding common ground, given a continued desire of the EU and USA to support farmers and rural areas, provides some indication of where a consensus could lie in their approaches to the WTO agricultural negotiations.

40|$|In a paper {{submitted}} to the Annual World Bank Conference on Development Economics in Paris on May 15 - 16 th 2003 the experience of <b>decoupling</b> farm <b>aid</b> payments in the USA, EU, Mexico and Turkey was reviewed. The paper starts with {{a review of the}} impact of current agricultural support programmes which stimulate overproduction and depress prices, which in turn requires higher levels of support. It points out that most of the benefits of these support programmes are captured by large farms and input-supply industries. It highlights the international spill-over effects of domestic support policies, which either reduce imports or expand exports 'lowering world prices to the detriment of competitive suppliers elsewhere. This it argues needs to be seen against the background of 'the long-term trend of agricultural productivity growing more rapidly than demand' which 'implies continued adjustment pressures at the global level, with agricultural support simply shifting the burden of adjustment to other non-subsidizing countries'. It is against this background that decoupling is then considered. The major argument for decoupling is that 'budgetary payments that are decoupled from agricultural activity altogether would transfer income to selected households most efficiently' so that the 'economic distortions and distributive leakages are thereby minimised'. The benefits of this are 'reduced costs to consumers and taxpayers, improved trade opportunities for competitive suppliers, less stress on the environment and more effective policies to achieve goals'. In reviewing the overall experience of decoupling to date the paper concludes that the results have 'not been encouraging'. It argues that the ideal form of decoupling would be across the whole of the agricultural sector and describes sector-specific decoupling as the third-best option, although it would be a move in the right direction. It argues that if decoupling is not to become simply another subsidy programme it: should be in the form of taxpayer-funded payments that should not require production. Indeed, 'land, labour or any other input should not have to be in agricultural use'; should have eligibility rules that are clearly defined and unchangeable; should not exist in parallel with coupled programmes of support, since these provide incentives to overproduction; should have time limits on the life of the programme; should feature farm payments whose level, both in aggregate and per farm, should be bound at the WTO. Comment: The paper's exploration of the different definitions of decoupling in use suggests that it is very important for ACP countries to actively participate in debates around decoupling in the WTO in order to avoid 'dirty decoupling', that is decoupling which continues to massively distort international trade.

The analysis integrates the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and the Life Cycle Costing (LCC) methods by using a common database. The environmental analysis carried out through LCA has shown a better performance of the HDO system for all the impact categories, due to a lower use of energy and chemical inputs and to higher olive yields. Also from an economic point of view the HDO could be considered more convenient than the SHDO: in fact, despite the lower operating costs of the latter due to the complete mechanization of pruning and harvesting operations, these costs are counterbalanced by higher initial investment costs that the company {{has to face}} which are three times those of the HDO system. The total result is that the Net Present Value is better for the HDO for each olive price level. This result is mainly driven by lower plantation costs, longer production cycle, higher production of olives and higher efficiency in the use of inputs which characterize the HDO model...|$|R
40|$|The 42 nd Meeting of the Research Centre for Appraisal and Land Economics (Ce. S. E. T.) focused its {{attention}} on land markets, {{given that the}} new Common Agricultural Policy, which has proposed strong reforms that have been much discussed, has arrived at an advanced stage of definition. The land market theme, although little contemplated in economic evaluations of agricultural policies, is an essential topic for the understanding of development processes, especially after the economic crisis linked to real estate appraisal. The hypotheses of totally <b>decoupling</b> direct <b>aid,</b> adopting undifferentiated payments per hectare, and introducing a bonus for "greening", as contemplated in the CAP reform proposal, could significantly modify the present equilibrium in terms of competitiveness between crops and, more in general, {{the structure of the}} sector itself. Following an in-depth analysis of the specific elements of the extant CAP reform and those linked to other communautaire measures, such as the liberalization of planting rights for vineyards and further elements of a structural nature where other economic and social activities are competing for land use, it is possible to appreciate the tensions in the market as regards current and future rural funds. The multidisciplinary perspective that characterized the meeting held in Palermo, allowed us to compare and integrate different theoretical and operational approaches, while examining in detail all the aspects dealt with, both from an appraisal and from a territorial economy standpoint. The most important Italian researchers in estimates and legal affairs and the main actors on the territory, like the Natural Resources Agency, the National Institute of Agricultural Economics and a delegate of the Agronomy and Forestry Doctors' Order, attended the meeting. Furthermore the contribution of Professor Giovanni La Via, member of the European Parliament should be emphasized; he is an academic of the appraisal of farmland and a BUDG rapporteur of the European Parliament, who defined the dynamics of land values {{in the light of the}} most updated forecasts of the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. The interesting researches presented during the meeting were organized, as a consequence of the multidisciplinary nature of the meeting, in three parallel sessions, with the aim of promoting a comparison between the various theoretical and operational approaches: "The agricultural policy instruments and their effects on land values"; "The dynamics and the appraisal of land property values"; "The evaluation of public assets in rural areas". During the conference many research ideas were put forward, there was a mutual enrichment of knowledge while issues to be developed emerged. It is the hope of the Centre that the debate and the dialogue between all the parties involved will continue. As the principle of multidisciplinary debate is innate in Ce. S. E. T., it undertakes to promote opportunities for study and discussion that favour this process. Finally, I wish to express, also in the names of the entire Ce. S. E. T. scientific committee, sincere gratitude towards Professor Maria Crescimanno and all the organizers for the quality of the event, for welcoming everyone and, above all, for the scientific level of the contributions formalized through the ISI certification process of the proceedings.

40|$|The September World Bank paper 'Cancun: Crisis or Catharsis' {{sets out}} the {{importance}} of a successful conclusion to the Doha Development Round to developing countries, and reviews: the coalitions which formed in Cancun around agricultural issues; the debate on the 'Singapore issues' and the positions adopted; and the implications of the failure of Cancun. In this latter regard it highlights: how Cancun illustrated that 'realising the promise of trade reforms through reciprocal bargaining is a major challenge', with successful negotiations requiring an agenda that is seen to be relevant to the needs and objectives of all parties; how 'developing countries are playing an ever more pro-active role in the WTO', with the larger developing countries demonstrating that they can put together and sustain negotiating alliances, even though national interests may differ; how 'the reciprocity dynamics of the WTO negotiating process requires that developing countries offer 'enough' to OECD countries to induce them to take on the interests that benefit from trade protection'; within developing countries the main thing they have to offer is greater market opening; how 'there is significant scope to harness the traditional WTO reciprocity dynamics to move forward on market access in goods and services; how 'research and capacity-building made a difference in enhancing the knowledge of the issues on the table and informing positions'; how 'Cancun suggests that much more work is needed to integrate development considerations into the trade policy process and to mobilise resources for trade related investments and reforms'; how Cancun raises 'questions regarding the governance and procedures of the WTO'. In terms of the way forward the paper suggests a removal of investment and competition policy from the negotiating table, since this would enable a focus on issues which matter more to developing countries, namely 'removing trade-distorting policies that hurt the poor disproportionately'. However the quid pro quo for this would need to be that governments in the South, particularly middle-income countries, accept the need to lower trade barriers. Comment: The EU maintains that it is committed to implementing agricultural policy changes which reduce trade distortions if not wholly eliminate them (the shift from price support to <b>decoupled</b> direct <b>aid</b> payments). However there are those in the developing world who believe that these policy changes simply improve the efficiency of trade distortions. The levels of both production and trade that are being generated are much higher than would be the case at the prices ruling within the EU {{in the absence of the}} direct aid payments being made from the EU budget. Unless this basic divergence of views is reconciled it is difficult to see how the debate on removing trade-distorting policies in the agricultural sector can be taken forward. In addition the priority accorded to removing trade-distorting policies would appear to be a double-edged sword for ACP countries. For example, removing trade distortions in the sugar sector (through the measures currently being discussed within the EU) will lead to large revenue losses for ACP exporters (equivalent to about € 303 million under one scenario explored in the recent Commission staff working paper), with no guarantee that they will benefit from any consequent improvement in the world market price.

40|$|Vertical {{mixing of}} the nocturnal stable {{boundary}} layer (SBL) over a complex land surface is investigated {{for a range}} of stabilities, using a decoupling index () based on the 2 - 50 m bulk gradient of the ubiquitous natural trace gas radon- 222. The relationship between and the bulk Richardson number () exhibits three broad regions: (1) a well-mixed region () in weakly stable conditions (); (2) a steeply increasing region () for "transitional" stabilities (); and (3) a decoupled region (- 1. 0) in very stable conditions (). exhibits a large variability within individual bins, however, due to a range of competing processes influencing bulk mixing under different conditions. To explore these processes in - space, we perform a bivariate analysis of the bulk thermodynamic gradients, various indicators of external influences, and key turbulence quantities at 10 and 50 m. Strong and consistent patterns are found, and five distinct regions in - space are identified and associated with archetypal stable boundary-layer regimes. Results demonstrate that the introduction of a scalar decoupling index yields valuable information about turbulent mixing in the SBL that cannot be gained directly from a single bulk thermodynamic stability parameter. A significant part of the high variability observed in turbulence statistics during very stable conditions is attributable to changes in the degree of decoupling of the SBL from the residual layer above. When examined in - space, it is seen that very different turbulence regimes can occur for the same value of, depending on the particular combination of values for the bulk temperature gradient and wind shear, together with external factors. Extremely low turbulent variances and fluxes are found at 50 m height when and (fully decoupled). These "quiescent" cases tend to occur when geostrophic forcing is very weak and subsidence is present, but are not associated with the largest bulk temperature gradients. Humidity and net radiation data indicate the presence of low cloud, patchy fog or dew, any of which may <b>aid</b> <b>decoupling</b> in these cases by preventing temperature gradients from increasing sufficiently to favour gravity wave activity. The largest temperature gradients in our dataset are actually associated with smaller values of the decoupling index (), indicating the presence of mixing. Strong evidence is seen from enhanced turbulence levels, fluxes and submeso activity at 50 m, as well as high temperature variances and heat flux intermittencies at 10 m, suggesting this region of the - distribution can be identified as a top-down mixing regime. This may indicate an important role for gravity waves and other wave-like phenomena in providing the energy required for sporadic mixing at this complex terrain site. © 2013, Springer...|$|R
