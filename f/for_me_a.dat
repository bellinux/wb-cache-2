5|$|From {{an early}} age, Reines {{exhibited}} {{an interest in}} science, and liked creating and building things. He later recalled that: The first stirrings of interest in science that I remember occurred during a moment of boredom at religious school, when, looking {{out of the window}} at twilight through a hand curled to simulate a telescope, I noticed something peculiar about the light; it was the phenomenon of diffraction. That began <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> fascination with light.|$|E
5|$|Eastwood's career {{reached a}} turning point in 1971. Before Irving Leonard died, he and Eastwood had {{discussed}} the idea of Malpaso producing Play Misty <b>for</b> <b>Me,</b> <b>a</b> film that was to give Eastwood the artistic control he desired, and his debut as a director. The script was about a jazz disc jockey named Dave (Eastwood), who has a casual affair with Evelyn (Jessica Walter), a listener who had been calling the radio station repeatedly at night, asking him to play her favorite song – Erroll Garner's Misty. When Dave ends their relationship, the unhinged Evelyn becomes a murderous stalker. Filming commenced in Monterey in September 1970 and included footage of that year's Monterey Jazz Festival. The film was highly acclaimed with critics, such as Jay Cocks in Time magazine, Andrew Sarris in the Village Voice, and Archer Winsten in the New York Post all praising the film, as well as Eastwood's directorial skills and performance. Walter was nominated for a Golden Globe Best Actress Award (Drama), for her performance in the film.|$|E

25|$|But for me {{that saying}} of Pittacus doesn’t ring true either (even {{if he was a}} smart man): he says “being good is hard.” <b>For</b> <b>me,</b> <b>a</b> man's good enough as long as he's not lawless, and if he has the common {{sense of right and wrong}} that does a city good—a decent guy.

[...] In an interview, Fagerbakke compared himself to the character and said, [...] "It's extremely gratifying".

When Hausner produced evidence that Eichmann had stated in 1945 that [...] "I will leap into my grave laughing because the feeling that I have five million human beings on my conscience is <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> source of extraordinary satisfaction", Eichmann said he meant [...] "enemies of the Reich" [...] such as the Soviets.

[...] The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr., won with 34.7percent of the 72,000 votes cast. Cuse said the vote [...] "reaffirms <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> feeling I've had– namely that the Nielsens aren't accurately reflecting people's interest in this show", adding that, given Fox's then relatively small share of the market, it was notable that the show got more votes than any of the programs from NBC, CBS, and ABC.|$|E

500|$|Having {{neutralized}} {{opponents of}} the sales tax, Laffoon encouraged legislators to lower the state income and automobile taxes, which he believed would leave no alternative source of revenue except a sales tax. The General Assembly passed the requested cuts, and in July 1934, Laffoon called another special session to consider the sales tax. Pro-administration officials organized parades and demonstrations {{in favor of the}} tax. By contrast, a group of 100 unemployed men marched on Frankfort demanding financial relief. Some of them made death threats against Laffoon, and the Kentucky National Guard surrounded the governor's mansion to protect him. Although anti-sales-tax forces used parliamentary procedures that stalled a vote for weeks, a three percent sales tax was approved {{by the end of the}} session. The tax was derided in a children's chant that said [...] "Hippity-hop to the toy shop to buy a red balloon. A penny for you, a penny <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> <b>a</b> penny for Ruby Laffoon."

[...] Still, in spite of the speculation that Bagwell used performance-enhancing drugs, San Francisco Chronicle sportswriter Bruce Jenkins opined that Bagwell did not have the credentials to be in the Hall of Fame. [...] In July 2015, he acknowledged [...] "that many are suspicious of Bagwell—without proof, as you say. [...] I've always voted for the best players—Bonds, McGwire, Clemens, etc.—so that's not a factor for me. [...] I always found Bagwell just a bit short of Hall of Fame material." ...|$|E

Mylod stated that he did extensive research {{in order to create}} the foot chase, saying [...] "I devoured every foot chase in the history of cinema, but trying to take from that something that would fit into the blueprint of the Game of Thrones visual style, which is not necessarily the same kind of kinetic, handheld feel that you find in many contemporary thrillers. It's a much more classic frame." [...] He continued, [...] "Everything hinged from finding this very lovely, steep stairwell and thinking 'Wouldn't it be great if she leapt off that, and then tumbled down the stairs?' I had this image in my head that I wanted lots of oranges rolling down, not quite sure where that comes from, but it looked pretty." [...] Mylod also stated in a separate interview that it was a conscious decision not to show the final fight between Arya and the Waif, given that it took place in the dark, noting [...] "when the character dies in the dark, unless we switch on night-vision goggles, we're {{not going to be able}} to see that, and we're not going to stick around to hear a scream in the dark anyway. It was actually a conscious choice in the writing and I think, <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> <b>a</b> very elegant storytelling beat as to get that reveal a few seconds later." ...|$|E
