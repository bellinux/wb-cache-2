30|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} applications of a geoid model is a recovery of orthometric <b>heights</b> from <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>heights</b> (normally obtained from GNSS). The application of the geoid model for recovering orthometric <b>heights</b> from <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>heights</b> is normally achieved by fitting the geoid model to a local vertical datum. The fitting procedure is usually accomplished by least squares collocation (LSC), using planar or spherical covariance functions. This procedure warps the gravimetric geoid model onto the local vertical datum, hence the local geoid model derived by this procedure, though convenient for local applications, it is not an equipotential surface. We propose offsets method for practical orthometric height recovery from a geoid model. The proposed procedure is more realistic because it does not constrain the local geoid to be coincident to the local vertical datum. We compare the performance of plannar fitting and offsets methods over Japan using a cross-validation procedure. Results show that offsets method performs better than the normally used planar fitting in the recovery of orthometric <b>heights</b> from <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>heights</b> using a geoid model. The standard deviations of the differences between established and converted orthometric heights at randomly selected GPS/levelling test points over Japan are ± 4 and ± 3  cm for planar fitting and offsets methods, respectively. The offsets method is therefore more appropriate for converting <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>heights</b> to orthometric heights than the planar fitting in the area of study.|$|R

The reduction in accuracy of the transformed height is due to errors in gravimetric quasi/geoid models, but this is compounded yet further in Australia and elsewhere because of the imperfect realisation of local vertical datums. This paper comments upon current, emerging and future issues with height determination on the Australian Height Datum (AHD) using GNSS. This comprises the reference frame used for GNSS <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>heights,</b> theory- and data-driven inaccuracies in modelling the quasi/geoid, and deficiencies in the realisation of the AHD.

In this case corrector surfaces are derived for 25 points co-located with GPS <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>heights,</b> orthometric heights and geoid derived gravimetric heights, which lie throughout Johor, the southern State of Peninsular Malaysia. In order to model and minimise the differences a similarity transformation is utilised for fitting the gravimetric co-geoid undulations with GPS/Levelling data. Before the transformation the comparison between GPS and levelling is a standard deviation of ± 0. 151 m and a mean of 0. 699 m. When tested the internal relative accuracy suggests a standard deviation of ± 0. 072 m and a mean of 0. 003 m, which indicates the bias between the two datum’s has been eliminated.

30|$|It {{should be}} noted that there is no {{vertical}} datum in the world today that is based on a rigorous orthometric height system. This is because of the difficulty in determining rigorous mean gravity along the plumbline between the geoid and a point at the topographical surface. This set-up may work after making a number of assumptions (not necessarily valid), where the local vertical datum is to be maintained and the problem is only how to convert <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>heights</b> into the local vertical datum. However, it cannot be used in a country where there are many local height datums or systems. It is also not applicable for unification of regional height datums. This is the usual technique used in the conversion of <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>heights</b> into orthometric heights. Planar or spherical covariance functions are normally used to fit a gravimetric geoid model onto a local vertical datum. The interpolation of geoid undulations is done using least squares collocation (LSC). Development and applications of LSC techniques in geodesy and related fields have been studied by several authors (e.g. Krarup 1969; Moritz 1973; Tscherning 1976; Kearsley 1977; Moritz 1980; Knudsen 1987; Forsberg 1987; Schaffrin 1989).|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{methodology}} for {{the combination of}} a gravimetric (quasi-) geoid with GNSS-levelling data in the presence of noise with correlations and/or spatially varying noise variances. It comprises two steps: first, a gravimetric (quasi-) geoid is computed using the available gravity data, which, in a second step, is improved using <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>heights</b> at benchmarks provided by GNSS once they have become available. The methodology is an alternative to the integrated processing of all available data using least-squares techniques or least-squares collocation. Unlike the corrector-surface approach, the pursued approach guarantees that the corrections applied to the gravimetric (quasi-) geoid are consistent with the gravity anomaly data set. The methodology is applied to a data set comprising 109 gravimetric quasi-geoid <b>heights,</b> <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>heights</b> and normal heights at benchmarks in Switzerland. Each data set is complemented by a full noise covariance matrix. We show that when neglecting noise correlations and/or spatially varying noise variances, errors up to 10 % of the differences between geometric and gravimetric quasi-geoid heights are introduced. This suggests that if high-quality <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>heights</b> at benchmarks are available and are used to compute an improved (quasi-) geoid, noise covariance matrices referring to the same datum should be used in the data processing whenever they are available. We compare the methodology with the corrector-surface approach using various corrector surface models. We show that the commonly used corrector surfaces fail to model the more complicated spatial patterns of differences between geometric and gravimetric quasi-geoid heights present in the data set. More flexible parametric models such as radial basis function approximations or minimum-curvature harmonic splines perform better. We also compare the proposed method with generalized least-squares collocation, which comprises a deterministic trend model, a random signal component and a random correlated noise component. Trend model parameters and signal covariance function parameters are estimated iteratively from the data using non-linear least-squares techniques. We show that the performance of generalized least-squares collocation is better than the performance of corrector surfaces, but the differences with respect to the proposed method are still significant.
