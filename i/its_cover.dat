That July, he and Universal Music Group were sued by former professional wrestler Billy Two Rivers for using his likeness on <b>its</b> <b>cover</b> and promotional material without his permission. On August 4, Two Rivers' lawyer said the parties had reached a preliminary agreement to settle the matter out of court.|$|E
5|$|Sinclair eschewed {{the sound}} and lyrical content of her debut album Perfectionist (2011) in favour of a heavier atmosphere, driven by strong {{percussion}} and electric guitars. The lyrics, largely co-written by Sinclair and Bhasker, explore the former's problematic childhood and adolescence. Accompanying the album, <b>its</b> <b>cover</b> art was designed by Sinclair and symbolizes the album's main themes. Upon release, music critics commended the album's cohesion, and perceived an evolution in Sinclair' songwriting.|$|E
5|$|The album {{consists}} {{mostly of}} downtempo, instrumental and sample-based chill-out music with musical influences such as Latin soul, R, trip hop and lo-fi music. It also features {{only a few}} vocal contributions from guest artists, which include rapper Lyrics Born and singer Gresham Taylor. <b>Its</b> <b>cover</b> artwork, depicting a taquería that also serves soul food, was designed by artist Stephen Powers.|$|E

5|$|The primary {{instrument}} carried {{aboard the}} station was the BST-1M multispectral telescope, which could carry out astronomical observations in the infrared, ultraviolet and submillimetre spectra using a 1.5metre-diameter mirror which was operated in cryogenic conditions at around 269°C. The telescope could be operated only when Salyut 6 was on the night side of the Earth, and had <b>its</b> <b>cover</b> closed {{for the rest of}} the time.|$|E
5|$|When Rotting {{first came}} out it stirred {{a huge amount of}} {{controversy}} due to <b>its</b> <b>cover</b> art— a traditional grim reaper figure licking what appears to be Jesus Christ's face. It was based upon a medieval painting. The cover artist himself, Kelson Frost, refused to paint a crown of thorns over the man's head, which would readily identify him as the Christian messiah.|$|E

5|$|A three-part comic-book {{adaptation}} with script by Chuck Dixon and Sean Deming {{and illustrated}} by David Wenzel was published by Eclipse Comics in 1989. In 1990 a one-volume edition was released by Unwin Paperbacks. The cover was artwork by the original illustrator David Wenzel.

5|$|Acheson was {{particularly}} worried that allowing {{the details of}} the coup to go public would damage the image of the US. The Rio Pact of 1947 had created the Organization of American States, or OAS, and this body had obtained jurisdiction over regional disputes from the United Nations. In order to achieve this, the US had also committed to a policy of non-intervention {{in the internal affairs of}} other countries. If PBFORTUNE had become public knowledge, the fact that the US was supporting an invasion of a country that was also a member of the OAS would have represented a huge setback to US policy. Thus the State Department promptly ended the operation when they became aware that <b>its</b> <b>cover</b> was blown.|$|E
5|$|After the {{publication}} of issue 6 in August 2012, Vaughan announced that the series would take a two-month hiatus, after which the first six-issue story arc was published in trade paperback form in October for $9.99 before the series' return in November, a practice that Vaughan and Staples would continue after each successive story arc and trade paperback publication. That same month, Vaughan and Staples promoted the series by appearing together at the 2012 New York Comic Con, their first appearance together since the series' debut. Some retailers refused to display the trade paperback because <b>its</b> <b>cover</b> (a reuse of the first issue's cover) depicts Alana breastfeeding Hazel.|$|E

5|$|During her tour to Europe, Eva Perón was {{featured}} in a cover story for Time magazine. The cover's caption–"Eva Perón: Between two worlds, an Argentine rainbow"–was {{a reference to the}} name given to Eva's European tour, The Rainbow Tour. This was the only time in the periodical's history that a South American first lady appeared alone on <b>its</b> <b>cover.</b> (In 1951, Eva appeared again with Juan Perón.) However, the 1947 cover story was also the first publication to mention that Eva had been born out of wedlock. In retaliation, the periodical was banned from Argentina for several months.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, Wizard Video, who {{had also}} {{released}} a video game version of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, released a Halloween game for the Atari 2600. In the game, the player was a babysitter who had to protect her children from Michael Myers, who {{had managed to get}} inside the house. Although the game was called Halloween, and featured the film's theatrical poster as <b>its</b> <b>cover</b> art as well as the movie's main music theme, the game itself never refers to any characters, including the killer, by their names in the film.|$|E

Later albums included artwork by collaborating artists: Ænima and Salival featured works by Cam de Leon; Lateralus and 10,000 Days were created with the help of Alex Grey.

5|$|Prior to 1916, J. Grossman's Sons {{contacted}} American jazz composers Peter DeRose and Ivan Reid {{to write}} a song about Grapico. DeRose, who would later {{be inducted into the}} Songwriters Hall of Fame, produced the piano accompanied song, Meet Me in the Land of Grapico. Meet Me in the Land of Grapico is a sentimental ballad from Tin Pan Alley that imagined a faraway Land of Grapico where love lives forever. The song (see below) and <b>its</b> <b>cover</b> sheet alluded to a grape vine-covered arbor in the Land of Grapico, even though Grapico contained no grape juice. Dedicating the song to all the drinkers of Grapico, J. Grossman's Sons published the song in 1916 and provided it free on request.|$|E

It shows Saadiq dressed in a vintage cornflower blue suit, knicker pants, and lime green argyle socks, while leaning on a white 1967 Mercury Cougar.|$|E
5|$|Spiritual Machines {{has been}} noted as being {{the end of an}} era for Our Lady Peace, as it was the last album {{produced}} by the band's longtime producer Arnold Lanni, the last to feature original guitarist Mike Turner in full, and the last studio album to feature art model Saul Fox on <b>its</b> <b>cover.</b> It was also the last album to feature Maida's high-falsetto singing voice prominently.
