30|$|The {{empirical}} {{demonstration of the}} proposed model enabled to identify predictors that determine intention to <b>use</b> <b>ICT</b> in tourism. Social influence has {{significant impact on the}} study participants’ behavioral intention to <b>use</b> <b>ICT</b> in tourism. As social influence to <b>use</b> <b>ICT</b> in tourism increases, the behavioral intention to use it also increases. There is also strong positive association between perceived usefulness and behavioral intention to <b>use</b> <b>ICT</b> in the tourism. This shows that users are more interested to integrate ICT in their tourism activities when they think that such technologies will be helpful. The finding also showed significant positive relationship between perceived ease of use and behavioral intention to <b>use</b> <b>ICT</b> in tourism. That means tourism organizations are motivated to <b>use</b> <b>ICTs</b> when such technologies are easy to use letting them to have more time for other activities. There was significant association between cost effectiveness and behavioral intention to <b>use</b> <b>ICT</b> in tourism. Cost-effective ICT facilities are more preferable by tourism organizations. Moreover, there is significant relationship between competitive advantage and behavioral intention to <b>use</b> <b>ICT</b> in tourism. This suggests that users’ behavioral intention to <b>use</b> <b>ICT</b> in tourism increases when they believe that the technology will improve their competitive advantages over their counter parts. Besides, the research illustrated significant association between facilitating conditions and behavioral intention to <b>use</b> <b>ICT</b> in tourism. Tourism organizations’ behavioral intention to <b>use</b> <b>ICT</b> increases when facilitating conditions such as users’ experience, resources, and background ICT skill increases.|$|R

40|$|International audienceMicrocystins (MCs), a {{group of}} cyclic heptapeptides {{produced}} by common cyanobacteria (blue green algae), cause both acute and chronic toxicity. Due to their toxicity, constant monitoring in drinking water, recreational waters {{as well as other}} potential exposure through ingestion of contaminated sea food, is very important. In this context, an immunochromatographic test (<b>ICT)</b> <b>using</b> a monoclonal antibody labeled with fluorescent liposomes (immunoliposomes) as tracer was developed, allowing a rapid and simple detection {{of a large number of}} MC and nodularin variants in field samples. The present <b>ICT</b> <b>using</b> immunoliposomes proved to be ten times more sensitive than the <b>ICT</b> <b>using</b> colloidal gold for labeling. To achieve quantitative measurement, this ICT was improved by including a stable signal on the control band allowing the expression of the results as a ratio of the fluorescence signals of the specific band versus the control band (SB/CB). Very low concentrations of MC-LR were detected in the analysis buffer (0. 06 ng/ml), well below the guideline value of 1 ng/ml proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO), with a dynamic range from 0. 06 to 1. 5 ng/ml of MC-LR. This method was also validated using a hand-held commercial fluorometer (from ESE), providing the same performances obtained via the analysis station (from Kodak) used in our laboratory. Repeatability tests performed with both devices showed good accuracy (CV < 13 %). Furthermore, quantification of MCs in natural samples (water bloom and Microcystis culture) was achieved <b>using</b> <b>ICT,</b> leading to similar results obtained via an EIA previously described. All these results demonstrate that this new fluorescent <b>ICT</b> could be <b>used</b> not only as a sensitive detection tool but also to quantify MCs in field samples...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the factors {{influencing}} information and computing technology (ICT) adoption for Omani faculty members from a framework of Rogers' theory of diffusion of innovation. Three hundred Omani faculty members from Sultan Qaboos University (SQU) participated in the study. The survey consisted of five parts: (a) an 18 -item questionnaire on <b>ICT</b> <b>uses</b> and skills, (b) a 1 -item questionnaire on adopter category, (c) a 44 -item self-constructed questionnaire on perception of barriers to adopting ICT, (d) a 50 -item questionnaire on ICT attributes adapted from Moore and Benbasat, and (e) a 15 -item questionnaire on demographic and job-related variables. Descriptive statistics indicated that the faculty members overall <b>used</b> <b>ICT</b> at the "Sometimes" level and had ICT skills at the "Intermediate" level. The most frequently <b>used</b> and skillful <b>ICT</b> functional areas were Website browsing, Internet search engine, and word processing. One-way ANOVAs found significant group differences of <b>ICT</b> <b>uses</b> and skills, perception of barriers, and perception of ICT attributes in the category of adopter. Early adopters <b>used</b> <b>ICT</b> more, had higher ICT skills, perceived fewer barriers in the adopting process, and recognized higher values of ICT attributes than later adopters did. Multiple regression analysis showed the level of <b>ICT</b> <b>uses</b> could be predicted by ICT skills, adopter category, perception of barriers, ICT attributes, and the selected demographic and job-rated background variables, to a large magnitude with an adjusted R 2 value of. 70.

The digital divide in Canada is no longer just a question of those who have access to ICTs and those who don't, but rather bridging gaps pertaining to the second level digital divide is becoming increasingly important as resources including health care access, government documents, and businesses transition to an online space, meaning that digital literacy and technological understanding will be a key factor in the future for ensuring access to such things.|$|E
