5|$|Despite {{these small}} reforms, the 18th century ended with {{continuous}} and unrestrained {{attacks on the}} Court. Although complaints had been common {{since the time of}} Elizabeth I, the problems had become more unrestrained, {{at the same time as}} politically neutral law reformers first arose in any great number. Many critics were barristers of the common law, ignorant of the court's workings, but some, such as Sir Samuel Romilly, had trained as a Chancery advocate and were well aware of the Chancery's procedure. The success of the Code Napoleon and the writings of Jeremy Bentham are seen by academic Duncan Kerly to have <b>had</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the criticism, and the growing wealth of the country and increasing international trade meant it was crucial that there be a functioning court system for matters of equity. While the upper classes had been struggling with the Court for centuries, and regarded it as a necessary evil, the growing middle and merchant classes were more demanding. With increasing court backlogs, it was clear to many law reformers and politicians that serious reform was needed.|$|E

25|$|Shockley {{took the}} lion's {{share of the}} credit in public for the {{invention}} of transistor, {{which led to a}} deterioration of Bardeen's relationship with Shockley. Bell Labs management, however, consistently presented all three inventors as a team. Shockley eventually infuriated and alienated Bardeen and Brattain, and he essentially blocked the two from working on the junction transistor. Bardeen began pursuing a theory for superconductivity and left Bell Labs in 1951. Brattain refused to work with Shockley further and was assigned to another group. Neither Bardeen nor Brattain <b>had</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the development of the transistor beyond the first year after its invention.|$|E
25|$|The Young King's {{contemporary}} reputation, however, was by {{no means}} so negative. This <b>had</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> his place in the enthusiastic tournament culture of his own day. We can see this from his appearances in the History of William Marshal, the biography of the knight assigned to him as a tutor in 1170, and who became his tournament team leader until 1182. The History depicts him as constantly moving from one tournament to another across northern and central France between 1175 and 1182. With his cousins, Philip, Count of Flanders, and Baldwin V, Count of Hainaut, Flanders and Namur, {{he was one of the}} key patrons of the sport. He is said to have spent over £200 a day on the great retinue of knights he brought to the tournament of Lagny-sur-Marne in November 1179.|$|E

25|$|The British Empire forces {{suffered}} 85,197 battle {{casualties in}} Mesopotamia. There were also 820,418 hospitalizations for non-battle causes, mostly sickness. Of those, 16,712 died, 634,889 were treated and {{put back on}} duty in-theater, and 154,343 were permanently evacuated from the theater. Those evacuated accounted for some 18.8% of total non-battle casualties, while those who died were 2%. By comparison, 49% of those wounded in battle (26,814 men) were evacuated, and 8.9% (5,281) died. Thousands more died out of theater from injuries and sickness incurred here, or died in Ottoman captivity. Total British military deaths in the Mesopotamian Campaign, including from the latter causes, were 38,842 (1,434 officers and 37,408 men), including 28,578 from sickness and other non-battle causes (including prisoners). The unusually high ratio of non-battle to battle casualties in Mesopotamia, and the unusually high incidence of permanent losses among non-battle casualties <b>had</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the geography of the area of operations. It was unhygienic, extremely hot in the summer, extremely cold in the winter, composed primarily of either sandy deserts or marshes, and was underdeveloped, meaning men had to be transported large distances for medical attention.|$|E
25|$|Doughty {{also wrote}} {{that the success of}} the German army could not {{adequately}} be explained without reference to French mistakes. French strategy was unusually vulnerable to an attack through the Ardennes; operationally, French commanders failed adequately to react to the breakthrough of massed panzer forces. Tactically, the Germans were often able to overcome French defences that usually were inadequate. French military intelligence failed to predict the main German attack, expecting it in central Belgium as late as 13 May. Military intelligence had made the elementary mistake of noting information that fitted with their assumptions of German intentions and paid insufficient attention to German capability or information suggesting that they were not conforming to expectations. Doughty {{wrote that the}} French failure was caused by an inadequate military system and <b>had</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the success of the German invasion. The French had prepared to fight a methodical battle based on massed firepower, against an opponent that emphasised surprise and speed. French training for a centralised and slow-moving battle left the army incapable of hasty counter-attacks or bold moves. The French army lost the initiative, were overrun at important points and then deep German penetrations made the disruption of French command arrangements worse.|$|E
25|$|The second great {{influence}} on Bracton's thinking was William Raleigh, {{also known as}} William de Raley, a native of Devon. He was a resident in and around Bratton Fleming in 1212, when Bracton was born there. Raleigh was a justice of the bench in 1228. In 1234 he pronounced reversal judgment of Hubert de Burgh, 1st Earl of Kent's outlawry. Though {{he was not a}} justicier, he was regarded as the chief among judges. In 1237 he was appointed treasurer of Exeter Cathedral. He was elected to the See of Winchester in 1238 and passed from legal history. His election to this position was violently opposed by the King who favoured William of Valence. In 1239 Raleigh was elected to the See of Norwich. In 1244 {{he was elected to the}} See of Winchester for a second time. He died in 1250. He <b>had</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the passage of the Statute of Merton. Raleigh defended the refusal of the barons to change the law of bastardy and legitimation. He invented the writ Quare ejecit infra terminum and was influential in the writing of several other novel writs. It is from Bracton that we get the majority of the history of the law at this time. Bracton is thought to have had a notebook with 2000 cases from Pateshull and Raleigh.|$|E

25|$|As the 16th {{century had}} worn on, {{inflation}} in Spain (a result of state debt and, more importantly, {{the importation of}} silver and gold from the New World) triggered hardship for the peasantry. The average cost of goods quintupled in the 16th century in Spain, led by wool and grain. While reasonable {{when compared to the}} 20th century, prices in the 15th century changed very little, and the European economy was shaken by the so-called price revolution. Spain, which along with England was Europe's only producer of wool, initially benefited from the rapid growth. However, like in England, there began in Spain an inclosure movement that stifled the growth of food and depopulated whole villages whose residents were forced to move to cities. The higher inflation, the burden of the Habsburgs' wars and the many customs duties dividing the country and restricting trade with the Americas, stifled the growth of industry that may have provided an alternative source of income in the towns. Another factor was the militaristic nature of the Castilian nobility, which had developed during the centuries of the reconquest of the Iberian peninsula. They preferred careers in the government bureaucracy, the military, or the church, shunning economic activities. This militarism also meant that Spain exhausted its wealth and manpower in near-continuous wars. Under Philip II, these wars <b>had</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> combating Protestantism, but in the 17th century {{it became clear that the}} world that had existed before 1517 could not be restored. Spain's wars during that century became increasingly more to do with preserving the hegemonic power of the Habsburg alliance in Europe; although it should be noted that the Habsburg alliance was successful in buttressing the Catholic Church against the rise of Protestantism.|$|E
500|$|The {{deliberate}} use of [...] "like" [...] {{rather than}} [...] "as" [...] {{was provided by}} advertising agency William Esty Co., and the overall campaign was directed by Esty executives Wendell Adams and Arline Lunny, Lunny serving as producer/director {{of most of the}} visual and recording production related to the campaign in its initial years. Adams was a classically trained musician in his own right, but singer/model/pianist Margaret Johnson ghost wrote the jingle and, along with her husband, Travis Johnson, recorded it with their group, the Song Spinners. Johnson's insertion of the two quick hand claps before the word [...] "cigarette" [...] caught America's ear by surprise and <b>had</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the jingle's success. (A second Winston jingle by Johnson, using the folk tune [...] "Skip to My Lou", has faded into obscurity.) ...|$|E
500|$|Farsari {{and other}} 19th-century {{commercial}} photographers generally concentrated on {{two types of}} subject matter: the scenery of Japan and the [...] "manners and customs" [...] of its inhabitants. Such subjects, {{and the ways in}} which they were literally and figuratively framed, were chosen to appeal to foreign taste; and the reason for this, apart from the photographer's individual aesthetics, vision and preconceptions, <b>had</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> economics. Photographs were expensive to make and accordingly expensive to buy. In 1870s Japan, a portrait photograph usually cost half a ryō [...] "per head", about a month's pay for an artisan. Given such pricing, few Japanese could afford photographs and a photographer's clientele was largely drawn from the foreign residents of the European and American enclaves: colonial administrators, missionaries, merchants and the military. By the early 1870s, tourists had joined their number. To appeal to this clientele, photographers often staged and contrived the scenes they photographed, particularly the portraits depicting [...] "manners and customs".|$|E

500|$|Moore {{wrote of}} the 52nd in his diary that [...] "it is evident that not only the officers, but that each {{individual}} soldier, knows perfectly {{what he has to}} do; the discipline is carried on without severity, the officers are attached to the men and the men to the officers." [...] This <b>had</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the method of training; unlike other regiments, light infantry officers drilled with the men and were expected to be familiar with drill routines, including weapons training. The ranks also received additional training, and were encouraged to develop initiative and self-direction; while skirmishing in the field they would need to react without direct orders. While most regiments of the time fought in tight formation, allowing easy administration of orders, light infantry worked in small groups, in advance of the main line, so complicated bugle calls were developed to pass orders. Consequently, the bugle became the emblem of the light infantry regiments.|$|E
500|$|In October 2013 Lamont faced {{criticism}} for her reaction to an industrial dispute at the Grangemouth Oil Refinery. Ineos, {{the company that}} operates the plant, had stated that the refinery was making financial losses, and had proposed a survival plan requiring employees to accept worse employment terms, notably changes in work rules and less generous pensions; this the employees rejected. The company mothballed the plant, threatening to close it if the terms were not accepted. Lamont urged Ineos to withdraw its conditions and for both sides to hold talks, while Salmond tried to negotiate an agreement. Union officials eventually agreed not to call a strike {{for at least three}} years, and the plant reopened. The Ineos chairman, Calum MacLean, described Lamont's support for the trade unions during the dispute as [...] "deeply irresponsible", while Salmond claimed she had been silent throughout the disagreement. Writing for the Dunfermline Press, Natalie McGarry suggested that while the Labour leader's silence probably <b>had</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the continuing Falkirk selection row, ultimately she was [...] "found wanting".|$|E
500|$|Matters {{came to a}} head in London in May in {{what became}} known as the [...] "Victoria Station incident". Arriving in an open-top Mercedes convertible, Bowie waved to the crowd in a gesture that some alleged was a Nazi salute, which was {{captured}} on camera and published in NME. Bowie said the photographer simply caught him in mid-wave. He later blamed his pro-fascism comments and his behaviour during the period on his addictions and the character of the Thin White Duke. [...] "I was out of my mind, totally crazed. The main thing I was functioning on was mythology... that whole thing about Hitler and Rightism... I'd discovered King Arthur". According to playwright Alan Franks, writing later in The Times, [...] "he was indeed 'deranged'. He had some very bad experiences with hard drugs." [...] Bowie's cocaine addiction, which had caused these controversies, <b>had</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> his time living in Los Angeles, a city which alienated him hugely. Discussing his flirtations with fascism in a 1980 interview with NME, Bowie explained that Los Angeles was [...] "where it had all happened. The fucking place should be wiped off the face of the Earth. To be anything to do with rock and roll and go and live in Los Angeles is, I think, just heading for disaster. It really is." ...|$|E
