40|$|AbstractRice dwarf virus (RDV), {{the causal}} agent of rice dwarf disease, {{is a member}} of the genus Phytoreovirus in the family Reoviridae. RDV is a double-shelled virus with a {{molecular}} mass of approximately 70 million Dalton. This virus is widely prevalent and is one of the viruses that cause the <b>most</b> <b>economic</b> <b>damage</b> in many Asian countries. The atomic structure of RDV was determined at 3. 5 Å resolution by X-ray crystallography. The double-shelled structure consists of two different proteins, the core protein P 3 and the outer shell protein P 8. The atomic structure shows structural and electrostatic complementarities between both homologous (P 3 -P 3 and P 8 -P 8) and heterologous (P 3 -P 8) interactions, as well as overall conformational changes found in P 3 -P 3 dimer caused by the insertion of amino-terminal loop regions of one of the P 3 protein into the other. These interactions suggest how the 900 protein components are built into a higher-ordered virus core structure...|$|R
40|$|Floods {{are natural}} {{disasters}} which cause the <b>most</b> <b>economic</b> <b>damage</b> {{at the global}} level. Therefore, flood monitoring and damage estimation are {{very important for the}} population, authorities and insurance companies. The paper proposes an original solution, based on a hybrid network and complex image processing, to this problem. As first novelty, a multilevel system, with two components, terrestrial and aerial, was proposed and designed by the authors as support for image acquisition from a delimited region. The terrestrial component contains a Ground Control Station, as a coordinator at distance, which communicates via the internet with more Ground Data Terminals, as a fixed nodes network for data acquisition and communication. The aerial component contains mobile nodes—fixed wing type UAVs. In order to evaluate flood damage, two tasks must be accomplished by the network: area coverage and image processing. The second novelty of the paper consists of texture analysis in a deep neural network, taking into account new criteria for feature selection and patch classification. Color and spatial information extracted from chromatic co-occurrence matrix and mass fractal dimension were used as well. Finally, the experimental results in a real mission demonstrate the validity of the proposed methodologies and the performances of the algorithms...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: In {{sustainable}} agriculture, {{biological control}} {{is an important}} alternative to control various plant diseases, in particular, pathogenic fungus that causes the <b>most</b> <b>economic</b> <b>damage</b> to agricultural products in the world. Each soil species bacterium has unique specified features and abilities. Alternaria sp has specific herbal poisons that lead to diseases in them. Biological control of fungal diseases in agricultural products across {{the world has been}} done in recent years using fungi and soil antagonist bacteria. Some bacterial isolates that produce chitinase enzymes fight with fungal pathogens. Materials and Methods: To achieve an antagonist chitinolytic bacteria against Alternaria alternata fungal, screening soil species bacterium that produce chitinase of some urban and agriculture soil samples of Qazvin were carried out. Results: In this study, five different strain of chitinolytic bacteria were found, two strains of Pseudomonas nitroreducens in vitro and one strain (AHH 4), they had the ability to destroying fungal pathogen Alternaria sp in the farm. as the presence of high concentrations (0 / 05 OD 600 and above) of the bacteria, A. alternata fungus growth stopped completely. Discussion and conclusion: However, one of them, P. nitroreducens (AHH 4) could control the fungusat in vitro and invivo and inhibit the growth of fungus. So P. nitroreducens (AHH 4) chitinolytic bacteria has efficiently effect on inhibit A. alternata fungal growth.

40|$|International audienceBackground and Aims: Xiphinema {{index and}} X. diversicaudatum are {{nematodes}} that transmit the {{grapevine fanleaf virus}} and the Arabis mosaic virus, respectively. These viruses are the two agents mainly responsible for the disease that causes the <b>most</b> <b>economic</b> <b>damage</b> to grapevines worldwide. The infectious degeneration of grapevines affects vine performance and grape composition. The control of Xiphinema populations by soil disinfection is now impossible because of the removal from the market of the last available chemical treatments. In this study, saponins are assessed as an alternative treatment to control nematode populations. Methods and Results: The nematicidal effect of saponins from Gypsophila paniculata roots was tested against X. index and X. diversicaudatum. In aqueous media, a concentration of 1 mg/mL {{was associated with a}} mortality of greater than 95 % in both nematodes, while in rearing soil, 73 % of X. index and 85 % of X. diversicaudatum were killed by 150 μg of saponins per gram of soil. In addition, an ecotoxicological study was undertaken on two soil bio-indicators (the mycorrhizal fungus Glomus mosseae and soil nitrification) that revealed that they were not affected by Gy. paniculata saponins at a nematicidal concentration. In the soil, investigation of the major Gy. paniculata root saponins revealed that these molecules were completely degraded in the soil within 4 days. Conclusion: We show that Gy. paniculata saponins are an efficient and environmentally friendly treatment against two nematodes that transmit grapevine fanleaf virus. Significance of the Study: This saponin-based alternative to chemical treatments could provide an environmentally safe and efficient solution for vine growers to use against grapevine fanleaf vector nematodes...|$|R
40|$|Weather {{and climate}} {{extremes}} are of many types and they result in various physical and environmental impacts. The massive flooding and inundation in the Chao Phraya River basin, in Thailand, caused serious damage to various activities for {{a prolonged period}} of time. The consequence of 2011 great flood was a total of 815 deaths and has been recorded as the <b>most</b> <b>economic</b> <b>damage</b> (US$ 45. 7 billion). The present study analyses the skill of the two generations of global climate model ensembles, CMIP 3 and CMIP 5, in projection of precipitation. We firstly examine the flood behavior in 2011 and perform statistical downscaling for 9 GCMs of CMIP 3 and CMIP 5. The observed precipitation data from 83 {{stations around the country}} were interpolated to grid data using various methods. The Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW), after performing cross-validation, is found to give the best statistical performance and is used for GCMs assessment. Both CMIP 3 and CMIP 5 models underestimate the mean precipitation in the southwestern and eastern regions for historical climatology (1980 – 1999). The CMIP 3 and CMIP 5 MME show similar pattern but different magnitudes (CMIP 5 gives higher mean precipitation than CMIP 3). The majority of CMIP 3 and CMIP 5 models overestimate the dry spell and the peak precipitation. The precipitation projection was downscaled by the distribution mapping for the near-future (2010 – 2039), the mid-future (2040 – 2069) and the far-future (2070 – 2099). Both model generations perform reasonably well in capturing the amplitude and phasing of past mean annual precipitation. The correlation coefficient from all models lies between 0. 6 and 0. 9, implying reasonable simulation. The summer monsoon precipitation has an increase trend (from low to high GHG emissions), of 7 – 32 % in October, 6 – 28 % in September, and 8 – 20 % in September for Bhumibol reservoir, Sirikit reservoir, and Nakhon Sawan, respectively. A possibility of increase in hydrological extreme flood in the wet season may be indicated by these findings...|$|R

Considering the wide variability of the pathogen may be assumed spread to other areas which constitutes danger not only for strawberry, but also other economically important fruit crops, vegetables and fruits. The main objective of our study was to verify the cross infection of eleven C. acutatum isolates from different host plants (strawberry, safflower, lupine, pepper and Hypericum perforatum) to selected host plants (strawberry, pepper and safflower). Two varieties {{from each of the}} experimental plant species were selected and virulence of isolates C. acutatum was evaluated. Based on results of statistical evaluation, virulence of C. acutatum isolates was different on strawberry, pepper and safflower. The strawberry variety Pegasus was more susceptible to C. acutatum than the variety Elkas. Isolate 710 from H. perforatum showed the highest virulence for both varieties in terms of index of infection intensity. The pepper variety Pirouet was more susceptible than the variety Cynthia. The highest degree of virulence was found for isolate 29267 from pepper in the variety Cynthia, the highest virulence was proved for isolate 231 from strawberry in the variety Pirouet. No statistical difference was confirmed between susceptibility of the safflower varieties. Isolate 1209 from safflower showed the most important effect on tested plants of safflower.

We found a mixture of consistent and inconsistent patterns across our various datasets. One fairly consistent pattern was the tendency for the ratio of non-economic to <b>economic</b> <b>damages</b> to decline as the amount of <b>economic</b> <b>damages</b> increased. Moreover, the variability of the ratio also tended to decline as the amount of <b>economic</b> <b>damages</b> increased. We found less consistency in our simple regression models where we predicted the log of noneconomic damages from the log of <b>economic</b> <b>damages.</b> In all of those models, the slopes of the fitted line were positive, but the slopes and the measures of fit (r 2) varied from dataset to dataset, and among type of case within those datasets with multiple case types. Also, where we had the same type of case across datasets, we found variation in the fit and slope. With two of the datasets we were able to extend our regression models with regard to medical malpractice cases. Using the RAND jury study from 1995 - 99 we were able to separate out California’s medical malpractice cases which were governed by the MICRA cap on noneconomic damages from the cases coming from five other states included in the study.
