40|$|This {{report is}} an {{extension}} of previous research in references 5, 7, and 8. Its purpose is to develop aerodynamic equations for the longitudinal motion of an aircraft with horizontal tail. These equations include unsteady effects modeled by linear indicial functions. The emphasis is given to obtaining model structure suitable for model identification using experimental data. It means that the postulated model should explain the aerodynamics of wing-tail combination with sufficient accuracy and, at the same time, should be simple enough to provide good conditions for parameter identifiability. The report starts with the formulation of equations for the lift and pitching-moment coefficient and introduction of indicial functions in these equations. Then the development of an indicial function relating the change in the lift of a wing due to downwash is presented. The <b>downwash</b> <b>angle</b> during the harmonic motion of an aircraft is compared with that based on the traditional "lag-in-downwash" factor contained in the acceleration stability derivatives. The variation of the <b>downwash</b> <b>angle</b> with the geometry and frequency of the harmonic motion is also briefly discussed.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present work was to qualitatively and quantitatively model the air wake created by an {{aircraft}} carrier flight deck and superstructure in order to understand how it affects aircraft on approach and landing. The “burble effect ” is the name given by navy pilots to the velocity deficit and downwash field immediately aft of an aircraft carrier. This turbulent region of air has adverse effects on landing aircraft and can cause pilots to bolter, missing the arresting wires and requiring another landing attempt. The experimental approach involved using a five-hole Pitot probe rake system for mapping of the air wake of a 6 ft aircraft carrier model. Wind tunnel tests were performed at Reynolds numbers of 11, 000, 000 and wake maps of 288 point measurements each were generated for configurations with and without the superstructure. The experiment showed that the superstructure created a region of extremely low flow velocity and downward flow angle. While the hull/deck configuration produced velocity deficits as low as 17 %, the presence of the superstructure increased this to almost 30 %. Furthermore, the addition of the superstructure decreased the <b>downwash</b> <b>angle</b> at the deck edge from- 5 to- 8 deg. Under these conditions, an aircraft on approach will experience an increased descent rate as it passes through the burble region. The presence of strong downwash compounds this adverse effect, making it more severe closer to the flight deck. Results also show that the superstructure geometry affects the severity of the burble effect. Nomenclature C = cone pressure calibration constant CL = lift coefficient Cp = pressure coefficien...|$|E
40|$|As the {{aviation}} industry continues {{to strive for}} improvements in fuel efficiency throughout the entire aircraft design, interest has been renewed in propeller engines. New research into advanced turboprop engines, so-called open rotor engines, seems promising as they combine the inherent high propulsive efficiency of ordinary turboprop engines, with the capability of delivering higher thrust. Unfortunately, the implementation of propeller engines does have significant implications on the stability and controllability of an aircraft. These implications are primarily caused by the propeller slipstream, the complex streamtube behind the propeller with strong gradients in various flow quantities both in streamwise and radial direction. The objective of this thesis was to develop, implement, and validate a prediction method for the propeller slipstream effect on the longitudinal stability and control of conventional aircraft configurations in the Initiator. During {{the investigation of the}} propeller slipstream effect, an existing prediction method was found which was based on calculating the four major effects caused by the propeller slipstream on the longitudinal stability and control. These four effects are, an additional normal force at the propeller disk, an increase in lift over the wing due to the slipstream, a change in the tail-off pitching moment, and a change in tail contribution to the pitching moment due to increased downwash and dynamic pressure. This method seemed ideal as it not only gives relatively accurate results, but does so with computationaly inexpensive calculations. During the implementation of this method in the Initiator, additional changes were made to calculate aerodynamic variables which were previously estimated using an extended vortex lattice method program. This implemented prediction method was validated using the only available wind tunnel data for the Fokker 50 and a special Saab 340 with T-tail configuration. Through this validation, the prediction method proved to maintain an acceptable accuracy for all configurations with minimal computation time. Further analysis of the results showed that the propeller slipstream effect reduces the tail effectiveness due to an increase in <b>downwash</b> <b>angle</b> at the tail. This was especially the case for the Fokker 50, which due to its low wing configuration, has a further increase in downwash caused by an inflow effect of the outer flow into the streamtube.

The conventional controls included a high speed aileron, a low speed aileron, and six spoiler segments. The wing was designed so that the last 25 % of the chord is removable to facilitate testing of various control systems. The current status and an indication of the data obtained in these investigations are presented...|$|R
40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{characteristics of}} a full scale executive type jet transport aircraft with a T-tail were investigated in a 40 x 80 ft (12. 2 by 24. 4 meter) wind tunnel (subsonic). Static, longitudinal, and lateral stability, and control characteristics were determined at angles of attack from - 2 deg to + 42 deg. The aircraft wing had 13 deg of sweep and an aspect ratio of 5. 02. The aircraft was tested power off with various wing leading- and trailing-edge high lift devices. The basic configuration was tested with and without such components as engine nacelles, wing tip tanks, and empannage. Hinge-moment data were obtained and <b>downwash</b> <b>angles</b> in the horizontal-tail plane location were calculated. The data were obtained at Reynolds numbers of 4. 1 million and 8. 7 million based on mean aerodynamic chord. The model had static longitudinal stability through initial stall. Severe tail buffet occurred near the angle of attack for maximum lift. Above initial stall the aircraft had pronounced pitch-up, characteristic of T-tail configurations. A stable trim point was possible at angles of attack between 30 deg and 40 deg (depending on c. g. location and flap setting). Hinge-moment data showed no regions with adverse effects on stick force. Comparisons of wind-tunnel data and flight-test are presented...|$|R

In addition, the tail {{is located in the}} flow field of the main wing, and consequently experiences <b>downwash,</b> reducing its <b>angle</b> of attack.|$|R
40|$|Summary. [...] -A {{numerical}} {{method is}} given for calculating the lifting forces on oscillating wings of any plan-form. The principles and techniques of Multhopp's subsonic theory {{have been applied}} to the supersonic problem resulting in a single basic theory which embraces both subsonic and supersonic cases. One {{of the most important}} features of the method is the careful choice of the points at which the lift and downwash distributions are measured. The position of these points in the chordwise direction depend upon whether the local leading and trailing edges are subsonic or supersonic. Extensive use has been made of various interpolation functions which simplify the evaluation of the integrals required for both the downwash and the generalised forces. In the latter case it is shown that the continuous lift distribution can be replaced without loss of accuracy by a set of concentrated lift forces at the lift points. The lift distribution is expressed in terms of these discrete forces since for most purposes they are more convenient to use. It is shown that control surfaces can be dear with by using equivalent continuous deflections and <b>downwash</b> <b>angles</b> to replace the true discontinuous values. Simple expressions are given for these equivalent values, and these expressions are applicable to both subsonic and supersonic cases. 1. Introductiora. [...] The problem of calculating the lift distribution on wings of finite span in both steady and unsteady motion {{has been the subject of}} many investigations. For wings travellin...|$|R
