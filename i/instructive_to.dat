Dickinson observed in a 2006 article that though evidence of morphological and vocal differences between S. przewalskii and S. leucopsis have been delineated, little had yet been published presenting comparative morphological details, {{and that it would}} be <b>instructive</b> <b>to</b> study how each taxon responds to the calls of the other.|$|E

25|$|Within a {{death toll}} {{often viewed as}} ranging between as low as five and as high as seven million, Hilberg's own {{detailed}} breakdown in The Destruction reveals a total estimated death toll of 5.1 million Jews. Only for the death toll at Belzec does Hilberg provide a precise figure, all the others are rounded. When these rounding factors {{are taken into account}} a range of 4.9 million to 5.4 million deaths emerges. It is <b>instructive</b> <b>to</b> note that the discrepancy in total figures among Holocaust researchers is often overshadowed by that between Soviet and Western scholarship. One striking example {{can be seen in the}} Auschwitz State Museum's significant reduction of the estimated death toll in Auschwitz.|$|E
25|$|Earth {{environments that}} cannot support life are still <b>instructive</b> <b>to</b> astrobiologists in {{defining}} the limits of what organisms can endure. The heart of the Atacama desert, generally considered the driest place on Earth, appears unable to support life, {{and it has been}} subject to study by NASA and ESA for that reason: it provides a Mars analog and the moisture gradients along its edges are ideal for studying the boundary between sterility and habitability. The Atacama was the subject of study in 2003 that partly replicated experiments from the Viking landings on Mars in the 1970s; no DNA could be recovered from two soil samples, and incubation experiments were also negative for biosignatures.|$|E
25|$|The formal {{definition}} of distributions exhibits {{them as a}} subspace {{of a very large}} space, namely the topological dual of D(U) (or S(Rd) for tempered distributions). It is not immediately clear from the definition how exotic a distribution might be. To answer this question, it is <b>instructive</b> <b>to</b> see distributions built up from a smaller space, namely the space of continuous functions. Roughly, any distribution is locally a (multiple) derivative of a continuous function. A precise version of this result, given below, holds for distributions of compact support, tempered distributions, and general distributions. Generally speaking, no proper subset of the space of distributions contains all continuous functions and is closed under differentiation. This says that distributions are not particularly exotic objects; they are only as complicated as necessary.|$|E

25|$|The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has {{determined}} that coal tar creosote is probably carcinogenic to humans, based on adequate animal evidence and limited human evidence. It is <b>instructive</b> <b>to</b> note that the animal testing relied upon by IARC involved the continuous application of creosote to the shaved skin of rodents. After weeks of creosote application, the animals developed cancerous skin lesions and in one test, lesions of the lung. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has stated that coal tar creosote is a probable human carcinogen based on both human and animal studies. As a result, the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set a permissible exposure limit of 0.2 milligrams of coal tar creosote per cubic meter of air (0.2mg/m3) in the workplace during an 8-hour day, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires that spills or accidental releases into the environment of one pound (0.454kg) or more of creosote be reported to them.|$|E
25|$|After the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, Congress {{passed the}} Flood Control Act of 1928 which {{authorized}} the Corps of Engineers {{to design and}} construct flood control structures, along with levees, on the Mississippi River to protect populated areas from floods.

It is <b>instructive</b> <b>to</b> note that, in addition, sovereign immunity {{was given to the}} Corps of Engineers under Section 3 of the Flood Control Act of 1928, which states “no liability of any kind would attach or rest upon the United States for any damage from or by floods or flood waters at any place, provided that if on any stretch of the banks of the Mississippi River it was impracticable to construct levees.” 33 U.S.C. § 702c.
