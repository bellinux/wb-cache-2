50|$|Cushion clutch or “slip clutch” {{styles are}} found in both <b>electric</b> <b>screwdrivers</b> and air screwdrivers. This clutch style {{is similar to the}} “cam-over” when once the final torque is reached because the clutch {{continues}} to cam over and slip. It will continue to run until the operator releases the throttle.|$|R
50|$|Torque {{screwdrivers}} {{are available}} with several types of clutch, including “cam-over”, “cushion clutch”, and “auto shutoff”. Most of these clutch types are used in <b>electric</b> <b>screwdrivers,</b> air screwdrivers, impulse screwdrivers, manual torque screwdrivers, and cordless torque screwdrivers. Each type {{has the ability to}} preset a specified torque value. In some cases a tool may need to be certified in a calibration lab to verify its torque output; a certificate may be issued by an organisation such as NIST in the USA.|$|R
50|$|C. & E. Fein GmbH is a {{manufacturer}} of high-end power tools founded in 1867 by Wilhelm Emil Fein and his brother Carl Fein. They are located in Stuttgart, Germany. Fein became famous for their grinders, <b>electric</b> <b>screwdrivers</b> and the Fein Multimaster RS. Fein invented the hand-held electric drill in 1895 and was responsible for many other innovations.|$|R

5000|$|Ultracapacitors—capacitors of {{extremely}} high value— are also used; an <b>electric</b> <b>screwdriver</b> which charges in 90 seconds and will drive {{about half as}} many screws as a device using a rechargeable battery was introduced in 2007, and similar flashlights have been produced. In keeping {{with the concept of}} ultracapacitors, betavoltaic batteries may be utilized as a method of providing a trickle-charge to a secondary battery, greatly extending the life and energy capacity of the battery system being employed; this type of arrangement {{is often referred to as}} a [...] "hybrid betavoltaic power source" [...] by those in the industry.|$|E
50|$|Founded by the American {{inventor}} Albert J. Dremel in 1932, {{the company}} is located in Racine, Wisconsin. Albert J. Dremel held 55 patents across {{a wide range of}} inventions, including the electric eraser, electric fish scaler, electric shoe polisher, <b>electric</b> <b>screwdriver,</b> power sanders, scroll saws, a device to keep tabs on chicken's egg production and first design of the now standard walk behind rotary lawn mower. His first product released within the company was with an electric razor blade sharpener. This success was soon brought to a halt after popularity of cheap, disposable razors came into effect. This then forced Albert J. Dremel to come up with his next invention, seen as the most important of his career - the high speed rotary tool, later named the Dremel Multitool. Compact, lightweight and versatile, this invention was successful in the hobby and craft market.|$|E
50|$|A {{torque tester}} {{is used as}} a quality control device to test or {{calibrate}} torque controlled tools. This includes electronic torque wrenches, click torque wrenches, dial torque wrenches, <b>electric</b> <b>screwdrivers,</b> air screwdrivers, pulse tools, cordless screwdrivers, nutrunners, and torque screwdrivers. Today’s advanced torque testers include the ability to measure in clockwise and counter-clockwise directions, convert to 8 engineering units (in·oz, in·lb, ft·lb, N·m, cN·m, kgf·cm, gf·cm, kgf·fm), 3 modes of operation (peak, 1st peak, track), and include a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) certificate (or its domestic pendant).|$|R
50|$|A rundown fixture, {{also known}} as a joint simulator, is used during the {{calibration}} process to help test power tools (<b>electric</b> <b>screwdrivers,</b> air screwdrivers, pulse tools, cordless screwdrivers, nutrunners, etc.). A joint simulator is placed on top of the transducers. An adapter bit is inserted into the power tool and is mated to top of the joint simulator. By using springs of different stiffness or stacking Belleville washers in set patterns, the joint simulator can replicate soft, medium, or hard joints. This is important when trying to repeat how a tool may be used on an actual process.|$|R
50|$|Corded <b>electric</b> torque <b>screwdrivers</b> are {{commonly}} made {{in three different}} designs: pistol grip, angle and inline. This type is the one mostly used for industrial assembly applications such as electronic assembly and small parts assembly. Brushed electric motors and more efficient brushless motors are used. The torque ranges typically from 0.18 in lb (0.02Nm) to at least 27Nm, with speeds of up to 2000 RPM.|$|R
5000|$|Psycho Paul Nevin (Ryan Pope): {{originally}} a rival dealer to Moz, Psycho Paul now works with Cartoon Head. He appears in series {{one as a}} more violent and successful dealer. Shortly after PC busts Psycho Paul and gives all his weed to Moz, Psycho Paul finds Moz and threatens him with a Phillips screwdriver until the weed is returned. Throughout the show, Psycho Paul bullies Moz (or [...] "Morris", as he calls him), often slapping him and pressuring him into helping him out with his plots. Paul gives up dealing {{in order to move}} into the shadier and more lucrative worlds of kidnapping, pornography and other gangster activities. Moz doesnt want to get involved in his plans but finds it difficult to refuse Psycho Paul without causing offence and thus risking repercussions. In series five he becomes the leader of a rival gang with Steve and Xavier to the triad and they move into human trafficking, this leads to them helping Nikoli into the country with his helper, believing them to be young Russian girls who they can put to work for them when they turn Steves flat into a brothel. Psycho Paul also always carries his trademark Phillips screwdriver until later into the show when he upgrades to an <b>electric</b> <b>screwdriver.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Penetrating {{brain injury}} (PBI) {{can be caused}} by several objects ranging from knives to chopsticks. However, an assault with long and <b>electric</b> <b>screwdriver</b> is a {{peculiar}} accident and is relatively rare. Because of its rarity, the treatments of such injury are complex and nonstandardized. Case presentation We presented a case of a 54 -year-old female who was stabbed with a screwdriver in her head and accompanied by loss of consciousness for 10 h. Computer tomography (CT) demonstrated that the screwdriver passed through the right zygomatic bone to posterior cranial fossa. Early foreign body removal and hematoma evacuation were performed and the patient had a good postoperative recovery. Conclusions In this study, we discussed the clinical presentation and successful management of such a unique injury caused by a screwdriver. Our goal is to demonstrate certain general management principles which can improve patient outcomes...|$|E

40|$|Aren’t you {{tired of}} never finding stuff? Take a bits as example, do you store these lose in your toolbox or {{carpenter}} belt? What {{if you could}} have it all accessible and assembled in a tool, always at arm’s reach? Today bits are used together with <b>electric</b> <b>screwdrivers</b> and handheld screwdrivers in a greater spread. For these different types of storage, from pure storage boxes to complex tools with storage built in, exist. The professional craftsmen commonly use some kind of box where the bits can be stored. Even so they tend to store their bits loose in a carpenter belt or toolbox, since they want the speed and accessibility of carpenter belt over the storage box’s tidiness. The project was started in the fall of 2010 and a referents group was early put together to ensure that the developed product became as user-friendly and attractive as possible. The referents group contained our target group, professional craftsmen and other competent persons within the field. In cooperation with the referents group a needs and wants list was put together {{to make sure that the}} product satisfice the need. The lack of a good storage solution has led to a unique product which suit for both usage and storage of bits. Through combining the carpenter belt and the storage box speed, accessibility and tidiness is obtained. A solution suggestion with a prototype was created which satisfied the set needs and wants. The solution was presented for the referents group and the response was good but improvements suggestions were given. These were taken and work began on a new version. The result became a new product, qbits, the unique tool which combine usage and storage of bits...|$|R
40|$|Robotic {{operation}} {{is one of}} the major challenges in the remote maintenance of ITER vacuum vessel (VV) and future fusion reactors as inner operations of Tokamak have to be done by robots due to the internal adverse conditions. This paper introduces a novel remote handling robot (RHR) for the maintenance of ITER-like D-shaped vessel. The modular designed RHR, which is an important part of the remote handling system for ITER, consists of three parts: an omnidirectional transfer vehicle (OTV), a planar articulated arm (PAA), and an articulated teleoperated manipulator (ATM). The task of RHR is to carry processing tools, such as the viewing system, leakage detector, and <b>electric</b> <b>screwdriver,</b> to inspect and maintain the components installed inside the D-shaped vessel. The kinematics of the OTV, as well as the kinematic analyses of the PAA and ATM, is studied in this paper. Because of its special length and heavy payload, the dynamics of the PAA is also investigated through a dynamic simulation system based on robot technology middleware (RTM). The results of the path planning, workspace simulations, and dynamic simulation indicate that the RHR has good mobility together with satisfying kinematic and dynamic performances and can well accomplish its maintenance tasks in the ITER-like D-shaped vessel...|$|E
