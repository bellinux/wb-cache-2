Kino's edition of the film was mastered in high definition from the 35mm negative with the Italian language dub and original soundtrack. Arrow Films released Black Sabbath on DVD and Blu-ray in 2013. Arrow's transfer of the Italian version was from an original 35mm <b>internegative</b> print transferred in Italy that had additional grading and restoration done in London. Arrow's version of the American version of Black Sabbath was made from an 35mm interpositive in California. Arrow noted the high definition master they received from Italy {{was very difficult to}} restore as the master had issues with the image, sound and color quality and had the stories in the wrong order.|$|E
25|$|Later color {{films were}} {{standardized}} into two distinct processes: Eastman Color Negative 2 chemistry (camera negative stocks, duplicating interpositive and <b>internegative</b> stocks) and Eastman Color Positive 2 chemistry (positive prints for direct projection), usually abbreviated as ECN-2 and ECP-2. Fuji's products {{are compatible with}} ECN-2 and ECP-2.|$|E
25|$|In 1967, Life {{magazine}} hired a New Jersey film lab, Manhattan Effects, {{to make a}} 16 mm film copy of {{the original}} Zapruder film. Pleased with the results, they asked for a 35 mm <b>internegative</b> to be made. Mo Weitzman made several internegatives in 1968, giving the best to Life and retaining the test copies. Weitzman set up his own optical house and motion picture postproduction facility later that year. Employee and assassination buff Robert Groden, hired in 1969, used one of Weitzman's copies and an optical printer to make versions of the Zapruder film using close-ups and minimizing the camera's shakiness.|$|E
5000|$|Conventional release prints, {{which are}} made from timed <b>internegatives,</b> usually contain black motor and {{changeover}} cue marks as the printing <b>internegatives</b> are [...] "punched" [...] and [...] "inked" [...] for this specific purpose. Showprints, being made from the composited camera negatives, which are never [...] "punched" [...] or [...] "inked", have white motor and changeover cue marks as these marks are punched (or scribed) directly on the prints by hand, in the lab.|$|R
50|$|Printing release {{prints from}} the composited camera {{negative}} was common until about 1969. Thereafter, most printing was done from <b>internegatives</b> which {{were made from}} an interpositive.|$|R

2500|$|Star Wars {{required}} extensive {{recovery of}} misplaced footage and {{restoration of the}} whole, before Lucas's Special Edition modifications could be attempted. It was discovered {{that in addition to}} the negative motion picture stocks commonly used on feature films, Lucas had also used <b>internegative</b> film, a reversal stock which deteriorated faster than negative stocks did. This meant that the entire printing negative had to be disassembled, and the CRI (color reversal <b>internegative)</b> portions cleaned separately from the negative portions. Once the cleaning was complete, the film was scanned into the computer for restoration. In many cases, entire scenes had to be reconstructed from their individual elements. Digital compositing technology allowed them to correct for problems such as alignment of mattes, [...] "blue-spill", and so forth.|$|E
50|$|When an <b>internegative</b> wears {{out during}} printing, a new <b>internegative</b> {{is made from}} the {{interpositive}} and release printing resumes. There are some films (reversal film) that can go from positive to positive or negative to negative but are not used very often.|$|E

50|$|This {{was one of}} {{the very}} few {{instances}} where a Western Bloc recommendation and standard was adopted by the Eastern Bloc, but was wholly rejected by the very bloc which proposed its adoption.

5000|$|Bleach bypass {{can be done}} to any {{photochemical}} step in the process, be it original camera negative, interpositive, <b>internegative,</b> or release print. For motion pictures, it {{is usually}} applied at the <b>internegative</b> stage, as insurance companies usually are reluctant to have the camera negative bleach bypassed, or the interpositive (a [...] "protection"/"preservation" [...] element), in the event that the look is agreed to be too extreme, and the cost of the process for each individual release print is most often cost-prohibitive. The effect, however, will render slightly differently at each stage, especially between the camera negative and interpositive stages.|$|E
5000|$|Prints {{are still}} being made from the composited camera negative. Usually such a print run {{is limited to a}} few prints. These are {{variously}} called [...] "EKs" [...] (derived from the name Eastman Kodak) or [...] "showprints", and are generally reserved for the producer and for exhibition in first-run engagements in Los Angeles and New York. Other exhibitors will almost always receive conventional prints made from <b>internegatives.</b>|$|R
50|$|The contact {{exposure}} process usually {{refers to}} a film negative {{used in conjunction with}} printing paper, but the process may be used with any transparent or translucent original image printed by contact onto a light sensitive material. Negatives or positives on film or even paper may for various purposes be used to make contact exposures onto different films and papers. Intermediary products such as <b>internegatives,</b> interpositives, enlarged negatives, and contrast controlling masks are often made using contact exposures.|$|R
50|$|While the {{animated}} cartoons of Betty Boop have enjoyed a remarkable rediscovery {{over the last}} 30 years, official home video releases have been limited to the VHS and LaserDisc collector's sets in the 1990s. There were no such releases for the Betty Boop cartoons on DVD and Blu-ray, up until 2013 when Olive Films finally released the non-public domain cartoons, although they were restored from the original television <b>internegatives</b> that carried the altered opening and closing credits. Volume 1 was released on August 20, 2013, and Volume 2 on September 24, 2013.|$|R
5000|$|Scratches or {{dirt on the}} IP {{appear as}} black defects on the transfer, which are {{generally}} less objectionable than white defects, {{which would be the}} case if the camera negative or <b>internegative</b> were used.|$|E
50|$|An <b>internegative</b> is {{a motion}} picture film duplicate. It {{is the color}} {{counterpart}} to an interpositive, in which a low-contrast color image is used as the positive between an original camera negative and a duplicate negative.|$|E

These images are largely in transparent format {{and are available}} for research by appointment only.|$|R
50|$|Negative cutting (also {{known as}} {{negative}} matching and negative conforming) {{is the process}} of cutting motion picture negative to match precisely the final edit as specified by the film editor. Original camera negative (OCN) is cut with scissors and joined using a film splicer and film cement. Negative cutting is part of the post-production process and occurs after editing and prior to striking <b>internegatives</b> and release prints. The process of negative cutting has changed little since the beginning of cinema in the early 20th century. In the early 1980s computer software was first used to aid the cutting process. Kodak introduced barcode on motion picture negative in the mid-1990s. This enabled negative cutters to more easily track shots and identify film sections based on keykode.|$|R
50|$|Superman {{cartoons}} by Warner Home Video (as part {{of separate}} VHS and LaserDisc collections of episodes from The Adventures of Superman TV {{series of the}} 1950s), it would take longer for any official DVD releases of the Fleischer cartoons due to Republic's ownership and video license changes, the potential film and/or digital restoration costs, and the financial viability {{as the result of}} releasing restored versions. However, as of March 2012, Olive Films, under exclusive license from Melange/Viacom acquired the rights to the 66 non-public domain Betty Boop cartoons and is currently restoring them for a DVD and Blu-ray release using the original television <b>internegatives</b> (with the altered credits, as no original uncut elements were available). The first two volumes of the Melange-copyrighted Boop cartoons are currently available.|$|R
50|$|After its 1947 {{screening}} {{the film}} went missing. In 2001, a reconstructed {{version of the}} film was restored from a partial nitrate <b>Internegative.</b> The reconstruction was screened at the XXXI Mostra Internazionale del Cinema Libero in Bologna in 2002.|$|E
50|$|For {{quality and}} safety reasons, video {{transfers}} {{are almost always}} made from an interpositive. An <b>internegative</b> is a less desirable alternate. On rare occasions, the composited camera negative {{may be used for}} video transfers, but {{it will have to be}} carefully retimed for color.|$|E
5000|$|Star Wars {{required}} extensive {{recovery of}} misplaced footage and {{restoration of the}} whole, before Lucas's Special Edition modifications could be attempted. It was discovered {{that in addition to}} the negative motion picture stocks commonly used on feature films, Lucas had also used <b>internegative</b> film, a reversal stock which deteriorated faster than negative stocks did.

50|$|The edited {{original}} negative is then copied {{to create}} a safety positive {{which can be used}} as a backup {{to create a}} usable negative. At this point, an answer print will be created from the OCN, and upon its approval, interpositives (IPs) and <b>internegatives</b> (INs) are created, from which the release prints are made. Generally speaking, the OCN is considered too important and delicate to be used for any processes more than necessary, as each pass through a lab process carries the risk of further degrading the quality of the negative by scratching the emulsion. Once an answer print is approved, the IPs and INs are regarded as the earliest generation of the finished and graded film, and are almost always used for transfers to video or new film restorations. The OCN is usually regarded as a last resort in the event that all of the intermediate elements have been compromised or lost. Ironically, the more popular a film is, the higher the likelihood that the original negative is in a worse shape, due to the need to return to the OCN to strike new IPs to replace the exhausted ones, and thus create more INs and release prints. Before 1969, 35mm prints were struck directly from the original negative, often running into hundreds of copies, and causing further wear on the original.|$|R
5000|$|Although Eastman Kodak {{had first}} {{introduced}} acetate-based film, {{it was far}} too brittle and prone to shrinkage, so the dangerously flammable nitrate-based cellulose films were generally used for motion picture camera and print films. In 1949 Kodak began replacing all nitrocellulose (nitrate-based) films with the safer, more robust cellulose triacetate-based [...] "Safety" [...] films. In 1950 the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences awarded Kodak with a Scientific and Technical Academy Award (Oscar) for the safer triacetate stock. By 1952, all camera and projector films were triacetate-based. Most if not all film prints today are made from synthetic polyester safety base (which started replacing Triacetate film for prints in the early 1990s). The downside of polyester film {{is that it is}} extremely strong, and, in case of a fault, will stretch and not break-potentially causing damage to the projector and ruining a fairly large stretch of film: 2-3 ft or ~2 seconds. Also, polyester film will melt if exposed to the projector lamp for too long. Original camera negative is still made on a triacetate base, and some intermediate films (certainly including <b>internegatives</b> or [...] "dupe" [...] negatives, but not necessarily including interpositives or [...] "master" [...] positives) are also made on a triacetate base as such films must be spliced during the [...] "negative assembly" [...] process, and the extant negative assembly process is solvent-based. Polyester films are not compatible with solvent-based assembly processes.|$|R
50|$|After {{the late}} 1950s, 16 mm Kodachrome Commercial-originated films (and Ektachrome Commercial-originated films as well) were quite often {{duplicated}} onto Eastmancolor <b>internegative</b> film, after which these films were printed on Eastmancolor positive print film, as a cost-reduction measure, thereby yielding relatively low-cost prints for direct projection.|$|E
50|$|Later color {{films were}} {{standardized}} into two distinct processes: Eastman Color Negative 2 chemistry (camera negative stocks, duplicating interpositive and <b>internegative</b> stocks) and Eastman Color Positive 2 chemistry (positive prints for direct projection), usually abbreviated as ECN-2 and ECP-2. Fuji's products {{are compatible with}} ECN-2 and ECP-2.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{sometimes}} referred to as a Protection IP, which is a good term since the only time the IP is touched is on the occasion of making the first or a replacement <b>internegative.</b> Since interpositives are used so rarely, they are usually the film element that is in the best condition of all the film elements.|$|E
5000|$|Black-and-white {{transparencies}} {{were once}} popular for presentation of lecture materials using 3" [...] by 4" [...] (3" [...] {{square in the}} UK) glass-mounted slides. Such positive black-and-white projection is now rarely done, except in motion pictures. Even where black-and-white positives are currently used, the process to create them typically uses an <b>internegative</b> with standard processing instead of a chemical reversal process.|$|E
5000|$|The NFB {{considers}} Air Cadets a lost film. In 1967, {{the warehouse}} that stored {{many of the}} NFB films was destroyed by a fire, and as a result, most of the films were lost. What remains of Air Cadets , at present, is a 20-minute <b>internegative</b> copy consisting of individual film scenes that were shot by director Jane Marsh Beveridge and her cinematographers.|$|E
50|$|In Hollywood, O Brother, Where Art Thou? was {{the first}} film to be wholly {{digitally}} graded. The negative was scanned with a Spirit DataCine at 2K resolution, then colors were digitally fine-tuned using a Pandora MegaDef color corrector on a Virtual DataCine. The process took several weeks, and the resulting digital master was output to film again with a Kodak laser recorder to create a master <b>internegative.</b>|$|E
50|$|Since some theaters {{currently}} don't have digital projection systems, {{even if a}} {{movie is}} shot and post-produced digitally, it must be transferred to film if a large theatrical release is planned. Typically, a film recorder {{will be used to}} print digital image data to film, to create a 35 mm <b>internegative.</b> After that the duplication process is identical to that of a traditional negative from a film camera.|$|E
