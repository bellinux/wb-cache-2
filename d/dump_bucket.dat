50|$|The {{structure}} {{as it exists}} today was completed in 1897 {{with the addition of}} two wings including the two turrets that currently distinguish it. Originally, the dorm did not have its now iconic front porch. In its early years, Sorin housed Notre Dame's law school and the dean of the law department, Prof. William Hoynes, resided in the building. He once happened to be the target of one of the numerous student pranks in the early 1900s who <b>dumped</b> <b>buckets</b> of water on people leaving the building. After the instance, he raised a fuss with university administration, hence a porch was built in April 1905 to avoid any such further instance. Since then, the porch thus became one of the iconic features of the dorm.|$|R

50|$|Rope Burn: A rope is {{attached}} from a fire pit to a platform suspended 15 feet above water. Below the platform are fire-building materials {{resting on a}} pair of docks, including oil, batteries, matches, logs and bales of hay. Six players from each team have to swim from the shore to the docks, and retrieve the fire-building materials over their heads without getting them wet, while the remaining three players from each team will try to sabotage their opponents by <b>dumping</b> <b>buckets</b> of water from the top of their platforms. The goal is for the players swimming from the shore {{to the middle of the}} platform to burn the ropes attached to their opponent's platform with the fire-building materials, which will drop their opponents into the water. The first team to drop their opponents into the lake wins.|$|R

5000|$|The second contribution, , {{describes}} convection (or advection). Imagine {{standing on}} the bank of a river, measuring the water's salinity (amount of salt) each second.

Thus, the concentration at a given location can change because of the flow.|$|R
5000|$|Thompson's Oz books show {{a certain}} {{intolerance}} in Dorothy. In The Cowardly Lion of Oz, circus clown Notta Bit More {{arrives in the}} Emerald City [...] "disguised" [...] as a traditional witch, and Dorothy immediately starts <b>dumping</b> <b>buckets</b> water on him without provocation (although she reacted this way {{on the assumption that}} the [...] "witch" [...] Notta was an evil witch like her old enemy, the Wicked Witch of the West). In The Wishing Horse of Oz, she makes unsavory comments about the dark coloration Gloma and her subjects take on as a disguise, making them somewhat resemble black people. This behavior is not characteristic of Dorothy in Baum's Oz books. In The Patchwork Girl of Oz, she pushes and slaps through crowds of black Tottenhots to rescue the Scarecrow, whom they are tossing around, but this is more an example of her gumption than any sort of prejudice, as she is otherwise kind and polite to the Tottenhots, and accepts that their ways are different from those who dwell in the Emerald City.|$|R

When {{the trio}} {{go to their}} uncle Donald Duck's house, Donald decides to prank the boys (giving them a [...] "trick" [...] instead of a treat).

After Donald bids farewell to the boys, the discouraged nephews go {{and sit on the}} curb.|$|R
50|$|Suddenly, Billy and Chris {{appear and}} <b>dump</b> a <b>bucket</b> of pig blood on Carrie. Humiliated and incensed, Carrie realizes her full powers. She closes off the gym exit and kills {{everyone}} present ("The Destruction"). Carrie leaves the prom and is met by her mother. Margaret comforts her daughter ("Carrie (2nd Reprise)") and then stabs her fatally, thinking it will save Carrie's soul. Carrie retaliates, killing Margaret with her powers, and she apologizes {{as her mother}} dies. Sue, the only student who {{was not at the}} prom, discovers Carrie and comforts her as she dies.|$|R
50|$|Niagara Conservation also {{manufactures}} the Flapperless toilet, {{which uses}} a half-cylinder 1.6 gallon bucket instead of a flapper.

5|$|Although Jerry Lawler and Doink the Clown had a storyline rivalry that dated {{back to when}} Doink {{turned on}} Lawler by <b>dumping</b> a <b>bucket</b> of water on him after SummerSlam 1993, the feud had rarely been {{mentioned}} since then. On the September 10, 1994 episode of WWF Superstars of Wrestling, however, Lawler provoked Doink by popping balloons carried by Doink's midget sidekick Dink. The rivalry soon led to Lawler introducing a midget named Queasy, who dressed like Lawler. Doink and Lawler then introduced many more midgets over the following weeks. An elimination match was booked for Survivor Series, with Lawler, Queasy, Sleazy and Cheesy facing Doink, Dink, Wink and Pink.|$|R

5000|$|In chapter 12, {{he states}} that [...] "quickly putting or dumping wastes outside is not {{hazardous}} once fallout is no longer being deposited. For example, assume the shelter is {{in an area of}} heavy fallout and the dose rate outside is 400 roentgen (R) per hour, enough to give a potentially fatal dose in about an hour to a person exposed in the open. If a person needs to be exposed for only 10 seconds to <b>dump</b> a <b>bucket,</b> in this 1/360 of an hour he will receive a dose of only about 1 R.

40|$|If Dodgson owns a {{swimming}} pool and Duckworth <b>dumps</b> a five-gallon <b>bucket</b> of ammonia into Dodgson’s swimming pool, many would rightly charge Duckworth with polluting Dodgson’s pool. Depending on {{the facts of the}} case, many would further charge that, in polluting Dodgson’s pool, Duckworth has wronged Dodgson. That is, Duckworth’s pollution of Dodgson’s pool is wrong. This sentiment stems, presumably, from the simple fact that ammonia is damaging to pools and pool water, and that by <b>dumping</b> the <b>bucket</b> of ammonia in the pool, Duckworth has thereby injured Dodgson. The degree of wrongness of Duckworth’s action may well be mitigated by external factors, of course. Duckworth’s pollution of Dodgson’s pool may be a case of malicious vandalism, or it easily may have been an accident. Depending on the facts, Dodgson may have more reason to forgive Duckworth in one case than in another. This much seems clear enough. It is also possible that Dodgson may have asked Duckworth to put the ammonia in the water, perhaps if Dodgson were a pool manager and Duckworth his assistant, or if Dodgson were filming a movie and Duckworth were in place to create a toxic fog {{on the surface of the}} pool. So it is not clear, from the mere fact that Duckworth has dumped ammonia in Dodgson’s pool, thereby polluting the pool wit...|$|R
