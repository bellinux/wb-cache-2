Even though lacking a museum building suitable for housing the exhibition and allowing to keep the collection visible to the public, the Caproni Museum remained an important institution in the field of preserving aviation-related historical heritage. The museum continued to participate in aviation events and in acquiring or being gifted new items for the collection. Between the 1940s and the 1950s, the museum's operations were furthered due to the work of the co-founder, Timina Caproni.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Much of the {{information}} used by an organization is collected {{in the form of}} manuals, regulations, news etc. These are grouped into controlled <b>documentary</b> <b>collections,</b> which are normally digitized and accessible via a content management system. However, obtaining new knowledge from collected documents in an organization requires not only sound search and retrieval of information tools, but also the techniques to establish relationships, discover patterns and provide overall descriptions of the entire contents of the collection. This article explores the nature of knowledge and the role that occupy the <b>documentary</b> <b>collections</b> as a source of obtaining him knowledge. It also describes the collection of documents will be used along the exposure of this study and the techniques of processing information in order to obtain the desired results. This paper describes the use of computational methods, support vector machines in particular, in a large organisation for document classification...|$|R

30|$|This book {{could not}} miss some essays {{dedicated}} to the subject that, perhaps, {{more than any other}} has permeated Corsini’s activity: abandoned childhood. Two papers, respectively, of 1991 and 1998, well represent the mastery with which he has always treated the various facets of this topic. The papers are based mainly on the <b>documentary</b> <b>collections</b> of the Spedale degli Innocenti (the hospital for abandoned children), but as always, in Corsini, the information is crossed with other <b>documentary</b> <b>collections,</b> in order to observe the phenomenon in its more general context. In a third paper on the subject, Materiali per lo studio della famiglia in Toscana (Materials {{for the study of the}} family in Tuscany, 1976), he addresses the issue from the perspective of abandoned children who are also legitimate children. The paper, from a methodological point of view, anticipates those researches which, relying on large datasets, link many information from different sources collected at an individual level.|$|R
