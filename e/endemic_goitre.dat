40|$|Background: Iodine {{deficiency}} disorders (IDD) are endemic in {{the mountain}} regions of Armenia. Universal salt iodisation has been chosen as the control measure. Objectives: (1) To measure the prevalence of iodine deficiency in the Armenian population; (2) to evaluate household use of iodised salt; and (3) to monitor iodised salt promotion strategies. Design: Cross-sectional study on a nationally representative sample of 2627 households, including 3390 children under five and 2649 women of fertile age. Cluster sampling design on four population strata: residents, refugees, rural and urban. Results: Thyroid was palpable in one-third of the women, 6 % of them having a visible goitre. Median of urinary iodine excretion in children was 139. 5 mg l 21. One-third of the children showed low urinary iodine concentration. Iodised salt was consumed in 66 % of the households.

Materials and Methods: This study is a retrospective analysis of records of all patients presenting with thyroid swelling in a tertiary care hospital at Gangtok, Sikkim {{during the period of}} 4 years between 1 st January 2008 and 31 st December 2011. Patients were diagnosed by clinical examination, FNAC, USG, CT scan and hormone estimation. Histopatholgical confirmation was done in surgical cases. Clinic opathological and demographic data of 166 such patients were obtained and analyzed for the present study. Results: The most common goitrous disease was simple goitre (69. 27 %) followed by thyroiditis (10. 24 %), toxic goitre (7. 83 %) and malignancy (12. 65 %). Papillary variant was the commonest carcinoma. Overall female:male ratio was 4. 9 : 1. The prevalence goitrous lesion was highest in the middle age group between 30 - 39 years, while the extremes of age (below 10 years and above 70 years) were rarely involved.

40|$|PRESENTATION OF CASE Retrosternal goitre {{grows in}} a tight {{compartment}} between the sternum anteriorly and vertebra posteriorly and are symptomatic due to compression of airway and great vessels. The presence of RSG is, per se, an indication for surgical management. Surgery can most commonly be performed using the cervical access, but at times, a sternotomy or thoracotomy is necessary. The challenges encountered by the anaesthetist and the surgeon are- difficulty in intubation/ventilation due to compression of airways, hypervascularity and {{the proximity of the}} goitre to great vessels. We report a case of a large RSG in a middle-aged obese female who was on CPAP treatment from a physician for the symptoms of obstructive sleep apnoea for 2 years, but with no relief. There was no visible or palpable neck swelling. CECT neck and chest was done in view of worsening of symptoms, which showed heterogenous enhancing mass in superior mediastinum up to carina likely lymph node mass or exophyti thyroid mass after, which she was referred to Surgery Department. Ultrasound findings also suggested colloid goitre of both the lobes and swelling of isthmus, which was continuous with the retrosternal mass. FNAC proved it to be colloid goitre with cystic degeneration. She was euthyroid as per laboratory parameters. Patient was operated by transcervical approach and near total thyroidectomy was performed. Patient was discharged in satisfactory condition.

Eleven of 18 iodine deficiency goitres contained clusters of dendritic cells. These clusters appeared to express only HLA-DR in two cases; in nine of 12 cases they showed a differential expression of class II molecules in the following frequency: HLA-DR>DQ and/or -DP>RFD 1. These dendritic cells also were ICAM- 1 +. In four of 18 iodine deficiency goitres, thyroid epithelial cells showed MHC class II expression in several combinations, but were ICAM- 1 -. In normal thyroids and in nodular goitres from inhabitants of the endemic area not having an actual iodine deficiency, only sparse clusters of dendritic cells were found; these cells were only HLA-DR+. Follicle lining cells were negative for the MHC class II molecules. In normal thyroids from an area with sufficient iodine supply, no clusters of dendritic cells were seen. The few dendritic cells observed were lying isolated in the interstitium and only positive for HLA-DR and ICAM- 1; epithelial cells were negative for the studied markers. These data show clusters of dendritic cells in thyroids of inhabitants of an <b>endemic</b> area.

40|$|Background: Sudan is an <b>endemic</b> area of <b>goitre,</b> and thyroidectomy is {{a common}} {{operation}} in Khartoum. The most serious postthyroidectomy complication is airway obstruction, which may necessitate tracheostomy. This complication occurs most commonly in large goitres. Methods: This prospective cross-sectional {{study was conducted to}} find the incidence, indications, technique and complications of post thyroidectomy tracheostomy at three Teaching Hospitals in Khartoum (Khartoum Teaching Hospital, Soba University Hospital, and Police Teaching Hospital), between March 2000 - March 2002. All patients planed for thyroidectomy were interviewed with special interest in large goitres. Data were collected in a pre-designed questionnaire and then analyzed using computer and displaced in tables and figures. All patients were assessed clinically and radiological imaging of the neck was done. Pre and postoperative laryngeoscopy was routine in all patients. Results: Thirty-six patients underwent post thyroidectomy tracheostomy at a rate of 11 % at Khartoum Teaching Hospital (n= 31), 3. 8 % at Soba University Hospital (n= 3), 2. 4 % at Police Teaching Hospital (n= 2).

40|$|This thesis re-evaluates {{the initial}} use of organ {{replacement}} therapy in Britain during the 1890 s {{with regard to}} the thyroid gland and the associated disease entity of myxoedema as paradigmatic examples. The scope of my argument, however, encompasses the period between the 1850 s and 1910 s, as it approaches this subject from three perspectives. Firstly, this thesis examines the difficult and multifaceted history of thyroid insufficiency disorders between 1850 and 1878, such as <b>endemic</b> cretinism and <b>goitre.</b> Secondly, the introduction of myxoedema as a distinct clinical entity between 1878 and 1888 is discussed. Finally, the professional debates surrounding the new therapeutic approach of organ replacement therapy and its clinical application and scientific assessment are analysed for the period from the 1890 s onward. By focussing on the notions of disease causation via key historical figures and their publications, I argue that there was a mutual influence between the conception of myxoedema and organ replacement therapy, and that neither one would otherwise have become acceptable by the standards of late-nineteenth and early-twentieth-century scientific medicine. The origins of the ensemble of the new concepts and practices that constitute myxoedema and the associated organ replacement therapy can thereby be situated within a specific timeframe and context. They did not simply arise from contemporary medical knowledge, nor were they the culmination of some long-held desire of the medical community, or solely the result of medical progress. Instead, the practice of organ replacement therapy, as well as the new disease entity of myxoedema, depended on a view of the human body that assumed the medical possibility and desirability of replacing an organ’s lost function. This view was part of the concept of organ replacement, which emerged in the specific context of an experiment-oriented style of university medicine that predominated {{in the late nineteenth and}} early twentieth centuries. Its emergence depended on contemporary clinical and scientific practices as well as on the institutional and epistemological context within which these practices were embedded. As this thesis demonstrates, various social, scientific, and technical conditions needed to concur before organ replacement therapy could become part of medical reality...|$|R
40|$|Background: Although {{deficiency}} in dietary iodine remains {{the main cause}} of <b>endemic</b> and sporadic <b>goitre,</b> naturally occurring goitrogens in foods are additional factors that {{play a major role in}} developing goitre. In this study we focused on the relationship of different potential goitrogenous food and the development of goitre in preschool children in the rural area of Bwamanda, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Objectives: First, to do a semi-systematic literature review on the incidence of goitre and the role of dietary pattern in its genesis. Second, describe the incidence of goitre in preschool children in DRC in relation to age, sex, and season. Third, examine the effects of specific food items on occurrence of goitre in these children. Methods: For the 1 st objective, we used a semi- systematic method to search for relevant published articles to the topic area. We searched four online databases, three online journals, five authors and the reference lists of the identified key articles. We did a secondary analysis of the data from an original dynamic population study which was done in the rural area of Bwamanda, DRC. That study included an open cohort of 5657 children which was followed up every 3 months throughout six survey rounds, during a period of three years from 1989 - 1991. All the investigations and clinical examination were done by trained doctors and interviewers at special under five clinics in the study setting. Incidence of goitre among the children who were at risk of developing goitre was calculated for 5 survey intervals. The incidence of goitre was also assessed in relation to season, sex and age of the children. For the 3 rd specific objective, seven food items were selected to be investigated for their potential goitrogenic effects. The exposed group was those children who ate these foods and the unexposed group was the children who didn’t eat these foods. Age, sex, height for age Z-score (HAZ), and weight for length Z-score (WLZ) were considered as potential confounders. All selected food items and confounders were analysed using logistic regression analysis. Results: Four studies were included in the semi-systematic literature review; the conclusion was similar in all of them with iodine deficiency being {{the main cause of}} goitre in man, and cassava consumption being an important factor in addition to that. Incidence of goitre was different in each survey interval and it was higher in rainy season. The incidence of goitre increased significantly when children got older but being a male or a female was statistically unrelated. Eating cassava leaves, cassava tubers and maize played a major role in developing goitre especially in older children, while nuts reduced the risk of developing goitre in those children. Banana, fish and papaya had non-significant contributions. iv Conclusion: This study confirms that goitre incidence in children (0 - 5 years) in a rural area in Central Africa is significantly related with age as the older children had more risk to develop goitre than the younger children, but it had no relation to gender. The incidence of goitre increased also during rainy seasons. This is the 1 st longitudinal analysis showing the relationship between consumption of specific food items and the development of goitre in children (0 - 5 years) in a rural area in central Africa, where cassava and maize found to be important contributory factors while nuts may have a protective role in developing goitre in those children...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{prevalence}} ofendemic goitre {{is extremely}} high {{in certain parts}} of Sri Lanka where rates as high as 44 % have been observed. With nearly 10 million people at risk the aetiology of <b>endemic</b> <b>goitre</b> in Sri Lanka needs to be clearly ascertained. The <b>endemic</b> <b>goitre</b> belt of Sri Lanka coincides with the wet climatic zone, indicating an apparent relationship of iodine geochemistry with climatic factors. However, {{the fact that there is}} a correlation of only- 0. 64 between the iodine content and the prevalence ofgoitre suggests the existence of other factors uch as humic substances inthe soil, clay minerals and soil pH that exert an influence on the bioavailability of iodine. Iodization of salt used in food is the most convenient method of goitre prevention. It has been estimated that out of a population of 17 million in Sri Lanka, nearly 10 million people are at risk of goitre (Fernando et al. 1987).

40|$|The {{region of}} Grobnik, {{in the north}} west of Croatia, 15 km away from the Adriatic coast and 400 meters above the sea level, {{used to be known}} as a centre of <b>endemic</b> <b>goitre.</b> Iodine {{prophylaxis}} of 10 mg KJ added per kilo salt started in Croatia during the year 1953 and it was increased to 25 mg KJ per kilo in 1996. During 1961, the prevalence of goiter among Grobnik school children was 63 %, while in the adult population it was 34 %. In 1981, 18 % of goitrous school children and 11 % of goitrous adults were found in the same region, which shows the fall in goitre prevalence in the twenty-year period, from a severe to a mild one. The aim {{of this study was to}} estimate the effectiveness of iodine prophylaxis in goitre eradication and to compare the obtained results to those found in the same region 20 and 40 years ago, namely, in 1961 and 1981. The research was conducted in 2001. We examined 472 Grobnik inhabitants, 378 children (196 girls and 182 boys, aged 7 – 15 years) and 94 adults. Regarding their size thyroid glands were graded according to WHO and PAHO classification. Data regarding lifestyles and health conditions were collected by individual and family questionnaires. The prevalence of goitre in 2001 was 6. 6 % in school children and 6. 4 % in adults. In relation to 1981, we found a statistically significant fall of goitre in school children at the level of p 0. 01, x 2 = 1. 419). The frequency of thyroid gland hereditary diseases in native inhabitants was high, 11. 7 %. There were no statistically significant differences in the prevalence of goitre or thyroid hereditary diseases between groups of native and newcomers’ children. According to our results, in the year 2001 the area of Grobnik was still was a region of a mildly expressed <b>endemic</b> <b>goitre.</b> This study presents final results of a 40 -year long follow up of <b>endemic</b> <b>goitre</b> eradication, demonstrating the long-term effectiveness of iodine prophylaxis...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} to {{the community of the}} prevention of endemic goitre—a food-deficiency disease which causes feeble-mindedness, deaf-mutism, and general physical and mental degeneration {{from one generation to the}} next—and the simplicity of prevention, have only gradually been realized in the course of the past hundred years. In the early 19 th century, potassium iodide was used in goitre prevention, but the experiment was abandoned about the year 1858. The first controlled experiment was made in 1916 - 20, when a course of sodium iodide followed by 5, 000 schoolgirls in Akron, Ohio, USA, proved 100 % efficacious against the development of the disease. An investigation of the 20 th-century development of <b>endemic</b> <b>goitre</b> in West Virginia, USA, carried out in 1922, established a direct connexion between the abandonment of the use of locally available natural iodized salt and the development of a high incidence of <b>endemic</b> <b>goitre</b> in an area hitherto goitre-free. In 1924, an attempt to eliminate <b>endemic</b> <b>goitre</b> by replacing plain salt by iodized salt was made in the State of Michigan, USA. The experiment was at first resisted by the goitre surgeons; opposition was finally dispelled when a survey, carried out in the State four years later, proved that not one case of toxic goitre due to the consumption of iodized salt had occurred in three counties chosen as the test area. As a result of analyses made at a follow-up survey in 1936, it was recommended that all iodized salt be standardized at 0. 01 % of iodine. Since iodized salt is more expensive to produce than plain salt, support of the medical profession alone is not enough. Co-operation on the part of both governments and business is essential if iodized salt is to become available throughout the world at as low a price as plain salt. Recent experience in Argentina, where the introduction of iodized salt was accompanied by a prohibitive increase in selling price, illustrates this necessity...|$|E

Among adult women, the following prevalences of goitre were observed: 53 % (Oio), 48 % (Gabu), and 27 % (Cacheu). For goitres of grades 2 and 3 only, the prevalences were 20 % (Oio), 13 % (Gabu), and 2 % (Cacheu). No cretinism or cases of thyroid dysfunction were found. The mean urinary iodine excretions in Oio, Gabu, and Cacheu were 17 micrograms/g, 24 micrograms/g and 33 micrograms/g creatinine, respectively...|$|E
