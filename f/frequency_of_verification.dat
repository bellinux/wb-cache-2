30|$|As MPI {{starts the}} fault {{localization}} process {{based on the}} observation of symptoms over the related network entities (e.g., switches, end hosts, NF nodes) according to the Implementation View of the service provisioning policies, {{it is crucial to}} tradeoff the overhead and performance of such a fault localization process triggered by observing symptoms. MPI starts with less intrusive actions on coarse-grained symptoms by comparing the view of the network state offered by a logical centralized controller to the descriptive high level policy. MPI uses a configurable and adaptable timer to control the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>verification</b> actions to tradeoff the intrusiveness and fault detection efficiency.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{evaluate}} the patient set-up error of different anatomical sites, to estimate the effect <b>of</b> different <b>frequencies</b> <b>of</b> online <b>verifications</b> on the patient set-up accuracy, and to calculate margins to accommodate for the patient set-up error (ICRU set-up margin, SM). Methods and materials: Alignment data of 148 patients treated with inversed planned intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) or three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3 D-CRT) of the head and neck (n = 31), chest (n = 72), abdomen (n = 15), and pelvis (n = 30) were evaluated. The patient set-up accuracy was assessed using orthogonal megavoltage electronic portal images of 2328 fractions of 173 planning target volumes (PTV). In 25 patients, two PTVs were analyzed where the PTVs were located in different anatomical sites and treated in two different radiotherapy courses. The patient set-up error and the corresponding SM were retrospectively determined assuming no online verification, online verification once a week and online verification every other day. Results: The SM could be effectively reduced with increasing <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> online <b>verifications.</b> However, a significant <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> relevant set-up errors remained even after online verification every other day. For example, residual set-up errors larger than 5 mm were observed on average in 18 % to 27 % of all fractions of patients treated in the chest, abdomen and pelvis, and in 10 % of fractions of patients treated in the head and neck after online verification every other day. Conclusion: In patients where high set-up accuracy is desired, daily online verification is highly recommended...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a 2. 2 mm {{open-ended}} coaxial probe is selected for a broadband measurement of material permittivity ranging from kHz up to GHz. The measurement is individually {{carried out at}} three different frequency ranges: high frequency (HF, 500 MHz - 20 GHz), median frequency (MF, 10 MHz - 1 GHz), and low frequency (LF, 1 kHz - 15 MHz), in view of pertinent aperture admittance models, feasible measurement principles, and required calibrations for system biases. These considerations are discussed and described in turn from high frequency measurements to low <b>frequency</b> tests. <b>Verification</b> <b>of</b> the associated measurement techniques at the three operating frequency regimes is provided by experiments on pure methanol.

40|$|Bistable {{composite}} shells patented as Bistable Reeled Composite (BRC) booms {{have the potential}} to be used as lightweight structural elements for a number of space applications. This paper details an approach to increase the natural <b>frequency</b> and stiffness <b>of</b> BRCs. The motivation for this research is the desire to increase the scalability of a flexible "roll-up" solar array which, in its deployed state, consists of two cantilevered BRCs supporting a flexible Photo Voltaic (PV) cell covered blanket between them. A Finite Element (FE) numerical model is combined with a nonlinear constrained optimization to maximize the natural <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> BRC booms with respect to the fiber orientation angles and ply discontinuity locations. The results demonstrate that careful selection of the fiber orientation angles and the location of step thickness variations can significantly optimize the natural <b>frequency.</b> Experimental <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> the vibration characteristics of optimized BRC booms has also been conducted. Finally, stability analysis of the optimized BRC booms under bending has been carried out using FE simulation to quantify the Maximum Rotational Acceleration (MRA) that they can take before failure...|$|R
40|$|Information {{literacy}} {{involves the}} ability to find, access, evaluate, organise and store information {{in a variety of}} media, though there is as yet no consensus on a precise definition. This thesis, set in the context of higher education, explores aspects of information literacy associated with students’ evaluation of information found on the World Wide Web. Two studies relating to third level students’ evaluation of the credibility of online information were conducted. Study 1 examined whether the search results ranking that a website receives following a Google search query affects students’ perceived credibility of that website. Study 2 presented final year psychology students with information that was either relevant or not relevant to their area of study. In order to examine the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> information <b>verification</b> behaviours and to explore the nature of information processing (either heuristic or systematic) that underlies students’ interactions with online information. The results of Study 1 are consistent with the idea that state search engine rankings do not significantly impact participants’ evaluation of webpage content. The results of Study 2 indicate that final year psychology students did not engage in information verification behaviours more frequently when evaluating psychology-relevant versus psychology non-relevant information, but that they did evaluate the credibility of such information differently. These results are discussed {{in the context of the}} conceptual overlap between information literacy skills and the aims of higher education. N...|$|R
40|$|We {{extend the}} Purcell's {{original}} idea [Phys. Rev. 69, 682 (1946) ] on modification of photon spontaneous emission rate to modification of photon spontaneous scattering rate. We find {{the interplay of}} local incident field enhancement and local density of photon states enhancement {{in close proximity to}} a silver nanoparticle may result in up to 10 ^ 14 -fold rise of Raman scattering cross-section. Thus single molecule Raman detection is found to be explained by consistent quantum electrodynamic description without any chemical mechanism involved. A model of the so-called "hot points" in surface enhanced spectroscopy has been elaborated as local areas with high Q-factor at incident and scattered (emitted) light <b>frequencies.</b> For <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> the model we consider further experiments including transient Raman experiments to clarify incident field enhancement and scanning near-field optical mapping of local density of photon states.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{outcomes}} <b>of</b> <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> Perugini and Bagozzi’s model of goal-directed behavior, according to which determinants of bicycle commuting include one’s intention to behave this way, perceived behavioral control and <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> past behavior, and the individual’s intention is, in turn, influenced by attitudes, perceived social approval and emotions associated with this behavior. The model was tested on a sample of 814 subjects living in several regions of Russia (av- erage age 31 years, 70. 6 % males) using a survey. The scales of social psychological determinants were translated and adapted from the surveys used in previous studies. Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling confirmed the initial hypotheses only partially. It was proved that positive attitudes, perceived social ap- proval, expected positive emotions and <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> past behavior result in greater desire to commute by bicycle; and that this desire and <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> past behavior positively affect the subjects’ intention, whereas perceived behavioral control (i. e. perceived difficulties with behaving this way) affects their intention negatively. In contrast to our expectations negative emotions and perceived behavioral control don’t seem to predict desire to commute by bicycle.

40|$|Mixers and {{agitators}} {{are used}} {{in a variety of}} processing industries. Each application has its own uniqueness requiring a high degree of customization in process design and mechanical design. Many of the processing and mechanical performance characteristics of mixers are derived from torque cell and tachometer measurements usually located between the motor and speed reducer. This thesis deals with the development of a dynamic modeling and analysis procedure to simulate the torsional response of mixers. This procedure will allow for the characterization of the torsional response at any point within the system, as well as relate the response as observed at the measurement location on full scale tests to any point of interest within the system. Various modeling options were developed for each of the mixing subsystems and compared to determine which configurations more accurately describe the system torsional dynamics. The developed modeling options were simulated using Simulink and MATLAB. For torsional <b>frequency</b> <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> the simulation model, a finite element model was constructed, analyzed, and compared to the simulation model. Also, the results of a full scale test were obtained and compared to the simulation model. Recommendations for usage, further study, and model development are also discussed...|$|R
