40|$|A ring-model of vicious cycles in customer-employee-interaction is proposed: Service {{employees}} perceive complaints as {{a threat}} to their self-esteem resulting in defense responses such as an increased need for cognitive closure, a devaluation of the customer and their information and <b>degrading</b> <b>service</b> behavior. Confronted with such <b>degrading</b> <b>service</b> behavior, customers react defensively as well, by devaluing the employee for example with regard to his/her competence and by reducing repurchase and positive word-of-mouth. Three studies investigated each link in this ring-model. In study 1, participants were confronted with an aggressive or neutral customer complaint. Results show that motivated closed-mindedness (one aspect of the need for cognitive closure) increases after an aggressive complaint leading to a devaluation of the customer and their information, and in turn to a <b>degrading</b> <b>service</b> reaction. In study 2, participants were confronted with a <b>degrading</b> or favorable <b>service</b> reaction. Results show that they devaluate the employees’ competence after receiving a <b>degrading</b> <b>service</b> reaction and thus reduce their intention to repurchase. In study 3, we finally examined our predictions investigating real customer-employee-interactions: We analyzed data from an evaluation study in which mystery callers tested the service hotline of an airline. Results show that the employees’ competence is devaluated after degrading behavior and thus reduces positive word-of-mouth...|$|R

40|$|The {{computer}} systems {{that provide the}} information underpinnings for critical infrastructure applications, both military and civilian, {{are essential to the}} operation of those applications. Failure of the information systems can cause a major loss of service, and so their dependability is a major concern.

What is needed is a precise notion of what forms of <b>degraded</b> <b>service</b> are acceptable to users, under what circumstances each form is most useful, and the fraction of time such <b>degraded</b> <b>service</b> levels are acceptable.

We investigate this query scheduling problem with the objective of minimizing the serverÕs peak load.

40|$|Abstract – End-to-end {{connections}} {{experience a}} high level of diversity in network characteristics. At one extreme, an application may receive highly <b>degraded</b> <b>service,</b> leaving the application unusable. At another extreme, the costs to guarantee some level of service may be undesirably high to the user or overall system. Open architecture networks help applications push adaptation technology into the network and reduce the effects of poor network characteristics. Automated planning is important for the services that are supported by the open architecture. The remedies that modify an application’s data stream to adjust it to unfavorable network conditions should be located and ordered to provide good data transfer and network resources use. The search for good plans is a hard AI problem and requires additional research. Index Terms—adaptation, active networks, planning. I...|$|E
