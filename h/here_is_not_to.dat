2500|$|In 1995, Searle gave a {{brief reply}} to Derrida in The Construction of Social Reality. He called Derrida's {{conclusion}} [...] "preposterous" [...] {{and stated that}} [...] "Derrida, as far as I can tell, {{does not have an}} argument. He simply declares that there is nothing outside of texts..." [...] Searle's reference <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> anything forwarded in the debate, but to a mistranslation of the phrase [...] "il n'y a pas de hors-texte" [...] ("there is no outside-text") which appears in Derrida's Of Grammatology (1967).|$|E
2500|$|Prior to Lebanon's 2009 general {{elections}} (and its inclusion of Hezbollah), Livni [...] "acknowledged an important principle" [...] from U.S. President Barack Obama's then-recent speech in Cairo that [...] "Elections alone {{do not make}} true democracy." [...] She explained her position in a New York Times op-ed by alluding to her experience as Israel's justice minister when Hamas participated in Palestinian elections in 2006: [...] "At the time, the counterargument was that the very participation in elections would act as a moderating force on extremist groups. With more accountability, such groups would be tempted to abandon their militant approach {{in favor of a}} purely political platform. But this analysis ignored the possibility that some radical groups sought participation in the democratic process not to forsake their violent agenda but to advance it." [...] Livni advocated that [...] "the international community must adopt at the global level what true democracies apply at the national one—a universal code for participation in democratic elections. This would include requiring every party running for office to renounce violence, pursue its aims by peaceful means and commit to binding laws and international agreements." [...] She added: [...] "The intent <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> stifle disagreement, exclude key actors from the political process or suggest that democracy be uniform and disregard local cultures and values." ...|$|E

I {{wonder the}} learned Scriblerus has omitted to {{advertise}} the reader, {{at the opening}} of this poem, that Dulness <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be taken contractedly for mere stupidity, but in the enlarged sense of the word, for all slowness of apprehension, shortness of sight, or imperfect sense of things. It includes (as we see by the poet's own words) labour, industry, and some degree of activity and boldness--a ruling principle not inert, but turning topsy-turvy the understanding, and inducing an anarchy or confused state of mind. This remark ought to be carried along with the reader throughout the work; and without this caution he will be apt to mistake the importance of many of the characters, {{as well as of the}} design of the poet. Hence it is, that some have complained he chooses too mean a subject, and imagined he employs himself like Domitian, in killing flies; whereas those who have the true key will find he sports with nobler quarry, and embraces a larger compass; or (as one saith, on a like occasion)-- ...|$|E
60|$|When we {{know our}} own strength, we shall the better {{know what to}} {{undertake}} with hopes of success; and when we have well surveyed the POWERS of our own minds, and made some estimate what we may expect from them, we shall not be inclined either to sit still, and not set our thoughts on work at all, in despair of knowing anything; nor on the other side, question everything, and disclaim all knowledge, because some things {{are not to be}} understood. It is of great use to the sailor to know the length of his line, though he cannot with it fathom all the depths of the ocean. It is well he knows that it is long enough to reach the bottom, at such places as are necessary to direct his voyage, and caution him against running upon shoals that may ruin him. Our business <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> know all things, but those which concern our conduct. If we can find out those measures, whereby a rational creature, put in that state in which man is in this world, may and ought to govern his opinions, and actions depending thereon, we need not to be troubled that some other things escape our knowledge.|$|E

Because the objectives <b>here</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> save the vessel, the wrecks are usually refloated or removed by the cheapest and most practical method possible. In many cases, hazardous materials must be removed prior to disposing of the wreck.

6000|$|As Mr Stuart-Glennie {{traced the}} {{evolution}} of society to the conflict of races, his theory made some sensation among Socialists--that is, among {{the only people who}} were seriously thinking about historical evolution at all--by its collision with the class-conflict theory of Karl Marx. Nietzsche, as I gather, regarded the slave-morality as having been invented and imposed on the world by slaves making a virtue of necessity and a religion of their servitude. Mr Stuart-Glennie regards the slave-morality as an invention of the superior white race to subjugate the minds of the inferior races whom they wished to exploit, and who would have destroyed them by force of numbers if their minds had not been subjugated. As this process is in operation still, and can be studied at first hand not only in our Church schools and in the struggle between our modern proprietary classes and the proletariat, but in the part played by Christian missionaries in reconciling the black races of Africa to their subjugation by European Capitalism, we can judge for ourselves whether the initiative came from above or below. My object <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> argue the historical point, but simply to make our theatre critics ashamed of their habit of treating Britain as an intellectual void, and assuming that every philosophical idea, every historic theory, every criticism of our moral, religious and juridical institutions, must necessarily be either imported from abroad, or else a fantastic sally (in rather questionable taste) totally unrelated to the existing body of thought. I urge them to remember that this body of thought is the slowest of growths and the rarest of blossomings, and that {{if there is such a}} thing on the philosophic plane as a matter of course, it is that no individual can make more than a minute contribution to it. In fact, their conception of clever persons parthenogenetically bringing forth complete original cosmogonies by dint of sheer [...] "brilliancy" [...] is part of that ignorant credulity which is the despair of the honest philosopher, and the opportunity of the religious impostor.|$|E

"If by {{this inquiry}} {{into the nature of}} the {{understanding}} I can [...] discover the powers thereof, how far they reach, to what things [...] they are in any degree proportionate, and where they fail us, I [...] suppose it may be of use to prevail with the busy mind of man to be [...] more cautious in meddling with things exceeding its comprehension: [...] to stop when it is at the utmost extent of its tether; and to sit [...] down in quiet ignorance of those things which, upon examination, [...] are proved to be beyond the reach of our capacities.
