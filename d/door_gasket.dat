50|$|On 21 May 2002, {{at about}} 2330 PDT, while {{operating}} approximately 100 mi {{off the coast}} of San Diego, California, Dolphin was cruising on the surface, recharging her batteries, when a torpedo tube <b>door</b> <b>gasket</b> failed, and the boat began to flood. Due to high winds and 10 to 11 ft swells in the ocean, approximately 70 to 85 tons of seawater entered the ship, an amount perilously close to the boats reserve buoyancy. The flooding shorted electrical panels and started fires.|$|E
50|$|On {{reassembly}} {{care should}} be taken that the threaded plugs are replaced in their original holes: the tapers can vary {{as a result of}} rethreading. The mudhole <b>door</b> <b>gaskets,</b> if of asbestos, should be renewed but those made of lead may be reused; special instructions are in force for the disposal of these harmful materials. At large maintenance facilities the boiler would have been both washed and refilled with very hot water from an external supply to bring the locomotive back to service more quickly.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the cabinet loads of a typical household refrigerator/ freezer. The thennalload on the cabinet during closed door conditions is investigated. The area of greatest focus is the door and wall edge region of the refrigerator where thennal losses are greatest Conduction heat transfer into the refrigerator cabinet is quantified using numerical computer simulations and experimental measurements. The overall cabinet load is detennined, as well as specific loads for various pathways that sum to equal the total. Based on agreement between simulations and experiments, the complete edge loss accounts for approximately 30 % of the overall cabinet load on the fresh food and freezer compartments. In addition to this primary finding, percentages for heat leakage directly through the <b>door</b> <b>gaskets,</b> along the steel casing at the wall and door flanges, along the steel skin in the mullion section, due to the presence of a mullion anti-sweat heater, and due to the presence of an anti-sweat condenser tube are detennined.

50|$|Sensors {{that measure}} very small changes must have very high sensitivities. Sensors {{need to be}} {{designed}} to have a small effect on what is measured; making the sensor smaller often improves this and may introduce other advantages. Tactile sensors {{can be used to}} test the performance of all types of applications. For example, these sensors have been used in the manufacturing of automobiles (brakes, clutches, <b>door</b> seals, <b>gasket),</b> battery lamination, bolted joints, fuel cells etc.|$|R
50|$|Within these {{refrigerators}} and freezers, vaccines {{are also}} compromised through improper {{use of the}} <b>door</b> <b>gasket</b> to feed cables from data loggers and thermometers, allowing excess warm air in, and cold {{air out of the}} refrigerator or freezer. Over time this causes the compressor to work harder and eventually leads to failure. This can be remedied by using probe access ports, found on most clinical refrigerators and freezer. These are easy to open up and drastically reduce air intake and loss from inside the units.|$|E
50|$|Disposal of {{discarded}} refrigerators is regulated, often mandating {{the removal of}} doors; children playing hide-and-seek have been asphyxiated while hiding inside discarded refrigerators, particularly older models with latching doors. Since 2 August 1956, under U.S. federal law, refrigerator doors are no longer permitted to latch so they cannot be opened from the inside. Modern units use a magnetic <b>door</b> <b>gasket</b> that holds the door sealed but allows it to be pushed open from the inside. This gasket was invented, developed and manufactured by Max Baermann (1903-1984) of Bergisch Gladbach/Germany.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} probe the {{response}} of silicone <b>door</b> <b>gasket</b> materials to a postulated severe accident in an Italian nuclear power plant, compression stress relaxation (CSR) and compression set (CS) measurements were conducted under combined radiation (approximately 6 kGy/h) and temperature (up to 230 {degrees}C) conditions. By making some reasonable initial assumptions, simplified constant temperature and dose rates were derived that should do a reasonable job of simulating the complex environments for worst-case severe events that combine overall aging plus accidents. Further simplification coupled with thermal-only experiments allowed us to derive thermal-only conditions {{that can be used}} to achieve CSR and CS responses similar to those expected from the combined environments that are more difficult to simulate. Although the thermal-only simulations should lead to sealing forces similar to those expected during a severe accident, modulus and density results indicate that significant differences in underlying chemistry are expected for the thermal-only and the combined environment simulations. 15 refs., 31 figs., 15 tabs...|$|E

Composed of quartz fabric filled with alumina matting, gasket is bonded with room-temperature-vulcanizing material to periphery of door.

40|$|Frost {{formation}} on {{the cold}} evaporator surface is a typical problem in household refrigerators. It happens due to humidity present in the ambient air associated with frequent door openings. In addition, mass transfer from stored goods to dry internal cabinet air and moisture infiltration through <b>door</b> <b>gaskets</b> also contribute to frost formation on the evaporator surface. To prevent this, the evaporator has to be defrosted manually or automatically (as in modern refrigerators). To do so, an electrical heater is switched on at a preset time and frequency and defrosts the evaporator. During this time, defrosted water is drained through a pipe into a water tray which is usually placed at {{the vicinity of the}} compressor. There the water evaporates mainly due to heat transfer from hot compressor shell. This system of defrosting and evaporation works well in areas with low relative humidity, where the amount of defrosted water is small and the evaporation rate is higher when compared to places with high relative humidity. Moreover, the compressor shell temperatures of high efficient compressors are not usually high enough to provide the minimum evaporation rate to balance the defrosted water flow rate and thus avoid water overflow. The aim of this work is to get {{a better understanding of the}} defrosted water evaporation process and to come up with low cost, practical and more efficient designs of water trays. To this end a test facility was designed and constructed to reproduce the compressor operating conditions and the defrosted water flow rate and temperature. The test rig was placed within a climate-controlled room with a strict control of air temperature and relative humidity. A mathematical model was also developed to predict the water evaporation rate based on the fundamental conservation equations of mass and energy. Several tests were carried out under different operating conditions and with different water trays designs. The model predictions were compared to the experimental data base with most of the points falling within an error band of ? 10 %...|$|R
40|$|A fault {{detection}} and diagnosis (FDD) method {{was used to}} detect and diagnose faults on both a refrigerator and an air conditioner during normal cycling operation. The objective of the method is to identify a set of sensors that can detect faults reliably before they severely hinder system performance. Unlike other methods, this one depends on the accuracy {{of a number of}} small, on-line linear models, each of which is valid over a limited range of operating conditions. To detect N faults, N sensors are needed. Using M>N sensors can further reduce the risk of false positives. For both the refrigerator and air conditioner systems, about 1000 combinations of candidate sensor locations were examined. Through inspection of matrix condition numbers and each sensor's contribution to {{fault detection}} calculation, the highest quality sets of sensors were identified. The issue of detecting simultaneous multiple faults was also addressed, with varying success. Fault detection was verified using both model simulations and experimental data. The results were similar, although in practice only one of the two would probably be used. Both load-type faults (such as <b>door</b> <b>gasket</b> leaks) and system faults were simulated on the refrigerator. It was found that system faults were generally more easily detectable than load faults. Refrigerator experiments were performed on a typical household refrigerator because it was readily available in a laboratory, but the results of this project may be more immediately useful on larger commercial, industrial or transport refrigeration systems. Air conditioner experiments were performed on a 3 -ton split system. Again, the economic benefits of this type of fault detection scheme may also be more feasible for larger field-assembled systems.

5000|$|LifeProof {{combines}} many {{technologies to}} create a case that protects electronic devices from the inside out. The case will make the phone waterproof, dirtproof, snowproof, and shockproof. [...] LifeProof's case for Apple iPhones only adds 1/16 in {{to the sides of}} the phone. The case combines a polycarbonate frame, waterproof acoustic ports, a waterproof screen protector that is still fully touch sensitive, and a built-in optical glass that covers over the phone's camera lenses to prevent loss of photographic detail. Every LifeProof case is put together in a two-part snap-together assembly that has a thin polymer gasket where it closes. Each case then becomes fully waterproof after sealing, and also seals the charging port via a hinged, <b>gasketed</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R
40|$|With the {{development}} of transgenic and specialized mouse strains, there is an increased need for inhalation exposure systems designed for smaller exposure groups. An inhalation exposure chamber, designed specifically for the exposure of up to 40 mice, was characterized. The chamber was fabricated from 0. 32 -cm-thick ((1) /(8) -in) aluminum sheets with outside dimensions of 61 cm long by 32 cm high by 34 cm deep, resulting in an internal volume of 65 L. Two stainless-steel open-mesh cages, separated by an absorbent barrier, can be stacked within the central portion of the chamber. Access is provided through a <b>gasketed</b> <b>door</b> with a safety-glass face. Tests were performed to determine the chamber leakage rate, degree of mixing, and spatial variation of two aerosols within the chamber. Results indicated that the fractional leakage rate was 0. 0003 min(- 1), well below a reported criterion for an operating chamber. Chamber operation gave similar mixing performance with, or without, use of an interior fan. For aerosols with a mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of 2. 56 micro m and 3. 14 micro m, the spatial variation of particulate matter concentration resulted in coefficients of variation (CVs) of 4. 8 % and 11. 0 %, respectively. These CV values are comparable to those obtained from similar studies involving other inhalation exposure chambers...|$|R
40|$|To {{ensure that}} an {{electronic}} system will work properly under all conditions, its designer must control {{the flow of}} electromagnetic (EM) fields {{to and from the}} system. The principal method of control is the use of a metallic enclosure or shield. In many cases, the effectiveness of the shield is determined, not by the bulk material properties, but by apertures that exist in the shield. These apertures may be introduced intentionally, {{as in the case of}} windows in the skin of an aircraft, or unintentionally, as in the case of an improperly welded seam of poorly <b>gasketed</b> <b>door.</b> To minimize the penetration of EM fields through a large aperture, the aperture is sometimes loaded with a conductive material. Previous workers have shown that the penetration of EM fields through open or loaded apertures can be calculated by determining the equivalent magnetic surface currents, Mâs, that exist over the surface of the aperture. For small apertures, the equivalent magnetic and electric dipole moments (and polarizabilities) are related to the irrotational and solenoidal components of Mâ s respectively. In this thesis, the relevant integro-differential equations are solved using the Method of Moments to determine Mâs and to calculate the equivalent polarizabilities and shielding effectiveness of a small, square aperture loaded with an impedance sheet. Results of measurements of the penetration of EM fields through an aperture loaded with conductive material made using a dual transverse electromagnetic (TEM) cell over a frequency range of 2 to 200 MHz are presented and compared with the numerical results. The conductive materials examined include carbon, hybrid and non-carbon composite materials, and metallic grids and meshes. The composite samples were fabricated to study the effects of fibre orientation, conductivity, sample lay-up, and degree of hybridization on the electromagnetic shielding properties. Wire grids and meshes were fabricated to study the effect of wire spacing on shielding properties...|$|R
