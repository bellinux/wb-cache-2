30|$|Considering BECO’s 1 st period, {{the results}} show that a shock from oil price causes no <b>fluctuation</b> <b>in</b> stock returns. A shock to the oil price will cause a 0.096 % <b>fluctuation</b> <b>in</b> stock returns in period 2. An oil price shock in period 3 also {{accounts}} for about 99.80 % of the variation <b>in</b> the <b>fluctuation</b> of stock returns, and this continues through period 20. The result in period indicates that no <b>fluctuation</b> <b>in</b> the variation of CONOIL’ stock return is due to innovations in the oil price. The 0.119 % variation in the stock return is due to the shock from oil price in period 2. Additionally, a shock to oil price causes a 0.124 % <b>fluctuation</b> <b>in</b> the variation of stock returns in period 3. On the other hand, in period 20 (long term), a shock in the oil price causes a 0.477 % <b>fluctuation</b> <b>in</b> stock returns.|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to the large <b>fluctuations</b> <b>in</b> Haumea's light curve due to the body's shape, which affect all colours equally, smaller independent colour variations seen in both visible and near-infrared wavelengths show a region on the surface that differs both in colour and in albedo.

40|$|Background: Radial artery (RA) pulse {{diagnosis}} {{has been}} used in traditional Asian medicine. Blood pressure (BP) and pulse rate related to heart rate variability (HRV) can be monitored via the RA. The <b>fluctuation</b> <b>in</b> these parameters has been assessed using fast Fourier transform (FFT) analytical methods that calculate power spectra. Methods: We measured blood flow volume (Volume) in the RA and evaluated its fluctuations. Normal participants (n = 34) were enrolled. We measured the hemodynamics of the right RA for approximately 50 s using ultrasonography. Results: The parameters showed the center frequency (CF) of the power spectrum at low frequency (LF) and high frequency (HF). More than one spectral component indicated that there were fluctuations. The CF at LF for Volume was significantly different from that for vessel diameter (VD); however, it was significantly correlated with blood flow velocity (Velocity). On the other hand, the CF at HF for Volume was significantly different from that for Velocity; however, it was significantly correlated with VD. Conclusion: It is suggested that <b>fluctuation</b> <b>in</b> the Volume at LF of RA is influenced by the <b>fluctuation</b> <b>in</b> Velocity; on the other hand, <b>fluctuation</b> <b>in</b> the Volume at HF is influenced by the <b>fluctuation</b> <b>in</b> VD...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The study {{examined}} associations of intrinsic <b>fluctuation</b> <b>in</b> daily negative affect (i. e., depression and anger) with adult day service (ADS) use, daily experiences, and other caregiving characteristics. METHODS: This was an 8 -day diary of 173 family caregivers {{of individuals with}} dementia. Multilevel models with common within-person variance were fit first to show average associations between daily stressors and mean level of daily affect. Then multilevel models with heterogeneous within-person variance were fit to test the hypotheses on associations between ADS use, daily experiences, and intrinsic <b>fluctuation</b> <b>in</b> daily affect. RESULTS: The study showed that, when the sum of ADS days was greater than average, there was a stabilizing effect of ADS use on caregivers 2 ̆ 7 within-person <b>fluctuation</b> <b>in</b> negative affect. Moreover, fewer daily stressors and greater-than-average daily care-related stressors, more positive events, not being a spouse, greater-than-average duration of caregiving, and less-than-average dependency of individuals with dementia on {{activities of daily living}} were associated with less fluctuation. Better sleep quality was associated with less intrinsic <b>fluctuation</b> <b>in</b> anger; and younger age and more years of education were associated with less intrinsic <b>fluctuation</b> <b>in</b> daily depression. CONCLUSIONS: Because emotional stability has been argued as an aspect of emotional well-being in the general populations, intrinsic fluctuation of emotional experience was suggested as an outcome of evidence-based interventions for family caregivers...|$|R

Metamorphlings are divided in roughly equal numbers between males and females, while juvenile frogs are observed less often than their mature counterparts, although scientists are not sure whether this is due to lower abundance or increased reclusiveness.|$|E

5|$|The {{power supply}} used in SMAW has {{constant}} current output, {{ensuring that the}} current (and thus the heat) remains relatively constant, even if the arc distance and voltage change. This is important because most applications of SMAW are manual, requiring that an operator hold the torch. Maintaining a suitably steady arc distance is difficult if a constant voltage power source is used instead, since it can cause dramatic heat variations and make welding more difficult. However, because the current is not maintained absolutely constant, skilled welders performing complicated welds can vary the arc length to cause minor <b>fluctuations</b> <b>in</b> the current.|$|E
5|$|The true {{nature of}} the {{supernova}} remained obscure for some time. Observers slowly came to recognize a class of stars that undergo long-term periodic <b>fluctuations</b> <b>in</b> luminosity. Both John Russell Hind in 1848 and Norman Pogson in 1863 had charted stars that underwent sudden changes in brightness. However, these received little attention from the astronomical community. Finally, in 1866, English astronomer William Huggins made the first spectroscopic observations of a nova, discovering lines of hydrogen in the unusual spectrum of the recurrent nova T Coronae Borealis. Huggins proposed a cataclysmic explosion as the underlying mechanism, and his efforts drew interest from other astronomers.|$|E

Simulation results demonstrate that the new algorithm can achieve efficient adaptation as high as the "neural gas" algorithm, which is reported as one of the most efficient clustering methods. It is a key to add uncorrelated random <b>fluctuation</b> <b>in</b> the similarity evaluation process for each reference vector. For hardware implementation of this process, we propose a nanostructure, whose operation is described by a single-electron circuit.
