25|$|Baldwin and Melisende {{agreed to}} put the {{decision}} to the Haute Cour. The Haute Cour decided that Baldwin would rule {{the north of the}} kingdom and Melisende the richer Judea and Samaria, and Jerusalem itself. Melisende acquiesced, though with misgivings. This decision would prevent a civil war but also divide the kingdom's resources. Though later historians criticized Melisende for not abdicating in favor of her son, there was little impetus <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. She was universally recognized as an exceptional steward for her kingdom, and her rule had been characterized as a wise one by church leaders and other contemporaries. Baldwin had not shown any interest in governance prior to 1152, and had resisted responsibility in this arena. The Church clearly supported Melisende, as did the barons of Judea and Samaria.|$|E

25|$|Masuzoe has {{married three}} times. His first {{marriage}} {{was to a}} French woman whom he met while studying in Europe; they divorced. He married Ministry of Finance bureaucrat Satsuki Katayama in 1986; they were divorced in 1989 and Katayama later {{became a member of}} the Diet. Masuzoe is known to have five children, three of which were born out of wedlock by two other women; one of his children, aged 25 as of 2014, is seriously disabled, and Masuzoe's negotiations with the child's mother over support payments drew attention in the Japanese tabloid press. Prime Minister Abe said that he wanted Katayama more than anyone else to stand in support of Masuzoe's 2014 gubernatorial bid, but Katayama responded that it was difficult <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so given the state of the negotiations. The magazine Nikkan Gendai reported in 2007 that Masuzoe held a wedding ceremony with another Japanese woman in France (but was not legally married to her) before marrying his first wife.|$|E
500|$|Tessa {{remained}} {{extremely popular}} with the audience after her death, prompting the producers to develop the season two finale episode [...] "Counterfeit" [...] to bring her back. According to Kirsch, Vandernoot did not realize her, or her character's, popularity before attending conventions. Paul said that Vandernoot was surprised that her character had so much influence {{on the show and}} that her return was [...] "...fun <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> especially to play a different character which was similar to Tessa but also had an evil intent to her." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Sing" [...] features" [...] primary vocals by Lennox and American singer Madonna; {{the latter}} sings solo {{on the second}} verse. Apart from them, the line-up {{consists}} of: Anastacia, Isobel Campbell, Dido, Céline Dion, Melissa Etheridge, Fergie, Beth Gibbons, Faith Hill, Angélique Kidjo, Beverley Knight, Gladys Knight, k.d. lang, Sarah McLachlan, Beth Orton, Pink, Bonnie Raitt, Shakira, Shingai Shoniwa, Joss Stone, Sugababes, KT Tunstall and, Martha Wainwright. Since accommodating all the singers would have posed a scheduling challenge, Lennox asked them to contribute vocals on the chorus of the song. When she received the recorded vocals from Madonna, Lennox found that Madonna had not only sung during the chorus, but also contributed by singing the second verse. She [...] "was really touched – for Madonna is very rigorous in what she gets involved in and <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that for me, I was thrilled to bits". Lennox also admitted that featuring Madonna would bring a bigger audience for the song, thereby helping the cause. The refrain consists of an [...] "empowering message" [...] with the group of singers belting the line [...] "Sing my sister Sing! / Let your voice be heard" [...] while interpolating [...] "Jikelele" [...] in between. According to Jon Pareles of The New York Times, [...] "Sing" [...] consists of a piano played in the background reminiscent of Marvin Gaye's 1968 single, [...] "I Heard It Through the Grapevine".|$|E

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from November 19, 1910. It states: [...] "Ella Brown is {{the only child of}} a poor widower. Their home is {{in a small town in}} the Middle West, and Ella has never seen New York (City), although she has always wanted to go there. Her father, finding times hard, decides to take a chance in the gold fields of Alaska, and when the play opens, is about to start there. He leaves Ella in the care of an aunt, a sour old person who runs a boarding house, who promptly makes a drudge out of the girl. As she has no other relatives, there is nothing <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> except submit. Sitting in her room one evening, tired after a day's hard work, she looks at her two treasured magazines, one showing views of her pet city and the other giving the latest fashion. The girl is filled with a longing to travel and wear pretty clothes, and falls asleep. In her dream she is transported to New York, where she finds enough money to enable her to buy all the pretty things she admires. Ella greatly enjoys her visit, and is extremely unhappy when she wakes up. But she finds that her dream will become reality before long, for her father has returned from the gold fields with a fortune and a desire to fulfill all the wishes of his pretty daughter." ...|$|E
500|$|Murray {{viewed the}} holonovel as {{a space in}} which the series explores Janeway's social and romantic relationships. She pointed out that Janeway chose a {{narrative}} {{that focuses on the}} [...] "perils of the governess's intense social relationships rather than the physical terrors of the situation". According to Murray, the computer program was written to challenge Janeway's imagination and not her intellect. She added that the series approached Janeway's romance with the fictional Lord Burleigh as a serious [...] "exercise posing psychological and moral questions" [...] for the audience and characters to explore during the episodes. Van Riper included Janeway {{as an example of how}} fictional female captains are more likely to create or maintain romantic relationships during their voyages than fictional men. Taylor viewed the holonovel, specifically its use in [...] "Persistence of Vision", as central to Janeway's character development as it allowed her to move on from her previous relationship with her fiancée Mark Johnson (Stan Iver). During a discussion of her approach to Janeway's personal life, Taylor wrote: [...] "We cannot put her into romantic situations until she decides he has given her up for dead and moved on, and the only wise thing <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is the same". Murray noted that Janeway shares many features with the character Jane Eyre, particularly [...] "a strong resistance to being bullied, a willingness to stand on principle, and the courage to face fear and isolation head-on". She wrote that the holonovel allows viewers to see [...] "unexpected sides of familiar characters". Murray called Janeway a [...] "person of Victorian integrity" [...] and described the holonovel as opening a channel of exploration that brings her [...] "the benefit of self-knowledge" [...] in order to return her to [...] "the real world all the stronger".|$|E

2500|$|... "Linda was {{a wonderfully}} {{cooperative}} young lady that needed direction. Had no technique and no real acting experience. She {{was engaged to}} marry Dick Zanuck. So in Planet of the Apes they put her in with Frank Schaffner, then in mine, they underwrote her. They had nothing <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in this one, except just {{be part of the}} sequel. In other words, she was so badly conceived in the writing that I had to conceive actions for her to make her belong to the piece. And the big action which I gave her – and I think she came off beautifully with it – was to try to understand what these people were trying to communicate to her. And struggling to understand and feeling sympathetic vibrations coming from these people. So I gave her something which was not in the script to play and she played that, I think, very simpatico, very beautifully." ...|$|E
2500|$|Debnam-Carey {{viewed the}} {{betrayal}} as a relief and release for {{herself as an}} actor, and as a [...] "very honest" [...] and [...] "open" [...] moment for Lexa.

She said Clarke's portrayer, Eliza Taylor, was [...] "brilliant" [...] and [...] "great to work with and between the two of us, we were just very connected with each other and made sure that that was the strong force of that scene." [...] To Debnam-Carey, Lexa [...] "showing that she cared, even in that moment of betrayal" [...] was Lexa being real. Debnam-Carey argued that even though Lexa was upset by the betrayal, she is a very hardened person and her people continued to be her main concern. She does not think Lexa was preoccupied with the repercussions. Unlike Rothenberg, Debnam-Carey felt [...] " [...] always knew [...] was going to [...] Now those cards are back on the table, if she wants to restart an alliance or whatever else." ...|$|E

2500|$|When Riddle {{learned of}} Ronstadt's {{desire to learn}} more about {{traditional}} pop music and agreed to record with her, he insisted on a whole album or nothing. He explained to Ronstadt that he had once turned down Paul McCartney, who had sought him out to write an arrangement for one of McCartney's albums, [...] "I just couldn't do it. You can't put something like that {{in the middle of a}} bunch of other things. The mood comes and then it changes. It's like putting a picture in a bad frame." [...] Riddle was at first skeptical of Ronstadt's proposed project, but once he agreed, his career turned upside down immediately. [...] <b>For</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> [...] "elevator music", as she called it, was a great surprise to the young audience. Joe Smith, the president of Elektra, was terrified that the albums would turn off the rock audience. The three albums together sold over seven million copies and brought Riddle back to a young audience during the last three years of his life. Arrangements for Linda Ronstadt's What's New (1983) and Lush Life (1984) won Riddle his second and third Grammy Awards.|$|E
