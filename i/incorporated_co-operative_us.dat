40|$|The major {{concerns}} for the availability of climate and agrometeorological data {{as we move into}} the 21 st century continue to be in areas of data collection and data base management. New technologies have advanced our ability to address these issues but the solutions may require the commitment of resources that may yet be outside the reach of developing countries. This paper briefly reviews new and existing technologies in the areas of data collection methods with some emphasis on remote sensing methods. An example for a conceptual data base management system adapted by the US Department of Agriculture is presented as a framework for the acquisition, maintenance and distribution of climate and agrometeorological data for the 21 st century. The access of data to the national and international community can be resolved with the standardization of data base management and electronic accessibility. Databases in the US have been upgraded for access through the World Wide Web, and include data archived from other countries that have <b>co-operative</b> programs with <b>US</b> institutions.

40|$|Following {{a review}} of {{previous}} work in this area, a presentation is made which illustrates {{the impact of a}} naive application of DVS in a system <b>incorporating</b> a time-triggered <b>co-operative</b> (TTC) scheduler. Novel algorithms (TTC-jDVS, TTC-jDVS 2) and then introduced which more successfully integrate TTC and DVS techniques. These algorithms involve: (i) changes to system timer settings when the frequency is altered; (ii) use of a form of 'sandwich delay' to reduce the impact of changes to the scheduler overhead which arise as a result of frequency changes, and (iii) execution of jitter-sensitive tasks at a fixed operating frequency. The impact of these algorithms on both jitter and energy consumption is illustrated empirically on a representative hardware platform, using both 'dummy' task sets and a more realistic case study. In designs for which low jitter is an important consideration, at least a limited degree of task pre-emption may be required. A simple time-triggered hybrid (TTH) scheduler can be used to achieve such behaviour. A novel TTH secluding algorithm (TTH-jDVS) is presented and evaluated, again through use of dummy task sets and a case study. The third piece of experimental work presented in this thesis illustrates that [...] - in situations where minimal jitter is required [...] - hardware support is required. To illustrate the potential of such an approach a final case study is employed...|$|R
40|$|In 1949 the Friends Neighborhood Guild, a Quaker Settlement House, began {{construction}} on the 8 th and Brown Co-operative in the North Philadelphia neighborhood of East Poplar. The motivation for the project came from the pressing need for housing after WWII, a desire to provide decent housing to East Poplar's poor residents and creeping urban blight in the neighborhood. The 8 th and Brown <b>Co-operative</b> <b>incorporated</b> a number of innovative and avant-garde features, including {{that most of the}} construction work would be completed by the future tenants, the use of European inspired communitarian design and tenant ownership and operation of the building. The unique project came out of both the Friends Neighborhood Guild's own infatuation with the ability of avant-garde housing to radically improve the housing situation of the country's poor and the post-war Federal public housing programs which provided the Guild with the necessary material support. Despite the Guild's optimistic attitude {{at the outset of the}} project, it met a number of unforeseen problems in part due to the pioneering nature of the project. These problems resulted in the Guild's increasing disillusionment with the promise and potential of avant-garde public housing. As such the Guild's subsequent projects during the post-war period-–the urban renewal of East Poplar in 1961 and an elderly public housing unit completed in 1966 [...] displayed a decidedly pragmatic and conventional style. The Guild's shift from idealism to pragmatism mirrors a broader decline in the country's faith in the ability of the government and public housing to solve the problem of urban decay...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Current {{advances}} in {{wireless sensor networks}} {{have contributed to the}} development of multi-hop wireless body sensor networks (WBSNs). These networks, which are primarily comprised of low-power sensor nodes, provide long term health and physiological monitoring of patients without obstructing their normal activities. However, the time-varying nature of network resources poses a significant challenge to the high reliability of operations required of a body sensor network. In this paper, we address the problem of reliability optimization in multihop WBSNs, where the nodes co-operate with each other in maximizing system performance. We model our problem as a co-operative game which inherently induces a distributed mechanism that optimizes the reliability of network operations in a multi-hop WBSN supporting concurrent applications. By the term ‘reliability’, we imply the system utility generated when each sensor node (user) services its specific application. We denote the system utility as an instance of the vector of utilities of individual users, where each user’s utility is a function of its allocated bandwidth. Our mechanism jointly accounts for the dynamistic nature of the wireless medium, application quality of service, user fairness in achieving the resources to service applications, and results in an optimal operating point (utility vector) at which the WBSN should operate. We arrive at the result that the Nash bargaining solution of the <b>co-operative</b> game gives <b>us</b> the optimal system operating point, i. e., the Nash bargaining solution optimizes the overall system reliability...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} the feasibility and acceptability of training for general practitioners (GPs) in medication review provided by practice pharmacists. Methods: Within {{the setting of}} a Scottish Local Health Care <b>Co-operative</b> <b>incorporating</b> 17 general practices, practice pharmacists delivered a 1 -hour practice-based group training session to interested GPs, covering a systematic approach to medication review and case studies. One session of funded locum cover was provided for each GP to review up to 6 patients {{of his or her}} choice. Practice pharmacists and GPs reviewed patient notes together before GPs saw patients alone. Subsequently pharmacists abstracted data from medical records. Medication-related issues identified during reviews and resultant actions were categorised. The views of GPs on the training were obtained by postal questionnaires. Results: Training was received by 51 / 74 GPs from 10 / 17 practices. In 174 reviews analysed, differences in patient medication use from computer records, ineffective medication and missing computer diagnoses were identified most frequently. There was a median of 5 actions per patient, including a median of 2 changes in prescribed drugs. Only 3 reviews resulted in no actions, while 80 % of patients had at least 1 prescribing record change. A total of 27 (61 %) GPs returned questionnaires; most considered medication review important and were satisfied with the training. Confidence in conducting reviews increased in 14 (52 %) GPs. Many indicated they would increase reviews, but time was a barrier for almost all. Although few considered contract or accreditation to be motivating factors, most agreed the training would help them achieve standards for both. Conclusions: Training by pharmacists was feasible and acceptable, but time constraints may limit the translation of reviews into routine practice...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{represents the}} testimony of six women’s understanding of the divine feminine, including myself as co-researcher. Through a co-operative inquiry, we explored how our understanding influences us as social practitioners. <b>Co-operative</b> inquiry offered <b>us</b> an experiential and participative process to engage with the topic, by using a radical approach to research, in which the traditional role of researcher {{was replaced by a}} team of co-researchers all in equal positions. In this way, the research outcomes were generated based on a group effort. This study is important because an inquiry into the divine feminine demonstrates the challenges we face as social justice advocates particularly in terms of our personal identity as women and our personal experiences of power. The research suggests if we are truly to engage in practices that are emancipatory, empowering and transformative, we need to address those challenges and review our relationship to power. The results of this research demonstrate how the process of inquiry into the divine feminine calls for: having a balanced view, particularly in activism  reclaiming our power in our relationship to our womanhood and femininity  reclaiming our relationship to our body, our feeling self and to nature We were each touched, moved and inspired by the inquiry process. The inward reflection not only honed our self-reflective skills, it also created a bridge to a deeper understanding of who we are. We learnt through group dynamics, how to collaborate and authentically engage in reflection and meaning-making, despite our differences and beliefs. We uncovered, through transformation of our being, the qualities of the divine feminine. What we discovered, was not a list of qualities to aspire to, rather the transformative aspect of the divine feminine {{was in the process of}} inquiry. It was in this process of inquiring what the divine feminine means, that each of us came into relationship with ourselves in a new transformative way...|$|R
40|$|A {{group of}} nine grape growers {{with a total}} of 49. 6 {{hectares}} growing potentially 274 tonnes of wine grapes. Six of the nine growers produce wine, but all rely to some degree on external sales of the unprocessed grapes. The group has the potential to produce 17, 850 dozen bottles of wine. The market for wine grapes and wine suggests static consumption and an over supply of some grape varieties. Research is indicating that vineyards of under 15 hectares tend to be low performing and that a clear focus on the managemn 4 t of the vineyard business is critical. A co-operative strategy may well be the way for smaller producers to achieve more efficient management (practices) and return on investment. From a wine marketing perspective, the YVSWG faces a great challenge in establishing a new brand in a crowded marketplace. However, if the group is able to work in a systematic, united manner - improved market penetration of individual brands is possible. Marketing success will be contingent on: (1) The quality assurance process to screen potential members and validate ongoing membership. All (accredited) wines from the producer can then bear the group’s branding. The primary purpose of such assurance is to maintain group integrity. (2) A sales/tasting outlet possibly using an existing facility in a central Yarra Valley location. (3) Budgets established and monitored. (4) Effective branding of YVSWG, to permeate all marketing decisions. (5) Pricing of any individual wine not exceeding $ 20 for unoaked whites, $ 25 for oaked whites and $ 30 for oaked reds (except for the occasional reserve wine). (6) Promotion through web page and links, strategic alliances with local tour companies, wine festivals and special events, promotional dinners and events, restaurants and one retail store - as well as a sustained media program. Advertising is not recommended. (7) YVSWG launch - a two stage process, launching the concept, then launching the initial wines once released. (8) Packaging must reflect the branding proposition. Quality design of the logo and branding will be a necessary investment. The SWGA has a choice of company, <b>incorporated</b> association or <b>co-operative</b> organisational structure with a company limited by guarantee being the preferred model. Of the three financial models developed, the model incorporating an initial joining fee then yearly membership fees and a levy based on sales is preferred.
