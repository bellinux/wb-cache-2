5|$|On March 25, 1998, {{the station}} at Watsessing Avenue {{was given the}} State Historical Preservation Organization honor that Ampere, Glen Ridge and Bloomfield {{stations}} received just fourteen years prior. The station continued to receive service through the opening of Montclair Connection on September 30, 2002, which ended service as the Montclair Branch and began as the Montclair-Boonton Line, still the first station on the line after Newark Broad Street Station. On September 10, 2007, New Jersey Transit announced the canopies of the old station, then 95 years old, were to be restored and repaired. The service contracted a $1.7 million project to Watertrol Incorporated of Cranford. At that time, the station served an average of 200people daily. Improvements for the station included brand new canopy lighting, repairs to the cantilever canopies, replacement of stairways and fencing, along with changing roof tiles and a new drainage system to replace the 1912 version. When the construction was finished in October 2008, the station now served nearly 450people <b>daily</b> <b>on</b> average. A ceremony to mark its completion was held on October 30, 2008.|$|E
