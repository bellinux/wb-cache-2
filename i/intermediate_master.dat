50|$|As with {{immersion}} lithography, defect {{control is}} expected to improve as the technology matures. Defects from the template with size below the post-imprint process bias can be eliminated. Other defects would require effective template cleaning and/or the use of intermediate polymer stamps. When vacuum is not used during the imprint process, air can get trapped, resulting in bubble defects. This is because the imprint resist layer and the template or stamp features are not perfectly flat. There is an elevated risk when the <b>intermediate</b> or <b>master</b> stamp contains depressions (which are especially easy air traps), or when the imprint resist is dispensed as droplets just before imprinting, rather than pre-spun onto the substrate. Sufficient time must be allowed for the air to escape. These effects are much less critical if flexible stamper materials are used, e.g. PDMS. Another issue is adhesion between stamp and resist. High adhesion (sticking) may delaminate resist, which than stays on stamp. This effect degrades pattern, reduces yield and damages stamp. It can be mitigated by employing an FDTS antistiction layer on a stamp.|$|R

After detailed literature review {{it was hypothesized that}} the mean full scale IQ score of adults with Obsessive Compulsive disorder will be higher than the mean full-scale IQ score of adults with (i) Schizophrenia and (ii) Depression. Since the previous century research work has been started on intelligence investigating how it is related to psychiatric disorders e. g Goodman and Graham, (1996) found psychiatric problems as the strongest consistent predictor of intelligence quotient (IQ). Further several other researchers found the effects of psychological disorders on intellectual functions (Tallis et al. 1999; Savage et al. 2000; Zitterl et al, 2001; Tuna et al. 2005). Through purposive sampling technique; considering the independent group design, a sample of 90 (30 in each group) was selected from different psychiatric clinics and hospitals of Karachi- Pakistan.

40|$|The degrees {{granted by}} colleges and {{universities}} may be traced from two early sources. In part they are {{of the nature of}} the graded series of titles of the peerage, which are marks of royal favor. The oldest in the series of those designations which we now call college degrees is that of doctor, first bestowed as evidence of princely favor and gratitude upon individual teachers. The first designations by educational institutions were also doctorates; in law at Bologna and in theology at Paris. The major source of collegiate degrees is from designations of attainment in the guild of teachers. These were patterned after the designations in the craft guilds which were master and apprentice, and in some craft guilds extended to a designation of craftsman or journeyman, <b>intermediate</b> between <b>master</b> and apprentice. The guild of teachers at first used only one designation, namely, that of master of arts, applied to one considered compe 7 tent to teach the seven liberal arts constituting the trivium (grammar, logic, and rhetoric) and the quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music). The designation of doctor was at first restricted to those who taught the higher subjects of law, medicine, and theology, but after a time the designations of doctor, master, and professor were used interchangeably, the usage differing in individual institutions (Rashdall, i, 19). The derivation of the designation of bachelor has been variously explained, but probably it comes from an old French word meaning youth or young man. Among its collateral meanings is that of apprentice in the craft guilds, and all of its connotations signify inferiority or immaturity. In the educational field the term bachelor was first used at the University of Paris, where it was applied to pupils of the masters of arts who were permitted to participate in a minor way in the teach...|$|R

By reducing the quantity of topics studied and increasing the conceptual depth, the curricular revision aims to move students toward greater grammatical proficiency.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} describes projects {{falling into}} two general programs. The first three chapters detail work {{centered around the}} peculiar small molecule cyclobutenone. A practical preparation of this previously inaccessible compound is reported. This allowed exploration of applied and academic questions. Cyclobutenone was seen to break from classical patterns due to its extreme inherent strain, polarization, and other factors. These unique properties were harnessed toward enhanced dienophilicity and endo directivity in Diels-Alder reactions. Intramolecular Diels-Alder (IMDA) reactions are described in the second chapter. Cyclobutenone and larger cycloalkenone substrates again diverged in reactivity and selectivity. Lewis acid catalysis reduced this gap to give high levels of endo addition across the series. This stereochemical information was then translated to trans hydrindene junctions by controlled fragmentation of erstwhile dienophile moieties. Observations within these two projects inspired the idea discussed in the third chapter. Here the groundwork is laid out for substitution of cyclobutenone to modulate its properties and carry functionality. In an early example, certain halogenation patterns are shown to further activate cyclobutenone as a dienophile, {{as well as provide}} a reactive handle to diversify the possible structures originating from a cyclobutenone core. The last chapter describes two total synthesis projects and their connection. A group of resveratrol-based natural products and analogs were prepared by branching from a <b>master</b> <b>intermediate.</b> Subsequently, a variant of this polyphenol intermediate was used to guide the route toward dalesconol A and B. These polyketides are potent immunosuppressants. A common synthetic strategy unifies these total syntheses, much as the cyclobutenone program is comprised of three related projects...|$|R

There are three classes: NOVICE (for {{beginner}} players), EXPERT (for <b>intermediate</b> players) and <b>MASTER</b> (for advanced players). For a total of fifteen tracks (twelve courses and three Bonus Games). To complete a course, player must complete three laps before time runs out. Every time a player completes a lap or passes through a Checkpoint, the countdown timer will extend. After the third lap is completed, all the time left will be taken to the next course. However, players can not carry more than 100 seconds. There are three rival vehicles for a player to compete against. If a player makes a vehicle he or she controls run off course into a water hazard, completely fill up the Damage meter and destroys it, run in fourth/last place or if the timer drops to zero, player loses a try and restarts the race on the same course he or she was on. If the player runs out of tries, the game is over. Bonus Games are the only courses in this mode that allows players to either play them or not. They are also the only courses in the game where players can earn extra tries, just in case if players often lost races and wanted to try a few more times.After EXPERT class has been cleared, MASTER class will be unlocked.|$|R
40|$|The {{expression}} of 51 known genes clustered in the flagellar regulon of Sinorhizobium meliloti is organized as a three-class hierarchy: class IA comprises the master regulatory genes, visN and visR; class II, controlled by VisNR, comprises flagellar assembly and motility genes; and class III comprises flagellin and chemotaxis genes requiring class II for expression. The {{expression of}} visN-visR is constitutive throughout growth, whereas that of class II and class III genes {{is limited to}} exponential growth. A new OmpR-like, 25 -kDa transcription factor, Rem, whose synthesis is confined to exponential growth, was shown to positively control swimming motility. No phosphorylation of the receiver domain of Rem was required for its activity. Gene expression in tester strains with known deficiencies placed the rem gene (class IB) below visN-visR (class IA) and above class II genes in the regulatory cascade. Footprinting analysis demonstrated that the Rem protein binds to class II gene promoters {{as well as to}} its own promoter, indicating that this protein is autoregulatory. An alignment of the Rem-protected DNA sequences revealed a conserved binding motif of imperfect tandem repeats overlapping a predicted − 35 promoter box by 3 bp. This new promoter was confirmed by mapping the transcription start site of a typical class II gene, flgB, 5 nucleotides downstream of the − 10 promoter box.
