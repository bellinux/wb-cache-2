40|$|Fiber {{fineness}} {{characteristics are}} important for yarn production and quality. In this paper, degummed bast fibers such as hemp, <b>flax</b> <b>and</b> <b>ramie</b> have been examined with the Optical Fiber Diameter Analyzer (OFDA 100 and OFDA 2000) systems for fiber fineness, {{in comparison with the}} conventional image analysis and the Wira airflow tester. The correlation between the results from these measurements was analysed. The results indicate that there is a significant linear co-relation between the fiber fineness measurement results obtained from those different systems. In addition, the mean fiber width and its coefficient of variation obtained from the OFDA 100 system are smaller than those obtained from the OFDA 2000 system, due to the difference in sample preparation methods. The OFDA 2000 system can also measure the fiber fineness profile along the bast fiber plants, which can be useful for plant breeding. <br /...|$|E

40|$|In this study, the {{microstructure}} of different natural plant fibers (flax, jute, ramie, and sisal fibers) {{were characterized by}} using low-voltage Scanning Electron Microscopy (LV-SEM). The LV-SEM observations indicated that jute and sisal fibers exhibit less variation {{in terms of the}} fiber cross-sectional area, internal lumen shape and size, and cell wall thickness in comparison to <b>flax</b> <b>and</b> <b>ramie</b> fibers. We find that this is also reflected in the tensile properties of the fibers. The tensile properties of single ramie fibers and their fracture behavior was investigated in detail. The stress-strain behavior showed two distinctive regimes. For linear curves, the tensile strength varies from 648 - 1086 MPa whereas nonlinear curves result in much lower values (177 - 452) MPa. This variation was linked to differences in {{the microstructure}} of the fibers. The LV-SEM of the tensile fracture surfaces of ramie fibers revealed details on the cell wall structure and its fracture behavior under tensile load. Moreover, the SEM images confirm that the collapse of the primary cell wall generally leads to a non-linear stress-strain curve for single ramie fibers...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{wash and}} wear finish of bast fabric was {{reported}} in this paper. The influence of various factors on wash and wear finish effect was studied by method of orthogonal experimentr. The result indicated that the proper range of concentration of finish was 80 - 100 g/L with catalyst MgCl 2 of 8 % relative to dose of finishing agent at curing temperature of 160 Â°C for 3 mins. The wrinkle recovery angle and breaking elongation percentage could be enhanced by pretreatment with NaOH liquor of 20 - 25 g/L. The performance of the wash and wear finish could be improved by finish with amino organosilicon. In the process of low formaldehyde wash and wear finish, the concentration of finish was a key parameter, dose of catalyst MgCl 2 and curing temperature were main parameters. 1 Intorduction Though bast fabric {{is a kind of}} natural and environmentally-friendly textile fabric with fine permeability, drape and air-cooling, its development and application have been limited to dress adornment for a long time because of their defect on wash and wear performance. The bast fiber is cellulose fiber and similar to cotton, but there are differences in component, structure and supermolecular structure. So, the behavior in treatment on bast fiber is different from cotton fiber [1].

40|$|The {{forecast}} of growing air transport {{in the upcoming}} decades faces the challenge of an increasing environmental impact. Aviation industry is working on promising technologies to mitigate this environmental impact. Lightweight design is a strong lever to lower the fuel consumption and, consequently, with it the emissions of aviation. High performance composites are a key technology to help achieve these aims thanks to their favourable combination of mechanical properties and low weight in primary structures. However, mainly synthetic materials such as petrol based carbon fibres and epoxy resins are used nowadays to produce composite in aviation. Renewable materials like bio-based fibres and resin systems offer potential environmental advantages. However, they have not {{found their way into}} aviation, yet. The reasons are reduced mechanical properties and, especially for the use of natural fibres, their flammability. Improvements of these shortcomings are under investigation. Therefore the application of bio-based and recycled materials in certain areas of the aircraft could be possible in the future. Good examples for applications are furnishings and secondary structures. The motivation for this paper is to give an overview of potential environmental properties by using such eco-materials in aviation. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a tool to calculate environmental impacts during all life stages of a product. The main focus is laid on the bio-fibres <b>flax</b> <b>and</b> <b>ramie,</b> recycled carbon fibres and bio-based thermoset resin systems. Furthermore an overview of environmental aspects of existing composite materials used in aviation is given. Generally, a lack of LCA results for the substitution of synthetic materials by bio-based/recycled composite materials in aviation applications has been identified. Therefore, available information from other transport areas, such as automotive, has been summarized. More detailed LCA data for eco-composite materials and technologies to improve their properties is important to understand potential environmental effects in aviation...|$|E

40|$|Bast fibres {{are long}} extraxylary cells which {{mechanically}} support the phloem {{and they are}} divided into xylan-and gelatinous-type, depending on the composition of their secondary cell walls. The former, typical of jute/ kenaf bast fibres, are characterized {{by the presence of}} xylan and a high degree of lignification, while the latter, found in tension wood, as well as <b>flax,</b> <b>ramie</b> <b>and</b> hemp bast fibres, have a high abundance of crystalline cellulose. During their differentiation, bast fibres undergo specific developmental stages: the cells initially elongate rapidly by intrusive growth, subsequently they cease elongation and start to thicken. The goal of the present study is to provide a transcriptomic close-up of the key events accompanying bast fibre development in textile hemp (Cannabis sativa L.), a fibre crop of great importance. Bast fibres have been sampled from different stem regions. The developmental stages corresponding to active elongation and cell wall thickening have been studied using RNASeq. The results show that the fibres sampled at each stem region are characterized by a specific transcriptomic signature and that the major changes in cell wall-related processes take place at the internode containing the snap point. The data generated also identify several interesting candidates for future functional analysis...|$|R

40|$|A {{comparison}} of dyeability and colorfastness characteristics of <b>ramie,</b> <b>flax,</b> <b>and</b> cotton yarns dyed with six direct dyes was made. When dyed {{in a common}} dyebath, the shade produced {{on each of the}} three fibers varied. Although the magnitude of difference varied among the dyes, there was consistently less difference between the shades produced on <b>ramie</b> <b>and</b> <b>flax</b> (mean &Delta;E = 2. 6) than between <b>ramie</b> <b>and</b> cotton (mean &Delta;E = 8. 7). Even when ramie had a lower actual dye content than either flax or cotton, its relative depth of shade (L-value) was higher. This can be attributed to optical effects arising from the comparatively large cross-sectional size of the fiber and its highly ordered structure. The colors produced on cotton were consistently brighter than those achieved on ramie or flax. This occurred because cotton, being a thinner fiber, contained more dye per volume fiber than <b>ramie</b> <b>and</b> <b>flax.</b> Little difference in colorfastness to laundering was seen among the three fibers. Although ramie {{has been used as a}} textile fiber for thousands of years in subtropical Asian countries, it has be-come commercially important elsewhere only recently.

In {{order to}} {{understand}} the basic performances of bamboo yarns, the tensile strength, abrasion resistance and hairiness of yarns are analyzed through the comparison of bamboo yarns, cotton yarns <b>and</b> <b>ramie</b> yarns. Bamboo yarns show a higher strength, a lower breaking elongation, a better abrasive resistance and an obvious hairiness.
