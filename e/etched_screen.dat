In all processes, the outer shape of the pin is stamped out from a sheet of steel, aluminum, copper, brass, or iron. In the case of cloisonne and soft enamel, the shape and the design are stamped out.|$|E

40|$|We {{built and}} {{characterized}} an optical system that emulates the optical characteristics of an 8 m-class telescope like the Very Large Telescope. The system contains rotating glass phase-screens to generate realistic atmosphere-like optical turbulence, as needed for testing {{multi-conjugate adaptive optics}} systems. In this paper we present {{an investigation of the}} statistical properties of two phase-screens etched on glass-plate surfaces, obtained from Silios Technologies. Those <b>etched</b> <b>screens</b> are highly transmissive (above 85 %) from 0. 45 to 2. 5 microns. From direct imaging, their Fried parameter r 0 values (0. 43 +- 0. 04 mm and 0. 81 +- 0. 03 mm, respectively, at 0. 633 microns) agree with the expectation to within 10 %. This is also confirmed by a comparison of measured and expected Zernike coefficient variances. Overall, we find that those screens are quite reproducible, allowing sub-millimetre r 0 values, which were difficult to achieve in the past. We conclude that the telescope emulator and phase-screens form a powerful atmospheric turbulence generator allowing systematic testing of different kinds of AO instrumentation.

40|$|We {{present a}} rapid {{low-cost}} process for fabrication of screen-printed carbon thick-film strain sensors with 0. 01 - 2 % strain resolution. The sensors {{are suitable for}} implantation and designed specifically for strain or fullness measurements of the skin and bladder, respectively. Thick-film carbon paste sensors are screen-printed using an <b>etched</b> brass <b>screen</b> onto polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and encapsulated by a second layer of PDMS. This method can quickly produce multilayered devices by superposition of different screen printable materials. Single strain gauge devices as well as arrayed elements have been fabricated and tested using a latex balloon model of a bladder...|$|R

For the single slot ring CSRR, two transmission dips are observed for the direction parallel to aperture at resonance whereas two enhanced transmission for the direction normal to the aperture. For double slot ring CSRR, the transmission coefficients appear more anisotropic. The results provided considerable {{insight into the}} electromagnetic response of CSRR and would be very helpful for developing new electronic devices such as filters...|$|R
40|$|Using {{standard}} {{semiconductor processing}} equipment, phase <b>screens</b> <b>etched</b> on glass-plate surfaces can simulate scaled-down 3 D atmo-spheric optical turbulence. With {{the advent of}} second generation astronomical adaptive op-tics (AO) systems like multi-conjugateAO, ground layer AO, ex-treme AO, multiple field of view AO, and multiple object AO, it {{is becoming more and}} more important to have a realistic 3 D turbulence simulation tool available in the laboratory. Such a tool provides repeatable optical turbulence and therefore well-defined atmospheric conditions. It can support the assembly, in-tegration, and verification phases of novel AO instrumentation so that AO performance can be verified before the instrument is attached to the telescope. An important parameter for the design of astronomical AO systems is the ratio D/r 0, where D is the telescope diameter an...|$|R
40|$|Analysis, design, fabrication, and {{experimental}} {{assessment of a}} symmetric three-phase free-piston Stirling engine system is discussed in this paper. The system is designed to operate with moderate-temperature heat input {{that is consistent with}} solar-thermal collectors. Diaphragm pistons and nylon flexures are considered for this prototype to eliminate surface friction and to provide appropriate seals. In addition, low loss diaphragm pistons, <b>etched</b> and woven-wire <b>screen</b> heat exchangers, and plastic flexures, as the main components of the system, are outlined. The experimental results are presented and compared with design analysis. Experiments successfully confirm the design models for heat exchanger flow friction losses and gas spring hysteresis dissipation. Furthermore, it is revealed that gas spring hysteresis loss is an important dissipation phenomenon for low-power Stirling engines and should be carefully addressed in design. Analysis shows that the gas hysteresis dissipation is reduced drastically by increasing the number of phases in a multiphase Stirling engine system. It is further shown that for an even number of phases, half of the engine chambers could be eliminated by utilizing a reversing mechanism within the multiphase system. The mathematical formulation and modal analysis of multiphase Stirling engine system are then extended to a system that incorporates a reverser. By introducing a reverser to the fabricated prototype, the system successfully operates in engine mode. The system proves its self-starting capability and validates the computed start-up temperature. �DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 3097274 �...|$|R
