5|$|According to the legend, the raskovnik could unlock any gate or padlock, {{regardless}} of its size, material or key. It could also uncover treasures buried in the ground: in Bulgarian beliefs, it could split {{the ground at the}} place where a treasure lay so that people could locate <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> <b>some</b> regions of Serbia, the treasure itself was a black man in chains who requested that a raskovnik be brought to him. The raskovnik would break the chains and the man would disappear into the ground {{to be replaced by a}} cauldron filled with gold coins. Other supernatural properties attributed to the herb by Bulgarians include the alchemic ability to transmute iron into gold, the more general ability to make the one who picked it forever happy or wealthy. In some interpretations, the raskovnik is a wonderful plant that makes true whatever its owner desires.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the moons}} {{discovered}} by the Voyager2 imaging team, only Puck was discovered early enough that the probe could be programmed to image <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> detail. Images showed that Puck has a shape of a slightly prolate spheroid (ratio between axes is 0.97±0.04). Its surface is heavily cratered and is grey in color. There are three named craters {{on the surface of}} Puck, the largest being about 45km in diameter. Observations with the Hubble Space Telescope and large terrestrial telescopes found water-ice absorption features in the spectrum of Puck.|$|E

5|$|The first British {{furnaces}} {{outside the}} Weald {{appeared during the}} 1550s, and many {{were built in the}} remainder of that century and the following ones. The output of the industry probably peaked about 1620, and was followed by a slow decline until the early 18th century. This was apparently because it was more economic to import iron from Sweden and elsewhere than to make <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> more remote British locations. Charcoal that was economically available to the industry was probably being consumed as fast as the wood to make it grew. The Backbarrow blast furnace built in Cumbria in 1711 has been described as the first efficient example.|$|E
5|$|Leopold, however, {{reneged on}} his {{humanitarian}} promises, and instead brutally exploited the locals {{and the land}} to gain what profit he could. Initially, the Congo Free State relied on exporting ivory to pay for its upkeep and to fund the Congo Arab war and Emin Pasha Relief Expedition in the Eastern Congo. As rubber became an important resource in the 1890s, it quickly surpassed ivory as a profitable export, which allowed the colony to become extremely profitable for the first time. Monopoly concessions to collect rubber in large areas of territory were sold to private companies, and the Force Publique, the state's private army, was used to force locals to collect <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> <b>some</b> cases, Congolese people who failed to meet their quota were killed or had one of their hands cut off. The system was immensely profitable, but {{the population of the}} Congo is thought to have been reduced by as many as ten million during the period that the colony was under Leopold's control.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to being featured in many Renaissance portraits {{by virtue of being}} the fashion of the day, the Italian cappuccio was of interest because the mazzocchio's shape made it a good subject for the developing art of perspective. The painter Paolo Uccello studied the perspective of the mazzocchio and incorporated <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> of his paintings (e.g. in The Counterattack of Michelotto da Cotignola at the Battle of San Romano).|$|E

25|$|This forest {{has been}} infested with several {{introduced}} plants. The cliffs and steep slopes of Mount Pitt supported {{a community of}} shrubs, herbaceous plants, and climbers. A few tracts of cliff top and seashore vegetation have been preserved. The rest of the island has been cleared for pasture and housing. Grazing and introduced weeds currently threaten the native flora, displacing <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> areas. In fact, there are more weed species than native species on Norfolk Island.|$|E
25|$|Spill (also {{known as}} bleed and leakage) is the {{occurrence}} in sound recording (particularly in close miking) and live sound mixing whereby sound {{is picked up}} by a microphone from a source other than that which is intended.

25|$|A bilayer of {{phospholipids}} {{makes up}} the membrane of cells that constitutes a barrier, containing everything within the cell and preventing compounds from freely passing into, and out of, the cell. Due to the selective permeability of the phospholipid membrane only specific compounds can pass through <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> <b>some</b> multicellular organisms they serve as a storage of energy and mediate communication between cells. Carbohydrates are more easily broken down than lipids and yield more energy to compare to lipids and proteins. In fact, carbohydrates are the number one source of energy for all living organisms.|$|E

25|$|Anal {{sex is a}} {{prevalent}} {{theme in}} yaoi, as nearly all stories feature <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> way.

Zanghellini notes that illustrations of anal sex almost always position the characters to face each other, rather than in the 'doggy style.' Zanghellini also notes that the uke rarely fellates the seme, but instead receives the sexual and romantic attentions of the seme.|$|E
25|$|It's All True: Welles did not {{originally}} want {{to direct}} this 1942 documentary on South America, but after its abandonment by RKO, {{he spent much}} of the 1940s attempting to buy the negative of his material from RKO, so that he could edit and release <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> form.

25|$|While Shakespeare closely {{followed}} Cinthio's tale in composing Othello, he departed from <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> details. In Cinthio's tale, for example, the ensign suffers an unrequited lust for the Moor's wife, Desdemona, which then drives his vengeance. Desdemona dies {{in an entirely}} different manner in Cinthio's tale; the Moor commissions his ensign to bludgeon her to death with a sand-filled stocking. In gruesome detail, Cinthio follows each blow, and, when she is dead, the Moor and his ensign place her lifeless body upon her bed, smash her skull, and then cause the cracked ceiling above the bed to collapse upon her, giving the impression the falling rafters caused her death.|$|E
