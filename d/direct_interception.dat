The liquid flow-field is described using the kinematic model proposed by Fan and Ahmadi (1995) combined with Lagrangian particle tracking.

40|$|The {{inertial}} impaction of Lycopodium spores on single wires lying transverse to {{the direction of}} flow has been studied. The equations of particle motion in a potential flow field have been modified for the case when Stokes' law is inapplicable. Solutions to the above equations have been obtained by digital computation. Rec, the Reynolds number based on cylinder diameter, varied from 4 to 240; particle trajectories in a flow field at Rec = 10 have been determined for inertia parameter K = 1, 2, 4, 6, and 10. Ten trajectories were developed for the above cases by the numerical stepwise method. Experiments were performed by depositing Lycopodium spores on adhesive-coated wires of various diameters and at different velocities. The weight of dust deposited was determined with a microbalance. The experimental conditions were:. Wire diameters: 345, 457, 1500 μ. Particle diameter: 35 μ. Air velocities: 20 - 250 cm/sec. Inertia parameter: 1 - 60. The particle was considered as a point mass in the theoretical analysis. But in the experiments the ratio of particle size to wire size was not negligible (rp/rc = 0 · 1) and hence the effect of finite size of particle on collection efficiency due to the <b>direct</b> <b>interception</b> effect has been estimated. The effect of particle size distribution on collection efficiency has also been estimated.

40|$|International audienceThe {{present study}} {{focuses on the}} {{inclusion}} behaviour near the liquid metal/slag interface. Inclusion turbulent deposition is investigated using direct numerical simulation of the liquid flow combined with Lagrangian particle tracking under conditions of one-way coupling. The interface is modelled as a non-deformable free-slip surface. Unsheared turbulence is generated by random forcing in a finite-height region parallel to the free-slip surface. In between, the turbulence diffuses toward the free surface. The inclusions are randomly introduced in the forcing region and tracked through the diffusion region up to the interface. In the particle dynamic equation, the buoyancy force, the Stokes drag, the pressure drag and the added mass are considered. Close to the interface, the hydrodynamic interactions (i. e. lubrication effects) between the inclusion and the free surface may {{be taken into account}} as well as the Van der Waals forces. Numerical simulations were performed with surface Reynolds numbers ranging from 68 to 235. The inclusion diameter varied between 10 - 5 m and 5. 10 - 5 m and the particle to liquid density ratio between 0. 5 and 1. For these sets of parameters, it appears that the inertia effects are very weak. The deposition of buoyant inclusions is controlled by sedimentation whereas for nonbuoyant inclusions, <b>direct</b> <b>interception</b> is the only deposition mechanism. In the latter case, the deposition velocity strongly depends on. It is shown that the deposition velocity made dimensionless by the free surface characteristic velocity scales as the inclusion diameter made dimensionless by the Kolmogorov length scale calculated at the free surface. Lastly, the effect of lubrication is examined: it can significantly reduce the <b>direct</b> <b>interception</b> contribution of the deposition velocity...|$|E

40|$|Surface-piercing {{vegetation}} often captures {{particles that}} flow {{on the water}} surface, where surface tension forces contribute to capture. Yet the physics of capillary capture in flow has not been addressed. Here we model the capture of floating particles by surface-piercing collectors at moderately low Reynolds numbers (Re < 10). We find a trade-off between the capillary force, which increases with the collector diameter, and the relative size of the meniscus, which decreases with the collector diameter, resulting in an optimal collector diameter of ~ 1 − 10 [*][*]mm that corresponds to the regime in which many aquatic plant species operate. For this diameter range the angular distribution of capture events is nearly uniform and capture can be orders of magnitude more efficient than <b>direct</b> <b>interception,</b> showing that capillary forces can be major contributors to the capture of seeds and particulate matter by organisms...|$|E
40|$|Accelerated electrons, {{which would}} lead to high thermal load of grids, have been {{suppressed}} in a high-current large hydrogen negative ion source. An aperture of the extraction grid is shaped as the secondary electrons generated on the grid aperture surface would be shielded against the acceleration electric field. The shaped aperture extraction grid works well to prevent the secondary electrons from leaking to the acceleration gap, compared with a straight aperture extraction grid. Although the strong magnetic field at the extraction grid also lowers the electron leakage downstream, the aperture shaping of the extraction grid is more effective for {{the suppression of the}} accelerated electrons. The acceleration efficiency, defined by the ratio of the negative ion current to the acceleration drain current, is improved to around 85 %. There remains the accelerated electrons generated in the negative ion neutralization by collision with the residual neutral molecules during the acceleration. The <b>direct</b> <b>interception</b> of the accelerated negative ions with the downstream grid is small.

40|$|The {{ability to}} control cell-surface {{interactions}} {{in order to achieve}} binding of specific cell types is a major challenge for microfluidic immunoaffinity cell capture systems. In the majority of existing systems, the functionalized capture surface is constructed of solid materials, where flow stagnation at the solid-liquid interface is detrimental to the convection of cells to the surface. We study the use of ultra-high porosity (99 %) nanoporous micro-posts in microfluidic channels for enhancing interception efficiency of particles in flow. We show using both modelling and experiment that nanoporous posts improve particle interception compared to solid posts through two distinct mechanisms: the increase of <b>direct</b> <b>interception,</b> and the reduction of near-surface hydrodynamic resistance. We provide initial validation that the improvement of interception efficiency also results in an increase in capture efficiency when comparing nanoporous vertically aligned carbon nanotube (VACNT) post arrays with solid PDMS post arrays of the same geometry.

40|$|International audienceIn a tree, the {{distribution}} of leaf inclination angles {{plays an important role}} in photosynthesis and water interception. We investigate here the effect of mechanical deformations of leaves due to wind or their own weight on this distribution. First, the specific role of the geometry of the tree is identified and shown to be weak, using models of idealized tree and tools of statistical mechanics. Then the deformation of individual leaves under gravity or wind is quantified experimentally. New dimensionless parameters are proposed, and used in simple models of these deformations. By combining models of tree geometry and models of leaf deformation, we explore the role of all mechanical parameters on the Leaf Inclination Angle Distributions.

30|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{underlying the}} influence of filament thickness on the filtering efficiency and life history of filter-feeding plankton remain unknown. Smetacek (2001) argues that planktonic evolution is governed by protection and that the shapes of plankton reflect defence responses to specific attack systems. Cerbin et al. (2013) suggested that the widening of the filaments of A. gracile is a defence mechanism against grazing. It is plausible that the wider filaments used in our experiment somehow impaired in a greater extent of the feeding process. Thicker filaments could reduce the effectiveness of such filtering processes and cause higher energetic costs for daphnids. The functioning mechanism of Daphnia’s filtration apparatus (mechanical sieving or <b>direct</b> <b>interception</b> of food particles) has been studied and discussed widely (Rubenstein and Koehl 1977; Gophen and Geller 1984; Gerritsen et al. 1988; Hartmann and Kunkel 1991; Koehl 1996). However, {{recent studies have shown}} that both mechanisms can occur together. This co-occurrence is closely related to the Reynolds number (Re) of the setulaes (for more detail, see Abrusan 2004). At a low Re, viscous forces dominate the flow. The filtering appendages act as paddles (Abrusan 2004) and the majority of water with suspended particles (including cyanobacterial filaments) flows tangentially {{to the surface of the}} filter screens (Gerritsen et al. 1988). Under such conditions, food gathering is predominantly based on <b>direct</b> <b>interception</b> (adhesion) rather than filtration (Rubenstein and Koehl 1977; Koehl 1996). Bednarska and Dawidowicz (2007) observed a reduction in the intersetal and intersetular distances on the third pair of the thoracic legs of Daphnia in the presence of C. raciborskii. According to these authors, the morphological responses of daphnids to cyanobacterial filaments seem to be adaptive for reducing the mechanical interference of cyanobacterial filaments during food collection. D. magna has one of the smallest meshes among the Anomopoda (Geller and Müller, 1981), and it seems unlikely that filaments clog the meshes in the filter combs. However, Nadin-Hurley and Duncan (1976) reported problems with swallowing wider algal filaments and observed that narrower filaments were transferred further into the guts, while wider filaments became stuck and crowded closely together in the mouth. We can speculate that thin and pliant filaments interfere with the filtering apparatus to a lesser extent. These filaments may be broken with less effort and thus ingested at lower energetic costs. This suggestion is supported by the results of Soares et al. (2009), who found that there were no differences between animals reared on feeds mixed with C. raciborskii and those grown on a diet of pure S. obliquus.|$|E
40|$|<b>Direct</b> <b>interception</b> of windblown cloud {{water by}} forests {{has been dubbed}} “occult deposition” because it {{represents}} a hydrological input that is hidden from rain gauges. Eddy correlation studies of this phenomenon have estimated cloud water fluxes to vegetation yet have lacked estimates of error bounds. This paper presents an evaluation of instrumental and methodological errors for cloud liquid water fluxes to put such eddy correlation measurements in context. Procedures for data acquisition, processing (including correction factors), and calibration testing of the particulate volume monitor (PVM) and forward-scattering spectrometer probe (FSSP) are detailed. Nearly 200 h of in-cloud data are analyzed for intercomparison of these instruments. Three methods of coordinate system rotation are investigated; the flux shows little sensitivity to the method used, {{and the difference between}} fluxes at different stations is even less sensitive to this choice. Side-by-side intercomparison of two PVMs and one FSSP leads to error bounds of 0. 01 – 0. 035 g m⁻³ on half-hour mean cloud liquid water content (relative to typical values of 0. 35 g m⁻³) and 2 – 3. 5 mg m⁻² s⁻¹ on the surface-normal liquid water flux (typical magnitude of 7 mg m⁻² s⁻¹ for these data), depending on which instruments are compared...|$|E

Data collected included precipitation, snowmelt, streamflow, meteorological data, and basin water samples. This data {{was used to evaluate}} the concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships, hydro graph separation, and to complete End-Member Mixing Analysis (EMMA) for the two major snowmelt events occurring in the 2000 / 2001 cold-season.

The hydrometric and geochemical data provided evidence that all water contributing to streamflow in UDCEW can be accounted for by cold-season precipitation occurring in the basin and that there is no contribution to streamflow by a regional groundwater source. The EMMA analysis showed that three end-members including snowmelt, and two soilwater sources, contribute to cold-season streamflow. The sampled soilwater end-members did not explain the observed streamwater chemistry, so a hypothesized soilwater end-member was suggested.

40|$|During {{the past}} few decades, {{different}} paradigms have emerged to describe the processes of stormflow generation in steep, forested headwater catchments. A hydrogeomorphic model has recently been developed, based on studies in Japan, to explain stormflow response. This conceptual model recognizes the close coupling of hillslope and channel hydrological processes and the unique contributions of geomorphic features in the catchment. The model {{can be used to}} assess the effects of various forest management practices, including protection forests, on stormflow generation. For the driest conditions, catchment water yield is very low and runoff occurs as saturated overland flow from the small riparian zone and via <b>direct</b> channel <b>interception.</b> For slightly wetter conditions, subsurface flow from the soil matrix augments stormflow. As wetness increases, two significant non-linear hydrologic responses occur: 1) a threshold response in geomorphic hollows (zero-order basins) where runoff initiates after an accumulation of shallow groundwater; and 2) self-organization and expansion of preferential flow pathways, which facilitate subsurface drainage. Increases in stormflow during periods of increasing antecedent wetness depend upon temporal and spatial linkages, and the unique hydrologic behavior of three components: riparian corridors, linear hillslopes and geomorphic hollows.
