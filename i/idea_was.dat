5|$|Starting in the mid-1950s, new car {{introductions}} in {{the fall}} once again became an anticipated event, as all dealers would reveal the models for the upcoming year each October. In this era before the popularization of computerization, {{the primary source of}} information on new models was the dealer. The <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> originally suggested in the 1930s by President Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Great Depression, as a way of stimulating the economy by creating demand. The <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> reintroduced by President Dwight Eisenhower for the same reasons, and this method of introducing next year's models in the preceding autumn lasted well into the 1990s.|$|E

40|$|GE is {{pioneering}} {{the development}} of market‐based methods for allocating research budget to internal projects. To be effective, a market for ideas must provide appropriate incentives {{for the creation of}} valuable ideas and it must result in sufficiently accurate evaluation of ideas. The main tenet behind GE’s <b>Idea</b> Market <b>is</b> that improvements in the evaluation of research ideas should foster incentives for idea creation. Indeed, idea creation and <b>idea</b> evaluation <b>are</b> complementary activities. For an <b>idea</b> to <b>be</b> successful, it is not enough that the <b>idea</b> <b>be</b> good. It also helps if the <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> recognized as good by those who evaluate it. As the evaluation process becomes more accurate, good <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> more likely to be funded. Thus, incentives for the creation of <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> enhanced when <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> evaluated more accurately. Consider first the incentives for the creation of new ideas. A key obstacle to the creation of <b>ideas</b> <b>is</b> the limited “appropriability ” of their benefits (see Arrow, 1962). The problem <b>is</b> that good <b>ideas</b> can <b>be</b> easily stolen. As a result, inventors might have little if any incentives to come up with good <b>ideas.</b> There <b>are</b> non‐market solutions to this market failure. For example, (open) science gives up on attempts to appropriate privately the benefits of ideas by making the ideas publicly available through the publication process. Creators of scientific <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> rewarded instead by the public recognition awarded through th...|$|R

5|$|After {{finishing}} {{work on the}} Spyro the Dragon series, Insomniac originally intended to launch a game codenamed I5 (Insomniac game #5) for the PlayStation 2. The developers, however, were never enthusiastic about it, and the <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> dropped after six months. Ratchet & Clank {{was based on an}} idea by Brian Hastings, which would feature a space-traveling reptile alien who would collect various weapons as he progressed through the game; Ratchet's final form was decided upon after Insomniac considered a space lizard with a tail and various terrestrial creatures, including dogs and rats; feline features stood out to the developers because of the associated sense of agility. Another early <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> to have a three small robots attached to Ratchet, which would perform different functions. However, Insomniac realized that having the robots was both complicated and created confusion about Ratchet's appearance, leading them to have only one robot, Clank.|$|E

50|$|Self-refuting {{ideas or}} self-defeating <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> <b>ideas</b> or {{statements}} whose falsehood {{is a logical}} consequence of the act or situation of holding them to <b>be</b> true.

For these reasons, none of the <b>ideas</b> below <b>are</b> unambiguously or incontrovertibly self-refuting. These <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> often used as axioms, which are definitions taken to be true (tautological assumptions), and cannot be used to test themselves, for doing so would lead to only two consequences: consistency (circular reasoning) or exception (self-contradiction).

Murray Hill President Bob Laurel bought the script from Webster in 1993, and sent it to Fox and other studios in 1994 but received no response and claimed the <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> copied by Kornfield, who was Fox's script reader.

Laurel died {{a few months after the}} verdict, before receiving any of the money. On appeal, the damages figure was lowered to $1.5 million, before the verdict itself was quashed in 2004 after a judge decided the <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> not stolen, as Fox had bought Kornfield's screenplay before he or anybody else at Fox had read Could This Be Christmas?.|$|E
