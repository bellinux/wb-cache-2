5|$|A {{concentrated}} photovoltaic thermal hybrid (CPVT) {{system is}} similar to a PVT system. It uses concentrated photovoltaics (CPV) instead of conventional PV technology, and combines <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> solar thermal collector.|$|E

5|$|A second {{attempt to}} gain the {{agreement}} of Militia colonels to the proposed amalgamation was made in late June, and was strongly opposed. All fourteen of the Militia representatives insisted that overseas service should be done by complete Militia battalions, rather than drafts sent to regular battalions. A third meeting, in October, proposed that the Militia join with the Volunteers as the senior element of the Territorial Force; this, too, was rejected. As both possible approaches {{for dealing with the}} Militia had been strongly opposed, the decision was taken to do away with it entirely and replace <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> newly created force, the Special Reserve, which would incorporate those elements of the Militia willing to be transferred.|$|E
5|$|A sequel titled All Star Pro-Wrestling II was {{released}} on November 22, 2001 for the PlayStation 2. It addressed the controls issue by replacing <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> new, more standard battle system, and included wrestlers from three real-life Japanese wrestling federations: New Japan Pro Wrestling, Pro Wrestling Noah, and Pro Wrestling Zero-One. The game also scored 31 out of 40 in Famitsu. A third installment, All Star Pro-Wrestling III {{was released}} by Square Enix on August 7, 2003 for the same platform. It included a create-a-wrestler feature.|$|E

5|$|A team of {{researchers}} discover remains of a crashed spaceship in the Arctic Circle, finding several humanoids with cybernetic implants frozen in the wreckage. Two bodies are taken to a nearby compound to be studied. The scientists marvel at the nanoprobes that begin to repair the long dead aliens. Suddenly one of the seemingly dead subjects attacks the scientists, assimilating them. Using scavenged wreckage to enhance the transport, they then escape into space, upgrading <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> faster than standard warp drive and weapons.|$|E
5|$|According to Dawlatshah, Abdollah-ibn-Tahir, an Arabicized Persian, and {{governor}} of Khorasan for the Abbasid caliphs, banned publication in Persian {{and by his}} order all the Zoroastrians were forced to bring their religious books to be thrown in the fire. As a result, many literary works written in Pahlavi script disappeared. During the Abbasid reign the Zoroastrians, {{for the first time}} became a minority in Iran. Nevertheless, there were instances of toleration during the Abbasid era, particularly under the reign of Al-Mu'tasim who flogged an imam and muezzin for destroying a fire-temple and replacing <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> mosque.|$|E
5|$|According to Human Rights Watch, the abdomens {{of three}} {{pregnant}} women were cut {{open and the}} foetus removed and thrown into a fire. In an incident that came to light in 2007, Suresh Dedawala (Richard) alias Langado was caught on camera in a Tehelka sting operation talking to Bajarangi about slitting the belly of pregnant Muslim Kausar Banu, removing her foetus and killing <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sword.|$|E

50|$|So {{called because}} {{in it the}} blank tiles are recycled. If a blank tile is played to {{represent}} a particular letter, a player before his turn {{can pick up the}} blank and replace it by the letter that it represents. For example, if the word STRETTa is on the board (<b>with</b> <b>a</b> blank A), the player may pick up the blank and replace <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> actual A. However, he cannot replace <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> E, I, or O to produce STRETTE, STRETTI, or STRETTO.|$|R
5|$|According to Ming Pao, {{family members}} of the victims were {{dissatisfied}} with the official investigation and held a sit-in protest, calling for a fair judgement. Some locals blamed the official rescue work by comparing <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> large emergency response exercise on a 330-meter building several days before, and the successful firefighting for a blaze at Shanghai World Financial Center in 2007. Others blamed an ineffective firefighting system for the high death toll, and were dissatisfied that they were not given more details about the fire.|$|E
5|$|After Desha was elected, Relief legislators, {{who held}} {{majorities}} {{in both houses}} of the General Assembly, attempted to remove the offending judges from office. Failing to achieve the needed two-thirds majority, the legislature passed a reorganization act abolishing the Court of Appeals and replacing <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> new court. Desha appointed justices favoring relief. The original court continued to claim authority as the court of last resort in the state; during {{what became known as the}} Old Court-New Court controversy, both courts operated simultaneously, with both claiming legitimacy. It was a politically tumultuous time.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the Russian Civil War {{the victorious}} Bolsheviks {{considered}} finishing Izmail, and possibly Borodino, to their original design. It would have taken at least two years to build all of Izmails turrets, even if enough guns had been available. Ten had been delivered by Vickers before the Revolution and one gun had been completed domestically in 1912, but the prospects that more guns could be purchased from Vickers or that the Soviets could make more were not promising, given the state of their heavy industry {{in the wake of the}} Civil War. Another problem was the complicated electrical system; it could not be completed under current conditions, and at least twenty months would be required to replace <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> simpler system.|$|E

5|$|Another {{way that}} machinima {{demonstrates}} intertextuality {{is in its}} tendency to make frequent references to texts, works, and other media just like TV ads or humorous cartoons such as The Simpsons might do. For example, the machinima series Freeman's Mind, created by Ross Scott, is filmed by taking a recording of Scott playing through the game Half Life as a player normally would and combining <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> voiceover (also recorded by Scott) to emulate an inner monologue of the normally voiceless protagonist Gordon Freeman. Scott portrays Freeman as a snarky, sociopathic character who makes frequent references to works and texts including science fiction, horror films, action movies, American history, and renowned novels such as Moby Dick. These references to works outside the game, often triggered by events within the game, are prime examples of the densely intertextual nature of machinima.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle's {{account of}} {{temperature}} regulation sought {{to explain how}} an animal maintained a steady temperature and the continued oscillation of the thorax needed for breathing. The system of regulation of temperature and breathing described in Youth and Old Age, Life and Death 26 is sufficiently detailed to permit modelling as a negative feedback control system (one that maintains a desired property by opposing disturbances to <b>it),</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> few assumptions such as a desired temperature to compare the actual temperature against.|$|E
5|$|As a point-and-click {{adventure}} game, {{the player}} controls Simon using the mouse. The iOS and Android versions feature touch-screen controls. Gameplay involves moving Simon around and interacting with objects and other characters. The player can make Simon perform actions such as giving an item to another character, talk to another character, {{and pick up}} (add to inventory), examine, use, move, consume, wear, or open or close an item. Some actions are binary: they involve two objects and the player sometimes, after telling Simon to use an item, needs to specify what to use <b>it</b> <b>with.</b> <b>A</b> map that enables Simon to instantly transport to a major landmark (if it has been discovered) is provided. The postcard is used to load, save, or quit the game.|$|E
