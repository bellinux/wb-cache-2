40|$|Online {{appendix}} to “Macroeconomic Effects of Disruptions in Global <b>Food</b> <b>Commodity</b> Markets: Evidence for the United States” This appendix {{documents the}} construction of a narrative series of exogenous global <b>food</b> <b>commodity</b> market shocks. More specifically, we rely on historical documents to identify episodes of changes in <b>food</b> <b>commodity</b> prices that were unrelated to the state of the economy, i. e. movements where the proximate causes were disturbances in <b>food</b> <b>commodity</b> markets. The series is constructed by reading FAO reports, newspaper articles (e. g. the Financial Times archive), disaster databases (e. g. EMDAT) and several other online sources (e. g. Google). The task is daunting given the global level of the analysis. There are continuously, many times even conflicting, events affecting <b>food</b> <b>commodity</b> markets somewhere in the world. We therefore only select episodes that fulfill the following criteria: 1. There has to be an event that is important enough to affect <b>food</b> <b>commodity</b> markets at the global level, such as weather shocks in a major food production region, or unantici- pated news on the volume of global food production (e. g. a sizable revision of expected agricultural production by the USDA). 2. The event should have an unambiguous significant effect on global <b>food</b> <b>commodity</b> prices. A shift in commodity prices is considered to be significant if either the quarterly change in <b>food</b> <b>commodity</b> prices or accumulated change over two subsequent quarters is at least one standard deviation different from the sample mean. 3. There should be no developments in the macroeconomy, alternative events or macroe- conomic news that may also have a recognizable impact on <b>food</b> <b>commodity</b> prices. For example, we exclude admissible food market events if there is simultaneously a signif- icant shift in crude oil prices (one standard deviation different from its sample mean), or in economic activity (e. g. a global or US recession). Put differently, we eliminate or minimize possible endogenous movements in <b>food</b> <b>commodity</b> prices to current or future fluctuations in the business cycle, i. e. the event in <b>food</b> <b>commodity</b> markets has to be the proximate cause of the price shift. All ambiguous cases are not selected as an episode. By applying these criteria to the historical records, we were able to identify 13 episodes that could reasonably be interpreted as major exogenous <b>food</b> <b>commodity</b> market disturbances that are unrelated to the state of the economy. 6 of these episodes are unfavorable food market disruptions, whereas we have detected 7 favorable shocks to <b>food</b> <b>commodity</b> markets. The remainder of this appendix motivates the selection of each episode. We also provide excerpts of articles and reports on which we based our motivation. Relevant quotes are marked in bold. Unless otherwise mentioned, changes in real <b>food</b> <b>commodity</b> prices are calculated as the change in the <b>food</b> <b>commodity</b> price index from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), deflated by US CPI. The real oil price series is the refiner acquisition cost of imported crude oil, deflated by US CPI.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of research is}} to analyze the volatility effect of <b>food</b> <b>commodity</b> prices and whether surging <b>food</b> <b>commodity</b> prices have spilled over into food inflation and total inflation with time series data through Box-Jenkins method for 12 <b>food</b> <b>commodity</b> prices. The results have proved that only beef price had high volatility effects and have asymmetric effect. While, soybeans, cooking oil, and food are vulnerable but did not have volatility effects. The change in <b>food</b> <b>commodity</b> prices are significant drive the inflation in the long-term although in the short-term insignificant. The government needs to overcome the full transmission effect of an exogenous shock and to introduce economic reform through investment, infrastructure, and markets for corn and egg for food inflation; eggs and peanuts for total inflation.

All of the trucks were issued passes and export papers by the AMGOT administration in Naples and Sicily, and some corrupt American army officers even made contributions of gasoline and trucks to the operation. According to Luke Monzelli, a lieutenant in the Carabinieri assigned to follow Genovese during his time in Italy: “Truckloads of food supplies were shipped from Vizzini to Genovese — all accompanied by the proper documents which had been certified by men in authority, Mafia members in the service of Vizzini and Genovese.” ...|$|E
2500|$|From 1974 to 2005 {{real food}} prices (adjusted for inflation) dropped by 75%. Food {{commodity}} prices were relatively stable after reaching lows in 2000 and 2001. Therefore, recent rapid food price increases are considered extraordinary. [...] A World Bank policy research working paper published in July 2008 {{found that the}} increase in <b>food</b> <b>commodities</b> prices was led by grains, with sharp price increases in 2005 despite record crops worldwide. From January 2005 until June 2008, maize prices almost tripled, wheat increased 127 percent, and rice rose 170 percent. The increase in grain prices was followed by increases in fats and oil prices in mid-2006. On the other hand, the study found that sugar cane production has increased rapidly, and it was large enough to keep sugar price increases small except for 2005 and early 2006. The paper concluded that biofuels produced from grains have raised food prices in combination with other related factors between 70 to 75 percent, but ethanol produced from sugar cane has not contributed significantly to the recent increase in <b>food</b> <b>commodities</b> prices.|$|E
