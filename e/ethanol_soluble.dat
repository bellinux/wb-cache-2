The colonies frequently {{appear to have a}} soft texture. The optimal growth range for this species is at 25 degrees Celsius. Cryptococcus adeliensis is incapable of fermentation, as is typical of the Cryptococcus species. This species is able to use sucrose, maltose, cellbiose, trehalose, raffinose, citrate, inositol <b>ethanol,</b> <b>soluble</b> starch, melezitose, xylitol, saccharate, salicin as well as many other compounds as sole carbon sources. Cryptococcus adeliensis is able to use nitrate, nitrite and cadaverine, a protein created when animals decay which produces the putrid smell associated with said decay, as sources of Nitrogen. This species forms starch as it grows. Cryptococcus adeliensis also grows on 0.01% cycloheximide.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} extract and fractionate phospholipids {{from the most}} potential source of phospholipids of the waste of palm oil processing i. e. palm pressed fiber, sludge, and spent bleaching earth (adsorbent). The extraction process was performed by using chloroform-methanol, followed by polar lipid separation by solubilization in choloroform (to eliminate neutral lipid) and methanol (to extract phospholipids). Fractionation was performed based on the solubility in ethanol and acetone. There were 5 phospholipd fractions obtained, i. e. crude phospholipids (without fractionation), <b>ethanol</b> <b>soluble,</b> ethanol insloluble, ethanol soluble-acetone soluble, and ethanol soluble-acetone insoluble fractions. Each fraction was characterized for phospholipid composition and fatty acid profile. The result showed that palm pressed fiber had the highest content of phospholipids of 10, 222. 19 ppm. Extraction and separation of phospholipids from palm pressed fiber produced phospholipids with a purity of 61. 67 %. Phospholipids found in palm pressed fiber were phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidyletanolamin (PE), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), diphosphatidylglyerol (DPG), and phosphatidic acid (PA), while the impurities consisted of fatty acids and neutral lipids. Oleic acid is the most dominant fatty acid ini crude palm pressed fiber phospholipids. Fractionation increased the purity of phospholipids. Different phospholipids fractions showed different phospholipid composition and fatty acid profile. <b>Ethanol</b> <b>soluble</b> fraction had more PI, PC, PG, and PA, but less PE and DPG as compared to crude phospholipids. The ratio of PC to PE also increased after ethanol fractionation.

As some properties of brain endothelial cells are modulated by underlying astrocytes, the effect of ethanol on cerebral microvasculature might be indirect and mediated by astrocytes. To analyse this question, we added to rat brain-derived endothelial cells (rbEC) in culture either only ethanol (0, 15 and 150 mM) or <b>ethanol</b> conjointly with <b>soluble</b> factors secreted by astrocytes. Alternatively, astrocytes were exposed to ethanol and the medium was added to rbEC. The effects of treatments were evaluated on cell growth and expression of specific proteolytic markers of rbEC. The experiments showed that while the addition of ethanol alone to rbEC increased the expression of gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase and cell growth following an initial toxic effect, the most significant effects were seen when ethanol was added to rbEC together with astrocytic factors or when medium conditioned by astrocytes exposed to ethanol was added to rbEC. In particular, the expression of angiotensin converting enzyme in endothelial cells was dose-dependently increased. These results indicate that the hypertensive and toxic effects of ethanol are mediated by <b>ethanol</b> and <b>soluble</b> factor(s) secreted by astrocytes and dependent on the expression of angiotensin converting enzyme in the brain endothelium.

Filter-binding assays revealed that cell membranes bound maltose with high affinity. Metabolic labeling of T. ethanolicus maltose-grown cells with [14 C]palmitic acid showed that this protein was posttranslationally acylated. A maltose-binding protein was purified by using an amylose resin affinity column, and the binding constant was 270 nM. Since maltase activity was found only in the cytosol of fractionated cells and unlabeled glucose did not compete with radiolabeled maltose for uptake in whole cells, it appeared that maltose was transported intact. In whole-cell transport assays, the affinity for maltose was approximately 40 nM. Maltotriose and α-trehalose competitively inhibited maltose uptake in transport assays, whereas glucose, cellobiose, and a range of disaccharides had little effect.
