Cavour dominated debate in Parliament but is criticized for the controversial methods he used while Prime Minister, including excessive use of emergency powers, employing friends, bribing some newspapers while suppressing others, and rigging elections, though these were fairly common practices for the time. The national debt soared {{by a factor of}} six because of his heavy spending on modernizing projects, especially railways, and building up the army and navy. When he became Prime Minister Piedmont had just suffered a major defeat by Austria, but when he died, Victor Emmanuel II ruled a state five times as large, which dominated Italy and ranked among Europe's great powers.|$|E

Ho Feng-Shan the Chinese Consul-General in Vienna in 1939, defied orders from the Chinese ambassador in Berlin to issue Jews with visas for Shanghai. John Rabe a German member of the Nazi Party likewise saved thousands of Chinese from massacre by the Japanese military at Nanking. The White Rose German student movement against the Nazis declared in their 4th leaflet: [...] "We will not be silent. We are your bad conscience. The White Rose will not leave you in peace!"

2500|$|The {{day after}} rising to power on December 2, 1990, Idriss Déby {{suspended}} the 1989 constitution.

The Charter, while if it gave vast if not exorbitant powers to the presidency, assured fundamental freedoms and rights, including the <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> and of association, {{the freedom of the}} press, the free movement of persons and property, the right to own property and the individual and collective freedoms in the frame of a pluralist democracy. The Charter also prohibited magistrates, men of the military and security services from being members of any party. The Charter also attempted to avoid a return of warlordism and sectarian politics, that had long plagued Chad: article 5 demanded parties [...] "to shun intolerance, tribalism, regionalism, religious discrimination and xenophobia and incitement to hatred, and the resource [...] violence in all its forms", while article 6 forbade parties [...] "to set up military or paramilitary organizations; to reconstitute into political parties any erstwhile politico-military bodies". To weaken tribalism, it was also added that to register, parties would need at least three members taken from each of ten prefectures.
