40|$|A tax {{competition}} model {{is presented to}} investigate the effects of tax <b>havens</b> on the public good provision. We show that when countries facing a rise in tax <b>havens</b> change their tax enforcement strategies in response, the existence of tax <b>havens</b> {{may result in a}} higher level of equilibrium public good provision as compared to the case with no tax <b>havens.</b> Accordingly, tax <b>havens</b> could be welfare-enhancing for non-haven countries. This result offers a possible explanation for the recent empirical evidence that the corporate tax revenues in high-tax countries have actually increased with the growth in the flow of FDI to tax <b>havens.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} tax {{competition}} {{framework in which}} some jurisdictions, called tax <b>havens,</b> are parasitic on the revenues of other countries, and these countries use resources {{in an attempt to}} limit the transfer of tax revenue from capital taxation to the <b>havens.</b> We demonstrate that the full or partial elimination of tax <b>havens</b> would improve welfare in non-haven countries. We also demonstrate that the smaller countries choose to become tax <b>havens,</b> and we show that the abolition of a sufficiently small number of the relatively large <b>havens</b> leaves all countries better off, including the remaining <b>havens.</b> We argue that these results extend to the case where there are also taxes on wage income that involve administrative and compliance costs.

5|$|By 1900, {{the lumber}} {{industry}} had declined, and the city's economic base rested on other industries, including a furniture factory, a paper mill, a fire brick plant, and a silk mill. In 1938, the Piper Aircraft Corporation, {{maker of the}} Piper Cub and other light aircraft, moved its production plant to Lock <b>Haven.</b> It remained one of the city's biggest employers until the 1980s, when, after major flood damage and losses related to Hurricane Agnes in 1972, it moved to Florida. The loss of Piper Aircraft contributed to an unemployment {{rate of more than}} 20% in Lock <b>Haven</b> in the early 1980s, though the rate had declined to about 9% by 2000. Another large plant, the paper mill that had operated since the 1880s in Castanea Township, closed in 2001.

Around 1950, the state highway followed Highland Avenue south from US40 to Eastern Avenue. MD150 was moved to Kresson Street, Lombard Street, and Ponca Street, which met Eastern Avenue just west of its present junction, in 1960. Around 1963, <b>Haven</b> Street and Kresson Street were converted to a one-way pair, with <b>Haven</b> Street carrying eastbound traffic south and Kresson Street handling westbound traffic toward US40. The portion of Lombard Street between <b>Haven</b> and Kresson was added to MD150; the state highway was also extended north on <b>Haven</b> and Kresson to Monument Street, then east along Monument Street to MD150's new western terminus at US40 at the U.S. Highway's underpass of CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision. This convoluted path was ameliorated around 2002 when the highway was shortened to its present course in East Baltimore.|$|E

40|$|Tax <b>havens</b> have {{attracted}} increasing attention from policy-makers in recent years. This paper {{provides an overview}} of {{a growing body of research}} that analyses the consequences and determinants of the existence of tax-haven countries. For instance, recent evidence suggests that tax <b>havens</b> tend to have stronger governance institutions than comparable non-haven countries. Most importantly, tax <b>havens</b> provide opportunities for tax planning by multinational corporations. It is often argued that tax <b>havens</b> erode the tax base of high-tax countries by attracting such corporate activity. However, while tax <b>havens</b> host a disproportionate fraction of the world's foreign direct investment (FDI), their existence need not make high-tax countries worse off. It is possible that, under certain conditions, the existence of tax <b>havens</b> can enhance efficiency and even mitigate tax competition. Indeed, corporate tax revenues in major capital-exporting countries have exhibited robust growth, despite substantial FDI flows to tax <b>havens.</b> Copyright 2008, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R
