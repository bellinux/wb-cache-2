40|$|Advances in fire science {{over the}} past 40 years have offered the {{potential}} for developing technically sound alternative temperature-time curves for use in evaluating fire barriers for areas where fire exposures {{can be expected to}} be significantly different than the ASTM E- 119 standard temperature-time exposure. This report summarizes the development of the ASTM E- 119, standard temperature-time curve, and the efforts by {{the federal government and the}} petrochemical industry to develop alternative fire <b>endurance</b> <b>curves</b> for specific applications. The report also provides a framework for the development of alternative curves for application at nuclear power plants. The staff has concluded that in view of the effort necessary for the development of nuclear power plant specific temperature-time curves, such curves are not a viable approach for resolving the issues concerning Thermo-Lag fire barriers. However, the approach may be useful to licensees in the development of performance-based fire protection methods in the future...|$|R
40|$|Axles and shafts are {{of prime}} {{importance}} concerning {{safety in the}} transportation industry and railway in particular. Design rules for axles and shafts are mainly based on <b>endurance</b> <b>curves</b> for the material used according to the established standards and procedures. Recently, the knowledge of fatigue crack growth under typical loading conditions of axles and shafts with rotating bending and steady torsion is being object of research and industrial studies in order to apply damage tolerance concepts, mainly for maintenance purposes. The effect of a steady torsion on fatigue crack growth under rotating bending is focused in this paper. While axles and shafts in the transportation industry are traditionally designed on steels, the need for weight reduction due to fuel economy and eco-design constraints, lightweight materials must be considered for these applications. In this study, fatigue crack growth on rotating bending axles and shafts with or without an applied steady torsion is presented. Fracture mechanics approaches are {{used to analyze the}} results based on Stress Intensity Factors developed for bending and torsion in shafts and show fatigue crack growth retardation when steady torsion is applied. Fractographic observations using SEM are presented and helped to explain the fatigue crack growth retardation observed when steady torsion is applied to rotating bending. Results are compared for the same loading conditions on steels and relevant differences on fatigue crack growth are commented...|$|R
40|$|Phase Change Memory {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{promising}} emerging Non-Volatile Memory technology thanks to fast writing operations, long endurance and very good radiation hardness. Although a relevant effort is still being put on design optimization and material analysis, the PCM technology has today reached a significant level of maturity so that test chips containing multimegabit arrays of cells are commonly available for electrical characterization purposes. As a result, a significant amount of statistical information can be provided to the reliability/cell design engineer. The analysis of memory arrays allows the identification of additional/unexpected features which, otherwise, would be difficult to be induced from the analysis of single memory cells, being the actual behavior of the array much more complex and statistical in nature. In this talk we present experimental results collected on array of PCM cells whose analysis allowed the identification of new interesting features of the PCM technology. A physical interpretation of the observed phenomena will be suggested and new models will be presented. The dynamical behavior of an array during both writing operations (SET and RESET) will be described first. Afterwards, we will focus on the SET (erasing) operation where most of the interesting features have been observed: the statistical nature of the erasing curve, the observation of a delay time (or time to shunt formation), the presence of a Random Telegraph Signal on the SET <b>endurance</b> <b>curves.</b> All these features seem to be consistent with a filamentation picture of the crystallization process and, accordingly, we developed a new erasing model which has been successfully used for data analysis. A comparison between the suggested model and what has already been proposed in literature will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|Uncertainty in {{structural}} and machine elements fatigue arises from two main sources. One source {{resides in the}} nature of fatigue damage mechanism occurring in engineering materials and the other source sterns from the random nature of operational loading. Under repeated loading, fatigue damage starts at an atomic level, follows through crystalline to microstructure, and appears as macroscopic crack growth damage. This source of uncertainty is evinced by the statistical scatter of fatigue endurance or fatigue strength in tests conduced under virtual identical (standard) conditions. The probabilistic description of scatter arising from fatigue damage mechanism encounters both analytical and computational difficulties. For the purpose of engineering analysis a simplified method is presented in this chapter based on the concept of isoprobable <b>endurance</b> <b>curves,</b> i. e., Wöhler curves associated with a stated probability of failure (Section 2). Under complex varying loading, fatigue analysis requires phenomenological cumulative damage criteria. Both linear (Miner) and a new sequential nonlinear fatigue damage criterion are presented in a probabilistic format (Section 3). The uncertainty source associated with the random nature of operational loading is treated in terms of probabilistic distribution laws of the stress intensity acting in the area where fatigue damage is concentrated, essentially at stress risers (Section 4). Accounting for the both sources of uncertainty an engineering assessment rationale for fatigue endurance prediction is developed. This methodology is now supported by FATDAM, a comprehensive computer code (Section 5). Analytical reliability methods (Section 6) are combined with the basic theory of macroscopic crack propagation (Section 7). This analytical developments accounts in a mean sense for the fatigue crack growth uncertainty. A judicious merge of Monte Carlo simulation of material fatigue crack growth characteristics with the analytical fatigue, reliability methods has been incorporated in FATSIM computer program. Future trends in structural fatigue uncertainty management follow the path of integrating advanced analytical methods of reliability theory with structural materials and field research in the framework of the ever increasing power of computing facilities...|$|R
40|$|In this study, a {{technology-oriented}} simplified mechanical {{fatigue testing}} approach for aluminium heavy wire bonds {{as well as}} first experimental results are presented. In the test setup, bonding wires were displacement-controlled loaded with different amplitudes at room temperature and the corresponding cycles to failure were experimentally determined. Loop geometries were varied in a technological meaningful range. The experimentally determined <b>endurance</b> <b>curves</b> show a strong influence of the bonding geometry on the lifetime of the bonding wires. In addition to testing, a three dimensional finite element model of the different bonding wire geometries was developed in order to quantify the local deformation situation at the failure site in terms of equivalent strain. The global mechanical p roperties used for the simulations were determined by tensile tests of unprocessed bonding wires. The experimental results in terms of number of cycles to failure could be represented {{as a function of}} the change in equivalent strain at the heel for the different bond loop geometries. Using a common double-logarithmic endurance plot, the results for the different bond loop geometries could be approximated by a linear dependency. This result is in accordance with the expectation that a Coffin-Manson approach can be applied to predict the life time of the aluminium wire bonds. From these results, it can be concluded that the experimental testing approach and the applied simulation model is applicable to understand the effect of different bonding loop geometries on the number of cycle to failu re. For a more generalized understanding, it has to be taken into consideration that the mechanical properties close to the heel were affected by the bonding process prior to fatigue loading. In form of a preliminary study, it is shown that spherical indentation testing on cross sections of the bonded wires provides a useful methodical approach to characterize these variations and to extract the local material properties for further expanded modelling...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work is to {{investigate}} on the mechanical and microstructural properties of dissimilar 2024 and 7075 aluminium sheets joined by friction stir welding (FSW). The two sheets, aligned with perpendicular rolling directions, have been successfully welded; successively, the welded sheets have been tested under tension at room temperature in order to analyse the mechanical response {{with respect to the}} parent materials. The fatigue <b>endurance</b> (S–N) <b>curves</b> of the welded joints have been achieved, since the fatigue behaviour of light welded sheets is the best performance indicator for a large part of industrial applications; a resonant electro-mechanical testing machine load and a constant load ratio RZsmin/smaxZ 0. 1 have been used at a load frequency of about 75 Hz. The resulted microstructure due to the FSW process has been studied by employing optical and scanning electron microscopy either on ‘as welded’ specimens and on tested specimen after rupture occurred...|$|R
40|$|Almost all the {{published}} studies on container handle positions {{have used the}} psychophysical, physiological, and biomechanical criteria to evaluate the best handle locations on container. The primary intent {{of this investigation was}} to determine if force <b>endurance</b> relationship <b>curves</b> could be used as criterion for comparing the handle positions. Ten subjects participated in a factorial experiment involving four handle positions (2 / 2, 3 / 7, 8 / 8, and 6 / 8), and four levels of exertion (25 %, 50 %, 75 %, and 100 % of maximum lifting capacity). On any treatment condition, the subjects held the box till their endurance limit. The endurance time and the rate of perceived exertion (RPE) were the dependent measures. For the RPE, it was observed that the asymmetric position 6 / 8 was the best. Similarly the handle position 6 / 8 had the longest endurance as observed by a third order polynomial fit. The differences among the handle position were consistent across all levels and exertions tested. Further, it appears that the maximum lifting capacity is closer to the grip strength of the non-dominant hand...|$|R
5000|$|In {{preparation}} for the 1887 season, Baldwin joined Chicago during spring training in Hot Springs, Arkansas. Though in March 1887, based on reports from his previous seasonal performance, Baldwin [...] "expected to rank next to John Clarkson" [...] among Chicago's pitchers, in April, The Sporting News reported Baldwin [...] "was regarded in Chicago as little better than a failure". On May 2, Baldwin made his MLB debut against the Indianapolis Hoosiers in a 9-1 Chicago loss. Later in the month, Baldwin held the Boston Beaneaters to one run in a 3-1 Chicago victory, part of a week in which Baldwin's development [...] "surprised" [...] a writer for The Post, who discounted the earlier evaluation of Baldwin as a failure. In June, a correspondent for The Clipper complimented Baldwin on his <b>endurance</b> and <b>curves,</b> while an Oshkosh Daily Northwestern writer called him the [...] "swiftest pitcher in the National League". Baldwin finished the season at an 18-17 win-loss record, with 164 strikeouts and 122 walks over 334 innings pitched, as Chicago finished 71-50, third in the NL. By December, Baldwin had re-signed with the club.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on the fatigue {{behaviour}} of aluminium alloy welded joints, which can represent points of weakness in the ship structure. The traditional methods of fatigue assessment of welded joints have some limitations, and are extremely time consuming. In order to overcome these difficulties, the Risitano's method, based on thermographic analysis, has been applied to predict the fatigue behaviour of welds. Experimental tests have been carried out to assess and compare the fatigue capability (S-N <b>curves,</b> <b>endurance</b> limits) of different welded joints, obtained by means of Friction Stir Welding (FSW) and Metal Inert Gas welding (MIG). Fatigue predictions obtained resorting to the Thermographic Method (TM) show a good agreement with those derived from the traditional procedure. Thus, TM proves to be a powerful tool also for the characterization of the mentioned kind of welded joints...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of localized muscle fatigue has classically {{been described by}} the nonlinear intensity - <b>endurance</b> time (ET) <b>curve</b> (Rohmert, 1960; El Ahrache et al., 2006). These empirical intensity-ET relationships have been well-documented and vary between joint regions. Xia and Frey Law (2008) previously proposed a three-compartment biophysical fatigue model, consisting of compartments (i. e. states) for active (MA), fatigued (MF), and resting (MR) muscle, to predict the decay and recovery of muscle force. However the model {{had yet to be}} validated for static or intermittent isometric tasks. The purpose of this thesis was to provide validation to the biophysical model. The first goal of this thesis was to determine optimal model parameter values, fatigue (F) and recovery (R), which define the 2 ̆ 2 flow rate 2 ̆ 2 between muscle states and to evaluate the model 2 ̆ 7 s accuracy for estimating expected intensity - ET curves. Using a grid-search approach with modified Monte Carlo simulations, over 1 million F and R permutations were used to predict the maximum ET for sustained isometric tasks at 9 intensities ranging from 10 - 90...|$|R

For the later cycles, τ_T increased-not always as the hole size decreased, and their relations were expressed in the τ_ｗ-χ curves. The more the prestrain ε, the higher the level of the curve. The bottom of the endurance limit τ_ｗ lay for the diameter ratio δ/d≒ 0. 2 〜 0. 3. 3) The crack propagation was of Frost and Dugdale type as was also the case of the rotary bending and push-pull fatigue as well. 4) For the phenomena about the hardness, as the cycle ratio N/N_F increased, H_V increased by ε＝ 0 ， 2 ％ from the early cycle or after a slight decrease, and decreased by ε＝ 14 ％ from the early cycle or after a slight increase. 5) The non-opening ratio i for N/N_F＝ 0. 6 〜 0. 7 levelled higher in the order of ε＝ 0, 2, 14...|$|R
