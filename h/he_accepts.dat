Jenna and Tracy are plagued by erotic dreams involving Kenneth, and to stop having them, they decide to stay awake.

5|$|Henry's {{force has}} been {{variously}} estimated at between 5,000 and 8,000 men, his original landing force of exiles and mercenaries having been augmented by the recruits gathered in Wales and the English border counties (in the latter area probably mustered chiefly by the Talbot interest), and by deserters from Richard's army. Historian John Mackie believes that 1,800French mercenaries, led by Philibert de Chandée, formed {{the core of}} Henry's army. John Mair, writing thirty-five years after the battle, claimed that this force contained a significant Scottish component, and this claim is accepted by some modern writers, but Mackie reasons that the French would not have released their elite Scottish knights and archers, and concludes that there were probably few Scottish troops in the army, although <b>he</b> <b>accepts</b> the presence of captains like Bernard Stewart, Lord of Aubigny.|$|E

5|$|If <b>he</b> <b>accepts,</b> and {{is already}} a bishop, he {{immediately}} takes office. If {{he is not a}} bishop, however, he must be first consecrated as one before he can assume office. If a priest is elected, the Cardinal Dean consecrates him bishop; if a layman is elected, then the Cardinal Dean first ordains him deacon, then priest, and only then consecrates him as bishop. Only after becoming a bishop does the pope-elect take office. These functions of the Dean are assumed, if necessary, by the sub-Dean, and if the sub-Dean is also impeded, they are assumed by the senior cardinal-bishop in attendance. In 2005 the Dean himself—Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger—was elected pope. In 2013, the Dean and sub-Dean were not in attendance (over the age limit), and these functions were assumed by Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re.|$|E
5|$|Imelda {{also managed}} to {{convince}} Fernando Lopez to accept the vice-presidential nomination along with presidential candidate Ferdinand Marcos. She first invited Lopez to personally meet with her in his suite. Lopez accepted the invite but preferred {{to talk with her}} in her suite instead. To persuade Lopez, her methods include appealing to Lopez's sympathy by telling him the struggles that she and Ferdinand faced during the campaign for Ferdinand's nomination and how she feels being abandoned by Lopez. Lopez refused multiple times until Imelda cried in front of him. Imelda then proceeded to hand him and make him sign a document stating that <b>he</b> <b>accepts</b> the nomination as the Nacionalista vice-presidential candidate.|$|E
5|$|In some {{adaptations of}} the Ramayana, other {{characters}} also use surrogates to save themselves from Ravana. A Tamil text narrates how Ravana once asks for Parvati as boon {{from her husband}} Shiva, however Vishnu – disguised as a sage – deludes Ravana into believing Shiva granted him an illusionary Parvati. Ravana entrusts Parvati to Vishnu and mediates again to compel Shiva {{to give him the}} real Parvati. This time, Shiva gives an illusionary Parvati, which <b>he</b> <b>accepts</b> as the real one and returns to Lanka with her. In the Malay Ramayana, Ravana sets his eyes on Rama's mother, however she transforms a frog into her image and sends this surrogate to be Ravana's wife.|$|E
