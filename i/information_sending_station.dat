50|$|Transmission in {{synchronous}} {{frames of}} 450ms. Three characters are transmitted by <b>Information</b> <b>Sending</b> <b>Station</b> (ISS). Takes 210 milliseconds. The ISS then waits 240 ms for a response. Information Receiving Station (IRS) receives the three characters and checks that they each have 4 marks and 3 spaces. If they do, then the IRS transmits an acknowledgement. If they don't, then the IRS requests retransmission. At {{the beginning of}} the next frame, the ISS either retransmits the last 3 characters or the next three characters.|$|E
5000|$|Acknowledgement (ACK) frame: After {{receiving}} a data frame, the receiving <b>station</b> will <b>send</b> an ACK frame to the <b>sending</b> <b>station</b> if no errors are found. If the <b>sending</b> <b>station</b> doesn't receive an ACK frame within a predetermined period of time, the <b>sending</b> <b>station</b> will resend the frame.|$|R

50|$|Interruptions or break-ins are {{initiated}} by receiving stations momentarily depressing their telegraph key while the <b>sending</b> <b>station</b> is actively <b>sending</b> Morse code, thus generating a short interrupting signal which is {{heard by the}} <b>sending</b> <b>station</b> between its own signals. In practice usually only a single dot is required to initiate a break-in.|$|R
50|$|Because {{long wave}} signals can travel very long distances, some radio amateurs and shortwave {{listeners}} {{engage in an}} activity called DXing. DXers attempt to listen in to far away transmissions, and they will often send a reception report to the <b>sending</b> <b>station</b> {{to let them know}} where they were heard. After receiving a report, the <b>sending</b> <b>station</b> may mail the listener a QSL card to acknowledge this reception.|$|R
50|$|In practice, many skilled {{operators}} do {{not bother}} to open {{a conversation with the}} preliminary opening QSK assertion or QSK query protocols, instead merely attempting to interrupt a <b>sending</b> <b>station</b> by tapping their telegraph key while listening between the signals (dots and dashes) for what happens next. If the <b>sending</b> <b>station</b> pauses when interrupted each party automatically knows the other is using QSK operation and then the two stations immediately start using the following QSK interrupt and turn over protocol with no further ado.|$|R
50|$|Since not all Morse code radio {{stations}} are equipped for QSK operation, <b>sending</b> <b>stations</b> equipped for QSK operation will often open a Morse conversation by sending the three letter group QSK (e.g. the operator will assert QSK) during an initial (opening) Morse code transmission to alert receiving <b>stations</b> that the <b>sending</b> <b>station</b> {{has the ability}} to listen between signals and that the receiving station can interrupt, or break-in, on the <b>sending</b> <b>station</b> at will. Conversely a station may query another Morse code station's QSK capability by sending the QSK signal followed by a question mark. The query QSK? asks if the receiving station has full break-in capability. If a receiving station is equipped for QSK operation the receiving operator will respond to the query QSK? with the assertion QSK indicating that the station has QSK capability. Subsequently, the two stations can then utilize the fluid and efficient Morse code conversational QSK protocols outlined in the following paragraphs.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} the formal modelling of {{medium access control}} in nonbeacon-enabled IEEE 802. 15. 4 wireless personal area networks with probabilistic timed automata supported by the PRISM probabilistic model checker. In these networks, the devices contend for the medium by executing an unslotted {{carrier sense multiple access}} with collision avoidance algorithm. In the literature, a model of a network which consists of two <b>stations</b> <b>sending</b> data to two different destination stations is introduced. We have improved this model and, based on it, we propose two ways of modelling a network with an arbitrary number of <b>sending</b> <b>stations,</b> each having its own destination. We show that the same models are valid representations of a star-shaped network with an arbitrary number of <b>stations</b> which <b>send</b> data to the same destination station. We also propose how to model such a network if some of the <b>sending</b> <b>stations</b> are not within radio range of the others, i. e. if they are hidden. We present some results obtained for these models by probabilistic model checking using PRISM...|$|R
