Introduction Computer aided image analysis systems have recently been introduced in histopathology (see for example [1] [2]). One goal is to utilize the computer as a quantitative assessment tool to produce more accurate and more objective results as compared to manual assessments. However, the methods reported in the above cited works still require human expertise and skill to evaluate specimen. Thus, like the purely manual methods, but to a lesser extent, they induce inter [...] and intraobserver variation errors.

40|$|Abstract in Undetermined A {{family of}} {{iterative}} receivers is evaluated {{in terms of}} complexity and performance for {{the case of an}} uplink multi-user (MU) multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) system. The transmission over block fading channels is considered. The analyzed class of receivers is performing channel estimation inside the iterative <b>detection</b> <b>loop,</b> which has been shown to improve estimation performance. As part of our results we illustrate the ability of this type of receiver to reduce the required amount of pilot symbols. A remaining question to ask is which combinations of estimation and detection algorithms that provide the best trade-off between performance and complexity. We address this issue by considering MU detectors and channel estimators, with varying algorithm complexity. For MU detection, two algorithms based on parallel interference cancellation (PIC) are considered and compared with the optimal symbol-wise maximum a-posteriori probability (MAP) detector. For channel estimation, an algorithm performing joint minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) estimation is considered along with a low complexity replica making use of a Krylov subspace method. An estimator based on the space alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm is also considered. Our results show that low-complexity algorithms provide the best tradeoff, even though more receiver iterations are needed to reach a desired performance...|$|E

In the beginning optical remote sensing on oil spill detection was introduced. Oil and its characteristic spectral signature {{can be detected}} using optical sensors on onboard satellites. The larger part of the chapter is devoted to remote sensing of oil spills through SAR sensors operating in the microwave part of the electro – magnetic spectrum. The theory of microwave remote sensing of oil film is described with a direct reference to satellite sensors. The historical aspects of oil spill detection, including a specific application to monitor the trend {{of the problem of}} illicit discharges on the long term, which leaded to the operational services, were also illustrated.

However, with {{an increasing number of}} processors in a system, fault detection and fault tolerance become critical issues. By replicating the computation on more than one processor and comparing the results produced by these processors, errors can be detected. During the execution of a program, due to data dependencies, typica a multiprocessor system are busy at all times. Therefore processor schedules contain idle time slots and oal of this work to exploit these idle time slots to schedule duplicated computation for the purpose of fault detecti ssisted approach to fault detection in regular loops on distributed-memory systems.

40|$|Trabajo presentado al 14 th International Superconductive Electronics Conference (ISEC), celebrado en Cambridge, Massachusetts (EE. UU.) del 7 al 11 de julio de 2013. [...] et al. We {{report the}} design and {{performance}} of thin-film microsusceptometers intended for magnetic measurements on samples at variable temperature down to the low mK range and excitation frequencies of up to about 1 MHz. The devices are realized as first-order gradiometers with two circular loops of 60 μm or 30 μm average diameter {{resulting in a total}} inductance of 360 pH or 250 pH, respectively. An integrated excitation coil generates a magnetic field with a sensitivity of 0. 1 T/A at the sample position, whereas the Josephson junctions are located in a field-reduced area. The susceptometers are fabricated by a conventional Nb/AlOx/Nb trilayer process. In order to enhance the sensitivity to the level required for the measurement of sub-μm samples, an extra <b>detection</b> <b>loop</b> of about 450 nm inner diameter was integrated into one of the pickup loops by using a focused ion beam (FIB). We show that this device is able of detecting signals from very small permalloy samples. An improved susceptometer design for equipment with integrated nanoloops is also presented, for which a total inductance of 50 pH is predicted.

40|$|In {{the past}} two decades, {{robotics}} and autonomous vehicles have received ever increasing research attention. For an autonomous robot to function fully autonomously alongside humans, it {{must be able to}} solve the same tasks as humans do, and it must be able to sense the surrounding environment. Two such tasks are addressed in this thesis, using data from laser range sensors. The first task is recognising that the robot has returned to a previously visited location, a problem called loop closure <b>detection.</b> <b>Loop</b> closure detection is a fundamental part of the simultaneous localisation and mapping problem, which consists of mapping an unknown area and simultaneously localise in the same map. In this thesis, a classification approach is taken to the loop closure detection problem. The laser range data is described in terms of geometrical and statistical properties, called features. Pairs of laser range data from two different locations are compared by using adaptive boosting to construct a classifier that takes as input the computed features. Experiments using real world laser data are used to evaluate the properties of the classifier, and the classifier is shown to compare well to existing solutions. The second task is keeping track of objects that surround the robot, a problem called target tracking. Target tracking is an estimation problem in which data association between the estimates and measurements is of high importance. The data association is complicated by things such as noise and false measurements. In this thesis, extended targets, i. e. targets that potentially generate more than one measurement per time step, are considered. The multiple measurements per time step further complicate the data association. Tracking of extended targets is performed using an implementation of a probability hypothesis density filter, which is evaluated in simulations using the optimal sub-pattern assignment metric. The filter is also used to track humans with real world laser range data, and the experiments show that the filter can handle the so called occlusion problem...|$|E

Tara Oceans Data are particularly suited to study the genetic, morphological and functional diversity of plankton. The present data set provides raw validated data of continuous measurements of partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO 2), using a ProOceanus CO 2 -Pro instrument mounted on the flowthrough system. This automatic sensor is fitted with an equilibrator made of gas permeable silicone membrane and an internal <b>detection</b> <b>loop</b> with a non-dispersive infrared detector of PPSystems SBA- 4 CO 2 analyzer. A zero-CO 2 baseline is provided for the subsequent measurements circulating the internal gas through a CO 2 absorption chamber containing soda lime or Ascarite. The frequency of this automatic zero point calibration was set to be 24 hours. All data recorded during zeroing processes were discarded with the 15 -minute data after each calibration. The output of CO 2 -Pro is the mole fraction of CO 2 in the measured water and the pCO 2 is obtained using the measured total pressure of the internal wet gas. The fugacity of CO 2 (fCO 2) in the surface seawater, whose difference with the atmospheric CO 2 fugacity {{is proportional to the}} air-sea CO 2 fluxes, is obtained by correcting the pCO 2 for non-ideal CO 2 gas concentration according to Weiss (1974). The fCO 2 computed using CO 2 -Pro measurements was corrected to the sea surface condition by considering the temperature effect on fCO 2 (Takahashi et al., 1993). The surface seawater observations that were initially estimated with a 15 seconds frequency were averaged every 5 -min cycle. The performance of CO 2 -Pro was adjusted by comparing the sensor outputs against the thermodynamic carbonate calculation of pCO 2 using the carbonic system constants of Millero et al.

AT was determined using an automated open cell potentiometric titration (Haraldsson et al. 1997).

50|$|Vehicle <b>detection</b> <b>loops,</b> called inductive-loop traffic detectors, {{can detect}} {{vehicles}} passing or {{arriving at a}} certain point, for instance approaching a traffic light or in motorway traffic. An insulated, electrically conducting loop is installed in the pavement. The electronics unit transmits energy into the wire loops at frequencies between 10 kHz to 200 kHz, depending on the model. The inductive-loop system behaves as a tuned electrical circuit in which the loop wire and lead-in cable are the inductive elements. When a vehicle passes over the loop or is stopped within the loop, the vehicle induces eddy currents in the wire loops, which decrease their inductance. The decreased inductance actuates the electronics unit output relay or solid-state optically isolated output, which sends a pulse to the traffic signal controller signifying the passage or presence of a vehicle. Parking structures for automobiles may use inductive loops to track traffic (occupancy) in and out or may be used by access gates or ticketing systems to detect vehicles while others use Parking guidance and information systems. Railways may use an induction loop to detect the passage of trains past a given point, as an electronic treadle.|$|R
