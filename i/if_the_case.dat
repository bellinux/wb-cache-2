5|$|Cordray {{was granted}} a ruling by the Ohio Supreme Court that lower courts could not grant a stay of {{execution}} for a death row inmate. At the same time, Fisher, Cordray's boss, sought a referendum to mandate that appeals in death penalty cases be made directly to the Supreme Court. In 1994 the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Steffen v. Tate (39 F.3d 622 1994) limited death row inmates to a single federal appeal and said that federal courts cannot stay an execution <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> is still in a state court.|$|E
5|$|On 9 July 1386, at the Palais de Justice in Paris the two claimants {{faced each}} other {{for the first time since}} their {{confrontation}} at Argentan several months before. Each stepped before the Parlement in turn and presented their case for the King and court, Carrouges throwing down his gauntlet in challenge and Le Gris picking it up signifying his acceptance of the duel. Le Gris also embellished his case by insisting that should he be proven innocent of the offence, he would sue Carrouges or his estate for 40,000 livres. Following the declarations a number of high-ranking noblemen stepped forward to act as seconds in the duel for both men, including Waleran of Saint-Pol for Carrouges and Philip of Artois, Count of Eu for Le Gris. After hearing the challenges and accusations, the Parlement and King debated the case and decided that a full hearing of the evidence from witnesses would be held to determine guilt. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> could not be decided by normal means, then a judicial duel would be held to adjudicate the dispute, God choosing the victor.|$|E

5000|$|Operating room (OR) {{efficiency}} {{is a measure}} of how well time and resources are used for their intended purposes. One way to analyze {{efficiency is}} to chart under-utilized and over-utilized time spent on a given day in <b>the</b> operating room. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> in an operating room finish earlier than scheduled, time is under-utilized. Likewise, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> in an operating room run [...] "late" [...] or past its allotted operating room time then this produces over-utilized time.|$|R

25|$|The {{decision}} has been criticized {{on the grounds that}} defendants and prosecutors will suffer from greater uncertainty, and some plea agreements will be entered into or rejected based on mistaken beliefs as to what sentences the judge will impose <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> is taken to trial or settled with a guilty plea.|$|E
25|$|In January 2004, Andrea Constand, {{a former}} Temple University employee, accused Cosby of drugging and fondling her; however, in February 2005, Montgomery County's District Attorney {{said there would}} be no charges due to {{insufficient}} credible and admissible evidence.

25|$|Some {{cases are}} {{automatically}} appealed (for instance, when a marriage {{is found to}} be null).

25|$|The High Court's {{jurisdiction}} is as follows: generally, a {{civil case}} is commenced in the High Court if {{the subject matter of}} the claim exceeds S$250,000. Probate matters are dealt with in the High Court if the value of the estate exceeds S$3 million or <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> involves the resealing of a foreign grant.

25|$|Wilfredo Engalla is {{a notable}} case. In 1991, Engalla {{died of lung}} cancer nearly five months after {{submitting}} a written demand for arbitration. The California Supreme Court found that Kaiser had a financial incentive to wait until after Engalla died; his spouse could recover $500,000 from Kaiser <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> was arbitrated while he was alive, but only $250,000 after he died. The Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights contends that Kaiser continues to oppose HMO arbitration reform.|$|E

25|$|Pleading (making a claim of) fraud or {{fraudulent}} misrepresentation {{should be}} undertaken with care, {{since it is}} a more serious claim and therefore will be looked at more stringently; <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> is lost or the claim would make no difference to the outcome, then any award in respect of the defending party's costs may be higher {{as a result of}} extra work to defend the claim.

25|$|Psychologists may use a {{definition}} from the American Psychiatric Association's DSM-IV, defining nocturnal enuresis as repeated urination into bed or clothes, occurring twice per {{week or more}} {{for at least three}} consecutive months in a child of at least 5 years of age and not due to either a drug side effect or a medical condition.
