50|$|When two linked {{interfaces}} are set {{to different}} <b>duplex</b> <b>modes,</b> {{the effect of this}} duplex mismatch is a network that functions much more slowly than its nominal speed. Duplex mismatch may be inadvertently caused when an administrator configures an interface to a fixed mode (e.g. 100 Mbit/s full duplex) and fails to configure the remote interface, leaving it set to autonegotiate. Then, when the autonegotiation process fails, half duplex is assumed by the autonegotiating side of the link.|$|R

30|$|Traditionally, {{wireless}} communication nodes operate in half <b>duplex</b> (HD) <b>mode,</b> i.e., in either time division <b>duplex</b> (TDD) <b>mode</b> or frequency division <b>duplex</b> (FDD) <b>mode.</b> Recently, a new duplex technique, which called co-frequency co-time full duplex (FD), has been attracting great attention, {{due to its}} potential capability to double the spectral efficiency [1 – 4]. In FD mode, the interference from transmitter to its own receiver should be canceled effectively. In the past few years, a great {{progress has been made}} on the self-interference (SI) cancelation issue [3, 5, 6]. By jointly employing antenna isolation, radio frequency cancelation, and digital cancelation, the interference cancelation ability can achieve more than 110 dB [2]. The SI can be reduced to much lower than the desired signal by using the methods proposed in [5 – 7], thus making the FD technique possible in some application scenarios. Many studies investigating the performance of FD communication either assume perfect self-interference cancelation [8] or treat the residual interference as a Gaussian noise [9].|$|R

30|$|In this contribution, we {{investigate}} {{the concept of}} time division <b>duplexing</b> (TDD) <b>mode</b> {{as an alternative to}} underlay short-range femtocells on the uplink of legacy macrocell deployments. To mitigate the resulting co-channel interference, the underlaid femtocell tier uses a distributed mechanism which is based on regular busy tones and relies on minimal signaling exchange. Stochastic geometry is used to model practical scenarios by capturing network dynamics and channel variations. The impact of the fading correlation on the performance of the coordination mechanism is examined as well. Higher-order statistics through the cumulants concept are used to recover the distribution of the co-channel interference and evaluate the system performance in terms of the outage probability and average channel capacity. We observe that our analytical framework matches well with numerical results obtained using Monte Carlo simulations. In contrast to the uncoordinated frequency division <b>duplexing</b> <b>mode,</b> the coordinated TDD-underlay solution shows a reduction in the outage probability of nearly 80 %, while the average spectral efficiency increases by approximately 90 % in high loads.|$|R

In contrast, in TDD mode, both UP and DL data are sent using the same frequency but in different time slices. Both <b>duplexing</b> <b>modes</b> operate in a frame format. Each frame is partitioned into DL and UP subframes. The DL subframe is used by the BS to transmit data and manage messages to an SS, while the UP subframe is used by all SSs to transmit data.|$|R

50|$|Autonegotiation is an Ethernet {{procedure}} {{by which}} two connected devices choose common transmission parameters, such as speed, <b>duplex</b> <b>mode,</b> and flow control.

50|$|There is no signal which defines {{whether the}} {{interface}} {{is in full}} or half <b>duplex</b> <b>mode,</b> but both the MAC and the PHY need to agree. This must instead be communicated over the serial MDIO/MDC interface. There is also no signal which defines whether the interface is in 10 or 100 Mbit/s mode, so this must also be handled using the MDIO/MDC interface, just like the duplex setting. Version 1.2 of the RMII Consortium specification states that its MDIO/MDC interface is identical to that specified for MII in IEEE 802.3u. Current revisions of IEEE 803.2 specify a standard MDIO/MDC mechanism for negotiating and configuring the link's speed and <b>duplex</b> <b>mode,</b> {{but it is possible}} that older PHY devices might have been designed against obsolete versions of the standard, and may therefore use proprietary methods to set speed and duplex.Future versions of the RMII standard might specify a way to transmit data over TXD0/TXD1/RXD0/RXD1 pins while TX_EN and CRS_DV are de-asserted. This may allow for real-time conveyance of parameters such as link speed or duplex without needing to poll the MDIO/MDC serial link.|$|E
30|$|To {{adapt the}} {{transmission}} parameters {{to the current}} channel conditions, CSI at the transmitter is required. Since up- and downlink are implemented for frequency-division <b>duplexing</b> <b>mode,</b> the reciprocity of the channel cannot be exploited. For non-reciprocal channels, the receiver has to estimate the channel and then feed back the CSI to the transmitter. To reduce the overhead, the fed back CSI is quantized. The feedback calculation is an intelligent way of quantizing the CSI, it comprises the precoding matrix indicator (PMI), rank indicator (RI) and channel quality indicator (CQI). By the CQI feedback, the transmitter selects one of 15 MCSs. By the PMI, the transmitter selects a precoding matrix from a codebook and the RI informs the transmitter {{about the number of}} active transmission layers.|$|R
