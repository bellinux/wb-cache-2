5|$|Ahimsa is {{imperative}} <b>for</b> <b>practitioners</b> of Patañjali's eight limb Raja yoga system. It {{is included in}} the first limb and is the first of five Yamas (self restraints) which, together with the second limb, make up the code of ethical conduct in Yoga philosophy.

5|$|Most aikido systems add {{a pair of}} wide pleated {{black or}} indigo {{trousers}} called a hakama (used also in kendo and iaido). In many schools, its use is reserved <b>for</b> <b>practitioners</b> with (dan) ranks or for instructors, while others allow all practitioners to wear a hakama regardless of rank.|$|E
5|$|Urban design {{management}} offers prescriptive advice <b>for</b> <b>practitioners</b> trying to organise city planning activities {{in a way}} that will increase sustainability by increasing satisfaction levels. Real estate development and urban planning often occur at very different decision-making levels. The practitioners involved may have diverse educational and professional backgrounds. They certainly have conflicting interests. Providing prescriptive advice for differing, possibly conflicting, groups requires construction of a framework that accommodates all of their daily activities and responsibilities. Urban {{design management}} provides a common framework to help bring together the conventional practices of urban and regional planning, real estate development, and urban design.|$|E

5|$|When Falun Gong {{was banned}} in {{mainland}} China in 1999, re-education through labor became a common punishment <b>for</b> <b>practitioners.</b> Some {{human rights groups}} claim {{that as many as}} 10,000 Falun Gong members were detained in between 1999 and 2002, with as many as 5,000 detained in 2001 alone. More recent estimates suggest that hundreds of thousands of Falun Gong adherents are imprisoned in China, with some sources estimating up to half of the official reeducation through labor camp population is Falun Gong practitioners. In some labor camps, Falun Gong practitioners make up the majority population.|$|E

25|$|Grothendieck laid a new {{foundation}} for algebraic geometry by making intrinsic spaces ("spectra") and associated rings the primary objects of study.

Schemes have become the basic objects of study <b>for</b> <b>practitioners</b> of modern algebraic geometry. Their use as a foundation allowed geometry to absorb technical advances from other fields.|$|E
25|$|Medical {{availability}} and clinical practice varies {{across the world}} due to regional differences in culture and technology.

25|$|The {{instructions}} on the practice of Vajrayoginī contain concise and clearly presented meditations that are relatively easy to practice. The mantra is short and easy to recite, and the visualizations of the , the Deity, and the body maṇḍala are simple {{compared with those of}} other Highest Yoga Tantra Deities. Even practitioners with limited abilities and little wisdom can engage in these practices without great difficulty. The practice of Vajrayoginī quickly brings blessings, especially during this spiritually degenerate age. It is said that as the general level of spirituality decreases, it becomes increasingly difficult <b>for</b> <b>practitioners</b> to receive the blessings of other Deities; but the opposite is the case with Heruka and Vajrayoginī – the more times degenerate, the more easily practitioners can receive their blessings.|$|E
25|$|Nonetheless, {{news reports}} and related blogs {{indicate}} that HBOT {{is used for}} many cases of children with autism. HBOT can cost up to $150 per hour with individuals using anywhere from 40 to 120 hours {{as a part of}} their integrated treatment programs. In addition, purchasing (at $8,495–27,995) and renting ($1,395 per month) of the HBOT chambers is another option some families use. When considering the financial and time investments required in order to participate in this treatment and the inconsistency of the present findings, HBOT seems to be a riskier and thus, often less favorable alternative treatment for autism. Further studies are needed in order <b>for</b> <b>practitioners</b> and families to make more conclusive and valid decisions concerning HBOT treatments.|$|E
25|$|During 2003 and 2008, Liberati led with Zadig, a {{scientific}} publisher, specialized in EBM communication, {{a program to}} disseminate independent and unbiased information to all Italian doctors. He did so by translating Clinical Evidence, a compendium of the best available evidence on treating {{a wide range of}} common conditions, into Italian and distributing it freely, supported by the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA). By 2008, six Italian editions were published, freely available to all 248,000 doctors in practice in Italy at that time. Again in collaboration with Zadig, to speed up the diffusion of EBM, Liberati launched a free-access continuous medical education e-learning system, based on Clinical Evidence, called ECCE (the Italian acronym for Continuing Education Clinical Evidence). At the end of 2008 almost 130,000 health professionals were using ECCE, considered contents relevant and appropriate for educational purposes and expressed their intention to apply the acquired information into clinical practice. This is considered a successful example of knowledge translation, making research findings more accessible and clinically relevant to increase their usefulness <b>for</b> <b>practitioners</b> and, ultimately, improve patient outcomes.|$|E
40|$|Entrepreneurial {{education}} is often lacking <b>for</b> nurse <b>practitioners</b> which can impact {{their ability to}} successfully run nurse practitioner owned practices.

A link to a 50 -minute online module covering introductory entrepreneurial skills <b>for</b> nurse <b>practitioners</b> {{was sent to the}} faculty and graduate students in the University of Vermont Nursing program.
