5|$|Snakes and limbless lizards {{typically}} possess {{only the}} right lung {{as a major}} respiratory organ; the left lung <b>is</b> <b>greatly</b> reduced, or even absent. Amphisbaenians, however, have the opposite arrangement, with a major left lung, and a reduced or absent right lung.|$|E
5|$|A more {{indirect}} {{effect would be}} that the contracted s and p1/2 orbitals shield (take on themselves) the charge of the nucleus more effectively, leaving even less for the outer d and f electrons, which therefore move on larger orbitals. Dubnium <b>is</b> <b>greatly</b> affected by this: unlike the previous group 5 members, its 7s electrons are more difficult to extract from an atom than the 6d electrons, though these energy levels remain close to each other.|$|E

60|$|At {{first the}} good King <b>was</b> <b>greatly</b> surprised; but soon, appreciating the jest, he lay {{back in his}} chair and laughed long and merrily. And his courtiers and the fine ladies present heartily joined in the laughter, for they also <b>were</b> <b>greatly</b> amused.|$|R
5|$|Andranik left Armenia in 1919 due to {{disagreements}} with the Armenian government and spent his {{last years of}} life in Europe and the United States seeking relief for Armenian refugees. He settled in Fresno, California in 1922 and died five years later in 1927. Andranik <b>is</b> <b>greatly</b> admired as a national hero by Armenians; numerous statues of him have been erected in several countries. Streets and squares were named after Andranik, and songs, poems and novels {{have been written about}} him, making him a legendary figure in Armenian culture.|$|E
5|$|Built between 1175 and 1490, Wells Cathedral {{has been}} {{described}} as “the most poetic of the English Cathedrals”. Much of the structure is in the Early English style and <b>is</b> <b>greatly</b> enriched by the deeply sculptural nature of the mouldings and the vitality of the carved capitals in a foliate style known as “stiff leaf”. The eastern end has retained much original glass, which is rare in England. The exterior has the finest Early English façade and a large central tower.|$|E
5|$|Hisako is second-in-command of Girls Dead Monster {{who plays}} a Fender Jazzmaster {{electric}} guitar as lead guitarist. She has a candid personality and likes to play mahjong, which she has incredible luck with. As noted by Hinata, Hisako is also athletic and <b>is</b> <b>greatly</b> admired by Yui for her guitar riffs. In life, she {{was a part of}} a band whose main vocalist ended up committing suicide, but after meeting Iwasawa, she forms Girls Dead Monster with her.|$|E

5|$|Hybridization <b>is</b> <b>greatly</b> {{influenced}} by human {{impact on the}} environment, through effects such as habitat fragmentation and species introductions. Such impacts {{make it difficult to}} conserve the genetics of populations undergoing introgressive hybridization. Humans have introduced species worldwide to environments for a long time, both intentionally for purposes such as biological control, and unintentionally, as with accidental escapes of individuals. Introductions can drastically affect populations, including through hybridization.|$|E
5|$|Palladium is a soft silver-white {{metal that}} resembles {{platinum}}. It {{is the least}} dense and has the lowest melting point of the platinum group metals. It is soft and ductile when annealed and <b>is</b> <b>greatly</b> increased in strength and hardness when cold-worked. Palladium dissolves slowly in concentrated nitric acid, in hot, concentrated sulfuric acid, and when finely ground, in hydrochloric acid. It dissolves readily at room temperature in aqua regia.|$|E
5|$|The United Nations fields a large {{military}} force to eliminate the remaining zombies from overrun areas, defeat hordes that surface from the ocean floor, and kill frozen zombies before they melt. It is stated that previously eradicated diseases have made a comeback and that global life expectancy <b>is</b> <b>greatly</b> reduced as the world slowly recovers from the war.|$|E

5|$|The bluespotted {{stingray}} {{was discovered}} by Heinrich Kuhl in Java, Indonesia. The population of this species <b>is</b> <b>greatly</b> debatable due to the five different species of rays in Indonesia. Also, {{there are two different}} subgroups: the Java and Bali form. The distinct difference between the two strains is their size, with the Bali being much larger than the Java. On the familial level, the family Dasyatidae is made up of 9 genera and 70 species. The genus of Neotrygon are called maskrays, because of the color pattern around their eyes.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} {{diffusion}} damping <b>is</b> <b>greatly</b> augmented by the finite {{width of the}} surface of last scattering (SLS). The finite width of the SLS means the CMB photons we see were not all emitted at the same time, and the fluctuations we see are not all in phase. It also means that during recombination, the diffusion length changed dramatically, as the ionisation fraction shifted.|$|E
5|$|The flowers hold profuse {{amounts of}} nectar and are pollinated by honeyeaters. Although L.formosa is {{uncommon}} in cultivation, it is straightforward {{to grow in}} soils with good drainage and a partly shaded to sunny aspect. It is readily propagated by seed. Unlike all {{other members of the}} genus Lambertia, L.formosa <b>is</b> <b>greatly</b> resistant to the soil pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi.|$|E

5|$|The {{middle toe}} of the California condor's foot <b>is</b> <b>greatly</b> elongated, and the hind one is only {{slightly}} developed. The talons of all the toes are straight and blunt, and are thus more adapted to walking than gripping. This is more similar to their supposed relatives the storks than to birds of prey and Old World vultures, which use their feet as weapons or organs of prehension.|$|E
5|$|The {{olfactory}} bulb {{is a special}} structure that processes olfactory sensory signals and sends its output to the olfactory part of the pallium. It is a major brain component in many vertebrates, but <b>is</b> <b>greatly</b> reduced in humans and other primates (whose senses are dominated by information acquired by sight rather than smell).|$|E

Gilbert wrote a short comic play titled Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, in Hamlet's play is {{presented}} as a tragedy written by Claudius in his youth of which he <b>is</b> <b>greatly</b> embarrassed.

5|$|WASP-15b has {{a mass of}} 0.542 times Jupiter's {{mass and}} a radius that is 1.428 times Jupiter's radius. Due in part to its {{proximity}} to its host star, a distance of 0.0499 AU (7,500,000km), WASP-15b <b>is</b> <b>greatly</b> inflated, with a density of 0.247 g/cm3. Another factor, such as an internal heat source, is suspected to add to this extremely high radius and extremely low density. WASP-15b orbits its host star every 3.7520656 days. It also has an orbital inclination of 85.5º, making it almost edge-on {{as seen from the}} Earth's perspective.|$|E
5|$|At {{the back}} of the skull there is a protrusion, called the nuchal crest, arising from the fused parietal bones, a feature shared with all tyrannosaurids. In Alioramus, the nuchal crest <b>is</b> <b>greatly</b> thickened, {{similarly}} to Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus. Like the rest of the skull, the lower jaw of Alioramus was long and slender, another possible juvenile characteristic. As in Tarbosaurus, a ridge on the outer surface of the angular bone of the lower jaw articulated with the rear of the dentary bone, locking the two bones together and removing much of the flexibility seen in other tyrannosaurids. Other tyrannosaurids had four premaxillary teeth, D-shaped in cross section, on each side. Including 16 or 17 in each maxilla, and 18 in each dentary, Alioramus had 76 or 78 teeth, more than any other tyrannosaurid. The braincase of A. altai was intermediate between the basal theropod and avialan conditions.|$|E
5|$|Carpentier’s {{historical}} account <b>is</b> <b>greatly</b> simplified {{in order}} to increase the contrast between the white land owners and their black slaves. The marvellous, one of the most notable features of the novel, is used as a marker of contrast between the two groups: firstly, because mention of the magical always takes the form of the slaves' point of view, while the more real interpretation of each event is from the whites' perspective; secondly, because the marvellous is used as a weapon to fight injustice. Instances of cruelty and violence between the groups are recounted grotesquely in great detail, which enhances the rivalry. More importantly, by allowing readers to see through the slaves' point of view, Carpentier brings to light the power and durability of the Haitian community and destabilizes the narrative of Western supremacy.|$|E
