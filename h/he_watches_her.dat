5|$|Michael and Dwight {{meet with}} Jan, {{who is now}} a fairly {{successful}} office manager for a hospital and single mother. After Jan gives Michael a brutal description of why their relationship failed and <b>he</b> <b>watches</b> <b>her</b> play with her daughter Astrid, Michael reveals that he has herpes. He meets with Helene, Pam's mother, who is playing with CeCe at a playground; after an awkward conversation in which she also points out his skewed memory, he insults her and walks off. He meets with Carol while she is conducting an open house. Carol attempts to be polite, but then abruptly points out his faults too. Finally, Michael calls Holly one last time, only to get her voicemail. He leaves her a heartfelt message that what she said hurt him and that when he saw all his other exes, he had not been happy to see any of them, but when he talked to her, he was happy. He says that does not understand why she wants to downplay what they had, but he remembers their relationship perfectly and considers it special. Before hanging up, he awkwardly adds that she should be tested for herpes.|$|E

25|$|An {{acquaintance}} from college, Gavin Elster, asks Scottie {{to follow}} his wife, Madeleine, claiming that she is {{in some sort of}} danger. Scottie reluctantly agrees, and follows Madeleine to a florist where she buys a bouquet of flowers, to the Mission San Francisco de Asís and the grave of one Carlotta Valdes (1831–1857), and to the Legion of Honor art museum where she gazes at the Portrait of Carlotta. <b>He</b> <b>watches</b> <b>her</b> enter the McKittrick Hotel, but on investigation she {{does not seem to be}} there.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Topes had {{followed}} her {{slowly through the}} gate and across the sand. <b>He</b> <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> running down from the cabin, slender as a boy, with long, bounding strides. <b>He</b> <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> go jumping with great splashes through the deepening water, then throw herself forward and begin to swim. <b>He</b> <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> till she {{was no more than}} a small dark dot far out.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> {{straight}} swaying figure swing {{across the}} lawn and up {{the steps of the}} half-timbered inn. <b>He</b> <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> enter the door before he hastened to the shops which clustered about the railway- station, outside of the poetic preserves of the colony proper.|$|R
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Myers as Austin Powers, {{receiving}} {{a call from}} his boss Basil Exposition (Michael York) who warns him against a dangerous spy describing her as a [...] "master of disguise". The screen of his car depicts five images of Madonna wearing different looks, and Exposition clarifies {{that she has been}} [...] "seducing our top agents". He also warns Powers [...] "whatever you do don't fall in love. We've already lost 007 and 008". As the video continues, Powers finds Madonna at a club performing in front of a crowd, which includes Verne Troyer in character as Mini-Me. As <b>he</b> <b>watches</b> <b>her</b> perform Powers finds himself fantasizing about the two of them dancing in front of a white background with psychedelic fluorescent whirls. He also visualizes them riding a car together, where Madonna dances suggestively and licks Powers' face while rubbing her crotch and bottom on his cheeks.|$|E
2500|$|Chapter One {{introduces}} us to Don Santiago, the uncontested {{patriarch of}} Rancho La Palma, and his family. He, {{like his father}} and grandfather before him, has also married a pureblooded Spanish woman, Doña María Petronilla, who is characterized by her simple and unprepossessing dresses. They have four children, all of whom are in their teenage years. Two of these are sons—Alvaro and Luis Gonzaga—and two are daughters—María de los Ángeles and Susanita. Susanita, like the grandmother whose name she shares, is blonde and green-eyed.

Holden refuses to let her come with him, which upsets Phoebe, so Holden decides not to leave after all. He tries to cheer her up by taking her to the Central Park Zoo, and as <b>he</b> <b>watches</b> <b>her</b> ride the zoo's carousel, he is filled with happiness and joy at the sight of Phoebe riding in the rain.|$|E

60|$|Nora, {{following}} Aunt Judy {{with the}} rolled-up cloth in her hands, {{looks at him}} and strikes him dumb. <b>He</b> <b>watches</b> <b>her</b> until she disappears; then comes to Larry and addresses him with sudden intensity.|$|E
6000|$|MAN. Shall I {{ever forget}} him. (She again {{goes to the}} chest of drawers. <b>He</b> <b>watches</b> <b>her</b> with a vague hope {{that she may have}} {{something}} else for him to eat. She takes the portrait from its stand and brings it to him.) ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> {{to see how}} {{she would}} receive this, but she laughed.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> striding away {{toward the}} main road, and {{then opened the}} box.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>watched</b> <b>her,</b> pityingly, as she wept. But {{presently}} {{she raised}} her face, wonderingly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now here's {{what bothers}} me. She knows music. I {{asked her if}} she played. And he's fixed that place up like a palace. That being so, why hasn't he a piano for her? Another thing: she's quick and lively and <b>he</b> <b>watches</b> <b>her</b> {{whenever}} she talks. He's on pins and needles, and continually breaking in and leading the conversation. Say, did you ever hear that Swithin Hall was married?" ...|$|E
60|$|KEEGAN. You couldn't {{do better}} this fine evening. [Gravely] I'll tell him where you've gone. [She turns {{as if to}} forbid him; but the deep {{understanding}} in his eyes makes that impossible; and she only looks at him earnestly and goes. <b>He</b> <b>watches</b> <b>her</b> disappear {{on the other side}} of the hill; then says] Aye, he's come to torment you; and you're driven already to torment him. [He shakes his head, and goes slowly away across the hill in the opposite direction, lost in thought].|$|E
6000|$|MAN (cunningly). Ah; {{but suppose}} I don't shoot you, {{what will happen}} then? Why, {{a lot of your}} cavalry--the {{greatest}} blackguards in your army--will burst into this pretty room of yours and slaughter me here like a pig; for I'll fight like a demon: they shan't get me into the street to amuse themselves with: I know what they are. Are you prepared to receive that sort of company in your present undress? (Raina, suddenly conscious of her nightgown, instinctively shrinks and gathers it more closely about her. <b>He</b> <b>watches</b> <b>her,</b> and adds, pitilessly) It's rather scanty, eh? (She turns to the ottoman. He raises his pistol instantly, and cries) Stop! (She stops.) Where are you going? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It {{would not}} have treated you so well,' he said. She {{looked at him with}} heavy eyes. Then she {{returned}} to her bulb. Her fingers were very small and very pink. She had the most delicate touch in the world, like a faint feel of silk. As <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> lifting her fingers from off the glass, then gently stroking it, his blood ran hot. <b>He</b> <b>watched</b> <b>her,</b> waited upon her words and movements attentively.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> furtively, {{trying to}} catch some cue as to her {{attitude}} and mood.|$|R
60|$|Her {{heart beat}} fiery hot, as <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> with those bright agate eyes, fixedly.|$|R
6000|$|Presently he resumed: [...] "Señor, {{you have}} told my {{mistress}} {{that you are}} a poor man; that you look upon this country life as a free and happy one; that above all things you would like to possess an estancia where you could breed cattle and race-horses and hunt ostriches. All this she has revolved in her mind, and because it is in her power to offer you the things you desire does she now ask you to aid her in her trouble. And now, señor, let me tell you this. The Peralta property extends {{all the way to the}} Rocha waters; five leagues of land, and there is none better in this department. It was formerly well stocked. There were thousands of cattle and mares; for my master's party then ruled in the country; the Colorados were shut up in Montevideo, and that cut-throat Frutos Rivera never came into this part. Of the cattle only a remnant remains, but the land is a fortune for any man, and, when my old master dies, Doña Demetria inherits all. Even now it is hers, since her father has lost his calabash, as you have seen. Now let me tell you what happened many years ago. Don Hilario was at first a peon--a poor boy the Colonel befriended. When he grew up he was made capatas, then mayordomo. Don Calixto was killed and the Colonel lost his reason, then Don Hilario made himself all-powerful, doing what he liked with his master, and setting Doña Demetria's authority aside. Did he protect the interests of the estancia? On the contrary, he was one with our enemies, and when they came like dogs for our cattle and horses he was behind them. This he did to make friends of the reigning party, when the Blancos had lost everything. Now he wishes to marry Doña Demetria to make himself owner of the land. Don Calixto is dead, and who is there to bell the cat? Even now he acts like the only owner; he buys and sells and the money is his. My mistress is scarcely allowed clothes to wear; she has no horse to ride on and is a prisoner in her own house. <b>He</b> <b>watches</b> <b>her</b> like a cat watching a bird shut in a room; if he suspected her of an intention to make her escape he would murder her. He has sworn to her that unless she marries him he will kill her. Is not this sad? Señor, she asks you to deliver her from this man. Her words I have forgotten, but imagine that you see her before you a suppliant on her knees, and that you know what the thing is she asks, and see her lips move, though you do not hear her words." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> and her labours with a {{cruel and}} {{malicious}} grin upon his swarthy countenance.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>watched</b> <b>her,</b> and all {{his being}} seemed {{attentive}} to her, then he shook his head.|$|R
60|$|And {{she told}} him, briefly, laconically, <b>her</b> position. <b>He</b> <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> closely, curiously all the while.|$|R

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> face, but her hat shaded {{her eyes}} and he could read nothing in it.|$|R
60|$|She {{waited for}} a moment or two trying to gain courage, whilst <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> <b>her,</b> greatly amused.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> {{until she}} passed beyond the window frame. He {{strained}} to see impossibly round the corner....|$|R
