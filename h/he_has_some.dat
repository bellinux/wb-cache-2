5|$|The {{original}} ending {{was to have}} John killed, and {{his image}} kept alive by the resistance by grafting his skin onto Marcus' cybernetic body. Marcus would have then murdered Kate, Barnes, Kyle, and Star. However, after the ending was leaked on the Internet, Warner Bros. decided to completely change the entire third act of the film. McG and Nolan did continue the Christ element of John's character though, in which <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>some</b> followers who believe what he knows about Skynet and others who do not.|$|E
5|$|The team {{tries to}} call for further assistance, but find the radio is no longer working. Randall heads outside to check the power transformers, and is {{attacked}} by a large creature (Ross Sturlin) hiding in the underbrush around the station. Randall fires a few shots at the creature with his pistol and escapes unscathed. Although {{he did not get}} a good look at the creature, he describes it to the rest of the team as similar in size to a bear. Later, the team finds the infirmary has been trashed and Corcoran's body is gone. They initially believe the creature has broken in and stole the corpse, but are shocked to instead find Corcoran has mysteriously regained consciousness. Upon checking his blood again, there is no trace of the mysterious cells from before, but after investigating Corcoran's body, they find the cells have changed into lizard-like fetuses and entered into his abdominal cavity. The creature later breaks into the lab again, this time beheading Dr. Wyman. Randall and Dunlap are initially suspicious that Corcoran was involved in the death, which he denies, but it appears <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>some</b> sort of telepathic connection with the creature. Despite Wyman's death, Corcoran does not believe the creature is evil, but rather simply misunderstood. He implores the others to give the creature a chance to explain its actions, and asks that they not condemn it as a monster simply because it is different.|$|E
5|$|Set in the author's present day, the interwar period, {{the novel}} centers on two strangers who arrive at {{different}} times in Jefferson, Yoknapatawpha County, Mississippi, a fictional county based on Faulkner's home, Lafayette County, Mississippi. The plot first focuses on Lena Grove, a young pregnant white woman from Alabama looking for {{the father of her}} unborn child, and then shifts to explore the life of Joe Christmas, a man who has settled in Jefferson and passes as white, but who secretly believes <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>some</b> black ancestry. After a series of flashbacks narrating Christmas's early life, the plot resumes with his living and working with Lucas Burch, the father of Lena's child, who fled to Jefferson and changed his name when he found out that Lena was pregnant. The woman on whose property Christmas and Burch have been living, Joanna Burden, a descendant of Yankee abolitionists hated by the citizens of Jefferson, is murdered. Burch is caught {{at the scene of the}} crime and reveals that Christmas had been romantically involved with her and is part black, thus implying that he is guilty of her murder. While Burch sits in jail awaiting his reward for turning in Christmas, Lena is assisted by Byron Bunch, a shy, mild-mannered bachelor who falls in love with her. Bunch seeks the aid of another outcast in the town, the disgraced former minister Gail Hightower, to help Lena give birth and protect Christmas from being lynched. Though Hightower refuses the latter, Christmas escapes to his house and is shot and castrated by a state guardsman. Burch leaves town without his reward, and the novel ends with an anonymous man recounting a story to his wife about some hitchhikers he picked up on the road to Tennesseea woman with a child and a man who was not the father of the child, both looking for the woman's husband.|$|E

25|$|Tom Bombadil {{is not an}} {{important}} person—to the narrative. I suppose <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>some</b> importance as a 'comment.'

25|$|Unlike Fanta, he {{can recall}} his father, but {{chooses not to}} tell Fanta of their father to protect her. It is {{revealed}} that Fanta's memories were erased once she arrived in Avalon, but Oran ensured that she and Pain would not. He and his mother do not get along and merely tolerate one another, though Oran admits to Fanta that she favors Pain over Fanta because her happiest memories in the human world were before Fanta was born, when Pain was growing up. While Pain strongly dislikes his mother-he refuses to call her 'mother', and it is he who gathered up evidence against Oran's crimes- <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>some</b> warm emotions towards her in truth. When Sangjae asks Pain to permit killing of Oran to save the faery world, Pain refuses.|$|E
