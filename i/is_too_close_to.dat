However, Black insists he can be of assistance, and reviews security footage of a stranger investigating Tom's luggage after their flight. Bletcher reports that a stolen car has been found abandoned, with Helen's blood inside. Fellow Millennium Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) helps Black identify the kidnapper from a set pictures of sex offenders in the Seattle area—Black recognizes Richard Green (Dylan Haggerty) as the man from the airport footage.|$|E

A cat whose whiskers have been damaged may bite the wrong part of its prey, indicating that they provide cats with detailed information about the shape and activity of its prey.|$|E

25|$|Latching on {{refers to}} how the baby fastens onto the breast while breastfeeding. A good latch means that {{the bottom of the}} areola (the area around the nipple) is in the baby's mouth and the nipple is back inside his or her mouth. A poor latch happens when the baby does not have enough of the breast in his/her mouth or <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the tip. This can cause cracked nipples and a {{reluctance}} to continue to breastfeed.|$|E
25|$|When a {{concrete}} structure is designed, it is usual {{to specify the}} concrete cover for the rebar (the depth of the rebar within the object). The minimum concrete cover is normally regulated by design or building codes. If the reinforcement <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the surface, early failure due to corrosion may occur. The concrete cover depth can be measured with a cover meter. However, carbonated concrete incurs a durability problem only when there is also sufficient moisture and oxygen to cause electropotential corrosion of the reinforcing steel.|$|E
25|$|The northwest-trending {{component}} of the postulated global grid of fractures is markedly absent in the Borealis region. Northeast-trending scarps and troughs are conspicuous, however, across intercrater plains material and in crater fill (smooth plains material) between the 155° and 185° meridians, and from crater Van Dijck northward to crater Purcell and beyond. The scarps tend to be straight in intercrater plains material, but become notably lobate in crater fill (for example, within Saikaku). This set of northeast-trending scarps and troughs, and another set of north-trending scarps and troughs within and north of crater Van Dijck, probably follow zones of structural weakness in the mercurian crust. Ancient fractures that were reactivated by later impacts may have first provided the conduits for crater fill (smooth plains material) and later been propagated upward through the fill. That these ridges, scarps, and troughs are parts of a global grid of fractures cannot be stated conclusively because of their proximity to the terminator {{and the lack of}} photographic coverage beyond the 190° meridian. Some scarps probably were formed by normal faulting of the smooth plains material that covers some crater floors, as in the Kuiper quadrangle (Scott and others, 1980). We cannot, however, determine whether most lineaments are internal or are parts of a faulted and lineated facies associated with a nearby but unphotographed impact basin. Melosh (1977) predicted that normal east-trending faults would form in high Mercurian latitudes as a result of slight crustal shortening. His predicted faults may be represented by a generally east-northeast-trending scarp and a lineament that cut across intermediate plains material and the crater Jókai between the 125° and 155° meridians. The north pole <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the terminator to detect {{the presence or absence of}} a “polygonal arrangement without preferred orientation,” as predicted by Melosh and Dzurisin (1978, p. 233).|$|E

[...] The study by Selsis et al. claims even [...] "a planet in the habitable zone is not necessarily habitable" [...] itself, and this planet [...] "is outside what can be considered the conservative habitable zone" [...] of the parent star, and further {{that if there was}} any water there then it was lost when the red dwarf was a strong X-ray and EUV emitter, it could have surface temperatures ranging from 700 K to 1000 K (430 to 730°C), like Venus today. [...] Temperature speculations by other scientists were based on the temperature of (and heat from) the parent star Gliese 581 and have been calculated without factoring in the margin of error (96°C/K) for the star's temperature of 3432 K to 3528 K, which leads to a large irradiance range for the planet, even before eccentricity is considered.|$|E
500|$|Lawrence Morton, in a {{study of}} the origins of The Rite, records that in 1907–08 Stravinsky set to music two poems from Sergey Gorodetsky's {{collection}} Yar. Another poem in the anthology, which Stravinsky did not set but is likely to have read, is [...] "Yarila" [...] which, Morton observes, contains many of the basic elements from which The Rite of Spring developed, including pagan rites, sage elders, and the propitiatory sacrifice of a young maiden: [...] "The likeness <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> be coincidental". Stravinsky himself gave contradictory accounts of the genesis of The Rite. In a 1920 article he stressed that the musical ideas had come first, that the pagan setting had been suggested by the music {{rather than the other way}} round. However, in his 1936 autobiography he described the origin of the work thus: [...] "One day , when I was finishing the last pages of L'Oiseau de Feu in St Petersburg, I had a fleeting vision... I saw in my imagination a solemn pagan rite: sage elders, seated in a circle, watching a young girl dance herself to death. They were sacrificing her to propitiate the god of Spring. Such was the theme of the Sacre du Printemps".|$|E
500|$|A {{common type}} (used in {{applications}} such as aircraft gun sights) uses a collimating lens and a beam splitter. This type tends to be bulky since it requires at least two optical components, the lens and the beam splitter/glass plate. The reticle collimation optics are situated at 90° to the optical path making lighting difficult, usually needing additional electric illumination, condensing lenses, etc. A more compact type replaces the lens/beam splitter configuration with a half silvered or dichroic curved collimating mirror set at an angle that performs both tasks of focusing and combining {{the image of an}} offset reticle. This type is most often seen as the red dot type used on small arms. It is also possible to place the reticle between the viewer and the curved mirror at the mirror's focus. The reticle itself <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the eye to be in focus but the curved mirror presents the viewer with an image of the reticle at infinity. This type was invented by Dutch optical engineer Lieuwe Van Albada in 1932, originally as a camera viewfinder, and was also used as a gunsight on World War II bazookas: the US M9 and M9A1 [...] "Bazooka" [...] featured the D7161556 folding [...] "Reflecting Sight Assembly".|$|E

2500|$|A {{dead heat}} is a tie between two or, rarely, more horses in a race.

When the judges could not determine the first horse over the finish line, the heat was declared [...] "dead", and did not count. Usually, a photo finish can determine the winner, but at times it <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> call.
