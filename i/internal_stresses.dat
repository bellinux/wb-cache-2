5|$|Martensite {{has a lower}} density (it expands {{during the}} cooling) than does austenite, so that the {{transformation}} between them results in a change of volume. In this case, expansion occurs. <b>Internal</b> <b>stresses</b> from this expansion generally {{take the form of}} compression on the crystals of martensite and tension on the remaining ferrite, with a fair amount of shear on both constituents. If quenching is done improperly, the <b>internal</b> <b>stresses</b> can cause a part to shatter as it cools. At the very least, they cause internal work hardening and other microscopic imperfections. It is common for quench cracks to form when steel is water quenched, although they may not always be visible.|$|E
5|$|Annealing is {{the process}} of heating the steel to a {{sufficiently}} high temperature to relieve local <b>internal</b> <b>stresses.</b> It does not create a general softening of the product but only locally relieves strains and stresses locked up within the material. Annealing goes through three phases: recovery, recrystallization, and grain growth. The temperature required to anneal a particular steel depends on the type of annealing to be achieved and the alloying constituents.|$|E
5|$|Because {{glass is}} very brittle in its solid state, {{it is often}} prone to {{cracking}} upon heating and cooling, especially if the heating and cooling are uneven. This is because the brittleness of glass {{does not allow for}} uneven thermal expansion. Glass that has been welded will usually need to be cooled very slowly and evenly through the glass transition, in a process called annealing, to relieve any <b>internal</b> <b>stresses</b> created by a temperature gradient.|$|E

5|$|Quenching {{involves}} {{heating the}} steel {{to create the}} austenite phase then quenching it in water or oil. This rapid cooling results in a hard but brittle martensitic structure. The steel is then tempered, {{which is just a}} specialized type of annealing, to reduce brittleness. In this application the annealing (tempering) process transforms some of the martensite into cementite, or spheroidite and hence it reduces the <b>internal</b> <b>stresses</b> and defects. The result is a more ductile and fracture-resistant steel.|$|E

40|$|The glide of a {{dislocation}} in {{a periodic}} <b>internal</b> <b>stress</b> field is simulated. The {{velocity of the}} dislocation is determined by its interaction with a unidimensional random array of short range obstacles. Allowance is made for both forward and backward thermal activation of the dislocation and the following rate determining processes are considered: 1. (i) sideways kink motion, 2. (ii) double kink nucleation and 3. (iii) node unpinning. The importance of backward activation in each case is examined and it is shown that backward activation is suppressed {{by the presence of}} the periodic <b>internal</b> <b>stress</b> field. Further, this effect is greater, the shorter the period of the <b>internal</b> <b>stress</b> field. From the distribution of residence times of the dislocation at the obstacles, the probability of finding a dislocation at any position in the <b>internal</b> <b>stress</b> field is computed. The application of this probability distribution to an assembly of non-interacting mobile dislocations allows the strain transient dip test to be simulated. It is found that the critical stress, at which the average dislocation velocity is zero, is the best estimate of the mean <b>internal</b> <b>stress</b> level. The effect of using the various measures of <b>internal</b> <b>stress</b> on the estimation of the forward activation area for glide is also discussed...|$|R

The amateur casting process is usually done through a temperature controlled glass fusing kiln, in which layers or chunks of glass (usually plate or borosilicate glass) are stacked on top of or around each other within a round mold specified to aperture size.

Proper annealing procedures ensure that <b>internal</b> <b>stresses</b> are relieved within the glass, which reduces risk of failure for the newly cast blank.|$|E

Theoretical arguments suggest the need to examine the impact stress originating outside the relationship (external stress) can have on relational well-being. External stress can spillover into the relationship causing <b>internal</b> <b>stress,</b> making stress a dyadic versus individualistic phenomenon. Using data from 131 couples, we examined whether <b>internal</b> <b>stress</b> may mediate the association between external stress and relationship satisfaction and how dyadic coping may moderate this relationship within one year. Dyadic coping was found to decrease the impact of chronic external <b>stress</b> on chronic <b>internal</b> <b>stress,</b> particularly in women.

During an impact, the <b>internal</b> <b>stress</b> of the quartz sand-filled steel tube column is subjected to not only axial force but also lateral confining force, resulting in complicated <b>internal</b> <b>stress.</b> A suitable sensor for monitoring the <b>internal</b> <b>stress</b> of such a structure under an impact is important for structural health monitoring. In this paper, piezoceramic Smart Aggregates (SAs) are embedded into a quartz Sand-Filled Steel Tube Column (SFSTC) to monitor the <b>internal</b> structural <b>stress</b> during impacts.

40|$|We {{define the}} voltage angle across {{an area of}} a power sys-tem to measure the area stress. The voltage angle across the area is a {{weighted}} combination of the voltage angles at all the buses along the border of an area. The area angle {{can be divided into}} two parts; one part is <b>internal</b> <b>stress</b> caused by power injections inside the area and the other part is external stress caused by power flows from other areas. The area angle can be monitored using voltage syn-chrophasor measurements at the border buses. If the cur-rents or powers flowing into the area at the border buses are also measured, then the <b>internal</b> <b>stress</b> angle can also be monitored. The <b>internal</b> <b>stress</b> angle changes when lines inside the area outage or when there is redispatch of power within the area.

40|$|Abstract Descriptions of high {{temperature}} creep deformation often use {{the concept of}} the effective stress, which includes the presence of the <b>internal</b> <b>stress.</b> Many experimental techniques have been applied to measure the <b>internal</b> <b>stress</b> induced by creep deformation.

This is partly because the distinction between <b>internal</b> <b>stress</b> and material <b>internal</b> resistance is unclear. In this paper, neutron diffraction measurements, undertaken using the spallation source at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, UK, are combined with in-situ loading to investigate the internal state of a Type 316 H stainless steel.
