Internally, the voice packets were sent over real-time protocol (RTP) streams. Traffic was generated in the network model only when the application is active; therefore, the traffic duration equaled the simulation duration.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} study of traffic {{behavior}} of two popular over-the-top (OTT) video streaming services (YouTube and Netflix). Our analysis is conducted on different mobile devices (iOS and Android) over various wireless networks (Wi-Fi, 3 G and LTE) under dynamic network conditions. Our measurements show that the video players frequently discard {{a large amount of}} video content although it is successfully delivered to a client. We first investigate the root cause of this unwanted behavior. Then, we propose a Quality-of-Service (QoS) -aware video streaming architecture in Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks to reduce the waste of network resource and improve user experience. The architecture includes a selective packet discarding mechanism, which can be placed in packet <b>data</b> <b>network</b> <b>gateways</b> (P-GW). In addition, our QoS-aware rules assist video players in selecting an appropriate resolution under a fluctuating channel condition. We monitor network condition and configure QoS parameters to control availability of the maximum bandwidth in real time. In our experimental setup, the proposed platform shows up to 20. 58 % improvement in saving downlink bandwidth and improves user experience by reducing buffer underflow period to an average of 32 seconds...|$|R
40|$|The current LTE network {{architecture}} is organized into very large regions, each having a core network and a radio access network. The core network contains an Internet edge com-prised of packet <b>data</b> <b>network</b> <b>gateways</b> (PGWs). The radio network consists of only base stations. There are minimal in-teractions among regions other than interference {{management at the}} edge. The current architecture has several problems. First, mobile application performance is seriously impacted {{by the lack of}} Internet egress points per region. Second, the continued exponential growth of mobile traffic puts tremen-dous pressure on the scalability of PGWs. Third, the fast growth of signaling traffic known as the signaling storm prob-lem poses a major challenge to the scalability of the control plane. To address these problems, we present SoftMoW, a recursive and reconfigurable cellular WAN architecture that supports seamlessly inter-connected core networks, reconfig-urable control plane, and global optimization. To scale the control plane nation-wide, SoftMoW recur-sively builds up the hierarchical control plane with novel abstractions of both control plane and data plane entities. To enable scalable end-to-end path setup, SoftMoW presents a novel label swapping mechanism such that each controller only operates on its logical topology and each switch along the path only sees at most one label. SoftMoW supports new network-wide optimization functions such as optimal routing and inter-region handover minimization. We demonstrate that SoftMoW improves the performance, flexibility and scalability of cellular WAN using real LTE network traces with thousands of base stations and millions of subscribers. Our evaluation shows that path inflation and inter-region handovers can be reduced by up to 60 % and 44 % respectively...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Distributed Mobility Management (DMM) is a {{mobility}} management solution, {{where the}} mobility anchors are distributed {{instead of being}} centralized. The use of DMM can be applied in cloud-based (virtualized) Long Term Evolution (LTE) mobile network environments to (1) provide session continuity to users across personal, local, and wide area networks without interruption and (2) support traffic redirection when a virtualized LTE entity like a virtualized Packet <b>Data</b> <b>Network</b> <b>Gateway</b> (P-GW) running on an virtualization platform is migrated to another virtualization platform and the on-going sessions supported by this P-GW need to be maintained. In this paper we argue that the enabling technology that can efficiently be used for supporting DMM in virtualized LTE systems is the Software Defined Networking (SDN) /OpenFlow technology. 1...|$|E

30|$|A {{particular}} {{application example}} of the proposed method is WiFi offloading [13]. WiFi offloading is {{an efficient way to}} address the rapid increase in data traffic that poses great challenges to current cellular networks. A notable cause is video streaming to smart phones and tablets. An offloading path may be established via a WiFi access point (AP) to transmit packets from the packet <b>data</b> <b>network</b> <b>gateway</b> (GW) to the user equipment (UE), forming a two-hop lossy path. A parallel path going from GW to UE via base-station (BS), which also forms a two-hop lossy path, {{may or may not be}} available simultaneously. The multi-path TCP (MPTCP) [14, 15] protocol can be used to seamlessly establish/close the two-hop connections. In [16], it has been shown that incorporating RLNC with MPTCP may achieve higher throughput than MPTCP without network coding when links are lossy. The “seen packet” concept proposed in [17] can be used to address the compatibility issue of network coding with TCP.|$|E

These networks operate at different communication speeds to reflect the relative response times of the connected control units. For example, engine control units are connected to a high-speed network while comfort systems such as electric seats are connected to a low speed network. In addition, {{there are a number of}} different network operating principles, for example, event-driven and timetriggered. Gateways are required to exchange data between these different vehicle <b>networks.</b> <b>Gateways</b> typically exchange messages between connected networks based solely on the destination and priority of the messages. Such gateways can result in unpredictable message delays depending on the network loading and vehicle operating conditions. The aim of this research is to develop and evaluate a vehicle <b>network</b> <b>gateway</b> model based on a very general and well designed gateway structure from the automotive industry, which takes into account factors such as the purpose of network messages, vehicle operating conditions, network loading, bus topology and message streams.

40|$|The 3 GPP Evolved Packet System (EPS) is the {{new system}} for mobile communications. Such system is {{composed}} at a radio access, called Long Term Evolution (LTE), and an IP backbone architecture called Evolved Packet Core (EPC). At high-level view, flows are rep- resented by bearers. A bearer is a virtual path that connects a user equipment to the egress gateway of the EPS, that is the Packet <b>Data</b> <b>Network</b> <b>Gateway</b> (PDN-GW). The topic investigated within this the- sis is how to route flows in the EPC so as to meet the QoS guarantees included in the bearer while optimizing network resources. In the EPC, bearer can be pre-empted when network resources are scarce. Therefore, route computation should also {{be judged by the}} number of pre-emptions that that it forces in the network. Three different routing optimization models with different behaviours were developed within this thesis which incorporate pre-emption in different ways. We have tested these models in realistic networks as the blocking proba- bility, pre-emption probability and time overhead. Our results show that the algorithms exhibits similar behaviours as the blocking and pre-emption probability. Moreover, blocking and pre-emption seems to be contrasting goals one is reduced at the expenses of the other. As for time overhead, computations on off-the-shelf hardware show that an optimization approach is compatible with a highly-dynamic large-scale environment...|$|E
40|$|The {{need for}} {{wireless}} multimedia communication motivates {{the development of}} the 4 G cellular wireless networks. To this end, the 4 G standard, Long Term Evolution (LTE), is specified by the 3 GPP. Especially, the local IP access (LIPA) function has been defined for a home base station (HeNB) to offload traffic from the core network as otherwise packets are always routed through the packet <b>data</b> <b>network</b> <b>gateway</b> which is located at the back-end side. Without the LIPA function, the packet routing in an LTE network is in a detour way, even if in the communication between two user equipments (UEs) attaching to the same HeNB. To implement the LIPA function, two solutions have been proposed in the literature. However, they still suffer from a few shortcomings. In this paper, we propose a novel solution, in which an additional bearer is responsible for local data packet detection and, once detected, is transformed into a data bearer for local data packet delivery. Qualitative analysis distinguishes our solution from the two previous solutions in several aspects. Simulation results show that our method outperforms the two solutions in terms of packet transmission delay and mean opinion score (MOS). An extension is proposed to provide local IP access for UEs attaching to different serving HeNBs which are yet in the same domain. Analytical results shows that applying the extension, the domain edge router can provide hundreds of VoIP connections with the local IP access service, which is ten times more than the two solutions in the literature can do. ...|$|E
40|$|Software-defined {{networking}} (SDN) {{and network}} function virtualization (NFV) {{have emerged as}} the most promising candidates for improving network function and protocol programmability and dynamic adjustment of network resources. On the one hand, SDN is responsible for providing an abstraction of network resources through well-defined application programming interfaces. This abstraction enables SDN to perform network virtualization, that is, to slice the physical infrastructure and create multiple coexisting application-specific virtual tenant networks (VTNs) with specific quality-of-service and service-level-agreement requirements, independent of the underlying optical transport technology and network protocols. On the other hand, the notion of NFV relates to deploying network functions that are typically deployed in specialized and dedicated hardware, as software instances [called virtual network functions (VNFs) ] running on commodity servers (e. g., in data centers) through software virtualization techniques. Despite all the attention that {{has been given to}} virtualizing IP functions (e. g., firewall; authentication, authorization, and accounting) or Long-Term Evolution control functions (e. g., mobility management entity, serving gateway, and packet <b>data</b> <b>network</b> <b>gateway),</b> some transport control functions can also be virtualized and moved to the cloud as a VNF. In this work we propose virtualizing the tenant SDN control functions of a VTN and moving them into the cloud. The control of a VTN is a key requirement associated with network virtualization, since it allows the dynamic programming (i. e., direct control and configuration) of the virtual resources allocated to the VTN. We experimentally assess and evaluate the first SDN/NFV orchestration architecture in a multipartner testbed to dynamically deploy independent SDN controller instances for each instantiated VTN and to provide the required connectivity within minutes...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Wireless-enabled {{processor}} modules {{intended for}} communicating low-frequency phenomena (i. e., temperature, hu-midity, and ambient light) have been enabled to acquire and trans-mit multiple biological signals in real time, {{which has been}} achieved by using computationally efficient data acquisition, filtering, and compression algorithms, and interfacing the modules with bio-logical interface hardware. The sensor modules can acquire and transmit raw biological signals {{at a rate of}} 32 kb/s, which is near the hardware limit of the modules. Furthermore, onboard signal pro-cessing enables one channel, sampled at a rate of 4000 samples/s at 12 -bit resolution, to be compressed via adaptive differential-pulse-code modulation (ADPCM) and transmitted in real time. In addition, the sensors can be configured to filter and transmit individual time-referenced “spike ” waveforms, or to transmit the spike height and width for alleviating network traffic and increas-ing battery life. The system is capable of acquiring eight channels of analog signals as well as data via an asynchronous serial connec-tion. A back-end server archives the biological <b>data</b> received via <b>networked</b> <b>gateway</b> sensors, and hosts them to a client application that enables users to browse recorded data. The system also ac-quires, filters, and transmits oxygen saturation and pulse rate via a commercial-off-the-shelf interface board. The system architecture can be configured for performing real-time nonobtrusive biological monitoring of humans or rodents. This paper demonstrates that low-power, computational, and bandwidth-constrained wireless-enabled platforms can indeed be leveraged for wireless biosignal monitoring.
