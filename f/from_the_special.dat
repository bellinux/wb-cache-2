5|$|The sensory {{nervous system}} is {{involved}} with the reception and processing of sensory information. This information is received through the cranial nerves, through tracts in the spinal cord, and directly at centres of the brain exposed to the blood. The brain also receives and interprets information <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>special</b> senses (vision, smell, hearing, and taste). Mixed motor and sensory signals are also integrated.|$|E

50|$|In the Studio is <b>the</b> {{third album}} <b>from</b> <b>The</b> <b>Specials,</b> {{released}} in 1984, {{long after the}} breakup of <b>the</b> original <b>Specials.</b> It charted in the UK Top 35.|$|R
5|$|It {{features}} guest appearances from Katie Couric, Art Smith, and Tony Bennett. Gaga performed stripped down, acoustic {{versions of}} four songs from her second studio album, Born This Way, {{along with two}} Christmas songs and a duet with Bennett. The special received critical acclaim and gave ABC its best ratings in four years for its respective time slot on Thanksgiving Day. At the 2012 Dorian Awards, the special was nominated {{in the category of}} Best TV Musical Program of the Year, but did not win the award. A live EP of performances <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>special,</b> titled A Very Gaga Holiday, was made available for purchase from the iTunes Store. The EP debuted on the Billboard 200 chart at number52.|$|E
5|$|There was {{a special}} {{appearance}} by Green Wing cast at the British Film Institute, on 17 January 2007. Pile, Greig, Mangan and Rhind-Tutt appeared. Some of the other writers, as well as Theobald and Heap, were in the audience. The event was hosted by John Lloyd. Green Wing appeared in an episode of the BBC documentary series Imagine, entitled A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Studio. Some of the funeral scenes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>special</b> were shown, and the presenter of the show, Alan Yentob, appeared {{as one of the}} mourners.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{initially}} agreeing {{to send troops}} to Borneo in the opening stages of the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation, the Australian government did allow its forces stationed in Malaysia {{as part of the}} Far East Strategic Reserve (FESR) to be used to protect Peninsular Malaysia from Indonesian attack. 3 RAR, which was based at Camp Terendak in Malacca, was subsequently used to mop up two small airborne and seaborne landings near Labis and Pontian in September and October 1964. These incursions suggested that a major escalation in the conflict was imminent, and in January 1965 the government conceded to British and Malaysian requests, subsequently agreeing to deploy an infantry battalion to Borneo, in addition to a battery of artillery, an engineer construction squadron, and a squadron <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Special</b> Air Service Regiment.|$|E

5000|$|Animation cels sold in <b>the</b> mid-1990s came <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>special's</b> {{animated}} Boba Fett segment. Segments of that cartoon {{appear in}} the 2002 Attack of the Clones web documentary [...] "Bucket Head" [...] and Jeremy Bulloch, who portrayed Fett in the original films, introduces the segment as coming <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Holiday <b>Special.</b> In 2004, <b>the</b> official Star Wars site confirmed that documentary filmmaker Kevin Burns was allowed access to the original print for use in his Empire of Dreams documentary; however, the segment using footage <b>from</b> <b>the</b> holiday <b>special</b> was ultimately {{left out of the}} final cut.|$|R
5000|$|Thugaboo has premiered two {{music videos}} using {{characters}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>specials,</b> [...] "Just Be U" [...] and [...] "Gimmie Gimmie." [...] Similar to Fat Albert, it teaches kids about moral lessons and virtues.|$|R
5|$|Andersen's {{auditors}} were {{pressured by}} Enron's management to defer recognizing the charges <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>special</b> purpose entities as its credit risks became known. Since the entities would never return a profit, accounting guidelines required that Enron {{should take a}} write-off, where {{the value of the}} entity was removed from the balance sheet at a loss. To pressure Andersen into meeting Enron's earnings expectations, Enron would occasionally allow accounting companies Ernst & Young or PricewaterhouseCoopers to complete accounting tasks to create the illusion of hiring a new company to replace Andersen. Although Andersen was equipped with internal controls to protect against conflicted incentives of local partners, it failed to prevent conflict of interest. In one case, Andersen's Houston office, which performed the Enron audit, was able to overrule any critical reviews of Enron's accounting decisions by Andersen's Chicago partner. In addition, after news of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigations of Enron were made public, Andersen would later shred several tons of relevant documents and delete nearly 30,000 e-mails and computer files, causing accusations of a cover-up.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for the landing orders were issued to ensure everyone was fit and to concentrate on weapons firing and street fighting. The two French troops were still under command and just for this operation No. 4 Commando took command of a section from the Dutch Troop, No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando, and groups <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Special</b> Boat Section (SBS), Royal Engineers and the Royal Artillery to call for artillery fire support. For some reason the old method of calling troops by {{letters of the alphabet}} was dropped and the troops were now numbered. The No.1 to No.4 Troops were British and No.s 5 and 6 French. The heavy weapons troop was No. 4 Troop. The final plan for the assault was for the SBS and a section from No. 1 Troop, to go first and reconnoitre a suitable landing point. Following them, the rest of No.1, No. 2 Troop and commando headquarters would secure the beachhead. They would then be joined by the remaining troops, passing through the beachhead and into the town. No.1 Troop would secure the left flank and No. 2 Troop the right.|$|E
5|$|On August 23, the modest-sized Austrian film {{industry}} {{came out with}} a talkie: G'schichten aus der Steiermark (Stories from Styria), an Eagle Film–Ottoton Film production. On September 30, the first entirely German-made feature-length dramatic talkie, Das Land ohne Frauen (Land Without Women), premiered. A Tobis Filmkunst production, about one-quarter of the movie contained dialogue, which was strictly segregated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>special</b> effects and music. The response was underwhelming. Sweden's first talkie, Konstgjorda Svensson (Artificial Svensson), premiered on October 14. Eight days later, Aubert Franco-Film came out with Le Collier de la reine (The Queen's Necklace), shot at the Épinay studio near Paris. Conceived as a silent film, it was given a Tobis-recorded score and a single talking sequence—the first dialogue scene in a French feature. On October 31, Les Trois masques debuted; a Pathé-Natan film, it is generally regarded as the initial French feature talkie, though it was shot, like Blackmail, at the Elstree studio, just outside London. The production company had contracted with RCA Photophone and Britain then had the nearest facility with the system. The Braunberger-Richebé talkie La Route est belle, also shot at Elstree, followed a few weeks later.|$|E
50|$|It was {{the last}} of five Berenstain Bears {{animated}} specials that aired on NBC from 1979 to 1983. Some of the production staff would continue to work on the next adaptation: The Berenstain Bears Show. This includes Joe Cates and Buzz Potamkin. Elliott Lawrence continues to score music for the episodes which are based on his compositions <b>from</b> <b>the</b> five <b>specials,</b> although faster pace. While they no longer break out in song, the theme music (matching part of Stars and Stripes Forever) resembles <b>the</b> song lyrics <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>specials.</b> <b>The</b> program is now produced by Southern Star with new voice actors.|$|R
50|$|Opposition reports {{specifically}} cited activity <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 556th <b>Special</b> Forces Regiment, {{but most}} frequently cited <b>the</b> 14th <b>Special</b> Forces Division generally. Activity was reported {{in different parts of}} the city during similar time-frames, suggesting that at least one additional regiment <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 14th <b>Special</b> Forces was involved in the Homs operation.|$|R
50|$|However, other U.S. special {{operation}} forces {{also have}} deployed to Afghanistan. Units that have {{deployed in the}} past have included elements of the 75th Ranger Regiment, Navy SEALs, units <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 160th <b>Special</b> Operations Aviation Regiment, squadrons <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Army's covert 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment—Delta, commonly known as Delta Force, air commandos <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Air Force <b>Special</b> Operations Command and Marines <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Marine <b>Special</b> Operations Command. CIA paramilitary teams also have served in Afghanistan.|$|R
5|$|On October 7, 1987, Collins {{called a}} special {{legislative}} session {{to close a}} deficit between state contributions to the worker's compensation Special Fund and disbursements. The Special Fund was designated for payments to workers with occupational diseases and workers whose work-related injuries could not be traced to any single employer. A plan proposed by Democratic state senator Ed O'Daniel was expected to {{provide the framework for}} legislation considered in the session. Under O'Daniel's plan, additional revenue for the Special Fund would be raised by increasing assessments on worker's compensation premiums for 30 years. Assessments for coal companies were increased more than those on other businesses because the majority of the claims paid <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Special</b> Fund were for black lung, a breathing disease common among coal miners; consequently, it was opposed by legislators from heavily coal-dependent counties. Nevertheless, after nine days of negotiations, a bill substantially similar to O'Daniel's original plan was approved by the legislature and signed by Collins.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} JNA tanks in Pakrac {{came too late}} to stop the Croatian special police from retaking the town. However, it {{prompted}} the remaining Serb rebels to begin shooting at the town from the surrounding hills. Shots were fired at a police vehicle on patrol. The policemen shot back at men retreating towards a JNA position, and the JNA shot at the police vehicle in return. The shooting ended when talks between Croatian member of the federal presidency Stjepan Mesić and JNA Colonel Aleksandar Vasiljević produced an agreement that the Croatian police {{would be allowed to}} retain control of the town. The JNA planned to retake control of Pakrac <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>special</b> police by force. The attack, codenamed Pakrac-91, was cancelled when the Croatian authorities agreed to withdraw the special police by the evening of 3 March. The JNA withdrew from Pakrac following a decision of the Yugoslav Presidency, abandoning the northern approaches to the town on 12 March, and pulling out completely seven days later.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{released}} in North America on June 7, 2011, in Europe on June 8, 2011, in Australia on June 9, 2011, in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Germany on June 10, 2011, and in Japan on July 7, 2011. On February 18, 2011, before the game's release, Special Edition and Hero Edition versions of Infamous 2 were announced for pre-order. The Special Edition included an Original Cole skin, a Golden Amp skin, and the Electrocution Grenade power. The Hero Edition included everything <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Special</b> Edition but also included: a Cole MacGrath statue, a sportable sling pack modeled after Cole’s, a Kessler skin, the Lightning Hook power, a Reaper skin, a Sly Cooper's cane skin, a samurai sword skin, a caveman club skin, the Infamous #1 comic, and Infamous 2 The Red Soundtrack.
