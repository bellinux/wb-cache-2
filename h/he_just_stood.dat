500|$|Rhys has praised Newfeld for his [...] "knowledge of pop {{and what}} makes people react" [...] stating that [...] "most of the time <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>stood</b> there by the desk" [...] and [...] "wouldn't accept a take until he was {{physically}} moved by it".|$|E
60|$|That answer smote him {{instantly}} still. Under {{the shock}} of it <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>stood</b> {{and stared at her}} again, his jaw fallen.|$|E
6000|$|... "At {{the end of}} {{the fifteen}} months she sends for him into the office. He didn't want telling by this time; <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>stood</b> with his hat in his hand and waited respectful like.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish I were. Do {{you know}} how a male newt proposes, Bertie? <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>stands</b> {{in front of the}} female newt {{vibrating}} his tail and bending his body in a semi-circle. I could do that on my head. No, you wouldn't find me grousing if I were a male newt." ...|$|R
5000|$|However, {{the most}} {{difficult}} guest to interact with, according to Newton was Vic Morrow in 1967. <b>He</b> would <b>just</b> <b>stand</b> there saying nothing, silently handing out the Logies. According to Bert, [...] "every so often, I'd say 'how are you going, Vic?' and <b>he</b> would <b>just</b> nod his head." ...|$|R
50|$|The mind {{must always}} be {{in the state of}} 'flowing,' for when it stops {{anywhere}} that means the flow is interrupted and it is this interruption that is injurious to the well-being of the mind. In the case of the swordsman, it means death. When the swordsman stands against his opponent, he is not to think of the opponent, nor of himself, nor of his enemy's sword movements. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>stands</b> there with his sword which, forgetful of all technique, is ready only to follow the dictates of the subconscious. The man has effaced himself as the wielder of the sword. When he strikes, it is not the man but the sword in the hand of the man's subconscious that strikes.|$|R
6000|$|No word said Wilding. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>stood</b> and stared, {{scarcely}} understanding, and in {{that moment}} they were joined by Richard. He seized Wilding by the arm. [...] "Blake has carried her off," [...] he cried.|$|E
60|$|The cabman {{climbed down}} off 'is box {{and looked in}} at the winder, and for over two minutes he couldn't speak a word. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>stood</b> there looking at Sam and getting purpler and purpler about the face.|$|E
60|$|Awhile <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>stood</b> there, {{his wits}} overthrown by sheer surprise. And then, {{when at last}} he moved, the {{thing he did was}} the last thing that I had looked for. Not to her did he turn; not to her, but to me, and he dropped on one knee before me.|$|E
50|$|After the credits, a short {{epilogue}} involves Death {{stopping the}} limo {{in a dark}} space {{and looking at the}} heavens. He claims that <b>he</b> <b>just</b> couldn't <b>stand</b> Thane and had to return him to life. He adds that he isn't ever coming back for Thane, implying that Thane may have just accidentally become immortal.|$|R
5000|$|According to his widow, he {{had been}} {{participating}} in popular demonstrations since Egypt’s January uprising. “During sit-ins at Tahrir Square, {{he would go to}} work in the morning and spend the night in the square. He wasn’t able to join the Cabinet sit-in, but when he saw violence, <b>he</b> couldn’t <b>just</b> <b>stand</b> and watch people dying, so he went down to the protest.” ...|$|R
60|$|No one {{appeared}} to notice his coming, and <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>just</b> {{back of the}} crowd, taking in everything {{so far as it}} concerned Allen.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{explains}} why I couldn't make him understand. What asses these Frenchmen are. They don't seem able {{to grasp the}} simplest thing. You'd have thought if a chap saw a chap on a skylight, the chap would realize the chap wanted to be let in. But no, <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>stood</b> there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh! Sibby said <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>stood</b> in the doorway, {{lifted his}} hat as the funeral passed and then well-nigh carried Mamma, {{with the baby}} (that was Fulbert) in her arms, over the threshold, and smiled at her, saying, [...] "Well, mother, what better than to have found our home till death!" [...] So you see he did believe in it.' ...|$|E
60|$|At {{any rate}} he calmed down Aunt Dahlia, the nearest {{thing to a}} {{charging}} rhinoceros, in under five seconds. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>stood</b> there looking respectful, and though I didn't time the thing--not having a stop-watch on me--I should say it wasn't more than three seconds and a quarter before her whole manner underwent an astounding change for the better. She melted before one's eyes.|$|E
50|$|While at school, a bully named Carl Rudnick {{makes fun of}} Andrew {{because he}} only stands on the side during recess and does not talk to the other children. During a game of baseball, when another child hits the ball in Andrew's direction, <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>stands</b> there and lets the ball {{fall to the ground}} and roll away. This makes Carl furious and he yells at Andrew, who {{responds}} by urinating on Carl. The principal calls both Gail and Carl's mother. Mrs. Rudnick calls Andrew a freak and says that he should not be in public school, even yelling at Andrew after he apologizes. After Carl and his mother leave, Gail has a discussion with the principal. He wants to hold Andrew back, but she refuses and takes him out of the school.|$|R
50|$|Famous and much-painted episodes {{include his}} {{fight with the}} Prophet Moses (Musa), and his fishing and frying of whales, while <b>he</b> <b>stands</b> <b>just</b> about knee-deep in the ocean.|$|R
6000|$|Gertrude Oliver {{looked at}} him from her corner and shivered again. She had enjoyed the party herself, after all, for she had foregathered with a Charlottetown {{acquaintance}} who, being a stranger and much older {{than most of the}} guests, felt himself rather out of it, and had been glad to fall in with this clever girl who could talk of world doings and outside events with the zest and vigour of a man. In the pleasure of his society she had forgotten some of her misgivings of the day. Now they suddenly returned to her. What news did Jack Elliott bring? Lines from an old poem flashed unbidden into her mind--"there was a sound of revelry by night"--"Hush! Hark! A deep sound strikes like a rising knell"--why should she think of that now? Why didn't Jack Elliott speak--if he had anything to tell? Why did <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>stand</b> there, glowering importantly? ...|$|R
60|$|Now, when Bowser {{used that}} great deep voice of his, he was {{accustomed}} to seeing all the little meadow people and forest folk run, but this stranger did not even hurry. Bowser was so surprised that <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>stood</b> still and stared. Then he growled his deepest growl. Still the stranger {{paid no attention to}} him. Bowser {{did not know what to}} make of it.|$|E
60|$|He was {{grave and}} pale now, and looked decidedly {{more like the}} novel heroes whom she admired, but he neither slapped his {{forehead}} nor tramped about the room as they did. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>stood</b> looking at her so wistfully, so tenderly, that she found her heart relenting in spite of herself. What would have happened next I cannot say, if Aunt March had not come hobbling in at this interesting minute.|$|E
6000|$|... "Willie {{was sure}} dandy-looking in his uniform, with medals strung on his breast {{and his new}} gold-handled sword. You'd never have taken him for the little white-headed snipe that the girls used to order about and make fun of. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>stood</b> there for a minute, looking at Myra with a {{peculiar}} little smile on his face; {{and then he says}} to her, slow, and kind of holding on to his words with his teeth: ...|$|E
5000|$|In December 2015, it was {{revealed}} that producers were lining up a plot which would see Sally team up with her neighbours in a bid to tackle several issues in the area. Sally Dynevor, told Inside Soap: [...] "There is no sign of Sally's ambition waning - {{she is going to be}} taking on local politics in 2016. Tim isn't bothered at all. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>stands</b> behind her, raising eyebrows. But it's a great storyline - we've already started filming it and it has been really fun. Sally has Ken, Norris and Mary on board with her - so I reckon she is going to do quite well!" [...] Backing the storyline, Dynevor admitted that she is delighted with the direction Sally is going in at the moment. It has been great to have such lovely feedback from everyone," [...] she said. [...] "The scriptwriters are writing so much comedy for Sally right now and I love it - long may it continue." ...|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Jake, who {{has formed}} a crush on a girl in his class, runs away upset when he discovers that she prefers another boy <b>just</b> because <b>he</b> has a ponytail. Dennis, upon being {{informed}} by a frantic Libby, tracks him down and explains {{to him that he}} will find many things he does not like in his life and <b>he</b> should <b>just</b> <b>stand</b> up to them and face them, rather than running away. Having made that mistake himself, he decides to race after all.|$|R
5000|$|Birdie {{points out}} that it is {{dangerous}} to cross tracks, especially on bridges and tunnels, the latter of which finally convinces Sly Fox about the dangers of railroads (he is run over in the process, to which he replies [...] "If I weren't a cartoon character, I'd be dead as a doornail.") Sly now decides that <b>he</b> would <b>just</b> <b>stand</b> and wave at the train as it goes by; Birdie {{points out that}} he shouldn't be too close, pointing out that they could be carrying heavy objects.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you know, {{any other}} man to take water {{the way he did}} from Butch--why, {{everybody}}'d despise him. But not Billy. You see, he can afford to. He's got a rep as a fighter, an' when <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>stood</b> back 'an' let Butch have his way, everybody knew he wasn't scared, or backin' down, or anything. He didn't care a rap for Lily Sanderson, that was all, an' anybody could see she was just crazy after him." ...|$|E
60|$|Dale divined {{what he had}} suspected. Helen's {{sister had}} been carried off. Yet, while his quick mind grasped Helen's broken spirit--the {{unbalance}} that was reason for this marvelous and glorious act--he did not take other meaning of the embrace to himself. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>stood</b> there, transported, charged like a tree struck by lightning, making sure with all his keen senses, {{so that he could}} feel forever, how she was clinging round his neck, her face over his bursting heart, her quivering form close pressed to his.|$|E
6000|$|Kennicott was suspicious, but Aunt Bessie, {{serving the}} {{floating}} island pudding, agreed, [...] "Yes, it is wonderful. Folks {{can get away}} with all sorts of meannesses and sins in these terrible cities, but they can't here. I was noticing this tailor fellow this morning, and when Mrs. Riggs offered to share her hymn-book with him, he shook his head, and all the while we was singing <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>stood</b> there like a bump on a log and never opened his mouth. Everybody says he's got an idea that he's got so much better manners and all than what the rest of us have, but if that's what he calls good manners, I want to know!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Formerly {{known as}} [...] "Ned," [...] this Tusko {{was a giant}} circus {{elephant}} captured at age 6 in Siam (now Thailand). <b>He</b> <b>stood</b> <b>just</b> five feet high when he was unloaded from a sailing ship at New York harbor in 1898.|$|R
60|$|That {{put an end}} to Peter's hope of a nap. He shivered as {{he thought}} of what might happen to him if Jimmy Skunk should catch him. What with his aches and pains from the stings of the Yellow Jackets, and fear of being caught by Jimmy Skunk, it was quite {{impossible}} to sleep. He was almost ready to face those Yellow Jackets rather than wait and meet Jimmy Skunk. Twice he started up the long hall, but turned back. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> couldn't <b>stand</b> any more stings. He was miserable. Yes, Sir, he was miserable and most uncomfortable in both body and mind.|$|R
60|$|Her {{voice was}} plaintive. Remorse smote Wally. It {{occurred}} to him that he had not been sufficiently sympathetic. Not a word had he said on the subject of her change of fortunes. <b>He</b> had <b>just</b> <b>stood</b> and gaped and asked questions. After all, what the devil did it matter how she came to be here? He had anticipated a long and tedious search for her through the labyrinth of New York, and here Fate had brought her to his very door, and {{all he could do was}} to ask why, instead of being thankful. He perceived that he was not much of a fellow.|$|R
60|$|At any rate, Spot wouldn’t work. We paid {{a hundred}} and ten dollars for him {{from the bottom of}} our sack, and he wouldn’t work. He wouldn’t even tighten the traces. Steve spoke to him the first time we put him in harness, and he sort of shivered, that was all. Not an ounce on the traces. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>stood</b> still and wobbled, like so much jelly. Steve touched him with the whip. He yelped, but not an ounce. Steve touched him again, a bit harder, and he howled—the regular long wolf howl. Then Steve got mad and gave him half a dozen, and I came on the run from the tent.|$|E
60|$|Now, if Wilton had had any {{inductive}} {{reasoning in}} his composition at all, {{he would have}} been tremendously elated. A girl does not creep out to a distant cove at Marois Bay unless she is unhappy; and if Mary Campbell was unhappy she must be unhappy about him; and if she was unhappy about him {{all he had to do}} was to show a bit of determination and get the whole thing straightened out. But Wilton, whom grief had reduced to the mental level of an oyster, did not reason this out; and the sight of her deprived him of practically all his faculties, including speech. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>stood</b> there and yammered.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Billie emphatically. [...] "I {{think the}} most terrible {{thing in the world}} is a man who tries to {{entertain}} when he can't. Did I tell you about the man on board ship, father, at the ship's concert? Oh, it was the most awful thing you ever saw. Everybody was talking about it!" [...] She beamed round the table, and there was a note of fresh girlish gaiety in her voice. [...] "This man got up to do an imitation of somebody--nobody knows to this day who it was meant to be--and he came into the saloon and directly he saw the audience he got stage fright. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>stood</b> there gurgling and not saying a word, and then suddenly his nerve failed him altogether and he turned and tore out of the room like a rabbit. He absolutely ran! And he hadn't said a word! It was the most ridiculous exhibition I've ever seen!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Lin Chong resembles Zhang Fei in appearance. <b>He</b> <b>stands</b> <b>just</b> {{over six}} chi, with glaring {{eyes and a}} head like a panther's. He is thus nicknamed [...] "Panther Head". Before {{becoming}} an outlaw, Lin Chong served as a martial arts instructor of the Imperial Guards in the capital, Dongjing (東京; present-day Kaifeng, Henan).|$|R
60|$|Rosier lingered {{a moment}} till Pansy came in sight {{on the arm}} of her cavalier; <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>just</b> long enough to look her in the face. Then he walked away, holding up his head; {{and the manner in which}} he {{achieved}} this sacrifice to expediency convinced Isabel he was very much in love.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the plot}} progresses, another woman, Rita Peralto, catches Al's attention. She {{is the local}} singer at the saloon and also the most {{beautiful}} woman in town. Al believes <b>he</b> may <b>just</b> <b>stand</b> a chance, until a dashing Spaniard by the name of Antonio Bandanna breezes into town and begins upstaging him at every turn. Al soon discovers the legend of a lost gold mine somewhere out in the desert and sets out to find it, believing that if he can obtain the money that Rita needs to cure her financial troubles, then he can prove himself and his sincerity to her once and for all. The only thing Al didn't count on, was the mine being haunted! ...|$|R
