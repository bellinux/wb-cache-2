500|$|Annie and Kroknes became romantically involved, {{and began}} to {{collaborate}} musically. Annie's talent for writing melodies and vocals worked well with Kroknes's production skills. Annie launched her solo singing career in 1999 with the single [...] "Greatest Hit". The song was recorded after Annie played Madonna's song [...] "Everybody" [...] for Kroknes, who was experiencing a creative block at the time. Kroknes sampled the song, and Annie started to sing a melody to it. They recorded and released the song under the Tellé label. The song saw a limited release of 500 7-inch singles, which sold out in two days. [...] "Greatest Hit" [...] became an underground club hit in Norway and Britain, and Annie received offers for record contracts. Annie reflects that she and Kroknes had recorded the song [...] "for fun", but {{with the success of}} the single, Annie says, [...] "I realized that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>actually</b> make a living out of this." ...|$|E

There he said he told a producer, [...] "I don't know why you hired me, because you haven't given me anything. I just don't think this stuff's going to be good". He also said he felt [...] "kind of trapped in that material" [...] {{and that there was}} [...] "no way out". He also admitted to a post-ceremony fight on Twitter with longtime Oscars writer Bruce Vilanch. When Vilanch intimated that the busy actor appeared less than fully committed to the job, Franco posted a photo {{of the two of them}} together graffiti-ed saying [...] "James Fucked up the oscars. Trust me, I KNOW comedy. I mean, come on, I write for Bette Midler". Franco explained to Playboy that [...] "I personally do not do my best thinking when I'm angry. Before Twitter, I always had that buffer period when <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>actually</b> think and decide, Is this worth it? ... For me Twitter is a dangerous thing".|$|E

60|$|We {{returned}} again. The {{two children}} were {{peering into the}} thick corn also. We thought there was nothing more. George began to mow. As I walked round I caught sight of a rabbit skulking near the bottom corner of the patch. Its ears lay pressed against its back; <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see the palpitation of the heart under the brown fur, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see the shining dark eyes looking at me. I felt no pity for it, but still <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>actually</b> hurt it. I beckoned to the father. He ran up, and aimed a blow with the rake. There was a sharp little cry which sent a hot pain through me as if I had been cut. But the rabbit ran out, and instantly I forgot the cry, and gave pursuit, fairly feeling my fingers stiffen to choke it. It was all lame. Leslie was upon it in a moment, and he almost pulled its head off in his excitement to kill it.|$|R
2500|$|In 1999, Forsyth {{published}} The Phantom of Manhattan, {{a sequel}} to The Phantom of the Opera. It {{was intended as a}} departure from his usual genre; Forsyth's explanation was that [...] "I had done mercenaries, assassins, Nazis, murderers, terrorists, special forces soldiers, fighter pilots, you name it, and I got to think, <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> write about the human heart?" [...] However, it did not achieve the same success as his other novels, and he subsequently returned to modern-day thrillers.|$|R
5000|$|In a re-enacted {{scene in}} Anders Østergaard's {{documentary}} 1989, Prime Minister Németh tells an aide, [...] "Gyuri, <b>I</b> think this <b>could</b> <b>actually</b> {{be a very}} good thing. I think it would be good if some of the East Germans used this opportunity and fled." [...] "Fled?" [...] "Yes. And we would not interfere with it." [...] "I see." [...] Németh explained in the documentary: This was really a great opportunity to us to assess the Russians’ reactions, to test the tolerance of the Soviet Union. So we sent out an order to the border troops: [...] "Please instruct your guards, if you see any East Germans on the border, let them pass. Do not intervene." ...|$|R
2500|$|According to Pearce:"In 1986 whilst {{staying with}} Tibet in his flat in Freya Aswynn's house in north London {{over a period}} of 3 nights I dreamed I was falling in a sort of rain of indistinct runes. On each {{separate}} night I managed to concentrate enough on one particular rune to stop it from spinning and moving so <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>actually</b> see which one it was. When I awoke I made a note of it. After 3 nights the dream stopped and I decided to try and form an 'appropriate' bind rune from the original 3. This I did and after Freya saw it I basically was given a 'thumbs up' about the whole thing. It definitely does not refer to my name but it definitely does refer to ME." ...|$|E

We sailors are not as easily deceived as that would show. It is true, however, that a fleet might well stand in one direction, until far enough off the land or covered by night, when it might change its course suddenly, in an {{opposite}} direction; {{and it is possible}} the Comte de Vervillin has adopted some such stratagem. If he actually knew of the intention to throw German troops into the island, it is even quite probable. In that case, for one, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>actually</b> wish him success!" ...|$|E
500|$|Iron Man and Iron Man 2 {{director}} Jon Favreau said in December 2010 that {{he would}} not direct Iron Man 3, opting to direct Magic Kingdom instead. He remained an executive producer of director Joss Whedon's crossover film The Avengers and also served as an executive producer of Iron Man 3. Also in 2010, Downey reached out to Shane Black, who directed him in 2005's Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, to write and direct the film. In February 2011, Black entered final negotiations to join the project, and in March it was announced that Drew Pearce, who Marvel had originally hired for a Runaways script, would work with Black on the script. Downey said, [...] "Bringing in Shane Black to write and direct Iron Man 3 to me is basically the only transition from Favreau to a 'next thing' that Favreau and the audience and Marvel and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> ever <b>actually</b> sign off on." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{talked a}} good deal with Mr. Poplington about the hotels of Buxton, and we had agreed to go to one called the Old Hall, where we are now. There was a good many reasons why we chose this house, one being {{that it was not}} as {{expensive}} as some of the others, though very nice; and another, which had {{a good deal}} of force with me, was, that Mary Queen of Scots came here for her rheumatism, and the room she used to have is still kept, with some words she scratched with her diamond ring on the window-pane. Sometimes people coming to this hotel can get this room, and I was mighty sorry we couldn't do it, but it was taken. If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have <b>actually</b> lived and slept in a room which had belonged to the beautiful Mary Queen of Scots, I would have been willing to have just as much rheumatism as she had when she was here.|$|R
40|$|When I am weaving I {{listen to}} music and notice that my hands and feet fall into a rhythm. This {{connection}} reminds me of playing the piano. I took {{a closer look at}} weaving drafts; the movement of the threading setup reminded me of the notes on musical scores. This relationship inspired me to see what textures <b>I</b> <b>could</b> achieve by <b>actually</b> weaving the musical notes. The focus of my study is the exploration of the relationships between weaving and music utilizing elements and principles found in both, such as: color, texture, form, repetition, rhythm, and time. Both music and color produce emotional responses and will be taken into consideration within the weavings...|$|R
60|$|It {{went down}} at an acute angle for some fifty feet, the floor being covered with broken stone. Thence there {{extended}} a long, straight passage {{cut in the}} solid rock. I am no geologist, but the lining of this corridor was certainly of some harder material than limestone, for there were points where <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>actually</b> see the tool-marks which the old miners had left in their excavation, as fresh {{as if they had}} been done yesterday. Down this strange, old-world corridor I stumbled, my feeble flame throwing a dim circle of light around me, which made the shadows beyond the more threatening and obscure. Finally, I came to a spot where the Roman tunnel opened into a water-worn cavern--a huge hall, hung with long white icicles of lime deposit. From this central chamber I could dimly perceive that a number of passages worn by the subterranean streams wound away into the depths of the earth. I was standing there wondering whether I had better return, or whether I dare venture farther into this dangerous labyrinth, when my eyes fell upon something at my feet which strongly arrested my attention.|$|E
60|$|To do {{the young}} scoundrel justice, {{when he came}} among us, he was a manly noble-looking lad, and {{everything}} in his bearing and appearance betokened the high blood from which he came. He was the very portrait {{of some of the}} dark cavaliers of the Lyndon race, whose pictures hung in the gallery at Hackton: where the lad was fond of spending the chief part of his time, occupied with the musty old books which he took out of the library, and which I hate to see a young man of spirit poring over. Always in my company he preserved the most rigid silence, and a haughty scornful demeanour; which was so much the more disagreeable because there was nothing in his behaviour <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>actually</b> take hold of to find fault with: although his whole conduct was insolent and supercilious to the highest degree. His mother was very much agitated at receiving him on his arrival; if he felt any such agitation he certainly did not show it. He made her a very low and formal bow when he kissed her hand; and, when I held out mine, put both his hands behind his back, stared me full in the face, and bent his head, saying, 'Mr. Barry Lyndon, I believe;' turned on his heel, and began talking {{about the state of the}} weather to his mother, whom he always styled 'Your Ladyship.' She was angry at this pert bearing, and, when they were alone, rebuked him sharply for not shaking hands with his father.|$|E

Since I saw you I have suffered the torments of the lost. Saturday evening I had a sudden call, by telegraph, and took the night train for Boston. The occasion was {{the death of a}} valued old friend who had requested that I should preach his funeral sermon. I took my seat in the cars and set myself to framing the discourse. But I never got beyond the opening paragraph; for then the train started and the car-wheels began their 'clack, clack-clack-clack-clack! clack-clack!--clack-clack-clack!' and right away those odious rhymes fitted themselves to that accompaniment. For an hour I sat there and set a syllable of those rhymes to every separate and distinct clack the car-wheels made. Why, I was as fagged out, then, as if I had been chopping wood all day. My skull was splitting with headache. It seemed to me that I must go mad if I sat there any longer; so I undressed and went to bed. I stretched myself out in my berth, and--well, you know what the result was. The thing went right along, just the same. 'Clack-clack clack, a blue trip slip, clack-clack-clack, for an eight-cent fare; clack-clack-clack, a buff trip slip, clack clack-clack, for a six-cent fare, and so on, and so on, and so on punch {{in the presence of the}} passenjare!' Sleep? Not a single wink! I was almost a lunatic when I got to Boston. Don't ask me about the funeral. I did the best I could, but every solemn individual sentence was meshed and tangled and woven in and out with 'Punch, brothers, punch with care, punch in the presence of the passenjare.' And the most distressing thing was that my delivery dropped into the undulating rhythm of those pulsing rhymes, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>actually</b> catch absent-minded people nodding time to the swing of it with their stupid heads. And, Mark, you may believe it or not, but before I got through the entire assemblage were placidly bobbing their heads in solemn unison, mourners, undertaker, and all. The moment I had finished, I fled to the anteroom in a state bordering on frenzy. Of course it would be my luck to find a sorrowing and aged maiden aunt of the deceased there, who had arrived from Springfield too late to get into the church. She began to sob, and said:-- ...|$|E

Using traditional tools - hammer and chisel - he molded each single stone to suit the whole composition. As a result, this work reflects sculptural techniques which parallel natural transformations in stone. The artist's stratification of stones echoes natural conversions of matter.|$|R

The astronomers tell us that our whole solar system is dying; that, barring accidents, it will all be so cold that no life can live upon it. Very well. In that day all men will be accomplished levitationists, and they will leave this perishing planet and seek more hospitable worlds. How can levitation be accomplished? By progressive fasts. Yes, I have tried them, and toward the end <b>I</b> <b>could</b> feel myself <b>actually</b> getting lighter." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{were the}} only {{visitors}} who had entered the Torture Tower that morning--so at least said the old custodian--and as we had the place all to ourselves {{were able to make}} a minute and more satisfactory survey than would have otherwise been possible. The custodian, looking to us as the sole source of his gains for the day, was willing to meet our wishes in any way. The Torture Tower is truly a grim place, even now when many thousands of visitors have sent a stream of life, and the joy that follows life, into the place; but at the time I mention it wore its grimmest and most gruesome aspect. The dust of ages seemed to have settled on it, and the darkness and the horror of its memories seem to have become sentient {{in a way that would}} have satisfied the Pantheistic souls of Philo or Spinoza. The lower chamber where we entered was seemingly, in its normal state, filled with incarnate darkness; even the hot sunlight streaming in through the door seemed to be lost in the vast thickness of the walls, and only showed the masonry rough as when the builder's scaffolding had come down, but coated with dust and marked here and there with patches of dark stain which, if walls could speak, could have given their own dread memories of fear and pain. We were glad to pass up the dusty wooden staircase, the custodian leaving the outer door open to light us somewhat on our way; for to our eyes the one long-wick'd, evil-smelling candle stuck in a sconce on the wall gave an inadequate light. When we came up through the open trap in the corner of the chamber overhead, Amelia held on to me so tightly that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>actually</b> feel her heart beat. I must say for my own part that I was not surprised at her fear, for this room was even more gruesome than that below. Here there was certainly more light, but only just sufficient to realise the horrible surroundings of the place. The builders of the tower had evidently intended that only they who should gain the top should have any of the joys of light and prospect. There, as we had noticed from below, were ranges of windows, albeit of mediaeval smallness, but elsewhere in the tower were only a very few narrow slits such as were habitual in places of mediaeval defence. A few of these only lit the chamber, and these so high up in the wall that from no part could the sky be seen through the thickness of the walls. In racks, and leaning in disorder against the walls, were a number of headsmen's swords, great double-handed weapons with broad blade and keen edge. Hard by were several blocks whereon the necks of the victims had lain, with here and there deep notches where the steel had bitten through the guard of flesh and shored into the wood. Round the chamber, placed in all sorts of irregular ways, were many implements of torture which made one's heart ache to see--chairs full of spikes which gave instant and excruciating pain; chairs and couches with dull knobs whose torture was seemingly less, but which, though slower, were equally efficacious; racks, belts, boots, gloves, collars, all made for compressing at will; steel baskets in which the head could be slowly crushed into a pulp if necessary; watchmen's hooks with long handle and knife that cut at resistance--this a speciality of the old Nurnberg police system; and many, many other devices for man's injury to man. Amelia grew quite pale with the horror of the things, but fortunately did not faint, for being a little overcome she sat down on a torture chair, but jumped up again with a shriek, all tendency to faint gone. We both pretended that it was the injury done to her dress by the dust of the chair, and the rusty spikes which had upset her, and Mr. Hutcheson acquiesced in accepting the explanation with a kind-hearted laugh.|$|E

[...] She got her start in early 2011 where she would make {{appearances}} on the pheriphry of wrestling - ring announcing, acting as referee, selling tickets and merchandise. She was also paired up with Cody Deaner at NEO Wrestling, whom she acted as a manager for. Vaughan received some early training from Derek Wylde, but conflicting schedules made it difficult to steadily train. She made her in-ring debut in September 2011 against Cherry Bomb; that same month, she won an essay contest arranged by former pro-wrestler Edge which has as its prize a scholarship for training at Squared Circle Training in Toronto.|$|R
