30|$|The M-current is able {{to provide}} {{subthreshold}} homeostasis {{as long as the}} external current is in the theta frequency band or slower. We show this by simulating an averaged system and observe that the homeostatic effect gradually wears off as the frequency of external current increases, which results in the loss of entrainment. The mechanism of M-current in the spiking regime is more complex. We first examine the phase plane of a reduced model to show that when the oscillator with M-current receives pulses, the reset point is farther away from the <b>knee</b> of the <b>voltage</b> nullcline (in a vicinity of the slow manifold created by the M-current) than when there is no pulse. This is due to pulse-triggered spikes having a larger amplitude and therefore generating a bigger amount of M-current than autonomous spikes. Hence, after an external pulse triggers a spike, it takes the oscillator longer than its natural interspike interval to generate the next spike, allowing the cell to be able to follow a rhythm slower than its natural frequency. Without the M-current, there is no slow manifold; the interspike intervals are the same with autonomous spikes and triggered spikes. Next, utilizing geometric singular perturbation theory, we study a network of an input cell (E-cell) forcing an oscillator with an inhibitory autapse (I-cell). Considering dynamics in the singular limit of the slow timescale, two relevant fold structures exist: the E-fold determines the spiking of the E-cell and the I-fold determines the spiking of the I-cell. Our results show that the presence of an M-current alters the position of the I-fold such that the singular orbit of limit cycle always reaches the E-fold first, allowing the I-cell to be driven precisely (i.e., sparsely entrained) by the E-cell (external pulses). While the reduced model tells us that the interspike interval is lengthened due to the position of reset point and the slow manifold created by the M-current, the geometric singular perturbation analysis tells us that the fold is also further away from the trajectory when the M-current is stronger.|$|R
