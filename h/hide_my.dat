[...] "So it came to pass, at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made. Then he sent out a raven, which kept going to and fro until the waters had dried up from the earth. He also sent out from himself a dove, to see if the waters had receded {{from the face of the}} ground." [...] The raven is mentioned a dozen times in the Bible. In the New Testament Jesus tells a parable using the raven to show how people should rely on God for their needs and not riches (...) [...] The raven is also mentioned in Quran at the story of Cain and Abel. Adam's firstborn son Cain kills his brother Abel but he doesn't know what to do with the corpse: [...] "Then Allah sent a raven scratching up the ground, to show him how to hide his brother's naked corpse. He said: Woe unto me! Am I not able to be as this raven and so <b>hide</b> <b>my</b> brother's naked corpse? And he became repentant." ...|$|E

500|$|In September 2000, {{she joined}} the ABT Studio Company, which is ABT's second company, and {{became a member of}} its Corps de ballet in 2001. As part of the Studio Company, she {{performed}} the Pas de Deux in Tchaikovsky's The Sleeping Beauty. Eight months after joining the company, she was sidelined for nearly a year by a lumbar stress fracture. When Copeland joined the company, she weighed [...] (she is [...] tall). At age 19, her puberty had been delayed, a situation common in ballet dancers. After the lumbar fracture, her doctor told her that inducing puberty would help to strengthen her bones, and he prescribed birth control pills. Copeland recalls that in one month she gained 10 pounds, and her small breasts swelled to double D-cup size: [...] "Leotards had to be altered for me ... to cover my cleavage, for instance. I hated this sign that I was different from the others. ... I became so self-conscious that, {{for the first time in}} my life, I couldn’t dance strong. I was too busy trying to <b>hide</b> <b>my</b> breasts." [...] Management noticed and called her in to talk about her body. The professional pressure to conform to conventional ballet aesthetics resulted in body image struggles and a binge eating disorder. Copeland says that, over the next year, new friendships outside of ABT, including with Victoria Rowell and her boyfriend, Olu Evans, helped her to regain confidence in her body. She explained, [...] "My curves became an integral part of who I am as a dancer, not something I needed to lose to become one. I started dancing with confidence and joy, and soon the staff at ABT began giving me positive feedback again. And I think I changed everyone’s mind about what a perfect dancer is supposed to look like." [...] During her years in the corps, as the only Black woman in the company, Copeland also felt the burden of her ethnicity in many ways and contemplated a variety of career choices. Recognizing that Copeland's isolation and self-doubt were standing in the way of her talent, ABT's artistic director, Kevin McKenzie, asked writer and arts figure Susan Fales-Hill, then vice-chair of ABT's Board of Directors, to mentor Copeland. Fales-Hill introduced Copeland to Black women trailblazers who encouraged Copeland and helped her to gain perspective.|$|E

2500|$|Maimonides {{taught that}} Scripture employs {{the idea of}} God's hiding God's face to {{designate}} the manifestation of a certain work of God. Thus, Moses the prophet foretold misfortune by saying (in God's words in [...] ), [...] "And I will <b>hide</b> <b>My</b> face from them, and they shall be devoured." [...] For, Maimonides interpreted, when people are deprived of Divine protection, {{they are exposed to}} all dangers, and become the victim of circumstance, their fortune dependent on chance — a terrible threat. Further, Maimonides taught that the hiding of God's face results from human choice. When people do not meditate on God, they are separated from God, and they are then exposed to any evil that might befall them. For, Maimonides taught, the intellectual link with God secures the presence of Providence and protection from evil accidents. Maimonides argued that this principle applies equally to an individual person and a whole community.|$|E

2500|$|He then {{conducted}} an eight-year {{study of the}} effects of unemployment in local New Haven, Connecticut, and published two works – The Unemployed Worker and Citizens Without Work – in 1940 from that study. [...] Bakke focused not just on the economic characteristics of unemployment but also on the social and psychological consequences and costs from it. [...] As such, Bakke became known for the sensitivity which he brought to this subject. [...] He emphasized the distaste the unemployed often had in applying for government relief, as illustrated by quotes like [...] "I'd rather be dead and buried" [...] and, when another was ultimately compelled to do so, [...] "I would <b>hide</b> <b>my</b> face in the ground and pound the earth." [...] The 2004 Encyclopedia of the Great Depression states that Bakke's New Haven study stands [...] "as a powerful statement of the importance of stable, adequately-paying work opportunities for individual well-being, as well as broader social well-being" [...] and that even given his other contributions to sociology, economics, and industrial relations, [...] "Bakke's study of Depression-era unemployment remains his most influential and far-reaching work."

2500|$|Rabbi Judah ben Simon expounded on God's {{words in}} [...] "I will <b>hide</b> <b>My</b> face from them." [...] Rabbi Judah ben Simon {{compared}} Israel to a king's son {{who went into}} the marketplace and struck people but was not struck in return (because of his being the king's son). He insulted but was not insulted. He went up to his father arrogantly. But the father asked the son whether he {{thought that he was}} respected on his own account, when the son was respected only on account of the respect that was due to the father. So the father renounced the son, and as a result, no one took any notice of him. So when Israel went out of Egypt, the fear of them fell upon all the nations, as [...] reported, [...] "The peoples have heard, they tremble; pangs have taken hold on the inhabitants of Philistia. Then were the chiefs of Edom frightened; the mighty men of Moab, trembling takes hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan are melted away. Terror and dread falls upon them." [...] But when Israel transgressed and sinned, God asked Israel whether it thought that it was respected on its own account, when it was respected only on account of the respect that was due to God. So God turned away from them a little, and the Amalekites came and attacked Israel, as [...] reports, [...] "Then Amalek came, and fought with Israel in Rephidim," [...] and then the Canaanites came and fought with Israel, as [...] reports, [...] "And the Canaanite, the king of Arad, who dwelt in the South, heard tell that Israel came by the way of Atharim; and he fought against Israel." [...] God told the Israelites that they had no genuine faith, as [...] says, [...] "they are a very disobedient generation, children in whom is no faith." [...] God concluded that the Israelites were rebellious, but to destroy them was impossible, to take them back to Egypt was impossible, and God could not change them for another people. So God concluded to chastise and try them with suffering.|$|E
2500|$|Rav Bardela bar Tabyumi {{taught in}} Rav's name that to whomever [...] "hiding of the face" [...] {{does not apply}} {{is not one of}} the Children of Israel, and to whomever [...] "they shall be devoured" [...] does not apply is also not one of them. The Rabbis confronted Rava, saying [...] "hiding of the face" [...] and [...] "they shall be devoured" [...] did not apply to Rava. Rava asked the Rabbis whether they knew how much he was forced to send {{secretly}} to the Court of King Shapur of Persia. Even so, the Rabbis directed their eyes upon Rava in suspicion. Meanwhile, the Court of King Shapur sent men who seized Rava's property. Rava then said that this bore out what Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel taught, that wherever the Rabbis direct their eyes in suspicion, either death or poverty follows. Interpreting [...] "I will <b>hide</b> <b>My</b> face," [...] Rava taught that God said although God would hide God's face from them, God would nonetheless speak to them in a dream. Rav Joseph taught that God's hand is nonetheless stretched over us to protect us, as [...] says, [...] "And I have covered you in the shadow of My hand." [...] Rabbi Joshua ben Hanania was once at the Roman emperor Hadrian's court, when an unbeliever gestured to Rabbi Joshua in sign language that the Jewish people was a people from whom their God had turned His face. Rabbi Joshua ben Hanania gestured in reply that God's hand was stretched over the Jewish people. Emperor Hadrian asked Rabbi Joshua what unbeliever had said. Rabbi Joshua told the emperor what unbeliever had said and what Rabbi Joshua had replied. They then asked the unbeliever what he had said, and he told them. And then they asked what Rabbi Joshua had replied, and the unbeliever did not know. They decreed that a man who does not understand what he is being shown by gesture should hold converse in signs before the emperor, and they led him forth and executed him for his disrespect to the emperor.|$|E

[...] Fripp tryllet i alle fall fram de vakreste toner jeg hadde hørt, og han kunne ikke ha gitt seg til kjenne på et mer gunstig tidspunkt i mitt liv. [...] Ingen kan nekte for at Robert Fripp, også helt tidlig i karrieren, var opptatt av jazz eller de blå notene. Durskalaer og oppstemte gjengroprefrenger har aldri appellert til meg, så da King Crimson ble meg til del var det som å smake på en bit av himmelriket.

There are more flexible ideas, more artistic flourishes, more colors. I've probably been influenced in that direction by people like Robert Fripp, Adrian Belew and David Torn. I'm more interested in using guitar sounds as textures and using effects in a more textural fashion.
