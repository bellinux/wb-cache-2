500|$|In chapter 40, Gangleri {{says that}} Valhalla {{must be an}} immense building, yet it must often be crowded around the doorways. High {{responds}} that {{there are plenty of}} doors, and that crowding doesn't occur around them. In support, High again quotes a stanza from Grímnismál. In chapter 41, Gangleri notes that there are very many people in Valhalla, and that Odin is a [...] "very great lord when he commands such a troop". Gangleri then asks what entertainment the einherjar have when they're not drinking. High responds that every day, the einherjar <b>get</b> <b>dressed</b> <b>and</b> [...] "put on war-gear and go out into the courtyard and fight each other and fall upon each other. This is their sport." [...] High says that when dinner time arrives, the einherjar ride back to Valhalla and sit down to drink. In reference, High quotes a stanza from Grímnismál.|$|E
500|$|The {{thoroughness}} of the muster {{was heavily}} dependent on the class of the passengers; the first-class stewards {{were in charge of}} only a few cabins, while those responsible for the second- and third-class passengers had to manage large numbers of people. The first-class stewards provided hands-on assistance, helping their charges to <b>get</b> <b>dressed</b> <b>and</b> bringing them out onto the deck. With far more people to deal with, the second- and third-class stewards mostly confined their efforts to throwing open doors and telling passengers to put on lifebelts and come up top. In third class, passengers were largely {{left to their own devices}} after being informed of the need to come on deck. Many passengers and crew were reluctant to comply, either refusing to believe that there was a problem or preferring the warmth of the ship's interior to the bitterly cold night air. The passengers were not told that the ship was sinking, though a few noticed that she was listing.|$|E
2500|$|Abramović had {{proposed}} some solo performances during her career that never were performed. One proposal was titled [...] "Come to Wash with Me." [...] This performance {{would take place}} in a gallery space that was to be transformed into a laundry with sinks placed all around the walls of the gallery. The public would enter the space and be asked to take off all of their clothes and give them to Abramović. The individuals would then wait around as she would wash, dry and iron their cloths for them, and once she was done, she would give them back their clothing, and they could <b>get</b> <b>dressed</b> <b>and</b> then leave. She proposed this in 1969 for the Galerija Doma Omladine in Belgrade. The proposal was refused.|$|E

2500|$|Natural {{languages}} such as English have {{words for}} several Boolean operations, in particular conjunction (and), disjunction (or), negation (not), and implication (implies). But not {{is synonymous with}} and not. When used to combine situational assertions such as [...] "the block is on the table" [...] and [...] "cats drink milk," [...] which naively are either true or false, the meanings of these logical connectives often have the meaning of their logical counterparts. However, with descriptions of behavior such as [...] "Jim walked through the door", one starts to notice differences such as failure of commutativity, for example the conjunction of [...] "Jim opened the door" [...] with [...] "Jim walked through the door" [...] in that order is not equivalent to their conjunction in the other order, since and usually means and then in such cases. Questions can be similar: the order [...] "Is the sky blue, and why is the sky blue?" [...] makes more sense than the reverse order. Conjunctive commands about behavior are like behavioral assertions, as in <b>get</b> <b>dressed</b> <b>and</b> go to school. Disjunctive commands such love me or leave me or fish or cut bait tend to be asymmetric via the implication that one alternative is less preferable. Conjoined nouns such as tea and milk generally describe aggregation as with set union while tea or milk is a choice. However context can reverse these senses, as in your choices are coffee and tea which usually means the same as your choices are coffee or tea (alternatives). Double negation as in [...] "I don't not like milk" [...] rarely means literally [...] "I do like milk" [...] but rather conveys some sort of hedging, as though to imply {{that there is a}} third possibility. [...] "Not not P" [...] can be loosely interpreted as [...] "surely P", and although P necessarily implies [...] "not not P" [...] the converse is suspect in English, much as with intuitionistic logic. In view of the highly idiosyncratic usage of conjunctions in natural languages, Boolean algebra cannot be considered a reliable framework for interpreting them.|$|E
