5|$|The {{first major}} {{achievement}} for PLOT was the award-winning VM Houses in Ørestad, Copenhagen, in 2005. Inspired by Le Corbusier's Unité d'Habitation concept, they designed two residential blocks, {{in the shape}} of the letters V and M (as seen from the sky); the M House with 95 units, was completed in 2004, and the V House, with 114 units, in 2005. The design places strong emphasis on daylight, privacy and views. Rather than looking over the neighboring building, all of the apartments have diagonal views of the surrounding fields. Corridors are short and bright, rather like open bullet holes through the building. There are some 80 different types of apartment in the complex, adaptable to <b>individual</b> <b>needs.</b> The building garnered Ingels and Smedt the Forum AID Award for the best building in Scandinavia in 2006. Ingels lived in the complex until 2008 when he moved into the adjacent Mountain Dwellings.|$|E

25|$|In {{long-term}} psychoses, CBT is used {{to complement}} medication and is adapted to meet <b>individual</b> <b>needs.</b> Interventions particularly related to these conditions include exploring reality testing, changing delusions and hallucinations, examining factors which precipitate relapse, and managing relapses. Several meta-analyses suggested that CBT is effective in schizophrenia, and the American Psychiatric Association includes CBT in its schizophrenia guideline as an evidence-based treatment. There is also limited evidence of effectiveness for CBT in bipolar disorder and severe depression.|$|E
25|$|Physiotherapy {{is vital}} in the {{treatment}} of many rheumatological disorders. Occupational therapy can help patients finding alternative ways for common movements which would otherwise be restricted by their disease. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis often need a long term, coordinated and a multidisciplinary team approach towards management of individual patients. Treatment is often tailored according to the <b>individual</b> <b>needs</b> of each patient which is also dependent on the response and the tolerability of medications. Rheumasurgery has also played an integral part {{in the treatment}} of rheumatic disorders.|$|E

Typically, treatment involves one-on-one therapy with a speech language pathologist (SLP). For severe forms of AOS, therapy may involve multiple sessions per week, which is reduced with speech improvement. Another main theme in AOS treatment {{is the use of}} repetition in order to achieve a large amount of target utterances, or desired speech usages.|$|E

25|$|Psychological {{theories}} of magic treat magic {{as a personal}} phenomenon intended to meet <b>individual</b> <b>needs,</b> {{as opposed to a}} social phenomenon serving a collective purpose. The explanatory power of magic should not be underestimated, however. Both in the past and in the modern world, magical belief systems can provide explanations for otherwise difficult or impossible to understand phenomena while providing a spiritual and metaphysical grounding for the individual. Furthermore, as both Brian Feltham and Scott E. Hendrix argue, magical beliefs need not represent a form of irrationality, nor should they be viewed as incompatible with modern views of the world.|$|E

40|$|This {{comparative}} {{qualitative study}} is about lower secondary comprehensive school and teachers´ perspectives towards equality and provision of <b>individual</b> <b>need.</b> The study is defined within the radical humanist paradigm, based on key elements from ideas of Habermas, Vygotsky and Bourdieu. The concepts of ideal speech situation, cultural tools, habitus and field are especially helpful to understand teachers´ perspectives and cultural contexts. The research {{is located in}} England and Norway {{as a result of}} their historical and political similarities in the emphasis on a comprehensive school approach, but also because cultural differences are evident between the two countries. The English essentialism and Norwegian encyclopaedism are examples of these differences. The research design is based on narrative semi-structured interviews with a total of 19 teachers from lower secondary schools in the cities of Bradford and Oslo. In comparing England and Norway, similarities were evident in the teachers´ interpretations of equality and <b>individual</b> <b>need</b> provision, but differences were also evident in their experiences of the same issues. The experiences of <b>individual</b> <b>need</b> provision in England was high, while a significant concern was directed to inequality of school access. In Norway, the equality of school access was high, but lack of <b>individual</b> <b>need</b> provision within the schools was evident. The cultural aspects were helpful in understanding these findings...|$|R

According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education and physical education that are aligned with the , campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus.|$|E
25|$|A {{meta-analysis}} {{reviewing the}} relationship between the optimistic bias and perceived control found that a number of moderators contribute to this relationship. In previous research, participants from the United States generally had higher levels of optimistic bias relating to perceived control than those of other nationalities. Students also showed larger levels of the optimistic bias than non-students. The format of the study also demonstrated differences in {{the relationship between}} perceived control and the optimistic bias: direct methods of measurement suggested greater perceived control and greater optimistic bias as compared to indirect measures of the bias. The optimistic bias is strongest in situations where an <b>individual</b> <b>needs</b> to rely heavily on direct action and responsibility of situations.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} sets of competencies for different specializations within I/O psychology and I/O psychologists are versatile behavioral scientists. For example, an I/O psychologist specializing in selection and recruiting should have expertise in finding the best talent for the organization and getting everyone on board while {{he or she might}} not need to know much about executive coaching. Some I/O psychologists specialize in specific areas of consulting whereas others tend to generalize their areas of expertise. There are basic skills and knowledge an <b>individual</b> <b>needs</b> in order to be an effective I/O psychologist, which include being an independent learner, interpersonal skills (e.g., listening skills), and general consultation skills (e.g., skills and knowledge in the problem area).|$|E

When faced with behavior that meets an <b>individual's</b> <b>needs,</b> expectations, or desires, the response behavior will be positive. When faced with behavior that does not meet an <b>individual's</b> <b>needs,</b> expectations, or desires, he or she can respond either positively or negatively depending on the degree of violation and positive or negative valence of the relationship.|$|R
