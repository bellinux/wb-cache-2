5|$|Elizabeth Cresswell (c. 1625– c. 1698), {{also known}} as Mother Creswell and Madam Cresswell of Clerkenwell, {{was one of the}} most {{successful}} prostitutes and brothel <b>keepers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> English seventeenth century. Starting with houses in Bartholomew Close, in the City of London and St Leonard's, Shoreditch, she built a widespread network of brothels across London, supplied with girls and women from across England. Her employees included the wives of soldiers pressed into service for Charles II and gentlewomen who had supported the Cavalier cause during the English Civil War and had since fallen on hard times. Her bawdy houses were favoured by King Charles and his court as well as powerful figures in government and city guilds. This position gave her a measure of immunity from prosecution and added to her profile as a caricature of iniquity and corruption.|$|E
5|$|In the game, {{the player}} {{controls}} Scarygirl, {{a young girl}} with an eye patch, a sewn-shut mouth and a hook-capped tentacle for one arm. The girl, an orphan, was raised and cared for by Blister, an intelligent, mustached octopus that built the girl a tree house to live in. Plagued by recurring nightmares that featured a mysterious man, the girl consults Bunnyguru, a rabbit that lives {{in the bottom of}} the tree where the girl makes her home. Bunniguru offers a vision of a city far away from the girl's home. The girl is then sent by Blister into a forest to investigate why the Tree of Life is losing its leaves, where she discovers that one of the <b>keepers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forest has been kidnapped and taken to the city from Bunnyguru's vision, and becomes tasked with seeing to the keeper of the forest's safe return.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} groups of Black Hebrews, the Church of God and Saints of Christ, was founded in Kansas in 1896, but it {{retained}} elements of a messianic connection to Jesus. During the following decades, many more Black Hebrew congregations were established, {{and some of them}} had no connection to Christianity. After World War I, for example, Wentworth Arthur Matthew, an immigrant from Saint Kitts, founded a Black Hebrew congregation in Harlem, claiming descent from the ancient Israelites. He called it the Commandment <b>Keepers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Living God. Similar groups selected elements of Judaism and adapted them within a structure {{similar to that of the}} Black church. He incorporated it in 1930 and moved the congregation to Brooklyn, where he later founded the Israelite Rabbinical Seminary, where Black Hebrew rabbis have been educated and ordained.|$|E
50|$|A <b>Keeper</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Crown Jewels was {{appointed}} in 1207. Over the subsequent centuries his title varied, from <b>Keeper</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> King's Jewels, Master <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jewel House, Master and Treasurer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> King's Jewels and Plate, or <b>Keeper</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jewel House. He was also Treasurer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chamber, a division <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Royal Household <b>of</b> <b>the</b> monarch. In this position {{he was also}} called <b>Keeper</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Court Wardrobe, <b>Keeper</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Privy Wardrobe, or Receiver <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chamber. In this capacity, he represented the Lord Treasurer's interests in the regalia, and the wardrobe and privy wardrobe. Because <b>of</b> this, <b>the</b> Receiver <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chamber exercised delegated authority over the Crown Jewels, especially those kept at <b>the</b> Tower <b>of</b> London (these two positions were separated in 1485).|$|R

5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 309, Maximinus resumed {{persecution}} by issuing letters to provincial governors and his praetorian prefect, the highest authority in judicial proceedings after the emperor, demanding that Christians conform to pagan customs. His new legislation called for another general sacrifice, coupled with a general offering of libations. It was even more systematic than the first, allowing no exceptions for infants or servants. Logistai (curatores), strategoi, duumviri, and tabularii, who kept the records, {{saw to it that}} there were no evasions. Maximinus introduced some innovations to the process, making him the only known persecuting emperor to have done so. This edict now required food sold in the marketplaces to be covered in libation. Maximinus sent sentries to stand guard at bathhouses and city gates to ensure that all customers sacrificed. He issued copies of the fictitious Acts of Pilate to encourage popular hatred of Christ. Prostitutes confessed, under judicial torture, to having engaged in debaucheries with Christians. Bishops were reassigned to work as stable boys for the Imperial horse guard or <b>keepers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Imperial camels.|$|E

25|$|Anticosti Island {{is larger}} than Prince Edward Island but sparsely {{populated}} (240 people in 2011), {{with most of the}} permanent population in the village of Port-Menier on the western tip of the island, consisting chiefly of the <b>keepers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lighthouses erected by the Canadian government.

25|$|As {{the details}} of the Fotheringhay treaty became known, vital Scottish support for Albany as king evaporated. Albany, his brother's party, and the <b>keepers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> castle became reconciled. On 2 August Albany and Gloucester signed a bond with Colin, Earl of Argyll, Archbisbop Scheves, Lord Avandale, and the Bishop of Dunkeld which promised a pardon for Albany and the {{restoration}} of his previous dignities.|$|E
25|$|Weather {{conditions}} in the area can be extreme, with the Roaring Forties wind being a particular problem. The maximum wind gust ever recorded was 176km/h. Reportedly, the first <b>keepers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> light took chickens with them to Maatsuyker but the fowls blew away into the ocean. Given the wind and lack of shelter, this is possible if they were left outside during storms. Vegetables get blown flat by the wind, but surprisingly, can be grown successfully, even though the garden is {{on the west side}} of the island, facing into the prevailing winds.|$|E
25|$|He {{stressed}} in {{his writings}} the corruption absolutism played {{in the fall of}} France when he contrasts the role English and French historians were able to investigate history. For instance, when stressing the importance of sources in developing fact, he contrasted Thomas Rymer's way of access to the London archives to that of his own where he had to bribe the <b>keepers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French archives. For his neutral reasoning, his works were cited by subsequent writers whose works would prove influential in the development of Western political thought and historical research.|$|E

25|$|A new {{consciousness}} of the inequality of American women began sweeping the nation, starting with the 1963 publication of Betty Friedan's best-seller, The Feminine Mystique, which explained how many housewives felt trapped and unfulfilled, assaulted American culture for its creation {{of the notion that}} women could only find fulfillment through their roles as wives, mothers, and <b>keepers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> home, and argued that women were just as able as men to do every type of job. In 1966 Friedan and others established the National Organization for Women, or NOW, to act for women as the NAACP did for African Americans.|$|E
25|$|Cadoc {{came into}} {{conflict}} with Arthur: the vita depicts Arthur as great and bold but willful. Lifris writes that Cadoc gave protection {{to a man who}} had killed three of Arthur's soldiers and Arthur was awarded a herd of cattle from Cadoc as compensation. Cadoc delivered them but when Arthur took possession of them they were transformed into bundles of ferns. Similar incidents are often described in mediaeval biographies such as those of Carannog, Padern and Goeznovius: miracles in dealings with temporal authority bolster the case for church freedom. In later Arthurian Welsh Triads Cadoc, with Illtud and Peredur, is one of three knights said to have become <b>keepers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holy Grail.|$|E
25|$|In 1874, it {{was bought}} by the Anticosti Island Company and they founded the villages at English Bay and Fox Bay. Most of the inhabitants, however, {{continued}} to be the few <b>keepers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island's many lighthouses. Because {{of the number of}} shipwrecks around the island, stores of provisions were also maintained around the island for sailors who might be washed ashore. In 1882, the Parish of Notre-Dame-de-l'Assomption was founded, a term referring to Cartier's name for the island. In 1884, the island became property of the Stockwell brothers who formed a forestry company two years later. But they were unsuccessful and the company lasted only five years. By the 1890s, the fish and wildlife of the island had been almost eradicated through the locals' indiscriminate slaughter.|$|E
