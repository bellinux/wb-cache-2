Here, on 15 March 1927, the crew conducted a service in commemoration at the sinking site of [...] which was lost on 9 November 1914. The trip continued to Japan, Alaska, Cape Horn, Rio de Janeiro, the Azores and Spain before they returned home on 14 March 1928.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the accuracy of}} three electronic apex locators (Root ZX, Novapex, and Justy II) in root canal length determinations using different apical file sizes, considering the apical constriction (AC) and the major foramen (MF) as anatomic references. The diameter of the apical foramina of 40 single-rooted teeth was determined by direct visual measurement and the master apical file was established. <b>Electronic</b> <b>measurements</b> were then performed using 3 instruments: the selected master apical file (adjusted file), one size smaller (intermediate file), and two sizes smaller (misfit file). The distances {{from the tip of}} files fixed in the canals to the MF and to the AC were measured digitally. Precision at AC and at MF for the misfit, intermediate and adjusted apical files was as follows: 80 %/ 88 %/ 83 % and 78 %/ 83 %/ 95 % (Root ZX); 80 %/ 85 %/ 80 % and 68 %/ 73 %/ 73 % (Novapex); and 78 %/ 80 %/ 78 % and 65 %/ 78 %/ 70 % (Justy II). Considering the mean discrepancies, statistically significant differences were found only for the adjusted file at MF, with Root ZX presenting the best results at MF. The chi-square test showed significant differences between the acceptable measurements at AC and at MF for the Justy II and Novapex (± 0. 5 mm) regardless of file adjustment. Under the conditions of the present study, all devices provided acceptable <b>electronic</b> <b>measurements</b> regardless of file adjustment, except for Root ZX which had its performance improved significantly when the precisely fit apical file was used.

40|$|Organic {{solar cells}} (OSCs) have {{attracted}} {{a lot of}} attention due to their potential as flexible, lightweight, and low-cost renewable energy sources. Significant improvements have been made in increasing the devices’ power conversion efficiency (PCE) and extensive efforts to understand degradation mechanisms and increase OSCs’ lifetimes are ongoing. OSCs with higher than 10 % efficiency have been reported. Enhanced stability and efficiency of inverted poly(3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT) solar cells with Cesium (Cs) halides were achieved by spin-coating Bphen (4, 7 -di(phenyl) - 1, 10 -phenanthroline) on the halide layer and adding an ~ 100 nm polystyrene beads layer on the blank side of the OSC. To investigate photodegradation in a low-bandgap polymer, PBDTTT-EFT (benzo[1, 2 -b: 4, 5 -b’]dithiophene (BDT) and thieno[3, 4 -b]-thiophene), PBDTTT-EFT:PCBM bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells were irradiated under 1 X sun intensity and their <b>electronic</b> <b>measurements</b> were monitored over time. The <b>electronic</b> <b>measurements</b> revealed an increase in deep defect density in the polymer and at the donor-acceptor (D/A) interface of BHJ SCs and an increase in charge recombination as well as a decrease in external quantum efficiency, charge collection, short circuit current, open circuit voltage and hole mobility. Filtering blue and UV light resulted in drastically reduced photodegradation. Electron paramagnetic resonance measurements were performed on the photodegraded polymer and BHJ films, and revealed for the first time experimental evidence for metastable carbon dangling bonds (g= 2. 0029 ÃÂ± 0. 0004) formed by blue/UV irradiation of the films. Dark EPR showed an increase in densities of other spin-active sites in the polymer, fullerene and polymer:fullerene blends in agreement with <b>electronic</b> <b>measurements.</b> The EPR results revealed that the carbon dangling bonds were at the D/A interface. These studies helped to better understand degradation mechanisms in a low-bandgap polymer, PBDTTT-EFT, ways to enhance its stability as well as the stability of P 3 HT (high bandgap) polymer SCs...|$|R
