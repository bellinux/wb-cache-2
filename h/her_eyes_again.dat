5|$|The video {{starts with}} Farmer slowly walking in an {{laboratory}} {{in which many}} animals are captive to serve as experiments. Depicting a supernatural creature, the singer approaches every cage {{to look at all}} the animals — pigeons, cats, bobcats, rabbits, mouses, a snake, an owl, a monkey, a doe — and heals them with her magic hands. Then she takes a wounded little cat out of its cage and puts it on her shoulders. During the second refrain, she remains standing with closed eyes {{in the middle of the}} room and uses her supernatural powers to explode all of the glass cages. She thus releases the animals and, with a monkey in her arms, leads them outside into the woods. Standing in the forest, she closes <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>again</b> and sends many rays of light from her hands. The last scene shows the Earth being covered by that light.|$|E
60|$|She raised <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>again</b> defiantly, but {{the face}} had disappeared.|$|E
60|$|She {{pressed his}} hand and closed <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>again.</b> The Professor returned.|$|E
6000|$|They {{told her}} with eloquent brevity, {{but instead of}} praising their prowess, and thanking them with fervour, the ungrateful woman shut <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>again,</b> merely saying with drowsy irascibility,-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do," [...] said Alison. Hodder caught <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>again,</b> {{and this}} time he was sure that she {{surprised}} in him a certain disdain of Mr. Atterbury's zeal. Her smile was faint, yet unmistakable.|$|R
60|$|Then <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> closed. <b>Again</b> Pan drew Blinky {{away into}} the gloom.|$|R
60|$|Then {{she closed}} <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>again,</b> {{and went on}} talking incoherently to herself.|$|E
60|$|Here the dark-faced Freydisa {{looked up}} at me, then dropped <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>again,</b> and stood listening.|$|E
60|$|So saying, {{she turned}} her head away and shut <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>again,</b> and so Rollo withdrew.|$|E
60|$|When <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> opened <b>again,</b> Montalvo, officer, notary, and soldiers, all had vanished.|$|R
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> were <b>again</b> cast down, and {{she took}} a step in the {{direction}} of the window.|$|R
60|$|The moistness was in <b>her</b> old <b>eyes</b> <b>again,</b> {{and she had}} to wipe it {{away before}} she could go on stitching.|$|R
60|$|Miss Cornelia wiped <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>again</b> {{and having}} {{relieved}} her feelings by her blood-thirsty wish, took up her tale.|$|E
60|$|And {{throwing}} her neck back, she closed <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>again.</b> The sunlight streamed {{in on her}} between the half-drawn curtains.|$|E
60|$|She feebly echoed, 'Of course,' {{or rather}} {{expressed}} {{it by the}} motion of her lips, and closed <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
60|$|Fan {{looked at}} her and shrunk away as she approached, and then turned <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> dilating <b>again</b> with fear, towards the door.|$|R
60|$|She {{directed}} <b>her</b> round <b>eyes</b> <b>again</b> to {{the sunshine}} outside, while the cat reposed within her folded arms in lordly beatitude and sphinx-like meditation.|$|R
60|$|Nanny looked {{first at}} the deck, then at her interrogator's face, next towards Mr. Blunt, {{withdrawing}} <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>again,</b> as if guilty of an indiscretion, and finally at the sails. Perceiving her embarrassment, respecting her discretion, and ashamed of the task he had undertaken, Mr. Sharp said a few civil things suited to {{the condition of the}} woman, and sauntering about the deck for a short time, to avoid suspicion, soon found himself once more alongside of Eve. The latter inquired with <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> a little exultingly perhaps, concerning his success.|$|R
60|$|Ruth closed <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>again</b> and lay {{quiet for}} a short time, then she looked up again and tried to sit up.|$|E
60|$|But {{the tears}} were {{threatening}} {{to rise in}} <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>again,</b> as {{she shook her head}} and turned and went up the steps.|$|E
60|$|When Augusta opened <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>again</b> {{she became}} {{conscious}} {{of a violent}} rolling motion {{that she could not}} mistake. They were at sea.|$|E
6000|$|... "Father," [...] replied Hilda, raising <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> and <b>again</b> {{letting them}} fall, [...] "I am of New Eng land birth, and was bred as {{what you call}} a heretic." ...|$|R
60|$|Now Nada the Lily looked, then rubbed <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> {{and looked}} <b>again.</b>|$|R
60|$|Maxwell was {{a little}} {{confused}} to notice that Bonita had overheard; for a second the long lashes dropped across <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> and <b>again</b> there was a flicker of damask in her cheek.|$|R
6000|$|She dropped <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>again</b> and was silent. Then exhaling a full rich sigh, as she {{gathered}} her shawl together--"He was a magnificent genius!" ...|$|E
60|$|Dinah opened <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>again</b> and paused, {{looking at}} the group of villagers, who were now {{gathered}} rather more closely on her right hand.|$|E
60|$|Twemlow {{going on}} to reply, she rests <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>again,</b> knowing her ears to be quite enough for the {{contents}} of so weak a vessel.|$|E
6000|$|When {{she opened}} <b>her</b> brown <b>eyes</b> <b>again</b> {{she was lying}} on the dry sand beyond the Point, and the young man was on the beach below her, holding both the horses--his own and Tita! ...|$|R
60|$|The {{girl looked}} up into the face of Jonas Prim. The man voiced an exclamation of {{surprise}} and annoyance. Mrs. Prim gasped and sank upon a sofa. The girl stood motionless, <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> once <b>again</b> bent upon the floor.|$|R
60|$|But at {{last she}} succeeded. Alvina seemed to thaw. The hard shining of <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> {{softened}} <b>again</b> {{to a sort of}} demureness and tenderness. The influence of the man was revoked, the girl was left uninhabited, empty and uneasy.|$|R
60|$|Presently Lady Bellamy opened <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>again,</b> {{and this}} time there was {{intelligence}} in them. She gazed round her with a wondering air. Next she spoke.|$|E
60|$|They {{rose and}} went into the next room, Miss Mayhew {{following}} them with a bright, absent look, and then dropping <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>again</b> to her letter.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{sometimes}} you do," [...] said Mrs. Makely, {{and the tears}} stood in <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>again.</b> [...] "And you know how fond I am of you all!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Wouldn't it seem--. And yet, O how I {{should like}} to! It would remind them all, if {{we told them}} what it was, how we really meant to be married on that bygone day!' <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> were <b>again</b> laden with wet.|$|R
60|$|An {{expression}} of irresolution passed {{for an instant}} over her face, but <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> had hardened <b>again</b> when she answered me.|$|R
60|$|But at {{last she}} lifted up <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> to his <b>again</b> and spoke. There was no indignation in her voice--only deep regret.|$|R
