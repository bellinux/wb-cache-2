40|$|Synopsis: For under-reinforced {{concrete}} sections {{reinforced with}} FRP, {{failure of a}} member is initiated by rupture of the FRP bar and the typical ACI compression stress-block might not be applicable. This {{is because of the}} fact that the corresponding strain at the <b>extreme</b> <b>fiber</b> of the concrete will not reach the ultimate strain in concrete. Therefore, accurate computation of flexural capacity requires developing equivalent stress-block parameters that represent the stress distribution in the concrete at a particular strain level. While the ACI 440 permits the use of a simplified approach to calculate moment capacities that do not require equivalent stress-block calculations, the significance of this simplification needs to be examined. This paper suggests a family of curves based on the <b>extreme</b> <b>fiber</b> strain in concrete using three existing stress-strain models. The paper highlights the significance of these curves for different values of compressive strengths of concrete...|$|E

Strains were measured in the end regions of each beam; resulting in 14 separate tests. Beams with an <b>extreme</b> <b>fiber</b> tensile stress greater than 4. 5 f ' exhibited cracking at the time of release.

50|$|The {{flexural}} strength {{would be the}} same as the tensile strength if the material were homogeneous. In fact, most materials have small or large defects in them which act to concentrate the stresses locally, effectively causing a localized weakness. When a material is bent only the <b>extreme</b> <b>fibers</b> are at the largest stress so, if those fibers are free from defects, the {{flexural strength}} will be controlled by the strength of those intact 'fibers'. However, if the same material was subjected to only tensile forces then all the fibers in the material are at the same stress and failure will initiate when the weakest fiber reaches its limiting tensile stress. Therefore, it is common for flexural strengths to be higher than tensile strengths for the same material. Conversely, a homogeneous material with defects only on its surfaces (e.g., due to scratches) might have a higher tensile strength than flexural strength.|$|R

40|$|Straight or curved hat-section {{members are}} often used as {{structural}} stiffeners in aircraft. For instance, they are employed as stiffeners for the dorsal skin {{as well as in}} the aerial refueling adjacent area structure in F- 106 aircraft. The flanges of the hat-section are connected to the aircraft skin. Thus, the portion of the skin closing the hat-section interacts with the section itself when resisting the stresses due to service loads. The flexural fatigue life of such a closed section is estimated using materially nonlinear axial fatigue characteristics. It should be recognized that when a structural shape is subjected to bending, the fatigue life at the neutral axis is infinity since the normal stresses are zero at that location. Conversely, the fatigue life at the <b>extreme</b> <b>fibers</b> where the normal bending stresses are maximum can be expected to be finite. Thus, different fatigue life estimates can be visualized at various distances from the neural axis. The problem becomes compounded further when significant portions away from the neutral axis are stressed into plastic range. A theoretical analysis of the closed hat-section subjected to flexural cyclic loading is first conducted. The axial fatigue characteristics together with the related axial fatigue life formula and its inverted form given by Manson and Muralidharan are adopted for an aluminum alloy used in aircraft construction. A closed-form expression for predicting the flexural fatigue life is then derived for the closed hat-section including materially nonlinear action. A computer program is written to conduct a study of the variables such as the thicknesses of the hat-section and the skin, and the type of alloy used. The study has provided a fundamental understanding of the flexural fatigue life characteristics of a practical structural component used in aircraft when materially nonlinear action is present...|$|R

The present study focuses on the momentcurvature (M-φ) relation of rectangular beam section. A user friendly software programme to generate moment-curvature relation of rectangular reinforced concrete beams developed using stress-strain curves of concrete and steel as per IS 456 : 2000. A thorough study is done to see the how different parameters (such as 0 grade of concrete and steel, effective cover, amount of tension steel reinforcement etc.) affect the moment-curvature relation. Also a study is done on the variation of neutral axis in an underreinforced rectangular doubly reinforced section with varying strain in the extreme compression fiber of concrete. It is found from the study that increasing tension steel reinforcement substantially increases the moment capacity of the section but reduces the ductility. Increase in the grade of concrete marginally increases moment capacity but substantially increases the ductility. Both moment capacity and ductility of the beam decreases with the increase of effective cover. Fe 415 grade of steel makes the beam more ductile than that with Fe 500.

The method could eliminate the PSF difference between fibers, extract spectra to the photo noise level, {{as well as}} improve the resolution.
