40|$|Background Evidence that atopic eczema partly originatesin utero is increasing, {{with some}} studies linking the risk of {{developing}} the condition with aspects of maternal diet during pregnancy. Nicotinamide, a naturally occurring nutrient that is maintained through the dietary intakes of vitamin B 3 and tryptophan, has been used in the treatment of some skin conditions including atopic eczema. Objective To examine the relation of maternal serum concentrations of nicotinamide and related tryptophan metabolites to the risk of atopic eczema in the offspring. Methods Within the UK Southampton Women Survey, <b>infantile</b> atopic <b>eczema</b> at ages 6 and 12 months was ascertained (modified UK Working Party Criteria for the Definition of Atopic Dermatitis). Maternal serum levels of kynurenine, kynurenic acid, anthranilic acid, tryptophan, nicotinamide and N 1 -methylnicotinamide were measured in late pregnancy by mass spectrometry (n= 497) and related to the odds ratio of <b>infantile</b> atopic <b>eczema.</b> Results Maternal nicotinamide and related metabolite concentrations were not associated with offspring atopic eczema at age 6 months. Higher concentrations of nicotinamide and anthranilic acid were, however, associated with a lower risk of eczema at age 12 months (odds ratios 0. 69, 95 % CI 0. 53 – 0. 91 /SD change,P= 0. 007 and 0. 63, 0. 48 – 0. 83,P= 0. 001, respectively). The associations were robust to adjustment for potentially confounding variables. Conclusion and clinical relevance This is the first study linking maternal serum concentrations of nicotinamide and related metabolites to the risk of atopic eczema in the offspring. The findings point to potentially modifiable maternal influences on this complex and highly prevalent condition. </p...|$|R
40|$|The rising {{prevalence}} of food allergy {{has led to}} particular interest in intervention studies designed to prevent its onset. These studies have been performed on high-risk children in particular. Primary intervention studies are difficult to perform due {{to the complexity of}} design and selection of patients. Analyses and comparison of the results of different studies are exceedingly difficult to interpret owing to differences in selection criteria, primary outcomes and methods used to confirm the diagnosis of allergy. In spite of these limitations, there are several prospective, randomised, blind studies that have demonstrated the benefits of food allergy prevention. In these studies dietary intervention in the first 4 to 6 months promoted a decrease in <b>infantile</b> atopic <b>eczema</b> and cow¿s milk allergy.

40|$|The complex {{relationship}} between food allergy and <b>infantile</b> <b>eczema</b> has prompted divergent approaches to investigating potential food triggers in eczematous patients.

Determining whether certain foods trigger an eczematous flare in individual infants with eczema is difficult. For all infants with eczema, good skin care is the mainstay of treatment but identifying and avoiding triggers (both allergic and non-allergic) is important in some infants. Given this, we have a developed an algorithm that can be used by dermatologists in the investigation and management of food allergies in <b>infantile</b> <b>eczema.</b> Issues such as patient selection, investigation and elimination diets are addressed, with reference to relevant evidence in the literature.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{assess the}} {{relations}} between breast feeding and infant illness {{in the first two}} years of life with particular reference to gastrointestinal disease. DESIGN [...] Prospective observational study of mothers and babies followed up for 24 months after birth. SETTING [...] Community setting in Dundee. PATIENTS [...] 750 pairs of mothers and infants, 76 of whom were excluded because the babies were preterm (less than 38 weeks), low birth weight (less than 2500 g), or treated in special care for more than 48 hours. Of the remaining cohort of 674, 618 were followed up for two years. INTERVENTIONS [...] Detailed observations of infant feeding and illness were made at two weeks, and one, two, three, four, five, six, nine, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 months by health visitors. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE [...] The prevalence of gastrointestinal disease in infants during follow up. RESULTS [...] After confounding variables were corrected for babies who were breast fed for 13 weeks or more (227) had significantly less gastrointestinal illness than those who were bottle fed from birth (267) at ages 0 - 13 weeks (p less than 0. 01; 95 % confidence interval for reduction in incidence 6. 6 % to 16. 8 %), 14 - 26 weeks (p less than 0. 01), 27 - 39 weeks (p less than 0. 05), and 40 - 52 weeks (p less than 0. 05). This reduction in illness was found whether or not supplements were introduced before 13 weeks, was maintained beyond the period of breast feeding itself, and was accompanied by a reduction in the rate of hospital admission. By contrast, babies who were breast fed for less than 13 weeks (180) had rates of gastrointestinal illness similar to those observed in bottle fed babies. Smaller reductions in the rates of respiratory illness were observed at ages 0 - 13 and 40 - 52 weeks (p less than 0. 05) in babies who were breast fed for more than 13 weeks. There was no consistent protective effect of breast feeding against ear, eye, mouth, or skin infections, <b>infantile</b> colic, <b>eczema,</b> or nappy rash. CONCLUSION [...] Breast feeding during the first 13 weeks of life confers protection against gastrointestinal illness that persists beyond the period of breast feeding itself...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Socio-demographic {{predictors}} for {{the development}} of clinically observed, <b>infantile</b> <b>eczema</b> have not been formally examined in a large population-based study. Few studies of eczema risk factors have included current, objective eczema outcomes as well as parent-reported history. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to measure the population prevalence of <b>infantile</b> <b>eczema</b> using novel sampling methodology, and identify socio-demographic risk factors for eczema {{in the first year of}} life. METHODS: A population-based cross-sectional study of infantile allergy (the HealthNuts study, n =  4972, response rate 74. 1 %) was conducted from 2008 - 2011 in Melbourne, Australia. Infants were examined for current eczema at age 12  months (mean 12. 7, SD 0. 7). Parents provided information about the infants' history of eczema and demographic factors. Factors associated with eczema were modelled using multinomial logistic regression. RESULTS: The population prevalence of observed eczema at 12  months was 20. 3 % (95 % CI 19. 0, 21. 5), while cumulative prevalence for parent-reported eczema was 28. 0 % (95 % CI 26. 7, 29. 4). The strongest predictors of eczema were maternal eczema and asthma (multinomial (M) -OR 1. 7, P <  0. 001, and M-OR 1. 4, P =  0. 007), male sex (M-OR 1. 4, P <  0. 001), and East Asian ethnicity (M-OR 1. 6, P <  0. 001) with over 80 % of infants with all risk factors exhibiting eczema. East Asian parents, particularly recent migrants, reported fewer allergies than other parents. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Approximately, one in three infants developed eczema by 12  months of age. East Asian infants are at increased risk of eczema despite their parents having lower rates of allergy than non-Asian parents.

40|$|Atopy can {{manifest}} in childhood as <b>infantile</b> <b>eczema</b> (atopic dermatitis), allergic rhinitis and asthma. In practice, {{it is critical}} to identify the offending allergen in atopic individuals. This will not only influence therapeutic interventions, but may also {{have a significant impact on}} the individual’s quality of life. The most common clinical test for allergy detection is the introduction of an allergen directly into the skin in the form of a skin-prick test. Skin-prick testing is recommended in the diagnostic workup for allergies because it is reliable, safe, convenient, inexpensive, minimally invasive, and has the advantage of multiple allergen testing in one, 15 - to 20 -minute, test. Skin-prick testing can be performed from birth onwards. Although there is a small risk of developing anaphylaxis, the test remains safe to perform in a consultation room or at the patient’s bedside. Worldwide, a skin-prick test remains the test of choice for allergy because of its convenience and cost-effectiveness. A globally accepted guideline for skin-prick testing is still lacking and would be beneficial to both patient and physician. [URL]...|$|E

Staphylococci causing attacks of clinical sepsis arose from these persistently colonized sites. Staphylococci of the same phage type were also common in family contacts.

40|$|Background: Atopic eczema (AE) or <b>infantile</b> <b>eczema</b> is an {{inflammatory}} skin disease, which affects 10 - 20 % {{of children in}} industrialised countries. Australia was the 12 th highest rank of AE incidence in 55 participating countries. AE is characterised by poorly demarcated redness of the skin and associated surface changes such as scaling, swelling, accentuation of the hair follicles and skin thickening {{as a result of}} chronic scratching. There are three common quoted diagnostic criteria for determination of AE for the purpose of research and clinical studies. In addition, reliable scoring instrument such as Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) is fundamental for clinicians to verify the severity, the course and outcomes of treatment for AE. Certain quality of life (QoL) questionnaires have also been developed and validated for assessment of the personal impact and outcomes of the treatment for AE. The conventional (Western) medicine treatment for AE is not satisfactory. Complementary and alternative medicine including Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) has been increasingly used for AE. There is some promising published evidence on oral administration of CHM for AE. However, the benefit of topical application of CHM for AE is not clear. Aims: a) To review fundamental knowledge of AE in perspectives of both conventional medicine and Chinese medicine (CM); b) To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of topical application of CHM for AE by systematically reviewing currently available randomised controlled trials (RCTs); and c) To develop a protocol for pilot randomised double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial for evaluation of the efficacy and safety of topical application of CHM for AE. Methods: We searched any RCTs with topical application of CHM in electronic databases and journals. Trial-design quality was evaluated and intervention outcome data were extracted and analysed. Meta-analysis was conducted. Development of a protocol for pilot RCT of topical application of CHM for AE followed the Australian Government’s guidelines in compliance with high ethical standard. Results: Three studies involving a total of 452 participants were selected for analysis after screening 164 potential studies. All three included studies reported significant differences between the treatment group and controlled group and claimed that effects of treatment interventions were superior to control. However, due to the low quality of study design which resulted in low level of evidence strength, these claims require more vigorous scientific proof employing well designed RCTs. As a result, a protocol for pilot randomised double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial for evaluation of the efficacy and safety of topical application of CHM for AE was developed. Conclusion: The systematic review in this thesis is the first one conducted in topical application of CHM for AE. Detailed analysis of the three included studies led to the conclusion of low level of evidence strength. Thus, they did not provide convincing evidential support for effectiveness of CHM used topically for AE or <b>infantile</b> <b>eczema.</b> Therefore, {{there is a need to}} evaluate the efficacy and safety of topical application of a CHM for AE through a well designed, double-blind controlled-placebo clinical trial...|$|E
40|$|Eczema (atopic dermatitis) is {{a common}} itc hy {{inflammatory}} skin disease that often starts in childhood. Having eczema is troublesome and {{has been shown to}} reduce quality of life. Eczema is associated with an increased risk for other allergy - related diseases such as asthma and rhinitis. Knowledge co ncerning the natural course of eczema and its association with asthma and rhinitis in childhood is limited. Even though a majority of children with eczema have mild disease, most studies on quality of life and associations with asthma and rhinitis have bee n done in selected populations of children with moderate to severe eczema. New knowledge about eczema genetics and skin barrier function has highlighted the need for longitudinal studies to better understand the natural course of eczema as well as its asso ciation with eczema, asthma and rhinitis. The aim of this epidemiological study was to provide a better understanding of childhood eczema in the gener al population and especially its association with asthma and rhinitis. We used the population - based birth cohort BAMSE, including 4, 089 children followed up at age 0, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 years with parental questionnaires focusing on symptoms of allergy - related diseases and risk factors. In paper I we showed that allergy - related diseases affect a majority of children during the first 12 years of life and that eczema, asthma and rhinitis develop dynamic ally throughout childhood. In addition we found that comorbidity between allergy - related diseases increase with increasing age and that 7. 5 % of 12 - year - old child ren have two or three of the diseases eczema, asthma and rhinitis. In paper II we examined eczema severity at 12 years in relation to asthma, rhinitis and Filaggrin mutations. We found that the risk of having asthma and rhinitis was associated with eczem a severity, with the highest risk among boys with moderate to severe eczema. However, no association between Filaggrin mutations and severity of eczema was found. In paper III we show ed that e czema and even mild eczema among pre - adolescent girls is associ ated with impaired self - perceived health. Finally, in paper IV we examined prognosis and risk factors for eczema, asthma and rhinitis in pre - adolescence among children with <b>infantile</b> <b>eczema.</b> We found that a lmost half of the children with <b>infantile</b> <b>eczema</b> will have eczema, asthma or rhinitis in pre - adolescence but in three of four children the eczema will have remitted. We also found that e czema in the first but not the second year of life is associated with a good prognosis for eczema but an increased ris k of asthma and rhinitis in pre - adolescence. In conclusion the results of this thesis stress the importance of allergy - related diseases and in particular eczema among children as a public health concern. This thesis also demonstrates a strong association between eczema, asthma and rhinitis in childhood and emphasizes the importance of considering comorbidities between these diseases both in research and in clinical practice...|$|E

Symptoms attributed to house dust, pollens, and animals were noted two to three times more frequently by the skin test positive patients, while corticosteroid drugs had been used more commonly by the skin test negative patients (45 percent compared with 35 percent). No significant differences were observed with the other factors studied, namely, history of urticaria or angio-oedema, family history of "allergic" disease, and awareness of sensitivity to foods, aspirin or penicillin. Prick test reactions in the skin test positive patients were most commonly seen to house dust or the acarine mite, Dermatophagoides farinae (82 percent), followed by pollens (66 percent), animal danders (38 percent), foods (16 percent), Aspergillus fumigatus (16 percent), and other moulds (21 percent). There was a highly significant association of positive history with positive prick test for all allergens studied...|$|E
40|$|Background The atopic march {{hypothesis}} {{suggests that}} infants with eczema are {{at increased risk}} of asthma. Others argue that eczema is not a risk factor for asthma unless there is also sensitization or early wheezing. Objective To examine the role of <b>infantile</b> <b>eczema</b> as a predictor of risk of childhood asthma, while allowing for the effects of early wheeze, sensitization, and sex, both as independent effects and possible effect modifiers. Methods A total of 620 infants with a family history of allergic disease was recruited. Eczema and wheeze was prospectively documented to 2 years of age. Sensitization was determined by skin prick tests at 6, 12, and 24 months to 6 common food and inhalant allergens. Interviews were conducted at 6 and 7 years to ascertain current asthma. Results Sufficiently complete data were available for 403 children. Eczema within the first 2 years of life was clearly associated with an increased risk of childhood asthma in boys (adjusted odds ratio, 2. 45; 95 % CI, 1. 31 - 4. 46) but not in girls (odds ratio, 0. 88; 95 % CI, 0. 43 - 1. 77; P for interaction =. 031) even with adjustment for the effects of early allergic sensitization and wheeze. If these relationships are causal, an intervention to prevent eczema in boys might reduce the incidence of childhood asthma by as much as 28 %. Conclusion Eczema in the first 2 years of life is associated with an increased risk of childhood asthma in boys, but {{there is no evidence of}} this in girls. <br /...|$|E
40|$|To {{identify}} {{patterns of}} clinical history associated with extreme (high or low) probabilities of allergic sensitization in coughing children {{so as to}} restrict allergy testing to those with an intermediate probability of sensitization. A total of 752 children, aged 1 - 4, visiting their GPs for coughing (greater {{than or equal to}} 5 days), were tested for IgE-antibodies to house dust mite, cat and dog [RadioAllergoSorbent Test (RAST) ]. Parents completed a questionnaire on family history of atopy, breastfeeding, smoking, pets, and floor covering. Data of 640 children could be analyzed, 83 (13 %) were IgE-positive. In a logistic regression analysis, a scoring formula for the prediction of being IgE-positive was constructed using variables from the patient's history. Significant contributors for sensitization were: age (3 - 4 yr), <b>infantile</b> <b>eczema,</b> positive family history of mite-allergy, sibling(s) with pollen-allergy, and smoking by parents. If only one of these characteristics is present, the probability of sensitization is < 25 %. In such cases watchful waiting may be preferred over allergy testing. In other cases, a negative RAST may help to exclude sensitization, whereas a positive RAST helps to establish the diagnosis. Thus, acting on clinical history alone may save approximately 80 % of RAST's. Patient history-derived information contributes to distinguishing children who are at low risk for sensitization to house dust mite, cat, and dog. The scoring formula may help GPs to identify children with a low probability of being sensitized. This may form the basis for watchful waiting. In others, allergy testing may be useful to gain more diagnostic certaint...|$|E
40|$|Serum electrolytes-total base (T-B), {{chlorine}} (Cl), calcium (Ca) and {{inorganic phosphate}} (P) -were estimated, and the ratios T-B/K and K/Ca were obtained in 125 patients with widespread skin lesions who {{were seen in}} our clinic. The {{results of the investigation}} were compared with those reported in medical journals. 1. In eczema of both acute and chronic types, Cl and K levels were raised; in <b>infantile</b> <b>eczema,</b> P levels were raised. In eczema of all the types, the ratio K/Ca was almost {{in the middle of the}} normal range, while the ratio T-B/K tended to be slightly lowered in eczema of chronic type. 2. Dermatitis was associated with raised T-B and Cl levels and lowered Ca levels. In patients with eruption caused by alimentary intoxication, T-B, Cl and K levels were raised. The ratio K/Ca was almost in the middle of the normal range in both diseases, while the ratio T-B/K was within the lower normal range in patients with eruption caused by alimentary intoxication. 3. In erythema multif orme, Cl levels were raised; in erythema nodosum T-B and Cl levels were lowered; and in lupus erythematosus the ratio K/Ca was within the higher normal range and the ratio T-B/K was within the lower normal range. 4. In erythroderma, T-B levels were lowered and K levels were raised; in pityriasis rubra (Hebra type), T-B and Cl levels were lowered. In pityriasis rubra (Hebra type), the ratios K/Ca and T-B/K were within the higher normal range, while the ratio T-B/K was less than normal in erythroderma...|$|E
40|$|Growing {{evidence}} {{underlines the}} pivotal role of infant gut colonization {{in the development}} of the immune system. The possibility to modify gut colonization through probiotic supplementation in childhood might prevent atopic diseases. The aim of the present systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the effect of probiotic supplementation during pregnancy and early infancy in preventing atopic diseases. PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library were searched for randomized controlled trials evaluating the use of probiotics during pregnancy or early infancy for prevention of allergic diseases. Fixed-effect models were used, and random-effects models where significant heterogeneity was present. Results were expressed as risk ratio (RR) with 95 % confidence interval (CI). Seventeen studies, reporting data from 4755 children (2381 in the probiotic group and 2374 in the control group), were included in the meta-analysis. Infants treated with probiotics had a significantly lower RR for eczema compared to controls (RR 0. 78 [95 % CI: 0. 69 - 0. 89], P = 0. 0003), especially those supplemented with a mixture of probiotics (RR 0. 54 [95 % CI: 0. 43 - 0. 68], P < 0. 00001). No significant difference in terms of prevention of asthma (RR 0. 99 [95 % CI: 0. 77 - 1. 27], P = 0. 95), wheezing (RR 1. 02 [95 % CI: 0. 89 - 1. 17], P = 0. 76) or rhinoconjunctivitis (RR 0. 91 [95 % CI: 0. 67 - 1. 23], P = 0. 53) was documented. The results of the present meta-analysis show that probiotic supplementation prevents <b>infantile</b> <b>eczema,</b> thus suggesting a new potential indication for probiotic use in pregnancy and infanc...|$|E
40|$|Background: {{different}} maternal psychological {{states during}} pregnancy {{have been associated}} with wheeze–rhinitis–eczema symptoms in children. However, previous studies were limited and it was unclear whether the type of prenatal psychological state was associated with a particular symptom. We examined the association of maternal depression and anxiety during pregnancy with wheeze–rhinitis–eczema symptoms in infancy. Methods: in a longitudinal birth cohort (GUSTO) of 1152 mother–child pairs, wheeze–rhinitis–eczema symptoms in the infants {{during the first year of}} life were collected by parental report. Maternal depressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed at 26 weeks of gestation using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Logistic regression analyses were performed with adjustment for potential confounders. Results: an increased risk of wheezing was found in infants of pregnant women with probable depression (EPDS ? 15) [odds ratio (OR) = 1. 85 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 10 – 3. 12) ], and an increased risk of rhinitis was associated with maternal anxiety [STAI state ? 41 : OR = 1. 42 (95 % CI 1. 04 – 1. 93); STAI trait ? 43 : OR = 1. 38 (95 % CI 1. 01 – 1. 88) ]. After adjusting for known risk factors for the development of allergic disease, these associations remained significant [EPDS ? 15 : adjusted OR = 2. 09 (95 % CI 1. 05 – 4. 19); STAI state ? 41 : adjusted OR = 1. 82 (95 % CI 1. 17 – 2. 82); STAI trait ? 43 : adjusted OR = 1. 70 (95 % CI 1. 10 – 2. 61) ]. However, maternal psychological states were not associated with <b>infantile</b> <b>eczema.</b> Conclusion: this study suggests that there may be an independent effect of prenatal depression on wheezing and anxiety on rhinitis in infanc...|$|E
