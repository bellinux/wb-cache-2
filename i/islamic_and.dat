40|$|This {{research}} is aimed {{to examine the}} influences of <b>Islamic</b> identity <b>and</b> <b>Islamic</b> Fundamentalism on the tolerance for Christians, either directly or indirectly, mediated by the Islamic ethnocentrism in Indonesia. Such influences are constructed in the theoretical model of tolerance for Christians. In order to examine the model, {{data were collected from}} a sample consisting of 387 undergraduate Muslim students in the fourth semester in state higher education in Semarang, Indonesia by applying stratified cluster random sampling. The data collection used the Scale of Tolerance for Christians, Scale of Islamic Ethnocentrism, Scale of <b>Islamic</b> Identity, <b>and</b> Scale of <b>Islamic</b> Fundamentalism. The obtained data were then analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling. The results of the analysis indicated that: 1) The theoretical model of the influence of <b>Islamic</b> identity <b>and</b> <b>Islamic</b> fundamentalism on the tolerance for Christians, either directly or indirectly, mediated by Islamic ethnocentrism is valid or supported by the empirical data. 2). Variables of <b>Islamic</b> identity <b>and</b> <b>Islamic</b> fundamentalism have influences upon Islamic ethnocentrism. 3). Variables of Islamic identity, <b>Islamic</b> fundamentalism, <b>and</b> <b>Islamic</b> ethnocentrism have influences upon the tolerance for Christians. 4) <b>Islamic</b> identity <b>and</b> <b>Islamic</b> fundamentalism have indirect influences upon the tolerance for Christians through Islamic ethnocentrism...|$|R

5|$|In 1961, Nasser {{sought to}} firmly {{establish}} Egypt {{as the leader}} of the Arab world and to promote a second revolution in Egypt with the purpose of merging <b>Islamic</b> <b>and</b> socialist thinking. To achieve this, he initiated several reforms to modernize al-Azhar, which serves as the de facto leading authority in Sunni Islam, and to ensure its prominence over the Muslim Brotherhood and the more conservative Wahhabism promoted by Saudi Arabia. Nasser had used al-Azhar's most willing ulema (scholars) as a counterweight to the Brotherhood's Islamic influence, starting in 1953.|$|E

They are sometimes featured {{as a major}} character in films about particular animals, but also used as visual elements that assure the accuracy of historical stories. Both live horses and iconic images of horses are used in advertising to promote a variety of products. The horse frequently appears in coats of arms in heraldry, {{in a variety of}} poses and equipment.

5|$|In June 1973, Gaddafi {{created a}} {{political}} ideology {{as a basis}} for the Popular Revolution: Third International Theory. This approach regarded both the U.S. and the Soviet Union as imperialist and thus rejected Western capitalism as well as Eastern bloc communism's atheism. In this respect it was similar to the Three Worlds Theory developed by China's political leader Mao Zedong. As part of this theory, Gaddafi praised nationalism as a progressive force and advocated the creation of a pan-Arab state which would lead the <b>Islamic</b> <b>and</b> Third Worlds against imperialism. Gaddafi saw Islam as having a key role in this ideology, calling for an Islamic revival that returned to the origins of the Qur'an, rejecting scholarly interpretations and the Hadith; in doing so, he angered many Libyan clerics. During 1973 and 1974, his government deepened the legal reliance on sharia, for instance by introducing flogging as punishment for those convicted of adultery or homosexual activity.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} Indonesian independence, Suharto served in the Indonesian National Army, primarily in Java. In 1950, as a colonel, he led the Garuda Brigade in suppressing the Makassar Uprising, a rebellion of former colonial soldiers who supported the Dutch-established State of East Indonesia and its federal entity, the United States of Indonesia. During his year in Makassar, Suharto became acquainted with his neighbours, the Habibie family, whose eldest son BJ Habibie was later Suharto's vice-president, {{and went on to}} succeed him as President. In 1951–1952, Suharto led his troops in defeating the Islamic-inspired rebellion of Battalion 426 in the Klaten area of Central Java. Appointed to lead four battalions in early 1953, he organised their participation in battling Darul Islam insurgents in northwestern Central Java and anti-bandit operations in the Mount Merapi area. He also sought to stem leftist sympathies amongst his troops. His experience in this period left Suharto with a deep distaste for both <b>Islamic</b> <b>and</b> communist radicalism.|$|E
5|$|The Sultan of Brunei's {{stake in}} the {{ownership}} of the hotel drew controversy in April 2014 when he initiated {{the first phase of}} a three-phase plan to adapt Brunei's legal system to include aspects of Sharia law implicating his approval of the persecution of homosexuals in the complex legal system there (a two part system involving separate courts and legislation for <b>Islamic</b> <b>and</b> non-Islamic citizens). In protest, a United States national LGBT advocacy organization, the Gill Action Fund, canceled its reservation to hold a conference of major donors at the Beverly Hills Hotel and demanded a refund of its deposit. The hotel management responded by issuing a statement asserting that it does not discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation. Fashion designers Brian Atwood and Peter Som subsequently called for wider protests, urging the fashion industry to boycott all of the hotels owned by the Dorchester Collection.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} of the French cemeteries was complicated by even more heated arguments over how {{the bodies of the}} war dead should be dealt with. During the conflict the French war dead had ended up being split between special war cemeteries, local civilian cemeteries and some had been returned to their original villages. Catholic traditionalists in the government called for the bodies to be buried together in special cemeteries along the Western front, while others campaigned for them to be returned to local cemeteries. In 1919, the decision was taken to use special war cemeteries and to ban the repatriation of bodies, but by 1920 this decision had been reversed and 300,000 French bodies were repatriated to their original homes. The French war cemeteries were typically much larger than their IWGC equivalents and used concrete Catholic crosses for all the graves, {{with the exception of the}} <b>Islamic</b> <b>and</b> Chinese war dead.|$|E

The original Goan temple architecture fell into disuse as the temples were demolished by the Portuguese and the Sthapati known as Thavayi in Konkani were converted to Christianity though the wooden work and the Kavi murals can still be seen.
