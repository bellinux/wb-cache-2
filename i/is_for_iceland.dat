40|$|The 2011 world average carbon {{footprint}} of PV system manufacturing is estimated as 1798 kg CO 2 - eq/kWp using technology shares (multi, mono, film Si, CdTe, CIGS) as weighting factors. The electricity mixes of all production countries of poly-Si, wafer, cell and modules {{was taken into}} account. New yearly irradiation data (kWh/m 2) and PV energy output (kWh/kWp) are calculated for different regions in Europe on NUTS level 1 and 2 for horizontal, optimum and vertical angle. The world average {{carbon footprint}} of PV electricity generation is estimated as 55 g CO 2 - eq/kWh with cumulative installations as weighting factors. Lowest value of 38 g CO 2 -eq/kWh is for Cyprus which has a high irradiation and the highest value of 89 g CO 2 -eq/kWh <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>Iceland</b> which has a low irradiation. It is assumed that the PV modules are installed at optimal angle to the sun and end-of-life treatment is excluded. The majority of countries can decrease the greenhouse gas emission of electricity generation by increasing the share of photovoltaics. JRC. F. 7 -Renewables and Energy Efficienc...|$|E

The ground motion model is derived from a source model and its main purpose is to estimate ground motion for engineering purposes. The model has been applied to Icelandic earthquakes and parameters have been estimated from the data by means of inversion. In the current study the model is applied to the 29 May earthquake and an assessment is made of the fit to PGA data, from recorded ground motion, using estimated model parameters...|$|R

40|$|A {{linear model}} of {{orographic}} precipitation that includes airflow dynamics, condensed water advection, and downslope evaporation <b>is</b> adapted <b>for</b> <b>Iceland.</b> The model <b>is</b> driven using coarse-resolution 40 -yr reanalysis {{data from the}} European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ERA- 40) over the period 1958 – 2002. The simulated precipitation is in good agreement with precipitation observations accumulated over various time scales, {{both in terms of}} magnitude and distribution. The results suggest that the model captures the main physical processes governing orographic generation of precipitation in the mountains of Iceland. The approach presented in this paper offers a credible method to obtain a detailed estimate of the distribution of precipitation in mountainous terrain for various conditions involving orographic generation of precipitation. It appears to be of great practical value to the hydrologists, glaciologists, meteorologists, and climatologists. 1...|$|R
