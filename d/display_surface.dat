25|$|Physicians may {{consider}} diagnosing botulism if the patient's history and physical examination suggest botulism. However, these clues {{are often not}} enough to allow a diagnosis. Other diseases such as Guillain–Barré syndrome, stroke, and myasthenia gravis can appear similar to botulism, and special tests {{may be needed to}} exclude these other conditions. These tests may include a brain scan, cerebrospinal fluid examination, nerve conduction test (electromyography, or EMG), and an edrophonium chloride (Tensilon) test for myasthenia gravis. A definite diagnosis can be made if botulinum toxin is identified in the food, stomach or intestinal contents, vomit or feces. The toxin is occasionally found in the blood in peracute cases. Botulinum toxin can be detected by a variety of techniques, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), electrochemiluminescent (ECL) tests and mouse inoculation or feeding trials. The toxins can be typed with neutralization tests in mice. In toxicoinfectious botulism, the organism can be cultured from tissues. On egg yolk medium, toxin-producing colonies usually <b>display</b> <b>surface</b> iridescence that extends beyond the colony.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Larger <b>display</b> <b>surfaces</b> are {{becoming}} increasingly available due to multi-monitor capability built into many systems, {{in addition to the}} rapid decrease in their costs. However, {{little is known about the}} performance benefits of using these larger surfaces compared to traditional single-monitor displays. In addition, it is not clear that current software designs and interaction techniques have been properly tuned for these larger surfaces. A preliminary user study was carried out to provide some initial evidence about the benefits of large versus small <b>display</b> <b>surfaces</b> for complex, multi-application office work. Significant benefits were observed in the use of a prototype, larger display, in addition to significant positive user preference and satisfaction with its use over a small display. In addition, design guidelines for enhancing user interaction across large <b>display</b> <b>surfaces</b> were identified. User productivity could be significantly enhanced in future graphical user interface designs if developed with these findings in mind...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe use of <b>display</b> <b>surfaces,</b> that is {{windows as}} well as {{monitors}} or projection surfaces, is growing in diversity and complexity. Designers and programmers need a conceptual model of <b>display</b> <b>surfaces</b> to describe this diversity. We show how the conceptual models of windows and monitors have evolved during the last decades up to the current situation where the two concepts are converging. We analyse this evolution along three axes that provide the basic requirements for a unified model: the geometrical attributes of surfaces, their relationships with other display elements, and their position in space...|$|R

50|$|All emissive {{electronic}} displays (e.g. CRTs, PDPs) theoretically do not emit {{light in}} the black state (R=G=B=0%) and thus, under darkroom conditions with no ambient light reflected from the <b>display</b> <b>surface</b> into the light measuring device, the luminance of the black state is zero and thus the contrast becomes infinity.|$|E
