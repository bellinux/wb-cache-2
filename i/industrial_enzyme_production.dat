In this study, {{the roles}} of the PrtT homolog from Penicillum oxalicum was investigated by transcription profiling in combination with electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). The prtT deletion dramatically reduced extracellular protease activities and caused intracellular nutrient limitation when cultured on casein as the sole carbon source. PrtT was found to directly regulate the expression of an intracellular peptidase encoding gene (tripeptidyl-peptidase) and the gene encoding the extracellular dipeptidyl-aminopeptidase V, in addition to the expected extracellular peptidase genes (carboxypeptidase and aspergillopepsin). Five amylase genes (α-amylase, glucoamylase, α-glucosidase) and three major facilitator superfamily transporter genes related to maltose, monosaccharide and peptide transporting were also confirmed as putative targets of PrtT by EMSA. In contrast, the transcription levels of other genes encoding polysaccharide degrading enzymes (e. g. cellulases) and most iron or multidrug transporter encoding genes were up- or down-regulated in the ΔprtT mutant due to nutrient limitation resulting from the reduced usage of the sole carbon source, casein.

The use of codon-optimized genes may overcome this problem. However, designing a gene for optimal expression requires choosing from a vast number of possible DNA sequences and different codon optimization methods have been used in the past decade. Here, a comparative study of the two most common methods is presented using calf prochymosin as a model. Results Seven sequences encoding calf prochymosin have been designed, two using the "one amino acid-one codon" method and five using a "codon randomization" strategy. When expressed in Escherichia coli, the variants optimized by the codon randomization approach produced significantly more proteins than the native sequence including one gene that produced an increase of 70 % in the amount of prochymosin accumulated. On the other hand, no significant improvement in protein expression was observed for the variants designed with the one amino acid-one codon method. The use of codon-optimized sequences did not affect the quality of the recovered inclusion bodies. Conclusions The results obtained in this study indicate that the codon randomization method is a superior strategy for codon optimization.

All of them used the expression vectors to heterologously produce keratinase in B. subtilis. However, the expression plasmid used in B. subtilis would lead to problems of plasmid instability, which could reduce enzyme production, thereby interfering with enzyme production at the industrial level. The segregational and structural instability of B. subtilis plasmids are the two major, clearly described problems (Chen et al. 2007). To overcome these problems, researchers used theta mode plasmids that provide complete structural stability to express the enzyme. However, this type of plasmid still has the problem of segregational instability. The segregational instability of B. subtilis plasmids can be stabilized through the addition of selection marker (antibiotics or the deficiency components of amino acids) in the culture medium; however, this would increase the cost of fermentation and affect the environment in the industrial fermentation process.

Pretreatment with ionic liquids reduces lignocellulose recalcitrance to enzymatic hydrolysis, increasing yields of sugars for conversion into biofuels. However, commercial cellulases are not compatible with many ionic liquids, necessitating extensive water washing of pretreated biomass prior to hydrolysis. To circumvent this issue, previous research has demonstrated that several thermophilic bacterial cellulases can efficiently deconstruct lignocellulose {{in the presence of the}} ionic liquid, 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimadizolium acetate. As promising as these enzymes are, they would need to be produced at high titer in an <b>industrial</b> <b>enzyme</b> <b>production</b> host before they could be considered a viable alternative to current commercial cellulases. Aspergillus niger has been used to produce high titers of secreted enzymes in industry and therefore, we assessed the potential of this organism to be used as an expression host for these ionic liquid-tolerant cellulases. We demonstrated that 29 of these cellulases were expressed at detectable levels in a wild-type strain of A. niger, indicating a basic level of compatibility and potential to be produced at high levels in a host engineered to produce high titers of enzymes. We then profiled one of these enzymes in detail, the β-glucosidase A 5 IL 97, and compared versions expressed in both A. niger and Escherichia coli.

A combination of promoters, signal peptides and hosts were tested in order to obtain the best protein expression in this actinomycete. The xylanase, Xys 1, from S. halstedii, the α-amylase, Amy, from S. griseus and the small laccase, SLAC, from S. coelicolor were used as reporters. [Results]: The promoters xysAp from S. halstedii JM 8 and pstSp from S. lividans were the most efficient among those tested. An improvement of 17 % was obtained in xylanase activity when the signal peptide of the α-amylase protein (Amy) of S. griseus IMRU 3570 was used to direct its secretion. Enhanced expression of SsgA, a protein that plays a role in processes that require cell-wall remodelling, resulted in a improvement of 40 and 70 % of xylanase and amylase production, respectively. Deletion of genes SLI 7232 and SLI 4452 encoding putative repressors of xysAp provided improvement of production up to 70 % in the SLI 7232 deletion strain.

A potential future alternative to purchasing enzymes from an off-site manufacturer is to integrate <b>enzyme</b> and ethanol <b>production,</b> using microorganisms and part of the lignocellulosic material as feedstock for enzymes. This study modelled two such integrated process designs for ethanol from logging residues from spruce production, and compared it to an off-site case based on existing data regarding purchased enzymes. Greenhouse gas emissions and primary energy balances were studied in a life-cycle assessment, and cost performance in a techno-economic analysis. ResultsThe base case scenario suggests that greenhouse gas emissions per MJ of ethanol could be significantly lower in the integrated cases than in the off-site case. However, the difference between the integrated and off-site cases is reduced with alternative assumptions regarding enzyme dosage and the environmental impact of the purchased enzymes. The comparison of primary energy balances did not show any significant difference between the cases. The minimum ethanol selling price, to reach break-even costs, was from 0. 568 to 0. 622 EUR L− 1 for the integrated cases, as compared to 0. 581 EUR L− 1 for the off-site case. ConclusionsAn integrated process design could reduce greenhouse gas emissions from lignocellulose-based ethanol production, and the cost of an integrated process could be comparable to purchasing enzymes produced off-site.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{filamentous}} fungus Trichoderma reesei {{is an important}} host organism for <b>industrial</b> <b>enzyme</b> <b>production.</b> It is adapted to nutrient poor environments where {{it is capable of}} producing large amounts of hydrolytic enzymes. In its natural environment T. reesei is expected to benefit from high energy yield from utilization of respirative metabolic pathway. However, T. reesei lacks metabolic pathway reconstructions and the utilization of the respirative pathway has not been investigated on the level of in vivo fluxes. Results The biosynthetic pathways of amino acids in T. reesei supported by genome-level evidence were reconstructed with computational carbon path analysis. The pathway reconstructions were a prerequisite for analysis of in vivo fluxes. The distribution of in vivo fluxes in both wild type strain and cre 1, a key regulator of carbon catabolite repression, deletion strain were quantitatively studied by performing 13 C-labeling on both repressive carbon source glucose and non-repressive carbon source sorbitol. In addition, the 13 C-labeling on sorbitol was performed both in the presence and absence of sophorose that induces the expression of cellulase genes. Carbon path analyses and the 13 C-labeling patterns of proteinogenic amino acids indicated high similarity between biosynthetic pathways of amino acids in T. reesei and yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In contrast to S. cerevisiae, however, mitochondrial rather than cytosolic biosynthesis of Asp was observed under all studied conditions. The relative anaplerotic flux to the TCA cycle was low and thus characteristic to respiratory metabolism in both strains and independent of the carbon source. Only minor differences were observed in the flux distributions of the wild type and cre 1 deletion strain. Furthermore, the induction of the hydrolytic gene expression did not show altered flux distributions and did not affect the relative amino acid requirements or relative anabolic and respirative activities of the TCA cycle. Conclusion High similarity between the biosynthetic pathways of amino acids in T. reesei and yeast S. cerevisiae was concluded. In vivo flux distributions confirmed that T. reesei uses primarily the respirative pathway also when growing on the repressive carbon source glucose in contrast to Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which substantially diminishes the respirative pathway flux under glucose repression. </p...|$|E

It {{is one of the}} most important <b>industrial</b> <b>enzymes</b> for the <b>production</b> of semi-synthetic penicillin. PGAs have been found in numerous bacteria and fungi. The PGA gene has been isolated from different organism displays distinct biochemical properties which may be important for industrial aspects. In this study, 250 non E. coli, Enterobacteriasea that were collected from environmental and clinical samples, Transported to the laboratory and subjected for routine microbiological tests for identification of isolates. After identification, non E. coli isolates were investigated by PCR for processing of PGA gene. In this method, a PGA positive strain from an isolate that identified as Shigella boydii by standard microbiological test. DNA extracted from Shigella boydii entered in PCR reactions using primers designed on conserved region of PGA genes. The gene were cloned in pGEM-Teasy vector and submitted for sequencing. The gene encoding a Penicillin G acylase from Shigella boydii isolate contain an open reading frame of 2534 nucleotide encoding 796 amino acids. Analysis of sequencing result showed that this gene contain 98 % homology to previously reported PGA from a Shigella boydii strains...|$|R

While all living organism produce enzymes, microorganisms have been and are increasingly being used as cell factory for <b>enzyme</b> <b>production,</b> and as a source for various chemicals (therapeutics, bioethanol and bioplastics to name few) (Adrio and Demain 2005; Ai et al. 2003; Charbonneau et al. 2011; Demain and Adrio 2008; Paye et al. 2015; Rehman et al. 2007). Currently, most <b>industrial</b> <b>enzymes</b> originate from microorganisms like Bacillus, Aspergillus and Trichoderma (Apparao and Krishnaswamy 2015; Arora and Sandhu 1985; Bengtsson et al. 2006; Demain and Adrio 2008; Kubicek et al. 2001; Liu et al. 2013; Pandey et al. 1999). These biocatalysts have found applications in various fields that depend on hydrolytic, ligninolytic and biosynthetic processes, to name a few (Barr and Steven 1994; Braunegg et al. 2004; Chandra et al. 2011; Martínez et al. 2005; Nigam 2013).|$|R
