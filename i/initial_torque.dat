40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the effect of}} friction welding conditions on joining phenomena during the friction stage of type 7075 -T 6 aluminium alloy (A 7075) friction welds. The friction torque had wear and seizure stages until the <b>initial</b> peak <b>torque</b> when A 7075 was welded under high friction speed and low friction pressure, i. e. 27 · 5 rev s− 1 and 30 MPa. Initial seizure and joining began at the central region (centre axis) of the welded interface, and extended towards the peripheral region (outer surface). On the other hand, when A 7075 was welded under high friction speed and high friction pressure, i. e. 27 · 5 rev s− 1 and 90 MPa, almost no wear stage existed before the <b>initial</b> peak <b>torque.</b> <b>Initial</b> seizure and joining began at the peripheral region of the welded interface and extended towards the central region.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an analysis method of the friction torque and weld interface temperature during the friction process for steel friction welding. The joining mechanism {{model of the}} friction welding for the wear and seizure stages was constructed from the actual joining phenomena that were obtained by the experiment. The non-steady two-dimensional heat transfer analysis for the friction process {{was carried out by}} calculation with FEM code ANSYS. The contact pressure, heat generation quantity, and friction torque during the wear stage were calculated using the coefficient of friction, which was considered as the constant value. The thermal stress was included in the contact pressure. On the other hand, those values during the seizure stage were calculated by introducing the coefficient of seizure, which depended on the seizure temperature. The relationship between the seizure temperature and the relative speed at the weld interface in the seizure stage was determined using the experimental results. In addition, the contact pressure and heat generation quantity, which depended on the relative speed of the weld interface, were solved by taking the friction pressure, the relative speed and the yield strength of the base material into the computational conditions. The calculated friction torque and weld interface temperatures of a low carbon steel joint were equal to the experimental results when friction pressures were 30 and 90 MPa, friction speed was 27. 5 s- 1, and weld interface diameter was 12 mm. The calculation results of the <b>initial</b> peak <b>torque</b> and the elapsed time for <b>initial</b> peak <b>torque</b> were also equal to the experimental results under the same conditions.

40|$|This report {{describes}} the {{improvements in the}} joint properties of friction welded joint of 780 MPa class high tensile steel. Welded joint made by a continuous drive friction welding machine, the conventional method, had not obtained 100 % joint efficiency despite applying forge pressure. This {{was due to the}} softening of the welded interface zone for heat input during braking times. Therefore, we developed a continuous drive friction welding machine with an electromagnetic clutch to prevent heat input during braking time. We proposed the process as “The Low Heat Input Friction Welding Method (the LHI method). ” In this case, the joint had the same tensile strength as the base metal at friction time when the friction <b>torque</b> reached the <b>initial</b> peak <b>torque.</b> That is, the welded joint obtained 100 % joint efficiency by using only the friction stage up to the <b>initial</b> peak <b>torque</b> without the forge (upsetting) stage, despite the existence of a slightly softened region adjacent to the welded interface. Furthermore, the softened region was hardly generated when this joint was made by applying forge pressure at the <b>initial</b> peak <b>torque.</b> In conclusion, a welded joint of high tensile steel made by only the friction stage of the LHI method had excellent joint properties.

50|$|The motor which {{drives the}} fan {{and the oil}} pump is usually a {{capacitor}} start motor. It is a vortex shortage tank motor because it also contains a short cage or cage holds. The difference with a three-phase motor is in the stator. Where the vortex power motor has three coils aligned at 120° in the stator, the capacitor start motor holds one main winding and one auxiliary winding aligned at 90°. The phase shift of 90° between the main winding and the auxiliary winding is achieved by a connected capacitor which feeds the auxiliary winding and is connected on the single-phase AC mains. The capacitor will achieve a phase shift of 90° between the main and the auxiliary winding, producing an acceptable <b>initial</b> <b>torque.</b> This motor is intended for continuous operation.|$|E
50|$|Problems {{associated}} with {{the design of the}} axial piston engine include high oil consumption, high fuel consumption, low rpm limit imposed by previously discussed frictional loads, low overall horsepower, mechanical complexity and complex machining methods needs to allow the engine {{to stand up to the}} loads imposed on the components. Additional problems are noted in that, the design does not have a long lifespan when compared to other engine designs due to large numbers of moving parts and relative high stresses. Wear and tear occurs at a faster rate because the engine makes more power pulses per turn of the cam than traditional engines. Lastly, due to very high <b>initial</b> <b>torque</b> and a need for large amounts of coolant, loss of oil or coolant to this design during running will almost certainly result in a catastrophic explosion of the engine because the engine generally has very light casings or shields located in the area around the cams and connecting rods.|$|E
50|$|Controllers for {{brushless}} motors: E-bikes require high <b>initial</b> <b>torque</b> {{and therefore}} models that use brushless motors typically have Hall sensor commutation for speed and angle measurement. An electronic controller provides assistance {{as a function}} of the sensor inputs, the vehicle speed and the required force. The controllers generally allow input by means of potentiometer or Hall Effect twist grip (or thumb-operated lever throttle), closed-loop speed control for precise speed regulation, protection logic for over-voltage, over-current and thermal protection. Bikes with a pedal assist function typically have a disc on the crank shaft featuring a ring of magnets coupled with a Hall sensor giving rise to a series of pulses, the frequency of which is proportional to pedaling speed. The controller uses pulse width modulation to regulate the power to the motor. Sometimes support is provided for regenerative braking but infrequent braking and the low mass of bicycles limits recovered energy. An implementation is described in an application note for a 200 W, 24 V Brushless DC (BLDC) motor.|$|E

The study experimentally examines the loosening mechanisms of fasteners and assesses the anti-loosening {{performance of the}} three tested coatings based on their tightening characteristics, loosening curves, and the damage of thread surface. Additionally, the anti-loosening performance of the three coatings is compared under different load forms. The {{results indicate that the}} PTFE and MoS 2 coatings have significant anti-loosening effect, whereas the anti-loosening performance of TiN coating is not satisfactory. It is also found that an appropriate increase of the <b>initial</b> tightening <b>torque</b> can significantly improve the anti-loosening effect. In addition, the microscopic analyses of PTFE and MoS 2 coating reveal that a reduced <b>initial</b> tightening <b>torque</b> leads to fretting wear on the thread contact surfaces of fasteners, thereby aggravating the damage.|$|R

50|$|The process {{involves}} {{cycling the}} coupling {{a number of}} times at a lower inertia, lower speed or a combination of both. Burnishing can require anywhere from 20 to over 100 cycles depending upon the size of a coupling and the amount of <b>initial</b> <b>torque</b> required. For bearing mounted couplings, where the rotor and armature are connected and held in place via a bearing, burnishing does not have to take place on the machine. It can be done individually on a bench or in a group burnishing station. If a clutch has a separate armature and rotor (two piece unit) burnishing is done as a matched set, to make sure proper torque is achieved. Similarly, two-piece brakes that have separate armatures should be burnished on a machine rather than a bench because any change in the mounting tolerance as that brake is mounted to the machine may shift the alignment so the burnishing lines on the armature, rotor or brake face may be off, slightly preventing that brake from achieving full torque. Again, the difference is only slight so this would only be required in a very torque sensitive application.|$|E
5000|$|Given {{the unusual}} {{nature of this}} kick, it's arguable {{whether or not this}} move is a variant of the Double Leg or of another trick.

It starts out very similar to a Double leg in that the take off is done with both legs and the <b>initial</b> <b>torque</b> of the trick is similar too. Once the body is in the air, it lays more horizontally and both legs will kick outwards like a [...] "V". The kick out is done at the peak height to create a stall in the momentum and gives the temporary appearance of floating in mid-trick. The longer the legs are held in the kick position, the longer the stall. The legs are then brought back in to regain the lost momentum and to help reposition the body for a safe land. Kim Do Nguyen would normally land this trick into a kneeling position but others have landed this on both feet by cutting the stall shorter.|$|E
