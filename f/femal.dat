40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} role of gaze and gesture when {{subjects}} are collaboratively solving physics problems with a computer. The results from the study indicate that <b>femals</b> interacting together as pairs do use gaze significantly more than male pairs or those of mixed gender. There is evidence that gaze occurs during the planning stages of the problem solving activities and occurs more frequently by the speaker rather than the hearer during this phase. Mutual gazing occurs at this time too. The main finding is that differences in non-verbal communication strategies with respect to gender grouping effect not only the strategies that progress the collaborative process but more importantly also those that influence {{the understanding of the}} problem space. These results suggest the quality of video linkage will {{play an important role in}} collaborative problem solving for distance learners...|$|R

But since thou hast voutsaf't [...] 80 [...] Gently for our instruction to impart [...] Things above Earthly thought, which yet concernd [...] Our knowing, as to highest wisdom seemd, [...] Deign to descend now lower, and relate [...] What may no less perhaps availe us known, [...] How first began this Heav'n which we behold [...] Distant so high, with moving Fires adornd [...] Innumerable, and this which yeelds or fills [...] All space, the ambient Aire wide interfus'd [...] Imbracing round this florid Earth, what cause [...] 90 [...] Mov'd the Creator in his holy Rest [...] Through all Eternitie so late to build [...] In Chaos, and the work begun, how soon [...] Absolv'd, if unforbid thou maist unfould [...] What wee, not to explore the secrets aske [...] Of his Eternal Empire, but the more [...] To magnifie his works, the more we know. [...] And the great Light of Day yet wants to run [...] Much of his Race though steep, suspens in Heav'n [...] Held by thy voice, thy potent voice he heares, [...] 100 [...] And longer will delay to heare thee tell [...] His Generation, and the rising Birth [...] Of Nature from the unapparent Deep: [...] Or if the Starr of Eevning and the Moon [...] Haste to thy audience, Night with her will bring [...] Silence, and Sleep listning to thee will watch, [...] Or we can bid his absence, till thy Song [...] End, and dismiss thee ere the Morning shine. [...] Thus Adam his illustrous Guest besought: [...] And thus the Godlike Angel answerd milde. [...] 110 [...] This also thy request with caution askt [...] Obtaine: though to recount Almightie works [...] What words or tongue of Seraph can suffice, [...] Or heart of man suffice to comprehend? [...] Yet what thou canst attain, which best may serve [...] To glorifie the Maker, and inferr [...] Thee also happier, shall not be withheld [...] Thy hearing, such Commission from above [...] I have receav'd, to answer thy desire [...] Of knowledge within bounds; beyond abstain [...] 120 [...] To ask, nor let thine own inventions hope [...] Things not reveal'd, which th' invisible King, [...] Onely Omniscient, hath supprest in Night, [...] To none communicable in Earth or Heaven: [...] Anough is left besides to search and know. [...] But Knowledge is as food, and needs no less [...] Her Temperance over Appetite, to know [...] In measure what the mind may well contain, [...] Oppresses else with Surfet, and soon turns [...] Wisdom to Folly, as Nourishment to Winde. [...] 130 [...] Know then, that after Lucifer from Heav'n [...] (So call him, brighter once amidst the Host [...] Of Angels, then that Starr the Starrs among) [...] Fell with his flaming Legions through the Deep [...] Into his place, and the great Son returnd [...] Victorious with his Saints, th' Omnipotent [...] Eternal Father from his Throne beheld [...] Thir multitude, and to his Son thus spake. [...] At least our envious Foe hath fail'd, who thought [...] All like himself rebellious, by whose aid [...] 140 [...] This inaccessible high strength, the seat [...] Of Deitie supream, us dispossest, [...] He trusted to have seis'd, and into fraud [...] Drew many, whom thir place knows here no more; [...] Yet farr the greater part have kept, I see, [...] Thir station, Heav'n yet populous retaines [...] Number sufficient to possess her Realmes [...] Though wide, and this high Temple to frequent [...] With Ministeries due and solemn Rites: [...] But least his heart exalt him in the harme [...] 150 [...] Already done, to have dispeopl'd Heav'n, [...] My damage fondly deem'd, I can repaire [...] That detriment, if such it be to lose [...] Self-lost, {{and in a moment}} will create [...] Another World, out of one man a Race [...] Of men innumerable, there to dwell, [...] Not here, till by degrees of merit rais'd [...] They open to themselves at length the way [...] Up hither, under long obedience tri'd, [...] And Earth be chang'd to Heavn, & Heav'n to Earth, [...] 160 [...] One Kingdom, Joy and Union without end. [...] Mean while inhabit laxe, ye Powers of Heav'n, [...] And thou my Word, begotten Son, by thee [...] This I perform, speak thou, and be it don: [...] My overshadowing Spirit and might with thee [...] I send along, ride forth, and bid the Deep [...] Within appointed bounds be Heav'n and Earth, [...] Boundless the Deep, because I am who fill [...] Infinitude, nor vacuous the space. [...] Though I uncircumscrib'd my self retire, [...] 170 [...] And put not forth my goodness, which is free [...] To act or not, Necessitie and Chance [...] Approach not mee, and what I will is Fate. [...] So spake th' Almightie, and to what he spake [...] His Word, the Filial Godhead, gave effect. [...] Immediate are the Acts of God, more swift [...] Then time or motion, but to human ears [...] Cannot without process of speech be told, [...] So told as earthly notion can receave. [...] Great triumph and rejoycing was in Heav'n [...] 180 [...] When such was heard declar'd the Almightie's will; [...] Glorie they sung to the most High, good will [...] To future men, and in thir dwellings peace: [...] Glorie to him whose just avenging ire [...] Had driven out th' ungodly from his sight [...] And th' habitations of the just; to him [...] Glorie and praise, whose wisdom had ordain'd [...] Good out of evil to create, in stead [...] Of Spirits maligne a better Race to bring [...] Into thir vacant room, and thence diffuse [...] 190 [...] His good to Worlds and Ages infinite. [...] So sang the Hierarchies: Mean while the Son [...] On his great Expedition now appeer'd, [...] Girt with Omnipotence, with Radiance crown'd [...] Of Majestie Divine, Sapience and Love [...] Immense, and all his Father in him shon. [...] About his Chariot numberless were pour'd [...] Cherub and Seraph, Potentates and Thrones, [...] And Vertues, winged Spirits, and Chariots wing'd, [...] From the Armoury of God, where stand of old [...] 200 [...] Myriads between two brazen Mountains lodg'd [...] Against a solemn day, harnest at hand, [...] Celestial Equipage; and now came forth [...] Spontaneous, for within them Spirit livd, [...] Attendant on thir Lord: Heav'n op'nd wide [...] Her ever during Gates, Harmonious sound [...] On golden Hinges moving, to let forth [...] The King of Glorie in his powerful Word [...] And Spirit coming to create new Worlds. [...] On heav'nly ground they stood, and from the shore [...] 210 [...] They view'd the vast immeasurable Abyss [...] Outrageous as a Sea, dark, wasteful, wilde, [...] Up from the bottom turn'd by furious windes [...] And surging waves, as Mountains to assault [...] Heav'ns highth, and with the Center mix the Pole. [...] Silence, ye troubl'd waves, and thou Deep, peace, [...] Said then th' Omnific Word, your discord end: [...] Nor staid, but on the Wings of Cherubim [...] Uplifted, in Paternal Glorie rode [...] Farr into Chaos, and the World unborn; [...] 220 [...] For Chaos heard his voice: him all his Traine [...] Follow'd in bright procession to behold [...] Creation, and the wonders of his might. [...] Then staid the fervid Wheeles, and in his hand [...] He took the golden Compasses, prepar'd [...] In Gods Eternal store, to circumscribe [...] This Universe, and all created things: [...] One foot he center'd, and the other turn'd [...] Round through the vast profunditie obscure, [...] And said, thus farr extend, thus farr thy bounds, [...] 230 [...] This be thy just Circumference, O World. [...] Thus God the Heav'n created, thus the Earth, [...] Matter unform'd and void: Darkness profound [...] Cover'd th' Abyss: but on the watrie calme [...] His brooding wings the Spirit of God outspred, [...] And vital vertue infus'd, and vital warmth [...] Throughout the fluid Mass, but downward purg'd [...] The black tartareous cold infernal dregs [...] Adverse to life: then founded, then conglob'd [...] Like things to like, the rest to several place [...] 240 [...] Disparted, and between spun out the Air, [...] And Earth self-ballanc't on her Center hung. [...] Let ther be Light, said God, and forthwith Light [...] Ethereal, first of things, quintessence pure [...] Sprung from the Deep, and from her Native East [...] To journie through the airie gloom began, [...] Sphear'd in a radiant Cloud, for yet the Sun [...] Was not; shee in a cloudie Tabernacle [...] Sojourn'd the while. God saw the Light was good; [...] And light from darkness by the Hemisphere [...] 250 [...] Divided: Light the Day, and Darkness Night [...] He nam'd. Thus was the first Day Eev'n and Morn: [...] Nor past uncelebrated, nor unsung [...] By the Celestial Quires, when Orient Light [...] Exhaling first from Darkness they beheld; [...] Birth-day of Heav'n and Earth; with joy and shout [...] The hollow Universal Orb they fill'd, [...] And touch't thir Golden Harps, & hymning prais'd [...] God and his works, Creatour him they sung, [...] Both when first Eevning was, and when first Morn. [...] 260 [...] Again, God said, let ther be Firmament [...] Amid the Waters, and let it divide [...] The Waters from the Waters: and God made [...] The Firmament, expanse of liquid, pure, [...] Transparent, Elemental Air, diffus'd [...] In circuit to the uttermost convex [...] Of this great Round: partition firm and sure, [...] The Waters underneath from those above [...] Dividing: for as Earth, so hee the World [...] Built on circumfluous Waters calme, in wide [...] 270 [...] Crystallin Ocean, and the loud misrule [...] Of Chaos farr remov'd, least fierce extreames [...] Contiguous might distemper the whole frame: [...] And Heav'n he nam'd the Firmament: So Eev'n [...] And Morning Chorus sung the second Day. [...] The Earth was form'd, but in the Womb as yet [...] Of Waters, Embryon immature involv'd, [...] Appeer'd not: over all the face of Earth [...] Main Ocean flow'd, not idle, but with warme [...] Prolific humour soft'ning all her Globe, [...] 280 [...] Fermented the great Mother to conceave, [...] Satiate with genial moisture, when God said [...] Be gather'd now ye Waters under Heav'n [...] Into one place, and let dry Land appeer. [...] Immediately the Mountains huge appeer [...] Emergent, and thir broad bare backs upheave [...] Into the Clouds, thir tops ascend the Skie: [...] So high as heav'd the tumid Hills, so low [...] Down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep, [...] Capacious bed of Waters: thither they [...] 290 [...] Hasted with glad precipitance, uprowld [...] As drops on dust conglobing from the drie; [...] Part rise in crystal Wall, or ridge direct, [...] For haste; such flight the great command impress'd [...] On the swift flouds: as Armies at the call [...] Of Trumpet (for of Armies thou hast heard) [...] Troop to thir Standard, so the watrie throng, [...] Wave rowling after Wave, where way they found, [...] If steep, with torrent rapture, if through Plaine, [...] Soft-ebbing; nor withstood them Rock or Hill, [...] 300 [...] But they, or under ground, or circuit wide [...] With Serpent errour wandring, found thir way, [...] And on the washie Oose deep Channels wore; [...] Easie, e're God had bid the ground be drie, [...] All but within those banks, where Rivers now [...] Stream, and perpetual draw thir humid traine. [...] The dry Land, Earth, and the great receptacle [...] Of congregated Waters he call'd Seas: [...] And saw that it was good, and said, Let th' Earth [...] Put forth the verdant Grass, Herb yeilding Seed, [...] 310 [...] And Fruit Tree yeilding Fruit after her kind; [...] Whose Seed is in her self upon the Earth. [...] He scarce had said, when the bare Earth, till then [...] Desert and bare, unsightly, unadorn'd, [...] Brought forth the tender Grass, whose verdure clad [...] Her Universal Face with pleasant green, [...] Then Herbs of every leaf, that sudden flour'd [...] Op'ning thir various colours, and made gay [...] Her bosom smelling sweet: and these scarce blown, [...] Forth flourish't thick the clustring Vine, forth crept [...] 320 [...] The smelling Gourd, up stood the cornie Reed [...] Embattell'd in her field: add the humble Shrub, [...] And Bush with frizl'd hair implicit: last [...] Rose as in Dance the stately Trees, and spred [...] Thir branches hung with copious Fruit; or gemm'd [...] Thir Blossoms: with high Woods the Hills were crownd, [...] With tufts the vallies & each fountain side, [...] With borders long the Rivers. That Earth now [...] Seemd like to Heav'n, a seat where Gods might dwell, [...] Or wander with delight, and love to haunt [...] 330 [...] Her sacred shades: though God had yet not rain'd [...] Upon the Earth, and man to till the ground [...] None was, but from the Earth a dewie Mist [...] Went up and waterd all the ground, and each [...] Plant of the field, which e're it was in the Earth [...] God made, and every Herb, before it grew [...] On the green stemm; God saw that it was good: [...] So Eev'n and Morn recorded the Third Day. [...] Again th' Almightie spake: Let there be Lights [...] High in th' expanse of Heaven to divide [...] 340 [...] The Day from Night; and let them be for Signes, [...] For Seasons, and for Dayes, and circling Years, [...] And let them be for Lights as I ordaine [...] Thir Office in the Firmament of Heav'n [...] To give Light on the Earth; and it was so. [...] And God made two great Lights, great for thir use [...] To Man, the greater to have rule by Day, [...] The less by Night alterne: and made the Starrs, [...] And set them in the Firmament of Heav'n [...] To illuminate the Earth, and rule the Day [...] 350 [...] In thir vicissitude, and rule the Night, [...] And Light from Darkness to divide. God saw, [...] Surveying his great Work, that it was good: [...] For of Celestial Bodies first the Sun [...] A mightie Spheare he fram'd, unlightsom first, [...] Though of Ethereal Mould: then form'd the Moon [...] Globose, and everie magnitude of Starrs, [...] And sowd with Starrs the Heav'n thick as a field: [...] Of Light by farr the greater part he took, [...] Transplanted from her cloudie Shrine, and plac'd [...] 360 [...] In the Suns Orb, made porous to receive [...] And drink the liquid Light, firm to retaine [...] Her gather'd beams, great Palace now of Light. [...] Hither as to thir Fountain other Starrs [...] Repairing, in thir gold'n Urns draw Light, [...] And hence the Morning Planet guilds his horns; [...] By tincture or reflection they augment [...] Thir small peculiar, though from human sight [...] So farr remote, with diminution seen. [...] First in his East the glorious Lamp was seen, [...] 370 [...] Regent of Day, and all th' Horizon round [...] Invested with bright Rayes, jocond to run [...] His Longitude through Heav'ns high rode: the gray [...] Dawn, and the Pleiades before him danc'd [...] Shedding sweet influence: less bright the Moon, [...] But opposite in leveld West was set [...] His mirror, with full face borrowing her Light [...] From him, for other light she needed none [...] In that aspect, and still that distance keepes [...] Till night, then in the East her turn she shines, [...] 380 [...] Revolvd on Heav'ns great Axle, and her Reign [...] With thousand lesser Lights dividual holds, [...] With thousand thousand Starres, that then appeer'd [...] Spangling the Hemisphere: then first adornd [...] With thir bright Luminaries that Set and Rose, [...] Glad Eevning & glad Morn crownd the fourth day. [...] And God said, let the Waters generate [...] Reptil with Spawn abundant, living Soule: [...] And let Fowle flie above the Earth, with wings [...] Displayd on the op'n Firmament of Heav'n. [...] 390 [...] And God created the great Whales, and each [...] Soul living, each that crept, which plenteously [...] The waters generated by thir kindes, [...] And every Bird of wing after his kinde; [...] And saw that it was good, and bless'd them, saying, [...] Be fruitful, multiply, and in the Seas [...] And Lakes and running Streams the waters fill; [...] And let the Fowle be multiply'd on the Earth. [...] Forthwith the Sounds and Seas, each Creek & Bay [...] With Frie innumerable swarme, and Shoales [...] 400 [...] Of Fish that with thir Finns & shining Scales [...] Glide under the green Wave, in Sculles that oft [...] Bank the mid Sea: part single or with mate [...] Graze the Sea weed thir pasture, & through Groves [...] Of Coral stray, or sporting with quick glance [...] Show to the Sun thir wav'd coats dropt with Gold, [...] Or in thir Pearlie shells at ease, attend [...] Moist nutriment, or under Rocks thir food [...] In jointed Armour watch: on smooth the Seale, [...] And bended Dolphins play: part huge of bulk [...] 410 [...] Wallowing unweildie, enormous in thir Gate [...] Tempest the Ocean: there Leviathan [...] Hugest of living Creatures, on the Deep [...] Stretcht like a Promontorie sleeps or swimmes, [...] And seems a moving Land, and at his Gilles [...] Draws in, and at his Trunck spouts out a Sea.

40|$|During {{the past}} two years, we {{encountered}} 4 cases of colonic diverticulitis, who had been treated surgically. Kodeki and chiyama reviewed all cases of this disease reported in Japan until November, 1968. In addition, 534 cases of colonic diverticular disease were reported to us {{during the period from}} December, 1968 to 1973. Colonic diverticular is common in the age from 40 to 60 years old, and infrequent under 19 years old. Incidence of morbidity is higher in males than in <b>femals,</b> with a ratio of 2. 4 to 1. The 4 cases in this report were all males. The lesions of this disease are mostly located in the right half of the colon in Japanese, whereas they are analysis of the 100 cases collected in the literatures, are abdominal pain as seen in our cases, regardless of region of the involvement. However, intestinal bleeding occurs more frequently in the left colon than in the right colon. It is very difficult to differentiate this disease from acute appendicitis because of the similarity of symptom. The treatment of this disease was also discussed...|$|R

We researched the specific food products thought to have medicinal value, and concurrently, {{conducted a}} survey into awareness of the medicinal efficacy of these foodstuffs. The results are as compiled below. 1. Over 58 % of those surveyed, indicated they believed they were in normal good health. About 32 % felt they were overweight. 2. Only 44 % said they took three regular meals each day. 19 % said they did not eat regularly. 3. Foodstuffs considered to have medicinal properties included papaya, mushroom varieties, celery, bitter melon, garlic, lemon grass, most of wich are readily available in Okinawa. The favored culinary treatment was in soups. 4. Those who believed in the medicinal value tended to be elderly. Over 83 % of the <b>femals</b> respondents hoped to pass on the information on medicinal values to their children and grandchildren. 薬理効果のあるとされる食品材料の発掘を行い、その成人病予防因子についての科学的立証のための基礎資料を得る目的で、タイの人々の健康に対する意識、養生食に対する意識および薬理効果のあるとされる食品材料の利用状況についてのアンケート調査を行い、次の結果を得た。 1 ）調査対象者の 58 ％は自分はふだん健康だと感じており、約 32 ％は太っているほうだと思うと答えた。 2 ）約 77 ％の人が生活習慣病は食事に気を付けると予防できると答え、その割合は年齢が高くなるにつれて多くなっていた。養生食の効果を信じると答えたのは約 34 ％で、どちらとも言えないは約 54 ％であった。養生食について家族から聞いたことがあると答えたのは三世代家族の方で多く、約 71 ％は子や孫に伝えたいと思うと答えていた。 3 ）薬理効果のあるとされる食品材料として、高血圧症にセロリー、ファーターライチョーン、糖尿病ににがうり、チークの木、ニガニガグサなど、腎臓病にマツカサバレリヤ、にんにくなど、がんにきのこ類、にんにく、チークの葉など、便秘にパパイア、エビスグサモドキなどが挙げられていた。 4 ）薬理効果のある食品や薬草の調理手法には汁物（煎じものを含む）が多く用いられている...|$|R
40|$|According to the author, Richard Ekins’ {{case study}} on jazz history “provides {{preliminary}} data for a grounded theory of managing authenticity“. The paper is well written, entertaining to read and I can recognise the style from Ekins’ paper male <b>femaling</b> 1, one of my favourite GTs. The four concepts of trailblazing, mythologising, debunking and marginalising are catchy, interesting and make sense. Ekins says he has not done classic grounded theory but a conceptual description influenced by constructivist approaches. This is probably one explanation to why the main concepts in the paper are not tied together in a recognizable theoretical coding pattern. At least not to me. And the {{reason may be that}} the author has some more memo-sorting to do. This {{is an important part of}} classic GT, but often left out. By hand sorting memos, the integration of concepts to each other and to the core variable is improved since it stimulates writing of memos on memos. As such, the theoretical coding of the theory is stimulated – how concepts relate to each other as a typology, process, or any other possible conceptual constellation that explains what is going on in the substantive area...|$|R

[...] For what God after better worse would build? [...] Terrestrial Heav'n, danc't round by other Heav'ns [...] That shine, yet bear thir bright officious Lamps, [...] Light above Light, for thee alone, as seems, [...] In thee concentring all thir precious beams [...] Of sacred influence: As God in Heav'n [...] Is Center, yet extends to all, so thou [...] Centring receav'st from all those Orbs; in thee, [...] Not in themselves, all thir known vertue appeers [...] 110 [...] Productive in Herb, Plant, and nobler birth [...] Of Creatures animate with gradual life [...] Of Growth, Sense, Reason, all summ'd up in Man.

[...] Now whenas sacred Light began to dawne [...] In Eden on the humid Flours, that breathd [...] Thir morning Incense, when all things that breath, [...] From th' Earths great Altar send up silent praise [...] To the Creator, and his Nostrils fill [...] With gratefull Smell, forth came the human pair [...] And joynd thir vocal Worship to the Quire [...] Of Creatures wanting voice, that done, partake [...] The season, prime for sweetest Sents and Aires: [...] 200 [...] Then commune how that day they best may ply [...] Thir growing work: for much thir work outgrew [...] The hands dispatch of two Gardning so wide. [...] And Eve first to her Husband thus began. [...] Adam, well may we labour still to dress [...] This Garden, still to tend Plant, Herb and Flour. [...] Our pleasant task enjoyn'd, but till more hands [...] Aid us, the work under our labour grows, [...] Luxurious by restraint; what we by day [...] Lop overgrown, or prune, or prop, or bind, [...] 210 [...] One night or two with wanton growth derides [...] Tending to wilde. Thou therefore now advise [...] Or hear what to my mind first thoughts present, [...] Let us divide our labours, thou where choice [...] Leads thee, or where most needs, whether to wind [...] The Woodbine round this Arbour, or direct [...] The clasping Ivie where to climb, while I [...] In yonder Spring of Roses intermixt [...] With Myrtle, find what to redress till Noon: [...] For while so near each other thus all day [...] 220 [...] Our task we choose, what wonder if no near [...] Looks intervene and smiles, or object new [...] Casual discourse draw on, which intermits [...] Our dayes work brought to little, though begun [...] Early, and th' hour of Supper comes unearn'd. [...] To whom mild answer Adam thus return'd. [...] Sole Eve, Associate sole, to me beyond [...] Compare above all living Creatures deare, [...] Well hast thou motion'd, wel thy thoughts imployd [...] How we might best fulfill the work which here [...] 230 [...] God hath assign'd us, nor of me shalt pass [...] Unprais'd: for nothing lovelier can be found [...] In woman, then to studie houshold good, [...] And good workes in her Husband to promote. [...] Yet not so strictly hath our Lord impos'd [...] Labour, as to debarr us when we need [...] Refreshment, whether food, or talk between, [...] Food of the mind, or this sweet intercourse [...] Of looks and smiles, for smiles from Reason flow, [...] To brute deni'd, and are of Love the food, [...] 240 [...] Love not the lowest end of human life. [...] For not to irksom toile, but to delight [...] He made us, and delight to Reason joyn'd. [...] These paths and Bowers doubt not but our joynt [...] Will keep from Wilderness with ease, as wide [...] As we need walk, till younger hands ere long [...] Assist us: But if much converse perhaps [...] Thee satiate, to short absence I could yeild. [...] For solitude somtimes is best societie, [...] And short retirement urges sweet returne. [...] 250 [...] But other doubt possesses me, least harm [...] Befall thee sever'd from me; for thou knowst [...] What hath bin warn'd us, what malicious Foe [...] Envying our happiness, and of his own [...] Despairing, seeks to work us woe and shame [...] By sly assault; and somwhere nigh at hand [...] Watches, no doubt, with greedy hope to find [...] His wish and best advantage, us asunder, [...] Hopeless to circumvent us joynd, where each [...] To other speedie aide might lend at need; [...] 260 [...] Whether his first design be to withdraw [...] Our fealtie from God, or to disturb [...] Conjugal Love, then which perhaps no bliss [...] Enjoy'd by us excites his envie more; [...] Or this, or worse, leave not the faithful side [...] That gave thee being, stil shades thee and protects. [...] The Wife, where danger or dishonour lurks, [...] Safest and seemliest by her Husband staies, [...] Who guards her, or with her the worst endures. [...] To whom the Virgin Majestie of Eve, [...] 270 [...] As one who loves, and some unkindness meets, [...] With sweet austeer composure thus reply'd. [...] Ofspring of Heav'n and Earth, and all Earths Lord, [...] That such an enemie we have, who seeks [...] Our ruin, both by thee informd I learne, [...] And from the parting Angel over-heard [...] As in a shadie nook I stood behind, [...] Just then returnd at shut of Evening Flours. [...] But that thou shouldst my firmness therefore doubt [...] To God or thee, because we have a foe [...] 280 [...] May tempt it, I expected not to hear. [...] His violence thou fearst not, being such, [...] As wee, not capable of death or paine, [...] Can either not receave, or can repell. [...] His fraud is then thy fear, which plain inferrs [...] Thy equal fear that my firm Faith and Love [...] Can by his fraud be shak'n or seduc't; [...] Thoughts, which how found they harbour in thy Brest, [...] Adam, misthought of her to thee so dear? [...] To whom with healing words Adam reply'd. [...] 290 [...] Daughter of God and Man, immortal Eve, [...] For such thou art, from sin and blame entire: [...] Not diffident of thee do I dissuade [...] Thy absence from my sight, but to avoid [...] Th' attempt it self, intended by our Foe. [...] For hee who tempts, though in vain, at least asperses [...] The tempted with dishonour foul, suppos'd [...] Not incorruptible of Faith, not prooff [...] Against temptation: thou thy self with scorne [...] And anger wouldst resent the offer'd wrong, [...] 300 [...] Though ineffectual found: misdeem not then, [...] If such affront I labour to avert [...] From thee alone, which on us both at once [...] The Enemie, though bold, will hardly dare, [...] Or daring, first on mee th' assault shall light. [...] Nor thou his malice and false guile contemn; [...] Suttle he needs must be, who could seduce [...] Angels, nor think superfluous others aid. [...] I from the influence of thy looks receave [...] Access in every Vertue, in thy sight [...] 310 [...] More wise, more watchful, stronger, if need were [...] Of outward strength; while shame, thou looking on, [...] Shame to be overcome or over-reacht [...] Would utmost vigor raise, and rais'd unite. [...] Why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel [...] When I am present, and thy trial choose [...] With me, best witness of thy Vertue tri'd. [...] So spake domestick Adam in his care [...] And Matrimonial Love, but Eve, who thought [...] Less attributed to her Faith sincere, [...] 320 [...] Thus her reply with accent sweet renewd. [...] If this be our condition, thus to dwell [...] In narrow circuit strait'nd by a Foe, [...] Suttle or violent, we not endu'd [...] Single with like defence, wherever met, [...] How are we happie, still in fear of harm? [...] But harm precedes not sin: onely our Foe [...] Tempting affronts us with his foul esteem [...] Of our integritie: his foul esteeme [...] Sticks no dishonor on our Front, but turns [...] 330 [...] Foul on himself; then wherfore shund or feard [...] By us? who rather double honour gaine [...] From his surmise prov'd false, finde peace within, [...] Favour from Heav'n, our witness from th' event. [...] And what is Faith, Love, Vertue unassaid [...] Alone, without exterior help sustaind? [...] Let us not then suspect our happie State [...] Left so imperfet by the Maker wise, [...] As not secure to single or combin'd. [...] Fraile is our happiness, if this be so, [...] 340 [...] And Eden were no Eden thus expos'd. [...] To whom thus Adam fervently repli'd. [...] O Woman, best are all things as the will [...] Of God ordaind them, his creating hand [...] Nothing imperfet or deficient left [...] Of all that he Created, much less Man, [...] Or ought that might his happie State secure, [...] Secure from outward force; within himself [...] The danger lies, yet lies within his power: [...] Against his will he can receave no harme. [...] 350 [...] But God left free the Will, for what obeyes [...] Reason, is free, and Reason he made right, [...] But bid her well beware, and still erect, [...] Least by some faire appeering good surpris'd [...] She dictate false, and missinforme the Will [...] To do what God expresly hath forbid. [...] Not then mistrust, but tender love enjoynes, [...] That I should mind thee oft, and mind thou me. [...] Firm we subsist, yet possible to swerve, [...] Since Reason not impossibly may meet [...] 360 [...] Some specious object by the Foe subornd, [...] And fall into deception unaware, [...] Not keeping strictest watch, as she was warnd. [...] Seek not temptation then, which to avoide [...] Were better, and most likelie if from mee [...] Thou sever not; Trial will come unsought. [...] Wouldst thou approve thy constancie, approve [...] First thy obedience; th' other who can know, [...] Not seeing thee attempted, who attest? [...] But if thou think, trial unsought may finde [...] 370 [...] Us both securer then thus warnd thou seemst, [...] Go; for thy stay, not free, absents thee more; [...] Go in thy native innocence, relie [...] On what thou hast of vertue, summon all, [...] For God towards thee hath done his part, do thine. [...] So spake the Patriarch of Mankinde, but Eve [...] Persisted, yet submiss, though last, repli'd. [...] With thy permission then, and thus forewarnd [...] Chiefly by what thy own last reasoning words [...] Touchd onely, that our trial, when least sought, [...] 380 [...] May finde us both perhaps farr less prepar'd, [...] The willinger I goe, nor much expect [...] A Foe so proud will first the weaker seek; [...] So bent, the more shall shame him his repulse. [...] Thus saying, from her Husbands hand her hand [...] Soft she withdrew, and like a Wood-Nymph light [...] Oread or Dryad, or of Delia's Traine, [...] Betook her to the Groves, but Delia's self [...] In gate surpass'd and Goddess-like deport, [...] Though not as shee with Bow and Quiver armd, [...] 390 [...] But with such Gardning Tools as Are yet rude, [...] Guiltless of fire had formd, or Angels brought, [...] To Pales, or Pomona, thus adornd, [...] Likest she seemd, Pomona when she fled [...] Vertumnus, or to Ceres in her Prime, [...] Yet Virgin of Proserpina from Jove. [...] Her long with ardent look his Eye pursu'd [...] Delighted, but desiring more her stay. [...] Oft he to her his charge of quick returne, [...] Repeated, shee to him as oft engag'd [...] 400 [...] To be returnd by Noon amid the Bowre, [...] And all things in best order to invite [...] Noontide repast, or Afternoons repose. [...] O much deceav'd, much failing, hapless Eve, [...] Of thy presum'd return! event perverse! [...] Thou never from that houre in Paradise [...] Foundst either sweet repast, or found repose; [...] Such ambush hid among sweet Flours and Shades [...] Waited with hellish rancor imminent [...] To intercept thy way, or send thee back [...] 410 [...] Despoild of Innocence, of Faith, of Bliss. [...] For now, and since first break of dawne the Fiend, [...] Meer Serpent in appearance, forth was come, [...] And on his Quest, where likeliest he might finde [...] The onely two of Mankinde, but in them [...] The whole included Race, his purposd prey. [...] In Bowre and Field he sought, where any tuft [...] Of Grove or Garden-Plot more pleasant lay, [...] Thir tendance or Plantation for delight, [...] By Fountain or by shadie Rivulet [...] 420 [...] He sought them both, but wish'd his hap might find [...] Eve separate, he wish'd, but not with hope [...] Of what so seldom chanc'd, when to his wish, [...] Beyond his hope, Eve separate he spies, [...] Veild in a Cloud of Fragrance, where she stood, [...] Half spi'd, so thick the Roses bushing round [...] About her glowd, oft stooping to support [...] Each Flour of slender stalk, whose head though gay [...] Carnation, Purple, Azure, or spect with Gold, [...] Hung drooping unsustaind, them she upstaies [...] 430 [...] Gently with Mirtle band, mindless the while, [...] Her self, though fairest unsupported Flour, [...] From her best prop so farr, and storm so nigh. [...] Neerer he drew, and many a walk travers'd [...] Of stateliest Covert, Cedar, Pine, or Palme, [...] Then voluble and bold, now hid, now seen [...] Among thick-wov'n Arborets and Flours [...] Imborderd on each Bank, the hand of Eve: [...] Spot more delicious then those Gardens feign'd [...] Or of reviv'd Adonis, or renownd [...] 440 [...] Alcinous, host of old Laertes Son, [...] Or that, not Mystic, where the Sapient King [...] Held dalliance with his faire Egyptian Spouse. [...] Much hee the Place admir'd, the Person more. [...] As one who long in populous City pent, [...] Where Houses thick and Sewers annoy the Aire, [...] Forth issuing on a Summers Morn, to breathe [...] Among the pleasant Villages and Farmes [...] Adjoynd, from each thing met conceaves delight, [...] The smell of Grain, or tedded Grass, or Kine, [...] 450 [...] Or Dairie, each rural sight, each rural sound; [...] If chance with Nymphlike step fair Virgin pass, [...] What pleasing seemd, for her now pleases more, [...] She most, and in her look summs all Delight. [...] Such Pleasure took the Serpent to behold [...] This Flourie Plat, the sweet recess of Eve [...] Thus earlie, thus alone; her Heav'nly forme [...] Angelic, but more soft, and Feminine, [...] Her graceful Innocence, her every Aire [...] Of gesture or lest action overawd [...] 460 [...] His Malice, and with rapine sweet bereav'd [...] His fierceness of the fierce intent it brought: [...] That space the Evil one abstracted stood [...] From his own evil, and for the time remaind [...] Stupidly good, of enmitie disarm'd, [...] Of guile, of hate, of envie, of revenge; [...] But the hot Hell that alwayes in him burnes, [...] Though in mid Heav'n, soon ended his delight, [...] And tortures him now more, the more he sees [...] Of pleasure not for him ordain'd: then soon [...] 470 [...] Fierce hate he recollects, and all his thoughts [...] Of mischief, gratulating, thus excites. [...] Thoughts, whither have he led me, with what sweet [...] Compulsion thus transported to forget [...] What hither brought us, hate, not love, nor hope [...] Of Paradise for Hell, hope here to taste [...] Of pleasure, but all pleasure to destroy, [...] Save what is in destroying, other joy [...] To me is lost. Then let me not let pass [...] Occasion which now smiles, behold alone [...] 480 [...] The Woman, opportune to all attempts, [...] Her Husband, for I view far round, not nigh, [...] Whose higher intellectual more I shun, [...] And strength, of courage hautie, and of limb [...] Heroic built, though of terrestrial mould, [...] Foe not informidable, exempt from wound, [...] I not; so much hath Hell debas'd, and paine [...] Infeebl'd me, to what I was in Heav'n. [...] Shee fair, divinely fair, fit Love for Gods, [...] Not terrible, though terrour be in Love [...] 490 [...] And beautie, not approacht by stronger hate, [...] Hate stronger, under shew of Love well feign'd, [...] The way which to her ruin now I tend. [...] So spake the Enemie of Mankind, enclos'd [...] In Serpent, Inmate bad, and toward Eve [...] Address'd his way, not with indented wave, [...] Prone on the ground, as since, but on his reare, [...] Circular base of rising foulds, that tour'd [...] Fould above fould a surging Maze, his Head [...] Crested aloft, and Carbuncle his Eyes; [...] 500 [...] With burnisht Neck of verdant Gold, erect [...] Amidst his circling Spires, that on the grass [...] Floted redundant: pleasing was his shape, [...] And lovely, never since of Serpent kind [...] Lovelier, not those that in Illyria chang'd [...] Hermione and Cadmus, or the God [...] In Epidaurus; nor to which transformd [...] Ammonian Jove, or Capitoline was seen, [...] Hee with Olympias, this with her who bore [...] Scipio the highth of Rome. With tract oblique [...] 510 [...] At first, as one who sought access, but feard [...] To interrupt, side-long he works his way. [...] As when a Ship by skilful Stearsman wrought [...] Nigh Rivers mouth or Foreland, where the Wind [...] Veres oft, as oft so steers, and shifts her Saile; [...] So varied hee, and of his tortuous Traine [...] Curld many a wanton wreath in sight of Eve, [...] To lure her Eye; shee busied heard the sound [...] Of rusling Leaves, but minded not, as us'd [...] To such disport before her through the Field, [...] 520 [...] From every Beast, more duteous at her call, [...] Then at Circean call the Herd disguis'd. [...] Hee boulder now, uncall'd before her stood; [...] But as in gaze admiring: Oft he bowd [...] His turret Crest, and sleek enamel'd Neck, [...] Fawning, and lick'd the ground whereon she trod. [...] His gentle dumb expression turnd at length [...] The Eye of Eve to mark his play; he glad [...] Of her attention gaind, with Serpent Tongue [...] Organic, or impulse of vocal Air, [...] 530 [...] His fraudulent temptation thus began. [...] Wonder not, sovran Mistress, if perhaps [...] Thou canst, who art sole Wonder, much less arm [...] Thy looks, the Heav'n of mildness, with disdain, [...] Displeas'd that I approach thee thus, and gaze [...] Insatiate, I thus single; nor have feard [...] Thy awful brow, more awful thus retir'd. [...] Fairest resemblance of thy Maker faire, [...] Thee all living things gaze on, all things thine [...] By gift, and thy Celestial Beautie adore [...] 540 [...] With ravishment beheld, there best beheld [...] Where universally admir'd; but here [...] In this enclosure wild, these Beasts among, [...] Beholders rude, and shallow to discerne [...] Half what in thee is fair, one man except, [...] Who sees thee? (and what is one?) who shouldst be seen [...] A Goddess among Gods, ador'd and serv'd [...] By Angels numberless, thy daily Train. [...] So gloz'd the Tempter, and his Proem tun'd; [...] Into the Heart of Eve his words made way, [...] 550 [...] Though at the voice much marveling; at length [...] Not unamaz'd she thus in answer spake. [...] What may this mean? Language of Man pronounc't [...] By Tongue of Brute, and human sense exprest? [...] The first at lest of these I thought deni'd [...] To Beasts, whom God on their Creation-Day [...] Created mute to all articulat sound; [...] The latter I demurre, for in thir looks [...] Much reason, and in thir actions oft appeers. [...] Thee, Serpent, suttlest beast of all the field [...] 560 [...] I knew, but not with human voice endu'd; [...] Redouble then this miracle, and say, [...] How cam'st thou speakable of mute, and how [...] To me so friendly grown above the rest [...] Of brutal kind, that daily are in sight? [...] Say, for such wonder claims attention due. [...] To whom the guileful Tempter thus reply'd. [...] Empress of this fair World, resplendent Eve, [...] Easie to mee it is to tell thee all [...] What thou commandst, and right thou shouldst be obeyd: [...] 570 [...] I was at first as other Beasts that graze [...] The trodden Herb, of abject thoughts and low, [...] As was my food, nor aught but food discern'd [...] Or Sex, and apprehended nothing high: [...] Till on a day roaving the field, I chanc'd [...] A goodly Tree farr distant to behold [...] Loaden with fruit of fairest colours mixt, [...] Ruddie and Gold: I nearer drew to gaze; [...] When from the boughes a savorie odour blow'n, [...] Grateful to appetite, more pleas'd my sense [...] 580 [...] Then smell of sweetest Fenel, or the Teats [...] Of Ewe or Goat dropping with Milk at Eevn, [...] Unsuckt of Lamb or Kid, that tend thir play. [...] To satisfie the sharp desire I had [...] Of tasting those fair Apples, I resolv'd [...] Not to deferr; hunger and thirst at once, [...] Powerful perswaders, quick'nd at the scent [...] Of that alluring fruit, urg'd me so keene. [...] About the Mossie Trunk I wound me soon, [...] For high from ground the branches would require [...] 590 [...] Thy utmost reach or Adams: Round the Tree [...] All other Beasts that saw, with like desire [...] Longing and envying stood, but could not reach. [...] Amid the Tree now got, where plentie hung [...] Tempting so nigh, to pluck and eat my fill [...] I spar'd not, for such pleasure till that hour [...] At Feed or Fountain never had I found. [...] Sated at length, ere long I might perceave [...] Strange alteration in me, to degree [...] Of Reason in my inward Powers, and Speech [...] 600 [...] Wanted not long, though to this shape retaind. [...] Thenceforth to Speculations high or deep [...] I turnd my thoughts, and with capacious mind [...] Considerd all things visible in Heav'n, [...] Or Earth, or Middle, all things fair and good; [...] But all that fair and good in thy Divine [...] Semblance, and in thy Beauties heav'nly Ray [...] United I beheld; no Fair to thine [...] Equivalent or second, which compel'd [...] Mee thus, though importune perhaps, to come [...] 610 [...] And gaze, and worship thee of right declar'd [...] Sovran of Creatures, universal Dame. [...] So talk'd the spirited sly Snake; and Eve [...] Yet more amaz'd unwarie thus reply'd. [...] Serpent, thy overpraising leaves in doubt [...] The vertue of that Fruit, in thee first prov'd: [...] But say, where grows the Tree, from hence how far? [...] For many are the Trees of God that grow [...] In Paradise, and various, yet unknown [...] To us, in such abundance lies our choice, [...] 620 [...] As leaves a greater store of Fruit untoucht, [...] Still hanging incorruptible, till men [...] Grow up to thir provision, and more hands [...] Help to disburden Nature of her Bearth. [...] To whom the wilie Adder, blithe and glad. [...] Empress, the way is readie, and not long, [...] Beyond a row of Myrtles, on a Flat, [...] Fast by a Fountain, one small Thicket past [...] Of blowing Myrrh and Balme; if thou accept [...] My conduct, I can bring thee thither soon. [...] 630 [...] Lead then, said Eve. Hee leading swiftly rowld [...] In tangles, and make intricate seem strait, [...] To mischief swift. Hope elevates, and joy [...] Bright'ns his Crest, as when a wandring Fire [...] Compact of unctuous vapor, which the Night [...] Condenses, and the cold invirons round, [...] Kindl'd through agitation to a Flame, [...] Which oft, they say, some evil Spirit attends, [...] Hovering and blazing with delusive Light, [...] Misleads th' amaz'd Night-wanderer from his way [...] 640 [...] To Boggs and Mires, & oft through Pond or Poole, [...] There swallow'd up and lost, from succour farr. [...] So glister'd the dire Snake and into fraud [...] Led Eve our credulous Mother, to the Tree [...] Of prohibition, root of all our woe; [...] Which when she saw, thus to her guide she spake. [...] Serpent, we might have spar'd our coming hither, [...] Fruitless to me, though Fruit be here to excess, [...] The credit of whose vertue rest with thee, [...] Wondrous indeed, if cause of such effects. [...] 650 [...] But of this Tree we may not taste nor touch; [...] God so commanded, and left that Command [...] Sole Daughter of his voice; the rest, we live [...] Law to our selves, our Reason is our Law. [...] To whom the Tempter guilefully repli'd. [...] Indeed? hath God then said that of the Fruit [...] Of all these Garden Trees ye shall not eate, [...] Yet Lords declar'd of all in Earth or Aire? [...] To whom thus Eve yet sinless. Of the Fruit [...] Of each Tree in the Garden we may eate, [...] 660 [...] But of the Fruit of this fair Tree amidst [...] The Garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eate [...] Thereof, nor shall ye touch it, least ye die. [...] She scarse had said, though brief, when now more bold [...] The Tempter, but with shew of Zeale and Love [...] To Man, and indignation at his wrong, [...] New part puts on, and as to passion mov'd, [...] Fluctuats disturbd, yet comely, and in act [...] Rais'd, as of som great matter to begin. [...] As when of old som Orator renound [...] 670 [...] In Athens or free Rome, where Eloquence [...] Flourishd, since mute, to som great cause addrest, [...] Stood in himself collected, while each part, [...] Motion, each act won audience ere the tongue, [...] Somtimes in highth began, as no delay [...] Of Preface brooking through his Zeal of Right. [...] So standing, moving, or to highth upgrown [...] The Tempter all impassiond thus began. [...] O Sacred, Wise, and Wisdom-giving Plant, [...] Mother of Science, Now I feel thy Power [...] 680 [...] Within me cleere, not onely to discerne [...] Things in thir Causes, but to trace the wayes [...] Of highest Agents, deemd however wise. [...] Queen of this Universe, doe not believe [...] Those rigid threats of Death; ye shall not Die: [...] How should ye? by the Fruit? it gives you Life [...] To Knowledge? By the Threatner, look on mee, [...] Mee who have touch'd and tasted, yet both live, [...] And life more perfet have attaind then Fate [...] Meant mee, by ventring higher then my Lot. [...] 690 [...] Shall that be shut to Man, which to the Beast [...] Is open? or will God incense his ire [...] For such a pretty Trespass, and not praise [...] Rather your dauntless vertue, whom the pain [...] Of Death denounc't, whatever thing Death be, [...] Deterrd not from atchieving what might leade [...] To happier life, knowledge of Good and Evil; [...] Of good, how just? of evil, if what is evil [...] Be real, why not known, since easier shunnd? [...] God therefore cannot hurt ye, and be just; [...] 700 [...] Not just, not God; not feard then, nor obeid: [...] Your feare it self of Death removes the feare. [...] Why then was this forbid? Why but to awe, [...] Why but to keep ye low and ignorant, [...] His worshippers; he knows that in the day [...] Ye Eate thereof, your Eyes that seem so cleere, [...] Yet are but dim, shall perfetly be then [...] Op'nd and cleerd, and ye shall be as Gods, [...] Knowing both Good and Evil as they know. [...] That ye should be as Gods, since I as Man, [...] 710 [...] Internal Man, is but proportion meet, [...] I of brute human, yee of human Gods. [...] So ye shalt die perhaps, by putting off [...] Human, to put on Gods, death to be wisht, [...] Though threat'nd, which no worse then this can bring [...] And what are Gods that Man may not become [...] As they, participating God-like food? [...] The Gods are first, and that advantage use [...] On our belief, that all from them proceeds, [...] I question it, for this fair Earth I see, [...] 720 [...] Warm'd by the Sun, producing every kind, [...] Them nothing: If they all things, who enclos'd [...] Knowledge of Good and Evil in this Tree, [...] That whoso eats thereof, forthwith attains [...] Wisdom without their leave? and wherein lies [...] Th' offence, that Man should thus attain to know? [...] What can your knowledge hurt him, or this Tree [...] Impart against his will if all be his? [...] Or is it envie, and can envie dwell [...] In heav'nly brests? these, these and many more [...] 730 [...] Causes import your need of this fair Fruit. [...] Goddess humane, reach then, and freely taste. [...] He ended, and his words replete with guile [...] Into her heart too easie entrance won: [...] Fixt on the Fruit she gaz'd, which to behold [...] Might tempt alone, and in her ears the sound [...] Yet rung of his perswasive words, impregn'd [...] With Reason, to her seeming, and with Truth; [...] Meanwhile the hour of Noon drew on, and wak'd [...] An eager appetite, rais'd by the smell [...] 740 [...] So savorie of that Fruit, which with desire, [...] Inclinable now grown to touch or taste, [...] Sollicited her longing eye; yet first [...] Pausing a while, thus to her self she mus'd. [...] Great are thy Vertues, doubtless, best of Fruits, [...] Though kept from Man, & worthy to be admir'd, [...] Whose taste, too long forborn, at first assay [...] Gave elocution to the mute, and taught [...] The Tongue not made for Speech to speak thy praise: [...] Thy praise hee also who forbids thy use, [...] 750 [...] Conceales not from us, naming thee the Tree [...] Of Knowledge, knowledge both of good and evil; [...] Forbids us then to taste, but his forbidding [...] Commends thee more, while it inferrs the good [...] By thee communicated, and our want: [...] For good unknown, sure is not had, or had [...] And yet unknown, is as not had at all. [...] In plain then, what forbids he but to know, [...] Forbids us good, forbids us to be wise? [...] Such prohibitions binde not. But if Death [...] 760 [...] Bind us with after-bands, what profits then [...] Our inward freedom? In the day we eate [...] Of this fair Fruit, our doom is, we shall die. [...] How dies the Serpent? hee hath eat'n and lives, [...] And knows, and speaks, and reasons, and discernes, [...] Irrational till then. For us alone [...] Was death invented? or to us deni'd [...] This intellectual food, for beasts reserv'd? [...] For Beasts it seems: yet that one Beast which first [...] Hath tasted, envies not, but brings with joy [...] 770 [...] The good befall'n him, Author unsuspect, [...] Friendly to man, farr from deceit or guile. [...] What fear I then, rather what know to feare [...] Under this ignorance of Good and Evil, [...] Of God or Death, of Law or Penaltie? [...] Here grows the Cure of all, this Fruit Divine, [...] Fair to the Eye, inviting to the Taste, [...] Of vertue to make wise: what hinders then [...] To reach, and feed at once both Bodie and Mind? [...] So saying, her rash hand in evil hour [...] 780 [...] Forth reaching to the Fruit, she pluck'd, she eat: [...] Earth felt the wound, and Nature from her seat [...] Sighing through all her Works gave signs of woe, [...] That all was lost. Back to the Thicket slunk [...] The guiltie Serpent, and well might, for Eve [...] Intent now wholly on her taste, naught else [...] Regarded, such delight till then, as seemd, [...] In Fruit she never tasted, whether true [...] Or fansied so, through expectation high [...] Of knowledg, nor was God-head from her thought. [...] 790 [...] Greedily she ingorg'd without restraint, [...] And knew not eating Death: Satiate at length, [...] And hight'nd as with Wine, jocond and boon, [...] Thus to her self she pleasingly began. [...] O Sovran, vertuous, precious of all Trees [...] In Paradise, of operation blest [...] To Sapience, hitherto obscur'd, infam'd, [...] And thy fair Fruit let hang, as to no end [...] Created; but henceforth my early care, [...] Not without Song, each Morning, and due praise [...] 800 [...] Shall tend thee, and the fertil burden ease [...] Of thy full branches offer'd free to all; [...] Till dieted by thee I grow mature [...] In knowledge, as the Gods who all things know; [...] Though others envie what they cannot give; [...] For had the gift bin theirs, it had not here [...] Thus grown. Experience, next to thee I owe, [...] Best guide; not following thee, I had remaind [...] In ignorance, thou op'nst Wisdoms way, [...] And giv'st access, though secret she retire. [...] 810 [...] And I perhaps am secret; Heav'n is high, [...] High and remote to see from thence distinct [...] Each thing on Earth; and other care perhaps [...] May have diverted from continual watch [...] Our great Forbidder, safe with all his Spies [...] About him. But to Adam in what sort [...] Shall I appeer? shall I to him make known [...] As yet my change, and give him to partake [...] Full happiness with mee, or rather not, [...] But keep the odds of Knowledge in my power [...] 820 [...] Without Copartner? so to add what wants [...] In <b>Femal</b> Sex, the more to draw his Love, [...] And render me more equal, and perhaps [...] A thing not undesireable, somtime [...] Superior; for inferior who is free? [...] This may be well: but what if God have seen, [...] And Death ensue? then I shall be no more, [...] And Adam wedded to another Eve, [...] Shall live with her enjoying, I extinct; [...] A death to think. Confirm'd then I resolve, [...] 830 [...] Adam shall share with me in bliss or woe: [...] So dear I love him, that with him all deaths [...] I could endure; without him live no life. [...] So saying, from the Tree her step she turnd, [...] But first low Reverence don, as to the power [...] That dwelt within, whose presence had infus'd [...] Into the plant sciential sap, deriv'd [...] From Nectar, drink of Gods. Adam the while [...] Waiting desirous her return, had wove [...] Of choicest Flours a Garland to adorne [...] 840 [...] Her Tresses, and her rural labours crown [...] As Reapers oft are wont thir Harvest Queen. [...] Great joy he promis'd to his thoughts, and new [...] Solace in her return, so long delay'd; [...] Yet oft his heart, divine of somthing ill, [...] Misgave him; hee the faultring measure felt; [...] And forth to meet her went, the way she took [...] That Morn when first they parted; by the Tree [...] Of Knowledge he must pass, there he her met, [...] Scarse from the Tree returning; in her hand [...] 850 [...] A bough of fairest fruit that downie smil'd, [...] New gatherd, and ambrosial smell diffus'd. [...] To him she hasted, in her face excuse [...] Came Prologue, and Apologie to prompt, [...] Which with bland words at will she thus addrest. [...] Hast thou not wonderd, Adam, at my stay? [...] Thee I have misst, and thought it long, depriv'd [...] Thy presence, agonie of love till now [...] Not felt, nor shall be twice, for never more [...] Mean I to trie, what rash untri'd I sought, [...] 860 [...] The paine of absence from thy sight. But strange [...] Hath bin the cause, and wonderful to heare: [...] This Tree is not as we are told, a Tree [...] Of danger tasted, nor to evil unknown [...] Op'ning the way, but of Divine effect [...] To open Eyes, and make them Gods who taste; [...] And hath bin tasted such; the Serpent wise, [...] Or not restraind as wee, or not obeying, [...] Hath eat'n of the fruit, and is become, [...] Not dead, as we are threatn'd, but thenceforth [...] 870 [...] Endu'd with human voice and human sense, [...] Reasoning to admiration, and with mee [...] Perswasively hath so prevaild, that I [...] Have also tasted, and have also found [...] Th' effects to correspond, opener mine Eyes, [...] Dimm erst, dilated Spirits, ampler Heart, [...] And growing up to Godhead; which for thee [...] Chiefly I sought, without thee can despise. [...] For bliss, as thou hast part, to me is bliss, [...] Tedious, unshar'd with thee, and odious soon. [...] 880 [...] Thou therefore also taste, that equal Lot [...] May joyne us, equal Joy, as equal Love; [...] Least thou not tasting, different degree [...] Disjoyne us, and I then too late renounce [...] Deitie for thee, when Fate will not permit. [...] Thus Eve with Countnance blithe her storie told; [...] But in her Cheek distemper flushing glowd. [...] On th' other side, Adam, soon as he heard [...] The fatal Trespass don by Eve, amaz'd, [...] Astonied stood and Blank, while horror chill [...] 890 [...] Ran through his veins, and all his joynts relax'd; [...] From his slack hand the Garland wreath'd for Eve [...] Down drop'd, and all the faded Roses shed: [...] Speechless he stood and pale, till thus at length [...] First to himself he inward silence broke. [...] O fairest of Creation, last and best [...] Of all Gods Works, Creature in whom excell'd [...] Whatever can to fight or thought be found, [...] Holy, divine, good, amiable, or sweet! [...] How art thou lost, how on a sudden lost, [...] 900 [...] Defac't, deflourd, and now to Death devote? [...] Rather how hast thou yeelded to transgress [...] The strict forbiddance, how to violate [...] The sacred Fruit forbidd'n! som cursed fraud [...] Of Enemie hath beguil'd thee, yet unknown, [...] And mee with thee hath ruind, for with thee [...] Certain my resolution is to Die; [...] How can I live without thee, how forgoe [...] Thy sweet Converse and Love so dearly joyn'd, [...] To live again in these wilde Woods forlorn? [...] 910 [...] Should God create another Eve, and I [...] Another Rib afford, yet loss of thee [...] Would never from my heart; no no, I feel [...] The Link of Nature draw me: Flesh of Flesh, [...] Bone of my Bone thou art, and from thy State [...] Mine never shall be parted, bliss or woe. [...] So having said, as one from sad dismay [...] Recomforted, and after thoughts disturbd [...] Submitting to what seemd remediless, [...] Thus in calme mood his Words to Eve he turnd. [...] 920 [...] Bold deed thou hast presum'd, adventrous Eve, [...] And peril great provok't, who thus hast dar'd [...] Had it bin onely coveting to Eye [...] That sacred Fruit, sacred to abstinence, [...] Much more to taste it under banne to touch. [...] But past who can recall, or don undoe? [...] Not God omnipotent, for Fate, yet so [...] Perhaps thou shalt not Die, perhaps the Fact [...] Is not so hainous now, foretasted Fruit, [...] Profan'd first by the Serpent, by him first [...] 930 [...] Made common and unhallowd: ere one tastes; [...] Nor yet on him found deadly; he yet lives, [...] Lives, as thou saidst, and gaines to live as Man [...] Higher degree of Life, inducement strong [...] To us, as likely tasting to attaine [...] Proportional ascent, which cannot be [...] But to be Gods, or Angels Demi-gods. [...] Nor can I think that God, Creator wise, [...] Though threatning, will in earnest so destroy [...] Us his prime Creatures, dignifi'd so high, [...] 940 [...] Set over all his Works, which in our Fall, [...] For us created, needs with us must faile, [...] Dependent made; so God shall uncreate, [...] Be frustrate, do, undo, and labour loose, [...] Not well conceav'd of God, who though his Power [...] Creation could repeate, yet would be loath [...] Us to abolish, least the Adversary [...] Triumph and say; Fickle their State whom God [...] Most Favors, who can please him long? Mee first [...] He ruind, now Mankind; whom will he next? [...] 950 [...] Matter of scorne, not to be given the Foe. [...] However I with thee have fixt my Lot, [...] Certain to undergoe like doom, if Death [...] Consort with thee, Death is to mee as Life; [...] So forcible within my heart I feel [...] The Bond of Nature draw me to my owne, [...] My own in thee, for what thou art is mine; [...] Our State cannot be severd, we are one, [...] One Flesh; to loose thee were to loose my self. [...] So Adam, and thus Eve to him repli'd. [...] 960 [...] O glorious trial of exceeding Love, [...] Illustrious evidence, example high! [...] Ingaging me to emulate, but short [...] Of thy perfection, how shall I attaine, [...] Adam, from whose deare side I boast me sprung, [...] And gladly of our Union heare thee speak, [...] One Heart, one Soul in both; whereof good prooff [...] This day affords, declaring thee resolvd, [...] Rather then Death or aught then Death more dread [...] Shall separate us, linkt in Love so deare, [...] 970 [...] To undergoe with mee one Guilt, one Crime, [...] If any be, of tasting this fair Fruit, [...] Whose vertue, for of good still good proceeds, [...] Direct, or by occasion hath presented [...] This happie trial of thy Love, which else [...] So eminently never had bin known. [...] Were it I thought Death menac't would ensue [...] This my attempt, I would sustain alone [...] The worst, and not perswade thee, rather die [...] Deserted, then oblige thee with a fact [...] 980 [...] Pernicious to thy Peace, chiefly assur'd [...] Remarkably so late of thy so true, [...] So faithful Love unequald; but I feel [...] Farr otherwise th' event, not Death, but Life [...] Augmented, op'nd Eyes, new Hopes, new Joyes, [...] Taste so Divine, that what of sweet before [...] Hath toucht my sense, flat seems to this, and harsh. [...] On my experience, Adam, freely taste, [...] And fear of Death deliver to the Windes. [...] So saying, she embrac'd him, and for joy [...] 990 [...] Tenderly wept, much won that he his Love [...] Had so enobl'd, as of choice to incurr [...] Divine displeasure for her sake, or Death. [...] In recompence (for such compliance bad [...] Such recompence best merits) from the bough [...] She gave him of that fair enticing Fruit [...] With liberal hand: he scrupl'd not to eat [...] Against his better knowledge, not deceav'd, [...] But fondly overcome with <b>Femal</b> charm. [...] Earth trembl'd from her entrails, as again [...] 1000 [...] In pangs, and Nature gave a second groan, [...] Skie lowr'd, and muttering Thunder, som sad drops [...] Wept at compleating of the mortal Sin [...] Original; while Adam took no thought, [...] Eating his fill, nor Eve to iterate [...] Her former trespass fear'd, the more to soothe [...] Him with her lov'd societie, that now [...] As with new Wine intoxicated both [...] They swim in mirth, and fansie that they feel [...] Divinitie within them breeding wings [...] 1010 [...] Wherewith to scorn the Earth: but that false Fruit [...] Farr other operation first displaid, [...] Carnal desire enflaming, hee on Eve [...] Began to cast lascivious Eyes, she him [...] As wantonly repaid; in Lust they burne: [...] Till Adam thus 'gan Eve to dalliance move. [...] Eve, now I see thou art exact of taste, [...] And elegant, of Sapience no small part, [...] Since to each meaning savour we apply, [...] And Palate call judicious; I the praise [...] 1020 [...] Yeild thee, so well this day thou hast purvey'd. [...] Much pleasure we have lost, while we abstain'd [...] From this delightful Fruit, nor known till now [...] True relish, tasting; if such pleasure be [...] In things to us forbidden, it might be wish'd, [...] For this one Tree had bin forbidden ten. [...] But come, so well refresh't, now let us play, [...] As meet is, after such delicious Fare; [...] For never did thy Beautie since the day [...] I saw thee first and wedded thee, adorn'd [...] 1030 [...] With all perfections, so enflame my sense [...] With ardor to enjoy thee, fairer now [...] Then ever, bountie of this vertuous Tree. [...] So said he, and forbore not glance or toy [...] Of amorous intent, well understood [...] Of Eve, whose Eye darted contagious Fire. [...] Her hand he seis'd, and to a shadie bank, [...] Thick overhead with verdant roof imbowr'd [...] He led her nothing loath; Flours were the Couch, [...] Pansies, and Violets, and Asphodel, [...] 1040 [...] And Hyacinth, Earths freshest softest lap. [...] There they thir fill of Love and Loves disport [...] Took largely, of thir mutual guilt the Seale, [...] The solace of thir sin, till dewie sleep [...] Oppress'd them, wearied with thir amorous play. [...] Soon as the force of that fallacious Fruit, [...] That with exhilerating vapour bland [...] About thir spirits had plaid, and inmost powers [...] Made erre, was now exhal'd, and grosser sleep [...] Bred of unkindly fumes, with conscious dreams [...] 1050 [...] Encumberd, now had left them, up they rose [...] As from unrest, and each the other viewing, [...] Soon found thir Eyes how op'nd, and thir minds [...] How dark'nd; innocence, that as a veile [...] Had shadow'd them from knowing ill, was gon, [...] Just confidence, and native righteousness, [...] And honour from about them, naked left [...] To guiltie shame hee cover'd, but his Robe [...] Uncover'd more. So rose the Danite strong [...] Herculean Samson from the Harlot-lap [...] 1060 [...] Of Philistean Dalilah, and wak'd [...] Shorn of his strength, They destitute and bare [...] Of all thir vertue: silent, and in face [...] Confounded long they sate, as struck'n mute, [...] Till Adam, though not less then Eve abasht, [...] At length gave utterance to these words constraind. [...] O Eve, in evil hour thou didst give care [...] To that false Worm, of whomsoever taught [...] To counterfet Mans voice, true in our Fall, [...] False in our promis'd Rising; since our Eyes [...] 1070 [...] Op'nd we find indeed, and find we know [...] Both Good and Evil, Good lost and Evil got, [...] Bad Fruit of Knowledge, if this be to know, [...] Which leaves us naked thus, of Honour void, [...] Of Innocence, of Faith, of Puritie, [...] Our wonted Ornaments now soild and staind, [...] And in our Faces evident the signes [...] Of foul concupiscence; whence evil store; [...] Even shame, the last of evils; of the first [...] Be sure then. How shall I behold the face [...] 1080 [...] Henceforth of God or Angel, earst with joy [...] And rapture so oft beheld? those heav'nly shapes [...] Will dazle now this earthly, with thir blaze [...] Insufferably bright. O might I here [...] In solitude live savage, in some glad [...] Obscur'd, where highest Woods impenetrable [...] To Starr or Sun-light, spread thir umbrage broad, [...] And brown as Evening: Cover me ye Pines, [...] Ye Cedars, with innumerable boughs [...] Hide me, where I may never see them more. [...] 1090 [...] But let us now, as in bad plight, devise [...] What best may for the present serve to hide [...] The Parts of each from other, that seem most [...] To shame obnoxious, and unseemliest seen, [...] Some Tree whose broad smooth Leaves together sowd, [...] And girded on our loyns, may cover round [...] Those middle parts, that this new commer, Shame, [...] There sit not, and reproach us as unclean. [...] So counsel'd hee, and both together went [...] Into the thickest Wood, there soon they chose [...] 1100 [...] The Figtree, not that kind for Fruit renown'd, [...] But such as at this day to Indians known [...] In Malabar or Decan spreds her Armes [...] Braunching so broad and long, that in the ground [...] The bended Twigs take root, and Daughters grow [...] About the Mother Tree, a Pillard shade [...] High overarch't, and echoing Walks between; [...] There oft the Indian Herdsman shunning heate [...] Shelters in coole, and tends his pasturing Herds [...] At Loopholes cut through thickest shade: Those Leaves [...] 1110 [...] They gatherd, broad as Amazonian Targe, [...] And with what skill they had, together sowd, [...] To gird thir waste, vain Covering if to hide [...] Thir guilt and dreaded shame; O how unlike [...] To that first naked Glorie. Such of late [...] Columbus found th' American to girt [...] With featherd Cincture, naked else and wilde [...] Among the Trees on Iles and woodie Shores. [...] Thus fenc't, and as they thought, thir shame in part [...] Coverd, but not at rest or ease of Mind, [...] 1120 [...] They sate them down to weep, nor onely Teares [...] Raind at thir Eyes, but high Winds worse within [...] Began to rise, high Passions, Anger, Hate, [...] Mistrust, Suspicion, Discord, and shook sore [...] Thir inward State of Mind, calme Region once [...] And full of Peace, now tost and turbulent: [...] For Understanding rul'd not, and the Will [...] Heard not her lore, both in subjection now [...] To sensual Appetite, who from beneathe [...] Usurping over sovran Reason claimd [...] 1130 [...] Superior sway: From thus distemperd brest, [...] Adam, estrang'd in look and alterd stile, [...] Speech intermitted thus to Eve renewd. [...] Would thou hadst heark'nd to my words, & stai'd [...] With me, as I besought thee, when that strange [...] Desire of wandring this unhappie Morn, [...] I know not whence possessd thee; we had then [...] Remaind still happie, not as now, despoild [...] Of all our good, sham'd, naked, miserable. [...] Let none henceforth seek needless cause to approve [...] 1140 [...] The Faith they owe; when earnestly they seek [...] Such proof, conclude, they then begin to faile. [...] To whom soon mov'd with touch of blame thus Eve. [...] What words have past thy Lips, Adam severe, [...] Imput'st thou that to my default, or will [...] Of wandering, as thou call'st it, which who knows [...] But might as ill have happ'nd thou being by, [...] Or to thy self perhaps: hadst thou bin there, [...] Or bere th' attempt, thou couldst not have discernd [...] Fraud in the Serpent, speaking as he spake; [...] 1150 [...] No ground of enmitie between us known, [...] Why hee should mean me ill, or seek to harme. [...] Was I to have never parted from thy side? [...] As good have grown there still a liveless Rib. [...] Being as I am, why didst not thou the Head [...] Command me absolutely not to go, [...] Going into such danger as thou saidst? [...] Too facil then thou didst not much gainsay, [...] Nay, didst permit, approve, and fair dismiss. [...] Hadst thou bin firm and fixt in thy dissent, [...] 1160 [...] Neither had I transgress'd, nor thou with mee. [...] To whom then first incenst Adam repli'd. [...] Is this the Love, is the recompence [...] Of mine to thee, ingrateful Eve, exprest [...] Immutable when thou wert lost, not I, [...] Who might have liv'd and joyd immortal bliss, [...] Yet willingly chose rather Death with thee: [...] And am I now upbraided, as the cause [...] Of thy transgressing? not enough severe, [...] It seems, in thy restraint: what could I more? [...] 1170 [...] I warn'd thee, I admonish'd thee, foretold [...] The danger, and the lurking Enemie [...] That lay in wait; beyond this had bin force, [...] And force upon free Will hath here no place. [...] But confidence then bore thee on, secure [...] Either to meet no danger, or to finde [...] Matter of glorious trial; and perhaps [...] I also err'd in overmuch admiring [...] What seemd in thee so perfet, that I thought [...] No evil durst attempt thee, but I rue [...] 1180 [...] That errour now, which is become my crime, [...] And thou th' accuser. Thus it shall befall [...] Him who to worth in Women overtrusting [...] Lets her Will rule; restraint she will not brook, [...] And left to her self, if evil thence ensue, [...] Shee first his weak indulgence will accuse. [...] Thus they in mutual accusation spent [...] The fruitless hours, but neither self-condemning [...] And of thir vain contest appeer'd no end.|$|E

[...] 130 [...] Which else to several Sphears thou must ascribe, [...] Mov'd contrarie with thwart obliquities, [...] Or save the Sun his labour, and that swift [...] Nocturnal and Diurnal rhomb suppos'd, [...] Invisible else above all Starrs, the Wheele [...] Of Day and Night; which needs not thy beleefe, [...] If Earth industrious of her self fetch Day [...] Travelling East, and with her part averse [...] From the Suns beam meet Night, her other part [...] Still luminous by his ray. What if that light [...] 140 [...] Sent from her through the wide transpicuous aire, [...] To the terrestrial Moon be as a Starr [...] Enlightning her by Day, as she by Night [...] This Earth? reciprocal, if Land be there, [...] Feilds and Inhabitants: Her spots thou seest [...] As Clouds, and Clouds may rain, and Rain produce [...] Fruits in her soft'nd Soile, for some to eate [...] Allotted there; and other Suns perhaps [...] With thir attendant Moons thou wilt descrie [...] Communicating Male and <b>Femal</b> Light, [...] 150 [...] Which two great Sexes animate the World, [...] Stor'd in each Orb perhaps with some that live. [...] For such vast room in Nature unpossest [...] By living Soule, desert and desolate, [...] Onely to shine, yet scarce to contribute [...] Each Orb a glimps of Light, conveyd so farr [...] Down to this habitable, which returnes [...] Light back to them, is obvious to dispute. [...] But whether thus these things, or whether not, [...] Whether the Sun predominant in Heav'n [...] 160 [...] Rise on the Earth, or Earth rise on the Sun, [...] Hee from the East his flaming rode begin, [...] Or Shee from West her silent course advance [...] With inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps [...] On her soft Axle, while she paces Eev'n, [...] And bears thee soft with the smooth Air along, [...] Sollicit not thy thoughts with matters hid, [...] Leave them to God above, him serve and feare; [...] Of other Creatures, as him pleases best, [...] Wherever plac't, let him dispose: joy thou [...] 170 [...] In what he gives to thee, this Paradise [...] And thy faire Eve; Heav'n is for thee too high [...] To know what passes there; be lowlie wise: [...] Think onely what concernes thee and thy being; [...] Dream not of other Worlds, what Creatures there [...] Live, in what state, condition or degree, [...] Contented that thus farr hath been reveal'd [...] Not of Earth onely but of highest Heav'n. [...] To whom thus Adam cleerd of doubt, repli'd. [...] How fully hast thou satisfi'd mee, pure [...] 180 [...] Intelligence of Heav'n, Angel serene, [...] And freed from intricacies, taught to live, [...] The easiest way, nor with perplexing thoughts [...] To interrupt the sweet of Life, from which [...] God hath bid dwell farr off all anxious cares, [...] And not molest us, unless we our selves [...] Seek them with wandring thoughts, and notions vaine. [...] But apt the Mind or Fancie is to roave [...] Uncheckt, and of her roaving is no end; [...] Till warn'd, or by experience taught, she learne, [...] 190 [...] That not to know at large of things remote [...] From use, obscure and suttle, but to know [...] That which before us lies in daily life, [...] Is the prime Wisdom, what is more, is fume, [...] Or emptiness, or fond impertinence, [...] And renders us in things that most concerne [...] Unpractis'd, unprepar'd, and still to seek. [...] Therefore from this high pitch let us descend [...] A lower flight, and speak of things at hand [...] Useful, whence haply mention may arise [...] 200 [...] Of somthing not unseasonable to ask [...] By sufferance, and thy wonted favour deign'd. [...] Thee I have heard relating what was don [...] Ere my remembrance: now hear mee relate [...] My Storie, which perhaps thou hast not heard; [...] And Day is yet not spent; till then thou seest [...] How suttly to detaine thee I devise, [...] Inviting thee to hear while I relate, [...] Fond, were it not in hope of thy reply: [...] For while I sit with thee, I seem in Heav'n, [...] 210 [...] And sweeter thy discourse is to my eare [...] Then Fruits of Palm-tree pleasantest to thirst [...] And hunger both, from labour, at the houre [...] Of sweet repast; they satiate, and soon fill, [...] Though pleasant, but thy words with Grace Divine [...] Imbu'd, bring to thir sweetness no satietie. [...] To whom thus Raphael answer'd heav'nly meek. [...] Nor are thy lips ungraceful, Sire of men, [...] Nor tongue ineloquent; for God on thee [...] Abundantly his gifts hath also pour'd, [...] 220 [...] Inward and outward both, his image faire: [...] Speaking or mute all comliness and grace [...] Attends thee, and each word, each motion formes. [...] Nor less think wee in Heav'n of thee on Earth [...] Then of our fellow servant, and inquire [...] Gladly into the wayes of God with Man: [...] For God we see hath honour'd thee, and set [...] On Man his equal Love: say therefore on; [...] For I that Day was absent, as befell, [...] Bound on a voyage uncouth and obscure, [...] 230 [...] Farr on excursion toward the Gates of Hell; [...] Squar'd in full Legion (such command we had) [...] To see that none thence issu'd forth a spie, [...] Or enemie, while God was in his work, [...] Least hee incenst at such eruption bold, [...] Destruction with Creation might have mixt. [...] Not that they durst without his leave attempt, [...] But us he sends upon his high behests [...] For state, as Sovran King, and to enure [...] Our prompt obedience. Fast we found, fast shut [...] 240 [...] The dismal Gates, and barricado'd strong; [...] But long ere our approaching heard within [...] Noise, other then the sound of Dance or Song, [...] Torment, and lowd lament, and furious rage. [...] Glad we return'd up to the coasts of Light [...] Ere Sabbath Eev'ning: so we had in charge. [...] But thy relation now; for I attend, [...] Pleas'd with thy words no less then thou with mine. [...] So spake the Godlike Power, and thus our Sire. [...] For Man to tell how human Life began [...] 250 [...] Is hard; for who himself beginning knew? [...] Desire with thee still longer to converse [...] Induc'd me. As new wak't from soundest sleep [...] Soft on the flourie herb I found me laid [...] In Balmie Sweat, which with his Beames the Sun [...] Soon dri'd, and on the reaking moisture fed. [...] Strait toward Heav'n my wondring Eyes I turnd, [...] And gaz'd a while the ample Skie, till rais'd [...] By quick instinctive motion up I sprung, [...] As thitherward endevoring, and upright [...] 260 [...] Stood on my feet; about me round I saw [...] Hill, Dale, and shadie Woods, and sunnie Plaines, [...] And liquid Lapse of murmuring Streams; by these, [...] Creatures that livd, and movd, and walk'd, or flew, [...] Birds on the branches warbling; all things smil'd, [...] With fragrance and with joy my heart oreflow'd. [...] My self I then perus'd, and Limb by Limb [...] Survey'd, and sometimes went, and sometimes ran [...] With supple joints, as lively vigour led: [...] But who I was, or where, or from what cause, [...] 270 [...] Knew not; to speak I tri'd, and forthwith spake, [...] My Tongue obey'd and readily could name [...] What e're I saw. Thou Sun, said I, faire Light, [...] And thou enlight'nd Earth, so fresh and gay, [...] Ye Hills and Dales, ye Rivers, Woods, and Plaines, [...] And ye that live and move, fair Creatures, tell, [...] Tell, if ye saw, how came I thus, how here? [...] Not of my self; by some great Maker then, [...] In goodness and in power praeeminent; [...] Tell me, how may I know him, how adore, [...] 280 [...] From whom I have that thus I move and live, [...] And feel that I am happier then I know. [...] While thus I call'd, and stray'd I knew not whither, [...] From where I first drew Aire, and first beheld [...] This happie Light, when answer none return'd, [...] On a green shadie Bank profuse of Flours [...] Pensive I sate me down; there gentle sleep [...] First found me, and with soft oppression seis'd [...] My droused sense, untroubl'd, though I thought [...] I then was passing to my former state [...] 290 [...] Insensible, and forthwith to dissolve: [...] When suddenly stood at my Head a dream, [...] Whose inward apparition gently mov'd [...] My Fancy to believe I yet had being, [...] And livd: One came, methought, of shape Divine, [...] And said, thy Mansion wants thee, Adam, rise, [...] First Man, of Men innumerable ordain'd [...] First Father, call'd by thee I come thy Guide [...] To the Garden of bliss, thy seat prepar'd. [...] So saying, by the hand he took me rais'd, [...] 300 [...] And over Fields and Waters, as in Aire [...] Smooth sliding without step, last led me up [...] A woodie Mountain; whose high top was plaine, [...] A Circuit wide, enclos'd, with goodliest Trees [...] Planted, with Walks, and Bowers, that what I saw [...] Of Earth before scarse pleasant seemd. Each Tree [...] Load'n with fairest Fruit, that hung to the Eye [...] Tempting, stirr'd in me sudden appetite [...] To pluck and eate; whereat I wak'd, and found [...] Before mine Eyes all real, as the dream [...] 310 [...] Had lively shadowd: Here had new begun [...] My wandring, had not hee who was my Guide [...] Up hither, from among the Trees appeer'd, [...] Presence Divine. Rejoycing, but with aw [...] In adoration at his feet I fell [...] Submiss: he rear'd me, & Whom thou soughtst I am, [...] Said mildely, Author of all this thou seest [...] Above, or round about thee or beneath. [...] This Paradise I give thee, count it thine [...] To Till and keep, and of the Fruit to eate: [...] 320 [...] Of every Tree that in the Garden growes [...] Eate freely with glad heart; fear here no dearth: [...] But of the Tree whose operation brings [...] Knowledg of good and ill, which I have set [...] The Pledge of thy Obedience and thy Faith, [...] Amid the Garden by the Tree of Life, [...] Remember what I warne thee, shun to taste, [...] And shun the bitter consequence: for know, [...] The day thou eat'st thereof, my sole command [...] Transgrest, inevitably thou shalt dye; [...] 330 [...] From that day mortal, and this happie State [...] Shalt loose, expell'd from hence into a World [...] Of woe and sorrow. Sternly he pronounc'd [...] The rigid interdiction, which resounds [...] Yet dreadful in mine eare, though in my choice [...] Not to incur; but soon his cleer aspect [...] Return'd and gratious purpose thus renew'd. [...] Not onely these fair bounds, but all the Earth [...] To thee and to thy Race I give; as Lords [...] Possess it, and all things that therein live, [...] 340 [...] Or live in Sea, or Aire, Beast, Fish, and Fowle. [...] In signe whereof each Bird and Beast behold [...] After thir kindes; I bring them to receave [...] From thee thir Names, and pay thee fealtie [...] With low subjection; understand the same [...] Of Fish within thir watry residence, [...] Not hither summond, since they cannot change [...] Thir Element to draw the thinner Aire. [...] As thus he spake, each Bird and Beast behold [...] Approaching two and two, These cowring low [...] 350 [...] With blandishment, each Bird stoop'd on his wing. [...] I nam'd them, as they pass'd, and understood [...] Thir Nature, with such knowledg God endu'd [...] My sudden apprehension: but in these [...] I found not what me thought I wanted still; [...] And to the Heav'nly vision thus presum'd. [...] O by what Name, for thou above all these, [...] Above mankinde, or aught then mankinde higher, [...] Surpassest farr my naming, how may I [...] Adore thee, Author of this Universe, [...] 360 [...] And all this good to man, for whose well being [...] So amply, and with hands so liberal [...] Thou hast provided all things: but with mee [...] I see not who partakes. In solitude [...] What happiness, who can enjoy alone, [...] Or all enjoying, what contentment find? [...] Thus I presumptuous; and the vision bright, [...] As with a smile more bright'nd, thus repli'd. [...] What call'st thou solitude, is not the Earth [...] With various living creatures, and the Aire [...] 370 [...] Replenisht, and all these at thy command [...] To come and play before thee, know'st thou not [...] Thir language and thir wayes, they also know, [...] And reason not contemptibly; with these [...] Find pastime, and beare rule; thy Realm is large. [...] So spake the Universal Lord, and seem'd [...] So ordering. I with leave of speech implor'd, [...] And humble deprecation thus repli'd. [...] Let not my words offend thee, Heav'nly Power, [...] My Maker, be propitious while I speak. [...] 380 [...] Hast thou not made me here thy substitute, [...] And these inferiour farr beneath me set? [...] Among unequals what societie [...] Can sort, what harmonie or true delight? [...] Which must be mutual, in proportion due [...] Giv'n and receiv'd; but in disparitie [...] The one intense, the other still remiss [...] Cannot well suite with either, but soon prove [...] Tedious alike: Of fellowship I speak [...] Such as I seek, fit to participate [...] 390 [...] All rational delight, wherein the brute [...] Cannot be human consort; they rejoyce [...] Each with thir kinde, Lion with Lioness; [...] So fitly them in pairs thou hast combin'd; [...] Much less can Bird with Beast, or Fish with Fowle [...] So well converse, nor with the Ox the Ape; [...] Wors then can Man with Beast, and least of all. [...] Whereto th' Almighty answer'd, not displeas'd. [...] A nice and suttle happiness I see [...] Thou to thy self proposest, in the choice [...] 400 [...] Of thy Associates, Adam, and wilt taste [...] No pleasure, though in pleasure, solitarie. [...] What thinkst thou then of mee, and this my State, [...] Seem I to thee sufficiently possest [...] Of happiness, or not? who am alone [...] From all Eternitie, for none I know [...] Second to mee or like, equal much less. [...] How have I then with whom to hold converse [...] Save with the Creatures which I made, and those [...] To me inferiour, infinite descents [...] 410 [...] Beneath what other Creatures are to thee? [...] He ceas'd, I lowly answer'd. To attaine [...] The highth and depth of thy Eternal wayes [...] All human thoughts come short, Supream of things; [...] Thou in thy self art perfet, and in thee [...] Is no deficience found; not so is Man, [...] But in degree, the cause of his desire [...] By conversation with his like to help, [...] Or solace his defects. No need that thou [...] Shouldst propagat, already infinite; [...] 420 [...] And through all numbers absolute, though One; [...] But Man by number is to manifest [...] His single imperfection, and beget [...] Like of his like, his Image multipli'd, [...] In unitie defective, which requires [...] Collateral love, and deerest amitie. [...] Thou in thy secresie although alone, [...] Best with thy self accompanied, seek'st not [...] Social communication, yet so pleas'd, [...] Canst raise thy Creature to what highth thou wilt [...] 430 [...] Of Union or Communion, deifi'd; [...] I by conversing cannot these erect [...] From prone, nor in thir wayes complacence find. [...] Thus I embold'nd spake, and freedom us'd [...] Permissive, and acceptance found, which gain'd [...] This answer from the gratious voice Divine. [...] Thus farr to try thee, Adam, I was pleas'd, [...] And finde thee knowing not of Beasts alone, [...] Which thou hast rightly nam'd, but of thy self, [...] Expressing well the spirit within thee free, [...] 440 [...] My Image, not imparted to the Brute, [...] Whose fellowship therefore unmeet for thee [...] Good reason was thou freely shouldst dislike, [...] And be so minded still; I, ere thou spak'st, [...] Knew it not good for Man to be alone, [...] And no such companie as then thou saw'st [...] Intended thee, for trial onely brought, [...] To see how thou could'st judge of fit and meet: [...] What next I bring shall please thee, be assur'd, [...] Thy likeness, thy fit help, thy other self, [...] 450 [...] Thy wish, exactly to thy hearts desire. [...] Hee ended, or I heard no more, for now [...] My earthly by his Heav'nly overpowerd, [...] Which it had long stood under, streind to the highth [...] In that celestial Colloquie sublime, [...] As with an object that excels the sense, [...] Dazl'd and spent, sunk down, and sought repair [...] Of sleep, which instantly fell on me, call'd [...] By Nature as in aide, and clos'd mine eyes. [...] Mine eyes he clos'd, but op'n left the Cell [...] 460 [...] Of Fancie my internal sight, by which [...] Abstract as in a transe methought I saw, [...] Though sleeping, where I lay, and saw the shape [...] Still glorious before whom awake I stood; [...] Who stooping op'nd my left side, and took [...] From thence a Rib, with cordial spirits warme, [...] And Life-blood streaming fresh; wide was the wound, [...] But suddenly with flesh fill'd up & heal'd: [...] The Rib he formd and fashond with his hands; [...] Under his forming hands a Creature grew, [...] 470 [...] Manlike, but different sex, so lovly faire, [...] That what seemd fair in all the World, seemd now [...] Mean, or in her summd up, in her containd [...] And in her looks, which from that time infus'd [...] Sweetness into my heart, unfelt before, [...] And into all things from her Aire inspir'd [...] The spirit of love and amorous delight. [...] She disappeerd, and left me dark, I wak'd [...] To find her, or for ever to deplore [...] Her loss, and other pleasures all abjure: [...] 480 [...] When out of hope, behold her, not farr off, [...] Such as I saw her in my dream, adornd [...] With what all Earth or Heaven could bestow [...] To make her amiable: On she came, [...] Led by her Heav'nly Maker, though unseen, [...] And guided by his voice, nor uninformd [...] Of nuptial Sanctitie and marriage Rites: [...] Grace was in all her steps, Heav'n in her Eye, [...] In every gesture dignitie and love. [...] I overjoyd could not forbear aloud. [...] 490 [...] This turn hath made amends; thou hast fulfill'd [...] Thy words, Creator bounteous and benigne, [...] Giver of all things faire, but fairest this [...] Of all thy gifts, nor enviest. I now see [...] Bone of my Bone, Flesh of my Flesh, my Self [...] Before me; Woman is her Name, of Man [...] Extracted; for this cause he shall forgoe [...] Father and Mother, and to his Wife adhere; [...] And they shall be one Flesh, one Heart, one Soule. [...] She heard me thus, and though divinely brought, [...] 500 [...] Yet Innocence and Virgin Modestie, [...] Her vertue and the conscience of her worth, [...] That would be woo'd, and not unsought be won, [...] Not obvious, not obtrusive, but retir'd, [...] The more desirable, or to say all, [...] Nature her self, though pure of sinful thought, [...] Wrought in her so, that seeing me, she turn'd; [...] I follow'd her, she what was Honour knew, [...] And with obsequious Majestie approv'd [...] My pleaded reason. To the Nuptial Bowre [...] 510 [...] I led her blushing like the Morn: all Heav'n, [...] And happie Constellations on that houre [...] Shed thir selectest influence; the Earth [...] Gave sign of gratulation, and each Hill; [...] Joyous the Birds; fresh Gales and gentle Aires [...] Whisper'd it to the Woods, and from thir wings [...] Flung Rose, flung Odours from the spicie Shrub, [...] Disporting, till the amorous Bird of Night [...] Sung Spousal, and bid haste the Eevning Starr [...] On his Hill top, to light the bridal Lamp. [...] 520 [...] Thus I have told thee all my State, and brought [...] My Storie to the sum of earthly bliss [...] Which I enjoy, and must confess to find [...] In all things else delight indeed, but such [...] As us'd or not, works in the mind no change, [...] Nor vehement desire, these delicacies [...] I mean of Taste, Sight, Smell, Herbs, Fruits, & Flours, [...] Walks, and the melodie of Birds; but here [...] Farr otherwise, transported I behold, [...] Transported touch; here passion first I felt, [...] 530 [...] Commotion strange, in all enjoyments else [...] Superiour and unmov'd, here onely weake [...] Against the charm of Beauties powerful glance. [...] Or Nature faild in mee, and left some part [...] Not proof enough such Object to sustain, [...] Or from my side subducting, took perhaps [...] More then enough; at least on her bestow'd [...] Too much of Ornament, in outward shew [...] Elaborate, of inward less exact. [...] For well I understand in the prime end [...] 540 [...] Of Nature her th' inferiour, in the mind [...] And inward Faculties, which most excell, [...] In outward also her resembling less [...] His Image who made both, and less expressing [...] The character of that Dominion giv'n [...] O're other Creatures; yet when I approach [...] Her loveliness, so absolute she seems [...] And in her self compleat, so well to know [...] Her own, that what she wills to do or say, [...] Seems wisest, vertuousest, discreetest, best; [...] 550 [...] All higher knowledge in her presence falls [...] Degraded, Wisdom in discourse with her [...] Looses discount'nanc't, and like folly shewes; [...] Authoritie and Reason on her waite, [...] As one intended first, not after made [...] Occasionally; and to consummate all, [...] Greatness of mind and nobleness thir seat [...] Build in her loveliest, and create an awe [...] About her, as a guard Angelic plac't. [...] To whom the Angel with contracted brow. [...] 560 [...] Accuse not Nature, she hath don her part; [...] Do thou but thine, and be not diffident [...] Of Wisdom, she deserts thee not, if thou [...] Dismiss not her, when most thou needst her nigh, [...] By attributing overmuch to things [...] Less excellent, as thou thy self perceav'st. [...] For what admir'st thou, what transports thee so, [...] An outside? fair no doubt, and worthy well [...] Thy cherishing, thy honouring, and thy love, [...] Not thy subjection: weigh with her thy self; [...] 570 [...] Then value: Oft times nothing profits more [...] Then self-esteem, grounded on just and right [...] Well manag'd; of that skill the more thou know'st, [...] The more she will acknowledge thee her Head, [...] And to realities yeild all her shows; [...] Made so adorn for thy delight the more, [...] So awful, that with honour thou maist love [...] Thy mate, who sees when thou art seen least wise. [...] But if the sense of touch whereby mankind [...] Is propagated seem such dear delight [...] 580 [...] Beyond all other, think the same voutsaf't [...] To Cattel and each Beast; which would not be [...] To them made common & divulg'd, if aught [...] Therein enjoy'd were worthy to subdue [...] The Soule of Man, or passion in him move. [...] What higher in her societie thou findst [...] Attractive, human, rational, love still; [...] In loving thou dost well, in passion not, [...] Wherein true Love consists not; love refines [...] The thoughts, and heart enlarges, hath his seat [...] 590 [...] In Reason, and is judicious, is the scale [...] By which to heav'nly Love thou maist ascend, [...] Not sunk in carnal pleasure, for which cause [...] Among the Beasts no Mate for thee was found. [...] To whom thus half abash't Adam repli'd. [...] Neither her out-side formd so fair, nor aught [...] In procreation common to all kindes [...] (Though higher of the genial Bed by far, [...] And with mysterious reverence I deem) [...] So much delights me, as those graceful acts, [...] 600 [...] Those thousand decencies that daily flow [...] From all her words and actions, mixt with Love [...] And sweet compliance, which declare unfeign'd [...] Union of Mind, or in us both one Soule; [...] Harmonie to behold in wedded pair [...] More grateful then harmonious sound to the eare. [...] Yet these subject not; I to thee disclose [...] What inward thence I feel, not therefore foild, [...] Who meet with various objects, from the sense [...] Variously representing; yet still free [...] 610 [...] Approve the best, and follow what I approve. [...] To love thou blam'st me not, for love thou saist [...] Leads up to Heav'n, is both the way and guide; [...] Bear with me then, if lawful what I ask; [...] Love not the heav'nly Spirits, and how thir Love [...] Express they, by looks onely, or do they mix [...] Irradiance, virtual or immediate touch? [...] To whom the Angel with a smile that glow'd [...] Celestial rosie red, Loves proper hue, [...] Answer'd. Let it suffice thee that thou know'st [...] 620 [...] Us happie, and without Love no happiness. [...] Whatever pure thou in the body enjoy'st [...] (And pure thou wert created) we enjoy [...] In eminence, and obstacle find none [...] Of membrane, joynt, or limb, exclusive barrs: [...] Easier then Air with Air, if Spirits embrace, [...] Total they mix, Union of Pure with Pure [...] Desiring; nor restrain'd conveyance need [...] As Flesh to mix with Flesh, or Soul with Soul. [...] But I can now no more; the parting Sun [...] 630 [...] Beyond the Earths green Cape and verdant Isles [...] Hesperean sets, my Signal to depart. [...] Be strong, live happie, and love, but first of all [...] Him whom to love is to obey, and keep [...] His great command; take heed least Passion sway [...] Thy Judgement to do aught, which else free Will [...] Would not admit; thine and of all thy Sons [...] The weal or woe in thee is plac't; beware. [...] I in thy persevering shall rejoyce, [...] And all the Blest: stand fast; to stand or fall [...] 640 [...] Free in thine own Arbitrement it lies. [...] Perfet within, no outward aid require; [...] And all temptation to transgress repel. [...] So saying, he arose; whom Adam thus [...] Follow'd with benediction. Since to part, [...] Go heavenly Guest, Ethereal Messenger, [...] Sent from whose sovran goodness I adore. [...] Gentle to me and affable hath been [...] Thy condescension, and shall be honour'd ever [...] With grateful Memorie: thou to mankind [...] 650 [...] Be good and friendly still, and oft return.

[...] 140 [...] Eve, easily may Faith admit, that all [...] The good which we enjoy, from Heav'n descends [...] But that from us ought should ascend to Heav'n [...] So prevalent as to concerne the mind [...] Of God high blest, or to incline his will, [...] Hard to belief may seem; yet this will Prayer, [...] Or one short sigh of humane breath, up-borne [...] Ev'n to the Seat of God. For since I saught [...] By Prayer th' offended Deitie to appease, [...] Kneel'd and before him humbl'd all my heart, [...] 150 [...] Methought I saw him placable and mild, [...] Bending his eare; perswasion in me grew [...] That I was heard with favour; peace returnd [...] Home to my brest, and to my memorie [...] His promise, that thy Seed shall bruise our Foe; [...] Which then not minded in dismay, yet now [...] Assures me that the bitterness of death [...] Is past, and we shall live. Whence Haile to thee, [...] Eve rightly call'd, Mother of all Mankind, [...] Mother of all things living, since by thee [...] 160 [...] Man is to live, and all things live for Man. [...] To whom thus Eve with sad demeanour meek. [...] Ill worthie I such title should belong [...] To me transgressour, who for thee ordaind [...] A help, became thy snare; to mee reproach [...] Rather belongs, distrust and all dispraise: [...] But infinite in pardon was my Judge, [...] That I who first brought Death on all, am grac't [...] The sourse of life; next favourable thou, [...] Who highly thus to entitle me voutsaf't, [...] 170 [...] Farr other name deserving. But the Field [...] To labour calls us now with sweat impos'd, [...] Though after sleepless Night; for see the Morn, [...] All unconcern'd with our unrest, begins [...] Her rosie progress smiling; let us forth, [...] I never from thy side henceforth to stray, [...] Wherere our days work lies, though now enjoind [...] Laborious, till day droop; while here we dwell, [...] What can be toilsom in these pleasant Walkes? [...] Here let us live, though in fall'n state, content. [...] 180 [...] So spake, so wish'd much-humbl'd Eve, but Fate [...] Subscrib'd not; Nature first gave Signs, imprest [...] On Bird, Beast, Aire, Aire suddenly eclips'd [...] After short blush of Morn; nigh in her sight [...] The Bird of Jove, stoopt from his aerie tour, [...] Two Birds of gayest plume before him drove: [...] Down from a Hill the Beast that reigns in Woods, [...] First Hunter then, pursu'd a gentle brace, [...] Goodliest of all the Forrest, Hart and Hinde; [...] Direct to th' Eastern Gate was bent thir flight. [...] 190 [...] Adam observ'd, and with his Eye the chase [...] Pursuing, not unmov'd to Eve thus spake. [...] O Eve, some furder change awaits us nigh, [...] Which Heav'n by these mute signs in Nature shews [...] Forerunners of his purpose, or to warn [...] Us haply too secure of our discharge [...] From penaltie, because from death releast [...] Some days; how long, and what till then our life, [...] Who knows, or more then this, that we are dust, [...] And thither must return and be no more. [...] 200 [...] Why else this double object in our sight [...] Of flight pursu'd in th' Air and ore the ground [...] One way the self-same hour? why in the East [...] Darkness ere Dayes mid-course, and Morning light [...] More orient in yon Western Cloud that draws [...] O're the blew Firmament a radiant white, [...] And slow descends, with somthing heav'nly fraught. [...] He err'd not, for by this the heav'nly Bands [...] Down from a Skie of Jasper lighted now [...] In Paradise, and on a Hill made alt, [...] 210 [...] A glorious Apparition, had not doubt [...] And carnal fear that day dimm'd Adams eye. [...] Not that more glorious, when the Angels met [...] Jacob in Mahanaim, where he saw [...] The field Pavilion'd with his Guardians bright; [...] Nor that which on the flaming Mount appeerd [...] In Dothan, cover'd with a Camp of Fire, [...] Against the Syrian King, who to surprize [...] One man, Assassin-like had levied Warr, [...] Warr unproclam'd. The Princely Hierarch [...] 220 [...] In thir bright stand, there left his Powers to seise [...] Possession of the Garden; hee alone, [...] To finde where Adam shelterd, took his way, [...] Not unperceav'd of Adam, who to Eve, [...] While the great Visitant approachd, thus spake. [...] Eve, now expect great tidings, which perhaps [...] Of us will soon determin, or impose [...] New Laws to be observ'd; for I descrie [...] From yonder blazing Cloud that veils the Hill [...] One of the heav'nly Host, and by his Gate [...] 230 [...] None of the meanest, some great Potentate [...] Or of the Thrones above, such Majestie [...] Invests him coming; yet not terrible, [...] That I should fear, nor sociably mild, [...] As Raphael, that I should much confide, [...] But solemn and sublime, whom not to offend, [...] With reverence I must meet, and thou retire. [...] He ended; and th' Arch-Angel soon drew nigh, [...] Not in his shape Celestial, but as Man [...] Clad to meet Man; over his lucid Armes [...] 240 [...] A militarie Vest of purple flowd [...] Livelier then Meliboean, or the graine [...] Of Sarra, worn by Kings and Hero's old [...] In time of Truce; Iris had dipt the wooff; [...] His starrie Helme unbuckl'd shew'd him prime [...] In Manhood where Youth ended; by his side [...] As in a glistering Zodiac hung the Sword, [...] Satans dire dread, and in his hand the Spear. [...] Adam bowd low, hee Kingly from his State [...] Inclin'd not, but his coming thus declar'd. [...] 250 [...] Adam, Heav'ns high behest no Preface needs: [...] Sufficient that thy Prayers are heard, and Death, [...] Then due by sentence when thou didst transgress, [...] Defeated of his seisure many dayes [...] Giv'n thee of Grace, wherein thou may'st repent, [...] And one bad act with many deeds well done [...] Mayst cover: well may then thy Lord appeas'd [...] Redeem thee quite from Deaths rapacious claimes; [...] But longer in this Paradise to dwell [...] Permits not; to remove thee I am come, [...] 260 [...] And send thee from the Garden forth to till [...] The ground whence thou wast tak'n, fitter Soile. [...] He added not, for Adam at the newes [...] Heart-strook with chilling gripe of sorrow stood, [...] That all his senses bound; Eve, who unseen [...] Yet all had heard, with audible lament [...] Discover'd soon the place of her retire. [...] O unexpected stroke, worse then of Death! [...] Must I thus leave thee Paradise? thus leave [...] Thee Native Soile, these happie Walks and Shades, [...] 270 [...] Fit haunt of Gods? where I had hope to spend, [...] Quiet though sad, the respit of that day [...] That must be mortal to us both. O flours, [...] That never will in other Climate grow, [...] My early visitation, and my last [...] At Eev'n, which I bred up with tender hand [...] From the first op'ning bud, and gave ye Names, [...] Who now shall reare ye to the Sun, or ranke [...] Your Tribes, and water from th' ambrosial Fount? [...] Thee lastly nuptial Bowre, by mee adornd [...] 280 [...] With what to sight or smell was sweet; from thee [...] How shall I part, and whither wander down [...] Into a lower World, to this obscure [...] And wilde, how shall we breath in other Aire [...] Less pure, accustomd to immortal Fruits? [...] Whom thus the Angel interrupted milde. [...] Lament not Eve, but patiently resigne [...] What justly thou hast lost; nor set thy heart, [...] Thus over fond, on that which is not thine; [...] Thy going is not lonely, with thee goes [...] 290 [...] Thy Husband, him to follow thou art bound; [...] Where he abides, think there thy native soile. [...] Adam by this from the cold sudden damp [...] Recovering, and his scatterd spirits returnd, [...] To Michael thus his humble words addressd. [...] Celestial, whether among the Thrones, or nam'd [...] Of them the Highest, for such of shape may seem [...] Prince above Princes, gently hast thou tould [...] Thy message, which might else in telling wound, [...] And in performing end us; what besides [...] 300 [...] Of sorrow and dejection and despair [...] Our frailtie can sustain, thy tidings bring, [...] Departure from this happy place, our sweet [...] Recess, and onely consolation left [...] Familiar to our eyes, all places else [...] Inhospitable appeer and desolate, [...] Nor knowing us nor known: and if by prayer [...] Incessant I could hope to change the will [...] Of him who all things can, I would not cease [...] To wearie him with my assiduous cries: [...] 310 [...] But prayer against his absolute Decree [...] No more availes then breath against the winde, [...] Blown stifling back on him that breaths it forth: [...] Therefore to his great bidding I submit. [...] This most afflicts me, that departing hence, [...] As from his face I shall be hid, deprivd [...] His blessed count'nance; here I could frequent, [...] With worship, place by place where he voutsaf'd [...] Presence Divine, and to my Sons relate; [...] On this Mount he appeerd, under this Tree [...] 320 [...] Stood visible, among these Pines his voice [...] I heard, here with him at this Fountain talk'd: [...] So many grateful Altars I would reare [...] Of grassie Terfe, and pile up every Stone [...] Of lustre from the brook, in memorie, [...] Or monument to Ages, and thereon [...] Offer sweet smelling Gumms & Fruits and Flours: [...] In yonder nether World where shall I seek [...] His bright appearances, or footstep trace? [...] For though I fled him angrie, yet recall'd [...] 330 [...] To life prolongd and promisd Race, I now [...] Gladly behold though but his utmost skirts [...] Of glory, and farr off his steps adore. [...] To whom thus Michael with regard benigne. [...] Adam, thou know'st Heav'n his, and all the Earth [...] Not this Rock onely; his Omnipresence fills [...] Land, Sea, and Aire, and every kinde that lives, [...] Fomented by his virtual power and warmd: [...] All th' Earth he gave thee to possess and rule, [...] No despicable gift; surmise not then [...] 340 [...] His presence to these narrow bounds confin'd [...] Of Paradise or Eden: this had been [...] Perhaps thy Capital Seate, from whence had spred [...] All generations, and had hither come [...] From all the ends of th' Earth, to celebrate [...] And reverence thee thir great Progenitor. [...] But this praeeminence thou hast lost, brought down [...] To dwell on eeven ground now with thy Sons: [...] Yet doubt not but in Vallie and in Plaine [...] God is as here, and will be found alike [...] 350 [...] Present, and of his presence many a signe [...] Still following thee, still compassing thee round [...] With goodness and paternal Love, his Face [...] Express, and of his steps the track Divine. [...] Which that thou mayst beleeve, and be confirmd, [...] Ere thou from hence depart, know I am sent [...] To shew thee what shall come in future dayes [...] To thee and to thy Ofspring; good with bad [...] Expect to hear, supernal Grace contending [...] With sinfulness of Men; thereby to learn [...] 360 [...] True patience, and to temper joy with fear [...] And pious sorrow, equally enur'd [...] By moderation either state to beare, [...] Prosperous or adverse: so shalt thou lead [...] Safest thy life, and best prepar'd endure [...] Thy mortal passage when it comes. Ascend [...] This Hill; let Eve (for I have drencht her eyes) [...] Here sleep below while thou to foresight wak'st, [...] As once thou slepst, while Shee to life was formd. [...] To whom thus Adam gratefully repli'd. [...] 370 [...] Ascend, I follow thee, safe Guide, the path [...] Thou lead'st me, and to the hand of Heav'n submit, [...] However chast'ning, to the evil turne [...] My obvious breast, arming to overcom [...] By suffering, and earne rest from labour won, [...] If so I may attain. So both ascend [...] In the Visions of God: It was a Hill [...] Of Paradise the highest, from whose top [...] The Hemisphere of Earth in cleerest Ken [...] Stretcht out to amplest reach of prospect lay. [...] 380 [...] Not higher that Hill nor wider looking round, [...] Whereon for different cause the Tempter set [...] Our second Adam in the Wilderness, [...] To shew him all Earths Kingdomes and thir Glory. [...] His Eye might there command wherever stood [...] City of old or modern Fame, the Seat [...] Of mightiest Empire, from the destind Walls [...] Of Cambalu, seat of Cathaian Can [...] And Samarchand by Oxus, Temirs Throne, [...] To Paquin of Sinaean Kings, and thence [...] 390 [...] To Agra and Lahor of great Mogul [...] Down to the golden Chersonese, or where [...] The Persian in Ecbatan sate, or since [...] In Hispahan, or where the Russian Ksar [...] In Mosco, or the Sultan in Bizance, [...] Turchestan-born; nor could his eye not ken [...] Th' Empire of Negus to his utmost Port [...] Ercoco and the less Maritine Kings [...] Mombaza, and Quiloa, and Melind, [...] And Sofala thought Ophir, to the Realme [...] 400 [...] Of Congo, and Angola fardest South; [...] Or thence from Niger Flood to Atlas Mount [...] The Kingdoms of Almansor, Fez, and Sus, [...] Marocco and Algiers, and Tremisen; [...] On Europe thence, and where Rome was to sway [...] The World: in Spirit perhaps he also saw [...] Rich Mexico the seat of Motezume, [...] And Cusco in Peru, the richer seat [...] Of Atabalipa, and yet unspoil'd [...] Guiana, whose great Citie Geryons Sons [...] 410 [...] Call El Dorado: but to nobler sights [...] Michael from Adams eyes the Filme remov'd [...] Which that false Fruit that promis'd clearer sight [...] Had bred; then purg'd with Euphrasie and Rue [...] The visual Nerve, for he had much to see; [...] And from the Well of Life three drops instill'd. [...] So deep the power of these Ingredients pierc'd, [...] Eevn to the inmost seat of mental sight, [...] That Adam now enforc't to close his eyes, [...] Sunk down and all his Spirits became intranst: [...] 420 [...] But him the gentle Angel by the hand [...] Soon rais'd, and his attention thus recall'd. [...] Adam, now ope thine eyes, and first behold [...] Th' effects which thy original crime hath wrought [...] In some to spring from thee, who never touch'd [...] Th' excepted Tree, nor with the Snake conspir'd, [...] Nor sinn'd thy sin, yet from that sin derive [...] Corruption to bring forth more violent deeds. [...] His eyes he op'nd, and beheld a field, [...] Part arable and tilth, whereon were Sheaves [...] 430 [...] New reapt, the other part sheep-walks and foulds; [...] Ith' midst an Altar as the Land-mark stood [...] Rustic, of grassie sord; thither anon [...] A sweatie Reaper from his Tillage brought [...] First Fruits, the green Eare, and the yellow Sheaf, [...] Uncull'd, as came to hand; a Shepherd next [...] More meek came with the Firstlings of his Flock [...] Choicest and best; then sacrificing, laid [...] The Inwards and thir Fat, with Incense strew'd, [...] On the cleft Wood, and all due Rites perform'd. [...] 440 [...] His Offring soon propitious Fire from Heav'n [...] Consum'd with nimble glance, and grateful steame; [...] The others not, for his was not sincere; [...] Whereat hee inlie rag'd, and as they talk'd, [...] Smote him into the Midriff with a stone [...] That beat out life; he fell, and deadly pale [...] Groand out his Soul with gushing bloud effus'd. [...] Much at that sight was Adam in his heart [...] Dismai'd, and thus in haste to th' Angel cri'd. [...] O Teacher, some great mischief hath befall'n [...] 450 [...] To that meek man, who well had sacrific'd; [...] Is Pietie thus and pure Devotion paid? [...] T' whom Michael thus, hee also mov'd, repli'd. [...] These two are Brethren, Adam, and to come [...] Out of thy loyns; th' unjust the just hath slain, [...] For envie that his Brothers Offering found [...] From Heav'n acceptance; but the bloodie Fact [...] Will be aveng'd, and th' others Faith approv'd [...] Loose no reward, though here thou see him die, [...] Rowling in dust and gore. To which our Sire. [...] 460 [...] Alas, both for the deed and for the cause! [...] But have I now seen Death? Is this the way [...] I must return to native dust? O sight [...] Of terrour, foul and ugly to behold, [...] Horrid to think, how horrible to feel! [...] To whom thus Michael. Death thou hast seen [...] In his first shape on man; but many shapes [...] Of Death, and many are the wayes that lead [...] To his grim Cave, all dismal; yet to sense [...] More terrible at th' entrance then within. [...] 470 [...] Some, as thou saw'st, by violent stroke shall die, [...] By Fire, Flood, Famin, by Intemperance more [...] In Meats and Drinks, which on the Earth shal bring [...] Diseases dire, of which a monstrous crew [...] Before thee shall appear; that thou mayst know [...] What miserie th' inabstinence of Eve [...] Shall bring on men. Immediately a place [...] Before his eyes appeard, sad, noysom, dark, [...] A Lazar-house it seemd, wherein were laid [...] Numbers of all diseas'd, all maladies [...] 480 [...] Of gastly Spasm, or racking torture, qualmes [...] Of heart-sick Agonie, all feavorous kinds, [...] Convulsions, Epilepsies, fierce Catarrhs, [...] Intestin Stone and Ulcer, Colic pangs, [...] Dropsies, and Asthma's, and Joint-racking Rheums. [...] Dire was the tossing, deep the groans, despair [...] Tended the sick busiest from Couch to Couch; [...] And over them triumphant Death his Dart [...] Shook, but delaid to strike, though oft invok't [...] With vows, as thir chief good, and final hope. [...] 490 [...] Sight so deform what heart of Rock could long [...] Drie-ey'd behold? Adam could not, but wept, [...] Though not of Woman born; compassion quell'd [...] His best of Man, and gave him up to tears [...] A space, till firmer thoughts restraind excess, [...] And scarce recovering words his plaint renew'd. [...] O miserable Mankind, to what fall [...] Degraded, to what wretched state reserv'd? [...] Better end heer unborn. Why is life giv'n [...] To be thus wrested from us? rather why [...] 500 [...] Obtruded on us thus? who if we knew [...] What we receive, would either not accept [...] Life offer'd, or soon beg to lay it down, [...] Glad to be so dismist in peace. Can thus [...] Th' Image of God in man created once [...] So goodly and erect, though faultie since, [...] To such unsightly sufferings be debas't [...] Under inhuman pains? Why should not Man, [...] Retaining still Divine similitude [...] In part, from such deformities be free, [...] 510 [...] And for his Makers Image sake exempt? [...] Thir Makers Image, answerd Michael, then [...] Forsook them, when themselves they villifi'd [...] To serve ungovern'd appetite, and took [...] His Image whom they serv'd, a brutish vice, [...] Inductive mainly to the sin of Eve. [...] Therefore so abject is thir punishment, [...] Disfiguring not Gods likeness, but thir own, [...] Or if his likeness, by themselves defac't [...] While they pervert pure Natures healthful rules [...] 520 [...] To loathsom sickness, worthily, since they [...] Gods Image did not reverence in themselves. [...] I yeild it just, said Adam, and submit. [...] But is there yet no other way, besides [...] These painful passages, how we may come [...] To Death, and mix with our connatural dust? [...] There is, said Michael, if thou well observe [...] The rule of not too much, by temperance taught [...] In what thou eatst and drinkst, seeking from thence [...] Due nourishment, not gluttonous delight, [...] 530 [...] Till many years over thy head return: [...] So maist thou live, till like ripe Fruit thou drop [...] Into thy Mothers lap, or be with ease [...] Gatherd, not harshly pluckt, for death mature: [...] This is old age; but then thou must outlive [...] Thy youth, thy strength, thy beauty, which will change [...] To witherd weak & gray; thy Senses then [...] Obtuse, all taste of pleasure must forgoe, [...] To what thou hast, and for the Aire of youth [...] Hopeful and cheerful, in thy blood will reigne [...] 540 [...] A melancholly damp of cold and dry [...] To waigh thy spirits down, and last consume [...] The Balme of Life. To whom our Ancestor. [...] Henceforth I flie not Death, nor would prolong [...] Life much, bent rather how I may be quit [...] Fairest and easiest of this combrous charge, [...] Which I must keep till my appointed day [...] Of rendring up, Michael to him repli'd. [...] Nor love thy Life, nor hate; but what thou livst [...] Live well, how long or short permit to Heav'n: [...] 550 [...] And now prepare thee for another sight. [...] He lookd and saw a spacious Plaine, whereon [...] Were Tents of various hue; by some were herds [...] Of Cattel grazing: others, whence the sound [...] Of Instruments that made melodious chime [...] Was heard, of Harp and Organ; and who moovd [...] Thir stops and chords was seen: his volant touch [...] Instinct through all proportions low and high [...] Fled and pursu'd transverse the resonant fugue. [...] In other part stood one who at the Forge [...] 560 [...] Labouring, two massie clods of Iron and Brass [...] Had melted (whether found where casual fire [...] Had wasted woods on Mountain or in Vale, [...] Down to the veins of Earth, thence gliding hot [...] To som Caves mouth, or whether washt by stream [...] From underground) the liquid Ore he dreind [...] Into fit moulds prepar'd; from which he formd [...] First his own Tooles; then, what might else be wrought [...] Fulfil or grav'n in mettle. After these, [...] But on the hether side a different sort [...] 570 [...] From the high neighbouring Hills, which was thir Seat, [...] Down to the Plain descended: by thir guise [...] Just men they seemd, and all thir study bent [...] To worship God aright, and know his works [...] Not hid, nor those things lost which might preserve [...] Freedom and Peace to men: they on the Plain [...] Long had not walkt, when from the Tents behold [...] A Beavie of fair Women, richly gay [...] In Gems and wanton dress; to the Harp they sung [...] Soft amorous Ditties, and in dance came on: [...] 580 [...] The Men though grave, ey'd them, and let thir eyes [...] Rove without rein, till in the amorous Net [...] Fast caught, they lik'd, and each his liking chose; [...] And now of love they treat till th' Eevning Star [...] Loves Harbinger appeerd; then all in heat [...] They light the Nuptial Torch, and bid invoke [...] Hymen, then first to marriage Rites invok't; [...] With Feast and Musick all the Tents resound. [...] Such happy interview and fair event [...] Of love & youth not lost, Songs, Garlands, Flours, [...] 590 [...] And charming Symphonies attach'd the heart [...] Of Adam, soon enclin'd to admit delight, [...] The bent of Nature; which he thus express'd. [...] True opener of mine eyes, prime Angel blest, [...] Much better seems this Vision, and more hope [...] Of peaceful dayes portends, then those two past; [...] Those were of hate and death, or pain much worse, [...] Here Nature seems fulfilld in all her ends. [...] To whom thus Michael. Judg not what is best [...] By pleasure, though to Nature seeming meet, [...] 600 [...] Created, as thou art, to nobler end [...] Holie and pure, conformitie divine. [...] Those Tents thou sawst so pleasant, were the Tents [...] Of wickedness, wherein shall dwell his Race [...] Who slew his Brother; studious they appere [...] Of Arts that polish Life, Inventers rare, [...] Unmindful of thir Maker, though his Spirit [...] Taught them, but they his gifts acknowledg'd none. [...] Yet they a beauteous ofspring shall beget; [...] For that fair <b>femal</b> Troop thou sawst, that seemd [...] 610 [...] Of Goddesses, so blithe, so smooth, so gay, [...] Yet empty of all good wherein consists [...] Womans domestic honour and chief praise; [...] Bred onely and completed to the taste [...] Of lustful apperence, to sing, to dance, [...] To dress, and troule the Tongue, and roule the Eye. [...] To these that sober Race of Men, whose lives [...] Religious titl'd them the Sons of God, [...] Shall yeild up all thir vertue, all thir fame [...] Ignobly, to the trains and to the smiles [...] 620 [...] Of these fair Atheists, and now swim in joy, [...] (Erelong to swim at larg) and laugh; for which [...] The world erelong a world of tears must weepe. [...] To whom thus Adam of short joy bereft. [...] O pittie and shame, that they who to live well [...] Enterd so faire, should turn aside to tread [...] Paths indirect, or in the mid way faint! [...] But still I see the tenor of Mans woe [...] Holds on the same, from Woman to begin. [...] From Mans effeminate slackness it begins, [...] 630 [...] Said th' Angel, who should better hold his place [...] By wisdome, and superiour gifts receavd. [...] But now prepare thee for another Scene. [...] He lookd and saw wide Territorie spred [...] Before him, Towns, and rural works between, [...] Cities of Men with lofty Gates and Towrs, [...] Concours in Arms, fierce Faces threatning Warr, [...] Giants of mightie Bone, and bould emprise; [...] Part wield thir Arms, part courb the foaming Steed, [...] Single or in Array of Battel rang'd [...] 640 [...] Both Horse and Foot, nor idely mustring stood; [...] One way a Band select from forage drives [...] A herd of Beeves, faire Oxen and faire Kine [...] From a fat Meddow ground; or fleecy Flock, [...] Ewes and thir bleating Lambs over the Plaine, [...] Thir Bootie; scarce with Life the Shepherds flye, [...] But call in aide, which tacks a bloody Fray; [...] With cruel Tournament the Squadrons joine; [...] Where Cattel pastur'd late, now scatterd lies [...] With Carcasses and Arms th' ensanguind Field [...] 650 [...] Deserted: Others to a Citie strong [...] Lay Siege, encampt; by Batterie, Scale, and Mine, [...] Assaulting; others from the Wall defend [...] With Dart and Jav'lin, Stones and sulfurous Fire; [...] On each hand slaughter and gigantic deeds. [...] In other part the scepter'd Haralds call [...] To Council in the Citie Gates: anon [...] Grey-headed men and grave, with Warriours mixt, [...] Assemble, and Harangues are heard, but soon [...] In factious opposition, till at last [...] 660 [...] Of middle Age one rising, eminent [...] In wise deport, spake much of Right and Wrong, [...] Of Justice, of Religion, Truth and Peace, [...] And Judgement from above: him old and young [...] Exploded, and had seiz'd with violent hands, [...] Had not a Cloud descending snatch'd him thence [...] Unseen amid the throng: so violence [...] Proceeded, and Oppression, and Sword-Law [...] Through all the Plain, and refuge none was found. [...] Adam was all in tears, and to his guide [...] 670 [...] Lamenting turnd full sad; O what are these, [...] Deaths Ministers, not Men, who thus deal Death [...] Inhumanly to men, and multiply [...] Ten thousand fould the sin of him who slew [...] His Brother; for of whom such massacher [...] Make they but of thir Brethren, men of men? [...] But who was that Just Man, whom had not Heav'n [...] Rescu'd, had in his Righteousness bin lost? [...] To whom thus Michael; These are the product [...] Of those ill-mated Marriages thou saw'st; [...] 680 [...] Where good with bad were matcht, who of themselves [...] Abhor to joyn; and by imprudence mixt, [...] Produce prodigious Births of bodie or mind. [...] Such were these Giants, men of high renown; [...] For in those dayes Might onely shall be admir'd, [...] And Valour and Heroic Vertu call'd; [...] To overcome in Battel, and subdue [...] Nations, and bring home spoils with infinite [...] Man-slaughter, shall be held the highest pitch [...] Of human Glorie, and for Glorie done [...] 690 [...] Of triumph, to be styl'd great Conquerours, [...] Patrons of Mankind, Gods, and Sons of Gods, [...] Destroyers rightlier call'd and Plagues of men. [...] Thus Fame shall be achiev'd, renown on Earth, [...] And what most merits fame in silence hid. [...] But hee the seventh from thee, whom thou beheldst [...] The onely righteous in a World perverse, [...] And therefore hated, therefore so beset [...] With Foes for daring single to be just, [...] And utter odious Truth, that God would come [...] 700 [...] To judge them with his Saints: Him the most High [...] Rapt in a balmie Cloud with winged Steeds [...] Did, as thou sawst, receave, to walk with God [...] High in Salvation and the Climes of bliss, [...] Exempt from Death; to shew thee what reward [...] Awaits the good, the rest what punishment; [...] Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold. [...] He look'd, & saw the face of things quite chang'd; [...] The brazen Throat of Warr had ceast to roar, [...] All now was turn'd to jollitie and game, [...] 710 [...] To luxurie and riot, feast and dance, [...] Marrying or prostituting, as befell, [...] Rape or Adulterie, where passing faire [...] Allurd them; thence from Cups to civil Broiles. [...] At length a Reverend Sire among them came, [...] And of thir doings great dislike declar'd, [...] And testifi'd against thir wayes; hee oft [...] Frequented thir Assemblies, whereso met, [...] Triumphs or Festivals, and to them preachd [...] Conversion and Repentance, as to Souls [...] 720 [...] In prison under Judgements imminent: [...] But all in vain: which when he saw, he ceas'd [...] Contending, and remov'd his Tents farr off; [...] Then from the Mountain hewing Timber tall, [...] Began to build a Vessel of huge bulk, [...] Measur'd by Cubit, length, & breadth, and highth, [...] Smeard round with Pitch, and in the side a dore [...] Contriv'd, and of provisions laid in large [...] For Man and Beast: when loe a wonder strange! [...] Of everie Beast, and Bird, and Insect small [...] 730 [...] Came seavens, and pairs, and enterd in, as taught [...] Thir order; last the Sire, and his three Sons [...] With thir four Wives, and God made fast the dore. [...] Meanwhile the Southwind rose, & with black wings [...] Wide hovering, all the Clouds together drove [...] From under Heav'n; the Hills to their supplie [...] Vapour, and Exhalation dusk and moist, [...] Sent up amain; and now the thick'nd Skie [...] Like a dark Ceeling stood; down rush'd the Rain [...] Impetuous, and continu'd till the Earth [...] 740 [...] No more was seen; the floating Vessel swum [...] Uplifted; and secure with beaked prow [...] Rode tilting o're the Waves, all dwellings else [...] Flood overwhelmd, and them with all thir pomp [...] Deep under water rould; Sea cover'd Sea, [...] Sea without shoar; and in thir Palaces [...] Where luxurie late reign'd, Sea-monsters whelp'd [...] And stabl'd; of Mankind, so numerous late, [...] All left, in one small bottom swum imbark't. [...] How didst thou grieve then, Adam, to behold [...] 750 [...] The end of all thy Ofspring, end so sad, [...] Depopulation; thee another Floud, [...] Of tears and sorrow a Floud thee also drown'd, [...] And sunk thee as thy Sons; till gently reard [...] By th' Angel, on thy feet thou stoodst at last, [...] Though comfortless, as when a Father mourns [...] His Childern, all in view destroyd at once; [...] And scarce to th' Angel utterdst thus thy plaint. [...] O Visions ill foreseen! better had I [...] Liv'd ignorant of future, so had borne [...] 760 [...] My part of evil onely, each dayes lot [...] Anough to bear; those now, that were dispenst [...] The burd'n of many Ages, on me light [...] At once, by my foreknowledge gaining Birth [...] Abortive, to torment me ere thir being, [...] With thought that they must be.

40|$|Numerous reports {{since the}} 1970 s {{showed that there}} was a great concern about the lack of <b>femals,</b> {{students}} entering the sciences in Australia. Despite these concerns, there still appears to be a reluctance on the part of females to enter the sciences. This article draws on research conducted with Year 10 students within the Perth metropolitan area and examines the effects of encouragement as perceived by these female students. A qualitative methodological approach was utilised, where, perceptions were compiled from individual in-depth interviews, open ended questionnaires, and through participatory observation in the classrooms, This study has been reported from a feminist position which locates gender as central and which posits that human subjects are positioned and position themselves in a multiplicity of ways through the discourses to which they have access. This study showed that encouragement played a major part in the. way female, students actively positioned themselves in the science classroom as high achievers, These students also spoke, out against fitting into the feminine, 'mould' of being quiet and hard working. The way they positioned themselves was influential in these female students' choice to continue with sciences into the higher secondary level and ultimately into further education and possibly a career...|$|R

The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of litter size at birth on offspring raising and an attempt to establish the litter size that would be optimal for the nursing process. We analysed litters of 390 one-year-old females of three color types: Black Velvet (or short NAP), Hedlund White, and Silverblue. Each study group comprised 130 mink. Within each group, we analysed the litter size and birth and the number of pups that survived until the age of seven days. Also percentage proportion of various classes of litter sizes is given and survival rate (in percentage) of pups in each litter has been calculated. The analysis reveals that if litter sizes comprise 10 – 11 pups, most of them will not be properly nursed, and as few as 2 to 6 pups have a chance to survive in many of such large litters; only in Black Velvet <b>femals,</b> the decline in litter size was to 9 pups, on average. An interesting fact also is that females that give birth to a single pup often do not raise it at all. The presented analysis leads to a conclusion that litters of 2 to 9 pups are best in terms of nursing success, with apparent differences resulting from the color type.

This way, knowing the level of expression of the main features on which meat production depends, positive premises are created fo developing a technical frame to facilitate change in the desired dirction, of the genetic potential for this production for the sheep of this breed situated in the plateau area of Moldavia. The biological material was represented by the young sheep, males and <b>femals,</b> of Tigaie breed derived from the agricultural holdings situated in Bacau, Vaslui and Vrancea counties. The study of the obtained values shows the that the best performance {{were made by the}} lambs from the Vrancea county. So, while for the lots from Vaslui and Bacau the determined daily average increase registered average values of 132 g and 156 g, the lot composed of lambs brought from the livestock units from Vrancea the indicator was of 180 g, exceeding with 12. 77 % the daily average of the fattened population. Also, during the entire fattening period, the lot formed by lambs from Vrancea has exceeded with 24. 61 % and 11. 13 % the total increase determined for the lots from Vaslui and Bacau...|$|R

[...] This Woman whom thou mad'st to be my help, [...] And gav'st me as thy perfet gift, so good, [...] So fit, so acceptable, so Divine, [...] That from her hand I could suspect no ill, [...] 140 [...] And what she did, whatever in it self, [...] Her doing seem'd to justifie the deed; [...] Shee gave me of the Tree, and I did eate. [...] To whom the sovran Presence thus repli'd. [...] Was shee thy God, that her thou didst obey [...] Before his voice, or was shee made thy guide, [...] Superior, or but equal, that to her [...] Thou did'st resigne thy Manhood, and the Place [...] Wherein God set thee above her made of thee, [...] And for thee, whose perfection farr excell'd [...] 150 [...] Hers in all real dignitie: Adornd [...] She was indeed, and lovely to attract [...] Thy Love, not thy Subjection, and her Gifts [...] Were such as under Government well seem'd, [...] Unseemly to beare rule, which was thy part [...] And person, had'st thou known thy self aright.

[...] To whom sad Eve with shame nigh overwhelm'd, [...] Confessing soon, yet not before her Judge [...] 160 [...] Bold or loquacious, thus abasht repli'd.

[...] Because thou hast done this, thou art accurst [...] Above all Cattel, each Beast of the Field; [...] Upon thy Belly groveling thou shalt goe, [...] And dust shalt eat all the days of thy Life. [...] Between Thee and the Woman I will put [...] Enmitie, and between thine and her Seed; [...] 180 [...] Her Seed shall bruise thy head, thou bruise his heel. [...] So spake this Oracle, then verifi'd [...] When Jesus son of Mary second Eve, [...] Saw Satan fall like Lightning down from Heav'n, [...] Prince of the Aire; then rising from his Grave [...] Spoild Principalities and Powers, triumpht [...] In open shew, and with ascention bright [...] Captivity led captive through the Aire, [...] The Realme it self of Satan long usurpt, [...] Whom he shall tread at last under our feet; [...] 190 [...] Eevn hee who now foretold his fatal bruise, [...] And to the Woman thus his Sentence turn'd. [...] Thy sorrow I will greatly multiplie [...] By thy Conception; Children thou shalt bring [...] In sorrow forth, and to thy Husbands will [...] Thine shall submit, hee over thee shall rule. [...] On Adam last thus judgement he pronounc'd. [...] Because thou hast heark'nd {{to the voice of}} thy Wife, [...] And eaten of the Tree concerning which [...] I charg'd thee, saying: Thou shalt not eate thereof, [...] 200 [...] Curs'd is the ground for thy sake, thou in sorrow [...] Shalt eate thereof all the days of thy Life; [...] Thornes also and Thistles it shall bring thee forth [...] Unbid, and thou shalt eate th' Herb of th' Field, [...] In the sweat of thy Face shalt thou eate Bread, [...] Till thou return unto the ground, for thou [...] Out of the ground wast taken, know thy Birth, [...] For dust thou art, and shalt to dust returne. [...] So judg'd he Man, both Judge and Saviour sent, [...] And th' instant stroke of Death denounc't that day [...] 210 [...] Remov'd farr off; then pittying how they stood [...] Before him naked to the aire, that now [...] Must suffer change, disdain'd not to begin [...] Thenceforth the forme of servant to assume, [...] As when he wash'd his servants feet, so now [...] As Father of his Familie he clad [...] Thir nakedness with Skins of Beasts, or slain, [...] Or as the Snake with youthful Coate repaid; [...] And thought not much to cloath his Enemies: [...] Nor hee thir outward onely with the Skins [...] 220 [...] Of Beasts, but inward nakedness, much more [...] Opprobrious, with his Robe of righteousness, [...] Araying cover'd from his Fathers sight. [...] To him with swift ascent he up returnd, [...] Into his blissful bosom reassum'd [...] In glory as of old, to him appeas'd [...] All, though all-knowing, what had past with Man [...] Recounted, mixing intercession sweet. [...] Meanwhile ere thus was sin'd and judg'd on Earth, [...] Within the Gates of Hell sate Sin and Death, [...] 230 [...] In counterview within the Gates, that now [...] Stood open wide, belching outrageous flame [...] Farr into Chaos, since the Fiend pass'd through, [...] Sin opening, who thus now to Death began. [...] O Son, why sit we here each other viewing [...] Idlely, while Satan our great Author thrives [...] In other Worlds, and happier Seat provides [...] For us his ofspring deare? It cannot be [...] But that success attends him; if mishap, [...] Ere this he had return'd, with fury driv'n [...] 240 [...] By his Avenger, since no place like this [...] Can fit his punishment, or their revenge. [...] Methinks I feel new strength within me rise, [...] Wings growing, and Dominion giv'n me large [...] Beyond this Deep; whatever drawes me on, [...] Or sympathie, or som connatural force [...] Powerful at greatest distance to unite [...] With secret amity things of like kinde [...] By secretest conveyance. Thou my Shade [...] Inseparable must with mee along: [...] 250 [...] For Death from Sin no power can separate. [...] But least the difficultie of passing back [...] Stay his returne perhaps over this Gulfe [...] Impassable, impervious, let us try [...] Adventrous work, yet to thy power and mine [...] Not unagreeable, to found a path [...] Over this Maine from Hell to that new World [...] Where Satan now prevailes, a Monument [...] Of merit high to all th' infernal Host, [...] Easing thir passage hence, for intercourse, [...] 260 [...] Or transmigration, as thir lot shall lead. [...] Nor can I miss the way, so strongly drawn [...] By this new felt attraction and instinct. [...] Whom thus the meager Shadow answerd soon. [...] Goe whither Fate and inclination strong [...] Leads thee, I shall not lag behinde, nor erre [...] The way, thou leading, such a sent I draw [...] Of carnage, prey innumerable, and taste [...] The savour of Death from all things there that live: [...] Nor shall I to the work thou enterprisest [...] 270 [...] Be wanting, but afford thee equal aid. [...] So saying, with delight he snuff'd the smell [...] Of mortal change on Earth. As when a flock [...] Of ravenous Fowl, though many a League remote, [...] Against the day of Battel, to a Field, [...] Where Armies lie encampt, come flying, lur'd [...] With sent of living Carcasses design'd [...] For death, the following day, in bloodie fight. [...] So sented the grim Feature, and upturn'd [...] His Nostril wide into the murkie Air, [...] 280 [...] Sagacious of his Quarrey from so farr. [...] Then Both from out Hell Gates into the waste [...] Wide Anarchie of Chaos damp and dark [...] Flew divers, & with Power (thir Power was great) [...] Hovering upon the Waters; what they met [...] Solid or slimie, as in raging Sea [...] Tost up and down, together crowded drove [...] From each side shoaling towards the mouth of Hell. [...] As when two Polar Winds blowing adverse [...] Upon the Cronian Sea, together drive [...] 290 [...] Mountains of Ice, that stop th' imagin'd way [...] Beyond Petsora Eastward, to the rich [...] Cathaian Coast. The aggregated Soyle [...] Death with his Mace petrific, cold and dry, [...] As with a Trident smote, and fix't as firm [...] As Delos floating once; the rest his look [...] Bound with Gorgonian rigor not to move, [...] And with Asphaltic slime; broad as the Gate, [...] Deep to the Roots of Hell the gather'd beach [...] They fasten'd, and the Mole immense wraught on [...] 300 [...] Over the foaming deep high Archt, a Bridge [...] Of length prodigious joyning to the Wall [...] Immoveable of this now fenceless world [...] Forfeit to Death; from hence a passage broad, [...] Smooth, easie, inoffensive down to Hell. [...] So, if great things to small may be compar'd, [...] Xerxes, the Libertie of Greece to yoke, [...] From Susa his Memnonian Palace high [...] Came to the Sea, and over Hellespont [...] Bridging his way, Europe with Asia joyn'd, [...] 310 [...] And scourg'd with many a stroak th' indignant waves.

[...] Thou hast atchiev'd our libertie, confin'd [...] Within Hell Gates till now, thou us impow'rd [...] To fortifie thus farr, and overlay [...] 370 [...] With this portentous Bridge the dark Abyss. [...] Thine now is all this World, thy vertue hath won [...] What thy hands builded not, thy Wisdom gain'd [...] With odds what Warr hath lost, and fully aveng'd [...] Our foile in Heav'n; here thou shalt Monarch reign, [...] There didst not; there let him still Victor sway, [...] As Battel hath adjudg'd, from this new World [...] Retiring, by his own doom alienated, [...] And henceforth Monarchie with thee divide [...] Of all things, parted by th' Empyreal bounds, [...] 380 [...] His Quadrature, from thy Orbicular World, [...] Or trie thee now more dang'rous to his Throne.

[...] Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers, [...] 460 [...] For in possession such, not onely of right, [...] I call ye and declare ye now, returnd [...] Successful beyond hope, to lead ye forth [...] Triumphant out of this infernal Pit [...] Abominable, accurst, the house of woe, [...] And Dungeon of our Tyrant: Now possess, [...] As Lords, a spacious World, to our native Heaven [...] Little inferiour, by my adventure hard [...] With peril great atchiev'd. Long were to tell [...] What I have don, what sufferd, with what paine [...] 470 [...] Voyag'd the unreal, vast, unbounded deep [...] Of horrible confusion, over which [...] By Sin and Death a broad way now is pav'd [...] To expedite your glorious march; but I [...] Toild out my uncouth passage, forc't to ride [...] Th' untractable Abysse, plung'd in the womb [...] Of unoriginal Night and Chaos wilde, [...] That jealous of thir secrets fiercely oppos'd [...] My journey strange, with clamorous uproare [...] Protesting Fate supreame; thence how I found [...] 480 [...] The new created World, which fame in Heav'n [...] Long had foretold, a Fabrick wonderful [...] Of absolute perfection, therein Man [...] Plac't in a Paradise, by our exile [...] Made happie: Him by fraud I have seduc'd [...] From his Creator, and the more to increase [...] Your wonder, with an Apple; he thereat [...] Offended, worth your laughter, hath giv'n up [...] Both his beloved Man and all his World, [...] To Sin and Death a prey, and so to us, [...] 490 [...] Without our hazard, labour or allarme, [...] To range in, and to dwell, and over Man [...] To rule, as over all he should have rul'd. [...] True is, mee also he hath judg'd, or rather [...] Mee not, but the brute Serpent in whose shape [...] Man I deceav'd: that which to mee belongs, [...] Is enmity, which he will put between [...] Mee and Mankinde; I am to bruise his heel; [...] His Seed, when is not set, shall bruise my head: [...] A World who would not purchase with a bruise, [...] 500 [...] Or much more grievous pain? Ye have th' account [...] Of my performance: What remaines, ye Gods, [...] But up and enter now into full bliss. [...] So having said, a while he stood, expecting [...] Thir universal shout and high applause [...] To fill his eare, when contrary he hears [...] On all sides, from innumerable tongues [...] A dismal universal hiss, the sound [...] Of public scorn; he wonderd, but not long [...] Had leasure, wondring at himself now more; [...] 510 [...] His Visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare, [...] His Armes clung to his Ribs, his Leggs entwining [...] Each other, till supplanted down he fell [...] A monstrous Serpent on his Belly prone, [...] Reluctant, but in vaine, a greater power [...] Now rul'd him, punisht in the shape he sin'd, [...] According to his doom: he would have spoke, [...] But hiss for hiss returnd with forked tongue [...] To forked tongue, for now were all transform'd [...] Alike, to Serpents all as accessories [...] 520 [...] To his bold Riot: dreadful was the din [...] Of hissing through the Hall, thick swarming now [...] With complicated monsters, head and taile, [...] Scorpion and Asp, and Amphisbaena dire, [...] Cerastes hornd, Hydrus, and Ellops drear, [...] And Dipsas (Not so thick swarm'd once the Soil [...] Bedropt with blood of Gorgon, or the Isle [...] Ophiusa) but still greatest hee the midst, [...] Now Dragon grown, larger then whom the Sun [...] Ingenderd in the Pythian Vale on slime, [...] 530 [...] Huge Python, and his Power no less he seem'd [...] Above the rest still to retain; they all [...] Him follow'd issuing forth to th' open Field, [...] Where all yet left of that revolted Rout [...] Heav'n-fall'n, in station stood or just array, [...] Sublime with expectation when to see [...] In Triumph issuing forth thir glorious Chief; [...] They saw, but other sight instead, a crowd [...] Of ugly Serpents; horror on them fell, [...] And horrid sympathie; for what they saw, [...] 540 [...] They felt themselvs now changing; down thir arms, [...] Down fell both Spear and Shield, down they as fast, [...] And the dire hiss renew'd, and the dire form [...] Catcht by Contagion, like in punishment, [...] As in thir crime. Thus was th' applause they meant, [...] Turnd to exploding hiss, triumph to shame [...] Cast on themselves from thir own mouths. There stood [...] A Grove hard by, sprung up with this thir change, [...] His will who reigns above, to aggravate [...] Thir penance, laden with fair Fruit, like that [...] 550 [...] Which grew in Paradise, the bait of Eve [...] Us'd by the Tempter: on that prospect strange [...] Thir earnest eyes they fix'd, imagining [...] For one forbidden Tree a multitude [...] Now ris'n, to work them furder woe or shame; [...] Yet parcht with scalding thurst and hunger fierce, [...] Though to delude them sent, could not abstain, [...] But on they rould in heaps, and up the Trees [...] Climbing, sat thicker then the snakie locks [...] That curld Megaera: greedily they pluck'd [...] 560 [...] The Frutage fair to sight, like that which grew [...] Neer that bituminous Lake where Sodom flam'd; [...] This more delusive, not the touch, but taste [...] Deceav'd; they fondly thinking to allay [...] Thir appetite with gust, instead of Fruit [...] Chewd bitter Ashes, which th' offended taste [...] With spattering noise rejected: oft they assayd, [...] Hunger and thirst constraining, drugd as oft, [...] With hatefullest disrelish writh'd thir jaws [...] With foot and cinders fill'd; so oft they fell [...] 570 [...] Into the same illusion, not as Man [...] Whom they triumph'd once lapst. Thus were they plagu'd [...] And worn with Famin, long and ceasless hiss, [...] Till thir lost shape, permitted, they resum'd, [...] Yearly enjoynd, some say, to undergo [...] This annual humbling certain number'd days, [...] To dash thir pride, and joy for Man seduc't. [...] However some tradition they dispers'd [...] Among the Heathen of thir purchase got, [...] And Fabl'd how the Serpent, whom they calld [...] 580 [...] Ophion with Eurynome, the wide- [...] Encroaching Eve perhaps, had first the rule [...] Of high Olympus, thence by Saturn driv'n [...] And Ops, ere yet Dictaean Jove was born. [...] Mean while in Paradise the hellish pair [...] Too soon arriv'd, Sin there in power before, [...] Once actual, now in body, and to dwell [...] Habitual habitant; behind her Death [...] Close following pace for pace, not mounted yet [...] On his pale Horse: to whom Sin thus began. [...] 590 [...] Second of Satan sprung, all conquering Death, [...] What thinkst thou of our Empire now, though earnd [...] With travail difficult, not better farr [...] Then stil at Hels dark threshold to have sate watch, [...] Unnam'd, undreaded, and thy self half starv'd? [...] Whom thus the Sin-born Monster answerd soon. [...] To mee, who with eternal Famin pine, [...] Alike is Hell, or Paradise, or Heaven, [...] There best, where most with ravin I may meet; [...] Which here, though plenteous, all too little seems [...] 600 [...] To stuff this Maw, this vast unhide-bound Corps. [...] To whom th' incestuous Mother thus repli'd. [...] Thou therefore on these Herbs, and Fruits, & Flours [...] Feed first, on each Beast next, and Fish, and Fowle, [...] No homely morsels, and whatever thing [...] The Sithe of Time mowes down, devour unspar'd, [...] Till I in Man residing through the Race, [...] His thoughts, his looks, words, actions all infect, [...] And season him thy last and sweetest prey. [...] This said, they both betook them several wayes, [...] 610 [...] Both to destroy, or unimmortal make [...] All kinds, and for destruction to mature [...] Sooner or later; which th' Almightie seeing, [...] From his transcendent Seat the Saints among, [...] To those bright Orders utterd thus his voice. [...] See with what heat these Dogs of Hell advance [...] To waste and havoc yonder World, which I [...] So fair and good created, and had still [...] Kept in that state, had not the folly of Man [...] Let in these wastful Furies, who impute [...] 620 [...] Folly to mee, so doth the Prince of Hell [...] And his Adherents, that with so much ease [...] I suffer them to enter and possess [...] A place so heav'nly, and conniving seem [...] To gratifie my scornful Enemies, [...] That laugh, as if transported with some fit [...] Of Passion, I to them had quitted all, [...] At random yeilded up to their misrule; [...] And know not that I call'd and drew them thither [...] My Hell-hounds, to lick up the draff and filth [...] 630 [...] Which mans polluting Sin with taint hath shed [...] On what was pure, till cramm'd and gorg'd, nigh burst [...] With suckt and glutted offal, at one fling [...] Of thy victorious Arm, well-pleasing Son, [...] Both Sin, and Death, and yawning Grave at last [...] Through Chaos hurld, obstruct the mouth of Hell [...] For ever, and seal up his ravenous Jawes. [...] Then Heav'n and Earth renewd shall be made pure [...] To sanctitie that shall receive no staine: [...] Till then the Curse pronounc't on both precedes. [...] 640 [...] Hee ended, and the heav'nly Audience loud [...] Sung Halleluia, as the sound of Seas, [...] Through multitude that sung: Just are thy ways, [...] Righteous are thy Decrees on all thy Works; [...] Who can extenuate thee? Next, to the Son, [...] Destin'd restorer of Mankind, by whom [...] New Heav'n and Earth shall to the Ages rise, [...] Or down from Heav'n descend. Such was thir song, [...] While the Creator calling forth by name [...] His mightie Angels gave them several charge, [...] 650 [...] As sorted best with present things. The Sun [...] Had first his precept so to move, so shine, [...] As might affect the Earth with cold and heat [...] Scarce tollerable, and from the North to call [...] Decrepit Winter, from the South to bring [...] Solstitial summers heat. To the blanc Moone [...] Her office they prescrib'd, to th' other five [...] Thir planetarie motions and aspects [...] In Sextile, Square, and Trine, and Opposite, [...] Of noxious efficacie, and when to joyne [...] 660 [...] In Synod unbenigne, and taught the fixt [...] Thir influence malignant when to showre, [...] Which of them rising with the Sun, or falling, [...] Should prove tempestuous: To the Winds they set [...] Thir corners, when with bluster to confound [...] Sea, Aire, and Shoar, the Thunder when to rowle [...] With terror through the dark Aereal Hall. [...] Some say he bid his Angels turne ascanse [...] The Poles of Earth twice ten degrees and more [...] From the Suns Axle; they with labour push'd [...] 670 [...] Oblique the Centric Globe: Som say the Sun [...] Was bid turn Reines from th' Equinoctial Rode [...] Like distant breadth to Taurus with the Seav'n [...] Atlantick Sisters, and the Spartan Twins [...] Up to the Tropic Crab; thence down amaine [...] By Leo and the Virgin and the Scales, [...] As deep as Capricorne, to bring in change [...] Of Seasons to each Clime; else had the Spring [...] Perpetual smil'd on Earth with vernant Flours, [...] Equal in Days and Nights, except to those [...] 680 [...] Beyond the Polar Circles; to them Day [...] Had unbenighted shon, while the low Sun [...] To recompence his distance, in thir sight [...] Had rounded still th' Horizon, and not known [...] Or East or West, which had forbid the Snow [...] From cold Estotiland, and South as farr [...] Beneath Magellan. At that tasted Fruit [...] The Sun, as from Thyestean Banquet, turn'd [...] His course intended; else how had the World [...] Inhabited, though sinless, more then now, [...] 690 [...] Avoided pinching cold and scorching heate? [...] These changes in the Heav'ns, though slow, produc'd [...] Like change on Sea and Land, sideral blast, [...] Vapour, and Mist, and Exhalation hot, [...] Corrupt and Pestilent: Now from the North [...] Of Norumbega, and the Samoed shoar [...] Bursting thir brazen Dungeon, armd with ice [...] And snow and haile and stormie gust and flaw, [...] Boreas and Caecias and Argestes loud [...] And Thrascias rend the Woods and Seas upturn; [...] 700 [...] With adverse blast up-turns them from the South [...] Notus and Afer black with thundrous Clouds [...] From Serraliona; thwart of these as fierce [...] Forth rush the Levant and the Ponent Windes [...] Eurus and Zephir with thir lateral noise, [...] Sirocco, and Libecchio. Thus began [...] Outrage from liveless things; but Discord first [...] Daughter of Sin, among th' irrational, [...] Death introduc'd through fierce antipathie: [...] Beast now with Beast gan war, & Fowle with Fowle, [...] 710 [...] And Fish with Fish; to graze the Herb all leaving, [...] Devourd each other; nor stood much in awe [...] Of Man, but fled him, or with count'nance grim [...] Glar'd on him passing: these were from without [...] The growing miseries, which Adam saw [...] Alreadie in part, though hid in gloomiest shade, [...] To sorrow abandond, but worse felt within, [...] And in a troubl'd Sea of passion tost, [...] Thus to disburd'n sought with sad complaint. [...] O miserable of happie! is this the end [...] 720 [...] Of this new glorious World, and mee so late [...] The Glory of that Glory, who now becom [...] Accurst of blessed, hide me from the face [...] Of God, whom to behold was then my highth [...] Of happiness: yet well, if here would end [...] The miserie, I deserv'd it, and would beare [...] My own deservings; but this will not serve; [...] All that I eate or drink, or shall beget, [...] Is propagated curse. O voice once heard [...] Delightfully, Encrease And Multiply, [...] 730 [...] Now death to heare! for what can I encrease [...] Or multiplie, but curses on my head? [...] Who of all Ages to succeed, but feeling [...] The evil on him brought by me, will curse [...] My Head, Ill fare our Ancestor impure, [...] For this we may thank Adam; but his thanks [...] Shall be the execration; so besides [...] Mine own that bide upon me, all from mee [...] Shall with a fierce reflux on mee redound, [...] On mee as on thir natural center light [...] 740 [...] Heavie, though in thir place. O fleeting joyes [...] Of Paradise, deare bought with lasting woes! [...] Did I request thee, Maker, from my Clay [...] To mould me Man, did I sollicite thee [...] From darkness to promote me, or here place [...] In this delicious Garden? as my Will [...] Concurd not to my being, it were but right [...] And equal to reduce me to my dust, [...] Desirous to resigne, and render back [...] All I receav'd, unable to performe [...] 750 [...] Thy terms too hard, by which I was to hold [...] The good I sought not. To the loss of that, [...] Sufficient penaltie, why hast thou added [...] The sense of endless woes? inexplicable [...] Thy Justice seems; yet to say truth, too late, [...] I thus contest; then should have been refusd [...] Those terms whatever, when they were propos'd: [...] Thou didst accept them; wilt thou enjoy the good, [...] Then cavil the conditions? and though God [...] Made thee without thy leave, what if thy Son [...] 760 [...] Prove disobedient, and reprov'd, retort, [...] Wherefore didst thou beget me? I sought it not: [...] Wouldst thou admit for his contempt of thee [...] That proud excuse? yet him not thy election, [...] But Natural necessity begot. [...] God made thee of choice his own, and of his own [...] To serve him, thy reward was of his grace, [...] Thy punishment then justly is at his Will. [...] Be it so, for I submit, his doom is fair, [...] That dust I am, and shall to dust returne: [...] 770 [...] O welcom hour whenever! why delayes [...] His hand to execute what his Decree [...] Fixd on this day? why do I overlive, [...] Why am I mockt with death, and length'nd out [...] To deathless pain? how gladly would I meet [...] Mortalitie my sentence, and be Earth [...] Insensible, how glad would lay me down [...] As in my Mothers lap? there I should rest [...] And sleep secure; his dreadful voice no more [...] Would Thunder in my ears, no fear of worse [...] 780 [...] To mee and to my ofspring would torment me [...] With cruel expectation. Yet one doubt [...] Pursues me still, least all I cannot die, [...] Least that pure breath of Life, the Spirit of Man [...] Which God inspir'd, cannot together perish [...] With this corporeal Clod; then in the Grave, [...] Or in some other dismal place, who knows [...] But I shall die a living Death? O thought [...] Horrid, if true! yet why? it was but breath [...] Of Life that sinn'd; what dies but what had life [...] 790 [...] And sin? the Bodie properly hath neither. [...] All of me then shall die: let this appease [...] The doubt, since humane reach no further knows. [...] For though the Lord of all be infinite, [...] Is his wrauth also? be it, man is not so, [...] But mortal doom'd. How can he exercise [...] Wrath without end on Man whom Death must end? [...] Can he make deathless Death? that were to make [...] Strange contradiction, which to God himself [...] Impossible is held, as Argument [...] 800 [...] Of weakness, not of Power. Will he, draw out, [...] For angers sake, finite to infinite [...] In punisht man, to satisfie his rigour [...] Satisfi'd never; that were to extend [...] His Sentence beyond dust and Natures Law, [...] By which all Causes else according still [...] To the reception of thir matter act, [...] Not to th' extent of thir own Spheare. But say [...] That Death be not one stroak, as I suppos'd, [...] Bereaving sense, but endless miserie [...] 810 [...] From this day onward, which I feel begun [...] Both in me, and without me, and so last [...] To perpetuitie; Ay me, that fear [...] Comes thundring back with dreadful revolution [...] On my defensless head; both Death and I [...] Am found Eternal, and incorporate both, [...] Nor I on my part single, in mee all [...] Posteritie stands curst: Fair Patrimonie [...] That I must leave ye, Sons; O were I able [...] To waste it all my self, and leave ye none! [...] 820 [...] So disinherited how would ye bless [...] Me now your Curse! Ah, why should all mankind [...] For one mans fault thus guiltless be condemn'd, [...] If guiltless? But from mee what can proceed, [...] But all corrupt, both Mind and Will deprav'd, [...] Not to do onely, but to will the same [...] With me? how can they acquitted stand [...] In sight of God? Him after all Disputes [...] Forc't I absolve: all my evasions vain [...] And reasonings, though through Mazes, lead me still [...] 830 [...] But to my own conviction: first and last [...] On mee, mee onely, as the sourse and spring [...] Of all corruption, all the blame lights due; [...] So might the wrauth, Fond wish! couldst thou support [...] That burden heavier then the Earth to bear, [...] Then all the world much heavier, though divided [...] With that bad Woman? Thus what thou desir'st, [...] And what thou fearst, alike destroyes all hope [...] Of refuge, and concludes thee miserable [...] Beyond all past example and future, [...] 840 [...] To Satan onely like both crime and doom. [...] O Conscience, into what Abyss of fears [...] And horrors hast thou driv'n me; out of which [...] I find no way, from deep to deeper plung'd! [...] Thus Adam to himself lamented loud [...] Through the still Night, now now, as ere man fell, [...] Wholsom and cool, and mild, but with black Air [...] Accompanied, with damps and dreadful gloom, [...] Which to his evil Conscience represented [...] All things with double terror: On the ground [...] 850 [...] Outstretcht he lay, on the cold ground, and oft [...] Curs'd his Creation, Death as oft accus'd [...] Of tardie execution, since denounc't [...] The day of his offence. Why comes not Death, [...] Said hee, with one thrice acceptable stroke [...] To end me? Shall Truth fail to keep her word, [...] Justice Divine not hast'n to be just? [...] But Death comes not at call, Justice Divine [...] Mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries. [...] O Woods, O Fountains, Hillocks, Dales and Bowrs, [...] 860 [...] With other echo farr I taught your Shades [...] To answer, and resound farr other Song. [...] Whom thus afflicted when sad Eve beheld, [...] Desolate where she sate, approaching nigh, [...] Soft words to his fierce passion she assay'd: [...] But her with stern regard he thus repell'd. [...] Out of my sight, thou Serpent, that name best [...] Befits thee with him leagu'd, thy self as false [...] And hateful; nothing wants, but that thy shape, [...] Like his, and colour Serpentine may shew [...] 870 [...] Thy inward fraud, to warn all Creatures from thee [...] Henceforth; least that too heav'nly form, pretended [...] To hellish falshood, snare them. But for thee [...] I had persisted happie, had not thy pride [...] And wandring vanitie, when lest was safe, [...] Rejected my forewarning, and disdain'd [...] Not to be trusted, longing to be seen [...] Though by the Devil himself, him overweening [...] To over-reach, but with the Serpent meeting [...] Fool'd and beguil'd, by him thou, I by thee, [...] 880 [...] To trust thee from my side, imagin'd wise, [...] Constant, mature, proof against all assaults, [...] And understood not all was but a shew [...] Rather then solid vertu, all but a Rib [...] Crooked by nature, bent, as now appears, [...] More to the part sinister from me drawn, [...] Well if thrown out, as supernumerarie [...] To my just number found. O why did God, [...] Creator wise, that peopl'd highest Heav'n [...] With Spirits Masculine, create at last [...] 890 [...] This noveltie on Earth, this fair defect [...] Of Nature, and not fill the World at once [...] With Men as Angels without Feminine, [...] Or find some other way to generate [...] Mankind? this mischief had not then befall'n, [...] And more that shall befall, innumerable [...] Disturbances on Earth through <b>Femal</b> snares, [...] And straight conjunction with this Sex: for either [...] He never shall find out fit Mate, but such [...] As some misfortune brings him, or mistake, [...] 900 [...] Or whom he wishes most shall seldom gain [...] Through her perverseness, but shall see her gaind [...] By a farr worse, or if she love, withheld [...] By Parents, or his happiest choice too late [...] Shall meet, alreadie linkt and Wedlock-bound [...] To a fell Adversarie, his hate or shame: [...] Which infinite calamitie shall cause [...] To humane life, and houshold peace confound. [...] He added not, and from her turn'd, but Eve [...] Not so repulst, with Tears that ceas'd not flowing, [...] 910 [...] And tresses all disorderd, at his feet [...] Fell humble, and imbracing them, besaught [...] His peace, and thus proceeded in her plaint. [...] Forsake me not thus, Adam, witness Heav'n [...] What love sincere, and reverence in my heart [...] I beare thee, and unweeting have offended, [...] Unhappilie deceav'd; thy suppliant [...] I beg, and clasp thy knees; bereave me not, [...] Whereon I live, thy gentle looks, thy aid, [...] Thy counsel in this uttermost distress, [...] 920 [...] My onely strength and stay: forlorn of thee, [...] Whither shall I betake me, where subsist? [...] While yet we live, scarse one short hour perhaps, [...] Between us two let there be peace, both joyning, [...] As joyn'd in injuries, one enmitie [...] Against a Foe by doom express assign'd us, [...] That cruel Serpent: On me exercise not [...] Thy hatred for this miserie befall'n, [...] On me already lost, mee then thy self [...] More miserable; both have sin'd, but thou [...] 930 [...] Against God onely, I against God and thee, [...] And to the place of judgement will return, [...] There with my cries importune Heaven, that all [...] The sentence from thy head remov'd may light [...] On me, sole cause to thee of all this woe, [...] Mee mee onely just object of his ire. [...] She ended weeping, and her lowlie plight, [...] Immoveable till peace obtain'd from fault [...] Acknowledg'd and deplor'd, in Adam wraught [...] Commiseration; soon his heart relented [...] 940 [...] Towards her, his life so late and sole delight, [...] Now at his feet submissive in distress, [...] Creature so faire his reconcilement seeking, [...] His counsel whom she had displeas'd, his aide; [...] As one disarm'd, his anger all he lost, [...] And thus with peaceful words uprais'd her soon. [...] Unwarie, and too desirous, as before, [...] So now of what thou knowst not, who desir'st [...] The punishment all on thy self; alas, [...] Beare thine own first, ill able to sustaine [...] 950 [...] His full wrauth whose thou feelst as yet lest part, [...] And my displeasure bearst so ill. If Prayers [...] Could alter high Decrees, I to that place [...] Would speed before thee, and be louder heard, [...] That on my head all might be visited, [...] Thy frailtie and infirmer Sex forgiv'n, [...] To me committed and by me expos'd. [...] But rise, let us no more contend, nor blame [...] Each other, blam'd enough elsewhere, but strive [...] In offices of Love, how we may light'n [...] 960 [...] Each others burden in our share of woe; [...] Since this days Death denounc't, if ought I see, [...] Will prove no sudden, but a slow-pac't evill, [...] A long days dying to augment our paine, [...] And to our Seed (O hapless Seed!) deriv'd. [...] To whom thus Eve, recovering heart, repli'd. [...] Adam, by sad experiment I know [...] How little weight my words with thee can finde, [...] Found so erroneous, thence by just event [...] Found so unfortunate; nevertheless, [...] 970 [...] Restor'd by thee, vile as I am, to place [...] Of new acceptance, hopeful to regaine [...] Thy Love, the sole contentment of my heart, [...] Living or dying from thee I will not hide [...] What thoughts in my unquiet brest are ris'n, [...] Tending to som relief of our extremes, [...] Or end, though sharp and sad, yet tolerable, [...] As in our evils, and of easier choice. [...] If care of our descent perplex us most, [...] Which must be born to certain woe, devourd [...] 980 [...] By Death at last, and miserable it is [...] To be to others cause of misery, [...] Our own begotten, and of our Loines to bring [...] Into this cursed World a woful Race, [...] That after wretched Life must be at last [...] Food for so foule a Monster, in thy power [...] It lies, yet ere Conception to prevent [...] The Race unblest, to being yet unbegot. [...] Childless thou art, Childless remaine: [...] So Death shall be deceav'd his glut, and with us two [...] 990 [...] Be forc'd to satisfie his Rav'nous Maw. [...] But if thou judge it hard and difficult, [...] Conversing, looking, loving, to abstain [...] From Loves due Rites, Nuptial embraces sweet, [...] And with desire to languish without hope, [...] Before the present object languishing [...] With like desire, which would be miserie [...] And torment less then none of what we dread, [...] Then both our selves and Seed at once to free [...] From what we fear for both, let us make short, [...] 1000 [...] Let us seek Death, or hee not found, supply [...] With our own hands his Office on our selves; [...] Why stand we longer shivering under feares, [...] That shew no end but Death, and have the power, [...] Of many wayes to die the shortest choosing, [...] Destruction with destruction to destroy. [...] She ended heer, or vehement despaire [...] Broke off the rest; so much of Death her thoughts [...] Had entertaind, as di'd her Cheeks with pale. [...] But Adam with such counsel nothing sway'd, [...] 1010 [...] To better hopes his more attentive minde [...] Labouring had rais'd, and thus to Eve repli'd. [...] Eve, thy contempt of life and pleasure seems [...] To argue in thee somthing more sublime [...] And excellent then what thy minde contemnes; [...] But self-destruction therefore saught, refutes [...] That excellence thought in thee, and implies, [...] Not thy contempt, but anguish and regret [...] For loss of life and pleasure overlov'd. [...] Or if thou covet death, as utmost end [...] 1020 [...] Of miserie, so thinking to evade [...] The penaltie pronounc't, doubt not but God [...] Hath wiselier arm'd his vengeful ire then so [...] To be forestall'd; much more I fear least Death [...] So snatcht will not exempt us from the paine [...] We are by doom to pay; rather such acts [...] Of contumacie will provoke the highest [...] To make death in us live: Then let us seek [...] Som safer resolution, which methinks [...] I have in view, calling to minde with heed [...] 1030 [...] Part of our Sentence, that thy Seed shall bruise [...] The Serpents head; piteous amends, unless [...] Be meant, whom I conjecture, our grand Foe [...] Satan, who in the Serpent hath contriv'd [...] Against us this deceit: to crush his head [...] Would be revenge indeed; which will be lost [...] By death brought on our selves, or childless days [...] Resolv'd, as thou proposest; so our Foe [...] Shall scape his punishment ordain'd, and wee [...] Instead shall double ours upon our heads. [...] 1040 [...] No more be mention'd then of violence [...] Against our selves, and wilful barrenness, [...] That cuts us off from hope, and savours onely [...] Rancor and pride, impatience and despite, [...] Reluctance against God and his just yoke [...] Laid on our Necks. Remember with what mild [...] And gracious temper he both heard and judg'd [...] Without wrauth or reviling; wee expected [...] Immediate dissolution, which we thought [...] Was meant by Death that day, when lo, to thee [...] 1050 [...] Pains onely in Child-bearing were foretold, [...] And bringing forth, soon recompenc't with joy, [...] Fruit of thy Womb: On mee the Curse aslope [...] Glanc'd on the ground, with labour I must earne [...] My bread; what harm? Idleness had bin worse; [...] My labour will sustain me; and least Cold [...] Or Heat should injure us, his timely care [...] Hath unbesaught provided, and his hands [...] Cloath'd us unworthie, pitying while he judg'd; [...] How much more, if we pray him, will his ear [...] 1060 [...] Be open, and his heart to pitie incline, [...] And teach us further by what means to shun [...] Th' inclement Seasons, Rain, Ice, Hail and Snow, [...] Which now the Skie with various Face begins [...] To shew us in this Mountain, while the Winds [...] Blow moist and keen, shattering the graceful locks [...] Of these fair spreading Trees; which bids us seek [...] Som better shroud, som better warmth to cherish [...] Our Limbs benumm'd, ere this diurnal Starr [...] Leave cold the Night, how we his gather'd beams [...] 1070 [...] Reflected, may with matter sere foment, [...] Or by collision of two bodies grinde [...] The Air attrite to Fire, as late the Clouds [...] Justling or pusht with Winds rude in thir shock [...] Tine the slant Lightning, whose thwart flame driv'n down [...] Kindles the gummie bark of Firr or Pine, [...] And sends a comfortable heat from farr, [...] Which might supplie the Sun: such Fire to use, [...] And what may else be remedie or cure [...] To evils which our own misdeeds have wrought, [...] 1080 [...] Hee will instruct us praying, and of Grace [...] Beseeching him, so as we need not fear [...] To pass commodiously this life, sustain'd [...] By him with many comforts, till we end [...] In dust, our final rest and native home. [...] What better can we do, then to the place [...] Repairing where he judg'd us, prostrate fall [...] Before him reverent, and there confess [...] Humbly our faults, and pardon beg, with tears [...] Watering the ground, and with our sighs the Air [...] 1090 [...] Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign [...] Of sorrow unfeign'd, and humiliation meek.

40|$|Much {{research}} in sexology {{is of the}} verbal-descriptive kind despite the existence of decades of measurements of various kinds. A reasonably comprehensive mathematical/dynamic model does not exist. In this paper a nonlinear differential equation model and its associated catastrophe is shown to model the simplest version of the sexual response of humans; simple {{in the sense that}} it is for males (whose response patterns are simpler than that of <b>femals),</b> that there are no dysfunctions, and that no multiple orgasms are being modeled. Other than these the mathematical model is derived via well-known and non-controversial aspects of sexual orgasm as can be found in the literature. Two different and independent derivations of the equation are given; the equilibriumoscillation model and the slow-fast dual equation model. The associated catastrophe and response surface is related to commonly known facts, and various sexual dysfunctions. Although the model is simple (which is only simple in relation to how complex a total model that captures all aspects of sexuality including various possible dysfunctions could be) it does take into account physical, psychological and cognitive aspects of sex and orgasm. The weakness of the model, as in all mathematical simplifications of the enormous complexity of life and social processes involving volitional and intelligent beings, is that the burden of "explanation " has shifted to the coefficients of the mathematical model. However, this fact also has an advantage or a benefit in that it makes possible a unification of the various measurements involving sexual excitement in terms of the coefficients of the equations modeling the process...|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} study culling patterns in swine breeding herds. Data were obtained from 89 Minnesota swine breeding herds and included 5918 sows and 1324 gilts {{for a total of}} 7242 culled <b>femaled.</b> Each producer was involved for 12 consecutive months. They were asked to record every female that was removed from the herd, the reason for its culling and its parity. The annual culling rate for the sample averaged 50 %, but varied considerably between herds ranging from 15 % to 85 %. Culled females had produced an average of 3. 77 litters. Half of the females culled did not produce more than three litters. Reproductive failure accounted for 32 % of all removals. The average parity of the females culled in that category was only 2. 37 : almost 33 % were gilts. Failure to conceive represented 75 % of all females culled for reproductive failure. Proportionally, culling as a result of anestrus was higher in gilts. It accounted for 33 % of all gilts culled for reproductive failure which was twice as much as for sows. Inadequate performance accounted for 17 % of all removals. These sows had produced an average of 5. 11 litters. These results indicated that few animals were culled on the basis of first litter performance. Old age comprised 14 % of all removals and the average parity at culling for this category was 7. 11. Death accounted for 12 % and the average parity for these females was 3. 40. Locomotor problems and peripartum problems were the cause of 28 % and 23 % of all deaths, respectively.

40|$|This thesis employs interpretive {{research}} via ethnographic fieldwork {{to explore}} the complex relationship between the postmodern self and consumption symbolism. In postmodernity, where society becomes more global but simultaneously decentred, pastiche-like and hyperreal, the self is encountering a number of dilemmas propelled by the looming threat of personal meaninglessness. In order to attain a sense of existence, the self appears to seek the meaningfulness of life from and through symbolic consumption. Indeed, postmodernity is primarily a consumer culture where consumption {{is central to the}} meaningful practice of our everyday life. The postmodern self makes consumption choices not only from the products' utilities but also from their symbolic meanings, the function of which operates in two directions: outward in constructing the social world, social-symbolism; and inward in constructing our self-identity, self-symbolism. To understand these phenomena, ethnographic fieldwork of four distinctive groups - a group of male <b>femaling</b> transgenders, a group of young nouveaux riches, a group of young extremist Buddhists and a group of young provincial women - are conducted in Bangkok, Thailand. Principally, the research explores how the informants employ everyday consumption symbolically in their self-creation processes. It also examines how the informants appropriate symbolic meanings through and from their lived and mediated experiences, and incorporate these meanings into their symbolic self-projects by means of everyday consumption. Moreover, it observes how the informants negotiate their self-social symbolism through the process of self-others identification within their friendship groups. The interpretations unfold a number of surprising outcomes which provide insight into the informants' self-projects and their consumption experiences. To conceptualise the interpretations, a model - Consumption Symbolism and the Harmonising Self - is proposed. </p...|$|R

40|$|Among 126 {{cases of}} chronic {{subdural}} hematoma, 6 cases (4. 8 %) were diagnosed as {{acute subdural hematoma}} in chronic stage. They were 3 males and 3 <b>femals</b> whose age ranged from 46 to 79 years (average 62. 8 years). All of them received major trauma to the head, but surgical treatment was not necessary until a mean period of 22. 7 days, ranging from 17 to 30 days. Acute subdural hematoma in its chronic stage has subdural granulation tissue {{similar to that of}} the outer membrane of chronic subdural hematoma. This membrane was formed in the dural surface of the hematoma and was partially liquefied near the arachnoidal surface, but none of them had a macroscopically well-formed inner membrane. The subdural granulation tissue was of irregular thickness ranging from 1 - 2 mm, and was tightly adhered to the hematoma. Histologically, the granulation tissue consisted mainly of old fibrous connective tissue, having less capillaries than the outer membrane, and with scant blood components and few inflammatory cells. Pigments such as hemosiderin or hematoidin, and macrophages laden with these pigments accumulated in the granulation tissue, while new hemorrhagic foci were rare around the capillaries. The border layer between the subdural granulation tissue and the hematoma was generally irregular and not clearly discriminated, where many fibroblasts with mitotic figures and the macrophages irregularly accumulated. Thus, acute subdural hematoma in chronic stage differed from chronic subdural hematoma, both in its clinical and pathological aspects. The results suggest that the existence of an inner membrane plays an important role in defining the chronicity of subdural hematomas. It is advisable to investigate not only the clinical course, but also the existence of an inner membrane and the histology of the subdural granulation tissue in order to differentiate acute subdural hematoma in chronic stage from chronic subdural hematoma...|$|R
40|$|There {{are a lot}} of {{evidence}} that show hvdrocarbones cause some defect in reproduction and growth of bivalves. Bivalves are filter-feeder, thus accumulate more hydrocarbones in their tissue. In this study adult pearl producing oysters (Pinctada fucata) are used for all experimens. Samples of oysters, water and sediment from four natural beds; Nakhiloo (clean), Hendurabi (semipolluted), Lavan 1 (semipolluted) and Lavan 2 (polluted) were gatherd for 13 succesive months. Temperature, salinity, pH, oxygen and turbidity were recorded in each sampling. Oysters were kept in laboratory for adapation and then their length (DVM) were measured. Hemolymph samples were collected by insuline syring. Sediments and soft tissues of oysters were dissolved in carbon tetrachloride and when heated to extract oil hydrocarbones. UV, GC and IR were used to assay oil hydrocarbones. Accumulation of hydrocabones in soft tissue were as follows : Kakhiloo<Hendurabi< Lavan 1 <Lavan 2 Regarding water, pollution in Lavan was more than Nakhiloo and Hendurabi, however due to water currents and closeness of Lavan 1 and Kakhiloo station to the coast pollution was less than Hendurabi. Results showed that there is not meaningful difference (P< 0. 05) between sexual hormones in males and <b>femals.</b> Concerning progesterone cycle, there are two peak of spawning in oysters, major one in late spring and minor one in mid fall. Little elevation of progesterone start gamete and a lot of elevation release gametes_ Esteradiols gradually increase during gametogenesis and reach to maximum level during vitellogenesis. Testosterone have a synergestic role which esteradiol during vitellogenesis and also is effective in male sexuality. Multi regression test showed that there isn't meaning relationship (P< 0. 05) between hydrocarbones pollution and esteradiols. However in Lavan 2 due to hormone concentration of hydrocarbones had some effect in sexual hormonal cycles. Turbidity was the most effective factor for releasing of progesterone. Progesterone was a stimulating factor for releasing estradiol also release of testosterone was corrolated with oxygen and depth of beds. One way analysis of variance showed that there is not significant relasionship (P< 0. 05) between different factory in stations...|$|R
