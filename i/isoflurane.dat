5|$|Tracheal tubes {{can be used}} {{to ensure}} the {{adequate}} exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide, to deliver oxygen in higher concentrations than found in air, or to administer other gases such as helium, nitric oxide, nitrous oxide, xenon, or certain volatile anesthetic agents such as desflurane, <b>isoflurane,</b> or sevoflurane. They may also be used as a route for administration of certain medications such as bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids, and drugs used in treating cardiac arrest such as atropine, epinephrine, lidocaine and vasopressin.|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{findings}} of these and other studies in the early 1970s, the current consensus is that the use of methoxyflurane should be restricted only to healthy individuals, in situations where it offers specific advantages and even then, only at dosages less than 2.5MAC hours. Partly because of these warnings, but also because of the development of newer volatile anesthetics such as enflurane, <b>isoflurane,</b> desflurane and sevoflurane, the clinical use of methoxyflurane as a general anesthetic in humans was largely abandoned in the mid-1970s.|$|E
25|$|An inhalational {{anaesthetic}} is {{a chemical}} compound possessing general anaesthetic properties {{that can be}} delivered via inhalation. They are administered by anaesthetists (a term which includes anaesthesiologists, nurse anaesthetists, and anaesthesiologist assistants) through an anaesthesia mask, laryngeal mask airway or tracheal tube connected to an anaesthetic vaporiser and an anaesthetic delivery system. Agents of significant contemporary clinical interest include volatile anaesthetic agents such as <b>isoflurane,</b> sevoflurane and desflurane, and anaesthetic gases such as nitrous oxide and xenon.|$|E
25|$|Malignant {{hyperthermia}} is {{a disorder}} {{that can be}} considered a gene-environment interaction. In most people with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility, they have few or no symptoms unless they are exposed to a triggering agent. The most common triggering agents are volatile anesthetic gases, such as halothane, sevoflurane, desflurane, <b>isoflurane,</b> enflurane or the depolarizing muscle relaxants suxamethonium and decamethonium used primarily in general anesthesia. In rare cases, the biological stresses of physical exercise or heat may be the trigger.|$|E
25|$|A {{large number}} of {{pharmaceuticals}} contain halogens, especially fluorine. An estimated one fifth of pharmaceuticals contain fluorine, including several {{of the most widely}} used drugs. Examples include 5-fluorouracil, fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), ciprofloxacin (Cipro), mefloquine, and fluconazole. The beneficial effects arise because the C-F bond is relatively unreactive. Fluorine-substituted ethers are volatile anesthetics, including the commercial products methoxyflurane, enflurane, <b>isoflurane,</b> sevoflurane and desflurane. Fluorocarbon anesthetics reduce the hazard of flammability with diethyl ether and cyclopropane. Perfluorinated alkanes are used as blood substitutes.|$|E
25|$|The {{anaesthetic}} machine (UK English) or anesthesia machine (US English) or Boyle's {{machine is}} used by anaesthesiologists, nurse anaesthetists, and anaesthesiologist assistants to support the administration of anaesthesia. The {{most common type of}} anaesthetic machine in use in the developed world is the continuous-flow anaesthetic machine, which is designed to provide an accurate and continuous supply of medical gases (such as oxygen and nitrous oxide), mixed with an accurate concentration of anaesthetic vapour (such as <b>isoflurane),</b> and deliver this to the patient at a safe pressure and flow. Modern machines incorporate a ventilator, suction unit, and patient monitoring devices.|$|E
25|$|Anesthesia {{of exotic}} animals (guinea pigs, rabbits, birds) is {{challenging}} {{and the higher}} peri-anesthetic mortality in these species compared to dogs and cats, attests to this fact. These animals are challenging to anesthetize {{for a number of}} reasons: very little research has been carried out on safe and effective drug doses for specific species; exotic pets often 'hide' {{the fact that they are}} sick and by the time owners realize how sick the pet is the course of the disease is far advanced; the unique anatomy and physiology of exotic pets poses challenges for anesthetic management. For example, the anatomy of the respiratory system of birds, Guinea pigs, and reptiles makes it difficult to induce and maintain anesthesia solely with inhalation agents such as <b>isoflurane</b> and sevoflurane. Injectable drugs such as sedatives or tranquilizers are often used in these patients to facilitate induction and maintenance of anesthesia.|$|E

2500|$|The carbon-fluorine bond is {{commonly}} found in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals because it is generally metabolically stable and fluorine acts as a bioisostere of the hydrogen atom. [...] An estimated one fifth of pharmaceuticals contain fluorine, including several of the top drugs. Examples include 5-fluorouracil, flunitrazepam (Rohypnol), fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), ciprofloxacin (Cipro), mefloquine, and fluconazole. [...] Fluorine-substituted ethers are volatile anesthetics, including the commercial products methoxyflurane, enflurane, <b>isoflurane,</b> sevoflurane and desflurane. Fluorocarbon anesthetics reduce the hazard of flammability with diethyl ether and cyclopropane. [...] Perfluorinated alkanes are used as blood substitutes.|$|E
2500|$|General {{anesthesia}} {{is commonly}} used in animals for major surgery. Animals are often premedicated intravenously or intramuscularly with a sedative, analgesic, and anticholinergic agent (dogs frequently receive buprenorphine, acepromazine, and glycopyrrolate). The next step is induction, usually with an intravenous drug. [...] Dogs and cats commonly receive thiopental (no longer allowed in the UK), ketamine with diazepam, tiletamine with zolazepam (usually just in cats), and/or propofol. Alfaxalone is a steroid anaesthetic used in many practices in the UK to induce anaesthesia in cats and sometimes dogs. It is similar in physiological effect but different in composition to the now withdrawn Saffan. [...] Horses commonly receive thiopental and guaifenesin. [...] Following induction, the animal is intubated with an endotracheal tube and maintained on a gas anesthetic. [...] The most common gas anesthetics in use in veterinary medicine are <b>isoflurane,</b> enflurane, and halothane, although desflurane and sevoflurane are becoming more popular due to rapid induction and recovery.|$|E
5000|$|Similar to many general anesthetics, {{the exact}} {{mechanism}} of the action has not been clearly delineated. <b>Isoflurane</b> reduces pain sensitivity (analgesia) and relaxes muscles. <b>Isoflurane</b> likely binds to GABA, glutamate and glycine receptors, but has different effects on each receptor. It potentiates glycine receptor activity, which decreases motor function. It inhibits receptor activity in the NMDA glutamate receptor subtypes. <b>Isoflurane</b> inhibits conduction in activated potassium channels. <b>Isoflurane</b> also affects intracellular molecules. It activates calcium ATPase by increasing membrane fluidity [...] It binds to the D subunit of ATP synthase and NADH dehydrogenase.|$|E
50|$|<b>Isoflurane,</b> {{sold under}} the trade name Forane among others, {{is a general}} anesthetic. It {{can be used to}} start or {{maintain}} anesthesia. Often another medication, however, is used to start anesthesia due to airway irritation with <b>isoflurane.</b> It is used by inhalation.|$|E
50|$|Attempts to find anesthetics {{with less}} {{metabolism}} led to halogenated ethers such as enflurane and <b>isoflurane.</b> The incidence of hepatic reactions with these agents is lower. The exact degree of hepatotoxic potential of enflurane is debated, {{although it is}} minimally metabolized. <b>Isoflurane</b> is essentially not metabolized and reports of associated liver injury are quite rare. Small amounts of trifluoroacetic acid can be formed from both halothane and <b>isoflurane</b> metabolism and possibly accounts for cross sensitization of patients between these agents.|$|E
50|$|<b>Isoflurane</b> is {{frequently}} used for veterinary anaesthesia.|$|E
50|$|A {{potential}} limitation {{for this}} drug is that animals {{being used for}} studies are most commonly anesthetized with <b>isoflurane,</b> which {{has been shown to}} be a partial gap junction uncoupler and thus would negate the effects of rotigaptide. However, this effect can be only minor, as one study showed that a low dose of <b>isoflurane</b> was kept continuous over the progression of the study, indicating that the dose was not high enough to uncouple rotigaptide. Therefore, it may be unlikely that <b>isoflurane</b> plays a role in the results presented.|$|E

50|$|General {{anaesthesia}} with <b>isoflurane</b> reduces plasma endocannabinoid AEA concentrations, {{and this}} could be a consequence of stress reduction after loss of consciousness.|$|E
50|$|Concerns exist {{with regard}} to the {{relationship}} between administration of <b>isoflurane</b> and postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD), for which the elderly are especially vulnerable.|$|E
50|$|Desflurane (1,2,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl difluoromethyl ether) is {{a highly}} {{fluorinated}} methyl ethyl ether used for maintenance of general anesthesia. Like halothane, enflurane, and <b>isoflurane,</b> it is a racemic mixture of (R) and (S) optical isomers (enantiomers). Together with sevoflurane, it is gradually replacing <b>isoflurane</b> for human use, except in economically undeveloped areas, where its high cost precludes its use. It has the most rapid onset and offset of the volatile anesthetic drugs used for general anesthesia due to its low solubility in blood.|$|E
50|$|Nitrous oxide, desflurane, and <b>isoflurane</b> {{are most}} the most {{commonly}} used anesthetic gases. They may cause some complications due to their leakage and storage failure.|$|E
50|$|The average {{lifetime}} of <b>isoflurane</b> {{in the atmosphere}} is 3.2 years, its global warming potential is 510 and the yearly emissions add up to 880 tons.|$|E
50|$|An {{endotracheal tube}} is {{inserted}} and secured by the anaesthetist and mechanical ventilation is started. General anaesthesia is maintained with an inhaled volatile anesthetic agent such as <b>isoflurane.</b>|$|E
50|$|It is also {{associated}} with the administration of <b>Isoflurane,</b> which is an inhaled anesthetic. Hydralazine can potentially cause this condition as well, {{as it is a}} direct arteriolar vasodilator.|$|E

5000|$|Agent {{concentration}} measurement: anaesthetic machines {{typically have}} monitors {{to measure the}} percentage of inhalational anaesthetic agents used as well as exhalation concentrations. These monitors include measuring oxygen, carbon dioxide, and inhalational anaesthetics (e.g., nitrous oxide, <b>isoflurane).</b>|$|E
50|$|Following administration, marked {{peripheral}} vasoconstriction and bradycardia are noted. Often {{the dosage}} of induction agents (e.g. propofol) may be drastically reduced, as may the volumes of anasthetic gases (i.e. halothane, <b>isoflurane,</b> sevoflurane) used to maintain general anesthesia.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Structural {{formula of}} <b>isoflurane,</b> a typical {{halogenated}} ether. The C—O—C (carbon-oxygen-carbon) {{in the center}} is the ether group and the Cl (chlorine) and F (fluorine) are the halogen atoms, which have been substituted for all but two H (hydrogen) atoms.|$|E
5000|$|When {{one type}} of anesthesia, propofol, is used and there is natural sleep debt, it dissipates. [...] Specifically, a REM sleep deficit was {{apparent}} after exposure to <b>isoflurane,</b> sevoflurane or halothane and a NREM sleep deficit is seen after halothane.|$|E
50|$|Animal {{studies have}} raised safety {{concerns}} of certain general anesthetics, in particular ketamine and <b>isoflurane</b> in young children. The risk of neurodegeneration was increased in {{combination of these}} agents with nitrous oxide and benzodiazepines such as midazolam. Whether these concerns occur in humans is unclear.|$|E
50|$|Animal studies {{indicate}} that volatile anaesthestics may augment the pathological processes of Alzheimer's Disease by affecting amyloid-beta processing. However, in young healthy mice, the volatile anesthetic <b>isoflurane</b> can also produce long-lasting memory impairment. This adverse effect is preventable by pre-administering the GABA(A)α5 inverse agonist L-655,708.|$|E
50|$|Multiple {{anaesthetics}} {{have been}} found to affect the inhibitory GABAA receptor, including propofol, thiopental and <b>isoflurane.</b> However, xenon and nitrous oxide are thought to have no effect here. Glycine receptors have been suggested as putative target for at least the analgesic effect of inhalational anaesthetics.|$|E
50|$|Clinically, {{enflurane}} {{produces a}} dose-related depression of myocardial contractility with an associated decrease in myocardial oxygen consumption. Between 2% and 5% of the inhaled dose is oxidised in the liver, producing fluoride ions and difluoromethoxy-difluoroacetic acid. This is {{significantly higher than}} the metabolism of its structural isomer <b>isoflurane.</b>|$|E
