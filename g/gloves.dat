5|$|Contemporary body {{piercing}} studios generally take numerous precautions {{to protect the}} health of the person being pierced and the piercer. Piercers are expected to sanitize the location to be pierced as well as their hands, even though they will often wear <b>gloves</b> during the procedure (and in some areas must, as it is prescribed by law). Quite frequently, these <b>gloves</b> will be changed multiple times, often one pair for each step of setup to avoid cross contamination. For example, after a piercer wearing <b>gloves</b> has cleaned the area to be pierced on a client, the piercer may change <b>gloves</b> to avoid recontaminating the area. Wearing sterile <b>gloves</b> is required by law for professional piercing procedures in some areas, such as the states of Florida and South Carolina. Tools and jewellery should be sterilized in autoclaves, and non-autoclavable surfaces should be cleaned with disinfectant agents on a regular basis and between clients.|$|E

5|$|A 2004 review {{reported}} 46% of bites occurring on distal extremities of the limbs, 25% on proximal {{areas of}} limbs (upper arms and thighs), 21% on the trunk, and 7% {{on the head}} or neck. In some cases the same spider bites a victim multiple times. Historically, victims were often bitten on the genitalia, though this phenomenon disappeared as outhouses were superseded by plumbed indoor toilets. Conversely, bites {{on the head and}} neck have increased with use of safety helmets and ear muffs. Precautions to avoid being bitten include wearing <b>gloves</b> and shoes while gardening, not leaving clothes on the floor, and shaking out <b>gloves</b> or shoes before putting them on. Also, children can be educated not to touch spiders.|$|E

40|$|The <b>gloved</b> hand {{is one of}} an {{astronaut}} s primary means of interacting with the environment, and any restrictions imposed by the <b>glove</b> can strongly affect performance during extravehicular activity (EVA). <b>Glove</b> restrictions {{have been the subject}} of study for decades, yet previous studies have generally been unsuccessful in quantifying <b>glove</b> mobility and tactility. Past studies have tended to focus on the dexterity, strength, and functional performance of the <b>gloved</b> hand; this provides only a circumspect analysis of the impact of each type of restriction on the <b>glove</b> s overall capability. The aim of this study was to develop novel capabilities to provide metrics for mobility and tactility that can be used to assess the performance of a <b>glove</b> in a way that could enable designers and engineers to improve their current designs. A series of evaluations were performed to compare unpressurized and pressurized (4. 3 psi) <b>gloved</b> conditions with the ungloved condition. A second series of evaluations were performed with the Thermal Micrometeoroid Garment (TMG) removed. This series of tests provided interesting insight into how much of an effect the TMG has on <b>gloved</b> mobility - in some cases, the presence of the TMG restricted <b>glove</b> mobility as much as pressurization did. Previous hypotheses had assumed that the TMG would have a much lower impact on mobility, but these results suggest that an improvement in the design of the TMG could have a significant impact on <b>glove</b> performance. Tactility testing illustrated the effect of <b>glove</b> pressurization, provided insight into the design of hardware that interfaces with the <b>glove,</b> and highlighted areas of concern. The metrics developed in this study served to benchmark the Phase VI EVA <b>glove</b> and to develop requirements for the next-generation <b>glove</b> for the Constellation program...|$|R

40|$|Structural {{modeling}} of the EVA <b>glove</b> indicates that {{flexibility in the}} metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint can be improved by selectively lowering the elasticity of the <b>glove</b> fabric. Two strategies are used to accomplish this. One method uses coil springs {{on the back of}} the <b>glove</b> to carry the tension in the <b>glove</b> skin due to pressurization. These springs carry the loads normally borne by the <b>glove</b> fabric, but are more easily deformed. An active system was also designed for the same purpose and uses gas filled bladders attached to the back of the EVA <b>glove</b> that change the dimensions of the back of the <b>glove</b> and allow the <b>glove</b> to bend at the MCP joint, thus providing greater flexibility at this joint. A threshold control scheme was devised to control the action of the joint actuators. Input to the controller was provided by thin resistive pressure sensors placed between the hand and the pressurized <b>glove.</b> The pressure sensors consist of a layer of polyester film that has a thin layer of ink screened on the surface. The resistivity of the ink is pressure dependent, so an extremely thin pressure sensor can be fabricated by covering the ink patch with another layer of polyester film and measuring the changing resistance of the ink with a bridge circuit. In order to sense the force between the hand and the <b>glove</b> at the MCP joint, a sensor was placed on the palmar face of the middle finger. The resultant signal was used by the controller to decide whether to fill or exhaust the bladder actuators {{on the back of the}} <b>glove.</b> The information from the sensor can also be used to evaluate the effectiveness of a given control scheme or <b>glove</b> design since the magnitude of the measured pressures gives some idea of the torque required to bend a <b>glove</b> finger at the MCP joint. Tests of this actuator, sensor, and control system were conducted in an 57. 2 kPa <b>glove</b> box by performing a series of 90 degree finger bends with a <b>glove</b> without an MCP joint assembly, a <b>glove</b> with the coil spring assembly, and with the four fingered actuated <b>glove.</b> The tests of these three <b>glove</b> designs confirm the validity of the model...|$|R
