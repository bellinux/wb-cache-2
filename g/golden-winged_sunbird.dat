50|$|Sometimes, when {{a female}} <b>golden-winged</b> <b>sunbird</b> intrudes on a bronzy sunbird's territory, it {{performs}} a begging display by quivering its wings and spreading its tail. This causes the bronzy sunbird {{to tolerate the}} foraging of the <b>golden-winged</b> <b>sunbird</b> in its territory. Female sunbirds spread their feet apart on the stalk of a Leonotis plant and turn their bodies 90Â° to the stalk and fan their tail feathers to varying degrees.|$|E
50|$|The <b>golden-winged</b> <b>sunbird</b> (Drepanorhynchus reichenowi) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Nectariniidae. Three {{subspecies}} are recognised.It is found in Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.|$|E
50|$|German naturalist Gustav Fischer {{described}} the <b>golden-winged</b> <b>sunbird</b> in 1884, its species name honouring Anton Reichenow. It {{is classified as}} the only species in the genus Drepanorhynchus or sometimes in the genus Nectarinia.|$|E
50|$|Territorial birds, <b>golden-winged</b> <b>sunbirds</b> defend {{patches of}} Leonotis nepetifolia flowers outside the {{breeding}} season in Kenya. This species flowers in July when little {{else is in}} flower. The concept of economic defendability, in which the defence of a resource has costs (such as energy expenditure and risk of injury) and benefits (priority access to the resource), explains the territorial behavior that <b>golden-winged</b> <b>sunbirds</b> exhibit.|$|R
50|$|Usually territories involve only {{a single}} {{resident}} individual. Occasionally, a female can coexist with a male on a large territory and participate in its defence. Such sharing may relate to a complex prolonged pattern of pair formation. Feeding territories may be defended by all age and sex classes of the <b>golden-winged</b> <b>sunbirds,</b> including juveniles. The birds defend their territories both intra-specifically and inter-specifically against all sunbird species in the area. The success of the defence depends {{in part on the}} dominance relationships of the intruding individual, where persistent individuals of larger bird species such as the bronzy sunbird may feed successfully. Territory sizes vary greatly, ranging from 6.7 to 2300 m2, but each territory contains about the same number of flowers.|$|R
50|$|The <b>golden-winged</b> <b>sunbird</b> {{has a large}} {{range and}} its total {{population}} has not been estimated; however, it is not thought to be endangered and it is evaluated as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} double-collared sunbird, or <b>golden-winged</b> <b>sunbird,</b> (Cinnyris reichenowi), is {{a species}} of bird in the Nectariniidae family. It is found in Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Kenya, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Sudan, and Uganda.|$|E
50|$|The <b>golden-winged</b> <b>sunbird</b> {{is found}} in Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda, between altitudes of 1170 and 2300 m. It {{is found in}} forest verges and clearings, in {{cultivated}} areas, bamboo forest and tall grassland. The species is locally nomadic, following food supply.|$|E
50|$|Golden-winged {{sunbirds}} {{consume the}} nectar from flowers of the mint Leonotis nepetifolia flowers as their main food source, {{but they also}} feed infrequently on other flower species: Aloe graminicola and Leonotis mollissima during the breeding season, and also Crotalaria species including C. agatiflora, Erythrina abyssinica, Fuchsia species, Ipomoea batatas, Jacaranda mimosifolia, Phragmanthera dschallensis and other pea species. The <b>golden-winged</b> <b>sunbird</b> also eats insects such as beetles, flies, ants, bees and wasps and various larvae.|$|E
50|$|Studies of the <b>golden-winged</b> <b>sunbird</b> have {{validated}} {{the concept}} of economic defendability. Comparing the energetic costs a sunbird expends in a day to the extra nectar gained by defending a territory, researchers showed that birds only became territorial when they were making a net energetic profit. When resources are at low density, the gains from excluding others may {{not be sufficient to}} pay for the cost of territorial defense. In contrast, when resource availability is high, there may be so many intruders that the defender would have no time {{to make use of the}} resources made available by defense.|$|E
50|$|The male <b>golden-winged</b> <b>sunbird</b> {{is about}} 9 in (23 cm) {{long and the}} female is about 6 in (15 cm) long, the male having long central tail {{feathers}}. Yellow-edged feathers in the wings and tail are key identification pointers in all plumages of both the male and female. Body feathers of the male in breeding condition are a conspicuous metallic reddish-copper colour, which are mostly replaced by dull-black feathers in the non-breeding condition. The underparts of the male are brownish-black. The female is olive above and yellowish below. Immature are similar to females, except their underparts are darker.|$|E
