500|$|Staci Krause of IGN {{had mixed}} {{perspectives}} on the episode's story arcs, comparing the advanced development in the personal story lines {{to the introduction of}} disappointing medical cases. She described the story line involving Yang and Burke's silent relationship as [...] "finally showing resolution, taking pleasure to the next level", adding: [...] "It was shocking to see Cristina be the one to break, but even more shocking was Burke's two-word response: marry me. I'm really not sure why Cristina didn't just say yes, since two minutes before had said she was in <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> haul. It seems like they are dragging this out for the sake of dragging it out." [...] Bailey's evolution in the episode, mainly her interactions with four competing attending physicians, were described as [...] "a reminder of why they called her the Nazi, something that was easy to forget with recent events." ...|$|E
500|$|In December 2012, Peer Schneider of IGN {{published}} an article explaining the fate and some production details of the proposed John Woo-directed Metroid movie with {{an exclusive interview with}} one of the former producers of the Metroid movie, Brad Foxhoven. The movie with John Woo as director was first pitched in 2004 and initially had Nintendo's full support. Foxhoven stated in the IGN interview, [...] "Nintendo was quite supportive of the idea, as they were all fans of John's previous films" [...] and that production studio Tiger Hill was [...] "in <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> haul" [...] and had started a three-year development period. The Metroid movie was originally set for a 2006 release but slipped because Tiger Hill was spending most of the development time attempting to cope with Nintendo's restrictions on the Metroid franchise. [...] The reason for Nintendo's restrictions was the past critical and commercial failure of the Super Mario Bros. movie which, according to IGN, [...] "had left an indelible impression on Nintendo and how it would approach future licensing deals with Hollywood." [...] One writer that was brought in to write a script for the Metroid movie, among [...] "several writers", was David Greenwalt of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel and Grimm fame, the furthest that the production process reached was [...] "a treatment for a live action film that John would possibly direct." ...|$|E

2500|$|One Life Stand {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 79, based on 34 reviews. The Observers Gareth Grundy {{wrote that the}} album [...] "not only sees [...] back on track, it's also their best work, paring down those past excesses and unifying them into an extraordinarily lovely whole." [...] Huw Jones of Slant Magazine described it as [...] "a smooth, sleek, and splendid pop record" [...] where [...] "ach individual track sticks to its own tone and theme, while the group gracefully sashays through several shifts in tone and tempo." [...] Heather Phares of AllMusic noted that [...] "their sensitive side dominates One Life Stand—they don't sound ready for the floor, they sound ready to settle down. Even the most energetic songs feel tempered compared to the neon energy of Made in the Dark and The Warnings hits." [...] She added that [...] "hough this emotional nakedness is an unusual move after Made in the Dark pushed Hot Chip {{to a new level}} of attention and acclaim, it also shows they're in <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> haul." [...] Nick Annan from Clash deemed it [...] "different to Made In The Dark but a more cohesive and more heartfelt effort too. One Life Stand sees Hot Chip let us into their hearts as well as their thoughts." [...] Benjamin Boles of Now commented that [...] "t's not that they've completely reinvented their sound as much as they've simply focused and polished it up. The real shift is in their attitude, which allows them to embrace earnestness and write some straightforward love songs. It's a strategy that could have backfired, but instead it has inspired their strongest and most consistent album so far." [...] Uncuts Andrew Mueller believed that the album [...] "contains little trace of the discordant outings or rather rigidly utilitarian dance grooves they seemed to feel obliged to deploy on previous albums. This is an album that sees Hot Chip freeing themselves of the surly bonds of their more orthodox dance and electronic influences and settling comfortably into the orbit of New Order and Pet Shop Boys." ...|$|E

During that year, he won the Mexican National Light Heavyweight Championship, defeating Pierroth, Jr. to win the title.

In 1998 he was regimmicked as El Alebrije, a more comedic ring character, teamed up with Cuije, a Mini-Estrella version of the El Alebrije character. The two would feud with Monsther and Chucky {{for a long period of}} time. He also worked as a road agent behind the scenes of AAA.

40|$|This study {{examined}} lip and tongue kinematics in stop and fricative consonants of different durations. Native speakers of Japanese served as subjects.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the issue of {{identifying}} the effect of ideology and subjectivity in Organizations. It builds upon 5 real cases which we studied in various firms over the years, tracing the effect of ideology. A model is introduced, suggesting to look at the effect of ideology on cognition (the strategic vision), organization and action (structure and processes becoming routines), emotions and motivation (culture and identity). Each of the examples presented illustrates the effect of ideology on one or several of these three dimensions. The paper further argues that organizations have to generate production for themselves which are instrumental to fill out their statutory tasks. These productions (representations, organizational constructs, culture, etc.) are found to reflect the ideology which prevails in the organization, in turn reinforcing it. Ideology exist in organizations. Who paid <b>for</b> <b>it?</b> Who said that ideology should appear, develop and deploy? Is this really part of the objectives of the organization?
