6000|$|<b>DEAR</b> <b>MINISTER</b> OF THE FREE KIRK AT PENICUIK, - For O, man, I cannae {{read your}} name! - That I {{have been so}} long in {{answering}} your delightful letter sits on my conscience badly.

Yesterday I despatched thirty-five belated letters: conceive the state of my conscience, above all as the Sins of Omission (see boyhood's guide, the Shorter Catechism) are in my view the only serious ones; I call it my view, but it cannot have escaped you that it was also Christ's.

The special minister appointed {{to oversee the}} prosecution of subversives looked at {{the young man in}} front of him. “Are you an anarchist? ” he asked. José Domingo Gómez Rojas answered: “I do not have, <b>dear</b> <b>Minister,</b> sufficient moral discipline to assume that title, which I will never merit. ” This was not the answer, nor (one could imagine) the tone, Astorquiza desired: “You, young man, appear at these proceedings involved {{in one of the most}} serious crimes that can be committed in a Republic: a crime against the internal security of the State. ” To this Gómez Rojas responded with an indifferent shrug of his shoulders and a dismissive remark: “Let’s not be so theatrical, <b>dear</b> <b>Minister.</b> ” Astorquiza, enraged, issued his order: “Take this insolent Students, Anarquists and Categories of Persecution 23 boy away immediately, put him in manacles in solitary confinement and eight days of bread and water only. ” 1 Astorquiza’s anger cost Gómez Rojas his life.

60|$|If {{you desire}} the {{clearing}} of the minor, {{look into the}} jails in England, and into the alehouses of the same; and I trow you will find those that plead for the Spirit of prayer in the jail, and them that look after the form of men's inventions only in the alehouse. It is evident also by the silencing of God's <b>dear</b> <b>ministers,</b> though never so powerfully enabled by the Spirit of prayer, if they in conscience cannot admit of that form of Common Prayer. If this be not an exalting the Common Prayer Book above either praying by the Spirit, or preaching the Word, I have taken my mark amiss. It is not pleasant for me to dwell on this. The Lord in mercy turn {{the hearts of the}} people to seek more after the Spirit of prayer; and in the strength of that, to pour out their souls before the Lord.

40|$|<b>Dear</b> <b>Minister,</b> I {{am writing}} to you on behalf of Citywide to express our dismay at the {{proposed}} budget cuts and other changes to Community Employment announced in Budget 2012. As you are aware the special ring fenced FAS Community Employment projects underpin the National Rehab Strategy and have been a mainstay in delivering rehabilitation in local communities since 1995. They allow drug users, who {{are engaged in a}} rehabilitation process, the opportunity to access supported training, education, relapse supports, care planning, progression and employment. They account for almost the entire day-programme element of drug rehabilitation provision in the State. The measures proposed in this budget will have a devastating impact on these projects and on the implementation of the national drugs strategy. They will spell the death knell of many local drug projects and vital community drug rehabilitation services. We cannot put it any clearer than this. Projects will close {{as a result of these}} measures. The proposed measure to reduce by 66...|$|E

Thank {{you very much}} for inviting me to give this keynote this morning in these challenging circumstances that we face. Let me also say that it is rare that I have had a Minister of Education with whom I have agreed so wholeheartedly as in this particular case. I think the message here is one, which is actually very pertinent to what I have to say. I would also like to say that this university, I understand, is meant to be a model for the practices of higher educational institutions in this country. I think this particular conference is a model {{for the rest of the}} world as well. I have not been to a conference where I have seen the combination of academics, employers and those people who are trying to bring the two together – practitioners in that sense, but in a conference of this size and with so many guest speakers. I thank {{you very much for}} inviting me along for this conversation. The message I have to give today is one, which I hope, will set out the challenge and I shall overemphasize it, that means that I shall be polemical and I hope it will provoke some discussion...|$|E

It was no less a person than Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, whose great personal favourite he was, who called him to take up this post after going through due process. By 1973, he had also been elected a member of the All India Congress Committee. In 1977, on obtaining a degree from Kirori Mal College, Delhi University, he moved to Madras to practice in labour law. When the Congress was re-elected in 1980, Rangarajan was asked by his very <b>dear</b> friend, soon-to-be-Prime <b>Minister</b> Rajiv Gandhi, to play an active role in politics. He contested and won the 1984 elections from Salem Lok Sabha constituency.|$|R

[...] Charles Henry had a spiritual experience at the age of eighteen through the letters of his sister and the reading of John Nelson Darby's Operations of the Spirit. In 1838 he went to work in a business house in Limerick, Ireland. The following year he went to Dublin and identified himself with the Plymouth Brethren. About 1874, Mackintosh reflecting on his course wrote, [...] "I had not the honour of being among the first of those who planted their feet on the blessed ground occupied by Brethren. I left the Establishment about the year 1839, and took my place at the table in Dublin, where <b>dear</b> Bellett was <b>ministering</b> with great acceptance ... As a young man I, of course, walked in retirement, having no thought of coming forward in public ministry of any kind ... Indeed, I may say that nothing but the most solemn sense of responsibility could ever have induced me to stand up in public." ...|$|R
