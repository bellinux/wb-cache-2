5|$|In {{the form}} {{trivalent}} chromium, Cr(III), or Cr3+, chromium was <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> essential nutrient {{in the late}} 1950s and later accepted as a trace element for its roles in the action of insulin, a hormone critical to the metabolism and storage of carbohydrate, fat and protein. The precise mechanism of its actions in the body, however, have not been fully defined, leaving in question whether chromium is essential for healthy people.|$|E

Two fossil species have been described in the Sitta genus: S. cuvieri Gervais, 1852 and S. senogalliensis Portis, 1888, but probably not belong to nuthatches.|$|E
5|$|All of M-63's routing {{was part}} of US33 before that highway's {{truncation}} south of Niles in 1986. A previous designation of M-63 was used farther north in Lake and Osceola counties from 1919 until 1961. Since the current designation was created, the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) has worked on reconfiguring parts of the roadway {{in the early part}} of the 21st century. The bridge M-63 uses to cross the St. Joseph River, the Blossomland Bridge, has been <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> historic structure using a rare design. The bridge itself dates back to the late 1940s.|$|E

5|$|Although the UK Government has set {{a target}} of 10% for the {{proportion}} of the UK's electricity produced by renewable energy by 2010, wind power in the UK {{has a long history of}} controversy, with an average approval rate for planning permission of only 28% for onshore wind farms. Scout Moor was first <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> excellent site for a wind farm in 2001. Peel Holdings commissioned market research consultants MORI to undertake a telephone poll over seventeen days in 2002, soliciting the opinions of residents in Bury, Rossendale and Rochdale about wind farms in general and Scout Moor in particular. The results showed that 88% of respondents thought wind farms were a very or fairly good idea, 72% thought the Scout Moor project was a very or fairly good idea, and 63% stated wind power as the preferred energy source.|$|E
5|$|American {{astronomer}} Edwin Hubble categorized M87 {{as one of}} {{the brighter}} globular nebulae, as it lacked any spiral structure, but appeared to belong to the same family of non-galactic nebulae as spiral nebulae. In 1926 he produced a new categorization of nebulae, with M87 being classified as a type of elliptical extra-galactic nebula with no apparent elongation (class E0). By 1931, Hubble had identified M87 {{as a member of the}} Virgo Cluster, for which he gave a provisional estimate of 1.8 million parsecs from Earth. At the time it was the only known example of an elliptical nebula for which individual stars could be resolved. M87 continued to be called an extragalactic nebula for many years thereafter, but by 1956 it had been <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> E0-type galaxy.|$|E

Though she lives in Paris, Cardinale is fiercely outspoken about being <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> Italian. She also has expressed some pride in being born in an Italian community in Tunisia, and celebrates Tunisia's Arabic culture– as evidenced by her book Ma Tunisie and {{by the fact that}} she appeared as herself in the Tunisian film Un été à La Goulette ("A Summer in La Goulette"). She has been a UNESCO goodwill ambassador for the Defence of Women's Rights since March 2000, and was a goodwill ambassador for the UNESCO World Water Day for 2006.|$|E
5|$|In 1898, the British naturalist Henry Ogg Forbes {{described}} a second species of Necropsar, N. leguati, {{based on a}} skin in the World Museum Liverpool, specimen D.1792, which was labelled as coming from Madagascar. He suggested that this was actually the bird mentioned by Tafforet, instead of N. rodericanus from mainland Rodrigues. Walter Rothschild, however, believed the Liverpool specimen to be an albinistic specimen of a Necropsar species supposedly from Mauritius. In 1953, Japanese writer Masauji Hachisuka suggested that N. leguati was distinct enough to warrant its own genus, Orphanopsar. In a 2005 DNA analysis, the specimen was eventually <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> albinistic specimen of the grey trembler (Cinclocerthia gutturalis) from Martinique.|$|E
5|$|It {{was first}} {{published}} in Germany and France in 1950, and after being rejected by several publishers, {{was first published}} in the United Kingdom in 1952. The first American edition, published in 1952 under the title , was positively reviewed. The book was successful in France, Germany, and the United States, but in the United Kingdom it failed to attract an audience and by 1953 was out of print. Its most noteworthy success was in Japan, where it received critical acclaim and sold more than 100,000 copies in its first edition. In Japan, Anne Frank quickly was <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> important cultural figure who represented the destruction of youth during the war.|$|E

5|$|The latest {{database}} of translations of the Elegy, amongst which the above version figures, records over 260 in some forty languages. As {{well as the}} principal European languages {{and some of the}} minor such as Welsh, Breton and Icelandic, they include several in Asian languages as well. Through the medium of these, Romanticism was brought to the host literatures in Europe. In Asia they provided an alternative to tradition-bound native approaches and were <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> avenue to modernism. Study of the translations, and especially those produced soon after the poem was written, has highlighted some of the difficulties that the text presents. These include ambiguities of word order and the fact that certain languages do not allow the understated way in which Gray indicates that the poem is a personalised statement in the final line of the first stanza, “And leaves the world to darkness and to me”.|$|E
5|$|The lower molar of Indraloris {{is known}} from four specimens. GSI D237, an m1 {{in a piece}} of jaw, is the holotype of I.himalayensis. YPM 13802, the holotype of I.lulli (= I.himalayensis) was {{originally}} <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> m1, but Flynn and Morgan suggested in 2005 that it may be an m2 instead. YGSP 44443, the holotype of I.kamlialensis, is either m1 or m2, but more likely the former. Part of the trigonid is broken off. YGSP 32152, a very worn m1 {{in a piece of}} jaw, represents the unnamed large Indraloris. Vasishat suggested in 1985 that these teeth were instead p4s corresponding to molars referable to Sivaladapis, but this hypothesis has been disproven by the discovery of p4s referable to Indraloris.|$|E
5|$|The {{second of}} four notable {{tropical}} cyclones in the Western Pacific in early November1992, Forrest was first <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> area of disturbed weather over the western Caroline Islands on November9. Moving generally west-northwest, convection {{associated with the}} system steadily organized and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) subsequently issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on November10. Development into a tropical depression was not anticipated until the system cleared the Philippines; however, organization was slower than forecast and a second TCFA was issued late on November11. Once west of Palawan Island and over the South China Sea on November12, the convective structure rapidly consolidated. The disturbance was designated Tropical Depression 30W at 12:00UTC, when it was 940km (585mi) east-southeast of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) followed suit six hours later.|$|E

5|$|The {{woolly mammoth}} (Mammuthus primigenius) is an extinct species of mammoth that lived during the Pleistocene epoch, {{and was one}} of the last in a line of mammoth species, {{beginning}} with Mammuthus subplanifrons in the early Pliocene. The woolly mammoth diverged from the steppe mammoth about 400,000 years ago in East Asia. Its closest extant relative is the Asian elephant. The appearance and behaviour of this species are among the best studied of any prehistoric animal because of the discovery of frozen carcasses in Siberia and Alaska, as well as skeletons, teeth, stomach contents, dung, and depiction from life in prehistoric cave paintings. Mammoth remains had long been known in Asia before they became known to Europeans in the 17th century. The origin of these remains was long a matter of debate, and often explained as being remains of legendary creatures. The mammoth was <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> extinct species of elephant by Georges Cuvier in 1796.|$|E
5|$|While small, the Church of the Holy Mother of God {{is notable}} for its unusual {{architectural}} style, in particular for its high narthex {{flanked by two}} sharp-pointed towers. These features, which hint at Hungarian or Transylvanian influences, are highly atypical for medieval Bulgarian church architecture. The church is richly decorated on the inside, {{with as many as}} eleven frescoes of historical figures. One of these portraits, captioned as a despot, is variously <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> eponymous son of Bulgarian tsar Michael Shishman or as an undocumented son of co-tsar Michael Asen IV; earlier speculation that the image depicted Serbian noble Mihailo Anđelović or Michael Shishman himself have since fallen out of favor with art historians. In addition to these early portraits, the interior walls of the church were painted with canonical murals, which can stylistically be assigned to the 14th–15th century. The church was reconstructed in 1958 and has been under Serbian state protection since 1982.|$|E
5|$|Scholars of Old Norse mythology now {{focus on}} {{references}} to elves in Old Norse poetry, particularly the Elder Edda. The only character explicitly <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> elf in classical Eddaic poetry, if any, is Völundr, {{the protagonist of}} Völundarkviða. However, elves are frequently mentioned in the alliterating phrase Æsir ok Álfar ('Æsir and elves') and its variants. This was clearly a well established poetic formula, indicating a strong tradition of associating elves with the group of gods known as the Æsir, or even suggesting that the elves and Æsir were one and the same. The pairing is paralleled in the Old English poem Wið færstice and in the Germanic personal name system; moreover, in Skaldic verse the word elf {{is used in the}} same way as words for gods. Sigvatr Þórðarson’s skaldic travelogue Austrfaravísur, composed around 1020, mentions an álfablót (‘elves' sacrifice’) in Edskogen in what is now southern Sweden. There does not seem to have been any clear-cut distinction between humans and gods; like the Æsir, then, elves were presumably thought of as being human(-like) and existing in opposition to the giants. Many commentators have also (or instead) argued for conceptual overlap between elves and dwarves in Old Norse mythology, which may fit with trends in the medieval German evidence.|$|E
