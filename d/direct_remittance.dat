Obligations of the Federal government, arising under the Survivor Benefit Plan, to survivors are paid from the Military Retirement Fund. United States Code Title 10, Section 1452 requires persons participating in the Plan, and not entitled to retired pay, must deposit in the U. S. Treasury vice the Military Retirement Fund the premium payments that would otherwise have been deducted from their retired pay for that period. The member is required to pay premiums due to the Plan through a process called <b>direct</b> <b>remittance.</b> This thesis determined the annual amount of direct remittances arising from the Survivor Benefit Plan, and analyzed the financial loss to the Military Retirement Fund due to the diversion of these funds to the U. S. Treasury. An understanding of this process and the unique problems that direct remittances from the Survivor Benefit Plan represent provides a valuable contribution to understanding the accounting and valuation process of the Military Retirement Fund.

40|$|The {{dominant}} {{discourse in}} Tanzania is that home ownership {{is the most}} sustainable strategy towards solving housing problem. As a result, housing policy orientation has been towards promotion of home ownership through a land-housing linkage strategy that manifests in improvement of access to identified categories of people usually classified on resources constrained criterion. Rental housing has been observed from this study to have suffered a number of setbacks in history. Public rental housing featured prominently in the first Five-Year Development Plans (1964 - 69). In subsequent years and particularly with the demise of socialistic form of governance in the post 1992 era, attention has moved away from public rental housing to home-ownership strategies. Private rental housing {{on the other hand}} has never featured in the national policies until mid- 2000 s. This study investigates the future of public housing in Tanzania from a housing management perspective. Through interviews and direct observation in two case studies at Keko and Ubungo National Housing Corporation (NHC), it has been demonstrated that public housing in Tanzania has suffered neglect in terms of repair and maintenance for many years. The main reason as claimed was poor rent collection and low rent levels. The general finding of the study is public housing in Tanzania has been greatly influenced by employment policy changes. Public housing as construed by main actors in the study area is for public servants and largely government employees. Rental payment to the Public Housing Organization was usually through <b>direct</b> <b>remittance</b> from employees salaries by their employers. The Government in 2001 was the largest rent defaulter to NHC. Through a study on housing careers in Dar es Salaam, the study demonstrates the relationship that exists between landlords and tenants. With growing demand for accommodation, renta lsector {{has been shown to be}} the strategy that meets needs for newcomers to towns. The study also demonstrates how policy implications are influencing means of solving housing problem. The study urges public housing authorities to exploit all opportunities and in particular the social capital embedded in their tenants to help solve some of their maintenance problems.

40|$|In {{the present}} study I analyze the {{relationship}} between migrant remittances, development and political transformation across 46 municipios located {{in the state of}} Guanajuato, Mexico. Using Guanajuato as a case study, my research addresses fundamental questions regarding the impact of remittances in Mexico: How, if at all, do migrants influence economic development and political change across the state? How does the impact of <b>direct</b> <b>remittances</b> to individual families compare to the impact of remittances channeled through collective structures? The crux of this study lies at the intersection of these inquires, and although my analysis is limited in scope, the results outlined in Chapter 3, 4, 5 and 6 point to one overarching theme: Remittances alone do not drive long-term development. Rather, in the long run meaningful remittance-led economic development and democratic change—measured by gains in health care, education, economic growth, and civic participation and transparency—require a deep and authentic partnership between economic actors, members of civic society and local government. As the results outlined in this study reveal, the program 3 x 1 para migrantes has the potential to underpin this type of relationship. Fulbright ProgramSociologyDoctoralUniversity of New Mexico.

Secondly, we attempt to investigate the relationship of FCIs with economic growth and finally we study the impact of FCIs on unemployment, poverty and income inequality. FCIs {{in this study are}} combination of foreign <b>direct</b> investment, <b>remittances,</b> foreign aid and external debt. Using data from 1973 - 2008 for Pakistan we found that growth is key determinant of FCIs both in aggregated and disaggregated forms. Moreover, FCIs have positive impact on economic growth in Pakistan. We also found that FCIs do help in reducing unemployment. Impact on poverty and inequality, however, was found to be insignificant. Results suggest that though FCI is beneficial for growth, the spillovers of the growth are not reaching the poor segment of the society. Policy makers should therefore focus on utilizing these foreign resources, especially remittance inflows, to strengthen domestic financial sector, reduce poverty and inequality.

Variants of a dictator game in a lab-in-the-field experiment with Filipino migrants in Rome are used to examine remitting behavior under varying degrees of commitment. These range from the soft commitment of simply labeling remittances as being for education, to the hard commitment of having funds directly paid to a school and the student’s educational performance monitored. We find that the introduction of simple labeling for education raises remittances by more than 15 %. Adding the ability to directly send this funding to the school adds only a further 2. 2 %. We randomly vary the information asymmetry between migrants and their most closely connected household, but find no {{significant change in the}} remittance response to these forms of commitment as information varies. Behavior in these games is then shown to be predictive of take-up of a new financial product called EduPay, designed to allow migrants to directly pay remittances to schools in the Philippines.

40|$|In today’s globalized world, labor {{migration}} {{is an important}} source of remittances and other transfers of migrants to their homeland, which expands the country’s capacity {{for the development of the}} national economy and financial markets in particular. Due to the transformational changes in the domestic economy in the 1990 th many citizens became migrant workers and their remittances now exceed foreign direct investment in the country. Until 2013 remittances in Ukraine were mainly coming through the banking system, but recently the dominant role is being played by international payment systems, as well as quite a significant amount is incoming by informal channels. In order to increase the role of formal financial market infrastructure in providing capital inflows of migrants first of all the cost of transfer must be reduced. Unfortunately, the capital of Ukrainian migrant workers is directed primarily at the consumer market, real estate market, as well as the shadow economy. The investment focus has actually only investments in real estate and private business (own entrepreneurship). Migrant workers invest in those areas of the economy that are the least compliant to investment and bank lending standards. At the same time, migrants almost do not use capital to purchase shares and bonds, but use it actively to invest in such financial market tool as deposits. Regardless of significant efforts by the Government of Ukraine to attract funds in the state budget by selling different variations of bonds a notable success in modern conditions was not achieved. Nowadays remittances have enabled us to soften financial instability, balance of payments deficit; to strengthen the exchange rate of the national currency and they also have the positive impact on international credit ratings of Ukraine. However, the effectiveness of government policy to <b>direct</b> <b>remittances</b> into investment is very low, and it actualizes the search of effective tools to realize financial capital potential for the development of the national economy. Solving the problem of efficient use of migrants’ capital requires reforms of the tax area, government financial policy, regulation of entrepreneurship etc. Creating relevant socio-economic and legal conditions in Ukraine will allow us to direct the potential of migrants’ capital at the domestic financial market and the development of the national economy in terms of transformation and globalization. ...|$|R

There were 3 directions: from north to northeast, from inland areas to the coastal big cities, and from the south to southeast Asia; the southward and northward labor migrations being roughly equal. There was a short-term, periodic migration of farm workers and the like along with long-term or permanent abode-oriented (immigration) type of migration. Agriculture and mining in the northeastern region, industry in the coastal region, and commerce and sugar or rubber plantations in southeast Asia, were popular. In each of these cases, the provincial, affiliated relations of the migrants’ native places were maintained without interruption and, based {{on the development of}} various organizations mediating the migration, labor migration was made easy. However, in terms of proficiency of the labor force and the relatively low correlation with industry should be noted. With regard to the transfer of funds, there existed locally a country-wide remittance network of Shanxi bankers and the Remitting Houses <b>directing</b> <b>remittances</b> of Chinese merchants residing abroad in southeast Asia, which formed an international remittance network. The latter possessed several remittance routes based on Singapore and Hong Kong along with diverse exchange remittance functions. The client in southeast Asia pays into the Remitting Houses with local currency. It is then remitted to the agent in Hong Kong by Hong Kong dollars, exchanged for the currency of the People's Republic of China, and sent to agents in Fujian and Guangdong from where it is submitted to the remittee through the agent at home. This route was the established mode of the Remitting Houses, but even within this process there existed such forms as cancellation by countervailing by exchange trading in Singapore and Hong Kong, the abbreviation of cash remittance through merchandise transactions, and countervailing through trade connections by forming directly a settling connection with Guangdong and Amoy where remittances were concentrated. Selection was made among these, depending upon the price of merchandise and exchange rate in the market, and involved a close relationship between the southern Chinese economy and the money markets in Hong Kong and Singapore.

The analysis shows that institutional progress (EU integration, transition, governance) had a negative relationship to economic growth in SEE during the crisis period. It concludes that the variable impact of the global crisis on the countries of the region can be explained mainly by their different degrees of integration into the EU and global economy. Institutional reforms that were introduced during the boom period only made countries more internationally integrated and therefore more vulnerable to the impact of the global economic crisis and the more recent crisis of the euro zone.
