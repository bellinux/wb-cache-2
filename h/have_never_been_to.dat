500|$|Corridor X locally {{corresponds}} to the M-1 motorway (E75), which is the longest Macedonian highway. It also {{corresponds to}} the Tabanovce-Gevgelija railway. Corridor VIII, less developed, {{corresponds to the}} M-4 motorway and the Kičevo-Beljakovce railway. Skopje is not quite on the Corridor X and the M-1 does not pass on the city territory. Thus the junction between the M-1 and M-4 is located some [...] east, close to the airport. Although Skopje is geographically close to other major cities, movement of people and goods is not optimised, especially with Albania. This is mainly due to poor infrastructure. As a result, 61.8% of Skopjans <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>to</b> Tirana, while only 6.7% <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>to</b> Thessaloniki and 0% to Sofia. Furthermore, 26% of Thessalonians, 33% of Sofians and 37% of Tiranans <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>to</b> Skopje.|$|E
500|$|Overall, the Clippers have {{qualified}} for the post-season twelve times; most recently in the 2015–16 season. They passed {{the first round of}} the playoffs only five times (1975–76, 2005–06, 2011–12, 2013-14 and 2014-15). Additionally, the Clippers have never won league or Conference titles, let alone play in either title game in their 45-year history they <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>to</b> a Western Conference Finals, and the 30-year drought between winning a playoffs round is the longest in league history. They also have only eleven seasons with a winning percentage of [...]500 or better, and as a result, in their April 17, 2000 issue, the Sports Illustrated had three Clippers fans on the cover that stated [...] "The worst franchise in sports history". However, with the additions of Blake Griffin and Chris Paul, they made steady progress as a title contender in recent years. They won their first division title in the 2012-13 season, their 43rd year in the league, and repeated the following year. Chris Paul was traded to the Houston Rockets for eight players and a 2018 draft pick, after the 2017 season.|$|E

50|$|It {{has been}} shown that {{children}} with a higher risk of disability are far more likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> denied a chance to go to school. In Bangladesh, Bhutan and Iraq, children with mental impairments <b>were</b> most likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> denied this right.

2500|$|One {{theory of}} déjà vu {{attributes}} {{the feeling of}} having previously seen or experienced something that is currently being seen or experienced to that of having dreamt about a similar situation or place and then forgetting about it until {{one seems to be}} mysteriously reminded of the situation or the place while awake. The spontaneity of these types of déjà vu [...] "moments" [...] can catch many people off-guard, especially when they get the sensation from visiting a specific place they <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>to</b> before, {{to the point where they}} are in a temporary state of shock and disbelief.|$|E
2500|$|During an August 7, 2008, Rules Committee hearing after Daly had {{presented}} his resolution {{to turn the}} San Francisco Zoo into a rescue facility {{and when he was}} out of the room, a student from Lowell High School who had waited two hours for her chance to speak in support of the zoo, began to cry at the podium, because she, like the other speakers, was only allowed one minute to speak. [...] Normally at Board of Supervisors hearings, speakers have 23 minutes to speak, but time is limited by the discretion of the chair often to shorter periods of time, especially if there are a large number of speakers. [...] This was the second time the item had been heard in committee, and Chris Daly chose to limit public comment to one minute, so that another item regarding black flight from the City could be heard at that same hearing. Carl Friedman, the Director of the San Francisco Department of Animal Care and Control, said, [...] "There were a lot of young people there who <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>to</b> a government meeting.
