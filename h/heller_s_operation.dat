40|$|The master thesis "Physical model {{study on}} impacts of {{landslide}} generated wave action on embankment dams" {{has been written}} {{in collaboration with the}} Department of Hydraulic and Environmental Engineering at NTNU and the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE). The thesis focuses on studying the effects of landslide generated waves on embankment dams in order to estimate safe freeboards. A landslide falling into a reservoir produces impulsive waves than can have catastrophic consequences to the reservoir sidewalls, the dam body and, in case of overtopping, endanger human activities downstream of the dam. Therefore, the investigation of landslide hazard and risk on reservoir banks is of the utmost importance. The tests were conducted at the scaled model of the Viddal reservoir (Norway) and slide velocity, wave height from 10 stations, overtopping height on the dam crest and overtopping volume have been collected. In total 17 tests were conducted varying the following parameters: slide volume (2, 4 and 6 blocks), freeboard (30 mm and 80 mm) and dam slope (1 : 1. 6, 1 : 2 and 1 : 2. 4); in addition for the two last tests the dam roughness was varied by gluing stones on the upstream dam slope. The impacts of these parameters on the run-up height and the overtopping volume have been studied; moreover, the processes of wave propagation and run-up have been discussed. The run-up height and the overtopping volume monitored during the tests have then been compared with the results calculated with the <b>Heller</b> <b>s</b> numerical method. The calculation method uses 15 governing parameters to compute the overtopping volume and the run-up height caused by subaerial landslide generated waves. The parameters can easily be measured in the model. Moreover, the method enables to calculate the desired results for both 2 D and 3 D reservoir geometry. The collected results show a strong correlation between the overtopping volume and the slide volume. It was also noticed the great influence of the freeboard on the overtopping size. Even though only two tests were performed, the impact of the upstream dam slope roughness was found to be significant. On the other hand, the influence of the dam slope is minor, causing only slight changes in the overtopping volume. The results obtained using the <b>Heller</b> <b>s</b> method show large discrepancies between observed and simulated data. The main reason is the method assumption of an idealized reservoir geometry which strongly differ from the model shape. It is thus concluded that the <b>Heller</b> <b>s</b> method cannot be applied to the Viddal reservoir and reservoirs with similar geometry, in order to determine a safe freeboard...|$|R

40|$|Extensive {{analysis}} of flat-plate radiative panels operation using average hourly weather data for a maritime climate region was performed. The panels are integrated {{in the space}} ventilation system with air-cooling {{by means of a}} cold-water coil. Their primary function is to prepare sufficient quantity of cold water, integrating radiative and convective cooling, that is collected in the cold-water tank during the nighttime operation. That cold water is used for cooling of the air during daytime. By small modification during daytime, solar panels could be turned into collectors and used to produce the hot water that is collected in a separate tank. A simulation model for the parametric {{analysis of}} the system in summer operating conditions and influence of its components on the system 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>operation</b> was developed.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to analyze and improve the {{transient}} stability of an industrial {{combined heat and power}} (CHP) system in a high-tech science park in Taiwan. The CHP system installed two 161 [*]kV/ 161 [*]kV high-impendence transformers to connect with Taipower System (TPS) for both decreasing the short-circuit fault current and increasing the fault critical clearing time. The transient stabilities of three types of operation modes in CHP units, 3 G 1 S, 2 G 1 S, and 1 G 1 S, are analyzed. Under the 3 G 1 <b>S</b> <b>operation</b> mode, the system frequency is immediately restored to 60 [*]Hz after tie line tripping with the TPS.

40|$|Many physicists, {{following}} Einstein, {{believe that}} the ultimate aim of theoretical physics {{is to find a}} unified theory of all interactions which would not depend on any free dimensionless constant, i. e., a dimensionless constant that is only empirically determinable. We do not know if such a theory exists. Moreover, if it exists, {{there seems to be no}} reason for it to be comprehensible for the human mind. On the other hand, as pointed out in Wigner's famous paper, human mathematics is unbelievably successful in natural science. This seeming paradox may be mitigated by assuming that the mathematical structure of physical reality has many `layers'. As time goes by, physicists discover new theories that correspond to the physical reality on the deeper and deeper level. In this essay, I will take a narrow approach and discuss the mathematical structure behind a single physical phenomenon - gravitational interaction between two bodies. The main aim of this essay is to put some recent developments of this topic in a broader context. For the author it is an exercise - to investigate history of his scientific topic in depth.

40|$|This paper {{details the}} {{implementation}} of adaptive pricing rules for a typical autonomous microgrid. The proposed rules aim at generating competitive prices based on monitoring the microgrid 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>operation</b> conditions, thus maximising the profit from selling electricity to the utility grid throughout the microgrid 2 ̆ 7 s lifetime. A decision tree based linear programming and fuzzy system are developed to generate the proposed rules. Microgrid 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>operation</b> conditions such as electricity demand, generation price and amount of generation are considered in the generated pricing rules. To simulate the behaviour of electronic competition, we have implemented a Multi-Agent System (MAS) to represent the performance of two competitive sellers and one buyer under uniform and discriminatory pricing rules. As a case study, our proposed pricing rules are tested on the power grid of the Joondalup campus of Edith Cowan University in Western Australia. Simulation studies for 30 -minutes operation intervals for the developed virtual market pool with the adaptive microgird pricing strategies have recorded beneficiary sale prices with a reasonable number of electricity trade participations...|$|R
