50|$|The Barrett M90 is {{not meant}} to be a shoulder-fired weapon. Upon setup when {{preparing}} to fire the M90, it is first set up by folding down the attached bipod on the weapon and set on whatever space is being used to fire the weapon. The gun is first inspected {{to see if there is}} any debris that might cause the weapon to malfunction. Being a bolt-action rifle, there is typically little cause for error, whereas a semi-automatic rifle could jam or the round might have problems ejecting after firing. After the gun is set up in the desired <b>firing</b> <b>space,</b> the five-round magazine is loaded and the gun is ready to be fired after proper safety precautions are followed. The gun is rested on the bipod with the user holding the rifle’s handle firmly to prevent the gun from sliding back. The design that has gone into the M90 allows it to be fired in this manner without being pressed against the shoulder. The gun is able to reduce recoil through the muzzle brakes, and bipod usage. If the Barrett M90 did not have any muzzle brakes then the recoil of the gun would be considerably larger and would need a different design incorporating the shoulder being pressed to the gun.|$|E

50|$|For example, Honda VFR1200F engine {{basically}} is a transversely mounted 76° V4 with a 360° shared-crank-pin crankshaft, but the conrod orientation {{is an unusual}} front-rear-rear-front (as opposed to the normal fore-aft-fore-aft) with much wider bore spacing (distance between cylinder centers) on the front bank than on the rear, which results in significantly reduced rocking couples {{at the expense of}} wider engine width. Furthermore, the shared crank pin is split and has 28° phase offset, resulting in 256°-104°-256°-104° <b>firing</b> <b>spacing,</b> which is irregular within a 360° crankshaft rotation but evenly distributed from one rotation to another. This compares to a 90° V4 with 180° crankshaft (e.g. Honda RC36 engine) that has 180°-270°-180°-90° <b>firing</b> <b>spaced</b> unevenly within 360 degrees and within 720 degrees of crankshaft rotation.|$|R

40|$|It is {{demonstrated}} that local columnar firings of neocortex, as modeled by a Statistical Mechanics of Neocortical Interactions (SMNI), supports multiple firing regions of multiple oscillatory processing, at frequencies consistent with observed regional electroencephalography (EEG). Direct calculations of the Euler-Lagrange (EL) equations which {{are derived from}} functional variation of the SMNI probability distribution, giving most likely states of the system, are performed for three prototypical cases, predominately excitatory columnar firings, predominately inhibitory columnar firings, and in between balanced columnar firings, with and without a centering mechanism (based on observed changes in stochastic background of presynaptic interactions) which pulls more stable states into the physical firings ranges. These calculations are repeated for the visual neocortex, which has twice as many neurons/minicolumn as other neocortical regions.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to design and produce a gas and wood fired kilns with waste pots and potsherds that are as efficient as electricity and gas operated kilns which are built using conventional refractory bricks. Waste pots and potsherds were collected from two different pot producing communities, that is, Ojah in Akoko Edo and Imiegba in Etsako Central Local Government Ares of Edo State. To determine the suitability of the sample pots and potsherds collected for the construction of the kilns, the following tests were carried out: shrinkage, porosity and insulating tests. Two kilns were designed and constructed, a gas and wood fired kilns. The <b>firing</b> <b>space</b> and the outer wall of the gas kiln were designed to be circular with one burner port using only potsherd and mortar without using whole pots. The wood kiln was designed to have circular internal firing chamber, two fire boxes and a chimney. The kilns were subjected to series of gloss firing with wood and gas as sources of fuel and the maturing temperatures were recorded. The efficiency of the kilns constructed revealed that they were capable of firing to temperature above 1200 °C that was originally planned for it to be attained coupled with uniform heat distribution experienced without any indication of cold spot. These kilns are capable of sustaining the deficiency arising from lack of imported kilns {{that could be used to}} accomplish finished ceramic productions as it is being currently encountered in Nigerian tertiary institutions and cottage level industries. </p...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the first effort {{to explore the}} spatial distributions of the burning rates in group fires consisting {{of a large number}} of fire points, by analyzing burn-out time data from experimental square fire arrays ranging from 3 3 to 15 15. A new concept termed fire layer is introduced and defined to char-acterize the spatial locations of fire points by which the complex spatial variations of burning rates, under different conditions, are analyzed and physically interpreted. Analysis shows that the fire layer burning rates vary from outer to inner in definite nonlinear modes. This indicates that the two fire interaction effects, heat feedback enhancement and air supply restriction, involve distinct spatial fluctuations in fire arrays. The spatial fluctuations of the two interaction effects are significantly affected by the two major parameters, <b>fire</b> <b>spacing</b> and <b>fire</b> array size. Definite spatial regions and parameter ranges for the spatial fluctuations and high competitions of the two interaction effects are clearly distinguished. It is demon-strated that the average burning rates of all fire layers involve consistent variations versus <b>fire</b> <b>spacing</b> or <b>fire</b> array size, especially with high comparability to the entire fire array. It is found that by varying <b>fire</b> <b>spacing,</b> the average burning rates for all fire layers vary linearly versus the fire area ratio, within the same ranges as the entire fire array, while there exist different fluctuation modes of fire layer burning rates wit...|$|R

40|$|The {{scientific}} {{construction of}} risk is usually {{based on the}} probability of an event occurring in a specific location from a specific hazard. Hazardous waste transport {{is an example of}} a risk source that is fixed in neither time nor space, with materials traveling through the landscape. Residents living along fixed transportation routes likely to experience an increase in the amount and potency of hazardous materials traveling through their communities draw on distant places and spaces in order to define the risk they face as they try to make absent places and materials present. However, because those places and spaces are distant and absent, regulatory officials can resist their inclusion by arguing that only what is on site matters. This site of struggle over sources and construction of risks can best be understood through Law and Mol's spatiality of <b>fire</b> <b>space.</b> Using two North American case studies, this paper draws on the concepts of <b>fire</b> <b>space</b> and mobilities to explain the nature of the risk that mobile materials pose, including the disconnect between citizens' objections to increased hazardous materials transport and the environmental review and regulatory processes meant to prevent catastrophes from occurring...|$|R

50|$|There {{are three}} main types of {{parallel}} twins: 360°, 180° & 270°. Secondary imbalance {{is the strongest}} on a parallel twin with a 360° crankshaft (that otherwise {{has the advantage of}} 13. an evenly <b>spaced</b> <b>firing,</b> and lack of 4. & 6. imbalances), which moves two pistons together. A parallel twin with a 180° crankshaft (that has the disadvantage of 13. uneven <b>firing</b> <b>spacing</b> and strong 4., 6., 14. & 16. imbalance) produces the vibration a half as strong and twice as frequent. The 270° crank, first used on a Yamaha TRX850, gives a firing pattern more regular than a 180° crank, but less regular than a 360° crank. A 270° crank gives optimum secondary engine balance for a parallel twin, and its exhaust note and power delivery resembles those of a 90° V-twin.|$|R

The combustor concept employs centrifugal forces combined with a staged combustion process to achieve high carbon conversion efficiencies and low nitrogen oxides generation. Along with the necessary fuel storage and delivery, heat recovery, and control equipment, the system includes pollution control devices to meet targeted values of SO{sub 2 } and particulate emissions. In general, the system is designed to match the reliability, safety, turndown, and ignition performance of gas or oil- fired systems.
