5|$|Manta is {{a flying}} roller coaster, which simulates the {{sensation}} of flight. It is designed to resemble the way rays—mantas in particular—appear to fly through seawater. <b>Guests</b> <b>are</b> initially seated upright on the trains in one of eight rows that hold four passengers each, accommodating up to 32 riders. Manta operates with three trains. Before departure, mechanisms in the station raise the cars up to the track, such that the riders' spines are parallel to the track. <b>Guests</b> <b>are</b> secured in their seats using a locking lap bar, a vest-like harness, and flaps at the riders' ankles to hold their feet in place.|$|E
5|$|Only church {{officials}} and their <b>guests</b> <b>are</b> permitted to enter. The CAB {{has been used}} for meetings between church leaders and political and community leaders.|$|E

50|$|<b>Guests</b> <b>were</b> {{admitted}} {{in groups of}} 30 into one of three Weyland Industries Briefing Rooms. The <b>guests</b> <b>were</b> asked to stand by a weapon which determined their teams. Half of the group would be infected humans, with the other half being normal, uninfected humans. After watching a small preshow, <b>guests</b> <b>were</b> told the rules {{and how to use}} their weapons. The group would then be moved from the Briefing Room, down the Ice Tunnel to Antarctica where the Aliens and Predators would await. This was the final room before the main arena. Within this room <b>guests</b> <b>were</b> told that the situation past this point was volatile.|$|R
5000|$|Once Innoventions was {{refurbished}} and remodeled {{into both}} Super Hero HQ (upper level) and Star Wars Launch Bay (lower level), <b>guests</b> <b>were</b> {{allowed to enter}} the building from the first floor again and were {{given the opportunity to}} enter the worlds from both the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the Star Wars universe in November 2015. In the Super Hero HQ location, <b>guests</b> <b>were</b> able to meet Captain America, Thor, and Spider-Man. <b>Guests</b> <b>were</b> also able to embody Iron Man in The Iron Man Experience, which had guests partake in a simulator that enabled them to fly. <b>Guests</b> <b>were</b> also able to purchase Marvel merchandise.|$|R

5|$|Various wedding <b>guests</b> <b>are</b> {{depicted}} in the scene. Shiva's attendant ganas enjoy the festivities; playing drums or dancing. The vahanas (vehicles) of the couple, Shiva's bull Nandi and Parvati's lion, are sometimes pictured in the scene. In vertical panel depictions, the celestial <b>guests</b> <b>are</b> often shown flying over Shiva and Parvati. While the gods are pictured flying on their respective vahanas (e.g. Indra on his elephant, Agni on a ram) and with their consorts; semi-divine beings like Vidyadharas fly without vehicles. An anachronism found in a few Kalyanasundara scenes {{is the presence of}} the yet-unborn children of Shiva and Parvati, Ganesha and Kartikkeya. Examples of this anachronism are found at the Rameshvara Cave of Ellora, and in a 9th-century sculpture from Uttar Pradesh now housed in Los Angeles County Museum of Art.|$|E

5|$|Various {{types of}} pancake {{machines}} exist, {{such as those}} that run pancake batter through a heated conveyor inside of a box unit, and those that automatically drop pancake batter onto a flattop grill. Some pancake machines, such as one developed by Crepe-Coer, cook both sides of a pancake simultaneously. Semi-automatic pancake machines also exist, which require some human interaction to function, such as the pouring of batter. Commercial pancake machines may be used in the foodservice industry, in cafeterias and by restaurants, and can serve to reduce the waste of stale pancake batter. Some hotels have pancake machines that <b>guests</b> <b>are</b> allowed to operate. They are also used in other environments in a self-service manner, such as in upscale airport lounges and hotels.|$|E
5|$|Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey {{features}} a RoboCoaster G2 ride system provided by Dynamic Structures, KUKA and RoboCoaster. The first generation RoboCoaster system featured KUKA robotic arm technology anchored to a stationary platform, while the second-generation G2 system mounted the arms on a busbar track. The system was first publicly disclosed at the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA) Trade Show in 2003. At {{around the same}} time, rumors began circulating {{about the possibility of}} Islands of Adventure adding a Van Helsing-themed ride using this technology. These plans were later scrapped with Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey ultimately using the same technology and opening on the same plot of land proposed for the Van Helsing ride. The ride's seats are mounted on robotic arms which are in turn mounted on a track. This allows the arms to travel through the attraction while performing their movements in synchronization with the ride's show elements (animated props, projection surfaces, etc.). This concept first appeared in the 2004 International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA) Trade Show. The disadvantage of this intricate machinery is that if the ride breaks down, some <b>guests</b> <b>are</b> stranded in uncomfortable positions, such as being tilted backwards in dark enclosed spaces.|$|E

5|$|The {{most notable}} {{of the many}} rooms are the state apartments. These were laid out from the 16th century onwards, and were {{enhanced}} {{in the style of}} those at Versailles during the 18th century. In the 19th century and again during the late 20th century, large-scale restoration of the state rooms consolidated the 18th-century style which prevails today. Designed as an enfilade and a ceremonial route to the throne room, the processional route begins with an external horseshoe-shaped staircase which leads from the court of honour to the open gallery known as the Gallery of Hercules. From here guests enter the Mirror Gallery, a long hall inspired by the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles. This gallery leads to the first of the state rooms, the Officer's Room, where <b>guests</b> <b>are</b> greeted by court officials before an audience with the prince in the Throne Room. From the Officer's Hall the enfilade continues to the Blue Room. This large drawing room, decorated with blue brocade, is hung with Grimaldi family portraits and has chandeliers of Murano glass. The following room, the largest of the state apartments, is the Throne Room. Its ceiling and frescoes were executed by Orazio de Ferrari and depict the surrender of Alexander the Great. The throne, in the Empire style, is positioned on a dais, beneath a red silk canopy of estate surmounted by a gilt crown. The floors are of Carrara marble. All state ceremonies have been held in this room since the 16th century.|$|E
