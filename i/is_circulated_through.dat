5|$|The lophophore and mantle are {{the only}} {{surfaces}} that absorb oxygen and eliminate carbon dioxide. Oxygen seems to be distributed by the fluid of the coelom, which <b>is</b> <b>circulated</b> <b>through</b> the mantle and driven either by contractions of {{the lining of the}} coelom or by beating of its cilia. In some species oxygen is partly carried by the respiratory pigment hemerythrin, which is transported in coelomocyte cells.The maximum oxygen consumption of brachiopods is low, and their minimum requirement is not measurable.|$|E

25|$|The surface {{condenser}} is a {{shell and tube}} heat exchanger in which cooling water <b>is</b> <b>circulated</b> <b>through</b> the tubes. The exhaust steam from the low-pressure turbine enters the shell, where it is cooled and converted to condensate (water) by flowing over the tubes {{as shown in the}} adjacent diagram. Such condensers use steam ejectors or rotary motor-driven exhausts for continuous removal of air and gases from the steam side to maintain vacuum.|$|E

25|$|Heat is {{transferred}} either by conduction or convection. When water is heated, kinetic energy {{is transferred}} by conduction to water molecules throughout the medium. These molecules spread their thermal energy by conduction and occupy more space than the cold slow moving molecules above them. The {{distribution of energy}} from the rising hot water to the sinking cold water contributes to the convection process. Heat is transferred from the absorber plates of the collector in the fluid by conduction. The collector fluid <b>is</b> <b>circulated</b> <b>through</b> the carrier pipes to the heat transfer vault. Inside the vault, heat is transferred throughout the medium through convection.|$|E
25|$|If the PTCS cannot keep up {{with the}} heat load, an External Active Thermal Control System (EATCS) {{maintains}} the temperature. The EATCS consists of an internal, non-toxic, water coolant loop used to cool and dehumidify the atmosphere, which transfers collected heat into an external liquid ammonia loop that can withstand the much lower temperature of space, and <b>is</b> <b>circulated</b> <b>through</b> radiators to remove the heat. The EATCS provides cooling for all the US pressurised modules, including Kibō and Columbus, as well as the main power distribution electronics of the S0, S1 and P1 trusses. It can reject up to 70kW. This is much more than the 14kW of the Early External Active Thermal Control System (EEATCS) via the Early Ammonia Servicer (EAS), which was launched on STS-105 and installed onto the P6 Truss.|$|E
25|$|In the circulatory system, hemolymph, or insect blood, {{is used to}} {{circulate}} heat in a form of thermoregulation, where muscles contraction produces heat, which is transferred {{to the rest of}} the body when conditions are unfavorable. In lepidopteran species, hemolymph <b>is</b> <b>circulated</b> <b>through</b> the veins in the wings by some form of pulsating organ, either by the heart or by the intake of air into the trachea. Air is taken in through spiracles along the sides of the abdomen and thorax supplying the trachea with oxygen as it goes through the lepidopteran's respiratory system. There are three different tracheae supplying oxygen diffusing oxygen throughout the species body: The dorsal, ventral, and visceral. The dorsal tracheae supply oxygen to the dorsal musculature and vessels, while the ventral tracheae supply the ventral musculature and nerve cord, and the visceral tracheae supply the guts, fat bodies, and gonads.|$|E

25|$|Cryoablation: Cryoablation is a {{technique}} used to destroy tissue using cold temperature. The tumor is not removed and the destroyed cancer is left to be reabsorbed by the body. Initial results in properly selected patients with unresectable liver tumors are equivalent to those of resection. Cryosurgery involves the placement of a stainless steel probe {{into the center of}} the tumor. Liquid nitrogen <b>is</b> <b>circulated</b> <b>through</b> the end of this device. The tumor and a half inch margin of normal liver are frozen to -190nbsp&°C for 15 minutes, which is lethal to all tissues. The area is thawed for 10 minutes and then re-frozen to -190nbsp&°C for another 15 minutes. After the tumor has thawed, the probe is removed, bleeding is controlled, and the procedure is complete. The patient will spend the first post-operative night in the intensive care unit and typically is discharged in 3 – 5 days. Proper selection of patients and attention to detail in performing the cryosurgical procedure are mandatory in order to achieve good results and outcomes. Frequently, cryosurgery is used in conjunction with liver resection as some of the tumors are removed while others are treated with cryosurgery.|$|E

2500|$|Earth-fill dams, {{also called}} earthen dams, rolled-earth dams or simply earth dams, are {{constructed}} {{as a simple}} embankment of well compacted earth. A [...] rolled-earth dam is entirely constructed of one type of material but may contain a drain layer to collect seep water. A zoned-earth dam has distinct parts or zones of dissimilar material, typically a locally plentiful shell with a watertight clay core. Modern zoned-earth embankments employ filter and drain zones to collect and remove seep water and preserve {{the integrity of the}} downstream shell zone. An outdated method of zoned earth dam construction utilized a hydraulic fill to produce a watertight core. Rolled-earth dams may also employ a watertight facing or core {{in the manner of a}} rock-fill dam.
