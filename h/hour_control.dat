40|$|Introduction The sleep {{inducing}} {{effects of}} alcohol {{as well as}} the increase in sleep propensity and sleepiness after sleep loss have been linked to the adenosinergic system in the brain.

Thus, we examined in humans whether performance degradations resulting from sleep loss and alcohol consumption are related.

When wild mushrooms are consumed, it may cause clinical spectrum of conditions from allergic gastroenteritis to lethal liver necrosis. In this study we aimed to evaluate the demographic, clinical and laboratory features of 37 patients admitted to our emergency department due to suspicion of mushroom poisoning. Material and methods: Adult patients admitted to the emergency department due to mushroom poisoning on October the 29 th, 2006 {{were included in the}} study. Clinical and laboratory findings of all cases were recorded. Discharged patients after initial evaluation were invited for the control examination. Results: Thirty-seven patients were evaluated as poisoning. Twenty-seven (72. 9 %) of the patients were female. Mean age of the patients was 36. 32 15. 6 years.

The oocytes were fixed and stained with aceto orcein to evaluate the nuclear maturation. After the maturation period, the remaining oocytes of the Control group, Roscovitine, and Butyrolactone I were fertilized in vitro. Embryo development was assessed by the cleavage rate (D 3) and blastocysts formation (D 7). The Butyrolactone I group had similar rates of germinal vesical stage oocytes during blockage, and Metaphase 2 after maturation, comparing to Control group at 0 hour and Control group, respectively. On the other hand, the Roscovitine group had lower rates of vesical stage oocytes during blockage, and Metaphase 2 after maturation comparing to Control groups. After in vitro fertilization, higher rates of cleavage were observed in Control and Butyrolactone I groups. For the blastocyst formation rate, the Control group showed better results than Roscovitine group. In summary, Butyrolactone I group had similar results to the Control group, and for this reason, is suitable for pre-maturation of bovine oocytes using FCS.

Intervention clinics used the on-site test conducted by primary care nurses, with results and treatment available within an <b>hour.</b> <b>Control</b> clinics sent blood samples to the provincial laboratory, with results returned 2 weeks later. Results: Of 7134 women seeking antenatal care with available test results, 793 (11. 1 %) tested positive for syphilis.

Improving building energy management with advanced integrated building control provides a tool to coordinate and optimize control of multiple indoor parameters by considering their interconnected effects on building energy consumption and comfort. A building integrated optimization requires an approach to calculate building energy consumption, operate in real time, optimize building control parameters, and be able to modify systems operations or schedules in response to environmental or demand response signals inputs. The integrated optimization has significant effects on reductions in energy use and energy costs, reductions in peak load, and improvement of indoor environment quality without replacing the existing equipment. Most of previous research in integrated building control just focused on optimization of specific zone or some of the possible parameters. They also applied their optimization for the current hour without considering its effect on future-hours. The main goal of this research is to develop an advanced building operation optimization tool for integrated control of lighting, shade, ventilation and heating and cooling systems for whole buildings to reduce building energy consumption, operation cost, and peak load while satisfying occupancy comfort. Also, this optimization tool is capable of coordinating integrated control and demand response by real-time modification of time-of-use prices that are received from utilities. In addition, it applies multi-hour optimization by optimizing several hours simultaneously and considering effects of current <b>hour</b> <b>control</b> parameters on future hour energy consumption. As a first step, integrated optimization is investigated based on a developed and validated RC-network model of a typical small office building.

Intact cells or groups of ciliated cells were found in scanning EM micrographs of mucus from MB-treated palates. This was associated with increased matrix metalloproteinase (MMP- 9) activity in epithelial tissue and mucus. We suggest that the loss of ciliated cells as a result of MMP- 9 activation prevented full recovery of MCT after MB 10 - 1 M. The mechanism of action may be on epithelial cell-cell or cell-matrix attachments leading to cell loss and a disruption of MCT. Further studies are warranted to determine whether this is an inflammatory mediated response or the result of a direct action on epithelial cells and what role this mechanism may play in the progression to chronic airway diseases with impaired mucociliary clearance...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{identify}} the {{mechanism by which}} PEDF can inhibit VEGF- induced angiogenesis. Methods: Retinal microvascular endothelial cells (MEC) were isolated from bovine eyes. Cultures were treated with 100 ng/ml VEGF, 200 ng/ml PEDF {{or a combination of}} VEGF and PEDF for 48 <b>hours.</b> <b>Control</b> cultures were maintained in the absence of added growth factor. Proliferation was quantified using the crystal violet assay, migration was assessed following scrape wounding and the degree of tubule formation was measured in a Matrigel matrix. Western blotting was undertaken on Triton-soluble and Triton-insoluble fractions of cell proteins to examine the cleavage and translocation of the VEGF receptor- 1 (VEGFR 1). Results: VEGF increased MEC proliferation by 150...|$|R
