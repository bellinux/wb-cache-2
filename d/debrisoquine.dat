Hydroxylation phenotyping was performed on 50 normal volunteers.

40|$|Considerable unexplained intersubject {{variability}} in the <b>debrisoquine</b> metabolic ratio (urinary debrisoquine/ 4 -hydroxydebrisoquine) exists within individual CYP 2 D 6 genotypes.

Thirteen healthy young volunteers, nine CYP 2 D 6 * 1 homozygotes [extensive metabolizers (EMs) ] and four CYP 2 D 6 * 4 homozygotes [poor metabolizers (PMs) ] took 12. 8 mg of <b>debrisoquine</b> hemisulfate by mouth and collected 0 - to 8 - and 8 - to 24 -h urines, which were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS) before and after treatment with beta-glucuronidase. Authentic 3, 4 -dehydrodebrisoquine was synthesized and characterized by GCMS, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and (1) H NMR. 3, 4 -Dehydrodebrisoquine is a novel metabolite of <b>debrisoquine</b> excreted variably in 0 - to 24 -h urine, both in EMs (3. 1 - 27. 6 % of dose) and PMs (0 - 2. 1 % of dose). This metabolite is produced from 4 -hydroxydebrisoquine in vitro by human and rat liver microsomes. A previously unstudied CYP 2 D 6 * 1 homozygote was administered 10. 2 mg of 4 -hydroxydebrisoquine orally and also excreted 3, 4 -dehydrodebrisoquine. EMs excreted 6 -hydroxydebrisoquine (0 - 4. 8 %) and 8 -hydroxydebrisoquine (0 - 1. 3 %), but these phenolic metabolites were not detected in PM urine. <b>Debrisoquine</b> and 4 -hydroxydebrisoquine glucuronides were excreted in a highly genotype-dependent manner. A microsomal activity that probably does not involve cytochrome P 450 participates in the further metabolism of 4 -hydroxydebrisoquine, which we speculate may also lead {{to the formation of}} 1 - and 3 -hydroxydebrisoquine and their ring-opened products.

Hydroxylation phenotyping was performed on 50 normal volunteers. A standard oral dose was given and plasma and urinary perhexiline, 4 -monohydroxyperhexiline (MI metabolite), and 4 'monohydroxyperhexiline (MIII metabolite) was measured. The 24 -hour plasma perhexiline concentration, the 24 -hour plasma MI metabolite concentration, and 12 to 24 -hour urinary MI metabolite excretion were clearly bimodal, suggesting the existence of a polymorphism for perhexiline hydroxylation. Poor metabolisers represent 6 % of the population studied. Known poor metabolisers of <b>debrisoquine</b> are also poor metabolisers of perhexiline, while known extensive metabolisers of <b>debrisoquine</b> are also extensive metabolisers of perhexiline, indicating that in white British subjects the hydroxylation polymorphism is under identical genetic control for both compounds. The poor metaboliser sub-group exhibited the highest plasma perhexiline levels. Perhexiline phenotyping separates the poor and extensive metaboliser phenotypes much more clearly than other tests and defines a sub-group at risk from perhexiline toxicity. Pretreatment phenotyping using this test, followed by exclusion of poor metabolisers from perhexiline therapy, should substantially reduce the incidence of major adverse effects...|$|E
