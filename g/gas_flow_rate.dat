The effects of some key factors (i. e. evaporation temperature, <b>gas</b> and liquid <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> and solvent concentration) on mass and heat transfer are systematically investigated. It is found that both evaporation temperature and <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> have significant influences on vapor and heat transfer, while liquid <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> have limited effect on mass and heat transfer in membrane evaporation. The vapor and recovered heat fluxes increase exponentially with the rise in evaporation temperature, and increase linearly with the rise in <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates.</b> The increase in evaporation temperature and <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> also significantly improves the evaporation efficiency and heat recovery. Mass and heat transfer rates decrease as the concentration of the solvent increases because of the reduced vapor pressure of the liquid at higher concentration.
