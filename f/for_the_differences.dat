5|$|In 1709, Abraham Darby I {{established}} a coke-fired blast furnace to produce cast iron, replacing charcoal, although continuing to use blast furnaces.

5|$|Psilocybe allenii was {{described}} as new to science in 2012 by Jan Borovička, Alan Rockefeller, and Peter G. Werner. Borovička received material collected from Seattle, Washington, which he noted was microscopically similar to Psilocybe cyanescens, but lacked the wavy cap margins characteristic of that species. In previous publications, Borovička had noted that both macro- and microscopic characters of certain Psilocybe species were highly variable, which could also account <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> observed in the Seattle material. However, DNA sequencing revealed a 5-base pair change in the internal transcribed spacer regions (a segment of RNA often used in molecular phylogenetics to identify or distinguish fungal species) between P.cyanescens and the Seattle collections. This difference, {{in addition to the}} readily observable macroscopic differences, was deemed sufficient to warrant describing the taxon as a new species. Additional molecular studies published by Borovička and colleagues in 2015 identified P.azurescens, P.cyanescens, P.weraroa, P.cubensis, and P.serbica as closely related to P.allenii.|$|E

25|$|Unger’s {{critique}} of Marginalism begins with Walras’ equilibrium theory, which attempted {{to achieve a}} certainty of economic analysis by putting aside normative controversies of social organization. Unger finds three weaknesses that crippled the theory: foremost, the theory claimed that equilibrium would be spontaneously generated in a market economy. In reality, a self-adjusting equilibrium fails to occur. Second, the theory puts forth a determinate image of the market. Historically, however, the market {{has been shown to}} be indeterminate with different market arrangements. Third, the polemical use of efficiency fails to account <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> of distribution among individuals, classes, and generations.|$|E
25|$|During the mid-20th century, Karl Popper {{emphasized}} {{the criterion of}} falsifiability to distinguish science from nonscience. Statements, hypotheses, or theories have falsifiability or refutability if there is the inherent possibility {{that they can be}} proven false. That is, if it is possible to conceive of an observation or an argument which negates them. Popper used astrology and psychoanalysis as examples of pseudoscience and Einstein's theory of relativity as an example of science. He subdivided nonscience into philosophical, mathematical, mythological, religious and metaphysical formulations on one hand, and pseudoscientific formulations on the other, though he did not provide clear criteria <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>differences.</b>|$|E

25|$|Health care {{prices in}} the United States {{describes}} market and non-market factors that determine pricing, along with possible causes as to why prices are higher than other countries. Compared to other OECD countries, U.S. healthcare costs are one-third higher or more relative {{to the size of}} the economy (GDP). According to the CDC, during 2015 health expenditures per-person were nearly $10,000 on average, with total expenditures of $3.2 trillion or 17.8% GDP. Proximate reasons <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> with other countries include higher prices for the same services (i.e., higher price per unit) and greater use of healthcare (i.e., more units consumed). Higher administrative costs, higher per-capita income, and less government intervention to drive down prices are deeper causes. While the annual inflation rate in healthcare costs has declined in recent decades, it still remains above the rate of economic growth, resulting in a steady increase in healthcare expenditures relative to GDP from 6% in 1970 to nearly 18% in 2015.|$|E
25|$|In the Ptolemaic system, each {{planet is}} moved {{by a system}} of two spheres: one called its deferent; the other, its epicycle. The deferent is a circle whose center point, called the {{eccentric}} and marked in the diagram with an X, {{is removed from the}} Earth. The original purpose of the eccentric was to account <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> of the lengths of the seasons (autumn is the shortest by a week or so), by placing the Earth away from the center of rotation {{of the rest of the}} universe. Another sphere, the epicycle, is embedded inside the deferent sphere and is represented by the smaller dotted line to the right. A given planet then moves around the epicycle at the same time the epicycle moves along the path marked by the deferent. These combined movements cause the given planet to move closer to and further away from the Earth at different points in its orbit, and explained the observation that planets slowed down, stopped, and moved backward in retrograde motion, and then again reversed to resume normal, or prograde, motion.|$|E
25|$|After the enroute {{navigation}} {{test flight}} was completed, the AAIB's test pilot flew several approaches to Campbeltown Airport {{with the same}} aircraft while investigators monitored its position on the radar equipment that was used {{the night of the}} accident. When the test aircraft flew the approach as indicated on the navigation chart that was found clipped to the pilot's control wheel, there was a small gap in radar coverage when the aircraft was at its most distant point from the airport, beginning at 10.1nm and ending on the return segment at 9.4nm from the MAC VOR. Other trials were conducted at lower altitudes, and in those trials the coverage gap was widened considerably. Investigators tried approaches at low and descending altitudes involving a steeper left turn to 157° (where the heading bug was set on the HSI), and then flying that heading until intercepting the correct course to the MAC VOR. When this track was flown at 1,400 feet, the last radar contact was at 7.9nm from the MAC VOR. The last radar contact with the accident flight was at 8.1nm from the MAC VOR, at an altitude of 1,340 feet. Flying this track with the accident flight's known and projected descent profile brought the test aircraft to within 0.2nm of the crash site at an altitude of 200 feet, which was within the margin of error <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> in wind {{on the day of the}} accident and on the day of the test flight.|$|E

25|$|The {{history of}} {{cortical}} stimulation mapping {{dates back to}} the late 19th century. Neurologists David Ferrier and Victor Horsley were some of the first to utilize this technique. Ferrier and Horsley employed CSM to further grasp the structure and function of the pre-Rolandic and post-Rolandic areas, also known as the pre central gyrus and post central gyrus. Prior to the development of more advanced methods, in 1888 C.B. Nancrede utilized a battery operated bipolar probe in order to map the motor cortex. In 1937, Wilder Penfield and Boldrey were able to show that stimulating the precentral gyrus elicited a response contralaterally; a significant finding given that it correlated to the anatomy based on which part of the brain was stimulated. In the early 1900s Charles Sherrington began to use monopolar stimulation in order to elicit a motor response. This technique allowed Sherrington to determine that the precentral gyrus (pre-Rolandic area) is a motor cortex and the postcentral gyrus (post-Rolandic area) is a sensory cortex. These findings, which were repeated by Harvey Cushing through the early 1900s, show that the Rolandic fissure is the point of separation between the motor and sensory cortices. Cushing's work with CSM moved it from an experimental technique to one that became a staple neurosurgery technique used to map the brain and treat epilepsy. Cushing took work that had previously been done on animals, specifically chimpanzees and orangutans, and was able to utilize cortical stimulation mapping to account <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> between these species and humans. Cushing's work dramatically increased the effectiveness of the treatment utilizing cortical stimulation mapping, as neurosurgeons were now utilizing a more updated picture of the brain.|$|E

[...] The application of The Art of War strategies throughout history is attributed to its philosophical rhetoric. Daoism is the central principle in the Art of War. Combs compares ancient Daoist Chinese to traditional Aristotelian rhetoric, notably <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> in persuasion. Daoist rhetoric in the art of war warfare strategies is described as [...] "peaceful and passive, favoring silence over speech". This form of communication is parsimonious.

500|$|Epigenetics is {{the study}} of {{heritable}} changes in gene function that cannot be explained by changes in the underlying DNA sequence but cause the organism's genes to behave (or [...] "express themselves") differently. One example of epigenetic change is the marking of the genes by DNA methylation which determines whether they will be expressed or not. Gene expression can also be controlled by repressor proteins that attach to silencer regions of the DNA and prevent that region of the DNA code from being expressed. Epigenetic marks may be added or removed from the DNA during programmed stages of development of the plant, and are responsible, for example, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> between anthers, petals and normal leaves, {{despite the fact that they}} all have the same underlying genetic code. Epigenetic changes may be temporary or may remain through successive cell divisions for the remainder of the cell's life. Some epigenetic changes have been shown to be heritable, while others are reset in the germ cells.|$|E
