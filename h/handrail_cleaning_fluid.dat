40|$|Keywords:drilling fluid; filter cake; <b>cleaning</b> <b>fluid</b> formula; {{weight loss}} rate Abstract. In order to {{evaluate}} the cleaning effect on filter cake, a set of test device was designed. The <b>cleaning</b> <b>fluid</b> formula and parameters which were elected by experiments were optimized. The weight of the filter cake before and after cleaning was analyzed by wet weight method. New alkaline flush fluid formula was confirmed finally and the washing technology suitable for filter cake of silicate-based polymer drilling fluid has been studied out. The effect of core permeability after cleaning has also been evaluated. The experimental results showed that No. 5 formula was suitable for the cleaning filter cake of silicate-based drilling fluid filter, and the weight loss rate could reach 94. 09 % when cleaning time was 60 minutes. The rotating speed played a minor role in cleaning effect. Weight loss rates increased {{with the increase of}} temperature. The weight loss reached 100 % when temperature was 90 ℃.

40|$|LectureAn {{investigation}} {{of the effectiveness of}} online combustion turbine axial compressor washing using various purity grade waters and commercial washing detergents was performed. For this project, blade surface fouling dirt was obtained from gas turbine axial compressor blades installed at various field sites. The dirt was analyzed to determine the composition and consistency of typical blade surface fouling materials. A representative dirt formula and blade coating procedure was developed so that comparative tests could be performed using various <b>cleaning</b> <b>fluids.</b> Dirt coated blades were installed in a wind tunnel capable of simulating compressor operating conditions. A spray nozzle upstream of the blade test section was used for washing blades with five different test liquids to determine the effectiveness or advantages of any liquid. Once this testing was completed, a similar test setup was then utilized to inject a mixture of formulated fouling dirt, and the various online cleaning liquids upstream of the blade into the wind tunnel to assess redeposit characteristics. The effect of highpurity water versus regular water on fouling dirt was also studied in separate residue experiments. Results indicate that spraying <b>cleaning</b> <b>fluid</b> into a flowing air stream is a viable means of cleaning a compressor blade. Each of the fluids was able to clean the test blade at both low and high air velocities and at different blade incident angles. Within the parameters/fluids tested, the results indicate that: 1. The blade cleaning is primarily a mechanical function and does not depend on the type of <b>fluid</b> used for <b>cleaning.</b> The results showed that most of the cleaning occurs shortly after the <b>cleaning</b> <b>fluid</b> is introduced into the flow stream. 2. Dirt removed from the blades may redeposit in other areas as the <b>cleaning</b> <b>fluid</b> is evaporated. Redeposit occurred in flow recirculation zones during the cleaning tests, and heated flow tests demonstrated dirt deposit {{in the presence of a}} <b>cleaning</b> <b>fluid.</b> In addition, the type of <b>fluid</b> used for <b>cleaning</b> has no effect on the redeposit characteristics of the dirt. 3. Blade erosion was not found to be a significant issue for the short durations that online water-washing was performed. However, uncontrolled water-washing (or overspray) for extended periods of time did result in measureable leading and trailing edge blade erosions...|$|R

40|$|Formate-based mud {{has been}} used to drill deep gas wells in Saudi Arabia since 2004. This mud {{typically}} contains XC-polymer, starch, polyanionic cellulose, and a relatively small amount of calcium carbonate particles, and is used to drill a deep sandstone reservoir (310 ?F). Calcium carbonate particles are frequently used as weighting material to maintain the pressure that is required for well control and minimize the leak-off. Such solids become consolidated and trapped in the polymeric material and this makes the filter cake a strong permeability barrier. Various <b>cleaning</b> <b>fluids</b> were proposed to remove drilling mud filter cake; including: solid-free formate brine and formate brine doped with organic acids (acetic, formic, and citric acids), esters, and enzymes. The main objective of this research is to assess the effectiveness of these <b>cleaning</b> <b>fluids</b> in removing drilling mud filter cake. A dynamic high-pressure/high-temperature (HPHT) cell was used to determine characteristics of the drilling mud filter cake. Drilling mud and completion fluids were obtained from the field. Compatibility tests between potassium formate brine, <b>cleaning</b> <b>fluids,</b> and formation brine were performed at 300 ?F and 200 psi using HPHT visual cells. Surface tensions of various <b>cleaning</b> <b>fluids</b> were also measured at high temperatures. The conventional method for cleaning the filter cake is by circulating solid-free formate brines at a high flow rate. This mechanical technique removes only the external drilling fluid damage. Citric acid at 10 wt%, formic acid, and lactic acid were found to be incompatible with formate brine at room temperature. However, these acids were compatible with formate brine at temperatures greater than 122 ?F. Only acetic acid was compatible with formate brine. A formula was developed that is compatible at room and reservoir temperature. This formula was effective in removing filter cake. A corrosion inhibitor was added to protect downhole tubulars. In general detail, this research will discuss the development of this formula and all tests that led to its development...|$|R
