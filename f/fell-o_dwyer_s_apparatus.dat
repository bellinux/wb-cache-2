40|$|The Gram-negative {{bacteria}} Chlamydia trachomatis is {{a common}} sexually transmitted pathogen that can cause severe sequelae including cause pelvic inflammatory disease and sterility. This obligate intracellular pathogen effectively manipulates host cellular functions by secreting virulence factors across its membrane bound vacuole. Identifying these virulence components and how they help in establishing an environment conducive for bacterial growth is central to understanding chlamydial pathogenesis. This is experimentally challenging {{due to a lack}} of tools to perform molecular genetic studies. In the absence of genetic tools, we developed a yeast model system to identify and characterize chlamydial proteins involved in virulence mechanisms. In this study we describe the identification of twenty-eight proteins potentially involved in modulating host cellular functions and the secretion of virulence factors into the host. Since the delivery of virulence proteins by a type three secretion (T 3 S) system is a critical step for Chlamydia, we identified the proteins that interacted with the T 3 <b>S</b> <b>apparatus</b> by yeast two-hybrid analysis. We discovered several novel interactions between and determined that the C. trachomatis T 3 <b>S</b> <b>apparatus</b> displayed a similar architecture to that of other T 3 S systems. Furthermore with these approaches we identified networks of proteins that interacted with the secretion apparatus including a novel secretion chaperone protein.

Unlike other known chaperones, Mcsc directly interact with a conserved component of the T 3 <b>S</b> <b>apparatus</b> cytoplasmic domain, CdsQ. These finding represents a novel mechanism by which the secretion chaperone protein Ct 260 may increase the secretion efficiency of its effector cargo and may reveal new facets of secretory cargo recognition by T 3 S systems.

VirB 6 is essential for DNA transfer and is a polytopic integral membrane protein with at least four membrane-spanning domains. VirB 6 is postulated to function in T-pilus biogenesis {{and to be a}} component of the T 4 <b>S</b> <b>apparatus.</b> To identify amino acids required for VirB 6 function, random mutations were introduced into virB 6, and mutants that failed to complement a deletion in virB 6 in tumour formation assays were isolated. Twenty-one non-functional mutants were identified, eleven of which had a point mutation that led to a substitution in a single amino acid. Characterization of the mutants indicated that the N-terminal large periplasmic domain and the transmembrane domain TM 3 are required for VirB 6 function. TM 3 has an unusual sequence feature in that it is rich in bulky hydrophobic amino acids. This feature is found conserved in the VirB 6 family of proteins. Studies on the effect of VirB 6 on other VirB proteins showed that the octopine Ti-plasmid VirB 6, unlike its nopaline Ti-plasmid counterpart, does not affect accumulation of VirB 3 and VirB 5, but has a strong negative effect on the accumulation of the VirB 7 -VirB 7 dimer. Using indirect immunofluorescencemicroscopy the authors recently demonstrated that VirB 6 localizes to a cell pole in a VirB-dependent manner. Mutations identified in the present study did not affect polar localization of the protein or the formation of the VirB 7 -VirB 7 dimer. A VirB 6 -GFP fusion that contained the entire VirB 6 ORF did not localize to a cell pole in either the presence or the absence of the other VirB proteins.

40|$|The Type II {{secretion}} (T 2 <b>S)</b> <b>apparatus</b> {{is required}} for the survival and fitness of Vibrio cholerae both in the human host as well as its natural aquatic environment due to its ability to secrete proteins such as cholera toxin and hydrolytic enzymes. This apparatus, which is widely distributed among Gram negative pathogens, is composed of at least 12 proteins and spans the entire cell envelope. The energy to support secretion through the T 2 S system is provided by an ATPase associated with this complex, EpsE. EpsE is homologous to many ATPases involved with other molecular trafficking machineries and is comprised of three distinct subdomains: the N-terminal domain (NTD), the C-terminal domain (CTD), and a tetracysteine coordinating zinc binding domain (CM). These studies demonstrate that the mechanism of ATP hydrolysis requires oligomerization of EpsE, which allows for the realignment of specific arginine residues from the NTD, CTD and the CTD of a neighboring subunit to form the active site. Replacement of any of these arginine residues in the active site or of residues within the subunit interface halts the activity of EpsE, suggesting conformational changes associated with the binding, hydrolysis and release of nucleotide must be precise. An additional arginine from the CM domain is also required to complete the active site, suggesting a role for all three domains in ATP hydrolysis and energizing the T 2 S machinery. Previous work has shown EpsE to interact with the T 2 <b>S</b> <b>apparatus</b> through its NTD with another T 2 S component, EpsL. The movement of the NTD in association with EpsL likely provides a means of transforming the energy from ATP hydrolysis into mechanical work to support T 2 S. This work provides further evidence that the CM domain may be involved in additional protein-protein contacts with either EpsL or another protein associated with the T 2 S machinery. It is conceivable that the CM domain may play a direct role in the regulation of ATPase activity as it is in prime position to connect the nucleotide binding pocket to other components of the T 2 <b>S</b> <b>apparatus</b> through protein-protein interactions...|$|R

The C. pneumoniae genome encodes a type III secretion (T 3 <b>S)</b> <b>apparatus</b> {{that may be used}} to infect eukaryotic cells and to evade the host immune response. In the present study, Cpn 0712 (CdsD), Cpn 0704 (CdsQ), and Cpn 0826 (CdsL), three C. pneumoniae genes encoding yersiniae T 3 S YscD, YscQ, and YscL homologs, respectively, were cloned and expressed as histidine- and glutathione S-transferase (GST) -tagged proteins in Escherichia coli. Purified recombinant proteins were used to raise hyper-immune polyclonal antiserum and were used in GST pull-down and copurification assays to identify protein-protein interactions. CdsD was detected in both EB and RB lysates by Western blot analyses, and immunofluorescent staining demonstrated the presence of CdsD within inclusions. Triton X- 114 solubilization and phase separation of chlamydial EB proteins indicated that CdsD partitions with cytoplasmic proteins, suggesting it is not an integral membrane protein. GST pull-down assays indicated that recombinant CdsD interacts with CdsQ and CdsL, and copurification assays with chlamydial lysates confirmed that native CdsD interacts with CdsQ and CdsL. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating interactions between YscD, YscQ, and YscL homologs of bacterial T 3 S systems.

40|$|In many {{important}} human pathogens, such as Shigella and Salmonella spp., the bacterial type III secretion (T 3 <b>S)</b> <b>apparatus</b> {{is required to}} initiate inflammation via activation of caspase- 1 - or NF-κB-dependent genes. Using an ex vivo infection model, {{the goal of the}} present study was to determine whether the chlamydial T 3 <b>S</b> <b>apparatus</b> also modulates the host inflammatory response. Infections of mouse peritoneal macrophages were performed with Chlamydia muridarum, and the expression of inflammatory cytokines was monitored by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Since there is no current genetic system for Chlamydia spp., blockade of T 3 S was accomplished pharmacologically using a T 3 S inhibitor called INP 0007. It has been previously shown that INP 0007 also blocks chlamydial growth in vitro and that the addition of exogenous iron completely reverses this deficit. The addition of iron to INP 0007 -treated C. muridarum-infected macrophages not only restored chlamydial growth deficit caused by INP 0007 but also led to a multi-inclusion phenotype. Overall, T 3 S inhibition led to decreased interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), IL- 1 β, and CXCL 10, whereas the tumor necrosis factor alpha levels were unchanged. Rescue of chlamydial growth by addition of iron sulfate did not restore cytokine production, implying that the decreased expression of many cytokines during infection was dependent on T 3 S and not solely on growth. In addition, the observation that the greatest effects of INP 0007 were seen at late time points during infection suggests that a temporally regulated T 3 S effector protein(s) may be triggering the host cytokine response...|$|R

Mechanisms controlling the hierarchical addressing of needle subunits, translocators and effectors to the T 3 <b>S</b> <b>apparatus</b> (T 3 SA) are still poorly understood. We investigated the function of MxiC, the member of the YopN/InvE/SepL family in the Shigella flexneri T 3 S system. Inactivation of mxiC led specifically to a deregulated secretion of effectors (including IpaA, IpgD, IcsB, IpgB 2, OspD 1 and IpaHs), but not of translocators (IpaB and IpaC) and proteins controlling the T 3 SA structure or activity (Spa 32 and IpaD).

MxiC is a T 3 SA substrate and its ability to be secreted is required for its function. By using co-purification assays, we found that MxiC can associate with the Spa 47 ATPase, which suggests that MxiC might prevent secretion of effectors by blocking the T 3 SA from the inside.

These Bartonella-translocated effector proteins (Beps) A-G are encoded together with the VirB system and the T 4 S coupling protein VirD 4 on a Bartonella-specific pathogenicity island. The Beps display a modular architecture, suggesting an evolution by extensive domain duplication and reshuffling.

This biparte C terminus constitutes a transfer signal that is sufficient to mediate VirB/VirD 4 -dependent intracellular delivery of reporter protein fusions. The Bep-intracellular delivery domain is also present in conjugative relaxases of bacterial conjugation systems.

The most dramatic alterations were detected for the needle protein CdsF. Significantly, disulfide bonding patterns shifted during differentiation of developmental forms and were completely reduced in RBs. Furthermore, at later time points during infection following RB to EB conversion, we found that CdsF is reoxidized into higher-order complexes. Overall, we conclude that the redox status of specific T 3 SS apparatus proteins is intimately linked to the developmental cycle and constitutes a newly appreciated aspect of functionally significant alterations within proteins of the chlamydial envelope...|$|R
40|$|TheCpx {{envelope}} {{stress response}} facilitates adaptation to envelope stresses {{that lead to}} themisfolding of periplasmic proteins. Cpx-mediated adaptation involves elevated expression of periplasmic proteases and chaperones. Previously, we demonstrated that induc-tion of the Cpx envelope stress response in enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) also results in inhibition of type III secretion (T 3 S) {{and that this is}} correlatedwith downregulated transcription of the relevant genes. Here, we investigatedwhether theCpx stress responsemight also exert posttranscriptional effects on theT 3 <b>S</b> <b>apparatus.</b> We show thatDsbA is required for T 3 S,while removal of transcription factorCpxRor theCpx-regulated folding factorCpxPor PpiAhasminimal effects. Conversely, the entire T 3 S complex is removed from the envelopewhen theCpx response is activated. Overexpression of the chaperone/proteaseDegPmimics theCpx-de-pendent inhibition of the T 3 S complex at a posttranscriptional level, andmutation of degPpartly abrogates the ability of theCpx re-sponse to inhibit the T 3 S complex andmotility. Wepresent data that suggest that both the protease and chaperone activities ofDegP are likely important for the impact onT 3 S. Altogether, our data indicate thatDegP is normally a part of theCpx-mediated inhibition of virulence determinant expression in EPECand that additional factors are involved. The bacterial envelope is a dynamic compartment that houses amultitude of proteins involved in essential cellular processes. Direct contact with the external environment makes its protein content vulnerable to stress-induced misfolding. Signal-specific extracytoplasmic stress response systems have evolved in Gram...|$|R
