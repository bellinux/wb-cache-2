2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Soap Opera Digest, Riegel detailed {{what it was like}} preparing for her character's rape scenes. She explained that it was grueling and that there were only four people in the episode. She found it to be [...] "very work-intensive," [...] emotionally haunting, and voiced that she had trouble sleeping. She elaborated that [...] "these" [...] type of scenes really stay with a person. Riegel and co-star William deVry (Michael Cambias) rehearsed the scenes on their own, which normally would not have been the case. Riegel commented that it definitely required more work than an ordinary episode. Asked if she was frightened of deVry during Bianca's rape scenes, she admitted that she was and that it was a testament to deVry's acting skills. About the uneasiness of the scenes and whether or not she was frightened or intimidated by [...] "the gravity" [...] of the storyline, she stated, [...] "Absolutely, I was. To be honest, I didn't know if I could handle it. But I knew it was a very important thing to do and that the show was serious about handling it well." [...] She added, [...] "I knew we could reach people, and that it was powerful stuff. I could feel the power of it. And <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> put myself through this because ultimately it might help somebody, touch somebody, make people talk about it. And rape is something people should talk about." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah,--I wish <b>I</b> <b>knew.</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> {{have said}} that I had seen every {{shilling}} that came into the house; but I know nothing of this cheque,--whence it came." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not see [...] The season's glorious show, [...] Nor would its {{brightness}} shine for me; [...] Nor its wild music flow; ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shouldn't wonder. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> go mad if {{my mother}} {{turned out to be}} {{somebody}} else's wife." [...] And then they both sauntered away.|$|R
60|$|MRS. MARCHMONT. Olivia, I have {{a curious}} feeling of {{absolute}} faintness. <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>should</b> like some supper very much. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> like some supper.|$|R
6000|$|... "All {{attachments}} are so. It is electricity--spontaneity. It is instantaneous. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> {{love you}} from the moment I saw you. Do you not feel it yourself?" ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{began to}} weep. [...] "There! <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> hurt your feelings. But you mustn't mind what I say. I beg your pardon! I {{take it all}} back--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh weh! <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have a cruel husband who----Joy! I {{think the}} maid is prowling about {{and trying to}} listen. 'Shhh! The story Laura {{will get out of}} her!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> it, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> it," [...] cried Hester, {{wringing}} her hands, [...] "but {{even if it}} were now, I {{could not}} help it. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> do it again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{professor}} of what? <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> ask of where; {{but that would}} only elicit {{the name of a}} college, which would convey no real information to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'God {{help me to}} {{keep the}} resolution! It {{is the one thing}} that I care for, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have begun the first day I was away from you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|She started, {{shaking her}} head saucily. ''Twas so slow there, and so broiling,' she called back, 'and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> only drift down to meet you, and could put in when I pleased.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I had a sort {{of longing}} to come into those natural {{relations}} which <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> find here. Over there I had only, as I may say, artificial relations. Don't you see the difference?" ...|$|E
60|$|My dear Haydon--We {{are very}} unlucky--I should have stopped to dine with you, but <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> {{not have been}} able to leave you in time for my plaguy sore throat; which is getting well.|$|E
6000|$|... "But he can," [...] {{said the}} father. [...] "At any rate {{you can find}} out whether he will name a price. I'd go myself, but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> quarrel with him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am {{glad you}} took it, Robin; <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have grown idle if I had had it. Depend on it, 'twas {{that gave me}} this year of grace and the Bishop's prize.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I quite {{agree with}} you there. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> drown myself or put a bullet through my head if I could not show {{ordinary}} courage {{with a lot of}} ladies going on working quietly round me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Acquaintances; {{only a few}} friends. I can't help regretting those I {{must leave}} behind. In fact"--he spoke impulsively, expressing a thought that had haunted him--"it would be a relief if <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> come back again." ...|$|E
60|$|How nice of him {{to bring}} them! <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> like Mrs. Allardyce, just because Aunt Martha didn't. We had a {{delightful}} stroll. I never thought of the time until Mr. Shelmardine said it was four o'clock.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not now! No, never!' {{said the}} boy hugging him almost to choking. 'That naughty Ben Kader said they had sold you for a slave, and you were going away; but <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> find you--you are not a slave!--you are not black--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} been certain of this; {{that has been the}} sole reason, of my absence. Had <b>I</b> <b>known</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> be welcome, nothing would have induced me to suffer Grace to pass the last six sad, sad, months by herself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>should</b> go away, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> go away," [...] he said, half {{under his}} breath. [...] "And I can. I am no weakling. Because I {{have failed to}} remain away once, is no reason that I shall fail again." ...|$|R
60|$|SOAMES. I {{admit that}} <b>I</b> <b>should</b> {{probably}} not do so. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> perhaps be wrong not {{to steal the}} turnip: I cant defend my reluctance to do so; but <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not do so. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not do so.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. Wasn't it extraordinary? I {{felt when}} I saw my cloak in Scotland Yard: There, <b>I</b> <b>KNEW</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> recover you. And I always feel, as I say, {{that there is}} some higher power which helps me. Do you feel the same?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I too {{had been}} struck from the float for ever held in solution, I too had [...] {{received}} identity by my Body; That I was, I knew, was of my body--and what I should be, <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> [...] be of my body.|$|E
6000|$|... "Henri, friend, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> find ye," [...] said Dick, {{cutting the}} thongs that bound him. [...] "Get up if ye can, we haven't {{much time to}} lose, an' mayhap we'll have to fight afore we're done wi' the Red-skins. Can ye rise?" ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not see [...] The season's glorious show, [...] Nor would its {{brightness}} shine for me; [...] Nor its wild music flow; [...] But if, {{around my}} place of sleep, [...] The friends <b>I</b> love <b>should</b> come to weep, [...] They might not haste to go. [...] Soft airs and song, {{and the light}} and bloom, [...] Should keep them lingering by my tomb.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't help it; I'm {{perfectly}} {{fascinated by}} those foolish things, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have bought some; {{so it is}} well that I've lost my money, perhaps," [...] answered Daisy, looking so innocently penitent and so frankly disappointed that Mr. Vaughn said kindly:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{they really}} like it, {{there is no}} objection. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> like very much to have my brother here quizzing me; but {{you know very well}} there are two sorts of such fun, and one that is only sport to the {{stronger}} side." ...|$|R
60|$|Of course I {{decided to}} leave Montreal as soon as I could. But I couldn't get away within a week, {{and it was a}} very {{unpleasant}} one. Alicia treated me with icy indifference, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> never be reinstated in her good graces.|$|E
6000|$|... "No. Some day <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> {{meet the}} only girl I could {{possibly}} love, and then I would pour out upon her the stored-up devotion of a lifetime, lay an unblemished heart at her feet, fold {{her in my arms}} and say 'At last!'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh yes; <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> soon {{be right}} again. I {{have not made}} the {{acquaintance}} of gout {{for more than two}} years, and it generally goes off the second night. Well, where have you been this morning? I saw you come in just now, I think!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It's no use {{talking about}} it,' Alice said, {{looking up at}} the house and pretending it was arguing with her. 'I'm NOT going in again yet. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have to get through the Looking-glass again--back into the old room--and there'd be an end of all my adventures!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How very silly of you, John! What {{made you}} indorse for them? Now {{that is too}} bad; {{it just makes me}} {{perfectly}} miserable to think of such things. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not have done so; but I don't see why you need pay it. It is their business, anyhow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What's {{the good}} of troubling about a man like Sheen? He never was any good, and this doesn't make him very much worse. Besides, he'll {{probably}} be sick enough on his own account. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>should,</b> if I'd done it. And, anyway, we don't know that he did do it." ...|$|R
