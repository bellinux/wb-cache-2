5|$|The {{economic}} {{importance of}} nature {{is indicated by}} the use of the expression <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services</b> to highlight the market relevance of an increasingly scarce natural world that can no longer be regarded as both unlimited and free. In general, as a commodity or service becomes more scarce the price increases and this acts as a restraint that encourages frugality, technical innovation and alternative products. However, this only applies when the product or service falls within the market system. As <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services</b> are generally treated as economic externalities they are unpriced and therefore overused and degraded, a situation sometimes referred to as the Tragedy of the Commons.|$|E

30|$|In {{support of}} forest {{restoration}} activities by IUCN and others, here {{we present a}} comparative analysis of <b>ecosystem</b> <b>service</b> assessment tools that can quantify <b>ecosystem</b> <b>service</b> tradeoffs. In the following sections, we present an overview of <b>ecosystem</b> <b>service</b> models relevant to restoration decision making and characterize the tools based on five key criteria. These criteria include their ability to quantify the benefits of restoration activities and scenarios in a timely and cost-effective manner across different geographic locations and scales, <b>ecosystem</b> <b>service</b> types, decision contexts, and under varying levels of uncertainty. We use that information to build a spreadsheet-based decision framework and a future online selector that we call the Restoration <b>Ecosystem</b> <b>Service</b> Tool Selector (RESTS). This framework will allow analysts to identify <b>ecosystem</b> <b>service</b> assessment tools that are best able to provide relevant information to guide the restoration decision-making process. We describe two hypothetical FLR decision contexts to illustrate how RESTS would guide an analyst toward particular <b>ecosystem</b> <b>service</b> assessment tools under different situations, and conclude by considering best practices and next steps for using <b>ecosystem</b> <b>service</b> assessments in restoration decision making.|$|R

5|$|While the long-toed {{salamander}} {{is classified as}} least concern by the IUCN, many forms of land development negatively affect the salamander's habitat and have put new perspectives and priorities into its conservation biology. Conservation priorities focus at the population level of diversity, which is declining at rates ten times that of species extinction. Population level diversity is what provides <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services,</b> such as the keystone role that salamanders play in the soil ecosystems, including the nutrient cycling that supports wetland and forested ecosystems.|$|E
5|$|Despite its urban character, the San Francisco Bay {{is one of}} California's most ecologically {{important}} habitats, providing key <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services</b> such as filtering pollutants and sediments {{from the}} rivers, and supporting a number of endangered species. The region is also known for the complexity of its landforms, the result {{of millions of years}} of tectonic plate movements. Because the Bay Area is crossed by six major earthquake faults, the region is particularly exposed to hazards presented by large earthquakes. The climate is temperate and generally very mild, and is ideal for outdoor recreational and athletic activities such as hiking. The Bay Area is host to seven professional sports teams and is a cultural center for music, theater, and the arts. It is also host to several institutions of higher education, ranging from primary schools to major research universities. Home to 101 municipalities and nine counties, governance in the Bay Area is mutlifaceted and involves numerous local and regional actors, each with wide-ranging and overlapping responsibilities.|$|E
5|$|The Bay Area {{is home to}} {{a diverse}} array of {{wildlife}} and, along with the connected San Joaquin River Delta represents one of California's most important ecological habitats. California's Dungeness crab, Pacific halibut, and the California scorpionfish are all significant components of the bay's fisheries. The bay's salt marshes now represent most of California's remaining salt marsh and support a number of endangered species and provide key <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services</b> such as filtering pollutants and sediments from the rivers. Most famously, the bay is a key link in the Pacific Flyway and with millions of shorebirds annually visiting the bay shallows as a refuge, is the most important component of the flyway south of Alaska. Many endangered species of birds are also found here: the California least tern, the California clapper rail, the snowy egret, and the black crowned night heron.|$|E
40|$|Ensuring water, {{food and}} energy {{security}} {{for a growing}} world population represents a 21 st century catchment management challenge. Failure to recognise the complexity of interactions across <b>ecosystem</b> <b>service</b> provision can risk the loss of other key environmental and socioeconomic benefits from the natural capital of catchment systems. In particular, the ability of soil and water to meet human needs is undermined by uncertainties around climate change effects, <b>ecosystem</b> <b>service</b> interactions and conflicting stakeholder interests across catchments. This critical review draws from an extensive literature to discuss the benefits and challenges of utilising an <b>ecosystem</b> <b>service</b> approach for integrated catchment management (ICM). State-of-the-art research on <b>ecosystem</b> <b>service</b> assessment, mapping and participatory approaches is evaluated and a roadmap of the key short- and longer-term research needs for maximising landscape-scale <b>ecosystem</b> <b>service</b> provision from catchments is proposed. © 2017 by the authors.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study aims to {{quantify}} the impacts of land use changes on <b>ecosystem</b> <b>service</b> value during large scale land development, and to provide key information for both economic development and policy makers for eco-environmental protection. The study area locates in Manas river watershed which is a typical land development region in northwest China. Landsat MSS/TM/ETM+ images in 1976, 1989, 1999 and 2008 were applied to estimate <b>ecosystem</b> <b>service</b> value based on land use, and subsequently <b>ecosystem</b> <b>service</b> value dynamics were analyzed in response to land use changes. It is found that the built-up area and cultivated land increased significantly from 1976 to 2008. The decreasing <b>ecosystem</b> <b>service</b> value (from 17362. 2 million Yuan in 1976 to 16975. 0 million Yuan in 2008) is mainly caused by the reduced grassland. The combined <b>ecosystem</b> <b>service</b> value of water body and grassland is over 60 % of the total value. Functions of water supply, waste treatment, soil formation and retention and biodiversity protection contributed to over 70 % of the total service value. The results suggest that a reasonable land use plan should emphasize protection of water body, woodland and grassland as they have the highest <b>ecosystem</b> <b>service</b> value...|$|R
5|$|The soils {{in which}} plants grow are {{inhabited}} by microbial communities, with one gram of soil containing around 109-1010 microbial cells which comprise about one gigabase of sequence information. The microbial communities which inhabit soils {{are some of}} the most complex known to science, and remain poorly understood despite their economic importance. Microbial consortia perform a wide variety of <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services</b> necessary for plant growth, including fixing atmospheric nitrogen, nutrient cycling, disease suppression, and sequester iron and other metals. Functional metagenomics strategies are being used to explore the interactions between plants and microbes through cultivation-independent study of these microbial communities. By allowing insights into the role of previously uncultivated or rare community members in nutrient cycling and the promotion of plant growth, metagenomic approaches can contribute to improved disease detection in crops and livestock and the adaptation of enhanced farming practices which improve crop health by harnessing the relationship between microbes and plants.|$|E
5|$|Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface. Of this, 97.5% is {{the salty}} {{water of the}} oceans and only 2.5% freshwater, most of which is locked up in the Antarctic ice sheet. The {{remaining}} freshwater is found in glaciers, lakes, rivers, wetlands, the soil, aquifers and atmosphere. Due to the water cycle, fresh water supply is continually replenished by precipitation, however {{there is still a}} limited amount necessitating management of this resource. Awareness of the global importance of preserving water for <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services</b> has only recently emerged as, during the 20th century, more than half the world's wetlands have been lost along with their valuable environmental services. Increasing urbanization pollutes clean water supplies and much of the world still does not have access to clean, safe water. Greater emphasis is now being placed on the improved management of blue (harvestable) and green (soil water available for plant use) water, and this applies at all scales of water management.|$|E
25|$|Thirdly, {{conservation}} programmes for {{the sake}} of financial benefit underestimate human ingenuity to invent and replace <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services</b> by artificial means. McCauley argues that such proposals are deemed to have a short lifespan as the history of technology is about how Humanity developed artificial alternatives to nature’s services and with time passing the cost of such services tend to decrease. This would also lead to the devaluation of <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services.</b>|$|E
30|$|As for {{individual}} <b>ecosystem</b> <b>service,</b> besides the food production, {{all of the}} <b>ecosystem</b> <b>service</b> values declined from 1980 to 2005, of which water regulation and supply decreased the most for the human-induced cultivation and the warming and drying trend in the Nenjiang River Basin.|$|R

40|$|AbstractChanges in {{land use}} and <b>ecosystem</b> <b>service</b> values in the main urban area of Jinan between 1988 and 2002 were {{investigated}} in this paper using dataset deriving from LANDSAT TM images. In the study period, the most notable changes of land use are the decrease of cropland and the increase of construction land. With the urbanization, more and more lands were occupied for the construction purpose. Woodland and cropland are the dominant land use categories providing about 80 % of the total <b>ecosystem</b> <b>service</b> value. <b>Ecosystem</b> <b>service</b> valuation {{results showed that the}} total <b>ecosystem</b> <b>service</b> value decreased by 42. 86 million Yuan between 1988 and 2002, with an average annual decline of 3. 06 million Yuan.

40|$|The <b>ecosystem</b> <b>service</b> {{value is}} an {{important}} concept and an index that reflects {{the quality of the}} regional ecological environment status and the measurement of the total ecological benefits. In this study, based on the characteristics of land use and the types of ecosystem in the studied area, the ecological indicators including the net primary productivity of the vegetation and the vegetation cover were selected. Landsat TM remote sensing image, ground-based observation, meteorological data and statistical data etc. were applied to establish the remote sensing-based assessment criteria and assessment model for quantitative estimation of the <b>ecosystem</b> <b>service</b> value. The established assessment criteria and model were applied to conduct the quantitative calculation on the value of the single <b>ecosystem</b> <b>service</b> and the <b>ecosystem</b> <b>service</b> value per unit area. The results indicated that during the decade of 2000 – 2010, with the inter-conversion of different types of land use, the total value of the ecological service in the studied area displayed a gradually decreasing trend. Among which, the values of ecological service of the cultivation land, wetland and the total ecological service were reduced by 11. 92, 11. 75 and 5. 74 %, respectively. While the values of ecological services of forest land, waters and intertidal zone were increased to certain extend. However, these increased values did not change the continuously decreasing trend of the total value of <b>ecosystem</b> <b>service</b> in the studied area. Based on these assessments, the spatially- and temporally-changing patterns of the values of <b>ecosystem</b> <b>service</b> in the studied area were analysed to reveal their intrinsic relationship between the land use and the changes in values of <b>ecosystem</b> <b>service...</b>|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies show}} that {{introducing}} the <b>ecosystem</b> <b>service</b> concept into policy and decisionmaking requires spatially explicit information on the state and trends of <b>ecosystems</b> and their <b>services</b> (Maes et al., 2012). Current spatially explicit approaches are often based on land cover assessments (Burkhard et al., 2009; Nelson et al., 2009), assigning values of <b>ecosystem</b> <b>service</b> provision to each land cover class. This approach fails {{to make a distinction}} between the actual service provision and the underlying ecosystem potential to provide a specific service. By focusing on actual <b>ecosystem</b> <b>service</b> provision (e. g. tonnes of soil that are fixated by vegetation) the potential of a given ecosystem or community under alternative management options is ignored (e. g. afforestation on a marginal grassland will increase soil fixation when comparing a grassland to a mature forest). The full potential value that the <b>ecosystem</b> <b>service</b> can provide (in this example to mitigate soil erosion) is therefore not taken into account...|$|R
