The first part contains the theoretical definition of the concepts of social economy and social entrepreneurship and conception of social enterprise in the Czech environment. More attention is paid to work integration social enterprises. The concept of sustainability of social enterprises is presented from the perspective of international research and also the only one Czech survey on this subject - Evaluation of Supporting Social and Inclusive Entrepreneurship in HREOP. The research examined the ability of 11 work integration social enterprises to operate their business after the end of financial support from HREOP. The research is also analysing other support possibilities for social enterprises.

TRMC (time-resolved microwave conductance) monitors the conductance of photogenerated mobile charge carriers locally on a timescale of nanoseconds, while using photo-CELIV (charge extraction by linearly increasing voltage) charge carrier dynamics are monitored on a macroscopic scale and over tens of microseconds. Despite these {{significant differences in the}} length and time scales, both techniques show a reduced Langevin recombination with a prefactor close to 0. 05. For TQ 1 :PC 71 BM blends, the value is independent of temperature. On comparing TRMC data with electroluminescence measurements it is concluded that the encounter complex and the charge transfer state have very similar energetic properties. The value for annealed poly(3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT) :(6, 6) -phenyl-C- 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (PC 61 BM) is approximately 10 (- 4), while for blend systems containing an amorphous polymer values are close to 1. These large differences can be related to the extent of charge delocalization of opposite charges in an encounter complex. Insight is provided into factors governing the bimolecular recombination process, which forms a major loss mechanism limiting the efficiency of polymer solar cells.

40|$|Surface {{enhanced}} Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is {{a highly}} sensitive technique that allows detecting analytes at low concentrations [1, 2]. However, it remains challenging to perform SERS-based detection of target molecules in aqueous solutions, even more at nanomolar (nM) or picomolar (pM) concentrations. For this reason, {{there is a need}} to develop new methodologies for the preparation of substrates that exhibit high SERS effect. Such substrates should have a high-curvature features leading to the high content in ‘’hot spots’’ which can facilitate the detection of molecular traces. In this work we demonstrate the preparation of ordered silver nano-wedges array fabricated by chemical reduction of silver ions on hydrofluoric acid etched silicon wafers. Given that the surface morphology is determined by the several factors such as reagents concentrations or substrate exposure time in/over the reaction solution, we optimized the synthesis conditions in order to prepare SERS substrates with ordered structure of silver nano-wedges. The characterization of prepared SERS substrates was carried out using Atomic Force microscopy (AFM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and UV-vis spectroscopy. The theoretical model of electromagnetic field distribution on the substrate surface was performed using COMSOL software. The enhancement effect of Raman scattering for single molecule was tested by evaporating monolayer of pentacene (2 nm) on bare silicon wafer and SERS substrate. The enhancement factor was found to be 105. Silver nano-wedges decorated SERS substrates were successfully applied for the detection of proteins and peptides in liquid at nanomolar concentrations. Therefore, this work is a significant step towards detecting biological targets in their natural environment as well as understanding their behavior at bio-nano interface.

Massive parallel sequencing of the V 3 -V 4 region of the 16 S rRNA gene and qPCR analysis were performed. Antibiotic prophylaxis caused the most marked changes on the microbiota in breastfed infants, mainly resulting in a higher relative abundance of Enterobacteriaceae, compared with control infants (52 % vs. 14 %, p = 0. 044) and mixed-fed infants (52 % vs. 16 %, p = 0. 13 NS) at day 7 and in a lower bacterial diversity compared to mixed-fed infants and controls. Bifidobacteria were also particularly vulnerable and abundances were reduced in breastfed (p = 0. 001) and mixed-fed antibiotic treated groups compared to non-treated groups. Reductions in bifidobacteria in antibiotic treated infants were also confirmed by qPCR. By day 30, the bifidobacterial population recovered and abundances significantly increased in both breastfed (p = 0. 025) and mixed-fed (p = 0. 013) antibiotic treated groups, whereas Enterobacteriaceae abundances remained highest in the breastfed antibiotic treated group (44 %), compared with control infants (16 %) and mixed-fed antibiotic treated group (28 %).

The grant aimed to reduce malaria-related {{morbidity and mortality}} by 30 [*]% {{by the end of}} the implementation. Methods A mixed-methods approach was used to assess the impact of the grant implementation. Fifty-eight in-depth interviews, eight group interviews, 16 focus group discussions, and on-site observations were used. Morbidity data reported to the Ministry of Health were also examined to assess trends. Results The National Malaria Programme with funding support from the <b>Global</b> Fund <b>grant</b> and other development partners contributed considerably to strengthening malaria control and the general health system. It also brought direct and indirect benefits to pregnant women and to the community at large. However, it failed to achieve the stated objective of reducing malaria morbidity and mortality by 30 [*]%. The implementation was hampered by inadequate human resources, the rigidity of Global Fund rules, weak project management and coordination, and inadequate support from external stakeholders. Conclusion Despite limitations, the grant was implemented until the agreed closing date.
