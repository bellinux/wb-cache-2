5|$|Plato {{wrote about}} epikleroi <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>Laws,</b> {{offering}} idealized laws to govern their marriages. In mythology and history, {{a number of}} Greek women {{appear to have been}} epikleroi, including Agariste of Sicyon and Agiatis, the widow of the Spartan king Agis IV. The status of epikleroi has often been used to explain the numbers of sons-in-law who inherited from their fathers-in-law in Greek mythology. The Third Sacred War originated in a dispute over epikleroi.|$|E
5|$|Plato, <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>Laws,</b> {{set forth}} rules that governed not the ideal state, which he {{described}} in The Republic, but what he felt might be obtainable in the real world. Included amongst them were some dealing with inheritance and heiresses. In general outline, they conformed to Athenian practice, with {{the daughter of a}} man who died without male heirs becoming an epikleros. Plato gave rules governing who the husband of the epikleros might be, and said that the inherited plot might not be divided or added to another plot. The main departure from Athenian law came if there was no direct heir, and the inheritance go to collateral relations. In that case, Plato assigned the inheritance not to one person, but to a pair, one male and one female, and ordered that they must marry and provide an heir to the estate, much like the epikleros.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally the {{foundation}} of the first ten Roman Catholic dioceses has been attributed to Stephen I. It is certain that the sees of Esztergom, Kalocsa, Veszprém, Győr, Eger, Pécs and Csanád (Cenad, Romania) had been set up {{by the end of his}} rule. The Archbishop of Esztergom became the highest ranking prelate of the local Catholic Church. A second archdiocese, the archbishopric of Kalocsa was first mentioned in the middle of the 11thcentury. Stephen I also built Benedictine monasteries in Pécsvárad, Zalavár, Bakonybél and Zobor (Nitra, Slovakia), as well as a convent for Greek nuns in a valley at Veszprém. To maintain and support the Church, Stephen I seems to have established the collection of tithes, although the provision on tithes <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>laws</b> may have been a later addition.|$|E

2500|$|Not surprisingly, {{these same}} Cretans were {{credited}} with introducing {{the myth of}} Zeus kidnapping Ganymede to be his lover in Olympus [...] though even {{the king of the}} gods had to make amends to the father. This myth, however, is denounced by Plato <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>Laws</b> as having been made up to justify purely sensual practices: And we are unanimous in accusing the Cretans of fabricating the story of Ganymede: because they believed that their laws had come from Zeus, they have also attached this story to the god, thinking that they could reap the fruit of this pleasure and say that they were following the god's example. But that is the realm of myth. (636B-D) ...|$|E
2500|$|Nevertheless, despite {{defining}} the concept so elegantly <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>laws</b> of motion, even Newton {{did not actually}} use the term [...] "inertia" [...] to refer to his First Law. [...] In fact, Newton originally viewed the phenomenon he described in his First Law of Motion as being caused by [...] "innate forces" [...] inherent in matter, which resisted any acceleration. Given this perspective, and borrowing from Kepler, Newton attributed the term [...] "inertia" [...] to mean [...] "the innate force possessed by an object which resists changes in motion"; thus, Newton defined [...] "inertia" [...] to mean {{the cause of the}} phenomenon, rather than the phenomenon itself. However, Newton's original ideas of [...] "innate resistive force" [...] were ultimately problematic for a variety of reasons, and thus most physicists no longer think in these terms. As no alternate mechanism has been readily accepted, and it is now generally accepted that there may not be one which we can know, the term [...] "inertia" [...] has come to mean simply the phenomenon itself, rather than any inherent mechanism. Thus, ultimately, [...] "inertia" [...] in modern classical physics has come to be a name for the same phenomenon described by Newton's First Law of Motion, and the two concepts are now considered to be equivalent.|$|E

60|$|He had {{not done}} so to any other nation, neither had the heathen {{knowledge}} of His laws. And, therefore, they did not trust God; they did not consider Him a good God, and so they worshipped Baalim, the sun and moon and stars, with silly and foul ceremonies, to procure from them good harvests; and burnt {{their children in the}} fire to Moloch, the fire-king, to keep off the earthquakes and the floods. God had not taught them what He had taught Israel--to trust in Him, and in His word which ran very swiftly, and <b>in</b> <b>His</b> <b>laws,</b> which could not be broken: a faith which, my friends, we must do our best to keep up in ourselves, and in our children after us. For it is very easy to lose it, this faith in God. We are tempted to lose it, all our lives long.|$|E
60|$|The Romans seem to {{have done}} {{something}} toward the draining and embanking of this dismal swamp. To them is attributed the car-dyke, or catch-water drain, which runs for many miles from Peterborough northward into Lincolnshire, cutting off the land waters which flow down from the wolds above. To them, too, is to be attributed the old Roman bank, or 'vallum,' along the sea-face of the marshlands, marked to this day by the names of Walsoken, Walton, and Walpoole. But the English invaders were incapable of following out, even of preserving, any public works. Each village was isolated by its own 'march' of forest; each yeoman all but isolated by the 'eaves-drip,' or green lane round his farm. Each 'cared for his own things, and none for those of others;' and gradually, during the early Middle Age, the fen--save those old Roman villages--returned to its primaeval jungle, under the neglect of a race which caricatured local self-government into public anarchy, and looked on every stranger as an alien enemy, who might be lawfully slain, if he came through the forest without calling aloud or blowing a horn. Till late years, the English feeling against the stranger lasted harsh and strong. The farmer, strong <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>laws</b> of settlement, tried at once to pass him into the next parish. The labourer, not being versed in law, hove half a brick at him, or hooted him through the town. It was in the fens, perhaps, that the necessity of combined effort for fighting the brute powers of nature first awakened public spirit, and associate labour, {{and the sense of}} a common interest between men of different countries and races.|$|E
60|$|High {{mass was}} said in the chapel of the convent, and Columbus {{received}} the consecrated bread {{from the hands of}} Fray Juan Perez, in humble reliance on the all-seeing providence of God, and with a devout dependence on his fostering protection. All who were about to embark with the admiral imitated his example, communing in his company; for that was a period when the wire-drawn conclusions of man had not yet begun so far to supplant the faith and practices of the earlier church as to consider its rites as the end of religion, but he was still content to regard them as its means. Many a rude sailor, whose ordinary life might not have been either saintly or even free from severe censure, knelt that day at the altar, in devout dependence on God, with feelings, for the moment, that at least placed him on the highway to grace; and it would be presumptuous to suppose that the omniscient Being to whom his offerings were made, did not regard his ignorance with commiseration, and even look upon his superstition with pity. We scoff at the prayers of those who are in danger, without reflecting that they are a homage to the power of God, and are apt to fancy that these passages in devotion are mere mockery, because the daily mind and the ordinary life are not always elevated to the same standard of godliness and purity. It would be more humble to remember the general infirmities of the race; to recollect, that as none are perfect, the question is reduced to one of degree; and to bear in mind, that the Being who reads the heart, may accept of any devout petitions, even though they come from those who are not disposed habitually to walk <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>laws.</b> These passing but pious emotions are the workings of the Spirit, since good can come from no other source; and it is as unreasonable as it is irreverent to imagine that the Deity will disregard, altogether, the effects of his own grace, however humble.|$|E

6000|$|Look at the heaven above us. Does {{not that}} witness against us? Has it not seen, for now fifteen hundred years and more, God's {{goodness}} to us, {{and to our}} forefathers? All things have changed; language, manners, customs, religion. We have changed our place, as the Israelites did; and dwell in a different land from our forefathers: but that sky abides for ever. That same sun, that moon, those stars shone down upon our heathen forefathers, when the Lord chose them, and brought {{them out of the}} German forests into this good land of England, that they might learn to worship no more the sun, and the moon, and the storm, and the thunder-cloud, but to worship Him, the living God who made all heaven and earth. That sky looked down upon our forefathers, when the first missionaries baptized them into the Church of Christ, and England became a Christian land, and made a covenant with God and Christ for ever to walk <b>in</b> <b>His</b> <b>laws</b> which He has set before us. From that heaven, ever since, hath God been sending rain and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness, for a witness of His love and fostering care; prospering us, whensoever we have kept His laws, above all other nations upon earth. Shall not that heaven witness against us? Into that heaven ascended Christ the Lord, that He might fill all things with His power and His rule, and might send from thence on us His Holy Spirit, the Spirit whom we worship this day, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord. By that same Spirit, and by none other, have been thought all the noble thoughts which Englishmen ever thought. By that Spirit have been spoken all the noble words which Englishmen ever spoke. By that Spirit have been done all the noble deeds which Englishmen have ever done. To that Spirit we owe all that is truly noble, truly strong, truly stable, in our English life. It is He that has given us power to get wealth, to keep wealth, to use wealth. And if we begin to deny that, as we are inclined to do now-a- days; if we lay our grand success and prosperity to the account of our own cleverness, our own ability; if we say, as Moses warned the Israelites they would say, in the days of their success and prosperity, not--"It is God who has given us power to get wealth," [...] but--"Mine arm, and the might of my hand, has gotten me this wealth;"--in plain words--If we begin to do what we are all too apt to do just now, to worship our own brains instead of God: then the heaven above us will witness against us, this Whitsuntide above all seasons in the year; and say--Into heaven the Lord ascended who died for you on the Cross. From heaven He sent down gifts for you, and your forefathers, even while you were His enemies, that the Lord God might dwell among you. And behold, instead of thanking God, fearing God, and confessing that you are nothing, and God is all, you talk as if you were the arbiters of your own futures, the makers of your own gifts. Instead of giving God the glory, you take the glory to yourselves. Instead of declaring the glory of God, like the heavens, and shewing his handiwork, like the stars, you shew forth your own glory and boast of your own handiwork. Beware, and fear; as your forefathers feared, and lived, because they gave the glory to God.|$|E
