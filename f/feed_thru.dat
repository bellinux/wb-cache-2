40|$|The AHV Series of DC/DC {{converters}} {{are designed}} to replace the AHE/ATO family of converters in applications requiring compliance to MIL-STD- 704 A through E, in particular the input surge requirement of 80 V specified to withstand transient input voltage of 80 V. No input voltage or output power derating is necessary over the full military temperature range. These converters are packaged in an extremely rugged, low profile package that meets all requirements of MIL-STD- 883 and MIL-PRF- 38534. Parallel seam weld sealing {{and the use of}} ceramic pin <b>feed</b> <b>thru</b> seals assure long term hermeticity after exposure to extended temperature cycling. The basic circuit is a push-pull forward topology using power MOSFET switches. The nominal switchin...|$|E
40|$|A {{windscreen}} {{has been}} developed that features two advantages favorable for the measurement of outdoor infrasound. First, the sub-surface location, with {{the top of the}} windscreen flush with the ground surface, minimizes the mean velocity of the impinging wind. Secondly, the windscreen material (closed cell polyurethane foam) has a sufficiently low acoustic impedance (222 times that of air) and wall thickness (0. 0127 m) to provide a transmission coefficient of nearly unity over the infrasonic frequency range (0 - 20 Hz). The windscreen, a tightly-sealed box having internal dimensions of 0. 3048 x 0. 3048 x 0. 3556 m, contains a microphone, preamplifier, and a cable <b>feed</b> <b>thru</b> to an external power supply. Provisions are made for rain drainage and seismic isolation. A three-element array, configured as an equilateral triangle with 30. 48 m spacing and operating continuously in the field, periodically receives highly coherent signals attributed to emissions from atmospheric turbulence. The time delays between infrasonic signals received at the microphones permit determination of the bearing and elevation of the sources, which correlate well with locations of pilot reports (PIREPS) within a 320 km radius about the array. The test results are interpreted to yield spectral information on infrasonic emissions from clear air turbulence...|$|E
50|$|In 2003, Evans put his {{graphic design}} skills {{to use for}} Disonance Recordings. He created Resonance Images to offer album artwork, event photography, and {{merchandise}} design (this effectively created DR, or Disonance/Resonance). In response {{to the needs of}} this emerging regime of artists taking back control of the recording industry and regaining control of their own creative futures, Evans knew they would require the same access to the quality of imagery and services that the major labels had if they were ever {{to have a chance to}} compete. Disonance Recordings took this a step further and initiated the Guerilla Recordings project in 2009 to assist aspiring artists to D.Y.I. and do it right, without having to rely on corrupt labels.

40|$|There are {{numerous}} engineering design problems where {{the use of}} wires to transfer power and communicate data thru {{the walls of a}} structure is prohibitive or significantly difficult that it may require a complex design. Such systems may be concerned with the leakage of chemicals or gasses, loss of pressure or vacuum, as well as difficulties in providing adequate thermal or electrical insulation. Moreover, <b>feeding</b> wires <b>thru</b> a wall of a structure reduces the strength of the structure and makes the structure susceptibility to cracking due to fatigue that can result from cyclic loading. Two areas have already been identified to require a wireless alternative capability and they include (a) the container of the Mars Sample Return Mission will need the use of wireless sensors to sense pressure leak and to avoid potential contamination; and (b) the Navy is seeking the capability to communicate with the crew or the instrumentation inside marine structures without the use of wires that will weaken the structure. The idea of using elastic or acoustic waves to transfer power was suggested recently by Y. Hu, et al. 1. However, the disclosed model was developed directly from the wave equation and the linear equations of piezoelectricity. This model restricted by an inability to incorporate head and tail mass and account for loss in all the mechanisms. In addition there is no mechanism for connecting the model to actual power processing circuitry (diode bridge, capacitors, rectifiers etc.). An alternative approach which is to be presented is a network equivalent circuit that can easily be modified to account for additional acoustic elements an...|$|R

Using physical feedthroughs in such systems may make them susceptible to leakage of chemicals or gasses, loss of pressure or vacuum, as well as difficulties in providing adequate thermal or electrical insulation. Moreover, <b>feeding</b> wires <b>thru</b> a wall of a structure reduces the strength of the structure and makes the structure prone to cracking due to fatigue that can result from cyclic loading and stress concentrations. One area that has already been identified to require a wireless alternative to electrical feedthroughs is the container of the Mars Sample Return Mission, which will need wireless sensors to sense a pressure leak and to avoid potential contamination. The idea of using elastic or acoustic waves to transfer power was suggested recently by [Y. Hu, et al., July 2003]. This system allows for the avoidance of cabling or wiring. The technology is applicable to the transfer of power for actuation, sensing and other tasks inside any sealed container or vacuum/pressure vessel. An alternative approach to the modeling presented previously [Sherrit et a., 2005] used network analysis to solve the same problem in a clear and expandable manner. Experimental tests on three different designs of these devices were performed. The three designs used different methods of coupling the piezoelectric element to the wall. In the first test the piezoelectric material was bolted using a backing structure. In the second test the piezoelectric was clamped after the application of grease and finally the piezoelectric element was attached using a conductive epoxy. The mechanical clamp with grease produced the highest measured efficiency of 53 % however this design was the least practical from a fabrication viewpoint. The power transfer efficiency of conductive epoxy joint was 40 % and the stress bolts (12 %) ...|$|R
40|$|TutorialSqueeze Film Dampers (SFDs) are {{effective}} means to ameliorate rotor vibration amplitudes and to suppress instabilities in rotor-bearing systems. A SFD {{is not an}} off-the-shelf mechanical element but tailored to a particular rotor-bearing system as its design must satisfy a desired damping ratio; if too low, the damper is ineffective, whereas if damping is too large, it locks the system aggravating the system response. In many cases, SFDs are also employed to control the placement of (rigid body) critical speeds displacing the machine operation into a speed range with effective structural isolation. Industry demands well-engineered SFDs with a low footprint to reduce cost, maintenance, weight, and space while pushing for higher operating shaft speeds to increase power output. Compact aero jet engines implement ultra-short length SFDs (L/D ? 0. 2) to satisfy stringent weight and space demands with low parts count. A manufacturer, {{as part of a}} business plan to develop and commercialize energy efficient aircraft gas turbine engines, supported a multiple?year project to test novel SFD design spaces. In spite of the myriad of analyses and experimental results reported in the literature, there has not been to date a concerted effort to investigate the dynamic forced performance of a SFD through its many configurations: open ends vis-?-vis sealed ends conditions, and supply conditions with a fluid plenum or deep groove vis-?-vis feed holes directly impinging into the film land. This lecture presents experimental results obtained with a dedicated rig to evaluate short length SFDs operating under large dynamic loads (2. 2 kN ? 500 lbf) that produced circular and elliptical whirl orbits of varying amplitude, centered and off-centered. The lecture first reviews how SFDs work, placing emphasis on certain effects largely overlooked by practitioners who often regard the SFD as a simple non-rotating journal bearing. These effects are namely fluid inertia amplification in the supply or discharge grooves, pervasive air ingestion at high whirl frequencies, and effective end sealing means to enhance damping. The bulk of the lecture presents for various SFD configurations comparisons of experimentally identified damping (C) and inertia or added mass (M) coefficients versus amplitude of motion (orbit size) and static eccentricity position, both ranging from small to large; as large as the film clearance! The experiments, conducted over six plus years of continued work give an answer to the following fundamental practitioners? questions: (a) Dampers don?t have a stiffness (static centering capability), how come? (b) Why is there fluid inertia or added mass in a damper? Isn?t a damper a purely viscous element? (c) How much do the damping and added mass change when the film length is halved? What about increasing the clearance to twice its original magnitude? (d) How much more damping is available if the damper has end seals? (e) Is a damper with feed holes as effective as one containing a groove that ensures lubricant pools to fill the film? What if a hole plugs, is a damper still effective? (f) Does a flooded damper offer same force coefficients as one lubricated <b>thru</b> <b>feed</b> holes? (g) Do the amplitude and shape of whirl motion affect the damper force coefficients? (h) What happens if the damper operates largely off-centered; does its performance become nonlinear? (i) Is air ingestion a persistent issue with an open ends SFD? (j) How do predictions from accepted engineering practice SFD models correlate with the experimental record? Is an idealized SFD geometry representative of actual practice...|$|R
