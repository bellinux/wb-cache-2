40|$|Eighty {{samples of}} bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were {{obtained}} from the total of 48 patients (22 females and 26 males) and analyzed. Eighteen of those patients were organ transplant recipients. The relationship between polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) count in <b>direct</b> <b>sample</b> and semi quantitative Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial content were analyzed in BALF samples. PMN count in <b>direct</b> <b>sample</b> and Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial content of the final microbiological report was compared as well. On the total number of samples PMN count in <b>direct</b> <b>samples</b> of BALF was statistically significant regarding the presence of Gram-positive bacteria in the same sample; it was nearly significant regarding the presence of Gram-negative bacteria; and it was statistically significant for the total bacterial content. If BALF samples are divided into those obtained from organ-transplant and those obtained from non- -organ-transplant patients, positive, statistically significant relationship is found in the organ-transplant group, more specifically for the relationship between PMNs and total bacterial content. When PMN count in <b>direct</b> microbiological <b>sample</b> was compared with the results of the final microbiological report, statistically significant relationship was found neither with respect to all BALF samples, nor after dividing them into »organ-transplant« and »non-organ-transplant« group.

The existence of a <b>direct</b> <b>sampler</b> offers a host of new possibilities for the use of G-Wishart variates.

40|$|Abstract—The <b>direct</b> and {{indirect}} <b>sample</b> transfer techniques for measuring airborne inorganic fibres concentrations were studied by TEM for airborne rockwool fibres, chrysotile, amosite and tungsten oxide whiskers. The number and mass concentrations of fibres with aspect ratios> 5, prepared {{by these two}} techniques for fibres longer than 0. 5 um and 5 urn, and the aspect ratios were evaluated and compared. It {{was found that the}} indirect sample transfer technique affects the fibre size distribution of different materials differently, and that the mass concentrations did not relate to fibre number concentrations of ambient air, irrespective of the sample transfer method used or the materials studied. It is concluded that the <b>direct</b> <b>sample</b> transfer method incorporating the etching stage should be preferred over the indirect method. Moreover, a need for an extra stage in-between the etching and carbon coating stages for the <b>direct</b> <b>sample</b> transfer method is suggested; this would be a stage where soluble materials could be removed...|$|R
