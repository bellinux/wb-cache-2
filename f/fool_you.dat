It's not just {{that the world has}} said Pinkerton isn't worth a shit, but that the Blue album wasn't either. It was a fluke. It was the [...] video. I'm a shitty songwriter." [...] In 2001, he told Entertainment Weekly: [...] "It's a hideous record... It was such a hugely painful mistake that happened in front {{of hundreds of thousands of}} people and continues to happen on a grander and grander scale and just won't go away. It's like getting really drunk at a party and spilling your guts in front of everyone and feeling incredibly great and cathartic about it, and then waking up the next morning and realizing what a complete <b>fool</b> <b>you</b> made of yourself." ...|$|E
500|$|Hoffman {{explained}} {{the key to}} his changeup was how he pinched the seam of the ball with his thumb and index finger as he released it. He threw the changeup with the arm speed used to throw a fastball, and the spin and movement of the ball looked the same to the batter. His changeup ranged from 73–76mph. Bruce Bochy, who managed Hoffman for over a decade with the Padres, said of Hoffman's changeup: [...] "He pitched so well off his fastball [...] couldn't just sit on it every pitch." [...] "You could be sitting on [...] and still not be successful with it", says former player Mark Sweeney. It was the arm action on the change up and the late sink just before it reached the plate that allowed Hoffman to stay successful over the years. With opponents flailing to slow down their swings, teammates nicknamed Hoffman's changeup The Bugs Bunny Pitch after a famous Bugs Bunny cartoon episode. [...] "Some [...] <b>fool</b> <b>you.</b> Some guys overpower you. Hoffman embarrasses you", said former rival and later teammate Mike Piazza. After striking out on a changeup to end the game against Hoffman, Dodger catcher Paul Lo Duca said, [...] "It's like it has a parachute on it." [...] As Hoffman lost velocity on his fastball throughout his career, he compensated by maintaining a notable speed differential between that pitch and his changeup. He initially kept the grip of his changeup a secret. [...] "I was a little weird about it", Hoffman said. [...] "I didn't like talking about how I threw the change. I didn't want people to see how I gripped the ball. I thought I'd be giving away something to the hitters." [...] Later in his career, he posed for pictures of his grip, figuring everyone had seen it.|$|E

2500|$|During {{their third}} period, {{beginning}} in the 1970s, Sun Ra and the Arkestra settled down into a relatively conventional sound, often incorporating swing standards, although their records and concerts were still highly eclectic and energetic, and typically included at least one lengthy, semi-improvised percussion jam. Sun Ra was explicitly asserting a continuity with the ignored jazz tradition: [...] "They tried to <b>fool</b> <b>you,</b> now I got to school you, about jazz, all about jazz" [...] he rapped, framing the inclusion of pieces by Fletcher Henderson and Jelly Roll Morton.|$|E

2500|$|I {{am trying}} here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish {{thing that people}} often say about Him: I'm ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don't accept his claim to be God. [...] That {{is the one thing}} we must not say. [...] A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. [...] He would either be a lunatic — on the level with the man who says he is a poached egg — or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. [...] Either this man was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or {{something}} worse. You can shut him up for a <b>fool,</b> <b>you</b> can spit at him and kill him as a demon or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God, but let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about his being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to. ... Now it seems to me obvious that He was neither a lunatic nor a fiend: and consequently, however strange or terrifying or unlikely it may seem, I have to accept the view that He was and is God.|$|E
