50|$|Electro{{polishing}}, {{also known}} as <b>electrochemical</b> <b>polishing,</b> anodic polishing or electrolytic polishing (especially in the metallography field), is an electrochemical process that removes material from a metallic workpiece.

50|$|Application of FIM, like FEM, {{is limited}} by the {{materials}} which can be fabricated {{in the shape of a}} sharp tip, can be used in an ultra high vacuum (UHV) environment, and can tolerate the high electrostatic fields. For these reasons, refractory metals with high melting temperature (e.g. W, Mo, Pt, Ir) are conventional objects for FIM experiments. Metal tips for FEM and FIM are prepared by electropolishing (<b>electrochemical</b> <b>polishing)</b> of thin wires. However, these tips usually contain many asperities. The final preparation procedure involves the in situ removal of these asperities by field evaporation just by raising the tip voltage. Field evaporation is a field induced process which involves the removal of atoms from the surface itself at very high field strengths and typically occurs in the range 2-5 V/Å. The effect of the field in this case is to reduce the effective binding energy of the atom to the surface and to give, in effect, a greatly increased evaporation rate relative to that expected at that temperature at zero fields. This process is self-regulating since the atoms that are at positions of high local curvature, such as adatoms or ledge atoms, are removed preferentially. The tips used in FIM is sharper (tip radius is 100~300 Å) compared to those used in FEM experiments (tip radius ~1000 Å).|$|E

The present research uses experimental combined analysis approaches. A specially designed experimental setup assembling a tribometer and a potentiostat was used to carry out Ta ECMP. The friction force and electrochemical reactions were measured simultaneously. Using this setup, we found the factors which affected the frictional behaviors of Ta during ECMP. The technique of single frequency electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was employed to investigate the material removal mechanisms in Ta ECMP. The results presented the competing mechanisms of removal and formation of a surface oxide layer of Ta. In order to further the investigation in a nanoscale, the atomic force microscope (AFM) was used to measure the material removal rate. The Preston equation for the Ta ECMP was established. A new methodology was developed to study the oxidation state and process of Ta during ECMP. Through comparing the material removal rate measured by using the AFM and the calculated one via the Faraday?s law, the distribution of the Ta suboxides and pentoxide, as well as the oxidation process, was revealed. The oxidation process was strongly dependent of the applied anodic potential, thickness of the oxide layer, mechanical forces, and surface orientation.

Typically the TNA samples with tube length of approximately 15 μm were obtained after 2 h of anodization process. It is evident that increasing the TNA length leads to the increase of short-circuit photocurrent density due to the higher surface area available for dye adsorption. The TNA foils were then carefully washed with deionized water to remove the surface residual electrolyte in the nano-tube arrays. Such prepared TNA samples were then annealed at 450 °C for 3 h with a heating rate of 1 °C/min in order to transform the TNA from amorphous to anatase crystalline phase.|$|R
