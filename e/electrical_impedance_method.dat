Four different particle size measurement techniques were {{used to measure the}} size of fat globules in poorly homogenised UHT milk processed in a UHT pilot plant. The thickness of the cream layer that formed during storage was negatively correlated with homogenisation pressure. It was positively correlated with the mass mean diameter and the percentage volume of particles between 1. 5 and 2 mu m diameter, as determined by laser light scattering using the Malvern Mastersizer. Also, the thickness of the cream layer was positively correlated with the volume mode diameter and the percentage volume of particles between 1. 5 and 2 mu m diameter, as determined by electrical impedance using the Coulter Counter. The cream layer thickness did not correlate significantly with the Coulter Counter measurements of volume mean diameter, or volume percentages of particles between 2 and 5 mu m or 5 and 10 mu m diameter.

40|$|There is a {{need for}} an {{objective}} and non-invasive method for assessing reactions in the human skin and oral mucosa, particularly for weak reactions. During the past few decades, several methods of measuring irritant responses have indeed been developed for the skin and to some extent also for the oral mucosa. The focus of this thesis is upon a new measurement system based on electrical impedance, which reflects structural and chemical changes in living tissues. The system is an improvement over earlier impedance techniques, and measures magnitude and phase of impedance in the frequency range 1 kHz to 1 MHz at 5 depth settings. From the raw data, four indices are calculated, representing most of the information in compressed form, and also reducing inter-individual and inter-site variation by normalisation. The method has been used to study skin irritation induced by various concentration of sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS). Results have been compared with visual scoring as well as with those of other bioengineering techniques - transepidermal water loss (TEWL), electrical capacitance moist measurements (ECM), and laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF). The results show that electrical impedance is at least as sensitive as other bioengineering techniques, and more sensitive than visual scoring. The later was confirmed in a study using low concentration of SLS, which demonstrated that the <b>electrical</b> <b>impedance</b> <b>method</b> is a delicate technique for detecting responses induced by SLS, when these are weak enough to be macroscopically negative. Furthermore, a good correlation was found between the severity of the changes observed visually, the histopathological alterations, and changes in the four electrical impedance indices. We have also found the method to be highly sensitive for detection of changes in the lipid content in the stratum comeum. Other irritants producing different types of histological skin responses have been shown to create their own distinctive impedance index patterns. Furthermore, the reduced data sets {{in the form of the}} four impedance indices contain sufficient information for classifying different responses of the skin, although additional information may be extracted from the complete spectrum. The impedance technique, can also be used in the oral mucosa, and has been shown capable of detecting mucosal responses induced by SLS in the invisible or barely visible range. Since different anatomical regions display typical baseline values for the skin as well as the oral mucosa it is important to use contra lateral reference sites from the same anatomical location or even better to follow a site over a period of time before and after exposure to a test agent. If references are not available, e. g. in situations where the entire skin or mocosa is affected, established baseline values for different sites in the skin and the oral cavity may be substituted. Such values have now been provided for both the skin and the oral mucosa. The electrical impedance technique seems to be a powerful tool for quantification and classification of reactions in both the skin and the oral mucosa...|$|E
40|$|Evaluation {{of blood}} count with {{differential}} leukocyte budget {{is a basic}} haematological test. From a diagnostic {{point of view is}} the information about the exact number of leukocytes and their percentage representation in the patient's blood very valuable as well as a range of informations on the effect of disease states. In my bachelor´s thesis I devote to instrumentative and microscopic examination of the differential leukocyte budget and their comparing in terms of difficulty and obtaining the most accurate results. Nowadays, with the development of science and technology are used to determine differential leukocyte budget modern haematological analyzers, but the manual setting by using a microscope remains the basis of good work in haematological laboratory. The goal of each laboratory determination is to produce accurate results for clinical use. The analyzes are mostly automatic and their advantages are faster pace of analysis, accuracy, reliability and need of small volume of sample. The main objective of my thesis is to evaluate the distinction by using two different methods, microscopical and instrumentative. The thesis is traditionally divided into theoretical and practical part. The theoretic part of the thesis explains the meaning of the differential leukocyte count, there is a detailed morfology description of different leukocyte types. I mentioned the non-neoplastic and neoplastic changes in the number of leukocytes. Last but not least, there is an overview of laboratory methods that are used for blood counts in routine haematological laboratory. To determine differential leukocyte budget is used optical method, <b>electrical</b> <b>impedance</b> <b>method,</b> cytochemical method or digital morphology. The practical part describes the examination methodology of the differential leukocyte budget, which I have used in this work. I made a blood smear by microscopic assessment, which I dyed according the instructions. Preparates are viewed with oil immersion under a light microscope. To record different leukocyte types are used recording devices - leucomats. I made automatic assessment of differential leukocyte budget in 5 - population haematological analyzer Sysmex XE - 2100 based on the principle of flow cytometry with sample measurements from the feeder closed or open way. Examination of differential leukocyte budgets was realized in biochemical and haematological laboratory synlab czech s. r. o in Czech Budweis. Here I investigated 100 randomly selected patient samples of venous blood under the proffesional supervision and I compared the differential leukocyte budgets and differences between methods. I investigated samples in April and May of 2012. Results obtained by microscopic examination and by measurements on analyzer were statistically compiled into tables and graphs in a computer program. In the graphical representation comparing the differential cell counts in 100 samples of the budget of the analyzer under a microscope. I set the hypothesis that the numbers of microscopic differentials equal to those of the automatic analyzer. Laboratory results were obtained by the measurement and that results were interpreted after consultation with the supervisor. Based on the results, I rejected the hypothesis. Own laboratory investigation showed that classic microscopic assessment has essential importance in the analysis of pathological cells. It also depends on the experience of the laboratory worker. The advantages of the haematologic analyzer are particularly rapid analysis, accuracy and need of small volume of biological sample. During the practical part of the thesis I gained practical skills in working with biological material and I embraced the principles of laboratory methods. The results of my work can be used widely in clinical laboratories in assessing {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} relationships between monitored by analytical methods...|$|E

40|$|Within {{the field}} of {{ecosystem}} science, substantial {{progress has been made}} towards our knowledge of the factors which shape the global distribution of vegetation. However, factors which control the biogeography of belowground vegetation structure and function remain less understood than their aboveground counterpart. Vegetation types can differ substantially in terms of belowground processes such as root growth, root turnover, and resulting vertical root distributions. Fine roots provide an exchange surface, allowing transport of water and nutrients to the leaves. On the other hand they also represent a significant sink for photosynthetically fixed carbon to the soil in terms of maintenance and growth. Overall, root processes have a major influence on fluxes of water, carbon and nutrients within ecosystems. In this thesis, an <b>electrical</b> <b>impedance</b> <b>method</b> was used to determine the area of ‘active’ root in contact with the soil for the purpose of absorption. These measurements were compared to the leaf area of the trees, for the first time allowing the aboveground and the belowground resource exchange areas of plant to be contrasted. This approach was first developed to compare the exchange surface areas of leaves and roots within a Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) managed forest, making measurements in adjacent stands of differing tree density, but identical in age. Stem density was found to significantly influence the proportion of absorbing root area relative to leaves. Following the successful test of the method, it was used to compare the resource exchange areas of eight stands of forest and savanna vegetation in central Brazil. Across a broad gradient of vegetation structure, the results showed progressively more investment in fine root area relative to leaf area across the transition from dense forest to open savanna. However, a contrasting result showed that the forests had a higher absorbing root area to leaf area ratio than savannas. Furthermore, these measured ratios were strongly correlated with tree height across the eight structurally contrasting stands. It appears that absorbing root area index provides a physiologically meaningful way of characterising belowground water uptake ability, it is possible that excessive investment in fine root area, relative to leaf area, may reflect differences in the requirement for nutrient uptake in poor soils. Complementary to the analysis of root absorbing area, measurements of root activity and belowground carbon cycling were made by focussing on two of the eight tropical study sites. Here, the carbon costs of root growth and respiration were quantified to develop a belowground carbon budget for two structurally contrasting Brazilian savannas, using soil respiration measurements and a root presence/absence manipulation experiment. Annual estimates showed that at least 60 % of the total CO 2 efflux from the soil was contributed by autotrophic processes, with this value rising to 80 % during the dry season. Seasonal fluctuations of soil respiration were strongly correlated with soil moisture for both the autotrophic (R 2 = 0. 79, pvalue< 0. 05) and heterotrophic (R 2 = 0. 90, p-value< 0. 05) components, with maximum flux rates corresponding with 16. 4 and 17. 7 % soil moisture content respectively. Furthermore, autotrophic respiration was found to varied with phonological patterns of fine root growth (R 2 = 0. 80, p-value< 0. 05). It follows that, the way in which phenological processes respond to a changing climate is of potential importance within seasonally dry regions. Diurnal fluctuations of heterotrophic CO 2 efflux were correlated with soil temperature (R 2 = 0. 74, p-value< 0. 05), demonstrating a Q 10 value of 1. 6 across both sites. In contrast, total soil CO 2 efflux was not correlated with temperature (p-value= 0. 31), suggesting that autotrophic respiration is predominantly limited by substrate supply.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the design of}} a novel handheld electrode probe and measurement system for use in rotational <b>electrical</b> <b>impedance</b> myography (EIM), which is a method for diagnosing neuromuscular disease. The probe can be controlled from a PC via USB and uses an array of small electrode cells that can be connected together into larger electrodes with the help of crosspoint switches. A measurement system capable of fast multifrequency impedance measurement has also been developed. The two systems have performed well, with measurements being very close to those achieved by more traditional <b>electrical</b> <b>impedance</b> myography <b>methods.</b> by Michael Scharfstein.

Stroke has a high mortality and disability rate and should be rapidly diagnosed to improve prognosis. Diagnosing stroke {{is not a problem}} for hospitals with CT,MRI, and other imaging devices but is difficult for community hospitals without these devices. Based on the mechanism that the <b>electrical</b> <b>impedance</b> of the two hemispheres of a normal human head is basically symmetrical and a stroke can alter this symmetry, a fast <b>electrical</b> <b>impedance</b> imaging <b>method</b> called symmetrical <b>electrical</b> <b>impedance</b> tomography (SEIT) is proposed. In this technique, <b>electrical</b> <b>impedance</b> tomography (EIT) data measured from the undamaged craniocerebral hemisphere (CCH) is regarded as reference data for the remaining EIT data measured from the other CCH for difference imaging to identify the differences in resistivity distribution between the two CCHs.
