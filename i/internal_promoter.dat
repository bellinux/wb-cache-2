50|$|SINEs are {{classified}} as non-LTR retrotransposons {{because they do not}} contain long terminal repeats (LTRs). There are three types of SINEs common to vertebrates and invertebrates: CORE-SINEs, V-SINEs, and AmnSINEs. SINEs have 50-500 base pair internal regions which contain a tRNA-derived segment with A and B boxes that serve as an <b>internal</b> <b>promoter</b> for RNA polymerase III.|$|E
50|$|The isoforms {{are formed}} by {{different}} mechanisms. The beta and the gamma isoforms are generated by multiple splicing of intron 9, {{which leads to}} a different C-terminus. Furthermore, the usage of an <b>internal</b> <b>promoter</b> in intron 4 causes the ∆133 and ∆160 isoforms, which lack the TAD domain and a part of the DBD. Moreover, alternative initiation of translation at codon 40 or 160 bear the ∆40p53 and ∆160p53 isoforms.|$|E

[...] The other mammalian isoform of the receptor, Rev-erbβ is encoded by another gene on chromosome 3. In addition, there is one non-mammalian homolog, the ecdysone-regulated gene E75, which is present in Drosophila and C. elegans. The Rev-erbα gene itself has multiple transcripts. Two promoters govern {{the expression of the}} Rev-erbα gene in human and rat, generating two mRNA isoforms. The full-length isoform encodes a 614-amino acid protein, while a second isoform is generated from an <b>internal</b> <b>promoter</b> and produces a protein that is shorter by 106 amino acids. Both Rev-erbα mRNA isoforms contain E-boxes as well as Rev-erbα response elements, which means that they can be regulated in a circadian manner by the BMAL and Rev-erba proteins. In fact, both transcripts exhibit rhythmic expression in serum-synchronized fibroblasts.|$|E

Colitis-phage-specific mRNAs which hybridized to the insert were 0. 5 kb and 0. 7 kb long and were translated into lysozyme and a 20 -kDal protein, respectively, in a cell-free system derived from rice embryos.

40|$|Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an {{opportunistic}} pathogen {{of particular}} significance to cystic fibrosis patients. This bacterium produces the exopolysaccharide alginate, {{which is an}} indicator of poor prognosis for these patients. The proteins required for alginate polymerization and secretion are encoded by genes organized in a single operon; however, the existence of <b>internal</b> <b>promoters</b> has been reported. It has been proposed that these proteins form a multiprotein complex which extends from the inner to outer membrane. Here, experimental evidence supporting such a multiprotein complex was obtained via mutual stability analysis, pulldown assays, and coimmunoprecipitation. The impact {{of the absence of}} single proteins or subunits on this multiprotein complex, i. e., on the stability of potentially interacting proteins, as well as on alginate production was investigated. Deletion of algK in an alginate-overproducing strain, PDO 300, interfered with the polymerization of alginate, suggesting that in the absence of AlgK, the polymerase and copolymerase subunits, Alg 8 and Alg 44, are destabilized. Based on mutual stability analysis, interactions between AlgE (outer membrane), AlgK (periplasm), AlgX (periplasm), Alg 44 (inner membrane), Alg 8 (inner membrane), and AlgG (periplasm) were proposed. Coimmunoprecipitation using a FLAG-tagged variant of AlgE further demonstrated its interaction with AlgK. Pulldown assays using histidine-tagged AlgK showed that AlgK interacts with AlgX, which in turn was also copurified with histidine-tagged Alg 44. Detection of AlgG and AlgE in PAO 1 supported the existence of <b>internal</b> <b>promoters</b> controlling expression of the respective genes. Overall experimental evidence was provided for the existence of a multiprotein complex required for alginate polymerization and secretion. Full Tex...|$|R
50|$|PKMζ is the {{independent}} catalytic domain of PKCζ and, lacking an autoinhibitory regulatory {{domain of the}} full-length PKCζ, is constitutively and persistently active, without the need of a second messenger. It was originally thought of as being a cleavage product of full-length PKCζ, an atypical isoform of protein kinase C (PKC). Like other PKC isoforms, PKCζ is a serine/threonine kinase that adds phosphate groups to target proteins. It is atypical in that unlike other PKC isoforms, PKCζ does not require calcium or diacylglycerol (DAG) to become active, but rather relies on a different second messenger, presumably generated through a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) pathway. It is now known that PKMζ is {{not the result of}} cleavage of full-length PKCζ, but rather, in the mammalian brain, is translated from its own brain-specific mRNA, that is transcribed by an <b>internal</b> <b>promoter</b> within the PKCζ gene. The promoter for full-length PKCζ is largely inactive in the forebrain and so PKMζ is the dominant form of ζ in the forebrain and the only PKM that is translated from its own mRNA.|$|E
5000|$|SINEs or Short Interspersed Nuclear Elements are {{sequences}} of non-coding DNA present at high frequencies in various eukaryotic genomes. They are {{a class of}} retrotransposons, DNA elements that amplify themselves throughout eukaryotic genomes, often through RNA intermediates. Short-interspersed nuclear elements are characterized by their size and method of retrotransposition. The literature differs {{on the length of}} the SINEs but there is a general consensus that they often range in length from about 100 to 700 base pairs (more or less, arbitrary cut-offs). Short-interspersed nuclear elements are transcribed by RNA polymerase III which is known to transcribe ribosomal RNA and tRNA, two types of RNA vital to ribosomal assembly and mRNA translation. SINEs, like tRNAs and many small-nuclear RNAs possess an <b>internal</b> <b>promoter</b> and thus are transcribed differently than most protein-coding genes. [...] In other words, short-interspersed nuclear elements have their key promoter elements within the transcribed region itself. Though transcribed by RNA polymerase III, SINEs and other genes possessing internal promoters, recruit different transcriptional machinery and factors than genes possessing upstream promoters.|$|E
5000|$|OspE and OspF were {{initially}} identified in B. burgdorferi strain N40. [...] The ospE and ospF genes are structurally arranged in tandem as one transcriptional unit {{under the control}} of a common promoter. [...] Individual strains of B. burgdorferi carry multiple related copies of the ospEF locus, which are now collectively referred to as Erp (Osp'E'/F-like 'r'elated 'p'rotein) genes. In B. burgdoreri strains B31 and 297, most of the Erp loci occupy the same position on the multiple copies of the cp32 plasmid present in these strains. [...] Each locus consists of one or two Erp genes. When two genes are present, they are transcribed as one operon, although in some cases, an <b>internal</b> <b>promoter</b> in the first gene may also transcribe the second gene. [...] The presence of multiple Erp proteins was proposed to be important in allowing B. burgdorferi to evade killing by the alternative complement pathway of a broad range of potential animal hosts, as individual Erp proteins exhibited different binding patterns to the complement regulator factor H from different animals. [...] However, the presence of factor H was recently demonstrated to not be necessary to enable B. burgdorferi to infect mice, suggesting the Erp proteins have an additional function.|$|E

Tat vectors provided higher levels of gene expression than vectors with <b>internal</b> <b>promoters.</b> The HIV- 1 vector was also more efficient than Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) vectors for transduction of canine bone marrow mononuclear cells in vitro. Transplantation experiments in dogs with transduced autologous marrow cells confirmed the superiority of HIV- 1 vectors over MoMLV vectors for gene transfer into canine bone marrow cells.

The product of the gene in muscle, dystrophin, is a 427 kDa protein. The same gene encodes at least six additional products: two non-muscle dystrophin isoforms transcribed from promoters located in the 5 ′-end region of the gene and four smaller proteins transcribed from <b>internal</b> <b>promoters</b> located further downstream. Several other genes, encoding evolutionarily related proteins, have been identified. These include a structurally very similar gene in vertebrates encoding utrophin (DRP 1), which {{is closely related to}} dystrophin, and a number of small and simple genes in vertebrates or invertebrates encoding proteins similar to some of the small products of the DMD gene. We have isolated a sea urchin gene showing very strong sequence and structural homology with the DMD and utrophin genes. Sequence and intron/exon structure similarities suggest that this gene is related to a precursor of both the DMD gene and the gene encoding utrophin. The sea urchin gene has the unique complex structure of the DMD gene. There is at least one, and possibly more, product(s) transcribed from <b>internal</b> <b>promoters,</b> as well as a large product of> 300 kDa containing at least three of the four major domains of dystrophin. The small product seems to be evolutionarily related to Dp 116, one of the small products of the human DMD gene. Partial characterization of this gene helped us to construct an evolutionary tree connecting the vertebrate dystrophin gene family with related genes in invertebrates. The constructed evolutionary tree also implies that the vertebrate small and simple structured gene encoding a Dp 71 -like protein, called DRP 2, evolved from the dystrophin/utrophin ancestral large and complex gene by a duplication of {{only a small part of}} the gene...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMost short {{interspersed}} elements (SINEs) in eukaryotic genomes {{originate from}} tRNA and have <b>internal</b> <b>promoters</b> for RNA polymerase III. The promoter contains two boxes (A and B) spaced by ∼ 33 bp. We used oligonucleotide primers specific to these boxes to detect SINEs in the genomic DNA by {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR). Appropriate DNA fragments were revealed by PCR in 30 out of 35 eukaryotic species suggesting the wide distribution of SINEs. The PCR products were used for hybridization screening of genomic libraries which resulted in identification of four novel SINE families.

5000|$|Transposons and retrotransposons are {{valuable}} tools for unbiased gene discovery as mobile pieces of DNA used for gene disruption. Retrotransposons, such as LINEs (long interspersed nuclear elements), mobilize via a “copy and paste” mechanism and are abundant in many eukaryotic species. Several L1 retrotransposons have remained active in mice and humans. L1s contain a small <b>internal</b> <b>promoter</b> within a 5’ untranslated region to drive expression, two open reading frames (ORFs), and a 3’ untranslated region containing sequences for polyadenylation. The two ORFs encode proteins necessary for autonomous retrotransposition; ORF1 encodes an RNA-binding protein while ORF2 encodes a protein containing endonuclease (EN) and reverse transcriptase (RT) activity, which nick {{a site in}} DNA, then produce a copy via RT. These proteins exhibit an overwhelming specificity for binding to and acting on the transcript that encodes them, enabling near exclusive mobilization of the parental L1 RNA. Using the RT activity of the ORF2 protein, the transcribed L1 RNA is copied into DNA by a process termed target primed reverse transcription (TPRT), and integrated into the genome. Integration occurs with little bias for any particular genomic region, requiring a simple consensus sequence, 5’TTTT’A-3’ (along with minor variations of this sequence). Integrated L1 sequences are often truncated at the 5’ end, with an average total size of 1 Kb, many containing only 3’ terminal sequences.|$|E
5000|$|Most of the {{differences}} between the spumaviruses and the other retroviruses come from the life cycle. Some of the main differences are that FV buds from the endoplasmic reticulum instead of the plasma membrane; this difference gives FV a unique morphology. FV is characterized by an immature looking core with an electron lucent center with glycoprotein spikes on the surface. [...] FV replication more closely resembles the Hepadnaviridae, which are another family of reverse transcriptase encoding viruses. Reverse transcription of the genome occurs at a later step in the replication cycle, which results in the infectious particles having DNA rather than RNA, this also leads to less integration in the host genome. The DNA found is linear and the length of the genome. [...] The genome encodes the usual retroviral genes pol, gag, and env as well as two additional genes tas or bel-1 and bet. The role for bet is not quite clear, research has shown that it is dispensable for replication of the virus in tissue culture. The tas gene, however, is required for replication. It encodes a protein that functions in transactivating the long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter. [...] FV has a second promoter, the <b>internal</b> <b>promoter</b> (IP) which is located in the env gene. The IP drives expression of the tas and bet genes. The IP is also unique in that the virus has the capacity to transcribe mRNAs from it; usually the complex retroviruses exclusively express transcripts from the LTR. [...] The structural genes of FV are another one of its unique features. The Gag protein is not efficiently cleaved into the mature virus which lends to the immature morphology. The Pol precursor protein is only partially cleaved; the integrase domain is removed by viral protease. As in other retroviruses, the Env protein is cleaved into surface and transmembrane domains but the FV Env protein also contains an endoplasmic reticulum retention signal which is part of why the virus buds from the endoplasmic reticulum. Another area of difference between FV and other retroviruses is the possibility of recycling the core once the virus is in the cell.|$|E
40|$|The {{activity}} of the Moloney murine leukemia virus promoter is restricted in mouse embryonic stem cells. Gene expression with retrovirus vectors can be achieved in these cells if internal promoters are used. To address the possible influence of the viral enhancer sequences on expression from the <b>internal</b> <b>promoter,</b> we have constructed high-titer, self-inactivating retrovirus vectors which delete viral regulatory sequences upon integration in the host genome. We show that deleting most of the viral enhancer sequences has no significant effect on viral titer. This enhancer deletion leads to either an increase or {{a decrease in the}} amount of RNA transcribed from the <b>internal</b> <b>promoter,</b> but no consistent change can be found with any type of vector. The same changes in expression from the <b>internal</b> <b>promoter</b> observed in embryonic stem cells are also observed in 3 T 3 fibroblast cells, in which the viral promoter is active.

40|$|Simian {{and human}} foamy viruses (HFV and SFV), genetically related {{members of the}} {{spumavirus}} genus of retroviruses, have complex genome structures which encode the gag, pol, and env genes for virion proteins as well as additional open reading frames. One of these open reading frames is a viral transactivator, encoded by genes designated taf for SFV and bel- 1 for HFV, which augments transcription directed by the long terminal repeat (LTR) through cis-acting targets in the U 3 domain of the LTR. Recently, an internal transcriptional promoter has been identified in sequences within the 3 ' end of the HFV env gene (M. Lochelt, W. Muranyi, and R. M. Flugel, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 90 : 7317 - 7321, 1993). We have demonstrated by using transient expression assays in several tissue culture cell lines and by analyzing viral transcripts in infected cells that SFV- 1 from a rhesus macaque and SFV- 3 from an African green monkey also encode an <b>internal</b> <b>promoter</b> in the env gene. Transcription directed by the internal promoters of SFV- 1 and SFV- 3 is activated by the taf- 1 and taf- 3 gene products, respectively, in several cell types. The importance of a TATA box for the SFV- 1 <b>internal</b> <b>promoter</b> was established by site-specific mutagenesis, and the 5 ' ends of transcripts initiating in the <b>internal</b> <b>promoter</b> have been determined. cis-acting sequences in the SFV- 1 env gene required for the response to taf- 1 are contained within a 121 -bp element located 5 ' to the TATA box in the <b>internal</b> <b>promoter.</b> This taf- 1 -responsive element in the <b>internal</b> <b>promoter</b> functions in a position- and orientation-independent fashion in a heterologous promoter and thus has the properties of an enhancer which depends on taf- 1 activity. Alignments reveal that the SFV- 1 <b>internal</b> <b>promoter</b> and the SFV- 1 LTR have little sequence relatedness. Cross-transactivation {{studies show that the}} transactivators of SFV- 1 and HFV function on the <b>internal</b> <b>promoter</b> and LTR of the homologous virus but not on the heterologous virus. In summary, the genomes of simian and human foamy viruses direct viral transcription through both the promoter in the LTR and an <b>internal</b> <b>promoter</b> within the env gene, and each promoter contains unique enhancer-like elements regulated by the viral transactivator...|$|E
40|$|The {{transcription}} {{of genes}} carried by primate foamy viruses {{is dependent on}} two distinct promoter elements. These are the long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter, which regulates expression of the viral structural proteins, and a second <b>internal</b> <b>promoter,</b> located towards the 3 ′ end of the env gene, that directs expression of the viral auxiliary proteins. One of these auxiliary proteins is a potent transcriptional transactivator, termed Bel- 1 in human foamy virus (HFV) and Tas or Taf in the related simian foamy viruses, that is critical for foamy virus replication. Previously, it has been demonstrated that the LTR promoter element of HFV contains a DNA binding site for Bel- 1 that is critical for transcriptional activation (F. He, W. S. Blair, J. Fukushima, and B. R. Cullen, J. Virol. 70 : 3902 – 3908, 1996). Here, we extended this earlier work by using methylation interference analysis to identify and characterize the Bel- 1 DNA binding sites located in the HFV LTR and <b>internal</b> <b>promoter</b> elements. Based on these data, we propose a minimal, 25 -bp DNA binding site for Bel- 1, derived from the HFV <b>internal</b> <b>promoter</b> element, and show that this short DNA sequence mediates efficient Bel- 1 binding both in vitro and in vivo. We further demonstrate that, as determined by both in vitro and in vivo assays, the Bel- 1 target site located within the HFV <b>internal</b> <b>promoter</b> binds Bel- 1 with a significantly higher affinity than the cap-proximal Bel- 1 target site located in the LTR promoter. This result may provide a mechanistic explanation for the observation that the <b>internal</b> <b>promoter</b> is activated significantly earlier than the LTR promoter during the foamy virus life cycle...|$|E
40|$|Background: Duchenne muscular {{dystrophy}} (DMD) {{is caused by}} deficient expression of the cytoskeletal protein, dystrophin.

40|$|Polarity of Tn 10 {{insertion}} {{mutations in}} the Salmonella typhimurium ilvGEDA operon depends {{on both the}} location and {{the orientation of the}} Tn 10 element. One orientation of Tn 10 insertions in ilvG and ilvE permits low-level expression of the downstream ilvEDA and ilvDA genes, respectively. Our analysis of Salmonella ilv recombinant plasmids shows that this residual ilv expression must result from Tn 10 -directed transcription and does not reflect the presence of <b>internal</b> <b>promoters</b> in the ilvGEDA operon, as was previously suggested. The opposite orientation of Tn 10 insertion in ilvE prevents ilvDA expression, indicating that only one end of Tn 10 is normally active in transcribing adjacent genes. Both orientations of Tn 10 insertion in ilvD exert absolute polarity on ilvA expression. Expression of ilvA is known to be dependent on effective translation of ilvD, perhaps reflecting the lack of a ribosome binding site proximal to the ilvA sequence. Therefore, recognition of the ability of Tn 10 to promote transcription of contiguous genes in the ilvGEDA operon apparently requires the presence of associated ribosome binding sites...|$|R
40|$|Functional {{genomics}} uses system-wide {{approaches to}} generate genome-scale data and to describe gene functions. Recent genome-wide transcriptome studies have observed {{a great number}} of unexpected transcripts internal or antisense to known genes in bacteria and archaea, but the function of these unexpected transcripts is unclear. Here, we use the metal-reducing bacterium Shewanella oneidensis MR- 1 and its relatives to study the evolutionary conservation of unexpected transcriptional start sites (TSSs). In {{the first part of this}} thesis, we present the methodology to generate a set of high-confidence TSSs. Using high-resolution tiling microarrays and 5 ’-end RNA sequencing, combined with a semi-supervised machine learning approach, we identified 2, 531 TSSs in S. oneidensis MR- 1. We then classified them based on their relative positive compared with the current gene model. 18 % of the identified TSSs were located inside coding sequences (CDSs). In the second part of this thesis, we present the conservation study of the high-confidence TSSs identified in MR- 1. Comparative transcriptome analysis with seven additional Shewanella species revealed that the majority (76 %) of the TSSs within the upstream regions of annotated genes (gTSSs) were conserved. 30 % of the TSSs that were inside genes and on the sense strand (iTSSs) were also conserved. Sequence analysis around these iTSSs showed conserved promoter motifs, suggesting that many iTSS are under purifying selection. Furthermore, conserved iTSSs are enriched for regulatory motifs, suggesting that they are regulated. Combining with the genome-wide mutagenesis data, we show that having <b>internal</b> <b>promoters</b> significantly eliminate polar effects which are expected if the <b>internal</b> <b>promoters</b> are not functional. In contrast, the transcription of antisense TSSs located inside CDSs (aTSSs) were significantly less likely to be conserved (22 %). However, aTSSs whose transcription was conserved often have conserved promoter motifs and drive the expression of nearby genes. Overall, our findings demonstrate that some internal TSSs are conserved and drive protein expression despite their unusual locations, but the majority are not conserved and may reflect noisy initiation of transcription rather than a biological function. In the last part of the thesis, I present the development of a high-throughput assay, bacterial two-hybrid sequencing (B 2 H-seq), to construct protein interactome in bacteria.

We further present the identification of a novel activity, TFIIIU, which is also contained in crude fractions of TFIIIC 0. TFIIIU can be separated from TBA by further purification and is essentially involved in transcription of the mammalian U 6 gene. TFIIIU cannot be substituted for by any of the established U 6 {{transcription factor}}s and thus represents a novel U 6 transcription factor...|$|R
40|$|In humans, {{transcription}} factor IIIB (TFIIIB) -alpha governs basal transcription from small nuclear RNA genes by RNA polymerase III (pol III). One {{of the components}} of this complex, BRFU/TFIIIB 50, is specific for these promoters, whereas TATA-binding protein (TBP) and hB" are required for pol III transcription from both gene external and <b>internal</b> <b>promoters.</b> We show that hB" is specifically recruited to a promoter-bound TBP. BRFU complex, which we have previously demonstrated as forming on TATA-containing templates. The N-terminal region of BRFU, containing a zinc ribbon domain, acts as a damper of hB" binding. TBP deactivates this negative mechanism through protein-protein contacts with both BRFU and hB", which may then promote their cooperative binding to form TFIIIB-alpha. In addition, we have identified a GC-rich sequence downstream from the TATA box (the BURE) which, depending on the strength of TATA box, can either enhance BRFU binding to the TBP. DNA complex or hB" association with the BRFU. TBP. DNA complex, and subsequently stimulate pol III transcription. Moreover, mutation of the BURE reduces pol III transcription and induces transcription by RNA polymerase II from the U 2 gene promoter carrying a minimal TATA box...|$|R
40|$|A Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein {{fraction}} which binds {{specifically to the}} <b>internal</b> <b>promoter</b> regions of genes that are transcribed by RNA polymerase III is shown {{to function as a}} transcription factor. We postulate that the stable DNA binding of the factor confers stability on polymerase III transcription complexes. Analysis of the binding by DNase 'foot-printing' distinguishes three segments of the S. cerevisiae tRNALeu 3 gene: a region surrounding the so-called A block of the <b>internal</b> <b>promoter,</b> a region surrounding the B block and an intermediate segment. Binding to the A and B block regions is connected, but the B block region exerts a dominant effect...|$|E
40|$|The chick type III {{collagen}} gene {{contains an}} <b>internal</b> <b>promoter</b> in intron 23 {{in addition to}} the promoter preceding exon 1. The <b>internal</b> <b>promoter,</b> which is used preferentially in cultured chondrocytes, directs production of an alternative transcript that cannot encode type III collagen. This promoter is used ineffic-iently in skin fibroblasts, which transcribe the gene from the upstream promoter. We show below that the <b>internal</b> <b>promoter</b> is regulated by an activation element containing a potential activator protein 1 (AP 1) site and a repressor element containing a potential binding site for leader binding protein 1 (LBP 1). Electro-phoretic mobility shift assays indicate that the activation and repressor elements are bound by AP 1 and an LBP 1 -related protein, respectively. Replacement of the AP 1 site resulted in substantially decreased promoter activity in both chondrocytes and fibroblasts, indicating that this site is required for promoter function, but the low level of promoter activity in fibro-blasts is not due to loss of functional AP 1. In contrast, replacement of the LBP 1 -like site increased activity only in fibroblasts, suggesting that this site is responsible in part for repression of promoter activity in fibroblasts...|$|E
40|$|The human {{foamy virus}} or spuma{{retrovirus}} (HFV) {{is a complex}} retrovirus that {{has the capacity to}} code not only for the three retroviral genes gag, pol, and env but, in addition, for at least three bel genes. The HFV provirus contains two different and functionally active promoters: the classical retroviral promoter in the 5 ' long terminal repeat and a recently identified second promoter in the env gene upstream of the bel genes. Both promoter/enhancers are strongly dependent on the HFV transcriptional transactivator protein Bel 1. Here we report that the <b>internal</b> <b>promoter</b> directs the synthesis of viral transcripts that code for functionally active Bel 1 and for Bet proteins that appeared early after HFV infection. The viral mRNAs of the <b>internal</b> <b>promoter</b> have a 112 -nucleotide-long leader exon and were spliced predominantly at the first splice donor site in the 5 ' untranslated region. The data were obtained by transient expression assays, transactivation experiments, and RNA analyses of transcripts derived from HFV-infected cells. The results provide strong evidence for the crucial role the <b>internal</b> <b>promoter</b> plays during HFV infection in generating bel-specific transcripts...|$|E
40|$|The X. laevis tRNA((Ser) Sec) gene is {{different}} from the other tRNA genes in that its promoter contains two external elements, a PSE and a TATA box functionally equivalent to those of the U 6 snRNA gene. Of the two <b>internal</b> <b>promoters</b> governing classical tRNA gene transcription, only subsists the internal B box. In this report, we show that the tRNA((Ser) Sec) contains in addition an activator element (AE) which we have mapped by extensive mutagenesis. Activation is only dependent on a 15 bp fragment residing between - 209 and - 195 and containing an SPH motif. In vitro, this element forms a complex with a nuclear protein which {{is different}} from the TEF- 1 transcriptional activator that binds the SV 40 Sph motifs. This AE is versatile since it shows capacity of activating a variety of genes in vivo, including U 1 and U 6 snRNAs and HSV thymidine kinase. Unexpectedly for an snRNA-related gene, the tRNA((Ser) Sec) is deprived of octamer or octamer-like motifs. The X. laevis tRNA((Ser) Sec) gene represents the first example of a Pol III snRNA-type gene whose activation of transcription is completely octamer-independent...|$|R
40|$|Type III {{collagen}} {{is present}} in prechondrogenic mesenchyme, but not in cartilages formed during endochondral ossification. However, cultured chick chondrocytes contain an unusual transcript of the type III collagen gene in which exons 1 - 23 are replaced with a previously undescribed exon, 23 A; this alternative transcript does not encode type III collagen. This observation suggested that, although production of type III collagen mRNA is repressed in chondrocytes, transcription of the type III collagen gene may continue from an alternative promoter. To test this prediction, we isolated and characterized both the upstream and <b>internal</b> <b>promoters</b> of this gene and tested their ability to direct transcription in chondrocytes and skin fibroblasts. The upstream promoter is active in fibroblasts, but inactive in chondrocytes, indicating that repression of type III collagen synthesis during chondrogenesis is transcriptionally mediated. Additionally, sequences in intron 23, preceding exon 23 A, function as a highly active promoter in chondrocytes; transcription from this promoter is repressed in fibroblasts. Thus transcriptional control of the type III collagen gene is highly complex, with two promoters separated by at least 20 kb of DNA that are preferentially expressed in different cell types and give rise to RNAs with different structures and functions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe genome of the {{nematode}} Caenorhabditis elegans {{is unusual}} among eukaryotes, {{in that it}} contains operons. Approximately 15 % of genes in the worm are clustered into groups of between two and eight genes, which are {{under the control of}} shared regulatory sequences. Polycistronic transcripts from such operons are trans-spliced, during transcription, to produce mature monocistronic messengers. The C. elegans frataxin gene, frh- 1, is encoded in the operon CEOP 2232. This {{is one of the largest}} operons identified thus far in the C. elegans genome. Here we describe in detail the structure of all of the coding units within this operon. The operon is composed of eight genes of a diverse nature, organized in a complex structure. We have produced transgenic strains carrying fusions between gfp and a number of genes from the operon. These constructs show complex differential expression patterns that suggest the presence of <b>internal</b> <b>promoters</b> and regulatory sequences in the operon. This organization would permit both coordinated expression and differential expression of the components of the CEOP 2232 operon. The heterogeneity of the genes, and their complex expression patterns, suggests that the clustering of CEOP 2232 is not due to a need for synchronized expression of genes involved in the same physiological pathway...|$|R
