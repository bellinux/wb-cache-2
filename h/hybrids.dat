5|$|<b>Hybrids</b> are {{offspring}} {{resulting from}} the breeding of two genetically distinct individuals, which usually {{will result in a}} high degree of heterozygosity, though hybrid and heterozygous are not synonymous. The deliberate or accidental hybridizing of two or more species of closely related animals through captive breeding is a human activity which has been in existence for millennia and has grown for economic purposes. <b>Hybrids</b> between different subspecies within a species (such as between the Bengal tiger and Siberian tiger) are known as intra-specific <b>hybrids.</b> <b>Hybrids</b> between different species within the same genus (such as between lions and tigers) are known as interspecific <b>hybrids</b> or crosses. <b>Hybrids</b> between different genera (such as between sheep and goats) are known as intergeneric <b>hybrids.</b> Natural <b>hybrids</b> will occur in hybrid zones, where two populations of species within the same genera or species living in the same or adjacent areas will interbreed with each other. Some <b>hybrids</b> have been recognized as species, such as the red wolf (though this is controversial).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The <b>hybrid</b> Chi () {{language}} is a formalism for modeling, simulation and verication of <b>hybrid</b> systems.

The formal translation of to <b>hybrid</b> automata enables verication of specications using existing <b>hybrid</b> automata based verication tools. In this paper, we describe the translation from to <b>hybrid</b> automata, and the relation between <b>hybrid</b> automata and the linear <b>hybrid</b> I/O automata that are used for the verication tool PHAVer (Polyhedral <b>Hybrid</b> Automaton Verifyer).

5|$|Another {{reason for}} DNA testing was to {{determine}} the rates of hybridization between pallid and shovelnose sturgeon. The southern populations have more <b>hybrids</b> than are found in the middle sections of the Missouri River basin, while the northernmost populations have had few reports of <b>hybrids.</b> <b>Hybrids</b> are most common in the Atchafalaya River in Louisiana, and DNA sequencing in these <b>hybrids</b> showed a genetic distinction from pallid sturgeon, but based on the genetic markers assessed, they were genetically indistinguishable from shovelnose sturgeon. Because of this ability of two species to hybridize, some biologists have expressed concern that it is a violation of the Endangered Species Act to protect one species that may not be genetically isolated from another. It is not known if the <b>hybrids</b> are able to reproduce or not, although they appear {{to be the result of}} pallid sturgeon eggs being fertilized by shovelnose sturgeon males.|$|E
5|$|Camel {{hybridisation}} {{began in}} the first millennium BC. For about a thousand years, Bactrian camels and dromedaries have been successfully bred in regions where they are sympatric to form <b>hybrids</b> with either a long, slightly lopsided hump or two humps – one small and one large. These <b>hybrids</b> are larger and stronger than their parents – they can bear greater loads. A cross between a first generation female hybrid and a male Bactrian camel can also produce a hybrid. <b>Hybrids</b> from other combinations tend to be bad-tempered or runts.|$|E
5|$|Equine {{species can}} crossbreed with each other. The most common hybrid is the mule, {{a cross between}} a male donkey and a female horse. With rare exceptions, these <b>hybrids</b> are sterile and cannot reproduce. A related hybrid, a hinny, is {{a cross between a}} male horse and a female donkey. Other <b>hybrids</b> include the zorse, a cross between a zebra and a horse and a zonkey or zedonk, a hybrid of a zebra and a donkey. In areas where Grévy's zebras are {{sympatric}} with plains zebras, fertile <b>hybrids</b> do occur.|$|E

5|$|Familiar {{examples}} of equid <b>hybrids</b> are the mule, {{a cross between}} a female horse and a male donkey, and the hinny, {{a cross between a}} female donkey and a male horse. Pairs of complementary types like the mule and hinny are called reciprocal <b>hybrids.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Hybrids</b> are not {{as might}} be {{expected}} always intermediate between their parents (as if there were blending inheritance), but are sometimes stronger than either parent variety, a phenomenon called heterosis, hybrid vigour, or heterozygote advantage. This is most common with plant <b>hybrids.</b> A transgressive phenotype is a phenotype that displays more extreme characteristics than either of the parent lines. Plant breeders use several techniques to produce <b>hybrids,</b> including line breeding and the formation of complex <b>hybrids.</b> An economically important example is hybrid maize (corn), which provides a considerable seed yield advantage over open pollinated varieties. Hybrid seed dominates the commercial maize seed market in the United States, Canada and many other major maize-producing countries.|$|E

50|$|When {{the term}} <b>hybrid</b> vehicle is used, it most often {{refers to a}} <b>Hybrid</b> {{electric}} vehicle.

40|$|Abstract. By {{transferring}} {{the theory of}} <b>hybrid</b> systems to a categorical framework, {{it is possible to}} develop a homology theory for <b>hybrid</b> systems: <b>hybrid</b> homology. This is achieved by considering the underlying “space ” of a <b>hybrid</b> system—its <b>hybrid</b> space or H-space. The homotopy colimit can be applied to this H-space to obtain a single topological space; the <b>hybrid</b> homology of an H-space is the homology of this space. The result is a spectral sequence converging to the <b>hybrid</b> homology of an H-space, providing a concrete way to compute this homology. Moreover, the <b>hybrid</b> homology of the H-space underlying a <b>hybrid</b> system gives useful information about the behavior of this system: the vanishing of the first <b>hybrid</b> homology of this H-space—when it is contractible and finite—implies that this <b>hybrid</b> system is not Zeno. ...|$|R

In the Whipstick forest near Bendigo in Victoria, {{putative}} <b>hybrids</b> with Whirrakee wattle (Acacia williamsonii) have been identified; these resemble hakea wattle (Acacia hakeoides).

5|$|In captivity, only Campbell's dwarf hamsters and Djungarian hamsters {{are able}} to interbreed and produce live {{offspring}} or <b>hybrids.</b> Although <b>hybrids</b> make suitable pets, the breeding of <b>hybrids</b> and cloning can cause health problems, due to inherited diseases. Because genetic information can be very similar, genetic health problems or vulnerabilities can easily be inherited by the offspring. The widespread breeding and distribution of <b>hybrids</b> could threaten the existence of both pure species and subspecies of the ecosystem. This could ultimately lead to the extinction of the subspecies. Each litter becomes smaller as more generations are produced and the young commonly begin to inherit many congenital problems.|$|E
