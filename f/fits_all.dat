At that time, Dunedin was a fertile ground for bands, many of whom {{recorded}} on the Flying Nun Records label, based in Christchurch.

500|$|Ann Marie Burr, age 8, {{vanished}} from her Tacoma home on August 31, 1961 when Bundy was 14. The Burr house was on Bundy's newspaper delivery route. The victim's father {{was certain that}} he saw Bundy in a ditch at a construction site on the nearby UPS campus the morning his daughter disappeared. Other circumstantial evidence implicates him as well, but detectives {{familiar with the case}} have never agreed on the likelihood of his involvement.

500|$|After being {{released}} from his contractual obligations with Warner Bros. Records, Frank Zappa formed Zappa Records, a label distributed at that time by Phonogram Inc.. [...] He released the successful double album Sheik Yerbouti (1979, recorded 8/1977-2/1978), and began working {{on a series of}} songs for a follow-up album. The songs [...] "Joe's Garage" [...] and [...] "Catholic Girls" [...] were recorded with the intention that Zappa would release them as a single. Throughout the development of Joe's Garage, Zappa's band recorded lengthy jams which Zappa later formed into the album. [...] The album also continued the development of xenochrony, a technique Zappa also featured on One Size <b>Fits</b> <b>All</b> (1975), in which aspects of older live recordings were utilized to create new compositions by overdubbing them onto studio recordings, or alternatively, selecting a previously recorded solo and allowing drummer Vinnie Colaiuta to improvise a new drum performance, interacting with the previously recorded piece.|$|E
500|$|By 1973 the Bizarre and Straight labels were discontinued. In their place, Zappa and Cohen created DiscReet Records, also {{distributed}} by Warner Bros. Zappa continued {{a high rate}} of production through {{the first half of the}} 1970s, including the solo album Apostrophe (') (1974), which reached a career-high No.10 on the Billboard pop album charts helped by the chart single [...] "Don't Eat The Yellow Snow". Other albums from the period are Over-Nite Sensation (1973), which contained several future concert favorites, such as [...] "Dinah-Moe Humm" [...] and [...] "Montana", and the albums Roxy & Elsewhere (1974) and One Size <b>Fits</b> <b>All</b> (1975) which feature ever-changing versions of a band still called the Mothers, and are notable for the tight renditions of highly difficult jazz fusion songs in such pieces as [...] "Inca Roads", [...] "Echidna's Arf (Of You)" [...] and [...] "Be-Bop Tango (Of the Old Jazzmen's Church)". A live recording from 1974, You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 2 (1988), captures [...] "the full spirit and excellence of the 1973–75 band". Zappa released Bongo Fury (1975), which featured a live recording at the Armadillo World Headquarters in Austin from a tour the same year that reunited him with Captain Beefheart for a brief period. They later became estranged for a period of years, but were in contact at the end of Zappa's life.|$|E

500|$|The {{knowledge}} {{contained in}} tablebases affords the computer a tremendous {{advantage in the}} endgame. Not only can computers play perfectly within an endgame, but they can simplify to a winning tablebase position from a more complicated endgame. For the latter purpose, some programs use [...] "bitbases" [...] which give the game-theoretical value of positions without the number of moves until conversion or mate — that is, they only reveal whether the position is won, lost or draw. Sometimes even this data is compressed and the bitbase reveals only whether a position is won or not, making no difference between a lost and a drawn game. Shredderbases, for example, used by the Shredder program, are a type of bitbase which <b>fits</b> <b>all</b> three, four and five piece bitbases in 157MB. This is a mere fraction of the 7.05GB that the Nalimov tablebases require. [...] Some computer chess experts have observed practical drawbacks {{to the use of}} tablebases. In addition to ignoring the fifty-move rule, a computer in a difficult position might avoid the losing side of a tablebase ending even if the opponent cannot practically win without himself knowing the tablebase. The adverse effect could be a premature resignation, or an inferior line of play that loses with less resistance than a play without tablebase might offer.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the fall}} of 1975 the band had {{completed}} their European tour, with further US dates in the New Year of 1976, supporting Zappa along with Dr. John. Van Vliet now found himself stuck {{in a web of}} contractual hang-ups. At this point Zappa had begun to extend a helping hand, with Vliet already having performed incognito as [...] "Rollin' Red" [...] on Zappa's One Size <b>Fits</b> <b>All</b> (1975) and then joining with him on the Bongo Fury album and its later support tour. Two Vliet-penned numbers on the Bongo Fury album are [...] "Sam with the Showing Scalp Flat Top" [...] and [...] "Man with the Woman Head". The form, texture and imagery of this album's first track, [...] "Debra Kadabra", sung by Vliet, has 'angular similarities' to the work he would later produce in his next three albums. On the Bongo Fury album Vliet also sings [...] "Poofter's Froth Wyoming Plans Ahead", harmonizes on [...] "200 Years Old" [...] and [...] "Muffin Man", and plays harmonica and soprano saxophone.|$|E
2500|$|Each {{horse is}} {{different}} regarding saddle fit, though minor {{problems can be}} compensated for with saddle blankets or pads. As a horse's muscles change with age or conditioning, one saddle may not fit during its entire life, and no saddle <b>fits</b> <b>all</b> horses. [...] A properly fitted saddle should have enough height in the gullet to clear the withers of the horse and not be so wide as to press on the spine, but not be so narrow as to pinch the back and shoulders of the horse. [...] It must not be so long in the tree that it interferes with the horse's hips, though a too-short tree may also create abnormal pressure points, particularly when it is {{too small for the}} rider as well. [...] Professional saddlers and saddle-fitters may be able to make small adjustments in better-quality saddles to help them better fit an individual horse, but the underlying structure of the saddle tree cannot be changed and must have an adequate fit from the outset.|$|E

Particularly notable is their song [...] "Muffin Man", included on the Zappa/Beefheart Bongo Fury album, as well as Zappa's compilation album Strictly Commercial (1995). Beefheart finished concerts with the song for many years afterwards. Beefheart also provided vocals for [...] "Willie the Pimp" [...] on Zappa's otherwise instrumental album Hot Rats (1969).
