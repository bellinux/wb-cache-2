Otfried also pointed out, as we both say, that at Brauron, in Attica, Artemis was served by young maidens called [Greek] (bears); and he concluded, 'This cannot possibly be a freak of chance, but the metamorphosis [of Kallisto] has its foundation {{in the fact that the}} animal [the bear] was sacred to the goddess.' ...|$|E

Would you rather help such an one to profit than me, Caron? Have you so far forgotten how we suffered together--almost in the self-same cause--at Bellecour, in the old days?

6000|$|Your Sermon did {{not reach}} me till the night before last; we have all read it, and are much pleased with it. Upon the whole, I like it better than the last: {{it must have been}} heard with great interest. I differ, however, from you in a few particulars. 1st. The Spaniards 'devoting {{themselves}} for an imprisoned Bourbon, or the crumbling relics of the Inquisition.' This is very fair for pointing a sentence, {{but it is not the}} truth. They have told us over and over again, that they are fighting against a foreign tyrant, who has dealt with them most perfidiously and inhumanly, who must hate them for their worth, and on account of the injuries they have received from him, and whom they must hate accordingly; against a ruler over whom they could have no control, and for one whom they have told us they will establish as a sovereign of a free people, and therefore must he himself be a limited monarch. You will permit me to make to you this representation for its truth's sake, and because it gives me an opportunity of letting out a secret, viz. that I myself am very deep in this subject, and about to publish upon it, first, I believe, in a newspaper, for the sake of immediate and wide circulation; and next, the same matter in a separate pamphlet, under the title of 'The Convention of Cintra brought to the test of principles, and the people of Great Britain vindicated from the charge of having prejudged it.' You will wonder to hear me talk of principles when I have told you that <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>do</b> not go along with you in your sentiments respecting the Roman Catholic question. I confess I am not prepared to see the Roman Catholic religion as the Established Church of Ireland; and how that can be consistently refused to them, if other things are granted on the plea of their being the majority, I do not see. Certainly this demand will follow, and how would it be answered? ...|$|E

[...] We have here a solemn and momentous truth, {{expressed}} in few words, as clearly and as briefly as any geometrical definition. But is this all the Gospel? Will this alone [...] "mend the world, forsooth"? Now the extreme men of one particular school in the English Church do really preach little else beside this. When they are entreated to preach upon good works, too, and unfold a little of their value and beauty,--if they have any at all,--the answer is always to the effect, [...] "Oh, of course; faith in Christ must of necessity beget the love of good works. These are the signs of that. Preach Christ crucified, {{and all the rest}} will be sure to follow." [...] And this is what is exclusively called [...] "preaching the Gospel." [...] The preacher who teaches us to love our enemies, to live pure lives, to be honourable to all men and women, to bring up our families in the truth, is frowned upon as a [...] "legal preacher." [...] As a clergyman myself, I am not afraid of saying that I look upon this so-called Gospel-preaching as fraught with not a little of danger. God knows, wicked sinners are found in every congregation and class of men, kneeling to pray, and singing praises, exactly like good men. Now I can hardly conceive a style and matter of preaching more calculated to excuse and palliate, and almost encourage sin, than this narrow and exclusive so-called Gospel-preaching. Neither Christ nor His apostles taught thus at all. The whole Sermon on the Mount is moral in the highest and purest sense. Every epistle has its moral or legal side. [...] "Woe is me if I preach not the Gospel!" [...] and I cannot be preaching the Gospel unless, along with the great proclamation, [...] "If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father," [...] <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>do</b> my utmost to teach [...] "what the will of the Lord is" [...] concerning a pure, holy, and blameless life, full of active, good works, done in deep humility and self-abasement; because Christ loved me and died for me, and asks me, in love to Him, to walk in His steps.|$|E
