The examination of any fractures on the bones can potentially help determine cause of death as well by determining if a fracture occurred ante-mortem (before death), peri-mortem (at the time of death), or post-mortem (after death). Ante-mortem fractures will show signs of healing while peri- and post-mortem fractures will not. Peri-mortem fractures will usually appear clean while post-mortem breaks will appear brittle. Diseases such as bone cancer might be present in bone marrow samples and can help narrow <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> possible identifications.|$|E

Upon learning of his fostering of children, the CSIs learned from a video tape that Ernie had at least thirteen foster kids, any one of which could be the Miniature Killer. The CSIs managed to slowly narrow down the list after tracking numerous of the Dell foster children down, some of whom had died over the years. After epithelials were discovered on a fingerprint of one of the miniature dolls made by the Miniature Killer, the CSI team learned that the killer was female, narrowing <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> children further.|$|E
500|$|Some critics {{argued that}} the album was their most {{consistent}} and strongest album to date. Christian Hoard of Rolling Stone felt that the album was [...] "experimental and expansive". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine felt that the album lacked [...] "freshness or spontaneity" [...] that {{was found in the}} band's debut album, calling only two songs on the album [...] "very visionary". Jim Farber of the Daily News criticized Williams, saying [...] "Even aided by studio correction, the guy can't sing", calling it [...] "bad singing at its engaging best". Cohen of Pitchfork Media bashed the lyrics, saying that the writing was [...] "far <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> what N.E.R.D. is actually good at". Hoard of Rolling Stone felt he learned nothing from the lyrics except that Williams was sexually aroused. Henriques of PopMatters noted that Williams is not a [...] "technically gifted rapper", he [...] "does not have a beautiful voice" [...] and his lyrics are [...] "typically inconsequential in a 'saying shit just to sound cool' sort of way", but found strengths in his choruses, which he pointed out [...] "typically use a catchy phrase or recognizable melody as an anchor for his nonsensical verses". Dan Charnas of The Washington Post commended N.E.R.D for their songwriting, writing that Seeing Sounds [...] "combines the adolescent and clever". The Times writer Priya Elan gave the album 4 out of 5 stars and wrote that band is [...] "pushing the boundaries of the popular song". [...] In his Consumer Guide, Robert Christgau gave the album a three-star honorable mention (...) and stated, [...] "Beats of course, songs usually, singing barely--especially sincere-type singing"; he also picked out two songs from the album: [...] "Anti-Matter" [...] and [...] "Everyone Nose (All the Girls Standing in the Line for the Bathroom)".|$|E

The study demonstrates for {{the first}} time the probable genetic unity of the KHOE, JU and UJ -T AA groups of southern African Khoesan, by means of the first full-scale application of a conventional comparative approach. It is shown in the first stage that there are repeated cross-SAK resemblances in the morphology of those verbs most frequently enlisted for grammatical purposes in the context of multi-verb constructions; and that these languages furthermore display multiple similarities 'horizontally' across their specifier systems. where the resemblances are often also visible 'vertically', i. e. <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>lists</b> <b>of</b> possible exponents. These structural affinities are sufficiently thoroughgoing to warrant a working surmise that the SAK languages might be genetically related. In the second stage, cross-SAK comparative material from various sources is presented in the form of arrays. The tabulations reveal a range of repeating alternations involving the basic positional click types, with some associated patternings of the possible click 'accompaniments'. The fact that the alternations are iterated and do not necessarily involve identities makes it more likely, when combined with the weight of the structural evidence, that the items in the comparative series are inherited than borrowed...|$|R

A man stepping out of the dark into the circle of the fires naturally, if he be a true man, holds up his hands and says, 'I, So-and-So, am here.'
