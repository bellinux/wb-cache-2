5|$|I've {{always been}} drawn to her story. More than anything, drawn to her {{commitment}} to what she believed in. In the face of death, she did not back down. And that is a theme that resonates with me. And women need female role models like that. There's not a lot. I mean, she was {{burned at the stake}} after leading her country to victory, after defeating the English. I mean, the idea that instead of celebrating her, they called her a heretic because she was dressed like a boy, and how could this person, this one girl, be so victorious and so clever to have the strategy and knowledge to wage, and win, a war? There must be something wrong with her. OK, she's a witch. Now we have to destroy her. And she didn't back <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> admire that.|$|E
5|$|The {{sixth and}} final symphony, Sinfonia semplice, {{was written in}} 1924–25. After {{suffering}} a serious heart attack in 1925, Nielsen was forced to curtail much of his activity, although he continued to compose until his death. His sixtieth birthday in 1925 brought many congratulations, a decoration from the Swedish government, and a gala concert and reception in Copenhagen. The composer, however, was in a dour mood; {{in an article in}} Politiken on 9 November 1925 he wrote: If I could live my life again, I would chase any thoughts of Art out of my head and be apprenticed to a merchant or pursue some other useful trade the results of which could be visible in the end... What use is it to me that the whole world acknowledges me, but hurries away and leaves me alone with my wares until everything breaks <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> discover to my disgrace that I have lived as a foolish dreamer and believed that the more I worked and exerted myself in my art, the better position I would achieve. No, it is no enviable fate to be an artist.|$|E

500|$|He {{was hitting}} [...]476 when he dislocated his left thumb sliding head-first into second base on April 11, 2006, and {{was placed on}} the {{disabled}} list. [...] "I knew it wasn't good when I looked <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> saw the top part of the thumb pointing in at me", Kinsler said. He came back 41 games later on May 25, and went 3–4 with a single and two home runs, to lead the Rangers to an 8–7 victory over the Oakland Athletics. [...] "I hope the fans don't expect that much every night", he joked.|$|E
500|$|... "I {{realized}} it was the applause of the fans that really kept me going. Because I {{would be ready to}} go onstage and just be crying hysterically not understanding even how I was feeling. I was feeling very dizzy, I had a lot of vertigo, I had pain but it's like fuck if I know what hurts the most because I'd been on tour for a year. But I didn't want to let them <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> just couldn't cancel because the thought of leaving 50,000 kids in the arena just broke my heart. So I went out every night and I played and I played and I played until I couldn't walk one night." ...|$|E
500|$|Although they {{initially}} parted on {{good terms}} when Taylor retired in May 1982, the relationship was finally damaged permanently after a dispute over the transfer in May 1983 of John Robertson from Forest to Derby, where Taylor was now managing. Clough was apparently angered that Taylor did not inform him about the deal. Clough attacked Taylor in a tabloid article on 3 July 1983 as being a [...] "rattlesnake", [...] "a snake-in-the-grass" [...] and said that [...] "We pass {{each other on the}} A52 going to work on most days of the week. But if his car broke <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> saw him thumbing a lift, I wouldn't pick him up, I'd run him over". The two men would never speak to one another again.|$|E

500|$|An {{unidentified}} {{crew member}} asked Powers, {{one of the}} students, for his compass reading. Powers replied: [...] "I don't know where we are. We must have got lost after that last turn." [...] Cox then transmitted; [...] "This is FT-74, plane or boat calling 'Powers' please identify yourself so someone can help you." [...] The response {{after a few moments}} was a request from the others in the flight for suggestions. FT-74 tried again and a man identified as FT-28 (Taylor) came on. [...] "FT-28, this is FT-74, what is your trouble?" [...] "Both of my compasses are out", Taylor replied, [...] "and I am trying to find Fort Lauderdale, Florida. I am over land but it's broken. I am sure I'm in the Keys but I don't know how far <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't know how to get to Fort Lauderdale." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{asked how}} she felt about Fey's portrayal, Sarah Palin replied, [...] "I watched with the volume all the way <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> thought it was hilarious... I didn't hear a word she said, but the visual was spot on." [...] Palin [...] "and the press corps watched the sketch {{in the back of}} her plane, {{laughing}} at Tina and Amy's satirical take on the two politicians," [...] and Palin later claimed that she had once dressed up as Fey for Halloween. However, Carly Fiorina, a spokeswoman for the John McCain campaign argued that the sketch portrayed Hillary Clinton as [...] "very substantive," [...] but Fiorina thought, in the case of Sarah Palin, that she was portrayed as [...] "totally superficial." [...] Fiorina thought the sketch was [...] "disrespectful in the extreme" [...] and [...] "sexist." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the racial}} and social {{implications}} of R and {{country at the}} time, Charles {{did not agree with}} contemporary views of race records and other genres, including pop and country, as essentially different. In an interview with Ben Fong-Torres of Rolling Stone, Charles said of the similarities between the blues and country music, [...] "he words to country songs are very earthy like the blues, see, very down. They're not as dressed up, and the people are very honest and say, 'Look, I miss you, darlin', so I went out and I got drunk in this bar.' That's the way you say it. Where in Tin Pan Alley will say, 'Oh, I missed you darling, so I went to this restaurant and I sat <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had dinner for one.' That's cleaned up now, you see? But country songs and the blues is like it is." ...|$|E

500|$|The D-Day {{scenes were}} shot in Ballinesker Beach, Curracloe Strand, Ballinesker, {{just east of}} Curracloe, County Wexford, Ireland. Hanks {{recalled}} to Roger Ebert that although {{he realized it was}} a movie, the experience still hit him hard, stating, [...] "The first day of shooting the D-Day sequences, I was {{in the back of the}} landing craft, and that ramp went <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> saw the first 1-2-3-4 rows of guys just getting blown to bits. In my head, of course, I knew it was special effects, but I still wasn't prepared for how tactile it was." [...] Filming began June 27, 1997, and lasted for two months. Some shooting was done in Normandy, for the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial in Colleville-sur-Mer and Calvados. Other scenes were filmed in England, such as a former British Aerospace factory in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, Thame Park, Oxfordshire and Wiltshire. Production was due to also take place in Seaham, County Durham, but government restrictions disallowed this.|$|E
500|$|City Lights {{marked the}} first time Chaplin {{composed}} the film score to one of his productions. While Chaplin preferred his films to have live sound by the 1930s most theaters had gotten rid of their orchestras. Many of his critics claimed he was doing it to grab more credit. Chaplin, whose parents and many members of the Chaplin family were both musicians, was struggling with the professional musicians he hired and took it upon himself to compose the score himself. It was written in six weeks with Arthur Johnston and included over one hundred musical cues. Chaplin told a reporter that [...] "I really didn't write it down. I la-laed and Arthur Johnson wrote it <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> wish you would give him credit because he did a very good job. It is all simple music, you know, in keeping with my character." [...] The intention was to have a score that would translate the characters' emotions through its melodies. The score was recorded in five days with musical arranger Alfred Newman.|$|E
500|$|Wilkinson, by then Leeds United manager, {{returned}} to his former club in July 1991 to sign two young centre-backs, Jon Newsome first and Wetherall a few days later, for a combined fee of £275,000. The 20-year-old Wetherall's first season at Leeds was {{the final year of}} his degree course, so he played for the reserves while training part-time. He made a brief debut in the First Division, on 3 September 1991 at Elland Road as a late substitute against Arsenal; Leeds {{went on to win the}} 1991–92 league title. He remembers it as [...] "With 20 minutes to go, we were 2–1 <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was on the touchline ready to go on, then Lee Chapman scored and the gaffer (Howard Wilkinson) told me to sit down again. But he threw me on for the last two minutes. I always tell people that made the difference in winning the title!" [...] As his teammates took the league trophy on a celebratory open top bus tour, Wetherall chose to revise for his examinations, a decision he came to regret, because [...] "those experiences don't come around that often". Though the revision bore fruit: he graduated with first-class honours.|$|E

500|$|Two riders very {{disappointed}} with their results were Michael Matthews and Fabian Cancellara. Matthews crashed {{at high speed}} shortly before the Cipressa and arrived at the finish with a bandaged right elbow. He said: [...] "Obviously I'm devastated. [...] This was everything, this was my world championships {{for the start of}} the season. [...] I was really looking forward to making a good finale, it's really unfortunate that a crash stopped me from doing that." [...] Cancellara, who was riding the event for the last time before retirement at the end of the 2016 season, was held up in Gaviria's crash after having stayed in the leading group. He described his final kilometres as difficult, as he had been isolated from his teammates, saying that the other riders mainly attacked him and did not work with him. Another rider who was almost involved when Gaviria fell was Peter Sagan, who confirmed that the peloton had covered Cancellara in particular. He went on to describe the moment of Gaviria's crash: [...] "Then I got away with Boasson Hagen, Gaviria and someone else. Then with about 500 metres to go, Gaviria looked around because the group was coming up. He went <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> only just managed to avoid him. I stayed up but I lost a lot speed and never managed to get going again in the final metres." ...|$|E
500|$|David Hill, 18, {{was asked}} to [...] "sit in" [...] at the house, and while there heard Dudson shout [...] "Shut up, you slag!" [...] in the back room. When he asked what was going on, Leigh had shown him Capper. He said: [...] "She {{had a sort of}} cloth over her face, from just above the eyebrows and {{covering}} her nose. She had a bit of dried blood on her lip. She had no hair." [...] Hill also said he had heard them talking about [...] "dentistry work. It was something about pulling her teeth out with a pair of pliers." [...] Later, he was left alone in the house with Capper, who pleaded with him to untie her. He said: [...] "She asked me if I could help but I told her I couldn't. I asked her who she was. She said her name was Suzanne. She asked me if I could untie her. I said I couldn't do anything." [...] He later claimed that he was too afraid of Leigh to intervene or raise the alarm, saying: [...] "I thought they would batter me. If I'd said [...] they'd all have got me, wouldn't they? I didn't know what to do. I was too shocked to do anything." [...] While Capper was being held in the house, Leigh and Dudson met up with her sister's fiance Paul Barlow to help him repair his car. Barlow said: [...] "They could have told me there and then. The door would have been kicked <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> would have got Suzanne out. I did not think they were capable of such savagery. Now all I want is ten minutes with them in a back room." ...|$|E
2500|$|... {{when she}} found {{the kind of life}} I was living she started me {{collecting}}, putting things down. She didn't call it collecting then.

2500|$|In January 2013, Gaffney {{suffered}} serious {{head injuries}} {{when a car}} he was travelling in collided with the central reservation on the A38 in Derby. Gaffney admitted {{he had not been}} wearing his seat belt {{at the time of the}} accident, and said [...] "It could have been a lot worse. One inch <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> would have been blind. [...] One inch up and I would have been brain damaged." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lyrically {{the song}} is about letting loose, being as wild as can be, while she asks ladies to [...] "whip their hair" [...] and [...] "shake haters off". The lyrics have motivational undertones, {{speaking}} of self-love and assurance, and referring to letting your hair down as a representation of this in parts like the line, [...] "Keep fighting until I get there, when I'm <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> feel like giving up/I whip my hair back and forth, I whip it, I whip it real good." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Taylor signed John Robertson from Forest without informing Clough, it was, {{according}} to Robertson, [...] "the straw {{that broke the}} camel's back" [...] {{and the two men}} would never speak again. In a tabloid article, Clough called Taylor a [...] "snake in the grass" [...] and declared that [...] "if his car broke <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> saw him thumbing a lift, I wouldn't pick him up, I'd run him over." [...] Taylor retorted that Clough's outbursts were [...] "the sort of thing I have come to expect from a person I now regard with great distaste." ...|$|E
