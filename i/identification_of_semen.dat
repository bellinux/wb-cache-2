40|$|Abstract Background It is {{generally}} accepted that oxidative stress {{is an important}} factor in male infertility because it may impair the physiological function of spermatozoa at the molecular level. Nevertheless, although several approaches have been reported, the imbalance between production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activity of the antioxidant defense system in semen is difficult to investigate and remains poorly understood. Methods This study compares measurement of ROS production in neat semen and in washed spermatozoa obtained from the same ejaculate, and suspended in phosphate buffered saline using exactly the same luminol-mediated chemiluminescence method. Ninety one samples were obtained from males of infertile couples and 34 from volunteers with proven fertility. Results As expected, ROS levels were markedly lower in neat semen than in washed spermatozoa suspensions where seminal plasma with its potent antioxidant capacity was removed. In the cases of both neat semen and washed spermatozoa, ROS production was lowest in samples from normozoospermic males and highest in samples containing more than half million peroxidase-positive leukocytes per milliliter. For all samples, there was a significant positive correlation between ROS production by neat semen and that by washed spermatozoa suspension. Conclusion Measurement of ROS production in neat semen better reflects actual oxidative status because it detects only the overproduction of ROS which are not effectively scavenged by antioxidant capacity of seminal fluid. The results of our study show a good commutability of both measurements for <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>semen</b> samples with high ROS production. The measurement in neat semen is even less time consuming and therefore easier to implement into laboratory routine. </p...|$|E
40|$|A novel sperm-coating antigen {{from the}} human seminal vesicles was discovered. We {{identified}} a monoclonal antibody MHS- 5, recognizing an epitope with characteristics of a forensic semen marker: 1) conservation in all vasectomized or normal semen samples tested (421); 2) absence in all human tissues or biological fluids other than semen; and 3) immunolocalization {{on the surface of}} ejaculated sperm. Western blots of ejaculates allowed to liquefy for 5 mm demonstrated the MHS- 5 epitope to be located on peptides {{of a wide range of}} molecular masses from 69 to 8 kDa. After 15 h of semen liquefaction, immunoreaction peptides of higher molecular mass were un-detectable in semen, while peptides of lower molecular mass from 8 to 21 kDa retained antigenicity. Three peptides of 10, 11. 9, and 13. 7 kDa were the most immunoreactive species in semen liquified for 15 b. Using the MHS- 5 monoclonal, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed sensitive to 1 ng of seminal protein. This assay showed that the MHS- 5 antigen was undetectable in semen of common domestic animals and monkeys but was present in chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan semen. ELISA of homoge-nates from human organs and reproductive tissues demonstrated the antigen only in samples of seminal vesicles. Epididymal sperm obtained at vasovasostomy lacked the MHS- 5 epitope, a fact that, together with immuno-localization on ejaculated sperm, demonstrated that the MHS- 5 antigen functions as a “sperm-coating antigen. ” The MHS- 5 monoclonal detected semen in sexual-assault evidence obtained six months previously and in mixtures of semen with vaginal or cervical fluid. Assay systems employing the MJ-IS- 5 mono clonal may be useful for <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>semen</b> in sexual-assault casework.

However, Gohara’s work is at variance with that of other workers, in particular that of Pragay et al. (2), who demonstrated that GGT is present in vaginal secretion (a finding that we confirm) and also drew attention to its occurrence in the urine of people with renal disease. The rate of decay of enzymes in the vagina. The hyperbolic equation quoted by Gohara representing the decay of ACP and GGT in the vagina, y = a + (b/x), is almost certainly a simplification of the true state of affairs. (Incidentally Gohara wrongly described “a ” as the slope and “b ” the intercept.) Figure 1 illustrates the results from our own survey of the decay of ACP in the vagina following coitus, which indicates a much more complex curve that is not easily described by a simple hyperbolic func-tion. Our results (3) are comparable to those observed by Sensabaugh (4), who believes the curve is the summation of three decay curves representing initial dilution of semen in the vaginal secre-tion or drainage followed by enzyme inactivation. In any case, the spread of results about the line of best fit is so large that practical application of any formula without some indication of the error factor would have its dangers. In summary, the use of GGT as a marker for semen and the prediction of time since intercourse from a single formula should be used with caution in any medico-legal investigations...|$|E
40|$|Introduction International {{guidelines}} {{endorse the}} screening of patients for {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and Chlamydia trachomatis before assisted reproductive techniques (ART). At present no such guidelines exists in South Africa. At the Reproductive and Endocrine Unit (referred to as “the Unit”) of Steve Biko Academic Hospital, all patients with unknown HIV status are counselled and a blood sample is collected during the initial visit for automated laboratory based HIV screening. These HIV results are not available before semen samples are processed. Furthermore, patients are not screened for HBV, HCV and Chlamydia trachomatis. Couples attending the Unit are of a low to middle socio-economic status and experience financial constraints. Moreover, automated laboratory based assays are expensive to perform. Rapid testing is a cost effective and practical method from screening patients, with a 20 – 30 minute result turnover time. Until screening at the Unit is improved, the possible <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>semen</b> characteristics that could indicate HIV infection would be a useful tool. Materials and Methods The following rapid point-of-care assays were evaluated: Determine® HIV- 1 / 2 combo test (n= 100), Determine® HBsAg test (n= 100), DIAQUICK HCV kit (n= 74), and the DIAQUICK Chlamydia trachomatis kit (n= 30). For profiling, parameters from a basic semen analysis of HIV-positive males (n= 60) were compared with HIV-negative males (n= 60). Information pertaining to CD 4 count, antiretroviral treatment and plasma viral load of HIV-positive males were analysed. Results From all patients included in the study, 8 % tested positive for HIV. The risk of a female being HIV-positive was 3. 73 times higher than for males. In the pilot study to explore rapid testing for HBV and HCV, 1 % and 1. 4 % of patients tested positive respectively. When testing for Chlamydia trachomatis 31. 3 % of females, but no males tested positive. Comparing semen profiles, {{no significant differences were}} found between samples from HIV positive and negative males or between HIV positive males categorised by CD 4 cell count (p> 0. 05). For the HIV-positive group with a detectable plasma HIV viral load (> 40 copies/ml), a significant difference was observed in the semen viscosity (p= 0. 0460). Significant differences were noted in the sperm motility (immotile sperm p= 0. 0456, progressive sperm p= 0. 0192) of patients receiving antiretroviral (ARV) therapy. Discussion and Conclusion The use of rapid testing is an acceptable and feasible option for improving current screening protocols at the Unit. The absence of definite alterations in the semen characteristics of HIV-positive men further motivates the need for a simpler, point-of-care screening protocol. The prevalence of HBV was lower than that reported in the general population of South Africa and further investigation is needed. Although the sample size was small, HCV prevalence was similar to that of the general population. One third of females tested positive for Chlamydia trachomatis. The methodology used was possibly not appropriate for males. This study highlighted the need for guidelines that address the specialised needs of ART clinics in resource-limited and developing countries with a high HIV prevalence.

40|$|Identification of {{an unknown}} stain {{encountered}} at a crime scene, especially where {{the context of the}} case does not provide an indication to the identity of the stain, currently requires a number of time consuming and costly presumptive and confirmatory tests to be performed. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is a vibrational spectroscopic method that could allow crime scene analysts to identify unknown stains rapidly both in the laboratory and in the field. The SERS technique utilizes a laser, which interacts with molecules applied to a gold nanoparticle chip (SERS substrate) that enhances the normal Raman signal, producing a shift in energy characteristic of the vibrational modes present. Therefore, the light scattering spectrum obtained provides the analyst with a unique spectral fingerprint of the molecular components of the sample. The advantages of this SERS based method include its high sensitivity, speed, non-destructive nature, ease-of-use, minimal sample preparation requirement, portability, and multiplexing capabilities. In contrast to conventional Raman spectroscopy, SERS offers higher sensitivity resulting in small sample volumes (approximately 1 μL or less) being required for sample identification and the ability to process dilute solutions. This allows for the remaining sample to be used for other forensic tests, making the technique an ideal analytical method for use at a crime scene. vi It is hypothesized that SERS can be coupled with multivariate statistical methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) to be established as a confirmatory technique in the forensic analysis of human body fluids. It was concluded that semen produces a spectral pattern that is consistent and readily distinct from blood, saliva, urine and vaginal fluid. In addition, this investigation identified and characterized semen from four donors, utilizing liquid semen as well as semen stains on cotton swatches and glass cover slips. Reproducibility was established by analyzing three separate SERS chips for every sample and/or solution. Ten spectra of each chip were obtained, averaged, and then compared to one another. A protocol was designed for the extraction of dried semen stains on cotton swatches and application to a SERS chip. Different extraction conditions were performed, varying both the volume of water used and the time the cutting remained submerged in the water, resulting in optimal signal from 5 μL of water for 5 minutes. Additional parameters including analysis of the perimeter of the stain and the use of saline as an extractant were examined. A second protocol for the extraction of dried semen stains from a glass cover slip was designed and tested, utilizing 1 μL of water. All experimental spectra were subjected to PCA for comparison with neat semen, and determined to be consistent. Additionally, a mixture of semen and vaginal fluid was evaluated. Visual inspection and PCA of the resulting spectra demonstrated that the mixture was a combination of both body fluids. Such samples are of particular importance in sexual assault cases. vii In summary, this preliminary study of the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>semen</b> using SERS demonstrates the potential for the method to be used as an investigative tool for the detection of trace amounts of human body fluids at crime scenes and within forensic laboratories.

40|$|Summary. Pilocarpine (50 mg) {{administered}} to the boar 20 min before semen collection had no detectable effect on either ejaculation or semen composition. However, the volume <b>of</b> fluid <b>semen,</b> the total volume <b>of</b> <b>semen,</b> and the time required for ejaculation differed significantly(P< 0 =. 1) between breeds ofboars.

Twenty saliva and semen stains, four dilution series (10 - 0. 01 μl saliva, 5 - 0. 01 μl semen) and, optionally, bona fide or mock casework samples of human or non-human origin were analyzed by 20 participating laboratories using an RNA extraction or RNA/DNA co-extraction method. Two novel mRNA multiplexes were used: a saliva triplex (HTN 3, STATH and MUC 7) and a semen pentaplex (PRM 1, PRM 2, PSA, SEMG 1 and TGM 4). The laboratories used different chemistries and instrumentation and a majority (16 / 20) were able to successfully isolate and detect mRNA in dried stains.
