5|$|Because of {{its large}} {{financial}} power, the Kingdom of Hungary quickly rebuilt its army and found itself <b>in</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Holy Roman Empire in 1337. However, the Hungarian king maintained a de jure suzerainty over Wallachia until the diplomatic disputes had been resolved.|$|E
5|$|Offa was {{frequently}} <b>in</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> various Welsh kingdoms. There was {{a battle between}} the Mercians and the Welsh at Hereford in 760, and Offa is recorded as campaigning against the Welsh in 778, 784 and 796 in the 10th century Annales Cambriae.|$|E
5|$|As {{animals at}} {{the summit of the}} food chain, bears do not have many predators. The most {{important}} are humans, and as they started cultivating crops, they increasingly came <b>in</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> bears that raided them. Since the invention of firearms, people have been able to kill bears with greater ease. The tiger is the only four-legged predator that regularly preys on adult bears, including brown bears, sloth bears, Asiatic black bears, and sun bears.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{his having}} overtly {{undermined}} the king, Armansperg was dismissed from his duties by King Otto immediately {{upon his return}} from Germany. However, despite high hopes {{on the part of}} the Greeks, the Bavarian Rudhart was appointed chief minister, and the granting of a constitution was again postponed. The attempts of Otto to conciliate Greek sentiment through efforts to enlarge the frontiers of his kingdom, for example, by the suggested acquisition of Crete in 1841, failed in their objective, and only succeeded in embroiling him <b>in</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Great Powers.|$|E
5|$|In 1002 King Æthelred the Unready married Emma of Normandy, {{the sister}} of Richard II, Duke of Normandy. Their son Edward the Confessor, who spent many years in exile in Normandy, succeeded to the English throne in 1042. This led to the {{establishment}} of a powerful Norman interest in English politics, as Edward drew heavily on his former hosts for support, bringing in Norman courtiers, soldiers, and clerics and appointing them to positions of power, particularly in the Church. Childless and embroiled <b>in</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> formidable Godwin, Earl of Wessex and his sons, Edward may also have encouraged Duke William of Normandy's ambitions for the English throne.|$|E
5|$|The Antarctic Plateau was claimed for Norway by Roald Amundsen as the King Haakon VII Plateau {{when his}} {{expedition}} {{was the first}} to reach South Pole on 14 December 1911. It was mapped as a circular territory comprising the plateau around the South Pole, including all the land above latitude 85°S. However, roughly the same area had been claimed by the British as the King Edward VII Plateau, which was <b>in</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Norwegian claim. Amundsen's claim has never been officially claimed by the Norwegian government.|$|E

5|$|The Holy See {{also tried}} to reach a {{compromise}} on the Kraków bishopric, but Jan Zamoyski, who was <b>in</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> king, persuaded Andrew {{to give up his}} claim in favor of Radziwiłł. Andrew withheld 20,000 gulden from the royal tax of Warmia, saying that the king owed him 40,000 gulden. He started negotiations with John George, Elector of Brandenburg, who promised him the hand of one of his daughters if he accepted the protection of Brandenburg over Warmia. Zamoyski, who had been with Sigismund III, also persuaded Andrew to make peace with the king in May 1593. Andrew renounced the see of Kraków in exchange for the Abbey of Czerwińsk nad Wisłą.|$|E
5|$|Andrianampoinimerina {{took power}} upon deposing his uncle, King Andrianjafy, who had ruled over Imerina Avarandrano (Northern Imerina). Prior to Andrianampoinimerina's reign, Imerina Avarandrano had been locked <b>in</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> three other {{neighboring}} provinces {{of the former}} kingdom of Imerina that had last been unified under King Andriamasinavalona a century before. Andrianampoinimerina established his capital at the fortified town of Ambohimanga, a site of great spiritual, cultural and political significance that was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2001. The king's original royal lodgings can still be visited at Ambohimanga today. From this position, he progressively extended his domain first over all Imerina and then over the greater Highlands, absorbing the Betsileo, Sihanaka, Bezanozano and Bara territories. Having reigned for 23 years {{at the time of}} his death, Andrianampoinimerina had successfully reunited Imerina and vastly expanded the Merina kingdom, with the intent to ultimately unify all of Madagascar under Merina rule. His son and heir, Radama I, continued the conquests Andrianampoinimerina had begun, and over the next two decades largely achieved his father's vision.|$|E
5|$|Bohemond's Norman {{relatives}} in Sicily had been <b>in</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Byzantine Empire for over 30 years; his father Robert Guiscard {{was one of}} the Empire's most formidable enemies. While Bohemond was away, Alexios sent an army to reoccupy Antioch and the cities of Cilicia. In 1107, having organized a new army for his planned crusade against the Muslims in Syria, Bohemond instead launched into open warfare against Alexios, crossing the Adriatic to besiege Dyrrhachium, the westernmost city of the Empire. Like his father however, Bohemond was unable to make any significant advances into the Empire's interior; Alexios avoided a pitched battle and Bohemond's siege failed, partly due to a plague among his army. Bohemond soon found himself in an impossible position, isolated in front of Dyrrhachium: his escape by sea was cut off by the Venetians, and Paschal II withdrew his support.|$|E
50|$|The 14th-century historiographer Ibn Khaldun {{reports that}} the Zenata were divided into three large tribes, Jarawa, Maghrawa and Banu Ifran.

5|$|By 390 BC, several Gallic tribes {{had begun}} invading Italy {{from the north}} as their culture {{expanded}} throughout Europe. Most of this was unknown to the Romans at this time, who still had purely local security concerns, but the Romans were alerted when a particularly warlike tribe, the Senones, invaded the Etruscan province of Siena {{from the north and}} attacked the town of Clusium, not far from Rome's sphere of influence. The Clusians, overwhelmed {{by the size of the}} enemy in numbers and ferocity, called on Rome for help. Perhaps unintentionally the Romans found themselves not just <b>in</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Senones, but their primary target. The Romans met them in pitched battle at the Battle of the Allia around 390–387 BC. The Gauls, under their chieftain Brennus, defeated the Roman army of around 15,000 troops and proceeded to pursue the fleeing Romans back to Rome itself and partially sacked the town before being either driven off or bought off.|$|E
5|$|In 911, French Carolingian ruler Charles the Simple {{allowed a}} group of Vikings to settle in Normandy under their leader Rollo. Their {{settlement}} proved successful, and they quickly adapted to the indigenous culture, renouncing paganism, converting to Christianity, and intermarrying with the local population. Over time, the frontiers of the duchy expanded to the west. In 1002, King Æthelred II of England married Emma, the sister of Richard II, Duke of Normandy. Their son Edward the Confessor spent many years in exile in Normandy, and succeeded to the English throne in 1042. This led {{to the establishment of}} a powerful Norman interest in English politics, as Edward drew heavily on his former hosts for support, bringing in Norman courtiers, soldiers, and clerics and appointing them to positions of power, particularly in the Church.

5|$|In February 1858, Ives {{returned}} to the area in a paddle steamer named Explorer. He was leading an expedition up the Colorado from the south, and he wanted Irataba to guide them. The Mohave gave permission to navigate the river, and Cairook, Irataba, and a 16-year-old Mohave boy named Nahvahroopa joined them. Möllhausen again accompanied the expedition, and {{was impressed with the}} Mohave guides, later noting Irataba's enthusiastic handshake and lamenting that their only form of communication was sign language. He also noted that Irataba and the Mohave readily began wearing European clothes given to them by members of the expedition, and showed great interest in smoking tobacco. Aside from the friendship shown to him by Irataba and Cairook, Ives noted that the Mohave appeared less friendly than on earlier occasions, a change that he attributed to their contact with Mormons, who were <b>in</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> US and had succeeded in converting some Mohave.|$|E

5|$|In Roman Egypt {{during the}} 2nd century CE, Claudius Ptolemaeus (Ptolemy) {{attempted}} {{to address the}} problem of the orbital motion of Mars. Observations of Mars had shown that the planet appeared to move 40% faster on one side of its orbit than the other, <b>in</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Aristotelian model of uniform motion. Ptolemy modified the model of planetary motion by adding a point offset from the center of the planet's circular orbit about which the planet moves at a uniform rate of rotation. He proposed that the order of the planets, by increasing distance, was: the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and the fixed stars. Ptolemy's model and his collective work on astronomy was presented in the multi-volume collection Almagest, which became the authoritative treatise on Western astronomy for the next fourteen centuries.|$|E
5|$|In the empire, Frederick {{faced the}} {{opposition}} of the Bavarian Wittelsbach dynasty and of his cousin Sigismund, who was duke in Tyrol, Vorarlberg, and Further Austria then. Sigismund had been <b>in</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Swiss Confederacy, too. When he had been banned by Pope Pius II in a conflict over the nomination of a bishop in Tyrol, the Swiss had annexed the formerly Habsburg territories of the Thurgau. In 1468, Sigismund clashed with the Swiss in the War of Waldshut, which he could end without significant territorial losses only by paying a large ransom, which he financed by pawning territories in the Sundgau and the Alsace to Charles the Bold of Burgundy in 1469. Charles did not, however, help Sigismund against the Swiss, and so Sigismund bought back the territories in 1474 and concluded a peace treaty with the Confederacy, the Ewige Richtung, although the emperor never recognized it. In the following Burgundy Wars, the Swiss and Sigismund both fought against Charles the Bold.|$|E
5|$|Presley {{was born}} on January 8, 1935 in Tupelo, Mississippi, to Gladys Love (née Smith; 1912–1958) and Vernon Elvis Presley (1916–1979), in the two-room shotgun house built by Vernon's father in {{preparation}} for the child's birth. Jesse Garon Presley, his identical twin brother, was delivered stillborn 35 minutes before his own birth. Jesse was buried in an unmarked grave at Priceville Cemetery in Tupelo. After Presley became famous, he asked people on several occasions to try and find the whereabouts of Jesse. The efforts were to no avail, because no papers marked the spot. Presley became close to both parents and formed an especially close bond with his mother. The family attended an Assembly of God church, where he found his initial musical inspiration. Although he was <b>in</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Pentecostal church in his later years, he never officially left it. Rev. Rex Humbard officiated at Presley's funeral, because Presley had been an admirer of Humbard's ministry.|$|E
50|$|The first {{independent}} move of Siemowit VI {{took place}} at the convention of Czersk, where him, together with Duke Konrad III the Red, made a peace treaty <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Teutonic Order.

5|$|The 19th {{and early}} 20th centuries saw {{the rise of}} modern Irish nationalism, {{primarily}} among the Roman Catholic population. The pre-eminent Irish political figure after the Union was Daniel O'Connell. He was elected as Member of Parliament for Ennis in a surprise result and despite being unable to take his seat as a Roman Catholic. O'Connell spearheaded a vigorous campaign that was {{taken up by the}} Prime Minister, the Irish-born soldier and statesman, the Duke of Wellington. Steering the Catholic Relief Bill through Parliament, aided by future prime minister Robert Peel, Wellington prevailed upon a reluctant George IV to sign the Bill and proclaim it into law. George's father had opposed the plan of the earlier Prime Minister, Pitt the Younger, to introduce such a bill following the Union of 1801, fearing Catholic Emancipation to be <b>in</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Act of Settlement 1701.|$|E
5|$|The {{cities of}} Ionia {{remained}} independent {{until they were}} conquered by the Lydians of western Asia Minor. The Lydian king Alyattes II attacked Miletus, a conflict that ended with a treaty of alliance between Miletus and Lydia, that meant that Miletus would have internal autonomy but follow Lydia in foreign affairs. At this time, the Lydians were also <b>in</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Median Empire, and the Milesians sent an army to aid the Lydians in this conflict. Eventually a peaceable settlement was established between the Medes and the Lydians, with the Halys River set up as {{the border between the}} kingdoms. The famous Lydian king Croesus succeeded his father Alyattes in around 560 BC and set about conquering the other Greek city states of Asia Minor.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of Kronan began in October 1665, and the hull was launched on 31 July 1668. The English shipwright Francis Sheldon frequently came <b>in</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> admiralty over the project. The navy administrators {{complained that he}} was unduly delaying the project and was {{spending too much time}} on his own private business ventures. The most aggravating contention was Sheldon's extensive and lucrative export of mast timber to England. Sheldon in turn complained about constant delays on the navy's part and lack of funds. When the ship was launched, the slipway turned out to be too small and the rear section of the keel broke off during the launching. The admiralty demanded an explanation, but Sheldon's reply was that the damage was easily mended and that the problem was that the timber had been left to dry too long. The conflict between the Admiralty and Sheldon dragged on for several years and caused constant delays. The sculptures were finished in 1669, but the rigging, tackling, and arming was drawn out a further three years, to 1672. The first occasion that the ship sailed was during the celebrations of Charles XI's accession as monarch in December 1672.|$|E
500|$|In the 19th century it was {{believed}} that the toponym [...] "Ambrosden" [...] came from a diminutive derivative of the name Ambrosius Aurelianus, a 5th-century British commander of Roman descent, and that the commander had encamped close the present site of Ambrosden to help the neighbouring military garrison at Alchester <b>in</b> <b>conflicts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Anglo-Saxons.
