50|$|Corporate {{bonds are}} divided into two main {{categories}} High Grade (also called Investment Grade) and <b>High</b> <b>Yield</b> (also called Non-Investment Grade, Speculative Grade, or Junk Bonds) according to their credit rating. Bonds rated AAA, AA, A, and BBB are High Grade, while bonds rated BB and below are <b>High</b> <b>Yield.</b> This is a significant distinction as High Grade and <b>High</b> <b>Yield</b> bonds are traded by different trading desks and held by different investors. For example, many pension funds and insurance companies are prohibited from holding more than a token amount of <b>High</b> <b>Yield</b> bonds (by internal rules or government regulation). The distinction between High Grade and <b>High</b> <b>Yield</b> is also common to most corporate bond markets.|$|R
