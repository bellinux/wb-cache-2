40|$|The L 1 {{region of}} the porcine {{adenovirus}} (PAdV) - 3 genome encodes a protein of 622 amino acids named IIIa. Although it binds a neighboring group of nine (GON) hexons at the capsid level and cement the icosahedral shell that contains the viral DNA, little is known regarding its function with respect to viral life cycle. Moreover, the known location <b>of</b> <b>IIIa</b> protein in the capsid may help to express targeting ligands for altering the tropism of PAdV- 3. The objective {{of this study was}} to characterize the <b>IIIa</b> protein <b>of</b> porcine adenovirus Type 3 (PAdV- 3). In order to characterize the IIIa protein, polyclonal antisera were raised in rabbits against different regions <b>of</b> <b>IIIa.</b> Anti-IIIa sera detected a specific protein of 70 kDa in PAdV- 3 infected cells using Western blot assay. Immunofluorescence studies indicated that IIIa is predominantly localized in the nucleus of PAdV- 3 infected cells. Analysis <b>of</b> PAdV- 3 <b>IIIa</b> using antibodies specific for N- and C- terminal domains of the protein suggested that although the N-terminus and C-terminal domains <b>of</b> <b>IIIa</b> are immunogenic, they are not exposed on the surface of PAdV- 3 virions. These results were further confirmed by our inability to isolate a chimeric PAdV- 3 virion containing a heterologous protein fused to the N-terminus or C-terminus <b>of</b> <b>IIIa.</b> Functional analysis suggested that IIIa may transactivate the major late promoter and down regulate the early region (E) 1 A promoter. In order to locate the domains <b>of</b> <b>IIIa</b> responsible for different functions, in-frame deleted/truncated forms <b>of</b> <b>IIIa</b> were constructed. Analysis of the deleted/truncated forms <b>of</b> <b>IIIa</b> suggested that a) the sequences located between amino acids 273 - 410 and between amino acids 410 - 622 b) affect the nuclear localization and transactivation function respectively. Since protein- protein interactions are important for the biological functions of the protein, we determined the interaction <b>of</b> PAdV- 3 <b>IIIa</b> with other viral proteins. IIIa was found to interact with DNA binding protein (DBP), E 3 13. 7 kDa protein, hexon, fiber, and pIX. These results suggest that PAdV 3 IIIa may do more in the viral life cycle than merely act as cement between the hexons to maintain capsid stability and may actually be involved in regulating early to late gene transcription at appropriate stages during viral infection...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} address the lack of {{knowledge}} in the <b>water</b> industry <b>of</b> how policy development can be understood to have shaped the development and application of European Union (<b>EU)</b> drinking <b>water</b> policy. In particular, the paper develops a comparative understanding of how policy development {{can be viewed as}} having affected the development and application <b>of</b> the Drinking <b>Water</b> Directive (80 / 778 /EEC) in England/Wales and the Republic of Ireland. As a result of this focus, the paper explores policy development issues relating to conflicting interests, invalid causal theories, political symbolism, lack of attention to detail by policy makers, and the allocation of duties and resources. It is subsequently established that consideration of these issues is useful in fostering a focused understanding of how policy development may have affected policy application. Despite the significant changes which took place with regard {{to the development of the}} current Drinking Water Directive (98 / 883 /EC), the paper concludes by arguing that greater attention should be accorded the conflicting interests and abilities of Member States during the development <b>of</b> <b>EU</b> <b>water</b> policy, particularly if attempts are to be made to identify measures targeted at improving the application <b>of</b> <b>EU</b> <b>water</b> policy in a diverse political and economic union of member states...|$|R

40|$|Spain's Programa AGUA was {{proposed}} in 2004 {{as a replacement}} for the Spanish National Hydrological Plan and represented a fundamental policy shift in national water management from large inter-basin water transfers to a commitment to desalination. Twenty-one desalination facilities are planned for six provinces on the Spanish Mediterranean coast to supplement their water needs. These include the province of Almería that for the last 30 years has endured a net water abstraction overdraft leading to serious reservoir depletion and groundwater imbalances. Rising water use is a result of increasing demand to support irrigated agriculture (e. g. greenhouse horticulture) and for domestic needs (e. g. rapid urban growth and tourism development), which has led observers to question Almería's long-term water sustainability. Desalinated water alone is unlikely to be sufficient to make up these water deficits and water-users will have to accept a move to full-price water recovery by 2010 under the European Union (<b>EU)</b> <b>Water</b> Framework Directive <b>of</b> which Spain is a signatory. Anticipated water efficiencies resulting from higher water tariffs, increasing water reuse and water infrastructure improvements (including inter-basin transfers), in conjunction with increasing use <b>of</b> desalinated <b>water,</b> are expected to address the province's current water overdraft. However, Almería will need to balance its planned initiatives against long-term estimates of projected agricultural and domestic development and the environmental consequences of adopting a desalination-supported water future...|$|R

Political ideology is shown to have had a greater impact on facilitating the achievement of the Directive's standards in England and Wales. However, it is established that the political priority national governments have accorded compliance has been central to ensuring the application and enforcement of the Directive's standards.
