5|$|A {{survey of}} American adults {{conducted}} in April 2014 showed that 60 percent <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> about Heartbleed. Among those using the Internet, 39 percent had protected their online accounts, for example by changing passwords or canceling accounts; 29 percent believed their personal information was {{put at risk}} because of the Heartbleed bug; and 6 percent believed their personal information had been stolen.|$|E

6000|$|... "Don't they, Carrie? I {{am not so}} sure of that. I <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> {{of women}} who are always nagging their husbands, and giving them no peace of their lives. I <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> of women who think of nothing but dress, and who go about and leave their homes and {{children}} to shift for themselves. I <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> of women who spend all their time spreading scandal. I <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> of--" ...|$|R
6000|$|Nay, certainly, I <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> the Ptolemies' pyramises [...] {{are very}} goodly things; without contradiction, I <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> [...] that.|$|R
5|$|In his memoirs, {{published}} in 2004, cellist János Starker asserts that Szigeti {{was one of}} the giants among the violinists I <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> from childhood on, and my admiration for him is undiminished up to this day.|$|E
5|$|Sales {{figures for}} the game have not been made public, but {{according}} to Bozon, it sold poorly; {{he said that he}} <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> that 20–25,000 copies of the game were produced, which did sell out, but that a second print run did not get made.|$|E
5|$|Some {{witnesses}} {{maintained that}} the killer's claim to be John A. Covington was telling. They said that both Sharp and Beauchamp had been acquainted with John W. Covington, and that Beauchamp often mistakenly called him John A. Covington. Other witnesses told of threats they <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> Beauchamp make against Sharp.|$|E

5|$|The lake village, a crannog or {{man made}} island, was {{discovered}} in 1892 by local medical student Arthur Bulleid, whose father was a local mayor {{and the founder of}} the Glastonbury Antiquarian Society. Bulleid <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> about the lake villages in Switzerland and believed similar sites could be found in his native Somerset.|$|E
5|$|When Marseille {{returned}} to his unit he asked his friends Franzisket, Clade and Schröer, whether they <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> {{what was happening to}} Jews and if perhaps something was underway {{that they did not know}} about. Franszisket recalled that he <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> Jews were being relocated to territory gained in the East but no more. Marseille recounted how he had attempted to ask questions about Jews who had vanished from his neighbourhood, including the family doctor that had delivered him at birth. Regardless of his hero status, when he attempted to bring the subject into any conversation with people who approached him, his enquiries were either met with awkward silences, or people changed the subject or even turned away. Franzisket noticed a change in Marseille's attitude toward his nation's cause. He never spoke of this with his comrades again.|$|E
5|$|After the attack, the Indians torched {{the house}} and left without attacking other dwellings. The next day, Cooley came back to bury the dead; it is unclear who alerted the salvager's team to the attack. After staying at the {{settlement}} for three days, Cooley went to the Cape Florida Lighthouse. One of the missing slaves appeared, reporting that he recognized the assailants as having been acquaintances of the Cooley family. The slave <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> the Indians ascribing the massacre to an act of revenge for Cooley's having failed to obtain the conviction of Chief Alibama's murderers.|$|E

5|$|At {{the age of}} {{thirteen}} Jervis ran away and joined the navy at Woolwich, London. After a short time he returned home as he <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> his family were very upset at his disappearance. Lady Jane Hamilton (mother of Sir William Hamilton) and Lady Burlington became aware of Jervis' desire to join the navy and lobbied his family on his behalf. Eventually they introduced the Jervis family to Admiral George Townshend who agreed to take the boy aboard one of his ships.|$|E
5|$|Bok {{went to the}} market, {{where he}} heard adults say that they had seen smoke coming from nearby villages and <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> gunfire in the distance. People began fleeing the market as Francis saw {{horsemen}} with machine guns. The gunmen surrounded the market and shot the men in Nyamlell. The raiders {{were part of an}} Islamic militia from the northern part of Sudan that conducted periodic raids on the villages of their Dinka neighbors, who were Christians or animists of Sub-Saharan African descent.|$|E
5|$|By mid-August 1942, Stanley had {{recovered}} {{enough to be}} moved to the dysentery wing at Block 151 of Roberts Barracks. Padres Chambers and Payne <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> that Stanley had decorated the prisoners' chapel at Bukit Batok. So they {{asked him if he}} would do some paintings for St Luke's Chapel, which was recently converted from the ground floor of Block 151, near the area where Stanley was recuperating. The Chapel was dedicated to St Luke the Physician. Stanley agreed, and sought inspiration for the proposed paintings in the Gospels.|$|E

5|$|Carson {{first met}} Dorothy Freeman in the Summer of 1953 in Southport Island, Maine. Freeman {{had written to}} Carson {{welcoming}} her to the area when she <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> that the famous author was to become her neighbor. It {{was the beginning of}} an extremely close friendship that would last the rest of Carson's life. Their relationship was conducted mainly through letters, and during summers spent together in Maine. Over the course of 12 years, they would exchange somewhere in the region of 900 letters. Many of these were published in the book Always, Rachel, published in 1995 by Beacon Press.|$|E
5|$|During 2001 Seventh Avenue were finalists for the Brisbane Rock Award, {{which earned}} {{them the right}} to play at Queen Street Mall Basement. This {{performance}} attracted Shawthing Entertainment's Greg Shaw, who became their manager. The band worked with Stuart Stuart (The Veronicas), Dave Nicholas (INXS, Sting), Trey Bruce (Faith Hill) and Randy Staub (Nickelback, Metallica) on song writing or recordings. They met John Woodruff (Savage Garden, Evermore), after he <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> their early demos, who became their next manager in 2001. He recommended them to Sony BMG.|$|E
5|$|Fleming made {{a number}} of revelations about Bond's {{character}} within the book, including showing an emotional side that was not present in the previous stories. In common with Fleming's other Bond stories, he used the names and places of people he knew or <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> of and Blofeld's research station on Piz Gloria was based on Schloss Mittersill, which the Nazis had turned into a research establishment examining the Asiatic races.|$|E
60|$|Now, that word--taxes, taxes, taxes! I <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> it to-night. I <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> it all night. I wish {{somebody}} would change that subject; {{that is a}} very sore subject to me.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} what you may <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> of what <b>has</b> occurred, Lady Rowley. It is natural, however, to suppose that you must <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> me spoken of with censure." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But we <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> of no rapparees in this neighbourhood, Walter," [...] she said. [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> of sad excesses in {{some parts}} of the country, but nothing in this neighbourhood." ...|$|R
5|$|For years, Europeans in Africa <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> of {{an animal}} that they came to call the 'African unicorn'. In his travelogue of {{exploring}} the Congo, Henry Morton Stanley mentioned a kind of donkey that the natives called the atti, which scholars later identified as the okapi. Explorers may have seen the fleeting view of the striped backside as the animal fled through the bushes, leading to speculation that the okapi {{was some sort of}} rainforest zebra.|$|E
5|$|In 1875 no one {{living outside}} {{of two or}} three back streets of Lynn <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> of Christian Science. Now, the very name is a catch phrase. In those early days the leader and teacher paid out half of her ten dollars a week to hire a hall, {{patching}} out the rest of her living with precarious fees as an instructor in mental healing; now, {{she is one of the}} richest women in the United States. She is more than that—she is the most powerful American woman.|$|E
5|$|In the {{afternoon}} {{she would take}} a nap for two hours in her armchair, and then visit her neighbours in the care home, telling them about the latest news she <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> on the radio. At nightfall she would dine quickly, return to her room, listen to music (her eyesight now being too poor for her favorite pastime of crosswords), smoke a last cigarette {{and go to bed}} at 10pm.|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah,"--and Carrie {{moved her}} {{head so that}} he could see the sparkle in her eyes--"you <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> those tales, and {{believed}} them--about a relative of mine. Presumably, you <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> nothing about Captain Heaton?" ...|$|R
60|$|MATEY (uxoriously {{wishing that}} others could <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> this). Very good. Caroliny; {{that is the}} nearest thing I <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> you say. But it's late; we had best be strolling back to our Rolls-Royce.|$|R
