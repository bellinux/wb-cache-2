40|$|The {{construction}} of many dental appliances requires {{the use of}} waxes with specific and often markedly different physical properties. <b>Dental</b> <b>waxes</b> are usually a blend of natural and synthetic materials with the purpose of developing those properties desired for a particular application. In this project, the mechanical properties namely; elastic modulus, compressive strength and flow of three commercially available casting <b>dental</b> <b>waxes</b> were measured at various temperatures ranging from 21 to 45 ˚C. It was also intended to characterize the thermal behavior of these waxes and indicate their phase transitions. Possible correlation between the mechanical and thermal behavior of casting waxes was investigated. The mechanical properties of wax specimens were determined at selected temperatures ± 0. 5 ˚C using a universal testing machine at crosshead speed of 0. 02 inch/min. A differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) analysis was utilized to characterize the thermal behavior of tested waxes. The results of this study showed, in general, that the investigated mechanical properties decreased with increasing temperatures.

40|$|Objective: Complex {{craniosynostosis}} (e. g. coronal plagiocephaly, trigonocephaly, multisuture synostosis or skull malformation {{of unknown}} etiology) requires complex and prolonged cranioplastic procedures {{with a high}} risk of comorbidity (blood loss, temperature decrease, cerebrospinal fluid leak, air embolism…) while most of the treated patients are still infants. Also, the cosmetic results are not always as expected: As evaluation during surgery is time consuming and difficult to obtain, one often remains uncertain determining where to saw, how far to mobilise, how to rotate and how to fix the bone flaps. Certainly in cases of coronal plagiocephaly, when one has to decide how far to advance and how to incline the orbital rim, preoperative planning could be of valuable help. Therefore, we decided to realise three-dimensional skull models in <b>dental</b> <b>wax,</b> enabling us to prepare surgery. Methods: With 1 mm thick and contiguously sliced CT scan of the skull in bone windowing, three-dimensional skull models were created in methylacrylate bij Materialise, a corporation at Leuven, Belgium. At our department, by using negative casts in silicone, various copies of these methylacrylate models were produced in <b>dental</b> <b>wax.</b> These wax models proved anatomically exact and were easy and cheap to manufacture. They were extremely useful in preparing surgery as we could easily cut “bone flaps” with heated knives. These “bone flaps” could be bent, broken, rotated and fixed as in real surgery. However, realising these wax models was time consuming (in the range of 5 hours in a period of 2 days). Results: From March 2005 up to now, we performed cranioplasty on 7 patients with the help of three-dimensional skull modelling. Two patients suffered from unilateral coronal plagiocephaly, (5 m old male, 5 m old female), one from multisuture craniosynostosis (6 m old male with Apert’s syndrom), three from trigonocephaly (5 m old male, 8 m old male, 6 y old male) and one from a malformation in the maxillofrontotemporonasal region of unknown etiology (17 y old male). Surgery was performed in a faster and more confident way on those 7 patients. None of the patients suffered from complications related to surgery. Apart from postoperative respiratory infection problems, no significant postop morbidity was encountered. None of these patients needed to be reoperated. We are confident that surgical comorbidity was reduced and that cosmetic outcome improved significantly thanks to the preoperative planning on the wax models. Conclusions: In spite of the very limited number of patients and the time-consuming preparation, we consider preoperative three-dimensional skull modelling in <b>dental</b> <b>wax</b> as an affordable, reliable, very helpful tool, allowing a reduction in operative duration and therefore comorbidity and to significantly improve cosmetic outcome. We will continue this preoperative planning in cases of complex craniosynostosis...|$|R

40|$|It is {{the desire}} of every dentist and dental {{technician}} to produce a restoration that will fit the patient {{with a minimum of}} adjustments and certainly one that does not require remaking. Yet many abuse the materials with which they work, either through improper manipulation, lack of familiarity with their properties, or by attempting to reduce laboratory time by taking short cuts. Wax is one of the materials that requires more knowledge and skill to manipulate accurately because it has a considerably higher coefficient of thermal expansion (and contraction) than any other dental material. It often contributes considerably to the inaccuracies of cast dental restorations.

30|$|Approximately 4  weeks after healing {{abutment}} connection, intraoral defect including implant abutment and extraoral paranasal defect impressions were taken. The technician managed {{two different}} casts: one cast for nasal wax up and one cast for <b>dental</b> <b>wax</b> up. Superior implant bar supported by [4] zygoma implants was designed crossing the palatal defect {{in order to}} manufacture palatal obturator at a second time. Furthermore, two metal abutments were lodged and fused on the cranial surface of the bar {{in order to receive}} epithesis attachments. The abutments acted as primary crowns and secondary crowns, press-fitted on abutments and were used to take an extraoral position impression of the abutments using the nasal wax up as an individual. In this way, the technician could connect OTK (Ball abutment) attachments on the internal surface of the epithesis and thanks to secondary crowns, the nasal prosthesis can be removed for prosthetic aftercare and follow-up inspections. OTK attachments are commonly used because of their retention in overdenture prosthetic rehabilitation. The female part of this peculiar type of ball attachment is made out of Teflon™ (politetrafluoroetilene) while the male part consisted of a titanium structure. A complete implant-supported bar with two bolt prosthesis was made in order to provide superior arch rehabilitation. At the time of delivery, the palatal defect was closed by a soft base material. The nasal epithesis was made of silicone with an acrylic resin internal plate hosting female OTK attachments, whereas male parts were on the secondary crowns.|$|R

Each proximal root surface was standardized with 600 A grit silicone carbide paper and polished with either <b>waxed</b> <b>dental</b> floss, Superfloss, wood or plastic interdental cleaners, using alkali aluminum silicate polishing paste. All specimens were mounted on a flossing machine and polished with 10 or 20 strokes. Before and after polishing, measurements were recorded with the Surfanalyzer 150 System to produce profile and average roughness tracings. Average maximum peak heights, mean number of peaks, and mean average roughness values were calculated from the tracings. The data were analyzed statistically by paired t-test and Student t-test. No significant mean {{differences were found between the}} number of strokes used. No significant differences were found for <b>waxed</b> <b>dental</b> floss in relation to the values analyzed.

40|$|Drosophila melanogaster is {{a useful}} tool for {{studying}} seizure like activity. A variety of mutants in which seizures can be induced through either physical shock or electrical stimulation is available for study of various aspects of seizure activity and behavior. All flies, including wild-type, will undergo seizure-like activity if stimulated at a high enough voltage. Seizure like activity is an all-or-nothing response and each genotype has a specific seizure threshold. The seizure threshold of a specific genotype of fly can be altered either by treatment with a drug or by genetic suppression or enhancement. The threshold is easily measured by electrophysiology. Seizure-like activity can be induced via high frequency electrical stimulation delivered directly to the brain and recorded through the dorsal longitudinal muscles (DLMs) in the thorax. The DLMs are innervated by part of the giant fiber system. Starting with low voltage, high frequency stimulation, and subsequently raising the voltage in small increments, the seizure threshold for a single fly can be measured. Protocol Specimen Preparation: The night before the experiment, male flies of the desired genotype are anesthetized and placed in a vial with a soft nylon plug. A cotton ball would also work. Following anesthetization, the seizure threshold is altered, so the flies are best left for at least 6 hours, though over night is ideal. On the day of the experiment, the flies are mounted one at a time to glass slides with a layer of <b>dental</b> <b>wax</b> on one side. A single fly is picked up by the head using a 23 gauge needle (with the sharp tip cut off) attached to a vacuum line.

40|$|The feeding {{apparatus}} of many marine molluscan herbivores leaves distinctive {{marks on the}} surface of <b>dental</b> <b>wax.</b> This method can be used in the field to assess the spatial and temporal patterns of gastropod grazing on rocky shores. Among the common gastropod grazers of intertidal habitats on the Isle of Man, distinctive rasping marks were made by docoglossan (Patella vulgata.), rhipidoglossan (Calliostoma zizyphinum. and Gibbula spp.) and larger taenioglossan (Littorina obtusata.) grazers. Our technique for the field deployment of wax surfaces is simple, inexpensive, and permits a realistic placement of the wax surface in the environment. This placement is achieved by casting the wax into small discs (14 mm diameter) and setting them into pre-formed holes in the rock surface. By quantifying either the number of discs scraped or the area of the wax surface scraped, patterns of grazing intensity (defined as areal extent of the surface grazed in a given period) can be assessed over a variety of spatial and temporal scales. To illustrate this method and refine its use, we recorded the grazing patterns of the limpet Patella vulgata for periods from 12 h to 17 days. The optimal period of deployment depended on the specific habitat, but we often found periods of 1 – 14 days to be appropriate. Regular arrays of discs also demonstrated that grazing intensity was spatially variable at a scale of 0. 25 m, and that grazing intensity increased throughout the late winter and spring. This method provides a cheap and direct measure of feeding intensity that is directly relevant to understanding the effect of grazing molluscs on algal communities. Moreover, it can be used over a variety of spatial and temporal scales...|$|R
40|$|Purpose : Soft tissue sarcomas of the {{extremities}} {{account for}} half of all soft tissue sarcomas. Radiotherapy and surgery have been the standard modalities {{in the treatment of}} this type of cancer. Brachytherapy can be used as the sole therapy, if the target volume is localized and easily accessible. This work reports three cases of shoulder soft tissue sarcomas with positive deep resected margins, treated with a combination of external beam radiotherapy and surface mould brachytherapy boost technique. Material and methods : Between January and June 2014, three patients received brachytherapy with sites close to the shoulder, and post-surgery involved deep resected margins. Each mould was made on a base of thermoplastic, over which <b>dental</b> <b>wax</b> was coated and catheters implanted. The target volume was defined as the tissue covering the tumor bed with lateral margins of 2 - 2. 5 cm and depth of 1 - 1. 5 cm. Treatment planning was computed tomography- based and dose prescribed was 85 - 100 % isodose. Treatments has been delivered twice daily, six hours interval, and a review of reactions evaluated. Results : Volume receiving more than 150 % of the prescribed dose has been limited to less than 2 %, and that above 200 % to be inside the mould. Brachytherapy equivalent dose at 2 Gy per fraction (EQD 2) of these patients was 24 and 28. 6 Gy. Maximum dose to organ at risk (OAR) (2 cc of OAR) ranged between 55 - 87 % of prescribed dose, with a median dose being 80 %. All cases had only grade 1 post-radiotherapy skin immediate reactions, which resolved within four weeks. In all patients, no treatment failures were noted at nearly 2 -years post-irradiation. Conclusions : Surface mould brachytherapy in soft tissue sarcomas could be a useful alternative to interstitial bra­chytherapy, especially where the target volume is superficially extensive with underlying critical structures, and where catheter placement may be difficult, such as the shoulder...|$|R

Materials and Methods: A preliminary in vitro study, involving 9 identical single-unit implant-supported crowns (upper central incisor), manufactured with CAD/CAM technology, was perfomed. After cementation with a zinc oxide eugenol cement, each crown was randomly allocated into 3 study groups, according to the instrument used to remove the cement remnants (teflon scaler, stainless steel explorer and <b>waxed</b> <b>dental</b> floss). An experienced professional removed the cement remnants. Afterwards, a blinded researcher evaluated the presence of cement using direct visual observation, standardized digital photographs and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images. In the latter analysis (SEM 75 x), surface alterations in the abutment surface caused by the employed instruments were also registered. A descriptive {{analysis of the data}} was performed. Results: After cementation, cement remnants were observed in all samples. The instrument that eliminated a higher percentage of cement remnants was the stainless steel explorer (59. 4 %) and the worst, the <b>waxed</b> <b>dental</b> floss (27. 6 %). The stainless steel explorer produced scratches in 100 % of the samples (5 to 10 scratches in each sample). Conclusions: Even though cement debris was observed in all samples, stainless steel explorers and teflon scalers seem to be the most effective instruments in the removal of cement remnants in implant-supported restorations. Since stainless steel explorers scratched the abutment surface, teflon scalers seem to be the best option for this particular indication. Dental floss is not a suitable alternative since it removed less cement than the other 2 instruments, and also left some material debris (small threads) over the abutment. A larger sample is required to confirm the present findings...|$|R
40|$|Background: Many cancer {{patients}} who require {{external beam radiotherapy}} such as breast {{cancer patients}}, present with irregular surface topographies and tissue inhomogenieties in the treatment field. Such irregularities give rise to unacceptable dose non-uniformity. Standard fields cannot be applied without compensation for missing tissue. 1 -D and 2 -D missing tissue compensators can be used but they have limitations. 3 -D compensators are the most effective but they are normally fabricated using very expensive automated systems. Objectives: To study the variation of linear attenuation coefficients of different materials in megavoltage photon beams, select a tissue equivalent compensating material and commission a local 3 -D manual missing tissue compensator cutter. Methods and materials: Linear attenuation coefficients were measured for tin, River sand mix, Lincolnshire bolus and <b>dental</b> modelling <b>wax</b> for different energy megavoltage photon beams. Measurements were done in a water phantom using a cylindrical ionisation chamber at varying depths. The CT numbers and densities of the materials were also measured. Negative plaster of paris moulds of the breast and head and neck areas were made using a RANDOTM Alderson anthropomorphic phantom from typically simulated fields. 3 -D missing tissue compensators were then fabricated on the manual cutter and were tested for their effectiveness during treatment delivery. Results: Linear attenuation coefficients were dependent on photon beam energy, the thickness and density of the attenuator, but independent of the depth of measurement for compensator thickness of more than 2 cm. Lincolnshire bolus and <b>dental</b> modelling <b>wax</b> with CT numbers of – 78 ± 9 and - 88 ± 18 and densities of 1. 4 ± 0. 0 g/cm 3 and 0. 9 ± 0. 0 g/cm 3 respectively {{can be regarded as}} tissue equivalent materials. The fabricated 3 -D missing tissue compensators were effective in correcting for dose non-uniformities compared to fields with no beam-modifying devices or wedges (1 -D compensators). Conclusions: The 3 -D missing tissue compensators were effective in correcting for dose non-uniformities in treatment fields involving very irregular surface topographies compared to 1 -D and 2 -D methods. They can be fabricated cheaply using a 3 -D manual missing tissue compensator cutter. Quality control procedures need to be followed during fabrication...|$|R

The area of the articular surfaces was estimated by molding a sheet of <b>dental</b> <b>wax.</b> Using special graphics software, a novel procedure was described to calculate the area under the curve, which was postulated to indicate the degree of curvature. Tension test was applied using a testometric machine, which was locally modified to suit biological specimens. A finite element analysis was designed to study the articulating bones under different loading conditionsIn the hip joint, the area of the articular surface of the head of the femur and that of the lunate showed no significant statistical difference. For the shoulder joint, the articular areas of the head of the humerus and the glenoid were statistically different. No statistical significance was observed regarding curvature of the articular surfaces within both the hip and shoulder joints; however, the values were significantly different between the hip and shoulder. In the tension test, the site of rupture of the capsule of the shoulder joint was found to be at its anteroinferior part. The more contact between the area of the cup and ball, as was demonstrated in the hip joint, the more stable the joint. On the contrary, the shoulder articular surfaces have less area of contact, which makes it more mobile and decreases stability. The insignificant difference in curvature within both joints indicates a good congruity and thus more stability especially during joint movement. The curvature difference between the head of femur and the head of humerus indicates that the range of motion is quite different for the two joints. Results obtained from the finite element analysis were important in understanding the areas of stress concentration and were thoroughly explained from the anatomical point of view and linked to muscle and joint capsule attachments. The model of the joints developed in this study {{can be used as a}} computational tool to joint biomechanics and to prosthetic implant analysis.

40|$|The {{first chapter}} of the {{theoretical}} part of the bachelor's thesis outlines radiotherapy in general. Radiotherapy is a clinical treatment using ionising radiation to treat malignant and benign diseases. It {{is one of the}} youngest medical disciplines. The development of radiotherapy began in November 1895, when Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen discovered X-rays. Radiotherapy became an independent medical specialty in 1922. The second chapter describes planning in radiotherapy. Irradiation plans for radiotherapy are created {{on the basis of a}} planning system. ECLIPSE planning system is used in the oncology department in České Budějovice Hospital. Phantoms are the theme of the third chapter. Phantoms are materials whose radiation absorption corresponds to human tissue. Water is a basic universal phantom material. In addition to water, also other materials are used, such as polystyrene, plexiglass, paraffin, PMMA etc. The last, fourth chapter of the theoretical part, deals with boluses. Boluses are tissue-equivalent materials that are put on the patient's skin during irradiation when it is needed to increase the surface dose and at the same decrease the depth dose. Moreover, bolus is used to compensate the missing tissue. Bolus is most often used to diagnose patients after mastectomy due to breast cancer. The most important characteristic of boluses is their ability to absorb radiation. In the oncology department in České Budějovice Hospital, bolus from <b>dental</b> <b>wax</b> Ceradent had been used before. A bolus made from this material was hard and uneasy to shape. That is why it did not fit tightly to the chest wall of the patient. For this reason a new line of boluses was obtained for the oncology department, from gel material supplied by CIVCO company with dimensions 30 x 30 cm and thickness 0. 3 cm, 0. 5 cm and 1 cm, in "skin" and "skinless" version. These new boluses stick easily to the patient's skin and copy the shape of the body. The first objective of my bachelor's thesis was to compare the doses planned and measured under the bolus from the new material. This objective is elaborated in the practical part of the bachelor's thesis in chapter presenting the results. Another objective was to elaborate the principles for the use of bolus. These principles are described in the theoretical part of the bachelor's thesis in chapter describing the use of bolus in radiotherapy. The following hypothesis was suggested in the thesis: "It can be assumed that the generated bolus in the planning system corresponds to the scanned bolus on the CT with patient and that there is a difference between the planned dose and measured one. " To confirm or refute the working hypothesis, measuring was executed in the oncology department in České Budějovice Hospital. Data about individual doses were collected boluses generated in the Eclipse planning system of different width (0. 3 cm, 0. 5 cm, 1 cm) on phantoms. Three types of phantoms from PMMA were used for the purposes of this measuring. First, the measuring was executed on phantom in the shape of the chest wall of a patient after breast ablation. Then, the tabular phantom and universal IMRT verification phantoms were used. The measurement was executed on the Clinac 2100 C/D linear accelerator, later on the new TrueBeam 2. 5. linear accelerator. All these doses were measured by ionisation chamber from PTW company with volume of 0. 125 cm 3. The obtained data were processed in tables and deviations of individual doses were calculated. Based on this measurement it was found out that the deviations of all doses are less than 3 %. And therefore also the hypothesis of the thesis was confirmed. There really is a difference between individual doses, but not so significant to affect the size of dose during the planning. As for the practical outcome, generated boluses will be used as standard in the oncology department in České Budějovice Hospital...|$|R
40|$|What is rosin {{and where}} is it found? Rosin, also known as colophony, is the sap or sticky {{substance}} that comes from pine and spruce trees. Its "stickiness " lends itself to being used {{in a wide range}} of products. The table below shows only some of the many products that contain rosin we may come into contact with either at home or at work. Home/recreational sources Work sources Cosmetics (e. g. mascaras, lipsticks, eyeshadows, concealer creams, nail varnish) Adhesives (e. g. sticking plasters and tapes, glues) Medicines (e. g. wart removers, cold sore creams, ostomy products, nappy creams, haemorrhoid creams, sprays) Toiletries (e. g [...] transparent soaps, hair removing <b>wax,</b> <b>dental</b> floss, sunscreens, blister creams and first-aid ointments) Household items (e. g. grease removers for clothes, shoe wax, polish for floors, cars and furniture, laundry soaps, fly strips) Recreational (e. g. sport racket handles, athletic grip aids, golf club grips, bows for stringed instruments, fireworks, ski wax) Chewing gum Firewood and pine trees in the garden Paper products: one of the largest single uses of colophony is in the manufacture of paper and paperboard Paint, varnishes, lacquers, sealant...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{the present}} study was to test the effects of interdental {{cleansing}} with dental floss on supragingival biofilm removal in natural dentition during a 3 -week period of experimental biofilm accumulation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study was performed as a single-blind, parallel, randomised, controlled clinical trial using the experimental gingivitis model (Löe et al, 1965). Thirty-two students were recruited and assigned to one of the following experimental or control groups: Group A used a fluoride-containing dentifrice (NaF dentifrice) on a toothbrush for 60 s twice a day, Group B used an unwaxed dental floss twice a day, Group C used a <b>waxed</b> <b>dental</b> floss twice a day in every interproximal space and Group D rinsed twice a day for 60 s with drinking water (control). RESULTS: During 21 days of abolished oral hygiene, the groups developed various amounts of plaque and gingivitis. Neither of the cleansing protocols alone allowed the prevention of gingivitis development. Toothbrushing alone yielded better outcomes than did any of the flossing protocols. Interdental cleansing with a waxed floss had better biofilm removal effects than with unwaxed floss. CONCLUSIONS: Toothbrushing without interdental cleansing using dental floss and interdental cleansing alone cannot prevent the development of gingivitis. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} health needs for health {{promoting}} Ashram schools in rural Wardha. Methods: It was a cross sectional study undertaken in 10 Ashram schools, using qualitative (SWOT analysis, Transect walks and Semi-structured interviews of teachers) and quantitative (Survey) methods. Hemoglobin examination {{of all children}} was done by using WHO hemoglobin color scale. Anthropometric measurements such as height and weight of each child were obtained. Physical activity score for each child was calculated. The manual content analysis of qualitative data was done and the quantitative data was entered and analyzed using Epi_info (version 6. 04 d) software package. Results: Out of 1287 children examined, 724 (56. 3 %) were boys and 563 (43. 7 %) were girls. About 576 (44. 8 %), 213 (16. 6 %), 760 (59. 1 %) children had untrimmed nails, dirty clothes and unclean teeth respectively. More girls had (31. 6 %) lice infestation than boys (18. 2 %). Eighty six (6. 7 %), 75 (5. 8 %) and 110 (8. 6 %) children had scabies, fungal infection and multiple boils on their skin respectively and 158 (12. 3 %), 136 (10. 6 %) and 66 (18. 3 %) children had <b>dental</b> caries, <b>wax</b> in ears and worm infestation respectively. Notably, 988 (76. 8 %) children had iron deficiency anemia which was significantly more among girls (81. 9 %) than boys (72. 8 %). About 506 (39. 3 %) children consumed any tobacco product in last one month. About 746 (57. 9 %) children were classified to have sedentary physical activity. Among 774 children (> 12 years), 183 (23. 6 %) and 34 (4. 4 %) children felt lonely ‘sometime’ and ‘most of the times’ respectively. About 398 (94. 3 %) boys and 342 (97. 2 %) girls {{did not know the}} modes of transmission of HIV/AIDS. Conclusions: In conclusion, there was high prevalence of risk factors for both communicable and non-communicable diseases in Ashram school environment. This dictates the urgent need for teacher driven, needs based and school based intervention that can screen and identify potentially preventable health conditions among underprivileged Ashram school children...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} {{effectiveness}} of an oral irrigator (OI) with a prototype jet tip or a standard jet tip to floss as adjunct to daily toothbrushing on gingival bleeding. Methods: In this single masked, 3 -group parallel, 4 -week home use experiment, 108 subjects {{were randomly assigned to}} one of three groups: 1) OI with a prototype jet tip; 2) OI with a standard jet tip; 3) <b>waxed</b> <b>dental</b> floss. All groups used their assigned product once a day as adjunct to twice daily toothbrushing for two minutes with a standard ADA reference toothbrush. Professional instructions were given by a dental hygienist in OI use or floss use according to written instructions. All subjects also received a toothbrush instruction leaflet (Bass technique). Subjects were assessed for both bleeding and plaque at baseline and after two weeks and four weeks and were instructed to brush their teeth approximately 2 to 3 hours prior to their assessment. Results: With respect to mean bleeding scores the ANCOVA analysis with baseline as covariate and week 4 as dependent variable showed a significant difference between groups in favor of both the oral irrigator groups. For plaque, however, no significant difference among groups was observed. Conclusion: When combined with manual toothbrushing the daily use of an oral irrigator, either with prototype or standard jet tip, is significantly more effective in reducing gingival bleeding scores than is the use of dental floss, as determined within the limits of this 4 -week study design...|$|R
40|$|Context: For {{successful}} endodontic treatment, it′s {{imperative to}} locate and obturate all root canals. As concluded by Ingle, the major cause for failure of root canal therapy is in ability to recognize all theexisting canals and subsequent failure in their obturation. Aim: To analyze the canal configuration of the mesio-buccal root of maxillary first permanent molar teeth. Materials and Methods: A total of 30 recently extracted human permanent maxillary first molars were collected and stored in a container with 5 % Sodium Chloride solution for four days. Teeth with open apices, external resorption, improperly formed roots and teeth with previous restorations were excluded. Using the <b>dental</b> modeling <b>wax,</b> teeth were arranged in a ′U′ shaped arch with roots embedded inside the wax and occlusal surface remaining free. 10 teeth were arranged in each arch and three such sample plates were prepared. Flat surface of the base encasing enabled the plate to be mounted on ﬂat plastic bite plate. With bite plate roughly centered in the focal trough area Axial, Coronal and Sagittal section Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) images were taken with Kodak 9000 Extra-oral Imaging System. Images displayed on a monitor were inspected by two endodontists using Kodak Dental Imaging Software 3 D Module V 2. 2. Statistical Analysis: When the data was observed, {{it was found that}} 24 teeth out of total 30 teeth examined showed some variation (i. e. possible additional canal) {{along the length of the}} mesio-buccal root canal. Out of these 24 teeth, 13 showed presence of additional canal at coronal third, 7 showed presence of additional canal at middle third and four showed presence of additional canal in apical third level. Percentage analysis was done as there was no group comparison to be done. Results: Cone-Beam Volumetric Tomography (CBVT) evaluation positively identiﬁed the variations in mesio-buccal canal in 80 % of samples. Out of these, 54. 16 % were in coronal 3 rd, 29. 16 % in middle 3 rd and 16. 66 % were in apical 3 rd. Conclusion: Within the limitations of this study, it can be concluded that- (1) more than half of maxillary ﬁrst molars have four canals and (2) most of the additional canals were located in the MBR and CBVT is a good diagnostic tool to help diagnose these additional canals. Further investigations using larger sample sizes would be helpful...|$|R
