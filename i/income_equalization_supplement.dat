40|$|This paper {{addresses}} empirically {{determinants of}} individual {{support for the}} Welfare State. We examine the interrelation of informal institutions with the perceived quality of a country's institutional framework. As a proxy for informal institutions, we concentrate on three core beliefs (trust in other people, perceived control over one's own life, and religiousness) which reflect {{different aspects of the}} way people feel about internal and external constraints in managing their own lives. To analyze preferences we follow a comprehensive concept of the Welfare State, measuring attitudes toward its two basic roles, (income) redistribution and government intervention. For this purpose the paper uses survey data from the World Values Survey/European Values Study as well as different indicators for governance quality. Our results indicate that people who interpret their life course as being not at their own disposition report a substantially more positive attitude toward <b>income</b> <b>equalization</b> and government interventions. A higher quality of public administration and low confidence in major private companies amplify preferences for redistribution and intervention of people under such an external locus of control. Social trust is generally associated with higher support for redistribution and government intervention only if perceived quality of administration is high and confidence in companies is low. People who assert themselves as religious are less favorable toward <b>income</b> <b>equalization.</b> While variation in administration quality {{does not appear to have}} an impact on the relationship between religiousness and <b>income</b> <b>equalization</b> preferences, religious people are substantially less supportive of redistribution and government intervention especially if confidence in major companies is high...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} I theorize {{the roles of}} {{effective}} demand and Say’s Law in the Marxist theory of exploitation and accumulation. I claim that an exogenous rate of exploitation, or an exogenous functional distribution of income between profits and wages, implies deploying the strongest version of Say’s law, which leads profit rates not to equalize across sectors. Marx’s own procedure in Capital III of simultaneously supposing an exogenous rate of exploitation and profit rate equalization was therefore logically inconsistent. Once Keynes’ principle of effective demand is introduced, the rate of exploitation, and hence the distribution of income between wages and profits, becomes endogenous to aggregate demand. Profit rates can then equalize across sectors and prices of production can function as gravitational centers for market prices in a competitive economy. If we aim at developing a theory that is both empirically relevant and logically consistent, Marxist scholars must drop Say’s Law.

40|$|A {{main reason}} for {{founding}} the European Union was to remove internal trade obstacles and to establish a Single Market within its borders. Along with the increasing integration of international markets, an ever-increasing diversification of firms {{in tandem with the}} development of multinational enterprises is observable. Legislative authorities of the European Union and its member states are faced with the challenge of ensuring that their corporate tax systems keep pace with this economic transformation of companies and markets. Hence, {{in order to meet the}} requirements of an integrated European market, in 2001 the European Commission proposed a switch from Separate Accounting to Formula Apportionment as the leading corporate income taxation system in the European Union. Basically, corporate income of multinational enterprises can be taxed according to these two different principles. At present Separate Accounting is applied at the international level, while some countries like the U. S., Canada, Germany and Switzerland use Formula Apportionment at the state or federal level. Under the current system of Separate Accounting each subsidiary of a multinational enterprise is treated as a separate entity subject to national tax law. For this reason multinationals have to value their intra-firm trade using internal transfer prices, which should meet an external standard of comparison, so-called arm’s length prices. Because of the very nature of internal trade with firm-specific tangibles and intangibles evaluating adequate transfer prices proved difficult. Consequently, Separate Accounting was identified as one reason for manipulations in favor of profit shifting for tax saving purposes. That is why the European Commission regards the consolidation of profits including cross-border loss offset for calculating a multinational company’s tax base as a more suitable approach in the economic union and advocates the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB). To allocate the consolidated tax base to the taxing countries a splitting mechanism is needed. Hence, the CCCTB proposal includes a system of Formula Apportionment. A formula apportions a share of the overall tax base depending on the multinational enterprise’s geographical economic activity in the respective country. The European Commission favors a common three-factor apportionment formula containing assets, labor and sales to represent the production and consumption side. The European Commission’s proposal has initiated a continuing politico-economic discussion about the efficiency and distributional consequences of the transition to Formula Apportionment in Europe. This doctoral thesis evaluates particular issues within this debate by presenting three theoretical articles to answer specific research questions. The articles are based on the methodological concept of a Nash tax competition model under perfect symmetry, where countries choose their corporate tax rates non-cooperatively. The non-cooperative behavior of one country may impose fiscal externalities on other countries and thereby renders the tax policy inefficient. This dissertation focuses on the derivation, explanation and interpretation of the resulting inefficiencies under Separate Accounting and Formula Apportionment. For this reason it contributes three papers to the theoretical literature of optimal tax policies in a non-cooperative equilibrium of tax rates. The work aims to compare and discuss the alternative policy options. The first article pertains to the public debate about the right taxation principle to apply in Europe. The article investigates the effect of fiscal equalization on the efficiency properties of corporate income tax rates chosen under the taxation principles of Separate Accounting and Formula Apportionment. Fiscal equalization ensures efficiency if the marginal transfer just reflects the fiscal and pecuniary externalities of tax rates. In contrast to previous studies, tax base equalization (Representative Tax System) does not satisfy this condition, but combining tax revenue and private <b>income</b> <b>equalization</b> does, regardless of which taxation principle is implemented. This finding implies that it does not matter whether MNEs are taxed according to Separate Accounting or Formula Apportionment if there is <b>equalization</b> of national <b>income</b> (i. e. private income plus tax revenues). Under Formula Apportionment, tax base equalization is superior to tax revenue equalization if the wage income externality is sufficiently large. Even though the European Union does not have an explicit equalization system, a part of the Unions’s budget is financed by contributions from the member states. The implied income redistribution would indeed not be enough to ensure efficiency of corporate income taxation, since the budget is not an equalization system in the sense of our analysis. But the very existence of income redistribution in Europe might indicate that reforming the member states’ contributions to the budget in a suitable way may politically be easier to achieve than replacing an implemented corporate tax system. The second article refers to the sales factor in the proposed three-factor formula under Formula Apportionment. The incorporation of a sales factor in the formula as well as the assignment of sales at the place of origin or destination are hotly debated issues. The CCCTB Working Group suggested in 2007 the inclusion of sales following the destination principle but also mentioned that “ [...] . most member states experts that would support the inclusion of sales as a factor would prefer sales measured ‘at origin’ ”. With regard to the most recent proposal by the European Commission in 2011, the European Parliament advocated that the sales weight be lowered to 10 %. The Committee of the Internal Market and Consumer Protection even called for the removal of the sales factor. In contrast, from Canada and the United States, the opposite development has been observed, namely the increasing importance of the sales factor. Taking a two-country Nash tax competition model with a sales-only formula and market power, we investigate (i) whether the transition from Separate Accounting to Formula Apportionment mitigates tax competition and improves welfare and (ii) whether tax competition is weakest when sales are measured with the origin principle. The driving force is a negative consumption externality that hampers the positive formula externality present for both the origin and destination principle. The third paper investigates the Commission’s recommendation to implement a transition process to Formula Apportionment. During the change Formula Apportionment should be optional for multinational enterprises. Recent empirical literature proves that profit consolidation reduces multinational enterprises’ involuntary costs for complying with different tax laws, but increases discretionary compliance costs incurred by tax planning activities. That is why the third article considers a two-country model with multinationals that are heterogeneous with respect to their involuntary compliance costs. Additionally, multinational enterprises using the Formula Apportionment system face higher discretionary compliance costs due to restricted tax base manipulation opportunities. Hence, multinational enterprises would prefer to be taxed under Formula Apportionment if and only if under Separate Accounting the involuntary compliance costs exceed the tax advantage due to better profit shifting possibilities. We show that a non-negative threshold value of involuntary compliance costs exists such that multinationals with costs above this level choose Formula Apportionment. We prove in a symmetric setting that starting from a pure Separate Accounting system with national revenue maximization, a transition from Separate Accounting to an optional Formula Apportionment increases the non-cooperative tax rates and national revenues for both countries ending up with the results of pure Formula Apportionment. This is because with identical tax rates the multinational enterprise cannot benefit from the better profit shifting opportunities under Separate Accounting but saves involuntary compliance costs. In our analysis the optional system of tax base consolidation promises an efficiency enhancement for the member countries. Hence, we deliver an additional argument in support of an international agreement on the CCCTB proposal. Einer der Hauptgründe für die Entstehung der Europäischen Union (EU) war das Ziel, interne Handelshemmnisse zu beseitigen, um innerhalb der Unionsgrenzen einen gemeinsamen Markt zu etablieren. Parallel zur zunehmenden Integration der internationalen Märkte ist eine vermehrte Diversifikation von Unternehmen zu beobachten, welche durch die Entstehung multinationaler Konzerne begleitet wird. Für die Gesetzgeber der EU und ihrer Mitgliedsstaaten bedeutet dies, ihre Körperschaftsteuersysteme laufend an diesen Transformationprozess anzupassen. Um dabei den Anforderungen des EU-Binnenmarktes gerecht zu werden, erachtet die Europäische Kommission eine umfassende Reform der Körperschaftsbesteuerung als notwendig. Im Jahr 2001 schlug die Kommission deshalb vor, für multinationale Unternehmen das Unternehmensteuersystem der separaten Gewinnbesteuerung durch eine formelbasierte Gewinnbesteuerung abzulösen. Aktuell wird die separate Gewinnbesteuerung vorwiegend auf der internationalen Ebene verwendet, während einige Länder wie die USA, Kanada, Deutschland und die Schweiz die Formelbesteuerung innerhalb ihrer förderalen Strukturen nutzen. Bei der separaten Gewinnbesteuerung wird jede Konzerntochter als eigenständiges Unternehmen behandelt, das der nationalen Steuergesetzgebung unterliegt.

Much of the protection in a company depends upon the company's interested parties themselves being careful. In order to be able to judge the risks, creditors require access to correct accounts. The capital accounted for by the company is also, for the benefit of the creditors, surrounded by protective regulation. In the perspective of the creditors' protection consisting of information and equity protection regulations, consolidated accounts play an important part. From the point of view of the group, the parent company has, in its subsidiary a possession of assets. The subsidiary owns its assets, but the parent company also owns the same assets indirectly. The parent company's possession of the subsidiary's assets is accounted for by its ownership of shares in the subsidiary. The shares in the subsidiary are to be treated as fixed assets. Special valuation rules apply to such assets. These valuation rules prevent the parent company from showing unconverted profits. After the fusion, the group consisting of the parent company and its subsidiary ceases to exist. It is not necessary to demand protection for the creditors of the group or of the subsidiary at this stage. Instead, it is more important to protect those creditors who will have claims in the parent company after the fusion. Other creditors can receive securities or payment for their claims as part of the fusion procedure. It is therefore necessary that the accounting of the fusion takes place from the parent company's side. From the perspective of the parent company, it is its creditors who stand to lose due to the redistribution of capital in the company accounts. A detrimental redistribution has taken place if previously restricted equity becomes non-restricted. It is important to prevent the parent company from creating new non-restricted equity. Rather than being permitted to create new non-restricted equity, the parent company should, after the fusion, only control the same amount of non-restricted equity as it did in the group before the fusion. As part of the stock of the group, the entire non-restricted equity of the subsidiary cannot be transferred to the parent company. Profits or reserves which have been earned prior to the acquisition of the subsidiary can, for example, not be transferred without a corresponding devaluation of the parent company's shares. In principle, such profits of the subsidiary have formed restricted equity from the point of view of the parent company. In the accounts of the parent company, these profits have been included as fixed assets in the form of shares in the subsidiary. The parent company has not been able to pay out these profit funds by increasing the value of its shares. Nor has the parent company been able to pay out these funds by first having the subsidiary pay them out to the parent company. In such a case, the parent company would, of course, devalue the shares of the subsidiary to the same degree. A loss would have been created by this devaluation which would have reduced the possibilities for paying dividends. Taxational consequences of fusions There is no direct connection between the taxational regulations and the regulations in corporate law concerning fusions. From the point of view of taxation, different objectives have been of importance than the protection of creditors. The taxational regulations have, however, been developed from the civil fusion procedure. The taxational regulations serve to guarantee that companies pay tax• on their incomes. In this context, fusions are events which can create income or outlay. In turn, the business event itself is also taxed. In the sections dealing with taxational aspects, I have treated fusion as an alternative business event. Tax forms an outlay in the business of a company. Thus, companies seek to keep tax costs at as low a level as possible. This means that the fusion procedure is used if no other action will entail lower tax costs. In my opinion, certain actions are, from the point of view of taxation, equal' to the fusion procedure. These include, among others, transactions involving companies with collected profits. Companies can also achieve the same effects, from the point of view of taxation, as with fusion by means of various <b>income</b> <b>equalizations.</b> Companies may simply transfer assets and avoid taxation by keeping within the regulations concerning group subsidies or tax exemption for share dividends. By applying regulations and inconsistencies between different regulatory systems, tax-payers can obtain taxation benefits. The restrictive interpretation of the taxation regulations, has in fact resulted in the development of procedures which are similar to those which involve a tax burden. The inventiveness of taxpayers in finding ways to legally avoid taxes is great. Many of the tax-related procedures which have been developed are based upon one person taking over assets from another. The idea is that the take-over brings taxation advantages. Such possibilities have been brought about, in part, by the inconsistency in the taxation of legal as opposed to physical persons. In some cases, a company can transfer untaxed and taxed funds from another company to itself. The 'raison d'etre' of a company is to make a profit for its owners. Taxation legislation is so formed that taxes are first levied on profits at the company level, and later, when dividends are paid, at the level of the individual share-holder. In order to avoid double taxation in the private sector, rules exist which allow parent companies to receive tax exempt payments from subsidiary companies. There are also other possibilities for parent companies to transfer funds to themselves from subsidiaries without paying tax on them. One such possibility is group subsidy. A company can also acquire another company with the intention of transferring assets to itself after the acquisition. Such transactions depend on the fact that companies, but not physical individuals, are exempt from taxation in the transfer of the acquired company's assets to themselves. The taxation laws are detailed and far reaching. They include, for example, special rules concerning the transfer of assets where one of the companies involved is an investment or trustee company. Tax payers can, using creative accounting, ease their tax burdens by utilizing the different tax regulations applying to different types of companies. Different types of companies are taxed differently for various procedures. A trustee company cannot, for example, receive tax exempt dividends. Therefore, trustee companies seek to find possibilities of income adjustment between themselves and their subsidiaries. One such possibility to receive untaxed dividends is for the trustee company to change its status in such a way that it is no longer subject to the regulations concerning trustee companies. The company can achieve this by initiating some active enterprise or by acquiring an active company. These days, fusion between a subsidiary and its parent company can be included among the income adjusting transactions which can be made within the private sector. The tax regulations are to be found in SIL § 2 article 4. In principle, the regulations exempt companies from taxation of profit arising from fusions. Fusions of Parent companies and their subsidiaries would otherwise have involved taxation consequences in line with income tax legislation. A fusion is. the taking over of a subsidiary's assets by its parent company whereby the parent company actually makes a profit (or alternatively loss). A fusion is a business event in which a parent company exchanges shares in the subsidiary for the assets and debts of that subsidiary. This business event should, therefore, not involve income taxation. The intention behind the fusion regulations is that the companies involved should be regarded as if they had represented one tax payer from the outset. Aided by the regulations for tax relief in the case of fusions, fusions become, essentially, a way of unifying a parent company and its subsidiary into a single taxpaying unit. Fusions also give beneficial taxation effects as the companies are not taxed as part of the unification process. In those cases where fusion brings about taxation, it is likely that this would act as a deterrent. Fusions are therefore not usually undertaken in cases where they bring about considerable negative consequences. As the companies involved are not taxed in conjunction with a fusion, the procedure implies a greater degree of tax reduction than do other restructuring processes. The occurrence of beneficial taxation consequences in connection with fusions is to a large extent due to the fact that the regulations surrounding fusions do not correspond to those connected with distribution of dividends, group subsidies and other transfers of assets between companies. We can take the fusion of a trustee company and another company as an example. As the acquiring company, the trustee company can transfer assets to itself in a way which would otherwise not be possible due to dividend distribution and group subsidy regulations. Fusions also make it possible for companies, using various transactions, to offset losses made by either the parent company or the subsidiary against profits made by the companies. The parent company can, for example, take over assets from the subsidiary and value them at levels other (lower) than the taxation level of the subsidiary. Later the parent company can revalue the acquired assets at a higher level thus offsetting the profit gained against its own losses. In some cases, the parent company can also take over assets at higher values, then directly offsetting the profit gained against corresponding losses. Similar effects can occasionally be brought about using group subsidy and dividend distribution regulations. In most cases, however, fusion is the most beneficial method of transferring income from a subsidiary to its parent company...|$|R
