50|$|A {{problem that}} {{shows up in}} these types of {{incidents}} is that receivers in hand-held radios are subjected to signal levels {{that are likely to}} overload the receiver. Several radios may be transmitting within feet of one another on different channels. If overloading occurs, only very strong signals can be received while weaker signals disappear and are not received. The hand held radio receivers shown in the documentary appeared to work properly even though several other hand-held radios were transmitting only feet away. This is a hostile environment and suggests the <b>hand-held</b> <b>equipment</b> used by FDNY had good quality receivers, though in this case, the suggestion is incorrect. Second-hand observation is hardly the proper way to 'test' radio receivers or to distinguish 'good quality' from 'bad' and this is likely a source of continued misunderstanding; particularly when these same radios were operating at higher floors, in closer proximity to, and in direct line-of-sight of digital cellular repeaters. Those repeaters were likely operating at unlicensed power levels, which was a common practice of cellular providers at the time, and continues to this day. Footage reveals intelligible recovered audio coming out of the radios and shows radio users communicating with others. This may not have been true of the entire WTC complex but was true of radio users in the crowded lobby.|$|E

40|$|The {{occupational}} {{exposure to noise}} and vibration transmitted by earth moving machinery and <b>hand-held</b> <b>equipment</b> represents a major occupational health issue in mining and mine reclamation activities. Previous research proved that noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) can be amplified by the exposure to hand-transmitted vibration; in fact {{it has been suggested}} that workers affected by vibration white finger syndrome (VWF) can be at higher risk of hearing loss, as the vibration might cause the vasoconstriction of the blood vessels in the inner ear. The article discusses the result of the exposure assessment for the workers employed in a number of abandoned mines located in southern Sardinia, where extensive mine remediation and environmental rehabilitation work is currently in progress. The personal exposure to noise, whole-body vibration and hand-arm vibration has been evaluated on the basis of the measurements taken on-site, considering the remediation tasks typically performed by the workers...|$|E
40|$|Hand–arm {{vibration}} (HAV) is {{an occupational}} hazard to workers using hand-held mechanical equipment. Highway utilities {{maintenance and repair}} operatives (HUMRo) use an array of such equipment; their risk is assessed as a basis to inform health and safety management, in particular, {{as a first step}} in helping establish a semi-automated risk assessment system within a collaborating national (GB) utility contractor organisation. A work study regime is implemented with the collaborating contractor to record HUMRo's use of mechanical <b>hand-held</b> <b>equipment</b> during typical working days. Analyses on these data determine average daily HAV exposure levels and these are evaluated against UK legislative benchmarks. The majority of HUMRo are exposed below the legislative “action” level; while 15 % were above this, of which 1. 5 % of these exceeded the defined legal maximum exposure.

40|$|A {{significant}} proportion of rockfall accidents occur during re-entry into a workplace, when the initial inspection and making safe procedures are carried out to stabilise the rock before work in the area begins. The reason is that making safe {{is one of the}} most stressful and dangerous activities an underground miner can undertake. The operator often is unable to work at a safe distance and is sometimes forced to work directly underneath unstable rock ilise the rock effectively and efficiently from a safe distance before work begins when attempting to “make safe”. The equipment currently used is archa ic and there is a need to devise a simple system to enable operators to stab in the area. Studies undertaken through the University of Laval, Canada, have shown that scaling (making safe) with conventional <b>hand-held</b> <b>equipment</b> is difficult, arduous and stressful, with operators needing to rest for rapidly increasing amounts of time after only 8 minutes of activity. This is almost a guarantee that excavations requiring a lot of barring will not be made safe adequately...|$|E
40|$|ALIS (Advanced Landmine Imaging System), {{which is}} a novel {{landmine}} detection sensor system combined with a metal detector and GPR, was developed. This is a <b>hand-held</b> <b>equipment,</b> which has a sensor position tracking system, and can visualize the sensor output in real time on a head-mounted PC display. In order to achieve the sensor tracking system, ALIS needs only one CCD camera attached on the sensor handle. The new hand-held system ALIS is a very compact and do not require any additional sensor for sensor position tracking. The acquired signal from the metal detector and GPR is displayed on the PC display on real time, and the sensor trace can be checked by the operator. At the same time, the operator can visually recognize the signal on the same display. The CCD captured image is superimposed with the GPR and metal detector signal, therefore the detection and identification of buried targets is quite easy and reliable. Field evaluation test of ALIS was conducted in Afghanistan, and we demonstrated that it can detect buried antipersonnel landmines, and can also discriminate metal fragments from landmines...|$|E
40|$|Environmental {{engineering}} is a core component of most construction and surveying undergraduate courses. It is generally accepted that students on these courses {{should have an}} understanding of thermal comfort, heat transfer, condensation, lighting, noise transmission and acoustics. Experiments are essential in developing students ’ awareness and understanding of the underlying physical concepts which drive environmental engineering solutions. Traditionally these experiments have been conducted by students working in small groups in laboratories. However, increasing student numbers and, in particular, the growth in part time study, have placed significant additional demands on limited laboratory resources. The availability of reasonably priced, simple, <b>hand-held</b> <b>equipment</b> has made it possible for students to conduct experiments outside the confines of the laboratory.

40|$|The {{importance}} of the centre of percussion (CP) of some <b>hand-held</b> sporting <b>equipment</b> (such as tennis rackets and baseball bats) for athletic performance is well known. In order to avoid injuries {{it is important that}} powerful blows are located close to the CP. Several species of glyptodont (giant armoured mammals) had tail clubs that can be modelled as rigid beams (like baseball bats) and it is generally assumed that these were useful for agonistic behaviour. However, the variation in tail club morphology among known genera suggests that a biomechanical and functional analysis of these structures could be useful. Here, we outline a novel method to determine the CP of the glyptodont tail clubs. We find that the largest species had the CP very close to the possible location of horny spikes. This is consistent with the inference that they were adapted to delivering powerful blows at that point. Our new analysis reinforces the case for agonistic use of tail clubs in several glyptodont species...|$|R
40|$|This report {{discusses}} {{the existing literature}} concerning the effect of telephoning while driving on road safety. Telephone use in the car has increased dramatically in the Netherlands in recent years. The telecom industry expects {{that by the end}} of the year 2000, four million cellular telephones will be in use in the Netherlands; the percentage of hands-free installations is not known. Various studies show that telephoning whilst driving interferes with driving tasks and therefore has a negative effect on the performance of driving tasks. This concerns both hand-held and hands-free telephones, although <b>hand-held</b> <b>equipment</b> appears to have a greater negative effect on driving tasks than hands-free. On the basis of data now available, the SWOV Institute for Road Safety Research concludes that using a mobile phone while driving a car is undesirable. This applies to all forms of telephone use and vehicle operation. Prohibiting the use of hand-held telephones while driving will benefit road safety. Upholding a legal ban on hand-held telephoning would be reasonably feasible; doing so for hands-free telephoning would be almost impossible. (A...|$|E

Of the 3486 children screened {{as a part of}} the study, 77 % passed an OAE screening at the first step, 18 % more passed an OAE screening at the second step, and 5 % were ultimately referred for medical or audiological follow-up. Eighty children were identified as having a hearing loss or disorder of the outer, middle or inner ear requiring treatment. Of these 80, six had permanent bilateral or unilateral hearing loss. Although the protocol suggested that the multi-step screening procedure should be completed within a 4 -week time period or less, analysis of the data showed that for children requiring more than an initial OAE screening, the length of time over which the screening was completed ranged from 7 to 12 weeks. The median time required to complete a single OAE screening session was 4 minutes per child. The results demonstrate that OAE screening of young children using this protocol is practical and effective. The implications for conducting periodic hearing screening throughout early childhood are discussed. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
50|$|The {{choice of}} supply voltage is due more to {{historical}} reasons than optimization {{of the distribution}} system - once a voltage is in use and equipment using this voltage is widespread, changing voltage is a drastic and expensive measure. A 230 V distribution system will use less conductor material than a 120 V system to deliver a given amount of power because the current, and consequently the resistive loss, is lower. While large heating appliances can use smaller conductors at 230 V for the same output rating, few household appliances use anything like the full capacity of the outlet {{to which they are}} connected. Minimum wire size for <b>hand-held</b> or portable <b>equipment</b> is usually restricted by the mechanical strength of the conductors.
