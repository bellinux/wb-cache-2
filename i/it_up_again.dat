Though the Red Lion and Sun has now fallen into disuse, Iran {{has in the}} past reserved the right to take <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>again</b> at any time; the Geneva Conventions continue to recognize it as an official emblem, and that status was confirmed by Protocol III in 2005 even as it added the Red Crystal.|$|E

25|$|Clapton {{received}} an acoustic Hoyer guitar, made in Germany, for his thirteenth birthday, but the inexpensive steel-stringed instrument {{was difficult to}} play and he briefly lost interest. Two years later Clapton picked <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>again</b> and started playing consistently. Clapton {{was influenced by the}} blues from an early age, and practised long hours to learn the chords of blues music by playing along to the records. He preserved his practice sessions using his portable Grundig reel-to-reel tape recorder, listening to them over and over until he felt he'd got it right.|$|E
25|$|Due to the emblem's {{association}} with the Iranian monarchy, the Islamic Republic of Iran replaced the Red Lion and Sun with the Red Crescent in 1980, consistent with two existing Red Cross and Red Crescent symbols.

25|$|This hiatus, however, did {{not last}} as long as Wagner had anticipated. On 13 July 1857 he took up the work again and {{finished}} Act II within four weeks, the preliminary draft being completed on 30 July and the developed draft on 9 August. The full score of the first act was now complete (in pencil), and a fair copy had been made (in ink) of the opening scene; the developed draft of the second act was finished, but the full score had not yet been begun. At this point Wagner once again put the opera aside to concentrate on Tristan und Isolde. Seven years would pass before he took <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>again,</b> during which time he completed Tristan and started Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, the International Football Association Board made {{changes in}} {{the laws of the}} game that {{affected}} goalkeepers – notably the back-pass rule, which prohibits goalkeepers from handling the ball when receiving a deliberate pass from a teammate that is made with their feet. This rule change was made to discourage time-wasting and overly defensive play after the 1990 FIFA World Cup which was described as exceedingly dull, rife with back-passing and goalkeepers holding the ball. Also, goalkeepers would frequently drop the ball and dribble it around, only to pick <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>again</b> once opponents came closer to put them under pressure, a typical time-wasting technique. Therefore, another rule was introduced {{at the same time as}} the back-pass rule. This rule prohibits the goalkeeper from handling the ball again once he or she has released it for play; an offence results in an indirect free kick to the opposition. Furthermore any player negating the spirit of the new rule would be likely to be cautioned for unsporting behaviour and punished by an indirect free-kick.|$|E

However, she missed the sport and took <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>again</b> in 2005. Tan said, [...] "For me, riding a horse gives me the freedom, movement and energy that my own legs cannot do." ...|$|E

500|$|Next {{came the}} action {{sequences}} {{and the battle}} for the Enterprise, a phase the filmmakers dubbed [...] "Borg Hell". Frakes directed the Borg scenes similar to a horror film, creating as much suspense as possible. To balance these elements he added more comedic elements to the Earth scenes, intended to momentarily relieve the audience of tension before building <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>again.</b> Leonetti reconfigured the lighting to reflect the takeover of the ship interiors. [...] "When the ship gets Borgified, everything is changed into more of a squared-off, robotic look with sharp edges but rounded images," [...] he explained. To give the corridor walls more shape, Leonetti lit them from underneath. Since the halls were so small and the ceilings would be visible in many of the shots, special attention was paid to hiding the light fixtures.|$|E
500|$|In 2012, Madonna {{performed}} the song on The MDNA Tour {{as part of}} the third segment of the show. She {{performed the}} song while her dancers moved mirrors around her, as she removed articles of clothing. At her concert in Istanbul on June 7, 2012, Madonna briefly exposed her right breast to the audience, before covering <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>again.</b> This prompted criticism about her age, with Sophie Wilkinson from Heat World asking, [...] "at 54, is she too old to be getting a boob out?" [...] The striptease {{towards the end of the}} song continued in other cities where the tour visited, and most of the times the singer had messages written across her back talking about social issues. Amy Odell from The Huffington Post said that criticizing the gesture based on her age sends [...] "a very archaic message", adding that [...] "Women who are 53 still have breasts and... sex drives!". The performance of the song at the November 19–20, 2012, shows in Miami, at the American Airlines Arena were recorded and released in Madonna's fourth live album, MDNA World Tour. In April 2015, Madonna performed [...] "Human Nature" [...] along with her 2005 song [...] "Hung Up" [...] as a medley at the Coachella Festival during Drake's act, sporting thigh-high boots and a tank top that read [...] "Big as Madonna". She then went on to kiss Drake; the kiss went viral on the Internet due to Drake's reaction to it.|$|E
500|$|Further {{attempts}} by several Filipino politicians such as Ferdinand Marcos to [...] "destabilise" [...] Sabah {{proved to be}} futile {{and led to the}} Jabidah massacre in Corregidor Island, Philippines. As a consequence, this led the Malaysian government to once supporting the insurgency in southern Philippines. Although the Philippine claim to Sabah has not been actively pursued for some years, some Filipino politicians are promising to bring <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>again,</b> [...] while the Malaysian government asks the Philippines not to threaten ties over such issue. The Royal Malaysia Police and the Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister made a proposal to ban barter trade between Malaysia and the Philippines as it was seen only benefited to one side and threatening the security of the state. This was enforced then although facing numerous opposition from Filipino resident on the nearest Philippine islands due to the raise of the living cost in their region after the ban as well from the Malaysian opposition parties, while receiving positive welcomes by Sabahans residents and politicians. [...] The barter trade activity was resumed on 1 February 2017 with the increase of security surveillance and enforcement from both Malaysia and the Philippines authorities to jointly secure their borders. Despite the return of barter trade activity, the state of Sabah has maintained they will always be cautious on their trade with the Philippines. In 2016, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte and Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak have agreed to set aside the two countries’ dispute over Sabah for the meantime.|$|E

500|$|The county border {{leaves the}} river {{on the west}} side of Market Harborough, as the town is wholly in Leicestershire, and picks <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>again</b> on the east side. The River Jordan joins the Welland in the centre of Market Harborough, flowing northwards to the railway station. Langton Brook and Stonton Brook join from the west near Welham. The county border meanders from side to side across {{relatively}} straight sections of the river, suggesting that the channel has been engineered. A three-arched bridge, built in 1881 of fine ashlar masonry, with a causeway to the south, carries the Welham to Weston by Welland road over the river, while a four-arched bridge dating from the early nineteenth century carries the Ashley to Medbourne road. Macmillan Way, a long distance footpath, crosses on its way from Abbotsbury in Dorset to Boston, Lincolnshire. Medbourne Brook joins from the north, after which the river approaches a dismantled railway and is joined by the Stoke Albany Brook, approaching from the south. The river remains on the south side of the railway, while the county border follows a meandering course to the north of it, but rejoins the river near the Bringhurst to Cottingham road. The bridge over the river is plain, but to the north of it is an eighteenth-century causeway, some [...] long, which is made of stone and pierced by seven large arches and numerous smaller arches for drainage pipes. The causeway has two large semi-circular passing places on its western side.|$|E
500|$|To create {{tracks on}} Let the Blind Lead, Cox {{continually}} adds elements to a song until he [...] "feel like it's getting crowded…When it sounds done, it's done.

[...] To Pitchfork Media Cox said that, with each song, [...] "The genesis is usually a beat." [...] Cox considers the music of Let the Blind Lead to have a [...] "dynamic arc": {{the first half of the}} record contains [...] "more accessible songs. I was very depressed in the middle, and it created this kind of black hole of misery. Then I tried to bring <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>again</b> at the end." [...] Cox intended for his music to be [...] "therapeutic", for both himself and his audience. [...] In addition, he wanted the album to have a healing element, and be something [...] "somebody could listen to all the way through and feel like they went through a bad period of time and came out of it." [...] Pauline Oliveros, a composer who runs an organization that studies music therapy, was described by Cox as having [...] "a big influence" [...] on him and his ideas of therapeutic music. [...] He considers music [...] "the only art form I know of that has such an immediate effect on the human psyche", and found the time he first met and talked with Oliveros as being [...] "like meeting a hero of mine." ...|$|E
