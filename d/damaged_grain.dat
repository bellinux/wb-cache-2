5000|$|This {{article focuses}} on the <b>damage</b> {{incurred}} to <b>grain</b> between the field and its end use. Therefore, the first cause of <b>grain</b> <b>damage</b> is harvesting itself. A large cause of <b>grain</b> <b>damage</b> is mechanical damage incurred during the threshing process in a combine. This process of stripping the grain from the plant can often cause cracks and other damage. Many researches have attempted to find methods to minimize <b>grain</b> <b>damage</b> without inhibiting harvest productivity. Many harvest factors can effect the amount of <b>damage</b> that <b>grain</b> will incur during harvest. Some of these are uncontrollable by the operator such as moisture content. However, many of {{the parameters of the}} combine can be varied in an attempt to reduce <b>grain</b> <b>damage</b> and obtain better yields. Some of these parameters include rotor speed, ground speed, concave settings, sieve settings, and fan speeds. Research indicates that the rotor speed has the largest effect on <b>grain</b> <b>damage,</b> with damage increasing exponentially with rotor speed. [...] In addition, <b>grain</b> <b>damage</b> can actually increase as the forward speed, or ground speed, of the machine is decreased. [...] Similar ground speed trends were found in wheat. [...] The settings of the concave can also increase <b>grain</b> <b>damage</b> if the gap of the concave is too narrow or as the length of the concave increases.|$|R

50|$|Grain {{damage is}} a broad term {{that is used to}} {{describe}} any degradation in the quality of grain. In the current grain trade, this damage can affect price, feed quality, food product quality, and susceptibility to pest contamination. Between the field and the end use, grain may go through any number of handling operations which can each contribute to grain damage. For example, grain might encounter free fall, conveyors, spouts, grain throwers, elevators, hoppers, dryers, and many more. Overall, these handling methods can be evaluated as to what effect they have on the grain. <b>Damaged</b> <b>grain</b> can often be characterized by {{the extent to which it}} reduces storage time. For example, cracked or broken kernels are more susceptible to insect or bacteria as well as chemical degradation. The damage to the actual grain is only one example of losses incurred after harvest. In order to quantify grain damage, one must also understand grain quality. Grain quality is a very broad term and can relate to many topics such as foreign material, chemical compositions, mechanical damage, insect infestations, and many more. These references to quality are highly dependent on the end use of the grain. Certain types of damage may be acceptable to specific industries, whereas others cannot use grain with these issues.|$|E
50|$|Between 1873 and 1879 British {{agriculture}} {{suffered from}} wet summers that <b>damaged</b> <b>grain</b> crops.

The poor harvests, however, masked a greater threat to British agriculture: growing imports of foodstuffs from abroad. The development of the steam ship {{and the development of}} extensive railway networks in Britain and the USA allowed US farmers with much larger and more productive farms to export hard grain to Britain at a price that undercut the British farmers. At the same time, large amounts of cheap corned beef started to arrive from Argentina, and the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 and the development of refrigerator ships (reefers) in about 1880 opened the British market to cheap meat and wool from Australia, New Zealand, and Argentina. The Long Depression was a worldwide economic recession that began in 1873 and ended around 1896. It hit the agricultural sector hard and was the most severe in Europe and the United States, which had been experiencing strong economic growth fuelled by the Second Industrial Revolution in the decade following the American Civil War. By 1900 half the meat eaten in Britain came from abroad and tropical fruits such as bananas were also being imported on the new refrigerator ships.|$|E

50|$|Two {{different}} types of beetles are classified as flour beetles: {{the red flour beetle}} and the confused flour beetle. Both are similar in physical characteristics. They are flat and oval in shape and usually range around 1/8 inch long. Their exoskeletons are reddish brown with a shiny and smooth texture. The eggs, larvae, and pupae resemble each other closely in physical features, as well. The eggs usually tend to be a white color, or at times even colorless. They are very small in size and have a sticky outer covering that causes certain food particles to stick to them. The larvae have six legs, with two pointy projections toward the caudal end. Finally, the pupal stage (a cocoon-like form) is usually a white or brownish color. The beetle life cycle lasts about three years or more, with the larval stage ranging anywhere from 20 to over 100 days, and the pupal stage around eight days. Beetles usually breed in <b>damaged</b> <b>grain,</b> grain dust, high-moisture wheat kernels and flour. The female flour beetle can lay between 300 and 400 eggs during her lifetime period of 5 to 8 months. The flour beetles mainly infest grains, including, but not limited to: cereal, corn meal oats, rice, flour, and crackers. This type of beetle is the most abundant insect pest of flour mills across the United States. Their small size allows them to maneuver through cracks and crevices and get into the home and other areas. Once they are present in areas with potential food sources, they can infest material such as flour, resulting in a sharp odor or moldy flavor. The red flour beetle is able to fly short distances and the confused flour beetle is unable to fly. While the confused flour beetle is more commonly found in the northern United States, the red flour beetles are more predominant in the southern United States in areas with warmer climates.The red flour beetle and the confused flour beetle are commonly used as a model organisms, to study genetics and ecology. The genome of the red flour beetle has been sequenced.|$|E
