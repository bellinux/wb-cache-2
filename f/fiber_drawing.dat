40|$|In this work, the structure, {{mechanical}} and thermal properties of PET fiber obtained by hot multi-stage drawing {{have been investigated}} {{in terms of their}} dependence on the number of drawing steps at an equivalent total draw ratio. Differential scanning calorimetry, birefringence, wide-angle x-ray diffraction, FTIR spectroscopy, tensile properties, and taut-tie molecules were used to characterize the fine structure and physical properties of the fibers. Results have been explained in terms of a higher drawing residence time at an equivalent drawing speed. For single stage <b>drawn</b> <b>fiber,</b> a high tensile strength is obtained, whereas a high initial modulus is obtained for <b>fiber</b> <b>drawn</b> at three-stage drawing.

What differs are the physical {{properties of the}} polymer melt, compared to a polymer solution. When comparing polymer melts and polymer solutions, the former are normally more viscous than polymer solutions, and elongated electrified jets have been reported.

50|$|Typically, <b>fiber</b> <b>drawing</b> occurs {{immediately}} after spinning. Application of an external force, either from gravity or take up rollers, causes the fibers to contract laterally and lengthen. This orients the individual polymer molecules {{along the length}} of the fiber, increasing strength. The radius of the fibers have been shown to decrease hyperbolically as they lengthen. Once the fibers solidify, they may begin to crystallize, with each grain initially randomly oriented. Further drawing will cause the crystal grains to elongate and reorient in the direction of the tensile axis, further strengthening the fibers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. An {{efficient}} second-order stable numerical {{method is}} presented to solve the model partial differential equations of thermal glass fiber processing. The physical process {{and structure of the}} model equations are described first. The numerical issues are then clarified. The heart of our method is a MacCormack scheme with flux limiting. The numerical method is validated on a linearized isothermal model and by comparison with known exact stationary solutions. The numerical method is then generalized to solve the equations of motion of thermal glass <b>fiber</b> <b>drawing,</b> exhibiting order of convergence. Further, the nonlinear PDE scheme is benchmarked against an independent linearized stability analysis of boundary value solutions near the onset of instability, which demonstrates the efficiency of the method.

40|$|Draw {{resonance}} {{is caused}} by a constant speed winder that leads to non-constant axial forces (Schultz, 1984). The well studied isothermal Newtonian <b>fiber</b> <b>drawing</b> predicts very modest critical draw ratios (around 20, much less than the typical production draw ratios for glass fibers of 10 3 – 10 5). The nonisothermal <b>fiber</b> <b>drawing</b> model presented here shows that cooling along the spin line strongly stabilizes the process. However, we show that the conclusion of Shah and Pearson (1972 a,b) that non-isothermal Newtonian fiber spinning is unconditionally stable is based on non-converged numerical results. The choice of viscosity-temperature correlation function has a strong influence in determining the stability of the process. While viscoelasticity generally has an adverse effect on the stability, low viscoelasticity in the presence of extensional thinning helps to slightly improve the maximum critical draw ratio...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to better understand the fundamental principal of the thermal <b>fiber</b> <b>drawing</b> process with metal-core preforms. This would enable us to overcome the fundamental limits of current thermal drawing techniques by tuning material properties of core metals and interactions between core and cladding materials using nanoparticles. Metal micro/nanowires with controlled size, aspect ratio and spatial configurations of core and cladding materials exhibit extraordinary mechanical, thermal, electrical and optical properties. These metal micro/nanowires can be utilized for widespread applications such as: thermoelectric, conductive electrode and plasmonic photonic crystal fibers. Thermal <b>fiber</b> <b>drawing</b> method has emerged as an advanced scalable manufacturing technique for micro/nanowires production due to its unique characteristics that allow mass production of continuous and arbitrary designed wires. It is of tremendous scientific and technical interests to conduct a fundamental study on thermal <b>fiber</b> <b>drawing</b> methods and to break the current limits of the crystalline metal core thermal <b>fiber</b> <b>drawing</b> process. In this study, metal core was fabricated by cold compaction of the Zinc (Zn) –Tungsten Carbide (WC) nanopowders. Our characterizations through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) showed that WC nanoparticle are uniformly dispersed in Zn matrix. The effects of WC nanoparticles on the mechanical properties and degradation rate in Zn–WC nanocomposites were carefully analyzed by tensile, compressive, hardness, degradation and viscosity tests. Metallic stents are commonly used to expand blood vessels that have been narrowed by plaque buildup (atherosclerosis). Fabrication difficulty and other constrains of metallic stents result in high cost. Zn–WC nanocomposite microwires were controllably drawn for stent struts with a diameter of 200 μm. Characterizations by the tensile and degradation tests of Zn–WC nanocomposite microwires validate the eligibility for stent fabrication. Single cell Zn–WC nanocomposite stents were fabricated by braiding thermally drawn Zn–WC nanocomposite microwires on a weaving stage built by 3 D printing. Zn–WC nanocomposite stents with an inner diameter of 2 mm was expanded up to 10 mm without recoil by a catheter, which is thin tube inserted into human body serving in a broad range of functions. For the purpose of in vivo test, Zn–WC nanocomposite stents were deployed in a pig by percutaneous coronary intervention method (angioplasty with stent). The surgery under fluoroscopy that continuous X–ray beam is passed through the body part being examined. X–ray opaque Zn–WC nanocomposite stents were distinctly shown to be expanded by a catheter and remained without bounce back through the whole procedure. The Zn–WC nanocomposite stents were extracted from the pig a month later and studied for the degradability by SEM and EDS mapping analysis. SEM images of Zn-WC stents showed that the degradation of the stents was uniformly proceeded on the surface without fractures. While the Zn–WC nanocomposite stents stayed inside the vessel, good endothelializations between the Zn–WC stents and surrounding cell tissues as well as no acute pathological problems were discovered from this study. One of the current challenges of thermal <b>fiber</b> <b>drawing</b> process for crystalline metal nanowires is low aspect ratio (1, 500, 000) of Zn–WC nanocomposite nanowires that are 200 nm in diameter and up to 31 cm length were achieved. Herein, we present that WC nanoparticles decreased interfacial energy between metal and glass due to its inherent characteristic such as partly metallic bonding. As a result, the nanoparticle can play the role of anchors to prevent breakage by capillary instability in nanoscale thermal <b>fiber</b> <b>drawing</b> process. Zn–WC nanocomposite nanowires surrounded by borosilicate glass were shown through the TEM (transmission electron microscope) diffraction patterns. By the electrical resistance test, not onlythe electrical resistance and but also the continuity of the Zn–WC nanocomposite nanowires was presented. In summary, a high volume fraction of Zn–WC nanocomposite materials by cold compact method were fabricated to overcome capillary instability in nanoscale thermal <b>fiber</b> <b>drawing</b> process. WC nanoparticles enhanced viscosity of the liquid state Zn–WC nanocomposite materials and played as the anchors to prevent wire breakage due to fluid instability. Finally, Zn–WC nanocomposite stent was shown to be promising material for application biomedical field such as stent. The in vivo test further confirmed that the Zn-WC stent was biocompatible...|$|E
