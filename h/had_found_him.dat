5|$|At first, Prester John was {{imagined}} {{to reside}} in India; tales of the Nestorian Christians' evangelistic success there and of Thomas the Apostle's subcontinental travels as documented in works like the Acts of Thomas probably provided the first seeds of the legend. After {{the coming of the}} Mongols to the Western world, accounts placed the king in Central Asia, and eventually Portuguese explorers convinced themselves that they <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> in Ethiopia.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Emma, Henry and Mary Margaret {{stop by the}} {{hospital}} to see him, {{only to discover that}} the patient has left on his own and might be bleeding. Regina and Sheriff Graham (Jamie Dornan) have also shown up, since Regina is the emergency contact for John Doe. She claims that she <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> {{on the side of the}} road unconscious without any memory of what or who he was. As Regina takes Henry home, Emma, Mary Margaret, and the sheriff decide to investigate what happened and visit the security room. They encounter the janitor Leroy (Lee Arenberg), and the security guard Walter, who was sleeping on the job (since he is actually Sleepy). Emma and the others discover that John Doe went out into the woods.|$|E
25|$|Bolte was {{a proponent}} of using capital {{punishment}} as a deterrent against violent crime. Many believed he was foiled when Robert Peter Tait who had murdered Ada Hall, an elderly widow, at the Hawthorn vicarage where she lived with her son and who had been sentenced to hang for the crime, was granted an eleventh-hour reprieve in 1962 after the High Court <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> insane.|$|E

25|$|When Republic President Burnet unknowingly escaped {{death at}} New Washington, Almonte <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> by {{following}} courier Mike McCormick, whose widowed mother Peggy was {{the owner of}} the land on which the battle was subsequently fought. Although she sought financial restitution from the Republic of Texas for loss of livestock and other goods during the battle, McCormick died without recompense. Decades after her death, the state of Texas purchased part of her acreage for a commemoration site.|$|E
25|$|Another popular running gag {{concerned}} the social habits of Benny's on-air orchestra, who were consistently {{portrayed as a}} bunch of drunken ne'er-do-wells. Led first by Phil Harris and later by Bob Crosby, the orchestra, and in particular band member Frank Remley, were jokingly portrayed as often being too drunk to play properly, using an overturned bass drum to play cards on just minutes before a show, and so enamored of liquor that {{the sight of a}} glass of milk would make them sick. Remley was portrayed in various unflattering situations, such as being thrown into a garbage can by a road sweeper who <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> passed out in the street at 4am, and on a wanted poster at the Beverly Hills police station.|$|E
25|$|In 1994 Abbas {{was given}} {{sanctuary}} in Iraq by Saddam Hussein. Abbas (born in a Syrian refugee camp) made {{his new home}} in Gaza (after being given amnesty in 1996 {{in line with the}} 1993 signing of the Oslo peace accords). He became a representative of the Palestine National Council. The administration of President Bill Clinton aware of Abbas' resurfacing neither asked for his extradition nor requested he be turned over to Italy who <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> guilty in absentia. The U.S. Senate passed a resolution 99-0 asking Clinton to request Abbas' extradition to the USA. The Congressional Research Service held that the statute of limitations and not expired because Abbas was a fugitive from justice. Clinton's critics also pointed out that the US was not a signatory to the Oslo accords, and that they make no mention of the USA's ability to prosecute anyone. Throughout the 1990s Abbas moved back and forth from Baghdad to the West Bank, secretly recruiting more Palestinians to join the PLF, while he told the news media that he was reformed and that the Achille Lauro hijacking had been an accident.|$|E

500|$|Hinckley {{was found}} {{not guilty by reason of}} {{insanity}} on June 21, 1982. The defense psychiatric reports <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> to be insane while the prosecution reports declared him legally sane. Following his lawyers' advice, he declined to take the stand in his own defense. Hinckley was confined at St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, D.C. full-time until 2006, at which point he began a program of spending gradually more time at his mother's home. On September 10, 2016, Hinckley was permitted to permanently leave the hospital to live with his mother full-time, under court supervision and with mandatory psychiatric treatment. After his trial, he wrote that the shooting was [...] "the greatest love offering in the history of the world", and did not then indicate regrets.|$|E
500|$|Although still officially {{a member}} of the Beatles, Lennon had privately {{announced}} his departure from the group in September 1969. He was now keen to issue [...] "Instant Karma!" [...] immediately as a single, the third under his and Ono's Plastic Ono Band moniker. The recording session took place at Abbey Road Studios in north-west London, on the evening of 27 January. Lennon's fellow musicians at the session were Harrison, Klaus Voormann, Alan White and Billy Preston â€“ all of whom had performed at the December 1969 Peace for Christmas Concert, as part of the Plastic Ono Supergroup. The recording engineer for [...] "Instant Karma!" [...] was EMI mainstay Phil McDonald. Spector produced the session, arriving late after Harrison <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> at Apple's office and persuaded him to attend.|$|E
500|$|The polar {{historian}} Roland Huntford sums up Joyce as a [...] "strange {{mixture of}} fraud, flamboyance and ability". This mixed assessment is endorsed in the assortment of views expressed by {{those associated with}} him. Dick Richards of the Ross Sea party described him as [...] "a kindly soul and a good pal", and others shared the favourable opinions expressed by Scott and Markham, confirming Joyce as a [...] "jolly good sort", though unsuited for command. On the other hand, [...] Eric Marshall [...] of the Nimrod Expedition <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> [...] "of limited intelligence, resentful and incompatible", while John King Davis, when refusing to join the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, told Shackleton: [...] "I absolutely decline {{to be associated with}} any enterprise with which people of the Joyce type are connected".|$|E

500|$|Bellingham's main {{witnesses}} were Ann Billett and her friend, Mary Clarke, {{both of whom}} testified to his history of [...] derangement, and Catherine Figgins, a servant in Bellingham's lodgings. She <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> recently confused, but otherwise an honest and admirable lodger. As she stood down, Alley informed the court that two more witnesses had arrived from Liverpool. However, when they saw Bellingham, they realised {{that he was not}} the man to whose derangement they had come to attest, and withdrew. Mansfield then began his summing up, during the course of which he clarified the law: [...] "The single question is whether at the time this act was committed, he possessed a sufficient degree of understanding to distinguish good from evil, right from wrong". The judge advised the jury before they retired that the evidence showed Bellingham to be [...] "in every respect a full and competent judge of all his actions".|$|E
500|$|Promoted acting air vice-marshal in September 1941, Anderson {{resumed his}} {{position}} on the Air Board by replacing Air Marshal Williams as Air Member for Organisation and Equipment. In May 1942, he assumed command of the newly established Eastern Area, which was headquartered in Sydney and controlled seven squadrons from southern Queensland to southern New South Wales. One of the area's main roles was anti-submarine warfare; its squadrons also included fighters and army co-operation aircraft. In July 1943 Anderson became the inaugural Commandant of the RAAF Staff School at Mount Martha, Victoria. The school was instituted to further the training of officers at the squadron leader and wing commander level, whose basic education standards Anderson, among others, found sadly lacking. In December 1943 he was again appointed Air Member for Personnel, taking over from Air Commodore Frank Lukis, before returning to command the RAAF Staff School in September 1944. He continued in the latter role until being forcibly retired, along with a number of other senior Air Force commanders, in April 1946, ostensibly to make way for younger and equally qualified officers. A confidential report in September 1944 <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> [...] "hard working, conscientious and loyal" [...] but lacking in [...] "constructive capacity and organising ability". He was still four years below the statutory retirement age of fifty-seven for his substantive rank of air commodore.|$|E
500|$|On February 27, 1943, Robinson was {{inducted}} into the United States Army, where he was again referred to as Walker Smith. Robinson had a 15-month military career. Robinson served with Joe Louis, and the pair went on tours where they performed exhibition bouts in front of US troops. Robinson got into trouble several times while in the military. He argued with superiors who he felt were discriminatory against him, and refused to fight exhibitions when he was told African American soldiers were not allowed to watch them. [...] In late March 1944, Robinson was stationed at Fort Hamilton in Brooklyn, waiting to ship out to Europe, where he was scheduled to perform more exhibition matches. But on March 29, Robinson disappeared from his barracks. When he woke up on April 5 in Fort Jay Hospital on Governor's Island, he had missed his sailing for Europe and was under suspicion of deserting. He himself reported falling down the stairs in his barracks on the 29th, but said that he had complete amnesia, and he could not remember any events from that moment until the 5th. According to his file, a stranger <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> in the street on 1 [...] April and helped him to a hospital. In his examination report, a doctor at Fort Jay concluded that Robinson's version of events was sincere. [...] He was examined by military authorities, who claimed he suffered from a mental deficiency. Robinson was granted an honorable discharge on June 3, 1944. He later wrote that unfair press coverage of the incident had [...] "branded" [...] him as a [...] "deserter". Robinson maintained his close friendship with Louis from their time in military service, and the two went into business together after the war. They planned to start a liquor distribution business in New York City, but were denied a license due to their race.|$|E

Guede {{allegedly}} committed break-ins, including one of a lawyer's office through a second floor window, and another during which he burgled a flat and brandished a jackknife when confronted. On 27October 2007, days before Kercher's murder, Guede was arrested in Milan after breaking into a nursery school; he was reportedly found by police with an 11-inch knife [...] that had been taken from the school kitchen.|$|E

2500|$|Nevertheless, McLagan, Jones and Marriott {{decided to}} stay {{together}} as Small Faces, recruiting ex-Roxy Music bassist Rick Wills to take Lane's place. This iteration of Small Faces recorded two albums: [...] Playmates (1977) and 78 In The Shade (1978), released on Atlantic Records. Guitarist Jimmy McCulloch also briefly joined this line-up after leaving Wings. When McCulloch phoned Paul McCartney, who <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> increasingly difficult to work with, to announce he was joining Marriott, McCartney reportedly said [...] "I was a little put out at first, but, well, {{what can you say}} to that?" [...] McCulloch's tenure with the band lasted only for a few months in late 1977. He recorded only one album, 78 in the Shade in 1978 with the band.|$|E
2500|$|He drowned on 5 March 1842 {{in a cell}} of {{the city}} prison by water from an open faucet. A {{policeman}} <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> in a destitute and apparently demented condition {{on the street and}} taken him to a jail for safety; but this triggered a mental collapse which saw him removed to an asylum. The immediate catalyst for the mental chain of incidents [...] which brought about his death was the culmination of a cruel prank played on him by a group of youths, who elaborately convinced him that a certain woman for whom he longed was in love with him, before letting him down in the most abrupt fashion. McDonald Clarke is interred at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York.|$|E

Mr Tan played a pivotal role in shaping the legal landscape of Singapore and upholding the rule of law which has underpinned much of Singapore's success."
