40|$|OX 40 L is {{expressed}} by many cell types, including antigen presenting cells (APCs), T cells, vascular endothelial cells, mast cells (MCs), and natural killer cells. The importance <b>of</b> <b>OX</b> 40 L:OX 40 interactions and the OX 40 L signaling {{is crucial for}} the homeostasis and for the modulation of the effector functions of the immune system. However, the lack of non-murine/non-IgG commercially available OX 40 L-triggering antibodies and the potential signal cross-contamination caused by the binding to the FcγRs co-expressed by several immune cells have limited the study <b>of</b> the <b>OX</b> 40 L-signaling cascade. We recently characterized the functions and described the molecular events, which follow the engagement <b>of</b> <b>OX</b> 40 L in MCs, by the use <b>of</b> the soluble <b>OX</b> 40 molecule, able to mimic the regulatory T cell-driven engagement of MC-OX 40 L.

The water buffalo also is ridden, though in a more bareback style. Sometimes the animals are raced for sport, or otherwise used for entertainment. The use <b>of</b> <b>ox</b> dung has had an important role both as a fertilizer and as fuel. Horns, bones, and hides <b>of</b> <b>oxen</b> have been employed for many purposes.

40|$|The {{rotational}} reorientation dynamics <b>of</b> oxazine 750 (<b>OX</b> 750) in {{the first}} (with pump pulse at 660 nm) and a higher excited state (with pump pulse at 400 nm) in different polar solvents have been investigated using femtosecond time-resolved stimulated emission pumping fluorescence depletion (FS TR SEP FD) spectroscopy. In both excited states, three different anisotropy decay laws have been observed for OX 750 in different solvents. Only in acetone and formamide could the anisotropy decays <b>of</b> <b>OX</b> 750 be described by single-exponential functions, whereas the anisotropy decays {{have been found to}} exhibit biexponential behavior in other solvents. The slower anisotropy decay observed in all of the solvents has been assigned to the overall rotational relaxation <b>of</b> <b>OX</b> 750 molecules, and a quantitative analysis of this time constant has been performed using the Stokes-Einstein-Debye hydrodynamic theory and the extended charge distribution model developed by Alavi and Waldeck. In both methanol and ethanol, a faster anisotropy decay on the order of picoseconds and a slower anisotropy decay on the hundreds of picoseconds time scale are observed. The most likely explanation for the faster anisotropy involves the rotation of the transition dipole moment in the excited state <b>of</b> <b>OX</b> 750 resulting from the electron transfer (ET) reaction taking place from the alcoholic solvents to the OX 750 chromophore. As a possible explanation, the wobbling-in-the-cone model has been used to analyze the biexponential anisotropy decays <b>of</b> <b>OX</b> 750 in dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The observed faster anisotropy decays on the hundreds of fermoseconds time scale in DMF and DMSO are ascribed to the wobbling-in-the-cone motion of the ethyl group <b>of</b> <b>OX</b> 750, which is sensitive to the strength of the hydrogen bond formed between the solvent and the protonation site <b>of</b> <b>OX</b> 750...|$|R

On the other hand, it has an adverse effect on the adoption probability of non-farming activities, similarly, the number <b>of</b> <b>oxen</b> resulted in {{a negative impact on}} joint adoption decision. That is, as the number <b>of</b> <b>oxen</b> the farmer owned increase by one, the probability of the joint adoption decision will be declined by 18 % units. This may be because farmers who have more oxen will allocate their resources for intensive farming, rather than engaging in non-farm income generating activities. In the study area, due to the constraints in farming technology availability, oxen have been mainly served as ploughing duties and substituting ploughing tractors.|$|R
40|$|Myasthenia gravis (MG) is {{commonly}} {{regarded as the}} prototype of an antibody-mediated, organ-specific autoimmune disease. Antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) on the muscle endplate trigger its typical clinical manifestations of weakness and fatiguability. T–B cell interactions are thought to {{play a crucial role}} in the pathogenesis <b>of</b> MG. <b>OX</b> 40 (CD 134), a costimulatory molecule that is expressed on activated CD 4 + T-cells, might contribute to the development or pathogenesis of immune-mediated diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and graft-versus-host disease. In the present study, we investigated the expression <b>of</b> <b>OX</b> 40 on CD 4 + T-cells from patients with MG and healthy individuals. Results from 36 MG patients and 28 healthy controls revealed that more freshly isolated CD 4 + T-cells from MG patients expressed OX 40 than cells from healthy individuals. High levels of antibodies against the AChR, thymic hyperplasia and onset at an early age were associated with elevated expression <b>of</b> <b>OX</b> 40. Upon activation by various concentrations of anti-CD 3 antibodies, CD 4 + T-cells from MG patients showed a tendency toward higher levels <b>of</b> <b>OX</b> 40 expression than cells from healthy individuals.

40|$|Uveitis is a {{major and}} common cause of visual disability. Recent {{studies have shown that}} Th 17 cells are implicated in the {{pathogenesis}} of this serious intraocular disorder. Activated T cells express an inducible costimulatory molecule called OX 40, and OX 40 in turn promotes the activation and proliferation of these lymphocytes. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether OX 40 plays a vital role in enhancing the effector function of Th 17 cells as well as the severity of uveitis. In this study, we demonstrated an increase <b>of</b> <b>OX</b> 40 transcription in ovalbumin-induced uveitis, whereas anti-OX 40 L antibody substantially inhibited the antigen-specific ocular inflammation. Next, results from flow cytometry showed that activated Th 17 cells expressed OX 40, and OX 40 -activating antibody significantly augmented the production of Th 17 cytokines in vitro. To validate the impact <b>of</b> <b>OX</b> 40 in vivo, we stimulated ovalbumin-specific T cells with the OX 40 -activating antibody. Compared to donor cells without OX 40 activation, adoptive transfer <b>of</b> <b>OX</b> 40 -stimulated lymphocytes elicited more severe ocular inflammation. Furthermore, an interleukin- 17 -neutralizing antibody attenuated OX 40 -mediated uveitis. In conclusion, our findings suggest that activation <b>of</b> <b>OX</b> 40 augments Th 17 cell function and thereby contributes to ocular inflammation. This study thus enhances our knowledge of costimulatory molecule-mediated immunopathological mechanisms of uveitis and suggests a future therapeutic strategy to treat uveitis by the targeting <b>of</b> <b>OX</b> 40...|$|R
