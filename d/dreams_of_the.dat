5|$|David 8 (Michael Fassbender) is Peter Weyland's {{synthetic}} {{assistant and}} {{the creator of}} the Aliens. The eighth in a line of David models representing Weyland's unfulfilled wish for a son, David was created by a middle-age Weyland, named after the eponymous Michelangelo statue. While the Prometheus is en route to LV-223, David studies the Engineers' (presumed) dialects, human culture and the <b>dreams</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crew. After their arrival, David accompanies the expedition to the Juggernaut, where he acquires a vial of a black, extraterrestrial liquid. David contaminates a drink he gives Holloway to impregnate Shaw with an extraterrestrial life form. He explores the Juggernaut and cuts his feed to Vickers, giving Weyland private-screening access as he learns about a last-surviving Engineer in cryosleep. David prepares Weyland for the expedition to awaken the Engineer. He translates Weyland's request for immortality, and the Engineer decapitates him and kills the rest of the expedition except for Shaw. After Janek crashes the Prometheus into the Juggernaut, David's severed head warns Shaw that the Engineer is coming to kill her. He contacts her after she escapes from the life-support unit, telling her {{that he would like to}} help her escape LV-223 by piloting another Engineer ship. After Shaw recovers his head and body, he promises to take her to the Engineers' home world and they leave LV-223. David, whom Shaw has repaired, unleashes the mutagen on the Engineers' home world, wiping them out along with all other non-floral life. David conducts experiments with the mutagen to create the perfect organism, and using Shaw's body for the experiments. When an expedition from the colony ship Covenant arrives ten years later, David saves them from Neomorphs. He leads them to his base situated at the Engineer temple, where he becomes acquainted with his successor android, Walter, and lures Oram to get impregnated by a Facehugger, giving birth to the first Xenomorph. David is confronted by Walter about Shaw's fate, prompting David to disable him. David attacks Daniels, but is interrupted by the recuperated Walter. The two androids fight, with David emerging the victor and discretely assuming Walter's identity. After escaping to the Covenant, David coordinates the defense against the Alien that infiltrated the ship. After Daniels defeats the creature, David helps her and Tennessee into the sleeping pods. With Daniels in the pod, David reveals his true identity and puts her to sleep. David regurgitates two Facehugger embryos that he refrigerates with the human embryos and, impersonating Walter, sends out a transmission proclaiming that Daniels and Tennessee are the only survivors of the expedition.|$|E

However, although the satimata's intentions are always {{for the good of the}} family, she is not averse to let, for example, children become sick, or the cows' udders wither, if she thinks this is an appropriate lesson to the living wife who had neglected her duties as pativrata.|$|E

When he is unconscious, Bilbo <b>dreams</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> possibilities of heroism in such a quest, and upon waking, decides to join the dwarves.|$|E

25|$|The messianic <b>dreams</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gaon of Vilna {{inspired}} one of {{the largest}} pre-Zionist waves of immigration to Eretz Yisrael. In 1808 hundreds of the Gaon's disciples, known as Perushim, settled in Tiberias and Safed, and later formed the core of the Old Yishuv in Jerusalem. This {{was part of a larger}} movement of thousands of Jews from countries as widely spaced as Persia and Morocco, Yemen and Russia, who moved to Israel beginning in the first decade of the nineteenth century—and in even larger numbers after the conquest of the region by Muhammad Ali of Egypt in 1832—all drawn by the expectation of the arrival of the Messiah in the Jewish year 5600, Christian year 1840, a movement documented in Arie Morgenstern's Hastening Redemption.|$|E
25|$|Edmund {{returns home}} to find his father playing solitaire. While the two argue and drink, they also have an intimate, tender conversation. James {{explains}} his stinginess, and also reveals that he ruined his career by staying in an acting job for money. After so many years playing the same part, he lost his talent for versatility. Edmund talks to his father about sailing and of his aspiration to become a great writer one day. They hear Jamie coming home drunk, and James leaves to avoid fighting. Jamie and Edmund converse, and Jamie confesses that although he loves Edmund more than anyone else, he again ambiguously lashes out at his father calling on him to fail. Jamie passes out. When James returns, Jamie wakes up, and they quarrel anew. Mary, lost in her drug-laden <b>dreams</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past, comes downstairs.

25|$|The Prince crawls {{into bed}} and appears to sleep. However, he begins writhing as he <b>dreams</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> troupe of swans {{emerging}} from under and behind, dancing around him. He wakes from his nightmare, checking under his bed and around his room for swans. His tortured expression and jerky movements convey the Prince in turmoil. His lead Swan then slowly emerges from within the Prince's bed. The Swan dances with the Prince and assures him of his continued affection. But, {{the rest of the}} swans turn on the lead Swan when he makes it clear that he values his relationship with the Prince more than he does them. They separate the two and begin attacking the Prince before the Swan leaps in to save him. The Swan embraces the Prince and envelops him in his wings. The swans' fury increases and their next attack dismembers the Swan, who then disappears. Heartbroken and despondent, the Prince wails and collapses onto the bed. The Queen then finds her dead son's body and breaks down in sobs. However, in death the Prince and the Swan are reunited; as shown by a tableau depicting the lead Swan tenderly holding the young Prince in his arms.|$|E

25|$|Following {{a dispute}} between the English clubs and European Cup organisers there was no English {{involvement}} in the 1998-99 Heineken Cup; this led to an expanded Premiership of 14 clubs and 28 games. Tigers started the new season well with a 49-15 win against Harlequins and wins against London Scottish, Northampton and Bedford to see Tigers top {{the table at the}} end of September. Losses against Saracens and London Irish in rounds 5 & 7 saw Tigers slip to 3rd in October; Leicester regained the lead in the table after victories against Richmond and West Hartlepool and were never to lose it despite a loss to Wasps two weeks later. <b>Dreams</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> double were dashed by Richmond in the quarter finals of the cup, Johnson received a white card (at the time signifying 10 minutes in the sin bin) and during his absence the Londoners scored their two tries in a 15-13 win. The next week Johnson was sin binned again, this time in a league match against closest challengers Northampton, but even with Pat Howard also sin binned and Leicester down to 13 men for a period so outstanding was Johnson's play they won 22-15. Mathematically Leicester's third English championship title was sealed in the penultimate match of the season away to Newcastle Falcons. Johnson's form was such that he was named as the Premiership's Player of the Season.|$|E
25|$|Hamamatsu Chūnagon Monogatari is {{the tale}} of a chūnagon who lost his father when he was very young. His mother marries a widower with two daughters and {{he fell in love with}} the older daughter, Taishō no Kimi. The Chūnagon learns in a dream that his father has been reborn as the Third Prince of the Emperor of China, and he sets out on a three-year trip to meet his father. Taishō no Kimi conceives a child with him as he leaves for China and upsets her father's plans for a good match for her, {{becoming}} a Buddhist nun instead. The Chūnagon becomes the darling of the Chinese court, and falls in love with the mother of his father's rebirth, the half-Japanese Hoyang Consort. She bears him a son, whom he brings back to Japan to live with the Hoyang Consort's mother, the Yoshino Nun. After the Yoshino Nun passes away, Chūnagon takes her daughter, the Yoshino Princess, into his care, although a seer urges him to avoid marriage with her. Chūnagon <b>dreams</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hoyang Consort being very sick, and soon he is told by a spirit that she died and is now in the Buddhist heavenly realm called Trayastrimsa. The Yoshino Princess is kidnapped by the Crown Prince and impregnated by him.

25|$|The rivalry {{began with}} the teams' first meeting in 1991, with annual {{meetings}} beginning in 2005 when the Knights entered C-USA. Playing in the same division East Carolina and UCF were permanent opponents under the conference's scheduling structure. In recent years, the match between UCF and East Carolina has determined {{the winner of the}} Eastern Division. In 2007, UCF's only conference loss came {{at the hands of the}} Pirates. UCF won the division anyway, and ultimately took the conference title. In 2008, UCF was looking like they were going to ruin East Carolina's <b>dreams</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Eastern Division title like they did to Marshall, but with a late rally, the Pirates won in overtime making the Pirates the first C-USA team to beat UCF in Spectrum Stadium. A loss at East Carolina also determined them as the Eastern Division champions in 2009, while a UCF win at home was the difference in 2010. In the final scheduled meeting of the two schools in 2012, it would be UCF that would win 40–20, despite falling behind 14–0 early on. As of now, the final count in the series in 9–4 in favor of East Carolina. The rivalry resumed when the Pirates joined UCF in the American Athletic Conference in 2014. UCF won as time expired on a 51-yard Hail Mary pass from Justin Holman to Breshad Perriman, 32–30. This allowed for them to win back to back conference championships. ECU would blow out a winless UCF team the next year, 44-7. One year later, UCF would beat ECU 47-29 under first-year head coach, Scott Frost, against ECU's first-year head coach, Scottie Montgomery.|$|E
