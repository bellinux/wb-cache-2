Integrated product development is a process where both upstream (e. g., functional requirements, styling and cosmetic features, and packaging) and downstream (e. g., manufacturing considerations, testing, dunnage, and disposal) requirements of a product are handled concurrently with its geometry construction. In this research, the so-called ECHO (Engineering Constraint Handling and Optimization) system for integrated product development has been developed. A unique feature of this system is that it can explicitly represent and process both the upstream and <b>downstream</b> <b>requirements.</b> These requirements are represented in the form of constraint networks, rule networks, and assessment matrices. By solving for all of the feasible solutions, the ECHO system instructs the geometry construction, and thus ensures that both upstream and <b>downstream</b> <b>requirements</b> are reflected in the design. In its simplest form, the ECHO system consists of four tightly integrated components: a CSP (Constraint Satisfaction Problem) solver, an optimization solver, an expert system shell, and a solid modeler. The expert system shell and solid modeler are two well known commercial software, namely, Smart Element and Pro/ENGINEER. They are seamlessly integrated into the ECHO system with the developed 2 ̆ 2 Integration Interface. 2 ̆ 2 Through this 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 Integration Interface, 2 ̆ 2 the ECHO system instructs and manipulates the geometry construction in the solid modeler. By inheriting the geometry data through the 2 ̆ 2 Integration Interface, 2 ̆ 2 the ECHO system also provides a user-friendly, on-line interactive rule network development and modification environment.

In this paper a new mathematical model is introduced which could present optimal operation considering <b>downstream</b> <b>requirements</b> of turnouts, canal inlet flow, actual constraints and real conditions of canal system. Four performance indicators of delivery including efficiency, adequacy, equity and stability are considered as an objective function in the process of optimization. Since this objective function is an implicit function of decision variables (regulation of turnouts and control structures) and hydraulic parameters, it is necessary to implement hydrodynamic model, using numerical optimization methods. SA (Simulated Annealing) technique is a numerical meta – heuristic intelligent search method which is used in combination with a hydrodynamic model (ICSS) (Irrigation Conveyance System Simulation.) for performance optimization of canal system. Theoretically it is proven that SA technique is capable of tending towards global optimum solution asymtotically. Taking short random steps in SA algorithm guarantees avoiding instability in hydrodynamic model. The developed model has been applied on E 1 R 1 Distributary canal of Dez irrigation network for ten days. The results indicated that optimal performance improved very well in comparison with the present situation. In this model the weighting coefficients of indicators are determined using sensitivity analysis in optimization process. Consistency test on the derived coefficients shows that proposed method is appropriate. Applying weighting coefficients for performance indicators in the processes of optimization has resulted in 7 to 21 percent improvement compared to the case of equall weighting coefficients.

While starting with a design-manufacturing alignment, gradually the CE way of thinking has been ex-tended to incorporate more lifecycle functions together with a stronger focus on and involvement of both customers and suppliers. Application of CE in practice has led to remarkable cost savings, time reduction and quality improvement. However, many failures have been reported too. Often, the complex system of CE has not been sufficiently well understood, in particular because the system that is needed to market, produce, sell, and maintain the new product, the so-called production system, has not been considered sufficiently. The particular properties of the production system that is needed to really make the new product a success need to be understood well, because they heavily influence the CE process. In this chapter a history of CE is sketched as well as its major achievements and challenges. The essentials of the system of CE are described together with the system that is designed by it: the production system. The production system, as defined in this chapter, is an encompassing system, because it also comprises functions like marketing, sales, production, and maintenance.

40|$|The U. S. Water and Power Resources Service is {{considering}} reregulating Lake Mohave water levels {{to increase the}} net power benefit from Hoover Dam. Reregulation will not increase the generation capacity of the Hoover powerplant but it will enable the plant operation to be increased when the energy has greater monetary value. Energy generated {{at different times of}} the year has different market value, the highest being in January-March and July- September. By generating more power during these periods more net monetary benefit can be derived from Hoover Dam. The total volume of water released from Hoover Dam over an annual period must remain unchanged due to <b>downstream</b> water <b>requirements</b> for irrigation. To obtain this power benefit, therefore, less water for generation would be discharged during the low market value periods to enable higher discharges during the high market value periods. The discharge regime at Davis Dam would also remain unchanged in order to meet <b>downstream</b> water <b>requirements.</b> Therefore more extreme fluctuations in Lake Mohave water levels would result in order to accommodate changes in the Hoover Dam discharge regime. Water levels in Lake Mohave presently fluctuate from a maximum elevation of about 647 ft. in February-April to a minimum of 630. 5 ft. in September- November. The minimum elevation has been maintained to accommodate the marinas on the lake.

In chapter 2, Generation 7 (G 7) poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers (G 7 -NH 2) with amine termination were prepared to investigate polymer/cell membrane interaction. C 6 cells were employed in this experiment because of their unique characteristic of inherently lacking GM 1 but still possessing <b>downstream</b> <b>requirements</b> for successful GM 1 mediated endocytosis. This resulted in the reported binary experiment where C 6 cells without and with GM 1 did not show differential G 7 -NH 2 uptake supporting the hypothesis that GM 1 mediated endocytosis is not the primary pathway for G 7 -NH 2 internalization. In addition to understanding uptake mechanisms, {{efforts to improve the}} polymer-based vector systems have assumed that cells play a passive role and don’t actively respond to these polymer vector systems. In chapter 3, I will show how cells respond to different polymer systems by activating different levels of cytosolic nucleases and how this nuclease activity can be measured with the help of Molecular Beacon (MB). We also learn that membrane porosity is not the reason for nuclease activation. This nuclease activation decreases gene expression, ultimately decreasing polymer efficiency. In doing this, I show {{that it is possible to}} screen multiple polymer-based vector systems, thereby increasing the probability of identifying and designing an efficient polymer vector system. In chapter 4, I will concentrate on DNA degradation characteristics of these cytosolic nucleases. High-throughput sequencing was used to identify and quantify degradation patterns of these cytosolic nucleases on a plasmid.

40|$|The {{dissemination}} of tumor cells to distant organs i. e. metastasis is an exceedingly complex process leading to 90 % of all cancer deaths. Despite being so clinically important, {{little is known}} about this process that requires tumor cells to leave the primary tumor site, intravasate and transport through the blood stream, extravasate and colonize at secondary sites leading to distant metastases. Survivin, a member of the IAP (Inhibitor of Apoptosis) family with known functions in apoptosis and mitosis, is highly expressed in aggressive tumors and is associated with poor prognosis and adverse clinical outcome. But the mechanistic role of survivin in metastatic dissemination has not been investigated. In this study, we demonstrate an important and novel role of survivin in activating a broad gene expression program in tumor cells. Of particular importance is the upregulation of a distinct class of cell adhesion molecules, particularly fibronectin. This IAP mediated gene regulation requires synergistic intermolecular cooperation between survivin and its related cofactor molecule, XIAP that results in activation of NF-κB dependent fibronectin gene expression. The binding of fibronectin with its cognate cell surface receptors initiates outside–in signaling leading to the autocrine and paracrine activation of cell motility kinases, FAK and Src, in turn leading to enhanced tumor invasion and metastasis. The importance of survivin and XIAP in the process of metastasis has also been demonstrated in vivo using intrasplenic injections in mouse models. Overall this study is the first to place survivin upstream of transcriptional activation of gene expression particularly fibronectin. In addition, it also demonstrates the importance of survivin-XIAP complex in mediating NF-κB activation which in turn switches on the expression of various target genes involved in tumor metastasis. Hence this study dissects the upstream and <b>downstream</b> <b>requirements</b> of survivin- XIAP complex mediated tumor dissemination and metastasis. Significance of this Study The hallmark of end-stage cancer is metastasis, an incurable condition almost invariably associated with death from disease.

Every reservoir is designed to meet different <b>downstream</b> <b>requirements</b> relating to water supplies, hydropower, the environment, recreation, and flood control. These demands need to be met in the most effective and reliable way. According to Wurbs (2005), the greatest benefits of storage systems include the maximization of hydropower generation, the maximization of the advantages of irrigation projects based on reservoir water, the reduction of flood damage, and so on. These benefits are represented by objective functions, which have values that change with changes in decision variables. Many studies have been conducted using the GA to derive optimal policies for achieving various objectives at different reservoirs. Wardlaw and Sharif (1999) used a four-reservoir, deterministic, finite-horizon problem to evaluate several alternative formulations of a GA for reservoir systems. Real-value coding, tournament selection, uniform crossover, and modified uniform mutation were chosen for application to find the optimal. A GA approach was applied by Sharif and Wardlaw (2000) to find the optimal solution for a reservoir system in Indonesia. The GA approach was compared with discrete differential dynamic programming (DDDP). GAs with artificial intelligence characteristics were applied to the multi-reservoir system in the Chou-Shui River Basin in central Taiwan (Kuo et al. 2003) to obtain the optimal rule curves for maximizing the benefits for power generation, water supply, irrigation, and recreational purposes. The operational model coupled with use of simulation and GAs for hydropower purposes in multi-reservoir systems was presented by Lin et al. (2005). For case study, the joint operation of the Shihmen and Festui reservoirs in northern Taiwan was chosen. To derive the optimal operational strategies for the Pechiparai Reservoir in Tamil Nadu, India, Jothiprakash and Shanthi (2006) developed and applied a GA model. The objective function was to minimize the annual sum of the squared deviation to obtain the desired irrigation release and the desired storage volume. Reddy and Kumar (2006) derived an optimal operation policy by employing a multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) for a multipurpose reservoir system, the Bhadra Reservoir system, in India. This reservoir serves hydropower generation, multiple purposes irrigation, and <b>downstream</b> water quality <b>requirements.</b> The niche genetic algorithm (NGA) was suggested by Li and Mei (2007) for improving the capability of the traditional algorithm in the optimal operation of reservoir releases. This method has been adopted to derive the optimal operation policy for the cascaded hydropower stations of the Qing River, China. Azamathulla et al. (2008) compared the performance of a GA and the linear programming of by applying them to real-time reservoir operation in an existing Chiller reservoir system in Madhya Pradesh, India. These models were designed to maximize reservoir operation by using knowledge of the total irrigation demand. Hinçal et al. (2011) explored the efficiency and effectiveness of the GA in the optimization of multi-reservoir systems. This model was used to maximize the energy production of three reservoirs in the Colorado River Storage Project in the USA. Xu et al. (2012) suggested a new form for the GA in the operation of a multi-reservoir system consisting of five reservoirs. The performance of this proposed GA was evaluated by comparing its results with those of the traditional GA. Based on a multi-use reservoir system, the optimal rule curves were derived by Ngoc et al. (2014) for Dau Tieng Reservoir, located in the upper Saigon River in southern Vietnam. A penalty strategy and a constrained genetic algorithm (CGA) were applied. This model was simulated for 240  months and evaluated through a generalized shortage index (GSI).|$|R
30|$|A {{method for}} {{teaching}} collaborative software development in realistic distributed multidisciplinary environments was applied by three Texan universities (Burnell et al. 2002). In the analysis activity, students created the requirements model, {{which included the}} specification of use cases to capture functional <b>requirements.</b> <b>Downstream</b> software development activities were {{also included in the}} process. No statistical analysis was reported. An organising framework with which to study multicultural distributed learning teams was proposed in Swigger et al. (2009). Learning team performance and its relations with culture, individual differences, and attitudes toward collaborative work were studied by starting from two GSD projects involving 152 students from the USA, Panama, UK and Turkey. Extensive statistical analysis was carried out. The findings showed that culture and attitudes about groups had the most effect on team performance, followed by individual characteristics.|$|R
40|$|Hydropower energy {{production}} policies are usually defined trying {{to maximize the}} economical revenue, obeying to environmental restrictions and established <b>downstream</b> water uses <b>requirements.</b> Behind minimum daily averages of river ecological discharges, the hourly nature of the hydropower production schemes presents a pronounced effect on downstream river water quantity and quality. However, the capacity to control the river behaviour {{can be used to}} efficiently improve river water quality management practices if we can anticipate the performance of different management strategies. This paper presents a methodology to assess the performance of different turbine discharges schemes related with downstream river water quality. Three different performance indicators are presented and their computation is derived from a hydrodynamic and water quality river model implemented in Sobek. This methodology is applied to a Portuguese river: the river Cávado...|$|R
40|$|Latent {{variable}} {{regression model}} (LVRM) inversion {{has been demonstrated}} to be a valid tool to support the design of new products and processes and for process control. One of the basic assumptions of LVRM inversion is that the set of desired characteristics specified for the inversion must adhere to the covariance structure of the historical data used to build the model. When developing a new product, {{it is not unusual}} that the desired product characteristics are assigned or allowed to vary slightly so as to satisfy the end-customer or the <b>downstream</b> processing <b>requirements.</b> If these values do not obey the covariance structure described by the LVRM, a mismatch between the model estimates obtained from the inversion solution and the desired product properties is observed. In this paper we address the above-mentioned issue: starting from a set product characteristics that does not comply with the LVRM structure, we propose a strategy to assist the selection of the new product quality profile, which is most suitable for LVRM inversion. Two approaches exploiting the desired values for the product characteristics and the LVRM parameters are proposed to reconstruct a new product profile in order to minimize the mismatch between model estimates and desired product properties. The feasibility of the proposed methodology is tested in a pharmaceutical product development case study, where the product is obtained through high-shear wet granulation...|$|R
