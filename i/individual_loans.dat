5000|$|The {{secondary}} {{mortgage market}} {{was intended to}} provide {{a new source of}} capital for the market when the traditional source in one market—such as a Savings and loan association (S&L) or [...] "thrift" [...] in the United States—was unable to. It also was hoped to be more efficient than the old localized market for funds which might have a shortage or surplus depending on the location. [...] In theory, the risk of default on <b>individual</b> <b>loans</b> was greatly reduced by this aggregation process, such that even high-risk <b>individual</b> <b>loans</b> could be treated as part of an AAA-risk (safest possible) investment.|$|E

40|$|MBA 2013 ABSTRACT Banks {{have been}} {{struggling}} since the 2008 global financial collapse to generate consistent and reasonable shareholder returns {{in the wake}} of a sluggish economic landscape. This research investigated whether banks are successful in adapting to changes in the economy, by comparing the realised returns generated before and after the financial collapse, at an <b>individual</b> <b>loan</b> account level. Banks that have superior credit risk pricing models, driven by a pro-active credit risk department, will survive the onslaught of future economic downturns and come out stronger and more competitive. <b>Individual</b> <b>loan</b> data was collected from a credit provider to establish whether credit departments are pro-active in assessing credit risk and pricing for it accurately, in the context of a changing economic environment. Based on the results, banks are not successful in pricing through economic cycles. Banks need to continuously measure and back-test the realised returns of loans and loan portfolios using simple techniques like internal rates of return, driven by real cash flows instead of relying mainly on the financial results produced by accounting standards, which can be biased and judgemental...|$|R
50|$|In addition, the GSEs {{created a}} {{secondary}} market in loans through guarantees, bonding and securitization. This has allowed primary market debt issuers to increase loan volume and decrease {{the risks associated}} with <b>individual</b> <b>loans.</b> This also provides standardized instruments (securitized securities) for investors.|$|E

2500|$|The {{scholarly}} {{consensus is}} that IMF decision-making is not simply technocratic, but also guided by political and economic concerns. The United States is the IMF's most powerful member, and its influence reaches even into decision-making concerning <b>individual</b> <b>loan</b> agreements. The North American giant is openly opposed to losing what Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew describes as its [...] "leadership role" [...] at the IMF, [...] "our ability to shape international norms and practices".|$|R
50|$|In some {{countries}} where TLM works, savings groups (or self-help groups) have been established. The {{members of these}} groups are encouraged to save {{a small amount of}} money each week. The money is then placed into a kitty. The kitty can then be used by the group as a whole - to set up a group business or a community project - or members can apply for an <b>individual</b> <b>loan</b> from the group.|$|R
50|$|Solidarity lending {{takes place}} through ‘solidarity groups’. These groups are a {{distinctive}} banking distribution channel used primarily to deliver microcredit to poor people. Solidarity lending lowers {{the costs to}} a financial institution related to assessing, managing and collecting loans, and can {{eliminate the need for}} collateral. Since there is a fixed cost associated with each loan delivered, a bank that bundles <b>individual</b> <b>loans</b> together and permits a group to manage individual relationships can realize substantial savings in administrative and management costs.|$|E
5000|$|The {{standard}} model (also called [...] "100% PSA") works as follows: Starting with an annualized prepayment rate of 0.2% in month 1, the rate increases by 0.2% each month, {{until it reaches}} 6% in month 30. From the 30th month onward, the model assumes an annualized prepayment rate of 6% of the remaining balance. Each monthly prepayment is assumed to represent full payoff of <b>individual</b> <b>loans,</b> rather than a partial prepayment that leaves a loan with a reduced principal balance.|$|E
50|$|Loan Officers {{ride out}} to the rural areas on {{motorcycles}} and people about MLF. Those who are interested are then encouraged to form groups of between 12-20 members. The Loan Officers provide training of about eight sessions to the groups before the first loan is dispensed. These loans can {{be as little as}} £20 but on average the loans are about £62. These loans are charged a service-charge and are not entirely free. Like the Grameen Bank model, the women take <b>individual</b> <b>loans</b> but have collective responsibility for repayment of each others' loans. Repayments are recycled and reused to make more loans.|$|E
50|$|In Kotteakos v. United States, Simon Brown, {{owner of}} a {{construction}} company, conspired with Kotteakos and 31 other persons to defraud the Government by filing false statements in applications for loans for modernization and renovation under the National Housing Act. No connections was shown between the <b>individual</b> <b>loan</b> applicants. In each case, however, Brown induced the applicants to file the loan application and assisted them in applying, {{in return for a}} 5% commission.|$|R

5000|$|The first (known as [...] "The Palmer") {{was built}} as a wedding present from Potter Palmer to his bride Bertha Honoré. It opened on September 26, 1871, but burned down just 13 days later on October 9, 1871 in the Great Chicago Fire. Palmer {{immediately}} set to work rebuilding, and with a $1.7 million signature loan (believed {{to be the largest}} <b>individual</b> <b>loan</b> ever secured at that time), constructed one of the fanciest hotels worldwide in postfire Chicago.|$|R
5000|$|Kiva {{does not}} publish the {{interest}} rates charged for the <b>individual</b> <b>loans</b> funded through its website. However, it does publish the average [...] "Portfolio Yield" [...] of each of its field partners, {{as a way for}} prospective lenders to estimate the cost to the borrower of the loans they consider funding. The [...] "Portfolio Yield" [...] measures the average income earned from the field partner's outstanding loan portfolio. [...] Some observers have pointed out that the [...] "Portfolio Yield" [...] measure is unreliable, and does not directly reflect the actual price that borrowers are paying for the loans.|$|E
50|$|A {{dumping ground}} for {{non-performing}} energy {{and real estate}} loans, Grant Street was spun off with its own five-member {{board of directors and}} about $130 million in Mellon capital; it was named for a main street in Pittsburgh which was home to Mellon Financial headquarters. It took no public deposits. Mellon shareholders were issued shares in both the good and bad banks on a one-for-one basis, as a dividend. After the Grant Street National Bank had fulfilled its purpose, issuing preferred shares and equity purchase contracts to finance the purchase of $1 billion in Mellon's bad loans at 57% of face value, then collecting what it could on the <b>individual</b> <b>loans,</b> it was liquidated and its employees quietly returned to Mellon Bank.|$|E
5000|$|A {{residential}} mortgage-backed security (RMBS) is {{a reference}} to the general package of financial agreements that typically represents cash yields that are paid to investors and that are supported by cash payments received from homeowners who pay interest and principal according to terms agreed to with their lenders; it is a funding instrument created by the [...] "originator" [...] or [...] "sponsor" [...] of the mortgage loan; without cross-collateralizing <b>individual</b> <b>loans</b> and mortgages (because {{it would be impossible to}} receive permission from individual homeowners), it is a funding instrument that pools the cash flow received from individuals and pays these cash receipts out with waterfall priorities that enable investors to become comfortable with the certainty of receipt of cash at any point in time.|$|E
50|$|The bank {{followed}} the Grameen Bank experimentation with conversion of borrowers from joint liability <b>loans,</b> to <b>individual</b> liability <b>loans,</b> with no drop in repayments.|$|R
50|$|Consumer issue: As {{a result}} of {{standardized}} products without considering customer requirements, many customers are dissatisfied with the terms and wish for more <b>individual</b> <b>loan</b> conditions. For group loans, for example, many clients dislike guaranteeing for each other, because they might not know the other clients well enough. Other clients have complained about time-consuming, weekly meetings and training with trainers, who are often too young and inexperienced. This is especially a cultural problem for older clients, who feel offended by taking advice from younger people.|$|R
50|$|This {{addressed}} the liquidity problem and, {{in contrast to}} traditional securitization markets, resulted in making the loan requests of peer-to-peer companies more transparent for the lenders and secondary buyers who can access the detailed information concerning each <b>individual</b> <b>loan</b> (without knowing the actual identities of borrowers) before deciding which loans to fund. The peer-to-peer companies are also required to detail their offerings in a regularly updated prospectus. The SEC makes the reports {{available to the public}} via their EDGAR (Electronic Data-Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval) system.|$|R
