Early efforts included mobile viewing units that broadcast the show <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>cities,</b> in Appalachia, in Native American communities, and in migrant worker camps. During the early 1980s, the CTW created the Preschool Education Program (PEP), whose goal was to assist preschools, by combining television viewing, books, hands-on activities, and other media, in using the series as an educational resource. The Workshop also provided materials to non-English speaking children and adults. Starting during 2006, the Workshop expanded its programs by creating a series of PBS specials and DVDs largely concerning how military deployment affects the families of soldiers. Other efforts by the Workshop concerned families of prisoners, health and wellness, and safety.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} time, {{large amounts of}} federal money went to public schools. In {{practice}} ESEA meant helping all public school districts, with more money going to districts that had large proportions of students from poor families (which included all the big cities). For the first time private schools (most of them Catholic schools <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>cities)</b> received services, such as library funding, comprising about 12percent of the ESEA budget. Though federal funds were involved, they were administered by local officials, and by 1977 {{it was reported that}} {{less than half of the}} funds were actually applied toward the education of children under the poverty line. Dallek further reports that researchers cited by Hugh Davis Graham soon found that poverty had more to do with family background and neighborhood conditions than the quantity of education a child received. Early studies suggested initial improvements for poor children helped by ESEA reading and math programs, but later assessments indicated that benefits faded quickly and left pupils little better off than those not in the schemes. Johnson's second major education program was the Higher Education Act of 1965, which focused on funding for lower income students, including grants, work-study money, and government loans.|$|E

According to Cleverley and Phillips, the television show Sesame Street is also [...] "based on Lockean assumptions—its aim has been to give underprivileged children, especially <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>cities,</b> the simple ideas and basic experiences that their environment normally does not provide." [...] In many ways, despite Locke's continuing influence, as these authors point out, the twentieth century {{has been dominated by}} the [...] "nature vs. nurture" [...] debate in a way that Locke's century was not. Locke's optimistic [...] "environmentalism," [...] though qualified in his text, is now no longer just a moral issue – it is also a scientific issue.|$|E

[...] In what Morrow called [...] "an extensive campaign" [...] that Lesser stated [...] "would demand {{at least as}} much ingenuity as production and research", they promoted the show with educators and the broadcast industry. [...] The Workshop understood that a special effort had to be made to reach their target community because traditional methods of promotion and advertising were not effective with these groups. To get the word out to their target audience <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>cities,</b> they hired Evelyn Davis from the Urban League, whom Michael Davis called [...] "remarkable, unsinkable, and indispensable", as the Workshop's first Vice President of Community Relations and head of the Workshop's Community Educational Services (CES) division.|$|E
500|$|The Artizans, Labourers & General Dwellings Company (Artizans Company) was {{established}} in 1867 by William Austin. Austin was an illiterate who had begun his working life on a farm as a scarecrow paid 1 penny per day, and had {{worked his way up}} to become a drainage contractor. The company {{was established}} as a for-profit joint stock company, with the objective of building new houses for the working classes [...] "in consequence of the destruction of houses by railroads and other improvements". The company aimed to fuse the designs of rural planned suburbs such as Bedford Park with the ethos of high-quality homes for the lower classes pioneered at Saltaire. Whilst earlier philanthropic housing companies such as the Peabody Trust and the Improved Industrial Dwellings Company focused on multi-storey blocks of flats <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>cities,</b> the Artizans Company aimed to build low-rise housing in open countryside alongside existing railway lines to allow workers to live in the countryside and commute into the city. The company attracted the attention of Lord Shaftesbury, who served as president until 1875.|$|E

2500|$|Starting in {{the summer}} of 1940 anti-Semitic laws started to come into force in both the {{occupied}} and unoccupied zones. On 3 October 1940 Vichy introduced the statut des Juifs, requiring all Jews in France to register with the authorities and banned Jews from professions such as the law, the universities, medicine and the public service. Jewish businesses were [...] "Aryanized" [...] by being placed in the hands of [...] "Aryan" [...] trustees who engaged in the most blatant corruption while Jews were banned from cinemas, music halls, fairs, museums, libraries, public parks, cafes, theatres, concerts, restaurants, swimming pools and markets. Jews could not move unless informing the police first, own radios or bicycles, were denied phone service, could only use phone booths marked Accès interdit aux Juifs and were only allowed to ride the last carriage on the Paris Metro. The French people at the time distinguished between the Israélites (a polite term in French) who were [...] "properly" [...] assimilated French Jews and the Juifs (a derogatory term in French) who were the [...] "foreign" [...] and [...] "unassimilated" [...] Jews who were widely seen as criminals from abroad living in slums <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>cities</b> of France. All through the 1930s, the number of illegal Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe was vastly exaggerated, and popular opinion believed that the majority of Jews living in France were illegal immigrants who were causing all sorts of social problems. In a context where the number of Jews in France, and even more so the number of illegal Jewish immigrants were much exaggerated, Ousby noted about the introduction of the first anti-Semitic laws in 1940: [...] "There was no sigh of public opposition to what was happening, or even widespread unease at the direction in which events were heading [...] [...] [...] Many people, perhaps even most people, were indifferent. In the autumn of 1940 they had other things to think about; later they could find little room for fellow-feeling or concern for the public good in their own struggle to survive. What happened to the Jews were a secondary matter; it was beyond their immediate affairs, it belonged to that realm of the 'political' which they could not longer control or even bring themselves to follow with much interest".|$|E

This was in part because the cost of {{building}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>cities</b> was higher, and in part because the government believed that children were better raised in suburban sections rather than on the streets. The urban poor also were largely unable to afford the rents for the new state houses.

Māori were excluded, in part because they could not afford the rentals, but also because the government believed the races should be kept apart.|$|E
