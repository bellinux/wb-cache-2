5|$|Hitler {{wanted to}} {{maintain}} the threat of invasion by continuing air attacks on military targets in the British capital. Hans Jeschonnek still pushed <b>for</b> <b>attacks</b> on civilian morale. He argued that military and civilian industries were located too far apart to achieve a collapse of morale by attacking the former. Instead, he pressed <b>for</b> <b>attacks</b> against residential areas. Hitler refused. He ordered that only military targets in London were to be attacked.|$|E
5|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, {{only a few}} sharks are {{dangerous}} to humans. Out of more than 470 species, only four {{have been involved in}} a significant number of fatal, unprovoked attacks on humans: the great white, oceanic whitetip, tiger, and bull sharks. These sharks are large, powerful predators, and may sometimes attack and kill people. Despite being responsible <b>for</b> <b>attacks</b> on humans they have all been filmed without using a protective cage.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the war, {{the militias}} of collaborationist {{political}} parties also began to participate actively in reprisals <b>for</b> <b>attacks</b> or assassinations by the resistance. These included both reprisal assassinations of leading figures suspected of resistance involvement or sympathy (including Alexandre Galopin, head of the Société Générale, who was assassinated in February 1944) or retaliatory massacres against civilians. Foremost among these was the Courcelles Massacre, a reprisal by Rexist paramilitaries for the assassination of a Burgomaster, in which 20 civilians were killed. A similar massacre also took place at Meensel-Kiezegem, where 67 were killed.|$|E

5|$|What the Iroquois {{wanted was}} not war, but instead a better {{share of the}} fur trade. To serve as {{punishment}} <b>for</b> <b>attacks</b> on French fur fleets, New France ordered two expeditions under Courcelles and Tracy into Mohawk territory in 1666. These expeditions burned villages and destroyed much of the Mohawk winter corn supply. In addition, Denonville’s 1687 invasion of the Seneca nation country destroyed approximately 1,200,000 bushels of corn, crippling the Iroquois economy. This kind of aggression served as fuel for the Iroquois’ retaliation that was to come.|$|E
5|$|When the French and Indian War {{began in}} 1754 {{as part of}} the Seven Years' War, Franklin {{recruited}} militias. During the war, the city attracted many refugees from the western frontier. When Pontiac's Rebellion occurred in 1763, refugees again fled into the city, including a group of Lenape hiding from other Native Americans, angry at their pacifism, and white frontiersmen. The Paxton Boys tried to follow them into Philadelphia <b>for</b> <b>attacks,</b> but was prevented by the city's militia and Franklin, who convinced them to leave.|$|E
5|$|When {{the battle}} officially ended on 16 May, British Empire troops had made {{significant}} advances {{but had been}} unable to achieve a breakthrough. New tactics and the equipment to exploit them had been used, showing that the British had absorbed the lessons of the Battle of the Somme and could mount set-piece attacks against fortified field defences. After the Second Battle of Bullecourt (3–17 May), the Arras sector then returned to the stalemate that typified most of the war on the Western Front, except <b>for</b> <b>attacks</b> on the Hindenburg Line and around Lens, culminating in the Canadian Battle of Hill 70 (15–25 August).|$|E
5000|$|The primary {{projectile}} for 7 ton and 6½ ton guns was Palliser shot or shell <b>for</b> <b>attacking</b> armoured warships, fired {{with a large}} [...] "battering" [...] {{charge for}} maximum velocity. All guns were also equipped with shrapnel shells for anti-personnel use and explosive common shells <b>for</b> <b>attacking</b> unarmoured targets. The [...] "double" [...] common shell was much longer than the standard common shell, and hence contained approximately twice as much gunpowder. It was unstable in flight and hence inaccurate beyond 2,000 yards but was considered useful <b>for</b> <b>attacking</b> wooden warships at ranges below 2,000 yards.|$|R

5|$|Flanders {{was noted}} for {{introducing}} a 1954 {{motion in the}} Senate to censure Senator Joseph McCarthy. McCarthy had made sensational claims that there were large numbers of Communists and Soviet spies and sympathizers inside {{the federal government and}} elsewhere. He used his Senate committee as a nationally televised forum <b>for</b> <b>attacks</b> on individuals whom he accused. Flanders felt that McCarthy’s attacks distracted the nation from a much greater threat of Communist successes elsewhere in the world and that they had the effect of creating division and confusion within the United States, to the advantage of its enemies. Ultimately, McCarthy's tactics and his inability to substantiate his claims led to his being discredited and censured by the United States Senate.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} defend against further rival Spanish incursions from the southeast, Pedro de Alvarado {{established}} the Spanish town of San Miguel, which he also used as a base of operations <b>for</b> <b>attacks</b> against the Lenca. A Spanish force commanded by Luis de Moscoso Alvarado, consisting of about 120 Spanish cavalry, accompanied by infantry and Indian auxiliaries, crossed the Lempa River and founded San Miguel on 21 November 1530. In addition to the Spanish colonists, the settlement included Mexica and Tlaxcalan allies, among other Indian auxiliaries. Most of the Spanish population of San Miguel abandoned El Salvador with Pedro de Alvarado when he set out on his expedition to Peru.|$|E
5|$|Lenin tasked Trotsky with {{establishing}} a Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, {{and with his}} support, Trotsky organised a Revolutionary Military Council in September 1918, remaining its chairman until 1925. Recognising their valuable military experience, Lenin agreed that officers from the old Tsarist army could serve in the Red Army, although Trotsky established military councils to monitor their activities. The Reds held control of Russia's two largest cities, Moscow and Petrograd, {{as well as most}} of Great Russia, while the Whites were located largely on the former Empire's peripheries. The latter were therefore hindered by being both fragmented and geographically scattered, and because their ethnic Russian supremacism alienated the region's national minorities. Anti-Bolshevik armies carried out the White Terror, a campaign of violence against perceived Bolshevik supporters which was typically more spontaneous than the state-sanctioned Red Terror. Both White and Red Armies were responsible <b>for</b> <b>attacks</b> against Jewish communities, prompting Lenin to issue a condemnation of anti-Semitism, blaming prejudice against Jews on capitalist propaganda.|$|E

5|$|The {{border area}} between Acadia and New England {{remained}} uncertain despite battles {{along the border}} throughout King William's War. New France defined the border of Acadia as the Kennebec River in southern Maine. There were Catholic missions at Norridgewock and Penobscot and a French settlement in Penobscot Bay {{near the site of}} modern Castine, Maine, which had all been bases <b>for</b> <b>attacks</b> on New England settlers migrating toward Acadia during King William's War. The frontier areas between the Saint Lawrence River and the primarily coastal settlements of Massachusetts and New York were still dominated by Indians (primarily Abenaki and Iroquois), and the Hudson River–Lake Champlain corridor had also been used for raiding expeditions in both directions in earlier conflicts. The threat of Indians had receded somewhat because of reductions in the population as a result of disease and the last war, but they still posed a potent threat to outlying settlements.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{system of}} Mortal Kombat II is an improved {{version of that}} from the original Mortal Kombat. There are several changes in standard moves: a crouching punch and turnaround kick are added, low and high kicks have greater differentiation (be they crouching or standing up), the roundhouse kick are made more powerful (knocking an opponent across the screen, like the game's uppercut), and {{it is easier to}} perform a combo due to reduced recovery times <b>for</b> <b>attacks.</b> Returning characters also gained new special moves, including some to be used in mid-air, and the game plays almost twice as fast as the original. However, all playable characters in the game still share most generic attributes (such as power and jump height) and all normal moves are also the same between each character.|$|E
5|$|The warfare {{with the}} Prussians relied on guerilla raids {{in the border}} regions. Small groups of men, a dozen to a hundred, made quick raids on farms, villages, border posts, etc. This was a {{positional}} warfare where neither side could defeat the other, but the Teutonic Knights relied on future reinforcements from Germany and Europe, while Prussians were draining their local resources. After the massacre of surrendered Teutonic soldiers in the Battle of Krücken in 1249, the Knights refused {{to negotiate with the}} Prussians. The Prussians were also unable to coordinate their efforts and develop a common strategy: while each clan had its own leader, {{there was no one to}} lead all the clans. The Natangians had to watch <b>for</b> <b>attacks</b> from Balga, Brandenburg, Wehlau, and Königsberg while the Warmians were threatened by garrisons at Christburg and Elbing. This way only Diwane and his Bartians were able to continue the war in the west. They made several minor expeditions to Culmerland each year.|$|E

5|$|In 1066, William, the Duke of Normandy, took {{advantage}} of the English succession crisis to invade. With an army of Norman followers and mercenaries, he defeated Harold at the battle of Hastings and rapidly occupied the south of England. William used a network of castles to control the major centres of power, granting extensive lands to his main Norman followers and co-opting or eliminating the former Anglo-Saxon elite. Major revolts followed, which William suppressed before intervening in the north-east of England, establishing Norman control of York and devastating the region. Some Norman lords used England as a launching point <b>for</b> <b>attacks</b> into South and North Wales, spreading up the valleys to create new Marcher territories. By the time of William's death in 1087, England formed the largest part of an Anglo-Norman empire, ruled over by a network of nobles with landholdings across England, Normandy, and Wales. England's growing wealth was critical in allowing the Norman kings to project power across the region, including funding campaigns along the frontiers of Normandy.|$|E
5|$|In {{light of}} the poor results of the {{precision}} bombing campaign {{and the success of}} the 25February raid on Tokyo, and considering that many tons of incendiaries were now available to him, LeMay decided to begin firebombing attacks on Japan's main cities during early March 1945. This was in line with Arnold's targeting directive for XXIBomber Command, which specified that urban areas were to be accorded the second-highest priority <b>for</b> <b>attacks</b> after aircraft factories. The directive also stated that firebombing raids should be conducted once M-69 bombs had been tested in combat and the number of B-29s available was sufficient to launch an intensive campaign. LeMay did not seek Arnold's specific approval before launching his firebombing campaign, however, to protect the USAAF commander from criticism if the attacks were unsuccessful. The Twentieth Air Force's Chief of Staff, Brigadier General Lauris Norstad, was aware of the change in tactics though and provided support. The decision to use firebombing tactics represented a move away from the USAAF's previous focus on precision bombing, and was believed by senior officials in the military and US Government to be justified by the need to rapidly bring the war to an end.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the North Vietnamese {{offensive}} {{was slowly}} rolling over ARVN opposition {{north and south}} of Da Nang. General Dong's plan called <b>for</b> <b>attacks</b> on the area from the west, north, and south that would drive South Vietnamese forces into Da Nang, where they could be destroyed. The highway between Huế and Da Nang was cut at Phu Loc after severe fighting on 22 March. South of Da Nang, the 2nd ARVN Division barely managed to contain a North Vietnamese drive toward Tam Kỳ and the coastal plain. On the morning of 24 March, however, the 711th Division, backed by armored elements, seized Tam Kỳ, driving the population north toward Da Nang by the thousands. PAVN forces then cut Highway 1 between Quảng Ngãi and Chu Lai, a move to which the 2nd ARVN Division was too battered to respond. With Corps approval, South Vietnamese troops from Quảng Ngãi fought their way northward, but only a few managed to reach Chu Lai. In a single day the situation in I Corps had deteriorated beyond control.|$|E

5|$|The {{communist}} {{movement in}} Cambodia and Vietnam began before World War II with {{the founding of}} the Indochinese Communist Party (ICP), almost exclusively dominated by the Vietnamese, originally meant to fight French colonial rule in Indochina. In 1941, Nguyen Ai Quoc (commonly known by his alias Ho Chi Minh) founded the Viet Nam Doc Lap Dong Minh Hoi, or the Viet Minh. When the Japanese were defeated at the end of World War II, he initiated the first Indochinese war of independence against the French. During this time, Vietnamese forces made extensive use of Cambodian territory to transport weapons, supplies, and troops. This relationship lasted throughout the Vietnam War, when Vietnamese communists used Cambodia as a transport route and staging area <b>for</b> <b>attacks</b> on South Vietnam. In 1951, Vietnam guided the establishment of a separate Cambodian communist party, the Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party (KPRP), which allied with a nationalist separatist Cambodian movement, the Khmer Serei (Free Khmers), in order to pursue independence. In accordance with the 1954 Geneva Accords negotiating the end of the French domination, newly created communist North Vietnam pulled all of its Viet Minh soldiers and cadres out of Cambodia; however, since the KPRP was staffed primarily by ethnic Vietnamese or Cambodians under its tutelage, approximately 5,000 Communist cadres went with them.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure to}} {{coordinate}} the FAA, RAF and Navy dispersed any counterstrike. Confusion owing to {{the weather and the}} lack of any centralised control of British sea and air forces caused each element to work independently of one another. This caused several friendly fire incidents, such as the attack by No. 217 Squadron on HMS Mackay. The most serious failure was Fighter Command’s failure to provide adequate protection to bomber and naval forces. Although the weather also prevented greater German fighter activity by the time the target area was reached, valuable time had been lost by bomber formations searching for their fighter escorts over the rendezvous positions which either never arrived or were given incorrect orders or direction too late to be acted upon. Little communication was enabled between fighter and bomber units, but also between the strike units themselves. Compounding the problems, RAF Bomber Command’s crews, which made up the majority of the strike forces, were not trained <b>for</b> <b>attacks</b> against naval targets. The only anti-shipping torpedo-bomber squadrons were No. 42 and 217 Squadrons of Coastal Command, which owing to logistical issues, were five torpedoes short of their total complement.|$|E
5|$|The {{scheme of}} {{manoeuvre}} adopted by 1 RAR dictated that each company undertake a dispersed patrol program {{in their own}} tactical area of responsibility, a fact which {{would allow them to}} search more ground, but limit their ability to concentrate combat power in the event of contact. A Company, under Major John Healy, patrolled east; B Company moved north along the Song Be to Xom Xoai, while D Company patrolled south. C Company remained at LZ Queen to protect 105 Field Battery which had established a fire support base (FSB). Over the next two days the Australians patrolled relentlessly through the leech-infested swamps and dense jungle. At midday on 6 November A Company received two mortar rounds which failed to do any damage, but marked the start of a series of minor clashes. A Company had a number of contacts during this time, with the Australians killing a Viet Cong scout for the loss of two wounded in one skirmish. A further contact soon after resulted in two more Viet Cong killed and one wounded. Intelligence gained from these incidents indicated the presence of a Viet Cong Main Force Regiment in the area, while documents recovered contained plans <b>for</b> <b>attacks</b> on ARVN outposts near Bien Hoa Airbase.|$|E
