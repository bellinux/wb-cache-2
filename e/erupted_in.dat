5|$|The {{office of}} Governor General was {{abandoned}} in 1669, deemed unnecessary. However, when the Scanian War <b>erupted</b> <b>in</b> 1675, {{the office was}} reinstated, and Fabian von Fersen held the office between 1675 and 1677, {{when he died in}} the defence of Malmö.|$|E

5|$|A {{large-scale}} uprising <b>erupted</b> <b>in</b> Serbia {{following the}} Axis {{invasion of the}} Soviet Union in June 1941. Although they took no part in the rebellion, Jews were targeted for retaliatory execution by the Germans. The Germans soon implemented a number of anti-Jewish laws, {{and by the end}} of August 1941, all Serbian Jewish males were interned in concentration camps, primarily at Topovske Šupe in Belgrade.|$|E

5|$|After the {{adoption}} of the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine in November 1947, a civil war <b>erupted</b> <b>in</b> the British Mandate of Palestine. The Jews living in Jerusalem constituted one of the weak points of the Yishuv and a main cause for concern to its leaders. With nearly 100,000 inhabitants, a sixth of the total Jewish population in the Mandate, the city was isolated in the heart of territory under Arab control.|$|E
5|$|Airborne {{volcanic}} ash can reflect the Sun's rays back into space and thereby contribute to cooling the planet. Dips in earth temperatures {{have been observed}} after large volcano eruptions such as Mount Agung in Bali that <b>erupted</b> <b>in</b> 1963, El Chichon (Mexico) 1983, Ruiz (Colombia) 1985, and Pinatubo (Philippines) 1991. But even for major eruptions, the ash clouds remain only for relatively short periods.|$|E
5|$|As the Cultural Revolution <b>erupted</b> <b>in</b> 1966, Chairman Mao Zedong {{called for}} the {{destruction}} of the Four Olds, and teenage Red Guards rampaged through people's homes to destroy relics of pre-Communist China. Desperate Shanghai collectors sought protection of their antiques at the Shanghai Museum, and Ma slept in his office to take phone calls and to dispatch museum employees around the clock.|$|E

5|$|At least 1,283 geysers have <b>erupted</b> <b>in</b> Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, United States, and {{an average}} of 465 geysers are active there in a given year. A geyser's eruptive {{activity}} may change or cease due to ongoing mineral deposition within the geyser plumbing, exchange of functions with nearby hot springs, earthquake influences, and human intervention.|$|E
5|$|Controversy <b>erupted</b> <b>in</b> June 1965 when Queen Elizabeth II {{appointed}} {{all four}} Beatles Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) after Prime Minister Harold Wilson nominated {{them for the}} award. In protest – the honour {{was at that time}} primarily bestowed upon military veterans and civic leaders – some conservative MBE recipients returned their own insignia.|$|E
5|$|Couillard first {{appeared}} in the national media when she dated the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Maxime Bernier. The Bernier-Couillard Affair <b>erupted</b> <b>in</b> May 2008 over confidential, NATO-related documents left at Couillard's house. Media coverage, and Bernier's reaction, left Couillard feeling victimized. To help dispel rumours regarding her life and her role with Bernier, Couillard signed a book deal.|$|E

50|$|Mixed {{dentition}} stage starts {{when the}} first permanent molar appears in the mouth, usually at five or six years, and lasts until the last primary tooth is lost, usually at ten, eleven, or twelve years. There are 32 permanent teeth {{and those of the}} maxillae <b>erupt</b> <b>in</b> a different order from permanent mandibular teeth. Maxillary teeth typically <b>erupt</b> <b>in</b> the following order: (1) first molar (2) central incisor, (3) lateral incisor, (4) first premolar, (5) second premolar, (6) canine, (7) second molar, and (8) third molar. Mandibular teeth typically <b>erupt</b> <b>in</b> the following order: (1) first molar (2) central incisor, (3) lateral incisor, (4) canine, (5) first premolar, (6) second premolar, (7) second molar, and (8) third molar. While this is the most common eruption order, variation is not uncommon.|$|R
50|$|On March 10, 2006, NASA {{reported}} that the Cassini probe found evidence of liquid water reservoirs that <b>erupt</b> <b>in</b> geysers on Saturn's moon Enceladus.|$|R
5|$|District constable was {{powerless}} {{to stop the}} violence. In the 1840s, most suburban districts of Philadelphia were policed by elected constables and part-time watchmen. When violence <b>erupted</b> <b>in</b> a district, the time-consuming process involved the constable summoning the county sheriff, who would organize a posse. During the May 6 violence, the posse arrived armed only with clubs and was {{powerless to}} do anything.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the loss}} of {{territory}} required for the peace treaty, the embittered aristocracy started forming independent states within the Sasanian Empire. This divided {{the resources of the}} country. Furthermore, dams and canals became derelict, and a devastating plague <b>erupted</b> <b>in</b> the western provinces of Iran, killing half of the population along with Kavadh II, who was succeeded by Ardashir III.|$|E
5|$|Hualālai last <b>erupted</b> <b>in</b> 1801. A severe {{earthquake}} swarm shook the volcano in 1929, lasting about a month. This caused $100,000 worth {{of damage to}} the Kona district ($1.2 million as of 2010), and two earthquakes with magnitudes of 5.5 and 6.5 were felt {{as far away as}} Honolulu. This was probably caused by magma movement near the surface, but there was no surface activity or eruption.|$|E
50|$|Danan {{apparently}} joined Perboewatan in eruption {{sometime after}} May, 1680, when Perboewatan started erupting. A returning Dutch traveler saw both cones <b>erupting</b> <b>in</b> February, 1681.|$|R

5|$|In 2013, {{widespread}} protests <b>erupted</b> <b>in</b> many Turkish provinces, {{sparked by}} {{a plan to}} demolish Gezi Park but soon growing into general anti-government dissent. On 15–16 July 2016, an unsuccessful coup attempt tried to oust the government. As {{a reaction to the}} failed coup d'état, the government is currently carrying out mass purges.|$|E
5|$|Like other Iskut-Unuk River Cones, The Volcano has {{its origins}} in {{continental}} rifting—a long rupture in the Earth's crust where the lithosphere is being pulled apart. This incipient rifting has formed {{as a result of}} the Pacific Plate sliding northward along the Queen Charlotte Fault, on its way to the Aleutian Trench. As the continental crust stretches, the near surface rocks fracture along steeply dipping cracks parallel to the rift known as faults. Basaltic magma rises along these fractures to create effusive eruptions. The rift zone has existed for at least 14.9million years, and has created the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province. Several dormant volcanoes in the province are potentially active, with The Volcano being one of the three having <b>erupted</b> <b>in</b> the last few hundred years. Tseax Cone, which last <b>erupted</b> <b>in</b> the 18th century, is the southernmost volcano in the province, while Prindle Volcano in easternmost-central Alaska, which erupted more than 10,000years ago, is generally considered the northernmost.|$|E
5|$|Mount Adams, {{known by}} some Native American tribes as Pahto or Klickitat, is a {{potentially}} active stratovolcano in the Cascade Range. Although Adams has not <b>erupted</b> <b>in</b> more than 1,000years, {{it is not}} considered extinct. It is the second-highest mountain in the U.S. state of Washington, after Mount Rainier.|$|E
50|$|The {{fight with}} the Partisans have started nearly immediately. During 1941, an {{intermittent}} fighting was <b>erupting</b> <b>in</b> Virpazar, Rijeka, Cekanje pass near Cetinje, Šavnik and Kotor.|$|R
