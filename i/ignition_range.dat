The results show that two critical issues adversely affecting cavity flameholding are (i) slow rate of mixing between the main flow and the cavity flow, and (ii) combustion instability caused by feedback between pressure and flow rate fluctuations. These problems have been circumvented by increasing {{the length of the}} cavity and choking the fuel and the air flows, which resulted in flameholding at u= 35 - 100 m/sec and nearly complete combustion in premixed flows, and flameholding at u= 35 - 90 m/sec in non-premixed flows. ICCD camera images of the plasma show that it remains diffuse and stable after ignition has been achieved, as long as the flame is present in the cavity.

The location of first carbon ignition, quenching {{location of the}} carbon burning flames and flashes, angular frequency of the carbon core, and carbon core mass are studied {{as a function of}} the ZAMS mass, initial rotation rate, and mixing parameters such as convective overshoot, semiconvection, thermohaline and angular momentum transport. In general terms, we find these properties of carbon burning in SAGB models are not a strong function of the initial rotation profile, but are a sensitive function of the overshoot parameter. We quasi-analytically derive an approximate ignition density, ρ_ign≈ 2. 1 × 10 ^ 6 g cm^- 3, to predict the location of first carbon ignition in models that ignite carbon off-center. We also find that overshoot moves the ZAMS mass boundaries where off-center carbon ignition occurs at a nearly uniform rate of Δ M_ ZAMS/Δ f_ov≈ 1. 6 M_. For zero overshoot, f_ov= 0. 0, our models in the ZAMS mass range ≈ 8. 9 to 11 M_ show off-center carbon ignition. For canonical amounts of overshooting, f_ov= 0. 016, the off-center carbon <b>ignition</b> <b>range</b> shifts to ≈ 7. 2 to 8. 8 M_.

These studies set forth to model and study the conditions of such a situation, including ignition time and temperature profiles {{as a function of}} several constant incident low heat fluxes. 	A CO 2 laser was used as the radiant heat source for ignition of aluminized and non-aluminized AP based propellants. A piece of blackened aluminum foil was bound {{to the top of the}} propellant to simulate the rocket motor casing and the propellant-metal interface. Once ignition time data and temperature profiles were collected, theoretical models were developed to model the behavior of the propellants under these low flux conditions. 	It was discovered that under these conditions the samples still roughly exhibited the classic - 2 slope on a log time versus log flux plot. However, the ignition time did increase for the samples covered with foil, as expected, due to the absorptivity of the foil. The experimental temperature measurements during heating to ignition followed the classic transient, 1 D, semi-infinite solid with constant heat flux condition temperature profile, and were theoretically modeled as such.

Relatively high-risk technologies are being accepted for such missions if they meet these guidelines.

This consists of 96 percent carbon dioxide, which can be processed into oxygen and carbon monoxide. This year, the NASA Lewis Research Center completed the experimental evaluation and subscale technology development of an oxygen/carbon monoxide propellant combination. Previous research included ignition characterization, combustion performance, and heat transfer characterization with gaseous propellants at room temperature. In this year s tests, we studied the ignition characteristics and combustion of oxygen and carbon monoxide at near liquid temperatures. The mixture ratio boundaries for oxygen and carbon monoxide were determined as a function of propellant temperature in a spark torch igniter. With both propellants at room temperature, the <b>ignition</b> <b>range</b> was between 0. 50 and 1. 44; and with both propellants chilled to near-liquid temperatures, it was between 2. 4 and 3. 1. Statistical analysis of the mean value of the ignition boundaries provided models that describe the combination of oxygen temperature, carbon monoxide temperature, and mixture ratio that resulted in ignition. This range is the larger boxed area shown in the figure. The smaller boxed area indicates the range at which there is a 90 -percent confidence that ignition will occur.

40|$|The {{flow and}} mixing {{behaviour}} of high pressure directly injected fuel {{is important in}} the study of spark-ignition engines owing to its strong influence on the combustion process. This in turn governs emissions and power generation, which are important considerations in contemporary vehicle design. Whilst liquid fuel delivery has and continues to be a topic of detailed research, there is a deficit in the understanding of gaseous fuel delivery. Three topics remain largely neglected for high pressure CNG fuel injection in spark-ignition engines: i. the targeting and dispersion behaviour of the gaseous fuel jet, ii. the transient jet behaviour near the nozzle exit region (&ldquo;nearfield&rdquo;) and iii. the effects of the jets on the in-cylinder flow and turbulence. Using optical diagnostics that include schlieren high-speed imaging and particle image velocimetry (PIV), this work addresses the knowledge deficit. The investigation primarily covers jets issued from a direct injector for gaseous fuels that was constructed in-house. A constant volume chamber was employed to replicate engine-like conditions quiescently, allowing isolation of the injection delivery phenomena. For topic i, jet targeting behaviour was characterised by axial and radial penetration, spread angle and projected area. The targeting profile of a freestream jet is in good agreement with previously established density normalised incompressible jet relationhips. Additionally, empirical correlation is provided between the jet dispersion and pressure ratio (8. 3 &lt; PR &lt; 400) for conditions when the jet impinges on the cylinder boundaries. For topic ii, the injector needle lift profile was found to be a dominant factor in controlling nearfield compressible and incompressible flow structures. The presence of the needle was shown to reduce the Mach disc location downstream of the nozzle by ~ 45 %, at steady-state conditions. Moreover, in transient conditions the Mach disc location and diameter are shown to correlate strongly with the needle lift profile. The high-resolution characterisation of the compressible is important for stratified engine operation where a slightly mistimed jet may result in misfire due to the large velocities across the spark-plug electrode In relation to topic iii, PIV was used to capture the flow velocity in two key regions: the air in the nearfield and the ignition zone where a spark plug would be conventionally placed. The rate of air entrainment into the jet is shown to be proportional to the fuel delivery rate and to steadily increase with increasing delivery time aSOI. Spatially, the nearfield entrainment coefficient, K&rsquo; 2, is shown to remain constant at a mean value of K&rsquo; 2 = 0. 123. Moreover, the displacement of air caused from the impinging induced jet vortices is shown to feed air into the nearfield entrainment region. Consequently, for the highest PR experiments (PR 320 and 400) the nearfield entrainment coefficient, K&rsquo; 2, is shown to increase ~ 65 %, relative to the lower PR experiments. Ignition region turbulent kinetic energy levels induced by the impinging jet are conducive to good flame propagation where mean values (0. 5 - 19 m 2 /s 2) are similar to those created by typical air induction bulk-flow. Mean flow velocities are also within an acceptable spark plug <b>ignition</b> <b>range</b> (1. 8 - 21. 0 m/s). Both flow properties are shown to be heavily influenced by the proximity of the jet boundary. As a result of the ignition and nearfield region measurements, a clear understanding of the transient nearfield processes has been developed to help one design appropriate fuel delivery and combustion strategies...|$|E

The recent evidence of this harmful chemical attack is the Middle Ring Road 2 (MRR 2) incidence in Kuala Lumpur. The remedial action to sulphate attack is normally to remove all the defective concrete and contaminated hardcore and replace them which is a disruptive and costly process.

In the state of Georgia, as {{in much of the}} United States, unauthorized fires are officially classified as “incendiary wildfire,” a type of arson subject to legal prosecution as a criminal felony. While the legality of the fire is encoded in the term “incendiary,” causality with respect to human decision making remains ambiguous. Indeed, beyond anecdotal evidence, the destructive intent or general malfeasance of unauthorized firesetting remains unsubstantiated in either social or ecological research. I explored 24 years of unauthorized firesetting in Georgia with the objective of characterizing the phenomenon as a socioecological disturbance. Because unauthorized fires are caused by individuals whose firesetting success is tied to conditions at the specific time and place of <b>ignition,</b> the <b>range</b> of spatiotemporal variability of such fires may be understood as the range of conditions that enable “successful” firesetting. From a socioecological perspective (Coughlan and Petty 2012), ignitions, as intentional acts, represent the outcome of firesetter decision processes. Consequently, spatiotemporal patterns of unauthorized fire provide information about the social and ecological preferences and constraints for unauthorized firesetting.|$|R
40|$|Homogeneous charge {{compression}} ignition offers {{the possibility to}} reduce the fuel consumption of gasoline passenger car engines. However, the combustion strategy is limited to low loads due to pressure oscillations at higher loads. A strategy for extending the homogeneous charge compression <b>ignition</b> load <b>range</b> is charge stratification, using, for example, late direct injection to prolong the combustion duration and reduce the rate of pressure rises and pressure oscillations. In this study, local temperatures and fuel concentrations near top dead centre in a gasoline engine operating in homogeneous charge {{compression ignition}} mode were measured using two-wavelength planar laser-induced fluorescence, and the following combustion was analysed using high-speed video to investigate the effects of fuel and temperature stratification on combustion in order to explain the ringing inhibiting effect of charge stratification for fuels displaying single-stage ignition. The extent of spatial distribution of combustion timing correlated well with the extent of fuel and temperature stratification. Furthermore, the gas was leaner and hotter in early igniting regions, while it was richer and colder in late igniting regions. The dampening effects of charge stratification on the combustion speed and pressure oscillations are probably due to rich conditions in the latest burning regions (where combustion is usually most intense) slowing down combustion, which explains why the strategy only works when the global air-to-fuel ratio is not excessively lean...|$|R

Many of the flames soon became unstable, with an accelerating flame speed, due to Darrieus-Landau and thermodiffusive instabilities. This effect increased with pressure. The flame wrinkling arising from the instabilities enhanced the flame speed. A method is described for allowing for this effect, based on measurements of the flame radii at which the instabilities increased the flame speed. This enabled ul and Masr to be obtained, devoid {{of the effects of}} instabilities. With increasing pressure, the time interval between the end of the ignition spark and the onset of flame instability, during which stable stretched flame propagation occurred, became increasingly small and very high camera speeds were necessary for accurate measurement.

The definitive version is available at: [URL] hydrogen to the fuel in a direct injection natural gas engine offers the potential significantly to reduce local and global air pollutant emissions. This work reports on the effects of fuelling a heavy-duty engine with late-cycle direct injection of blended hydrogen– methane fuels and diesel pilot <b>ignition</b> over a <b>range</b> of engine operating conditions. The effect of hydrogen on the combustion event varies with operating condition, providing insight into the fundamental factors limiting the combustion process. Combustion stability is enhanced at all conditions studied; this leads directly to a significant reduction in emissions of combustion byproducts, including carbon monoxide, particulate matter, and unburned fuel. Carbon dioxide emissions are also significantly reduced by the lower carbon–energy ratio of the fuel. The results suggest that this technique can significantly reduce both local and global pollutant emissions associated with heavy-duty transport applications while requiring minimal changes to the fuelling system...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSuccessfully {{designing}} and making effective {{of use of}} the next generation of liquid fuels, which will be derived from a range of biomass and fossil sources, requires an understanding of the interactions between structurally similar and dissimilar fuel components when utilised in current engine technology. Interactions between fuel components can influence the release of energy and production of harmful emissions in compression ignition combustion through determination of the autoignition behavior of the fuel. This paper presents experimental studies carried out in a single-cylinder engine supplied with a range of binary mixture fuels to investigate the effect of fuel component interactions on autoignition in direct injection compression <b>ignition.</b> A <b>range</b> of binary mixtures consisting of toluene and n-heptane and also 1 -octene and n-octane were tested so as to observe respectively the effect of an aromatic compound and an alkene on n-alkane combustion and emissions. The engine tests were carried out at constant injection timing and they were repeated at constant ignition timing and at constant ignition delay, the latter being achieved through the addition to the various fuels of small quantities of ignition improver (2 -ethylhexyl nitrate). Increasing the presence of toluene in the toluene/n-heptane binary mixtures resulted in an increased ignition delay time and generated a distinct two stage ignition process. An increased level of 1 -octene in the binary mixtures of 1 -octene/n-octane was also found to increase ignition delay, though to a much lesser extent than toluene {{in the case of the}} toluene/n-heptane mixtures. Interactions between the fuel components during the ignition delay period appear important in the case of the toluene/n-heptane mixtures but not those of 1 -octene/n-octane. At constant injection and constant ignition timings, the combustion phasing and the level of emissions produced by each binary mixture were primarily driven by the ignition delay time. With ignition delay equalised, an effect of adiabatic flame temperature on NOx production was visible...|$|R
40|$|Seasonal {{and spatial}} changes in seston, (POC), {{particulate}} organic carbon, (PON) particulate organic nitrogen and chlorophyll-a concentrations were studied {{on a monthly}} basis in a Mediterranean shallow coastal area (Stagnone di Marsala, Western Sicily) in order to gather information on factors controlling particulate organic matter distribution and composition. Seston concentration and composition were connected to the main physicochemical and biological driving factors, such as temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, wind-speed and biomass of submerged vegetation. The Stagnone di Marsala is characterized by high temperatures with strong seasonality (range: 11 - 28 °C), while values ranged from 33 to 45 salinity. Total suspended organic matter concentrations (by <b>ignition</b> loss) <b>ranged</b> from 2 mg l- 1 (in summer) to 12 mg l- 1 (in winter) and chlorophyll-a concentrations from 0. 02 to 2 μmg l- 1. Despite a low POC/PON ratios (ranging from 5 to 11), the ratio of POC to chlorophyll (CHL-a) displayed very high values (annual average of 647). The data reported in this study, highlighting the oligotrophy of the Stagnone di Marsala area, indicate that the trophic state of the basin was controlled by different degrees of wind exposure (mean monthly wind velocity at exposed sites ranged between 4. 2 and 6. 7 m s- 1) and by gradients in vegetation cover. These two factors induced clear changes in the concentration and composition of the suspended particles, but played a different role in exposed and sheltered areas. Exposed areas with limited vegetation were characterized by large resuspension processes and wide temperature and salinity fluctuations caused by wind induced turbulence. In these areas, autotrophic biomass (as chlorophyll-a), due to phytoplankton and/or re-suspended microphytobenthos, appeared {{to play an important role}} in enhancing the quality of the organic particles. By contrast, in sheltered areas which were characterized by large amounts of plant detritus, the autotrophic biomass (mostly phytoplankton) was almost negligible and the availability of the suspended organic particles to consumers appeared to be dependent largely upon the bacterial ageing of vascular organic detritus...|$|R
40|$|Some {{surprising}} {{effects are}} seen in studying numerically {{the evolution of a}} propagating pulse of pressure in a medium reacting via a one-step exothermic Arrhenius reaction. The length and amplitude of the pulse are taken to be large enough for steepening effects to be important and for enhanced reaction to lead to a substantial reduction in ignition time. The evolution proceeds through a repeated sequence of similar stages involving: shock-formation and growth, ignition behind the shock, and the generation of another propagating pressure pulse. Substantial unsteady behavior is seen to be engendered by the entropy released through shock formation. A number of unsteady reignitions are seen to culminate in a pressure-peak, substantially higher than the von Neumann spike of a Chapman-Jouget wave, during the formation of a transient overdriven detonation; this decays subsequently towards a Chapman-Jouget state. It is conjectured that this sort of evolution may well be generic to <b>ignition</b> via a <b>range</b> of pressure-pulses in state-sensitive systems. A saturation of, or relative reduction in, the reaction’s thermal sensitivity ultimately prevents the reignition process after shock-formation from happening quickly enough to continue its repetition. As such, the behavior should be strongly dependent {{on the nature of the}} chemical model and is likely to be modified significantly by changes in the chemical mechanism...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel tabulation {{strategy for the}} adaptive numerical integration of chemical kinetics using the computational singular perturbation (CSP) method. The strategy stores and reuses CSP quantities required to filter out fast dissipative processes, resulting in a non-stiff chemical source term. In particular, non-parametric regression on low-dimensional slow invariant manifolds (SIMs) in the chemical state space is used to approximate the CSP vectors spanning the fast chemical subspace and the associated fast chemical time-scales. The relevant manifold and its dimension varies depending on the local number of exhausted modes at every location in the chemical state space. Multiple manifolds are therefore tabulated, corresponding to different numbers of exhausted modes (dimensions) and associated radical species. Non-parametric representations are inherently adaptive, and rely on efficient approximate-nearest-neighbor queries. As the CSP information is only {{a function of the}} non-radical species in the system and has relatively small gradients in the chemical state space, tabulation occurs in a lower-dimensional state space and at a relatively coarse level, thereby improving scalability to larger chemical mechanisms. The approach is demonstrated on the simulation of homogeneous constant pressure H 2 -air and CH 4 -air <b>ignition,</b> over a <b>range</b> of initial conditions. For CH 4 -air, results are shown that outperform direct implicit integration of the stiff chemical kinetics while maintaining good accuracy. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of physical parameters and of flow {{patterns on the}} prediction of n-heptane ignition dynamic in transient reacting n-heptane jets, in high pressure environment under laminar conditions, has been explored by using different kinetic mechanisms. Some preliminary transient laminar flamelet computations have been performed, thus showing that {{the sensitivity of the}} ignition time to strain rate depends on the kinetic mechanism used. Therefore, the structure of the reacting jet, in particular the localization of ignition spots, is investigated. The results show that, if the initial temperature of the reacting mixture is out of the intermediate range (800 – 1000 K) towards lower values, the fluid dynamics has an essential role. In this case, the ignition delay time is almost insensitive to the specific kinetic mechanism adopted, conversely it is severely shortened by increasing the streamwise velocity. The burning spot is located in the core of fuel roll-up, where low values of scalar dissipation rate occur. Nevertheless, the most reactive mixture fraction conditions are well predicted by chemical kinetics, as they are in good agreement with those computed for the one-dimensional diffusion layer. When the initial temperature of fuel and air is increased in the intermediate <b>range,</b> <b>ignition</b> is strongly dependent on the kinetic mechanism used. In these cases, the choice of an accurate chemical scheme is fundamental in order to obtain reliable results...|$|R
40|$|The main {{challenge}} for the wide spread use of hydrogen in fuel cell systems is the safety concerns due to its ease of leaking, low-energy <b>ignition,</b> large flammability <b>range,</b> high buoyancy and diffusion rate in air. To alleviate concern of explosion during experiments, scientists are using helium as a stimulant for hydrogen safety studies. However, the equivalent behavior between the two gases only relies on numerical or experimental results, and the similarity is not connected by a theoretical correlation. This thesis assesses similarity relations using helium for hydrogen studies and develops a theoretical helium plume model. Meanwhile, {{a case study of}} leakage in fuel cell vehicles is simulated by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The accuracy of three different correlations, i. e., equal volumetric flow rate, equal buoyancy and equal concentration between helium and hydrogen was compared by CFD simulations validated by helium experiment in a 1 / 4 sub-scale residential garage model. The accuracy of these different methods at different leakage rate, stage of release, ventilation method and location was discussed. An updated theoretical helium plume model was validated by PIV (Particle Image Velocimetry) experiment and CFD. It is found that the new model could be used in estimating the plume size and velocity. In the case study of hydrogen leakage inside a FCV (Fuel Cell Vehicle), ventilation and sunroof show critical effect to reduce the level of hydrogen concentration accumulation...|$|R

Climate change {{and its effects on}} nature, ecology, forest stand structure and composition, global changes according to demands of society and general trends in the provision of ecosystem services are potentially going to {{have a significant effect on}} fire ignition in the future. This makes the prediction of forest fire ignition essential for forest managers in order to establish an effective fire prevention system and to allocate fire fighting resources effectively, especially in alpine landscapes. This paper presents a modelling approach for predicting human-caused forest fire <b>ignition</b> by a <b>range</b> of socio-economic factors associated with an increasing forest fire danger in Austria. The relationship between touristic activities, infrastructure, agriculture and forestry and the spatial occurrence of forest fires have been studied over a 17 -year period between 1993 and 2009 by means of logistic regression. 59 independent socio-economic variables have been analysed with different models and validated with heterogeneous subsets of forest fire records. The variables included in the final model indicate that railroad, forest road and hiking trail density together with agricultural and forestry developments may contribute significantly to fire danger. The final model explains 60. 5 % of the causes of the fire events in the validation set and allows a solid prediction. Maps showing the fire danger classification allow identifying the most vulnerable forest areas in Austria and are used to predict the fire danger classes on municipality level...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPyrolysis is the {{thermochemical}} process {{that leads to}} the ignition of a solid fuel and a key mechanism in flame spread and fire growth. Because polymeric materials are flammable and ubiquitous in the modern environment, the understanding of polymer pyrolysis is thus essential to tackle accidental fires. In this paper, we used transient irradiation as an external source of heat to study the process of pyrolysis and ignition of a polymer. While previous ignition studies use constant irradiation, transient irradiation is the most frequent condition found in accidental fires, but it lacks a theoretical framework since it has been ignored in the literature. Moreover, transient irradiation is a more comprehensive case for the understanding of pyrolysis where nonlinear heat transfer effects challenge the validity of solid-phase criteria for piloted ignition developed previously. We propose here that transient irradiation is the general problem to solid fuel ignition of which constant irradiation is a particular case. In order to investigate how this novel heat source influences polymer pyrolysis and flammability, numerical simulations and experiments have been conducted on poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) samples 100  mm by 100  mm and 30  mm deep exposed to a range of parabolic pulses of irradiation. The 1 D model, coded in GPyro, uses heat and mass transfer and single-step heterogeneous chemistry, with temperature dependent properties. The predictions are compared to experiments conducted in the cone calorimeter for the constant irradiation and the Fire Propagation Apparatus for transient irradiation. The experiments validate the temperature predictions of the model and also provide the time to ignition. The model then complements the experiments by calculating the mass loss rate. A series of 16 parabolic pulses (including repeats) are investigated with a range of peak irradiation from 25 to 45 kW/m 2, while the time to peak ranges from 280 to 480  s. For these pulses, the time to <b>ignition</b> measurements <b>range</b> from 300 to 483  s. The model can predict the in-depth temperature profiles with an average error lower than 9 %. Model and experiments are then combined to study the validity of the solid-phase criteria for flaming ignition found in the literature, namely critical temperature, critical mass loss rate, critical energy and critical time-energy squared. We find that of these criteria, the best predictions are provided by the critical mass loss rate followed by the critical temperature, and the worst is the critical energy. Further analysis reveals the novel concept of simultaneous threshold values. While the mass loss rate is below 3  g/m 2 and the surface temperature is below 305  °C, ignition does not occur. Therefore these threshold values when exceeded simultaneously establish the earliest time possible for ignition...|$|R
40|$|The {{existence}} of flammable aerosols creates fire and explosion hazards {{in the process}} industry. Due to the operation condition of high pressure circumstances, heat transfer fluids tend to form aerosols when accidental leaking occurs on pipelines or storage vessels. An aerosol system is a complicated reactive system; there are neither systematic flammability data similar to the case with pure gases, nor clearly described ignition-to-combustion process of a droplet-air mixture system. The flammable regions of three main, widely-used commercial heat transfer fluids: Paratherm NF (P-NF); Dowtherm- 600 (D- 600); and Plate Heat Exchange Fluid (PHE), were analyzed by electro-spray generation with laser diffraction particle analysis method. The aerosol ignition behavior depends on the droplet size and concentration of the aerosol. From the adjustment of differently applied electro-spray voltages (7 - 10 kV) and various liquid feeding rates, a flammable condition distribution was obtained by comparison of droplet size and concentration. All of the fundamental study results are {{to be applied to}} practical cases with fire hazards analysis, pressurized liquid handling, and mitigation system design once there is a better understanding of aerosols formed by high-flash point materials. On the other hand, the process of combustion from initial stage to global flame formation was simulated with COMSOL-multi-physics in terms of heat transfer, droplet evaporation, and fluid dynamics of liquid-air interaction. The local temperature change through time, as an indicator of luminous flame appearance, was analyzed to describe the flame development and ignition delay time of aerosols. We have conducted a series of simulation regarding physical formula in description of this combustion process, and will conclude with how temperature distribution influenced the appearance of luminous flames, which was the symbol of successful ignition of aerosol. The mitigation implementing timing and location can be characterized with further understanding of this combustion process. The potential application of the ignition delay will be beneficial to the mitigation timing and detector sensor setting of facilities to prevent aerosol cloud fires. Finally, the scientific method of aerosol flammability study was discussed for its potential impacts on experimental results. A modeling point of view was introduced, with the analysis of electric field application on fuel droplets, and the related fundamental study of the ignition phenomenon on aerosol system. Existing charges from electrospray is beneficial for the monodispersity and control of aerosols for fundamental study. However, the additional charges accumulated on the droplet surfaces are likely to have impacts on flammability due to the excess energy they applied to the aerosols system and droplet-droplet distraction or turbulences. This is a re-visit of aerosol flammability study method, with a conclusion that charges did have positive impact on droplets? <b>ignition</b> concentration <b>range</b> with a balancing effect on turbulence increase to reduce the ignition chance...|$|R
