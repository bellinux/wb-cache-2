40|$|To isolate {{precision}} machines {{from floor}} vibrations, active vibration isolators are often applied. In this paper, a two-sensor control strategy, based on acceleration feedback and force feedback, is proposed for an active vibration isolator using a single-axis active <b>hard</b> <b>mount.</b> The <b>hard</b> <b>mount</b> provides a stiff support while an active control system {{is used to}} get the desired isolation performance. In our previous work, we showed that a sensor fusion control strategy for active hard mounts {{can be used to}} realize three performance objectives simultaneously: providing isolation from floor vibrations, achieving a low sensitivity for direct disturbance forces, and adding damping to internal modes of the supported precision machine. In the present work, an enhanced control strategy is presented, referred to as two-sensor control. We will show that two-sensor control outperforms sensor fusion, because it has more possibilities for loop-shaping and has better stability properties. The two-sensor control strategy is successfully validated on an experimental setu...|$|E
40|$|Floor {{vibrations}} and {{acoustic excitation}} may limit {{the performance of}} precision equipment, that is used for example to produce computer chips or to make images of very tiny structures. Therefore, {{it is common to}} mount a vibration isolator in the suspension of such equipment to isolate it from these vibration sources. Most often, a vibration isolator with a low suspension stiffness is used to limit the transmission of floor vibrations onto the suspended equipment. However, a low suspension stiffness introduces problems with leveling of the equipment and it increases its susceptibility to acoustic excitation. The objective of this thesis is to develop an alternative solution based on an active <b>hard</b> <b>mount</b> vibration isolator, which provides a much stiffer suspension such that the problems mentioned before can be circumvented. An active control system, that consists of sensors, actuators and a controller, is used to keep a low transmission of floor vibrations. An additional advantage is that the damping of internal modes of the equipment can be increased, such that its accuracy is improved. Several feedback control strategies for the active <b>hard</b> <b>mount</b> vibration isolator are presented. In both models and experiments it is shown that the best control strategy is using a combination of acceleration and force sensors. Formulas for adjusting the control parameters to obtain the desired vibration isolation performance have been derived. Furthermore, a demonstration setup of a six-axes active <b>hard</b> <b>mount</b> vibration isolator is developed. Unfortunately, due to some hardware problems, the usable control bandwidth is limited and the noise level of the sensors is too high, which results in a vibration isolation performance that is less than desired. Despite these problems, the transmission of floor vibrations is reduced by a factor 18, while simultaneously the suspension stiffness is about 100 times higher as compared to a vibration isolator with a low suspension stiffness. In addition, the damping of the internal modes is increased significantly. Further research should focus on improving the mechanical design of the active <b>hard</b> <b>mount</b> vibration isolator, such that the control bandwidth can be increased, and on using sensors with ultra-low noise levels...|$|E
40|$|Sensor fusion is a {{promising}} control strategy {{to improve the}} performance of active vibration isolation systems {{that are used in}} precision equipment. Normally, those vibration isolation systems are only capable of realizing a low transmissibility. Additional objectives are to increase the damping ratio of internal vibration modes and to provide a high support stiffness. It is shown that these three objectives cannot be realized simultaneously if only acceleration or force feedback is used. An active <b>hard</b> <b>mount</b> suspension with a feedback strategy based on sensor fusion is proposed that uses the acceleration signal at low frequencies and the force signal at high frequencies. Using sensor fusion, the three objectives can be achieved simultaneously. Experiments on a single-axis setup show that this feedback strategy provides an excellent performance...|$|E

40|$|A common {{challenge}} in developing small-satellite-based Earth-observation (EO) missions {{is getting the}} data to the ground. Typically, most satellites download data via space-to-ground radio-frequency (RF) links, communicating directly with fixed ground stations as the satellites fly within range. For many next-generation EO missions, such as hyperspectral imaging or SAR missions, the volume of data generated {{is large enough to}} tax most conventional RF downlink systems. An alternative approach to the problem is to develop a network of small optical relay satellites in LEO that allow for short range optical or RF communication from EO satellites to the network. The LEO network satellites then relay the data around the Earth to a network satellite in view of an optical ground station. Implementing such a system requires the development of both optical downlinks and optical crosslinks for small, preferably CubeSat-scale satellite. The key {{challenge in}} implementing a high-rate optical communication system is the pointing and tracking of the laser beam. Most free-space laser communication systems incorporate a complex two-axis gimbal to control beam pointing. An alternative approach is to <b>hard</b> <b>mount</b> the laser transmitter to the satellite body and point the laser solely with the attitude control system of the spacecraft. For real-time communications through a constellation, a means will be necessary to allow each node to point simultaneously at both the source and destination. This paper describes two alternatives to the two-axis gimbal for this application. In one approach, beam steering is accomplished with a single-axis gimbal, combined with rotation of the satellite about the receive axis. In the other solution, requiring no gimbals at all, the node consists of two satellites flying in close proximity, with one satellite acting as the receiver and the other as a transmitter, and with a short-range omnidirectional link between them...|$|E

40|$|In the Compact LInear Collider (CLIC) {{currently}} under study, electrons and positrons will be accelerated in two linear accelerators to collide at the interaction point with an energy of 0. 5 - 3 TeV. This machine is constituted of {{a succession of}} accelerating structures, used to accelerate the beams of particles, and electromagnets (quadrupoles) used to focus the beams. In order to ensure good performances, the quadrupoles have to be extremely stable. Additionally, they should also {{have the capability to}} move by steps of some tens of nanometers every 20 ms with a precision of +/- 1 nm. This paper proposes a holistic approach to fulfill alternatively both requirements using the same device. The concept is based on piezoelectric <b>hard</b> <b>mounts</b> to isolate the quadrupoles from the ground vibrations in the sensitive range between 1 and 20 Hz, and to provide nano-positioning capabilities. It is also shown that this strategy ensures robustness to external forces (acoustic noise, water flow for the cooling, air flow for the ventilation) directly acting on the quadrupoles. In the first part, the strategy adopted is presented, and its advantages compared to other stabilization strategies are discussed. In the second part, experimental validations are presented on two test benches. Both set-ups consist of a compact mass, supported by piezoelectric <b>hard</b> <b>mounts.</b> Isolation and nano-positioning performances are presented, and specific issues of sensor noise and resolution are addressed...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a benchmark to assess performance of six-axis vibration isolation systems. The targeted application, spaceborne interferometers, require {{isolation of the}} reaction wheel disturbances in order to stabilize the precision optical elements to the required levels. The problem is to isolate this vibrating payload from the quiet structure (spacecraft). The unique feature of this procedure is that isolator performance is {{measured in terms of}} the stabilities of the interferometer optical elements. Central to the procedure is the Micro-Precision Interferometer (MPI) testbed which is a hardware model of a future spaceborne optical interferometer. The isolation system under evaluation is mounted on the testbed and disturbance transfer functions are then measured from the isolator payload to the optical sensor output that must be stabilized. Off-line, the procedure combines these measured testbed tranfer functions with an empirical model of the reaction wheel disturbance, in order predict isolator performance over the entire range of wheel speeds. The paper applies the procedure to four different disturbance interface conditions: <b>hard</b> <b>mounted,</b> passive hexapod isolator, active hexapod isolator and a passive elastomeric isolator. The paper contains all the necessary information to allow industry, academia or other organizations to evaluate custom designs in this testbed facility...|$|R
5000|$|The Twin Cam {{initially}} {{was not used}} in the Softail model family before the year 2000. This {{was due to the}} chassis design and vibration transfer to the Softail frame {{as a result of the}} direct (<b>hard)</b> <b>mounting</b> of the engine. Dyna models are [...] "rubber mounted", damping the majority of vibration transfer to the frame and rider. Another reason was that the engine and transmission on a Twin Cam are directly bolted (but are still separate units) to each other, with the chassis seat post on a Softail getting in the way of a Twin Cam transmission case. As the company determined that a rubber-mounted Softail would affect the line's visual styling, Harley solved the issue by designing an engine variant known as Twin Cam 88B. It is basically the same engine as the original (now called [...] "Twin Cam 88A"), but with a modified engine block design that incorporates twin chain-driven balance shafts. The Twin Cam 96B engine was released at the same time as the Twin Cam 96A model, for the 2007 model year, and was equipped on all Softail models until it was replaced by the 103 ci version.|$|R

40|$|A 46 MW 5500 rpm {{multistage}} single casing {{utility steam}} turbine experienced strong sub-synchronous rotordynamic vibration {{of the first}} rotor mode; preventing full load opera-tion of the unit. The root cause of the vibration stemmed from steam whirl forces generated at secondary sealing locations in combination with a flexible rotor-bearing system. Several {{attempts were made to}} eliminate the subsynchronous vibration by modify-ing bearing geometry and clearances, which came short of enabling full load operation. The following paper presents experimental tests and analytical results focused on stabi-lizing a 46 MW 6230 kg utility steam turbine experiencing subsynchronous rotordynamic instability. The paper advances an integral squeeze film damper (ISFD) solution, which was implemented to resolve the subsynchronous vibration and allow full load and full speed operation of the machine. The present work addresses the bearing-damper analy-sis, rotordynamic analysis, and experimental validation through waterfall plots, and syn-chronous vibration data of the steam turbine rotor. Analytical and experimental results show that using ISFD improved the stability margin by a factor of 12 eliminating the sub-synchronous instability and significantly reducing critical speed amplification factors. Additionally, by using ISFD the analysis showed significant reduction in interstage clear-ance closures during critical speed transitions in comparison to the <b>hard</b> <b>mounted</b> tilting pad bearing configuration.
