50|$|The <b>juniper</b> <b>carpet</b> (Thera juniperata) is a moth of {{the family}} Geometridae. It is found {{throughout}} Europe and the Near East, but is rather uncommon and locally distributed, mainly due to its very specific larval food plant.|$|E
50|$|Juniper is the {{exclusive}} food plant of the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Bucculatrix inusitata and <b>juniper</b> <b>carpet,</b> {{and is also}} eaten by the larvae of other Lepidoptera species such as Chionodes electella, Chionodes viduella, juniper pug and pine beauty; those of the tortrix moth C. duplicana feed on the bark around injuries or canker.|$|E
50|$|In the Rif, Middle and High Atlas Mountains, {{there exist}} several {{different}} types of climates: Mediterranean along the coastal lowlands, giving way to a humid temperate climate at higher elevations with sufficient moisture {{to allow for the}} growth of different species of oaks, moss <b>carpets,</b> <b>junipers,</b> and Atlantic fir which is a royal conifer tree endemic to Morocco. In the valleys, fertile soils and high precipitation allow for the growth of thick and lush forests. Cloud forests {{can be found in the}} west of the Rif Mountains and Middle Atlas Mountains. At higher elevations, the climate becomes alpine in character, and can sustain ski resorts.|$|R
