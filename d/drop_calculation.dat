50|$|Traditional {{control valve}} sizing for {{constant}} flow systems involves a Kv calculation, actual pressure <b>drop</b> <b>calculation</b> and {{a check to}} ensure minimum valve authority is met. This method is complicated and inflexible, as the changes in design flow, circuit pressure, and required pressure drops can change the required valve, and reduce control-ability. This method also relies on having the correct design information. Pressure independent control valves are used to limit the flow to the fan coil terminal and air handling unit. This flow is not affected by changes in inlet pressure. A diaphragm within the valve keeps the outlet pressure constant, and this delivers a constant flow to the terminal. The added advantage of pressure independent control valves is that, when fitted with an actuator, they replace the manual balancing valve and motorized control valve with a single valve, thus reducing installation cost.|$|E

In this project, {{a model of the}} VLA considering both heat transfer and pressure drops has been developed in order to obtain a reliable model of how the heat exchanger behaves when using non-Newtonian uids so it can further be used for commercial purposes within Alfa Laval AB. In parallel, tests on the VLA heat exchanger using the available uids; water and oil which are Newtonian uids, have been carried out to prove the validity of the elaborated code.

The calculations are done with a model for pressure drop in pipe systems, given in a calculation instruction for pipe friction losses for pulp.

Compared to literature data, the model seems to give somewhat high pressure drop for TMP suspensions. There is a lack of experimental data for mechanical pulps and studied graphs date back to the 1970 's. Measured values from the TMP plant are tested versus theoretical pressure and power of the current pumps. A good agreement between measured and theoretical values is noticed. A reduction in power consumption of 150 kW seems very realistic by minimizing the pressure reduction over the control valves and with the installation of speed controlled pumps in studied system. This corresponds to 44 % of today’s power consumption. All studied pumps show clear saving potential, although the required pressure is overestimated.

In industry,natural gas is used as an input to manufacture pulp and paper, metals,chemicals, stone, clay,glass,and to process certain foods. Natural gas is also used to treat waste materials,for incineration, drying, dehumidification, heating and cooling,and cogeneration. The major transportation of natural gas is carried through pipelines. High demand for natural gas primarily to the customers who live in big cities around the world. This also happens in major cities in Malaysia. Gas transport networks around Shah Alam present a large set of highly integrated pipe networks operating over a wide range of pressures.

An important parameter for characterizing {{the energy of the}} fluid flowing within a contained system, such as pipes, is pressure. This pressure becomes important for designing pipe sizes, determining pump requirements, and addressing safety concerns. Often the fluid is flowing as both liquid and gas. Flow Type The flow type of two-phase liquid-gas flow can be characterized into one of seven types shown in Figure 1. These types could be predicted using the following process parameters: Gas density ratio ρ (gas ratio) = ρ (gas) / ρ (air) Liquid density ratio ρ (liquid ratio) = ρ (liquid) / ρ (water) Viscosity ratio µ (ratio) = µ (liquid) / µ (water) Surface tension ratio σ (ratio) = σ (liquid) / σ (water) Mass Flux MF (liquid or gas) = F(liquid or gas) / (3600 *AR) To determine which type of flow exists, use the following coefficients in Figure 1, which is a flow-pattern plot.

Fifty-six percent of these systems had air flows between 40 and 90 cfin.

40|$|At {{designing}} {{pipeline transport}} of granulated solid materials, {{one of the}} most important parameter is the pressure loss over a given length of pipe. The pressure loss determines the applicable pump as well as the main portion of the operational costs. In the practice the transported solids can be characterized by size, density and shape distributions. Still many of the existing great number of pressure <b>drop</b> <b>calculation</b> methods describe mono-disperse solids. When solids are transported in horizontal pipelines by steady-state slurry flow, the most complicated case of interest of calculating the head loss is the flow of smaller flow rates (sliding bed flow may occur because operating the system close to the minimum point means low energy cost) of slurries with well granulated real solid material. The aim of this paper is to cope with this problem. THE EFFECT OF PARTICLE SIZE The most important parameter of a solid granular material system is the particle size in respect of the type of the two-phase flow. The effect of the particle size can be examined if all the other parameters are kept constant, only the size of mono-disperse solid fractions is changed and examined systematically. The Department of Process Engineering of the University of Miskolc, Hungary carried out two experimental series with power plant fly-ash and glass sand [8, 9, 10]. During the experiments narrow particle fractions were sieved and tested in a tube viscometer with three different pipes. The effect of the particle size can be summarized by the following figure: In Fig. 1 typical pressure drop curves are shown for two different particle sizes. The transport concentration and the pipe and all the other parameters are the same in both cases. In the case of small particles (2) the pressure loss curve is similar to the one of clear fluids. This kind of slurry flow was called as fine suspension flow [7]. In this case the solid-liquid mixture behaves like a clear fluid with its own density and rheological properties in the given pipe.
