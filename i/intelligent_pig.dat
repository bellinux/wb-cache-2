For several decades, many industries have applied <b>intelligent</b> <b>pigging</b> technology to inspect pipelines ranging from 4 ” to 52 ” diameter.

The pipeline was commissioned in 1994 and a metal loss inspection with an <b>intelligent</b> <b>pig</b> was successfully completed in 1997. Video inspections {{of the pipeline}} conducted in recent years indicated a significant deposition of scale in the topside and riser pipework at the Dunbar platform. Initial attempts to assess {{the extent of the}} scale build-up in the risers and pipeline were only partially successful, and by the summer of 2003 the deposition was estimated to have restricted the remaining internal diameter {{at the top of the}} riser to less than 10 ”. By late 2003 TOTAL required that a further metal loss inspection be conducted in 2004. To enable an <b>intelligent</b> <b>pig</b> inspection of the pipeline, it was necessary that it be cleaned of scale. To enable the formulation of a cleaning methodology that minimised the risk of blocking the pipeline during cleaning, it was critical that further details be established as to the quantity and distribution of the scale within the pipeline. Following a review of available inspection techniques, TOTAL contracted Weatherford’s Pipeline & Specialty Services (P&SS) to develop a multi-diameter, multi-channel caliper pig for the Dunbar pipeline. Weatherford P&SS provide pipeline inspection services to the international oil and gas industry with their SAAM ® smart utility pig and range of caliper tools.

If well constructed, carefully monitored and properly maintained, pipelines can be a safe and environmentally/economically sound means of transport; however, pipeline integrity is a growing and challenging problem for oil companies {{since the age of}} components is increasing and the responsibility and awareness about environmental protection is increasing too. Procedures and practices to monitor pipeline integrity are an important challenge for operators. Internal corrosion {{is one of the most}} active and dangerous damage mechanisms. In the frame of a research project the attempt was made to apply well known models in different sections of a long pipeline, with the objective of obtaining, coupled with flow dynamics properties of the transported fluid, a ranking of corrosion risks along the pipe. Other studies have shown that long term effects on mechanical properties of pipeline steel can be observed in presence of internal corrosion. The results of such studies need an effort towards application, to understand their capability of giving a measure of pipeline integrity. The application to the case of Meleiha-El Hamra pipeline (Agiba Pet.

40|$|Abstract—More than 3 million {{kilometers}} of high pressure liquid and gas pipelines are installed {{all over the}} world. Usually steel is the safest means to transport large quantities of oil and oil related products and natural gas however, {{just like any other}} technical component, pipelines also deteriorate with time, result of which, flaws appear and they grows until the pipeline fails. That is why Pipeline operators worldwide maintain the good health of buried cross-country pipelines with a combination of good quality external coating and cathodic protection. Beside this various other techniques like cleaning and debris removal by scrapper pigging at intervals depending upon the life of pipeline and the products being transported through the same are used. Use of corrosion inhibitors and internal coating is also done to protect the internal surface from corrosion. It is of greatest importance to ensure the safety, efficiency,environmental integrity and regulatory compliance of the worldwide pipeline infrastructure. Achieving this objective entails the need for effective inspection technologies, incorporating the accuracy and reliability required for optimized maintenance strategies. Intelligent pigs are used for inline inspection of buried pipelines to monitor their thorough health,assess the risks associated with their operation,pilferage checking and cracks etc. These IPIGS are capable of detecting metal loss upto 5 - 10 percent of wall thickness on inner as well as external surfaces of pipeline. IPIGS based on ultrasonic and eddy current sensors are capable of detecting cracks also. [10] On the basis of the wall thickness loss and the intensity of defects, pipeline risk assessment is done and preventive and corrective measures are planned.

30|$|Corrosion {{monitoring}} is {{the practice}} of measuring the corrosivity of process stream conditions {{by the use of}} probes (mechanical, electrical, or electrochemical devices) which are inserted into the process stream and continuously exposed to the process stream condition. Corrosion monitoring techniques alone provide direct and online measurement of metal loss/corrosion rate in oil and process systems [75]. One of the methods is to carry out the on-stream inspection by doing the wall thickness measurements periodically on fixed and vulnerable locations on the equipment, piping, and pipelines to assess the material conditions and corrosion rates [75]. Also, corrosion is monitored by placing electronic probes in the pipelines and by measuring the change in the electric resistance in the probe coil. The cross-country pipelines are normally checked with <b>intelligent</b> <b>pigging</b> operations like magnetic flux or ultrasonic pigs. These pigs will detect the internal conditions of the pipeline and corrosion conditions on the pipe wall thickness and also indicate the wall thickness available on the pipe wall [20].|$|R

40|$|Pipelines are {{considered}} to be the safest way for transportation of large amounts of liquid and gas over large distances. In the course of the lifetime of a pipeline, however, many effects can lead to damages affecting the integrity of the line, e. g. manufacturing-related anomalies, operationally induced anomalies or third-party damage. In order to avoid pipeline failures with potentially catastrophic consequences so-called <b>intelligent</b> <b>pigs</b> (or smart pigs) were developed during the last decades: These tools allow for the internal inspection (In-Line Inspection, ILI) of pipelines using non-destructive testing technologies for the early detection and sizing of defects. Most common are magnetic flux leakage (MFL) and ultrasonic techniques for corrosion inspection and the latter also for crack inspection. While the ultrasonic techniques offer superior sizing capabilities they are limited to the inspection of liquid pipelines where the medium itself provides the necessary coupling between the (piezoelectric) ultrasonic transducers and the pipe wall. However, this limitation can be overcome by recent developments using EMAT (Electro-Magnetic Acoustic Transducer) technology. By a special sensor design, the EMAT inspection is combined with eddy current (EC) inspection and MFL inspection at the same time. As a result, this new multi-technology approach offers improved sizing as well as enhanced feature identification for wall thickness inspection of gas pipelines...|$|R

40|$|The {{internal}} corrosion and pitting {{of water}} injection pipelines (WIP) is of {{much interest in}} {{the oil and gas}} industry. Water injection is used to aid the recovery of oil or gas from reservoirs that are nearing depletion. Most pipelines are low alloy high strength steels, many kilometres in length, not cathodically protected and placed on the seafloor. In some cases after some years service very severe internal corrosion, mainly pitting and channeling corrosion is observed, typically at the 6 o'clock position and sometimes at transverse welds. Various causes have been proposed. However, a critical issue is the depth of corrosion pitting that is likely to occur as the pipeline continues in use. Data extracted from <b>intelligent</b> <b>pigging</b> records for a number of water injection pipelines is presented. It is examined in the framework of conventional Extreme Value analysis. The data do not follow a Gumbel EV distribution as would be expected from fundamental theory and from (some, shortterm) past experience. All the pipelines considered show similar trends for departure from the ideal, theoretical Gumbel distribution.

40|$|Water {{injection}} {{or water}} flooding {{is widely used}} as a secondary recovery method to increase the production of oil usually from mature oil wells. It requires the injection of water into the reservoir, typically using carbon steel pipelines. Their corrosion is a major issue for {{the oil and gas}} industry, involving high costs of periodic chemical treatment, including biocides, oxygen scavengers, corrosion and scale inhibitors, and pipeline pigging. There is also the high potential cost of premature failure of the pipelines relative to life-time predictions, and the associated potential for unpredicted costs and major environmental implications should the pipeline fail. The present paper presents a review of a pilot study supported by the oil industry and the European Community that aimed to improve understanding of the corrosion behaviour of these pipelines. It draws on data and observations for the long-term corrosion, water quality, <b>intelligent</b> <b>pigging</b> records and microbiological testing {{to gain a better understanding}} why some pipelines suffer mild corrosion yet others, apparently similar, are prone to highly aggressive channelling corrosion. Herein the documented experience of several pipelines is reviewed. Observation data taken into consideration include pigging operation information, composition of corrosion products and their amount, corrosion rates and pipe geometry, identified biological consortia, water chemistry and process parameters. Also, the distribution of corrosion along the pipeline as well as the localization of corrosion attack is noted. Preliminary correlations between and conclusions about observed corrosion, operational conditions and service history are made.

40|$|Abstract. While data {{acquisition}} for MFL-Inspection {{is not an}} especially complex method, the off-line analysis and defect size reconstruction requires more sophisticated methods. It has been established that a full reconstruction of the flaw geometry is rarely possible. However the approaches that exist differ by the degree of reliability. The experimental side is represented here by data of <b>intelligent</b> <b>pigs</b> obtained by in-line inspection of pipelines. The problem with in-line inspection is, {{that the number of}} flaws usually does not allow for an in-depth treatment of every single item. Lengthy iterative or 3 D-FEM solutions are not practical. Methods that have earlier been developed for magnetic flux leakage have more commonly been applied to crack-like features in component testing. Sherbinin [1] has given formulas for the stray flux expected on crack-like features depending on crack opening and depth. In in-line inspection this type of flaw is rarely found due to the small crack opening of typical pipeline cracks. For corrosion-type flaws the profile of the flaw is too irregular to apply closed form formulas. In the in-line inspection industry methods have thus been established, that quickly convert characteristic signal features into measures for flaw depth, flaw length and flaw width. Deconvolution methods with a transfer function are not very common. In this work we compare the efficiency of a method based on a simple signal parameter conversion to a neural network based method. In both cases the parameters are set by actual tool measurements obtained by pulling an inspection tool through a pipe with known artificial defects. It is discussed how the methods perform when interpolating and extrapolating to flaw sizes, that are not previously tested. 1...|$|R
40|$|Reliable Non Destructive Testing (NDT) {{is vital}} to the {{integrity}} and performance management of capital assets in safety critical industries such as aerospace, transportation, pipelines, petro-chemical processing, and power generation []. The structures that are to be inspected are usually very large and located in remote and hazardous environments. The NDT system has to be deployed by first providing very expensive access, requiring the erection of scaffolding and lengthy preparation before NDT can start. In addition the system must be capable of finding and characterizing component and structural defects to a high probability of detection thereby decreasing the probability of failure. Another priority is to reduce outage time as the cost of loss of production runs into millions. This presentation describes recent developments in mobile wall climbing, swimming and pipe crawling robots that provide the means to perform NDT on difficult to access structures and provide the possibility of carrying out the NDT in-service thus preventing costly outages. In confined and hazardous environments they are the only means to reach a test site and perform the NDT.

40|$|Pipelines are {{valuable}} and essential components {{in oil and}} gas industry as means of transport. However, as corrosion attack cannot be avoided there is a high risk to have accidents due to the operating conditions. Wall thinning mainly caused as a result of corrosion can provoke fatal disasters, especially for gas pipes where the corrosion effects are superimposed by high-cycle fatigue loading due to the cyclic pumping of the compressor stations. For this reason in pipeline inspection {{it is not enough to}} know where defective areas are located, the defects should be sized as accurate as possible in order to evaluate the risk for failure by fracture mechanical approaches. Magnetic Flux Leakage (MFL) is a widely used technique by <b>intelligent</b> <b>pigs</b> (Pipeline Inspection Gauges). However, the accuracy of defect sizing is still questionable and needs optimization. Furthermore, a limited knowledge about the amount of operating parameters, i. e. mainly the inner pressure and its changes, temperature variations and the use of an inaccurate analytical model for sizing influence the risk for failure and do not allow the MFL technique to be more effective. In order to reconstruct the shape and dimensions of corrosion defects from MFL signals, it is helpful to use a 2 D approximation to save expensive computational costs of simulation in 3 D. In the here proposed work we demonstrate that 2 D simulation can be accurate enough to interpret MFL signals obtained from corrosion defects and subsequently allow the defect reconstruction. The selection of an ideal mesh resolution and the boundary conditions are two essential parameters to guarantee accurate numerical results. MFL signals are simulated in 3 D- and 2 D-approximations in a steel plate with three different half-spherical artificial defects. Simulation results are discussed and compared with experimental results...|$|R

For this seawater, aquifer water and produced water (water recovered from crude oil) are most commonly used. Typically the water injection pipelines (WIP) are carbon steel and are not cathodically protected. The potential for pipeline failure caused by internal corrosion is an on-going concern for the industry. Corrosion mitigation methods include deoxygenation, corrosion inhibitors, biocides, and pigging. The most serious corrosion problem is channelling corrosion, known also as 6 o’clock corrosion or bottom of line corrosion, although it does not occur in all pipelines, for reasons not fully understood. It shows as aggressive corrosion at the bottom part of pipelines and is much more severe than corrosion elsewhere in WIPs. Recent assessment and monitoring of several water injection pipelines from the North Sea continental shelf obtained either by <b>intelligent</b> <b>pigging</b> tools or onsite bio-coupons has indicated that microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC) and under-deposit corrosion {{are likely to be}} involved in channelling corrosion. Despite occasional industrial reports and conference papers, the comprehensive interpretation of this type of corrosion is still limited.

Identical test rigs and different test scenarios were established to ascertain the influence of the presence of deposits, of water quality, surface roughness and nitrate addition.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a probabilistic-based methodology {{for the assessment}} of a pipeline containing internal corrosion defects. Two different models have been used to predict the future CO 2 corrosion rates namely a linear growth and the deWaard-Milliams models. A probabilistic approach is used to analyse the behaviour of corrosion data obtained from in-line <b>intelligent</b> (ILI) <b>pigging</b> inspections. The outcomes are parameters represented by their corresponding statistical distribution. Due to the availability of these statistical parameters, a Monte Carlo simulation is used to calculate the probability of failure of the pipeline due to bursting failure. The existence of corrosion may reduce the maximum capacity of the pipe, as such causing leakage and bursting when the operational pressure supersedes its threshold. From the analysis of the result, failure probability based on theoretical linear growth model exhibit slightly longer lifetime of the pipeline with three years interval compared to deWaard-Milliams model. This is due to higher mean value of corrosion growth rate estimated using the empirical deWaard-Milliams model. Both results are very useful in prolonging the lifetime of pipelines by having knowledge of the past to schedule the future maintenance work...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} {{the risk of}} accidental release of hydrocarbons during transportation and storage. Transportation of hydrocarbons from an offshore platform to processing units through subsea pipelines involves risk of release due to pipeline leakage resulting from corrosion, plastic deformation caused by seabed shakedown or damaged by contact with drifting iceberg. The environmental impacts of hydrocarbon dispersion can be severe. Overall safety and economic concerns of pipeline leakage at subsea environment are immense. A large leak can be detected by employing conventional technology such as, radar, <b>intelligent</b> <b>pigging</b> or chemical tracer but in a remote location like subsea or arctic, a small chronic leak may be undetected {{for a period of}} time. In case of storage, an accidental release of hydrocarbon from the storage tank could lead pool fire; further it could escalate to domino effects. This chain of accidents may lead to extremely severe consequences. Analyzing past accident scenarios it is observed {{that more than half of}} the industrial domino accidents involved fire as a primary event, and some other factors for instance, wind speed and direction, fuel type and engulfment of the compound. In this thesis, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach is taken to model the subsea pipeline leak and the pool fire from a storage tank. A commercial software package ANSYS FLUENT Workbench 15 is used to model the subsea pipeline leakage. The CFD simulation results of four different types of fluids showed that the static pressure and pressure gradient along the axial length of the pipeline have a sharp signature variation near the leak orifice at steady state condition. Transient simulation is performed to obtain the acoustic signature of the pipe near leak orifice. The power spectral density (PSD) of acoustic signal is strong near the leak orifice and it dissipates as the distance and orientation from the leak orifice increase. The high-pressure fluid flow generates more noise than the low-pressure fluid flow. In order to model the pool fire from the storage tank, ANSYS CFX Workbench 14 is used. The CFD results show that the wind speed has significant contribution on the behavior of pool fire and its domino effects. The radiation contours are also obtained from CFD post processing, which can be applied for risk analysis. The outcome of this study will be helpful for better understanding of the domino effects of pool fire in complex geometrical settings of process industries. The attempt to reduce and prevent risks is discussed based on the results obtained from the numerical simulations of the numerical models...|$|R

A guinea pig named Cashew features prominently in the second season of the U.S. adaptation of House of Cards.|$|R
40|$|The {{main reasons}} {{of the oil}} {{pipeline}} accidents is wall thinning due to corrosion and cracks. This topic develops a broad-band ultrasonic pig technology to detect pipeline corrosion and cracks。The technique can automatically measure wall thickness、diameter and detect axial crack flaw entirely and it can solve the misjudgments and miss judgment during ultrasonic pipeline corrosion inspection also. Key words: pipeline, corrosion, axial crack, broad-band ultrasonic inspection, The pipeline is the most economic and effective means of transferring {{oil and natural gas}} over long distance. However, in the long time service the pipelines would weaken the safety performance and even resulted in leakage and pipe explosion accidents because of damages, such as corrosion、scour、outside force. In order to timely discovering the dangerous segment and establishing optimal strategy of instead and maintain pipeline, the in-served pipeline should be periodically online evaluated by using pipeline inspection pigs[1, 2] 。 The pipeline <b>intelligent</b> inspection <b>pig</b> must has special performances, such as: it can check out the corrosion flaw of 10 × 10 mm 2 and axial cracks of 1 - 3 mm depth; the measurement precision of wall thickness is +-o. 5 mm;it is working on long detecting distance (150 - 500 Km) with speed up to 1 m/sec and can storage a great deal of measurement data;the pigs require integrated electronic...|$|R
40|$|The {{basic problem}} of main {{pipelines}} non-destructive examination is {{reliability and validity}} of obtained parameters of flaws (including stress-corrosion cracks). One of the most rapid and efficient NDT techniques for main pipelines is the method of magnetic flux leak (MFL) over defect. In accordance with magnetic method canon- the examination reliability (that is probability of crack detection starting from some preset threshold level) is a multiparameter task. The MFL technique is widely used for detection of internal and external stress-corrosion. The instruments implementing MFL method provide magnetization of pipeline wall material up to the technical saturation level; after that the magnetic filed flux leak is registered by magnetic field sensors. Stress-corrosion and corrosion like defects present in the pipeline wall are detected based on information picked up from those sensors. The difficulty in this case is the fact that basic measured parameter is subjected to impacts of numerous factors including material sensitivity towards magnetization, types of sensors and there location, pipeline wall thickness, the gap between pipeline surface and measuring element, etc. The magnetic instruments, as a rule, comprise: magnetic module inducing magnetic field in the pipeline wall; sensors placed between magnets at certain distance from each other. If it is required to evaluate the depth of the stress-corrosion crack the number of sensors and distance between them should be determined. Also it is necessary to evaluate and determine the distance between neighboring stress-corrosion cracks making it possible to differentiate them. In the paper posed is the problem and discussed are approaches of its solution, i. e. how to define the sufficient number of sensors to detect peak signal amplitude that can be correlated to the depth of stress-corrosion crack and how to determine minimal distances between cracks for which the last ones can be differentiated.
