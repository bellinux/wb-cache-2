5|$|After {{experiencing}} {{fluctuations in}} the decades immediately after the independence of India, the economies of South Indian states have registered growth {{higher than the national}} average over the past three decades. While South Indian states have improved in some of the socio-economic metrics, poverty continues to affect the region as <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> rest of the country, although it has considerably decreased over the years. Basis the 2011 census, HDI in the southern states is high and the economy has grown at a faster rate than most northern states.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to {{the flat}} {{appearance}} of the loudspeaker, all three panels are slightly curved along the vertical axis to improve quality. The panels themselves are flat, but obtain their curvature by being slightly bent to a curved backing. With the bipolar nature of the speaker emitting sound from both front and back surfaces as <b>it</b> <b>does,</b> <b>the</b> application of a felt sheet {{to the rear of}} the panels damps and absorbs high frequencies radiating from the back. A crossover network, set at 500Hz, remains necessary to adjust for back-to-front interference causing loss in output at low frequencies. In addition, the speaker should stand in free space to achieve optimum sound. The instructions book contains advice against placement of the speaker in corners or positions close to or parallel with walls, and further explains that a corner placement will adversely affect bass response and be detrimental to the midrange because of standing waves generated.|$|E

25|$|In CKD {{numerous}} uremic toxins {{accumulate in}} the blood. Even when ESKD (largely synonymous with CKD5) is treated with dialysis, the toxin levels {{do not go}} back to normal as dialysis is not that efficient. Similarly, after a kidney transplant, the levels may {{not go back to}} normal as the transplanted kidney may not work 100%. If <b>it</b> <b>does,</b> <b>the</b> creatinine level is often normal. The toxins show various cytotoxic activities in the serum and have different molecular weights, {{and some of them are}} bound to other proteins, primarily to albumin. Such toxic protein-bound substances are receiving the attention of scientists who are interested in improving the standard chronic dialysis procedures used today.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which tools are integrated into the body schema are not fully understood. However, studies with long-term training have shown interesting phenomena. When wielding tools in both hands in a crossed posture, behavioral effects reverse {{in a similar way}} to when only hands are crossed. Thus, sensory stimuli are delivered the same way be it to the hands directly or indirectly via the tools. These studies suggest the mind incorporates the tools into the same or similar areas as <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> adjacent hands. Recent research into the short term plasticity of the body schema used individuals without any prior training with tools. These results, derived from the relation between afterimages and body schema, show that tools are incorporated into the body schema within seconds, regardless of length of training, though the results do not extend to other species besides humans.|$|E

500|$|Honiara {{developed}} economically at a {{much faster}} rate than other parts of Solomon Islands; during the 1960s and 1970s some two-thirds of the investment into economic development in the country went into developing the infrastructure of Honiara, {{despite the fact that}} at the time only some five percent of Solomon Islanders lived there. [...] Like Tulagi, the town did not grow substantially as a result of industrialisation. As Trevor Sofield says, [...] "The shops and businesses in these centers served the needs of the government officials and expatriate businessmen, planters and traders. Honiara, like many other ex-colonial cities, still reflects the political, economic and cultural structure of its former metropolitan mentor much more than <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> national traits of Solomon Islands society." ...|$|E

500|$|In December 2008, it was {{reported}} that Deutsche Bahn (DB) was interested in buying the British share in Eurostar, which in practice means buying Eurostar (U.K.) Ltd., the 100% subsidiary of London and Continental Railways (LCR), which the British government intends to break up and sell just as <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> other rail-related subsidiary of L, HS1 Ltd.

500|$|Give Up was {{generally}} well received by music critics. It holds {{a score of}} 79 out of 100 on review aggregate site Metacritic, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews". Matt LeMay of online music magazine Pitchfork called the album [...] "a pretty damned strong record, and one with enough transcendent moments to forgive it its few substandard tracks and ungodly lyrical blunders". Will Hermes of Entertainment Weekly wrote that [...] "Ben Gibbard radiates claustrophobia, so the shut-in synth-pop of this side project fits him like a leotard", calling Give Up [...] "the near-perfect pop record that's eluded his main group." [...] The Village Voices Robert Christgau praised its [...] "staying power" [...] and felt that [...] "Gibbard's delicate voice matches the subtle electro arrangements far more precisely than <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> folky guitars of his real group".|$|E

[...] Regarding the chorus of the song, Millard said [...] "the whole idea of the chorus and the sense that it brings in, with the tons of voices singing, is the fact that there's a day thats going to come when we are going to worship and be as one." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1950, Tawfik Toubi, an Arab {{member of}} the Knesset, {{raised the issue of}} the {{internally}} displaced refugees of al-Birwa in the Knesset, demanding that they be allowed to return to their homes. Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion replied in the negative, stating, [...] "The questioner presented the facts inaccurately. Birwa is an abandoned village which was destroyed in the fighting. Its inhabitants cooperated with Kaukji's gangs. The Israel Defense Forces and the government did not treat them as they deserved, but permitted them to remain in villages near Birwa, and to become residents of Israel. The government of Israel treats them as <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> other residents of Israel and those lacking means of subsistence. A special body was established to deal with these refugees, to resettle and rehabilitate them, not necessarily in their former villages, and the resettlement of the refugees in Nazareth has already begun." [...] In December 1951, the village site was declared a closed military zone.|$|E
500|$|The {{experimental}} {{tendencies of}} hypnagogic pop artists like Pink and Ferraro were soon amplified by the Internet-centric genre known as vaporwave. Although the name shares the [...] "-wave" [...] suffix, {{it is only}} loosely connected to chillwave. Stereogums Miles Bowe summarized vaporwave as a combination of [...] "the chopped and screwed plunderphonics of Dan Lopatin ... with the nihilistic easy-listening of James Ferraro’s Muzak-hellscapes on [...] Far Side Virtual". Critic Adam Harper identified several differences and similarities between hypnagogic pop and vaporwave; the two genres share an affinity for [...] "trash music", both are [...] "dreamy" [...] and [...] "chirpy", and both [...] "manipulate their material to defamiliarise it {{and give it a}} sense of the uncanny, such as slowing it down and/or lowering the pitch, making it, as the term goes, ‘screwed’." [...] Of differences, vaporwave does not typically engage in long tracks, lo-fi productions, or non-sampled material, and it draws more from the early 1990s than <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> 1970s and 1980s.|$|E

However, he noted that Flight Unlimited IIs [...] "underlying playability" [...] made it [...] "worthwhile" [...] and [...] "addictive". Presley summarized, [...] "s a time-waster, a novelty item or an office toy, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> job and it does it well." [...] Jonathan Gordon of The Independent wrote, [...] "The original Flight Unlimited promised much but delivered relatively little, and it's a similar story with this sequel." [...] He noted that the graphics, while good from a distance, became [...] "disappointingly bland" [...] up close; and he found the game to be limited compared to Microsoft Flight Simulator '98.|$|E
