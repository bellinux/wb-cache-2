5|$|The lens {{features}} a <b>hypersonic</b> zoom motor for its autofocus, {{which is considered}} to be a fast and quiet design. In addition, manual override is allowed in the single-shot autofocus mode. The lens, which focuses internally, has one of the lowest maximum magnification measurements in its class (which includes the Canon 10–18mm and 10–22mm, Sigma 10–20mm f/3.5 and Sigma 10–20mm f/4–5.6 EX DC HSM, Tamron 10–24mm f/3.5–4.5 DI II, Nikon 10–24mm f/3.5–4.5G ED AF-S DX, and Tokina 11–16mm f/2.8 AT-X Pro DX lenses). The lens' autofocus feature is not functional with Pentax ist* series and K100D DSLR cameras that do not support <b>hypersonic</b> zoom mechanics. The lens is capable of focusing from infinity to minimum focusing distance and back in under a second: so micro focusing is rapid. However, because of the narrow focus range (0.13x) the lens is not suitable for macro photography.|$|E
5|$|He {{accepted}} a teaching {{position in the}} Department of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Cincinnati, having decided on Cincinnati over other universities, including his alma mater, Purdue, because it had a small aerospace department; he hoped that the faculty members would not be annoyed that he came straight into a professorship with only the USC master's degree. He began the work while stationed at Edwards years before, and finally completed it after Apollo11 by presenting a report on various aspects of Apollo, instead of a thesis on the simulation of <b>hypersonic</b> flight. The official job title he received at Cincinnati was University Professor of Aerospace Engineering. After teaching for eight years, he resigned in 1979 without explaining his reason for leaving.|$|E
40|$|The Australian <b>hypersonics</b> network {{comprises}} the key institutions conducting <b>hypersonics</b> {{research in this}} country. These are: The University of Queensland (UQ); The University of New South Wales at the Australian Defence Force Academy (UNSW@ADFA); The University of Southern Queensland (USQ); The University of Adelaide (UA); and the Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO). The network is university-driven and exists to maintain world-class, fundamental research in <b>hypersonics</b> to underpin developments in both space science and technology and high speed atmospheric and space transport. <b>Hypersonics</b> is the science and technology of flight at speeds greater than approximately five times the sound barrier, and defines the design and operation of vehicles for access to and return from space, and for entry into other planetary atmospheres. <b>Hypersonics</b> is thus a key enabling technology for space science and industry, and features strongly {{in the activities of}} major international space players such as NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), the respective German, French and Italian aerospace agencies (DLR, ONERA and CIRA), the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), and others. <b>Hypersonics</b> is also the focus of considerable investment and effort by emerging space-faring nations such as India, China and Brazil. Australia, mainly through a heritage established and maintained by our universities, but also more recently by the applied work at DSTO, is a world leader in <b>hypersonics</b> research and development.

5|$|The German Aerospace Center (DLR) studied {{potential}} future launch {{vehicles of}} the European Union under the Ausgewählte Systeme und Technologien für Raumtransport (ASTRA; English: Systems and Technologies for Space Transportation Applications) programme from 1999 to 2005, with additional studies continuing until 2009. The LFBB design {{was one of}} two projects within the ASTRA program, the other being Phoenix RLV. During development, scale models were constructed for testing various configurations in DLR's supersonic Trisonische Messstrecke Köln (TMK; English: Trisonic measuring section at Cologne) and in their Hyperschallwindkanal 2 Köln (H2K; English: <b>Hypersonic</b> wind canal at Cologne) wind tunnels. The preliminary mechanical design of other major elements was done by the companies EADS Space Transportation and MAN.|$|E
5|$|Criminal mastermind the Hood (voiced by Ray Barrett) is telepathically {{linked to}} his half-brother, Kyrano (David Graham), the manservant on Tracy Island. Abusing this {{connection}} and inflicting severe psychological trauma on his sibling, he discovers that International Rescue – the Tracy family's newly formed life-saving organisation – {{is ready to}} start operations. Determined to steal the secrets of IR's Thunderbird machines, the Hood plots to have the Tracys called to a disaster situation of his own design. Travelling from his temple hideout in the Malaysian jungle to London International Airport, he plants a bomb next to the landing gear hydraulics of Air Terrainean's new Fireflash – an atomic-powered, <b>hypersonic</b> airliner departing for her maiden flight to Tokyo. One of the passengers is Kyrano's daughter, Tin-Tin. In an anonymous videophone call to London Tower, the Hood warns Commander Norman of Air Traffic Control that the motion-sensitive device will detonate from the impact of landing.|$|E
25|$|In aerodynamics, <b>hypersonic</b> speeds are speeds {{that are}} highly supersonic. In the 1970s, the term {{generally}} came to refer to speeds of Mach 5 (5 times the speed of sound) and above. The <b>hypersonic</b> regime is {{a subset of the}} supersonic regime. <b>Hypersonic</b> flow is characterized by high temperature flow behind a shock wave, viscous interaction, and chemical dissociation of gas.|$|E
40|$|<b>Hypersonics</b> is {{the study}} of flight at speeds where {{aerodynamic}} heating dominates the physics of the problem.

25|$|On 27 August 2012, Jane's Defence {{reported}} that Dmitry Rogozin had recently {{called for the}} bomber {{to be capable of}} <b>hypersonic</b> speed in order to match and better the air defenses of the United States. It is unclear whether Rogozin's comments refer to the bomber being <b>hypersonic</b> or to its ability to carry <b>hypersonic</b> air-launched missiles.

25|$|As a {{first step}} towards realizing a Two Stage To Orbit (TSTO) fully {{re-usable}} launch vehicle, a series of technology demonstration missions have been conceived. For this purpose, a Winged Reusable Launch Vehicle Technology Demonstrator (RLV-TD) has been configured. The RLV-TD will act as a flying test bed to evaluate various technologies viz., <b>hypersonic</b> flight, autonomous landing, powered cruise flight and <b>hypersonic</b> flight using air-breathing propulsion.

25|$|Aerodynamic {{problems}} {{can also be}} classified according to whether the flow speed is below, near or above the speed of sound. A problem is called subsonic if all the speeds in the problem are less {{than the speed of}} sound, transonic if speeds both below and above the speed of sound are present (normally when the characteristic speed is approximately the speed of sound), supersonic when the characteristic flow speed is greater than the speed of sound, and <b>hypersonic</b> when the flow speed is much greater than the speed of sound. Aerodynamicists disagree over the precise definition of <b>hypersonic</b> flow; a rough definition considers flows with Mach numbers above 5 to be <b>hypersonic.</b>|$|E

25|$|With some exceptions, the {{knowledge}} of <b>hypersonic</b> aerodynamics has matured between the 1960s and the present decade. Therefore, the goals of an aerodynamicist have shifted from understanding the behavior of fluid flow to understanding how to engineer a vehicle to interact appropriately with the fluid flow. For example, while the behavior of <b>hypersonic</b> flow is understood, building a scramjet aircraft to fly at <b>hypersonic</b> speeds has seen very limited success. Along with building a successful scramjet aircraft, the desire to improve the aerodynamic efficiency of current aircraft and propulsion systems will continue to fuel new research in aerodynamics. Nevertheless, there are still important problems in basic aerodynamic theory, such as in predicting transition to turbulence, and the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations.|$|E

25|$|While many flows (e.g. flow {{of water}} through a pipe) occur at low Mach numbers, many flows of {{practical}} interest in aerodynamics or in turbomachines occur at high fractions of M=1 (transonic flows) or in excess of it (supersonic or even <b>hypersonic</b> flows). New phenomena occur at these regimes such as instabilities in transonic flow, shock waves for supersonic flow, or non-equilibrium chemical behaviour due to ionization in <b>hypersonic</b> flows. In practice, each of those flow regimes is treated separately.|$|E
