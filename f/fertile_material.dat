25|$|In thorium {{fuel cycle}} thorium-232 absorbs a neutron {{in either a}} fast or thermal reactor. The thorium-233 beta decays to protactinium-233 and then to uranium-233, {{which in turn is}} used as fuel. Hence, like uranium-238, thorium-232 is a <b>fertile</b> <b>material.</b>|$|E
25|$|Modifications {{to produce}} weapon-usable {{material}} {{in a commercial}} facility: The production potential is significant. But no fertile or fissile substances necessary {{for the production of}} weapon-usable materials needs to be present at a civil fusion system at all. If not shielded, a detection of these materials can be done by their characteristic gamma radiation. The underlying redesign could be detected by regular design information verifications. In the (technically more feasible) case of solid breeder blanket modules, it would be necessary for incoming components to be inspected for the presence of <b>fertile</b> <b>material,</b> otherwise plutonium for several weapons could be produced each year.|$|E

25|$|Thorium {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a clean, safe, proliferation resistant and sustainable source of energy which additionally is free {{from most of the}} issues associated with uranium. The average crustal abundance of thorium is four times more than that of uranium. Thorium is invariably associated with rare-earth elements or rare metals like niobium, tantalum and zirconium. Hence, it can be recovered as a by-product of other mining activities. Already, large quantities of thorium recovered from rare-earth element operations have been stockpiled in many countries. Thorium is <b>fertile</b> <b>material,</b> and essentially all thorium {{can be used in a}} nuclear reactor. Thorium is not fissile in itself, absorbs a neutron to transmute into uranium-233, which can fission to produce energy. Therefore, a thorium based fuel cycle produces very little, easily manageable waste compared to uranium. Thorium based fuel cycle options can be used to 'burn' all the presently accumulated nuclear waste. Various thorium based reactor designs are inherently more safe than uranium based reactors.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} this effect {{is the use of}} nuclear fuels with thorium. Th-232 is a <b>fertile</b> <b>material</b> that can undergo a neutron capture {{reaction}} and two beta minus decays, resulting in the production of fissile U-233. The SNF of a cycle with thorium will contain U-233. Its radioactive decay will strongly influence the long-term activity curve of the SNF around a million years. A comparison of the activity associated to U-233 for three different SNF types {{can be seen in the}} figure on the top right. The burnt fuels are thorium with reactor-grade plutonium (RGPu), thorium with weapons-grade plutonium (WGPu) and Mixed Oxide fuel (MOX, no thorium). For RGPu and WGPu, the initial amount of U-233 and its decay around a million years can be seen. This has an effect in the total activity curve of the three fuel types. The initial absence of U-233 and its daughter products in the MOX fuel results in a lower activity in region 3 of the figure on the bottom right, whereas for RGPu and WGPu the curve is maintained higher due to the presence of U-233 that has not fully decayed. Nuclear reprocessing can remove the actinides from the spent fuel so they can be used or destroyed (see Long-lived fission product#Actinides).|$|E
2500|$|In fusion-fission hybrid reactors, high-energy fast {{neutrons}} {{generated by}} nuclear fusion {{can be used}} to convert fertile materials such as Thorium-232 or Uranium-238 into fissionable fuels for fission reactors such as Uranium-233 or Plutonium-239. The high-energy fusion-generated neutrons {{can also be used to}} trigger nuclear fission in traditional nuclear fuels such as Uranium-235. The hybrid reactor concept has a fusion reactor at the core and a surrounding “blanket” of <b>fertile</b> <b>material,</b> either Thorium-232 or Uranium-238. In a hybrid reactor, high-energy neutrons from fusion reactions are used to produce fissionable materials such as Uranium-233 or Plutonium-239 which would need then to be reprocessed and used as fuel in a fission nuclear power plant. [...] One fusion hybrid plant can provide enough fuel for as many as five nuclear power plants of the same power.|$|E
50|$|Spent fuel {{discharged}} from reactors contains appreciable quantities of fissile (U-235 and Pu-239), fertile (U-238), and other radioactive materials, including reaction poisons, {{which is why}} the fuel had to be removed. These fissile and <b>fertile</b> <b>materials</b> can be chemically separated and recovered from the spent fuel. The recovered uranium and plutonium can, if economic and institutional conditions permit, be recycled for use as nuclear fuel. This is currently not done for civilian spent nuclear fuel in the United States.|$|R
50|$|Nuclear fission {{involving}} breeder reactors, a reactor which breeds more fissile fuel {{than they}} consume and thereby has a breeding ratio for fissile fuel higher than 1 thus has a stronger case for being considered a renewable resource than conventional fission reactors. Breeder reactors would constantly replenish the available supply of nuclear fuel by converting <b>fertile</b> <b>materials,</b> such as uranium-238 and thorium, into fissile isotopes of plutonium or uranium-233, respectively. <b>Fertile</b> <b>materials</b> are also nonrenewable, but their supply on Earth is extremely large, with a supply timeline greater than geothermal energy. In a closed nuclear fuel cycle utilizing breeder reactors, nuclear fuel could therefore be considered renewable. In 1983, physicist Bernard Cohen claimed that fast breeder reactors, fueled exclusively by natural uranium extracted from seawater, could supply energy {{at least as}} long as the sun's expected remaining lifespan of five billion years. This was based on calculations involving the geological cycles of erosion, subduction, and uplift, leading to humans consuming half of the total uranium in the Earth’s crust at an annual usage rate of 6500 tonne/yr, which was enough to produce approximately 10 times the world's 1983 electricity consumption, and would reduce the concentration of uranium in the seas by 25%, resulting in an increase in the price of uranium of less than 25%.|$|R
40|$|A burn-up {{calculation}} {{system has}} been developed to estimate performance of blanket in a fusion-fission hybrid reactor which is a fusion reactor with a blanket region containing nuclear fuel. In this system, neutron flux is calculated by MCNP 4 B and then burn-up calculation is performed by ORIGEN 2. The cross-section library for ORIGEN 2 is made from the calculated neutron flux and evaluated nuclear data. The 3 -dimensional ITER model {{was used as a}} base fusion reactor. The nuclear fuel (reprocessed plutonium as the fissile materials mixed with thorium as the <b>fertile</b> <b>materials),</b> transmutation materials (minor actinides and long-lived fission products) and tritium breeder were loaded into the blanket. Performances of gas-cooled and water-cooled blankets were compared with each other. As a result, the proposed reactor can meet the requirement for TBR and power density. As far as nuclear waste incineration is concerned, the gas-cooled blanket has advantages. On the other hand, the water cooled-blanket is suited to energy production...|$|R

50|$|Initially, {{the core}} {{is loaded with}} <b>fertile</b> <b>material,</b> with a few rods of fissile fuel {{concentrated}} in the central region. After the reactor is started, four zones form within the core: the depleted zone, which contains mostly fission products and leftover fuel; the fission zone, where fission of bred fuel takes place; the breeding zone, where fissile material is created by neutron capture; and the fresh zone, which contains unreacted <b>fertile</b> <b>material.</b> The energy-generating fission zone steadily advances through the core, effectively consuming <b>fertile</b> <b>material</b> {{in front of it}} and leaving spent fuel behind. Meanwhile, the heat released by fission is absorbed by the molten sodium and subsequently transferred into a closed-cycle aqueous loop, where electric power is generated by steam turbines.|$|E

5000|$|A {{fast neutron}} {{is a free}} neutron with a kinetic energy level close to [...] (...) , hence a speed of ~ (~5% {{of the speed of}} light). They are named fission energy or fast {{neutrons}} to distinguish them from lower-energy thermal neutrons, and high-energy neutrons produced in cosmic showers or accelerators. Fast neutrons are produced by nuclear processes such as nuclear fission. Neutrons produced in fission, as noted above, have a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of kinetic energies from 0 to ~14 MeV, a mean energy of 2 MeV (for U-235 fission neutrons), and a mode of only 0.75 MeV, which means {{that more than half of}} them do not qualify as fast (and thus have almost no chance of initiating fission in <b>fertile</b> <b>materials,</b> such as U-238 and Th-232).|$|R
50|$|A {{light water}} reactor (LWR) uses {{water in the}} form that occurs in nature, and {{requires}} fuel enriched to higher concentrations of fissile isotopes. Typically LWRs use uranium enriched to 3-5% content of the less common isotope U-235, the only fissile isotope that is found in significant quantity in nature. One alternative to this low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel are mixed oxide (MOX) fuels produced by blending plutonium with natural or depleted uranium, and these fuels provide an avenue to utilize surplus weapons-grade plutonium. Another type of MOX fuel involves mixing LEU with thorium, which generates the fissile isotope U-233. Both plutonium and U-233 are produced from the absorption of neutrons by irradiating <b>fertile</b> <b>materials</b> in a reactor, in particular the common uranium isotope U-238 and thorium, respectively, and can be separated from spent uranium and thorium fuels in reprocessing plants.|$|R

That mass difference means that thorium-232 requires six more neutron capture events per nucleus before the transuranic elements can be produced. In addition to this simple mass difference, the reactor gets two chances to fission the nuclei as the mass increases: First as the effective fuel nuclei U233, and as it absorbs two more neutrons, again as the fuel nuclei U235.|$|E

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the new generation of nuclear fission reactors, one of the promising systems is the Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR) [1]. It is a thorium fuelled fast spectrum reactor in which the fissile and <b>fertile</b> <b>materials</b> are dissolved into a molten salt mixture.

Results show that Th fosters large improvements in the reactivity coefficients associated with coolant expansion and voiding, which enhances safety margins and, for a burner design, can be traded for maximizing the TRU burning rate. A trade-off of Th compared to U is the significantly larger fuel inventory required to achieve a breakeven design, which entails additional blankets at the detriment of core compactness as well as fuel manufacturing and separation requirements. The gamma field generated by the progeny of U- 232 in the U bred from Th challenges fuel handling and manufacturing, but in case of full recycle, the high contents of Am and Cm in the transmutation fuel impose remote fuel operations regardless of the presence of U- 232...|$|R

40|$|Four {{profiles}} of grey degraded soils and of sandy soils {{were collected from}} different agro-ecological regions in Vietnam and subjected to clay mineral analysis in addition to particle-size analysis. The result showed that those soils had the low clay while high sand contents in the upper layers or throughout the profile. This was ascribed to decomposition of layer silicate minerals in the upper layers and/or downward shifting of clay particles in a profile for grey degraded soils and to inheritance from the parent material for sandy soils. Predominant minerals detected in the clay fraction were kaolin (kaolinite and halloysite (0. 7 nm)) and quartz for both soil types. The present study indicated two opposite processes of soil development. For grey degraded soils, reduction in the clay content with decomposition of layer silicate minerals was enhanced with advancement of soil degradation. As a result, they became sandy-like soils with domination of quartz in the clay fraction. For sandy soils, on the other hand, their particle-size distribution and clay mineralogical composition were changed naturally by enrichment with clay particles from surrounding environment.
