40|$|Radiation {{in space}} is {{potentially}} hazardous to microelectronic circuits and {{systems such as}} spacecraft electronics. Transient effects on circuits and systems from high energetic particles can interrupt electronics operation or crash the systems. This phenomenon is particularly serious in complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) integrated circuits (ICs) since most of modern ICs are implemented with CMOS technologies. The problem is getting worse with the technology scaling down. Radiation-hardening-by-design (RHBD) is a popular method to build CMOS devices and systems meeting performance criteria in radiation environment. Single-event transient (SET) effects in digital circuits have been studied extensively in the radiation effect community. In recent years analog RHBD has been received increasing attention since analog circuits start showing the vulnerability to the SETs due to the dramatic process scaling. Analog RHBD {{is still in the}} research stage. This study is to further study the effects of SET on analog CMOS circuits and introduces cost-effective RHBD approaches to mitigate these effects. The analog circuits concerned in this study include operational amplifiers (op amps), comparators, voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs), and phase-locked loops (PLLs). Op amp is used to study SET effects on signal amplitude while the comparator, the VCO, and the PLL are used to study SET effects on signal state during transition time. In this work, approaches based on multi-level from transistor, circuit, to system are presented to mitigate the SET effects on the aforementioned circuits. Specifically, RHBD approach based on the circuit level, such as the op amp, adapts the auto-zeroing cancellation technique. The RHBD comparator implemented with dual-well and triple-well is studied and compared at the transistor level. SET effects are mitigated in a LC-tank oscillator by inserting a <b>decoupling</b> <b>resistor.</b> The RHBD PLL is implemented on the system level using triple modular redundancy (TMR) approach. It demonstrates that RHBD at multi-level can be cost-effective to mitigate the SEEs in analog circuits. In addition, SETs detection approaches are provided in this dissertation so that various mitigation approaches can be implemented more effectively. Performances and effectiveness of the proposed RHBD are validated through SPICE simulations on the schematic and pulsed-laser experiments on the fabricated circuits. The proposed and tested RHBD techniques can be applied to other relevant analog circuits in the industry to achieve radiation-tolerance...|$|E
40|$|The ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) Time Projection Chamber (TPC) at CERN LHC is {{presently}} equipped with Multi Wire Proportional Chambers (MWPCs). A gating grid prevents ions produced during the gas amplification from {{moving into the}} drift volume. The maximum drift time of the electrons together with the closure time of the gating grid allows a maximum readout rate of about 3 kHz. After the Long Shutdown 2 (from 2021 onwards), the LHC will provide lead-lead collisions at an expected interaction rate of 50 kHz. To take data at this rate the TPC will be upgraded with new readout chambers, allowing for continuous read-out and preserving the energy and momentum resolution of the current MWPCs. Chambers {{with a stack of}} four Gas Electron Multipliers (GEMs) fulfil all the performance requirements, if the voltages applied to the GEMs are tuned properly. In order to ensure that these chambers are stable while being operated at the LHC, studies of the discharge behaviour were performed. We report on studies done with small prototypes equipped with one or two GEMs. Discharges were voluntarily induced by a combination of high-voltages across the GEM(s) and highly ionising particles. During these studies, the phenomenon of "secondary discharges" has been observed. These occur only after an initial discharge when the electric field above or below the GEM is high enough. The time between the initial and the secondary discharge ranges from several 10 us to less than 1 us, decreasing with increasing field. Using <b>decoupling</b> <b>resistors</b> in the high-voltage supply path of the bottom side of the GEM shifts the occurrence of these discharges to higher electric fields.

40|$|Upset {{thresholds}} for bulk CMOS and CMOS/SOS RAMS were deduced after {{bombardment of}} the devices with 140 MeV Kr, 160 MeV Ar, and 33 MeV O beams in a cyclotron. The trials were performed to test prototype devices intended for space applications, to relate feature size to the critical upset charge, and to check the validity of computer simulation models. The tests were run on 4 and 1 K memory cells with 6 transistors, in either hardened or unhardened configurations. The upset cross sections were calculated to determine the critical charge for upset from the soft errors observed in the irradiated cells. Computer simulations of the critical charge were found to deviate from the experimentally observed variation of the critical charge as {{the square of the}} feature size. Modeled values of series <b>resistors</b> <b>decoupling</b> the inverter pairs of memory cells showed that above some minimum resistance value a small increase in resistance produces a large increase in the critical charge, which the experimental data showed to be of questionable validity unless the value is made dependent on the maximum allowed read-write time...|$|R
