5|$|The Fleet Law of 1900 {{authorized}} the French Navy to build six new battleships, {{along with a}} host of other warship types; the law signaled an end to the Jeune École doctrine that emphasized commerce raiding and torpedo boats instead of a battle fleet of capital ships. The first two battleships ordered, the , formed the <b>design</b> <b>basis</b> for the subsequent four of the Liberté class. The naval engineer Émile Bertin designed both the République and Liberté classes.|$|E
5|$|The ellipse {{also served}} as the <b>design</b> <b>basis</b> for the Spitfire's fin and {{tailplane}} assembly, once again exploiting the shape's favourable aerodynamic characteristics. Both the elevators and rudder were shaped so that their centre of mass was shifted forward, thus reducing control-surface flutter. The longer noses and greater propeller-wash resulting from larger engines in later models necessitated increasingly larger vertical and, later, horizontal tail surfaces {{to compensate for the}} altered aerodynamics, culminating in those of the Mk 22/24 series which were 25% larger in area than those of the Mk I.|$|E
5|$|A further Scottish {{distinction}} {{from the}} UK flag days {{is that on}} Saint Andrew's Day, (30 November), the Union Flag will only be flown where a building {{has more than one}} flagpole; the Saltire will not be lowered {{to make way for the}} Union Flag where a single flagpole is present. If there are two or more flagpoles present, the Saltire may be flown in addition to the Union Flag but not in a superior position. This distinction arose after Members of the Scottish Parliament complained that Scotland was the only country in the world where the potential existed for the citizens of a country to be unable to fly their national flag on their country's national day. (In recent years, embassies of the United Kingdom have also flown the Saltire to mark St Andrew's Day). Many bodies of the Scottish Government use the flag as a <b>design</b> <b>basis</b> for their logo; for example, Safer Scotland's emblem depicts a lighthouse shining beams in a saltire shape onto a blue sky. Other Scottish bodies, both private and public, have also used the saltire in similar ways.|$|E

25|$|In {{the final}} years of the Second World War, Hawker's design team had become {{increasingly}} interested in developing a fighter aircraft that took advantage of the newly developed jet propulsion technology. Prior to this, Hawker had been heavily committed until late 1944 to the production and further development of its existing piston-powered aircraft, such as the Hurricane, Tempest and Typhoon, to meet the wartime demands for these aircraft. On 1 September 1944, the first prototype of the company's latest fighter aircraft, the Hawker Fury/Sea Fury, conducted its maiden flight; it was this aircraft that would serve as the fundamental <b>design</b> <b>basis</b> for Hawker's first jet-powered aircraft.|$|E

25|$|The {{plant is}} {{on a bluff}} which was {{originally}} 35 meters above sea level. During construction, however, TEPCO lowered {{the height of the}} bluff by 25 meters. One reason for lowering the bluff was to allow the base of the reactors to be constructed on solid bedrock in order to mitigate the threat posed by earthquakes. Another reason was the lowered height would keep the running costs of the seawater pumps low. TEPCO's analysis of the tsunami risk when planning the site's construction determined that the lower elevation was safe because the sea wall would provide adequate protection for the maximum tsunami assumed by the <b>design</b> <b>basis.</b> However, the lower site elevation did increase the vulnerability for a tsunami larger than anticipated in design.|$|E
25|$|Two of {{the four}} EPRs under {{construction}} (in Finland and France) are significantly behind schedule and substantially over cost. Following the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, costs are likely to go up for currently operating and new nuclear power plants, due to increased requirements for on-site spent fuel management and elevated <b>design</b> <b>basis</b> threats. While first of their kind designs, such as the EPRs under construction are behind schedule and over-budget, of the seven South Korean APR-1400s presently under construction worldwide, two are in S.Korea at the Hanul Nuclear Power Plant and four are at the largest nuclear station construction project {{in the world as}} of 2016, in the United Arab Emirates at the planned Barakah nuclear power plant.

25|$|While the Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant had {{operated}} safely since 1971, {{an earthquake}} and tsunami {{well beyond the}} <b>design</b> <b>basis</b> resulted in failure of AC power, backup generators and batteries which defeated all safety systems. These systems were necessary to keep the fuel cool after the reactor had been shut down. This resulted in partial or complete meltdown of fuel rods, damage to fuel storage pools and buildings, release of radioactive debris to surrounding area, air and sea, and resorting to the expedient use of fire engines and concrete pumps to deliver cooling water to spent fuel pools and containment. During the incident, pressure within the containments of reactors 1-3 rose to exceed design limits, which despite attempts to reduce pressure by venting radioactive gasses, resulted in breach of containment. Hydrogen leaking from the containment mixed with air into an explosive mixture which resulted in explosions in Unit 1,3 and 4, complicating attempts to stabilize the reactors.|$|E

25|$|In 2006 a Japanese {{government}} subcommittee {{was charged}} with revising the national guidelines on the earthquake-resistance of nuclear power plants, which had last been partially revised in 2001, resulting in {{the publication of a}} new seismic guide — the 2006 Regulatory Guide for Reviewing Seismic Design of Nuclear Power Reactor Facilities. The subcommittee membership included Professor Ishibashi, however his proposal that the standards for surveying active faults should be reviewed was rejected and he resigned at the final meeting, claiming that the review process was 'unscientific' and the outcome rigged to suit the interests of the Japan Electric Association, which had 11 of its committee members on the 19-member government subcommittee. Ishibashi has subsequently claimed that, although the new guide brought in the most far-reaching changes since 1978, it was 'seriously flawed' because it underestimated the <b>design</b> <b>basis</b> earthquake ground motion. He has also claimed that the enforcement system is 'a shambles' and questioned the independence of the Nuclear Safety Commission after a senior Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency official appeared to rule out a new review of the NSC's seismic design guide in 2007.|$|E
25|$|The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant {{consisted}} of six GE light water boiling water reactors (BWRs) {{with a combined}} power of 4.7 gigawatts, {{making it one of}} the world's 25 largest nuclear power stations. It was the first GE-designed nuclear plant to be constructed and run entirely by the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO). Reactor 1 was a 439 MWe type (BWR-3) reactor constructed in July 1967, and commenced operation on 26 March 1971. It was designed to withstand an earthquake with a peak ground acceleration of 0.18 g (1.74m/s2) and a response spectrum based on the 1952 Kern County earthquake. Reactors 2 and 3 were both 784 MWe type BWR-4s. Reactor 2 commenced operation in July 1974, and Reactor 3 in March 1976. The earthquake <b>design</b> <b>basis</b> for all units ranged from 0.42g (4.12m/s2) to 0.46g (4.52m/s2). After the 1978 Miyagi earthquake, when the ground acceleration reached 0.125g (1.22m/s2) for 30seconds, no damage to the critical parts of the reactor was found. Units 1–5 have a Mark-1 type (light bulb torus) containment structure; unit 6 has Mark 2-type (over/under) containment structure. In September 2010, Reactor 3 was partially fueled by mixed-oxides (MOX).|$|E

The missile shield around it is typically a tall cylindrical or domed building.

40|$|A new cascade basis {{reduction}} {{method of}} computing the optimal least-squares set of basis functions steering a given function is presented. The method combines the Lie group-theoretic and the singular value decomposition approaches {{in such a}} way that their respective strengths complement each other. Since the Lie group-theoretic approach is used, the set of basis and steering functions computed can be expressed analytically. Because the singular value decomposition method is used, this set of basis and steering functions is optimal in the least-squares sense. Furthermore, the computational complexity in <b>designing</b> <b>basis</b> functions for transformation groups with large numbers of parameters is signi cantly reduced. The e ciency of the cascade basis reduction method is demonstrated by designing a set of basis functions that steers a Gabor function under the four-parameter linear transformation group. ...|$|R
