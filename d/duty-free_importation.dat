2500|$|Journalists of the {{newspapers}} Kommersant and Moskovskij Komsomolets accused Kirill of profiteering and abuse of the privilege of <b>duty-free</b> <b>importation</b> of cigarettes granted to the Church in the mid-1990s and dubbed him [...] "Tobacco Metropolitan". The Department for External Church Relations was alleged to have acted as the largest supplier of foreign cigarettes in Russia. The profits of this operation allegedly under Kirill's direction were estimated to have totaled $1.5 billion by sociologist Nikolai Mitrokhin in 2004, and at $4 billion by The Moscow News in 2006. However, Nathaniel Davis said that [...] "... There {{is no evidence that}} Metropolitan Kirill has actually embezzled funds. What is more likely is that profits from the importation of tobacco and cigarettes have been used for urgent, pressing Church expenses." [...] The <b>duty-free</b> <b>importation</b> of cigarettes ended in 1997. In his 2002 interview with Izvestia, Metropolitan Kirill called the allegations about his profiteering a political campaign against him.|$|E

In December 1874, Grant held a state dinner at the White House for the King of Hawaii, David Kalakaua, who was seeking <b>duty-free</b> sugar <b>importation</b> to the US. Grant and Fish secured a free trade treaty in 1875 with the Kingdom of Hawaii, incorporating the Pacific islands' sugar industry into the United States' economic sphere.|$|R
50|$|These are the Subic and Clark Economic Zones (RA 7227) And Special Economic Zones (RA 7916). During the Ramos administration, the {{government}} tried to encourage firms to invest by converting military reservations in Clark and Subic to economic zones for developmental projects in cooperation with private sector companies. In order to incentivize participation, RA 7227 makes Subic a separate customs territory ensuring free flow or movement of goods and capital within, into and exported out of the Subic Special Economic Zone, {{as well as provide}} incentives such as tax and <b>duty-free</b> <b>importations</b> of raw materials, capital and equipment. Similarly, {{the government}} empowered the Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA) to determine regions and cities that could be considered ECOZONES - these are areas that have a high potential to be developed into agro-industrial, recreational, commercial and investment centers. The government provides defense and security measures, transportation, telecommunications, and other facilities needed to generate linkage with industries and employment opportunities. This aims to promote the flow of local and foreign investors given transformations of areas into developed business centers.|$|R

[...] Hawaiian sugar was made <b>duty-free,</b> while the <b>importation</b> of manufactured goods and clothing was allowed into the island kingdom. [...] By opening Hawaii to free trade the process for annexation and eventual statehood into the United States had begun.|$|R

50|$|Under the Renewable Energy Act (2008) {{incentives}} {{are available to}} developers of renewable energy. These incentives include an income tax holiday for the first seven years of the entity's commercial operations; <b>duty-free</b> <b>importation</b> and special realty tax rates on renewable energy machinery, equipment and materials within the first ten years; net operating loss carry-over; zero percent Value-Added Tax (VAT) rate {{for the sale of}} fuel or power generated from renewable sources of energy; and Tax Credit on domestic capital equipment and services.|$|E
50|$|PEZA offers both {{fiscal and}} non-fiscal {{incentives}} {{as well as}} ready-to-occupy business locations in world-class economic zones and IT parks or buildings. Fiscal incentives include: income tax holiday for {{a certain number of}} years, which translates to 100% exemption from corporate income tax; tax and <b>duty-free</b> <b>importation</b> of raw materials, capital equipment, machineries and spare parts; exemption from wharfage dues and export tax, impost or fees; VAT zero-rating of local purchases subject to compliance with BIR and PEZA requirements; exemption from payment of any and all local government imposts, fees, licenses or taxes; and exemption from expanded withholding tax. Non-fiscal incentives, on the other hand include simplified import-export procedures, extended visa facilitation assistance to foreign nationals and spouses and dependents; special visa multiple entry privileges; and more.|$|E
50|$|On December 16, 2008, the Renewable Energy Act of 2008 {{was signed}} into law to {{accelerate}} the exploration, development, and utilization of renewable energy resources, including biofuels and to provide a legal and institutional framework to harmonize the fragmented policies for renewable energy in the country. One salient feature of the policy is to create an environment conducive to investments through the provision of the following incentives: (a) <b>duty-free</b> <b>importation</b> of renewable energy (RE) machinery, equipment and materials over the initial 10 years through the issuance of certifications to RE developers; (b) <b>duty-free</b> <b>importation</b> of farm machinery and agricultural inputs during the initial 10 years from the effectivity of the Renewable Energy law; (c) income tax holidays over the first seven years of commercial operation; (d) accelerated depreciation if an RE fails to receive an ITH before full operation; (e) cash incentives from RE Developers for Missionary Electrification, i.e., 50% of the universal charge for power needed to service missionary areas; (f) corporate tax rates of 10% on its net taxable income after the initial seven-year ITH period; (g) tax exemptions for carbon credits; (h) special realty tax rates of not more than 1.5% on equipment and machinery, civil works, and other improvements; and (i) net operating loss carry-over (NOLCO) during {{the first three years of}} commercial operation will be deductible from gross income over the next seven years of operation. As of 2009, the Department of Energy has accredited 12 producers of Coconut Methyl Ester (CME) for biodiesel with a total production capacity of 395,620,165 liters. The Sugar Regulatory Administration (SRA) has accredited two producers of bioethanol (from sugarcane) with a total production capacity of 39 million liters per year.|$|E
5000|$|In 1952, Lansky {{even offered}} then President Carlos Prío Socarrás a bribe of U.S. $250,000 {{to step down}} so Batista could return to power. Once Batista retook control of the {{government}} in a military coup in March, 1952 he quickly put gambling back on track. The dictator contacted Lansky and offered him an annual salary of U.S. $25,000 to serve as an unofficial gambling minister. By 1955, Batista had changed the gambling laws once again, granting a gaming license to anyone who invested $1 million in a hotel or U.S. $200,000 in a new nightclub. Unlike the procedure for acquiring gaming licenses in Vegas, this provision exempted venture capitalists from background checks. As long as they made the required investment, they were provided with public matching funds for construction, a 10-year tax exemption and <b>duty-free</b> <b>importation</b> of equipment and furnishings. The government would get U.S. $250,000 for the license plus a percentage of the profits from each casino. Cuba's 10,000 slot machines, even the ones that dispensed small prizes for children at country fairs, were to be the province of Batista's brother-in-law, Roberto Fernandez y Miranda. An Army general and government sports director, Fernandez was also given the parking meters in Havana as a little something extra. Import duties were waived on materials for hotel construction and Cuban contractors with the right [...] "in" [...] made windfalls by importing much more than was needed and selling the surplus to others for hefty profits. It was rumored that besides the U.S. $250,000 to get a license, sometimes more was required under the table. Periodic payoffs were requested and received by corrupt politicians.|$|E
30|$|The {{common thread}} in the ASEAN {{experience}} included; ASEAN economies consistently sought multinational production technology for purpose of modernizing their manufacturing sector with economies undertaking an import-substitution strategy seeking external {{investments in the}} “mainline” development industries such as textile production and automobile assembly, eventually switching to export-promotion stances, seeking multinational enterprises (MNEs) serving global markets; provision of investment incentives and assistance for upgrading of labor skills; and undertaking policies, including lower tariffs or <b>duty-free</b> <b>importation</b> and tax deductions for various categories of costs, to assist companies relocating their production in reducing variable production costs, especially in the sourcing of inputs (Montes 1997).|$|E
40|$|In many African countries, large {{discrepancies}} {{exist between}} revenues implied by published tariff rates multiplied by estimated import volumes and actual receipts. We develop a stylised trade model where average and marginal tariff rates diverge and incorporate insights from this model into a {{computable general equilibrium}} model of an African economy (Mozambique) to study the implications of trade policy reform. Model simulations indicate that lowering tariff rates and reducing <b>duty-free</b> <b>importation</b> {{in a manner that}} maintains official revenue benefit nearly everyone. The main exception is those who benefited from duty-free imports in the base. Copyright 2008 The author 2007.

40|$|In {{the period}} under review trade {{relations}} between the Principality of Moldavia and the Russian Empire experienced a new stage of development. Moldavia continued to import consumer goods from the Russian Empire. The increase in the volume of trade between the Russian Empire and the Romanian Principalities took place after {{the signing of the}} Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca. Trade relations between the Principality of Moldavia and the Russian Empire were based on the Russian-Turkish trade treaty concluded in 1783. Particularly important and especially expensive imported goods were furs. In addition to the furs, there were imported iron and steel products, which competed with the products from Austria. The government of the Russian Empire encouraged the <b>duty-free</b> <b>importation</b> of large quantities of goods from Russia ostensibly for the army, and this caused damage to the Moldavian treasury. An important role in the import of goods from the Russian Empire into the Principality of Moldavia played merchants, especially foreign ones. The analysis showed that furs, canvas, cloth, iron and ironware, linen, and vodka were predominant among these imports. ...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{know the}} {{opinions}} of trainee ophthalmologists on ways to improve cataract surgical rate (CSR) {{with a view to}} having insight into actions that should be of high priority for achieving this improvement. Methods: A survey of 27 trainee ophthalmologists using structured self-administered questionnaire. Results: Most trainees had a positive view about actions towards raising CSR: Structured ophthalmic training- 25 (92. 6 &#x 0025;), monthly cataract camps by eye departments in teaching hospitals- 21 (77. 8 &#x 0025;), rural allowance for ophthalmologists- 26 (96. 3 &#x 0025;) and welfare package for indigent cataract patients- 21 (77. 8 &#x 0025;). Other actions included local production of cataract consumables- 22 (81. 5 &#x 0025;), <b>duty-free</b> <b>importation</b> of ophthalmic materials- 23 (85. 2 &#x 0025;), employment of ophthalmologists in the services of the state governments- 24 (88. 9 &#x 0025;) and local governments- 20 (74. 1 &#x 0025;), effective primary eye care- 25 (92. 6 &#x 0025;) and marketing of cataract surgical services- 23 (85. 2 &#x 0025;). However, only 16 (59. 3 &#x 0025;) trainees wanted first ladies (wives of the president, governors and local government chairmen) to adopt cataract elimination as pet projects, and 24 (88. 9 &#x 0025;) opposed the introduction of cataract surgeons. Conclusion: Most trainees had positive perceptions about most actions that can raise CSR. However, top-priority actions to improve CSR were attractive rural allowance, structured training, resource availability, cost reduction and marketing of cataract surgical services. Multiple actions might be necessary to raise CSR...|$|E
