5|$|This holding {{was based}} upon the well-understood {{governmental}} policy of encouraging the Indian to forgo his wandering habits and adopt those of civilized life; and {{it was said that}} to hold that by so doing he acquired no possessory rights to the lands occupied, to which the government would accord protection, would be contrary to the whole spirit of the traditional American policy toward these dependent wards of the nation. The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>such</b> right of occupancy finds no recognition in any statute or other formal governmental action is not conclusive.|$|E
5|$|The {{university}} has {{been regarded as}} being elitist by some commentators, taking 41% of its undergraduate students from non-state schools, {{according to the most}} recent 2009/2010 figures, despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>such</b> pupils make up just 7% of the population and 18% of 16+ year old pupils across the UK. The intake of state school pupils at Bristol is lower than many Oxbridge colleges. The high ratio of undergraduates from non-state school has led to some tension at the university. In late February and early March 2003, Bristol became embroiled in a row about admissions policies, with some private schools threatening a boycott based on their claims that, in an effort to improve equality of access, the university was discriminating against their students. These claims were hotly denied by the university.|$|E
25|$|That the {{relative}} acceptability of (11c) {{is related to}} a frequency affect is confirmed by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> ordinarily <b>such</b> sentences are judged to be ungrammatical, as shown in (12).|$|R

25|$|Certain glycoproteins, however, behave anomalously on SDS gels. Additionally, the {{analysis}} of larger proteins ranging from 250,000 to 600,000 Da is also reported to be problematic due to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>such</b> polypeptides move improperly in the normally used gel systems.|$|E
25|$|Despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>such</b> data {{provide no}} obvious reason to assume movement, some {{theories}} of syntax maintain a movement {{analysis in the}} interest of remaining consistent. They assume that the wh-subject has in fact moved up the syntactic hierarchy, although this movement is not apparent from the actual linear order of the words.|$|E
25|$|The Wii U {{supports}} online video {{services through}} apps, such as Amazon Video, Crunchyroll, Hulu, Netflix, and YouTube. The Wii U {{does not support}} playback of DVD or Blu-ray Disc; Iwata explained {{that the decision to}} exclude these formats was motivated primarily by patent licensing fees, and the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>such</b> functionality would be redundant to DVD and Blu-ray players that users may already own.|$|E
50|$|The parity hedge {{system is}} a hoax promulgated by Quatloos. Despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> no <b>such</b> system exists (indeed, it is a {{mathematical}} impossibility), several gambling-related web sites have retold the 'parity hedge' story without attribution.|$|R
50|$|Aside {{from the}} <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> no <b>such</b> tribal {{opposition}} has been attested in the ethnographical literature, the phonetic distinction {{it was based}} on probably did not exist, the first term simply representing a mishearing of the second, namely yawiji-baya.|$|R
25|$|Nyíri's {{proposition}} {{was immediately}} criticised by Ottó Gyürk, {{pointing to the}} <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> with <b>such</b> a permissive deciphering method one can get {{anything out of the}} code. Also, the mere <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Nyíri makes an uncritical allusion to the fringe theory that the Hungarian language descended from Sumerian, discredits his enterprise.|$|R
25|$|The {{designation}} {{of the services}} on the line depends on the route they operate. All services terminating at the airport are designated R2 Nord ("R2 North"), whilst the services terminating at Estació de França are designated R2 Sud ("R2 South"). The Nord and Sud designations refer to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>such</b> services mostly run on the line's northern and southern portion, respectively. The through services between Castelldefels and Granollers Centre are simply designated R2.|$|E
25|$|The wastewaters from {{large-scale}} {{industries such as}} oil refineries, petrochemical plants, chemical plants, {{and natural}} gas processing plants commonly contain gross amounts of oil and suspended solids. Those industries use a device known as an API oil-water separator {{which is designed to}} separate the oil and suspended solids from their wastewater effluents. The name is derived from the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>such</b> separators are designed according to standards published by the American Petroleum Institute (API).|$|E
25|$|In the {{relationship}} between preordered sets and interior algebras they correspond to the case where the preorder is an equivalence relation, reflecting the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>such</b> preordered sets provide the Kripke semantics for S5. This also reflects {{the relationship}} between the monadic logic of quantification (for which monadic Boolean algebras provide an algebraic description) and S5 where the modal operators □ (necessarily) and ◊ (possibly) can be interpreted in the Kripke semantics using monadic universal and existential quantification, respectively, without reference to an accessibility relation.|$|E
50|$|Bowen's {{warnings}} were ignored, {{despite the}} <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> withholding <b>such</b> information from shareholders violated the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which he pointed out. Despite his warnings, Citigroup CEO Charles Prince signed a certification {{that the bank}} was {{in compliance with the}} Sarbanes-Oxley Act.|$|R
50|$|From left {{to right}} the peaks are due to 209Po, 210Po, 239Pu and 241Am. The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> {{isotopes}} <b>such</b> as 239Pu and 241Am {{have more than one}} alpha line indicates that the nucleus has the ability to be in different discrete energy levels.|$|R
50|$|Rodgers' {{success was}} {{largely due to}} their early {{innovations}} with solid state analog tone generation technology. Despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> competitors <b>such</b> as Allen switched to digitally synthesized tone generation as early as 1971, Rodgers sold exclusively analog tone generation instruments until 1990.|$|R
25|$|In {{classical}} logic Aristotle's three laws, namely, the excluded middle (p or ¬p), non-contradiction ¬ (p ∧ ¬p) and identity (p iff p), {{are regarded as}} the same, due to the inter-definition of the connectives. Moreover, traditionally contradictoriness (the presence of contradictions in a theory or in a body of knowledge) and triviality (the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>such</b> a theory entails all possible consequences) are assumed inseparable, granted that negation is available. These views may be philosophically challenged, precisely {{on the grounds that}} they fail to distinguish between contradictoriness and other forms of inconsistency.|$|E
25|$|Geoists (Georgists and geolibertarians) {{state that}} {{taxation}} should primarily collect economic rent, {{in particular the}} value of land, for both reasons of economic efficiency as well as morality. The efficiency of using economic rent for taxation is (as economists agree) due to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>such</b> taxation cannot be passed on and does not create any dead-weight loss, and that it removes the incentive to speculate on land. Its morality {{is based on the}} Geoist premise that private property is justified for products of labour but not for land and natural resources.|$|E
25|$|In physics, {{conservation}} laws {{state that}} certain particular measurable properties of an isolated physical system {{do not change}} as the system evolves over time. In 1915, Emmy Noether discovered that underlying each conservation law is a fundamental symmetry of nature. The fact that physical processes don't care where in space they take place (space translation symmetry) yields conservation of momentum, the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>such</b> processes don't care when they take place (time translation symmetry) yields conservation of energy, and so on. In this section, we examine the Newtonian views of conservation of mass, momentum and energy from a relativistic perspective.|$|E
50|$|Following its publication, The Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche {{quickly became}} a popular {{resource}} to scholars and lay audiences alike, though this is likely due to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> few <b>such</b> publications existed at that time. Mencken personally translated The Antichrist for use in his compendium.|$|R
50|$|It {{follows that}} it is {{impossible}} for a function of n variables to be n-th order correlation immune. This also follows from the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> any <b>such</b> function can be written using a Reed-Muller basis as a combination of XORs of the input functions.|$|R
50|$|In {{mathematical}} optimization, the perturbation {{function is}} any function which relates to primal and dual problems. The {{name comes from}} the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> any <b>such</b> function defines a perturbation of the initial problem. In many cases this {{takes the form of}} shifting the constraints.|$|R
25|$|The {{debate about}} the nature of the mind is {{relevant}} to the development of artificial intelligence. If the mind is indeed a thing separate from or higher than the functioning of the brain, then hypothetically it would be much more difficult to recreate within a machine, if it were possible at all. If, on the other hand, the mind is no more than the aggregated functions of the brain, then it will be possible to create a machine with a recognisable mind (though possibly only with computers much different from today's), by simple virtue of the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>such</b> a machine already exists in the form of the human brain.|$|E
25|$|May we not say that, in the fortuitous {{combination}} of the productions of Nature, since only those creatures could survive in whose organizations {{a certain degree of}} adaptation was present, there is nothing extraordinary in the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>such</b> adaptation is actually found in all these species which now exist? Chance, one might say, turned out a vast number of individuals; a small proportion of these were organized in such a manner that the animals' organs could satisfy their needs. A much greater number showed neither adaptation nor order; these last have all perished.... Thus the species which we see today are but a small part of all those that a blind destiny has produced.|$|E
25|$|However, between 1770 and 1774, Fox's {{seemingly}} promising {{career in}} the political establishment was spoiled. In February 1770, Fox {{was appointed to the}} board of the Admiralty by Lord North, but on the 15th of the same month he resigned due to his enthusiastic opposition to the government's Royal Marriages Act, the provisions of which – incidentally – cast doubt on the legitimacy of his parents' marriage. On 28 December 1772, North appointed Fox to the board of the Treasury and again he surrendered his post, in February 1774, over the Government's allegedly feeble response to the contemptuous printing and public distribution of copies of parliamentary debates. Behind these incidents lay his family's resentment towards Lord North for refusing to elevate the Holland barony to an earldom. But the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>such</b> a young man could seemingly treat ministerial office so lightly was noted at court. George III, also observing Fox's licentious private behaviour, took it to be presumption and judged that Fox could not be trusted to take anything seriously.|$|E

25|$|Composition is {{calculated}} from three primary sources: albedo, surface spectrum, and density. The last {{can only be}} determined accurately by observing the orbits of moons the asteroid might have. So far, every asteroid with moons {{has turned out to}} be a rubble pile, a loose conglomeration of rock and metal that may be half empty space by volume. The investigated asteroids are as large as 280km in diameter, and include 121 Hermione (268×186×183km), and 87 Sylvia (384×262×232km). Only half a dozen asteroids are larger than 87 Sylvia, though none of them have moons; however, some smaller asteroids are thought to be more massive, suggesting they may not have been disrupted, and indeed 511 Davida, the same size as Sylvia to within measurement error, is estimated to be two and a half times as massive, though this is highly uncertain. The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>such</b> large asteroids as Sylvia can be rubble piles, presumably due to disruptive impacts, has important consequences for the formation of the Solar System: Computer simulations of collisions involving solid bodies show them destroying each other as often as merging, but colliding rubble piles are more likely to merge. This means that the cores of the planets could have formed relatively quickly.|$|E
25|$|Although bite mark {{analysis}} {{has been used}} in legal proceedings since 1870, it remains a controversial topic due to a variety of factors. DeVore and Barbenel and Evans have shown that the accuracy of a bite mark on skin is limited at best. Skin is not a good medium for dental impressions; it is liable to have a number of irregularities present before the imprint that could cause distortion. Also, bite marks can be altered through stretching, movement or a changing environment during and after the actual bite. Furthermore, the level of distortion tends to increase after the bite mark was made. Both studies suggest that for the bite mark to be accurately analyzed, the body must be examined in exactly the same position it was in when the bite occurred which can be a difficult if not an impossible task to accomplish. Bite mark distortion can rarely be quantified. Therefore, bite marks found at the scene are often analyzed under the assumption that they have undergone minimal distortion. Only limited research has been done in trying to quantify the level of distortion of a bite mark on human skin since the 1970s. The lack of research may largely be due to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>such</b> studies are difficult to organize and are very expensive.|$|E

Among these, the first discovered and the most important for biotechnology is Thermus aquaticus. The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>such</b> bacteria exist also stretches our imagination about life on other celestial bodies, both within and beyond the solar system.|$|E
30|$|The {{explanation}} for these {{results could be}} based on the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> in <b>such</b> geographic areas, the rapid transit systems are crucial for their public transportation system, while in more developed countries it represents only one more valid option, compared to the train or traditional lines.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of {{circular}} orbits, this rate is {{one half of the}} gravity at the orbit. This corresponds to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> for <b>such</b> orbits the total energy is one half of the potential energy, because the kinetic energy is minus one half of the potential energy.|$|R
