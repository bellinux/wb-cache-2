The Wilga 1 prototype exposed a number of design faults, the most serious of which was excessive weight and a rear view restriction such that the crew could not easily see a towed glider.

50|$|The {{smallest}} of designs from Frederick Koolhoven {{when he worked}} for the British Aerial Transport Company was the F.K.28 Crow. It was very small and light. Its tail surfaces were carried by two slim booms. An ABC Gnat 2-cylinder <b>horizontally-opposed</b> <b>engine</b> - together with fuel and oil tanks - was mounted in a pusher configuration on the wing centre section. The pilot's seat was set between the landing gear suspended below the wing. It was designed to be dismantled for road-transport with the removal of twelve bolts. It was displayed at the First Air Traffic Exhibition in Amsterdam, but it did not fly until some time later. It only flew once and proved to be underpowered. It was scrapped in 1920.|$|E

50|$|The L.A.3 Minor {{ultralight}} was {{powered by}} a 35 hp Anzani inverted-vee air-cooled engine, and was of spruce, ply and fabric construction. It was designed by C.H. Latimer-Needham, and built by Luton Aircraft at Barton-in-the-Clay, Bedfordshire in 1936, using the fuselage and components of the earlier experimental L.A.2 tandem-wing aircraft. The prototype L.A.3 Minor, registered G-AEPD, first flew on 3 March 1937 at Heston Aerodrome. The aircraft was a successful flyer despite the low-powered engine, {{and it was then}} redesigned for home construction. Designated the L.A.4 Minor, it had a strutted undercarriage and parallel wing struts. The first L.A.4 Minor was built at the company's new factory (the Phoenix Works) at Gerrards Cross in Buckinghamshire. It was fitted with a 40 hp ABC Scorpion two-cylinder <b>horizontally-opposed</b> <b>engine.</b> All subsequent Luton Minors were home-built from plans sold by the company.The Phoenix Works had burnt down during 1943, and Luton Aircraft had closed, so designer C.H. Latimer-Needham and A.W.J.G. Ord-Hume created a new company in March 1958 to take over the design rights for the Luton Minor. Latimer-Needham updated the design to take more modern lightweight four-cylinder engines and an increased all-up weight. The redesigned aircraft was designated L.A.4A Minor. The design, and subsequently the aircraft, has been built all over the world as a homebuilt aircraft {{with a wide variety of}} engines, with the plans for the aircraft being passed on to the Popular Flying Association (now the Light Aircraft Association) in the UK.|$|E
50|$|The type was {{developed}} by Yeoman Aviation, a company set up by Kingsford Smith Aviation Services Pty. Ltd. (KSA) at Bankstown Airport to engage in agricultural aircraft production. KSA had obtained a number of Wacketts following the type's retirement from Royal Australian Air Force service and had converted four for agricultural use as KS-3 Cropmasters {{in the second half}} of the 1950s. The conversion involved little more than the installation of a hopper located in the rear cockpit of the Wackett, the cutting of a hole in the centre section of the Wackett's wooden wing to allow the dispersal of the chemical load, and re-routing controls to bypass the hopper.By contrast the YA-1 Cropmaster involved major modifications to the Wackett airframe. The Wackett fuselage structure of steel tube was retained but had a 23 cubic ft. (650 litre) capacity hopper in lieu of the Wackett's rear cockpit and different external panels of metal and fibreglass (the Wackett fuselage was fabric covered); the Wackett's wooden wing was replaced by a new metal wing. The first five aircraft retained the Wackett's wooden tail, but subsequent aircraft had a metal tail that featured a stabilator, a swept-back fin and larger rudder. The Wackett's fixed tailwheel undercarriage was retained. The Warner Scarab radial engine of the Wackett was replaced by a <b>horizontally-opposed</b> <b>engine,</b> the YA-1 250 being fitted with a Lycoming O-540 engine of 250hp driving a Hartzell Propeller, while the YA-1 250R was fitted with a Continental IO-470 also developing , driving a Hartzell or McCauley propeller.|$|E

50|$|In the {{prototype}} development stage, {{it was originally}} an air-cooled single-cylinder, borrowing from their current motorcycle products, but a V-twin engine proved more practical. To aid in cooling, a forced air cooling system used a propeller fan to further direct airflow across the cylinders without an encased cooling shroud, and it used a dry sump oil lubrication design. The carburetor used was copied from a Wheeler-Schebler Carburetor Company design in a single barrel carburetor that {{was placed in the}} center behind the V-bank, distributing to the left and right cylinder bank, through a cross-flow cylinder head. The engine was installed suspended above the front wheel differential and in front of the transmission. This arrangement gave the vehicle a higher center of gravity, helping to keep the engine out of river crossing conditions, while it had disadvantages regarding engine vibration as compared with a <b>horizontally-opposed</b> <b>engine</b> layout, but due to Japanese Army requirements, this arrangement was a trade-off, meeting the primary goal set before the development team. The engine layout having a symmetrical implementation with the engine {{directly in front of the}} transmission, with a transfer case providing power to the front wheels installed directly below the engine made manufacture simple to deploy. Because there was a rudimentary production system closely resembling handmade assembly, minor changes took place to various aspects of the car as the need arose, with the early prototype two-door enclosed sedan evolving into a roadster. While some vehicles over time had body changes, many of the production cars were not installed with doors, and the canvas roof for the two-door and four-door vehicles aided in reducing overall weight and adding flexibility to conditions in the field.|$|E
50|$|The Nieuport II was {{the subject}} of {{extensive}} research carried out by the Nieuport brothers in conjunction with the Eiffel Laboratories and benefitted from input from Robert Esnault-Pelterie, who had designed his own low-drag monoplane. The result was a wire-braced monoplane with only a single pair of bracing wires on each side, supplemented with a single pair of control wires to warp the wings for lateral control. The airfoil section was unusual in having a fairly thick (for the period), but sharp leading edge, with the undersides rising up to thin the airfoil out over the majority of the chord. The upper wires led to a pyramidal cabane and the pilot was nearly fully enclosed in the fuselage, with only his head exposed. Initially the undercarriage consisted of a single central skid attached to the fuselage by two inverted V struts, bearing a transverse leaf spring with a wheel on each end. When first flown the tail surfaces consisted of a semicircular horizontal stabiliser mounted on top of the rear of the fuselage, behind which was a universally-jointed assembly combining a rectangular elevator with a pair of rudders. The controls used the joystick to provide yaw (rudder) and pitch (elevator) control, while foot pedals operated the wing warping for lateral control, the pedals moving a torque tube which ran diagonally backwards to the rear v-strut of the undercarriage, where the warping wires were attached. Late examples were available with the modern arrangement as a factory option, using the pedals to control the rudder, as was used on the contemporary Blériot and Deperdussin aircraft. A variety of engines were used, starting with the Darracq, which, despite being developed specifically for Nieuport, proved unsatisfactory, and a variety of engines were tried before the Nieuport brothers developed their own twin-cylinder, <b>horizontally-opposed</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|E

40|$|The goal {{of cooling}} {{installation}} design {{is to provide}} adequate cooling air flow to the engine with a minimum drag penalty. To achieve this goal, attention {{must be given to}} certain aerodynamic factors involved in the design problem. In the present paper, the factors which influence the aerodynamic design of <b>horizontally-opposed</b> <b>engine</b> cooling installations are discussed with particular reference to the performance of the aircraft in terms of the dynamic pressure generated for the power output of the engine, the gains or losses through the propeller, proper inlet design, altitude effects on the orifice characteristics of the engine, and exit area sizing. Results of a flight research program showed that the inlet design has a significant influence on cooling effectiveness and drag; the inlet should be designed for low velocity ratios and should avoid small radii of curvature in its geometry. The influence of the propeller on the inlet appears to cause the stagnation point on the lip to move toward the inside...|$|E
