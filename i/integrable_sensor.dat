40|$|In today's world, {{daily life}} is {{influenced}} significantly by the connectivity between millions {{of individuals and}} devices all around the world, which exchange information and data via the internet. The main architecture in which all internet-enabled objects are connected is called the Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT has various applications in smart cities, smart farming, smart industry, e-health, etc. In the case of smart cities, the IoT e. g. enables to improve the citizens’ quality of life, {{as well as to}} facilitate urban services. In smart homes, as another example, the objective is, amongst others, to reduce the energy consumption of a building. In order to realize the desired level of quality of IoT services, a first challenge is a need for a reliable, secure and user-friendly interconnection between hardware and software layers. Although individual layers can be designed independently, the related interconnections cause challenges in terms of interoperability of heterogeneous systems using different communication technologies, security and privacy, etc. A second important challenge is the implementation of a low-power, low-cost communication device, which enables the different IoT nodes to interact with each other. To accelerate the above described IoT paradigm, this thesis aims to overcome some of the bottlenecks for IoT implementations in smart home and eHealth applications. First, we discuss the interoperability of heterogeneous devices applied in a smart home platform together with the design of a low-power sensor node for a multi-standard event-driven energy management system. The developed energy management system at both software and hardware layers uses wireless sensor networks (WSN) to improve the energy efficiency of a building without construction work needed. At the software level, various communications technologies have been integrated into the same middleware by utilizing an integration layer as an interface between the hardware and the software. This middleware allows the exploitation of both existing and future emerging wired and wireless technologies. In order to add a power-efficient technology to the existing wireless solutions, we have developed a prototype of a low-energy wireless sensor node based on pulsed UWB communication. The UWB transceiver has been designed and implemented at both system and circuit level. The radio system comprises an integrated low-power transmitter fabricated in 130 nm CMOS technology. It generates a signal with a 1. 1 ns pulse width in the 3 - 5 GHz band and consumes only 39 μW at a 1 Mbps rate. To enable data reception, a commercial off-the-shelf-component receiver has been implemented and directly interfaced with the data management system. The pulsed UWB design consumes only 5. 31 nJ per transmitted bit which presents a ten times better DC energy consumption per pulse compared to the other off-the-shelf products integrated into the same middleware The developed demonstrator is the first example of an IoT system based on pulsed UWB technology directly interfaced with a multi-standard centralized system. As an example of an IoT application, a heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) control strategy has been developed that uses the information of the deployed sensor nodes. These sensor nodes are used to measure the temperature of several rooms, as well as the energy consumption of heating and cooling appliances. The system has been tested experimentally in an office setting. For this experiment, an average energy savings of 71 % has been achieved during the test period of three days in summer. A low-cost implementation is crucial for IoT sensor nodes. To this end, this thesis also targeted a fully digital implementation of the communication transceiver, to achieve low-cost and technology-scalable sensor nodes. The second part of this thesis, therefore, describes the system and circuit-level design of a fully-digital asynchronous UWB receiver compliant with the IEEE 802. 15. 6 standard, targeting a wireless body area network for eHealth applications. The fully-digital receiver implemented in 65 nm CMOS technology uses inverter amplifiers in the RF front-end to convert RF UWB signals centered at 4 GHz to digital pulses for demodulation in the baseband. The event-driven and asynchronous baseband demodulates the incoming signals. To benefit from the pulsed nature of the impulse UWB signals for power reduction, a duty-cycling control unit has been designed and implemented. It enables not only the periodic switching of the receiver’s front-end but also provides IEEE 802. 15. 6 standard compliance to the receiver. The duty-cycling control works asynchronously to the transmitter using a local low-power all-digital oscillator, hence avoiding the need for a high power reference oscillator. The prototype fully digital receiver has been implemented in 65 nm CMOS technology. Based on the simulation results, the fully digital receiver demonstrates a sensitivity of - 91 dBm with a gain of 110 dB in the front-end. The receiver consumes an average power of 18. 5 mW. The measured duty cycle of 18. 75 % for the receiver with an overhead power consumption of 74 µW has been achieved in the duty cycling block. This thesis hence proposes two IR-UWB systems for two different IoT applications. The focus was on overcoming interoperability issues and enabling low-cost implementations of the IoT sensor nodes. This brings us one step closer to the ultimate goal of having low-power, low-cost autonomous, reconfigurable and easily <b>integrable</b> <b>sensor</b> nodes {{for a wide variety of}} IoT applications. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{the past}} half century the IC {{technology}} could produce an unprecedented growth and penetration into all segments of our daily life due to the achieved extreme productivity and reliability by using well established and continuously refined processing platforms. This uninterrupted trend continued also {{with the advent of the}} More than Moore-type MEMS technology allowing the combination of the signal processing capability of the mature IC technology with the exploitation of mechanical, thermal, optical properties of the materials used in IC technology in different sensing and actuation purposes. Mass producibility by monolithic integration required here also the development of appropriate unified set of techniques for the various applications, i. e. sort of standardised platforms to explore.

40|$|The {{principal}} {{concerns in}} driving safety with standard vehicles or cybercars are understanding and preventing risky situations. A {{close examination of}} accident data reveals that losing control of the vehicle {{is the main reason}} for most car accidents. To help to prevent such accidents, vehicle-control systems may be used, which require certain input data concerning vehicledynamic parameters and vehicle-road interaction. Unfortunately, some fundamental parameters, like tire-road forces and sideslip angle are difficult to measure in a car, for both technical and economic reasons. Therefore, this study presents a dynamic modeling and observation method to estimate these variables. One of the major contributions of this study, with respect to our previous work and to the largest literature in the field of the lateral dynamic estimation, is the fact that lateral tire force at each wheel is discussed in details. To address system nonlinearities and unmodeled dynamics, two observers derived from extended and unscented Kalman filtering techniques are proposed and compared. The estimation process method is based on the dynamic response of a vehicle instrumented with available and potentially <b>integrable</b> <b>sensors.</b> Performances are tested using an experimental car. Experimental results demonstrate the ability of this approach to provide accurate estimations, and show its practical potential as a low-cost solution for calculating lateral tire forces and sideslip angle.

Sandia-designed prototype chemical sensor systems are undergoing extended field testing supported by DOE and other government agencies. A required surety component will be verification of microanalytical system performance, which {{can be achieved by}} providing a programmable source of chemical signature(s) for autonomous calibration of analytical systems. In addition, such a controlled chemical source could be used to dispense microaliquots of derivatization reagents, extending the analysis capability of chemical sensors to a wider range of targets. We have developed a microfabricated system for controlled release of selected compounds (calibrants) into the analytical stream of microsensor systems. To minimize pumping and valve requirements of microfluidic systems, and to avoid degradation issues associated with storage of dilute solutions, we have utilized thermally labile organic salts as solid-phase reservoir materials. Reproducible deposition of tetrapropyl ammonium hydroxide onto arrays of microfabricated heating elements can provide a pair of calibration marker compounds (one fast and one slow-eluting compound) for GC analyses. The use of this microaliquot gas source array for hydrogen generation is currently under further development. The goal of the latter effort will be to provide a source of high-pressure, low viscosity GC carrier gas for Sandia's next-generation microfabricated gas-phase chemical analysis systems...|$|R
40|$|Substrate Temperature Control with Fuzzy Logic: On-chip <b>integrable</b> gas <b>sensors</b> show {{temperature}} dependent characteristics, forcing {{users to}} keep {{the temperature of the}} sensors at a constant level, but also allowing increased accurcy and selectivity of gas classification by deliberate temperature changes. Problems with modelling and integrability are easier to solve by implementation of a fuzzy controller, but there remains a substantial hardware effort on the chip. As a result the layout of a chip was developed with areas whose temperature can be independently controlled. These areas can be utilized by any user to stabilize temperature dependent circuits or to test their behaviour at varying temperatures. Combined Neuro/Fuzzy Signal Processing: In applications of gas sensors their output signals depend on parasitic influences like air humidity, temperature deviations or the age of the sensor. The development of a gas classifier based on statistical methods involves through the necessary number of samples considerable time and cost. With fuzzy methods a gas classifier can be easier constructed; additional results, like p. e. the reliability of the classification, may be used in safety relevent applications. Fuzzy logic is equally suited to mutual monitoring of gas sensors in a multiple sensor system. A functional working model of such a fuzzy state identification system was completed. (orig.)

40|$|We {{propose a}} novel concept for an <b>integrable</b> and {{flexible}} <b>sensor</b> capable to visualize mechanical impacts on lightweight structures by quenching the photoluminescence (PL) of CdSe quantum dots. Considering the requirements such as visibility, storage time and high optical contrast of PL quenching with low power consumption, we have investigated a symmetrical and an asymmetrical layer stack consisting of semiconductor organic N,N,N′,N′-Tetrakis(3 -methylphenyl) - 3, 3 ′-dimethylbenzidine (HMTPD) and CdSe quantum dots with elongated CdS shell. Time-resolved series of PL spectra from layer stacks with applied voltages of different polarity and simultaneous observation of power consumption {{have shown that}} a variety of mechanisms such as photo-induced charge separation and charge injection, cause PL quenching. However, mechanisms such as screening of external field as well as Auger-assisted charge ejection is working contrary to that. Investigations regarding the influence of illumination revealed that the positive biased asymmetrical layer stack is the preferred sensor configuration, due to a charge carrier injection at voltages of 10 V without the need of coincident illumination...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWound {{infection}} monitoring is {{a challenging}} task. It is only solvable by designing an <b>integrable</b> and cost-efficient <b>sensor</b> which measures a relevant set of parameters. One viable parameter is {{the formation of}} neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Their task is trapping pathogens in the wound. A wound infection results in massive release of them which can be detected with impedimetric methods. Our investigations focused on the characterization of the biological process with an in vitro model. The model environment is a cell culture with neutrophil granulocytes cultured on interdigitated electrodes which represent the sensor surface. Detected impedance changes caused by NET-formation were {{in the range of}} 35 % and even higher. This implies that impedance measurements are suitable for NET detection. We derived a measurement and evaluated it by differing conditions like changing stimulation agent and varying the cell number. For both conditions the results of impedance and phase angle deviation can be confirmed. In combination with other parameters a sensor can be designed for specific detection of wound infections. These aspects are integrated in our sensor concept...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{applications}} of functional granular (0 - 3) nanocomposites require a precise tailoring of the composite morphology, filling factor, electrical properties and chemical composition. In Part I {{of this work}} a versatile deposition concept for the tailoring of 0 - 3 nanocomposites is elaborated and a respective deposition system is constructed. Ceramic-based 0 - 3 nanocomposites with embedded metallic magnetic particles are chosen to demonstrate the feasibility of the deposition concept. Aiming at functional 0 - 3 nanocomposites for high-k and magnetoelectric (ME) materials, aluminum nitride (AlN) is chosen as the matrix and cobalt (Co) for the particulate phase. Suitable deposition processes for the individual composite constituents are developed and the resulting piezoelectric AlN films and magnetic Co nanoparticles are characterized. Finally, 0 - 3 AlN/Co nanocomposites are produced and investigated regarding their suitability for high-k and ME applications. An increase of by up to a factor of 30 indicates {{the potential of the}} concept for the PVD preparation of high-k materials. Regarding the design of high-performance ME materials, several inherent challenges of the 0 - 3 nanocomposite approach with metallic particles are identified and existing literature is critically reviewed. The ME investigation is conducted {{within the framework of the}} SFB 855 “Magnetoelectric Composites - Future Biomagnetic Interfaces” which aims at the development of highly sensitive ME sensors especially for biomagnetic applications. The SFB not only focuses on the design of suitable ME materials, but also on the development of new sensor concepts. Accordingly, in Part II a novel sensor concept based on MEMS technology and the delta-E effect is presented. The demonstrator consists of a tipless AFM microcantilever with a resonance frequency of approximately 300 kHz which is excited mechanically. The resonator’s eigenfrequency can be shifted by an external magnetic field as the amorphous (Fe 90 Co 10) 12 Si 12 B 10 functional coating exhibits the delta-E effect. The demonstrator is shown to detect magnetic fields as low as 400 nT at biomagnetically relevant frequencies. It furthermore requires no cooling, possesses vector-field capability and is potentially fully <b>integrable.</b> Prospective optimized <b>sensors</b> based on the proposed concept are estimated to detect fields of 100 pT or below, rendering them relevant for medical applications like advanced drug delivery or in-vivo imaging...|$|R
