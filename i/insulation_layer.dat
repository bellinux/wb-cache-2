500|$|Water {{and carbon}} dioxide are {{metabolic}} end products of oxidation of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates. Oxidising a gram of carbohydrate produces 0.60 grams of water; a gram of protein produces 0.41 grams of water; and a gram of fat produces 1.07 grams of water, {{making it possible for}} xerocoles to live with little or no access to drinking water. The kangaroo rat for example makes use of this water of metabolism and conserves water both by having a low basal metabolic rate and by remaining underground during the heat of the day, reducing loss of water through its skin and respiratory system when at rest. Herbivorous mammals obtain moisture from the plants they eat. Species such as the addax antelope, dik-dik, Grant's gazelle and oryx are so efficient at doing this that they apparently never need to drink. The camel is a superb example of a mammal adapted to desert life. It minimizes its water loss by producing concentrated urine and dry dung, and is able to lose 40% of its body weight through water loss without dying of dehydration. Carnivores can obtain much of their water needs from the body fluids of their prey. Many other hot desert animals are nocturnal, seeking out shade during the day or dwelling underground in burrows. At depths of more than [...] , these remain at between [...] regardless of the external temperature. Jerboas, desert rats, kangaroo rats and other small rodents emerge from their burrows at night and so do the foxes, coyotes, jackals and snakes that prey on them. Kangaroos keep cool by increasing their respiration rate, panting, sweating and moistening the skin of their forelegs with saliva. Mammals living in cold deserts have developed greater insulation through warmer body fur and insulating layers of fat beneath the skin. The arctic weasel has a metabolic rate that is two or three times as high as would be expected for an animal of its size. Birds have avoided the problem of losing heat through their feet by not attempting to maintain them at the same temperature as the rest of their bodies, a form of adaptive insulation. The emperor penguin has dense plumage, a downy under layer, an air <b>insulation</b> <b>layer</b> next the skin and various thermoregulatory strategies to maintain its body temperature in one of the harshest environments on Earth.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Cryoablation for the {{treatment}} of cardiac arrhyth-mias inactivates the electrical conduction of arrhythmogenic tissue by freezing. This method has major advantages but also disadvantages compared to radiofrequency ablation. Modeling and simulation of the cryoablation process can be used to reduce the intervention duration and optimize the cryoablation result. In this work, different variants of cryo loops are modeled and simulated using the Finite Element Method. As the wall of the applicator tube has the same thickness in all dimensions the ablation efficiency in tissue direction is reduced by the heating flux of the streaming blood surrounding the applicator. The effects of different <b>insulation</b> <b>layers</b> in blood direction are compared by using heat flux estimations on stationary temperature distributions. As the applicator tube and the <b>insulation</b> <b>layers</b> consist of different fiber materials, anisotropic thermal conductivity is considered in the models. The estimation of thermal longitudinal and transversal conduc-tivity values by a material modeling approach is presented in detail. It is concluded that <b>insulation</b> <b>layers</b> can have positive and unexpected negative effects depending on the insulation position.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} requirements to existing heat-insulation layers in enclosure structures of wall panels has been carried out, a general principles on development of thermal insulation systems, substantiation on the necessity {{to develop a new}} wall panel design with improved thermal characteristics. The proposed design of the wall panel differs from the existing one in the fact that its external layer is made of protective sheets being perforated in their top and bottom parts with perforated aluminum foil layer placed on them. Air layer performs function of one of thermal <b>insulation</b> <b>layers,</b> and the second layer is made up in the form of several micro-modular sub-layers which are divided by perforated aluminum foil and a grid. An inner concrete layer is also separated from micro-modular layers by aluminum foil. Protective sheets and the grid can be made of aluminum or polyethylene. The arrangement of hollow micro-modular cells in the zone of negative temperatures prevents condensate accumulation. The arrangement of the perforated aluminum foil layers between micro- modular layers leads to increase in thermal resistance of the panel due to decrease of a radiant component in presence of several screens and does not interfere with a vapor permeability of thermal <b>insulation</b> <b>layers</b> from micro-modules. At the same time placement of a non-perforated foil layer on an inside panel layer interferes with penetration of water vapor from rooms in micro-modular thermal <b>insulation</b> <b>layers.</b> Technological principles lie in the arrangement of perforation slots in the top and bottom zones of protective sheets that allows to delete excess moisture from thermal <b>insulation</b> <b>layers</b> and air layer and also leads to improvement of thermo-technical characteristics, durability and reliability in construction operation as a whole. The executed calculations of heat and humidity fields in external enclosure structures confirm advantages of the presented technical solution. </p...|$|R

40|$|Within {{this work}} an {{intensive}} study concerning the electrical insulation of dielectric passivation layers is carried out. Therefore, metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) structures are manufactured.

The shift in the voltage drop across the insulating layer therefore reduces the contact angle of the droplet as a function of the light intensity.

Control of the optical beam results in control of the droplet's movement.|$|E
