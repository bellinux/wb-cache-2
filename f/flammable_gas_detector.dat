40|$|The use of <b>flammable</b> <b>gas</b> {{and high}} voltage in {{detector}} systems {{is common in}} many experiments at Fermilab. To mitigate the hazards associated with these systems, Fermilab Engineering Standard SD- 45 B (Ref. 1) was adopted. Since this note {{is meant to be}} a guide and not a mandatory standard, each experiment is reviewed for compliance with SD- 45 B by the <b>flammable</b> <b>gas</b> safety subcommittee. Currently, there are only two types of <b>flammable</b> <b>gas</b> in use, ethane (Appendix A) and methane (Appendix B). The worst flammable-gas case is C 2 H 6 (ethane), which has an estimated flow rate that is 73 % of the CH 4 (methane) flow but a heat of combustion (in kcal/g-mole) that is 173 % of that of methane. In the worst case, if ethane were to spew through its restricting orifice into its gas line at 0 psig and then through a catastrophic leak into Room 215 (TRD) or Room 511 (CDC/FDCNTX), the time that would be required to build up a greater than Class 1 inventory (0. 4 kg H 2 equivalent) would be 5. 2 hours (Ref. 2). Therefore a worst-case <b>flammable</b> <b>gas</b> leak would have to go undetected for over 5 hours in order to transform a either mixing room to an environment with a Risk Class greater than Class 1. The mixing systems, <b>gas</b> lines, and <b>detectors</b> themselves will be thoroughly leak checked prior to active service. All vessels {{that are part of the}} mixing systems will be protected from overpressure by safety valves vented outside the building. Both the input and output of all detector volumes are protected from overpressure in the same way. The volume immediately outside the central tracking detectors is continuously purged by nitrogen from boiloff from the main nitrogen dewar at the site. However, if <b>flammable</b> <b>gas</b> were to build up in the mixing rooms or particular detector areas, no matter how unlikely, <b>flammable</b> <b>gas</b> <b>detectors</b> that are part of the interlock chain of each gas mixing system will shut down the appropriate system. This includes shutting off the output of <b>flammable</b> <b>gas</b> manifolds within the gas shed. Similarly, if a fire were to break out anywhere in the D-ZERO Hall, fire sensors would stop the output of all <b>flammable</b> <b>gas</b> manifolds within the gas shed, by unpowering electrically controlled solenoid valves that are normally closed in the event of a power failure. Fire sensor contacts have not yet been installed...|$|R
40|$|Objectives] The {{electric}} propulsion dual-fuel engine is becoming dominant in newly built Liquefied Natural Gas(LNG) carriers. To avoid the potential risks that accompany {{the use of}} flammable and explosive boil-off gas,the performance of precise safety and reliability assessments is indispensable. [Methods] This research concerns the engine rooms of large LNG carriers which are propelled electrically by a dual-fuel engine. Possible fuel gas(natural gas) leak cases in {{different areas of the}} engine room are simulated and analyzed. Five representative leak cases defined by leak form,leak location and leak rate are entered into a Computational Fluid Dynamics(CFD) simulation,in which the Reynolds stress model of Fluent software is adopted as the turbulence model. The results of the leaked gas distribution and ventilation velocity field are analyzed in combination to obtain the diffusion tendency and concentration distribution of leaked gas in different areas. [Results] Based on an analysis of the results,an optimized arrangement of <b>flammable</b> <b>gas</b> <b>detectors</b> is provided for the engine room, and the adoption of an explosion-proof exhaust fan is proven to be unnecessary. [Conclusions] These analysis methods can provide a reference for similar gas leakage scenarios occurring in confined ventilated spaces. In addition, the simulation results can be used to quantitatively assess potential fire or explosion damage in order to guide the design of structural reinforcements...|$|R

We propose the design and implementation of a readout system based on feedback heat pulses. In the proposed system, the heat of catalysis is directly measured via its compensation by a controlled feedback heat power. Contrary to that proposed sensor operation, previous potentiometric schemes would measure a sensor temperature increase resulting from the heat of catalysis. This proposed readout scheme for so-called "pellistor" sensors is expected to improve the measurement performance while providing a simpler implementation than previous systems...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} categorizes each of {{the large}} waste storage tanks into one of several categories based on each tank's waste characteristics. These waste group assignments reflect a tank's propensity to retain a significant volume of <b>flammable</b> <b>gases</b> and {{the potential of the}} waste to release retained gas by a buoyant displacement event. Revision 7 is the annual update of the calculations of the <b>flammable</b> <b>gas</b> Waste Groups for DSTs and SSTs. The Hanford Site contains 177 large underground radioactive waste storage tanks (28 double-shell tanks and 149 single-shell tanks). These tanks are categorized into one of three waste groups (A, B, and C) based on their waste and tank characteristics. These waste group assignments reflect a tank's propensity to retain a significant volume of <b>flammable</b> <b>gases</b> and the potential of the waste to release retained gas by a buoyant displacement gas release event. Assignments of waste groups to the 177 double-shell tanks and single-shell tanks, as reported in this document, are based on a Monte Carlo analysis of three criteria. The first criterion is the headspace <b>flammable</b> <b>gas</b> concentration following release of retained gas. This criterion determines whether the tank contains sufficient retained gas such that the well-mixed headspace <b>flammable</b> <b>gas</b> concentration would reach 100 % of the lower flammability limit if the entire tank's retained gas were released. If the volume of retained gas is not sufficient to reach 100 % of the lower flammability limit, then flammable conditions cannot be reached and the tank is classified as a waste group C tank independent of the method the gas is released. The second criterion is the energy ratio and considers whether there is sufficient supernatant on top of the saturated solids such that gas-bearing solids have the potential energy required to break up the material and release gas. Tanks that are not waste group C tanks and that have an energy ratio < 3. 0 do not have sufficient potential energy to break up material and release gas and are assigned to waste group B. These tanks are considered to represent a potential induced <b>flammable</b> <b>gas</b> release hazard, but no spontaneous buoyant displacement <b>flammable</b> <b>gas</b> release hazard. Tanks that are not waste group C tanks and have an energy ratio {ge} 3. 0, but that pass the third criterion (buoyancy ratio < 1. 0, see below) are also assigned to waste group B. Even though the designation as a waste group B (or A) tank identifies the potential for an induced <b>flammable</b> <b>gas</b> release hazard, the hazard only exists for specific operations that can release the retained gas in the tank at a rate and quantity that results in reaching 100 % of the lower flammability limit in the tank headspace. The identification and evaluation of tank farm operations that could cause an induced <b>flammable</b> <b>gas</b> release hazard in a waste group B (or A) tank are included in other documents. The third criterion is the buoyancy ratio. This criterion addresses tanks that are not waste group C double-shell tanks and have an energy ratio {ge} 3. 0. For these double-shell tanks, the buoyancy ratio considers whether the saturated solids can retain sufficient gas to exceed neutral buoyancy relative to the supernatant layer and therefore have buoyant displacement gas release events. If the buoyancy ratio is {ge} 1. 0, that double-shell tank is assigned to waste group A. These tanks are considered to have a potential spontaneous buoyant displacement <b>flammable</b> <b>gas</b> release hazard in addition to a potential induced <b>flammable</b> <b>gas</b> release hazard...|$|R
