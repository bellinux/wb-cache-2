40|$|Irrigation is the {{application}} of water to soil {{for the purpose of}} supplying moisture necessary for the growth of a crop. Irrigation has been practiced since the beginning of civilization and its importance in the present world is well recognized as a means of developing a profitable agriculture. The rapid growth in the world population and the consequent need for additional food supplies are making irrigation absolutely necessary in the world today. In surface <b>irrigation</b> <b>by</b> <b>flooding,</b> two general methods are used; uncontrolled flooding or controlled flooding. In irrigating by uncontrolled flooding, or wild flooding, water is applied to an area which has undergone no prior land preparation. In most cases, this unsystematic method produces inefficient irrigation. Low spots in the field are over-irrigated whereas high areas are under-irrigated. In the controlled flooding method, predetermined rates and quantities of water are applied to areas which have been prepared for irrigation. This method of irrigation includes border dyke, border ditch, and border check systems. For proper design of these systems, the size of stream is balanced against the intake rate of the soil, the total depth of water to be stored in the root zone, and the area to be covered by the stream. With the completion of the South Saskatchewan Dam, it is expected that the irrigated acreage of the province will increase substantially. Further, it is expected that most of the new area coming under irrigation will be irrigated by some surface irrigation method. One of the most common and diversified of the surface irrigation methods, which is adaptable to both close growing and row crops, is the border dyke or border strip method. In this method, water is introduced to land which is bounded by low, flat levees or dykes which extend {{in the direction of the}} steepest slope. The present procedures used in design of border dyke systems 2. are empirical. The experimental data reported in the literature were obtained from systems whose soils, topography and other conditions differ widely from those which will be encountered in the South Saskatchewan River Development Project. Thus, it is questionable whether these data can be applied directly to the design of systems in Saskatchewan. There is a great need for experimental data from systems installed on areas which are similar to those that will be encountered under the proposed project. The study reported in this thesis was undertaken in an attempt to satisfy some of these needs. Experimental data collected from existing border dyke systems located in Saskatchewan are presented. In addition, a rational approach for evaluating several factors affecting the design of these systems for example, soil intake rate, is given...|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, Hillel began {{developing}} the concept behind drip irrigation. Drip irrigation involved shifting from low-frequency, high-volume irrigation to high-frequency, low-volume <b>irrigation.</b> <b>By</b> eliminating inefficient <b>flooding</b> techniques, and instead more precisely gauging the necessary water supply, Hillel's innovation allowed farmers to irrigate their crops more consistently and efficiently while using less water. Plastic tubing invented in the 1960s made the concept even more effective. The tubes were perforated and placed near the target crop, reducing evaporation and excess water waste while also preventing salts and unwanted minerals from leaching into the soil.|$|R

40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} at the Research area, College of Agriculture, Dera Ghazi Khan to measure the response of spring sowing sunflower to foliar application of abscisic acid (ABA) and potassium chloride under drought. In the experiment four <b>irrigations</b> <b>by</b> <b>flooding</b> (25 days after sowing, at bud initiation, at anthesis and at achene formation stage) were applied in control. Foliar application of 2 μM ABA and 1 % KCl was made at anthesis stage of sunflower hybrids (NK- 265 and SF- 187) after skipping the irrigation. Foliar application of 2 μM ABA and 1 % solution of KCl under drought at anthesis stage significantly increased achene yield and oil yield over skipping irrigation with no ABA and no KCl at anthesis stage. Sunflower hybrid NK- 265 showed better drought tolerance compared with SF- 187 with foliar application of ABA as well as KCl because it showed improvement in growth and yield. Sunflower hybrids NK- 265 had significantly increased achene yield and oil yield than SF- 187. Drought stress at anthesis stage to sunflower hybrids showed decrease in agronomic parameters and foliar application of ABA as well as KCl under water deficits improved them. ABA as well as KCl application to sunflower hybrids at anthesis under drought improved achene oil content but decreased achene protein content. Exogenous application of ABA or KCl to NK- 265 under drought showed more percent increased in achene yield and oil yield than SF- 187 over no ABA and no KCl application. Foliar application of ABA as well as KCl on leaf score at anthesis stage was non-significant. It is, therefore, suggested that foliar application of 2 μM ABA and 1 % solution of KCl under drought at anthesis stage significantly increased achene yield and oil yield over skipping irrigation, no ABA and no KCl at anthesis stage. Sunflower hybrid NK- 265 showed better improvement of drought tolerance by foliar application of ABA as well as KCl than SF- 187 because it showed more improvement in growth and yield...|$|R

This developed methodology takes advantage of geographic information systems software to integrate its strength to manage the flood impacts. This approach is of dual purpose: first, to reduce the flash flood hazard of hill torrents; and second, {{to make use of}} flood water as a source of <b>irrigation</b> <b>by</b> conserving <b>flood</b> water in an earthen reservoir. The developed integrated methodology works as a decision-making system for selection of best site selection for earthen reservoir. The results for three potential sites for earthen reservoir supports in a decision-making process for best site for reservoir by analysing calculations for storage capacity, earthen works, and lengths of canals from reservoirs to agricultural land. This study investigated that the tools of geoinformatics have the potential to resolve the engineering challenges linked with mitigation of flood hazards. It is evident from the study that practical considerations for future turn the study into an informational tool to mitigate flood...|$|R
40|$|In India wheat is {{conventionally}} {{planted on}} flat-bed and <b>irrigation</b> is applied <b>by</b> <b>flooding,</b> {{which results in}} low water-use efficiency. Efficient use of irrigation water is a major researchable issue in most command areas for improving crop productivity. Resource conservation technologies aimed at improving productivity and water-use efficiency such as raised-bed planting have been found useful in wide row crops like maize, cotton, sunflower, sugarcane, etc. However, such information is not available for a relatively narrow row crop like wheat. A field experiment was conducted during 2002 – 04 at New Delhi on a sandy loam soil to evaluate the performance of wheat crop under resource conservation techniques (RCTs), viz. furrow-irrigated raised-bed (FIRB), broad-bed and furrow (BBF), raised-bed and sunken-bed (RBSB) and conventional flat-bed (FB) in main plots, and 4 irrigation regimes, viz. irrigation only at crown root initiation (CRI); irrigation at 0. 9 and 1. 2 IW/CPE (irrigation water/cumulative pan evaporation) ratio and irrigations at six critical physiological growth stages in subplots. Wheat performed equally well under all the RCTs with respect to grain yield. The maximum grain yield was recorded under 1. 2 IW/CPE ratio, which was at par with 6 irrigations at critical growth stages, but significantly higher than 0. 9 IW/CPE and one irrigation at CRI. Bed planting techniques involving FIRB and BBF recorded significantly lower consumptive use (CU) of water than RBSB and FB. There was saving of 18. 2 to 19. 5 % <b>irrigation</b> water <b>by</b> adopting FIRB compared to FB with flood irrigation. Water-use efficiency under FIRB and BBF was 8. 3 – 22. 8 and 4. 9 – 24. 8 % higher respectively over the FB with flooding...|$|R

The results show the variation of peak value of concentration of NH 4 +-N in topsoil is: drip <b>irrigation</b> <b>by</b> reclaimed water > drip <b>irrigation</b> <b>by</b> 50 % reclaimed water > drip <b>irrigation</b> <b>by</b> groundwater, the concentration of NH 4 +-N is higher at the depth of 0 - 40 cm with almost no accumulation of NH 4 +-N below the depth of 40 cm NO 3 -N presence in soil slightly increases across the entire growth period with <b>irrigation</b> <b>by</b> reclaimed water. <b>Irrigation</b> <b>by</b> reclaimed water increases tomato yield and irrigation water use efficiency, and has an improved taste index indicated by an improved soluble sugar and titratable acidity content of the fruit without any obvious adverse influence on the nutritive indexes such as Vc soluble solid. The shortening of the irrigation period and increase in buried depth of drip irrigation tape are to promote an increase in tomato yield and irrigation water use efficiency to carry out drip <b>irrigation</b> <b>by</b> reclaimed water under the condition of having a shorter irrigation period and a greater depth of drip irrigation tape and to yield a higher rate of water conservation.

40|$|To {{provide an}} {{ecological}} {{basis for the}} regeneration and the sustainable use of the vegetation at the transition between eases and sandy desert, a joint European-Chinese research project is being conducted at the southern fringe of the Central-Asian Taklamakan desert (Xinjiang, China). The investigations are being carried out at five study sites located in the foreland of the river oasis of Qira (Cele). Four of these sites are dominated by one species each, which is indigenous on a local (Alhagi sparsifolia, Populus diversifolia, Tarmarix ramosissima) or regional scale (Calligonum spec.). The fifth site is free of vegetation. Subsequent to <b>irrigation</b> performed <b>by</b> artificial <b>flooding,</b> {{the effects of the}} consecutive desiccation and of harvest on the water relations of soil and plants (including water-use efficiency and drought tolerance), the demand and turnover of nutrients (especially of nitrogen) and productivity of the respective species are being investigated.

Concomitantly, socio-economic inquiries are being performed to register the population's demand for plant resources and to provide a basis for the calculation of the management costs. The results of the study should provide a basis for the regeneration of that kind of vegetation which is best suited to meet the population's demand for plant resources and shelter from sand drift.
