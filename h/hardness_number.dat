40|$|International audienceBased on the {{relation}} proposed by Tabor in 1951, which connects the {{ultimate tensile strength}} and the yield stress of classical materials to the Brinell or Vickers <b>hardness</b> <b>numbers</b> by a simple factor of proportionality, we propose an extended analytical model for {{the determination of the}} yield stress of brittle materials using nanoindentation data. This model considers the nanoindentation hardness calculated from the projected actual contact area between the indenter and the material which is representative of the real mean pressure exerted by the indenter compared to classical <b>hardness</b> <b>numbers.</b> A coefficient is introduced in the model to integrate the extent of the elastic recovery of the indented material occurring after the withdrawal of the indenter. This is possible by using the criterion defined by the residual to maximum indenter displacements ratio, this criterion being already related to the deformation mode under indentation. Indeed, this criterion allows identifying the piling-up deformation observed for complete or fully plastic deformation materials or the sinking-in deformation for purely elastic materials. The proposed model thus allows a good estimation of the yield stress of brittle materials for which classical tensile tests are not applicable. The model is validated on a variety of amorphous nickel-silicon-based alloy ribbons, i. e., Ni 89 Si 9 B 2, Ni 78 Si 9 B 13 and Ni 68 Fe 3 Cr 7 Si 8 B 14 on which both nanoindentation tests and tensile experiments have been performed...|$|R

50|$|The Vickers {{hardness}} test {{was developed in}} 1921 by Robert L. Smith and George E. Sandland at Vickers Ltd {{as an alternative to}} the Brinell method to measure the hardness of materials. The Vickers test is often easier to use than other {{hardness test}}s since the required calculations are independent of the size of the indenter, and the indenter can be used for all materials irrespective of hardness. The basic principle, as with all common measures of hardness, is to observe the questioned material's ability to resist plastic deformation from a standard source. The Vickers test can be used for all metals and has one of the widest scales among hardness tests. The unit of hardness given by the test is known as the Vickers Pyramid Number (HV) or Diamond Pyramid Hardness (DPH). The <b>hardness</b> <b>number</b> can be converted into units of pascals, but should not be confused with pressure, which uses the same units.
