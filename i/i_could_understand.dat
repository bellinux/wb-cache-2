25|$|I {{regret to}} say {{that none of us}} {{approved}} of the marriage at that time. Mother thought Jack was too young, and Lottie and I felt that Olive, being in musical comedy, belonged to an alien world. Ollie had all the rich, eligible men of the social world at her feet. She had been deluged with proposals from her own world of the theater as well. Which was not at all surprising. The beauty of Olive Thomas is legendary. The girl had the loveliest violet-blue eyes I have ever seen. They were fringed with long dark lashes that seemed darker because of the delicate translucent pallor of her skin. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>understand</b> why Florenz Ziegfeld never forgave Jack for taking her away from the Follies. She and Jack were madly in love with one another but I always thought of them as a couple of children playing together.|$|E
500|$|One of Bridget's first {{high-profile}} storylines was {{coping with}} a disability, after Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne) hit Bridget with her car. She had been paralysed {{on one side of}} her body, the storyline saw her trying to regain the complete use of her body. Mignon explained during an interview with media reporting website Last Broadcast, the research that had been carried out and the effects on the character stating: [...] "Bridget suffers extreme physical difficulties as a result, because she's such a sporty tomboy, to be incapacitated suddenly poses emotional problems for her. To make sure that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>understand</b> better what Bridget's going through, I studied medical notes on paralysis and disability on the internet." [...] The storyline also explored self-image issues that come with disabilities, in one episode Bridget was doing physiotherapy exercises and became in danger of drowning until Declan Napier (James Sorensen) saved her. He tried to kiss her but she fended off his advances, of this Mignon said: [...] "Bridget pushes him off, she fears he'll see her differently due to her disability." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] {{are about a}} gender-swapping thought experiment, through which Beyoncé {{analyses}} the ideologies of a tense relationship. As she sings about things she would do {{if she were a}} boy, Beyoncé highlights the vulnerability of a woman and ponders how things would be different if men had women's sense of empathy. During {{the first part of the}} ballad, Beyoncé alternates between the role of her flawed partner and that of the better man she would be. In the first verse, she envisions herself impersonating her unfeeling love interest as she sings about consuming beer with other men, chasing after girls, and treating her lover cruelly, before adding that she would never be confronted for it. Beyoncé then sings the chorus, in which she gives her vision of life as a better man, [...] "I think <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>understand</b> / How it feels to love a girl / I swear I'd be a better man", because she knows [...] "how it hurts when you lose the one you wanted / 'cause he's taken you for granted and everything you had got destroyed".|$|E
2500|$|... "Stool Pigeon" [...] was {{inspired}} by a newspaper article Darnell had read about a former Mafia boss who had been let out of jail after providing information about his former colleagues, and had now had his identity changed and protected by the FBI. Darnell said, [...] "I actually had compassion for the guy. I thought, wow, what a way to go. And <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>understand</b> why he did it. He sold out for the money and the comfort, I guess the very things that had brought him into the underworld." [...] The song also features Darnell's attempt at the then newly fashionable art of rapping—he later confessed, [...] "That's just me goofing at being a rapper, which was the last thing I ever wanted to do".|$|E
2500|$|Lake's {{daughter}} Agnes Kirsopp Lake Michels was a noted classical scholar. [...] In {{later years}} she {{reflected on the}} impact he had on her life: [...] "my general interests should be attributed mainly {{to the influence of}} my father who was a New testament scholar with a classical education and a passionate love of beauty. [...] He told me the stories of the classics and, long before <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>understand</b> them, read to me a strange assortment of Browning and the Bible; Swinburne, Tennyson, and Josephus. [...] His attitude to his own work made me think of scholarship as the opening to a world of adventure, not as a retirement from reality." [...] His grandson Anthony Lake is a diplomat.|$|E

6000|$|It {{seemed to}} me a magnificently generous offer, but a very simple one. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>understand</b> the {{agitation}} and apparent indecision which it caused my mother. Her prompt refusal <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have <b>understood,</b> although {{it would have been}} a blow to me. But this mixture of horror and consternation, of emotion and dismay, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> make nothing of. The feeling which I had imagined would surely be manifested--gratitude--was conspicuous by its absence. What did it all mean? ...|$|R
2500|$|The Taínos {{had their}} own culture, customs and {{governing}} structure. Besides using the fields for ball playing, they would also use the plazas to celebrate the [...] "Areyto" [...] which was a celebration consisting of telling an oral history told by singing and dancing accompanied by music. Most of the knowledge and information that we have about {{the traditions of the}} Taínos came about the personal observations and historical documentations of Fray Bartolomé de las Casas. Fray Bartolomé de las Casas described an [...] "Areyto" [...] in the following manner: [...] "And on this island what <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>understand</b> was that their songs which they call 'areytos,' were their history passed from person to person, fathers to sons from the present to the future, as here uniting many Indians... passing three or four hours or more until the teacher or guide of the dance finished the history, and sometimes they went from one day to the next." ...|$|E
2500|$|Topless Robot {{called the}} {{inclusion}} of Quan Chi in Defenders of the Realm as [...] "the only contribution to [...] franchise that this series made." [...] However, Nathan Adams of Film School Rejects said in his review of the eighth episode of Legacy, [...] "It’s not clear by watching this episode who Quan Chi is; they don’t even mention his name", while adding that he [...] "had to do some digging around ... so that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>understand</b> what was happening" [...] {{in regards to the}} plot. Quan Chi has gained attention for his physical resemblance to God of War character Kratos, who was added to the PlayStation 3 version of MK2011 as a guest character. Brett Elston of GamesRadar remarked, [...] "shy white skin, red markings, shoulder guards...and Quan Chi's got about eight years on Kratos." [...] Nerd Reactor quipped about MK2011's then-newly revealed character-select screen, [...] "We get to see ... Sub-Zero and Kratos, I mean Quan Chi, featured [...] the screenshot." ...|$|E
2500|$|Arisu Kashiwagi, lead {{designer}} at Imaginary Forces for {{the title}} sequence, was [...] "inspired by all the changing activity and vignettes within those rows of windows [...] — the patterns of light, color, narratives, and graphic silhouettes. It is pretty amazing {{how much you can}} see and the number of windows out there with wide open shades... <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>understand</b> our innate fascination with the rear window and that discomforting pleasure when catching a small sliver of a private act." [...] She also looked to Edward Hopper's [...] "Night Windows" [...] and Gerhard Richter's paintings for reference. In order to differentiate the sequence from other painting-inspired ones, Kashiwagi chose to take [...] "a more modern, abstract look while also embracing the spirit of David Mack’s watercolor paintings from" [...] Alias. On the design concept, she added, [...] "We based the concept off of Jessica’s PTSD and alcoholism, her blurry, unreliable point of view, and translated that visually using paint strokes that smear and obfuscate the scenes ... the scenes would appear only in small sections of the frame, either blocked by a foreground element or contained inside of a silhouetted framing device." [...] Michelle Dougherty, creative director on the project, looked to the opening sequence of Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window to help create the [...] "voyeuristic approach" [...] as well as [...] "using the city as a character" [...] to highlight [...] "the dark places [...] the grit" [...] where Jones investigates.|$|E
60|$|She {{was talking}} to me of a sheep that had died, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>understand</b> because of her dialect. It never {{occurred}} to her that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>understand.</b> She only thought me different, stupid. And she talked on. The ewes had lived under the house, and a part was divided off for the he-goat, because the other people brought their she-goats to be covered by the he-goat. But how the ewe came to die <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not make out.|$|R

If your name had been disgraced, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>understand</b> it, as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>understand</b> a man then going about in a mask.
