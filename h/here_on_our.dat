2500|$|The [...] "Babbu di a Patria" [...] (father of Corsica), as Pasquale Paoli was nicknamed by the Corsican Independentists, {{wrote in}} his Letters [...] the {{following}} message in 1768 against the French invaders: [...] "We (Corsicans) are Italians by birth and feelings, {{but first of all}} we feel Italian by language, roots, customs, traditions and all the Italians are all brothers for History and for God.... As Corsicans {{we do not want to}} be slaves nor [...] "rebels" [...] and as Italians we have the right to be treated like all the other Italian brothers.... Either we'll be free or we'll be nothing.... Either we'll win or we'll die (against the French) with our weapons in our hands.... The war against France is [...] just and holy as the name of God is holy and just, and <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> mountains will appear for all Italy the sun of liberty." [...] ("Siamo còrsi per nascita e sentimento ma prima di tutto ci sentiamo italiani per lingua, origini, costumi, tradizioni e gli italiani sono tutti fratelli e solidali di fronte alla storia e di fronte a Dio… Come còrsi non vogliamo essere né schiavi né [...] "ribelli" [...] e come italiani abbiamo il diritto di trattare da pari con gli altri fratelli d’Italia… O saremo liberi o non saremo niente… O vinceremo con l’onore o soccomberemo (contro i francesi) con le armi in mano... La guerra con la Francia è giusta e santa come santo e giusto è il nome di Dio, e qui sui nostri monti spunterà per l’Italia il sole della libertà…") ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Now, {{that is what}} I {{have come}} {{to talk to you}} about," [...] {{continued}} Emery after a few seconds' pause, during which he had once more thrown a quick, half-suspicious glance on the impassive, though obviously interested face of the Englishman, [...] "always supposing that Monsieur <b>here</b> is <b>on</b> <b>our</b> side." ...|$|R

30|$|The work {{reported}} <b>here</b> builds <b>on</b> <b>our</b> {{research results}} using the COSMIC-FFP method for testing purposes, {{by combining the}} functions measured by the COSMIC-FFP measurement procedure with a black box testing strategy (Abu Talib et al. 2005, 2006; Abran et al. 2004). This extends the COSMIC-FFP and reliability prediction model to the component-based tool context.|$|R

6000|$|... "Very true, very true; if, indeed, {{there is}} any chance of that we will hold on. What is this off <b>here,</b> a little <b>on</b> <b>our</b> weather-bow? It looks like a low headland." ...|$|R

Of one thing, however, you may be certain; no mercy will be shown you, should this fellow, Muss, be {{actually}} out <b>here,</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> heels, and should you be so unfortunate as to fall into his hands." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} reported <b>here</b> builds <b>on</b> <b>our</b> {{earlier work}} <b>on</b> {{sex differences in}} the allocation of effort. In our earlier analysis of data from a repre- sentative sample of the working population (Bielby and Bielby 1985), we found that women allocate significantly more effort to work than do men with comparable job and family responsibilities. We extend those findings with analyses of patterns of allocation of work effort among men and women professionals and managers...|$|R
2500|$|Opposition MP Akram Chehayeb said [...] "That {{is where}} the {{difference}} between us and them lies: They asked these people to come and they brought them here, whereas the opposition's supporters come <b>here</b> <b>on</b> their own. <b>Our</b> protests are spontaneous. We have a cause. What is theirs?".|$|R
6000|$|... "That's what we pretend, {{but we know}} better. But I was {{thinking}} how pretty and pleasant things used to be turning {{up all the time}} on our travels in the old days. Why, when we were in New York <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> wedding journey the place didn't seem half so dirty as it does now, and none of these dismal things happened." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let old Parker {{alone for}} that! I'll warrant you, he is never {{out of the}} way. Were it Lord Morganic, now, in the Achilles, I should {{expect him to be}} away off <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> weather-quarter, just to show us how his ship can eat us out of the wind when he tries: or away down yonder, under our lee, that we might {{understand}} how she falls off, when he don't try." ...|$|E

[...] "But, Mr. Mulford, unless my eyes have cheated me, we are near that boat again.

30|$|This article gives a {{detailed}} account of the design and construction of our apparatus. To {{the best of our knowledge}} there currently are only two neutral merged-beam machines operational, but other efforts are under way [54, 55]. The version by the Narevicius group and the one described <b>here</b> naturally base <b>on</b> the same principle but they differ in certain key aspects. While we <b>here</b> focus <b>on</b> <b>our</b> own machine, we will outline, wherever possible, the differences with the other apparatus. For details, however, we refer to publications by Narevicius et al.|$|R
30|$|The method {{we present}} <b>here</b> is based <b>on</b> <b>our</b> {{previous}} works [6, 17 – 19] and related to [2, 3, 16, 20, 21]. Although, {{as shown in}} the cited works, the method can be transferred to many physical applications, we focus on the problem class of nonlinear elasticity.|$|R
