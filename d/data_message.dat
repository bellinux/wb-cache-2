This service is often used for asset tracking and remote monitoring. Messages are converted to be delivered in email format or over HTTP to a preconfigured address; the mobile unit does not include a destination address when sending a SBD message. A crude positioning report is also included in each message sent. SBD messages take from 6 to 22 seconds to send or receive.

In this paper, we show how to modify this protocol, without adding new messages, {{in order to satisfy}} the following load balancing property. If the modified protocol is used to route a sequence of <b>data</b> <b>messages</b> from a source to a destination, then these messages will be uniformly distributed over all k-monotonic paths from the source to the destination, i. e., over all paths whose distance to the destination never increases at each hop, and may remain constant in at most k hops.

30|$|All {{protocols}} {{considered in}} this evaluation require {{that a certain}} overhead is added into beacons or <b>data</b> <b>messages</b> in order to guarantee their proper functioning. Such overhead is generally translated into a fixed number of bytes which correspond to extra fields appended to either beacon or <b>data</b> <b>messages.</b> However, both AMD and UV-CAST resort to appending a message list with variable length to beacons {{in order to prevent}} that repeated messages are unnecessarily disseminated in the network. In particular, AMD also includes a small variable list in <b>data</b> <b>messages</b> to guarantee that the order of rebroadcast in the neighborhood is achieved. Therefore, in this last section, we measure the message overhead required by these two protocols when increasing network densities are considered.|$|R

50|$|The {{starting}} point for host-to-host communication on the ARPANET in 1969 was the 1822 protocol, which defined the transmission of messages to an IMP. The message format was designed to work unambiguously with {{a broad range of}} computer architectures. An 1822 message essentially consisted of a message type, a numeric host address, and a data field. To send a <b>data</b> <b>message</b> to another host, the transmitting host formatted a <b>data</b> <b>message</b> containing the destination host's address and the <b>data</b> <b>message</b> being sent, and then transmitted the message through the 1822 hardware interface. The IMP then delivered the message to its destination address, either by delivering it to a locally connected host, or by delivering it to another IMP. When the message was ultimately delivered to the destination host, the receiving IMP would transmit a Ready for Next Message (RFNM) acknowledgement to the sending, host IMP.|$|E
