25|$|Continuing his {{experiments}} in Brantford, Bell {{brought home a}} working model of his telephone. On August 3, 1876, from the telegraph office in Mount Pleasant five miles (eightkm) away from Brantford, Bell sent a tentative telegram indicating that he was ready. With curious onlookers packed into the office as witnesses, faint voices were heard replying. The following night, he amazed guests {{as well as his}} family when a message was received at the Bell home from Brantford, four miles (six km) distant, along an improvised wire strung up along telegraph lines and fences, and laid through a tunnel. This time, guests at the household distinctly <b>heard</b> <b>people</b> in Brantford reading and singing. These experiments clearly proved that the telephone could work over long distances.|$|E

Churchill's role during the siege is unclear. His biographers, Paul Addison and Roy Jenkins, both consider that he gave no operational commands to the police, but a Metropolitan police history of the event states that the events of Sidney Street were [...] "a very rare case of a Home Secretary taking police operational command decisions".

500|$|During {{his junior}} year, Presley began {{to stand out}} more among his classmates, largely because of his appearance: he grew out his sideburns and styled his hair with rose oil and Vaseline. In his free time, he would head down to Beale Street, the heart of Memphis's {{thriving}} blues scene, and gaze longingly at the wild, flashy clothes {{in the windows of}} Lansky Brothers. By his senior year, he was wearing them. Overcoming his reticence about performing outside the Lauderdale Courts, he competed in Humes's Annual [...] "Minstrel" [...] show in April 1953. Singing and playing guitar, he opened with [...] "Till I Waltz Again with You", a recent hit for Teresa Brewer. Presley recalled that the performance did much for his reputation: [...] "I wasn't popular in school... I failed music—only thing I ever failed. And then they entered me in this talent show... when I came onstage I <b>heard</b> <b>people</b> kind of rumbling and whispering and so forth, 'cause nobody knew I even sang. It was amazing how popular I became after that." ...|$|E
500|$|At age 10, Ryder and {{her family}} moved on again, this time to Petaluma, California. During her first week at Kenilworth Junior High, she was bullied {{by a group of}} her peers who mistook her for an effeminate, scrawny boy. [...] "I was wearing an old Salvation Army shop boy’s suit. As I went to the {{bathroom}} I <b>heard</b> <b>people</b> saying, ‘Hey, faggot’. They slammed my head into a locker. I fell to the ground and they started to kick the shit out of me. I had to have stitches. The school kicked me out, not the bullies... Years later, I went to a coffee shop and I ran into one of the girls who’d kicked me, and she said, ‘Winona, Winona, can I have your autograph?’ And I said, ‘Do you remember me? Remember in seventh grade you beat up that kid?’ And she said, ‘Kind of’. And I said, ‘That was me. Go fuck yourself.’" [...] As a result, Ryder ended up being home-schooled that year.|$|E

500|$|Looking back on {{the play}} years later, Regiels said [...] "I was embarrassed when I {{realized}} what I had done. I wanted a hole {{to open in the}} ground so I could jump in it. But that soon passed, and I reached a stage when mention of it would cause me to bristle. Soon that passed and it has never really bothered me since, except in cases when people tried to exploit it." [...] Riegels was reminded of his mistake throughout his life. Riegels once said: [...] "All the times I've run across or <b>heard</b> <b>people</b> saying 'wrong way,' even though they weren't referring to me, I immediately turned around to see if they were speaking about me. I still don't understand how I did it." [...] Riegels dealt with his situation by laughing about what happened. Riegels once joked [...] "If I had to do it again, I'd still run in the same direction, for I surely thought I was going the right way." [...] Riegels also said [...] "You run the wrong way with a football in front of 60,000 people, and it's pretty hard to lie out of it." [...] When presented his membership card into the Georgia Tech Lettermen's Club 42 years later, Riegels quipped, [...] "Believe me, I feel I've earned this." ...|$|E
500|$|Many critics {{specifically}} praised Duvall's performance. Sterritt {{called it}} [...] "one {{of the most}} finely wrought achievements to reach the screen in recent memory." [...] In Corliss's description, [...] "Duvall's aging face, a road map of dead ends and dry gulches, can accommodate rage or innocence or any ironic shade in between. As Mac he avoids both melodrama and condescension, finding climaxes in each small step toward rehabilitation, each new responsibility shouldered." [...] Ansen said, [...] "Robert Duvall does another of his extraordinary disappearing acts. He vanishes totally inside the character of Mac Sledge." [...] Maslin said he [...] "so thoroughly transformed into Mac that he even walks with a Texan's rolling gait"; she also complimented the performances of the supporting cast. According to a review in People, [...] "Duvall gives it everything he has, which is saying a great deal. His beery singing voice is a revelation, and his unfussy, brightly burnished acting is the kind for which awards were invented." [...] The review also described Betty Buckley as [...] "bitchy and brilliant". Duvall was praised as well for pulling off his first true romantic role; the actor said of the response, [...] "This is the only film where I've <b>heard</b> <b>people</b> say I'm sexy. It's real romantic. Rural romantic. I love that part almost more than anything." ...|$|E

M.B. also said that when he lay in Clementi's bed, he <b>heard</b> <b>people</b> joking and laughing in the courtyard, and it [...] "seemed like the jokes were at somebody else's expense". When he left the room, there were about five students who [...] "seemed to be looking at me and it seemed kind of unsettling".|$|E
2500|$|... "Gasolina", the album's lead single, was {{inspired}} by a Puerto Rican phrase about having a good time partying.

[...] ("How she likes gasoline!") at women who accepted rides from men with fancy cars. The hook [...] "a mí me gusta la gasolina, dame más gasolina" [...] ("I like gasoline, give me more gasoline") was born after he chanted rhythmically what he was hearing outside. He contacted his colleague and friend Eddie Dee to work with him on the song's lyrics.|$|E

2500|$|On March 6, 1983, {{after putting}} {{her two daughters}} to sleep {{following}} a third birthday party for the older girl, Araujo left her home in New Bedford, Massachusetts, to buy cigarettes. The store she usually purchased from was closed, so she stopped at Big Dan's tavern. Two men approached {{and asked her to}} leave with them. When she refused, a third man grabbed her from behind and threw her onto the bar's pool table. She was stripped below the waist, and several men raped her. According to Araujo's original report to police, she <b>heard</b> <b>people</b> [...] "laughing, cheering, yelling", but no one responded to her cries for help. [...] As Araujo seemingly admitted later, there was no crowd cheering on the rape. [...] Eventually, Araujo fought off her attackers and ran half-naked into the street, screaming that she had been raped. [...] Three college students passing by in a van came upon Araujo in the street and drove her to the nearest hospital.|$|E

[...] In the Preface to The Hunting of the Snark, Carroll wrote, [...] " [...] me take this opportunity of answering a question that has often been asked me, how to pronounce [...] "slithy toves." [...] The [...] "i" [...] in [...] "slithy" [...] is long, as in [...] "writhe", and [...] "toves" [...] is pronounced so as to rhyme with [...] "groves."

2500|$|Following {{advice from}} his father, Williams {{decided to take}} track seriously from 1992 onwards and he began working with 1968 Olympic silver medallist Barbara Ferrell – it was highly unusual {{for a woman to}} coach an elite male runner, but Williams was unperturbed, saying: [...] "I've <b>heard</b> <b>people</b> say a woman can't coach a man, but they must be lying, because look what she has done for me". He made his first attempt to qualify at the United States Olympic Trials in 1992, but he was sixth in the 100m semi-finals and {{finished}} last in the 200m. Despite this, he was selected for the IAAF World Cup in Athletics and won the bronze in the 200m and helped the US relay team to a gold medal. His performance at the 1993 US Championships was poor, but he countered this with success in Europe, winning the 200m at the British AAA Championships, and doubling up at the 1993 IAAF Grand Prix Final with a fourth in the 100 and fifth in the 200m. His 1994 season was a quiet one, although he was sixth in the 200m at the US Championships and he ran a personal best of 20.19seconds in Stockholm (the fifth fastest time of the year).|$|E

The First Amendment means the free exercise of religion and that means bringing people and their faith into the public square." [...] In an interview with the National Catholic Reporter, Santorum said that the distinction between private religious conviction and public responsibility, espoused by President John F. Kennedy, had caused [...] "great harm in America". He said: [...] "All of us have <b>heard</b> <b>people</b> say, 'I privately am against abortion, homosexual marriage, stem cell research, cloning. But who am I to decide that it's not right for somebody else?' It sounds good, but it is the corruption of freedom of conscience."

2500|$|Rabbi Helbo quoted Rabbi Jonathan {{to teach}} that the firstborn {{should have come}} from Rachel, as [...] says, [...] "These are the generations of Jacob, Joseph," [...] but Leah prayed for mercy before Rachel did. On account of Rachel's modesty, however, God {{restored}} {{the rights of the}} firstborn to Rachel's son Joseph from Leah's son Reuben. To teach what caused Leah to anticipate Rachel with her prayer for mercy, Rav taught that Leah's eyes were sore (as [...] reports) from her crying about what she heard at the crossroads. There she <b>heard</b> <b>people</b> saying: [...] "Rebecca has two sons, and Laban has two daughters; the elder daughter should marry the elder son, and the younger daughter should marry the younger son." [...] Leah inquired about the elder son, and the people said that he was a wicked man, a highway robber. And Leah asked about the younger son, and the people said that he was [...] "a quiet man dwelling in tents." [...] So she cried about her fate until her eyelashes fell out. This accounts for the words of [...] "And the Lord saw that Leah was hated, and He opened her womb," [...] which mean not that Leah was actually hated, but rather that God saw that Esau's conduct was hateful to Leah, so he rewarded her prayer for mercy by opening her womb first..|$|E
2500|$|It {{was typical}} of the Hines to ask if there were any Christians in the villages they visited. In one case, they found out that the only Christians that their host knew about were a man named Dmitri and his wife Lyudmila. Dmitri's wife knew how to read -- evidently a fairly rare thing at that time and in that place. She taught herself how to read because a Russian soldier had left a Bible behind several years earlier, and she started slowly {{learning}} by reading that Bible. When the Hines arrived in the village and approached Dmitri's house, they heard a strange and wonderful sound: Dmitri's wife was reading from the gospel of John about the crucifixion of Christ to a houseful of guests, and those visitors were in the very act of repenting. In Ukraine (as I know first hand!), this act of repenting is done very much out loud. So the Hines <b>heard</b> <b>people</b> calling out to God, saying how unbelievable it was that Christ would die for their own sins, and praising Him for His love and mercy. They just couldn't barge in and disrupt this obvious work of the Holy Spirit, so they stayed outside and listened. Stuart wrote down the phrases he heard the Repenters use, and (even though this was all in Russian), it became the third verse that we know today: [...] "And when I think that God, His Son not sparing, Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in." ...|$|E
