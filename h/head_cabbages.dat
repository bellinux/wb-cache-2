The aim of this study was to determine similarities and differences regarding morphological variation of white <b>head</b> <b>cabbage</b> (Brassica oleracea var. capitata subvar. alba) genetic resources collected from different eco-geographical regions of Turkey. Data from field experiments conducted between 1999 and 2001 were analysed by multiple variance analysis. Cluster analysis based on 12 quantitative and 10 qualitative variables identified 10 groups.

40|$|Production and {{processing}} of <b>head</b> <b>cabbage</b> {{has a significant}} economic importance for New York State agriculture. New York produces about one-fourth of the total U. S. <b>head</b> <b>cabbage</b> output, with 79 percent destined to the fresh market. In the U.

During the past decade (1991 to 2001), production of fresh <b>head</b> <b>cabbage</b> and sauerkraut in New York State increased 61 percent and 23 percent, respectively. During the same period, per capita consumption of fresh cabbage increased from 8. 2 pounds to 8. 8 pounds (an increase of 7. 3 percent), while consumption of sauerkraut stayed stable at around 1. 3 pounds (a decrease of between 2. 2 to 2. 3 pounds from the 1960 s to? 70 s levels (USDA, 2004). The consumption trends of fresh <b>head</b> <b>cabbage</b> and sauerkraut clearly reflect today?s consumers? food preferences, which are strongly determined by an increasing desire and interest in both fresher and more complex and exciting food products. The incorporation of fresh cabbage to bagged salads is thought to be a major contributing factor to the observed increase in consumption of fresh <b>head</b> <b>cabbage.</b> On the other hand, sauerkraut sold and consumed today in the U.

To examine the thrips population around the study site over time, thrips captured on sticky traps were pooled across location and compared across capture dates. The effect of trap location was evaluated by pooling traps within each location (i.e. north, east, south-edge and south-outer) and comparing across capture dates. Thrips entering the field site {{were compared with}} thrips within the field site by correlating <b>cabbage</b> <b>head</b> thrips counts with trap catches throughout the season by date. The influence of variety and planting date on total thrips observed on <b>cabbage</b> <b>heads</b> over the growing season was analysed. Location of thrips within the <b>cabbage</b> <b>head</b> at harvest, <b>cabbage</b> <b>head</b> weight and <b>cabbage</b> size was analysed for the two main varieties, Bronco and Lennox, and planting date. Percentage of <b>cabbage</b> <b>heads</b> showing thrips damage were analysed by location with the <b>cabbage</b> <b>head</b> and correlated with number of thrips present at harvest and the total thrips present on the heads over the season. And finally, correlation between trap catches and <b>head</b> weight and <b>cabbage</b> size was examined using linear models. <b>Cabbage</b> <b>head</b> weight and size (circumference along polar and equator dimensions) were compared for variety, planting date and harvest date.

ABSTRACT: The food value and the socio-economic importance of vegetables explain their increasing importance in urban agriculture at Lubumbashi. This research is preliminary study on the consumption of vegetables. Its objective is to compare the consumption of two types of cabbage, namely Chinese <b>cabbage</b> and <b>head</b> <b>cabbage.</b> To attain that goal, a survey was conducted between June and July 2014 among households of Congo district in the Rwashi commune (municipality), and in Kabecha district and Bel-air II in the Kampemba commune. The results reveal that for the majority (50 %) of households surveyed, household size varies between 5 and 7 persons. For 60 % of households, their monthly income varies between 100 and 200 US$. As for consumption, 73. 5 % of households consumed vegetables frequently (2 to 5 times per week). 73 % of households had chosen Chinese cabbage because is cheaper than <b>head</b> <b>cabbage</b> and always available on market, whereas 27 % affirmed that <b>head</b> <b>cabbage</b> is the best for their consumption because is good for their health and smells good. However, 80 % of households affirmed to prefer <b>head</b> <b>cabbage</b> to Chinese cabbage for its taste. These results constitute an incentive message to local farmers to orientate their production according to the preferences, needs and the appreciation of consumers.

30|$|Despite {{the large}} numbers of thrips {{captured}} on the traps, thrips observed on the <b>cabbage</b> <b>heads</b> over the season were very low. This suggests that either the thrips were not able to effectively colonize the heads in the field or that visual surveys were unable to adequately detect a representative portion of the population present on the head. Correlation between thrips observed during the last <b>cabbage</b> <b>head</b> survey did not correlate well with thrips found during <b>cabbage</b> <b>head</b> damage evaluation for cabbages harvested later in the season. The correlation was higher for <b>cabbage</b> <b>heads</b> harvested earlier. This suggests that head surveys are not indicative of the population contained within the head once the bulk of the population has moved into the field. Alternative means to quantify the thrips present in the plot itself will need to be evaluated.

40|$|<b>Head</b> <b>cabbage</b> is a {{vegetable}} crop with enhanced uptake of nutrients {{resulting in a}} large vegeta-tive biomass accumulation for a relatively short period. Balanced mineral nutrition with macro-and micronutrients is a necessary precondition for the normal plant growth and high yields of good quality. Plants absorb nitrogen from the soil mainly as ammonium nitrogen and nitrate nitro-gen. Cabbage is {{a good source of}} carbohydrates (mainly sugars), vitamins, minerals, amino acids and other biologically active substances (Huxsoll et al. 1989). In most non-leguminous crop plants, leafs are the dominant organ in the amino acid synthesis and distribution (Noctor et al. 2002). The leaf amino acid content increases with en-hanced supply of nitrogen during growth. The content of amino acids is a good indicator for the quality of vegetables. From about 80 known amino acids only 23 are important for the human diet. Essential amino acids are those that cannot be synthesized de novo by the organism, and there-fore must be supplied in food. Nine amino acids generally regarded as essential for humans are: isoleucine, leucine, lysine, threonine, tryptophan, methionine, valine, phenylalanine and histidine. Some essential amino acids have been observed to be deficient in different plant food products; for example lysine is deficient in wheat, tryptophan in maize, and methionine in legumes. Generally, fluctuations in the amino acid proportion in plants might reflect changes in the source of nitrogen for growth (Peoples et al. 1987). The aim of our study was to establish changes in different nitrogenous forms and in the composi-tion of amino acids synthesized in <b>head</b> <b>cabbage</b> leaves after treatments with different rates and sources of nitrogen fertilizers.
