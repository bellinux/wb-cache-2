25|$|In number theory, the Calkin–Wilf tree is a tree {{in which}} the {{vertices}} correspond 1-for-1 to the positive rational numbers. The tree is rooted at the number 1, and any rational number expressed <b>in</b> <b>simplest</b> <b>terms</b> as the fraction a/b has as its two children the numbers a/(a+b) and (a+b)/b. Every positive rational number appears exactly once in the tree.|$|E
2500|$|Dividing the {{numerator}} and denominator of {{a fraction}} {{by the same}} non-zero number will also yield an equivalent fraction. This is called reducing or simplifying the fraction. A simple fraction in which the numerator and denominator are coprime (that is, the only positive integer that goes into both the numerator and denominator evenly is 1) {{is said to be}} irreducible, in lowest terms, or <b>in</b> <b>simplest</b> <b>terms.</b> For example, [...] is not in lowest terms because both 3 and 9 can be exactly divided by 3. In contrast, [...] is in lowest terms—the only positive integer that goes into both 3 and 8 evenly is 1.|$|E

Hence energy in minus energy out equals the change in energy.|$|E
