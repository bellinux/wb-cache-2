500|$|Connor's {{appearance}} {{as a regular}} in After the Fall, was initially met with dismay by some fans. IDW representative Chris Ryall responded to these complaints with optimism, assuring the fans that the character would win them over, <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> has been, {{by the time the}} series end. True to his words, After The Fall’s Connor was received positively. Brian Lynch confirmed this in an interview, stating that Connor has not only been the most pleasantly surprising character for him to write, he has been the most surprising for the fans as well, [...] "Connor was a great character on the TV show but, I don’t think he was ever a favorite. But he’s slowly but surely {{become one of the most}} popular characters in After The Fall, which is wonderful." [...] He further said that he himself like the character so much now, he wants to do a book called 'Son of Angel' based on him.|$|E
500|$|The {{piano wire}} scene {{was meant to}} end with Kirk's {{sandwich}} being sliced <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> wanted, until George Meyer suggested that his arm be cut off instead. Mike Scully described the ensuing laughter at his suggestion as the most intense he had ever heard from the staff, saying: [...] "They were literally choking because the joke was so unexpected. It was a shocked kind of laugh, and it just started rolling, one of those laughs that build the more they reverberate through you." [...] In the unemployment line, the unemployment recipient with the bucket hat and the beard is a caricature of George Meyer. Due to Phil Hartman's death, the recurring characters of Lionel Hutz and Troy McClure were retired. As such, this episode is the last speaking appearance of Hutz, with him only being featured as a background character in some future episodes. McClure's final appearance would be in [...] "Bart the Mother", the third episode of season ten.|$|E
500|$|Although Howarth was {{familiar}} with campus fraternity life while attending George Washington University, he did not base Todd or his other roles on anyone he knew. [...] When asked about his roles, {{he was unable to}} explain why he was consistently cast as a bad guy, but said that he enjoyed it. [...] "I would never want to come in now and play a nice guy for three months. That would be dreadfully boring. This suits me fine. It's just as easy to pretend I'm a bad guy as it is to pretend I'm a good guy," [...] Howarth said. Playing a rapist was like playing any other role because [...] " [...] it's all make-believe". He was perplexed by writers' need to redeem villains. [...] "Todd's a pretty interesting character <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> is," [...] Howarth said in late 1994. [...] "There's no need to fix it if it's not broken. I don't know where the whole notion of redeeming characters comes from. People used to say to me, 'I hope you get redeemed so you can stay on the show.' Well, Todd hasn't been redeemed, and he's still on the show." [...] He added, [...] "I don't love the character I play. If I met Todd on the street, I wouldn't say 'Hi' to him, but I do love playing this character." ...|$|E

500|$|British {{graffiti}} {{artist and}} political activist Banksy {{is credited with}} creating the opening titles and couch gag for this episode, in what amounted to {{the first time that}} an artist has been invited to storyboard the show. Executive producer Al Jean first took note of Banksy after seeing his 2010 film Exit Through the Gift Shop. According to Jean, [...] "The concept in my mind was, 'What if this graffiti artist came in and tagged our main titles?'" [...] Simpsons casting director Bonnie Pietila was able to contact the artist through the film's producers, and asked if he would be interested in writing a main title for the show. Jean said Banksy [...] "sent back boards for pretty much what you saw." [...] Series creator Matt Groening gave the idea his blessing, and helped try to make the sequence as close to Banksy's original storyboards as possible. Fox's standards and practices department demanded some changes, and Jean agreed to them [...] "for taste"; Jean said that [...] "95 percent of it is <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> [...] wanted," [...] but declined to say what was in the censored 5%, only saying that the original version was [...] "even a little sadder." [...] In January 2011, Banksy published the original storyboard on his website. It appears that a poster of Rupert Murdoch could be the 5% that was left out of the final cut.|$|E
2500|$|Chris Baker, {{the chief}} {{operating}} officer of Three Chimneys, summarized Gun Runner's main assets: [...] "Pedigree. Conformation. Athleticism. <b>Just</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> always carried himself, just very smart, intelligent, classy. Easy-moving horse, kind of scopey and light, but in a good way — just an athlete... We've got a stallion barn that we want to fill.

2500|$|When {{he first}} came into the game I felt he was a huge prospect. For some reason he has {{deteriorated}} in such a big way. <b>Just</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> is walking back, {{he looks like a}} totally lost guy." [...] In the final Test of the series Ramdin struck his second Test century, managing 107 not out. At the fall of the ninth wicket Ramdin was joined by Tino Best and the pair built a 143-run partnership, the highest stand for the tenth wicket by the West Indies and the third highest in Test history. On reaching his century, Ramdin produced a piece of paper from his pocket on which he had written a message for Richards the night before. The message read [...] "Yeah Viv Talk Nah". The ICC fined Ramdin 20% of his match fee for [...] "conduct contrary to the spirit of the game".|$|E
5000|$|Referring to Washington, {{second baseman}} Ian Kinsler said: [...] "I <b>just</b> love <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> never holds his emotion back, {{especially}} when he's managing. He hangs on every pitch, and it's great {{to know that}} your manager is in every single pitch and cares that much." [...] In 2009 his salary was about $750,000. On November 4, 2010, Washington agreed to a two-year contract extension.|$|R

5000|$|Amongst {{other claims}} Hadleigh has made is that Rock Hudson {{had an affair}} with Liberace. In a filmed interview, {{journalist}} Woody McBreairty confronted Hadleigh with the information that Tom Clark, publicist and friend of Hudson, had said of the claim: [...] "Nonsense. It never happened. I knew Rock for thirty years...Rock did not know this writer and never spoke to him. <b>The</b> <b>way</b> Rock is quoted is <b>just</b> not <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> talked". In response, Hadleigh stated that he had interviewed Hudson twice, in 1977 and 1982.|$|R

6000|$|She had to {{recognise}} it, {{and after}} much prostration among the photographs she recognised {{it to the}} extent of accepting some of the convenience of it {{in the form of a}} project for a common household, to the expenses of which each party should proportionately contribute. Jane Highmore made a great point of her not being left alone, but Mrs. Stannace herself determined the proportion, which on Limbert's side at least and in spite of many other fluctuations was never altered. His income had been [...] "fixed" [...] with a vengeance: having painfully stooped to the comprehension of it Mrs. Stannace rested on this effort to the end and asked no further question on the subject. The Major Key in other words ran ever so long, and before it was half out Limbert and Maud had been married and the common household set up. These first months were probably the happiest in the family annals, with wedding-bells and budding laurels, the quiet, assured course of the book and the friendly, familiar note, round the corner, of Mrs. Highmore's big guns. They gave Ralph time to block in another picture as well as to let me know after a while that he had the happy prospect of becoming a father. We had at times some dispute as to whether The Major Key was making an impression, but our contention could only be futile so long as we were not agreed as to what an impression consisted of. Several persons wrote to the author and several others asked to be introduced to him: wasn't that an impression? One of the lively [...] "weeklies," [...] snapping at the deadly [...] "monthlies," [...] said the whole thing was [...] "grossly inartistic"--wasn't that? It was somewhere else proclaimed [...] "a wonderfully subtle character-study"--wasn't that too? The strongest effect doubtless was produced on the publisher when, in its lemon-coloured volumes, like a little dish of three custards, the book was at last served cold: he never got his money back and so far as I know has never got it back to this day. The Major Key was rather a great performance than a great success. It converted readers into friends and friends into lovers; it placed the author, as the phrase is--placed him all too definitely; but it shrank to obscurity in the account of sales eventually rendered. It was in short an exquisite thing, but it was scarcely a thing to have published and certainly not a thing to have married on. I heard all about the matter, for my intervention had much exposed me. Mrs. Highmore said the second volume had given her ideas, and the ideas are probably to be found in some of her works, to the circulation of which they have even perhaps contributed. This was not absolutely yet the very thing she wanted to do, but it was on the way to it. So much, she informed me, she particularly perceived in the light of a critical study which I put forth in a little magazine; which the publisher in his advertisements quoted from profusely; and as to which there sprang up some absurd story that Limbert himself had written it. I remember that on my asking some one why such an idiotic thing had been said my interlocutor replied: [...] "Oh, because, you know, it's <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> would have written!" [...] My spirit sank a little perhaps as I reflected that with such analogies in our manner there might prove to be some in our fate.|$|E
6000|$|Dear General Hoskyns,--I {{have the}} honour to report as usual. Your giddy mother having gone {{planting}} a flower-garden, I am obliged to write {{with my own}} hand, and, of course, nobody {{will be able to}} read it. This has been a very mean kind of a month. Aunt Maggie left with the influenza. We have heard of her from Sydney, and she is all right again; but we have inherited her influenza, and it made a poor place of Vailima. We had Talolo, Mitaele, Sosimo, Iopu, Sina, Misifolo, and myself, all sick in bed at the same time; and was not that a pretty dish to set before the king! The big hall of the new house having no furniture, the sick pitched their tents in it,--I mean their mosquito-nets,--like a military camp. The Tamaitai and your mother went about looking after them, and managed to get us something to eat. Henry, the good boy! though he was getting it himself, did housework, and went round at night from one mosquito-net to another, praying with the sick. Sina, too, was as good as gold, and helped us greatly. We shall always like her better. All the time--I do not know how they managed--your mother found the time to come and write for me; and for three days, as I had my old trouble on, and had to play dumb man, I dictated a novel in the deaf-and-dumb alphabet. But now we are all recovered, and getting to feel quite fit. A new paddock has been made; the wires come right {{up to the top of}} the hill, pass within twenty yards of the big clump of flowers (if you remember that) and by the end of the pineapple patch. The Tamaitai and your mother and I all sleep in the upper story of the new house; Uncle Lloyd is alone in the workman's cottage; and there is nobody at all at night in the old house, but ants and cats and mosquitoes. The whole inside of the new house is varnished. It is a beautiful golden-brown by day, and in lamplight all black and sparkle. In the corner of the hall the new safe is built in, and looks as if it had millions of pounds in it; but I do not think there is much more than twenty dollars and a spoon or two; so the man that opens it will have a great deal of trouble for nothing. Our great fear is lest we should forget how to open it; but it will look just as well if we can't. Poor Misifolo--you remember the thin boy, do you not?--had a desperate attack of influenza; and he was in a great taking. You would not like to be very sick in some savage place in the islands, and have only the savages to doctor you? Well, that was <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> felt. [...] "It is all very well," [...] he thought, [...] "to let these childish white people doctor a sore foot or a toothache, but this is serious--I might die of this! For goodness' sake let me get away into a draughty native house, where I can lie in cold gravel, eat green bananas, and have a real grown-up, tattooed man to raise spirits and say charms over me." [...] A day or two we kept him quiet, and got him much better. Then he said he must go. He had had his back broken in his own islands, he said; it had come broken again, and he must go away to a native house and have it mended. [...] "Confound your back!" [...] said we; [...] "lie down in your bed." [...] At last, one day, his fever was quite gone, and he could give his mind to the broken back entirely. He lay in the hall; I was in the room alone; all morning and noon I heard him roaring like a bull calf, so that the floor shook with it. It was plainly humbug; it had the humbugging sound of a bad child crying; and about two of the afternoon we were worn out, and told him he might go. Off he set. He was in some kind of a white wrapping, with a great white turban on his head, as pale as clay, and walked leaning on a stick. But, O, he was a glad boy to get away from these foolish, savage, childish white people, and get his broken back put right by somebody with some sense. He nearly died that night, and little wonder! but he has now got better again, and long may it last! All the others were quite good, trusted us wholly, and stayed to be cured where they were. But then he was quite right, if you look at it from his point of view; for, though we may be very clever, we do not set up to cure broken backs. If a man has his back broken we white people can do nothing at all but bury him. And was he not wise, since that was his complaint, to go to folks who could do more? ...|$|E

Perversely, none the less, his pause gave a strange air of truth to her supposition; and what was he in fact but disconcerted at having struck her <b>just</b> in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> had most dreamed of not doing?
