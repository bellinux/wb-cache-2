5|$|When Magnum XL-200 opened, it used pads {{similar to}} those still in use on Gemini. Shortly after its debut, however, these up-stop plates were {{replaced}} with more traditional up-stop wheels that keep the train from <b>flying</b> <b>off</b> its rails.|$|E
5|$|Cavaldi {{stays in}} the village and joins the villagers for the feast. Angelika kisses both the Grimms and tells them that they are always welcome at the village. The Brothers Grimm decide to pursue a new profession, presumably {{recording}} fairy tales, although they are now wanted criminals of the state. One of the Queen's crows is seen <b>flying</b> <b>off</b> with the last shard of her mirror, still holding the Queen's watchful eye and presumably, her living soul.|$|E
5|$|Extensive damage {{occurred}} in Haiti {{due to high}} winds and flash flooding. Total costs for that country were estimated to be at more than $400million (1980 USD). Roughly 60% of the nation's coffee crop was destroyed. In all, 220people were killed and 835,000 were left homeless. In Port-au-Prince, 41 deaths were caused by tin roofs <b>flying</b> <b>off</b> and around 1200 were made homeless by flooding. Another 140 people were reported dead from flooding.|$|E

It {{was planned}} to use submarines to refuel the new jet-powered P6M SeaMaster flying boats. As part of this program Guavina was converted to carry 160,000 gallons for aviation fuel.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{presence}} of humans, Montezuma quail crouch motionless in tall grass instead of running. They may allow an approach as close as 1 metre before <b>flying</b> (taking <b>off</b> with a [...] "loud, popping wing noise") and on rare occasions have been caught by hand.|$|R
5|$|As an example, the {{execution}} scene in The Kingdom of This World puts European and autochthonous cultures in opposition {{through the use}} of the spectator-performer relationship. In this spectacle situation, Carpentier is able to juxtapose the Europeans' experience of Macandal's body falling into the flames with the autochthonous (Afro-Haitian) experience of Macandal's body <b>flying</b> <b>off</b> the stake. Through the different, mutable views of the performance that he creates, Carpentier is able to represent an unstable cultural identity. As a second example, the scene that Ti Noel constructs around himself after the sacking of the Sans-Souci Palace presents the reader with a dramatic rehearsal in which Ti Noel represents culturally mobile subjectivity by performing different identities on his own.|$|E
5|$|Exasperated, Candace {{returns to}} the circus, where Jeremy has saved a spot for her, only for the boys to mistake her for Buford and include her in his act. She is sent flying through {{the roof of the}} tent, just as Doofenshmirtz and Perry are flying overhead. Doofenshmirtz's machine activates, giving {{everyone}} in the cirque audience high-pitched voices that cause the tent to rupture. The high velocity of Doofenshmirtz's flying machine propels the tent up into the air, destroying the machine and sending Doofenshmirtz <b>flying</b> <b>off</b> (with a high voice). Jeremy gives a CD to Candace, but Candace is not at the house, but Candace then gets the CD from Jeremy.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} story, Delphi has {{transformed}} {{herself into a}} Kabuto-like creature to challenge the original. The player wanders around the islands as the Delphi-Kabuto character, searching for prey to increase her size. After Delphi-Kabuto achieves her maximum size, she proceeds to a boss fight with the original Kabuto. Despite her victory, Kabuto revives in a triggered cut scene and restores her Reaper form; whereupon the player takes the role of Baz against the revived monster. After defeating Kabuto, Baz {{is shown in the}} final cut scene, <b>flying</b> <b>off</b> to Planet Majorca with Delphi, Borjoyzee, and his fellow Meccaryns.|$|E

50|$|Unable {{to get the}} <b>flying</b> car <b>off</b> the ground, Shoulders {{created his}} own company, Vertitek, and began {{developing}} remote-controlled drones. He imagined {{a wide variety of}} drone applications, from children's toys to agricultural crop dusters. One example, the Boomerang, sent out sound waves to detect and avoid collisions, and looked like giant maple seed.|$|R
5|$|Lake Phelps and the Scuppernong River {{attract a}} wide variety of waterfowl. Lake Phelps is just one of several large, shallow {{freshwater}} lakes on the Pamlico-Albemarle Peninsula. These lakes are all winter grounds for ducks, geese and swans. The waterfowl at Lake Phelps use the area primarily for roosting purpose before <b>flying</b> <b>off</b> to nearby feeding sites. Tundra swans and Canada geese feed in nearby farm fields and the ducks feed in the wetlands. The waterfowl usually arrive in the area in October and overwinter until February or March. Commonly seen waterfowl are Canada geese, tundra swans, mallards, American black ducks and northern pintail.|$|E
5|$|The British fleet left Scapa Flow as {{a single}} group on 14 July. During the voyage north, the airmen {{received}} detailed briefings on the attack plans and terrain around Kaafjord and were also issued with escape kits to use if they were shot down over Norway. Maintenance personnel also worked to ensure that as many aircraft as possible would be ready. The twelve German submarines in the Norwegian Sea did not {{make contact with the}} British force as it sailed north. The weather for much of the voyage was foggy, but the skies were clear when the fleet reached its <b>flying</b> <b>off</b> position to the north of Kaafjord in the evening of 16 July.|$|E
5|$|The chicks are fed worms, insects, and berries. Waste {{accumulation}} {{does not}} occur in the nest because adults collect and take it away. Chicks are fed, and then raise tails for elimination of waste, a solid white clump that is collected by a parent prior to <b>flying</b> <b>off.</b> All chicks in the brood leave the nest within two days of each other. Even after leaving the nest, the juveniles will follow their parents around and beg food from them. Juveniles become capable of sustained flight two weeks after fledging.|$|E

5|$|Furious {{arrived back}} in the UK in April 1942 {{and spent the next}} three months working up. In August she was {{detailed}} to accompany the convoy bound for Malta in Operation Pedestal, but she was only to sail far enough with them to allow her 38 Supermarine Spitfires to reach Malta. This she did, just as Eagle was torpedoed, but Furious turned around after <b>flying</b> <b>off</b> her fighters and reached Gibraltar successfully. She loaded another batch of 32 Spitfires on 16 August and they were flown off the following day south-east of the Balearic Islands. After this mission Furious was sent back to Home Fleet for training. One last mission was necessary to reinforce the defences of Malta before Operation Torch, and she arrived on 27 October. She loaded 32 Spitfires and launched them on the 29th before returning to Gibraltar to participate in Torch.|$|E
5|$|Male adults may patrol individually, {{but most}} congregate in swarms a few metres above water with clear open sky above it, and perform a nuptial (courtship) dance. Each insect has a {{characteristic}} up-and-down pattern of movement; strong wingbeats propel it upwards and forwards with the tail sloping down; when it stops moving its wings, it falls passively with the abdomen tilted upwards. Females fly into these swarms, and mating {{takes place in}} the air. A rising male clasps the thorax of a female from below using his front legs bent upwards, and inseminates her. Copulation may last just a few seconds, but occasionally a pair remains in tandem and flutters to the ground. Males may spend the night in vegetation and return to the nuptial dance the following day. Although they do not feed, some briefly touch the surface to drink a little water before <b>flying</b> <b>off.</b>|$|E
5|$|The stage show {{featured}} Wurst in a cream-covered mermaid-like dress {{standing on}} a pedestal {{in the middle of}} the stage. The stage appeared dark at the beginning of the song with minimal lighting, before the lighting rose towards the beginning of the first chorus. At the start of the song, the camera appeared at the back of the arena before swooping into centre stage to a close-up of Wurst, followed by it <b>flying</b> <b>off</b> again at the beginning of the chorus. The background LED screens featured at the first chorus flaming rain, followed by flames in the shape of wings, in reference to the phoenix in the title of the song. Pyrotechnic flames also featured at the finale of the song. Wind machines were also used to effect during the performance.|$|E
50|$|PSS {{began in}} the mid-1970s, {{when a group of}} modellers at Moel Famau in North Wales were buzzed by a {{full-sized}} DC-3 Dakota, flying low level in the valley below. This sight inspired members of the Clwyd Soaring Association to try to convert traditionally powered models into slope soarers, and soon after the first models were <b>flying</b> successfully <b>off</b> the slope.|$|R

She subsequently sank the Greek-registered Zeus on the 19th.|$|R
5|$|Turning in his script in July 2002, J. J. Abrams' Superman: Flyby was an origin {{story that}} {{included}} Krypton besieged by {{a civil war}} between Jor-El and his corrupt brother Kata-Zor. Before Kata-Zor sentences Jor-El to prison, Kal-El is launched to Earth to fulfill a prophecy. Adopted by Jonathan and Martha Kent, he forms a romance with Lois Lane in the Daily Planet. However, Lois {{is more concerned with}} exposing Lex Luthor, written as a government agent obsessed with UFO phenomena. Clark reveals himself to the world as Superman, bringing Kata-Zor's son, Ty-Zor, and three other Kryptonians to Earth. Superman is defeated and killed, and visits Jor-El (who committed suicide on Krypton while in prison) in Kryptonian heaven. Resurrected, he returns to Earth and defeats the four Kryptonians. The script ends with Superman <b>flying</b> <b>off</b> to Krypton in a spaceship.|$|E
5|$|A {{flurry of}} action followed. On 1 July 1941 he {{expended}} 89 rounds and damaged a Bf 109E. Bader's section was attacked and Johnson out-turned his assailant. Firing, he saw glycol streaming behind it. On 14 July, the Tangmere Wing flew on Circus 48 to St Omer. Losing {{sight of the}} squadron, Johnson and his wingman proceeded inland at 3,000 feet after spotting three aircraft. Turning in behind them, he identified them as Bf 109Fs. Johnson dived so as {{to come up and}} underneath into the enemy's blind spot. Closing to 15 yards, he gave the trailing Bf 109 a two-second burst. The tail was blown off and his windshield was covered in oil from the Messerschmitt. Johnson saw the other Bf 109s spinning down out of control. Having also lost his wingman, Johnson disengaged. Climbing and crossing the coast at Etaples, Johnson bounced a Bf 109E. Giving chase in a dive to 2,000 feet and firing at 150 yards, he observed something <b>flying</b> <b>off</b> the Bf 109's starboard wing. Johnson could not see any more owing to the oil-covered windscreen and did not make a claim. His second victory was probably Unteroffizier (Corporal) R. Klienike, III./Jagdgeschwader 26 (Third Group, Fighter Wing 26) who was posted missing.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{displays}} are seen, with aggressive behaviours outnumbering pro-social ones. Crouching low and uttering quiet begging calls are common signs of submission. The manus flutter is a submissive display where a magpie will flutter its primary feathers in its wings. A magpie, particularly a juvenile, may also fall, roll over on its back and expose its underparts. Birds may fluff up their flank feathers as an aggressive display or preceding an attack. Young birds display various forms of play behaviour, either by themselves or in groups, with older birds often initiating the proceedings with juveniles. These may involve picking up, manipulating or tugging at various objects such as sticks, rocks or bits of wire, and handing them to other birds. A bird may pick up a feather or leaf and <b>flying</b> <b>off</b> with it, with other birds pursuing and attempting {{to bring down the}} leader by latching onto its tail feathers. Birds may jump on each other and even engage in mock fighting. Play may even take place with other species such as blue-faced honeyeaters and Australasian pipits.|$|E

5|$|For 11 {{hours the}} German fleet sailed from Brest into the English Channel to the Dover Straits. By chance, a {{mechanic}} {{on the radar}} station at Fairlight, East Sussex had just finished repairing the equipment when he picked up 27 echos at 10:15 on 12 February, south of Cap Gris Nez. The information was relayed to Vice-Admiral Bertram Ramsay, who ordered his Air Officer liaison to contact No. 11 Group RAF to ask for armed reconnaissance. Ramsay also warned No. 16 Group RAF and the FAA squadron operating out of RAF Manston that there were possible targets were in the Channel, despite not knowing the exact number or size of the enemy vessels. The performance of the radar was down to the jamming of the sets (BallstÃ¶ranlage) by two Heinkel He 111s which had been <b>flying</b> <b>off</b> the south coast from their airfield near Paris. The flights ceased at 09:00 when installations along the French coast had taken over. The detection by Fairlight {{was a piece of}} good fortune, the Germans had assumed it to be out of action. Ten Dornier Do 217s from III./KG 2 flew missions against Plymouth harbour and airfield, while 15 flew diversion missions to keep RAF fighters clear of the He 111s.|$|E
