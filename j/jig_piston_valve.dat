50|$|The {{first seven}} {{locomotives}} had slide valves, while the remainder had <b>piston</b> <b>valves.</b> The slide valve engines were later fitted with <b>piston</b> <b>valves.</b> Schmidt superheaters were fitted between 1913 and 1925.|$|R
50|$|They {{also used}} {{a wide range}} of valves. Examples with either slide or <b>piston</b> <b>valves</b> were common. Multi-cylinder {{single-acting}} engines typically shared one <b>piston</b> <b>valve</b> between two cylinders, either between the cylinders or horizontally above them.|$|R
50|$|An angle seat <b>piston</b> <b>valve</b> is a pneumatically-controlled <b>valve</b> with a <b>piston</b> {{actuator}} providing linear actuation {{to lift a}} seal off its seat. The seat is set at {{an angle}} to provide the maximum possible flow when unseated. Angle seat <b>piston</b> <b>valves</b> are particularly suited to applications where high temperatures and large flowrates are required, such as steam or water. When used in reverse some models of angle seat <b>piston</b> <b>valve</b> will eliminate water hammer when operated.|$|R
2500|$|The {{two major}} types of valve {{mechanisms}} are rotary <b>valves</b> and <b>piston</b> <b>valves.</b> [...] The first <b>piston</b> <b>valve</b> instruments were developed {{just after the}} start of the 19th century. The Stölzel valve (invented by Heinrich Stölzel in 1814) was an early variety. In the mid 19th century the Vienna valve was an improved design. However many professional musicians preferred rotary valves for quicker, more reliable action, until better designs of <b>piston</b> <b>valves</b> were mass manufactured {{towards the end of the}} 19th century. Since the early decades of the 20th century, <b>piston</b> <b>valves</b> have been the most common on brass instruments except for the orchestral horn and the tuba. See also the article Brass Instrument Valves.|$|R
50|$|Initially, most valved {{instruments}} were offered in rotary <b>valve</b> configurations with <b>piston</b> <b>valve</b> cornet and alto horn {{being the only}} exceptions. The rotary valve is a string operated dual-bored axial valve actuated by a lever pressed with the fingers. A <b>piston</b> <b>valve</b> is directly actuated by downward finger pressure {{on the top of}} a dual-bored piston over a spring. Rotary valves were common in central Europe in the mid 19th century while <b>piston</b> <b>valves</b> were the preferred configuration in British brass bands.|$|R
50|$|Sun :The Sun was {{launched}} in 1927 as a direct replacement for the 1b MTB engine. Like the Star, the bevel drive was moved inside the crankcase, and banjo drive was used {{with a choice of}} either <b>piston</b> <b>valve</b> or slide valve. Bore and stroke were 0.75 inches. While the slide valve variant was only available as a kit, the <b>piston</b> <b>valve</b> version was available as a complete engine or kit. The Sun continued after the war as a <b>piston</b> <b>valve</b> kit only and last appeared in the Stuart catalogue in 1989/1990.|$|R
25|$|Consider {{that the}} driver has {{adjusted}} the reversing lever such that the die block is at mid-gear. In this position the secondary motion is eliminated and the <b>piston</b> <b>valve</b> travel is shortest, giving minimal injection and exhaust of steam. The travel of the <b>piston</b> <b>valve</b> is twice the total of lap plus lead.|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to fixed and variable bleed devices provided for controlling {{the position of}} a terminal shock wave in a supersonic inlet, a plurality of free <b>piston</b> <b>valves</b> are disposed around the periphery of a cowling of a supersonic engine inlet. The free <b>piston</b> <b>valves</b> are disposed in dump passageways, each of which begin at a bleed port in the cowling that is located in the throat region of the inlet, where the diameter of the centerbody is near maximum, and terminates at an opening in the cowling adjacent a free <b>piston</b> <b>valve.</b> Each valve is controlled by reference pressure...|$|R
