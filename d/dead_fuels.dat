5000|$|The {{energy release}} {{component}} (ERC) {{is a number}} related to the available energy (BTU) per unit area (square foot) within the flaming front {{at the head of}} a fire. Daily variations in ERC are due to changes in moisture content of the various fuels present, both live and dead. Since this number represents the potential [...] "heat release" [...] per unit area in the flaming zone, it can provide guidance to several important fire activities. It may also be considered a composite fuel moisture value as it reflects the contribution that all live and <b>dead</b> <b>fuels</b> have to potential fire intensity. The ERC is a cumulative or [...] "build-up" [...] type of index. As live fuels cure and <b>dead</b> <b>fuels</b> dry, the ERC values get higher, thus providing a good reflection of drought conditions. The scale is open-ended or unlimited and, as with other NFDRS components, is relative. Conditions producing an ERC value of 24 represent a potential heat release twice that of conditions resulting in an ERC value of 12.|$|E
5000|$|The {{concept of}} a fuel model was first {{introduced}} in 1972 with the National Fire Danger Rating System. The first system of its kind, the NFDRS was a standardized set of equations to determine fire danger at specific points on the landscape. [...] Fuel models were {{at the core of}} these calculations, with each of its 20 models containing information about the relative loading of different fuel components. Each model is described by the volume of 1-hr, 10-hr, 100-hr, and 1000-hr <b>dead</b> <b>fuels,</b> herbaceous and woody live fuels present as well as the fuel bed depth and moisture of extinction.|$|E
30|$|By default, FSim populates {{the fuel}} {{moisture}} content values from the percentile values calculated in FireFamily Plus (Bradshaw and McCormick 2000) and applies those values {{to the entire}} landscape and to all surface fuel models; it does not allow fuel moisture conditioning (adjustment of fine <b>dead</b> <b>fuel</b> moisture content based on aspect, elevation, vegetation cover, and recent weather). On landscapes with significant variability in elevation and canopy cover, using a single value for <b>dead</b> <b>fuel</b> moisture across the whole landscape would tend to underestimate <b>dead</b> <b>fuel</b> moisture at higher elevations and under a forest canopy. Even though fuel moisture conditioning is not available within FSim, {{we were able to}} semi-condition <b>dead</b> <b>fuel</b> moistures because FSim can optionally use fuel moisture values specified for each fuel model separately. We conditioned <b>dead</b> <b>fuel</b> in FlamMap (Finney 2006) so that the landscape mean 1 hr timelag moisture content was approximately equal to the percentile value calculated in FireFamily-Plus, and then calculated the mean moisture content where each fuel model occurs on the landscape. Using this procedure, fuel models typically found at higher elevations and under a forest canopy (e.g., TU 5) were assigned higher <b>dead</b> <b>fuel</b> moisture content values than unsheltered fuel models found at lower elevations (e.g., GR 2 and GS 2).|$|R

There is currently no model allowing such prediction in temperate grasslands. This study aims to identify the environmental variables that determine whether fires will sustain in native grasslands in Tasmania, Australia, and develop a model for predicting fire sustainability in this vegetation. Fuel characteristics and weather conditions were recorded for 111 test fires. Logistic regression modeling identified <b>dead</b> <b>fuel</b> moisture content, fuel load, and percentage <b>dead</b> <b>fuel</b> as predictors of fire sustainability. Classification tree modeling identified <b>dead</b> <b>fuel</b> moisture and fuel load threshold values for sustaining fires. There was also evidence indicating a percentage <b>dead</b> <b>fuel</b> threshold. The logistic regression model and a model combining the results of the classification tree and the percentage <b>dead</b> <b>fuel</b> threshold accurately predicted the outcomes of a small set of experimental fires.

5000|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century, heavy cutover of the {{southern}} pine forest, combined with longleaf pine seedling destruction by foraging livestock, eliminated pine regeneration. [...] As reflected by the 1924 federal Clarke-McNary Act, fire suppression began to be practiced. The American Forestry Association's [...] "Dixie Crusaders" [...] told the South that burning woods were bad. [...] The paper industry encouraged growth of loblolly and slash pines. The probability of catastrophic high-intensity fire increased as <b>dead</b> <b>fuels</b> increased on the forest floor. Overgrowth shades and stunts longleaf pine seedlings, undergrowth increases, and succession creates the southern mixed hardwood forest where savanna used to be.

50|$|Invasive {{species can}} affect fire behavior. The {{area of the}} Beaver Creek Fire {{is known to be}} infested with Mountain Pine Beetles, Dendroctonus ponderosae. Mountain Pine Beetles kill trees by {{latching}} on to trees, consuming bark, and laying eggs inside the tree tissue. Trees able to reseed and grow continue to be attacked by the beetles. The tree mortality caused by the Mountain Pine Beetles increases fire hazard in the area and causes more high intensity fires. It is a proven fact the Mountain Pine Beetles have an increasing effect on the fire spread and fire intensity. The more trees the Mountain Pine Beetle kills, the more large woody fuel falls to the ground causing increased fire intensity and severity. The first few years after the destruction from the beetle is the time period when large amounts of fine <b>dead</b> <b>fuels</b> are present and woody fuels that produces the highest intensity and severe fires.|$|E

This finding supports the argument that fires burning under Santa Ana conditions are wind driven events, {{to the extent that the}} Rothermel equations in the HFire model structure represent the physical process of fire spread. In contrast, fine <b>dead</b> <b>fuel</b> moisture was responsible for less than 15 % of the variation in simulated fire size.

40|$|Abstract. The {{estimation}} of moisture content of <b>dead</b> <b>fuels</b> {{is a critical}} variable in fire danger assessment since it is strongly related to fire ignition and fire spread potential. This study evaluates the accuracy of two well-known meteoro-logical moisture codes, the Canadian Fine Fuels Moisture Content and the US 10 -h, to estimate fuel moisture content of <b>dead</b> <b>fuels</b> in Mediterranean areas. Cured grasses and litter {{have been used for}} this study. The study was conducted in two phases. The former aimed to select the most efficient code, and the latter to produce a spatial representation of that index for operational assessment of fire danger conditions. The first phase required calibration and validation of an estimation model based on regression analysis. Field samples were collected in the Cabañeros National Park (Central Spain) for a six-year period (1998 – 2003). The estimations were more accurate for litter (r 2 between 0. 52) than for cured grasslands (r 2 0. 11). In addition, grasslands showed higher variability in the trends among the study years. The two moisture codes evaluated in this paper offered similar trends, therefore, the 10 -h code was selected since it is simpler to compute. The second phase was based on interpolating the required meteorological variables (temperature and relative humidity) to compute the 10 -h moisture code. The interpolation was based on European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecast-ing (ECMWF) predictions. Finally, a simple method to combine the estimations of dead fuel moisture content with other variables associated to fire danger is presented in this paper. This method estimates the probability of ignition based on the moisture of extinction of each fuel type...|$|E
30|$|Thinning without {{subsequent}} slash reduction {{has been}} shown in simulation studies to be less effective than prescribed fire in reducing potential wildland fire behavior (van Wagtendonk 1996, Stephens 1998, Agee and Skinner 2005, Stephens and Moghaddas 2005). This study indicated that thinning, without slash reduction because of the helicopter yarding method used, increased surface fire behavior and brought stands close to historic basal area levels. The slash left after logging, plus smaller trees that were not logged, were treated after the thinning with a lop and scatter method. This expensive additional cost might not occur after every thinning operation, but can aid subsequent survival of residual trees (Agee and Skinner 2005). However, addition of <b>dead</b> <b>fuels</b> from thinning or insect outbreaks (Hummel and Agee 2003), or removal by prescribed fire, does not simply translate into altered fire hazard or severity. Fuelbed depth, surface-area-to-volume ratios, and distribution of loading by size class are fuel model parameters in addition to total loading that will affect fire behavior.|$|E
30|$|Initial <b>dead</b> <b>fuel</b> {{moisture}} {{values were}} set to 3 %, 4 %, and 5 % for 1 h, 10 h, and 100 h fuel moistures, respectively; and were then conditioned for each plot based on topography (slope, aspect, and elevation), shading (cloud and canopy cover), weather (temperature and relative humidity) and wind, similar to methods employed in FlamMap (Finney 2006). Ten years of hourly weather {{data were collected from}} National Weather Service weather stations within 25 km of each study site for a three-day period in August to calculate 90 th percentile wind and weather (NOAA 2007). These data were used to condition <b>dead</b> <b>fuel</b> moistures to create more realistic fuel conditions for fire behavior modeling, resulting in different <b>dead</b> <b>fuel</b> moisture conditions for each plot.

40|$|Spatially {{explicit}} {{predictions of}} fuel moisture content are crucial for quantifying fire danger indices and as inputs to fire behaviour models.

We calibrate and test the model at a woodland site in South East Australia, and then test the model at a range of sites in South East Australia and Southern California that vary in vegetation type, mean annual precipitation (129 - 1404 mmyear- 1) and leaf area index (0. 1 - 5. 7). We found that D modelled from remotely sensed land surface temperature performed slightly better than a model which also included total precipitable water (MAE 3 ̆c 1. 16 kPa and 1. 62 kPa respectively). D calculated with observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Terra satellite was under-predicted in areas with low leaf area index.

30|$|Grasslands {{account for}} {{a large portion of}} Earth’s fire-prone {{ecosystems}} and largely represent two so-called pyromes (similar to global syndromes of fire regimes, i.e., frequent-intense-large and frequent-cool-small; Archibald et al. 2013). In South Africa, grasslands compose almost one third of the land surface area (Mucina and Rutherford 2006, Bachinger et al. 2016). High seasonal rainfall in grasslands typically allows rapid fuel accumulation, resulting in some of the shortest fire return intervals (often < 2 years) on Earth, which may be shortened further by anthropogenic ignitions (Archibald et al. 2010 b, Bond and Parr 2010). In sourveld grasslands, in particular, fires tend to be more frequent later in the dry season (winter) when fire danger conditions are at their highest and grass curing has resulted in the accumulation of <b>dead</b> <b>fuels</b> (Van Wilgen et al. 2000). Large quantities of fine, flammable fuel make these sourveld highly adaptable to changing weather conditions, thus strongly influencing grassland fire regimes (Cheney and Sullivan 2008, Bond and Parr 2010).|$|E
30|$|The FMC can be {{estimated}} from field work, but this process is laborious and costly. For this reason, most operational estimates of FMC, particularly for <b>dead</b> <b>fuels,</b> are based on meteorological indices (Simard 1968, Finney 1998, Aguado et al. 2007). These methods require spatial interpolation to obtain complete spatial coverage. Due {{to the fact that}} live fuels are associated with more than weather conditions, alternative methods based on satellite images have been used to estimate FMC of live fuels (LFMC). These methods can be divided in two large groups, depending on whether they use empirical or simulation models. The former rely on statistical fittings between satellite derived indices and field measurements, and therefore are site-specific, but can be extended to areas with similar conditions (Chuvieco et al. 2004 b, García et al. 2008). The simulation models are based on radiative transfer equations and try to account for the impact of water content on plant reflectance at different wavelengths. These methods can be generalized to larger areas although their parametrization is more complex than empirical fittings (Ceccato 2001, Yebra et al. 2008 a).|$|E
30|$|The {{limitations}} of the Rothermel model for fire spread prediction in live fuels such as chaparral have been described (Lindenmuth and Davis 1973, Cohen and Bradshaw 1986) even though the model has been used with some success (Stevenson et al. 1974, Albini and Anderson 1982, Dimitrakopoulos and Dritsa 2003). Live fuels differ from <b>dead</b> <b>fuels</b> chemically and physically, and recent work with chaparral fuels has shown the importance of convection to successful fire spread under marginal conditions (Zhou et al. 2005, 2007). Ignition tests of individual chaparral leaves resulted {{in a wide range}} in ignition temperatures when a heating rate typical of wildland fires was used (Fletcher et al. 2007), and little to no dependence of time to ignition and ignition temperature on leaf thickness and leaf moisture mass was observed. A physical fire spread model initially developed by Pagni and Peterson (1973) was tested with limited success in chaparral prescribed fires and has been recently modified and compared with laboratory rate of spread experiments by Koo et al. (2005).|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Understanding and calculating fi re {{behaviour}} {{in various}} fuel types {{is essential for}} effective fi re management, including wildfi re suppression and fuels management. Fire spread in grassland fuel {{is affected by the}} curing level, the amount of <b>dead</b> <b>fuel</b> expressed {{as a percentage of the}} total (live and <b>dead</b> <b>fuel</b> combined). The infl uence of live fuel is included in various fi re models in different ways. U. S. fi re behavior prediction systems are based on Rothermel’s fi re spread model, which uses the load of live and <b>dead</b> <b>fuel</b> and the moisture content of each. Dynamic fuel models include a transfer of fuel load from the live to dead class as a function of live fuel moisture. Australian and New Zealand grassland fi re behavior models rely heavily on the curing level as a major determinant of the ability for a fi re to develop and spread, and place greater direct emphasis on both the proportion and moisture content of the <b>dead</b> fi ne <b>fuels.</b> A joint Australian and New Zealand study under the Australian Bushfi re Cooperative Research Centre (CRC) is addressing various methods of assessing curing levels in grasslands. Data from that study are used to evaluate the dynamic fuel load transfer function used in fuel models developed for the Rothermel spread model. Results showed that live fuel moisture is not an indicator of level of curing. A signifi cant difference is demonstrated in calculated rate of spread using the load transfer model versus direct entry of live fuel moisture and level of curing...|$|R

40|$|Managed {{and wild}} fires play a {{significant}} role in the ecology of heathlands in the UK but we currently have little ability to forecast fire behaviour or the likelihood of accidental wildfires. Like many shrubland fuel types, heathlands display significant structural complexity and the role of different fuel components in governing flammability has not been clear. Using a series of small, field-based ignition tests, we demonstrate the critical importance of the moisture content of dead fine fuels in the lower canopy for determining when sustaining fires in the vegetation canopy can develop. At moisture contents above c. 70 % both spot and line ignitions failed but where moisture contents were less than c. 60 % fires developed rapidly. The initial rate of spread of successful ignitions was primarily controlled by the moisture content of the lower canopy and the moss/litter layer. Models that predict the moisture content of elevated <b>dead</b> <b>fuels</b> and the moss litter layer are urgently needed in order to protect heathlands from wildfire and to allow forecasts of the suitability of conditions for prescribed burning to be developed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Grass senescence, or {{grassland}} curing, is {{a dynamic}} process in which grass fuels transition from a live to dead state and, in turn, influence fire dynamics. In the present study we examined the process of curing with specific consideration of changes in fuel structure that will affect potential fire behaviour. Our sampling protocol expanded the fuel component groups from two (live and dead) to four (green, senescing, new dead and old dead fuel). We found that all these components had significant fuel moisture content differences, thereby justifying our sampling protocol. Visual curing assessment predominantly resulted in an over-prediction bias of curing level and failed to capture {{the effect of the}} senescing process on fuel availability to combust due to misclassification of fuel components (e. g. senescing fuels with high fuel moisture content were classified as <b>dead</b> <b>fuels</b> because of their colouration).

40|$|International audienceForest {{fire danger}} {{is one of}} the main {{emergencies}} in many countries all over the world. To reduce the consequences, forest managers or fire officers use prevention, by reducing biomass, by locating fighting teams in exposed areas or by patrolling. To fight fire efficiently, they use suitable means: trucks, planes, helicopters, fire retardants. The keypoint of prevention and fighting is the assessment of danger, which can be done from different points of view and at different time scales: from historical data, by real time monitoring or by forecasting. A survey of operational danger rating methods shows two approaches: assessment of a global index, integrating several aspects of forest fires, or assessment of a set of indexes representing individually the key factors. This paper describes a combination of assessment methods, integrated in a decision support system. Four methods are used, related to fire occurrence, assessing the frequency of fires from historical data, inflammability of <b>dead</b> <b>fuels</b> and live fuels, traducing the behaviour after ignition and fire severity, evaluating the difficulty of fighting.

30|$|The {{idea behind}} burning in moist {{conditions}} {{to generate a}} patchier burn is that the increased fuel moisture effectively reduces fuel continuity and can increase patches of unburned areas that serve as insect refugia. Fuel continuity {{is a function of}} vegetation structure, including the horizontal and vertical spacing between patches of vegetation; in the absence of these spaces, increasing fuel moisture can effectively reduce continuity (Miller and Urban 2000) and increase burn patchiness (Knapp and Keeley 2006). This idea was not strongly supported by our results, as the optimal model for explaining the abundance of potential refugia included an interaction between <b>dead</b> <b>fuel</b> moisture and pre-burn cover of open ground. Higher <b>dead</b> <b>fuel</b> moistures only increased post-burn cover of unburned areas when the pre-burn fuel structure included higher cover of open ground (Figure 5). Without this pre-existing open ground, high fuel moistures did not reduce continuity enough to leave unburned or low-consumption areas.|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this thesis}} are {{to examine the}} fire regimes, fuel characteristics, fire {{behaviour}} and fire management of Tasmanian buttongrass moorlands. Major changes have occurred to the fire regime of southwest Tasmania over the past 170 years. The fire regime has changed from an Aboriginal regime of mostly frequent low intensity buttongrass moorland fires to the early European fire regime of frequent high intensity fires in all vegetation types, to a regime of low to medium intensity buttongrass moorland fires and finally to the current regime of very few fires. Buttongrass moorland fuel accumulation rates in western and southwestern Tasmania {{can be divided into}} two productivity groups, based on geological type. Within each productivity group, the vegetation cover and/or the time since the last fire can be used to model fuel load and the <b>dead</b> <b>fuel</b> load. <b>Dead</b> <b>fuel</b> moistures in buttongrass moorlands can be predicted from the relative humidity and dew point temperature. The main influences on buttongrass moorland rates of fire spread are wind speed, <b>dead</b> <b>fuel</b> moisture and age. Flame height in these moorlands is highly correlated with the fuel consumption rate, which in tum is controlled by the rate of fire spread, <b>fuel</b> load and <b>dead</b> <b>fuel</b> moisture. Operational fire behaviour models have been developed which use the wind speed, temperature, relative humidity, age and site productivity to predict the frre spread rate and flame height. The prescriptions for burning buttongrass moorlands have also been refined. Wildland fire management is a major problem in western and southwestern Tasmania. This is mainly due to the extensive area of fire-adapted and fire-dependent vegetation, the small area burnt by natural fires, the high incidence of arson in some areas and across much of the region, the old-growth nature of the buttongrass moorland vegetation. If we are going to preserve the ecological values of the region whilst minimising the economic and social costs of management, {{we are going to have}} to reintroduce frre into the region. Such reintroductions of fire will need to be performed in a highly sophisticated manner in order to maximise the potential that they will achieve the desired outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Grazers {{and fire}} have been characterised as 'competing' {{consumers}} of vegetation biomass. Few studies of fire/grazing interactions {{have been carried}} out in Australian vegetation. This study examines how vertebrate grazing affects fire potential in native grasslands in Tasmania. The study was carried out at three highland and three lowland sites over 18 months. Vegetation biomass (fuel load) was measured in grazed and ungrazed quadrats every three months. Percentage <b>dead</b> <b>fuel</b> (curing) was also recorded at these times, with additional observations being made over summer. Daily values for temperature, humidity, wind speed and rainfall at each site were derived. Soil nutrient levels at each site were also recorded. Densities of macropods and sheep were estimated from scat (dung pellet) counts, while wombat densities were estimated from spotlight surveys. density estimates were converted into a single index of grazing intensity on the basis of published field metabolic rates. Grazing intensity calculated by this method was related to the amount of vegetation biomass removed by grazers. A model for predicting grassland fire sustainability was developed. Fuel characteristics and weather conditions were recorded for 78 non-sustaining and 33 sustaining test fires. The probability of fires sustaining was related to <b>dead</b> <b>fuel,</b> moisture, fuel load and percentage <b>dead</b> <b>fuel.</b> Threshold values for fire sustainability were identified. Grazing substantially reduced vegetation biomass in short-grass grasslands, but had no effect in tussock grasslands. this difference appeared to relate to differences in palatability. Grazing has no consistent effect on percentage <b>dead</b> <b>fuel.</b> This variable was strongly related to soil moisture, though this relationship varied amongst the dominant grass taxa. Fires were predicted to be sustaining on substantially fewer days in grazed relative to ungrazed vegetation at short- grass sites, while there was no difference at tussock sites. The differing results between structural types reflected differences in vegetation palatability. At short -grass sites most biomass is consumed by grazers and fires are unlikely, while at tussock sites grazing has little impact on fuel loads and fires can occur whenever weather conditions are favourable. Sites can potentially move between short-grass and tussock grass if disturbance regimes are altered. The degree of 'competition' between fire and grazers for vegetation biomass appears largely determined by vegetation palatability. The widespread assumptions that indigenous Tasmanians frequently burnt lowland grasslands and that burning is preferable to grazing as a management tool in native grasslands require reconsideration in light of the findings of this study. ...|$|R
30|$|A {{definitive}} {{value for}} moisture of extinction—the fuel moisture content at which fire will not spread, {{or when the}} probability of ignition is 1 %—has not been widely agreed upon for grasses (Dimitrakopoulos et al. 2010). Fire ignition and spread was difficult when moisture content approached 35 % for spinifex grass fuel in Australia, primarily hard spinifex (Triodia basedowii E. Pritz.) and soft spinifex (Plectrachne schinzii Henrard) (Burrows et al. 1991). Laboratory ignition tests for grass samples consisting primarily of Imperata cylindrica in Indonesia found moisture of extinction to be 40 % for dead grass and 44 % for live grass (de Groot and Wang 2005). Recent field experiments in Greece estimated the moisture of extinction for slender oat (Avena barbata Link.) at 55.5 % (Dimitrakopoulos et al. 2010). Day of burn weather and topographic conditions also influence moisture of extinction, particularly wind speed, which {{has been shown to}} overwhelm ignition potential when fuel moisture is high (Dimitra-kopoulos et al. 2010). Morphological properties of individual species, including size of culms and leaves, as well as residual <b>dead</b> <b>fuels</b> (not part of our sampling) may also increase the probability of ignition and affect spread, particularly in the robust bunchgrasses (i.e., California fescue).|$|E

To better understand bark beetle/wildfire dynamics, a study was conducted in beetle-infested areas of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) in northwestern Wyoming and adjacent portions of Montana and Idaho. Key questions that were addressed include: (1) What are the current patterns of beetle outbreaks in the GYE at both broad and fine scales?

30|$|It is {{reasonable}} to assert that the variability of fire effects on vegetation may not be adequately captured by a simple count {{of the number of}} times a stand has been burned. To address that possible limitation, the once- and twice-burned class variable used to represent the treatment in the Anova models was further explored using the dNBR approach to quantifying fire severity ([URL] e.g., Picotte and Robertson 2011) (Figure 7). While these results generally supported our use of the simpler class variable approach (i.e., lower values of dNBR were consistently associated with the once-burned plots and higher values with those that were burned twice), a considerable range of dNBR values was also represented within each burn treatment. The study plots were located at higher and drier than average landscape positions within the respective burn blocks, and were consistently associated with higher dNBR values. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the second fires in these areas burned hotter than the first as the result of abundant <b>dead</b> <b>fuels</b> generated by the initial burn, helping to explain why the burn count variable performed adequately {{in the context of this}} study.

The amount of fuel available to burn strongly determines the likelihood of a fire occurring and the nature of the fire (e. g. severity, intensity) (Bradstock, 2010). Traditionally researchers have attempted to predict future fire events by manually measuring fuel in the field. However such methods at large spatial scales are time-consuming, costly, require man-power and are limited for regions inaccessible to humans. For these reasons remote sensing methods are becoming increasingly popular to measure fuel (Frokling et al, 2009). However, only a few studies have been conducted in Australia to investigate the potential of remote sensing for measuring fuel. Australian studies have only tested a small number of spectral indices, have not tested the effects of the understorey layers on the spectral signal over long time-periods of fuel accumulation and have not taken into consideration <b>dead</b> <b>fuel</b> components in the forest layers. This research project attempted to fill these gaps in the research by assessing the ability of Landsat 5 TM in measuring fuel loads. Seven different indices were compared in their ability to measure fuel in Sydney Coastal Dry Sclerophyll Forest, a forest characterised by a prominent understorey and the presence of both live and <b>dead</b> <b>fuel.</b> Ground truth data extracted from a fuel database for 31 sites was regressed against spectral indice values calculated from the Landsat images. Two approaches were used: Approach 1 did not account for phenological variation; Approach 2 did account for phenological variation. Results found that overall moisture indices (NDIIb 5 and NDIIb 7) performed the best at measuring fuel cover, as they were not greatly affected by phenological variation or hindered by the presence of <b>dead</b> <b>fuel.</b> Greenness indices (SR, NDVI, GNDVI and SAVI) performed well at measuring fuel but only when phenological effects were accounted for and <b>dead</b> <b>fuel</b> was eliminated from the GT data. When indices performed well they all improved with the addition of the elevated fuel cover layer, suggesting that in this forest type, the understorey significantly contributes to the spectral signal. SATVI was affected by phenological variations, but when this was accounted for it was not as affected by the presence of dead vegetation. The main implication from this study was that, in multiple layered forests that contain <b>dead</b> <b>fuel</b> in the layers, indices that incorporate SWIR wavelengths may prove to be more accurate and successful to use for measuring fuel than the traditional greenness indices...|$|R

This likely reflects microsite variation that is amplified during drier and hotter burns; rocks or patches of {{dry organic matter}} may elevate local temperatures while other locations remain cooler. When fuels have more moisture, these differences are muted, resulting in a more uniform distribution of temperatures.|$|R

Dead 1 -, 10 - and 100 -h fuel moisture content values were set to 6, 7 and 8  %, respectively. Live herbaceous and woody fuel moisture content values were set to 60 and 90  %, respectively (scenario D 2 L 2 —low moisture content).|$|R
