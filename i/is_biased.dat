5|$|Many more gene {{sequences}} {{are known}} than protein structures. Further, {{the set of}} solved structures <b>is</b> <b>biased</b> toward proteins {{that can be easily}} subjected to the conditions required in X-ray crystallography, one of the major structure determination methods. In particular, globular proteins are comparatively easy to crystallize in preparation for X-ray crystallography. Membrane proteins, by contrast, are difficult to crystallize and are underrepresented in the PDB. Structural genomics initiatives have attempted to remedy these deficiencies by systematically solving representative structures of major fold classes. Protein structure prediction methods attempt to provide a means of generating a plausible structure for proteins whose structures have not been experimentally determined.|$|E
5|$|Norreis was {{appointed}} to the abbacy of Evesham Abbey in 1190 and was blessed as abbot on 13 January 1190. He owed his appointment to King Richard and to Baldwin's attempts to make the dismissal from Christ Church look less like a defeat for the archbishop. Norreis also claimed that he received the office in return for unspecified services he rendered to Richard. There was no attempt at an election by the monks, a lack which went against canon law. During his tenure of office, his monks accused him of fornication, excessive drinking, gluttony, setting up favourites, starving the monks, and appropriating monastic property for his own use. A further offence was his habit of wearing secular clothing rather than the monastic habit prescribed by the Benedictine Rule. All these charges come from one of his monks, the historian Thomas of Marlborough, who wrote much of the history of Evesham known as the Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham. Thomas's account of Norreis's rule <b>is</b> <b>biased</b> against the abbot and is a self-aggrandising account of how Thomas single-handedly triumphed over both his and his abbey's foes. Norreis did manage some good for the abbey, as it was while he was abbot that the crossing tower of the monastic church was completed.|$|E

5000|$|This {{estimate}} {{is based on}} coalescent theory. Watterson's estimator is commonly used for its simplicity. When its assumptions are met, the estimator is unbiased and the variance of the estimator decreases with increasing sample size or recombination rate. However, the estimator can <b>be</b> <b>biased</b> by population structure. For example, [...] <b>is</b> downwardly <b>biased</b> in an exponentially growing population. It can also <b>be</b> <b>biased</b> by violation of the infinite-sites mutational model; if multiple mutations can overwrite one another, Watterson's estimator will <b>be</b> <b>biased</b> downward.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{estimate}} {{a model of}} the determinants of economic and social development that takes seriously three of the criticisms of panel data models in the existing growth literature: that long run coefficients <b>are</b> <b>biased</b> because the lagged dependent variable is not strictly exogenous; that they <b>are</b> <b>biased</b> because of slope coefficient heterogeneity; and that they <b>are</b> <b>biased</b> because of explanatory variable endogeneity. The model indicates that there are strong causal relationships in both directions between on the one hand, economic development, and on the other, social and political development. ...|$|R

25|$|The use of {{the term}} n−1 is called Bessel's correction, and it is also used in sample {{covariance}} and the sample standard deviation (the square root of variance). The square root is a concave function and thus introduces negative bias (by Jensen's inequality), which depends on the distribution, and thus the corrected sample standard deviation (using Bessel's correction) <b>is</b> <b>biased.</b> The unbiased estimation of standard deviation is a technically involved problem, though for the normal distribution using the term n−1.5 yields an almost unbiased estimator.|$|E

25|$|The {{keystream}} {{generated by}} the RC4 <b>is</b> <b>biased</b> in varying degrees towards certain sequences making it vulnerable to distinguishing attacks. The best such attack is due to Itsik Mantin and Adi Shamir who showed that the second output byte of the cipher was biased toward zero with probability 1/128 (instead of 1/256). This {{is due to the}} fact that if the third byte of the original state is zero, and the second byte is not equal to 2, then the second output byte is always zero. Such bias can be detected by observing only 256 bytes.|$|E
