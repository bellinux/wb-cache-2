25|$|Recently, {{metabolic}} {{concerns have}} been of grave concern to clinicians, patients and the FDA. In 2003, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required all manufacturers of atypical antipsychotics to change their labeling to include a warning {{about the risks of}} hyperglycemia and diabetes with atypical antipsychotics. It must also be pointed out that although all atypicals must carry the warning on their labeling, some evidence shows that atypicals are not equal in their effects on weight and insulin sensitivity. The general consensus is that clozapine and olanzapine are associated with the greatest effects on weight gain and decreased insulin sensitivity, followed by risperidone and quetiapine. Ziprasidone and aripiprazole are thought to have the smallest effects on weight and insulin resistance, but clinical experience with these newer agents is not as developed as that with the older agents. The mechanism of these adverse effects is not completely understood but it is believed to result from a complex interaction between a number of pharmacologic actions of these drugs. Their effects on weight are believed to mostly derive from their actions on the H1 and 5-HT2C receptors, while their effects on insulin sensitivity are believed {{to be the result of}} a combination of their effects on body weight (as increased body mass is known to be a risk factor for insulin resistance) and their antagonistic effects on the M3receptor. Some of the newer agents, however, such as risperidone and its metabolite paliperidone, ziprasidone, lurasidone, aripiprazole, asenapine and <b>iloperidone</b> have clinically-insignificant effects on the M3 receptor and appear to carry a lower risk of insulin resistance. Whereas clozapine, olanzapine and quetiapine (indirectly via its active metabolite, norquetiapine) all antagonise the M3 receptor at therapeutic-relevant concentrations.|$|E

It was 13% {{more effective than}} lurasidone and <b>iloperidone,</b> approximately as effective as ziprasidone and asenapine, and 12-16% less effective than haloperidol, quetiapine, and aripiprazole.|$|E
50|$|<b>Iloperidone</b> is {{used for}} the {{treatment}} of schizophrenia. In a 2013 study in a comparison of 15 antipsychotic drugs in effectivity in treating schizophrenic symptoms, <b>iloperidone</b> was found to be almost as effective as ziprasidone, chlorpromazine, and asenapine, and as effective as lurasidone.|$|E
50|$|<b>Iloperidone</b> {{performed}} well against a prepulse inhibition (PPI) experiment, {{which was designed}} to gauge the extent of sensory gating in rats, a process disrupted in schizophrenia. Prepulse inhibition is the reduction in the amount of startle the subject gives when presented with a non-startling stimulus. Those exhibiting high levels of psychosis present a deficit in PPI. Psychosis induced using PCP, apomorphine, and cirazoline, were all prevented with the concurrent administration of <b>iloperidone.</b> The PPI deficit normally incurred by each psychotic drug was significantly diminished by the co administration of <b>iloperidone.</b> The results of this experiment provided strong evidence for iloperidone’s merit as an effective treatment for psychotic disorders. <b>Iloperidone</b> has also been shown to reduce the effects of apomorphine induced climbing behavior in mice as well as the effects of head twitching induced by 5-HT in rats.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the impact of}} <b>iloperidone</b> treatment on metabolic parameters. Methods: Data were analyzed from 3210 patients who received <b>iloperidone</b> and 587 patients who received placebo for up to 2 years during 9 Phase II and Phase III studies (integrated safety database). Patients were pooled by most frequent <b>iloperidone</b> dose into 3 groups: 4 - 8 mg/d, 10 - 16 mg/d, and 20 - 24 mg/d. Laboratory data from 8 studies were random (fasting and nonfasting) while patients from 1 study (n = 447) were all sampled at fasting. Results: Mean (standard deviation [SD]) weight gain from baseline to endpoint was 2. 1 (6. 8) kg for all patients on <b>iloperidone.</b> Fasting mean (SD) total cholesterol changes from baseline to end of study were 8. 2 (31. 6) for <b>iloperidone</b> and - 2. 2 (35. 2) mg/dL for placebo.

40|$|BACKGROUND The {{development}} of more effective and safer drugs for the optimal treatment of schizophrenia has become quite essential in the present era. We find limited literature directly comparing {{the efficacy of the}} two ‘atypical’ antipsychotics, i. e. olanzapine and <b>iloperidone.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS The study participants were persons diagnosed with schizophrenia between the age of 18 - 65 years who were randomised to treatment with olanzapine or <b>iloperidone</b> and analysed for symptoms on the basis of Positive and Negative Symptom Scores (PANSS) at 4 and 8 weeks. Statistical Analysis- Mean changes in the PANSS were analysed by paired and independent t-tests. RESULTS There was statistically significant and similar reduction in clinical symptoms at eight weeks in both olanzapine (PANSS score of 92. 22 (± 17. 03) at baseline to 78. 63 (± 15. 30) at 8 weeks; p< 0. 001) and <b>iloperidone</b> (PANSS score of 93. 75 (± 19. 70) at baseline to 74. 88 (± 30. 52) at 8 weeks; p< 0. 001) groups (p< 0. 001). Olanzapine showed significantly higher reduction (p< 0. 01) in PANSS as compared to <b>iloperidone</b> at four weeks particularly in the PANSS negative symptom score. The two groups did not differ in the treatment completion rates.
