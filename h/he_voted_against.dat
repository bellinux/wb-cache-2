50|$|Fry gains {{control of}} That Guy's shares, and <b>he</b> <b>votes</b> <b>against</b> the merger. The Planet Express staff {{initially}} tries {{to convince him}} to sell the company, because the sale of their stock will make them all rich. However, Fry has already given a speech that drove the stock's price through the floor. Since the staff will be poor no matter what <b>he</b> does, <b>he</b> <b>votes</b> <b>against</b> the merger.

Edwards voted for the Missouri Compromise in 1820, a bill that Thomas sponsored. <b>He</b> <b>voted</b> <b>against</b> a law {{reducing}} prices for federal land, which made both Edwards and Representative Daniel Pope Cook targets of criticism at home.

The bill passed in this session, but newly elected president Andrew Jackson vetoed it.|$|E

5|$|In the Senate, Nixon took a {{prominent}} position in opposing global communism, traveling frequently and {{speaking out against}} it.

Nixon also criticized President Harry S. Truman's handling of the Korean War.

5|$|Sir Jonah Barrington {{was born}} in 1760 near Abbeyleix in the Queen's County (Co. Laois). He was first elected to Parliament as a member for Tuam in 1790. He lost this seat in 1798 and was elected as a member for Banagher in 1799. <b>He</b> <b>voted</b> <b>against</b> the Act of Union in 1801 {{and as a result}} he was {{deprived}} of his £1,000 a year sinecure in the Customs House and this also stopped his further advancement. In 1809 he published, in five parts, the first volume of the Historic Memoirs of Ireland. It is thought that he was induced to delay the second volume – the English government shrinking from the exposure of their conduct in carrying the Act of Union, and it was understood that to purchase his silence he was permitted to reside in France from about 1815.|$|E
50|$|In the 1982 John Aquilina {{wrote in}} the Daily Mirror {{that it was his}} electorate's and his {{personal}} view that homosexuality should not be decriminalised in New South Wales and <b>he</b> would <b>vote</b> <b>against</b> it in any case.

In 1948, he sponsored a bill to provide price support for burley tobacco at 90 percent of parity. He insisted on {{an amendment to the}} War Claims Act of 1948 that benefits to veterans injured as prisoners of war of the Germans and Japanese during World War II be paid immediately using enemy assets.

5|$|Fillmore sent {{a special}} message to Congress on August 6, 1850, {{disclosing}} {{the letter from}} Governor Bell and his reply, warning that armed Texans would be viewed as intruders, and urging Congress to defuse sectional tensions by passing the Compromise. Without the Great Triumvirate of John C. Calhoun, Webster and Clay who had long dominated the Senate, Douglas and others led that body towards the administration-backed package of bills. Each bill passed the Senate {{with the support of}} the section that wanted it, plus a few members who were determined to see all the bills passed. The battle then moved to the House, which had a Northern majority because of population. Most contentious was the Fugitive Slave Bill, whose provisions were anathema to abolitionists. Fillmore applied pressure to get Northern Whigs to abstain rather than oppose, including New Yorkers—threatening to kill the renomination of Congressman Abraham Schermerhorn of Rochester, whose constituents included Frederick Douglass, if <b>he</b> <b>voted</b> <b>against</b> the bill. Through the legislative process, various changes were made, including the setting of a boundary between New Mexico Territory and Texas—the state would be given a payment to settle any claims. California was admitted as a free state, the District slave trade was ended, and the final status of slavery in New Mexico and Utah would be settled later. Fillmore signed the bills as they reached his desk, holding the Fugitive Slave Bill for two days until he received a favorable opinion as to its constitutionality from the new Attorney General, John J. Crittenden. Although some Northerners were unhappy at the Fugitive Slave Act, relief was widespread, as was the hope this would settle the slavery question.|$|E
