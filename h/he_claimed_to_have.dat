5|$|According to late 13th-century documents, the Hundred Rolls, King Henry II gave William {{the office}} of steward of Exmoor, and lands at North Petherton, Somerset. William was the prebend of St Decumans in the cathedral chapter of Bath Cathedral by 9 May 1204. <b>He</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> held the office since 1194 during a later dispute with Savaric fitzGeldewin, the Bishop of Bath and another canon of the cathedral, Roger Porretanus, who claimed the prebend.

5|$|Aleister Crowley {{wrote in}} The Antecedents of Thelema, (1926), an {{incomplete}} work not published in his day, that Rabelais not only set forth {{the law of}} Thelema in a way similar to how Crowley understood it, but predicted and described in code Crowley's life and the holy text that <b>he</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> received, The Book of the Law. Crowley said the work he had received was deeper, showing in more detail the technique people should practice, and revealing scientific mysteries. He said that Rabelais confines himself to portraying an ideal, rather than addressing questions of political economy and similar subjects, which must be solved in order to realize the Law.|$|E
5|$|Although {{pronounced}} differently, Wicca {{is related}} to the Old English word wicca, which referred to sorcerers in Anglo-Saxon England. In the early 1950s, English Wiccan Gerald Gardner, founder of the Gardnerian tradition, referred to the Pagan Witchcraft community as the Wica. <b>He</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> learned the term during his initiation into the New Forest coven in 1939. By the late 1950s, Gardner's rival Charles Cardell, founder of his own tradition, had begun referring to the religion's followers as Wiccens, and possibly used Wicca in reference to the religion itself.|$|E
5|$|Channel Orange (stylized as channel ORANGE) is the 2012 debut studio album by American R {{singer and}} {{songwriter}} Frank Ocean. After releasing his mixtape Nostalgia, Ultra in 2011, Ocean began writing new songs with Malay, a producer and songwriter who assisted him with recording the album at EastWest Studios in Hollywood. Rather than rely on samples {{as he had}} with his mixtape, Ocean wanted to approach sound and song structure differently on Channel Orange. He titled the album as {{a reference to the}} neurological phenomenon grapheme-color synesthesia and the color <b>he</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> perceived during the summer he first fell in love.|$|E

5|$|The Mission of the Guardian Angel {{was somewhere}} in the {{vicinity}} of Chicago from 1696 until it was abandoned in around 1700. The Fox Wars effectively closed the Chicago area to Europeans {{in the first part of}} the 18th century. The first non-native to re-settle in the area may have been a trader named Guillory, who might have had a trading-post near Wolf Point on the Chicago River in around 1778. After Point du Sable, Antoine Ouilmette is the next recorded resident of Chicago; <b>he</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> settled at the mouth of the Chicago River in July 1790, a few months after Hugh Heward visited Point du Sable.|$|E
5|$|Three weeks later, The Daily Dot {{published}} {{an interview with}} Wright. He told reporter Mike Wehner {{that he was a}} U.S. citizen who lives in Poland, and that the videos were meant as an art project. After finishing the video, in May 2015, he had left three copies, two on discs in a subway and park in Poland, and the last the one posted to 4chan. Reporter Mike Wehner concluded thus that the YouTube user AETBX had no involvement in the video's creation. As a way of authenticating himself, Wright challenged visitors to his Facebook page to replicate the plague doctor mask, which <b>he</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> designed and built himself.|$|E
5|$|After Urilla's death, Wyatt {{went through}} a {{downward}} spiral and {{had a series of}} legal problems. On March 14, 1871, Barton County filed a lawsuit against Earp and his sureties. Earp was in charge of collecting license fees for Lamar, which funded local schools, and he was accused of failing to turn in the fees. On March 31, James Cromwell filed a lawsuit against Earp, alleging that Earp had falsified court documents about the amount of money collected from Cromwell to satisfy a judgment. To make up the difference between what Earp turned in and Cromwell owed (which <b>he</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> paid), the court seized Cromwell's mowing machine and sold it for $38. Cromwell's suit claimed that Earp owed him $75, the estimated value of the machine.|$|E

Until recently, he held the record for the most points scored (78) in a single game by a Guatemalan. He also taught at a primary school (called Santa Elena III), where <b>he</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> spent six hours giving lessons and the rest of the day playing soccer. This earned him a visit from a Ministry of Education representative, who was sent to evaluate his pupils. The representative found that the students' education was actually above average. In 1988, he became the basketball coach of a boys' school (called Instituto Don Bosco).|$|E
5|$|Bahá'u'lláh {{became a}} {{follower}} of the Báb in Persia in 1845. Three years after the Báb was executed, he was exiled to Baghdad (then {{a part of the}} Ottoman Empire), where in 1863 he proclaimed the Bahá'í Faith when he declared himself He whom God shall make manifest, a messianic figure in Babi theology. Bahá'u'lláh based this announcement on a vision of the Maid of Heaven <b>he</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> had while imprisoned in the Síyáh-Chál in Tehran, Persia. He would be further exiled to Edirne and ultimately to the prison city of Acre, Palestine (present-day Israel), where he died.

5|$|Balzac's {{work habits}} are legendary, he wrote from 1 am to 8 am {{every night and}} {{sometimes}} even longer. Balzac could write very rapidly; some of his novels, written with a quill, were composed at a pace equal to thirty words per minute on a modern typewriter. His preferred method was to eat a light meal at five or six in the afternoon, then sleep until midnight. He then rose and wrote for many hours, fueled by innumerable cups of black coffee. He would often work for fifteen hours or more at a stretch; <b>he</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> once worked for 48 hours with only three hours of rest in the middle.|$|E
