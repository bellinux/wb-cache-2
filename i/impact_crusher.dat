The aggregates output from the Rock Vertical Shaft <b>Impact</b> <b>Crusher</b> (RoR VSI), had been classified to six groups of shapes then divided further into two categories namely the high quality aggregates and the low quality aggregates. The characteristics of the aggregates such as shape, size and color, do play an important roles in the development of high strength concrete. In order to produce high quality aggregates, the system would need to be monitored and maintained continuously by analyzing the past and current data. Presently, there is no database system to store the images for the classified data. The conventional method of the aggregates is done manually which is slow, highly subjective and laborious. Therefore, a local database system is proposed to store information could help to overcome this problem. The images and aggregates ’ recognition and classification data will be kept in order and it will have a simple and easy way of storing and retrieving information. The machine performance can be retrieved for any period of time by calculating the output for high quality aggregates out of total of aggregates produced.

40|$|Abstract only - The {{existing}} {{construction waste}} recycling technologies and standards have been long applied in construction and demolition (C&D) waste recycling, mainly {{focused on the}} production and use of coarse recycled aggregates. Very few papers and process focus on the production of recycled sand although some previous results show that fine aggregates fraction (below 4. 8 mm) represents around 40 to 60 % (in mass) of the Brazilian waste and it is usually down cycled as road sub-base or disposed in landfills. The quality of the recycled aggregate is strictly related {{to the content of}} porous and low strength phases, as the patches of cement attached to the recycled aggregate. Despite being the crucial factor for aggregate performance, the removal of adhered cement paste is not a simple task. Some technologies have already been described in the literature, even though, to the moment none of these technologies has clearly succeeded in reaching the large market available. This paper presents a summary of the main properties of the sand produced from C&D waste by tertiary crushing at vertical shaft impactor crusher (attrition and abrasion comminution). Additionally mineral processing technologies were applied on the attained product, such as density concentration by shaking table and spirals and magnetic separation at rare earth roll separator. The main properties of recycled sand are discussed and compared to the previous C&D waste, respectively: apparent density, water absorption, chemical composition, porosity, particle shape and cement paste content. The results demonstrated that the comminution by vertical shaft <b>impact</b> <b>crusher</b> allowed producing a VSI-sand with low porosity and water absorption. The concentration by shaking table at narrow sieve fractions led to a product with low porosity and reduced content of cement paste, although products from spiral concentrator for the bulk sample had only the effect of classification instead of concentration. The non-magnetic products presented similar characteristics of the heavy product from the shaking table plus separation of micaceous minerals. The aim of producing sand from construction and demolition waste through mineral processing unit operations changes the recycling approach and contributes for upcycling the recycled sand...|$|E
40|$|Aggregate {{quality is}} of great importance, and in this context it is {{essential}} to understand how various process parameters influence the product quality characteristics. Thus, {{there is a need for}} aggregate producers to improve their process knowledge. Research has led to an improved understanding of how different process parameters affect the outcomes of specific comminution processes. In aggregate production, breakage models are one example of such a research result. These models have been refined over the years. The breakage models that have been presented to date can accurately predict the size distribution of aggregates. On the other hand, they cannot normally predict any other material characteristics such as shape and strength. This thesis outlines the research to date, which has focused on a frequently discussed quality parameter, namely the shape of the product. Knowledge of various methodologies is required to measure this parameter. A novel method for measuring the shape of fine aggregates is presented. The rheology test, the methodology of which was originally based on a New Zealand standard, can be correlated with other data to measure particle shape in accordance with the F-aspect method. The correlation between these methods is very good, and since the rheology test is easy to use, it is suitable for a quarry or a basic test facility. The cone crusher is the most commonly used tertiary stage crusher today. One of its great advantages is that it produces a relatively low amount of fines. However, it only produces acceptable particle shapes for certain fraction sizes. The vertical shaft <b>impact</b> <b>crusher</b> (VSI) creates particles of a very satisfactory shape across all fractions, including fine aggregate, as confirmed by studies using the aforementioned rheology test. This thesis presents two models for predicting shape in crushed aggregate from a cone crusher. The first model is empirical, and my conclusion is that there are four dominating parameters affecting shape: the average feed size, the closed side setting (CSS), throw and eccentric speed. To further investigate how compressive breakage affects particle shape, an inter-particle breakage model is introduced. This model simulates a specific crushing stage inside the crusher. Simulation results show that the outcome from a crushing event can be predicted with good accuracy. A VSI model for describing particle size and shape is presented in this work. It is proposed that the dominating breakage mechanism in a VSI equipped with a rock box is of abrasive character. Abrasive breakage can appropriately shape all particle sizes, assuming the crusher is operated at a proper velocity. The empirical cone crusher model and the VSI models are combined in a mathematical simulation in order to determine how a crushing plant should be operated to maximise both yield and aggregate quality. The results show that there exists a set of rules to determine the crusher and screen settings that will achieve the best performance in terms of product yield and quality requirements...|$|E
40|$|Issue: A {{number of}} types of {{crushing}} mechanisms have been tried to reduce glass bottles and containers to cullet. In selecting the proper crushing equipment, a potential user should {{be familiar with the}} various types. Selection and use of inappropriate equipment may result in excessive wear on equipment or reduced throughput, leading to increased operating costs. Further, some types of crushing equipment will fracture glass in a way that produces shards rather than uniformly shaped particles. This best practice introduces some of the basic types of glass crushers. Best Practice: Designs of glass crushers have evolved from equipment used by the rock crushing and industrial minerals processing industries. Two types crushing equipment are abrasion <b>crushing</b> and <b>impact</b> <b>crushing.</b> Abrasion crushing (or, more correctly, attrition), uses friction and compression to fracture material and includes equipment such as jaw crushers and cone crushers. Because of the highly abrasive nature of glass, impact-crushing equipment is preferred over abrasion crushing for greater durability and more uniform shape. Glass crushers fall into an intermediate area of materials processing. They are generally smaller than rock crushers, primarily because of volume requirements.

40|$|The dumping cost of wasted {{concrete}} {{including the}} rejected units in precast concrete plants {{is expected to}} keep rising as the production increases. The waste material from precast concrete hollow core floors (hcu) is high grade and uncontaminated material. This research work was carried out to investigate mainly the strength and other engineering properties of high strength concrete made with recycled concrete aggregate derived from rejected hcu. Three major categories (based on a questionnaire) were investigated: (i) Type of crushers and the crushing method, (ii) The properties of RCA output from these crushers, (iii) The performance of fresh and hardened concrete, including prestressed concrete, with these RCA. The input material for the crushers was from the same origin of disposed hcu's. The waste concrete was crushed to - 14 mm using three different types of crushers - the cone, impact and jaw crushers. The recycled material was separated into fractions of 14 mm, 10 mm and - 5 mm, and tested for physical and mechanical properties relevant to use in concrete. Concrete was then made using zero (control mix), 20 % and 50 % replacement of recycled coarse (RCCA), recycled fine (RCFA) and mixed (RCCA+RCFA) aggregates. All three crushers produced acceptable shape and strength of RCCA. Some properties are competitive to that of natural limestone aggregate. RCFA was much coarser than river gravel and just complied with the British Standard coarse grading limits. The <b>impact</b> <b>crusher</b> performed best with regard to most aggregate properties, e. g. flakiness, strength and water absorption, but has a disadvantage in producing {{a large amount of}} fine-to-coarse RCA. Concerning shape and strength, RCA showed similar properties, and in some cases better, than the conventional limestone aggregate. The water absorption for RCA is 3 to 4 times greater than the natural aggregates. For that reason an extra amount of water (called free water) will be added to the mix to compensate the water absorptions for aggregates. Some proportions of this extra added water may not be absorbed by the aggregates and will float to interrupt the design W/C ratio and caused it to increase. The slump value of fresh concrete made with RCA varied widely depending on the percentage and type of replacement, and the type of crusher. The compaction factor of fresh concrete made with RCA was more consistent and logical. Compressive strength of concrete made with RCA were generally within ± 5 N/mm 2 of the control. For tensile strength, RCA showed similar performance to that of natural limestone. The SS density of concrete with RCA is lower than that of the control concrete and is lower if the replacement percentages increase. Using RCFA causes higher bleeding rate and considerably reduces density and strength, and the severity increases as the replacements of RCFA increases. Using natural limestone aggregates with RCFA will minimize this poor behaviour and maintain the strength to certain extent. However joining RCCA with RCFA will not limit the poor behaviour and is not recommended. For bonding reinforcing bars most methods indicated that high replacement (100 %) of CA cause some reduction in bond strength. In pretensioning wires the RCA concrete had a better performance in bond but some reduction was still reported. Prestressed X-shape beams were used to assess the effects of using of RCA on the performance of hollow core slabs. For 20 % RCCA replacements, the prestressing loss, deflection and X-beam flexure crack failure were similar to the standard X-beam, at least and within the design limit. However at higher replacements (50 %) some deterioration starts to reveal and the effects are even greater when using a combination of RCCA and RCFA.

40|$|AbstractHadfield steels {{are widely}} used in the {{production}} of liners for rock crushing applications due to their good wear resistance and high toughness. Because of the high replacement frequency and cost of these liners, improvements in the properties of Hadfield steels may represent a great economic benefit for mining operators. Therefore, correctly assessing wear performance is a relevant matter in the research and development activities regarding Hadfield steels. However, conventional laboratory tests may not accurately mimic the conditions of impact and gouging abrasion occurring in crushing applications. Field tests may represent a complementary source of information particularly useful in the optimization of Hadfield steels. In this work, the wear performance of two Hadfield steels was investigated through field testing. Their characteristics included high carbon content and two different levels of manganese content. Two sites were chosen for the assessment: a pebble crushing plant and an aggregate plant. The first site presented very hard material and compression crushing conditions, whereas the second site presented <b>impact</b> <b>crushing</b> conditions. The use of field tests allowed comparing wear ratios between both steels and it also permitted to identify critical issues constraining steels performance, such as microstructure embrittlement. Despite some limitations, the results from the field tests demonstrated that better wear performance was associated with higher manganese content...|$|R

Blunt pancreatic injuries occur more commonly {{in the body of}} the gland, accounting for two-thirds of cases, and are typically caused by a <b>crushing</b> <b>impact</b> against the vertebral column.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} an optimal control model {{to improve the}} operation efficiency of a vertical shaft <b>impact</b> (VSI) <b>crushing</b> process. The optimal control model takes the energy cost as the performance index to be minimized by accounting for the time-of-use (TOU) tariff. The control variables in the developed model are the belt conveyor feed flow rate, the VSI crusher rotor feed rate and the bi-flow or cascade flow rate. The effectiveness of the developed model is shown through the simulation results of the crushing process in a coal-fired power plant...|$|R
