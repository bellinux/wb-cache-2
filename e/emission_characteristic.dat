The structural plane has an important influence on the mechanical and acoustic <b>emission</b> <b>characteristics</b> of rock. Scholars carried out laboratory experiments and numerical simulations on rocks with structural plane. Meanwhile, the relationship among the structural plane, mechanical properties, and acoustic <b>emission</b> <b>characteristics</b> was also established (Liu et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2013; Han and Zhang 2014; Su et al. 2014; Yang et al. 2014; Zhu et al. 2015). Some scholars have studied the mechanics and damage characteristics of sandy mudstone, metamorphic quartz sandstone and silty sandstone under triaxial compression and triaxial unloading confining pressure (Fang et al. 2015; Deng et al. 2016; Guo et al. 2016). The mechanical properties and acoustic <b>emission</b> <b>characteristics</b> of sandstone under impact loading were studied by (Li 2014; Zhang et al. 2014; Li et al. 2015 a, b; Liu et al. 2015). Besides, they explored the effect of strain rate on the mechanical properties and acoustic <b>emission</b> <b>characteristics</b> of sandstone under impact loading. Water also has an important effect on the physical properties, mechanical properties, and acoustic <b>emission</b> <b>characteristics</b> of rock. The effects of water on the physical and mechanical properties and acoustic <b>emission</b> <b>characteristics</b> of silty sandstone, coal and sandstone were analyzed by other researchers (Chen et al. 2013; Deng et al. 2014; Gao et al. 2015 a, b; Zhang et al. 2015, 2016), and the results indicate that water can significantly alter the wave velocity, compressive strength, elastic modulus, failure pattern and acoustic <b>emission</b> <b>characteristics</b> of coal and rock. The effect of pore pressure and confining pressure on short-term and creep mechanical behavior of saturated and dry red sandstone were studied by Yang et al. (2015). The effect of strain rate on the mechanical behavior of sandstone with different grain sizes was studied by Wasantha et al. (2015).

30|$|Rock {{acoustic}} emission has {{the advantage}} of nondestructive testing. It is often used to study the evolution of rocks. The cause of rock internal damage can be monitored continuously and in real time by sensing rock acoustic wave. Based on the rock sound source group intelligence localization algorithm, we propose an embedded acoustic <b>emission</b> <b>characteristic</b> analysis mechanism. The localization algorithm establishes a linear relationship between the acoustic emission and the propagation process of the rock. This algorithm can accurately restore the internal deformation and failure process of the rock. By combining the acoustic source and rock sound, we design a method of acoustic <b>emission</b> <b>characteristic</b> analysis based on 3 D space. The test results show that the positioning error of the proposed algorithm is less than 0.005  m, which is obviously better than the least square method. The calculation of rock strength and splitting rate is consistent with the actual measurement by using the embedded acoustic <b>emission</b> <b>characteristic</b> analysis mechanism.|$|E

40|$|Field <b>emission</b> <b>characteristics</b> of sol-gel (Ba 0. 67 Sr 0. 33) TiO 3 (BST) {{ferroelectric}} {{thin film}} coated silicon emitters have been systemically investigated. The effects of BST coating, BST annealing temperature, and biasing at BST-silicon junction on field <b>emission</b> <b>characteristics</b> of BST coated silicon tips have been studied. The authors {{have found that}} field <b>emission</b> <b>characteristics</b> of silicon tips can be significantly improved by BST coating. The turn-on electric field required between the silicon tips and the anode significantly reduced from 70 to 4 – 20 V/µm by BST coating. The theoretical {{studies have shown that}} the improved <b>emission</b> <b>characteristics</b> by BST coating may be attributed to the lower electron affinity and the lower work function properties of BST material. Emission stability was also improved by BST coating. BST coated silicon emitter has a relatively stable emission current with 20 % fluctuation compared to 50 % current fluctuation of uncoated silicon tips. It was also found that the <b>emission</b> <b>characteristics</b> of BST coated silicon tips strongly depended on BST annealing temperature. The samples with 750 °C BST annealing temperature were found to have the best <b>emission</b> <b>characteristics</b> with low turn-on electric field of 4 – 9 V/µm. A higher annealing temperature results in higher activation of ionic conduction, increasing carrier concentration, raising the Fermi level toward the conduction band, and thus reducing the effective work function.
