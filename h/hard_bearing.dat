40|$|BACKGROUND: Few large {{series of}} <b>hard</b> <b>bearing</b> {{surfaces}} have reported on reasons for early failure. A number of unique mechanisms of failure, including fracture, squeaking, and adverse tissue reactions, {{have been reported}} with these <b>hard</b> <b>bearing</b> surfaces. However, the incidence varies among the published studies. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: To confirm the incidences, we identified the etiologies of early failures of hard-on-hard bearing surfaces for ceramic-on-ceramic and metal-on-metal THAs. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed records of 2907 THAs with hard-on-hard bearing surfaces implanted between 1996 and 2009; 1697 (58 %) had ceramic-on-ceramic and 1210 (42 %) had metal-on-metal bearing surfaces. We recorded bearing-related complications and compared them to nonspecific reasons for revision THA. The minimum followup of the ceramic-on-ceramic and metal-on-metal cohorts was 6 months (mean, 48 months; range, 6 - 97 months) and 24 months (mean, 60 months; range, 24 - 178 months), respectively. RESULTS: The overall revision rate for ceramic-on-ceramic THA was 2. 2 % (38 of 1697), with aseptic loosening accounting for 55 % of revisions (femur or acetabulum). The bearing accounted for 13 % of the revisions in the ceramic-on-ceramic THA cohort. The overall metal-on-metal revision rate was 5. 4 % (65 of 1210), 17 involving adverse tissue reactions related to the metal-on-metal bearing surface (17 of 1210, 1. 4 % of cases; 17 of 65, 26 % of revisions). CONCLUSIONS: Twenty-six percent of the revisions from metal-on-metal and 13 % of ceramic-on ceramic were bearing related. The overall short- to medium-term revision rate was 2. 2 % and 5. 4 % for ceramic-on-ceramic and metal-on-metal, respectively. The most common etiology of failure was loosening of the femoral or acetabular components. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic study.

40|$|Abstract — Hard turning is {{characterized}} by development of high temperatures at the cutting zone, which impairs the surface quality of the final product. Thus, an effective control of heat generated at the cutting zone is essential to ensure workpiece surface quality. Cutting fluids are generally used to avoid this. However, cutting fluids are being restricted due to their direct influence to human health and environment. New alternative approaches are in process to alleviate {{the problems associated with}} dry and wet hard turning. This study deals with an investigation of molybdenum disulphide as a solid lubricant {{as an alternative to the}} cutting fluids to reduce friction and thereby improve the surface finish of bearing steels. Experiments have been conducted using central composite rotatable design, to study the effect of molybdenum disulphide lubricant on surface roughness while <b>hard</b> turning <b>bearing</b> steel.

40|$|It is well {{documented}} that <b>hard</b> <b>bearing</b> combinations show a running-in phenomenon in vitro {{and there is also}} some evidence of this from retrieval studies. In order to investigate this phenomenon, five Birmingham hip resurfacing devices were tested in a hip wear simulator.

The wear showed the classical running in with the wear rate falling from 1. 84 mm 3 per 10 6 cycles for the first 10 6 cycles of testing to 0. 24 mm 3 per 10 6 cycles over the final 2 x 10 6 cycles of testing. The friction tests suggested boundary lubrication initially, but at 1 x 10 6 cycles a mixed lubrication regime was evident. By 2 x 10 6 cycles the classical Stribeck curve had formed, indicating a considerable contribution from the fluid film at higher viscosities.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Soft bearing {{materials}} that aim {{to reproduce the}} tribological function of the natural joint are gaining popularity as an alternative concept to conventional <b>hard</b> <b>bearing</b> materials in the hip and knee. However, {{it has not been}} proven so far that an elastic cushion bearing can be sufficiently durable as a long term (20 years) articulating joint prosthesis. The use of new {{bearing materials}} should be supported by accurate descriptions of the implant following usage and of the number, volume, and type of wear particles generated. We report on a long-term 20 million cycle (Mc) wear study of a commercial hip replacement system composed of a compliant polycarbonate-urethane (PCU) acetabular liner coupled to a cobalt–chromium alloy femoral head. The PCU liner showed excellent wear characteristics in terms of its low and steady volumetric wear rate (5. 8 – 7. 7 mm 3 /Mc) and low particle generation rate (2 – 3 10 6 particles/Mc). The latter is 5 – 6 orders of magnitude lower than that of highly cross-linked polyethylene and 6 – 8 orders of magnitude lower than that of metal-on-metal bearings. Microscopic analysis of the implants after the simulation demonstrated a low damage level to the implants ’ articulating surfaces. Thus, the compliant PCU bearing may provide a substantial advantage over traditional bearin...|$|E

Slightly tapered lateral roots in plate root systems were relatively stronger further away from the stem than the highly tapered laterals in heart and tap root systems. Wood strength in Norway spruce (plate system) was found to increase along the lateral roots before decreasing again. The increase in strength may coincide with the point of maximum bending of the root as the tree sways backwards and forwards in the wind. Strength was also found to increase on the underside of lateral roots in the plate systems of poplar. The undersides of these roots will experience high compressive stresses due to the weight of the tree pushing the root on to the <b>hard</b> <b>bearing</b> surface of the soil. External loading forces in plate root systems will be transmitted into the soil further away from the stem due to the lack of branches, therefore a high strength along the root will help resist mechanical stress.

With a view to further extending this period of joint activity metal-on-metal hip resurfacings have been development which allow for implantation into younger and more active patients. However, these bearings have recently been the subject of a MHRA device alert due to unexplained hip pain and reported soft tissue reactions and indeed are under investigation having been shown to exhibit high failure rates. This has highlighted the need for a traceable metrological approach to the quantification and characterisation of in vivo wear as currently there is no standard dedicated to the measurement of such wear. This study is the first to develop a comprehensive method for measuring the wear geometry of retrieved bearings whilst also assessing and quantifying both the magnitude and effect of the three-dimensional measurement uncertainty on the measurement process as a whole. This study shows that the magnitude of the expanded measurement uncertainty is an important, and until now overlooked, factor and that a statement of uncertainty is vital in measuring retrieved components as a means of comparison between studies and as a measure of confidence in measurement data. Based on the results of this study, it is recommended that care be taken when performing wear measurements on retrieved bearings.

Ball-in-socket MOM contacts were analysed using the Abaqus Finite Element package to simulate dry contact between the acetabular cup and the femoral head. Different cup thicknesses of 4, 6, 8, and 10 mm were considered using a polyurethane foam block support system. Elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) analyses were developed for the contacts using three different approaches to specify the contact. These were (i) A simple model based on the radii of relative curvature, (ii) An equivalent contact model developed so that its dry contact area and maximum pressure replicated the values obtained from the FE analysis, and (iii) A modified version of (ii) that also ensured equivalence of the gap shape outside the contact area. Published in vivo information for the hip joint contact forces over the walking cycle was used to specify the operating conditions for the EHL analysis. III This was achieved by developing techniques to transform the in vivo information to provide load direction and kinematic information relative to the nominal contact point between the components. The analysis method was found to be effective for all points of the walking cycle for cases where the cup thickness exceeded 5 mm and modelling approach (ii) was identified as satisfactory.

This driving force increases with increasing sphere charge, but can be counteracted by increasing counterion concentration.

This retrospective cohort study records survival time to revision following primary cementless THR {{with the most}} common combination (accounting for {{almost a third of}} all cementless THRs), and explores risk factors independently associated with failure, using data from the National Joint Registry for England and Wales. Patients with osteoarthritis who had a DePuy Corail/Pinnacle THR implanted between the establishment of the registry in 2003 and 31 December 2010 were included within analyses. There were 35 386 procedures. Cox proportional hazard models were used to analyse {{the extent to which the}} risk of revision was related to patient, surgeon and implant covariates. The overall rate of revision at five years was 2. 4 % (99 % confidence interval 2. 02 to 2. 79). In the final adjusted model, we found that the risk of revision was significantly higher in patients receiving metal-on-metal (MoM: hazard ratio (HR) 1. 93, p < 0. 001) and ceramic-on-ceramic bearings (CoC: HR 1. 55, p = 0. 003) compared with the best performing bearing (metal-on-polyethylene). The risk of revision was also greater for smaller femoral stems (sizes 8 to 10 : HR 1. 82, p < 0. 001) compared with mid-range sizes. In a secondary analysis of only patients where body mass index (BMI) data were available (n = 17 166), BMI ≥ 30 kg/m(2) significantly increased the risk of revision (HR 1. 55, p = 0. 002). The influence of the bearing on the risk of revision remained significant (MoM: HR 2. 19, p < 0. 001; CoC: HR 2. 09, p = 0. 001).
