5|$|After a lacuna in the {{manuscript}} of the poem, Hymiskviða abruptly picks up again with Thor and Hymir in a boat, out at sea. Hymir catches a few whales at once, and Thor baits <b>his</b> <b>line</b> {{with the head of}} the ox. Thor casts <b>his</b> <b>line</b> and the monstrous serpent Jörmungandr bites. Thor pulls the serpent on board, and violently slams him in the head with his hammer. Jörmungandr shrieks, and a noisy commotion is heard from underwater before another lacuna appears in {{the manuscript}}.|$|E

His inheritance included three Morayshire estates: Altyre near Forres, Gordonstoun near Elgin and Dallas. Though the estates totalled , they yielded poor revenues; the annual income from the estates in around 1890 {{has been described as}} either £60,000 or £80,000.|$|E
5|$|Faramir took up {{his office}} as Steward, and began {{preparing}} {{the city for the}} arrival of Aragorn, who was now King of Gondor.

5|$|French and British patrol frigates each {{spotted the}} other's fleet around 9:30 am; both at first underestimated {{the size of}} the other fleet, leading each {{commander}} to believe the other fleet was the smaller fleet of Admiral de Barras. When the true size of the fleets became apparent, Graves assumed that de Grasse and Barras had already joined forces, and prepared for battle; he directed <b>his</b> <b>line</b> toward the bay's mouth, assisted by winds from the north-northeast.|$|E

5|$|However, the U.S. did {{not have}} enough troops; Cutler, whose brigade was {{deployed}} north of the Chambersburg Pike, had his right flank in the air.

5|$|On Cemetery Ridge, Generals Meade and Hancock were {{scrambling}} to find reinforcements. Meade had sent {{virtually all of}} his available troops (including most of the XII Corps, who would be needed momentarily on Culp's Hill) to his left flank to counter Longstreet's assault, leaving the center of <b>his</b> <b>line</b> relatively weak. There was insufficient infantry on Cemetery Ridge {{and only a few}} artillery pieces, rallied from the debacle of the Peach Orchard by Lt. Col. Freeman McGilvery.|$|E
5|$|The battle he is {{best known}} for was the defense of Lunga Ridge on Guadalcanal September 13–14, 1942. His Raider Battalion, with two {{companies}} of the 1st Parachute Battalion attached, were sent to a ridge line a short distance south of Henderson Field. Here, they were supposed to get a short rest but Japanese forces unexpectedly attacked the position on the first evening, penetrating the left center of <b>his</b> <b>line</b> of resistance, forcing a withdrawal to a reserve position.|$|E
5|$|According to the 9th century History of the Britons, a man {{listed as}} Guillem Guercha {{was the first}} of <b>his</b> <b>line</b> to rule as king of the East Angles. The History of the Britons lists Guillem Guercha's {{descendants}} and ancestors: 'Woden begat Casser, who begat Titinon, who begat Trigil, who begat Rodmunt, who begat Rippa, who begat Guillem Guercha, who was the first king of the East Angles'. According to the 19th-century historian Sir Francis Palgrave, Guercha was a distortion of Wuffa. D. P.

5|$|At 09:24 on {{the morning}} of 1 June, Howe sent his ships into action using the {{original}} tactic of turning each ship in <b>his</b> <b>line</b> northwest simultaneously, so that they would bear down individually on Villaret's fleet and each break the enemy line separately. His intention was to cut the French line in 25 places, raking the enemy vessels at both bow and stern and dividing their fire so they could be defeated piecemeal. Ultimately though this ambitious plan failed, due to ill-discipline among Howe's subordinates and the damage his fleet had sustained over the previous week. While six of Howe's ships did break the French line as ordered, and several others came close, many of his captains failed to follow orders and instead engaged the enemy from a distance in desultory gun duels which had little effect.|$|E
5|$|At 11:00, Napoleon drafted {{his general}} order: Reille's Corps {{on the left}} and d'Erlon's Corps to the right were to attack the village of Mont-Saint-Jean and keep abreast of one another. This order assumed Wellington's battle-line was in the village, rather than at the more forward {{position}} on the ridge. To enable this, Jerome's division would make an initial attack on Hougoumont, which Napoleon expected would draw in Wellington's reserves, since its loss would threaten his communications with the sea. A grande batterie of the reserve artillery of I, II, and VI Corps was to then bombard the centre of Wellington's position from about 13:00. D'Erlon's corps would then attack Wellington's left, break through, and roll up <b>his</b> <b>line</b> from east to west. In his memoirs, Napoleon wrote that his intention was to separate Wellington's army from the Prussians and drive it back towards the sea.|$|E

5|$|Bart and his catchphrase {{continue}} to be popular, while Krusty creates {{a wide array of}} merchandise featuring Bart's likeness. Bart becomes sick of his fame and begins to fear that the fad will wear off, so he tries to expand his act and personality during an interview on Conan O'Brien's late-night talk show, to no avail. Bart decides to stop performing, but Marge convinces him that he should continue because he makes people happy. Bart arrives at Krusty's show and enthusiastically delivers <b>his</b> <b>line,</b> but the audience is bored with the line and does not react. With fans no longer interested in Bart, Krusty ditches him.|$|E
5|$|By 1:00 pm, the two fleets were roughly {{facing each}} other, but sailing on {{opposite}} tacks. In order to engage, {{and to avoid}} some shoals (known as the Middle Ground) {{near the mouth of}} the bay, Graves around 2:00 pm ordered his whole fleet to wear, a manoeuvre that reversed <b>his</b> <b>line</b> of battle, but enabled it to line up with the French fleet as its ships exited the bay. This placed the squadron of Hood, his most aggressive commander, {{at the rear of the}} line, and that of Admiral Francis Samuel Drake in the van.|$|E
