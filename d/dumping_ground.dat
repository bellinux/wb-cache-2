5|$|The {{town has}} an {{underground}} sewage system, covering about 40% {{of the town}} area, that collects domestic waste and conveys it to septic tanks for disposal. Solid waste is disposed of in a nearby <b>dumping</b> <b>ground,</b> which also houses the town's crematorium. Doorstep collection of garbage and segregation of biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste have been implemented since 2003. Vermicomposting of vegetable waste is carried out {{with the help of}} non-governmental organisations. In June 2009, in order to reduce waste, the municipality proposed a ban on plastic carrier bags and sachets in the town.|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} of the sediments and ecology of the <b>dump</b> <b>ground</b> was conducted in March 1995. The {{primary purpose of the}} investigation was to analyse factors which may be affecting the benthic biota on the <b>dump</b> <b>ground.</b> These include heavy metal content of the sediments, grain size characteristics of the sediments, and population distribution of the benthic biota on and surrounding the <b>dump</b> <b>ground.</b> It was intended that information obtained could be utilised in future investigations on the ecology of the <b>dump</b> <b>ground,</b> noting changes that have occurred over time. Heavy metal analysis of Cadmium, Chromium, Copper, Mercury, Lead, and Zinc from the <b>dump</b> <b>ground,</b> turning basin, and inner harbour area indicate that concentrations of all heavy metals were all very low and well within resource consent limits. Sediment and ecological samples from 25 sites on and surrounding the <b>dump</b> <b>ground</b> were taken. Two other sites were also surveyed, one from the turning basin, another from the inner harbour area (dredged material). Examination of the sediments has shown that although the dredged material consists solely of mud sized particles the sediments of the <b>dump</b> <b>ground</b> are mainly sand sized sediments. This suggests that during the dumping process dispersion of mud occurs. Mud is transported off the <b>dump</b> <b>ground</b> in a southeasterly direction. Ecological evaluation indicates benthic species diversity and abundance of macrofauna is high, with no species in particular dominating the species assemblage. Comparison between this study and a 1993 survey shows increased diversity over the <b>dump</b> <b>ground.</b> Increased population abundance was evident and larger sized bivalves are indicative of an ageing population. Field experiments examining the kelp beds indicate a decline in the population of Ecklonia radiata from 1993 to 1996. It is thought that this decline may be due to suspended sediment load from the Turanganui River, as the kelp beds are situated in the direction of discharge from the River...|$|R

40|$|In {{the article}} there is {{presented}} temporary situation of coal mining <b>dumping</b> <b>grounds</b> in Poland – their inventarization, localization and environmental impacts. The coal mining <b>dumping</b> <b>grounds</b> in Poland are situated in three coal basins: Upper Silesian Coal Basin, Lower Silesian Coal Basin and Lublin Coal Basin. In all mentioned areas occur ca. 270 coal mining waste dumps, covering surface of over 4400 ha. The main environmental impacts connected with <b>dumping</b> <b>grounds</b> are fire hazards, water pollution and {{a danger of}} slope sliding. The question of recovery of coal from disposed wastes with regard to legal regulations is discussed. There are presented technical methods of coal recovery considering environmental protection issues. There is a necessity and technical possibility of recovery of coal from the coal-mining waste dumps. The coal recovery reduces hazards of self-ignition and fires of the dump. It is also economically justified. The analysis of required regulations in legal system in Poland for safe exploitation of secondary materials from coal mining dumps is done. Socio-economic aspects of recovery of coal are discussed. The valid legal regulations in Poland regulate the issues connected with coal mining <b>dumping</b> <b>grounds</b> in a very general way. It is necessary to prepare supplements to the legal provisions or new regulations concerning post-mining <b>dumping</b> <b>grounds...</b>|$|R
