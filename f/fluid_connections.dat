The LK's docking port was a latticework of 96 hexagon-shaped holes arranged in an isometric grid, each as a potential docking port for the snare-shaped probe of the LOK to fit in without precise alignment of the two craft.

Although not fully developed as a metaphor in her work, Rose sees the relationship as potentially risky for the researcher and for the research subjects and thereby draws a fairly pessimistic conclusion about the outcomes of the research relationship.

40|$|Abstract The kinesin-microtubule {{system has}} emerged as a {{versatile}} model system for biologically-derived microscale transport. While kinesin motors in cells transport cargo along static microtubule tracks, for in vitro transport applications it is preferable to invert the system and transport cargo-functionalized microtubules along immobilized kinesin mo-tors. However, for efficient cargo transport and to enable this novel transport system to be interfaced with traditional mi-crofluidics, it is important to fabricate enclosed microchan-nels that are compatible with kinesin motors and micro-tubules, that enable fluorescence imaging of microtubule movement, and that provide fluidic connections for sam-ple introduction. Here we construct a three-tier hierarchical system of microfluidic channels that links microscale trans-port channels to macroscopic <b>fluid</b> <b>connections.</b> Shallow mi-crochannels (5 µm wide and 1 µm deep) are etched in a glass substrate and bonded to a cover glass using PMMA as an ad-hesive, while intermediate channels (∼ 100 µm wide) serve as reservoirs and connect to 250 µm deep microchannels that hold fine gauge tubing for fluid injection.
