This action was taken following the recent bomb attack and targeted killings of political activists in the city, against foreign militants operating in Pakistan.|$|E

25|$|Cruelty to animals, {{also called}} animal abuse, animal neglect or simply animal cruelty, is the infliction by {{omission}} (animal neglect) or by commission by humans of suffering or harm upon any non-human animal, {{regardless of whether}} the act <b>is</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>law.</b> More narrowly, it can be the causing of harm or suffering for specific achievement, such as killing animals for food or for their fur; opinions differ about the extent of cruelty associated with a given method of slaughter. Cruelty to animals sometimes encompasses inflicting harm or suffering as an end in itself, defined as zoosadism.|$|E
25|$|The {{location}} must be well-suited to {{the purpose}} of beaching whales. It <b>is</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> to kill pilot whales at locations with inappropriate conditions. The seabed must gradually slope from the shore out to deep water. Given such conditions, the chances are good that the whales can be driven fully ashore or close enough to the shore that they can be killed from land. When a school of pilot whales is sighted, boats gather behind them and slowly drive them towards the chosen authorized location, usually a bay or the end of a fjord. There are 23 towns, villages or bays (Viðvík is not populated) that have the right conditions, and therefore legal authorization, for beaching whales. These are in alphabetical order: Bøur, Fámjin, Fuglafjørður, Húsavík, Hvalba (and Nes-Hvalba), Hvalvík, Hvannasund, Klaksvík, Leynar, Miðvágur, Norðragøta, Norðskáli, Sandur, Syðrugøta, Tjørnuvík, Tórshavn (in Sandagerð), Tvøroyri, Vágur, Vestmanna, Viðvík (near Hvannasund, but on the east coast of Viðoy) and Øravík.|$|E
2500|$|According to Antonia Parvanova, {{one of the}} {{difficulties}} of dealing legally {{with the issue of}} DV is that men in many male dominated societies do not understand that inflicting violence against their wives <b>is</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>law.</b> She said, referring to a case that occurred in Bulgaria, [...] "A husband was tried for severely beating his wife and when the judge asked him if he understood what he did and if he's sorry, the husband said [...] "But she's my wife".

On February 7, 2014 President Obama signed the Farm Bill which contained the U.S. H.R. 366/S. 666—Animal Fighting Spectator Prohibition Act. [...] "The final bill includes a provision making it a federal crime to attend or bring a child {{under the age of}} 16 to an animal fighting event" [...] "The Animal Fighting Spectator Prohibition Act would make it a federal offense to knowingly attend an organized animal fight and would impose additional penalties for bringing children to animal fights.

2500|$|The HBO show Big Love stars Bill Paxton as Bill Henrickson, {{a modern-day}} polygamist {{who lives in}} {{suburban}} Salt Lake City with his three wives and seven children. Commentators such as Jesella and Ryan point out that polygamy was banned by the LDS Church [...] "more than 100 years ago" [...] and <b>is</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> in Utah, the state where the show is set, and that the family is not explicitly Mormon.

2500|$|The Varela Project {{movement}} enjoyed broad based {{support among}} expatriate Cuban-Americans and the United States Government.

In March 2003, the Cuban government arrested approximately 75 dissenters, who were tried and convicted of accepting funds from foreign sources for political purposes, and approximately one half of these arrested persons {{were associated with the}} Varela Project movement. [...] This was met with widespread criticism internationally, and was perceived as a crackdown. Although the project was officially legally rejected on November 2002, the same Varela Project was brought again to the National Assembly on October 2004.

[...] For these comments, Duterte was attacked in an editorial in The Manila Times, which condemned [...] "the mentality of lawlessness and vigilantism." [...] The newspaper argued that this culture of impunity enabled those in power, including officials, [...] "private warlords and businessmen vigilantes" [...] to take retribution against those they felt had acted against their interests: [...] "They kill journalists exposing corruption and human rights activists exposing abusive police and military men." [...] Following Duterte's comments in relation to killing a person suspected of smuggling rice, the office of the President of the Philippines issued a statement saying, [...] "Killing a person <b>is</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>law.</b> The President has been firm in the belief that no one is above the law.

2500|$|Badakhshan {{province}} borders Tajikistan and is {{inhabited by}} mostly Tajik people. It {{is one of}} the few provinces in Afghanistan which was not controlled by the Taliban when it was in power. After coming under increasing pressure by NATO forces in southern Afghanistan the Taliban have become active in areas like Badakhshan Province which were previously calm. In addition they have started using women and children as suicide bombers and targeted tribal elders, things they formerly considered taboo. Foreign aid workers have been attacked in the past but these attacks have been relatively infrequent and Taliban has allowed some aid workers in the areas they controlled. Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission stated that civilian deaths were up five percent in 2010 and Taliban was responsible for 68% of the 1325 deaths till 8 August 2010 and NATO was responsible for 28%. IAM is a Christian organization that has worked in Afghanistan since 1966. [...] They have denied proselytizing, as for non-Muslims it <b>is</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. According to critics propagandists of the Taliban insurgency portray their drive for power as a defense of Islam. The victims of the massacre had indeed been sponsored by a Christian charity, but that organization worked in Afghanistan since 1966, under a monarchy, a communist regime, warlords, and under the Taliban; its aid workers were said to understand the Afghan customs and sensibilities and have scrupulously obeyed prohibitions against proselytizing. None of the Christian non-profit's workers had ever been killed while on duty with the organisation.|$|E
