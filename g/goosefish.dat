40|$|Abstract. —The Beverton–Holt length-based {{mortality}} estimator {{has received}} widespread use {{primarily due to}} its applicability in data-limited situations. The mean length of animals that are fully vulnerable to the sampling gear {{can be used to}} estimate total mortality from basic growth parameters and a known length at first capture. This method requires equilibrium conditions because the mean length of a population will change only gradually after a change in mortality. In this study, we derive the transitional behavior of the mean length statistic for use in nonequilibrium conditions. We investigate conditions affecting the reliability of the Beverton–Holt results and then develop a new procedure that allows a series of mortality rates to be estimated from mean length data representing nonequilibrium conditions in multiple years. We then examine an assessment of <b>goosefish</b> Lophius americanus that was criticized for its use of the Beverton–Holt estimator under nonequilibrium conditions. Using data from the 1963 – 2002 National Marine Fisheries Service annual fall groundfish surveys off the northeastern United States and assuming a single change in total mortality, we used the maximum likelihood method to estimate that the total mortality of <b>goosefish</b> in the southern assessment region increased from 0. 31 to 0. 60 per year in 1977. Estimates of the new mortality rate made three or more years after the change were relatively stable and only ranged from 0. 55 to 0. 71 per year, while estimates from the standard Beverton–Holt approach ranged from 0. 37 to 1. 1 per year.

40|$|Georges Bank has {{exhibited}} marked changes in ecosystem structure {{over the last}} half century. The community once dominated by groundfish and other finfish is now primarily composed of pelagic and elasmobranch species. Community dynamics are profoundly influenced by species interactions such as predation. The focus of this dissertation is to estimate the trophic interactions among fish species on Georges Bank. These species interactions are estimated by developing a multispecies, statistical catch-at-age model of the Georges Bank fish community that explicitly quantifies the mortality due to predation. ^ Manuscript I: A submodel was developed for three important fish species on Georges Bank: Atlantic cod, silver hake, and Atlantic herring. The model was fit to time series of commercial catch, fishery-independent survey catch, and predator diet composition data from 1978 – 2007. Estimated predation rates were high, compared with fishing mortality, and variable with time. Monte Carlo simulations were {{used to evaluate the}} ability of the model to statistically estimate parameters with known error introduced into each of the three input datasets. The model parameters and derived indices could be estimated with confidence from input data with error levels similar to those obtained from the model fit to the observed data. This manuscript helps to elevate multispecies statistical catch-at-age models to the level of statistical rigor expected of fishery dynamics models. ^ Manuscript II: The submodel developed in the first chapter was expanded by applying the model to nine fish species within the Georges Bank community. While sensitivity to dataset weights and initial parameter estimates was apparent, both the magnitude and temporal trends in the predation mortality rates experienced by prey species were statistically estimated. Predation mortality rates again varied both temporally and ontogenetically. Mackerel, herring and silver hake experienced the greatest mortalities due to predation, with maximum predation mortality rates of 0. 62 for mackerel, 1. 01 for herring and 1. 58 for silver hake. For these species, losses due to predation generally exceeded annual landings. <b>Goosefish</b> was the most dominant predator, followed by cod and silver hake, and consumption of modeled fish was related to prey abundance. These results demonstrate the strong impact of predation on Georges Bank fish community dynamics. ^ Manuscript III: The multispecies statistical catch-at-age model developed in the first two manuscripts was used to develop stochastic forward projections. These projections were used to explore the consequences of different fishing scenarios while accounting for predation. Stochastic projections indicated strong interactions between modeled species, though the interactions were not always direct. Examples of indirect interactions included the effect of <b>goosefish</b> on herring and similarly, the impact of <b>goosefish</b> on white hake. Consequently, population responses to fishing were a function of not only the rates of fishing, but also of these direct and indirect interactions among species. ^ Collectively, this dissertation demonstrates the strong impact of predation on Georges Bank fish community dynamics and provides a tool for statistically estimating the mortality due to predation. Through the development of a multispecies statistical catch-at-age model, we have expanded the multispecies modeling approaches implemented for Georges Bank and the Northeast U. S. Continental Shelf. ...|$|E

As a consequence the suggestion was made that the prosthetic groups in the hemoglobin molecule were differentially affected by the presence of acid, some being inactivated entirely so that they no longer combined with oxygen.
