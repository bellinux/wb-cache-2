Apart from strict <b>hard</b> <b>security</b> means like cryptography and security protocols, soft security methods, like trust relationships, have to be implemented in comprehensive solution.

30|$|In mobile ad hoc network (MANET), {{malicious}} {{attacks on}} different layers {{have been identified}} and analysed by researchers over several years. Several routing protocols were introduced {{in order to secure}} routing and forwarding packets in MANET from malicious attackers. Most of these conventional routing protocols rely on a centralized public key infrastructure (PKI) to detect and secure malicious misbehaviours using <b>hard</b> <b>security</b> or cryptographic mechanisms. However, these solutions provide only a partial security in the initial stages of managing mobile nodes, where malicious nodes can affect the credibility of the network. In certain cases, nodes may be vulnerable to the behaviour changes with the influence of attacker participants, even if they behave as legitimate nodes initially in a secure group communication and therefore pass the <b>hard</b> <b>security</b> checks. However, these unauthorized nodes may become selfish or malicious nodes and report false information with the intention to damage the reliability of group communication. The traditional cryptographic mechanisms cannot detect and prevent these continual changes in the node behaviour. In other words, the reliability of communication, the quality of data and access control cannot be achieved fully with the <b>hard</b> <b>security</b> techniques. Therefore, a security mechanism is required to defend against the node behaviour changes commonly referred as soft security threats and assure integrity, reliability and access control to the group communication in MANET. Consequently, an effective distributed and self-organising mechanism quantified with trust to identify and secure the misbehaviour in ad hoc network should be established.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Distribution denial-of-service (DDoS) {{constitutes}} one of {{the major}} threats and among the <b>hardest</b> <b>security</b> problems in today’s Internet. However, DDoS detection techniques, such as signature-based detection, anomaly-based detection, and wavelet-based signal analysis, face the considerable challenge of determining network-based flooding attacks from sudden increases in legitimate activity or flash events. In this paper, we study the basic characteristic of network traffic, and propose a method for meeting the challenge. By taking full advantage of known traffic in normal state, we design a detection algorithm for dealing with DDoS attacks. We have carried out experiments with actual data to evaluate the algorithm. The results show that it can recognize DDoS attacks...|$|R

In this paper we propose a hybrid detection system, referred to as hybrid intrusion detection system (H-IDS), for detection of DDoS attacks. Our proposed detection system makes use of both anomaly-based and signature-based detection methods separately but in an integrated fashion and combines the outcomes of both detectors to enhance the overall detection accuracy. We apply two distinct datasets to our proposed system in order to test the detection performance of H-IDS and conclude that the proposed hybrid system gives better results than the systems based on nonhybrid detection...|$|R

Thereby, two common ways can be distinguished, namely policy-based and reputation-based trust establishment [7].

40|$|Denial-of-service {{attacks are}} among the <b>hardest</b> <b>security</b> problem on today's Internet. One {{difficulty}} to thwart these denial-of-service attacks is to trace {{the source of the}} attacks because they often use incorrect, or "spoofed" IP addresses to disguise the true origin. In this paper, we present two new schemes, the Advanced Marking Scheme and the Authenticated Marking Scheme, which allow the victim to traceback the approximate origin of spoofed IP packets. Our techniques have very low network and router overhead and support incremental deployment. Comparing with previous work, our techniques have significantly higher precision (lower false positive rate) and lower computation overhead for the victim to reconstruct the attack paths under large scale distributed denial-of-service attacks. Furthermore the Authenticated Marking Scheme provides efficient authentication of routers' markings such that even a compromised router cannot forge or tamper markings from other uncompromised routers.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} analyses {{the phenomenon}} of regionalism around the Baltic and the Black Sea {{since the end of}} the Cold War with a comparative approach and by applying an extended neorealist theory that includes geopolitics and historical legacy. The main focus is regional organizations, the Council of the Baltic Sea States (CBSS) and the Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC), which defines the geographical and political borders of the Baltic and the Black Sea region. These regional organizations are treated as international regimes. The three main varibales taken into consideration in this study are the distribution of power among the big states, the geographical location and the historical legacy that directly and indirectly affect the relations among the states in each region. These variables are consistently applied to the following  four sector analysed in this study: <b>hard</b> <b>security,</b> energy, economic development, and environment. While the last three sectors are areas of cooperation within the CBSS and the BSEC, <b>hard</b> <b>security</b> is not. Its inclusion in this study is because of the fact that it strongly affects the power relations among the states in the two regions and that it is strictly linked to the other three sectors. Although the CBSS and the BSEC have established ad hoc Working Groups with the aim to make cooperation working effectively, regional states cooperate to the extent that it brings relative gains according to the neorealist theory. The analysis shows that the two regimes created around the Balti and the Black Sea are ineffective despite the fact that the CBSS has managed to create stronger cooperative links among its members compared to the BSEC...|$|E

40|$|Distributed Denial {{of service}} is {{a major threat to}} the {{availability}} of internet services. Due to the distributed, large scale nature of the Internet makes DDoS (Distributed Denial-of-Service) attacks stealthy and difficult to counter. Defense against Distributed Denial- of -Service attacks is one of the <b>hardest</b> <b>security</b> problems on the Internet. Recently these network attacks have been increasing. Therefore more effective countermeasures are required to counter the threat. This requirement has motivated us to propose a novel mechanism against DDoS attack. This paper presents the design details of a distributed defense mechanism against DDoS attack. In our approach, the egress routers of the intermediate network coordinate with each other to provide the information necessary to detect and respond to the attack. Thus, a detection system based on single site will have either high positive or high negative rates. Unlike the traditional IDSs (Intrusion Detection System) this method has the potential to achieve high true positive ratio. This work has been done by using consensus algorithms for exchanging the information between the detection systems. So the overall detection time would be reduced for global decision making...|$|R
