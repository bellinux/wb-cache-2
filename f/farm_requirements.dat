As an introduction literature and relevant policy regulations have been reviewed.

Recent agricultural policy measures appear to have been effective in impeding the increase of livestock numbers of the last ten years.

Some of the energy and nutrients from feed is not digested by the salmon, and {{ends up in the}} faeces. In addition, nutrients and energy from uneaten feed also end up in sludge. The total amount of energy and phosphorus in faeces and feed spill is estimated for land based smolt production and for the grow out phase in sea in Norwegian salmon farming. The energy content in faeces and feed spill from land based smolt production is estimated to 242, 880 GJ, and 11, 785, 235 GJ from the grow out phase per year with today’s production volume. The corresponding figures for phosphorus are 225 tons and 9, 096 tons, respectively.

One of the potency is biomass waste. Therefore, this paper discusses about the electricity generation preliminary design of Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) system with corn cob biomass waste burning as heat source, {{so it can be}} obtained the theoretic corn <b>farm</b> area <b>requirement,</b> electricity power, and thermal efficiency at heat source temperature and flow rate variations. Corn cob burning temperature can heat up the heating fluid that is heated by boiler with corn cob as the biomass fuel. Furthermore, that heating fluid is used as ORC electricity generation heat source. The independent variables in this study are the heating fluid temperature which varied between 110, 120, and 130 oC, and the heating fluid flow rate that varied between 100, 150, and 200 liter/minute. R 141 b is selected to be the working fluid, palm oil is used for heating fluid and water as cooling fluid. The calculation results that the theoretic electricity power, thermal efficiency, and corn <b>farm</b> area <b>requirement,</b> respectively, are in the range of 3. 5 - 8. 5 kW, 9. 2 - 10. 3 %, and 49. 5 - 101. 1 hectare/year.

40|$|The {{potential}} {{contribution of}} organic farming {{to the public}} goods, ‘Nature and Biodiversity’, ‘Environment’, ‘Energy and Climate’, ‘Human Health and Welfare’ and ‘Animal Health and Welfare’ in Denmark is guided and partly secured by the principles and specific requirements of the EU Organic Regulation. However, other factors, such as the production type, farm size, geographical location and—not the least—the management of the farm, also influence the contribution. Using the ban on synthetic pesticides and restricted use of antibiotics, including the requirements to compensate for and prevent such uses in organic farming, as examples, {{the positive and negative}} contributions of organic farming in relation to selected public goods were analysed. The contributions of organic farming to Nature and Biodiversity and Human and Animal Health and Welfare are mainly positive compared to conventional farming for all farm types, whilst the effects on Environment and Energy and Climate are mixed; i. e. some effects are positive and others are negative. The analysis revealed a need for further documentation and revision of the organic principles and specific organic requirements— in particular in relation to the public goods Energy and Climate, which at present are not addressed in the EU Organic Regulation.

40|$|Šumadija is rich {{in natural}} {{potentials}} which provide a good basis for the future development of organic farming, {{given the fact that}} natural resources are limited. The composition and structure of natural resources are highly suitable for organic production. The region's relatively unpolluted land, favourable climate, abundant water resources and preserved biodiversity are some of the main organic <b>farming</b> <b>requirements</b> satisfied. Organic production is not possible without ensuring at least a minimum level of preservation of natural resources in areas where organic farming is practised; on the other hand, organic production itself has a positive effect on the preservation and improvement of environmental quality in these areas. Small plots of land can be advantageous for this production, particularly in upland areas, and used specifically for organic production as the conversion period is short. They can be used for vegetable farming because the soil is uncontaminated owing to distance from roads. Positive experience indicates that potatoes, rye, oats and root vegetables can be successfully grown in these areas. Another advantage is the wealth of indigenous cultivars of apples, pears and plums which are highly resistant to pathogenic pests and environmental conditions, and hence suitable for cultivation without the use of mineral fertilisers and chemical agents. Major issues currently facing organic farming are a small-scale organic market and low prices of organic products, a low level of consumer awareness of the advantages of organic farming, suspicion and ignorance, low purchasing power, low availability of organic products through sales channels, etc...|$|R

40|$|Problem statement: The {{agricultural}} {{industry is a}} major user of energy. Energy is used directly for operating {{agricultural machinery and equipment}} on the farm and indirectly in the manufacturing of fertilizers and pesticides and processing of agricultural products off the farm. In order to reduce the cost of agricultural production, energy uses on the farm must be identified and optimized using modern tools. Approach: A comprehensive and easy to use computer program was developed for the purpose of determining the <b>farm</b> energy <b>requirements</b> with the aim of reducing costs and maximizing profit. The program includes a main database composed of nine sub-databases: Tractors sub-database, agricultural machinery sub-database, pumps sub-database, stationary engines sub-database, planting dates sub-database, soil sub-database, operating variables of farm operations sub-database, draft and power equations sub-database and water requirement sub-database. The program was designed with visual C++ language. Results: The program was tested by comparing its results with the manually calculated results. The results showed that the program worked properly. The developed program was also illustrated using an example farm to show the different stages of determining the required farm energy. Conclusion: The program can be used: To determine the <b>farm</b> energy <b>requirements,</b> to assess the current status of farms in terms of energy use efficiency, for future planning of modern farms and as an educational tool. It has many advantages including: Ease of use when dealing with input through interactive windows, ease of addition or deletion or updating of sub-databases, ease of exploring the program windows and the potential for further future development of any part of the program.
