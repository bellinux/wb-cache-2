5|$|After a {{short time}} in jail, they are {{released}} by a social worker named Gabriel, whom Homer mistakes for an angel sent from Heaven. Gabriel moves in with the <b>family</b> <b>to</b> help them be functional again. After observing the family's quirks, Gabriel takes the <b>family</b> <b>to</b> a forest and diagnoses the family's problems accordingly: Marge tries to prove her self-worth to the family by medicating them with food, Bart is addicted to doing crazy stunts for attention, and Homer is simply a drunken buffoon. Gabriel then sets up a challenge to teach the Simpsons the importance of teamwork by setting up a picnic basket in a tree. The object is for the <b>family</b> <b>to</b> work {{together as a team}} to get it down. After a harrowing rescue involving Bart driving the family car and Homer nearly becoming prey for wild predators, the Simpsons succeed and Gabriel congratulates them on working together as a family and becoming functional during their drive home.|$|E

30|$|The {{last four}} columns of Table  5 examine the {{correlations}} between <b>family</b> innovations <b>to</b> media exposure and <b>family</b> innovations <b>to</b> achievement. Here, we see some trends by socioeconomic status and even the occasional reversal of sign. While it is generally true {{that the relationship between}} <b>family</b> innovations <b>to</b> computer use and <b>family</b> innovations <b>to</b> test scores is close zero, there is a more substantial positive relationship in one instance: <b>family</b> innovations <b>to</b> math scores for children with a mother with a graduate degree. For <b>family</b> innovations <b>to</b> TV watching, the correlations with <b>family</b> innovations <b>to</b> achievement are more negative for high-SES families. However, when comparing across ethnic groups, we see that they are positive for <b>family</b> innovations <b>to</b> reading scores for black and Hispanic families. These results suggest that changes to media exposure have different impacts in different <b>families,</b> perhaps due <b>to</b> differences in the content itself but perhaps due to what the media time replaces (Morgan and Gross 1980).|$|R

30|$|The {{correlation}} between <b>family</b> innovations <b>to</b> math and <b>family</b> innovations <b>to</b> reading is 0.73, {{indicating that the}} time-varying family environment has a similar effect on a student’s cognitive development across subjects. I also find positive relationships between <b>family</b> innovations <b>to</b> achievement and <b>family</b> innovations <b>to</b> educational time use. In other words, time-varying family factors that lead to increases in homework time and free reading also lead to increases in test scores. By the same token, family innovations that lead to decreases in educational time use tend to lead to decreases in test scores. The relationship between <b>family</b> innovations <b>to</b> free reading and <b>family</b> innovations <b>to</b> reading scores (ρ= 0.27) is stronger than the relationship between <b>family</b> innovations <b>to</b> free reading and <b>family</b> innovations <b>to</b> math scores (ρ= 0.19). Conversely, <b>family</b> innovations <b>to</b> homework time are more strongly associated with <b>family</b> innovations <b>to</b> math scores (ρ= 0.24) compared to reading scores (ρ= 0.21). These correlations fit {{with the idea that}} a student can boost his reading skills from reading more on his own, but improving math skills comes from more structured practice, which schools facilitate.|$|R
