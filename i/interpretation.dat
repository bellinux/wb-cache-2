This <b>interpretation</b> of the beak has been rejected, as the furrows and ridges are more like those of herbivorous turtle beaks than the flexible structures seen in filter-feeding birds.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSymbolic {{constraints}} arising in proofs of {{termination of}} programs are often translated into numeric constraints before checking them for satisfiability. In this setting, polynomial <b>interpretations</b> are {{a simple and}} popular choice. In the nineties, Lescanne introduced the elementary algebraic <b>interpretations</b> as a suitable alternative to polynomial <b>interpretations</b> in proofs of termination of term rewriting. Here, not only addition and product but also exponential expressions are allowed. Lescanne investigated the use of elementary <b>interpretations</b> for witnessing satisfiability of a given set of symbolic constraints. He also motivated the usefulness of elementary <b>interpretations</b> in proofs of termination by means of several examples. Unfortunately, he did not consider the automatic generation of such <b>interpretations</b> for a given termination problem. This is an important drawback for using these <b>interpretations</b> in practice. In this paper we show how {{to solve this problem}} by using a combination of rewriting, CLP, and CSP techniques for handling the elementary constraints which are obtained when giving the symbols parametric elementary <b>interpretations...</b>|$|R

The importance of a deity, its characteristics, and its associations varied according to the movement of celestial bodies. The priestly <b>interpretation</b> of astronomical records and books was therefore crucial, since the priest would understand which deity required ritual propitiation, when the correct ceremonies should be performed, and what would be an appropriate offering.
