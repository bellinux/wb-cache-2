5|$|Tombaugh's {{task was}} to {{systematically}} capture sections {{of the night sky}} in pairs of images. Each image in a pair was taken two weeks apart. He then placed both images of each section in a machine called a blink comparator, which by exchanging images quickly created a time lapse illusion of the movement of any planetary body. To reduce the chances that a faster-moving (and thus closer) object be mistaken for the new planet, Tombaugh imaged each region near its opposition point, 180 degrees from the Sun, where the apparent retrograde motion for objects beyond Earth's orbit is at its strongest. He also took a third image as a control to eliminate any <b>false</b> <b>results</b> caused by defects in an individual plate. Tombaugh decided to image the entire zodiac, rather than focus on those regions suggested by Lowell.|$|E
25|$|An {{interaction}} may {{not happen}} in yeast, the typical host organism for Y2H. For instance, if a bacterial protein is tested in yeast, it may lack a chaperone for proper folding that is only present in its bacterial host. Moreover, a mammalian protein is sometimes not correctly modified in yeast (e.g., missing phosphorylation), which {{can also lead to}} <b>false</b> <b>results.</b>|$|E
25|$|Each {{of these}} points alone can {{give rise to}} <b>false</b> <b>results.</b> Due to the {{combined}} effects of all error sources yeast two-hybrid have to be interpreted with caution. The probability of generating false positives means that all interactions should be confirmed by a high confidence assay, for example co-immunoprecipitation of the endogenous proteins, which is difficult for large scale protein–protein interaction data. Alternatively, Y2H data can be verified using multiple Y2H variants or bioinformatics techniques. The latter test whether interacting proteins are expressed at the same time, share some common features (such as gene ontology annotations or certain network topologies), have homologous interactions in other species.|$|E

The group also claimed that 6,018 votes for the Felicity Party (SP) had been unrecorded. In Muş, violence broke out after several HDP activists alleged that votes had been stolen in the province, with the police firing on the activists with tear gas.

The police later escorted the individual out of the hostile crowd. The CHP raised concern over the lack of up-to-date voter records, having identified 2,860 non-existent voters on the electoral rall in the İstanbul district of Kadıköy alone.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} <b>false</b> negative <b>results</b> {{arising from}} the use of a commercial kit to detect antibody to HIV- 1 and HIV- 2 between July 1995 and March 1996. DESIGN: The 56 laboratories in the United Kingdom that were using the assay were asked to retrieve and retest specimens with an alternative assay for HIV- 1 and HIV- 2. Details of <b>false</b> negative <b>results</b> were obtained and these serum samples further investigated. SUBJECTS: 24, 181 patients tested with the assay who were reported as being negative for HIV antibody. An additional 497 patients were confirmed as HIV positive with the assay. RESULTS: Serum samples of 20, 973 of the patients were retested, and four patients were found to have had <b>false</b> negative <b>results</b> with the kit; three further patients were found to have had <b>false</b> negative <b>results</b> in the course of other laboratory testing. The seven patients with <b>false</b> negative <b>results</b> with the kit were of diverse risk group and HIV- 1 subtype. Four had evidence of recent HIV infection. CONCLUSION: The commercial kit had a sensitivity of 99. 2 % (497 / 501), or less if the additional three patients with <b>false</b> negative <b>results</b> were taken into account...|$|R

2500|$|Iodine {{number is}} defined as the milligrams of iodine adsorbed by one gram of carbon when the iodine {{concentration}} in the residual filtrate is [...] Basically, iodine number {{is a measure of the}} iodine adsorbed in the pores and, as such, is an indication of the pore volume available in the activated carbon of interest. Typically, water-treatment carbons have iodine numbers ranging from 600 to 1100. Frequently, this parameter is used to determine the degree of exhaustion of a carbon in use. However, this practice should be viewed with caution, as chemical interactions with the adsorbate may affect the iodine uptake, giving <b>false</b> <b>results.</b> Thus, the use of iodine number as a measure of the degree of exhaustion of a carbon bed can only be recommended if it has been shown to be free of chemical interactions with adsorbates and if an experimental correlation between iodine number and the degree of exhaustion has been determined for the particular application.|$|E
60|$|There are nevertheless, in mathematics, some {{examples}} of so-called Induction, in which the conclusion does bear {{the appearance of a}} generalization grounded on some of the particular cases included in it. A mathematician, when he has calculated a sufficient number of the terms of an algebraical or arithmetical series to have ascertained what is called the law of the series, does not hesitate to fill up any number of the succeeding terms without repeating the calculations. But I apprehend he only does so when it is apparent from a priori considerations (which might be exhibited in the form of demonstration) that the mode of formation of the subsequent terms, each from that which preceded it, must be similar to the formation of the terms which have been already calculated. And when the attempt has been hazarded without the sanction of such general considerations, there are instances on record in which it has led to <b>false</b> <b>results.</b>|$|E
60|$|It appears, then, to be a {{condition}} of the most genuinely scientific hypothesis, that it be not destined always to remain an hypothesis, but be of such a nature as to be either proved or disproved by comparison with observed facts. This condition is fulfilled when the effect is already known {{to depend on the}} very cause supposed, and the hypothesis relates only to the precise mode of dependence; the law of the variation of the effect according to the variations in the quantity or in the relations of the cause. With these may be classed the hypotheses which do not make any supposition with regard to causation, but only with regard to the law of correspondence between facts which accompany each other in their variations, though there may be no relation of cause and effect between them. Such were the different false hypotheses which Kepler made respecting the law of the refraction of light. It was known that the direction of the line of refraction varied with every variation {{in the direction of the}} line of incidence, but it was not known how; that is, what changes of the one corresponded to the different changes of the other. In this case any law different from the true one must have led to <b>false</b> <b>results.</b> And, lastly, we must add to these all hypothetical modes of merely representing or describing phenomena; such as the hypothesis of the ancient astronomers that the heavenly bodies moved in circles; the various hypotheses of eccentrics, deferents, and epicycles, which were added to that original hypothesis; the nineteen false hypotheses which Kepler made and abandoned respecting the form of the planetary orbits; and even the doctrine in which he finally rested, that those orbits are ellipses, which was but an hypothesis like the rest until verified by facts.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background High-throughput {{screening}} using RNAi is {{a powerful}} gene discovery method but is often complicated by false positive and <b>false</b> negative <b>results.</b> Whereas <b>false</b> positive <b>results</b> associated with RNAi reagents has {{been a matter of}} extensive study, the issue of false negatives has received less attention. Results We performed a meta-analysis of several genome-wide, cell-based Drosophila RNAi screens, together with a more focused RNAi screen, and conclude that the rate of <b>false</b> negative <b>results</b> is at least 8 %. Further, we demonstrate how knowledge of the cell transcriptome can be used to resolve ambiguous results and how the number of <b>false</b> negative <b>results</b> can be reduced by using multiple, independently-tested RNAi reagents per gene. Conclusions RNAi reagents that target the same gene do not always yield consistent <b>results</b> due to <b>false</b> positives and weak or ineffective reagents. <b>False</b> positive <b>results</b> can be partially minimized by filtering with transcriptome data. RNAi libraries with multiple reagents per gene also reduce false positive and false negative outcomes when inconsistent results are disambiguated carefully. </p...|$|R
