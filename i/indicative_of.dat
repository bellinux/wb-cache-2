40|$|PURPOSE: To {{characterize}} {{the performance of}} students from the 5 th year of primary school, with and without <b>indicatives</b> <b>of</b> reading and writing disorders, in receptive vocabulary and reading comprehension of sentences and texts, and to verify possible correlations between both. METHODS: This study {{was approved by the}} Research Ethics Committee of the institution (no. 098 / 13). Fifty-two students in the 5 th year from primary school, with and without <b>indicatives</b> <b>of</b> reading and writing disorders, and from two public schools participated in this study. After signing the informed consent and having a speech therapy assessment for the application of inclusion criteria, the students were submitted to a specific test for standardized evaluation of receptive vocabulary and reading comprehension. The data were studied using statistical analysis through the Kruskal-Wallis test, analysis of variance techniques, and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient with level of significance to be 0. 05. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (was constructed in which reading comprehension was considered as gold standard. RESULTS: The students without <b>indicatives</b> <b>of</b> reading and writing disorders presented a better performance in all tests. No significant correlation was found between the tests that evaluated reading comprehension in either group. A correlation was found between reading comprehension of texts and receptive vocabulary in the group without indicatives. CONCLUSION: In the absence <b>of</b> <b>indicatives</b> <b>of</b> reading and writing disorders, the presence of a good range of vocabulary highly contributes to a proficient reading comprehension of texts...|$|R

5|$|Along with {{pressure}} tendency, {{the condition of}} the sky {{is one of the more}} important parameters used to forecast weather in mountainous areas. Thickening of cloud cover or the invasion of a higher cloud deck is <b>indicative</b> <b>of</b> rain in the near future. At night, high thin cirrostratus clouds can lead to halos around the moon, which indicates an approach of a warm front and its associated rain. Morning fog portends fair conditions, as rainy conditions are preceded by wind or clouds that prevent fog formation. The approach of a line of thunderstorms could indicate the approach of a cold front. Cloud-free skies are <b>indicative</b> <b>of</b> fair weather for the near future. A bar can indicate a coming tropical cyclone. The use of sky cover in weather prediction has led to various weather lore over the centuries.|$|E
