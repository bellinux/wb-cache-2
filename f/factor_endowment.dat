50|$|A {{classical}} example {{often cited}} {{to emphasize the}} importance of institutions in developing a country's <b>factor</b> <b>endowment</b> is that of North America (the United States and Canada) {{around the turn of the}} 20th century. It is commonly argued that these countries benefited greatly by borrowing many of Britain's institutions and laws. While North America undoubtedly gained from this borrowing, this does not fully explain why the rest of the New World (which also enjoyed a large <b>factor</b> <b>endowment</b> and access to British institutions) did not develop in a similar way. In fact, data shows that connection between the prosperity of the colonizing and the wealth of the colony was weaker than many thought. The future United States and Canada surpassed several British established colonies in the Caribbean, such as Barbados, Jamaica, Belize, and Guyana. In fact, the United States converged on the world economic leader, measured in GDP/capita, the UK. In 1910, the United States overtook the UK and began to diverge from it until about the 1950s. This shows that there must have been another explanation as to why the future United States and Canada developed at a faster rate than other colonies in the region.|$|E
50|$|New trade theory {{tries to}} explain {{empirical}} elements of trade that comparative advantage-based models above have difficulty with.

New trade theories are often based on assumptions such as monopolistic competition and increasing returns to scale. One result of these theories is the home-market effect, which asserts that, if an industry tends to cluster in one location because of returns to scale and if that industry faces high transportation costs, the industry will be located in the country with most of its demand, in order to minimize cost.|$|E

5000|$|Scarf {{has shown}} that under mild {{conditions}} on the technology matrix [...] there is a unique, smallest neighbourhood system, with the property that a local maximum is always global. This unique minimal neighbourhood system depends only on the technology matrix {{and not on the}} <b>factor</b> <b>endowment.</b> Thus to verify whether a production plan is optimal, one just needs to check if all its neighbours are either infeasible or yield an inferior value of the objective function. Therefore, the minimal neighbourhood system provides a unique quantity test for optimality {{in the case of a}} production set with indivisibilities analogous to the pricing test in the case of a convex production set. Scarf (also together with his coauthors) has identified many important classes of production technology matrices for which the minimal neighbourhood system can be easily computed.|$|E
5000|$|The best-known of the {{resulting}} models, the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem (H-O) depends upon the assumptions of no international differences of technology, productivity, or consumer preferences; no obstacles to pure competition or free trade and no scale economies. On those assumptions, it derives {{a model of the}} trade patterns that would arise solely from international differences in the relative abundance of labour and capital (referred to as factor endowments). The resulting theorem states that, on those assumptions, a country with a relative abundance of capital would export capital-intensive products and import labour-intensive products. The theorem proved to be of very limited predictive value, as was demonstrated by what {{came to be known as}} the [...] "Leontief Paradox" [...] (the discovery that, despite its capital-rich <b>factor</b> <b>endowment,</b> America was exporting labour-intensive products and importing capital-intensive products) Nevertheless, the theoretical techniques (and many of the assumptions) used in deriving the H-O model were subsequently used to derive further theorems.|$|E

When factor endowments are specified we are led to the general integer program {{for which there is}} no pricing test to detect whether a feasible production plan is indeed optimal. His major goals have been (1) to replace the pricing test by a local neighbourhood search and (2) to develop a mechanism for efficiently finding this test set. In the early 1980s, he made a decisive victory in achieving his first goal. Using his early concept of primitive sets arising in his research on the core and the computation of equilibria, Scarf succeeded in developing a quantity test set. He proved that this test set is unique and minimal, depending on the technology matrix alone and not on the specification of the particular <b>factor</b> <b>endowment.</b> It consists of a finite number of integral production plans. When this test set is available, one can easily use it to verify if a production plan is optimal or not, and if it is not optimal, one can use the test set to obtain a better production plan.|$|E

However, for most industries, the concentration is relatively unchanged or lower. Traditional theory of location predicts the location of industry based on <b>factor</b> <b>endowments.</b> We conduct regression analysis to determine if <b>factor</b> <b>endowments</b> are significant in explaining the location of industrial production.

5000|$|Kenneth Sokoloff and Stanley Engerman {{argue in}} their article [...] "History Lessons: Institutions, Factor Endowments, and Paths of Development in the New World" [...] that the {{difference}} between North America {{and the rest of the}} New World was not just in institutions but in the nature of their respective factor endowments. Countries like Brazil and Cuba had an extremely large yet concentrated <b>factor</b> <b>endowment</b> that tended toward exploitation, a hierarchical social system and exhibited economies of scale. Cuba and Brazil primarily grew lucrative products such as cotton, coffee, and sugar, which required hand picking and most efficiently picked when picked by hands in unison, whereas the United States was generally a wheat producer. The true advantage of the United States and Canada lay in a more equitable distribution of factors that could not be exploited on an extremely large scale. This distribution led to a more open and opportunistic economy, and eventually to long-term prosperity. For example, because wealth and power were distributed relatively equally in the United States and in Canada, these two countries led the rest of the Americas in providing education on a broader scale. Education is an important factor to improve technology in order to boost productivity, which is the reason that US and Canada surpassed the others. Greater access to education allowed for greater investment in human capital, which increases productivity and contributed to the United States and Canada's economic growth. According to Sokoloff and Engerman's article [...] "History Lessons: Institutions, Factors Endowments, and Paths of Development in the New World," [...] not only the United States had relatively equal distribution of wealth, it had relatively homogeneous population, political power and human capital. United States and Canada's relatively equal distribution of wealth, amount of human capital and political power ultimately affected development of institution, extent of franchise, and public education that persist and influence growth of the country. The open franchise in the United States and Canada was possible due to the large voting body of middle class and small elites. The open franchise brought elimination of wealth and literary requirement by 1940 in Canada and the United States (literacy requirement was still enforced in US southern regions only). Again, the open franchise was possible because the United States endowed a land suitable for wheat growing thus had a large body of middle class unlike Brazil and Cuba where they exhibited small elites, some overseers and large slave population. United States, then, outgrows other New World countries and eventually diverged from Cuba and Brazil in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.|$|E
