This is most familiar in the case of weather, which is generally predictable only about a week ahead. Of course, {{this does not mean that}} we cannot say anything about events far in the future; some restrictions on the system are present. With weather, we know that the temperature will not naturally reach 100°C or fall to -130°C on earth (during the current geologic era), but we can't say exactly what day will have the hottest temperature of the year.|$|E
25|$|A proper {{definition}} {{limits the}} kind of reasoning undertaken in the processing of an idea, expressed in natural language, with the object of limiting the impact of optimistic thinking that tends to result in an ideal-final explanation as the truth. One requirement of a definition <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> define that A is equal to B, then the reverse (B is equal to A) must also be true, or {{it is necessary to}} modify the original definition (A = B). In addition, a proper definition should have the following components: (1) it should be as simple as possible; (2) it should not involve circular reasoning; (3) it must be general or common; (4) metaphor, analogy, figurative language, description, obscure words, ghaib (occult words), abstractions, and vagueness are forbidden; and (5) a definition should not contain any negative statement.|$|E

500|$|Associated {{with the}} fact that the {{electron}} can be polarized is another small necessary detail which is connected {{with the fact}} that an electron is a fermion and obeys Fermi–Dirac statistics. The basic rule <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> have the probability amplitude for a given complex process involving more than one electron, then when we include (as we always must) the complementary Feynman diagram in which we just exchange two electron events, the resulting amplitude is the reverse – the negative – of the first. The simplest case would be two electrons starting at A and B ending at C and D. The amplitude would be calculated as the [...] "difference", , where we would expect, from our everyday idea of probabilities, that it would be a sum.|$|E
500|$|The {{first season}} {{received}} generally mixed to negative reviews. Many critics said {{the series was}} too similar to The Office and its mock documentary style. In particular, several commentators said the naive and well-meaning Leslie Knope character too closely resembled The Office protagonist Michael Scott, the well-intentioned but dimwitted manager of a paper company sales office. Maureen Ryan, television reviewer for the Chicago Tribune, said Parks and Recreation surpassed the Friends spin-off Joey as the [...] "worst example of NBC's tendency to extend its franchises well beyond what is desirable or logical." [...] Daniels said of the comparisons between Leslie Knope and Michael Scott, [...] "My sense <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> had built 'Parks and Recreation' around a 90-year-old Maasai warrior people would still have said, 'He reminds me of [...] Michael Scott'. There was just no way to escape it." [...] Poehler acknowledged {{that there was some}} validity to the comparisons, but felt that the series overcame them with the production of [...] "Rock Show": [...] "I think it was something we had to work through in the beginning, and I’m kind of hoping we’re {{on the other side of}} that and people will start to judge the show on its own, for what it is and realize it’s just a completely different world in a similar style." ...|$|E

2500|$|The special open neighborhoods U of x {{given in}} the {{definition}} are called evenly covered neighborhoods. [...] The evenly covered neighborhoods form an open cover of the space X. [...] The homeomorphic copies in C of an evenly covered neighborhood U are called the sheets over U.

[...] This means that locally, each covering map is 'isomorphic' to a projection {{in the sense that}} there is a homeomorphism, h, from the pre-image , of an evenly covered neighbourhood U, onto , where F is the fiber, satisfying the local trivialization condition, which <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> project [...] onto U, , so the composition of the projection [...] with the homeomorphism h will be a map [...] from the pre-image [...] onto U, then the derived composition [...] will equal p locally (within [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|The {{discovery}} of quantum groups was quite unexpected, {{since it was}} {{known for a long}} time that compact groups and semisimple Lie algebras are [...] "rigid" [...] objects, in other words, they cannot be [...] "deformed". One of the ideas behind quantum groups <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> consider a structure that is in a sense equivalent but larger, namely a group algebra or a universal enveloping algebra, then a group [...] or enveloping algebra can be [...] "deformed", although the deformation will no longer remain a group or enveloping algebra. More precisely, deformation can be accomplished within the category of Hopf algebras that are not required to be either commutative or cocommutative. One can think of the deformed object as an algebra of functions on a [...] "noncommutative space", in the spirit of the noncommutative geometry of Alain Connes. This intuition, however, came after particular classes of quantum groups had already proved their usefulness in the study of the quantum Yang-Baxter equation and quantum inverse scattering method developed by the Leningrad School (Ludwig Faddeev, Leon Takhtajan, Evgenii Sklyanin, Nicolai Reshetikhin and Vladimir Korepin) and related work by the Japanese School. The intuition behind the second, bicrossproduct, class of quantum groups was [...] different and came from the search for self-dual objects as an approach to quantum gravity.|$|E
