40|$|A general integer linear {{programming}} (ILP) model, which covers all possible second-failure flow recovery cases, is proposed {{in this paper}} to capture {{the structure of the}} <b>global</b> <b>backup</b> path reprovisioning scheme triggered after the first-failure flow recovery. Backup capacity contention in face of a new failure is resolved by incorporating a priority activation planning process into the model to achieve differentiated dual-failure restorability for two classes of flows. Numerical results show that without increasing the overall network-wide dual-failure non-restorability, the average network-wide dual-failure non-restorability of high class flows is relatively lower than that of low class flows by over 69 % with the proposed differentiated backup path reprovisioning and activation planning (RAP) scheme...|$|E
50|$|UltraBac Software, Inc. is {{a private}} {{corporation}} that is a <b>global</b> provider of <b>backup</b> and disaster recovery software. The company introduced UltraBac, backup software for Microsoft Windows, in 1995. Backup and disaster recovery protection is available for the Windows and Linux platforms, physical and virtual machines (including multiple hypervisors), and SQL and Exchange databases. UltraBac software is scalable from small to large organizations.|$|R
50|$|Job {{scheduling}} and batch processing are tools to help manage {{data processing systems}} by automating operations, improving quality, reducing costs, and improving resource utilization. Typical uses are scheduling file transfers, database updates, report generation, compilations and <b>backups.</b> <b>Global</b> ECS is particularly used by businesses whose core product is their information or data, such as financial institutions (banking, insurance, securities, brokerage, retirement and credit cards), government agencies, and information resources. Other industries to use Global ECS are energy, health care, retail and manufacturing.|$|R
25|$|It {{has also}} been {{suggested}} that on 11 September 2001, the New York infrastructure (including subways, phone service, and financial transactions) were able to continue operation because of the redundant networks established {{in the event of}} Y2K bug impact and the contingency plans devised by companies. The terrorist attacks and the following prolonged blackout to lower Manhattan had minimal effect on <b>global</b> banking systems. <b>Backup</b> systems were activated at various locations around the region, many of which had been established to deal with a possible complete failure of networks in the financial district on 31 December 1999.|$|R
