Isolated envelopes (cytoplasmic membrane, peptidogly-can and outer membrane) were chemically modified and functional carboxyl groups transformed to electropositive amine groups, using carbodiimide thylenediamine. Transformation of carboxyl groups was evaluated by measuring total amine groups in all fractions (modified or not). Using equilibrium dialysis and Scatchard plots for the data, we have established that isolated unmodified cell envelopes (cytoplasmic membrane, peptidoglycan <b>d</b> <b>outer</b> membrane) possess at least two types of metal binding sites with different association constants (K a and K'). Introduction of positive charges into the bacterial envelopes resulted in the disappearance of one type of metal binding site which had the highest association constant value for Ni 2 +, Cu 2 + and Zn 2 +.

40|$|Neurotoxic {{substances}} {{affect the}} nervous system in a selective manner. One possible basis for this selectivity is blood vessel permeability. In general, {{the central nervous system}} and the peripheral nerve trunks have <b>impermeable</b> blood <b>vessels,</b> but in certain parts the capillaries are "leaky," allowing the passage of a plasma filtrate. Intravenously injected protein tracers rapidly reach nerve cells in these regions, with the implication that these nerve cells are also readily accessible to circulating neurotoxic substances. Some examples of neurotoxicity in the central nervous system show a selectivity that could be due to capillary permeability. In experimental methylmercury poisoning, cranial nerve V and sensory dorsal root ganglia, which lie in regions of vascular permeability, are particularly susceptible. A number of drug and chemically induced neuropathies are predominantly sensory, and may be due, directly or indirectly, to the accessibility of neurotoxic substances to sensory neurons. Examination of areas of potential vulnerability to circulating toxic substances may be of value in the experimental testing of substances for neurotoxicity, where pharmacological tests may be negative and clinical symptoms difficult to assess...|$|R

The periplasm is thought to exist in a gel-like state rather than a liquid due to the high concentration of proteins and peptidoglycan found within it.

40|$|Abstract. Analysis of Venera 15 and 16 radar {{images and}} {{topographic}} {{data from the}} Freyja Montes region on Venus suggest that his mountain belt formed {{as a result of}} a sequence of underthrusts of the lithosphere of the North Polar Plains beneath the highlands of Ishtar Terra. The Freyja Montes deformation zone consists, south to north, of a linear orogenic belt, an adjacent plateau, a steep scarp separating the plateau from the North Polar Plains, a linear depression at the base of the scarp, and an outer rise. The topographic profile of the depression a <b>d</b> <b>outer</b> rise are remarkably similar to that of a foreland deep and rise formed by the flexure of the under-thrusting plate beneath a terrestrial mountain range. We test the lithospheric flexure hypothesis and we estimate the effective thickness Te of the elastic lithosphere of the under-thrusting portion of the North Polar Plains by fitting individual topographic profiles to deflection curves for a broken elastic plate. The theoretical curves fit the observed topographic profiles to within measurement error for values of flexural rigidity D in the range (0. 8 - 3) x 1022 N m, equivalent toT e in the range 11 - 18 km. Under the assumption that the base of the mechanical lithosphere is limited by the creep strength of olivine, the mean lithospheric thermal gradient is 14 - 23 K/km. The portion of the North Polar Plains to the immediate north of Freyja Montes stands at a regional elevation very near the modal elevation for the planet, so the inferred elastic!itho-sphere thickness and thermal gradient may be at least approxi-mately representative of a significant fraction of the Venus lithosphere. That the inferred thermal gradient is similar to the value expected for the global mean gradient on the basis of scaling from Earth provides upport for the hypothesis that simple conduction dominates lithospheric heat transport on Venus relative to lithospheric recycling and volcanism...|$|R
