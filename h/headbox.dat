50|$|The {{consistency}} in the flow box is typically under 0.4% for most paper grades, with longer fibres requiring lower consistency than short fibres. Higher consistency causes more fibres to be oriented in the z direction, while lower consistency promotes fibre orientation in the x-y direction. Higher consistency promotes higher calliper (thickness) and stiffness, lower consistency promotes higher tensile and some other strength properties and also improves formation (uniformity). Many sheet properties continue to improve down to below 0.1% consistency; however, this is an impractical amount of water to handle. (Most paper machine run a higher <b>headbox</b> consistency than optimum {{because they have been}} sped up over time without replacing the fan pump and <b>headbox.</b> There is also an economic trade off with high pumping costs for lower consistency).|$|E

50|$|On {{lower speed}} {{machines}} at 700 feet per minute, gravity and {{the height of}} the stock in the <b>headbox</b> creates sufficient pressure to form the jet through the opening of the slice. The height of the stock is the head, which gives the <b>headbox</b> its name. The speed of the jet compared to the speed of the wire is known as the jet-to-wire ratio. When the jet-to-wire ratio is less than unity, the fibres in the stock become drawn out in the machine direction. On slower machines where sufficient liquid remains in the stock before draining out, the wire can be driven back and forth with a process known as shake. This provides some measure of randomizing the direction of the fibres and gives the sheet more uniform strength in both the machine and cross-machine directions. On fast machines, the stock does not remain on the wire in liquid form long enough and the long fibres line up with the machine. When the jet-to-wire ratio exceeds unity, the fibers tend to pile up in lumps. The resulting variation in paper density provides the antique or parchment paper look.|$|E

50|$|Supporting {{the wire}} in the {{drainage}} table area {{are a number}} of drainage elements. In addition to supporting the wire and promoting drainage, the elements de-flocculate the sheet. On low speed machines these table elements are primarily table rolls. As speed increases the suction developed in the nip of a table roll increases and at high enough speed the wire snaps back after leaving the vacuum area and causes stock to jump off the wire, disrupting the formation. To prevent this drainage foils are used. The foils are typically sloped between zero and two or three degrees and give a more gentle action. Where rolls and foils are used, rolls are used near the <b>headbox</b> and foils further down machine.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{quality of}} paper {{such as a}} basis weight is {{basically}} determined by uniform dispersions of fibers through a <b>headbox</b> {{which is one of}} the components of paper machine. This means that the flow analysis and shape optimization of <b>headbox</b> are the most important issue for achieving the high quality of paper. In the present work, the shape optimization of <b>headbox</b> is carried out by integration CFD and optimization technology. The shape of <b>headbox</b> is parameterized by a Bezier curve and its control points are adopted as the design variables. Because the optimal solutions can be achieved when the deviation of flow rate at each diffuser and the pressure drop in the <b>headbox</b> are minimized, simultaneously, they are considered as the objective functions. A finite volume method (FVM) for calculating the flow characteristics which are directly related to the performance of paper machine and the simple multi-objective genetic algorithm (SMOGA) for searching the optimal design variables are used, respectively.

In the <b>headbox,</b> the suspension is mixed in the turbulence generator and then accelerated in the contracting slice channel. After the slice opening, the jet enters into free air and hits the moving fabrics called “wires”, where the water removal and the formation of the fiber network are initiated. Subsequent water removal processes by pressing and drying make paper more solid, but the basic fibrous structure of paper does not change noticeably.|$|E

40|$|Process {{industries}} are in general depending, {{in one way}} or the other, on fluid mechanics. Specifically, paper manufacturing, which probably is the dominant processindustry in Sweden, is depending on the flow of cellulose fibres suspended in water. As a part of the process the suspension, consisting of fibres in water, is spread out onor between two moving permeable weaves, i. e. wires. The speed of this is usually 10 – 30 m/s and the suspension is spread out by a plane jet issuing from a <b>headbox</b> nozzle. It has been show that the conditions in the <b>headbox</b> and jet have a large influence onthe quality of the final paper sheet. Primarily, streaks in the paper sheet are believedto be the result of streamwise streaks in the <b>headbox</b> jet. The thesis is aimed at the flow phenomena which occur in the <b>headbox</b> jet. Theinvestigations have been made with numerical calculations, stability theory and modelexperiments using water, as well as experiments with a real paper machine headboxand fibre suspension. In the thesis an introduction to the hydrodynamics of planeliquid jets is presented together with a description of the paper forming process andthe fluid mechanics of <b>headbox</b> flow. The basic flow and stability of a two-dimensional plane liquid jet has been investigatedby numerical calculations, stability theory and experiments. The calculationsof the laminar basic flow is successfully compared to pitot-tube measurements of thestreamwise velocity profile. By visualisations of the flow it is found that wave disturbanceson the jet has a severe effect on the flow. These waves can be predicted bylinear stability theory, which shows the presence of five convectively unstable modes. These can be divided into three types and by comparison with the experiments thetype of the visible waves is determined. These waves seem to initiate a break-up ofthe jet, which leads to strong streamwise streaks inside the jet. By flow visualisation of <b>headbox</b> flow of an experimental paper machine, togetherwith analysis of the resulting paper structure using the wavelet method the correspondencebetween flow disturbances and paper quality was investigated. It was shownthat the wave instability, which is present on the low Reynolds number water jet, alsocan be found in the real the <b>headbox</b> jet. It is shown that these waves play an importantrole in the dynamics of the <b>headbox</b> jet and also have an influence on the final papersheet. QC 2010082...|$|E

The effect of fiber length on strength efficiency in twin-wire roll forming was presently investigated by examining two furnishes with different average fiber length, prepared from the same batch of softwood kraft pulp, over a wide range of <b>headbox</b> consistencies on a pilot machine. An increase in fiber length resulted not only in worse Ambertec formation over the whole range of <b>headbox</b> consistencies but also in faster relative deterioration of the formation with increasing consistency. Tensile strength efficiency and Z-strength efficiency were both reduced when the formation was impaired through increased fiber length, and the effect was similar to the effect of a corresponding change in formation through <b>headbox</b> consistency.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether elective use of nasal continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) following extubation of preterm infants was well tolerated and improved short- and long-term outcomes. A randomized comparison of nasal CPAP to <b>headbox</b> oxygen was undertaken and a meta-analysis performed including similar randomized trials involving premature infants less than 28 days of age. A total of 150 infants (median gestational age 30 weeks, range 24 - 34 weeks) were randomized in two centres. Fifteen nasal CPAP infants and 25 <b>headbox</b> infants required increased respiratory support post-extubation and 15 nasal CPAP infants and nine <b>headbox</b> infants required reintubation (non significant). Eight infants became intolerant of CPAP and were changed to <b>headbox</b> oxygen within 48 h of extubation; 19 <b>headbox</b> infants developed apnoeas and respiratory acidosis requiring rescue nasal CPAP, 3 ultimately were re-intubated. Seven other trials were identified, giving a total number of 569 infants. Overall, nasal CPAP significantly reduced the need for increased respiratory support (relative risk, 0. 57, 95 % CI 0. 43 - 0. 73), but not for re-intubation (relative risk 0. 89, 95 % CI 0. 68 - 1. 17). Nasal CPAP neither influenced significantly the intraventricular haemorrhage rate reported in four studies (relative risk 1. 0, 95 % CI 0. 55, 1. 82) nor that of oxygen dependency at 28 days reported in six studies (relative risk 1. 0, 95 % CI 0. 8, 1. 25).

40|$|AIM—To {{determine}} whether extubation to nasal continuous airway pressure (NCPAP) {{results in a}} greater proportion of infants remaining free of additional ventilatory support for one week after extubation compared with those extubated directly to <b>headbox</b> oxygen.  METHODS—A randomised, controlled, clinical trial was conducted at the neonatal intensive care unit of the Royal Women's Hospital, Melbourne, of infants with birthweights between 600 and 1250 g, ventilated via an endotracheal tube for more than 12 hours, requiring less than 50 % oxygen, a ventilator rate ⩽ 20 /minute, considered by the clinical management team to be ready for extubation. Infants were randomly allocated either to NCPAP or to oxygen administered via a <b>headbox.</b> Success was defined by no requirement for additional ventilatory support over the week following extubation. Failure criteria were (i) apnoea; (ii) absolute increase in oxygen requirement greater than 15 % above that required before extubation; or (iii) respiratory acidosis (pH 6. 67 kPa).  RESULTS—Thirty one of 47 (66 %) infants were successfully extubated to NCPAP compared with 18 of 45 (40 %) for <b>headbox</b> oxygen. The increase in failure rate in the <b>headbox</b> group was due primarily to increased oxygen requirements in this group. Of the 27 who failed <b>headbox</b> oxygen, 26 were given a trial of NCPAP and 13 did not require endotracheal reintubation. There {{was no significant difference between}} the groups in the total number of days of assisted ventilation or the duration of inpatient stay.  CONCLUSIONS—NCPAP applied prophylactically after endotracheal extubation reduces the incidence of adverse clinical events that lead to failure of extubation in the seven days after extubation. This reduction is clinically important. The benefits of NCPAP do not seem to be associated with an increased incidence of unwanted side effects. ...|$|E
