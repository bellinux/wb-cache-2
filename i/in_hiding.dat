5|$|In April 1917, Pećanac re-emerged {{with his}} guerrillas, attacking a railway station, {{destroying}} a bridge and raiding a Bulgarian {{village on the}} border. Pećanac avoided a further offensive by the occupation forces in July by disappearing into the mountains once again. After emerging for a short time, in September–October 1917 Pećanac again dispersed his guerrillas and infiltrated the Austro-Hungarian occupied zone, where he remained <b>in</b> <b>hiding</b> until mid-1918. During his period <b>in</b> <b>hiding,</b> {{he met with the}} Kosovar Albanian leader Azem Galica to discuss joint actions against the occupation forces.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the end of}} the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising (May 1943) and {{beginning}} of 1944, there were between 10,000 and 20,000 Jews hiding in the Ghetto ruins. The number of Robinsons after the Warsaw Uprising has been estimated at between several hundred and two thousand, spread across all the suburbs of Warsaw. Another source gives the number as between 400 and 1,000. Most of those hiding were Jewish, including some who had been <b>in</b> <b>hiding</b> since the fall of the ghetto uprising, though a significant number were non-Jewish Poles. Unlike Szpilman, whose case was somewhat unrepresentative, most of those <b>in</b> <b>hiding</b> remained in medium-sized to large groups, often of mixed ethnicities. The majority of the Robinsons were men.|$|E
30|$|The {{expert system}} {{database}} is obtained by extensively simulating the system under normal and fault conditions of a transmission line during the investigation. The inputs are combined and also {{linked with the}} output, based on the expert system database to find the accurate ANN output. Accuracy of ANN outputs was also tested with various numbers of hidden layer neurons (up to 50 neurons). Best accuracy is found with 3 neurons <b>in</b> <b>hidden</b> layer for L–G fault, 4 neurons <b>in</b> <b>hidden</b> layer for L–L–G fault, 5 neurons <b>in</b> <b>hidden</b> layer for L–L fault and 7 neurons <b>in</b> <b>hidden</b> layer for 3 -phase fault. The various extensive fault conditions considered to train the ANN are explained in Performance evaluation and result section.|$|R

5|$|Mírzá Yahyá's {{leadership}} was controversial. He generally absented {{himself from the}} Bábí community, spending his time in Baghdad <b>in</b> <b>hiding</b> and disguise; on several occasions he {{went so far as}} to publicly disavow allegiance to the Báb. Mírzá Yahyá gradually alienated himself from a large number of the Bábís, who started giving their allegiance to other claimants. During the time that Mírzá Yahyá remained <b>in</b> <b>hiding,</b> Bahá'u'lláh performed much of the daily administration of Bábí affairs. In contrast to Mírzá Yahyá, Bahá'u'lláh was outgoing and accessible and he was seen by an increasing number of Bábís as a religious leader, rather than just an organizer, and became their center of devotion.|$|E

Still a fugitive, Massino summoned Vitale, Louis Attanasio and James Tartaglione to his hideout and gave them the order. By this time, even though Rastelli was still officially head of the family, Massino was considered by most mobsters to be the family's street boss and field commander in all but name, as well as Rastelli's heir apparent. According to Vitale, Massino had Bonventre killed for giving him no support when he was <b>in</b> <b>hiding.</b>|$|E
