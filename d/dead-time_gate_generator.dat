Altimeter Timing System (ATS) is a universal timing system for laser ranging in ground-ground, air-ground and ground-satellite experiments. It is dedicated to measure precise time interval with sub-nanosecond resolution. The device for advanced range gating is included. The unit is interfaced to a host personal computer via a serial data link for control, two-way data transfer and diagnostics. The entire ATS has been designed and constructed {{on the basis of}} the Portable Calibration Standard (PCS) for satellite laser ranging, which has been developed in our labs within the last ten years. To reduce the complexity, costs, weight and power, considering the modest timing resolution requirements, the sub-nanoseconds instead of picoseconds resolution of the time intervals, the timing part of the original device has been replaced by the Mini Counter. The overall design philosophy, the operational control software, the epoch timing, the range gate generation have been preserved along with the concept of the host computer software package for data acquisition, control and data analysis including the communication protocol, data and command formats etc. The use of well-tested concept of both the HW and SW enabled to shorten the design, construction and testing phase of the final device down to several weeks.

40|$|Multiphase Machines offer a {{promising}} solution to many practical challenges {{due to their}} advantages over the three phase counterparts, as fault-tolerant capability and lower torque ripple magnitude. Among different multiphase machines, five-phase machines correspond to a relatively practical selection in industrial applications. Multiphase machines are conventionally fed from voltage source inverter (VSI) as it facilities the operation under open-phase condition but with a sophisticated controller. Among different power converter topologies, current source inverter (CSI) features a simple inverter structure, a lower switching dv/dt, and a reliable short circuit protection. However, the control of multiphase CSI under open phase has not been yet considered in the literature. Additionally, the space vector PWM (SVPWM) of multiphase CSI is still challenging. Alternatively, the mapped sinusoidal PWM can offer simpler control over SVPWM. In this paper, a fault-tolerant controller for a five-phase CSI inverter is introduced and proposed for medium voltage drive applications.

In practical applications, {{the combination of}} an InGaAs/InP APD with an appropriate electronic circuit still stands as the best solution in comparison with emerging technologies such as superconducting single photon detectors, MCP-PMTs for the near IR or up-conversion technique. An ASIC dedicated to the operation of InGaAs/InP APDs in both gated mode and free-running mode is presented. The 1. 6 mm 2 chip is fabricated in a CMOS technology. It combines a <b>gate</b> <b>generator,</b> a voltage limiter, a fast comparator, a precise timing circuit for the gate signal processing and an output stage.

The avalanche quenching process is extremely fast, thus reducing the afterpulsing effects. The packaging of the diode in close proximity with the quenching circuit enables high speed gating at frequencies larger than 10 MHz. The reduced connection lengths combined with impedance adaptation technique provide excellent gate quality, free of oscillations or bumps. The excess bias voltage is thus constant over the gate width leading to a stable single photon detection probability and timing resolution.

Since that time, we have received {{a small amount of}} discretionary funding to further explore the transponder concept and to develop and test an engineering breadboard. Candidate operational scenarios for acquiring and tracking the opposite laser terminal over interplanetary distances have been developed, and breadboard engineering parameters were chosen to reflect the requirements of an Earth-Mars link Laboratory tests have been devised to simulate the Earth- Mars link between two independent SLR 2000 transceivers and to demonstrate the transfer of range and time in single photon mode. The present paper reviews the concept of the asynchronous microlaser transponder, the transponder breadboard design, an operational scenario recently developed for an asteroid rendezvous, and the laboratory test setup. The optical head of the transponder breadboard fits within a cylinder roughly 15 cm in diameter and 32 cm in length and is mounted in a commercial two axis gimbal driven by two computer-controlled stepper motors which allows the receiver optical axis to be centered on a simulated Earth image. The optical head is built around a small optical bench which supports a 14. 7 cm diameter refractive telescope, a prototype 2 kHz SLR 2000 microlaser transmitter, a quadrant microchannel plate photomultiplier (MCP/PMT), a CCD array camera, spatial and spectral filters, assorted lenses and mirrors, and protective covers and sun shields. The microlaser is end-pumped by a fiber-coupled diode laser array. An annular mirror is employed as a passive transmit/receive (T/R) switch in an aperture-sharing arrangement wherein the transmitted beam passes through the central hole and illuminates only the central 2. 5 cm of the common telescope (adequate to achieve a 10 arcsecond full laser beam divergence) while the receiver uses the remainder of the 14. 7 cm aperture.

In the closed loop system, acceleration and the deceleration of the motor can be controlled according to the requirement. In order to regulate drives automatically, the controlled variables are measured. A tachogenerator is used for this purpose. The output of the tachogenerators is compared with a preset reference voltage. The differences between these two signals are fed as an actuating signal to control {{the elements of the}} system. Control amplifiers are used as both comparators and amplifiers. As a small change in the voltage can cause a large change in the motor current and lead to a particular drive control feature.

40|$|Due to an {{increased}} focus {{on the development of}} high-power marine microgrids, new vessels are being installed with large power systems including highly fluctuating loads operating at high efficiency and low emissions. The introduction of a battery energy storage system in a shipboard DC grid allows for operating the diesel gensets at variable speeds, not being locked to a fixed frequency or speed. The transient performance of the system can also be improved and an optimal load leveling of the different prime movers can be achieved by the proper implementation of a battery. Thus, the system can operate efficiently with highly fluctuating loads while keeping the fuel consumption low. In order to integrate the batteries into the shipboard DC grid, high-power bidirectional DC/DC converters are needed. Many converter configurations are available, yielding different advantages and disadvantages. Thus, each different system should be evaluated in order to see which converter topology is best suited for that specific system. The stress levels on the switching devices are also higher than before, which {{can be seen as a}} result of the utilization of higher voltages and currents in the shipboard grids. Isolated bidirectional DC/DC converters for high power applications can provide the proper connection, but along with the increased loads comes higher requirements to component ratings as well as a more complex control system. A high-power medium-voltage DC/DC converter suitable for implementing such a battery is analyzed in this thesis after explaining the shipboard electrical system. The converter has a rated power of 4 MW with an equal input and output voltage of 1100 V and with a high-frequency transformer providing galvanic isolation between the shipboard power grid and the battery. Its performance is evaluated by means of modeling it in Matlab/Simulink where the focus has been on the switch resonance components in order to achieve a high-performance, soft-switched converter. A PI controller is also implemented in order regulate the output voltage of the converter for different load levels. As some of the converter requirements are a robust design, high operating efficiency and a fast response, the PI controller is tuned in order achieve this and it is seen that the converter responds fast with small deviations in parameter values for load variations of several megawatts. A <b>gate</b> signal <b>generator</b> is also made, where the output of the PI controller is used as input, delaying the gate signals to switches in either the primary or secondary side, depending on the power flow direction. The model is used to analyze the current waveforms through the switches and the transformer, and by doing measurements and calculations based on the simulation results, the efficiency of the converter is calculated at different load steps ranging from 0 to 4 MW. It is seen that the converter operates at an efficiency of 97. 2 % at an output power of 4 MW with increasing efficiency for lower load levels due to the lower conduction losses.
