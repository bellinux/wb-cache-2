40|$|Purpose {{of review}} Allogeneic <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>cell</b> {{transplantation}} with myeloablative conditioning {{is a well}} established therapy for patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Its efficacy depends, in part, on the destruction of recipient acute myeloid leukemia cells by the conditioning regimen and, in part on their removal by donor immune cells contained in the graft (graft-versus-tumor effect). Due to regiment related toxicities, the use of myeloablative allogeneic <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>cell</b> transplantation has been restricted to younger patients in good condition. More recently, the introduction of allogeneic <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>cell</b> transplantation following reduced-intensity or nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens, which rely mainly on graft-versus-tumor effects for tumor cell eradication, has permitted extending <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>cell</b> transplantation to include older patients and those with medical comorbidities. Recent findings Early results with allogeneic <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>cell</b> transplantation after nonmyeloablative and reduced-intensity conditioning for patients with acute myeloid leukemia in first complete remission are encouraging, with 2 -year survivals after <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>cell</b> transplantation ranging from 48 to 79 % among studies.

Recently, we observed that the adult pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin- 1 is involved in regulating aorta-gonad-mesonephros hematopoietic progenitor and <b>hematopoietic</b> stem <b>cell</b> activity. Therefore, we set out to investigate whether interleukin- 1 also plays a role in regulating fetal liver progenitor <b>cells</b> and <b>hematopoietic</b> stem <b>cells.</b> Design and Methods We examined the interleukin- 1 ligand and receptor expression pattern in the fetal liver.

This study focuses on the comparison of the capacity of cord blood and bone marrow <b>hematopoietic</b> stem <b>cells</b> to generate T cells in vitro. Design and Methods: <b>Hematopoietic</b> stem <b>cells</b> were cultured in OP 9 -delta-like- 1 and OP 9 -green fluorescent protein co-cultures to estimate T and myeloid generation capacity, respectively. Phenotypic markers of T-lineage or myeloid differentiation were measured by flow cytometry and used to analyze their kinetics as a function of culture time. <b>Hematopoietic</b> stem <b>cells</b> were labeled with carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinamidyl ester and analyzed after culture to track their phenotypic progression in consecutive generations. Mixed OP 9 -delta-like- 1 co-cultures were done with either carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinamidyl ester-labeled bone marrow and unlabeled cord blood <b>hematopoietic</b> stem <b>cells,</b> or vice versa, to evaluate their mutual influence on T-lineage differentiation. The T-cell potential of <b>hematopoietic</b> stem <b>cells</b> was addressed quantitatively by limiting dilution analysis. Results: Bulk cultures showed faster and more extensive T-cell differentiation by cord blood <b>hematopoietic</b> stem <b>cells.</b> Furthermore, the T-lymphoid differentiation capacity of cord blood and bone marrow <b>hematopoietic</b> stem <b>cells</b> can be discriminated very early based on the coordinated expression of CD 34 and CD 7.

2500|$|Hematopoiesis {{is defined}} as the {{formation}} and development of blood cells, all of which are derived from hematopoietic stem-progenitor cells (HSPCs). [...] HSPCs are primitive cells capable of self-renewal and initially differentiate into common myeloid progenitor (CMP) or common lymphoid progenitor (CLP) cells. [...] CMPs represent the cellular population that has become myeloid lineage and it is the point that myelopoeisis begins. [...] During myelopoeisis further cellular differentiation takes place including thrombopoiesis, erythropoeisis, granulopoeisis, and [...] monocytopoeisis. [...] CLPs subsequently differentiate into B-cells and T-cells in a process designated lymphopoiesis. [...] Given that miR-155-5p is expressed in <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>cells</b> it was hypothesized that this miRNA plays a critical role in these cellular differentiation processes. [...] In support of this premise, miR-155-5p was found to be expressed in CD34(+) human HSPCs, and it was speculated that this miRNA may hold these cells at an early stem-progenitor stage, inhibiting their differentiation into a more mature cell (i.e. megakaryocytic/erythroid/granulocytic/monocytic/B-lymphoid/T-lymphoid). [...] This hypothesis was substantiated when pre-mir-155 transduced HSPCs generated 5-fold fewer myeloid and 3-fold fewer erythroid colonies. [...] Additionally, Hu et al. demonstrated that the homeobox protein, HOXA9, regulated MIR155HG expression in myeloid cells and that this miRNA played a functional role in hematopoiesis. [...] These investigators found that forced expression of miR-155-5p in bone marrow cells resulted in a ~50% decrease in SPI1 (i.e. PU.1), a transcription factor and a regulator of myelopoiesis, and a validated target of this miRNA. [...] It was also established that in vitro differentiation of purified human erythroid progenitor cells resulted in a progressive decrease of miR-155-5p expression in mature red cells. [...] Additionally, mice deficient in pre-mir-155 showed clear defects in lymphocyte development and generation of B- and T-cell responses in vivo. [...] Finally, it was established that regulatory T-cell (Tregs) development required miR-155-5p and this miRNA was shown {{to play a role in}} Treg homeostasis and overall survival by directly targeting SOCS1, a negative regulator for IL-2 signaling.
