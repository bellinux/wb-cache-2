5|$|According to {{the view}} that is {{widespread}} among the Russian music public, I am associated with the party that is antagonistic to the one living Russian composer I love and value above all others—Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov.... In a word, despite our different musical identities, it would seem we are following a single path; and I, for my part, am proud to have such a fellow traveler.... Lyadov and Glazunov are also numbered among my opponents, yet <b>I</b> <b>sincerely</b> love and value their talent.|$|E

25|$|Heinz Hopf, who {{had been}} in Berlin before his {{appointment}} to Zurich at the ETH Privatdozent, held - as is clear from oral statements and also from letters - Issai Schur as a mathematician and greatly appreciated man. Here, this appreciation was based entirely on reciprocity: in a letter of 1930 to George Pólya {{on the occasion of the}} re-appointment of Hermann Weyl, Schur says of Hopf: Hopf is a very excellent teacher, a mathematician of strong temperament and strong effect, a master's discipline, trained excellent in other areas. - If I have to characterize him as a man, it may suffice if I say that <b>I</b> <b>sincerely</b> look forward to each time I meet with him.|$|E

500|$|On Bennett's {{return to}} London {{he took up}} a {{teaching}} post at the RAM which he held until 1858. During his second long stay in Germany, from October 1838 to March 1839, he played his Fourth Piano Concerto (Op. 19, in F minor) and the Wood Nymphs Overture, Op. 20. Returning to England, {{he wrote to his}} Leipzig publisher Friedrich Kistner in 1840, bemoaning the difference between England and Germany (and hoping that a German would redress the situation): You know what a dreadful place England is for music; and in London I have nobody who I can talk to about such things, all the people are mad with [...] Thalberg and [...] Strauss , and I have not heard a single Symphony or Overture in one concert since last June. <b>I</b> <b>sincerely</b> hope that Prince Albert... will do something to improve our taste.|$|E
500|$|Criticisms of Green Wing {{include the}} lazzi methods of filming {{and the overall}} length of the episodes, {{claiming}} that hour-long episodes are too long. The show won the 2005 and 2006 Comedy Tumbleweed Awards for [...] "Worst Camerawork". Some were also critical of what {{was seen as a}} decline in quality when the second series began. Cathy Pryor in The Independent on Sunday said that, [...] "Sadly, though, since I'm something of a fan, I have to report that the first episode of the second series is, disappointingly, rather flat. To be fair, {{there were a couple of}} laugh-out-loud moments - Dr Statham banging his head and falling down being one of them - but the whole [...] didn't quite gel. Or should that be coagulate? I'll stop making bad jokes now since I'm still not as funny as anyone in the show. But <b>I</b> <b>sincerely</b> hope that the opener is a one- off and not a sign that Green Wing is going down the pan." ...|$|E

500|$|Washington Post {{journalist}} Erik Wemple {{criticized the}} story's graphic {{details of the}} alleged crime and {{said that it was}} hard to believe due to the [...] "diabolical" [...] description. A number of commentators accused the magazine of setting rape victims [...] "back decades", while The Washington Post described the Rolling Stone story as a [...] "catastrophe for journalism". Natasha Vargas-Cooper, a columnist at The Intercept, said that Erdely's decision not to interview the accused fraternity members showed [...] "a horrendous, hidden bias ... the premise that none of these guys would tell the truth if asked", while a staff editorial in The Wall Street Journal charged that [...] "Ms. Erdely did not construct a story based on facts, but went looking for facts to fit her theory." [...] Lauren Kling of the Poynter Institute criticized Rolling Stone for [...] "blaming [...] source" [...] instead of taking ownership of their own errors. Anna Merlan, a writer for Jezebel, who had earlier called Reason columnist Robby Soave an [...] "idiot" [...] for expressing skepticism of the Rolling Stone story, declared: [...] "I was dead fucking wrong, and for that <b>I</b> <b>sincerely</b> apologize." [...] Merlan had also labeled journalist Richard Bradley's doubts about the article a [...] "giant ball of shit".|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to [...] "Fight Club" [...] {{was largely}} negative. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode a [...] "D–"; {{he called it}} [...] "dire stuff" [...] and wrote that [...] "there’s something rancid about forced quirk; it’s rotten and smug". Handlen both criticized Griffin's inability to portray two separate characters, as well as Carter's failure at writing a comedic script. He also felt that the [...] "relentless self-awareness isn’t amusing anymore". Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave the episode a scathing review. He wrote [...] "If it is indeed true that somewhere out in this vast world we all have an identical twin, I have but one wish for mine. <b>I</b> <b>sincerely</b> hope he was spared the hour of torture that 'Fight Club' imposed upon me." [...] Christina Brzustoski from 11th Hour Magazine opined that [...] "Just when you thought The X-Files couldn't get a more grating guest star than Victoria Jackson, Chris Carter manages to top himself yet again with not one, but two, {{for the love of}} God, two Kathy Griffins in the Carter-penned episode 'Fight Club.' It's a safe bet this disjointed, lame episode will probably not be easily confused with the far superior David Fincher movie of the same name. But then the current state of The X-Files makes Elmo in Grouchland look like an Oscar contender." ...|$|E
