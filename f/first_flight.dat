5|$|Beset {{by early}} {{construction}} problems, the first FSD aircraft {{was transferred to}} Groom Lake in May1981 inside a C-5. Further problems, this time with fuel leaks, delayed the <b>first</b> <b>flight.</b> Under the control of Harold Farley, the aircraft took off on 18June for its maiden flight, nine months after the July1980 <b>first</b> <b>flight</b> originally envisaged. The first production F-117A was delivered in 1982, and operational capability was achieved in October1983; the 59th and last F-117 was delivered in 1990.|$|E
5|$|On April 19, 1944, {{the second}} {{production}} Lockheed Constellation, piloted by Howard Hughes and TWA president Jack Frye, flew from Burbank, California, to Washington, D.C. in 6 hours and 57 minutes (2300mi– 330.9mph). On the return trip, the airliner stopped at Wright Field to give Orville Wright his last airplane flight, more than 40 {{years after his}} historic <b>first</b> <b>flight.</b> He may even have briefly handled the controls. He commented that the wingspan of the Constellation was longer than the distance of his <b>first</b> <b>flight.</b>|$|E

5|$|ANA was of {{the opinion}} that if a small amount of water entered a fuel tank during {{refuelling}} it would only reach the drain cocks when the aircraft was in level flight so it could not be detected immediately after re-fuelling. For 15 years ANA had operated in the knowledge that the only satisfactory time to check fuel tanks for the presence of water was prior to the <b>first</b> <b>flight</b> of the day, after the aircraft had been stationary overnight. Throughout this time ANA checked fuel tanks for the presence of water prior to the <b>first</b> <b>flight</b> of the day.|$|E
5|$|Flight testing {{began with}} the <b>first</b> <b>flight</b> of the second AH-56 (s/n 66-8827) in September 1967. During early flight tests, a rotor {{instability}} issue was discovered when the aircraft was flying at low altitude in ground effect. As the flight envelope was expanded, this instability and other minor problems were discovered and quickly addressed.|$|E

5|$|HB1001 {{made its}} <b>first</b> <b>flight</b> on 1December1977 {{at the hands}} of Lockheed test pilot, Bill Park. He would fly the next four sorties, all chased by a T-38 piloted by Major (later Lieutenant Colonel) Ken Dyson. Dyson, an F-15 Eagle pilot, was {{previously}} approached by United States Air Force personnel about the project in 1976. He made his <b>first</b> <b>flight</b> on HB1001 on 17January1978, chased by Park. In fact, the two would be the only test pilots of Have Blue, alternating between the demonstrator and the chase plane. Flight test results allowed engineers to refine the FBW system. At the same time, they verified predictions made earlier by aerodynamic engineers on the aircraft's behavior.|$|E

40|$|The <b>first</b> <b>flights</b> of the ER- 2 {{solar cell}} {{calibration}} demonstration were conducted during September-October of 2014. Three flights were performed {{that not only}} tested out the equipment and operational procedures, but also demonstrated the capability of this unique facility by conducting the first short-circuit measurements {{on a variety of}} test solar cells. Very preliminary results of these <b>first</b> <b>flights</b> were presented at the 2014 Space Photovoltaic Research and Technology (SPRAT) Conference in Cleveland, OH shortly following these <b>first</b> <b>flights.</b> At the 2015 Space Power Workshop, a more detailed description of these <b>first</b> ER- 2 <b>flights</b> will be presented, along with the final flight data from some of the test cells that were flown and has now been reduced and corrected for ER- 2 atmospheric flight conditions.

5|$|After a {{company-wide}} {{contest to}} name the aircraft, the initial prototype received the name Pirate and made its <b>first</b> <b>flight</b> on 2 October 1946. Flight testing revealed severe aerodynamic problems, mostly caused by the airfoil section and thickness of the wing. The vertical stabilizer also had to be redesigned to smooth out the airflow {{at the intersection of}} the horizontal and vertical stabilizers. Other changes included the addition of dive brakes {{on the sides of the}} fuselage and the replacement of the Metalite panels near the engine's exhaust with stainless steel ones.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} from abroad, Laurer held several different jobs: a cocktail waitress in a strip club, singer in a band, and a 900-number chat line worker. In her mid-to-late 20s, {{while living in}} the Florida Keys, she took a six-week class to train to be a flight attendant. On {{the way to her}} <b>first</b> <b>flight,</b> she was in a car accident and spent four days in the hospital. After recovering from the accident, Laurer's sister Kathy helped her get a job selling pagers, and both women also worked as belly dancers.|$|E
5|$|Although sales {{never fully}} recovered, the {{improved}} Comet2 and the prototype Comet3 {{culminated in the}} redesigned Comet4 series which debuted in 1958 and had a productive career of over 30years. The Comet was adapted {{for a variety of}} military roles such as VIP, medical and passenger transport, as well as surveillance. The most extensive modification resulted in a specialised maritime patrol aircraft variant, the Hawker Siddeley Nimrod. Nimrod remained in service with the Royal Air Force (RAF) until June 2011, over 60 years after the Comet's <b>first</b> <b>flight.</b>|$|E

5|$|Assigned {{the serial}} number 1440, the XSO2U-1 flew for the first time, as a landplane, in July 1939; its <b>first</b> <b>flight</b> as a {{seaplane}} took place that December. Flight testing of the SO2U showed that the aircraft lacked directional stability; {{the addition of a}} large ventral fin, connecting the rear of the float to the tail, helped to cure the problem.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the Tu-80 {{began in}} November 1948, using as many Tu-4 {{components}} {{as possible to}} speed up construction, but the <b>first</b> <b>flight</b> was not until 1 December 1949, after the Council of Ministers had canceled the program on 16 September 1949 {{in favor of the}} Tu-85 which was expected to have much better performance. The Tu-80 became a research aircraft, testing reversible-pitch propellers and structural deformation in heavy aircraft. It eventually became a target on a bombing and gunnery range.|$|E
5|$|During November1993, {{assembly}} of the first prototype commenced at two separate locations, these being Sikorsky's facility in Stratford, Connecticut and Boeing's manufacturing plant in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; later on, all of the rotorcraft's sub-assemblies were transferred to the former location where final assembly occurred. In the following year, the number of prototypes to be produced was reduced from four to two rotorcraft. On 25May1995, the first Comanche prototype was formally rolled out at Sikorsky's production facility, after which it was transferred to West Palm Beach, Florida to commence flight testing activities. On 4January1996, the prototype, flown by test pilots Bob Gradle and Rus Stiles, performed its 39-minute maiden flight. The <b>first</b> <b>flight</b> had been originally planned to take place during August 1995, but had been delayed {{by a number of}} structural and software problems that had been encountered. On 30 March 1999, the second prototype conducted its <b>first</b> <b>flight,</b> before joining the flight test program shortly thereafter.|$|E
