5|$|After {{qualifying}} as a barrister, {{he moved}} to Birmingham in 1914, choosing the city because he had some connections there thanks to his association with Cadbury, and began work at the chambers of John Hurst. His career was aided by the outbreak of World War I; many of the younger and <b>fitter</b> barristers were called up for war service, whilst Birkett himself, who was thirty {{when he joined the}} bar, avoided conscription as he was declared medically unfit. He was suffering from tuberculosis, and he returned to Ulverston for six months to recover. During his time in Birmingham, he continued his work as a minister, regularly preaching at the Baptist People's Chapel.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{commitments}} {{during the}} war, {{the fourth of}} the brothers, Harold Lindsay Harvey was unable to pursue a cricket career. He played mainly Second XI cricket at Fitzroy, but did play in the First XI during the war. A <b>fitter</b> and turner, Harold Harvey enlisted on 19 April 1945 and was discharged on 20 January 1947 with the rank of sergeant. He served with the Second Australian Imperial Force in Bougainville in New Guinea and played 15 First XI matches for Fitzroy from 1942-43 to 1949-50, as a wicketkeeper-batsman, scoring 237 runs {{at an average of}} 14.81.|$|E
40|$|Person-environment (PE) <b>fit</b> {{has been}} {{considered}} one of the most pervasive concepts in psychology. This study presents an integrative investigation of three levels of PE fit: person-vocation (PV) <b>fit,</b> person-organization (PO) <b>fit,</b> and person-job (PJ) <b>fit,</b> using multiple conceptualizations (e. g., value congruence, needs-supplies <b>fit)</b> of each <b>fit</b> level. While a trend in the PE <b>fit</b> literature has been the inclusion of only one <b>fit</b> level with a single conceptualization, researchers call for the addition of multiple conceptualizations of multiple <b>fit</b> levels in a single study. Traditionally, PO <b>fit</b> has been conceptualized as value congruence, whereas PV <b>fit</b> has remained untouched in the literature investigating the direct measurement of <b>fit</b> perceptions. Therefore, new <b>fit</b> perceptions scales assessing PO <b>fit</b> using a needs-supplies <b>fit</b> conceptualization and PV <b>fit</b> using a variety of conceptualizations were introduced. To address the limitation of employing direct measures, common method variance was modeled with a positive affect factor. The study accomplished two objectives. First, a previously supported three-factor model of <b>fit</b> perceptions consisting of PO value congruence (PO-VC), PJ needs-supplies (PJ-NS), and PJ demands-abilities (PJ-DA) <b>fit</b> was strongly replicated. Second, this model was expanded by examining additional conceptualizations (needs-supplies, demands-abilities <b>fit,</b> value, personality, and interest congruence) of <b>fit</b> levels (PV, PO, and PJ <b>fit).</b> Results suggested that professionals make distinctions based on both the <b>fit</b> level and <b>fit</b> conceptualization and these <b>fit</b> perceptions uniquely influence their attitudes and behaviors. A six-factor model (PO-VC, PJ-NS, PJ-DA, PO needs-supplies <b>fit</b> [PO-NS], PV demands-abilities <b>fit</b> [PV-DA], and general PV <b>fit)</b> best <b>fit</b> the data. Providing ample evidence of construct validity, PO <b>fit</b> perceptions (PO-VC and PO-NS <b>fit)</b> were related to the organization-focused outcome of organizational identification, whereas the profession-focused outcome of occupational commitment was exclusively predicted by PV <b>fit</b> perceptions (PV-DA and general PV <b>fit).</b> As expected, both needs-supplies <b>fit</b> perceptions (PO-NS and PJ-NS <b>fit)</b> predicted intentions to quit and job satisfaction.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this thesis was to {{illuminate}} the concept of <b>fit</b> in cause-related marketing (CRM) by proposing and testing a valenced model for CRM <b>fit.</b> The model was created based on an integration of extant CRM <b>fit</b> literature and theoretical frameworks. It distinguishes three general <b>fit</b> types (positive, neutral, negative) along the two dimensions of commonality and valence. Within the general <b>fit</b> categories, a further classification into nine sub-types of <b>fit</b> was suggested. In two studies it was shown that negative <b>fit,</b> compared to positive and neutral <b>fit,</b> constituted a <b>fit</b> type that was most difficult to interpret and classify {{in that it was}} seen as negative, positive, and also neutral <b>fit.</b> Commonality and valence ratings, together with <b>fit</b> categorizations, suggested a re-ordering of some <b>fit</b> categories, particularly natural theme, prevention, created theme, and general interest <b>fit.</b> In terms of CRM attitudes and purchase intentions, positive <b>fit</b> types were rated most favorable. The negative prevention <b>fit</b> sub-type evoked responses comparable to positive <b>fit</b> sub-types. Generally, negative <b>fit</b> types were regarded as most unfavorable relative to positive <b>fit</b> and neutral <b>fit...</b>|$|R

Such circumstances highlight the importance of further understanding how individuals make employment decisions and assess <b>fit.</b> By surveying 140 applicants who had recently finished the interview process at a large Midwestern hospital, the current study assessed the multidimensionality and predictive power of person-environment <b>fit</b> (person-vocation <b>fit,</b> person-job <b>fit,</b> person-person <b>fit,</b> and person-organization <b>fit).</b> Results suggested that person-environment <b>fit</b> is multi-faceted; <b>fit</b> dimensions simultaneously work together during the pre-hire phase. Specifically, person-person <b>fit,</b> person-organization <b>fit,</b> and person-vocation <b>fit</b> were significant predictors of organizational attraction. Person-person <b>fit</b> and person-job <b>fit</b> significantly predicted intentions to accept an employment offer. In addition, organizational attraction was identified as a partial mediator between overall person-environment <b>fit</b> and job offer acceptance intentions. Such findings contribute to the organization <b>fit</b> literature and provide practitioners with key insights on how applicants assess <b>fit</b> during the pre-employment stage...|$|R
5|$|Harvey {{enlisted in}} the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) at Fitzroy on 12 May 1942 {{and was a member}} of the 30 Squadron. He served as an {{airframe}} <b>fitter</b> during World War II, which severely interrupted his sporting career, and first-class cricket was cancelled after the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor prompted the outbreak of hostilities in the Pacific. He was discharged on 25 January 1946 with the rank of aircraftman. According to cricket administrator Bill Jacobs, the war cost Harvey his prime cricketing years. Jacobs believed that Harvey would have been selected for Australia in the period otherwise interrupted by war.|$|E
5|$|In {{light of}} his {{business}} closure, McAloney was forced to seek alternate employment and he consequently enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force on 1 July 1936. Ranked aircraftman, he completed a fitters course and qualified as an aero <b>fitter</b> and turner before being attached to No.1 Squadron at RAAF Base Laverton, Victoria, in September. He was employed in a maintenance role within the unit, working on the Jupiter Gipsy and Rolls-Royce Kestrel engines of Bristol Bulldog and Hawker Demon aircraft respectively. During 1937, McAloney completed a part-time air gunner course. His first child, a son named William, was born later that year.|$|E
5|$|Merv Harvey {{broke into}} the Victorian state team during the 1940–41 season and played in three {{first-class}} matches. The highlight of {{the first phase of}} his career for Victoria was a rapid 70 in one hour against a New South Wales attack containing Bill O'Reilly, regarded as the best bowler in the world at the time. However, the outbreak of World War II in the Pacific caused the suspension of top-level cricket and halted Harvey’s progress. Harvey then served in the Royal Australian Air Force as an airframe <b>fitter,</b> losing his best cricketing years to the war.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the cost-effectiveness between double and single Fecal Immunochemical Test(s) (<b>FIT)</b> in a mass CRC screening. A two-stage sequential screening was conducted. <b>FIT</b> {{was used as a}} primary screening test and recommended twice by an interval of one week at the first screening stage. We defined the first-time <b>FIT</b> as <b>FIT</b> 1 and the second-time <b>FIT</b> as <b>FIT</b> 2. If either <b>FIT</b> 1 or <b>FIT</b> 2 was positive (+), then a colonoscopy was recommended at the second stage. Costs were recorded and analyzed. A total of 24, 419 participants completed either <b>FIT</b> 1 or <b>FIT</b> 2. The detection rate of advanced neoplasm was 19. 2 % among both <b>FIT</b> 1 + and <b>FIT</b> 2 +, especially high among men with age ≥ 55 (27. 4 %). About 15. 4 % CRC, 18. 9 % advanced neoplasm, and 29. 9 % adenoma missed by <b>FIT</b> 1 were detected by <b>FIT</b> 2 alone. Average cost was $ 2, 935 for double <b>FITs</b> and $ 2, 121 for <b>FIT</b> 1 to detect each CRC and $ 901 for double <b>FITs</b> and $ 680 for <b>FIT</b> 1 to detect each advanced neoplasm.

5|$|When {{multiple}} different alleles for a gene {{are present}} in a species's population it is called polymorphic. Most different alleles are functionally equivalent, however some alleles can give rise to different phenotypic traits. A gene's most common allele is called the wild type, and rare alleles are called mutants. The genetic variation in relative frequencies of different alleles in a population is due to both natural selection and genetic drift. The wild-type allele {{is not necessarily the}} ancestor of less common alleles, nor is it necessarily <b>fitter.</b>|$|E

5|$|When some {{component}} of a trait is heritable, selection alters the frequencies of the different alleles, or variants of the gene that produces the variants of the trait. Selection {{can be divided into}} three classes, {{on the basis of its}} effect on allele frequencies: directional, stabilizing, and purifying selection. Directional selection occurs when an allele has a greater fitness than others, so that it increases in frequency, gaining an increasing share in the population. This process can continue until the allele is fixed and the entire population shares the <b>fitter</b> phenotype. Far more common is stabilizing selection, which lowers the frequency of alleles that have a deleterious effect on the phenotype – that is, produce organisms of lower fitness. This process can continue until the allele is eliminated from the population. Purifying selection conserves functional genetic features, such as protein-coding genes or regulatory sequences, over time by selective pressure against deleterious variants.|$|E
5|$|During the winter, {{they played}} {{baseball}} for the Fitzroy Baseball Club, often competing in matches played as curtain raisers {{to the elite}} Australian rules football competition, the Victorian Football League. In 1948, Harvey was selected at short stop in the 1948 All-Australian baseball team. Saturday night entertainment for the family typically consisted of dinner after the day’s cricket matches for Fitzroy and Plant, Liddicut and other club personnel were often invited. Under the influence of cricketing mentors Plant and Liddicut, the boys were taught to adopt an aggressive approach, using fast feet movement to attack spin bowling in particular. Harvey made his First XI debut for Fitzroy in 1941–42. In 1943–44, he scored a club record of 817 First XI runs in a season. In 1942–43, Neil was promoted to Fitzroy's First XI, joining Merv, Mick and Ray. During that season, the family held down the first four batting positions for Fitzroy; Merv and Mick opened the batting and Ray and Neil came in after them. Ray continued to play for Fitzroy {{over the next two}} decades when he was not required by Victoria. Outside cricket, Harvey was an electrical <b>fitter</b> and he worked for the Metropolitan Tramways Board. He and his wife Lorna and settled in the inner-northern suburb of Reservoir.|$|E
5|$|From {{an early}} age, Hobbs played cricket {{whenever}} he could. His first games were {{played in the}} streets near his house. He was educated at a primary school affiliated with his local Anglican church, St Matthew's, and moved in 1891 to York Street Boys' School, a fee-paying establishment; Hobbs later admitted to being a poor scholar but was successful at sports. He played cricket regularly for the St Matthew's choir team and the York Street school team, and during holidays helped his father at Jesus College. In his final year at York Street, to supplement the family budget, Hobbs took a job working before school hours in the domestic service of a private house. On leaving school in 1895, he worked as an errand boy until his father's connections at the university secured him a summer job as a college servant, chiefly assisting the cricket team. Aged 16, Hobbs became an apprentice gas <b>fitter,</b> and practised cricket on Parker's Piece, an open area of common land in Cambridge, in his spare time. He played for various local clubs but did not initially stand out as a cricketer: although better than most other Cambridge batsmen, no coaches or major teams approached him, and his batting gave little indication of the success which came later.|$|E

5|$|Plant food {{is stored}} year-round, but mainly in autumn. Individual seeds are hidden in cracks in bark, {{occasionally}} in walls {{or in the}} ground. The food item is usually concealed with lichen, moss or small pieces of bark. The cached food is retrieved in cold weather.

Cached food may sometimes include non-plant material such as pieces of bread, caterpillars and grubs, the larvae being incapacitated by battering. Hoarding is a long-term strategy, stored food items only being consumed when fresh food is hard to find, sometimes up to three months after caching. Birds with good stored food supplies are <b>fitter</b> that those with more limited resources. Beech mast crops vary widely from year to year. Where beech mast {{is an important part of}} the diet, adult survival rates are largely unaffected in years with a poor mast crop, but the number of juvenile birds falls in the autumn as they are lost through starvation or emigration. In areas where common hazel is the prevalent tree species, there is a similar pattern of adult survival and loss of juvenile birds in years with poor nut production.|$|E
