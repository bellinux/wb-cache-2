5|$|At first, {{the game}} was titled Parasite, and {{was meant to be}} {{unrelated}} to the Infinity series, but when development began in May 2003, it was codenamed Project Infinity 3. In September of the same year, they added the subtitle The Age of Infinity. Development was troubled by creative differences between Nakazawa and Uchikoshi; Nakazawa was unhappy with Uchikoshi's idea for the game's ending, and had a different ending in mind, which they were having disagreements over. They also did not have the time to write <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had wanted, so they ended up with an ending that Uchikoshi described as only being half-finished. At the time of the game's release, a sequel was planned, which would have included a conclusion to the game's story. In 2013, Uchikoshi looked back on the game, saying that while {{he would have liked to}} rewrite some portions of the scenario that he felt were boring or that did not advance the story much, he would not have changed or added anything in terms of the content of the game; he felt that his ending was still in the story, and still felt happy with it.|$|E
25|$|After 'having {{gotten the}} Jews of Palestine and of {{elsewhere}} to do <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could, personally and financially, to help Yishuv,' Ben-Gurion's second greatest achievement was his having successfully transformed Haganah {{from being a}} clandestine paramilitary organization into a true army. Ben-Gurion appointed Israel Galili {{to the position of}} head of the High Command counsel of Haganah and divided Haganah into 6 infantry brigades, numbered 1 to 6, allotting a precise theatre of operation to each one. Yaakov Dori was named Chief of Staff, but it was Yigael Yadin who assumed the responsibility on the ground as chief of Operations. Palmach, commanded by Yigal Allon, was divided into 3 elite brigades, numbered 10–12, and constituted the mobile force of Haganah. Ben-Gurion's attempts to retain personal control over the newly formed IDF lead later in July to The Generals' Revolt.|$|E

They said the lines...mostly...but they said them all wrong. And they cast it wrong. And they designed it wrong. And they scored it wrong. They did everything wrong that they could possibly do. There's actually a fascinating lesson in filmmaking, because <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> did reflects back to the script or looks like something from the script, and people assume that, if I hated it, then they’d changed the script...but it wasn’t so much that they’d changed the script; it’s that they just executed {{it in such a}} ghastly fashion as to render it almost unwatchable." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Lopez, {{the song}} is about missing someone terribly; [...] "someone who is missing someone so much and has done {{something}} so wrong to the person that they know they can't fix it. So they just hate themselves right in that moment, they can't stand , they regret <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> did and they wish they could change things." [...] James Reed of The Boston Globe noted the chorus of [...] "Me Haces Falta" [...] to be self-loathing, with the lines: [...] "Tú me haces falta/Sí, me arrepiento/Me odio/Estoy desesperada" [...] (English: [...] "I miss you/Yes, I repent/I hate myself/I'm desperate").

[...] Los Angeles Times critic Maragret Wappler deemed it an [...] "ode to breakups" [...] and noted that the protagonist asks her willful boyfriend to remember [...] "the good times" [...] of their relationship. In the chorus, she sings [...] "Don't surrender, surrender, surrender", before asking him to remember their [...] "promise of forever". Lovato explained that the song is about [...] "a girl [...] has so much to say to the guy, and it feels like he's not listening, and she wants him to remember <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had".|$|E
500|$|In December 2014, Jed Whedon {{explained}} {{the benefits of}} introducing a society of superhuman characters in the Inhumans, saying [...] "One of the things that, early on {{was very important to}} us last season was, there were so few people in the Cinematic Universe who had powers. Really, only two humans had powers, Captain America and the Hulk. We had to be very responsible—we didn't want to dive into this show and have a new one every week, and have it feel like we disregarded <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> spent so much money and time building in the films. Along those same lines, the origin of a power is always a complex thing—Marvel cares about it feeling grounded, it feeling scientific at some level. Even on Thor, he says, [...] "In our world, magic and science are the same thing." [...] So this is a way for us to sort of open up our world. It's a way to introduce, into the MCU, the idea that people can be born with a power. They don't have to be engineered in a lab, they don't need to have some freak accident with a vat of acid. They can be born with this. That's sort of a gamechanger, not just on our show, but in the cinematic universe".|$|E

[...] His writings essentially [...] "educated" [...] the one source that he knew would reach the majority of Americans.

[...] While focusing on professional establishments he continued to create personal relationships with American elites such as college professors, scientists, doctors, politicians, etc. His method of establishing personal relationships was a landmark later used in other methods of propaganda, [...] "it was the complete and skillful technique later to be developed by many other propagandists, lobbyists, and public relations council." ...|$|E

Otherwise, Powers had little instruction {{on what to do}} during an interrogation. Although he had been told that he could reveal everything about the aircraft since the Soviets could learn what they wanted from it, Powers did his best to conceal classified information while appearing to cooperate. His trial began on 17 August 1960. Powers—who apologized on advice of his Soviet defense counsel—was sentenced to three years in prison, but on 10 February 1962 the USSR exchanged him and American student Frederic Pryor for Rudolf Abel at Glienicke Bridge between West Berlin and Potsdam, Germany. Two CIA investigations found that Powers had done well during the interrogation and had [...] "complied with his obligations as an American citizen during this period". Although the government was reluctant to reinstate him to the USAF because of its statements that the U-2 program was civilian, it had promised to do so after CIA employment ended. Powers resolved the dilemma by choosing to work for Lockheed as a U-2 pilot.|$|E

2500|$|A Midrash {{asked why}} Moses had to account to the Israelites, seeing as God trusted Moses so implicitly that God said in [...] "My servant Moses is not so; he is trusted in all My house." [...] The Midrash {{explained}} that Moses overheard certain Israelites scoffing behind his back, for [...] says, [...] "And they (the Israelites) looked after Moses." [...] The Midrash {{asked what the}} people would say about Moses. Rabbi Johanan taught that the people blessed his mother, for she never saw him, as he was always speaking with God and always wholly given over to his service. But Rabbi Hama said {{that they used to}} remark how fat and prosperous Moses looked. When Moses heard this, he vowed to give an account of everything. And this is why [...] says, [...] "These are the accounts of the Tabernacle." [...] Reading [...] "as they were rendered according to the commandment of Moses," [...] the Midrash taught that the Israelites did <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> did by the command of Moses. And reading the continuation of [...] "through the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, the son of Aaron the priest," [...] the Midrash taught that everything that Moses made was done through others. Even though everything was done with witnesses, as soon as the construction of the Tabernacle was completed, Moses wasted no time to promise the people the complete details of all the expenditures involved. Moses then began to expound in [...] "These are the accounts of the Tabernacle," [...] saying how much he had expended on the Tabernacle. While engaged in this calculation, Moses completely forgot about 1,775 shekalim of silver that he had used for hooks for the pillars, and he became uneasy thinking to himself that the Israelites would find grounds to say that Moses took them for himself. So God opened the eyes of Moses to realize that the silver had been converted into hooks for the pillars. When the Israelites saw that the account now completely tallied, they were completely satisfied with the integrity of the work on the Tabernacle. And thus [...] says, [...] "These are the accounts of the Tabernacle," [...] to report that the accounts balanced.|$|E
