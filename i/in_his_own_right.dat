50|$|In 1601 Peersson left Sweden for a {{four-year}} reconnaissance tour of Muscovy {{in the guise}} of a doctor. His dispatches to the court were reproduced by Jacques Auguste de Thou <b>in</b> <b>his</b> Historiarum sui temporis. Back in Sweden, Peersson compiled his dispatches into a Fair and true relation on recent Russian past from Ivan Grozny to the ascension of Vasily Shuysky. The book was based exclusively on Peersson's own experience and on the oral narratives by contemporary Russians (Vasily Shuysky, Maria Nagaya and the retinue of False Dmitriy I) and Western witnesses (Caspar Fiedler, Conrad Bussow). Peersson in real life tracked Bussow's activity with suspicion and recovered evidence of Bussow's treason that resulted in the defection of Swedish garrison <b>in</b> Narva (<b>his</b> allegations are contested by modern authors, e.g. Orchard). Persson obtained the manuscript of Bussow's The Disturbed State of the Russian Realm (the first, 1614, version) and reused it <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> later works. Historians of the first half of 19th century incorrectly considered Peersson the primary source for Bussow's book until Arist Kunik (1849) and Sergey Solovyov (1858) restored Bussow <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>rights.</b>|$|R

Take care, gentlemen!" [...] The other disembarked passengers either climbed back into their seats, or stepped over the northern line and {{completely out of the}} way. A third option was available, to stand with your back to the stationary coaches, as there was a four-foot gap between the lines, and even though the Duke's private carriage was wider that then standard carriage, it would have still been possible to stand between the stationary and the travelling train and remain safe. However, what unfolded was a calamitous series of events. Huskisson was known to be clumsy. He had endured a long list of problems from his regular trips and falls, and he had twice broken his arm and never fully recovered the use of it. Add to this, that he was only a few weeks post surgery and was there against his doctor's advice.|$|R

Spain's original intent was to be predominantly a cuemaker <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>right</b> using his proprietary spliced blanks.

John A. Logan of Illinois hoped to attract Stalwart votes if Arthur’s campaign was unsuccessful. Blaine was unsure he wanted to try for the nomination for the third time and even encouraged General William T.

5|$|Lincoln ran for {{election}} as governor <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>right</b> in 1809, {{but he was}} perceived by moderate Federalists as overly partisan and lacked the charisma of Sullivan. His support for Jefferson's economic policy, particularly that of embargoing trade with Great Britain and France (who were then embroiled in the Napoleonic Wars) was costly. Federalists, who had regained control of the Massachusetts legislature in 1808, attacked his statements in support of Jefferson, and he lost the election to Christopher Gore, amid a complete Federalist takeover of the Massachusetts government (the outgoing Jefferson administration's repeal of the embargo before the election notwithstanding).|$|E

He produced salted meat and acquired landholdings in the process. As the years passed he became an estanciero (rancher) <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>right,</b> accumulating land while establishing a successful partnership with second cousins from the politically powerful Anchorena clan.
