50|$|This forms a {{positive}} feedback loop, {{where a small}} trigger impulse <b>degating</b> NMDA from Mg2+ pore blockade results in calcium influx, this calcium influx then triggers trafficking of GluR1-containing(Ca2+ permeable) subunits to the PSD, such trafficking of GluR1-positive AMPA to the postsynaptic neuron allows for upmodulation of the postsynaptic neuron's calcium influx in response to presynaptic calcium influx. Robust negative feedback at NMDA from kyenurenic acid, magnesium, zinc, and agmatine prevents runaway feedback.|$|E
50|$|<b>Degating</b> is {{the removal}} of the heads, runners, gates, and risers from the casting. Runners, gates, and risers may be removed using cutting torches, bandsaws, or ceramic cutoff blades. For some metal types, and with some gating system designs, the sprue, runners, and gates can be removed by {{breaking}} them away from the casting with a sledge hammer or specially designed knockout machinery. Risers must usually be removed using a cutting method (see above) but some newer methods of riser removal use knockoff machinery with special designs incorporated into the riser neck geometry that allow the riser to break off at the right place.|$|E
50|$|After <b>degating</b> {{and heat}} treating, sand or other molding media may remain {{adhered to the}} casting. To remove any mold remnants, the surface is cleaned using a {{blasting}} process. This means a granular media will be propelled against {{the surface of the}} casting to mechanically knock away the adhering sand. The media may be blown with compressed air, or may be hurled using a shot wheel. The cleaning media strikes the casting surface at high velocity to dislodge the mold remnants (for example, sand, slag) from the casting surface. Numerous materials may be used to clean cast surfaces, including steel, iron, other metal alloys, aluminium oxides, glass beads, walnut shells, baking powder, and many others. The blasting media is selected to develop the color and reflectance of the cast surface. Terms used to describe this process include cleaning, bead blasting, and sand blasting. Shot peening may be used to further work-harden and finish the surface.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In the {{electronics}} packaging industry, Epoxy Mold Compound (EMC) polymer matrix {{is filled with}} fused silica (SiO 2) to obtain the required roughness and hardness. Gate chip off, which occurs during the <b>degating</b> process in transfer molding {{is one of the}} common defects which contributes to the failure in the proper functioning of the package. During the <b>degating</b> process, surface contact between two solid bodies (<b>degating</b> blade and gate) generate a high shear stress on package, thus creating a high potential for the incidence of gate chip of. In this study, the influence of transfer molding parameters and size of fillers (normal and fine) on the gate chip off were investigated. The application of Design of Experiments (DOE) using regression model and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) showed that molding parameters do not significantly influence the incidence of gate chip off. Numerical simulation was used to investigate effect of two filler sizes and molding parameters on the mold fill time, end pressure of fill and shear stress at the wall. The results showed there were no significant influences on mold fill time but the fine filler showed lower pressure at the end of fill and lower shear stress at the wall. Experimental results of two sizes if filler shown that fine filler mold compound exhibited in reduction of gate chip off formation, compared to normal filler mold compound. Smooth surface of fine mold compound lead to decrease of friction shear stress during <b>degating</b> is expected contribute to this finding...|$|E
40|$|From the introduction] {{his policy}} brief {{argues that the}} {{decentralisation}} of Serbia by <b>degating</b> more authority to municipalities could benefit minority groups that constitute a local majority. Although there are three such minority communities living in Serbia, the Bosniaks in Sandzak, the Albanians in Presevo Valley and the Hungarians in Vojvodina, the paper focuses {{on the first two}} groups, because their problems could potentially destabilise Serbia and the wider region. Thus, addressing the root causes of tensions in these two regions is an urgent task. Moreover, not only would minorities gain from sound decentralisation – all municipalities would do so regardless of ethnicity. Ultimately, decentralisation would be an essential step in Serbia’s democratisation process, following the example of other Central and East European countries...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Due {{to heavy}} demand in plastic products, plastic {{industries}} are emergent in a fastest rate. Plastic injection molding begins with mould making and in manufacturing of complex shapes; the optimum gate location {{is one of}} the most important criterions in mould design. Mould Flow analysis is a powerful simulation tool to optimize the gate location and to predict the Production time required at the lowest possible cost. Optimization of sequence occasion, keep away from scrap and manual interface plays a vital role in manufacturing of plastic parts to improve the productivity of the process and at the time it should not affect the quality of the final product.
