5|$|Brodie was {{a native}} of Chicago, the son of Latvian Jewish {{immigrants}} who was alienated from both his family and his family's religion.

The McKays were horrified at their daughter's impending marriage; Dilworth Jensen felt betrayed. David O. McKay went to Chicago to warn his niece of the family's strong objections.

5|$|Initially, {{the rulers}} of Europe, such as Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, viewed the {{revolution}} in France as an event between the French king and his subjects, and not something in which they should interfere.

5|$|Keynes's {{economic}} thinking only {{began to}} achieve close to universal acceptance {{in the last}} few years of his life. On a personal level, Keynes's charm was such that he was generally well received wherever he went – even those who found themselves on the wrong side of his occasionally sharp tongue rarely bore a grudge. Keynes's speech at the closing of the Bretton Woods negotiations was received with a lasting standing ovation, rare <b>in</b> <b>international</b> <b>relations,</b> as the delegates acknowledged the scale of his achievements made despite poor health.|$|E

5|$|Stratton {{served in}} the Army during World War I, {{developing}} psychological tests to select airmen for Army aviation. Exposure {{to the war effort}} prompted his interest <b>in</b> <b>international</b> <b>relations</b> and causes of wars. He was an anti-war believer who held psychology should aim to assist humanity's quest to avert future wars. He was optimistic that people and ethnicities, making up nations, could be taught to live in peace, though the races were not equal in inborn mental capacity, a belief he held as scientific. In the later part of his career he wrote books looking at international relations, war, and the differences between races on emotions. He was also a scholar of the classics and translated Greek philosophers.|$|E
