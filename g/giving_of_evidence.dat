It would surely be absurd to argue that because a person has a deed executed upon her she was, ipso facto, incapacitated from giving evidence concerning it, on the mere ground that she was it. Further, such a decision would be contrary to equity and good policy, for persons could not so lightly be deprived of their natural rights. Also, in this case, the plaintiff's action would be absolutely put an end to by any such decision, seeing that the signature of Jonathan Meeson and the attesting witnesses to the will could not, of course, be recognised in their tattooed form, and there is no other living person who could depose under what circumstances the signature came to be there.

50|$|The {{fundamental}} principle {{is that a}} witness shall give in evidence the whole truth that he knows concerning the matter in dispute and that {{the parties to the}} dispute are entitled to have that evidence given. The rules which regulate and which, in certain exceptional cases, restrict the <b>giving</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> are the growth of practice and of the rulings of judges, occurring mainly within the last two to three centuries (see the judgment of Parke B in the case of The Queen v. Ryle, 9 M. & W., 244). The rule of Public Interest Immunity which excludes evidence, the requiring of which would be contrary to public policy, as may occur in relation to the conduct of the business of a state department, is an instance. In view of the absolute repudiation by the state of the jurisdiction of the Catholic Church and in view of the abandonment of the sacrament of confession as practised before the Reformation, one may fairly presume that, from the date of that event, confession would no longer have been regarded as a ground from motives of public policy, entitling to an exemption from the principle of the disclosure of all the truth known about the cause, were it to be civil or criminal.|$|E
50|$|The {{second case}} is one which {{occurred}} after the Reformation. It is {{the trial of}} the Jesuit, Fr. Henry Garnet, on the charge of conspiracy in the Gunpowder Plot. It is reported in the records of the state trials. There is not only no mention of any decision by the court that the privilege of confession did not extend to the concealment of high treason, but there is not even the faintest indication of any opinion to that effect by any member of the court. There was no question of the <b>giving</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> by a witness before a court of justice of matter revealed to him in confession. The issue being whether Fr. Garnet was a party to the conspiracy, the question of his cognizance and, if cognizant, of his non-disclosure of it was essential. It was not disputed that he had heard the particulars of the plot from Greenwell, one of the conspirators, but the defence was that he had heard them only in confession, though he had previously received a general indication of the plot from another of the conspirators, Catesby. Not only was the defence not rejected at once by the court as being had in law, but, to infer from the arguments put to the prisoner upon it by certain members of the court, it was treated with a seriousness which seems surprising in a post-Reformation period, and, especially, at a moment of such strong anti-Catholic feeling.|$|E

40|$|The Independent Panel Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse {{was left}} in crisis {{following}} intense pressure from survivors and their families, the public and media. Two senior legal figures, Baroness Butler-Sloss and Fiona Woolf, both resigned from the position of chair to the inquiry following concerns over their links with the establishment. Questions were raised over the independence of a process convened by the Home Secretary, to investigate apparent failures {{on the part of}} institutions, which would include scrutinising the actions of a former Home Secretary in handling allegations of child sexual abuse in the past. Demands for an inquiry with greater statutory powers, including the power to compel the <b>giving</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> on oath, ultimately resulted in the Independent Panel being disbanded and a new public inquiry, the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse, being convened. Against the background of this and other inquiries, this article examines the serious questions raised about the powers of a minister to set up a public inquiry, the lack of open and transparent decision-making processes {{and the extent to which}} those ministerial decisions are open to public scrutiny and accountability...|$|E
40|$|This article {{reviews the}} primary claims made for {{restorative}} justice {{as a response}} to offending. It summarizes Home Office research published in 2001 which evaluated seven restorative justice schemes operating in England during the 1990 s. The narrative sets the recent resurgence of interest in the potential of restorative justice within Great Britain in a wider context of successive state responses to victimization. The article highlights recent national and European initiatives and links the findings of the Home Office research to evaluations of other schemes in England and Scotland. It addresses basic questions concerning the proper measure for the evaluation of the success or otherwise of restorative justice schemes, and draws attention to the recommendations of the Review of the Criminal Justice System, {{that there should be a}} national strategy for the implementation of restorative justice initiatives. Key Words English and Scottish criminal justice • programme evaluation • restorative justice • victims of crime CONTEXT: VICTIMS AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE SERVICES The massive changes that have taken place over the past 30 years or so in the relation-ship between victims of crime and the criminal justice system are well documented (for an overview, see Sanders, 1999; Zedner, 2002). That relationship casts the victim variously as a supplier of information, the beneficiary of state-funded compensation and other remedial arrangements concerning such matters as the <b>giving</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> (Miers, 1997; McEwan, 2002), and a partner in crime prevention. These changes also imply an increasing degree of inclusiveness in which victims have, in a further extension of the marketplace analysis of the criminal justice system (Raine and Wilson, 1998), become consumers of its services. Many of the initiatives that were repackaged as the Victim’...|$|E
40|$|In {{the wake}} of the September 11 attacks, it must be confessed that I was quite {{overwhelmed}} by the horrific events, by the loss of life, and by the sheer visual impact and magnitude of the attacks against the World Trade Centre and Pentagon. Overwhelmed {{but at the same time}} eager, not in any morbid sense, to learn more about terrorism. September 11 also created significant media and public interest. Having entered academia a year earlier, after some years in private practice, and as the only international lawyer at the University of Canterbury, I responded by writing on the subject. Soon enough, that research and writing led to this thesis. As a full-time lecturer at the University of Canterbury, a part-time Barrister of the High Court of New Zealand, and a part-time PhD candidate, the progress and methodology in the writing of this thesis has been somewhat haphazard at times. The first two years of research were perhaps not typical of postgraduate research. That period of time was characterised by three types of activity: the collation of materials, from treaties to articles and cases; the writing of papers and articles on particular issues involved within the thesis topic; and the presentation of papers or other oral discussions and debate, including the <b>giving</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee on the Counter-Terrorism Bill 2002. In July 2004 I was fortunate enough to take up a research fellowship at the Centre for International and Public Law at the Australian National University, working with those involved in the Australian Research Council funded project on Terrorism and the Non-State Actor. With that work, this period was an opportunity to almost entirely dedicate time to the writing of the thesis proper. That period saw the further development of a number of ideas and the writing of four significant chapters and the near completion of a fifth chapter. Since returning to New Zealand from the fellowship in early December 2004, the preponderance of my time was again devoted to the writing and completion of the thesis. Thus it might be said that a little over two years of research was sporadic and characterised by the research and consideration of isolated issues, while the balance of time consisted of a much more concentrated period of writing and review. When first embarking upon this research, I was warned by colleagues that this would be akin to running a marathon, and it certainly has felt so at times. However, although the run has been a solo one, there are many I am grateful to for their roadside support. To my mother, for her unfailing faith, encouragement and pride. To my supervisors, Professor Chris Joyner at the Department of Government, Georgetown University, Washington DC, and Professors John Burrows and Scott Davidson at the School of Law, University of Canterbury, New Zealand. Professor Burrows' quiet, thoughtful, honest and generous oversight has meant a great deal to me, as did the generous input of Professor Davidson. I must likewise thank my colleagues, particularly those of the International Law Group at the University of Canterbury and the Centre for International and Public Law at the Australian National University, especially Dr Neil Boister, Professor Andrew Byrnes, John Caldwell, Associated Professor Pene Matthew, and Barbara von Tigerstrom...|$|E

40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{comparing}} the legal recognition of electronic signatures in Norway and the European Union. For the European Union the legal recognition of electronic signatures is regulated in Art. 5 Electronic Signatures Directive (ESD), Norway regulated the legal recognition of electronic signatures in Section 6 Electronic Signatures Act (ESA). This thesis asks the question if the Section 6 Norwegian ESA implements Art. 5 ESD correctly {{because there are}} some differences between Section 6 ESA and Art. 5 ESD. They will be discussed in this thesis under the focus of whether Section 6 ESA complies with Art. 5 ESD or not. Both regulation are compared by their legal and technological requirements. To discuss the implementation thorough not only the two regulations have to be compared because some requirements of both regulations are defined in other regulations. In the first four chapters the very similar requirements for both laws will be described and compared. Beneath a general chapter the technological requirements of Art. 5 I ESD and Section 6 ESA will be discussed in one chapter. Although some of these requirements such as advanced electronic signatures, qualified certificates, certification service providers and secure-signature-creation devices are regulated in other provisions, it is necessary to compare them as well. If they do not resemble the technical background Art. 5 ESD and Section 6 ESA will not comply with each other. This can result in different sorts of electronic signatures Art. 5 ESD and Section 6 ESA affect. Then the consequences of the Norwegian implementation will be discussed under the focus of the EFTA-Court legislation. Because of some legislation of the EFTA-Court is based on decisions of the ECJ, the necessary ECJ-decisions will be discussed as well. Both laws take a so-called two-tier approach where a so-called minimalist approach and a so-called prescriptive approach are combined. The minimalist approach give a minimum legal recognition to a form of electronic signatures and the prescriptive approach describes the functions of a certain technology. The differences between both Regulations are sometimes obvious, seem sometimes obvious or are hidden. The most obvious difference is that Art. 5 II ESD and Section 6 Sentence 2 ESA seem to be two different regulations. The first is a non-discrimination rule and the second is a broad guideline what legal recognition an electronic signature according to the definitions in Art. 2 a) ESD and Art. 3 1. ESA. Although the Norwegian law implements the non-discrimination rule by using general principles of law. For example hinders the principle of free <b>giving</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> that an electronic signature is not admissible as evidence. But the principle of free consideration of evidence do not hinder that a judge denies a legal effect to an electronic signature with the general argumentation that the electronic signature is electronic or does not fulfil the requirements of a qualified signature. The non-implementation of letter l) Annex II ESD is more difficult to find, but it changes the requirements towards the technology and is therefore not complying with European Law. The consequences for the incorrect implementation has {{to be based on the}} judgements of the EFTA-Court. The EFTA-Court has developed a state liablility based on the EEA-Agreement and takes over the requirements the ECJ has developed for state liability. According to these requirements the incorrect implementation must the Directive aim to give a subject individual rights, there is an incorrect implementation which is sufficient serious and the breach of EU/EEA Law causes a loss of an action. The Directive gives a subject an individual right to use an electronic signature to gain a certain legal effect. The incorrect implemention is sufficiently serious because the possibility to reject a legal effect to an electronic signature build different requirements towards the legal recognition of electronic signatures. This hinders the establishment of an internal market. The third requirement is not fulfilled yet and therefore the Norwegian State will not be hold liable for that incorrect implementation...|$|E
