5000|$|The {{station was}} {{automated}} on 7 January 1959 and the dioptric lens with its revolving machine and vaporised paraffin <b>incandescent</b> <b>burner</b> {{were replaced by}} a new fourth order cylindric refractor lens. Its mantle light source used dissolved acetylene from a battery of cylinders giving a candlepower of 2,600 white light and 500 in the red sector. This appeared to be worse than the old light and mariners using the harbour complained about the new lens.|$|E
60|$|The {{past and}} present {{servants}} of the Grosvenor Square household would all have to pass before the coroner {{during the course of}} this long afternoon. It was only two o'clock and already the gas had to be lighted--two <b>incandescent</b> <b>burners</b> just above the coroner's table--hard, uncompromising lights, that threw a sickly green tinge on every face and cast deep black shadows under every eye.|$|R
5000|$|The Druitt Street {{entrance}} {{was opened}} by the Lady Mayoress using a commemorative solid gold key on {{which was a}} model of the main dome and the smaller cupolas, [...] "worth a good deal more than Â£50", made by Fairfax and Roberts and presented by the Phippard Brothers. The building was illuminated by about 1000 Welsbach <b>incandescent</b> <b>burners,</b> equal in lighting power to about 70,000 candles, producing [...] "floods of light" [...] that even in the basement was judged to be [...] "perfect".|$|R
50|$|In 1893, Slattery {{installed}} {{gas lighting}} fixtures with <b>incandescent</b> <b>burners</b> {{into the study}} halls, almost one year before these became available in Australia. In 1895, the college acquired a gasoline powered engine, a six-inch (15 cm) sparking coil and two Crookes tubes. That same year the school upgraded to an oil powered engine, dynamo and storage batteries that supplied electric light to the science halls. At the time {{this was the only}} electric light in Bathurst. Next Slattery built an acetylene gas powered generator to provide stage lighting for the college theater. At this time he developed an early interest in color photography.|$|R
50|$|The {{light was}} {{upgraded}} once in 1910 to an intensity of 250,000 cd, with {{the installation of}} a Douglas <b>incandescent</b> kerosene <b>burner,</b> and a second time in 1923 to an intensity of 357,000 cd.|$|R
5|$|Europa Lighthouse {{was inaugurated}} on 1 August 1841 {{in a brief}} {{ceremony}} witnessed by about 10,000 people. The first upgrade of the lighthouse occurred in 1864, when the single-wick lamp was replaced with a Chance Brothers four-wick burner, with further changes in 1875 and in 1894 when the amount of light emitted was increased. A three <b>incandescent</b> mantle <b>burner</b> was added in 1905. Following further modernisation in the 20th century, the lighthouse was fully automated in 1994.|$|R
5|$|In 1894, the {{lighthouse}} was further altered {{to increase the}} amount of light emitted. The four-wick burner and mirrors were exchanged for a Douglass burner with eight wicks and an improved lantern; the power of the light was increased to 35,000 candela. The characteristic of the light changed from fixed to occulting. A foghorn was also installed, with two quick blasts every five minutes. The eight-wick burner was exchanged for a three <b>incandescent</b> mantle <b>burner</b> in 1905. In 1923, the burner was replaced by a Hood petroleum vapour burner with one mantle.|$|R
25|$|The burners for {{the lights}} were changed from colza oil to {{paraffin}} oil in 1876. The original system was in use for 60 years, and in 1925, the optical apparatus was upgraded to a second order dioptric lens with an <b>incandescent</b> oil <b>burner.</b> This changed the light output to three flashes in quick succession every 30 seconds. A diesel electric plant was installed in 1954, and electrical operation of the beam started in October of that year. The diesel generator was replaced in 1970. In September 1999, the light was replaced again, {{this time with a}} rotating beacon, with a 35-watt halogen bulb as the light source. The energy comes from solar panels and a battery bank.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the year}} ended June 1908 the wick burners were {{replaced}} by a Chance <b>incandescent</b> petroleum vapour <b>burner</b> and the light output was increased from 45,000 to 200,000 candle power. This was increased to 327,000 candles in February 1927 and the current mercury float pedestal and clockwork (now electrified) mechanism was installed in March 1929. [...] At the same time, the light characteristic was changed to a 0.4 second flash with a 4.6 second eclipse. The revolution time was thus 40 seconds.|$|R
50|$|Henry Thomas Knott (born 1851) {{worked through}} the {{replacement}} of colza oil by paraffin and the consequent replacement of old Argand burners with lamps having multiple wicks and then the even brighter <b>incandescent</b> oil <b>burner</b> which converted liquid oil into vapour before combustion. The life of a lighthouse keeper was a dangerous one. Whilst painting {{the roof of the}} Skerries lighthouse, Henry slipped on wet paint and almost somersaulted off the roof onto the rocks some 25 metres (80 feet) below. He managed to save himself when his clothing became hooked onto an iron stay. On another occasion, Henry bravely carried out the rescue of the crew of a small vessel, even though his small rowing boat was in constant danger of itself being smashed onto the rocks. Henry served out many appointments, one of which was a three-year overseas appointment in the extremely remote lighthouse on Minicoy Island in the Indian Ocean.|$|R
