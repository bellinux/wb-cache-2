40|$|ABSTRACT To {{facilitate}} {{the selection of}} samples for 14 C <b>dating,</b> <b>shells</b> from coastal deposits were analyzed by light microscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and isotope analysis. One {{or more of these}} techniques made it possible to detect contamination by old and young carbon and to identify appropriate pretreatment procedures. Microscopic inspection and X-ray analysis are especially useful when applied to aragonitic mollusks as contamination is often calcitic and thus readily detected. Death assemblages, when correctly selected, provide reliable ages for coastal deposits, but in certain circumstances dates determined on these assemblages were found to be superior to dates for tracing shorelines...|$|R

40|$|First {{excavated}} in 1938, {{the site}} of Muscupiabit (CA-SBR- 425 /H) {{has long been a}} subject of archaeological research in the San Bernardino Mountains. Previous excavations at the site have either been unpublished or limited in scope. A primary goal was to obtain a radiocarbon date for the site, giving a definitive age to the site. Other goals included determining the population size of Muscupiabit as well as the function of the site and its place in the Serrano settlement system. To obtain dateable material, an excavation was conducted in hopes of locating a thermal feature. An intact thermal feature was found and charcoal was recovered. In order to adequately address the proposed research questions, museum collections were used to gain a larger sample size. A large quantity of artifacts had been excavated in the 1980 s but were never analyzed. Between those excavations and the 2017 excavations, 7 units were analyzed. Additionally, population records from the Spanish mission system were analyzed to address research questions about population size. Based on a radiocarbon <b>date,</b> <b>shell</b> bead types, and population records, it appears that Muscupiabit was occupied in the late 17 th/early 18 th century and was likely abandoned by 1815. Despite its location along a trade route, the site {{does not appear to have}} been controlling trade. Muscupiabit was intermarried with other villages but it’s level of political independence cannot be determined at this time...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The present work {{discusses}} and reinterprets paleo-sea level indicators used {{to build}} Holocene sea-level curve for the coast of Rio de Janeiro at former works. We conclude that: (a) the paleo-sea levels inferred by vermetid remains show that sea-level has fallen over the past 4400 years, at least; (b) the paleo-sea level inferred by the beachrock facies and <b>dated</b> <b>shells</b> of Jaconé shows that sea-level was near the present elevation between 8198 and 5786 years before present; and (c) several shells from other beachrocks were deposited probably thousands of years after the specimens died and consequently do not allow precise reconstructions of paleo-sea levels. These conclusions differ from the conclusions of the original paper...|$|R
40|$|Archaeologists {{interested}} in radiocarbon <b>dating</b> <b>shell</b> midden sites express concern regarding {{the accuracy of}} <b>shell</b> <b>dates</b> and how such determinations should be interpreted. This article discusses the problem of <b>dating</b> <b>shells</b> from sites in the southeastern United States. New results are presented comparing shell, bone, and soil-charcoal age determinations from the Crystal River site, located along the west-central Gulf Coast of Florida. Crystal River is a large multimound site whose occupants engaged in long-distance exchange throughout eastern North America during the Woodland period (~ 1000 BC to AD 1050). In the summer of 2012, test units were excavated in several contexts at the site, including both mounds and occupation areas. Samples were collected for 14 C dating, which were then processed at the University of Georgia Center for Applied Isotope Studies. This article focuses on samples from the stratified shell midden, from which it was hoped to construct a local correction for marine shell {{that could be used}} to date other contexts. The soil-charcoal and bone collagen from these samples have very similar ages (bone samples ranging from about 100 cal BC to cal AD 530 and soil-charcoal from cal AD 345 to 560); however, the shell samples collected from the same stratigraphic units are significantly older than the terrestrial dates (ranging from 1300 to 390 cal BC). The difference in calibrated ages between organic materials and the shells ranges between 560 to 1140 yr. This phenomenon cannot be explained solely by the marine reservoir effect. It appears that all the shell samples formed in mixed marine (~ 50 − 60 %) contexts, as indicated by the stable isotope ratios and the amount of atmospheric carbon remaining in the samples. The age of the shell samples cannot be used to date archaeological events as they are influenced not only by the marine reservoir effect, but also the local hardwater effect, which makes them significantly older...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAlong the Chilean coast, peninsulas {{associated}} with bays seem {{to behave as}} a complex system. They act as barrier to propagation of megathrust earthquakes along strike. To better understand how such a system works from ocean side to more inland, we investigated the area between the Tongoy bay and the Altos de Talinay in northern Chile (∼ 30 °S). It represents a forearc peninsula-bay system in which a normal fault (Puerto Aldea fault) {{has been described as}} accommodating a relative vertical motion between the two parts, the peninsula being uplifted with respect to the bay. We <b>dated</b> <b>shells</b> from beach ridges by U-Th disequilibria in order to compare the bay area to the peninsula area for which 10 Be dating of wave-cut platforms are available (Saillard et al., 2009). These indicate: (1) the Puerto Aldea fault activity probably ceased since at least ∼ 230 ka, implying the bay and peninsula parts are evolving together since then; (2) the uplift rate is variable and has decreased from ∼ 0. 8 m/ka to ∼ 0. 2 m/ka between ∼ 300 and 100 ka...|$|R

The top 20 cm of sediment contain a distinct, essentially modern assemblage. Shells recovered at depths from 25 to 125 cm are age-homogeneous and significantly older than the surface layer. Taxon age distributions within sedimentary layers indicate that the top 125 cm of lagoonal sediment is thoroughly mixed on a sub-century scale. The age distributions and shell half-lives of four taxa (Ethalia, Natica, Tellina and Turbo) {{are found to be}} largely distinct. Shell half-lives do not coincide with any single morphological characteristic thought to infer greater durability, but they are strongly related to a combined taphonomic score based on shell density, thickness, and shape.

40|$|Claims for mid-Holocene Aboriginal {{occupation}} at {{the shell}} matrix site of Wurdukanhan, Mornington Island, Gulf of Carpentaria, Australia, are reassessed through {{an analysis of the}} excavated assemblage coupled with new surveys and an extensive dating program. Memmott et al. (2006, pp. 38, 39) reported basal ages of c. 5000 – 5500 years from Wurdukanhan as 'the oldest date yet obtained for any archaeological site on the coast of the southern Gulf of Carpentaria' and used these dates to argue for 'a relatively lengthy occupation since at least the mid-Holocene'. If substantiated, with the exception of western Torres Strait, these claims make Mornington Island the only offshore island used across northern Australia in the mid-Holocene where it is conventionally thought that Aboriginal people only (re) colonised islands after sea-level maximum was achieved after the mid-Holocene. Our analysis of Wurdukanhan demonstrates high shellfish taxa diversity, high rates of natural shell predation and high densities of foraminifera throughout the deposit demonstrating a natural origin for the assemblage.

40|$|Waxing and waning ice {{sheets and}} {{changing}} sea levels have been interpreted from the Quaternary stratigraphic record at Leinstranda, Broggerhalvoya in NW Svalbard. We have identified seven high relative sea-level events, related to glacio-isostatic loading, and separated {{by at least}} four glacial events. To establish a chronology for the high sea-level events (interstadials and interglacials) and the intervening glaciations, we have used three different absolute dating methods: optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) of shallow marine deposits, and electron spin resonance (ESR) and radiocarbon (AMS-C- 14) dating of fossils contained in these sediments. Of the absolute dating methods, OSL has provided the stratigraphically most consistent dataset and which also matches a biostratigraphically inferred interglacial. The ESR ages of mollusc shells suffer from low precision due to unusually large uranium content in most <b>dated</b> <b>shell</b> samples, {{which in turn is}} most likely a result of significant recent uranium enrichment of the sediments. Most radiocarbon ages are non-finite. The results show that the high relative sea-level events range in age from the Saalian sensu lato (>= Marine Isotope Stage, MIS, 6) to the early Holocene (MIS 1), and include events OSL-dated to 185 +/- 8 ka, 129 +/- 10 ka, 99 +/- 8 ka and 36 +/- 3 ka.
