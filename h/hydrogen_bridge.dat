50|$|While {{they are}} {{reactive}} intermediates, hydrogen bridged cations can be stabilized sterically. Hydrogen bridged cations are generally formed by producing a carbocation through {{the addition of}} a proton to an alcohol or alkene. Instead of continuing the reaction through the nucleophile addition of the conjugate base to the carbocation, a neighboring C-H bond can interact with the carbocation to form the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bridge.</b> In Sorensen's 1978 synthesis and observation of the 1,6-dimethyl-1-cyclododecyl anion, the hydroxyl group of 1,6-dimethyl-1-cyclodecanol was removed using fluorosulfonic acid. This allowed the formation of the 1,6 <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bridge.</b> With McMurry's in-bicyclo4.4.4-tetradecyl cation, the alkene across from the methyne hydrogen was protonated by trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to allow a bridge to the tertiary carbocation bridgehead.|$|E
50|$|Compared to non-hydroxylated {{carboxylic}} acids, {{this group}} of acids is stronger, although less strong than the alpha hydroxy acids.

50|$|A hydrogen-bridged cation was {{proposed}} {{to be responsible}} for this isomerization (Scheme 5). In 1996, Gauld modeled the potential energy surfaces of this reaction using water as a spectator molecule and as a mode of proton transport. This study determined that a transition state in the mechanism of water as a spectator ion (no <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bridge)</b> posed an energy barrier of 115 kJ•mol−1 (higher than that for spontaneous isomerization). Water-mediated isomerization was modeled with a 3- and a 5-membered transition state hydrogen-bridged cation. These models only posed energy barriers of 12.3 and 8.5 kJ•mol−1, respectively (Scheme 6). Since a spectator-water model resulted in a higher energy barrier, it was established that the PTC mechanism proposed by Audier and Mourgues with hydrogen-bridged cations is energetically plausible, thus supporting the existence of a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bridge.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{borohydride}} anion has a tetrahedral {{structure with}} boron {{in the center}} and the hydrogens located at the four vertices of the tetrahedron. In metal complexes, the borohydride ion is bound to the metal by means of bridging hydrogen atoms, usually in one of three different ways: monodentate (one <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bridge),</b> bidentate (two hydrogen bridges), and tridentate (three hydrogen bridges) (η1, η2, or η3). The preferred coordination mode is strongly affected {{by the nature of the}} metal and its oxidation state.|$|E
50|$|Hydrogen-bridged cations {{have been}} implicated in the transannular {{migration}} of hydrogens. It has been noticed that the transannular rearrangement in the reaction between an acid and a cycloalkene always results in cis addition of the nucleophile. Presumably, the stereoselectivity {{of this type of}} reaction comes from a nucleophilic attack on a hydrogen-bridged cation (Scheme 1). In this model, the electron cloud of the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bridge</b> prevents the nucleophile from having accessibility to that side of the molecule, thus forcing it to attack from a cis orientation with respect to the initial proton.|$|E
40|$|Ab initio {{calculations}} {{have been}} performed on five singlet and five triplet isomers which are minima on the two lowest potential energy surfaces of Ti 2 H 6. We have used single-configuration ROHF as well as multiconfigurational methods, employing triple-ζ with polarization basis sets. Dynamic correlation effects are accounted for using second-order perturbation methods. Staggered and eclipsed C 3 v triple <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bridged</b> structures, which have been studied previously using single-determinant closed-shell reference wave functions, are shown to require a more sophisticated treatment. The remaining isomersCs triple <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bridged,</b> D 2 h double <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bridged,</b> and D 4 h quadruple hydrogen bridgedhave not previously been considered. The triplets are by definition diradical, and the singlets are found to possess largely diradical character.

It is found to be antiferromagnetic with a calculated isotropic exchange interaction of J = − 250 cm- 1 (singlet−triplet gap of 1. 43 kcal/mol). All Ti 2 H 6 isomers are predicted to be lower in energy than the separated monomers:[*] 2 TiH 3.

50|$|While {{supposedly}} less favored energetically, the steric {{properties of}} some molecules promote {{the formation of}} open C-H-C bridges, as shown below in Scheme 2. In 1978 T.S. Sorenson obtained NMR evidence for hydrido-bridged carbocations with 3-center 2-electron bonds through using the 1,6-dimethyl-1-cyclodecyl cation. The steric restriction of the ten-membered ring allowed {{the formation of a}} bridging hydrogen species. Expanding upon this approach, in 1992 McMurry developed the in-bicyclo4,4,4-1-tetradecyl cation, where the additional ring vastly improved the stability of the molecule by maintain a more rigid structure around the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bridge.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Methyldiborane, CH3B2H5, or monomethyldiborane is the {{simplest}} alkyldiborane, {{consisting of a}} methyl group substituted for a hydrogen in diborane. As with other boranes it exists {{in the form of}} a dimer with a twin <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bridge</b> that uses three-center two-electron bonding between the two boron atoms, and can be imagined as methyl borane (CH3BH2) bound to borane (BH3). [...] Other combinations of methylation occur on diborane, including 1,1-dimethylborane, 1,2-dimethyldiborane, trimethyldiborane, tetramethyldiborane, and trimethylborane (which is not a dimer). At room temperature the substance is at equilibrium between these molecules.|$|E
50|$|The “parent” {{structure}} of boranes {{is referred to}} as closo, but when the second and third vertices are removed the new structure is B4H10 and referred to as arachno.Boron is often called “electron deficient,” because it has three valence electrons, and the standard, carbon, has four. In reality the Boron is stable, and is no way actually deficient of electrons. To solve the issue of “deficiency” the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bridge</b> or protonated double bonds are introduced to the structure. Each boron is sp3 hybridized and “the configuration of the three hydrogens surrounding borons B1 and B3 is approximately trigonal and suggests approximately tetrahedral hybridization for these borons which would predict bond angles of 120.” However, the Boron arrangements can be classified as fragments of either the icosahedron or the octahedron because the bond angles are actually between 105 ̊ and 90 ̊. The bonding produces a butterfly geometry in the arachno structure. The Polyhedral Skeletal Electron Pair Theory (PSEPT), originally discovered by Kenneth Wade, are often referred to as Wade’s rules. These rules can be used to count electrons in structures, such as boron hydrides.|$|E

The results demonstrate that the interaction of atomic hydrogen with strained Si–O bonds in defect-free a-SiO 2 networks results {{in the formation of}} two distinct defect structures, which are referred to as the [SiO 4 /H] 0 and the hydroxyl E center. To study the distribution of each defect’s properties, up to 116 configurations of each center were calculated.

50|$|For {{several decades}} {{after they were}} first {{proposed}} around 1950, the existence and importance of non-classical ions in organic chemistry was bitterly controversial. As <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bridges</b> discussed here are 3 center (3 atom) - 2 electron bonds, the investigations over the possibilities of such systems laid an important framework from which to understand this bonding. Many of these studies centered around the 2-norbornyl cation. Observations made by Saul Winstein and others suggested that highly delocalized and symmetric intermediates {{were present in the}} reactions of various substituted norbornyl cations, evidence for non-classical ions. H. C. Brown, the most outspoken opponent of non-classical ions, believed that such non-classical bonding was invoked far too widely and saw no reason to deviate from the classical idea of rapidly equilibrating, discrete carbocations. In 1973, G. Olah was able to directly observe the 2-norbornyl cation by low-temperature NMR and confirm the presence of a non-classical 2-norbornyl cation, allowing the field to reach some conclusions about the possibilities of 3 center - 2 electron bonds involving carbon. This verification of delocalized sigma bonding in the 2-norbornyl system was a critical foundation for understanding <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bridges</b> between carbon atoms, another form of delocalized sigma bonding.|$|R
