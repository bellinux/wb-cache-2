5|$|When Ptolemy {{wrote his}} Geography around 150 AD, the Arun {{was called the}} Trisantonis, with later {{accounts}} using the same name. Trisantonis {{is thought to be}} a Brythonic word for 'the trespasser', indicating the river's tendency to <b>flood</b> <b>land</b> near to the river. Trisanto translates directly as 'one who goes across'. There is also a theory that the Arun may have been known as the Trisantonis in its lower reaches close to the sea, but known as the Arnus (from the Brythonic 'Arno' meaning run, go, or flow) in its upper reaches. It is possible that the town of Arundel may mean Arno-dell, or dell of the flowing river. By the Middle Ages the river was known as the river of Arundel, the Arundel river, or the high stream of Arundel. An alternative name, the Tarrant (derived from Trisantona), is, however, attested in 725 and 1270, and is reflected in the road name Tarrant Street, one of the main roads running through the town roughly parallel to the river. The first use of the modern name was recorded in 1577, but the alternative names of Arundel river or great river continued to be used for many years.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The rate of {{chromosome}} aberrations {{has been}} studied in higher aquatic plants: common reed, sagittaria, flowering rush and manna. The main water bodies were Glubokoye and Dalekoye- 1 Lakes (left-bank <b>flood</b> <b>lands</b> of the Pripyat River), Azbuchin Lake and Yanovsky Crawl (right-bank <b>flood</b> <b>lands</b> of the Pripyat River), Cooling Pond of the Chernobyl NPP as well as Pripyat and Uzh Rivers. In decreasing sequence due to the absorbed dose rate for hydrobionts the first were water bodies of the left-bank <b>flood</b> <b>lands</b> of the Pripyat River, the second ones from right-bank <b>flood</b> <b>lands.</b> The highest chromosome aberrations rate in root meristems was registered in plants from lakes within the left-bank <b>flood</b> <b>lands</b> of the Pripyat River, the lowest one – in plants from the Pripyat and Uzh Rivers. The chromosome aberration rate in closed and slow-running water bodies within the right-bank <b>flood</b> <b>lands</b> of the Pripyat River was in 3 – 4 times higher than spontaneous mutagenesis level. It seems that spectrum of the main types of chromosome damages in plants of right-bank <b>flood</b> <b>lands</b> determines by chemical mutagens. The type of chromosome damages distribution in plants of the left-bank <b>flood</b> <b>lands</b> points to practically equivalent effects of radiation and chemical factors. 1...|$|R

50|$|It {{was until}} {{recently}} densely populated with ancient oak {{trees and the}} last surviving full oak forest in western Europe.Its Irish name, An Gaoire, {{is derived from the}} Irish word Gaorthadh, roughly the Wooden River. It was flooded in 1954 to facilitate the building of two hydro-electric dams in Carrigadrohid and Inniscarra, which provide electricity for the nearby city of Cork. The area is now part of the plants' upper reservoir. The development required that the region was flooded, and so lead to the felling of hundreds of trees and the removal and relocation of tracts of people. Many of the trees were centuries old and had grown since the medieval period. Today only their stumps survive, in <b>flood</b> <b>land,</b> giving the area a ghostly and almost lunar appearance.|$|E

50|$|The Ngounié River, with a basin area {{of about}} 33100 km2, {{is the second}} largest {{tributary}} of the Ogooué River. It rises in the Chaillu Mountains. For 60 km, the river has a south and then west flow, and forms a border with Congo. At the Polo River confluence, it changes direction, heading northwest, before passing through three waterfalls. It then establishes a floodplain within a 220 km valley between the Moukande Mountains and the Massif due Chaillu. After meandering for more than 400 km on the valley floor, it joins the Ogooué prior to Lambaréné. Development in the floodplain occurs mostly in the areas between Lebamba and Mouila, and again from the Fougamou area to the Ogooué at Lambarene. Conservatively, the estimated valley <b>flood</b> <b>land</b> area is approximately 150000 ha. The left bank is characterized by sandy clay soils.|$|E
50|$|Both {{natural and}} {{man-made}} levees can fail {{in a number}} of ways. Factors that cause levee failure include overtopping, erosion, structural failures, and levee saturation. The most frequent (and dangerous) is a levee breach. Here, a part of the levee actually breaks or is eroded away, leaving a large opening for water to <b>flood</b> <b>land</b> otherwise protected by the levee. A breach can be a sudden or gradual failure, caused either by surface erosion or by subsurface weakness in the levee. A breach can leave a fan-shaped deposit of sediment radiating away from the breach, described as a crevasse splay. In natural levees, once a breach has occurred, the gap in the levee will remain until it is again filled in by levee building processes. This increases the chances of future breaches occurring in the same location. Breaches can be the location of meander cutoffs if the river flow direction is permanently diverted through the gap.|$|E
50|$|Avila {{was born}} March 19, 1865 on São Jorge Island in the Azores of Portugal. He immigrated from the Azores to California in 1883. For {{the first several}} years Avila worked as a laborer on local farms in Alameda County (Niles and Mission San Jose areas). Avila then in 1888 moved to the Atwater-Buchach area in Merced County and planted a {{successful}} garden of sweet potatoes (Ipomoea batatas) from seeding stock of his country. Then he planted a field of 6 or 7 acres of sweet potatoes. Eventually, with his brother Antone, he bought a 20-acre farm field in Merced County for a $1 an acre that was <b>flood</b> <b>land</b> near the Merced River in a California valley. Avila planted sweet potatoes there and became a pioneer sweet potato grower in Merced County. He produced over one hundred sacks of sweet potatoes per acre. As of 1905, Avila was selling his sweet potatoes to buyers in Colorado, Washington, and Oregon, and shipping out up to one hundred and forty-five railroad carloads a year.|$|E

50|$|The western {{boundary}} of the parish is formed by Swinefleet Warping Drain. This was authorised by an Act of Parliament obtained by Ralph Creyke and T.H.S. Sotheron, and parts of it were completed by 1821. Warping was a process by which silt-rich river water was allowed to <b>flood</b> <b>land</b> which was of poor quality. The silt would be deposited on the surface, and {{over a period of}} time, would build up to create soils which could support agriculture. The two men succeeded in improving a large area of land over the next 40 years. It was the most successful of several plans to improve Thorne and Hatfield Moors by warping, as Makin Durham succeeded in creating Durham's Warping Drain {{to the west of the}} moors, but failed to reclaim much land, and the Thorne Moor Improvement Company's scheme failed when the Great Northern Railway Company abandoned their planned line from Gainsborough to Doncaster via Thorne, which would have enabled agricultural produce from the reclaimed land to be taken to market.|$|E

40|$|Fourier {{analysis}} of Moderate Resolution Image Spectrometer (MODIS) time-series data {{was applied to}} monitor the flooding extent of the Waza-Logone floodplain, located {{in the north of}} Cameroon. Fourier transform (FT) enabled quantification of the temporal distribution of the MIR band and three different indices: the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). The resulting amplitude, phase, and amplitude variance images for harmonics 0 to 3 were used as inputs for an artificial neural network (ANN) to differentiate between the different land cover/land use classes: <b>flooded</b> <b>land,</b> dry land, and irrigated rice cultivation. Different combinations of input variables were evaluated by calculating the Kappa Index of Agreement (KIA) of the resulting classification maps.

5000|$|Baillie Grohman {{liked the}} new country he found {{so much that}} he {{returned}} to British Columbia in the 1880s as a pioneer, investing through the Kootenay Company Ltd, a London registered company which obtained a concession of 78525 acre to develop the Upper and Lower Kootenay valleys. He wrote a number of articles for British magazines promoting the possibilities of British Columbia. In his youth he had seen how the embankment of the Inn River in the lower Inntal had turned unproductive <b>flood</b> <b>land</b> into profitable farmland and so envisaged that a similar control of the Kootenay River and a lowering of the water levels of the Kootenay Lake would create large areas of fertile farmland. This plan was thwarted by political pressure from the Canadian Pacific Railway and others, who managed ultimately to get the concession revoked and awarded to rival interests. Probably his impatient and untactful temperament and privileged background was not well suited to the political manoeuvring needed to mollify the Provincial Colonial Administration and counter the machinations of competing American syndicates. Before the concession was revoked the Kootenay Company was held to one of the conditions of its grant - that it must build a canal to connect the Columbia River and Kootenay. The canal took a massive investment and because of the railway, was pointless (only two ships ever used it) and the project failed. It is now a historic site at Canal Flats, British Columbia. Grohmann lived some time in Victoria, British Columbia, negotiating the concession with the government of BC, and then in the Kootenay, opening the first steam sawmill in the region. His account of his time in BC Fifteen Years' Sport and Life in the Hunting Grounds of Western America and British Columbia (1900) describes his time pioneering, and also has accounts of hunting the rare white Rocky mountain [...] "antelope goat", known then as [...] "Haplocerus Montanus" [...] but now assigned the Linnaean name of Oreamnos americanus, along with many other types of game.|$|E
