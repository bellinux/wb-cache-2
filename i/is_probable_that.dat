5|$|During {{the early}} morning {{surprise}} attack, on June15, 1914, Thomson {{was shot in the}} chest (despite the fact that rebels were attacking behind him) and died within a few minutes. It <b>is</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> an Italian sniper was responsible.|$|E
5|$|Ancient sources present {{disparate}} casualty {{figures for}} the Battle of Issus. Plutarch and Diodorus Siculus approximate 100,000 Persian deaths, {{in contrast with the}} 450 Macedonian deaths reported by Quintus Curtius Rufus. In any case, it <b>is</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> more Persians were killed as they fled than in battle; Ptolemy I, who served with Alexander during the battle, recounts how the Macedonians crossed a ravine on the bodies of their enemies during the pursuit.|$|E
5|$|As a diplodocid, it <b>is</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> Dinheirosaurus {{possessed a}} whip-tail. If it did, {{it is likely}} that its tail could be used like a bullwhip, with {{supersonic}} speed. Being related to both Apatosaurus and Diplodocus, Dinheirosaurus probably possessed a squared snout. This means that it was probably a non-selective ground-feeding sauropod.|$|E
6000|$|Her host {{dropped his}} eyes as well; but it <b>was</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> the {{movement}} had in each case a different spring. [...] "Yes, and what else?" ...|$|R
50|$|In 1953, Hélie then {{served in}} the 11e Régiment Parachutiste de Choc. By definition, there was no {{information}} on this passage, however it <b>was</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> he remained in Indochina.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{they would}} have done, sir. I was very glad when I saw the boat coming, as I thought it <b>was</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> you <b>were</b> on board her, and we are rather in a difficulty." ...|$|R
5|$|Continuing {{improvements}} in engineering and economics are enabling {{more of the}} renewable resources to be utilised. Fears regarding peak oil and climate change have driven the subject high up the political agenda and are also encouraging the use of various biofuels. Although the finances of many projects remain either speculative or dependent on market incentives, it <b>is</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> {{there has been a}} significant, and in all likelihood long-term change, in the underpinning economics.|$|E
5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> in {{the early}} 1660s Morgan was active {{with a group of}} privateers led by Sir Christopher Myngs attacking Spanish cities and {{settlements}} in the Caribbean and Central America. In 1663 it is likely that Morgan captained one of the ships in Myngs' fleet, and took part in the attack on Santiago de Cuba and the Sack of Campeche on the Yucatán Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> the {{sarcophagus}} {{was installed}} on or shortly before May 2, 1426, when the Calimala contracted for two chaplains {{to say a}} daily mass for Cossa's soul. The records of the Duomo workshop indicate that on January 28, 1427 Valori bought four white marble blocks for the tomb.|$|E
60|$|At {{one time}} the boys thought of rolling down the steep slope, and taking their chance, but this they agreed would be a last resource, as it <b>was</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> the slope ended in an {{absolute}} precipice.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you know, Mr. Slope, {{how long}} I have been officiating as a clergyman in this city?" [...] Mr. Slope's wish was now nearly fulfilled. Mr. Harding had become angry, and it <b>was</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> he might commit himself.|$|R
60|$|Tressilian paused an instant. It was {{indifferent}} {{to him by}} what road he left a spot now so odious to his recollections; but it <b>was</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> the postern door was locked, and his retreat by that pass rendered impossible.|$|R
5|$|Seated at {{an ornate}} wooden table, wearing a pearl tiara and flowing silk, is Sigismunda (called Ghismonda in Boccaccio's {{original}} tale), the heroine {{of one of}} the novelle. It <b>is</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> Hogarth modelled her on his wife, Jane. She clasps a golden goblet containing the heart of her murdered husband, Guiscardo.|$|E
5|$|The Theban Hills are {{dominated}} by the peak of al-Qurn, known to the Ancient Egyptians as ta dehent, or 'The Peak'. It has a pyramid-shaped appearance, and it <b>is</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> this echoed the pyramids of the Old Kingdom, {{more than a thousand}} years prior to the first royal burials carved here. Its isolated position also resulted in reduced access, and special tomb police (the Medjay) were able to guard the necropolis.|$|E
5|$|The kerb-stones {{around the}} tomb display some patterning; {{those on the}} {{northern}} side are mostly rectilinear, while those on the southern side are smaller and largely irregular in shape. It <b>is</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> there was an ancillary dry-stone wall constructed using blocks of ironstone from the geological Folkestone beds, as is evident at Chestnuts Long Barrow. Given that such blocks of stone rarely occur naturally, {{it may have been}} quarried.|$|E
50|$|It <b>is</b> highly <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> {{he died in}} Königsberg in 1865.|$|R
60|$|Dick {{then told}} the story of the {{intervention}} of the tiger in their behalf, and said that afterward an Indian lady had succored them, hinting {{that at the end of}} the war it <b>was</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> Ned would present his father with a daughter-in-law.|$|R
6000|$|... "Take my {{word for}} it, it would. Look all around. There was Adelaide Schropner,--but that was before your time, and you would not remember." [...] Considering that Adelaide Schropner had been for many years a grandmother, it <b>was</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> Isa would not remember.|$|R
5|$|Until 1295, Nicholas was {{referred}} to as Nicholas of St Andrews (de Sancto Andrea), but in February of that year he began to be called de Balmyle, one source referring to him as de Balmyll dictus de Sancto Andrea (de Balmyle called de Sanctoandrea). It <b>is</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> he adopted de Sancto Andrea when he finished training at St Andrews and went elsewhere, and that he dropped it in 1295 when he moved back.|$|E
5|$|A {{monument}} {{was raised}} in 790 although {{the name of the}} ruler responsible is not preserved. Two more were raised in 800 and three in 810. No monument was erected to commemorate the important Bak'tun-ending of 830 and it <b>is</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> political authority had alreadly collapsed at this time. Important cities such as Oxpemul, Nadzcaan and La Muñeca that were Calakmul's vassals at one time now erected their own monuments, where before they had raised very few; some continued producing new monuments until as late as 889. This was a process that paralleled events at Tikal. However, there is strong evidence of an elite presence at the city continuing until AD 900, possibly even later.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{nothing is}} known about the {{behaviour}} of Newton's parakeet, but it <b>is</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> it was similar to that of other members of its genus. Leguat mentioned that the parrots of the island ate the nuts of the bois d'olive tree (Cassine orientalis). Tafforet also stated that the parrots ate the seeds of the bois de buis shrub (Fernelia buxifolia), which is endangered today, but was common all over Rodrigues and nearby islets during his visit. Newton's parakeet may have fed on leaves as the related echo parakeet does. The fact that it survived long after Rodrigues had been heavily deforested shows that its ecology was less vulnerable than that of, for example, the Rodrigues parrot.|$|E
50|$|According to the {{historian}} Charles Dodd he was executed in York in 1610, in {{the reign of}} James I. The Catholic Encyclopedia thinks <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> Dodd had confused him with another Catholic martyr, Thomas Atkinson, {{although there was a}} Marian priest called Nicholas Atkinson.|$|R
60|$|He {{went to the}} telephone. Before he {{had left}} New York on his travels, Arthur Mifflin had been living at a hotel near Washington Square. It <b>was</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> he <b>was</b> still there. He called up the number. The night-clerk was an old {{acquaintance}} of his.|$|R
60|$|For {{the next}} two days it <b>was</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> they would make as long and speedy {{journeys}} as the animals could accomplish. After that, being well in their own country, they would cease to travel rapidly, as no pursuit had ever been attempted in former instances.|$|R
5|$|Before {{the age of}} the bucentaurs, it <b>is</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> for ceremonies in the Venetian Lagoon the doge {{was simply}} {{assigned}} a small galley from the Venetian fleet. As Venice's wealth increased due to its naval power, plans were made for a special ship to be built. This is evidenced by the promissioni – sacramental pledges spoken by the doges when they were sworn into office – of Reniero Zeno of 1252, Lorenzo Tiepolo of 1268 and Giovanni Soranzo of 1312 which mention the construction of a bucentaur in the Arsenale shipyard and naval depot.|$|E
5|$|During its flyby of Amalthea, the Galileo orbiter's star scanner {{detected}} nine flashes {{that appear}} to be small moonlets near the orbit of Amalthea. Because they were sighted only from one location, their true distances could not be measured. These moonlets may be anywhere in size from gravel to stadium-sized. Their origins are unknown, but they may be gravitationally captured into current orbit or they may be ejecta from meteor impacts on Amalthea. On the next and final orbit (just an hour before destruction), Galileo detected one more such moonlet. However, this time Amalthea {{was on the other side}} of the planet, so it <b>is</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> the particles form a ring around the planet near Amalthea's orbit.|$|E
5|$|From the {{conflicting}} {{accounts of the}} sources, historians have tried to reconstruct the most likely sequence of {{events leading up to}} the battle. It <b>is</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> Olaf Tryggvason was indeed sailing from Wendland to Norway when he was ambushed, though the kings' sagas probably play up the importance of Thyri and her marriages. While it is possible that Olaf was collecting dowry, it seems more probable that he was expecting war and seeking allies in Wendland, but met with little success. The character of Sigvaldi remains enigmatic, though there is evidence from skaldic poetry that he did indeed betray Olaf.|$|E
6000|$|But in {{his heart}} {{he knew it was}} not [...] "all right," [...] and that they stood in {{imminent}} danger of death by drowning. They were whirling down a raging river in a cart. In a few moments it <b>was</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> the cart would upset, and then---- ...|$|R
60|$|There was none. It <b>was</b> not <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> {{there would}} <b>be</b> any to a {{treasure}} chamber.|$|R
60|$|I {{looked at}} them, it was true. They were huge {{and ran up}} for fifty or sixty feet without a bough. Moreover, it <b>was</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> the god climbed better than we could. The Kalubi began to move inland in an {{indeterminate}} fashion, and I asked him where he was going.|$|R
5|$|Lichton's death {{cannot be}} {{precisely}} dated. It fell between 11 November (Martinmas) 1440, and 11 January 1441; it <b>is</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> {{he died on}} either 12 or 14 December, because these were the anniversaries given {{to him in the}} 15th century and the 16th century respectively. He was buried in his new chapel, the one dedicated to St John the Evangelist. As a churchman, Lichton could never marry and did not; he did however father a bastard, a daughter named Janet, who appeared in the records receiving papal dispensation to marry in 1432.|$|E
5|$|Monteverdi's next {{commission}} from Mantua {{came early}} in 1618, {{when he was}} asked to provide the music for Andromeda, an opera based on the ancient Greek myth of the princess chained to a rock. The libretto was written by Duke Ferdinando's chancellor, Ercole Marigliani, and the project was sponsored by the duke's younger brother, Don Vincenzo Gonzaga. It <b>is</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> the work was intended for performance at the Mantua Carnival of March 1618, but as Carter records, Monteverdi's approach to his Mantua commissions was often dilatory and half-hearted; his inability or unwillingness to work on Andromeda delayed its performance, first to 1619 and then to 1620.|$|E
5|$|Roderigo (or Rodrigo) Lopez {{was born}} into a family of Jewish origin in Portugal around 1517. His father, António Lopes, was {{physician}} to King John III of Portugal, and had been baptised into the Roman Catholic Church under coercion in 1497. Lopez was baptised and raised in the Catholic faith as a converso or New Christian, and educated at the University of Coimbra. He received a BA degree under the name Ruy Lopes on 7 February 1540, then an MA on 4 December 1541; he enrolled for a medical course on 23 December that year. Records do not survive regarding his doctorate, but according to his biographer Edgar Samuel it <b>is</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> he received it in 1544.|$|E

25|$|A {{meeting of}} the {{shareholders}} of the Shoalwater Bay Transportation Company was scheduled to have been held on November 15, 1881, where a proposition to increase the capital stock of the company was to be acted upon. It {{was reported to have}} <b>been</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> another steamer would be brought into service.|$|R
50|$|Dr Hans-Georg Krug. Little {{is known}} of when he joined Pers S Z but it <b>was</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> he joined in early 1940. In 1941 he was {{recommended}} for promotion to Specialist. At {{the end of the}} war he was in charge of all Pers Z S Hollerith installations and other custom machinery.|$|R
