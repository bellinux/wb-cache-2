50|$|Corrosion at {{the battery}} {{terminals}} can prevent a car from starting due to electrical resistance, {{which can be}} prevented by the proper application of <b>dielectric</b> <b>grease.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Dielectric</b> <b>grease</b> is {{electrically}} insulating {{and does not}} break down when high voltage is applied. It is often applied to electrical connectors, particularly those containing rubber gaskets, {{as a means of}} lubricating and sealing rubber portions of the connector without arcing.|$|E
50|$|Prior to the Kickstarter {{campaign}} {{there was}} a limited run of 150 Special Edition units. There are two notable differences: Special Edition text under the GCW Zero screen logo and a 32GB internal MicroSD card versus the 16GB of later production units. A common problem with these Special Edition units is a sticking directional pad in the down direction. Common fixes for this issue include {{the application of a}} small amount of <b>dielectric</b> <b>grease</b> in the affected friction area or official 3D printed replacement buttons from the GCW Zero store on Shapeways.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the rheological behaviour and film formation of greases and oils under elastohydrodynamic (EHD) conditions. It approaches the lubrication of non-conforming contacts from tribological {{as well as}} from dielectric point of view. The experimental work was carried out on a point contact formed between a ball and the flat of a disc, which was either transparent, for optical interferometry study or steel in order to evaluate the conditions in real-life machine components. In the second case electrical capacitance method has been employed to study film formation. The experimental equipment has also been adapted to study the starvation behaviour of grease lubricants in point EHD contacts under vibrations. Dielectric properties of lubricants have been studied in static conditions and correlated to their performance in EHD conditions. The <b>dielectric</b> constant of <b>greases</b> indicates in general higher value than corresponding base oils and the dielectric relaxation time of greases is proved to be shorter. It has been found that in EHD conditions higher-polar greases show higher shear stress, while the dielectric constant of the lubricating film decreases with increasing contact pressure. The effect of three parameters upon grease EHD films was evaluated: operating speed, load and vibration of the contact. The results showed that greases possess an intrinsic time to starvation related to the operating speed but independent of the exerted load. The results also showed that a high speed was not necessarily associated with the high likelihood of occurrence of starvation. The vibration tests revealed that the lateral motion perpendicular to the rotating direction helped maintain the inlet region flooded and, under oscillations, starvation of the contact seems to never occur. This would suggest that machine elements such as rolling element bearings could operate under the fully flooded conditions as vibrations are almost inevitable in any machinery. Finally, the cavitation phenomenon was also investigated and found that the rheological model of greases could be predicted from the observation of the cavity pattern...|$|R
5000|$|Spark plug wires have {{an outer}} {{insulation}} several times thicker than the conductor, {{made of a}} very flexible and heat-resistant material such as silicone or EPDM rubber. The thick insulation prevents arcing from the cable to an earthed engine component. A rubber [...] "boot" [...] covers each terminal. <b>Dielectric</b> <b>grease</b> {{can be used to}} improve insulation; a small amount can be applied in the inside of the rubber boot at each end of each wire to help seal out moisture. Printing on spark plug wires may include a brand name, insulation thickness (in millimeters), insulation material type, cylinder number, and conductor type (suppressor or solid wire).|$|E
50|$|Another {{common use}} of <b>dielectric</b> <b>grease</b> {{is on the}} rubber mating {{surfaces}} or gaskets of multi-pin electrical connectors used in automotive and marine engines. The grease again acts as a lubricant and a sealant on the nonconductive mating surfaces of the connector. It is not recommended {{to be applied to}} the actual electrical conductive contacts of the connector because it could interfere with the electrical signals passing through the connector in cases where the contact pressure is very low. Products designed as electronic connector lubricants, on the other hand, should be applied to such connector contacts and can dramatically extend their useful life. Polyphenyl ether, rather than silicone grease, is the active ingredient in some such connector lubricants.|$|E
50|$|A {{common use}} of <b>dielectric</b> <b>grease</b> is in {{high-voltage}} connections associated with gasoline engine spark plugs. The grease {{is applied to}} the rubber boot of the plug wire. This helps the rubber boot slide onto the ceramic insulator of the plug. The grease also acts to seal the rubber boot, {{while at the same time}} preventing the rubber from becoming stuck to the ceramic. Generally, spark plugs are located in areas of high temperature and the grease is formulated to withstand the temperature range expected. It can be applied to the actual contact as well, because the contact pressure is sufficient to penetrate the grease film. Doing so on such high pressure contact surfaces between different metals has the advantage of sealing the contact area against electrolytes that might cause rapid deterioration from galvanic corrosion.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} use, however, is {{probably}} in vehicles. It {{is used in}} door seals, window seals, trunk seals, and sometimes hood seals. Frequently, these seals {{are the source of}} noise due to movement of the door against the car body and the resulting friction between the EPDM rubber and the mating surface (painted sheet metal or glass). This can be alleviated using specialty coatings that are applied at the time of manufacture of the weather seal. Such coatings can also greatly increase the chemical resistance of EPDM rubber. Some vehicle manufacturers also recommend a light application of silicone <b>dielectric</b> <b>grease</b> to weatherstripping to reduce noise. Other uses in vehicles include cooling system circuit hoses where water pumps, thermostats, EGR valves, EGR coolers, heaters, oil coolers, radiators, and degas bottles are connected with EPDM hoses, as well as charge air tubing on turbocharged engines to connect the cold side of the charge air cooler (intercooler) to the intake manifold.|$|E
