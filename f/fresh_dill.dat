50|$|Since its {{inception}} in 2004 by 40 local residents, Dill Pickle has remained connected with its regional people in Chicago, Illinois. This organization {{is a good example}} of the widespread support of local food, as it grossed $1.3 million in revenue in its first year, 2009. Since the people own this co-op, it is influenced by the stakeholders to always uphold their local and <b>fresh</b> prerogative. <b>Dill</b> Pickle utilizes a user-friendly interface. Their facility convenes all fresh, local food in one location, making it extremely convenient for its customers.|$|R
50|$|Dill seed, {{having a}} flavor similar to caraway but also {{resembling}} that of <b>fresh</b> or dried <b>dill</b> weed, {{is used as}} a spice. Dill oil is extracted from the leaves, stems and seeds of the plant. The oil from the seeds is distilled and used in the manufacturing of soaps.|$|R

In Northern Iran, mâst chekide is a variety of kefir with a {{distinct}} sour taste. It is usually mixed with fresh herbs in a pesto-like purée called delal.Yogurt is a side dish to all Iranian meals. Strained yogurt is used as dips and various appetizers with multitudes of ingredients: cucumbers, onions, shallots, <b>fresh</b> herbs (<b>dill,</b> spearmint, parsley, cilantro), spinach, walnuts, zereshk, garlic, etc. The most popular appetizers are spinach or eggplant borani, ‘’Mâst-o-Khiâr’’ with cucumber, spring onions and herbs, or ‘’Mâst-Musir’’ with wild shallots.|$|R
50|$|In {{central and}} eastern Europe, Scandinavia, Baltic states, Russia, and Finland, dill is a popular culinary herb used in the kitchen along with chives or parsley. <b>Fresh,</b> finely cut <b>dill</b> leaves are used as topping in soups, {{especially}} the hot red borsht and the cold borsht mixed with curds, kefir, yoghurt, or sour cream, which is served during hot summer weather and is called okroshka. It is also popular in summer to drink fermented milk (curds, kefir, yoghurt, or buttermilk) mixed with dill (and sometimes other herbs).|$|R
50|$|In former times, the country's harsh climate {{meant that}} {{fresh fruit and}} {{vegetables}} were largely unavailable for nine months of the year, leading to a heavy reliance on staple tubers (initially turnip, later potato), dark rye bread and fermented dairy products, occasionally enlivened with preserved fish and meat. Traditionally, very few spices other than salt were available, and <b>fresh</b> herbs like <b>dill</b> were limited to the summer months. Many Finnish traditional dishes are prepared by stewing {{them for a long time}} in an oven, which produces hearty but bland fare. Forests and lakes were historically a major source of food, and produce from forests currently accounts for the distinctive traits in Finnish cuisine. The simplicity of traditional Finnish food has been turned into an advantage by shifting the emphasis to freshness. Modern Finnish restaurateurs now blend high-quality Finnish products with continental cooking techniques. This approach helped Helsinki's Chez Dominique to receive two Michelin stars in 2003 (the restaurant closed in 2013).|$|R

40|$|Hybrid {{cucumbers}} were cultivated {{on the red}} clover/grass ploughed in {{the autumn}} (control). Aditionally in the spring compost (25 t. ha- 1) and the liquid manure (20 m 3. ha- 1) were applied. Enrichment of the soil with the composition of effective microorganisms (EM - 5 l. ha- 1) or 3 -times foliar spray of 0. 2 % sea-algae extract was also applied in the experiment. The soil surface was mulched with the straw, red clover/grass and black polypropylene (PP- 50 g. m 2) or left coverless (control). The earliness {{and structure of the}} yield, the content of mineral nutrients in the soil and in the plant and the biological value of <b>fresh</b> and <b>dill</b> pickled cucumbers were determined. The fertilization with the liquid manure significantly increased the content of N-NO 3 in the soil in the first period of plants growth, more than in the case of compost. The use of EM had no effect on available nitrogent content in the soil. The content of N-NO 3, during vegetation period, in the soil mulched with clover was higher than in control as well as in soil covered with straw or polypropylene fleece. The additional use of organic fertilizers or the soil enrichement with EM asa well as foliar spraying with the sea-algae extracts, in cucumbers cultivated on ploughed 2 -years red clover/grass, did not increase early and marketable yield of cucumber. The fertilization with the liquid manure and straw mulching had unfavorable effect on the yield and crop quality, increasing the share of misshaped fruits and occurence of hollow seed cavity. Compost fertilization, foliar spraying of sea-algae extract and red clover mulch secured the best quality of dill pickled cucumbers...|$|R

50|$|With the {{exception}} of mustard for sausages, German dishes are rarely hot and spicy; the most popular herbs are traditionally parsley, thyme, laurel, chives, black pepper (used in small amounts), juniper berries, nutmeg, and caraway. Cardamom, anise seed, and cinnamon are often used in sweet cakes or beverages associated with Christmas time, and sometimes {{in the preparation of}} sausages, but are otherwise rare in German meals. Other herbs and spices, such as basil, sage, oregano, and hot chili peppers, have become popular since the early 80´s. <b>Fresh</b> <b>dill</b> is very common in a green salad or fish fillet.|$|E

5000|$|In India, dill {{is known}} as [...] "Sholpa" [...] in Bengali, shepu (शेपू) in Marathi and Konkani, savaa in Hindi or soa in Punjabi. In Telugu, it is called Soa-kura (for herb greens). It is also called sabbasige soppu (ಸಬ್ಬಸಿಗೆ ಸೊಪ್ಪು) in Kannada. In Tamil it {{is known as}} sada kuppi(சதகுப்பி). In Malayalam, it is ചതകുപ്പ (chathakuppa) or ശതകുപ്പ (sathakuppa). In Sanskrit, this herb is called shatapushpa. In Gujarati, it is known as suva(સૂવા). In India, dill is {{prepared}} {{in the manner of}} yellow moong dal as a main-course dish. It is considered to have very good antigas properties, so it is used as mukhwas, or an after-meal digestive. It is also traditionally given to mothers immediately after childbirth. In the state of Uttar Pradesh in India, a smaller amount of <b>fresh</b> <b>dill</b> is cooked along with cut potatoes and fresh fenugreek leaves (Hindi आलू-मेथी-सोया).In Manipur, dill, locally known as pakhon, is an essential ingredient of chagem pomba - a traditional Manipuri dish made with fermented soybean and rice.

5000|$|In general, {{definitions}} of the fines herbes group in American cook books {{have tended to be}} somewhat elastic. James Beard's Fireside Cookbook (1949), for example, contains a recipe for what he calls a [...] "Fines Herbes Bowl", a dip featuring chopped parsley, chives, dill, chopped green pepper, and salt, mixed into a pint of sour cream. In his subsequent discussion of [...] "Salad Herbs", Beard lists: 1) Tarragon: [...] "The most pleasant salad herb .... Use the fresh if you can"; 2) Chervil, which he calls [...] "delicate and subtle"; [...] 3) <b>Fresh</b> <b>Dill,</b> which Beard recommends especially for salads containing cucumber or cabbage; and 4) Sweet Basil: a [...] "a natural complement to tomatoes". Beard identifies these four herbs—tarragon, chervil, dill, and basil—as, [...] "the noblest of the salad herbs", noting parenthetically, however, that [...] "some people like to use a little thyme or rosemary." [...] Finally, the basis of the French fines herbes lineup: parsley, although not one of Beard's aforementioned [...] "noble" [...] salad herbs, yet [...] "adds much to many salad mixtures, although in a green salad it has perhaps less place." [...] Oddly, in this discussion of salad herbs, Beard omits chives altogether, though earlier, on page 16 he had called chives, [...] "welcome in practically any dish; enhances other flavorings." ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe dill variety ‘Superdukat’ {{stems and}} leaves {{grown in the}} test fields of the Latvia University of Agriculture were {{harvested}} in July 2010 and dried by eight microwave vacuum drying programmes at various vacuum, drum rotation speed and specific energy. Volatiles from <b>fresh</b> <b>dill</b> leaves and fresh and dried dill stems were isolated using solid phase micro extraction with DVB/Car/PDMS fibre and analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The main aroma compounds of dill leaves are α-phellandrene, dill ether and these results are comparable with those found in literature. In stems a lower concentration of α-phellandrene but {{a higher percentage of}} dill ether was detected. Used microwave vacuum drying programme showed the significant influence to the GC total and individual peak areas of aroma compounds. Deviation square sum was calculated to compare the percentage composition of <b>fresh</b> <b>dill</b> and stems versus dried dill stems. The volatile compounds content in dried dill stems obtained using programme 4 is the most similar to the composition of <b>fresh</b> <b>dill</b> leaves and stems, whereas the least similar –dried using programme 3.

40|$|Dill {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} plants in the world because of its medicinal properties and it is widely used as a vegetable in the most parts of Iran. In the present study a new solar dryer with finny, perforated absorber plate collector was utilized to dry <b>fresh</b> <b>dill.</b> The dryer was comprised of a solar collector, a product container, a fan and a drying air temperature controller. The temperature controller was used as a control system to regulate the drying air temperature. Thermal performance of the dryer with finny, perforated solar collector was compared with that of a simple flat plate solar collector at different airflow rates. The effect of drying air temperature at three levels (45, 55 and 65 °C), the product size at three lengths (3, 5 and 7 cm) and two different modes of drying (mixed and indirect) on the dryer performance was investigated. The results showed that the finny, perforated absorber plate solar collector could improve the thermal efficiency about 11 % in comparison with the flat plate collector and the highest thermal efficiency was achieved at the maximum airflow rate. Meanwhile, increasing the air temperature and decreasing the product size caused a significant reduction in energy consumption. Solar fraction reduced by increasing the air temperature. Finally a maximum dryer efficiency of 70 % was observed at air temperature of 65 oC, product size of 3 cm with mixed mode drying...|$|E
40|$|Because of {{its high}} perishability, <b>fresh</b> <b>dill</b> (Anethum graveolens L.) cannot be stored {{for more than a}} few days, even at low temperature. The present study was {{therefore}} undertaken to determine whether modified atmospheres based on changes in CO 2 and O 2 concentrations would benefit dill storage. Dill cv. Ducat was cultivated between October 2009 and January 2010. Plants were harvested at the fresh market stage (before flowering) and randomly selected leaves were weighed, placed in airtight plastic bags and stored for 10 days at 5 °C. The atmospheres within the containers (O 2 -CO 2 -N 2) were initially as follows: (1) 20 - 0 - 80 (air), (2) 20 - 10 - 70, (3) 10 - 0 - 90, and (4) : 10 - 10 - 80. The changes in O 2 -CO 2 concentrations were monitored during storage; fresh weight, chlorophyll, vitamin C and total phenolics concentrations were measured before and after storage. The oxygen concentration within the bags during storage fell to 12. 5 % (treatment 1) and 17. 9 % (treatment 2) indicating a reduction of respiration due to the inclusion of 10 % CO 2 within the initial atmosphere (20 % O 2). At an initial concentration of 10 % O 2, the oxygen level decreased to 5. 5 % and 5. 8 % in the absence or presence of 10 % CO 2 (treatments 3 and 4), respectively. In each case, the decrease in O 2 was accompanied by a corresponding increase in CO 2 concentration. Weight loss during storage ranged from 2. 6 - 5. 3 % and the total phenolics levels decreased in all treatments except treatment 3 (10 - 0 - 90). Vitamin C and chlorophyll concentrations decreased during storage. Vitamin C loss was similar in all treatments, but chlorophyll loss was significantly higher in the treatments with 10 % CO 2. In consequence, although modified atmospheres containing 10 % CO 2 reduce respiratory activity they are of questionable value for dill because the decrease in chlorophyll concentration causes a decrease in quality...|$|E
