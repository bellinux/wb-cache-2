The new mortar should be designed to match the mortar type, color and texture of the existing mortar to avoid incompatible materials and visual aberrations. The professional repointing process begins with a mortar analysis where a sample is taken and examined to identify the components, ratio, and aggregate. The old mortar is removed to a depth equal to or slightly more than the width of the joint, or to the point where sound mortar is reached. Depths greater than 2-1/2 inches or 4cm should be filled in several passes, allowing the mortar to cure for at least 24 hours depending on the mortar type.

40|$|Lack of fusion is a {{commonly}} occurring defect in Pulsed Transfer Gas Metal Arc Welding. Under optimum process parameter settings, such defects are {{mainly caused by}} positional error of the torch {{in relation to the}} <b>joint</b> <b>profile.</b> This project investigated relationships between seam tracking error and welding process parameters in order to detect lack of fusion. Using digital signal processing techniques, it was found that there existed consistent linear relationships between torch standoff and process variables in both the time and frequency domains. In the time domain, when the torch standoff increases, the mean values of both current power decrease, conversely the mean values of voltage and resistance increase. Whilst in the frequency-domain, it was also discovered that the pulse frequency of power supply varies during welding in accordance to changes in the torch standoff linearly. This curious finding was confirmed by the manufacturer {{as a result of the}} characteristics of the specific power supply used. Additionally, when torch oscillation is considered, it was established that torch offset produces distinct patterns in current signal waveforms which is affected by welding setup, such as the <b>joint</b> <b>profile</b> and the oscillation frequency and amplitude of the torch. For girth welding of symmetric joints, the following classification rule was derived in order to successfully monitor weld quality (lack of fusion) : The signature of a good weld has twice the weave frequency. The signature of a poor weld has the same frequency as the weave frequency. Due to its independent property of the power supply, this rule enables us to monitor weld quality (detecting lack of fusion) efficiently and robustly for any power supply type. Finally, several potential solutions for flexible on-line weld quality monitoring were also proposed...|$|E

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} {{finite element}} model has been developed to {{study the effects of}} solder volume and pad size on the reliability of a 540 -I/O plastic Ball-Grid-Array (PBGA) assembly. The model consisted of four parts: solder <b>joint</b> <b>profile</b> model, global model for the PBGA assembly, local model for the single solder joint, and solder joint fatigue life calculation. A submodeling technique was used to transfer the displacements to the local model for a detailed analysis under thermal cycling conditions. By using this model, the effects of solder volume and pad size on the fatigue life of BGA solder joints have been studied. With different volumes or pad sizes, the fatigue life could change from 1, 800 to 15, 000 thermal cycles. Since the fatigue life of this PBGA assembly was dominated by local mismatch in most cases, short joints could have longer fatigue lives than those with long joints. In addition, the effect of pad size on fatigue was also increased from a second-order to a higher order relationship. Such uncommon conclusions resulted from strong coupling effects of solder joint shape, global mismatch, and local mismatch. Key words: reliability, fatigue, PBGA, modelin...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effects of variations in thread shape on the axial pullout strength of orthodontic miniscrews. Methods: A total of 35 miniscrews, 7 of each design being considered, were tested by performing pullout tests on a synthetic bone support. We used self-tapping and self-drilling miniscrews having a diameter of 2 mm and a thread shaft length of 12 mm (the longest and the largest supplied by the manufacturer). A buttress reverse thread shape served as the control design and was tested against 4 experimental designs, each manufactured with a modification in thread shape while maintaining all other characteristics. The experimental groups had the following thread designs: buttress, 75 ° <b>joint</b> <b>profile,</b> rounded, and trapezoidal. Results: The control group with a buttress reverse thread shape had consistently higher pullout strength values than did the other designs. A statistically significant reduction in pullout force was found between the buttress reverse and the buttress thread miniscrews. Conclusions: Thread design influenced the resistance to pullout of the orthodontic miniscrews. The buttress reverse thread shape provided the greatest pullout strength. © 2012 by the American Association of Orthodontists...|$|E

The study leads to the following four findings: (a) the mathematical method can be used to identify the waviness and unevenness components for <b>joint</b> surface <b>profiles</b> and its composite topography. The height characteristic parameters of the complete surface topography of a joint are mainly determined by the waviness component. The texture characteristic parameters of the complete surface topography of a joint are mainly determined by the unevenness component, (b) joints can be classified into the three contact state cases using the waviness and unevenness components for both the <b>joint</b> surface <b>profiles</b> and the associated composite topography. The load-closure deformation behavior of a joint is determined by the waviness and unevenness components of the composite topography for a specific contact state, (c) the general load-closure deformation model developed in this paper is applicable to the three contact state cases. The general load-closure deformation model uses the composite topography of a joint and can take into account the effects of the contact states, the initial aperture and the waviness and unevenness components; (d) parametric studies and verifications with the uniaxial compression test results show that the general load-closure deformation model gives reasonable estimations of the load-closure deformation behavior of rock joint under compressive loading and can be reduced to those given by other researchers in the relevant literature. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Two mathematical models are developed, one for upright joints and one for inverted joints, to predict two-dimensional joint shape given the solder properties, {{the height of the}} joint, and the contact angles between the joint surface and the metallizations.

In this sense a correct stress-strain response by the model representing the rock mass behavior is essential. The shear and normal displacement of rock discontinuities and their shear and normal stiffness control the distribution of stress and displacement within a discontinuous rock mass. In conditions where an equivalent continuum based approach is not applicable, the joint material model should be able to describe important mechanisms such as asperity sliding and shearing, post-peak behavior, asperity deformation, and the effect of soft infilling. The distinct element code UDEC was used to simulate the direct shear tests on a natural <b>joint</b> <b>profile,</b> and the prediction of two existing models of discontinuity strength and deformation were then compared with a new soil-infilled joint model and with experimental data for clean and soil-infilled rock joints.

The presence of even a small amount of fine-grained infill material within a joint can reduce its shear strength considerably, depending on the degree of saturation of infill.

Previous studies of infilled joints have mainly been focused on idealised regular joint patterns owing to the simplicity and reproducibility in laboratory testing. Current literature on infilled rock joints has also neglected the effect of the degree of saturation of infill on the shear behaviour.

The implementation of robotic technology into welding processes is made difficult by the inherent process variables of part location, fit up, orientation and repeatability.

The development of such a prototype system which utilizes a manipulator arm, ultrasonic sensors and a transistorised welding power source is outlined.

Additionally, it monitors the <b>joint</b> <b>profile</b> of the molten weld pool and modifies the relevant heat input parameters ensuring consistent penetration, joint filling and acceptable weld bead shape.

40|$|Classical error {{analysis}} in remote sounding distinguishes between four classes: "smoothing errors," "model parameter errors," "forward model errors," and "retrieval noise errors". For infrared sounding "interference errors", which, in general, cannot be described by these four terms, can be significant. Interference errors originate from spectral residuals due to "interfering species" whose spectral features overlap with the signatures {{of the target}} species. A general method for quantification of interference errors is presented, which covers all possible algorithmic implementations, i. e., fine-grid retrievals of the interfering species or coarse-grid retrievals, and cases where the interfering species are not retrieved. In classical retrieval setups interference errors can exceed smoothing errors and can vary by orders of magnitude due to state dependency. An optimum strategy is suggested which practically eliminates interference errors by systematically minimizing the regularization strength applied to <b>joint</b> <b>profile</b> retrieval of the interfering species. This leads to an interfering-species selective deweighting of the retrieval. Details of microwindow selection are no longer critical for this optimum retrieval and widened microwindows even lead to reduced overall (smoothing and interference) errors.

In particular, the predicted <b>profiles</b> for <b>joint</b> angles have the same trend as the experimental profiles while their amplitudes are higher. Based on Fig.  7, the predicted profiles for the shoulder is not even have same curvature as experimental results which the un-modeled DOFs of the shoulder (this joint has 3 DOFs) would be a reasonable explain for that. The predicted angles for three of objective functions F_TMA, F_, F_ank almost are the same while for F_ it differs. Since the F_ is a kinematical-based defined function so it directly effects on the kinematics of the system (joint angles). So the kinematical nature of this objective function would be the reason of this difference. It is also recognizable in Fig.  6 by comparing posters set C with the other three sets. In particular, in posture set C the body starts motion with a completely squatted posture due to the foot dorsiflexion (θ_ankle = 45 ^∘) and knee flexion (θ_knee = 120 ^∘). While, the predicted motion for the other three objective functions initiate while the shank is almost vertical (θ_ankle≈ 45 ^∘) and knee is in extension mode (θ_knee≈ 70 ^∘). Consequently, the body requires to a forward bending {{in order to reach}} to the box. These two predicted modes of the lifting motion resemble two well-known lifting techniques i.e. leg lift or squat and back lift. In particular, the posture set C in Fig.  7 is similar to leg lift method since the body starts with the squatted posture {{and the rest of the}} posture sets (especially B and D since their initial postures of shank are quite vertical) looks like back lift technique due to the forward bending of the initial body postures.|$|R

This is partially because of {{the limited number of}} data points used to derive these equations, and partially because of the inconsistency in the methods for determining D. The 10 standard profiles on which most previous equations are based are probably too few for deriving a reliable correlation. Different methods may give different values of D for a given profile. The h–L method is updated in this study to avoid subjectivity involved in identifying the high-order asperities. The compass-walking, box-counting and the updated h–L method are employed to examine a larger population of 112 rock <b>joint</b> <b>profiles.</b> Based on these results, a new set of empirical equations are proposed, which indicate that the fractal dimension estimated from compass-walking and the updated h–L method closely relate to JRC, whereas the values estimated from box-counting do not relate as closely...|$|R
