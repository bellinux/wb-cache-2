5|$|Because he {{was delayed}} {{in getting the}} website online, Munroe {{had a lot of}} time {{thinking}} about the design of the blog. He eventually chose to display his entries as individual pages rather than using an infinite scrolling page, as he considers the latter more difficult to digest. Munroe usually chooses questions he already knows something interesting about, or after reading a scientific paper, he keeps an <b>eye</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> questions in which he can bring it up. Munroe has said that the volume of questions has been high enough that it is impossible to read all of them. Answering a question and writing a post takes him about a day of solid work.|$|E
25|$|Conflicts {{have arisen}} in the United States on federally-designated beaches, which are {{nevertheless}} patrolled by local police, {{since there is}} no federal law against nudity in these areas, but there may well be local ones. Skinny-dippers generally deal with this by keeping an <b>eye</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> local patrols, who generally do not {{go out of their way}} to find violators, as long as it is not flagrant.|$|E

Environmental officials for these states have attempted to slow {{the spread of the}} snail by advising the public to keep an <b>eye</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> the snails, and bleach or heat any gear which may contain mudsnails. Rivers have also been temporarily closed to fishing to avoid anglers spreading the snails.|$|E

25|$|Jefferson's ground sloth has {{a special}} place in modern paleontology, for Thomas Jefferson's letter on Megalonyx, read before the American Philosophical Society of Philadelphia in August 1796, marked the {{beginning}} of vertebrate paleontology in North America. When Lewis and Clark set out, Jefferson instructed Meriwether Lewis to keep an <b>eye</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> ground sloths. He was hoping they would find some living in the Western range. Megalonyx jeffersonii was appropriately named after Thomas Jefferson.|$|E
25|$|On May 10, 2008, the Japanese-spec Legacy can {{be fitted}} with a new {{collision}} avoidance feature, called EyeSight. It consists of twin CCD cameras, {{one on each side}} of the rear view mirror, that use human-like stereoscopic vision to judge distances and generally keep tabs on the driver. The system can help maintain a safe distance on the highway, a lane departure warning system, a driver alert warning for various safety situations, and even keeps an <b>eye</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> pedestrians. SI-Cruise has been integrated into the EyeSight feature as a driver safety aid.|$|E

Scott tried to get a naval vessel to go out and retrieve Countess of Harcourt, but none was available. Some did send out boats, as did some private individuals. Thinking that she might drift towards Bermuda, Scott advised the signal post to keep an <b>eye</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> her and to let him know if they spotted her. Next morning a man from the signal post notified him that they had sighted a vessel answering the description of Countess of Harcourt.|$|E

25|$|The four {{survivors}} were bitterly grieved by the loss, {{for they}} had grown into a band of brothers, and they swore to keep a sharp <b>eye</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> the Albatroses of Richthofen's squadron which had brought down Nash. At {{the same time they}} thought that Nash was dead. On the morning of June 27th they met the Richthofen Staffel near Courtrai, and this time Collishaw found himself engaged with the bright-green Albatros of Allmenröder – though he was not aware at the moment that he was fighting the conqueror of Nash. It was one of the classic dogfights of the war, like Barker against Linke, like Hawker against Richthofen – two skilled and experienced fighters, who knew every trick, had met.|$|E
25|$|As Robert E. Lee {{moved his}} Army of Northern Virginia northward in June 1863 through the Shenandoah Valley towards Pennsylvania, {{portions}} of his cavalry under J.E.B. Stuart slipped eastward across {{the path of}} the Union Army of the Potomac. A series of raids in eastern Maryland netted prisoners and supplies, as well as disrupting Federal communications and telegraph lines. However, Stuart was not in position to effectively screen Lee's advance or to provide intelligence on the movements of the Federal army. As Stuart headed north in an effort to link with Lee, Union cavalry commander Maj. Gen. Alfred Pleasonton, riding towards Pennsylvania to the west of Stuart, ordered his divisions to fan out across a wide swath, keeping an <b>eye</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> Confederates.|$|E

In an adaptation from life in the wild, horses {{are able to}} enter light sleep by using a [...] "stay apparatus" [...] in their legs, allowing them to doze without collapsing.

A horse kept alone will not sleep well because its instincts are to keep a constant <b>eye</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> danger.|$|E

500|$|Although Joseph Jackson {{initially}} {{demanded that}} his daughter's new album be recorded in Los Angeles {{so that he}} could keep an <b>eye</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> her, Jam and Lewis refused. They required the entire production of the album to be done at their own studio in Minneapolis, Minnesota, [...] "far from the glitter and distractions of Hollywood and the interference of manager-fathers." [...] Jam stated, [...] "We required that they put her in our hands. We had to do it on our turf, with no bodyguards, no star trips and none of Joe Jackson's people hanging around making suggestions." [...] Control was recorded at Flyte Tyme Studios, the site for Flyte Tyme Records, founded by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis in Minneapolis. [...] "There's a little radiator I used to sit on when we did the Control album," [...] Jackson recalled in 1993. John McClain served as the executive producer.|$|E

Groening joked the film [...] "posit the existence of a very active God", when asked if he believed it was likely to offend. Mark I. Pinsky, author of The Gospel According to The Simpsons, said the film [...] "treats genuine faith with respect, while keeping a sharp <b>eye</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> religious pretension and hypocrisy of all kinds". Regarding the scene where the tenants of Moe's Tavern and the Church switch locations, he believed it took the [...] "chance to unmask everyone's human fallibility." [...] In analyzing the role of Ned Flanders, he wrote, [...] "It is [...] willingness of The Simpsons to depict all the different sides of us [...] that makes it so rich and funny on our complicated relationship with religion." [...] Trees are a motif in the film, and they were implemented in every important or emotional scene throughout the film. The animators inserted an apple tree behind Lisa and Colin during their initial meeting, a reference to the biblical figures of Adam and Eve and the Garden of Eden.|$|E

500|$|The nostalgic [...] "Memory Lane (Sittin' in da Park)" [...] {{contains}} a Reuben Wilson sample, which comprises {{the sound of}} a Hammond organ, guitar, vocals and percussion, and adds to the track's ghostly harmonies. Spence D. of IGN wrote that the lyrics evoke [...] "the crossroads of Old School and New School." [...] "One Love" [...] is composed of a series of letters to incarcerated friends, recounting mutual acquaintances and events that have occurred since the receiver's imprisonment, and address unfaithful girlfriends, emotionally tortured mothers, and underdog loyalty. The phrase [...] "one love" [...] signifies street loyalty in the song. After delivering [...] "shout-outs to locked down comrades", Nas chastises a youth who seems destined for prison in the final verse, [...] "Shorty's laugh was cold blooded as he spoke so foul/Only twelve tryin to tell me that he liked my style [...] Words of wisdom from Nas, try to rise up above/Keep a <b>eye</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> Jake, shorty-wop, one love". Produced by Q-Tip, [...] "One Love" [...] samples the double bass and piano from the Heath Brothers' [...] "Smilin' Billy Suite Part II" [...] (1975) and the drum break from Parliament's [...] "Come In Out the Rain" [...] (1970), complementing the track's mystical and hypnotic soundscape.|$|E
500|$|While animal {{products}} {{were to be}} avoided during times of penance, pragmatic compromises often prevailed. The definition of [...] "fish" [...] was often extended to marine and semi-aquatic animals such as whales, barnacle geese, puffins and even beavers. The choice of ingredients may have been limited, {{but that did not}} mean that meals were smaller. Neither were there any restrictions against (moderate) drinking or eating sweets. Banquets held on fish days could be splendid, and were popular occasions for serving illusion food that imitated meat, cheese and eggs in various ingenious ways; fish could be moulded to look like venison and fake eggs could be made by stuffing empty egg shells with fish roe and almond milk and cooking them in coals. While Byzantine church officials took a hard-line approach, and discouraged any culinary refinement for the clergy, their Western counterparts were far more lenient. There was also no lack of grumbling about the rigours of fasting among the laity. During Lent, kings and schoolboys, commoners and nobility, all complained about being deprived of meat for the long, hard weeks of solemn contemplation of their sins. At Lent, owners of livestock were even warned to keep an <b>eye</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> hungry dogs frustrated by a [...] "hard siege by Lent and fish bones".|$|E
500|$|In October 1967, {{recording}} {{sessions for}} the second Jimi Hendrix Experience album [...] began at Olympic Studios in London. [...] On October 25, after recording the strongly R [...] "Wait Until Tomorrow", the Experience recorded an instrumental version of [...] "Little Wing". [...] It followed the same chord progression as the later master recording, but had a more forceful rock feel. After another take in the same vein, Chandler called for a different approach. [...] Recording engineer Eddie Kramer explained, [...] "Chas knew right away what was needed. [...] He had Jimi slow the tempo down and try it again". [...] After the basic track was completed, Hendrix and Kramer recorded overdubs on October 28, 1967. [...] For his recordings, Hendrix expended considerable effort to achieve the optimal tone for his guitar tracks. [...] For his rhythm guitar, he had set his pickup selector to a nonstandard position between the neck and middle settings to achieve a [...] "hollow" [...] tone, sometimes mistakenly referred to as [...] "out-of-phase". [...] However, for the lead, Kramer later fed the guitar signal through a makeshift Leslie speaker, which was normally used for electric organs. By rotating the sound, Leslie speakers produce vibrato- and tremolo-like effects, i.e., a pulsing or quivering addition to the sound (Hendrix later popularized {{the use of the}} Univibe phase shifter effects pedal, which can be set to get a roughly similar effect). [...] Next, Hendrix added a straight ("dry, without any effects") glockenspiel to underscore his vocal and guitar. [...] According to Kramer, [...] "Jimi always kept an <b>eye</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> odd instruments that would be lying about the studio" [...] and found the glockenspiel in Studio A. [...] Last to be recorded was his vocal, which was treated with sound processing techniques to give it an airy sound. [...] These have been variously described as artificial double tracking (ADT), phasing, Pultec filter equalization, and processing with a Leslie speaker.|$|E

In April 2013, Brewer revealed that Mark's return scenes had to be filmed within one week because McGregor was only in the country for a brief time. Brewer told a Press Association reporter that Kate would be [...] "torn" [...] when Mark returns.

50|$|When Want and Aldington {{were sent}} to trial for manslaughter, neither {{attempted}} to excuse themselves because of the poor weather or lack of fogmen, but rather put emphasis {{on the fact that}} the distant signal was at clear. Aldington said when the mail train was approaching Charfield, he was standing behind Want who was keeping his <b>eyes</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> signals which both saw as green. Because of this, Aldington assumed the station was clear of traffic and could proceed through to Wickwar. However, error by Button was ruled out in the investigation, since Button's signals would not be able to change the down distant due to the GWR Train occupying the section. The only possibilities were that Aldington and Want did not see the down distant, or that they saw the signal, which had been somehow set to green. The only way the latter could occur was if something heavy weighed down the cables, or if they had been sabotaged. However, no traces of either were found and the mystery remains to this day.|$|R
