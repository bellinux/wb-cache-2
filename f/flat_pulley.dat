40|$|Abstract: FEA {{is used in}} many {{analysis}} {{problems like}} structural analysis, thermal analysis, computational fluids dynamics problems etc. In this paper the maximum stress developed in a <b>flat</b> <b>pulley</b> is determined for different materials using ANSYS software. The maximum stress developed i. e. Von Mises stress is then compared for four materials in order to select best material for pulleys. The simulation stress results were compared and factor of safety was calculated {{on the basis of}} stress developed. In this present work, the stress analysis of Alumina, Al alloy 1460, Polycarbonate molded pulley is carried out to replace presently used C. I. pulley...|$|E
50|$|In the mid 19th century, British millwrights {{discovered}} that multi-grooved pulleys connected by ropes outperformed <b>flat</b> <b>pulleys</b> connected by leather belts. Wire ropes were occasionally used, but cotton, hemp, manila {{hemp and flax}} rope saw the widest use. Typically, the rope connecting two pulleys with multiple V-grooves was spliced into a single loop that traveled along a helical path before being returned to its starting position by an idler pulley that also served to maintain the tension on the rope. Sometimes, a single rope was used to transfer power from one multiple-groove drive pulley to several single- or multiple-groove driven pulleys in this way.|$|R
2500|$|Two {{generators}} [...] {{were installed}} in the beam engine house after the beam engines were removed and these were driven by the Pollit and Wigzell engine. The <b>flat</b> belt <b>pulley</b> system is still in existence. It is believed that this was used for lighting rather than running the machines.|$|R
50|$|The {{printing}} machinery {{consisted of two}} Platen type presses, used for small printing jobs such as advertising, brochures, public notice, hand-outs etc. The weekly newspaper was printed on a flat bed press, manufactured by Preston Engineering Co. Originally driven from a pulley on a shaft (which drove all the presses), it was later driven by a 2 HP three-phase electric motor. A lot of experimenting was necessary to get the correct pulley size for the motor, as the range of standard size <b>flat</b> <b>pulleys</b> was limited. One size was too small, the next size too large to drive the press at the correct speed. The problem was overcome by using the smaller size pulley and winding some thin rope around it to build {{it up to the}} correct size.|$|R
50|$|In the {{earliest}} applications power was transmitted between pulleys using loops of rope on grooved pulleys. This method is extremely rare today, dating {{mostly from the}} 18th century. Flat belts on <b>flat</b> <b>pulleys</b> or drums were the most common method during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The belts were generally tanned leather or cotton duck impregnated with rubber. Leather belts were fastened in loops with rawhide or wire lacing, lap joints and glue, or one of several types of steel fasteners. Cotton duck belts usually used metal fasteners or were melted together with heat. The leather belts were run with the hair side against the pulleys for best traction. The belts needed periodic cleaning and conditioning {{to keep them in}} good condition. Belts were often twisted 180 degrees per leg and reversed on the receiving pulley to cause the second shaft to rotate in the opposite direction.|$|R
5000|$|Most of {{the extant}} saws are {{original}} including the frame, circular break-down, number one and docking saws. The saw sharpening equipment is also original. All of this equipment {{was designed to}} be steam driven via <b>flat</b> belts and <b>pulleys.</b> The original transmission system continued to be used when the shed was first electrified: a large electric motor was simply connected to the main transmission shaft. Later, the transmission system was rendered redundant when the single large electric motor was replaced by smaller electric motors mounted directly onto each saw. As part of this upgrade, the original <b>flat</b> belts and <b>pulley</b> wheels on the saws were replaced by [...] "V" [...] belts and pulleys which transmitted drive directly from the saw mounted motors.|$|R
500|$|Aldrin entered Eagle first. With some {{difficulty}} the astronauts lifted film and two sample boxes containing [...] of lunar surface {{material to the}} LM hatch using a <b>flat</b> cable <b>pulley</b> device called the Lunar Equipment Conveyor. Armstrong reminded Aldrin of a bag of memorial items in his suit pocket sleeve, and Aldrin tossed the bag down; Armstrong then jumped to the ladder's third rung and climbed into the LM. After transferring to LM life support, the explorers lightened the ascent stage for return to lunar orbit by tossing out their PLSS backpacks, lunar overshoes, one Hasselblad camera, and other equipment. They then pressurized the LM and settled down to sleep.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{engines of}} the late-19th and early-20th centuries ran at speeds {{too low to}} drive a dynamo or {{alternator}} directly. As with other equipment, the generator was driven off the engine's flywheel by a broad <b>flat</b> belt. The <b>pulley</b> on the generator was {{much smaller than the}} flywheel, providing the required 'gearing up' effect. Later spark-ignition engines developed from the 1920s could be directly coupled.|$|R
50|$|By the 1950s, Vermeer {{introduced}} two new products, {{a portable}} PTO-powered hammermill designed to eliminate <b>flat</b> belts and <b>pulleys</b> and a self-propelled irrigation system that distributes water in large circles over crops. The Vermeer Pow-R Drive met with almost immediate success...thousands were sold. Through these early years, other small farm equipment items, {{such as a}} wagon end-gate seeder and wheel cleaner for row-crop tractors were designed and manufactured.|$|R
50|$|Horse engines {{were used}} to power farm {{implements}} and industrial processes. Examples of machines that were powered with a horse engine include the threshing machine, the corn sheller, pumps and machines for sawing wood. Horse engines were modular in {{that they could be}} attached to whichever implement they were needed for at the time, preventing these machines from needing to incorporate power sources into their design. They could also be used interchangeably with other forms of power, such as a hand crank, line shaft, stationary engine, or the PTO shaft or <b>flat</b> belt <b>pulley</b> from a tractor, which eventually replaced them. Today there are modern versions of these being built that have been used with great success to do household chores as well as power a complete Amish-run machine shop in Kentucky.|$|R
50|$|The {{main spindle}} is {{generally}} hollow to allow long bars to extend {{through to the}} work area. This reduces preparation and waste of material. The spindle runs in precision bearings and is fitted with some means of attaching workholding devices such as chucks or faceplates. This end of the spindle usually also has an included taper, frequently a Morse taper, to allow the insertion of hollow tubular (Morse standard) tapers {{to reduce the size}} of the tapered hole, and permit use of centers. On older machines ('50s) the spindle was directly driven by a <b>flat</b> belt <b>pulley</b> with lower speeds available by manipulating the bull gear. Later machines use a gear box driven by a dedicated electric motor. A fully 'geared head' allows the operator to select suitable speeds entirely through the gearbox.|$|R
40|$|A {{continuously}} variable transmission (CVT) was studied, using a novel <b>flat</b> belt <b>pulley</b> arrangement which couples the high speed output shaft of an energy storage flywheel to the drive train of an electric vehicle. A specific CVT arrangement was recommended and its components were selected and sized, based on the design requirements of a 1700 KG vehicle. A design layout was prepared and engineering calculations made of component efficiencies and operating life. The transmission efficiency was calculated to be significantly over 90 % with the expected vehicle operation. A design consistent with automotive practice for low future production costs was considered, together with maintainability. The technology advancements required to develop the flat belt CVT were identified and an estimate was made of how {{the size of the}} flat belt CVT scales to larger and smaller design output torques. The suitability of the flat belt CVT for alternate application to an electric vehicle powered by an electric motor without flywheel and to a hybrid electric vehicle powered by an electric motor with an internal combustion engine was studied...|$|R
