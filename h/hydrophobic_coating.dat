For instance, one can reduce drag forces in the system by coating the magnetite nanoparticle with hydrophobic proteins or lipids.

In order to aggressively reduce the rotational friction, the nanoresonator could be packed in an inorganic shell that completely excludes the system from the cytoplasm. The elastic protein fibers may be replaced by synthetic nanowires or nanotubes with carefully designed rigidity. For example, del Barco et al.

The formation of the larger droplet, particle adhesion to that droplet, and smaller droplet formation on the particle all take place spontaneously from condensation conditions. These micro droplet-particle pairs are confined to the surface (liquid-air interface) of the larger host droplet; however, they are free to engage with external forces to promote mobility.

40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} {{and compare the}} microleakage of self-etch adhesives placed under different clinical techniques and to analyze the resin-dentin interfacial ultrastructure under scanning electron microscope (SEM). Materials and Methods: 100 extracted human premolars {{were divided into two}} groups for different adhesives (Clearfil S 3 and Xeno III). Class V cavities were prepared. Each group was further divided into four subgroups (n = 10) according to the placement technique of the adhesive, i. e. according to manufacturer′s directions (Group 1), with phosphoric acid etching of enamel margins (Group 2), with <b>hydrophobic</b> resin <b>coat</b> application (Group 3), with techniques of both groups 2 and 3 (Group 4). The cavities were restored with composite. Ten samples from each group were subjected to microleakage study. Five samples each of both the adhesives from groups 1 and 3 were used for SEM examination of the micromorphology of the resin-dentin interface. Results: At enamel margins for both the adhesives tested, groups 2 and 4 showed significantly lesser leakage than groups 1 and 3. At dentin margins, groups 3 and 4 depicted significantly reduced leakage than groups 1 and 2 for Xeno III. SEM observation of the resin-dentin interfaces revealed generalized gap and poor resin tag formation in both the adhesives. Xeno III showed better interfacial adaptation when additional <b>hydrophobic</b> resin <b>coat</b> was applied.

40|$|This {{experiment}} evaluated {{potential benefits}} of <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>coating</b> of windshields under simulated conditions of use. The main independent variables were hydrophobic treatment, participant age, and time of day. The dependent measures were minimum visual angle resolved and response time.

This experiment showed that hydrophobic coatings can result in significantly improved driver visual performance without negatively affecting response time. However, this experiment did not address the durability or longevity of these products, as the <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>coating</b> was only tested when it was newly applied (and therefore could be expected to be near peak performance).

40|$|Thin {{dielectric}} stacks comprising a main {{insulating layer}} and a <b>hydrophobic</b> top <b>coating</b> {{are commonly used}} in low voltage electrowetting systems. However, in most cases, thin dielectrics fail to endure persistent electrowetting testing at high voltages, namely beyond the saturation onset, as electrolysis indicates dielectric failure. Careful sample inspection via optical microscopy revealed possible local delamination of the top coating under high electric fields. Thus, improvement in the adhesion strength of the <b>hydrophobic</b> top <b>coating</b> to the main dielectric is attempted through a plasma-deposited fluorocarbon interlayer. Interestingly enough the proposed dielectric stack exhibited (a) resistance to dielectric breakdown, (b) higher contact angle modulation range and (c) electrowetting cycle reversibility.

Amidoximes based on rosin as a natural product can be prepared from a reaction between hydroxylamine and rosin/acrylonitrile adducts.

A new class of monodisperse hydrophobic magnetite nanoparticles was prepared by a simple and inexpensive co-precipitation method.

The magnetic properties were determined from vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) analyses. These prepared magnetite nanoparticles were tested as bioactive nanosystems and their antimicrobial effects were investigated.

Under low humidity, the double MPLs with the hydrophilic layers using both PVA and TiO 2 are effective for conserving humidity at the catalyst layer, thereby enhancing PEFC performance.

40|$|AbstractFor polymer {{electrolyte}} {{fuel cells}} (PEFCs), a catalytic burner was proposed to convert a low energy hydrogen exhaust stream from PEFCs to water. Microreactors with Pt based catalyst coating showed their strength in safely handing the explosive mixtures of gaseous {{hydrogen and oxygen}} because dimensions of microchannel are smaller than quenching distance of hydrogen. However, the induction period was usually {{a long time for}} obtaining a high hydrogen conversion. Unfortunately, this induction time is difficult to be achieved for PEFCs because the hydrogen discharge is in pulse. To ignite the hydrogen oxidation at room temperature, a Pt-Al 2 O 3 <b>hydrophobic</b> catalyst <b>coating</b> was firstly produced via grafting the support of alumina by 1 H, 1 H, 2 H, 2 H-Tridecafluoro-n-octyltriethoxysilane (FAS). The Pt-Al 2 O 3 hydrophobic catalyst showed significantly higher activity than that without hydrophobic modification. It was found that, for the catalyst of Pt-Al 2 O 3, the support hydrophobicity prevented most of adsorbed water on the support which results in only a slight decrease in activity.

40|$|For many centuries, {{researchers}} {{have investigated the}} complex interactions between a solid surface and a fluid in motion relative to the surface. For many cases, the classical no slip boundary condition holds true. However, there are a subset of situations where this assumption is not valid, and slip between the surface and fluid must be considered. One such example is a micropatterned, superhydrophobic surface, which {{has been shown to}} enable slip resulting in a decrease in drag and pressure loss for both laminar and turbulent flow. The hydrodynamic effects of these surfaces have been studied in depth, but the effects on heat transfer are largely unknown. The primary goal of this research effort was to explore the effects of slip flow on laminar convective heat transfer resulting from micropatterned, superhydrophobic surfaces. The first step toward achieving the research goal was to develop a model to study first order effects, predict the effect of slip flow on heat transfer, and design the experimental setup. The general momentum equation for Poiseuille flow was solved using modified boundary conditions consistent with slip flow, and the resulting velocity profile was input into the thermal balance equation which was numerically solved. The model assumed hydrodynamic slip but not thermal slip nor a temperature jump at the boundary, and as a result, it predicted a net increase in heat transfer performance. For the experimental portion of the study, laminar Poiseuille flow in a parallel plate configuration with a constant temperature boundary condition at 273 K using an ice bath was studied. Four sets of copper sample plates measuring 15 cm by 3. 8 cm were fabricated with different surface condition: 1) uncoated smooth, 2) <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>coated</b> smooth, 3) uncoated micropatterned, and 4) <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>coated</b> micropatterned. The micropattern was a laser machined array of 25 m x 25 m microridges oriented in the streamwise direction. Contact angle measurements were made on all of the test samples to ensure the <b>coated</b> plates were <b>hydrophobic</b> and the uncoated plates were not. From the experimental results, several observations and conclusions were made. First, only the micropatterned, superhydrophobic coated sample achieved a slip state with an average slip length of 0. 3 mm. Second, hydrodynamic slip was observed without the accompaniment of thermal slip since the heat transfer performance for the superhydrophobic sample was as good as or better than the baseline sample for all flow rates tested. Finally, it was concluded that micropatterned superhydrophobic surfaces reduce pressure loss and improve heat transfer as seen by the improved efficiency factor, which is the ratio between the Nusselt number and the friction loss.
