5|$|The {{ultimate}} {{cause of}} Argentina’s historical backwardness {{appears to be}} its institutional framework. In macroeconomic terms, Argentina {{was one of the}} most stable and conservative countries until the Great Depression, after which <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> one of the most unstable.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 1930s, {{however, the}} Argentine economy {{deteriorated}} notably. The {{single most important}} factor in this decline has been political instability since 1930, when a military junta took power, ending seven decades of civilian constitutional government. In macroeconomic terms, Argentina {{was one of the most}} stable and conservative countries until the Great Depression, after which <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> one of the most unstable. Despite this, up until 1962 the Argentine GDP per capita was higher than of Austria, Italy, Japan and of its former colonial master, Spain. Successive governments from the 1930s to the 1970s pursued a strategy of import substitution to achieve industrial self-sufficiency, but the government's encouragement of industrial growth diverted investment from agricultural production, which fell dramatically.|$|E
5|$|Just as they {{finished}} their report, the detachment was fired on by Ustaše Militia. The Ustaše called {{for help from}} Sinj, and by 18:00, Italian reinforcements had arrived and began encircling the detachment, engaging them with mortars and light artillery. Outnumbered and facing an enemy with greater firepower, the Partisans planned to hold their positions until evening then retreat using the cover of darkness. About 20:00, Kovačević-Lala, {{one of the most}} experienced members of the detachment, was killed after being hit by a mortar round, which had a significant effect on the morale of the remaining fighters. Borovčić-Kurir issued the order to retreat, but <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> chaos as individuals fled the area.|$|E

5|$|The X-Files {{was a hit}} for the Fox {{network and}} {{received}} largely positive reviews, although its long-term story arc was criticized near the conclusion. Initially considered a cult series, <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> a pop culture touchstone that tapped into public mistrust of governments and large institutions and embraced conspiracy theories and spirituality. Both the series itself and lead actors Duchovny and Anderson received multiple awards and nominations, {{and by the end}} it was the longest-running science fiction series in U.S. television history. The series also spawned a franchise which includes The Lone Gunmen spin-off, two theatrical films and accompanying merchandise. After the final theatrical film in 2008, fans continued to push for a third movie to conclude the series' plot lines, and in March 2015, Fox eventually announced that the series would return, with Chris Carter as executive producer and writer, and Duchovny, Anderson, Pileggi, Davis, and Gish all reprising their roles.|$|E

25|$|In 1826, Heligoland {{became a}} seaside spa and soon <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> a popular tourist resort for the European upper-class.

More vitally {{it was a}} refuge for revolutionaries of the 1830s and the 1848 German revolution.|$|E

The first hotel constructed, the Hotel Viola, dated {{to the first}} part of the 20th century, and was expanded after 1932, when the space became too small to support the influx of travellers. In 1936, the Hotel Bela Vista was constructed as total tourists began to exceed a thousand people annually. <b>It</b> <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> a popular destination for sport fishing, and among popular nautical sports, jet skiing, sailing, windsurfing, diving and dolphin watching.|$|E

25|$|The {{contract}} was cancelled in 1974 due to defence cuts {{in favour of}} work on Skyflash, but retained as a technology demonstration program. In 1977, eight test missiles were fired {{from the ground and}} from a Hawker Hunter F.6 (RAF serial XG210). The trials were successful, with one famous incident demonstrating the missile's maneuverability when <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> the Hunter's flight path immediately after launch and almost collided with it. In the same year, the British MOD chose the AIM-9L Sidewinder as its next short-range missile, but the SRAAM project was kept alive to provide a base for a future missile design.|$|E

Today we have The QUADRUPED Series, a group of competitions that are a points championship in the United States. The popularity has been so great within the frisbee dog world that it has spread to Europe where it has occurred in several countries.|$|E
