50|$|A barbed <b>wire</b> steel <b>cage</b> {{match is}} one of any number of matches that uses strands of barbed wire in some capacity. Simply using barbed wire in an {{otherwise}} regular steel cage match {{does not make the}} match a barbed <b>wire</b> steel <b>cage</b> match; the barbed wire must be part of the match's design. Another variations are the Razor <b>Wire</b> Steel <b>Cage</b> Match, a similar concept to that of the barbed <b>wire</b> <b>cage</b> match, however the barbed wire is replaced by razor wire and is wrapped around the top, corners, and walls of the <b>cage,</b> and Barbed <b>wire</b> Razor <b>wire</b> Steel <b>Cage</b> match {{is the same as the}} barbed <b>wire</b> <b>cage</b> match, however the top, corners, and walls of the cage are covered with barbed wire, further covered with razor wire.|$|R

2500|$|The cables were {{constructed}} by an aerial spinning process. The process involved drawing wires from a constant-tension supply, and pulling loops of these wires from one anchorage to the other, {{passing through a}} 500-tonne cast-iron saddle {{on top of each}} bridge tower seating the cable. A total of 70,000 <b>galvanised</b> <b>wires</b> of [...] diameter were placed and adjusted to form the two [...] diameter main cables.|$|R
50|$|Haste {{went on to}} {{graduate}} from the Royal College of Art, where she first became interested in <b>wire</b> sculpture, using <b>galvanised</b> <b>wire</b> mesh over a steel armature, later on using the wire mesh as sculpting material on its own for indoor work. Haste's sculptures are generally created by building up many layers of wire mesh over the steel armature skeleton, spray finished with enamel paint.|$|R
5000|$|When {{applied to}} the fusor Lawson's {{analysis}} is used as an argument that conduction and radiation losses are the key impediment to reaching net power. Fusors use a voltage drop to accelerate and collide ions, resulting in fusion. [...] The voltage drop is generated by <b>wire</b> <b>cages,</b> and these cages conduct away particles. Polywell are improvements on this design, designed to reduce conduction losses by removing the <b>wire</b> <b>cages</b> which cause them. [...] Regardless, {{it is argued that}} radiation is still a major impediment.|$|R

5000|$|... "Separate Ways" [...] - Burke {{shows how}} to get from sugar to atomic weapons by two totally {{independent}} paths. The first involves African slaves, Abolitionist societies, Sampson Lloyd II, <b>wire,</b> suspension bridges, <b>galvanised</b> <b>wire,</b> settlement of the Wild West, barbed wire, canned corn, and cadmium. The second path involves sweet tea, rum, a double boiler, the steam engine, Matthew Boulton, English currency, the pantograph, electroplating, and cathode ray tubes.|$|R

50|$|His mask {{was similar}} to what a {{baseball}} catcher wore. It was made of leather, and had a <b>wire</b> <b>cage</b> to protect the face. Honma wore glasses when in nets, and the <b>wire</b> <b>cage</b> had two circular eyeholes designed to fit over the glasses and to be narrower than the puck. Honma played both of Japan's two games. He lost his first game 3-0 against Great Britain, who {{would go on to}} win the gold medal. He lost his second game against Sweden, 2-0. Both of the games were played outdoors, and snowstorms caused interruptions in the game.|$|R

25|$|In fusors, the {{potential}} well {{is made with}} a <b>wire</b> <b>cage.</b> Because most of the ions and electrons fall into the cage, fusors suffer from high conduction losses. Hence, no fusor has come close to energy break-even.|$|R

50|$|Wire-top cages {{typically}} are designed {{in such a}} way that there is some option for the hamster to climb on some of the <b>wire.</b> Plastic <b>cages</b> do not have bars on which the hamster can climb, but can be expanded with plastic tubes for climbing. <b>Wire</b> <b>cages</b> can expose a hamster to drafts, and additionally, some <b>wire</b> <b>cages</b> permit the hamster to throw bedding material through the wires as it burrows, digs, and plays. Pens with solid walls contain all the bedding, and additionally, prevent drafts of air from disturbing the hamster. Syrian hamsters are larger than Chinese and dwarf hamsters, so they need a larger pen and hamster accessories than those smaller hamsters. Hamster tubes come in two sizes also - smaller ones suit dwarf and Chinese hamsters of any age, while larger tubes are comfortable for Syrian hamster adults but too big for small hamsters to use.|$|R
50|$|Siddiqui {{told the}} New York Times that in Kandahar, detainees were packed into <b>wire</b> <b>cages</b> {{and forced to}} use a bucket as a toilet in front of other detainees. He also said {{soldiers}} threw stones and bottles at detainees.|$|R
5000|$|John Lawson {{used this}} {{equation}} to estimate some conditions for net power {{based on a}} Maxwellian cloud. [...] This became the Lawson criterion. Fusors typically suffer from conduction losses due to the <b>wire</b> <b>cage</b> being {{in the path of}} the recirculating plasma.|$|R
50|$|About 1880 {{the first}} {{telephone}} line to connect Kawhia with Hamilton came via Waitetuna, Kauroa and Te Mata. In 1914 the Te Mata Telephone Association {{was joined by}} 40 settlers linked to the exchange at the local store operated 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., but with a 24-hour service for local calls. It went into liquidation in 1927 when the new post office, lines and exchange were built with 64 subscribers. The old lines had small insulators, <b>galvanised</b> <b>wire,</b> cheap poles and a single wire earth system. The exchange was automated in 1970.|$|R
50|$|On 29 December 1859 {{the newly}} {{constructed}} telegraph line {{was brought into}} use, the line was built generally alongside the Great Western Road from Sydney to Bathurst and was constructed of timber poles with one <b>galvanised</b> <b>wire</b> tied to insulators on each pole. At several intermediate points along the route a telegraph repeater station was located, including Parramatta, Penrith, Katoomba and Hartley. At the intermediate repeater stations an operator manually retyped the message, passing it through that location. The system operated on the earth return principle whereby the circuit started at a large battery at one end (end A), via a morse key used by the telegraph operator, passed along the <b>galvanised</b> iron <b>wire</b> attached to the poles, then through the morse instrument {{at the far end}} (end B) and returned to the battery (at end A) through the ground (earth). This was a cheap method of construction requiring only one wire and no pole crossarms.|$|R
50|$|In {{later years}} {{it came to}} be {{associated}} with Highland dress, and in the 19th century gave rise to other types of largely military headgear such as the more elaborate Balmoral bonnet, Tam o' shanter, and (with the addition of a <b>wire</b> <b>cage)</b> the military feather bonnet.|$|R

40|$|Strengthening {{concrete}} {{members to}} improve the load carrying capacity and ductility at an economic cost has constantly been a challenge. This study aims to evaluate {{the effects of the}} conventional repair materials, mortar and <b>galvanised</b> <b>wire</b> mesh and mortar composite (MGWM) on the overall behaviours of confined concrete columns. The investigation was carried out on medium strength concrete (MSC) and normal strength concrete (NSC), respectively. Two methods were used to install the mesh reinforcement: cast integrally with concrete and wrapped to precast concrete core. The first method was applied to MSC specimens while the second was adopted for NSC cylinders...|$|R
50|$|New {{problems}} came in 1931 {{during the}} Great Depression; Wärtsilä's financial situation got alarming {{and it was}} on verge of bankruptcy. The trading was stopped in Helsinki stock exchange. But two factors saved the company; the first one was <b>galvanised</b> <b>wire</b> production, which Wärtsilä had started right before the depression as the first company in the Nordic Countries. The second one was the company personnel which agreed about lowering of salaries in order to save the company. Already in 1932 Wärtsilä could pay dividend to its shareholders and the same trend continued in the following years.|$|R
60|$|Katie {{was sixteen}} then, {{and she had}} just been given the cashier job, as a treat. She wanted to do {{something}} to help the old man, so he put her on a high chair behind a <b>wire</b> <b>cage</b> with a hole in it, and she gave the customers their change. And let me tell you, mister, that a man that wasn't satisfied after he'd had me serve him a dinner cooked by Jules and then had a chat with Katie through the <b>wire</b> <b>cage</b> would have groused at Paradise. For she was pretty, was Katie, and getting prettier every day. I spoke to the boss about it. I said it was putting temptation in the girl's way to set her up there right in the public eye, as it were. And he told me to hop it. So I hopped it.|$|R
