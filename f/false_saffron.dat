500|$|Lactarius deterrimus, {{also known}} as <b>false</b> <b>saffron</b> milkcap or orange milkcap, is a species of fungus in the family Russulaceae. The fungus {{produces}} medium-sized fruit bodies (mushrooms) with orangish caps up to [...] wide that develop green spots in old age or if injured. Its orange-coloured latex stains maroon within 30minutes. Lactarius deterrimus is a mycorrhizal fungus that associates with Norway spruce and bearberry. The species is distributed in Europe, but has also found in parts of Asia. A visually similar species in the United States and Mexico is not {{closely related to the}} European species. Fruit bodies appear between late June and November, usually in spruce forests. [...] Although the fungus is edible—like all Lactarius mushrooms from the section Deliciosi—its taste is often bitter, and it is not highly valued. The fruit bodies are used as source of food for the larvae of several insect species. Lactarius deterrimus can be distinguished from similar Lactarius species by difference in the mycorrhizal host or latex colour.|$|E
