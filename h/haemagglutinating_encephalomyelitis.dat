40|$|From 1985 to 1988, a {{total of}} 2496 swine sera from 60 farms in the Tohoku District of the Honshu Island of Japan were {{examined}} for antibodies to swine <b>haemagglutinating</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> virus (HEV), human coronavirus (HCV) and bovine coronavirus (BCV) by haemagglutination-inhibition (HI) test. Antibodies to HEV 67 N strain and HCV OC 43 strain were highly prevalent with positivity rates of 82. 1 and 91. 4 %, respectively, while seropositivity rate to BCV Kakegawa strain was 44. 2 %. No clinical signs of HEV infection were noticed in any farms including farms with relatively high seropositivity. The results suggested that HCV or antigenitically related virus(es) as well as HEV might be perpetuated in swine in the Tohoku District...|$|E
40|$|Precipitating {{antibodies}} against {{transmissible gastroenteritis}} viral antigens were detected by the immunodiffusion test in two transmissible gastroenteritis viral hyperimmune antisera and in antiserum prepared against <b>haemagglutinating</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> virus {{but not in}} sera from several species of normal animals, in antisera prepared against a variety of othet viruses and bacteria or sera from swine with bacterial enteritis. When the immunodiffusion test was compared with the virus neutralization test {{for the detection of}} transmissible gastroeneritis viral antibodies in 20 swine sera certain samples which contained high titres of virus neutralizing antibodies failed to produce precipitation while other sera were positive in the immunodiffusion test although their virus neutralizing antibody titres were relatively low. Precipitating antibodies were also detected by immunodiffusion in several samples of milk whey from a sow which had been vaccinated with inactivated transmissible gastroenteritis virus...|$|E
40|$|The {{complete}} {{nucleotide sequence}} of the ns 2 gene of human coronavirus OC 43 (HCV-OC 43) was deter-mined. Sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame that could encode a protein of 278 amino acids, with an estimated molecular mass of 32. 2 kDa. Six potential phosphorylation sites are present but no sites of N-glycosylation were found. The amino acid {{sequence of the}} HCV-OC 43 ns 2 protein shows 92 % identity {{with that of the}} Mebus strain of bovine coronavirus (BCV). However, a stretch of nine consecutive amino acids near the C terminus is completely different, causing it to be very hydrophilic, which contrasts with the hydrophobic nature of this region in BCV. As shown by immuno-fluorescence with a monospecific antiserum, the ns 2 protein was expressed in the cytoplasm of HCV-OC 43 -infected HRT- 18 cells. Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses that contain a single-stranded positive sense RNA genome of 27 to 31 kb (Boursnell et al., 1987; Lee et al., 1991). The genomic RNA encodes ix to eight capped and poly-adenylated subgenomic mRNAs that are arranged in a T-coterminal nested set structure. Each mRNA possesses a common 5 ' end leader sequence derived from the 5 ' end of the genomic RNA. It has been suggested that the interaction of the 3 ' end of the leader sequence with the full-length minus strand genomic RNA, at the consensus intergenic sequences, initiates the synthesis of sub-genomic mRNAs of diverse lengths (Lai, 1990). Human coronaviruses (HCV) have so far been repre-sented by two prototype strains, OC 43 and 229 E, which belong to two distinct antigenic groups. HCV-OC 43 shares antigenicity with bovine coronavirus (BCV), <b>haemagglutinating</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> v rus of swine (HEV) and murine hepatitis virus (MHV). HCV- 229 E is antigenically related o porcine transmissible gastroen-teritis virus (TGEV) and canine coronavirus (CCV). Human coronaviruses are responsible for 15 to 35 % o...|$|E
40|$|Porcine Periweaning Failure-to-Thrive {{syndrome}} (PFTS) is {{a clinical}} syndrome of newly weaned pigs with unknown etiology and characterized by anorexia, lethargy and progressive debilitation. The hypothesis of this thesis is that PFTS is an infectious disease. Investigation in an index farm affected by PFTS from Saskatchewan Canada ruled out most common swine pathogens as the etiology and identified several lesions that were consistent across many cases. A larger study including multiple farms in North America was then undertaken. A total of 8 farms were investigated, within which 5 met the clinical definition of PFTS. Gross and histological examinations {{were performed on}} 8 case and 4 control pigs on each farm. Detection of relevant porcine pathogens, complete blood count, serum chemistry, and serum cytokine analysis were performed on each pig. Thymic atrophy, superficial gastritis and small intestinal villous atrophy were significantly more prevalent in case pigs compared to control pigs. All case pigs had {{at least two of}} these three lesions. All case and control pigs were negative for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, swine influenza virus and were free of porcine circovirus associated diseases. Although several pathogens, such as porcine cytomegalovirus, <b>haemagglutinating</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> virus, porcine enteric calicivirus, group A rotavirus, enteroviruses and Cystoisospora suis were detected in some of the case and control pigs, none were associated with clinical status. Clinical pathology findings of case pigs was consistent with anorexia and dehydration, such as increases in haematocrit, blood urea, serum bilirubin, albumin, beta-hydroxybutyrate and decreases in blood glucose, calcium and phosphorous. Case pigs had similar levels to IL 1 -Î² than control pigs, which suggested that PFTS was not a result of excessive cytokines. In subsequent experiments, a snatched-farrowed porcine-colostrum-deprived (SF-pCD) pig model was developed and tissue homogenates were used to inoculate SF-pCD pigs in an attempt to reproduce the clinical signs of PFTS. The SF-pCD pigs were immunologically characterized and shown to be suitable for inoculation studies. However, inoculation of tissue homogenate from PFTS pigs failed to reproduce the clinical signs of PFTS in SF-pCD pigs. All together, PFTS is a clinical syndrome with consistent pathological and serum analytical changes among affected pigs. Despite the efforts of this research to establish an infectious etiology, {{there is a lack of}} evidence that PFTS is an infectious disease...|$|E
