First described by the mycologist Charles Horton Peck, this bulbous-stemmed edible species smells slightly of anise, and turns yellow when bruised or cut. The mushroom is medium-sized, with a white, yellow-staining cap on a slender stipe that has a wide, <b>flat</b> <b>bulb</b> on the base ...|$|R

50|$|The scissor <b>section</b> <b>flat</b> is a {{distinctive}} way of arranging the flats {{in an apartment}} block that {{was developed in the}} 1950s by London County Council Architects department. The interlocking design provides a way of maximising the space given to flats in any building volume by reducing the space needed for entrance corridors and providing a dual aspect for each dwelling, but the design does have accessibility issues and the complex arrangement has caused confusion for emergency services.|$|R

5000|$|By January 1906, {{under intense}} pressure, the Department of Railways and Canals ordered Walsh to present {{plans for the}} {{dredging}} of the <b>Holland,</b> <b>section</b> 1, as soon as possible. He had originally specified this to be [...] deep, but Butler overruled him and ordered them to be dredged to , {{the same as the}} rest of the Trent system. Walsh returned the plans in the middle of February and on 18 April 1906 the dredging contract for $46,487 was won by The Lake Simcoe Dredging Company. This company was formed primarily by E.S. Cane and Dr. Philip Spohn of the Penetanguishene Asylum for the Insane, neither of whom had any experience in dredging.|$|R

An early use of the design was in the large riverside towers of the Pepys Estate in Deptford, and {{in a number of}} council housing schemes across London in the 1960s and early 1970s including Maydew House, Kelson House and Perronet House. Some similar designs for council tower blocks are found in other cities in England.|$|R

50|$|The Geheimrat was a wood framed {{aircraft}} with {{a rectangular}} cross <b>section,</b> <b>flat</b> sided, plywood covered fuselage. In plan it tapered only slightly but the depth decreased rapidly towards the tail, making the fuselage behind the wing strongly wedge shaped. The wing was mounted on two extensions {{at the highest}} point, with an open, unscreened cockpit below its leading edge behind a more rounded nose. A pair short skids attached directly {{to the edges of}} the fuselage underside acted as the undercarriage, aided by a short tailskid at the rear.|$|R

The P level flats are a later 1980s addition but all the flats above it are split level scissor <b>section</b> <b>flats,</b> arranged over three primary floors and wrapped around a central communal corridor. This provides each flat with a dual aspect unobstructed by external corridors more usually found on high rise social housing in the area.|$|R

For special events, the Supermoto track may incorporate metal ramps for jumps that can be disassembled and taken to other locations. [...] Supermoto races may take place at modified go-kart tracks, road racing tracks, or even street racing tracks. There are also classes for kids such as the 85cc class.|$|R

On the other hand at the present epochs of the Universe the spin-torsion contribution is more efficient in the matter perturbation. Stability of the Friedmann solution in Einstein-Cartan cosmology is also discussed. Comment: Latex fil...|$|R
50|$|Rack railway {{switches}} are {{as varied}} as rack railway technologies, for optional rack lines such as the Zentralbahn in Switzerland and the West Coast Wilderness Railway in Tasmania it is convenient to only use switches on <b>sections</b> <b>flat</b> enough for adhesion (for example, on a pass summit). Other systems which rely on the rack for driving (with the conventional rail wheels undriven) such as the Dolderbahn in Zurich, Štrbské Pleso in Slovakia and the Schynige Platte rack railway instead must switch the rack rail. The Dolderbahn switch works by bending all three rails, an operation that is performed every trip as the two trains pass in the middle.|$|R

50|$|Lakanal House is a 14-storey {{tower block}} that forms {{part of the}} Sceaux Gardens Estate, Camberwell. Lakanal House {{contains}} 98 flats, and is 137 ft high. The building dates from 1959. It {{is made up of}} two-bedroom maisonettes of a distinctive two-storey interlocking design (scissor <b>section</b> <b>flat).</b> The flats are entered from the right or left side of a central access corridor. On the access level, there are two bedrooms and a bathroom. There are stairs to the upper level where a lounge and kitchen stretch across the full width of the block. This means that the lounge for each flat is above one of the bedrooms of that flat and one of the bedrooms of the flat {{on the opposite side of}} the access corridor. The flats were built with fire exits from the lounge and the kitchen to 'exit balconies' on either side of the building, and also a fire exit from the largest bedroom into the central access corridor, separate from the front door.|$|R
