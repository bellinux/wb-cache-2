5|$|Victor Fresco, the show's creator, has cited {{his being}} a new parent as {{inspiration}} for the show. In an interview with NPR, he discussed how having a kid piqued his interest to develop a show about the disconnection between a person's public and personal lives, such as how parents teach their <b>kids</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> moral, yet work for giant corporations. According to Fresco, Ted Crisp is the single father and his daughter serves as his moral compass. Fresco stated that since he's worked for a few giant companies, he didn't base Veridian Dynamics on any specific corporation. The show's name {{was based on the}} idea that a person is better off if they are Ted, that essentially the average person wants to be Ted. Fresco has stated that he wasn't a fan of the show's title, but hadn't spoken of changing it.|$|E
500|$|The puppeteers' {{performances}} and the show's {{approach to teaching}} fundamental life skills have been praised by critics. Common Sense Media reviewer Andrea Graham gave the show a five-star review, writing that [...] "when it comes to preschool programming, Oobi really breaks the mold, succeeding in its simplicity." [...] The Coalition for Quality Children's Media wrote positively of Oobi, complimenting its concept and calling it [...] "thoroughly enjoyable" [...] and [...] "extremely well received." [...] Diana Dawson of the Herald-Journal found the show's old-fashioned look appealing, stating that [...] "in a world that too often forgets the innocent joy of playing kick-the-can and catching fireflies, there's something incredibly endearing about the bare-handed puppetry." [...] DVD Talk's Holly Ordway was unimpressed with the series' simplicity, but admitted in her review that it was [...] "a clever way to encourage <b>kids</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> imaginative." [...] Ryan Ball of Animation Magazine described the show as [...] "an offbeat new entry" [...] to Noggin's lineup, adding that [...] "the fact that all the characters are played by hands just adds to the quirkiness." [...] In 2010, Babble.com listed Oobi second on their list of top twelve television series for babies and toddlers.|$|E
500|$|Take Off Your Pants and Jacket {{has been}} called a concept album chronicling {{adolescence}} and associated feelings. The band did not consider them explicitly teenage songs: [...] "The things that happen to you in high school are the same things that happen your entire life," [...] said Hoppus. [...] "You can fall in love at sixty; you can get rejected at eighty." [...] The record begins with [...] "Anthem Part Two", which touches on disenchantment and blames adults for teenage problems. It serves as the opposite of the band's typical [...] "party" [...] image presented to the media, with heavily politically-charged lyrics. Joe Shooman called it a [...] "generational manifesto that exhorts <b>kids</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> wary of the system that surrounds them". [...] "Online Songs" [...] was written by Hoppus about [...] "the thoughts that drive you crazy" [...] {{in the aftermath of a}} breakup, and is essentially a follow-up to [...] "Josie". [...] "First Date" [...] was inspired by DeLonge and wife Jennifer Jenkins' first date at SeaWorld in San Diego. [...] "I was about 21 at the time and it was an excuse for me to take her somewhere because I wanted to hang out with her," [...] said DeLonge. The track was written as a summary of neurotic teen angst and awkwardness. [...] "Happy Holidays, You Bastard" [...] is a joke track intended to [...] "piss parents off." [...] The fifth track, [...] "Story of a Lonely Guy", concerns heartache and rejection prior to the high school prom. The song is downbeat and melancholy, filtered through [...] "tuneful guitar lines reminiscent of The Cure and hefty drum patterns".|$|E

2500|$|Preventing {{obesity and}} {{overweight}} conditions presents a significant opportunity to reduce costs. The Centers for Disease Control reported that approximately 9% of healthcare costs in 1998 were attributable to overweight and obesity, or {{as much as}} $93 billion in 2002 dollars.

The CDC released a series of strategies to prevent obesity and overweight, including: making healthy foods and beverages more available; supporting healthy food choices; encouraging <b>kids</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more active; and creating safe communities to support physical activity. An estimated 26% of U.S. adults in 2007 were obese, versus 24% in 2005. State obesity rates ranged from 18% to 30%. Obesity rates were roughly equal among men and women. Some have proposed a so-called [...] "fat tax" [...] to provide incentives for healthier behavior, either by levying the tax on products (such as soft drinks) that are thought to contribute to obesity, or to individuals based on body measures, as is done in Japan.|$|E
