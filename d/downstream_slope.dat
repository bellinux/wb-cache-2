40|$|Abstract: Twelve {{years of}} upper air data and surface {{observations}} across Iceland {{are used to}} investigate {{the connection between the}} difference of surface air temperature upstream and downstream of the Icelandic highlands and several parameters of the airflow, such as precipitation, static stability and wind speed. The data does not support the well-known concept of the heat of the foehn being a result of latent heating. In the winter, warm air, descending from above the upstream boundary layer appears to be responsible for the downslope heating. There is little correlation between the upstream wind speed and the upstream-downstream temperature difference. This is explained by weak winds contributing to low level upstream blocking and descent from upper levels in the lee, while strong winds contribute directly to vertical mixing through mechanical turbulence. The annual cycle of temperature difference between the upstream and the <b>downstream</b> <b>slopes</b> indicates that in the summer, solar heating over the <b>downstream</b> <b>slopes</b> is responsible for a substantial part of the heating of the foehn...|$|R

This novel work {{was an attempt to}} increase energy dissipation on stepped spillways since it not include stilling basin and have less cost compared with traditional spillways. So, in this paper, to investigate the increasing of energy dissipation of flow over stepped spillways of different step shapes, a twelve physical plywood models have been built. Experiments have been carried out for different types of step shapes: - plain steps, steps have half cut, inclined end sill steps normal to <b>downstream</b> <b>slopes</b> of stepped face, and steps have a rough surface using crushed gravel. Three <b>downstream</b> <b>slopes</b> of stepped face (è = 30 o, 50 o, and 70 o) were tested with spillway having constant number of steps and constant height. In total, 144 experiments were done, the hydraulic parameters of flow over the models were measured and the energy dissipation of flow was calculated. Experimental results showed that the energy dissipation of flow on inclined end sill, and rough steps are more than the plain one. While the experiments results on the cutting steps showed that the energy dissipation are less than the plain one. With decreasing the <b>downstream</b> <b>slopes</b> of the stepped spillway face, the energy dissipation is increased. In addition, when compared with traditional spillways the case of rough steps and steps with inclined end sill can be used to increase the relative energy dissipation on plain steps by about 19 % and about 18 % respectively for small angle of spillway face since the stepped spillways more effective than traditional spillways by 10 %. Therefore, double that means that the affectivity of stepped spillway was approximately. On the other side, the energy dissipation increased at low discharges by 0. 1 % when using the cutting steps but decreased by 13 % with larger discharges. In summary, the flow energy dissipation decreases with increasing the flow rate, and the roughed step spillway surface is more effective compared to the other spillway surfaces at low or high flow rate. According to the flow types, the range of Nappe, Transition, and Skimming will increase for all the forms of steps that used compare with plain step...|$|R

An embankment dam is one but important of them and may lead to large financial losses, floods and mortality {{in the case of}} failure. During Earthquake, one of the main dangers that threaten an embankment is liquefaction. The phenomenon of liquefaction summarized as loose of saturated sands, gravels, or silts having a contractive structure and it may occur when such materials are subjected to earthquake`s shear deformations due to increasing pore water pressure. Liquefaction induced ground deformation and building settlements were severe and widespread during the 1990 Manjil, Iran earthquake [1]. But the first fundamental observation of damages attributed to liquefaction was made in the 1964 Niigata, Japan and 1964 Alaska, North America earthquakes.

GCS with steep (≥ 1 : 4 rise : run) <b>downstream</b> <b>slopes</b> severely limited fish passage, but GCS with gentle slopes (≤ 1 : 15) allowed greater passage.

Flows through rockfill embankments can be used in some cases to reduce the peak flow as discussed in the article. There are however other applications of seepage flows through rockfill structures. 1 - Flow through a rockfill dam is a type of flood water release (i. e. spillway use). It can occur with concrete-faced rockfill (CFR) dams or with in-built spillway dam (fig. 1). Several researchers (e. g. PARKIN et al. 1966, OLIVIER 1967) discussed the interactions between the seepage flow through the rockfill and the overflow. In Australia, rockfill dams with in-built spillways have been used since the 1950 's. ALLEN (1984) and LAWSON (1987) described several prototype experiences. 2 - Flow through a rockfill embankment might occur also during the construction of a rockfill structure (e. g. a dam).
