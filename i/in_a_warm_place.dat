60|$|Bidding {{farewell}} to Abbotsford, I cannot but confess a sentiment of remorse for having visited the dwelling-place--as just before I visited {{the grave of}} the mighty minstrel and romancer with so cold a heart and in so critical a mood,--his dwelling-place and his grave whom I had so admired and loved, and who had done so much for my happiness when I was young. But I, and the world generally, now look at him from {{a different point of}} view; and, besides, these visits to the actual haunts of famous people, though long dead, have the effect of making us sensible, in some degree, of their human imperfections, as if we actually saw them alive. I felt this effect, to a certain extent, even with respect to Shakespeare, when I visited Stratford-on-Avon. As for Scott, I still cherish him <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> <b>place,</b> and I do not know that I have any pleasanter anticipation, as regards books, than that of reading all his novels over again after we get back to the Wayside.|$|E

60|$|The Eggs of Silk-worms (one {{of which}} I have describ'd {{in the second}} Figure of 25. Scheme) afford a pretty Object for a Microscope that magnifies very much, {{especially}} if it be bright weather, and {{the light of a}} window be cast or collected on it by a deep Convex-glass, or Water-ball. For then the whole surface of the Shell may be perceiv'd all cover'd over with exceeding small pits or cavities with interposed edges, almost in the manner of the surface of a Poppy-seed, but that these holes are not an hundredth part scarce of their bigness; the Shell, when the young ones were hatch'd (which I found an easie thing to do, if the Eggs were kept <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> <b>place)</b> appear'd no thicker in proportion to its bulk, then that of an Hen's or Goos's Egg is to its bulk, and all the Shell appear'd very white (which seem'd to proceed from its transparency) whence all those pittings did almost vanish, so that they could not, without much difficulty, be discern'd, the inside of the Shell seem'd to be lin'd also with a kind of thin film, not unlike (keeping the proportion to its Shell) that with which the shell of an Hen-egg is lin'd; and the shell it self seem'd like common Egg-shells; very brittle, and crack'd. In divers other of these Eggs I could plainly enough, through the shell, perceive the small Insect lie coyled round the edges of the shell. The shape of the Egg it self, the Figure pretty well represents (though by default of the Graver it does not appear so rounded, and lying above the Paper, as it were, as it ought to do) that is, it was for the most part pretty oval end-ways, somewhat like an Egg, but the other way it was a little flatted on two opposite sides. Divers of these Eggs, as is common to most others, I found to be barren, or addle, for they never afforded any young ones. And those I usually found much whiter then the other that were prolifick. The Eggs of other kinds of Oviparous Insects I have found to be perfectly round every way, like so many Globules, of this sort I have observ'd some sorts of Spiders Eggs; and chancing the last Summer to inclose a very large and curiously painted Butterfly in a Box, intending to examine its gaudery with my Microscope, I found within a day or two after I inclos'd her, almost all the inner surface of the Box cover'd over with an infinite of exactly round Eggs, which were stuck very fast to the sides of it, and in so exactly regular and close an order, that made me call to mind my Hypothesis, which I had formerly thought on for the making out of all the regular Figures of Salt, which I have elsewhere hinted; for here I found all of them rang'd into a most exact triagonal order, much after the manner as the Hemispheres are place on the eye of a Fly; all which Eggs I found after a little time to be hatch'd, and out of them to come a multitude of small Worms, very much resembling young Silk-worms, leaving all their thin hollow shells behind them, sticking on the Box in their triagonal posture; these I found with the Microscope to have much such a substance as the Silk-worms Eggs, but could not perceive them pitted. And indeed, there is as great a variety {{in the shape of the}} Eggs of Oviparous Insects as among those of Birds.|$|E

In all Seasons of the year, no significant differences occurred between the mean number of scales on leaves on the south and west sides ofthe trees. The highest mean number of scales on a single leaf(5. 9 individuals) was recorded on leaves on the west, and the lowest (4. 15) on leaves on the north side. The highest population always occurred on the west side except during winter when leaves on the south had a higher number of scales. Crawlers seemed to prefer settling <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>warmer</b> <b>place</b> during cold weather. In spring, leaves had the highest population (7. 15 individuals/leaf), followed by leaves in winter (6. 38). The lowest number (2. 59) was recorded on leaves during summer. This was most probably due to extremely high temperature which increased mortality among crawlers and adult males. Leaves in the bottom portiop of the tree had more scales than did those of the middle or the upper portions. Leaves inside canopy of the tree had more scales than those of the periphery of the canopy. This may be a photic response. The upper surface of leaves was more densely covered with scales than the lower surface. The population of live scales on the upper surface was approximately 10 times that of the lower surface. This distribution may be due to thermotaxis...|$|R

5000|$|There {{are several}} {{air-drying}} {{methods used to}} for different kinds of flowers. The easiest and {{most effective way to}} dry most flowers is to tie them in small bundles with twine, raffia or ribbons, and hang them upside down, out of direct sunlight <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>warm,</b> well-ventilated <b>place.</b> Bunches should contain one type of flower. Large flowers are dried individually. The leaves stripped as soon as possible after picking. They retain moisture and slow down the drying process. Wall hooks, poles or wires are placed at least six inches from the ceiling. Heads should be staggered to allow plenty of air to circulate. This prevents mildew and rot. It may be necessary to re-tie bunches or individual flowers half way through the drying process, because the stems tend to shrink as they dry.|$|R
3000|$|Situations which {{participants}} characterized as care not done well were {{often associated with}} particularly heavy emotional strain.

Feeling somehow complicit in what was occurring, she {{went on to say that}} “I don’t believe in hell, but I kind of think there is <b>a</b> special place <b>in</b> hell for me.” Especially difficult were circumstances when patients who were dying in pain were turned away from care, a situation which can be “devastating emotionally” (P 10) for humanitarian workers: “…it goes against everything that you – as a healthcare worker, as a humanitarian, everything – to do that to a human being, you know they’re not gonna make it and just put them aside, it was – terrible (P 19).” [...]...|$|R

It is said that on the fifth day of the fifth month, they go to a mountain stream and spread new clothes and headgear on the ground, with a bowl of water beside them. The women dance and sing naked, inviting a visit from the King of Medicine (a tutelary spirit). They wait until snakes, lizards, and poisonous insects come to bathe in the bowl. They pour the water out <b>in</b> <b>a</b> shadowy, dark place. Then they gather the fungus which grows there, which they make into a paste. They put this into goose-feather tubes and hide them in their hair. The heat of their bodies causes worms to generate, which resemble newly-hatched silk-worms. Thus ku is produced. It is often concealed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>warm,</b> dark <b>place</b> <b>in</b> the kitchen. The newly made ku is not yet poisonous. It is used as a love potion, administered in food and drink and called [...] "love-medicine." [...] Gradually the ku becomes poisonous.

It is believed that those who produce ku themselves become ku after death. The ghosts of those who have died from the poison become their servants.|$|R
