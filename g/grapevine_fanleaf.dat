50|$|Xiphinema {{index is}} a migratory {{ectoparasite}} that primarily feeds on the root tips of grapes (Vitis vinifera). The {{body of a}} female is around 3 mm long, and the odontostyle is approximately 126 um long. There is a thick cuticle with thin striations across the body. The female has one or two ovaries that are typically paired. Males and females both have dorsally rounded tails that are short. Feeding on a susceptible host causes the root stunting and tip galling. Furthermore, it is a vector of the <b>grapevine</b> <b>fanleaf</b> virus. Other hosts of this parasite include fig, apple, rose, pistachio, {{as well as several}} others.|$|E
50|$|<b>Grapevine</b> <b>Fanleaf</b> Virus (GFLV), {{the cause}} of fanleaf degradation, is the most {{destructive}} viral disease of grapes worldwide. Xiphinema index was discovered to be a vector of this disease in the 1950s. It causes yellow mosaic and bands on the leaves, and may result in an 80% reduction in fruit set, causing huge economic losses. It is spread by contaminated seed and the grafting of infected rootstocks. In an early experiment, it was shown that California dagger nematodes inoculated with GFLV were still infective after eight months. It is speculated that the two pathogens evolved together, since {{there is evidence that}} the presence of GFLV gives a survival advantage to X. index and not other species of nematodes. In a more recent study, it was shown that GFLV persists in juveniles of X. index for over four years, as determined by RT-PCR.|$|E
5000|$|X.diversicaudatum, {{like many}} other species of dagger nematode, has a wide host range, {{with some of the}} more {{extensively}} studied ones including: strawberries, hops and roses. Other documented hosts include: grapevine, raspberry, apple, asparagus, cabbage, carrot, cherry, red clover, peach. [...] The nematode itself inflicts direct damage to plants roots as it penetrates at its preferred feeding site just behind the root tip. [...] Its long stylet enables it to reach into the vascular system of the plant causing local necrosis and hypertrophy. [...] This feeding action prompts the formation of galls on lateral roots, in turn leading to a stunted root system. [...] Above ground symptoms may not always be present in low-level infections but could include: reduced vigor, and chlorosis of leaves. [...] It is often not just the presence of nematodes that is a concern but it is their ability to serve as a virus vector, in this case for the arabis mosaic virus. The odontophore and esophagus are lined with cuticle, which has been shown to retain virus particles as a monolayer. These particles can then be shed with the cuticular lining as the nematode progresses through its normal life cycle. [...] The vectoring capability of X.diversicaudatum {{has been shown to be}} specific to arabis mosaic virus as no particles were absorbed by the cuticular lining when feeding on plants infected with <b>grapevine</b> <b>fanleaf</b> virus or raspberry ringspot virus.

40|$|International audienceBackground and Aims: Xiphinema {{index and}} X. diversicaudatum are {{nematodes}} that transmit the <b>grapevine</b> <b>fanleaf</b> virus and the Arabis mosaic virus, respectively. These viruses {{are the two}} agents mainly responsible for the disease that causes the most economic damage to grapevines worldwide. The infectious degeneration of grapevines affects vine performance and grape composition. The control of Xiphinema populations by soil disinfection is now impossible because of the removal from the market of the last available chemical treatments. In this study, saponins are assessed as an alternative treatment to control nematode populations. Methods and Results: The nematicidal effect of saponins from Gypsophila paniculata roots was tested against X. index and X. diversicaudatum. In aqueous media, a concentration of 1 mg/mL {{was associated with a}} mortality of greater than 95 % in both nematodes, while in rearing soil, 73 % of X. index and 85 % of X. diversicaudatum were killed by 150 Î¼g of saponins per gram of soil. In addition, an ecotoxicological study was undertaken on two soil bio-indicators (the mycorrhizal fungus Glomus mosseae and soil nitrification) that revealed that they were not affected by Gy. paniculata saponins at a nematicidal concentration. In the soil, investigation of the major Gy. paniculata root saponins revealed that these molecules were completely degraded in the soil within 4 days. Conclusion: We show that Gy. paniculata saponins are an efficient and environmentally friendly treatment against two nematodes that transmit <b>grapevine</b> <b>fanleaf</b> virus.

In addition to the 5 â² and 3 â² noncoding sequences and the 2 A-coding sequence, an additional sequence coding for 2 BMP and/or 2 CCP or the green fluorescent protein (GFP) is necessary for RNA 2 replication.

At the first and second harvest, infected leaves showed increases in the concentration of superoxide radical and hydrogen peroxide, the latter increasing for enhanced activity of superoxide dismutase. In contrast, at the last harvest time, increases in the ascorbate pool and ascorbate peroxidase activity maintained hydrogen peroxide to control levels. The glutathione pool was negatively affected as summer progressed, showing a decrease in its total and reduced form amounts. At the same time, increases in the ascorbate pool were observed, making antioxidant defenses of grapevine effective also at the last harvest time. Increases in phenolic acids, and in particular in p-hydroxybenzoic acid, at the first and second harvest might have enhanced the efficiency of the antioxidant system through an interrelation between a peroxidase/phenol/ascorbate system and the NADPH/glutathione/ascorbate cycle. The lack of increase in p-hydroxybenzoic acid at the third harvest could be due instead to the enhanced utilization of this acid for hydrogen peroxide detoxification.

The aim of this study was evaluate the occurrence of GFLV and ArMV in vineyards of the Grapevine Breeding Station PoleÅ¡ovice (Czech Republic) using the ELISA test and visual symptoms. In every year from 2001 â 2004 altogether 225 grapevine plants were tested for the occurrence of GFLV and ArMV. In case of GFLV positive results were obtained in 43 plants, i. e. in 19. 11 % of all samples. In case of ArMV there were 51 positive tests, i. e. 22. 66 %. Our results demonstrated a occurrence of GFLV and ArMV in propagation vineyards, which was comparable with results obtained abroad. It was also demonstrated that a professional visual selection could provide a good basis for the identification of virus diseases and their subsequent tests...|$|E
40|$|During {{phytosanitary}} certification of three grapevine clones (one of Gorgollosa {{and two of}} Mances de Tibus) received at IMIDA from the Balearic Islands (Spain), we observed discrepancies between symptoms on Cabernet Franc indicator plants {{and the results of}} ELISA testing for viruses associated with grapevine leafroll. According to DAS-ELISA analysis (Bioreba, Nyon, Switzerland), the three clones were free from GLRaV- 1 and GLRaV- 3 but positive for GLRaV- 2. However, in four consecutive seasons on indicator rootstocks, symptom severity led to a suspicion that other leafroll viruses might be present; in our experience, symptoms produced by GLRaV- 2 infection alone are rarely as severe as those that were observed. Testing of the clones with real-time RT-PCR using TaqMan Â® probes (Osman et al., 2007) detected Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 4. Using similar real-time PCR methods we confirmed the presence of GLRaV- 2 but we did not detect either GLRaV- 1 or GLRaV- 3. Moreover we could also detect <b>Grapevine</b> <b>fanleaf</b> virus...|$|E
40|$|<b>Grapevine</b> <b>fanleaf</b> virus (GFLV) and Arabis mosaic virus (ArMV) are two {{important}} agents from the Nepoviruses genus. At present, serodiagnostic method {{is one of}} routine methods of virus pathogens testing also in grapevines. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine a suitable date of grapevine tissue sampling using the ELISA method and to follow visible symptoms of GFVL and ArMV infestation of vines. Positive results of tests for the occurrence of GFLV were obtained in the following growth stages: B (intensive growth â growth apex), C (beginning of flowering â young leaves) and D (beginning of flowering â inflorescence). Samples evaluated by ELISA method as positive for ArMV were found out in growth stages B (intensive growth â growth apex) and C (beginning of flowering â inflorescence). In all other stages the results of performed tests were negative. It is concluded that the stage B (intensive growth â growth apex) seems to be the most suitable for sampling of grapevine tissue...|$|E
