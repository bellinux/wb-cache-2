500|$|Hail to the Thiefs lyrics were {{influenced}} by what Yorke called [...] "the general sense of ignorance and intolerance and panic and stupidity" [...] following the 2000 election of US President George W. Bush. He took words and phrases from discussion of the unfolding War on Terror and used them in the album's lyrics and artwork. He denied any intent to make a [...] "political statement" [...] with the songs, and told the Toronto Star: [...] "I desperately tried not to write anything political, anything expressing the deep, profound terror I'm living with day to day. But it's just fucking there, and eventually you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> up and let it happen." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{mentioned}} above, Maya {{culture was}} an important inspiration for Asturias. He saw a direct relationship between magical realism and Indigenous mentality, saying, “...an Indian or a mestizo in a small village might describe how he saw an enormous stone turn into a person or a giant, or a cloud turn into a stone. That is not a tangible reality but one that involves an understanding of supernatural forces. That is why when I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> a literary label I call it [...] "magic realism." [...] Similarly, scholar Lourdes Royano Gutiérrez argues that surrealist thought is not entirely different from the indigenous or mestizo worldview. Royano Gutiérrez describes this worldview as {{one in which the}} border between reality and dream is porous and not concrete. It is clear from both Asturias' and Gutiérrez' quotes that magical realism was seen as a suitable genre to represent an indigenous character's thoughts. The surrealist/magical realist style is exemplified in Asturias' works Mulata de tal and El señor Presidente.|$|E
2500|$|He had overheard {{the phrase}} [...] "as queer as a {{clockwork}} orange" [...] in a London pub in 1945 and {{assumed it was}} a Cockney expression. In Clockwork Marmalade, an essay published in the Listener in 1972, {{he said that he}} had heard the phrase several times since that occasion. He also explained the title in response to a question from William Everson on the television programme Camera Three in 1972, [...] "Well, the title has a very different meaning but only to a particular generation of London Cockneys. It's a phrase which I heard many years ago and so fell in love with, I wanted to use it, the title of the book. But the phrase itself I did not make up. The phrase [...] "as queer as a clockwork orange" [...] is good old East London slang and it didn't seem to me necessary to explain it. Now, obviously, I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> an extra meaning. I've implied an extra dimension. I've implied the junction of the organic, the lively, the sweet – in other words, life, the orange – and the mechanical, the cold, the disciplined. I've brought them together in this kind of oxymoron, this sour-sweet word." [...] Nonetheless, no other record of the expression being used before 1962 has ever appeared. Kingsley Amis notes in his Memoirs (1991) that no trace of it appears in Eric Partridge's Dictionary of Historical Slang.|$|E
