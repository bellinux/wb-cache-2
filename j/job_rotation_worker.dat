40|$|ABSTRACT) Lean {{production}} prescribes training {{workers on}} all tasks within the cell {{to adapt to}} changes in customer demand. Multi-skilling of workers {{can be achieved by}} cross-training. Cross-training can be improved and reinforced by implementing <b>job</b> <b>rotation.</b> Lean production also prescribes using <b>job</b> <b>rotation</b> to improve <b>worker</b> flexibility, worker satisfaction, and to increase worker knowledge in how their work affects the rest of the cell. Currently, there is minimal research on how to assign multi-skilled workers to tasks within a lean production cell while considering multi-skilling and <b>job</b> <b>rotation.</b> In this research, a new mathematical model was developed that assigns workers to tasks, while ensuring <b>job</b> <b>rotation,</b> and determines the levels of skill, and thus training, necessary to meet customer demand, quality requirements, and training objectives. The model is solved using sequential goal programming to incorporate three objectives: overproduction, cost of poor quality, and cost of training. The results of the model include an assignment of workers to tasks, a determination of the training necessary for the <b>workers,</b> and a <b>job</b> <b>rotation</b> schedule. To evaluate the results on a cost basis, the costs associated with overproduction, defects, an...|$|R

Based on the proposed formulations, a mathematical programming model for <b>job</b> <b>rotation</b> is developed, and a numerical example is provided to illustrate its applications.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the <b>job</b> <b>rotation</b> implementation at medium- or small-industries and to identify the viewpoint on <b>job</b> <b>rotation</b> as preventive activity of work-related musculoskeletal disorders(WMSDs). Background: <b>Job</b> <b>rotation</b> has been implemented in many industrial areas in order to prevent the WMSDs as one part of ergonomic program. Generally, the cases of implementation of ergonomic program or successful cases of <b>job</b> <b>rotation</b> were reported on the side of major or large company. Therefore, this study tried to inspect the current state of <b>job</b> <b>rotation</b> implementation at medium- or small-industries. Method: Survey was carried out for randomly contacted forty seven mangers responsible for safety. Survey contained the questionnaires on the general state of company, shift-work and <b>job</b> <b>rotation.</b> Results: The ratio of work-shift in medium- and small-industry was 34. 0 % and the ratio of <b>job</b> <b>rotation</b> was 19. 1 %. For manufacturing industry, the ratio was 37. 9 % and 17. 2 %, respectively. Conclusion: The implementation ratio of <b>job</b> <b>rotation</b> was relatively low considering the results of previous studies. Many managers appealed the quality decreasing of goods and the injuries of <b>workers</b> due to <b>job</b> <b>rotation,</b> though agreed to train the multi-functional worker and to prevent the WMSDs.

When agents privately learn about the productivity of tasks on which they work, <b>job</b> <b>rotation</b> can be an efficient means of eliciting their information.

Three teams of 3 employees each participated in this study. Work demands were assessed by systematic observation of tasks and activities. Workload was quantified by means of heart rate, oxygen uptake, subjective ratings, and urinary excretion rates of catecholamines.

The effect of <b>job</b> <b>rotation</b> on predictions for the risk of reporting low back pain was estimated using Low Back Pain Reporting (LBPR) and Time Weighted Average (TWA) approaches. Index scores calculated using the peak hand force, the peak L 4 /L 5 shear force and the L 4 /L 5 moment cumulated over the entire shift were used to estimate the effects of <b>job</b> <b>rotation</b> on the probability of reporting low back pain. Simulations of realistic <b>rotations</b> between two <b>jobs</b> showed that workers in low demand jobs who rotate into higher demand jobs experience a linear increase in reporting probability using the TWA approach.
