By noon that day, Ike was still drinking and once again armed, {{in violation of the}} city ordinance against carrying firearms in the city. He told others he was looking for Holliday or an Earp. At about 1:00 pm, Virgil and Morgan Earp surprised Ike on 4th Street where Virgil pistol whipped him from behind. Disarming him, the Earps took <b>Ike</b> <b>to</b> appear before Judge Wallace for violating the ordinance.

The boys find from online {{research}} {{that the only way}} to make Jackson accept his death is to make him experience the acceptance he sought in life, so they take him to a child beauty pageant for young girls. Dressed like a little girl, Ike/Jackson impresses two of the male judges by singing a tune sounding similar to Jackson's [...] "You Are Not Alone," [...] but they are promptly arrested for masturbating while watching the children, leaving a single, unimpressed female judge (much to the shock of the boys, who were unaware of the men's lewd acts and considered them the best judges). When Cartman notices the judge eating Chipotle, he bribes her with knowledge about the ChipotlAway product, and she declares Ike/Jackson the winner as a result. One of the other contestants is physically beaten by her mother for losing. Having found his acceptance, Jackson leaves Ike's body, and Ike is extremely surprised and disgusted to find himself dressed like a little girl.|$|E

500|$|In 1960, Ike {{wrote an}} R song, [...] "A Fool in Love", {{originally}} for Kings of Rhythm vocalist Art Lassiter. Lassiter {{failed to show}} up to the recording studio and Anna eventually was allowed to sing the song after much pleading to Ike. Ike agreed to use her voice as a [...] "dummy vocal", with the intention of erasing her vocals and adding Lassiter's at a later date. Although some felt that the demo with Anna's voice was [...] "high pitched" [...] and [...] "screechy", the song received decent airtime in St. Louis. Local St. Louis deejay Dave Dixon convinced <b>Ike</b> <b>to</b> send the tape to Juggy Murray, president of R label, Sue Records. Upon hearing the song, Murray was impressed with Anna's vocals, later stating that her vocals [...] "sounded like screaming dirt... it was a funky sound." [...] Murray bought the track and paid Ike a $25,000 (around [...] $208,620 as of 2017) advance for recording and publishing rights. Murray also convinced Turner to make Anna [...] "the star of the show." [...] It was at this point that Ike Turner renamed Anna Mae Bullock [...] "Tina" [...] because the name rhymed with the television character Sheena. Ike patented the name Tina Turner as a form of protection so that if Anna left him like his previous lead singers, he could replace her with another singer and have her perform as Tina.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{hearing the}} track, an {{impressed}} Murray bought the musical {{rights to the}} song and gave Ike a $20,000 advance for it, convincing <b>Ike</b> <b>to</b> keep Ann's voice on the track.

He also gave her the name to prevent her from running off with it. In case Ann left, he could give another woman the name of Tina Turner. Including the Kings of Rhythm and the Ikettes singing (and later dancing) trio, the entire troupe performed under the name, [...] "The Ike and Tina Turner Revue".|$|E

During a band {{intermission}} in Club Manhattan, Anna was given a microphone from the band's drummer Gene Washington. Bullock eventually sang along with Ike's band for several songs that night. Going by the stage name [...] "Little Ann", Bullock made her recording debut as a background vocalist to Ike's song [...] "Box Top", which became a regional single on Tune Town Records. During this period, Ike trained Ann on voice control and performance. In March 1960, singer Art Lassiter was chosen to front the Kings of Rhythm. Ike had written a song for Lassiter he called [...] "A Fool in Love". Lassiter failed to show up to record. Having already booked expensive studio time, Ike allowed [...] "Little Ann" [...] to sing the song as a [...] "dummy track" [...] for Lassiter.

2500|$|On July 1, The Ike and Tina Turner Revue {{traveled}} by plane to Dallas {{where they were}} to perform at the Dallas Statler Hilton. While on the airplane, the two became embroiled in an altercation, {{which led to a}} physical fight in their limousine. The duo presented different accounts as to what went on that day. Ike accused Tina of being negligent to help him with a nose bleed due to constant cocaine use. Tina claimed Ike was annoyed that Tina was eating chocolates while wearing an all-white outfit, causing <b>Ike</b> <b>to</b> slap her. The couple agreed, however, that Ike had been up for five days straight on a cocaine binge. Following Ike's slap, Tina recalled fighting him back, scratching him and kicking him. Ike Turner alleged to a musician associate friend that the two [...] "went around like prizefighters for awhile". Both Ike and Tina were bleeding by the time they arrived at the hotel. After going up to their suite, Ike retired to a sofa. Once Ike had fallen asleep, Tina grabbed a few toiletries, covered herself and escaped {{from the back of the}} hotel, running across an active freeway before stopping at a local Ramada Inn hotel. She claimed that she later hid at several friends' homes for a time. [...] Ike claims in his book that Tina initiated the fight by purposely irritating him so that she'd have a reason to break up with him before they were scheduled to sign a new 5-year contract upon their return from Dallas. He reveals that three weeks after they split, they met for a meal at Ship's Restaurant in Los Angeles. Ike says Tina said maybe they'd get back together after eight or nine years. On July 27, 1976, Tina Turner filed for divorce on the grounds of irreconcilable differences.|$|E
