In the evening, the rebels attacked the residence, killing one gendarme and capturing the rest; the prisoners were eventually all returned unharmed.|$|E
5|$|As {{military}} governor, Johnson {{sought to}} eliminate rebel {{influence in the}} state. He demanded loyalty oaths from public officials, and shut <b>down</b> <b>all</b> newspapers owned by Confederate sympathizers. Much of eastern Tennessee remained in Confederate hands, and {{the ebb and flow}} of war during 1862 sometimes brought Confederate control again close to Nashville. However, the Confederates allowed his wife and family to pass through the lines to join him. Johnson undertook the defense of Nashville as best he could, though the city was continually harassed by cavalry raids led by General Nathan Bedford Forrest. Relief from Union regulars did not come until William S. Rosecrans defeated the Confederates at Murfreesboro in early 1863. Much of eastern Tennessee was captured later that year.|$|E
