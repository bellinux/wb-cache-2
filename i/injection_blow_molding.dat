40|$|International audienceSingle stage <b>injection</b> <b>blow</b> <b>molding</b> process, without preform {{storage and}} reheat, could be {{run on a}} {{standard}} injection molding machine, {{with the aim of}} producing short series of specific hollow parts. The polypropylene bottles are blow molded right after being injected. This implies that the preform has to remain sufficiently malleable to be blown while being viscous enough to avoid being pierced during the blow molding stage. These constraints lead to a small processing window, and so the process takes place between the melting temperature and the crystallization temperature, where the polypropylene is in its molten state but cool enough to enhance its viscosity without crystallizing. This single stage process introduces temperature gradients, high stretch rate and high cooling rate. Melt rheometry tests were performed to characterize the polymer behavior in the temperature range of the process, as well as Differential Scanning Calorimetry. A viscous Cross model is used with the thermal dependence assumed by an Arrhenius law. The process is simulated through a finite element code (POLYFLOW) in the ANSYS Workbench framework.

40|$|International audienceThanks to {{the single}} stage <b>injection</b> <b>blow</b> <b>molding</b> process, {{specific}} hollow parts can be produced with standard injection molding machine. A specific mold is designed, enabling the preform injection molding, {{as well as its}} blow molding on the same machine. The preform is blow molded right after its injection molding. This particular process does not involve preform storage and reheating before the blow molding stage. This implies that the preform has to remain sufficiently malleable to be blown while being viscous enough to avoid being pierced during the blow molding stage. The polymer used is a polypropylene random copolymer. Therefore the process takes place between the melting temperature and the crystallization one. As the preform is blow molded right after being injected, this single stage process involves high temperature before the blowing. The polymer rheological behavior is investigated through dynamic rheometry in its molten state at various temperatures. A viscous Cross model is used with the thermal dependence assumed by an Arrhenius law. The process is simulated through a finite element code (Polyflow) in the ANSYS Workbench framework. The geometry allows an axisymmetric approach. The transient simulation is run under anisothermal conditions and viscous heating is taken into account. Two geometries are simulated. First, the flask geometry has been used to show the process efficiency. The yoghurt pot geometry has been designed later for industrial application in a more sophisticated mold than the flask mold. Blow molded parts are analyzed by tomography and the thickness has been measured by the tomography data image analysis. The simulation results are compared to the experimental ones. The simulation fits well with the experimental results concerning both geometries. The simple numerical model proposed proves to be robust enough to predict well the blow molded parts final thickness repartitions provided that the relevant temperature and pressure conditions are well defined...|$|E
40|$|New and {{promising}} treatments for {{coronary heart disease}} are enabled by vascular scaffolds made of poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA), as demonstrated by Abbott Vascular’s bioresorbable vascular scaffold. PLLA is a semicrystalline polymer whose degree of crystallinity and crystalline microstructure depend on the thermal and deformation history during processing. In turn, the semicrystalline morphology determines scaffold strength and biodegradation time. However, spatially-resolved information about the resulting material structure (crystallinity and crystal orientation) is needed to interpret in vivo observations. The first manufacturing step of the scaffold is tube expansion in a process similar to <b>injection</b> <b>blow</b> <b>molding.</b> Spatial uniformity of the tube microstructure {{is essential for the}} consistent production and performance of the final scaffold. For implantation into the artery, solid-state deformation below the glass transition temperature is imposed on a laser-cut subassembly to crimp it into a small diameter. Regions of localized strain during crimping are implicated in deployment behavior. To examine the semicrystalline microstructure development of the scaffold, we employed complementary techniques of scanning electron and polarized light microscopy, wide-angle X-ray scattering, and X-ray microdiffraction. These techniques enabled us to assess the microstructure at the micro and nano length scale. The results show that the expanded tube is very uniform in the azimuthal and axial directions and that radial variations are more pronounced. The crimping step dramatically changes the microstructure of the subassembly by imposing extreme elongation and compression. Spatial information on the degree and direction of chain orientation from X-ray microdiffraction data gives insight into the mechanism by which the PLLA dissipates the stresses during crimping, without fracture. Finally, analysis of the microstructure after deployment shows that it is inherited from the crimping step and contributes to the scaffold’s successful implantation in vivo. ...|$|E
