50|$|A compass {{installed}} in a vehicle or vessel has {{a certain amount of}} error caused by the magnetic properties of the vessel. This error is known as compass deviation. The magnitude of the compass deviation varies greatly depending upon the local anomalies created by the vessel. A fiberglass recreational vessel will generally have much less compass deviation then a steel hulled vessel. Electrical wires carrying current have a small magnetic field around them and can cause deviation. Any type of magnet, such as found in a speaker can also cause large magnitudes of compass deviation. The error can be corrected using a <b>Deviation</b> <b>Table.</b> Deviation Tables are very difficult to create. Once a <b>deviation</b> <b>table</b> is established, it is only good for that particular vessel, with that particular configuration. If electrical wires are moved or anything else magnetic (speakers, electric motors, etc.) are moved, the <b>deviation</b> <b>table</b> will change. All Deviations on the <b>Deviation</b> <b>Table</b> are indicated West or East. If the compass is pointing West of the Magnetic North Pole, then the Deviation is Westward. If the compass is pointing East of the Magnetic North Pole, then the Deviation is Eastward.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThere are three major thrusts to this thesis. The first was {{to design and}} build a device to measure ground speed for testing the position estimating capabilities of the Small Autonomous Navigation System (SANS) filter. The ground tests consisted by placing the SANS unit on a golf cart and maneuvering it along a known track. The speed sensing device uses a bicycle wheel attached to the golf cart along with an appropriate time to speed software conversion. The next problem {{was to determine if}} the existing paddle wheel in use would be accurate enough for the SANS to conduct underway tests. To perform this, a mechanism had to be built to channel water and measure its speed while allowing the paddle wheel to be in the flow. Finally, the electronic compass was found to have heading dependent errors, thus a test was designed to determine its deviation. This was performed by swinging the compass using a transit aligned with its axis. This established a <b>deviation</b> <b>table</b> that was inserted into the SANS code, further refining its directional capabilities. As a final test for determining the effectiveness of the calibrated inputs, tests were conducted that showed that the SANS filter is capable of obtaining 3 meter accuracy with no Global Positioning Update for an excess of two minutes.

Methods: 45 players participated in the testing in total. The machine of bioelectrical impedance BIA 2000 M was used for the detection of the body composition and the gained data were further proceeded in the programme NUTRI 4. The observed parameters were a percentage of body fat, an absolute amount of fat mass, fat-free and intracellular tissue.

40|$|The {{economics}} of veterinary services delivery among commercial poultry farmers was investigated using primary {{data collected from}} 60 respondents (50 commercial poultry farmers and 10 veterinary officers) {{with the aid of}} structured questionnaire. Data collected were analyzed using a combination of descriptive statistics (i. e. mean, percentage, standard <b>deviation,</b> <b>table)</b> and inferential statistics (i. e. multiple regression model). The results of the study showed that though the veterinary services delivery was structured into public and private sectors majority (60. 9 %) of the commercial poultry farmers demanded and obtained veterinary services from the public sector. The estimated cost function of commercial poultry farm in the study area revealed that the cost of veterinary services significantly affected the total cost of poultry output (p = 0. 01). The estimated demand function for veterinary services indicated that the scale of production and distance to the nearest veterinary office were the significant determinants of the demand for veterinary services in the study area. The finding of the study further revealed that the propensity to supply veterinary services was mainly influenced by demand of poultry farmers (0. 8) and effective price {{that they are willing to}} pay (0. 8). It was recommended among others that private individuals should be encouraged by policy to participate in veterinary services delivery.

40|$|The {{majority}} of current Network on Chip (NoC) architectures employ mesh topology and use simple static routing, to reduce power and area. However, regular mesh topology is unrealistic due to variations in module sizes and shapes, {{and is not}} suitable for application-specific NoCs. Consequently, simplistic routing techniques such as XY routing are inadequate, raising the need for low cost alternatives which can work in irregular mesh networks. In this paper we present a novel technique for reducing the total hardware cost of routing tables for both source and distributed routing approaches. The proposed technique is based on applying a fixed routing function combined with minimal <b>deviation</b> <b>tables</b> that are used only when the routing decisions for a given destination deviate from the predefined routing function. We apply this methodology to compare three hardware efficient routing methods for irregular mesh topology NoCs. For each method, we develop path selection algorithms that minimize the overall cost of routing tables. Finally, we demonstrate by simulations on random and specific real application network instances a significant cost saving compared to standard solutions, and examine the scaling of cost savings with growing NoC size. 1 1...|$|R

Specifically, the study {{examined the}} nature of the price movement and the quarterly trend between markets for rice in Edo State, Nigeria and the price relationship of rice within the markets. The rates of increase in price of rice in the rural and urban markets were also determined. Also, the differences in rice prices between the rural and urban markets were tested if they were significant. The prices used were derived from the daily prices of rice collected by staff of the Edo State Agricultural Development Programme (EADP) from the various markets in Edo State, Nigeria. The data were analyzed using simple descriptive statistics (such as means, standard <b>deviations,</b> <b>tables,</b> graphs etc.) and multiple regression analysis. The study revealed that the price of rice for both markets (rural and urban) started rising from the second quarter through to the third before peaking in the fourth quarter.

The same conclusions can be deduced from the resulting average values of precision and recall in Table 2. It is surprising that the linear model is better than the higher order model. It can be caused by a character of input data—parameters of the web discussion. Together with an increasing of values of these parameters, also the value of authority increases. Therefore, linear model is sufficient for the authority estimation.|$|R

Spirituality is considered as an important source for individuals to adapt with stressful life events. Objectives: The current study aimed to determine the relationship between spiritual well-being and life satisfaction in females with infertility. Methods: After explaining the study goals to the subjects and attaining their written consents, the present cross-sectional co-relational study was conducted on 190 females with infertility referred to Isfahan fertility and infertility center, Isfahan, Iran. The subjects were selected through a convenience random sampling method in three months by the satisfaction with life scale (SWLS) and spiritual well-being scale (SWBS) through face to face interview in 2013. Data were collected and then analyzed by SPSS ver. 17. Descriptive statistical methods (frequency distribution, mean, variance and standard <b>deviation</b> <b>tables)</b> and analytical statistical methods (Pearson correlation test, Spearman correlation coefficients, one-way ANOVA and T-test) were used. Results: The {{results of the study}} indicated a direct relationship between the scores of life satisfaction and religious dimension of spiritual well-being (r = 0. 375, P < 0. 001), as well as the score of existential dimension of spiritual well-being (r = 0. 732, P < 0. 001), and the overall score of spiritual well-being (r = 0. 643, P < 0. 001). The score of existential dimension had a closer relationship with that of life satisfaction, compared to the score of religious dimension and the overall score of spiritual well-being. Conclusions: The present study showed that people with higher spiritual well-being had a higher life satisfaction. Since infertility has numerous social and psychological complications and consequences, which can lead to lower life satisfaction, the medical staff can increase spiritual well-being and life satisfaction in females with infertility problems by taking proper measures and actions...|$|R

P 1 P 8160 A modulates the output of a PLL in order to “spread ” the bandwidth of a synthesized clock, and more importantly, decreases the peak amplitudes of its harmonics. This results in significantly lower system EMI compared to the typical narrow band signal produced by oscillators and most frequency generators.
