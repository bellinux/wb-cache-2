40|$|Scientific {{innovation}} {{is crucial to}} the prosperity, security, and health of a nation. During the founding years of the United States, political leaders realized the need for such innovation and created the patent law system 2 as a means of protecting American citizens. The major goals of the United States patent law system are to provide the public with cutting-edge scientific discoveries and to enlighten the public as to how these discoveries can benefit society. In modern America, a substantial amount of patent protection is sought for inventions relating to the pharmaceutical industry. In recent decades, the pharmaceutical industry has expanded rapidly as researchers invent new and more effective drugs and products. The average life expectancy and quality of life of United States citizens has drastically increased in the past century, largely due to pharmaceutical innovation. Nonetheless, nearly sixty million people die each year, with many of these deaths caused by problems that pharmaceutical companies are striving to cure. In the late 1970 s, scientific researchers began to view genetic material as a means of developing treatment options for a variety of human diseases. Today, approximately two-thirds of the new drugs that hit the market have been influenced by genetic research, and genetic material has been linked to more than 850 human diseases. Additionally, biotechnology investors have indicated-with their pocketbooks-that they believe that the future of disease prevention and treatment is tied to genetic research. Despite the fact that pharmaceutical companies have invested billions of dollars for development of gene-related cures and treatments for human illnesses, the general public and the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York wish to rein in the intellectual property rights afforded to these companies. Furthermore, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (C. A. F. C.) is divided in regard to DNA patentability and has indicated that any change to DNA-patenting policy would be most effectively propagated legislatively. In our society, there is a large disconnect between the supposed interests of the public and the pharmaceutical industry. In general, the public desires medical innovation but prefers to benefit from these medical advances at minimal cost. Meanwhile, the pharmaceutical industry is merely a business, and businesses are built on profit maximization. Because the pharmaceutical business is premised on seemingly altruistic purposes, the industry is an easy target for individuals who cannot afford its services. Due {{to the nature of the}} pharmaceutical industry, profit maximization benefits the general public. Therefore, decreasing pharmaceutical company profits necessarily has the unintended side effect of decreasing public health benefits. This complicated equilibrium has been <b>convoluted</b> <b>further</b> by the district court ruling, and the subsequent divided C. A. F. C. ruling, in the recent Myriad case. This Note will explore the seemingly contradictory interests of the general public, the pharmaceutical industry, and the research community regarding human gene patents. Part I will look at the recent Myriad decisions in light of previous beliefs about the patentability of genetic material. Part II will examine the effect of gene patenting on scientific research and innovation. Parts III and IV will explore the effect of gene patents on both the general public and the pharmaceutical industry, and will seek to understand the belief dissonance between these two factions. Part V will consider how Congress has handled similar problems in the past through legislation, specifically in regards to plant patents and biological drugs. Part VI will discuss the possibility of finding a solution to the gene patent problem that satisfies the research community, the general public, and the pharmaceutical industry. Ultimately, this Note will analyze the success of prior legislation in order to propose a course of action that will appease all parties involved in the human gene patenting debate...|$|R

Monks close to Somdet Nyanasamvara's camp protested the move as a violation of Thailand's Sangha Act.

40|$|Many {{individual}} and corporate donors {{are interested in}} supporting charitable projects in China. Unfortunately, making grants to foreign organizations can be challenging, and China's unique legal environment creates an additional layer of complexity to the process.

The current study aims to contribute to this literature by providing some empirical evidence for Italy, by proposing a methodology that combines nonparametric efficiency estimation and cluster analysis. Our main findings indicate that privately owned utilities indirectly controlled by a public organisation reach the highest level of efficiency but, when size and geographical location enter the analysis, ownership has a stronger significant effect on efficiency, and mixed utilities gain higher cost efficiency. Therefore, we may conclude that administrative reforms about privatisation and the institutional setting should consider a set of variables that characterise each individual organisation...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Program of Liberal StudiesThe National Museum of American Indians Act of 1989 (NMAI) and the Native American Grave Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990 (NAGPRA) are two viable {{pieces of}} {{legislation}} that give tribal communities an opportunity to reclaim objects of ancestral heritage. However, the repatriation process uses academic and governmental mandates that support the colonialist perspective. The case study of the Logan Museum of Anthropology is one particular example of the conflicts and misconceptions about repatriation. This case study specifically focuses on the Potawatomi Nation and their interaction with present day NAGPRA legislation. The case study of the Logan Museum of Anthropology raises questions about ownership {{and the types of}} evidence used to support a repatriation claim. The role of academia {{in the context of the}} NMAI Act and NAGPRA is focused through a variety of disciplinary fields such as anthropology, history, and art history. With the current amendment to NAGPRA, “the CUHR ruling,” the process of repatriation is <b>further</b> <b>convoluted.</b> However, tribal nations are exploring methods of repatriation that entail collaborating with other tribal communities for a common goal. However, because these two {{pieces of legislation}} are unclear and lead to personal interpretation, the federal legislation must continue to amend and / or create new legislation to adjust the current mandates...|$|E
40|$|The {{calculation}} of the crystalline index (CI) of polymeric materials by X-ray diffraction (XRD) may be rendered difficult {{by the number of}} overlapping crystalline phases and amorphous halos that contribute to the diffraction pattern. Rilsan ® Polyamide- 11 (PA- 11), produced by Arkema Inc., is a semi-crystalline polymer with an eleven-carbon repeat unit belonging to the general class of Nylon polymers. This material presents the peculiarity of having a smectic phase along with three crystalline phases. Samples from melt-extruded Rilsan ® PA- 11 oil pipeline liners that had been subjected to various aging conditions were analyzed by XRD. From wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) patterns their CI was calculated, which were compared to values obtained from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements. Severe overlaps among the crystalline, amorphous and smectic phases of Rilsan ® PA- 11 were observed, which were <b>further</b> <b>convoluted</b> by the amorphous phases of additives in the polymer matrix. Initial attempts to calculate CI reliably from XRD data were therefore unsuccessful. Subsequently, hot stage XRD was used to perform peak decomposition on three temperature patterns (90 ºC, 150 ºC, and 180 ºC). A linear evolution for smectic and amorphous peak positions was seen in this temperature range. Extrapolation of peak positions to room temperature conditions helped to refine the experimental patterns and greatly increased the accuracy of the crystalline index calculation by XRD, which is seen by comparison with DSC data...|$|E

40|$|The {{author of}} this paper submits that humans have a natural inquisitiveness; hence, mathematicians (as well as other humans) must be active in learning. Thus, we must commit to {{conjecture}} and prove or disprove said conjecture. Ergo, {{the purpose of the}} paper is to submit the thesis that learning requires doing; only through inquiry is learning achieved, and hence this paper proposes an archetype of mathematical thought such that the experience of doing a mathematical argument is the reason for the exercise along with the finished product; and, that the nature of mathematical thought is one that can be characterised as thought through inquiry that relies on inquiry though constructive scepticism. To opine mathematical thought is rooted in a disconnected incidental schema where no deductive conclusion exists or can be gleaned is to condemn the field to a chaotic tousle; whereas, to opine that it is firmly entrenched in a constricted schema which is stagnant, simple, and compleat is to deny its dynamic nature. So, mathematical thought must be focused on the process of deriving a proof, constructing an adequate model of some physical or latent occurrence, or providing connection between and betwixt the two. The two aforementioned ideas, the theoretical and practical are <b>further</b> <b>convoluted</b> by the seemingly axiological contrarians of experiential process and final product. The experiential process and final product cannot be disconnected. Thus, to paraphrase John Dewey, the ends and the means are the same. The paper is organised in the following manner.

40|$|Complex {{medication}} regimens {{have major}} implications on patient therapy. When we consider that these regimen therapies {{can also be}} <b>further</b> <b>convoluted</b> by co-morbidity, it is then seen as an essential opportunity to research possible solutions to alleviate such complications. Globally identified conditions such as the Human Immuno-deficiency Virus (HIV) and Tuberculosis (TB) {{are known to have}} such complications within their respective regimens. In many cases, the regimental therapies themselves are overbearing with high pill burdens having to be taken in segregated manners throughout the day. Within a standard TB regimen, isoniazid and rifampicin are seen to have a deleterious drug-drug interaction in which the bioavailability is compromised through formation of an insoluble complex. Despite this interaction, the 2 active drugs must be taken concurrently for successful TB therapy. No true solution exists as fixed dose combinations of isoniazid and rifampicin (Rifinah®) are still in production despite the detrimental interaction that impedes successful bioavailability. The once daily multi-unit drug delivery system (ODMUS) has the benefits of superseding the described problems and aiding in therapeutic outcomes. Preliminary studies utilized preliminary testing to ascertain the science surrounding the 2 components of the ODMUS, the memblet and the multiparticulate components. pH-sensitive polymers (Eudragit® L 100 - 55 and E 100) were of critical importance {{to the success of the}} system and were individually manipulated for each component to produce a novel memblet and multiparticulate system through a unique salting out approach. Primary studies focused on drug release testing and drug entrapment for the multiparticulate component. Testing of the memblet system addressed dissolution and thermal analysis. Utilizing this data, a series of process variables were used to achieve an optimized formulation through a Box- Behnken statistical design. Optimized formulations used response testing to establish the optimal characteristics of both components. Multiparticulates achieved controlled release for 12 hours with an enhanced 71...|$|E
