5|$|It was {{not until}} the late 18th and the early 19th century that the first European Americans {{explored}} the remote and hard-to-reach area.

5|$|Evans {{also began}} experimenting {{in this period}} with steam power and <b>its</b> <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> {{commercial}} application. His early ideas culminated in a Delaware state patent application in 1783 for a steam-powered wagon, but it was denied as Evans had yet to produce a working model. That same year, aged 27, Evans married Sarah Tomlinson, daughter of a local farmer, in Old Swedes' Episcopal Church in Wilmington.|$|E

5|$|Due to his {{casualty}} {{studies on}} mustard gas from an accident {{during the war}} in Italy, Rhoads became interested in <b>its</b> <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> cancer treatment. For the rest of his life, his research interest was in developing chemotherapy for cancer treatment, but he served primarily as an administrator and scientific director at Memorial and Sloan-Kettering. From studies of mustard gas, he developed a drug called mechlorethamine or Mustargen. Its success in clinical trials during the war years was the basis {{for the development of the}} field of anti-cancer chemotherapy. Rhoads also became interested in total body irradiation, which led to early work on chemotherapy.|$|E
5|$|The book {{opens with}} an {{introductory}} editor's note by Greg Ruggiero, praising the Occupy movement and <b>its</b> <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> the greater democratization of society. This {{is followed by}} the text to Chomsky's Howard Zinn Memorial Lecture, which he gave at Occupy Boston in Massachusetts. The third part of the book comprises Chomsky's interview with the New York University student Edward Radzivilovskiy, while the fourth contains the text of the InterOccupy conference call with Chomsky by Mikal Kamil and Ian Escuela. Part five offers an interview with Chomsky undertaken at the University of Maryland, while the book is rounded off by Chomsky's tribute to the late activist Howard Zinn and the National Lawyers Guild's legal advice to Occupy protesters.|$|E
5|$|The {{red-headed}} myzomela mostly inhabits mangroves in monsoonal coastal areas, especially thickets of spotted mangrove (Rhizophora stylosa), smallflower bruguiera (Bruguiera parviflora) and grey mangrove (Avicennia marina) bordering islands or in river deltas, but {{it often}} also occurs in paperbark thickets fringing the mangroves {{such as those}} of cajeput (Melaleuca leucadendra). It is a mangrove specialist, an adaptation that probably occurred as northern Australia became more arid and the bird populations became dependent on mangroves as other types of forest disappeared. The mangroves provide nectar and insects as well as shelter and nesting sites, and they supply the majority of the species' needs for most of the year. In Australia, mangrove vegetation forms a narrow discontinuous strip along thousands of kilometres of coastline, accommodating birds specialized for the habitat. Eighty Mile Beach in Western Australia has no mangroves and no fringing Melaleuca forests, reducing <b>its</b> <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> successful colonization by nectarivores, and it marks the southern limit of the red-headed myzomela in Western Australia.|$|E

5|$|Voight's {{successful}} {{prediction that}} an avalanche at St. Helens could provoke a lateral eruption, an eruption from the volcano's flank {{rather than its}} summit, {{attracted the attention of}} the government of Montserrat in March 1996. Worried about an expanding lava dome at the Soufrière Hills volcano, the island's government asked Voight to assess <b>its</b> <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> an avalanche that could generate an eruption. Voight thought it was unlikely that the crater would collapse, but expressed concern over a possible pyroclastic flow that could reach the city of Plymouth in approximately three minutes. The city and a village on the mountain were evacuated, and within three years, pyroclastic flows overtook the abandoned sites. Following these eruptions, Voight served {{as a member of the}} Risk Assessment Panel that advised Montserrat's government, and he co-established the Caribbean Andesite Lava Island Precision Seismo-geodetic Observatory (CALIPSO) with a team of international scientists. He continued research at the island with Steven Sparks, a geoscientist at the University of Bristol, establishing the SEA-CALIPSO system to analyze Soufrière Hills by using seismic waves and explosions in the ocean. Among other findings, this effort detected a major fault trending north-to-west under Montserrat's western side. Voight still oversees hazard assessments at the volcano, providing his input during eruptive periods in 2006 and 2010.|$|E

25|$|A {{characteristic}} of the Merlot grape is the propensity to quickly overripen once it hits its initial ripeness level, sometimes {{in a matter of}} a few days. There are two schools of thought on the right time to harvest Merlot. The wine makers of Château Pétrus favor early picking to best maintain the wine's acidity and finesse as well as <b>its</b> <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> aging. Others, such as Rolland, favor late picking and the added fruit body that comes with a little bit of over-ripeness.|$|E
25|$|In 1722–1723, {{the forces}} led by Khanthaji Kadani and Pilaji Gaekwad {{attempted}} to raid Sihor but were repelled by Maharajah Bhavsinhji Gohil. After the war, Bhavsinhji realized {{the reason for}} repeated attack was the location of Sihor. In 1723, he established a new capital near Vadva village, 20km away from Sihor, and named it Bhavnagar after himself. It was a carefully chosen strategic location because of <b>its</b> <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> maritime trade. Naturally, Bhavnagar became the capital of Bhavnagar State.

Within three years of implementing the LOE, over 70,000 enterprises were registered as compared to just over 40,000 for the previous nine years. Law on Investment (replacing Law on Foreign Investment) and a new LOE were enacted in 2005.
