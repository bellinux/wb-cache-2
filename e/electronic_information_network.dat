First, {{we present a}} holistic model for evaluating the e-level (level of <b>electronic</b> <b>information</b> <b>network</b> utilization) of a company. The model consists of seven factors: communication, integrity, presence, strategy, resources, business operations, and networks. The managers of 71 companies evaluated their companies ’ use of electronic network by completing a web questionnaire with 21 questions (three for each factor) developed based on the model. The {{analysis of the data}} showed that the developed methods were successful in eliciting both differences and correlations between the different factors for the participating companies. The results of a subsequent questionnaire showed that the company representatives evaluated both the model and the questionnaire as mainly successful.

The managers of 52 companies successfully evaluated their companies ’ electronic communications using a questionnaire, which studies the use of different communication technologies systematically on three factors: internal vs. external communication, office vs. mobile use, and synchronous vs. asyncronous communication.

First,it briefly summarizes existing conventions and laws, and explains to which technological issues they can apply. The paper then turns to a technical discussion of the threats faced by critical infrastructure. By distinguishing between {{the different types of}} attacks (theft of information, destructive penetration, denial of service, etc.) that can be conducted, and examining the role of collateral damages in information security, the paper identifies the major challenges in devising and implementing international conventions for critical infrastructure protection. It then turns to a practical examination of how these findings apply to specific instances of critical networks (power grids and water systems, financial infrastructure, air traffic control and hospital networks), and draws conclusions about potential remedies. A notable finding is that critical functions should be isolated from non-critical functions in the network {{to have a chance to}} implement viable international agreements; and that, given the difficulty in performing attack attribution, other relevant laws should be designed with the objective of reducing negative externalities that facilitate such attacks...|$|R
40|$|Background. The National Health Information Infrastructure, or NHII, {{proposes to}} improve the effectiveness, {{efficiency}} and overall quality of health in the United States by establishing a national, <b>electronic</b> <b>information</b> <b>network</b> for health care. To date, dentistry's integration into this network has not been discussed widely. Methods. The author reviews the NHII and its goals and structure through published reports and background literature. The author evaluates {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of the NHII regarding their implications for the dental care system. Results. The NHII proposes to implement computer-based patient records, or CPRs, for most Americans by 2014, connect personal health information with other clinical and public health information, and enable different types of care providers to access CPRs. Advantages of the NHII include transparency of health information across health care providers, potentially increased involvement of patients in their care, better clinical decision making through connecting patient-specific information with the best clinical evidence, increased efficiency, enhanced bioterrorism defense and potential cost savings. Challenges in the implementation of the NHII in dentistry include limited use of CPRs, required investments in information technology, limited availability and adoption of standards, and perceived threats to privacy and confidentiality. Conclusions. The implementation of the NHII is making rapid strides. Dentistry should become an active participant in the NHII and work to ensure that the needs of dental patients and the profession are met. Practice Implications. The NHII has far-reaching implications on dental practice by making it easier to access relevant patient information and by helping to improve clinical decision making...|$|E

The information needs of academic staff and postgraduate research students were investigated in two University research centres: the Centre for Applied Colloid and BioColloid Science and the Centre for Computer Integrated Manufacture, including the School of Innovation and Enterprise. The {{aims of the}} study were to identify {{the ways in which the}} researchers find, use and store information and the formats used. This study was carried out from the researchers' point of view so that the most effective ways of support could be determined. A multi-method approach to data collection was adopted, using observation, semi-structured interviews with selected staff and postgraduate research students and a questionnaire distributed to all researchers in the designated centres. Because of the collaborative nature of the research, and because a broad definition of information was used, information needs were also identified which were not related to the Library or the Office of Research. These were passed on to the relevant management body within the University. Although the study highlighted differences between the research cultures of the centres, it also demonstrated common issues and needs.

40|$|Abstract Intelligent field {{technology}} {{is being developed}} {{for the management of}} industrial processes, but its development and diffusion have met with problems. This research looks at the problem area from the perspective of industrial decision-makers and end users. The lowest level of process management consists of various electrical, pneumatic and hydraulic devices, using analog and digital signals. In this research the term 'field technology' refers to instrumentation and electrical devices, the communication between them, alarm and registration devices, programs, functions and process management methods. Important concepts in this connection are distribution, availability performance, usability, feasibility and degree of automation. Decision-making and hermeneutical methodologies have been used as research strategies. The leading idea is to provide support to industrial decision-makers and end users involved in the design and planning of processes, field technology and management systems. The research strategy is applied {{in all parts of the}} research: methods, historical review, decision-making support model and criteria, and when studying the diffusion of innovations. The objective is to experimentally verify the decision-making models. This was accomplished by means of multiple-choice questionnaires, example and case process surveys, and by collecting information on intelligent field technology. The target group of the research consisted of 50 decision-makers and end users from 20 factories, and the response percentage varied from 28 % to 47 %. The study of the example and case processes contains contributions from 13 key persons from the factories. Field technology knowledge has been obtained from a number of experts and sources. The results have been employed to verify the current multivariable decision-making model and its technological and economic subcriteria and decision-making criteria (1), as well as the expanded multivariable decision-making model based on the features of intelligent field technology (2). The most significant parameters of the example processes are described (3). The typical characteristics, operations, input and output materials of the case processes and their parameters are examined and assessed (4). A proposal for intelligent field technology solutions will also be made (5). The decision-making support model is an excellent tool in situations involving technological changes. The current set of decision-making criteria will have to change and expand due to the concepts, operations and changes introduced by new, intelligent field technology. Changes will occur in the communication protocol interfaces, in the data processing of field devices, in diagnostic operations and operation management. Suitable decision-making tools include development and decision databases, lifelong learning, human and <b>electronic</b> <b>information</b> <b>networks,</b> the decision-making support model, and benchmarking. In the future, investments will focus on the acquisition and maintenance of field technology. Intelligent field {{technology is}} more expensive, and thus automation design requires more economic and human resources during the diffusion phase; its economic benefits will become more apparent when it gains more ground and the users' skills and expertise increase. Industrial enterprises must actively seek to promote the diffusion of innovations. The current research has also brought up numerous topics that would merit further research...|$|R
