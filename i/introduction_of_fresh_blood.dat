6000|$|As {{some of our}} British {{parks are}} ancient, it {{occurred}} to me that there must have been long-continued close interbreeding with the fallow-deer (Cervus dama) kept in them; but on inquiry I find that it is a common practice to infuse new blood by procuring bucks from other parks. Mr. Shirley (17/16. 'Some Account of English Deer Parks' by Evelyn P. Shirley 1867.), who has carefully studied the management of deer, admits that in some parks there has been no admixture of foreign blood from a time beyond the memory of man. But he concludes [...] "that in the end the constant breeding in-and-in is sure to tell to the disadvantage of the whole herd, though it may take a very long time to prove it; moreover, when we find, as is very constantly the case, that the <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>blood</b> has been of the very greatest use to deer, both by improving their size and appearance, and particularly by being of service in removing the taint of 'rickback,' if not of other diseases, to which deer are sometimes subject when the blood has not been changed, there can, I think, be no doubt but that a judicious cross with a good stock is of the greatest consequence, and is indeed essential, sooner or later, to the prosperity of every well-ordered park." ...|$|E

40|$|Context Dieulafoy’s lesion is {{an unusual}} cause of {{gastrointestinal}} bleeding with the most common location being the stomach. A periampullary location is rare for a bleeding Dieulafoy’s lesion. Case report We present {{the case of a}} 52 -year-old female who presented with intermittent painless melena. Her upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and colonoscopy were normal. She was a diagnostic challenge as no definite lesion could be identified on capsule endoscopy. However, as there was presence <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>blood</b> in the proximal jejunum, a push enteroscopy was performed which revealed the presence <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>blood</b> in the duodenum and proximal jejunum. But no bleeding lesion could be identified. A side view endoscopy was performed which revealed a bleeding periampullary Dieulafoy’s lesion. Immediate hemostasis was achieved with an injection of adrenalin. Other episodes of bleeding occurred and the patient was finally treated surgically. Conclusion A periampullary Dieulafoy’s lesion presenting with obscure gastrointestinal bleed is a diagnostic challenge and can be missed on capsule endoscopy...|$|R
50|$|Hematochezia is {{the passage}} <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>blood</b> through the anus, usually in or with stools (contrast with melena). Hematochezia is {{commonly}} associated with lower gastrointestinal bleeding, but may also occur from a brisk upper gastrointestinal bleed. The difference between hematochezia and rectorrhagia is that, in the latter, rectal bleeding is not associated with defecation; instead, it is associated with expulsion <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> bright red <b>blood</b> without stools. The phrase bright red blood per rectum (BRBPR) is associated with hematochezia and rectorrhagia. It {{is also important to}} differentiate from hematopapyrus - blood on the toilet paper noticed when wiping. The term is from Greek αἷμα ("blood") and χέζειν ("to defaecate").|$|R

40|$|Background Climate {{change is}} {{expected}} to promote more intense and prolonged outbreaks of vector-borne disease, and alter the geographic boundaries of transmission. This has implications for the safety and supply <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>blood</b> products around the world. In Australia, a recent outbreak of dengue fever caused a prolonged regional shortage in the supply <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>blood</b> products. Objective To highlight the potential for climate change to affect the safety and supply of blood globally through its impact on vector-borne disease, using the example of dengue in Australia as a case-study. Design We modelled geographic regions in Australia suitable for dengue transmission over the coming century under four climate change scenarios, estimated changes to the population at risk and effect on blood supply. Results Geographic regions with climates that are favourable to dengue transmission could expand to include large population centres {{in a number of}} currently dengue-free regions in Australia and reduce blood supply across several states. Conclusion Unless there is strong intergovernmental action on greenhouse gas reduction, there could be an eight-fold {{increase in the number of}} people living in dengue prone regions in Australia by the end of the century. Similar impacts will be experienced elsewhere and for other vector-borne diseases, with regions currently on the margins of transmission zones most affected. Globally, climate change is likely to compound existing problems of blood safety and supply in already endemic areas and cause future shortages in <b>fresh</b> <b>blood</b> products through its impact on transmission of vector-borne disease...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT CONTEXT: Boerhaave {{syndrome}} {{consists of}} spontaneous longitudinal transmural rupture of the esophagus, usually in its distal part. It generally develops {{during or after}} persistent vomiting {{as a consequence of}} a sudden increase in intraluminal pressure in the esophagus. It is extremely rare in clinical practice. In 50 % of the cases, it is manifested by Mackler's triad: vomiting, lower thoracic pain and subcutaneous emphysema. Hematemesis is an uncommon yet challenging presentation of Boerhaave's syndrome. Compared with ruptures of other parts of the digestive tract, spontaneous rupture is characterized by a higher mortality rate. CASE REPORT: This paper presents a 64 -year-old female patient whose vomit was black four days before examination and became bloody {{on the day of the}} examination. Her symptoms included epigastric pain and suffocation. Physical examination showed hypotension, tachycardia, dyspnea and a swollen and painful abdomen. Auscultation showed lateral crackling sounds on inspiration. Ultrasound examination showed a distended stomach filled with fluid. Over 1000 ml <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>blood</b> was extracted by means of nasogastric suction. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was discontinued immediately upon entering the proximal esophagus, where a large amount <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>blood</b> was observed. The patient was sent for emergency abdominal surgery, during which she died. An autopsy established a diagnosis of Boerhaave syndrome and ulceration in the duodenal bulb. CONCLUSION: Boerhaave syndrome should be considered in all cases with a combination of gastrointestinal symptoms (especially epigastric pain and vomiting) and pulmonary signs and symptoms (especially suffocation) ...|$|R
