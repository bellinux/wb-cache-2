50|$|Osmiridium {{has been}} defined as {{containing}} a higher proportion of iridium, with <b>iridosmine</b> containing more osmium. However, as the content of the natural Os-Ir alloys varies considerably, the constituent percentages of specimens often reflects the reverse situation of osmiridium describing specimens containing a higher proportion of osmium and <b>iridosmine</b> specimens containing more iridium.|$|E
50|$|Osmiridium and <b>iridosmine</b> {{are natural}} alloys of the {{elements}} osmium and iridium, with traces of other platinum-group metals.|$|E
50|$|Metallic iridium {{is found}} with {{platinum}} and other platinum group metals in alluvial deposits. Naturally occurring iridium alloys include osmiridium and <b>iridosmine,</b> {{both of which}} are mixtures of iridium and osmium.

50|$|In 1963, M. H. Hey {{proposed}} using <b>iridosmine</b> for hexagonal specimens with 32% < Os < 80%, osmiridium for cubic specimens with Os < 32% {{and native}} osmium for specimens Os > 80% (the would-be mineral native iridium of >80% purity {{was not known}} at that time).|$|E
50|$|The {{nomenclature}} of Os-Ir-Ru alloys were revised {{again by}} Harris and Cabri in 1991. Afterwards, only four names {{were applied to}} minerals whose compositions lie within the ternary Os-Ir-Ru system: osmium (native osmium) for all hexagonal alloys with Os the major element; iridium (native iridium) for all cubic alloys with iridium the major element; rutheniridosmine for all hexagonal alloys with Ir the major element; and ruthenium (native ruthenium) for all hexagonal alloys with Ru the major element. The mineral names <b>iridosmine,</b> osmiridium, rutheniridosmium, ruthenian osmium, osmian ruthenium, ruthenium iridium and iridian ruthenium were proposed to be retired.|$|E
40|$|Osmiridium {{samples from}} Tasmania {{have been found}} to include <b>iridosmine,</b> rutheniridosmine. os-miridium, ruthenosmiridium, and irarsite. Composi-tional zoning was {{determined}} in three of the fifteen Tasmanian grains and in nine of the thirty grains from British Columbia. The zoning in the-Os-Ir alloys is considered to be tle resdt of non-equilibra-tion during primary crystallization rather than [...] ele-ment agglutination". Alluvial and eluvial platinum-group alloy occur-reoces from pre-Late Terliary to the precambrian are reviewed {{in the context of their}} geological and tectonic settings.

40|$|The Kondapalli Layered Complex (KLC) is a dismembered mafic-ultramafic layered intrusion, mainly {{composed}} of gabbroic and anorthositic rocks with subordinate ultramafics and chromitite. Chromitite occurs as lenses, pods, bands and disseminations. Platinum group of minerals (PGMs) occur as inclusions within chromite and silicates. The study indicates an inhomogeneous distribution of PGMs and distinct dominance of IPGEs over the PPGEs. The average ΣPGE content of chromite of KLC varies from 64 ppb to 576 ppb with Pt ranging from 5 to 495 ppb, Pd 5 to 191 ppb, Ir 3 to 106 ppb, Ru 3 to 376 ppb and Rh 3 to 135 ppb. The PGMs {{identified in the}} KLC indicate primary deposition of the IPGE, preceding chromite, indicating its orthomagmatic nature. Most of the PGM grains are usually below 10 μm. The identified PGMs are Laurite (RuS 2), irarsite (Ir, As, S), <b>iridosmine</b> (Os, Ir), undetermined Os-Ir sulphide and Ru-Os-Ir-Zn alloys. Chromite also contains inclusions of pentlandite, millerite, chalcopyrite and pyrite. Study indicating that the KLC have orthomagmatic origin for PGE which are dominated by IPGE group and formed under surpa-subduction zone peridotite setting...|$|E
40|$|In situ {{analysis}} of major elements, platinum-group elements and Os isotope composition data for 170 grains of Ru–Os–Ir alloys from podiform chromitites in the Luobusa and Dongqiao ophiolites, Tibet, provide new {{constraints on the}} sources of the alloy grains, the Os-isotope composition of the Neo-Tethyan oceanic upper mantle, and the timing of melt–rock reactions in the ultramafic peridotites of the host ophiolites. Most alloy grains are osmiridium and <b>iridosmine.</b> Based on elemental and isotopic compositions, two populations can be identified. Group I, found in both ophiolite bodies, has fractionated PGE patterns typical of alloys and homogeneous 187 Os/ 188 Os 0. 12645 ± 4 (2 s; n = 145). Group II alloys from the Dongqiao ophiolites show smooth PGE patterns and 187 Os/ 188 Os ranges from 0. 12003 to 0. 12194 (yielding Re-depletion ages ≥ 1. 1 Ga). Both the PGE patterns and the Os isotopic compositions of Group II resemble those of sulfides residual after melting. Group I alloys represent an early cumulate phase during the crystallization of magmas and are interpreted as derived from an asthenospheric melt. In contrast, Group II alloys are inferred to derive from the breakdown of residual sulfides from the mantle section of the ophiolite, which may represent relics of a sub-continental lithospheric mantle. The coexistence of the two groups of alloys in Dongqiao samples reflects interaction between asthenosphere-derived melts and old depleted lithospheric mantle and suggests that the chromitites originated through melt–rock reactions. The data on the Group I alloys support the hypothesis that the Re–Os evolution of the convective oceanic mantle resembles that of enstatite chondrites...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} a {{technique}} for obtaining intense ion beams of negatively charged oxides of Os, Re and Ir by thermal ionization, in a conventional surface ionization mass spectrometer. It {{was found that the}} principal ion species of Os, Re and Ir produced are OsO_ 3 ^−, ReO_ 4 ^− and IrO_ 2 ^−. The sharp distinction in the masses of the dominant molecular species produced by this technique permits the measurement of isotopic compositions of each element from mixtures of platinum-group elements without significant isobaric interferences. For ^(187) Re-^(187) Os isotope studies, this technique offers the advantage of isotopic analyses without prior chemical separation of Re from Os, as no isobaric interference between the oxides of ^(187) Os and ^(187) Re exists under these conditions. For 4 ng Os, stable ion currents of 3 × 10 ^(− 12) A can be maintained for over one hour, which allows determination of isotopic ratios with a Faraday collector to a precision of better than ± 2 ‰ (2 σ_m. For 70 pg Os, isotopic ratios can be measured with a precision of better than ± 5 ‰ using a secondary electron multiplier. The detection limit for Os is estimated to be below 10 ^(− 14) g. Osmium isotopic ratios have also been determined by direct loading of natural <b>iridosmine</b> with a precision of ± 0. 5 ‰ or better. We have obtained ionization efficiencies of 2 – 6 % for Os and > 20 % for Re; these are superior to those reported for other techniques available to date and demonstrate that negative thermal ion mass spectrometry will have widespread application to ^(187) Re-^(187) Os chronometry and to studies of the geochemistry and environmental chemistry of the platinum-group elements...|$|E
