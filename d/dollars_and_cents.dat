500|$|Roddenberry {{was raised}} a Southern Baptist; however, as an adult, he {{rejected}} religion, and considered himself a humanist. He began questioning religion around {{the age of}} 14, {{and came to the}} conclusion that it was [...] "nonsense". As a child, he served in the choir at his local church, but often substituted lyrics as he sang hymns. Early in his writing career, he received an award from the American Baptist Convention for [...] "skillfully writing Christian truth and the application of Christian principles into commercial, dramatic TV scripts". For several years, he corresponded with John M. Gunn of the National Council of Churches regarding the application of Christian teachings in television series. However, Gunn stopped replying after Roddenberry wrote in a letter: [...] "But you must understand that I am a complete pagan, and consume enormous amounts of bread, having found the Word more spice than nourishment, so I am interested in a statement couched in <b>dollars</b> <b>and</b> <b>cents</b> of what this means to the Roddenberry treasury." ...|$|E

The trading unit is [...] per contract, and is quoted in U.S. <b>dollars</b> <b>and</b> <b>cents</b> per ton.

In the northern states of Peninsular Malaysia, denominations of 10 sen are called kupang in Malay ("poat8" [...] in Hokkien, [...] "Jiao" [...] 角 in Mandarin), e.g. 50 sen is 5 kupang ("5 poat8" [...] in Hokkien, [...] "wujiao" [...] 五角 in Mandarin).|$|E

60|$|One <b>dollar</b> <b>and</b> eighty-seven <b>cents.</b> That was all. <b>And</b> sixty <b>cents</b> {{of it was}} in pennies. Pennies saved one and {{two at a time}} by {{bulldozing}} the grocer and {{the vegetable}} man and the butcher until one's cheeks burned with the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing implied. Three times Della counted it. One <b>dollar</b> <b>and</b> eighty-seven <b>cents.</b> <b>And</b> the next day would be Christmas.|$|R

60|$|As {{a matter}} of course, {{the first thing the}} {{partners}} were anxious about, after their patrons had departed, was to know how large their profits were from that evening's excessive labor. Without waiting to change their costumes, save as has been related in the case of Dickey, they gathered around Mrs. Green, who was beginning to recover some of the senses that had been frightened from her. She and Paul counted the money she had in her apron, and the amount was found to be three <b>dollars</b> <b>and</b> five <b>cents.</b> There was already in Treasurer Paul's hands eight <b>dollars</b> <b>and</b> sixty <b>cents,</b> <b>and</b> when it was announced that the evening's performance had netted them the very handsome amount of eleven <b>dollars</b> <b>and</b> sixty-five <b>cents,</b> the joy of the partners showed itself in many extravagant ways.|$|R

6000|$|... "Not she," [...] said Gilbert emphatically. [...] "I know Louisa Spencer well. She doesn't 'believe' in Village Improvement Societies, but she DOES {{believe in}} <b>dollars</b> <b>and</b> <b>cents.</b> She'd {{be more likely}} to urge Judson on than to dissuade him." ...|$|E

6000|$|Cheyne smiled. [...] "I've never kept track, but I should estimate, in <b>dollars</b> <b>and</b> <b>cents,</b> nearer fifty {{than forty}} thousand; maybe sixty. The young {{generation}} comes high. It {{has to have}} things, and it tires of 'em, and--the old man foots the bill." ...|$|E
60|$|But the revolutionists blow hot {{and blow}} cold. They offer facts and statistics, {{economics}} and scientific arguments. If the working-man be merely selfish, the revolutionists show him, mathematically demonstrate to him, that his condition will be bettered by the revolution. If the working-man be the higher type, moved by impulses toward right conduct, if he have soul and spirit, the revolutionists offer him {{the things of}} the soul and the spirit, the tremendous things that cannot be measured by <b>dollars</b> <b>and</b> <b>cents,</b> nor be held down by <b>dollars</b> <b>and</b> <b>cents.</b> The revolutionist cries out upon wrong and injustice, and preaches righteousness. And, most potent of all, he sings the eternal song of human freedom--a song of all lands and all tongues and all time.|$|E

60|$|Still, if I {{felt that}} I {{could afford the}} tax, I would never travel without a courier, for a good courier is a {{convenience}} whose value cannot be estimated in <b>dollars</b> <b>and</b> <b>cents.</b> Without him, travel is a bitter harassment, a purgatory of little exasperating annoyances, a ceaseless and pitiless punishment--I mean to an irascible man who has no business capacity and is confused by details.|$|E
60|$|Francis Ferguson arose, {{his voice}} {{actually}} trembling with anger. There is something uncanny in {{the passion of}} a man whose life has been ordered by the inexorable rules of commerce, who has been wont to decide all questions {{from the standpoint of}} <b>dollars</b> <b>and</b> <b>cents.</b> If one of his own wax models had suddenly become animated, the effect {{could not have been more}} startling.|$|E
60|$|To all {{the other}} trials that I have to contend against, is added that of speculators whose patriotism is {{measured}} by <b>dollars</b> <b>and</b> <b>cents.</b> Country has no value with them compared with money.
