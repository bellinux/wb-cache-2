50|$|Canopy {{temperature}} {{depression is}} highly suitable for selecting physiologically superior lines in warm, {{low relative humidity}} environments where high evaporative demand leads to leaf cooling of up to 10 °C below ambient temperatures. This permits differences among genotypes to be detected relatively easily using <b>infrared</b> <b>thermometry.</b> However, such differences cannot be detected in high relative humidity environments because the effect of evaporative cooling of leaves is negligible. Nonetheless, leaves maintain their stomata open to permit the uptake of CO2, and differences {{in the rate of}} CO2 fixation may lead to differences in leaf conductance that can be measured using a porometer. Porometry can be used to screen individual plants. The heritability of stomatal conductance is reasonably high, with reported values typically in the range of 0.5 to 0.8. Plants can be assessed for leaf conductance using a viscous flow porometer that is available on the market (Thermoline and CSIRO, Australia). This instrument can give a relative measure of stomatal conductance in a few seconds, making it possible to identify physiologically superior genotypes from within bulks.|$|E

40|$|Tympanic {{temperature}} (Tty) {{is considered}} a valid index of brain temperature (1). However, several researchers have questioned its validity {{as a measure of}} brain temperature because it may be significantly influenced by ambient temperature (2, 3). In spite of this controversy, use of a portable, noninvasive, infrared thermometer to assess tympanic temperature has become wide-spread. Although <b>infrared</b> <b>thermometry</b> has been validated against other indices of core temperature during hypothermic conditions in humans (4), comparison of <b>infrared</b> <b>thermometry</b> to direct assessment of brain temperature has not been made. Furthermore, whether infrared Tty may provide a better index of elevated brain temperature when ambient temperature is held constant is unknown.

Methods Systematic review of studies comparing rectal and infrared ear temperatures in children. Results Sensitivity and specificity estimates were highly heterogeneous, and displayed an inverse relationship suggestive of a threshold effect, {{due in part to}} the different offsets used to obtain adjusted tympanic temperatures depending on the ear thermometer mode. To account for this threshold effect, results from each study were summarized as a diagnostic odds ratio (DOR). These varied extensively across studies, suggesting that heterogeneity between study estimates is not fully explained by the threshold effect. Pooled estimates of {{sensitivity and specificity}} from random effects models were 63. 7 % (95 % CI 55. 6 %, 71. 8 %) and 95. 2 % (95 % CI 93. 5 %, 96. 9 %), respectively.

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{capability}} of <b>infrared</b> ear <b>thermometry</b> accurately to predict rectal temperature in older patients. <b>Infrared</b> ear <b>thermometry</b> is now commonly used for predicting body temperature in older patients. However, ear thermometry has been insufficiently evaluated in geriatric patients. Prospective, convenience sample, unblinded study. All patients (or their guardians) gave informed consent. Patients hospitalised in a geriatric unit underwent sequential ear and rectal temperatures measurements using two different models of infrared ear thermometers (ThermoScan and Genius) and a rectal probe, respectively. After a brief otoscopic examination, ear temperatures were measured twice at both ears with each thermometer, the highest of four measurements being retained for analysis. The rectal temperature was the reference standard. Hundred patients (31 males), aged 81 (SD 7) years completed the study. The mean rectal temperature was 37. 3 degrees C (SD 0. 7) degrees C (range 36. 3 - 40. 7 degrees C). Eighteen patients were febrile (rectal temperature >= 37. 8 degrees C). The mean bias between rectal and ear temperatures as measured with the ThermoScan was - 0. 20 degrees C (SD 0. 32) degrees C and the 95 % limits of agreement were - 0. 83 degrees C and 0. 42 degrees C (95 % CI, - 0. 88 - 0. 48 degrees C). Using the Genius, the corresponding figures were - 0. 56 degrees C (SD 0. 39) degrees C, - 1. 32 degrees C and 0. 20 degrees C (95 % CI, - 1. 39 - 0. 27 degrees C). After correction for bias, the ThermoScan predicted the level of fever with a maximum error of 0. 7 degrees C (mean error 0. 3 degrees C).

40|$|Background <b>Infrared</b> ear <b>thermometry</b> is {{frequently}} used in children, {{because this is}} a quick method of taking temperature and the ear is easily accessible. Our aim was to evaluate agreement between temperature measured at the rectum and ear in children. Methods We did a systematic review of studies comparing temperature measured at the rectum (the reference site) using mercury, electronic, or indwelling probe thermometers, with temperature measured at the ear (the test site) using infrared ear thermometers. Heterogeneity between studies was investigated by exploring subgroups according to the mode of the infrared ear thermometer. Findings 44 studies containing 58 comparisons (5935 children) were eligible for inclusion in this review. Outcome data were available in reports from 12 comparisons (2312 [39 %] children), and data on individual patients were obtained for a further 19 comparisons (2129 [36 %] children). 31 comparisons (4441 [75 %] children) were therefore included in the meta-analysis. The pooled mean temperature difference (rectal minus ear) was 0 · 29 °C (95 % limits of agreement − 0 · 74 to 1 · 32). We pooled data by ear device mode and the mean temperature differences were rectal mode 0 · 15 °C (− 0 · 95 to 1 · 25), actual 0 · 70 °C (− 0 · 20 to 1 · 60), core 0 · 25 °C (− 0 · 78 to 1 · 27), oral 0 · 34 °C (− 0 · 86 to 1 · 54), tympanic 0 · 62 °C (− 0 · 40 to 1 · 64) and mode not stated 0 · 32 °C (− 0 · 57 to 1 · 21). There was significant residual heterogeneity in both mean differences and sample SDs within the groups of ear device mode.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the suitability of active infrared thermography and thermometry in combination with multivariate statistical partial least squares analysis as rapid soil water content detection techniques both in the laboratory and the field. Such techniques allow fast soil water content measurements helpful in both agricultural and environmental fields. These techniques, based on the theory of heat dissipation, were tested by directly measuring temperature dynamic variation of samples after heating. For the assessment of temperature dynamic variations data were collected during three intervals (3, 6 and 10 s). To account for the presence of specific heats differences between water and soil, the analyses were regulated using slopes to linearly describe their trends. For all analyses, the best model was achieved for a 10 s slope. Three different approaches were considered, two in the laboratory and one in the field. The first laboratory-based one was centred on active infrared thermography, considered measurement of temperature variation as independent variable and reported r = 0. 74.

Several signal processing methods were investigated, to allow automatic recognition of the icing signature. Additionally, several implementation issues were considered. Based on both the static and subscale rotor tests, where ice was successfully detected, the passive IR technique appears to be promising for rotor ice detection...|$|R
40|$|Temperature {{measurement}} in {{an intensive}} care environment requires accurate estimation of core temperature via reliable equipment. Intermittent rectal probes were routinely {{used to measure}} core temperature in all extubated patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) which was the setting for this project. The nursing and medical staff identified various problems associated with this practice and a quality improvement project was implemented to compare temperatures recorded using three different routes: rectal, infrared tympanic and nasopharyngeal. Forty-nine patients {{were included in the}} study. Nasopharyngeal temperature measurements were recorded for all intubated patients and rectal temperature measurements were recorded for all extubated patients. During data collection, infrared tympanic temperature measurements were recorded {{at the same time as}} all other temperature measurements. The main comparison was between the rectal route and the infrared tympanic route because of the problems with the rectal probes that had been identified by staff. The results indicated statistically significant correlations between temperatures measured at the different sites. These results confirmed previous literature and the ICU involved in this study replaced rectal temperature measurement via intermittent probe insertion with <b>infrared</b> tympanic <b>thermometry</b> for the measurement of core temperature in extubated patients...|$|R
