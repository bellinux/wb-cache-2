25|$|Most Mediterranean {{fishing is}} {{confined}} to a 12-mile (22-km) strip considered territorial waters. The EU belongs to the General <b>Fisheries</b> <b>Commission</b> for the Mediterranean (GFCM) and the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna, which also makes recommendations for Mediterranean tuna. In 1994 conservation regulations were introduced banning certain fishing methods. In 1997 targets were set for tuna catches.|$|E
25|$|On {{both sides}} of the Canada–United States border, the {{proliferation}} of dams and impoundments have multiplied, necessitating more regulatory efforts. Concerns by the mid-19th century included obstructions in the rivers which prevented salmon and lake sturgeon from reaching their spawning grounds. The Wisconsin <b>Fisheries</b> <b>Commission</b> noted a reduction of roughly 25% in general fish harvests by 1875. The states have removed dams from rivers where necessary.|$|E
25|$|After {{decades of}} dispute over who should get what {{quantity}} of the Pacific Salmon catch, in 1937 Canada and the United States successfully negotiated a joint management and catch agreement, called the Pacific Salmon Convention (PSC). This convention created the International Pacific Salmon <b>Fisheries</b> <b>Commission</b> (IPSFC), {{which was to}} carry out the convention's mandate and conduct an eight-year study of pacific salmon. The Commission would shape their mandate based on findings from this research.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of WWII and {{the signing of the}} San Francisco Peace Treaty in 1952, Canada, Japan, and the United States of America entered into a trilateral fisheries convention known as the International Convention for the High Seas Fisheries of the North Pacific Ocean. The Convention was signed by all three parties in Tokyo on 9 May 1952 and entered into force on 12 June 1953, thereby creating the International North Pacific <b>Fisheries</b> <b>Commission</b> (INPFC). INPFC nations worked to ensure the maximum sustained productivity of fishery resources in the North Pacific Ocean while encouraging conservation and contributed to the understanding of anadromous fish species, groundfishes, crabs, and marine mammals in the North Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea by publishing scientific bulletins, annual fisheries statistics, and annual reports.|$|E
25|$|The Icelandic Coast Guard's (ICG) {{primary mission}} is the {{defending}} the Icelandic sovereignty, {{integrity of the}} territorial waters, maintaining Icelandic law and order inside the 200 nm wide Economic zone {{as well as other}} vital missions such as Search and Rescue. The Coast Guard operates JRCC-Iceland which is responsible for search and rescue of vessels and aircraft in Iceland's search and rescue region (SRR) according to International Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue (IAMSAR) Manual. Additionally the ICG is in the charge of defusing naval mines, most of which were laid during the Second World War, and monitoring fisheries in International waters outside of the Icelandic Economic zone in order to blacklist any vessel partaking in unregulated fishing and thus bar them from receiving services from any member of the North East Atlantic <b>Fisheries</b> <b>Commission</b> in order to make unregulated fishing unprofitable. The Icelandic Coast Guard also occasionally operates within Greenlandic and Faeroese waters, following a bilateral agreement with Denmark regarding mutual aid in security, rescue and defence matters.|$|E
25|$|In 1917, with America {{taking part}} in World War I, {{more and more women}} began to work the various stalls and shops in the Market as their husbands went to war. By the time the war was underway, the Western Avenue {{commission}} houses that had {{led to the creation of}} the Pike Place Market were in decline, being unable to compete directly with the farmers. The net effect was a near complete stop by the time of World War I of the food price profiteering that had been rampant previously. Washington State government took an interest later in insuring that such things would be prevented during the war for the benefit of its citizens. The <b>Fisheries</b> <b>Commission</b> turned over to the Seattle city government dead hatchery salmon that were killed for eggs and sperm to combat rising fish prices. The city created the municipal-owned City Fish Market at Pike Place Market, cutting the cost of salmon by a third. The city-owned fish vendor business would only last until the end of World War I, when it was stopped. In 1918, wanting to spend more time on his other business ventures, Frank sold his stake in the Pike Place Market to his brother Arthur, who took control of most of the business.|$|E

2500|$|Beyond {{national}} jurisdictions, most {{bottom trawling}} is unregulated either {{because there is}} no Regional Fisheries Management Organization (RFMO) with competence to regulate, or else what RFMOs that do exist have not actually regulated.

The North East Atlantic <b>Fisheries</b> <b>Commission</b> (NEAFC) also recently closed four seamounts and part of the mid-Atlantic Ridge from all fishing, including bottom trawling, for three years.
