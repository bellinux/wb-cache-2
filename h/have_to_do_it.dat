5|$|Since Purple Tentacle's {{plans are}} {{flawless}} and unstoppable, Dr. Fred decides {{to use his}} Chron-o-John time machines to send Bernard, Laverne and Hoagie to the day before to turn off his Sludge-o-Matic machine, thereby preventing Purple Tentacle's exposure to the sludge.Bernard: Isn't it a little late for that, Doctor?Dr. Fred: Of course! That's why I'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it...</b> YESTERDAY! To the time machine!}} However, because Dr. Fred used an imitation diamond rather than a real diamond as a power source for the time machine, the Chron-o-Johns breaks down in operation. Laverne is sent 200 years in the future, where humanity has been enslaved and Purple Tentacle rules {{the world from the}} Edison mansion, while Hoagie is dropped 200 years in the past, where the motel is being used by the Founding Fathers as a retreat to write the United States Constitution. Bernard is returned to the present. To salvage Dr. Fred's plan, Bernard must acquire a replacement diamond for the time machine, while Hoagie and Laverne must restore power to their respective Chron-o-John pods by plugging them in.Bernard: Well, hurry up and bring them back! Dr. Fred: I will, as soon as I get a new diamond! Then all your buddies have to do is plug in their respective Chron-o-Johns and—Bernard: Plug them in?!? Where is Hoagie going to find an electrical outlet two hundred years in the past!?!Dr. Fred: Yes... well... He'll be needing my patented superbattery then, won't he?}} To overcome the lack of electricity in the past, Hoagie recruits the help of Benjamin Franklin and Dr. Fred's ancestor, Red Edison, to build a superbattery to power his pod, while Laverne evades capture by the tentacles long enough to run an extension cord to her unit. The three send small objects back and forth in time through the Chron-o-Johns and make changes to history to help the others complete their tasks.|$|E
25|$|In these crucial seconds, {{which the}} Tribunal {{found to be}} around a minute's duration, the ERU team hesitated in opening fire, {{continuing}} to plead with Carthy to surrender. The hesitation was so complete that local armed officers in the outer perimeter began to think the ERU team would not fire and one remarked we're gonna <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> ourselves and were within a second of opening fire when Garda McCabe took action.|$|E
25|$|I {{just had}} to lay it down, more or less: first track... second track – you know, really fast working on that. And all the guitar overdubs on Presence were done in one night. But I didn't think I {{would be able to}} do it in one night, I thought I'd <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> across maybe three {{different}} nights to get the individual sections. Everything sort of crystallised and you'll notice everything was just pouring out. I was very happy with the guitar playing on that whole album, you know as far as the maturity of playing goes.|$|E

After class, Edna and Principal Skinner's apple picking date is cancelled when Skinner's mother, Agnes, interrupts. At the Simpson house, Bart is distracted from writing his paper, {{and at the end}} of the three weeks, he still has not started the assignment. The day before the date of submission, he asks Grampa for help. Edna rejects Bart's paper and tells him that he will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> correctly after school. As Bart finishes the assignment after school, supervised by Edna herself, he observes Skinner cancel a movie date with Edna when Agnes calls. Bart consoles Edna, and she reluctantly accepts his offer to accompany her to the movie.|$|E
25|$|So I {{wrote this}} song that I loved and I {{sent it to}} them and he and Joel, I remember, left me a great message saying, I hate you, you bastard, I love this song. We're gonna <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> We're gonna have to re-build the Wiltern Theater, which they had taken down, it was {{a million dollars to}} re-do the ending... and I felt all his hostility for Universal. A guy named Sean Daniels, who was head of production, one day said to me, well there is hostility because we {{understand}} you waited about eight months to come up with that final song and you never did it. I said, where'd you hear that? I did it in two days. He said, Jimmy Iovine. So I went to Jimmy Iovine and I said all that to his, yeah it's true, I know. I blamed you but you can't be upset with me. I'm not like a writer. I've gotta make my way with these people. I had to have a scapegoat.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, after {{releasing}} {{their fifth}} studio album, the Make-Up dissolved, reportedly [...] "due {{to the large}} number of counter-gang copy groups which had appropriated their look and sound and applied it to vacuous and counter-revolutionary forms".

500|$|Despite being {{based on}} a New Orleans funk sample, the song belies a strong go-go influence. [...] Harrison likened the two based on their heavy use of {{percussion}} and chant.

I was like, 'We <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> in an up-tempo way because when you hear {{it on the radio}} in D.C., it's fast.' ... So it's a fresh sound for everybody but people in the D.C./Maryland/Virginia area. They [...] know what it is." [...] The song is composed in the key of D # minor, moving at a tempo of 100 beats per minute in common time. [...] It uses four-measure phrases with a VIb-I-VIIb-VIb-IV chord progression. [...] The first four chords are played on the measure's downbeat, and off-beat syncopation is used for the fifth chord.|$|E
500|$|The Mets' Ron Darling took {{a no-hitter}} and 4–0 lead into {{the eighth inning}} against the Phillies on June 28 at the Vet before 52,206 fans.

Juan Samuel then singled {{to break up the}} shutout, and the Phillies came back with nine hits against Jesse Orosco and Roger McDowell, scoring five runs to win 5–4. It would have been the first no-hitter in Mets history. Compounding the loss for the Mets, the Phillies were in last place at the time, and the loss dropped the Mets [...] games behind the first-place Cardinals who they would play the next day.

500|$|During Howard's solo concerts from 1983to 1999, [...] "Shivers" [...] was {{the song}} most {{requested}} by audience members.

In an October 2009 interview, Howard commented on his relationship with the song, and its position in his setlists, stating: [...] "I have just tried, perhaps finally successfully, to divorce myself from the song. It's impossible for me to recreate what I was trying to do when I wrote that song so whilst I can see that people have an attachment to it, I don't. I feel like, when I did use to do it in shows, I was doing a cover of some song that had been around forever. That's how it felt.

500|$|In 2002, Hertwig {{published}} her memoirs {{under the}} title Ich muß doch meinen Vater lieben, oder? ("I do have to love my father, don't I?").

Kalder committed suicide in 1983 shortly after giving an interview in Jon Blair's documentary Schindler. Hertwig's experiences in dealing with her father's crimes are detailed in Inheritance, a 2006 documentary directed by James Moll. Appearing in the documentary is Helen Jonas-Rosenzweig, one of Göth's former housemaids. The documentary details the meeting of the two women at the Płaszów memorial site in Poland. Hertwig had requested the meeting, but Jonas-Rosenzweig was hesitant because her memories of Göth and the concentration camp were so traumatic. She eventually agreed after Hertwig wrote to her, [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> for the murdered people." [...] Jonas felt touched by this sentiment and agreed to meet her.|$|E
500|$|The first single, [...] "Heroin", was {{accompanied}} {{with the most}} music videos, {{with a total of}} five for several different remixed versions of the cover.

Four of the music videos for the song were directed by Brett Leonard, with a fifth being credited to Howard Deutch. Each used stock footage shot by Idol and Leonard, filmed personally and edited on Idol's computer. Idol did so with the intention of sending a [...] "do-it-yourself" [...] message that mocked and rejected the standards of MTV music video creation. [...] "We did it all on camcorder and we sort of wanted to say {{you can make your own}} videos, and you don't always <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> in a very MTV way."
