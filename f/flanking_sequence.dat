40|$|We have {{isolated}} four clones {{of integrated}} human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV- 16) DNA from four different primary cervical cancer specimens. All clones {{were found to}} be monomeric or dimeric forms of HPV- 16 DNA with cellular <b>flanking</b> <b>sequences</b> at both ends. Analysis of the viral sequences in these clones showed that E 6 /E 7 open reading frames and the long control region were conserved and that no region specific for the integration was detected. Analysis of the cellular <b>flanking</b> <b>sequences</b> revealed no significant homology with any known human DNA sequences, except Alu sequences, and no homology among the clones, indicating no cellular sequence specific for the integration. By probing with single-copy cellular <b>flanking</b> <b>sequences</b> from the clones, it was demonstrated that the integrated HPV- 16 DNAs, with different sizes in the same specimens, shared the same cellular <b>flanking</b> <b>sequences</b> at the ends.

40|$|AbstractBackground: HTLV I Tax is {{believed}} to activate viral gene expression by binding bZIP proteins (such as CRIB) and increasing their affinities for proviral THE target sites. Each 21 by THE target site contains an imperfect copy of the intrinsically bent CRE target site (the TRE core) surrounded by highly conserved <b>flanking</b> <b>sequences.</b> These <b>flanking</b> <b>sequences</b> are essential for maximal increases in DNA affinity and transactivation, but they are not, apparently, contacted by protein. Here we employ non-denaturing gel electrophoresis to evaluate TRE conformation in the presence and absence of bZIP proteins, and to explore the role of DNA conformation in viral transactivation. Results: Our {{results show that the}} TRE- 1 <b>flanking</b> <b>sequences</b> modulate the structure and modestly increase the affinity of a CREB bZIP peptide for the TRE- 1 core recognition <b>sequence.</b> These <b>flanking</b> <b>sequences</b> are also essential for a maximal increase in stability of the CREB-DNA complex in the presence of Tax. Conclusions: The CRE-like TRE core and the TRE <b>flanking</b> <b>sequences</b> are both essential for formation of stable CRIB-TRE- 1 and Tax-CREB-TRE- 1 complexes. These two DNA segments may have co-evolved into a unique structure capable of recognizing Tax and a bZIP protein...|$|R

50|$|The first {{inhibitory}} {{structure is}} folded by an extended transcript (i.e. -30/99 transcript, coordinates are referenced against the self-cleavage site) spanning from 30 nt upstream of the cleavage site to 15 nt downstream of the 3'-end. The <b>flanking</b> <b>sequence</b> sequesters the ribozyme in a kinetic trap during transcription {{and results in}} the extremely diminished self-cleavage rate. This self-cleavage-preventing structure includes 3 alternative stems: Alt1, Alt2 and Alt3, which disrupt the active conformation. Alt1 is a 10-bp Long-Range-Interaction formed by an inhibitory upstream stretch (-25/-15 nt) and the downstream stretch (76/86 nt). The Alt1 disrupts the stem P2 in the active conformation wherein P2 is proposed to have an activating role for both genomic and antigenomic ribozyme. Alt2 is an interaction between upstream <b>flanking</b> <b>sequence</b> and the ribozyme, and Alt3 is a nonnative ribozyme-ribozyme interaction. The secondary structure of this inhibitory conformation is supported by various experimental approaches. First, direct probing via ribonucleases was performed and the subsequent modeling via mfold 3.0 using constraints from the probing results agrees with the proposed structure. Second, a series of DNA oligomer complementary to different regions of AS1/2 were used to rescue the ribozyme activity; the results confirms the inhibitory roles of AS1/2. Third, mutational analysis introduces single/double mutations outside the ribozyme to ensure the observed ribozyme activity is directly associated with {{the stability of the}} Alt1. The stability of AS1 is found to be inversely related to the self-cleavage activity26.|$|E

In this study, the T-DNA insertion sites and <b>flanking</b> <b>sequences</b> were identified in two newly developed transgenic glyphosate-tolerant soybeans GE-J 16 and ZH 10 - 6 based on whole genome sequencing (WGS) method. About 21 Gb sequence data (~ 21 × coverage) for each line was generated on Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. The junction reads mapped to boundary of T-DNA and <b>flanking</b> <b>sequences</b> in these two events were identified by comparing all sequencing reads with soybean reference genome and sequence of transgenic vector. The putative insertion loci and <b>flanking</b> <b>sequences</b> were further confirmed by PCR amplification, Sanger sequencing, and co-segregation analysis.

To investigate whether naturally occurring variations in the <b>flanking</b> <b>sequences</b> of an immunodominant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) Gag CTL epitope prevent antigen processing, cells infected with HIV- 1 or vaccinia virus constructs encoding different patient-derived Gag sequences were tested for recognition by HLA-A* 0201 -restricted, p 17 -specific CTL. We found that the immunodominant p 17 epitope (SL 9) and its variants were efficiently processed from minigene expressing vectors and from six HIV- 1 Gag variants expressed by recombinant vaccinia virus constructs. Furthermore, SL 9 -specific CTL clones derived from multiple donors efficiently inhibited virus replication when added to HLA-A* 0201 -bearing cells infected with primary or laboratory-adapted strains of virus, despite the variability in the SL 9 <b>flanking</b> <b>sequences.</b> These data suggest that escape from this immunodominant CTL response is not frequently accomplished by changes in the epitope <b>flanking</b> <b>sequences...</b>|$|R

A probabilistic approach to model protein-DNA interactions at the sequence level is through Position Weight Matrices (PWMs) that estimate the joint probability of a DNA binding site sequence by assuming positional independence within the DNA sequence.

Although such gene rearrangements are nonuniformly distributed in the human genome, the underlying mutational mechanisms remain unclear. We have studied the potential involvement of various types of repetitive sequence elements in the formation of secondary structure intermediates between the single-stranded DNA ends that recombine during rearrangements. Complexity analysis was used to assess the potential of these ends to form secondary structures, the maximum decrease in complexity consequent to a gross rearrangement being used as an indicator of the type of repeat and the specific DNA ends involved. A total of 175 pairs of deletion/translocation breakpoint junction sequences available from the Gross Rearrangement Breakpoint Database [GRaBD; www. uwcm. ac. uk/uwcm/mg/grabd/grabd. html] were analyzed. Potential secondary structure was noted between the 5 ' <b>flanking</b> <b>sequence</b> of the first breakpoint and the 3 ' <b>flanking</b> <b>sequence</b> of the second breakpoint in 49 % of rearrangements and between the 5 ' <b>flanking</b> <b>sequence</b> of the second breakpoint and the 3 ' <b>flanking</b> <b>sequence</b> of the first breakpoint in 36 % of rearrangements. Inverted repeats, inversions of inverted repeats, and symmetric elements were found in association with gross rearrangements at approximately the same frequency. However, inverted repeats and inversions of inverted repeats accounted for the vast majority (83 %) of deletions plus small insertions, symmetric elements for one-half of all antigen receptor-mediated translocations, while direct repeats appear only to be involved in mediating simple deletions.
