5|$|Vineta {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Imperial <b>Dockyard</b> in Danzig in 1896. She was {{launched}} on 9 December 1897 and was commissioned into the fleet on 13 September 1899. She cost 10,714,000marks. Hansa, the last ship of the class, was laid down in 1896 at AG Vulcan under construction number 235. She was launched on 12 March 1898 and was commissioned on 20 April 1899, {{at the cost of}} 10,270,000marks.

5|$|Andromeda was {{the fifth}} ship of her name {{to serve in the}} Royal Navy and was laid down on 2 December 1895 by Pembroke <b>Dockyard.</b> The ship was {{launched}} on 30 April 1897 by Lady Scourfield, wife of Sir Owen Scourfield Bt. She was fitted out at Pembroke Dock until 5 September 1898 and sailed later that month to Portsmouth <b>Dockyard</b> for completion.|$|E

5000|$|During {{and after}} World War One, (1917 to 1919) further {{restructuring}} with the Admiralty {{was taking place}} a new post of Deputy Controller for <b>Dockyards</b> and Shipbuilding to which the Director of <b>Dockyards</b> and Repairs would now report to. The department under this name would remain in place until 1957 when it was renamed <b>Dockyards</b> and Fleet Maintenance Department {{under the control of}} a Director-General until 1964 [...] following the merger of the Admiralty into a new and much larger Ministry of Defence under the Navy Department it was again renamed as the Department of <b>Dockyards</b> and Maintenance until 1968 [...] In 1969 overall responsibility for <b>dockyards</b> changed and now came under the control of a new Chief Executive, Royal <b>Dockyards.</b> who was head of the Royal <b>Dockyards</b> Management Board.|$|R

5|$|Deptford <b>Dockyard</b> was {{established}} in 1513 by Henry VIII as the first Royal <b>Dockyard,</b> building vessels for the Royal Navy, and was at one time known as the King's Yard. It was shut down from 1830 to 1844 before being closed as a <b>dockyard</b> in 1869, and is currently known as Convoys Wharf. From 1871 until the First World War it was the City of London Corporation's Foreign Cattle Market. In 1912 The Times reported that over 4 million head of live cattle, and sheep, had been landed.|$|E

5000|$|In December 1885 {{the post}} of Surveyor of <b>Dockyards</b> was {{abolished}} and replaced by a Director of <b>Dockyards</b> [...] The new Director was instructed to visit the <b>dockyards</b> frequently, [...] "for the purpose of conferring personally with the superintendents and officers {{in regard to the}} ships and works in progress." [...] However inefficiencies led to a recommendation by George Robinson, Lord Ripon in which he suggested there should be a separation of the functions and duties of the naval designing and building branches, that would remain distinct from each other [...] and that all branches should both cordinate and operate a sort of checks and balance system [...] A set of instructions issued on 28 May 1886 communicated that the Director of <b>Dockyards</b> would no longer be subordinate to the Director of Naval Construction , instead he was made soley responsible to the Controller for the building of ships at <b>dockyards,</b> and for the maintenance and repair of ships and boats, and of all steam machinery in ships, boats, <b>dockyards,</b> and factories [...] In 1892 {{the post of}} Director of <b>Dockyards</b> was changed to Director of <b>Dockyards</b> and Works until 1913 when it was again renamed to Director of <b>Dockyards</b> and Repair.|$|R
50|$|In the Royal Naval <b>Dockyards,</b> admiral-superintendents {{ceased to}} be {{appointed}} after 15 September 1971, and existing post-holders were renamed port admirals.

50|$|The {{policy was}} {{continued}} by Colbert, Louis XIV’s Navy Minister, who developed several major <b>dockyards.</b> He extended the <b>dockyards</b> in Toulon, ordered the excavation of the docks in Brest and founded the Rochefort <b>dockyards.</b> His son, Seignelay, who succeeded him in 1683, followed in his footsteps.|$|R
5|$|In March 1960 the Royal Navy ceased {{operating}} the Sheerness <b>dockyard</b> and the Medway Port Authority {{took over the}} site for commercial use. The <b>dockyard</b> closure led to thousands of job losses, {{and most of the}} nearby houses and shops in the Bluetown area were eventually abandoned and demolished. By the 1961 census, the population of Sheerness had fallen to 13,691. The <b>dockyard</b> closure also led to the decline of the Sheerness and District Cooperative Society, as many of its members were <b>dockyard</b> workers. At the time, the society was the island's main retailer, but it has since been reduced to a few shops and been merged with a larger society.|$|E
5|$|Penelope, {{named after}} the wife of Odysseus, was the fifth ship of her name {{to serve in the}} Royal Navy. She was ordered in February 1865 and was the first iron-hulled ship to be built at Pembroke <b>Dockyard.</b> The ship was laid down on 4 September and was {{launched}} by the wife of the new Captain-Superintendent of the <b>dockyard,</b> Captain Robert Hall, on 18 June 1867.|$|E

5|$|The RAN {{originally}} intended to order up to ten DDLs. All the ships were {{to be built in}} Australia to maintain local shipbuilding capabilities, and Australian industry was to be involved to the greatest possible extent. Production of the ships was to be evenly split between Cockatoo Island <b>Dockyard</b> in Sydney and Williamstown Naval <b>Dockyard</b> in Melbourne.|$|E
5|$|Achilles, {{named after}} the Greek mythological hero, was ordered on 10 April 1861 from the Chatham <b>Dockyard.</b> She was the first iron-hulled warship to be built at a royal <b>dockyard</b> and her {{construction}} was delayed {{by the need to}} acquire the necessary machinery to handle iron and to train the workers to use it. The ship was laid down on 1 August 1861 in a drydock and was floated out rather than being launched on 23 December 1863. Achilles was completed on 26 November 1864 at the cost of £469,572.|$|E
5|$|Deptford's {{economic}} {{history has been}} strongly connected to the <b>Dockyard</b> - when the <b>Dockyard</b> was thriving, so Deptford thrived; with the docks now all closed, Deptford has declined economically. However, areas of Deptford are being gradually re-developed and gentrified - and the local council has plans to regenerate the riverside and the town centre. A large former industrial site by the Thames called Convoys Wharf is scheduled for redeveloping into mixed use buildings. This will involve the construction of around 3,500 new homes and {{an extension of the}} town centre northwards towards the river.|$|E
50|$|The {{appointment}} of admiral-superintendents (or their junior equivalents) dates from 1832 when the Admiralty {{took charge of}} the Royal <b>Dockyards.</b> Prior to this larger <b>dockyards</b> were overseen by a commissioner who represented the Navy Board.|$|R

5|$|Friedrich der Grosse {{was ordered}} by the Imperial Navy from the Imperial <b>Dockyard</b> in Kiel; her keel was laid in 1871 under {{construction}} number 1. The ship was launched on 20 September 1874 and commissioned into the German fleet on 22 November 1877. Although laid down a year before her sister , Friedrich der Grosse was not completed until a year after; this was because she was built at a newly established and inexperienced Imperial <b>Dockyard,</b> while Preussen was built by AG Vulcan, an experienced private shipbuilder. The ship cost the German government 7,303,000gold marks.|$|E
5|$|HMS Empress of India, {{named after}} a regnal title of Queen Victoria, was the first ship of her name {{to serve in the}} Royal Navy. She was ordered under the Naval Defence Act Programme of 1889 with the name of Renown and was laid down on 9 July 1889 at Pembroke <b>Dockyard.</b> The ship was renamed before she was {{launched}} on 7 May 1891 by Louise Margaret, Duchess of Connaught and Strathearn. One man was killed when a cable snapped the following day. The ship was then transferred to Chatham <b>Dockyard,</b> where she was completed in August 1893, at a cost of £912,612.|$|E
50|$|It {{should be}} noted that {{throughout}} its history, the Royal Navy has (when necessary) made extensive use of private shipyards and <b>dockyards,</b> both at home and abroad, and continues to do so. Nevertheless, since the reign of Henry VIII it has also made a point of establishing and maintaining its own <b>dockyards.</b> These Royal Navy <b>dockyards</b> have always had a dual function: shipbuilding and ship repair/maintenance; historically, most yards provided for both, but some specialized in one or the other.|$|R

5|$|Ordered {{under the}} {{contract}} name Ersatz Hagen {{as a replacement}} for the obsolete coastal defense ship , Kaiserin was laid down at the Howaldtswerke <b>dockyard</b> in Kiel in November 1910. She was launched on 11 November 1911, after which fitting-out work was completed. At the launching ceremony, Admiral Hans von Koester gave a speech and Princess Victoria Louise christened the ship. A <b>dockyard</b> crew delivered the ship to the Navy on 13 May 1913; she was commissioned into the fleet the following day. During trials the ship's turbine engines were damaged, and Kaiserin did not join the fleet until 13 December 1913.|$|E

5|$|Sheerness {{began as}} a fort built in the 16th century to protect the River Medway from naval invasion. In 1665 plans were first laid by the Navy Board for Sheerness <b>Dockyard,</b> a {{facility}} where warships might be provisioned and repaired. The site was favoured by Samuel Pepys, then Clerk of the Acts of the navy, for shipbuilding over Chatham inland. After the raid on the Medway in 1667, the older fortification was strengthened; in 1669 a Royal Navy <b>dockyard</b> {{was established in the}} town, where warships were stocked and repaired until its closure in 1960.|$|E
50|$|The Survey first covers each of {{the royal}} <b>dockyards</b> on the Thames and Medway - Chatham, Sheerness, Woolwich and Deptford - {{as well as the}} Navy Office, before dealing with the <b>dockyards</b> at Portsmouth and Plymouth.
