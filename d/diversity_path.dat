We extend this formalism {{to the case of}} spatial diversity, realized by employing multiple antennas at each node. Based on this framework, one can efficiently analyze and design Rayleigh-faded MIMO ad hoc networks that employ selection combining. The mathematically tractable definition of the erristor term greatly simplifies the study of a multiple-antenna network and helps solve problems based on end-to-end reliability or resource allocation easily, which we illustrate in an example. Moreover, this technique demonstrates the superiority in performance of MIMO over single-antenna routing schemes, particularly at high SNR. I...|$|E

Firstly, in most existing works on distributed space time block coding (DSTBC), the destination node {{is assumed to}} have perfect channel state information (CSI), thus, signal recovery is straight forward. In practice however, some scenarios exist whereby the destination node is unable to acquire CSI. Consequently, this work incorporates differential concepts with DSTBC to facilitate signal recovery in cooperative networks operating in environments where CSI acquisition is impractical. Secondly, different from most works on DSTBC which assume that the source-destination link is unavailable, the proposed scheme employs a source-assisting (SA) strategy that exploits the additional <b>diversity</b> <b>path</b> provided by the source-destination link.

Network operators are struggling to optimize their routing, but the effectiveness of those efforts is limited. In this article, we study sensitivity of routing stretch and diversity metrics to factors such as policies, topology, IGP weights etc. using statistical techniques. We confirm previous findings that routing policies and AS size (in number of routers) are the dominating factors. Surprisingly, we find that intra-domain factors only have marginal impact on global path properties. Moreover, we study path inflation by comparing against the paths that are shortest in terms of AS-level/router-level hops or geographic distances. Overall, the majority of routes incur reasonable stretch.

40|$|Growing {{demand for}} {{multi-band}} wireless systems has emphasized tunable highly linear filtering without sacrificing cost or form factor. The 3 G/ 4 G frequency-division duplex (FDD) cellular {{systems such as}} long-term evolution (LTE) {{are more prone to}} interference from strong blockers associated primarily with the co-located transmit signal. In an LTE receiver (RX), transmit signal introduces a strong out-of-band (OOB) blocker, transmit (TX) leakage, placing stringent linearity and power-handling capability requirements at the diversity RXs. In conventional multi-band systems, a large number of SAW filters are used and single-pole multi-throw switches select the appropriate SAW filter for the desired channel. The cascaded insertion loss of the filter and switch, impose a significant noise performance degradation. Therefore, filtering solutions that are tunable, blocker tolerant, and highly linear are critical to extending multi-band schemes. In this research work, tunable filters are proposed with offset band-reject filtering to address TX leakage. First, a N-path filter is demonstrated in 45 -nm CMOS SOI technology and consists of a combination of tunable band-pass and band-reject filtering. A tunable filter was presented with more than a decade tuning range, high linearity and blocker tolerance for a SAW-less <b>diversity</b> <b>path</b> receiver in FDD cellular systems. The 3 -dB bandwidth (BW) of the pass band is greater than 80 MHz with an independently tunable reject band, providing the ultimate rejection is 33 dB to 41 dB while the pass band insertion loss is between 2. 6 dB and 4. 3 dB over the tuning range. The proposed filter offers 29 -dBm OOB 3 rd-order input-intercept power (IIP 3) and 22 -dBm in band (IB) IIP 3 with a 10 -dBm blocker 1 -dB compression point (B 1 dB). Then, A channel-selecting low-noise amplifier (CS-LNA) with blocker filtering is presented for a SAW-less <b>diversity</b> <b>path</b> receiver in frequency-division duplexing cellular systems. A hybrid -path bandpass filter/band-reject filter (BPF/BRF) feedback network is applied to the LNA to create close-in reject bands around the passband to suppress transmit leakage and improve the out-of-band (OOB) input-referred third-order intercept point (IIP 3). Control of the frequency and depth of the reject bands is demonstrated with analysis and simulation. A cancellation linearization is applied to improve the in-band (IB) linearity. Adaptive LO swing and silicon-on-insulator (SOI) thick-oxide devices are demonstrated to improve the power-handling capability. The proposed CS-LNA is implemented in 32 -nm CMOS SOI and operates from 0. 4 to 6 GHz with the maximum rejection larger than 60 dB and power-handling capability up to 17 dBm. The prototype demonstrates an OOB IIP 3 of 36 dBm and IB IIP 3 of 10 dBm at 1 GHz.

It results in the lowest bit error rate (BER) compared to all other combining techniques. However the BER starts to deteriorate as errors are introduced in the channel coefficients estimation. A novel combining technique, termed Generalized Maximal Ratio Combining (GMRC) with a polynomial kernel, yields an identical BER as MRC with perfect channel estimation and a lower BER {{in the presence of}} channel estimation errors. We show that GMRC outperforms the optimal MRC scheme in general and we hereinafter introduce it to the scientific community as a new “supraoptimal” algorithm. Since diversity combining is especially effective in small femto- and pico-cells, internet-associated wireless peripheral systems are to benefit most from GMRC. As a result, many spinoff applications can be made to IP-based 4 th generation networks.

40|$|In this thesis, space-time block codes {{originally}} developed for multiple antenna systems are extended to cooperative multi-hop networks. The designs are applicable to any wireless network setting especially cellular, adhoc and sensor networks where space limitations preclude {{the use of}} multiple antennas. The thesis first investigates the design of distributed orthogonal and quasi-orthogonal space time block codes in cooperative networks with single and multiple antennas at the destination. Numerical and simulation results show that by employing multiple receive antennas the diversity performance of the network is further improved at the expense of slight modification of the detection scheme. The thesis then focuses on designing distributed space time block codes for cooperative networks in which the source node participates in cooperation. Based on this, a source-assisting strategy is proposed for distributed orthogonal and quasi-orthogonal space time block codes. Numerical and simulation results show that the source-assisting strategy exhibits improved diversity performance compared to the conventional distributed orthogonal and quasi-orthogonal designs. Motivated by the problem of channel state information acquisition in practical wireless network environments, the design of differential distributed space time block codes is investigated. Specifically, a co-efficient vector-based differential encoding and decoding scheme is proposed for cooperative networks. The thesis then explores the concatenation of differential strategies with several distributed space time block coding schemes namely; the Alamouti code, square-real orthogonal codes, complex-orthogonal codes, and quasiorthogonal codes, using cooperative networks with different number of relay nodes. In order to cater for high data rate transmission in non-coherent cooperative networks, differential distributed quasi-orthogonal space-time block codes which are capable of achieving full code-rate and full diversity are proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that the differential distributed quasi-orthogonal space-time block codes outperform existing distributed space time block coding schemes in terms of code rate and bit-error-rate performance. A multidifferential distributed quasi-orthogonal space-time block coding scheme is also proposed to exploit the additional <b>diversity</b> <b>path</b> provided by the source-destination link. A major challenge is how to construct full rate codes for non-coherent cooperative broadband networks with more than two relay nodes while exploiting the achievable spatial and frequency diversity. In this thesis, full rate quasi-orthogonal codes are designed for noncoherent cooperative broadband networks where channel state information is unavailable. From this, a generalized differential distributed quasi-orthogonal space-frequency coding scheme is proposed for cooperative broadband networks. The proposed scheme is able to achieve full rate and full spatial and frequency diversity in cooperative networks with any number of relays. Through pairwise error probability analysis we show that the diversity gain of the proposed scheme can be improved by appropriate code construction and sub-carrier allocation. Based on this, sufficient conditions are derived for the proposed code structure at the source node and relay nodes to achieve full spatial and frequency diversity. In order to exploit the additional diversity paths provided by the source-destination link, a novel multidifferential distributed quasi-orthogonal space-frequency coding scheme is proposed. The overall objective of the new scheme is {{to improve the quality of}} the detected signal at the destination with negligible increase in the computational complexity of the detector. Finally, a differential distributed quasi-orthogonal space-time-frequency coding scheme is proposed to cater for high data rate transmission and improve the performance of noncoherent cooperative broadband networks operating in highly mobile environments. The approach is to integrate the concept of distributed space-time-frequency coding with differential modulation, and employ rotated constellation quasi-orthogonal codes. From this, we design a scheme which is able to address the problem of performance degradation in highly selective fading environments while guaranteeing non-coherent signal recovery and full code rate in cooperative broadband networks. The coding scheme employed in this thesis relaxes the assumption of constant channel variation in the temporal and frequency dimensions over long symbol periods, thus performance degradation is reduced in frequencyselective and time-selective fading environments. Simulation results illustrate the performance of the proposed differential distributed quasi-orthogonal space-time-frequency coding scheme under different channel conditions...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Path {{disruptions}} {{are frequent}} occurrences on today’s Internet. They {{may be due}} to congestion or failures, which in turn may be attributed to unintentional factors (e. g., hardware failures) or caused by malicious activity. Several efforts to-date have focused on enhancing robustness from the end-to-end viewpoint by using <b>path</b> <b>diversity.</b> Most of these studies are limited to single- or two-path approaches. This paper is the first to address the question of what degree of <b>path</b> <b>diversity</b> is needed to effectively mitigate the effect of path failures. We seek to answer this question through extensive experiments in PlanetLab. To evaluate the effect of <b>path</b> <b>diversity</b> on routing robustness in regards to a wide spectrum of applications, we introduce a new performance metric we named outage duration. Experimental results show that proactively forwarding packets using a high degree of <b>path</b> <b>diversity</b> is more effective in overcoming path failures in comparison with single-path or two-path approaches. In addition, for applications in which low packet loss probability is as important as uninterrupted connectivity, we suggest a packet forwarding scheme based on link gains and discuss the trade-offs between robustness and packet delivery probability...|$|R
