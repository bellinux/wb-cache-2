5|$|Prior to {{forming the}} New Radicals, lead singer Gregg Alexander {{released}} two solo albums, Michigan Rain (1989) and Intoxifornication (1992). Both albums were commercially unsuccessful, generating no charting singles and receiving mixed reviews from critics. Before forming the group, Alexander <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>dropped</b> by two record labels: A and Epic Records. In 1997, Alexander signed to MCA Records and allegedly received a $600,000 advance.|$|E

5|$|This {{was the end}} of U.S. air support, {{the last}} American {{aircraft}} departing Cambodian airspace on 15 August. From the beginning of Operation Breakfast the U.S. Air Force had dropped 539,129 tons of ordnance on Cambodia, 257,465 tons of which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>dropped</b> during the last six months of the operation. During 1974, Cambodia continued to collapse. More than half of the population had become refugees and malnutrition and disease stalked a nation that had once been the best fed in Southeast Asia.|$|E
5|$|Van der Aue {{worked on}} {{procedures}} for surface decompression and oxygen {{use in the}} early 1950s and during his research found problems with the 1937 tables for long dive times. He {{also found that the}} fast tissues which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>dropped</b> in the 1930s would control decompression in some cases, so he re-introduced the fast compartments to the model, and added an extra slower compartment to better model long-duration dives.|$|E
5|$|At the time, Queensland {{were the}} least {{successful}} team in the Sheffield Shield, and Harvey moved north to Brisbane the following season {{to try to get}} more opportunities to play Sheffield Shield cricket. Harvey joined the Toombul grade club, and made his first-class debut for Queensland against Victoria late in the season, although none of his brothers played for Victoria in this match; Merv had already retired, Neil was representing Australia, and Ray <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>dropped.</b> In his only match for the summer, he scored 1 and 13 and took two catches in each innings as an opener. He was dropped after the match.|$|E

In October 2014, Ed Byrne {{replaced}} Rick Trainor as Principal of King's College London, the latter having served for 10 years. In December 2014, King's announced {{its plans to}} rebrand its name to 'King's London'. It was emphasised {{that there were no}} plans to change the legal name of King's, and that the name 'King's London' was designed to promote King's and to highlight the fact that King's is a university in its own right. King's announced that the rebranding plans <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>dropped</b> in January 2015.|$|E
5|$|Martin's death largely {{took the}} air out of the federal perjury case against Webber. In July 2003, on the day before jury {{selection}} in the case was due to begin, Webber pleaded guilty to the reduced charge of criminal contempt in order to avoid a possible jail sentence. He admitted to having received and repaid $38,200. The deal was subject to a discretionary fine and possible classification of the infraction as a felony by the United States District Court Judge Nancy Edmunds who would rule in September 2003. In exchange for the plea all other charges were dropped against him as were all charges against his father. The charges against Webber's aunt <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>dropped</b> after Martin's death.|$|E
5|$|Royal Oak sank {{with up to}} 3,000tons of {{fuel oil}} aboard, the precise amount being unknown since such records were lost with the ship. Oil leaked from the {{corroding}} hull at an increased rate during the 1990s and concerns about the environmental impact led the Ministry of Defence to consider plans for extracting it. Royal Oaks status as a war grave required that surveys and any proposed techniques for removing the oil be handled sensitively: plans in the 1950s to raise and salvage the wreck <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>dropped</b> in response to public opposition. In addition to the ethical concerns, poorly managed efforts could destabilise the wreck, resulting in a mass release of the remaining oil; the ship also contains many tons of unexploded ordnance.|$|E

5|$|The Allies {{were unaware}} of this and mounted further attacks on the site {{as part of the}} United States Army Air Forces {{experimental}} Operation Aphrodite, involving radio-controlled B-24 Liberators packed with explosives. Two such attacks were mounted but failed; in the second such attack, on 12 August, Lt Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr.– the elder brother of future US President John F. Kennedy– was killed when the drone aircraft exploded prematurely. By the end of the bombing campaign, over 4,100 tons of bombs <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>dropped</b> on Mimoyecques, more than on any other V-weapons site.|$|E
5|$|When {{the teams}} reconvened at Old Trafford for the Third Test, Hutton <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>dropped.</b> The reason {{was said to}} be Hutton's struggles with Lindwall's short-pitched bowling. The {{omission}} generated considerable controversy. and the Australians were pleased, feeling that Hutton was England's best batsman. Hutton's opening position was taken by debutant Emmett. England made three further changes. Young and Pollard replaced Wright and Laker in the bowling department. Coxon was replaced by debutant batsman Jack Crapp. Australia dropped Brown, who had scored 73 runs at 24.33 in three innings, for the all rounder Loxton. Yardley won the toss and elected to bat.|$|E
5|$|As {{the riders}} entered the flat lands near the Belgian coast, the winds became more problematic. Around {{three-quarters of the}} peloton <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>dropped</b> or had {{withdrawn}} from the race {{by the time the}} riders turned back inland. Gert Steegmans (Trek Factory Racing) was blown sideways into a ditch; the wind knocked several other riders over and caused Martin Velits (Etixx-Quick Step) and Lars Bak (Lotto-Soudal) to withdraw from the race. Mark Cavendish crashed and was forced to chase to attempt to rejoin the leading riders. The conditions were so severe that some team officials called for the race to be neutralised to ensure the riders' safety. Shortly afterwards, two large groups came back together. The main peloton was therefore made up of around 100 riders and was approximately two minutes behind the breakaway. The breakaway was caught soon afterwards.|$|E

5|$|Vermigli {{was widely}} {{respected}} and very cautious. He {{was able to}} continue his reform efforts in Lucca without any suspicion of unorthodox views, despite a papal meeting there with Emperor Charles V in 1541. His eventual downfall was caused by two of his followers, one of whom openly questioned papal authority and another who celebrated a Protestant form of the Eucharist. The reconstitution of the Roman Inquisition in 1542 {{may have been in}} part a response to fear that Lucca and other cities would defect from the Catholic Church. The authorities of the Republic of Lucca began to fear that their political independence from the Holy Roman Empire was at stake if their city continued to be viewed as a Protestant haven. Bans on Protestant books heretofore ignored were enforced, religious feasts which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>dropped</b> were reinstated, and religious processions were scheduled to assure Rome of Lucca's loyalty.|$|E

The {{omission}} generated considerable controversy. The Australians were pleased, feeling that Hutton was England's best batsman. Hutton's opening position was taken by debutant Emmett. England made three further changes. Young and Pollard replaced Wright and Laker in the bowling department, thereby reverting from two spinners to one. Coxon, who made his debut in the previous match and opened the bowling, taking match figures of 3/172 and scoring 19 and a duck, was replaced by debutant batsman Crapp. Australia dropped Brown, who had scored 73 runs at 24.33 in three innings, with the all rounder Loxton. Yardley won the toss and elected to bat.|$|E
5|$|As planned, the British raid {{began with}} Hellcat and Wildcat fighters {{strafing}} Tirpitzs anti-aircraft guns and batteries {{located on the}} shore; this attack inflicted heavy casualties on the battleship's gunners, disabled her main anti-aircraft control centre and damaged several guns. The fighters also strafed several anti-aircraft ships in Kaafjord. The 21 Barracudas began their attack shortly afterwards, and hit Tirpitz with a general purpose bomb, three 500-pound semi-armour-piercing bombs and three 1,600-pound bombs within 60 seconds. Overall, ten bombs struck the battleship during the first attack. Most of these bombs did not penetrate the ship's armoured deck as they <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>dropped</b> from too low an altitude. Hundreds {{of members of the}} ship's crew died or were wounded; her commanding officer, Captain Hans Meyer, was among the wounded and another officer assumed command. The battleship also drifted into the western shore of Kaafjord and ran aground, but was quickly refloated. One of 830 Squadron's Barracudas crashed following the attack with the loss of all three members of its crew. The surviving aircraft of the first wave began landing on the carriers at 6:19 am, and all were recovered by 6:42.|$|E
