5|$|The Escapists Greg Tito {{gave the}} game 3.5/5 stars, praising the {{simulation}} aspects and interface, but noting that it doesn't {{take long to}} see <b>everything</b> <b>it</b> has to offer. Tito felt the game's difficulty suffered as the town grew larger, with no proper end game goal to keep players engaged beyond earning achievements.|$|E

5|$|In the epilogue, {{one month}} after the events of the Campaign, the ODST squad has been keeping guard over the Engineer. Sergeant Major Avery Johnson arrives, informing the Engineer that he intends to ask it <b>everything</b> <b>it</b> knows about the Covenant—and what they are looking for—setting the stage for Halo 3. If the {{campaign}} is completed on the Legendary difficulty level, a scene shows the Prophet of Truth overseeing the excavation of a Forerunner artifact buried beneath the Superintendent's data core.|$|E

5|$|I don't see {{the point}} of playing in a band and going just one way when you can do <b>everything.</b> <b>It</b> would be {{impossible}} for us to play just death metal; that is our roots, but we are now a mishmash of everything, and not purists to any form of music. It's impossible for us to do that, and quite frankly I would think of it as boring to be in a band that plays just metal music. We're not afraid to experiment, or to be caught with our pants down, so to speak. That's what keeps us going.|$|E
5|$|One {{major reason}} for its {{widespread}} success is that the olive baboon is omnivorous. As such {{it is able to}} find nutrition in almost any environment, and it is able to adapt with different foraging tactics. For instance, the olive baboon in grassland goes about finding food differently from one in a forest. The baboon forages on all levels of an environment, above and beneath the ground and in the canopy of forests. Most animals only look for food at one level; an arboreal species such as a lemur does not look for food on the ground. The olive baboon searches as wide an area as it can, and it eats virtually <b>everything</b> <b>it</b> finds.|$|E
5|$|The {{harmonium}} {{was out of}} {{tune with}} <b>everything.</b> <b>It</b> wasn't even in tune with itself. She insisted on playing it on everything {{so we had to}} figure out ways to separate her voice from it as much as possible and then find instrumental voices that would be compatible with the harmonium track... As an arranger you're usually trying to take the songs and put a structure on them, but what I thought was valuable was when you took the centre out of the track and worked around the central core of the tonality and changes. That left you with a sort of floating free-form tapestry behind what she was doing, which is when things became more abstract.|$|E

5|$|While XXXVI Corps was {{struggling}} against the Soviets, III Corps' situation {{was not much}} better, despite reinforcements arriving from the transfers of XXXVI Corps to the south. Group F's new drive on Ukhta was immediately stopped in its tracks by recent reinforcements of the 88th Rifle Division. The Soviets now launched a heavy counterattack. The Finns, who were still reorganising with the recently arrived German units for a revived push to the east, were forced to retire. To counter the new threat AOK Norwegen now threw in <b>everything</b> <b>it</b> had available to bolster the Finnish front. New assignments included another regiment from XXXVI Corps as well as parts of the 14th Finnish Infantry Regiment pulled from Operation Platinum Fox, the German front in the far north. The new reinforcements helped to stabilise the front.|$|E
5|$|In the 1670s, part of Donck's land {{passed to}} Frederick Philipse, who {{was rewarded with}} , {{including}} the lower river, for declaring his loyalty to the new British rulers of New Netherlands. Philipse named the manor Philipsborough and ran it as a quasi-feudal farm, hiring tenants to work the land. Around 1682, he built Philipse Manor Hall, a mansion along the Saw Mill River that is today a National Historic Landmark. When Philipse died around 1702, the manor was divided between his son Adolph and grandson Frederick II. In 1750, his great-grandson Frederick III inherited the whole property and moved from his New York City townhouse to the manor hall, previously used as the family's summer home. Frederick sat in the Colonial Assembly, {{where he was a}} strong supporter of the British government that had given his family <b>everything</b> <b>it</b> owned, but he was primarily interested in managing the land. He improved the manor hall and worked to attract tenant farmers to the land. The family was known for its relaxed approach to its tenants, and the farm was very profitable.|$|E
5|$|The Occurian {{with the}} {{greatest}} influence on the story is , {{one of the primary}} antagonists of Final Fantasy XII, who rebels against the other Occuria and tries to give the people of Ivalice the power to not be manipulated by the Occuria; for its defiance it is labeled a heretic. Venat taught Doctor Cid the secrets of nethicite, allowing them to manufacture it themselves; it also convinced Cid and Vayne to seek out the nethicite shards originally cut from the Sun-Cryst by Raithwall. In the game, Venat is seen talking to Cid both while visible and not. Venat's ambitions were ultimately fulfilled when Ashe resisted the Occurians' plans and Reddas destroyed the Sun-Cryst, later sacrificing itself to give Vayne his power while proclaiming they will die together, as it has accomplished <b>everything</b> <b>it</b> set out to do. It was voiced by Anita Carey and Narumi Tsunoda for the English and Japanese versions of the game.|$|E

25|$|The VFL, perhaps {{somewhat}} {{driven by}} the fact that the attraction of a finals system was one of the major reasons that the eight teams left the VFA and formed the VFL in the first place, had a special meeting to hear Essendon's appeal.

In Denmark, Tore {{is said to have}} fallen ill and died under suspicious circumstances, but not before pawning the papal letter. The pawnbrokers then travelled to Norway and delivered it to Sverre who used it for <b>everything</b> <b>it</b> was worth.

Tactical air sorties, gunships, and B-52 strikes were brought in practically nonstop. A 48-hour maximum effort was begun, concentrating all available airpower against the B-3 Front in the Vietnam's Central Highlands. Then, after a 24-hour cease-fire for the Tet holiday, the same maximum effort was applied in Military Region 1 in the north.|$|E
