He assumed that if a body {{is closer to the}} Earth than to the limitation boundary, then the body would experience a greater push from above than from below, causing it to fall toward the Earth.|$|E
25|$|The Wilton-Ridgefield rivalry {{started in}} 1987 when, after a heated hockey game, a bench-clearing brawl erupted. After 10 minutes of fighting, two {{students}} {{had to go to}} the hospital and nearly everyone on both teams was suspended. The fans on both sides met after the game outside of the rink (Winter Garden Ice Arena) and proceeded to fight for up to an hour. Since then neither side has backed down and at nearly every sports event between the two there <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> fight.|$|E

25|$|Today, theism {{is losing}} {{prevalence}} in Europe {{in favour of}} atheism and agnosticism, and religion is losing prevalence in favour of secularism. European countries have experienced a decline in church attendance {{as well as a}} {{decline in the number of}} people professing a religious belief. The 2005 Eurobarometer Poll found that, on average, 52% of the citizens of EU Member States state that they believe there is a God, 27% believe there <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> spirit or life force and 18% don't believe there is any sort of spirit, God or life force. 3% declined to answer.|$|E

Charlie tries and fails to explain what bigotry is to the lizard after Leslie speaks badly of fish. Leslie thinks they are dirty and too numerous. He also looks down on humans {{because they do not}} lay eggs. Yet Leslie also has some empathy for the humans. Leslie knows that he and Sarah must look odd to Charlie and Nancy. He also understands that Charlie is being difficult when Nancy mentions that her husband thinks they are dead and that this situation <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> hallucination.|$|E
25|$|Research {{has found}} a genetic {{component}} in sleep paralysis. The characteristic fragmentation of REM sleep, hypnopompic, and hypnagogic hallucinations have a heritable component in other parasomnias, which lends credence {{to the idea that}} sleep paralysis is also genetic. Twin studies have shown that if one twin of a monozygotic pair experiences sleep paralysis that other twin is very likely to experience it as well. The identification of a genetic component means that there <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> disruption of function at the physiological level. Further studies must be conducted to determine whether there is a mistake in the signaling pathway for arousal as suggested by the first theory presented, or whether the regulation of melatonin or the neural populations themselves have been disrupted.|$|E

25|$|Probably {{the oldest}} front vise design is the leg vise. It's called a leg vise {{because one of}} the bench's legs is an {{integral}} part of it - usually forming the inside jaw. The outside jaw also goes all the way to the floor - or nearly so. There is a single screw mounted between a quarter and a third of the way down that goes through both jaws with the nut on the back of the leg. Finally, there <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> horizontal beam at the bottom to act as a fulcrum. This beam may take the form of a board that can be adjusted by means of holes and pegs, or it can even be another screw. The leg vise is probably the simplest and least expensive of the front vises, and it is very strong.|$|E

500|$|Diminished {{responsibility}} occurs {{where the}} defendant has an [...] "abnormality of mental functioning" [...] atrributable to a recognised medical condition. It must [...] "substantially impair" [...] the defendant's ability to either: under {{the nature of}} his or her conduct; form a rational judgment; or exercise self-control. It must provide an explanation for the defendant's actions. There <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> causal link required between the defendant's condition and his acts or omissions, a change on the previous law. A.P. Simester and G. R. Sullivan have argued that it is more clearly worded and more schematic provision than the earlier law, although they are worried if the wording of the section is taken to imprison those better suited to psychiatric help outside of prison.|$|E

500|$|On the ringworld, the Chief rallies human {{survivors}} and leads a boarding party to rescue Keyes from the Covenant's clutches. Keyes {{reveals that the}} Covenant call the ring [...] "Halo", and they believe it <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> weapon. The Chief is tasked with finding Halo's control room before the Covenant does. Once Cortana is inserted into the control room, she becomes alarmed and stays behind while she sends the Master Chief to find Keyes. While searching for the captain, the Master Chief encounters the Flood, a parasitic organism that infects sentient life. The release prompts Halo's caretaker, the AI 343 Guilty Spark, to enlist the Chief's help in activating Halo's defenses. The Chief's activation of the ring from the Control Room is stopped by Cortana, who reveals that Halo's defenses do not kill Flood, but rather their food {{in an effort to}} starve them—meaning that activating the ring would wipe out all sentient life in the galaxy. To stop the Flood from spreading and Spark from activating the ring, Cortana devises a plan to detonate the crashed Autumns engines and destroy Halo. Fighting through Flood, Covenant, and Guilty Spark's robotic Sentinels, the Chief manually destabilizes the Autumns reactors and he and Cortana narrowly escape the destruction of the ring via a Longsword fighter.|$|E
500|$|Writing for Slant magazine, Keith Uhlich {{gave the}} season an overall rating of three-and-a-half stars out of five, {{finding that the}} {{appointment}} of Morgan and Wong was [...] "an inspired choice that led to, arguably, the finest episodic run ever produced under [...] Carter's Ten-Thirteen Productions banner". Uhlich found that the season was torn between episodes remaining true to the Carter-led first season's [...] "serial killer of the week" [...] format and make-it-up-as-you-go-along approach to storytelling", and Morgan and Wong's attempt to introduce a continuous story arc which lent a [...] "sealed-off feel" [...] to the season, finding that the latter approach lead to a [...] "compulsively watchable" [...] but largely dated end result. DVD Talk's Bill Gibron rated the season overall four-and-a-half stars out of five, finding that the new thematic direction was [...] "right on the money". Gibron felt that the season [...] "was truly ahead of its time. It predates and predicts such fashionable fads as The Da Vinci Code, the omens of terrorist evil and the slow erosion of the citizenry's faith in the Federal Government". Todd VanDerWerff, writing for The A.V. Club, wrote that [...] "the second season of Millennium <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> work of weird genius". VanDerWerff added that the season [...] "moves like a series with a new purpose, with {{a new sense of}} meaning. Morgan and Wong start tossing ideas at the wall with a thrilling abandon, almost as if they were pretty sure they’d never work in Hollywood again".|$|E
