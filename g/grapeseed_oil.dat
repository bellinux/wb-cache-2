The experimental rats were divided into five groups. The rats of the first group were served as control. The experimental animals of the second group were exposed to diazinon (DZN). The animals of the third group were supplemented with <b>grapeseed</b> <b>oil</b> and treated with DZN. The rats of the fourth group were supplemented with <b>grapeseed</b> <b>oil.</b> The experimental rats of the fifth group were supplemented with corn oil.

Moreover, the histopathological evaluations of the liver, kidney and testis showed that DZN causes several severe alterations.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the application of <b>grapeseed</b> <b>oil,</b> a waste product from the wine industry, as a renewable feedstock to make polyesters and to compare the properties of these materials with those derived from soybean and rapeseed oils. All three oils were epoxidized to give renewable epoxy monomers containing between 3. 8 and 4. 7 epoxides per molecule. Polymerisation was achieved with cyclic anhydrides catalysed by 4 -methyl imidazole at 170 and 210 °C. Polymers produced from methyl tetrahydrophthalic anhydride (Aradur 917 ®) had greater tensile strength and Young’s Modulus (tensile strength = 12. 8 MPa, Young’s Modulus = 1005 MPa for grapeseed) than methyl nadic anhydride (MNA) derived materials (5. 6 and 468 MPa for grapeseed) due to increased volume of MNA decreasing crosslink density. Soybean and grapeseed oils produced materials with higher tensile strength (5. 6 – 29. 3 MPa) than rapeseed derived polyesters (2. 5 – 3. 9 MPa) due to a higher epoxide functionality increasing crosslinking. Tg’s of the polyesters ranged from − 36 to 62 °C and mirrored the trend in epoxide functionality with grapeseed producing higher Tg polymers (− 17 to 17 °C) than soybean (− 25 to 6 °C) and rapeseed (− 36 to − 27 °C). <b>Grapeseed</b> <b>oil</b> showed similar properties to soybean oil in terms of Tg, thermal degradation and Young’s Modulus but produced polymers of lower tensile strength.

Analytes were measured in three oils (olive pomace oil, sunflower oil and coconut oil). Five samples of each oil (one unfortified, and four fortified at concentrations between 2 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg) were analysed in replicate (four times in separate runs). Two samples (one unfortified and one fortified at 2 mg/kg) of five oils (virgin olive oil, <b>grapeseed</b> <b>oil,</b> toasted sesame oil, olive margarine and palm oil) were also analysed. The validation included an assessment of measurement bias {{from the results of}} 120 measurements of a certified reference material (coconut oil BCR CRM 458 certified for 6 PAHs). The protocol is capable of reliably detecting 26 out of 27 PAHs, at concentrations less than 2 mg/kg which is the EU maximum limit for benzo[a]pyrene, in vegetable oils, olive pomace oil, sunflower oil and coconut oil. The protocol produces quantitative results that are fit for purpose for concentrations from below 2 mg/kg to 50 mg/kg for 24 out of 27 PAHs in olive pomace oil, sunflower oil and coconut oil. The reliable detection of 2 mg/kg of PAHs in five additional oils (virgin olive oil, <b>grapeseed</b> <b>oil,</b> toasted sesame oil, olive margarine and palm oil) has been demonstrated.

Samples collected before drying had relatively high PAH amounts; Benzo(a) pyrene (BaP) content ranged from 0. 9 to 2. 4 ppb {{with an average of}} 1. 4 ppb. The high contamination level found in the raw material is probably due to the practice of compacting pomace with bulldozers to reduce its volume before storage.

The commercial immobilized lipase from Rhizomucour miehei, Lipozyme RM IM and the recombinante Ryzopus oryzae lipase (rROL) immobilized on two different supports (Lewatit® VPOC 1600 and Sepabeads) were tested as biocatalysts. After 24 h acidolysis at 60 ºC and using a molar ratio (MR) tripalmitin/FFA of 2 : 1, molar incorporations of 20. 5 %, 19. 8 % and 14. 4 % of FFA in tripalmitin were achieved with immobilized rROL in Lewatit, in Sepabeads or with Lipozyme RMIM, respectively. rROL in Lewatit was selected for subsequent studies, due to its higher mechanical resistance to magnetic stirring.

The acidolysis reactions were performed in batch, in solvent-free systems and catalyzed by the heterologous lipase from Rhizopus oryzae (rROL) immobilized in Amberlite™ IRA 96 or by Carica papaya lipase (CPL) self-immobilized in papaya latex. In the HMFS production, at 60 °C, tripalmitin was used as source of TAG, and GO as source of polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially C 18 : 2. The obtained yield in new TAG was 10. 4 % (w/w) with rROL. The CPL showed to be enable to catalyze this reaction.

40|$|Context: Various natural products, {{including}} oils, {{have been}} utilized as penetration enhancers {{due to their}} “safety profiles”. These oils contain fatty acids promoting skin permeability through lipid fluidization within the stratum corneum; and might therefore be able to effectively enhance transdermal drug delivery. Objective: We investigated possible penetration enhancing properties of selected oils, utilizing flurbiprofen as marker compound in emulgel formulations. The formulations were compared to a liquid paraffin emulgel and a hydrogel to establish any significant penetration enhancing effects. Methods: Gas chromatographic analysis of the natural oils was performed at ambient temperature to determine the fatty acid composition in each selected natural oil. Franz cell diffusion studies and tape stripping methods were employed to study delivery of the marker into, and through the skin. Results: The following rank order for the emulgel flux-values was obtained: Hydrogel >>>> olive oil >> liquid paraffin >> coconut oil > <b>grapeseed</b> <b>oil</b> >> Avocado oil ≥ Crocodile oil >> Emu oil. Discussion: Results suggested that oils containing predominantly mono-unsaturated oleic acid, on average increased the flux of the marker to a larger extent than oils containing an almost even mixture of both mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Oils comprising saturated fatty acids (SFAs) with alkyl chains between C 12 and C 14, increased the marker flux to a higher extent than oils containing C 16 -C 18 SFAs. Effects observed for branched fatty acids, however, did not vary significantly from effects for unbranched fatty acids with the same carbon chain length. Conclusion: Natural oils possess penetration enhancing effects. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Background Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a multi-factorial {{disease with}} unknown {{etiology}} and has many clinical manifestations. Objectives The current study aimed {{to evaluate the}} effects of sesame oil (SO) and <b>grapeseed</b> <b>oil</b> (GSO) on acetic acid-induced UC in rats. Materials and Methods Eighty male rats were divided into eight groups as health control (HC 1), received normal saline; HC 2, received SO; HC 3, received GSO; negative control (NC), UC and normal saline; positive control (PC), UC and mesalamine; SO, UC and SO; GSO, UC and GSO, and SO + GSO. The daily weight changes, serum levels of oxidative stress markers and lipid profile plus colon macroscopic and microscopic histological changes were measured {{at the end of}} the seventh day. Results Significant differences were detected between HC 1 and PC on the 3 rd (P = 0. 002), 4 th (0. 013) and 6 th days (0. 014) and between HC 1 and NC on the 4 th day (0. 027) in weight of rats. Use of GSO alone or in combination with SO decreased the extent of the changes both in macroscopic and microscopic indices and also at the inflammation level. The most significant decrease in the MDA level and the most obvious increase in the TAC belonged to the GSO group in comparison to the NC group. The lowest cholesterol (51. 43 ± 5. 62 mg/dL) and HDL levels (29. 29 ± 6. 24 mg/dL) were detected in response to SO consumption in comparison to NC group (P = 0. 030 and P = 0. 257, respectively). Conclusions GSO in combination with SO may be considered as the treatment of choice for UC based on antioxidant and histopathological evaluations...|$|E
