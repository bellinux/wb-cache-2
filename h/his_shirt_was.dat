The comments {{were picked up}} by UK papers The Daily Mirror and The Sun. On the same day, there was controversy over Key's comments to a radio host that <b>his</b> <b>shirt</b> <b>was</b> [...] "gay". [...] "You're munted mate, you're never gonna make it, you’ve got that gay red top on there", he told host Jamie Mackay on RadioSport's Farming Show. The following day, Lord of the Rings actor Sir Ian McKellen said in a blog entry that Key should [...] "watch his language".|$|E
500|$|The {{sequence}} in which Hawkes rips his heart out {{was created by}} using a rubber heart. The fact that the faux blood begins leaking through <b>his</b> <b>shirt</b> <b>was</b> added to [...] "hide the fact that [...] doing a little sleight of hand". The image of the beating heart in the furnace was created by overlapping a shot of a fake beating heart and a shot of actual fire. The two were then merged in post-production by animator John Wash, because the fire would have melted the actual heart model. The beating of the hearts of Naciamento's victims was created via a pump that was operated off-screen. The actual milagro prop was crafted several times because, according to Manners, the face was particularly difficult to get right. In fact, the second time the medallion appears in the episode, {{it is a different}} prop.|$|E
2500|$|Kamal Hasan {{was close}} friend of Khanna and Kamal quoted in an {{interview}} [...] "He probably hadn’t been to a public theatre since he became a star. When we reached, things were okay. He enjoyed the mediocre film (The Swarm) thoroughly and refused to leave until the end titles. That’s when I panicked. This was Rajesh Khanna, {{the star of the}} millennium. If audiences got to know he was present there would be a stampede and blood on my hands. But Mr Khanna refused to listen. He stayed on till the end. The inevitable happened after the show. All hell broke loose as audiences realised he was there. I became Rajesh Khanna’s bodyguard and security officer as I took him through the crowd. <b>His</b> <b>shirt</b> <b>was</b> torn, but he was enjoying himself thoroughly. He giggled and chuckled like a child." [...] Khanna starred in remakes of 3 films of Kamal and in return Kamal acted in 2 remakes of Khanna's films.|$|E

2500|$|Ludlam highly enjoyed portraying Leanne {{throughout}} her first stint as {{she liked the}} extremities of Leanne's homophobia and believed it provided an interesting character to play. However upon her second stint that saw Leanne accepting towards Nicole and Maia's relationship, Ludlam believed that the character had been toned down and found portraying the character to be [...] "a lot less fun". Leanne's mispronunciation of Ula Levi's (Frankie Adams) name as [...] "Ew-la" [...] became a running joke throughout the cast and crew, with a 2015 scene showing Ula correcting her after many months, receiving much praise by the audience. Karima Madut praised the relationship between Leanne and her character fellow receptionist Clementine Dean, [...] "They are a great team, I guess Leanne is more the older, wiser woman and they develop a great relationship. My character looks {{up to her and}} she learns to not become more subdued, but she starts to become more thoughtful." [...] The character proved hugely controversial upon her debut April 2010 after several homophobic comments she made were perceived to be insulting the city of Tauranga in suggesting it was not gay friendly. The controversy surrounded Leanne telling Gerald Tippett (Harry McNaughton) that <b>his</b> <b>shirt</b> <b>was</b> [...] "too gay" [...] for Tauranga. The episode also featured Nicole referring to the city as not being as gay friendly as Auckland. Bay of Plenty Tourism general manager, Tim Burgess believed the show was establishing a [...] "negative stereotype," [...] and that the, [...] "only positive thing I can say is they were pronouncing Tauranga and Mauao correctly." [...] In response to the episode he referred to the writing team as [...] "disappointing and lazy." [...] Burgess also requested an apology. Matthew Denton of the University of Auckland student magazine, Craccum, named Leanne as the shows 5th most annoying character. He attributed this to her blatant homophobia and the irony of this due to her disregard for relationships after attempting to seduce married man Murray Cooper (Matthew Chamberlain). Leanne's homophobia again drew controversy in 2017, with a stuff.co.nz columnist believing it was sending the wrong message to young watchers. Tara Strong of The Spinoff website praised Leanne and Howard's romance and compared them to Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. She believed their wedding episode was a [...] "perfect" [...] exit for the character.|$|E
