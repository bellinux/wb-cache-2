40|$|Background/Aims: In pediatrics, {{endoscopic}} examination {{has become a}} common procedure for evaluation of gastrointestinal presentations. However, there are limited data on pediatric endoscopy in Korea. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze the current status and clinical impacts of {{endoscopic examination}} in children and adolescents. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of outpatients who visited the tertiary hospital. Patients under 18 years of age who underwent endoscopy were included. Endoscopic findings were classified as specific and normal based on gross findings. Specific endoscopic findings were reflux esophagitis, peptic ulcers, and Mallory-Weiss tear. Other findings included acute gastritis classified according to the updated Sydney system. Results: In 722 of 330, 350 patients (0. 2 %), endoscopic examination (554 <b>esophagogastroduodenoscopies</b> [EGDs], 121 colonos-copies, 47 sigmoidoscopies) was performed between January 2008 and January 2013. In EGD, abdominal pain was the most frequent presentation (64. 1 %). The most common diagnosis was gastritis (53. 2 %), followed by reflux esophagitis. The frequency of peptic ulcer disease was 12. 8 %. Frequent symptoms leading to colonoscopic examination were abdominal pain, diarrhea, and hematochezia. In colonoscopy, a negative result was more likely in children younger than 7 years old. After the procedure, the diagnostic yield of EGD and colonoscopy was 88. 1 % and 45. 8 %, respectively, and the rate of change in management was 67. 1 %.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Persistent villous atrophy in {{patients}} with celiac disease (CD) on a gluten-free diet (GFD) is reported with increasing frequency. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate a possible association between persistent damage of the villi and "atypical" gastrointestinal symptoms in CD patients on a GFD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty-nine CD patients on a GFD were divided into two groups: Group A included 42 patients (6 M, 36 F, age range 17 - 62 years) undergoing <b>esophagogastroduodenoscopies</b> (EGDs) due to the presence of symptoms; Group B included 27 control patients (6 M, 21 F, age range 24 - 71 years) who were asymptomatic at the time of the study. Both groups underwent EGDs and a duodenal histologic study. RESULTS: Persistent endoscopic lesions were more frequent in Group A (30 / 42) than in Group B (12 / 27; p= 0. 01). Villous atrophy was significantly more frequent in Group A than in Group B: 85 % versus 33 % (p< 0. 0001; odds ratio (OR) = 12; 95 % CI 3. 7 - 38. 9). Gastrointestinal symptoms in the Group A patients were different from those present at CD diagnosis: anemia/diarrhea/weight loss in 6 cases; gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) -like symptoms in 12 cases; abdominal pain/constipation in 24 cases. In Group A there was no difference in gender distribution, age and duration of GFD between subjects with normal villi and those with persistent partial villous atrophy. Patients with persistent symptoms showed a higher intraepithelial eosinophil count (p= 0. 005) than the asymptomatic patients (p= 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS: Persistent intestinal villous atrophy in CD patients on a GFD is associated with gastrointestinal symptoms considered "atypical" for CD and not present at CD diagnosis...|$|R

25|$|The initial {{assessment}} includes {{measurement of the}} blood pressure and heart rate, as well as blood tests to determine hemoglobin concentration. In significant bleeding, fluid replacement is often required, as well as blood transfusion, before the source of bleeding can be determined by endoscopy of the upper digestive tract with an <b>esophagogastroduodenoscopy.</b> Depending on the source, endoscopic therapy {{can be applied to}} reduce rebleeding risk. Specific medical treatments (such as proton pump inhibitors for peptic ulcer disease) or procedures (such as TIPS for variceal hemorrhage) may be used.

40|$|BackgroundIn {{contrast}} to the diverticulosis of the colon jejunal diverticulosis is a rare condition. The incidence is 0. 06 % up to 5 % in large autopsy series. Complicated diverticulosis jejuni (CDJ) often presents with unspecific symptoms. Therefore diagnosis is often a challenging diagnosis and due to the clinical rarity no generally valid recommendation of perioperative management exists. Patients and MethodsWe considered only patients that were operated in our centre between April 2007 and August 2014. Patients were identified by data bank search via International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) diagnosis code K 57. 10. Data was manually screened and patients with Meckel’s and duodenal diverticula were excluded from this study. Eleven consecutive patients with CDJ were finally included in this study. We analysed symptoms, diagnostic procedures, surgical treatment and postoperative morbidity and mortality. ResultsThe median age of our patients was 76 years (range 34 87). CDJ presented most frequently as intestinal bleeding or as diverticulitis. Clinical symptoms were unspecific abdominal pain, hematemesis or melena, ileus, nausea and emesis as well as patients with acute abdomen. <b>Esophagogastroduodenoscopies</b> confirmed CDJ in two of three patients. An abdominal CT-scan only helped to diagnose CDJ in two of ten patients. Eight (72. 7 %) patients received an open segmental resection with primary anastomosis. In three (27. 3 %) cases a reoperation was necessary. Overall morbidity rate was 45. 5 % and perioperative mortality was 9. 1 %. Conclusions Due to the acute character of the disease patients with CDJ are seriously ill. To diagnose patients with CDJ remains challenging as diagnostic investigations are usually not helpful in confirming diagnosis. Still, diagnosis of CDJ is most frequently confirmed intraoperatively.

Batorego 15 41 - 902 Bytom Keywords: eotaxin- 3 /CCL 26, children, food allergy, serum, eosinophilic esophagitis EoE Word count: 1423 Summary Objective Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic disease characterized clincally by symptoms of esophageal dysfunction and histologically by eosinophil-predominant inflammation and typically requires serial invasive endoscopic biopsy examinations to document the characteristic histologic features of the disorder. The INH PubMED review indicates that approximately 25 studies are published in between 2006 and 2014 that propose a number of molecules as biomarkers from tissue biopsies and serum samples of EoE and non EoE patients. We aimed to identity eotaxin- 3 that correlated with activity of EoE as measurmed by esophageal eosinophilia and response to treatment by using elimination diet in children group with food allergy in the course of EoE. Subject and methods: 5 children (from 12 to 18 age) with EoE were studied for up to 12 weeks of hypo allergic diet therapy and 12 children with normal <b>esophagogastroduodenoscopies</b> with biopsies were enrolled to the control group. The serum level esotaxin- 5 were measurement in the study group two times (0, 12 weeks), total IgE and specific IgE, skin prick test, patch test were done at the enrolment times. All samples were processed using eotaxin- 3 Human Elize Kit (Ray Bio, USA). The mean level eotaxin- 3 /CCL 26 in the blood serum was 115, 22 pg/ml (median 112, 04 CI 95 % (81, 32 - 155, 5). Total IgE had impact on eotaxin- 3 excretion (p< 0, 05). The serum level of eotaxin- 3 was correlated with tissue eosinophilia (r= 0, 66 p < 0, 01) and peripheral blood level of eosinophilia (r= 0, 80 p< 0, 01). After treatment by using elimination diet of the some foods (milk, wheat, soya bean) the level of the eotaxin - 3 was lower (p< 0, 001). Conclusions: serum levels of eotaxin- 3 can be used as a non invasive biomarker for monitoring therapy of EoE by using an elimination diet in school-age children with food allergy...|$|R
25|$|While {{all these}} {{surgical}} advances were taking place, many important developments were also {{taking place in}} the science of optics. Many new optical instruments with medical applications were invented during the 19th century. In 1805, a German army surgeon named Philipp von Bozzini (1773–1809) invented a device he called the lichtleiter (or light-guiding instrument). This instrument, the ancestor of the modern endoscope, was used to examine the urethra, the human urinary bladder, rectum, oropharynx and nasopharynx. The instrument consisted of a candle within a metal chimney; a mirror on the inside reflected light from the candle through attachments into the relevant body cavity. The practice of gastric endoscopy in humans was pioneered by United States Army surgeon William Beaumont (1785–1853) in 1822 with the cooperation of his patient Alexis St. Martin (1794–1880), a victim of an accidental gunshot wound to the stomach. In 1853, Antonin Jean Desormeaux (1815–1882) of Paris modified Bozzini's lichtleiter such that a mirror would reflect light from a kerosene lamp through a long metal channel. Referring to this instrument as an endoscope (he is credited with coining this term), Desormeaux employed it to examine the urinary bladder. However, like Bozzini's lichtleiter, Desormeaux's endoscope was of limited utility due to its propensity to become very hot during use. In 1868, Adolph Kussmaul (1822–1902) of Germany performed the first <b>esophagogastroduodenoscopy</b> (a diagnostic procedure in which an endoscope is used to visualize the esophagus, stomach and duodenum) on a living human. The subject was a sword-swallower, who swallowed a metal tube with a length of 47 centimeters and a diameter of 13 millimeters. On 2 October 1877, Berlin urologist Maximilian Carl-Friedrich Nitze (1848–1906) and Viennese instrument maker Josef Leiter (1830–1892) introduced the first practical cystourethroscope with an electric light source. The instrument's biggest drawback was the tungsten filament incandescent light bulb (invented by Alexander Lodygin, 1847–1923), which became very hot and required a complicated water cooling system. In 1881, Polish physician Jan Mikulicz-Radecki (1850–1905) created the first rigid gastroscope for practical applications.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Esophagogastroduodenoscopy</b> (...) , {{also called}} by various other names, is a {{diagnostic}} endoscopic procedure that visualizes {{the upper part}} of the gastrointestinal tract down to the duodenum. It is considered a minimally invasive procedure since it does not require an incision into one of the major body cavities and does not require any significant recovery after the procedure (unless sedation or anesthesia has been used). However, a sore throat is common.|$|E
2500|$|The {{main cause}} of Barrett's {{esophagus}} {{is thought to be}} an adaptation to chronic acid exposure from reflux esophagitis. [...] The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma has increased substantially in the Western world in recent years. The condition is found in 5–15% of patients who seek medical care for heartburn (gastroesophageal reflux disease), although a large subgroup of patients with Barrett's esophagus do not have symptoms. Diagnosis requires endoscopy (more specifically, <b>esophagogastroduodenoscopy,</b> a procedure in which a fibreoptic cable is inserted through the mouth to examine the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum) and biopsy. The cells of Barrett's esophagus, after biopsy, are classified into four general categories: nondysplastic, low-grade dysplasia, high-grade dysplasia, and frank carcinoma. [...] High-grade dysplasia and early stages of adenocarcinoma can be treated by endoscopic resection and new endoscopic therapies such as radiofrequency ablation, whereas advanced stages (submucosal) are generally advised to undergo surgical treatment. [...] Nondysplastic and low-grade patients are generally advised to undergo annual observation with endoscopy, with radiofrequency ablation as a therapeutic option. [...] In high-grade dysplasia, the risk of developing cancer might be at 10% per patient-year or greater.|$|E
2500|$|In 1932, Rudolph Schindler (1888–1968) of Germany {{introduced}} the first semi-flexible gastroscope. This device had numerous lenses positioned throughout {{the tube and}} a miniature light bulb at the distal tip. The tube of this device was 75 centimeters long and 11 millimeters in diameter, and the distal portion was capable of {{a certain degree of}} flexion. Between 1945 and 1952, optical engineers (particularly Karl Storz (1911–1996) of the Karl Storz GmbH company of Germany, Harold Hopkins (1918–1995) of England and Mutsuo Sugiura of the Japanese Olympus Corporation) built upon this early work, leading {{to the development of the}} first [...] "gastrocamera". In 1964, Fernando Alves Martins (born 17 June 1927) of Portugal applied optical fiber technology to one of these early gastrocameras to produce the first gastrocamera with a flexible fiberscope. Initially used in <b>esophagogastroduodenoscopy,</b> newer devices were developed in the late 1960s for use in bronchoscopy, rhinoscopy and laryngoscopy. The concept of using a fiberoptic endoscope for tracheal intubation was introduced by Peter Murphy, an English anesthetist, in 1967. By the mid-1980s, the flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope had become an indispensable instrument within the pulmonology and anesthesia communities.|$|E
