25|$|Historians {{are fairly}} certain that Findláech was ruling before 1014 because the Orkneyinga Saga reads {{that before the}} Battle of Clontarf, Jarl Siguðr of Orkney fought a battle with the Scots, who were led by a Jarl Finnlekr (i.e. Findláech the Mormaer). An Irish princess called Eithne made a banner for Siguðr, which had on it a raven. The saga records that Siguðr later brought the banner to Clontarf, where he was killed. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> this, then Findláech would be ruler quite a bit before 1014.|$|E
500|$|Ebert {{felt that}} the [...] "rather disconcerting" [...] element of Cochrane's thought {{concerning}} nonautonomous humans was dealt with too quickly in the book, saying that [...] "controversy would be certain if infants or the seriously mentally disabled were regarded as property or put up for display in human zoos, regardless of how well they were taken care of. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> that human nonpersons have a right not to be treated in such a degrading manner, then so do nonhuman animal nonpersons." [...] Boisseau, too, found the aspect of Cochrane's thought dealing with [...] "people with mental disabilities" [...] to be [...] "objectionable".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with C.F. Andrews, Gandhi stated that <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> all religions teach the same message of love and peace between all human beings, then there is neither any rationale nor need for proselytisation or attempts to convert people from one religion to another. Gandhi opposed missionary organisations who criticised Indian religions then attempted to convert followers of Indian religions to Islam or Christianity. In Gandhi's view, those who attempt to convert a Hindu, [...] "they must harbour in their breasts the belief that Hinduism is an error" [...] and that their own religion is [...] "the only true religion". Gandhi believed that people who demand religious respect and rights must also show the same respect and grant the same rights to followers of other religions. He stated that spiritual studies must encourage [...] "a Hindu to become a better Hindu, a Mussalman to become a better Mussalman, and a Christian a better Christian." ...|$|E
2500|$|He asked, How <b>we</b> did <b>believe</b> the Resurrection? <b>We</b> answered, <b>We</b> did <b>believe</b> {{that the}} just and the unjust should arise, {{according}} to the Scriptures [...] He asked, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>believed</b> in Purgatory? <b>We</b> said, No; but a Heaven and a Hell [...] He asked, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>believed</b> [...] their holy Sacrament? We said, We never read (the Word) Sacrament in Scripture...|$|R

2500|$|After {{witnessing}} the example with the slave boy, Meno tells Socrates {{that he thinks}} that Socrates is correct in his theory of recollection, to which Socrates replies, “I think I am. I shouldn’t like to take my oath on the whole story, but one thing I am ready to fight {{for as long as}} I can, in word and act—that is, that we shall be better, braver, and more active men <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> it right to look for what we don’t know...” ...|$|E
2500|$|In March 2014, he {{was banned}} by the Home Office from {{returning}} to Britain {{after a series of}} sermons in Cardiff, Birmingham and London. A Home Office spokesperson said: [...] "We can confirm Mohammad Al-Arefe has been excluded from the United Kingdom. The Government makes no apologies for refusing people access to the UK <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> they represent a threat to our society. Coming here is a privilege that we refuse to extend to those who seek to subvert our shared values." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dyson has {{suggested}} {{a kind of}} cosmic metaphysics of mind. In his book Infinite in All Directions he writes about three levels of mind: [...] "The universe shows evidence of the operations of mind on three levels. The first level {{is the level of}} elementary physical processes in quantum mechanics. Matter in quantum mechanics is [...] constantly making choices between alternative possibilities according to probabilistic laws. [...] The second level at which we detect the operations of mind is the level of direct human experience. [...] t is reasonable to believe in the existence of a third level of mind, a mental component of the universe. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> in this mental component and call it God, then we can say that we are small pieces of God's mental apparatus" [...] (p.297).|$|E

60|$|My friends, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> could <b>believe</b> those blessed words--I {{do not say}} in {{all their}} fulness--we shall never do that, I believe, in this mortal life--but <b>if</b> <b>we</b> could only <b>believe</b> them a little, and know and believe even {{a little of the}} love that God has to us, then love to Him would spring up in our hearts, and we should feel for Him all that child ever felt for father. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> really <b>believed</b> that God who made heaven and earth was even now calling to {{each and every one of}} us, and beseeching us, by the {{sacrifice}} of His well-beloved Son, crucified for us, 'My son, give Me thy heart,' we could not help giving up our hearts to Him.|$|R
2500|$|The 2001, {{election}} {{met with}} instability for the Labour Party. The Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet stated: [...] "We are {{heading for a}} political earthquake when the votes are counted tonight, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> the opinion polls." [...] In an interview with The Associated Press Jagland stated [...] "It is unstable and unpredictable." [...] After the election in 2001, Stoltenberg and his cabinet were forced to resign, with the Labour Party suffering from its worst election campaign results since 1924. With the 98% votes taken, the Labour Party only garnered 24%, falling from 35%. Jagland, the Labor Party leader, commented on the results saying, [...] "We {{will have to make}} a decision about whether to continue in government after we know the full results". After the election Stoltenberg said, [...] "What is clear is that this was a very bad election." ...|$|E
60|$|If we {{lose that}} faith, {{we shall be}} in danger--in more than danger--of {{becoming}} unjust ourselves. As we fancy God to be, so shall we become ourselves. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> that God cares little for mankind, we shall care less and less for them ourselves. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> that God neglects them, we shall neglect them likewise.|$|E
60|$|Those {{who will}} may suppose {{that this is}} the effect of mere chance. Let us have no such fancy. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> that a Divine Providence watched over the {{composition}} of those old Scriptures; <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> that they were meant to teach, not only the Jews but all mankind; <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> that they reveal, not merely some special God in whom the Jews believed, but the true and only God, Maker of heaven and earth; <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe,</b> with St. Paul, that every book of the Old Testament is inspired by God, and profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works--if we believe this, I say, it must be worth our while to look carefully and reverently at a story which takes up so large a part of the Bible, and expect to find in it something which may help to make us perfect, and thoroughly furnish us unto all good works.|$|E
40|$|Happiness, joy, {{health and}} a {{successful}} outcome in all action or situation {{are all about}} how <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>believed</b> something, <b>we</b> could make it happen. Surprise, calmness, relaxation and correct posture are the four basic principles in positive mind {{that we can make}} useful in our lives. The power of positive mind is a mighty power that is always shaping our lives. Our mind can create everything <b>if</b> <b>we</b> know how to use and conduct it. We can reach whatever level we can with a positine mind...|$|R
50|$|Leibniz {{claimed that}} God's omnipotence {{was in no}} way impugned by the thought of evil, but was rather solidified. He {{endorsed}} the view that God chose {{the best of all possible}} worlds. In other words, Leibniz believed this world (or reality) to be the best there possibly could be — taking all facts into account, no better world could be imagined, even <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>believed</b> that <b>we</b> could think of something more perfect.|$|R
6000|$|Yes. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> really <b>believed</b> in {{the kingdom}} of God and Christ; <b>if</b> <b>we</b> really <b>believed</b> that the fate of nations is determined, not by kings, not by conquerors, not by statesmen, not by parliaments, not by the people, but by God; that we, England, the world, are going God's way, and not our own; then we should look hopefully, peacefully, contentedly, on the matters which are too apt now to fret us; for we should say more often than we do, 'It is the Lord: let him do what seemeth to him good.' ...|$|R
60|$|If two {{facts are}} related not {{contradictory}} of equal probability & with equal evidence, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> one we must believe the other.|$|E
60|$|We shall do neither, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> the text. That {{tells us}} {{of a firm}} standing-ground amid the wreck of fashions and opinions. Of a kingdom which cannot be moved, though the heavens pass away like a scroll, and the earth be burnt up with fervent heat.|$|E
60|$|<b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> that God is educating men, the when, the where, and the how, are {{not only}} unimportant, but {{considering}} Who is the teacher, unfathomable to us; and {{it is enough to}} be able to believe that the Lord of all things is influencing us through all things.|$|E

60|$|Why did Logan {{sell all}} his lands, {{investing}} in shipping property? The natural inference, at the time, {{was that he}} had been engaged in ‘some ill turn,’ some mysterious conspiracy, and people probably (certainly, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> the evidence to follow) thought that he had been an accomplice in the Gowrie affair.|$|E
60|$|But <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe,</b> as the Bible and the Catechism tell us, that we and all Christian {{people are}} God's children, members of God's family, set on earth in God's kingdom to do His work by doing our duty, each in that station {{of life to}} which God has called us, {{in the hope of}} a just reward {{hereafter}} according to our works, then our great desire will be for strength to do our duty, and the Lord's Prayer will seem to us the most perfect way of asking for that strength; and <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> that we are God's children and He our Father, we shall feel sure that we must get strength from Him, and sure that we must ask for that strength; and sure that He will give it us if we do ask.|$|E
60|$|This is {{the good}} news of Advent. And {{therefore}} it is well that in Advent, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> that Christ is ruling us, we should look somewhat into the laws of His kingdom, as far as He has revealed them to us; and among others, into the law which--as I think--He laid down in the text.|$|E

60|$|It has {{everything}} to do with us, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> that we are Christian men; that Christ is our King, and the King of all the world, just as much as he was King of the Jews; that all power is given to him in heaven and earth, and that he is actually exercising his power, and governing all heaven and earth.|$|E
60|$|We can say this: That {{if there}} be a God--as there is a God--these {{failures}} are not according to His will. The highest reason should teach us that; for it must tell us that {{in the work of}} the Divine Artist, as {{in the work of the}} human, imperfection, impotence, disorder of any kind, must be contrary to the mind and will of the Creator. The highest reason, I say, teaches us this. And Scripture teaches it like wise. For <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> our Lord to have been as He was--the express image of the Almighty Father; <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> that He came--as He did come--to reveal to men His Father's will, His Father's mind, His Father's character: then we must believe that He acted according to that will and according to that character, when He made the healing of disease, and the curing of imperfections of this very kind, an important and an integral part of His work on earth.|$|E
60|$|Now I {{think that}} we can explain almost, if not quite, all that we know about earthquakes, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> that on the whole they are caused by steam and other gases expanding, that is, {{spreading}} out, with wonderful quickness and strength. Of course there must be something to make them expand, and that is heat. But we will not talk of that yet.|$|E
