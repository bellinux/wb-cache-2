Many roots have come virtually unchanged from their common ancestor, Proto-Austronesian language. There are many cognates found in the languages' words for kinship, health, body parts and common animals. Numbers, especially, show remarkable similarities.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{study the}} problem of {{learning}} an unknown language given a teacher which can only answer equivalence queries. The teacher presenting a language L can test (in unit time) whether a conjectured language L′ is equal to L and, if L′ ≠ L, provide a counterexample (i. e., a string in the symmetric difference of L and L′). It has recently been shown that the <b>family</b> <b>of</b> regular <b>languages</b> and the <b>family</b> <b>of</b> pattern <b>languages</b> are not learnable in polynomial time under this protocol. We consider the learnability of subfamilies <b>of</b> regular <b>languages.</b> It is shown that {{the problem of}} learning a subfamily <b>of</b> regular <b>languages</b> can be reduced to the problem of learning its finite members. Using this reduction, we show that the <b>family</b> <b>of</b> κ-bounded regular <b>languages</b> is learnable in polynomial time. We investigate how a partial ordering on counterexamples affects the learnability <b>of</b> the <b>family</b> <b>of</b> regular <b>languages</b> and the <b>family</b> <b>of</b> pattern <b>languages.</b> Two partial orderings are considered: ordering by length and lexicographical ordering. We show that the first ordering on counterexamples does not reduce the complexity <b>of</b> learning the <b>family</b> <b>of</b> regular <b>languages.</b> In contrast, the <b>family</b> <b>of</b> pattern <b>languages</b> is learnable in polynomial time if the teacher always provides counterexamples of minimal length and the <b>family</b> <b>of</b> regular <b>languages</b> is learnable in polynomial time if the teacher always provides the lexicographically first counterexamples...|$|R

Some linguists, however, have recently suggested that Balto-Slavic should be split into three equidistant groups: Eastern Baltic, Western Baltic (which is extinct) and Slavic.|$|E

25|$|The {{language}} of ancient Rome was Latin, {{a member of}} the Italic <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>languages.</b> The earliest surviving inscription in Latin comes from the 7th century BC, on a brooch from Palestrina. Latin from between this point and the early 1st century BC is known as Old Latin. Most surviving Latin literature is Classical Latin, from the 1st century BC to the 2nd century AD. Latin then evolved into Late Latin, in use during the late antique period. Late Latin survived long after the end of classical antiquity, and was finally replaced by written Romance languages around the 9th century AD. Along with literary forms of Latin, there existed various vernacular dialects, generally known as Vulgar Latin, in use throughout antiquity. These are mainly preserved in sources such as graffiti and the Vindolanda tablets.|$|E
