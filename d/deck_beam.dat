50|$|The {{previous}} name of Daisai was Dadhi Patna, {{which was}} then under the Bahiri Mutha Pargana. The {{legend has it that}} due to the scarcity of water and widespread salinity in ground water during that period, every family had to have their own water pond in which rainwater from the rainy season would be stored for the year long consumption. When a newly wed son of a villager wished to start a family with his bride in a separate household than that of his father, the old man being willing to gift him a pond hired a few hired hands as diggers. After a few days of digging, the hired hands unearthed an object that seemed like the part of a huge wooden structure. They could not immediately recognize the structure as the most it was still hidden in the soil, mud and earth. Persevering day after day they finally uncovered not only the said structure but a hidden treasure: gold and silver coins, idols and precious gems along with it. In the full view the wooden structure was recognized as the <b>deck</b> <b>beam</b> of a ship which had been probably sunk a long time ago, when the area had been submerged under the sea water of the Bay of Bengal. In the native language of the villagers (which is different from both Bengali and Oriya, yet is influenced by both the languages) the <b>deck</b> <b>beam</b> had been called ‘Sai’. After this incident the village was called by its new name- Daisai- ‘Dai’ being the easier and abberated form of Sanskrit word Dadhi and “Sai” being the <b>deck</b> <b>beam</b> of the sunken ship.|$|E

She measured ninety-nine feet, six inches on the <b>deck,</b> <b>beam</b> of twenty-eight feet, and a fourteen foot deep hold. Louisiana was unmanned {{at the start of the}} campaign, and commanded by Captain Charles C. B. Thompson. From 23 December 1814 to 8 January 1815, the sloop Louisiana pounded advancing British troops, providing naval gunfire support for General Andrew Jackson’s forces. When British troops advanced up river beyond the range of the deadly cannon fire of the Louisiana, the crew did not let the absence of wind deter their support. Crewmembers waded ashore with mooring lines and towed their sloop up river against the currents of the Mississippi River to re-engage. The Louisiana was credited with playing a key role in the defeat of the British and keeping the valuable port of New Orleans in American hands.|$|E

The cable-stayed bridge is modeled as a continuous system, and the distributed vortex shedding force on the <b>deck</b> <b>beam</b> is modeled using Ehsan-Scanlan’s model. Orthogonality conditions of exact mode shapes of the linearized undamped cable-stayed bridge model are employed to convert coupled governing partial differential equations of the original cable-stayed bridge model with damping {{to a set of}} ordinary differential equations by using Galerkin method. The dynamic {{response of}} the cable-stayed bridge is calculated using Runge-Kutta-Felhberg method in MATLAB for two cases with and without geometric nonlinear terms. Convergence of the dynamic response from Galerkin method is investigated. Numerical results show that the geometric nonlinearities of stay cables have significant influence on vortex-induced vibration of the cable-stayed bridge. There are different limit cycles in the case of neglecting the geometric nonlinear terms, and there are only one limit cycle and chaotic responses in the case of considering the geometric nonlinear terms...|$|E
40|$|The {{in-plane}} vibration of {{a complex}} cable-stayed bridge that consists of a simply-supported four-cable-stayed <b>deck</b> <b>beam</b> and two rigid towers is studied. The nonlinear and linear partial differential equations that govern transverse and longitudinal vibrations of the cables and transverse vibrations of segments of the <b>deck</b> <b>beam,</b> respectively, are derived, along with their boundary and matching conditions. The undamped natural frequencies and mode shapes of the linearized model of the cable-stayed bridge are determined, and orthogonality relations of the mode shapes are established. Numerical analysis of the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the cable-stayed bridge is conducted for various symmetrical and non-symmetrical bridge cases {{with regards to the}} sizes of the components of the bridge and the initial sags of the cables. The results show that there are very close natural frequencies when the bridge model is symmetrical and/or partially symmetrical, and the mode shapes tend to be more localized when the bridge model is less symmetrical. The relationships between the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the cable-stayed bridge and those of a single fixed–fixed cable and the single simply-supported <b>deck</b> <b>beam</b> are analyzed. The results, which are validated by commercial finite element software, demonstrate some complex classical resonance behavior of the cable-stayed bridge...|$|E

The main parametric resonances characteristics are discussed {{by means of}} multiscale approximation solution methods. Using an actual cable of cable-stayed bridge project for research object, numerical simulation analysis {{under a variety of}} conditions is illustrated. The results show that when the coupling system causes 1 [*]:[*] 1 parametric resonance, nonlinear main parametric resonances in response are unrelated to initial displacement of the cable, but with the increase of <b>deck</b> <b>beam</b> end vertical initial displacement increases, accompanied with a considerable “beat” vibration. When the vertical initial displacement of <b>deck</b> <b>beam</b> end is 10 − 6 [*]m order of magnitude or even smaller, “beat” vibration phenomenon of cable and beam appears. Displacement amplitude of the cable is small and considerable amplitude vibration may not occur at this time, only making a slight stable “beat” vibration {{in the vicinity of the}} equilibrium position, which is different from 2 [*]:[*] 1 parametric resonance condition of cable-bridge coupling system.

40|$|Superstructure of a RO-RO ship {{plays an}} {{important}} role to allocate things inside the ship, for instance passengers, cars, goods and so on. Superstructure consists of transversal and longitudinal <b>deck</b> <b>beam</b> to support the structure. It is well known that the superstructure has significant contribution to the longitudinal strength. The investigation of the superstructure of a RO-RO ship particularly its influence to longitudinal strength is very limited. In addition, this influence is not clearly explained in the regulation for the structural strength under longitudinal bending. In conjunction with this, the influence of superstructure is therefore must be considered. To investigate the influence of superstructure on the longitudinal strength of RO-RO ship, the Smith???s method implemented into Beam-HULLST is applied and the formulation in Beam-HULLST is based on the thin-walled beam theory. As a simple calculation, the cross section of RO-RO ship is taken to be analyzed.

40|$|To assess {{ship and}} FPSO condition, it is {{necessary}} to adjust the inspection process and the inspection planning efficiency in accordance with the safety target. Crack propagation may be a leading criterion for designing inspection planning particularly in high sea states. In order to realistically anticipate the possible propagation of either cracks not detected during inspection or cracks initiated after this inspection, a joint research project between three French companies (Giat Industries, CETIM, and Bureau Veritas) has been carried out to obtain an improved approach. This approach involves various steps of fatigue crack behavior leading to failure. This paper presents a part of this research dedicated to the development of tools applicable to ship and FPSO structural assessment. This method takes into account analysis of simultaneous cracks propagation. This technique avoids successive re-meshing all along the crack path. Multi-crack initiations and a Line Spring Method have been used to calculate the stress intensity factors, with a view to determining the crack propagation rate. An example is provided for a <b>deck</b> <b>beam</b> on a FPSO showing a significant gain in the fatigue life span prediction compared with current fracture mechanics analysis. This gain is mainly due to a better interaction analysis between local cracked areas and overall structural behavior...|$|E

The results of these experiments, in conjunction with a review of previous work and field practices, support and help justify the recent changes to IDOT lifting loop design requirements as presented in the 2007 ABD Memorandum 07. 2. In the absence of another suitable design, a lifting loop must satisfy the IDOT requirements of a minimum 60 -degree lift angle, a minimum 6 -inch edge clearance, and an embedment depth that is at least equal to the overall depth of the member less 4 inches. The test results demonstrated the benefit of using multiple stands per lifting loop, multiple lifting loops in a corner of a beam, higher lift angles, and conduit to help ensure more uniform shape and engagement of strands. The results of this research have reinforced IDOT???s current design requirements for lifting loops and revealed the need for a national standard.
