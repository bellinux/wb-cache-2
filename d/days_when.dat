5|$|A {{tropical}} wave moving westward off the African coast on October 1, 2001 {{entered the}} tropical Atlantic. The wave's organization changed little until October 4 {{as it moved}} westward, when curved banding features began to increase. However, little improvement in the wave's organization occurred until October 6 after continuing to move westward for two <b>days,</b> <b>when</b> an {{area of low pressure}} was identified by the National Hurricane Center. Afterward, the cloudiness became more concentrated, and the system organized into a tropical depression by noon on October 6, shortly after the first advisory from the NHC was issued at 11 a.m. AST.|$|E
5|$|Beecher {{enjoyed the}} company of women, and rumors of extramarital affairs {{circulated}} as early as his Indiana <b>days,</b> <b>when</b> he was believed to have {{had an affair with}} a young member of his congregation. In 1858, the Brooklyn Eagle wrote a story accusing him of an affair with another young church member who had later become a prostitute. The wife of Beecher's patron and editor, Henry Bowen, confessed on her deathbed to her husband of an affair with Beecher; Bowen concealed the incident during his lifetime.|$|E

5|$|From {{the moment}} the egg is hatched, the male {{macaroni}} penguin cares for the newly hatched chick. For about 23 to 25 days, the male protects its offspring and helps to keep it warm, since {{only a few of}} its feathers have grown in by this time. The female brings food to the chick every one to two <b>days.</b> <b>When</b> they are not being protected by the adult male penguins, the chicks form crèches to keep warm and stay protected. Once their adult feathers have grown in at about 60 to 70days, they are ready to go out to sea on their own.|$|E
5|$|Inexperienced as a manager, Barrow had player Harry Hooper {{advise him}} on {{baseball}} game strategy. Hooper urged his manager to allow Ruth to play another position {{when he was}} not pitching, arguing to Barrow, who had invested in the club, that the crowds were larger on <b>days</b> <b>when</b> Ruth played, as they were attracted by his hitting. Barrow gave in early in May; Ruth promptly hit home runs in four consecutive games (one an exhibition), the last off of Walter Johnson. For {{the first time in his}} career (disregarding pinch-hitting appearances), Ruth was assigned a place in the batting order higher than ninth.|$|E

5|$|Sharp was re-elected to the Fourteenth Congress, {{during which}} he served as {{chairman}} of the Committee on Private Land Claims. He supported the controversial Compensation Act of 1816 sponsored by fellow Kentuckian Richard Mentor Johnson. The measure, which paid Congressmen a flat salary instead of paying them on a daily basis for the <b>days</b> <b>when</b> they were in session, was unpopular with the voters of his district. When the next congressional session opened in December 1816, Sharp reversed his position and voted to repeal the law, but the damage was already done; he lost his seat in the House in the next election.|$|E

5|$|Smallpox is not notably {{infectious}} in the prodromal {{period and}} viral shedding is usually delayed until {{the appearance of}} the rash, which is often accompanied by lesions in the mouth and pharynx.

Infectivity wanes in 7 to 10 <b>days</b> <b>when</b> scabs form over the lesions, but the infected person is contagious until the last smallpox scab falls off.|$|E
