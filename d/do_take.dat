5|$|Female California {{sea lions}} have a 12-month {{reproductive}} cycle, {{consisting of a}} 9-month actual gestation and a 3-month delayed implantation of the fertilized egg before giving birth in June or July. Interbirth intervals are particularly long for this species, being 21 days for sea lions off California and more than 30 days for sea lions in the Gulf of California. Females remain with their pups on shore for 10 days and nurse them. After this, females will go on foraging trips lasting as long as three days, returning to nurse their pups {{for up to a}} day. Pups left on shore tend to gather in nurseries to socialize and play. When returning from a trip, females call their pups with distinctive calls to which the pups will reply in kind. A mother and pup can distinguish each other's calls from those of other mothers and pups. At first, reunions largely depend on the efforts of the mothers. However, as pups get older, they get more involved in reunions. Older pups may sometimes join their mothers during their foraging trips. Adult male California sea lions play no role in raising pups, but they <b>do</b> <b>take</b> more interest in them than adult males of other otariid species; they have even been observed to help shield swimming pups from predators. Pups are weaned by a year but can continue to suckle for another year.|$|E

25|$|These modulations readily {{combine with}} each other to create yet finer distinctions. Not all verbs take all aspects, and the forms they <b>do</b> <b>take</b> will not {{necessarily}} be completely analogous to the verb illustrated here. Conversely, not all aspects are possible with this one verb.|$|E
25|$|All other possessive pronouns {{ending in}} s <b>do</b> <b>take</b> an {{apostrophe}}: one’s; everyone’s; somebody’s, nobody else’s, etc. With plural forms, the apostrophe follows the s, as with nouns: the others’ husbands (but compare They {{all looked at}} each other’s husbands, in which both each and other are singular).|$|E

25|$|In this scenario, the {{increase}} in enthalpy {{is equal to the}} quantity of heat added to the system. Since many processes <b>do</b> <b>take</b> place at constant pressure, or approximately at atmospheric pressure, the enthalpy is therefore sometimes given the misleading name of 'heat content'. It is sometimes also called the heat function.|$|E

25|$|ESA {{is often}} loosely but inaccurately {{described}} as being {{for people who are}} 'unfit for work', while the official term 'limited capability for work' is not clear in its meaning. In fact, people on ESA can and <b>do</b> <b>take</b> suitable jobs when the opportunity arises, without their impairment necessarily having improved - on paper, relatively few people receiving ESA are incapable of any work whatsoever.|$|E

25|$|Cavalcades {{are similar}} to {{standard}} treks, but are conducted on horseback. The packing restrictions are even more intense than a regular trek as participants are only allowed one standard sleeping bag stuff sacks to pack everything into, including their sleeping bags. The participants focus more on horse care than on other programs at the camp, though they still <b>do</b> <b>take</b> part in many other activities. Calvalcades last only 7 days total, with 2 days being in base camp.|$|E
25|$|Most {{assemblies}} do {{not take}} an offering during the time their Sunday sermons are preached; but some, not all, <b>do</b> <b>take</b> an offering at the Breaking of Bread meetings. Only those in fellowship are expected to give. Many assemblies see tithing (the giving of 10 percent of one's income) as a commandment for Israel from the Old Testament law and not binding on Christians, although some assemblies do encourage tithing. Instead, the amount given is normally left to the giver and is a private matter {{between the individual and}} the Lord.|$|E
25|$|Ironically, Will and Jim {{can be said}} to have aged prematurely in the novel; {{the horrors}} of the {{carnival}} force them to grow up fast to {{be able to deal with}} its tricks on a knowledgeable level. Furthermore, Will and Jim <b>do</b> <b>take</b> a brief ride on the carousel before Will pulls Jim off, and they are never shown reversing this process before Charles destroys its machinations. Thus, it can be stated that they, in fact, grow up slightly. In this case, though, Will and Jim have also matured emotionally, too, having had their first encounter with evil. This enables them to grow more proportionally in both physical and emotional status.|$|E

25|$|UE’s {{approach}} to grievances includes careful {{investigation of the}} issue by the steward, being well-prepared for meetings with the employer, and strategies for organizing and mobilizing members to pressure management to resolve the problem. UE warns its locals against excessive reliance on grievance arbitration, {{pointing out that the}} majority of arbitration decisions are in favor of management, and that an arbitrator’s unfavorable interpretation of a contract clause can harm the union for many years. UE avoids arbitrating grievances that it believes it is unlikely to win and trains its staff and local officers to carefully prepare for those cases they <b>do</b> <b>take</b> to arbitration. In most UE locals, the decision whether to arbitrate a grievance is made by membership vote.|$|E
25|$|Contractions {{where the}} final letter is present are often written in British English without full stops/periods (Mr, Mrs, Dr, St, Ave). Abbreviations where the final letter {{is not present}} {{generally}} <b>do</b> <b>take</b> full stops/periods (such as vol., etc., i.e., ed.); British English shares this convention with the French: Mlle, Mme, Dr, Ste, but M. for Monsieur. In American and Canadian English, abbreviations like St., Ave., Mr., Mrs., Ms., Dr., and Jr., always require full stops/periods. Some initials are usually upper case in the US but lower case in the UK: liter/litre and its compounds (2L or 25mL vs 2l or 25ml); and ante meridiem and post meridiem (10P.M. or 10PM vs 10p.m. or 10pm). Both AM/PM and a.m./p.m. are acceptable in American English, but U.S. style guides overwhelmingly favor a.m./p.m.|$|E
25|$|Countervailing {{analyses}} which <b>do</b> <b>take</b> {{into consideration}} the sizes of the electoral voting blocs, such as the Banzhaf power index (BPI) model based on probability theory lead to very different conclusions about voters relative power. In 1968, John F. Banzhaf III (who developed the Banzhaf power index) determined that a voter {{in the state of}} New York had, on average, 3.312 times as much voting power in presidential elections as a voter in any other U.S. state. It was found that based on 1990 census and districting, individual voters in California, the largest state, had 3.3 times more individual power to choose a President than voters of Montana, the largest of the minimum 3 elector states. Because Banzhaf's method ignores the demographic makeup of the states, it has been criticized for treating votes like independent coin-flips. More empirically based models of voting yield results that seem to favor larger states less.|$|E
