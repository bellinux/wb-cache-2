60|$|Mr. Bolder <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> distrustfully {{through his}} spectacles.|$|E
60|$|Madame Fontaine <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> compassionately, {{and touched}} her bead.|$|E
60|$|She <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{swiftly and}} surely; {{and shook her}} head again.|$|E
60|$|He smiled, {{and shot}} as evil a <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> as {{could come from}} his dark eyes.|$|R
60|$|As {{one they}} came to a sudden stop, casting affrighted <b>glances</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and <b>at</b> one another.|$|R
60|$|Ada, <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> {{said she}} thought it was a pity he should be an expense to Richard.|$|R
60|$|Tarvrille <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> I {{smiled to}} conceal {{the loss of my}} temper.|$|E
60|$|Again Helene <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> but I {{cannot be}} sure that she smiled.|$|E
60|$|Ham <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> and {{suddenly}} I felt a shock {{that struck me}} back.|$|E
60|$|My {{navigator}} threw a quick, jealous <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> {{as if he}} distrusted {{the nature}} of the question.|$|R
60|$|The Story Girl {{threw an}} annoyed <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> She {{did not like}} to have her {{dramatic}} announcements forestalled.|$|R
6000|$|... 'An' ye've got {{the angel}} now,' Dr. Macloghlen exclaimed, <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> 'Steady, there, Mr. Sheikh. What's this that's coming?' ...|$|R
60|$|He <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> for {{a moment}} as though he doubted I should understand.|$|E
60|$|There {{was a brief}} silence. Mr. Isaacs <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> whistled {{softly to}} himself, and then strolled slowly over to the window, as though to see what sort of a night it was. Miss Fay <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> impatiently, with a slight {{contraction}} in her eyebrows. I longed desperately to get away, but {{for the life of}} me could think of no excuse.|$|E
60|$|The joy {{passed from}} her face. She <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{a moment as}} if without understanding.|$|E
60|$|She {{compressed}} {{her lips}} with an angry <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> as if I {{could help her}} wrinkles, then she sighed.|$|R
60|$|The Baron {{laughed in}} spite of himself, and began to thaw. There {{was a little more}} {{friendliness}} in his next <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|From {{under her}} painted lashes she flashed a <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> I hope never {{to see again}} that look upon a woman's face.|$|R
60|$|He <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> and {{his brows}} drew {{together}} as {{he sought to}} guess my meaning.|$|E
60|$|He now furtively {{raised his}} eyes: he <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> irresolute, disturbed: he again {{surveyed}} the picture.|$|E
60|$|She laughed {{softly and}} <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> By {{this time we}} were all three under the branches.|$|E
6000|$|... "Crimble?" [...] he repeated. His eyes, greenish at that moment, shot {{an angry}} <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> from under their lids. [...] "Who is he?" ...|$|R
60|$|He shot a furtive <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> as he spoke, {{and with}} his long, lean {{forefinger}} he combed his beard in a nervous fashion.|$|R
6000|$|... "To"--the Story Girl threw {{a defiant}} <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{as if to}} say, [...] "You can't spoil the {{surprise}} of THIS, anyway,"--"to--the Awkward Man." ...|$|R
60|$|Half-way up {{the hill}} we were barely one hundred yards behind. The man <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> for instructions.|$|E
60|$|Then she <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with a smile, half-sweet, half-wistful, {{that has}} {{stuck in my}} memory for ever.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Would {{you mind}} reading a letter for me, in French,' she said, her face {{immediately}} black and bitter-looking. She <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> frowning.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, doctor," [...] says my lady aloud, {{with a side}} <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> [...] "the {{wisdom of}} Solomon might not choose out of twenty baskets." ...|$|R
60|$|She cast a <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> from {{eyes that}} {{appeared}} to be very small, unless for that instant it was mine that I saw reflected there.|$|R
6000|$|With another <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> and a <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> the door, {{he rubbed}} {{it out and}} turned an [...] "a" [...] in its place (not a capital letter this time), and said, [...] "What's that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{young girl}} <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> a moment, and then, with her charming smile, [...] "That's {{one of the}} {{consequences}} of a false position." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{turned his}} head and <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with a dry, deliberate, kind- looking eye. [...] "You're getting used to the life, are you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Would {{you mind}} reading a letter for me, in French?" [...] she said, her face {{immediately}} black and bitter-looking. She <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> frowning.|$|E
60|$|We all promised faithfully, Richard with a merry <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{touching}} his pocket {{as if to}} remind {{me that there was}} no danger of OUR transgressing.|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought so," [...] {{said her}} husband, with another <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> {{as if it}} were the {{greatest}} fun in the world, and he started amiably off.|$|R
60|$|Now Montezuma looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> for {{the first}} time, then opened a picture scroll {{that one of the}} {{counsellors}} handed to him, and read in it, <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> from time to time.|$|R
