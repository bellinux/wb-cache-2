5|$|Where is {{the mind}} located? If {{the mind is}} a {{physical}} phenomenon of some kind, {{it has to be}} located somewhere. According to some, there are two possible options: either the mind is internal to the body (internalism) or the mind <b>is</b> <b>external</b> to it (externalism). More generally, either the mind depends only on events and properties taking place inside the subject's body or it depends also on factors external to it.|$|E
5|$|At the {{breeding}} site, the male mounts the female and grips her tightly round the body. Typically, amplexus {{takes place in}} the water, the female releases her eggs and the male covers them with sperm; fertilization <b>is</b> <b>external.</b> In many species such as the Great Plains toad (Bufo cognatus), the male restrains the eggs with his back feet, holding them in place for about three minutes. Members of the West African genus Nimbaphrynoides are unique among frogs in that they are viviparous; Limnonectes larvaepartus, Eleutherodactylus jasperi and members of the Tanzanian genus Nectophrynoides are the only frogs known to be ovoviviparous. In these species, fertilization is internal and females give birth to fully developed juvenile frogs, except L. larvaepartus, which give birth to tadpoles.|$|E
5|$|The Snow Queen character, neutral but cold-hearted in the {{original}} fairytale and villain in numerous adaptations of the character, proved difficult to adapt to film due to her transparent depiction. Several film executives, including Walt Disney, attempted {{to build on the}} character, and a number of scheduled film adaptions were shelved when they could not work out the character. Buck and his co-director, Jennifer Lee, were ultimately able to solve the dilemma by depicting Elsa and Anna as sisters. As much as Anna’s struggle <b>is</b> <b>external,</b> Elsa’s is internal. This led to Elsa being gradually rewritten as a sympathetic, misunderstood character.|$|E

5|$|Individual mysids {{are either}} male or female, and {{fertilisation}} <b>is</b> <b>external.</b> The gonads {{are in the}} thorax and are tubular in shape. Males have two gonopores in the eighth thoracic segment {{and a pair of}} long penises. The female gonopores are in the sixth thoracic segment and the oostegites are attached to the first to seventh pereopods to form a brood pouch. Mating usually takes place at night and lasts only a few minutes. During the process, the male inserts his penises into the marsupium and releases sperm. This stimulates the female and the eggs are usually released into the marsupium within an hour. Here they are fertilised and retained, development of the embryos in the brood pouch being direct with the young hatching from the eggs as miniature adults. The size of a mysid brood generally correlates with body length and environmental factors such as density and food availability. The age at which mysids reach sexual maturity depends on water temperature and food availability. For the species Mysidopsis bahia, this is normally at 12 to 20 days. The young are released soon afterwards, and although their numbers are usually low, the short reproductive cycle of mysid adults means a new brood can be produced every four to seven days.|$|E
5|$|Spiny {{scallops}} are dioecious, individuals being either male or female. They become mature {{at about}} 2 {{years old and}} usually live for about 4 years. Breeding {{takes place in the}} summer. Gametes are released into the water column and fertilisation <b>is</b> <b>external.</b> Veliger larvae begin to develop from the eggs in about 2 days and drift with the plankton for 40 days, growing to a maximum valve length of 240μ (0.01 inch). The larvae have a tuft of broad, compound cilia near the mouth. The velum, the locomotory and feeding organ, has bands of cilia running down it. The simple eyes and rudimentary gills start developing on about the 25th day. The foot becomes visible on the 15th day and the propodium (the projecting front end of the foot) develops on about the 28th. By the 34rd day, the larva is crawling about using its foot and its cilia. Metamorphosis takes place on about the 40th day. Over the course of 48 hours, the internal organs undergo a 90° rotation, the valves, hinge and ligament appear and the gills lengthen. A swimming veliger larva has become a benthic juvenile scallop.|$|E

25|$|Vertical external-cavity surface-emitting lasers, or VECSELs, {{are similar}} to VCSELs.

VECSELs are distinguished by a construction in which one of the two mirrors <b>is</b> <b>external</b> to the diode structure. As a result, the cavity includes a free-space region. A typical distance from the diode to the external mirror would be 1cm.|$|E

25|$|UDDTs {{are often}} {{considered}} synonymous with ecosan (ecological sanitation) or with composting toilets. However, {{neither of these}} associations is correct. Not all UDDTs are {{used in conjunction with}} the practice of reusing excreta. There are many other ecosan technologies that hygienically return nutrients to the food chain, such as subsurface artificial wetlands that produce fodder for cows. Also, there is usually little composting taking place in the UDDT vaults (instead, it might be carried out in a secondary composting step which <b>is</b> <b>external</b> to the toilets).|$|E
25|$|Some {{believe that}} {{internal}} rectal intussusception represents the initial {{form of a}} progressive spectrum of disorders the extreme of which <b>is</b> <b>external</b> rectal prolapse. The intermediary stages would be gradually increasing sizes of intussusception. However, internal intussusception rarely progresses to external rectal prolapse. The factors that result in a patient progressing from internal intussusception to a full thickness rectal prolapse remain unknown. Defecography studies demonstrated that degrees of internal intussusception are present in 40% of asymptomatic subjects, raising {{the possibility that it}} represents a normal variant in some, and may predispose patients to develop symptoms, or exacerbate other problems.|$|E
25|$|Mediation <b>is</b> <b>external</b> {{when the}} {{mediator}} {{of the desire}} is socially {{beyond the reach of}} the subject or, for example, a fictional character, as in the case of Amadis de Gaula and Don Quixote. The hero lives a kind of folly that nonetheless remains optimistic. Mediation is internal when the mediator is at the same level as the subject. The mediator then transforms into a rival and an obstacle to the acquisition of the object, whose value increases as the rivalry grows. This is the universe of the novels of Stendhal, Flaubert, Proust and Dostoevsky, which are particularly studied in this book.|$|E

Finding corroboration of the criminal's work history is more difficult: since in the 18th century work relations underwent fundamental changes and much work was casual, seasonal or conducted outside of traditional juridical standards, written documents attesting work transactions are hard to come by. Still, where we can find some external evidence it confirms the condemned account.|$|E
25|$|Father Time, a Saturn-like image, is a {{reminder}} of the tragedy of death and loss, yet the next sunrise comes, bringing with it hope of a new day. In the first cycle of creation, evil <b>is</b> <b>external</b> (the devil). In the second cycle, we see the beginnings of family hatred, bad behavior, and evil permeating human nature. Shāh Fereydūn's two eldest sons feel greed and envy toward their innocent younger brother and, thinking their father favors him, they murder him. The murdered prince's son avenges the murder, and all are immersed in the cycle of murder and revenge, blood and more blood. In the third cycle, we encounter a series of flawed shahs. There is a Phaedra-like story of Shāh Kay Kāvus, his wife Sūdābeh, and her passion for and rejection by her stepson, Sīyāvash.|$|E
