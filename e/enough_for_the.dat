5|$|Early {{reports on}} the {{centrifugal}} method indicated {{that it was not}} as efficient as predicted. Urey suggested that a more efficient but technically more complicated countercurrent system be used instead of the previous flow-through method. By November 1941, technical obstacles seemed formidable <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> process to be abandoned. Countercurrent centrifuges were developed after the war, and today are the favored method in many countries.|$|E
5|$|God is {{not lost}} to Eliezer entirely. During the hanging of a child, which the camp is forced to watch, he hears someone ask: Where is God? Where is he? Not heavy <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> weight of his body to break his neck, the boy dies slowly. Wiesel files past him, sees his tongue still pink and his eyes clear.|$|E

5|$|Polish forces, {{numbering}} 5,500–7,300, faced Russian forces numbering {{over half}} of the 46th Corps of 26,000. The Polish forces were eventually forced to retreat, but delayed the Russians long <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> other Austro-Hungarian units in the area to retreat in an organized manner. Polish casualties were approximately 2,000 fatalities and wounded. The battle {{is considered one of the}} largest and most vicious of those involving the Polish Legions in World War I.|$|E

5|$|A {{fresh look}} at this concept started at ARPA around 1963–64 under the name Hardpoint. This led to the {{construction}} of the Hardpoint Demonstration Array Radar, and an even faster missile concept known as HIBEX. This proved interesting <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Army and Air Force to collaborate on a follow-up study, Hardsite. The first Hardsite concept, HSD-I, considered defending bases within urban areas that would have Nike-X protection anyway. An example might be a SAC command and control center or an airfield on the outskirts of a city. The second study, HSD-II, considered the protection of isolated bases like missile fields. Most follow-up work focused on the HSD-II concept.|$|E
5|$|A non-tropical trough at {{the surface}} {{extended}} from the northern Gulf of Mexico across Florida into the western Atlantic Ocean. On August 3, the western portion developed into a low pressure area. The eastern portion slowly organized and ultimately developed into Tropical Storm Cristobal. The low pressure area in the Gulf of Mexico steadily organized, and late on August 4 the circulation was organized <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> National Hurricane Center to classify it as Tropical Depression Two while located 40miles (65km) east of Port Eads, Louisiana. Northeasterly wind shear initially prevented organization of the cloud pattern, though the depression was able to strengthen to become Tropical Storm Bertha about five hours after it formed.|$|E

5|$|A planet's {{defining}} {{physical characteristic}} {{is that it}} is massive <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> force of its own gravity to dominate over the electromagnetic forces binding its physical structure, leading to a state of hydrostatic equilibrium. This effectively means that all planets are spherical or spheroidal. Up to a certain mass, an object can be irregular in shape, but beyond that point, which varies depending on the chemical makeup of the object, gravity begins to pull an object towards its own centre of mass until the object collapses into a sphere.|$|E
5|$|A third {{building}} {{was constructed in}} 1868 {{at a cost of}} £50,000, within the shell of the old theatre, for Lord Dudley. It was designed by Charles Lee and Sons and their partner, William Pain. They had taken over John Nash's practice on his retirement. The new theatre was designed to be less susceptible to fire, with brick firewalls, iron roof trusses and Dennett's patent gypsum-cement floors. The auditorium had four tiers, with a stage large <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> greatest spectaculars. For opera, the theatre seated 1,890, and for plays, with the orchestra pit removed, 2,500. As a result of a dispute over the rent between Dudley and Mapleson, and a decline in the popularity of ballet, the theatre remained dark until 1874, when it was sold to a Revivalist Christian group for £31,000.|$|E
5|$|After {{penetrating}} Ganon, {{the four}} Links firmly seal him inside the Four Sword, bringing chaos and horror to an end. Peace returns to Hyrule, {{the souls of}} the knights are freed from their torment, and the people celebrate as all traces of evil that plagued Hyrule are vanquished. With Ganon defeated and sealed inside, Link returns the Four Sword that sealed darkness away back to its resting pedestal and the four Links become one again. After the battle, The Maidens of the Shrine use their powers and create a barrier, which is strong <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Four Sword to rest before the six maidens leave. Thus, Link's journey has ended and both he and Zelda leave the Sanctuary as Darkness fades away and Light endures in the Land of Hyrule, bringing peace and prosperity.|$|E

5|$|Alexios was {{replaced}} as commander by John Tarchaneiotes, first cousin of Andronikos II, and {{disappeared from the}} scene for 30 years. His successors proved greatly inferior, and by 1323, Byzantine possessions in Asia had been greatly reduced. At that point, Patriarch Jesaias urged Andronikos to recall the aged general. A desperate Andronikos agreed and pardoned Alexios in 1324. Alexios was tasked with relieving the isolated exclave of Philadelphia, which had been long under siege {{and was ready to}} fall. He was given no army, but, according to the Byzantine chroniclers, the mere news of Alexios's approach, and the respect in which the Turks held him, was <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> siege to be lifted. Alexios was appointed governor of the city, a position he retained until 1327.|$|E
5|$|An upstart {{baseball}} league {{was created}} in 1884 by Henry Lucas called the Union Association(UA). Several member of the Blues' signed contracts with teams in the UA despite being subject to the reserve clause: including star players McCormick, Dunlap, and Jack Glasscock. These moves caused the Blues to become financially unstable. However, the franchise was able to secure {{a deal with the}} league for a better share of gate receipts. This deal was not <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> franchise to profit, and Bulkeley sold the team to Lucas for $2,500 ($ current dollar adjustment) following the conclusion of the 1884season.|$|E
5|$|Australia batted {{and passed}} England's total {{on the first}} afternoon. Tallon came in to bat {{on the second day}} with the score at 7/332, joining opener Morris, who had already passed 150.

Tallon, who scored 31, put on another 30 runs with Doug Ring, before both were out on 389, ending Australia's innings.
