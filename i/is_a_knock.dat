The Three Kings tell the mother and Amahl they are on a long journey to give gifts to a wondrous Child and they would like to rest at their house, to which the mother agrees ("Good Evening!"; [...] "Come In!"), saying that all she can offer is [...] "a cold {{fireplace}} and a bed of straw".

Emily"; [...] "Olives and Quinces"; [...] "Dance of the Shepherds").|$|E
