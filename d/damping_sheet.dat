Based on modal {{strain energy}} method, the paper {{discusses}} viscoelastic free layer <b>damping</b> <b>sheet,</b> establishes the {{finite element model}} of it and obtains the natural frequencies and loss factor. Then the paper calculates the loss factor of viscoelastic free layer damping structure with engineering empirical formula, and compares the result with that obtained by finite element method. By comparing the two results, it indicates that the finite element method is effective in analyzing this kind of problems...|$|E
40|$|Applications of Electro-Rheological (ER) or Magneto-Rheological (MR) fluids as typical smart ma-terials {{have been}} widely {{investigated}} over the past decades (since their introduction in 40 ’s). The special applications of these materials {{as a means of}} noise suppression are not yet investigated. Constrained Layer Damping (CLD) sheets can be realized by incorporating EMR (ER/MR) materials. In this way, a multilayered <b>damping</b> <b>sheet</b> is obtained with adaptive (tunable) stiffness and damp-ing characteristics. These properties are easily changed in proportion to the electric (magnetic) field applied upon the EMR layer. This notion has been introduced for semi-active vibration con-trol problems. Herein, such panels incorporating EMR material are proposed for adaptive acoustic treatments. Modeling (simulation) of a 3 -layered panel with the middle layer being EMR with ad-justable properties is carried out in this paper. The tunability of transmission/absorption charac-teristics of these composite sheets enables us making smart panels for adaptive noise and acoustic treatments. An adaptive performance can be achieved via changing the properties of such panels, on line, according to some sensor outputs. The main objective is to develop proper models to pre-dict the Transmission Loss (TL) of such panels. Also, the TL of this panel is compared with th...|$|E
40|$|Air-assisted atomizers {{in which}} a thin liquid sheet is {{deformed}} under the action of a high-speed air flow are extensively used in industrial applications, e. g., in aircraft turbojet injectors. Primary atomization in these devices {{is a consequence of}} the onset and growth of instabilities on the air/liquid interfaces. To better understand this process, a temporal linear instability analysis is applied to a thin planar liquid sheet flowing between two semi-infinite streams of a high-speed viscous gas. This study includes the full viscous effects both in the liquid and gas basic states and perturbations. The relevant dimensionless groups entering the non-dimensional Orr–Sommerfeld equations and boundary conditions are the liquid and gas stream Reynolds numbers, the gas to liquid momentum flux ratio, the gas/liquid velocity ratio, the Weber number and the equivalent gas boundary layer to liquid sheet thickness ratio. Growth rates and temporal frequencies {{as a function of the}} wavenumber, varying the different dimensionless parameters are presented, together with neutral stability curves. From the results of this parametric study it is concluded that when the physical properties of gas and liquid are fixed, the momentum flux ratio is especially relevant to determine the instability conditions. It is also observed that the gas boundary layer thickness strongly influences the wave propagation, and acts by <b>damping</b> <b>sheet</b> oscillation frequency and growth. This is especially important because viscosity in the basic gas velocity profile has always been ignored in instability analysis applied to the geometry under study. Peer reviewe...|$|E

Sidney Dillon {{is said to have}} told Ina Coolbirth this story because they have a history as former lovers. One evening while Cleo Dillon (Babe Paley) was out of the city, in Boston, Sidney Dillon attended an event by himself at which he was seated next to the wife of a prominent New York Governor. The two began to flirt and eventually went home together. While Ina suggests that Sidney Dillon loves his wife, it is his inexhaustible need for acceptance by haute New York society that motivates him to be unfaithful. Sidney Dillon and the woman sleep together, and afterwards Mr. Dillon discovers a very large blood stain on the sheets, which represents her mockery of him. Mr. Dillon then spends {{the rest of the night}} and early morning manually washing the sheet with scalding water in an attempt to conceal his unfaithfulness from his wife who is due to arrive home the same morning.

2500|$|Commensurate {{with the}} need of {{wildlife}} conservation, it is often desirable to include in a herbarium sheet {{as much of the}} plant as possible (e.g., flowers, stems, leaves, seed, and fruit), or at least representative parts of them in the case of large specimens. To preserve their form and colour, plants collected in the field are carefully arranged and spread flat between thin sheets, known as 'flimsies', (equivalent to sheets of newsprint) and dried, usually in a plant press, between blotters or absorbent paper. During the drying process the specimens are retained within their flimsies at all times to minimise damage, and only the thicker, absorbent drying sheets are replaced. For some plants it may prove helpful to allow the fresh specimen to wilt slightly before being arranged for the press. An opportunity to check, rearrange and further lay out the specimen to best reveal the required features of the plant occurs when the <b>damp</b> absorbent <b>sheets</b> are changed during the drying/pressing process.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Viscoelastic layered systems {{provide a}} simple and {{flexible}} solution for <b>damping</b> vibration of <b>sheet</b> metal panels. They also help to effectively eliminate noise from resonant structures and surfaces. This article presents an analytical formulation to predict the stiffness and damping of three layered beams with two different viscoelastic materials adjacent to each other. The complex modulus approach is used to model the elastic and shear moduli of the viscoelastic material and closed-form equations are derived for predicting system stiffness and damping. The model is derived for unsymmetrical setups using variational methods. Experiments are conducted on simply supported three-layered beams at different temperatures to validate theoretical results. Similar results are obtained from both the theoretical model and the experiments. A procedure for the optimization of structural and material parameters for maximizing the damping and minimizing the system mass for a given temperature and frequency range is also presented...|$|R

Theoretical frequency-amplitude relations are obtained using Galerkin's procedure and the method of harmonic balance.
