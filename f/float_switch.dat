50|$|A <b>float</b> <b>switch</b> is {{a device}} {{used to detect}} the level of liquid within a tank. The switch {{may be used to}} control a pump, as an indicator, an alarm, or to control other devices.|$|E
50|$|This pump {{is usually}} {{associated}} with a much larger tank, <b>float</b> <b>switch,</b> and an electric motor than the example above. Some systems are so remote that steam power is used to return the condensate where electricity is impractical to provide.|$|E

5000|$|Water level sensing switch type - Pressure {{switches}} {{are fully}} enclosed, usually inside the pump body, making them immune to obstructions or floating debris in the sump basin. <b>Float</b> <b>switches,</b> particularly the types {{attached to the}} end of a short length of flexible electrical cable, can get tangled or obstructed, especially if the pump is prone to movement in the basin due to torque effects when starting and stopping. Pressure switches are typically factory set and not adjustable, while <b>float</b> <b>switches</b> can be adjusted in place to set the high and low water levels in the sump basin. There is a solid state switch utilizing field-effect technology, which will turn on and off the pump through use of an internal switch and a piggyback plug.|$|R
5000|$|Where level must be sensed {{inside a}} {{pressurized}} vessel, often a magnet {{is used to}} couple {{the motion of the}} float to a switch located outside the pressurized volume. In some cases, a rod through a stuffing box can be used to operate a switch, but this creates high drag and has a potential for leakage. Successful <b>float</b> <b>switch</b> installations minimize the opportunity for accumulation of dirt on the float that would impede its motion. <b>Float</b> <b>switch</b> materials are selected to resists the deleterious effects of corrosive process liquids. In some systems, a properly selected and sized float can be used to sense the interface level between two liquids of different density.|$|E
50|$|The {{main product}} of the company is {{multilevel}} <b>float</b> <b>switch,</b> a cable-suspended control device which tilts as the liquid level rises or falls. Kari-Finn Oy announces that based on its own market research, Kari <b>float</b> <b>switch</b> is the only product on the market that makes possible many functions with just one switch. This product was invented by {{the founder of the}} company, an inventor and an engineer, Mauno Kari. Besides the main product, Kari-Finn Oy produces also many other electrical devices, such as electrode switches based on conductiveness of liquid, silo switches made for surface level control for loose storage items, optical level controllers for potentially explosive environments, temperature based thermal fuses, watertight pump cable connectors and alarm and control units for pumping stations. In year 2008 the company manufactured over 50.000 float switches.|$|E
5000|$|Low-water cutoff: It is a {{mechanical}} means (usually a <b>float</b> <b>switch)</b> {{that is used}} to turn off the burner or shut off fuel to the boiler to prevent it from running once the water goes below a certain point. If a boiler is [...] "dry-fired" [...] (burned without water in it) it can cause rupture or catastrophic failure.|$|E
50|$|Kari-Finn Oy was {{established}} in 1965. At first the company name was T:mi Mauno Kari, later Kari-Finn Ky. Kari-Finn Ky began to make itself the plastic parts it needed for the <b>float</b> <b>switches.</b> And as there was capacity left, it also began to produce plastic parts for other industrial companies in Lahti region. Kari-Finn Ky was divided into two companies in 1988: Kari-Finn Oy making <b>float</b> <b>switches</b> and its subsidiary company Muovisto Oy making plastic parts. In year 2008 a new parent company, KFR Hollola Oy, was founded. It started {{to take care of}} corporations lead services, management, financing actions and research and development services. At the same time Kari-Finn Oy and Muovisto Oy became the subsidiary companies of KRF Hollola Oy. Muovisto Oy carried out management buyout in 2015. The corporation employs about 15 people.|$|R
50|$|Liquid level <b>floats,</b> or <b>float</b> <b>switches,</b> use the {{principle}} of material buoyancy (differential densities) to follow fluid levels. Solid floats are often made of plastics with a density less than water or other application liquid, and so they float. Hollow floats filled with air are much less dense than water or other liquids, and are appropriate for some applications.|$|R
50|$|With magnetically {{actuated}} <b>float</b> sensors, <b>switching</b> {{occurs when}} a permanent magnet sealed inside a float rises or falls to the actuation level. With a mechanically actuated <b>float,</b> <b>switching</b> {{occurs as a result}} of the movement of a float against a miniature (micro) switch. For both magnetic and mechanical float level sensors, chemical compatibility, temperature, specific gravity (density), buoyancy, and viscosity affect the selection of the stem and the float. For example, larger floats may be used with liquids with specific gravities as low as 0.5 while still maintaining buoyancy. The choice of float material is also influenced by temperature-induced changes in specific gravity and viscosity - changes that directly affect buoyancy.|$|R
50|$|Most Learjet 25 {{aircraft}} were {{fitted with}} a fuselage tank. The fuselage tank can be filled by the wing boost pumps through the transfer line and the fuel transfer valve. When the tank is full, a <b>float</b> <b>switch</b> de-energizes the wing boost pumps and closes the valve. During fuel transfer, the fuselage tank transfer pump pumps fuel into the both wing tanks.|$|E
50|$|To ensure storm {{resistance}} {{in the event of}} water seeping into the pontoons, each pontoon is outfitted with a leak detection system with a <b>float</b> <b>switch</b> that sits about 3 inches off the floor. If the pontoon is breached, an alarm will sound inside the maintenance building. From there, a pump can be lowered into the chamber and controlled from the deck above.|$|E
5000|$|In the example, the {{physical}} {{state of the}} <b>float</b> <b>switch</b> contacts must be considered when choosing [...] "normally open" [...] or [...] "normally closed" [...] symbols in the ladder diagram. The PLC has two discrete inputs from float switches (Low Level and High Level). Both float switches (normally closed) open their contacts when the water level in the tank is above {{the physical}} location of the switch.|$|E
50|$|Simple {{sight glasses}} {{may be just}} a plastic or glass tube {{connected}} {{to the bottom of}} the tank at one end and the top of the tank at the other. The level of liquid in the sight glass will be the same as the level of liquid in the tank. Today, however, sophisticated <b>float</b> <b>switches</b> have replaced sight glasses in many such applications.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>float</b> <b>switches</b> {{contain a}} {{two-stage}} switch. As liquid {{rises to the}} trigger point of the first stage, the associated pump is activated. If the liquid continues to rise (perhaps because the pump has failed or its discharge is blocked), the second stage will be triggered. This stage may switch off {{the source of the}} liquid being pumped, trigger an alarm, or both.|$|R
5000|$|Automatic vs. manual {{operation}} - Selection of a manual sump pump means that one will turn the pump {{on and off}} when appropriate. Selecting an automatic sump pump means that a switch is wired to the sump pump {{to turn it on}} or off at appropriate water levels. Automatic switches include pressure switches, low level pressure <b>switches,</b> <b>float</b> <b>switches,</b> and a solid state water sensor called field-effect.|$|R
50|$|Kari {{multilevel}} <b>float</b> <b>switch</b> is {{a worldwide}} known and respected product. In 1977 it {{was presented at}} Brussels International Inventors Fair and awarded with a gold medal and Brussels town medal for a product being widely exported. At that time the product was exported to all European countries, United States, South Africa and Japan. Later the export has expanded to Australia, New Zealand, Russia, Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia among many others.|$|E
50|$|A special {{application}} of float-type sensors is {{the determination of}} interface level in oil-water separation systems. Two floats {{can be used with}} each float sized to match the specific gravity of the oil on one hand, and the water on the other. Another special {{application of}} a stem type <b>float</b> <b>switch</b> is the installation of temperature or pressure sensors to create a multi-parameter sensor. Magnetic float switches are popular for simplicity, dependability and low cost.|$|E
50|$|Depending on the model, {{the relay}} has {{multiple}} methods {{to detect a}} failing transformer. On a slow accumulation of gas, due perhaps to slight overload, gas produced by decomposition of insulating oil accumulates {{in the top of}} the relay and forces the oil level down. A <b>float</b> <b>switch</b> in the relay is used to initiate an alarm signal. Depending on design, a second float may also serve to detect slow oil leaks.|$|E
50|$|Through a {{connected}} {{gas sampling}} device the control {{can also be}} made from the ground. Depending on the requirements, the Buchholz relay has a flange or threaded connection. The classic Buchholz relay has {{to comply with the}} requirements of the DIN EN 50216-2 standard. Depending on the requirements, it is equipped with up to four (2 per <b>float)</b> <b>switches</b> or change-over switches, which can either send a light signal or switch off the transformer.|$|R
5000|$|A {{very common}} {{application}} is in sump pumps and condensate pumps where the switch detects the rising {{level of liquid}} in the sump or tank and energizes an electrical pump which then pumps liquid out until {{the level of the}} liquid has been substantially reduced, at which point the pump is <b>switched</b> off again. <b>Float</b> <b>switches</b> are often adjustable and can include substantial hysteresis. That is, the switch's [...] "turn on" [...] point may be much higher than the [...] "shut off" [...] point. This minimizes the on-off cycling of the associated pump.|$|R
50|$|Introduced on February 2, 2006, {{simultaneously}} with {{the extension of}} the Port Liner to Kobe Airport, the 2000 series is based on the Kawasaki Computer Control Vehicle (KCV) developed by Kawasaki Heavy Industries, the same company that manufactures the 8000 series rolling stock used for the Port Liner since service began. Therefore, it has guide wheels for <b>floating</b> <b>switches</b> installed {{on both sides of the}} cars. 2000 series and 8000 series are the only New Transit System rolling stock to handle this type. Since the last of the ageing 8000 series trains were withdrawn in 2009, additional 2000 series rolling stock may be manufactured in the future. Formation numbers are 13 through 15.|$|R
5000|$|One type of <b>float</b> <b>switch</b> uses a {{mercury switch}} inside a hinged float. Another common type is a float that raises a rod to actuates a microswitch. One pattern uses a reed switch mounted in a tube; a float, {{containing}} a magnet, surrounds {{the tube and}} is guided by it. When the float raises the magnet to the reed switch, it closes. Several reeds can be mounted in the tube for different level indications by one assembly.|$|E
50|$|It {{is thought}} the vapors ignited due to damaged wiring, as no bomb, {{incendiary}} device or detonator {{had been found}} at the scene. The airline had fitted logo lights after delivery which required passing additional wires through the vapor seals in the fuel tanks. The NTSB recommended to the FAA that an Airworthiness Directive be issued requiring inspections of the fuel boost pumps, <b>float</b> <b>switch</b> and wiring looms as signs of chafing had been found. The FAA declined to issue the Airworthiness Directive.|$|E
50|$|Float {{switches}} {{are used}} to automatically turn the sump pump on when water rises to a preset level. Float switches must be clear of any obstructions within the sump. A float guard {{can be used to}} prevent the <b>float</b> <b>switch</b> from accidentally resting on the pump housing, and remaining on. As mechanical float switches can wear out, they should be periodically tested by actuating them manually to assure that they continue to move freely and that the switch contacts are opening and closing properly.|$|E
50|$|A {{bilge pump}} is a water pump used to remove bilge water. Since fuel can {{be present in}} the bilge, {{electric}} bilge pumps are designed to not cause sparks. Electric bilge pumps are often fitted with <b>float</b> <b>switches</b> which turn on the pump when the bilge fills to a set level. Since bilge pumps can fail, use of a backup pump is often advised. The primary pump is normally located at the lowest point of the bilge, while the secondary pump would be located somewhat higher. This ensures that the secondary pump activates only when the primary pump is overwhelmed or fails, and keeps the secondary pump free of the debris in the bilge that tends to clog the primary pump.|$|R
40|$|The {{topology}} of the opamp-reset switching technique A low-voltage opamp-reset switching technique (ORST) (ORST) [5] for low-voltage {{operation that}} is fully compatiwhich avoids clock boosting/bootstrapping, switched-opamp, ble with {{current and future}} submicron CMOS technology is and threshold voltage scaling is presented. The switching illustrated in Fig. 1.

The and SO circuits is replaced by the sourcing opamp placed in ADC operates down to 1. 3 V power supply (JVTH,~I=O. ~V) the unity-gain configuration. Unlike the SO, ORST keeps with 5 dB degradation in performance. Maximum operating frequency is 32 MSPS. The ORST is fully compatible with future low-voltage submicron CMOS processes. the opamp active during the reset phase. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—high and {{low-side}} {{gate drivers}} are required in most switching power converters to provide on/off {{control of both}} ground referenced and <b>floating</b> <b>switches.</b> The drivers are required to provide sufficient current to the gates to meet timing requirements, provide a floating supply to the high-side device, and create a proper dead time between the switches to avoid simultaneous conduction. A method is proposed that uses two low-voltage integrated circuits (LVICs) to provide high and lowside gate drive in high-voltage applications. A coupling capacitor is placed between the two ICs to provide three functions: (1) high-voltage isolation, (2) high and low-side power supply, and (3) signaling to the high-side for on/off control. Integrated switches are used on each IC to provide active current steering for charge-pump power supply operation and current sensing for signaling detection. The required key blocks for IC fabrication are also discussed. A discrete test-bed is built to verify chargepump operation {{as well as the}} characteristic current flowing through the coupling capacitor for detection and sequencing through the operating modes. Key words: high and low-side gate drivers; dual low voltage ICs; capacitive coupling; charge pump I...|$|R
50|$|Condensate pumps usually run {{intermittently}} {{and have}} a tank in which condensate can accumulate. Eventually, the accumulating liquid raises a <b>float</b> <b>switch</b> energizing the pump. The pump then runs until the level of liquid in the tank is substantially lowered. Some pumps contain a two-stage switch. As liquid rises to the trigger point of the first stage, the pump is activated. If the liquid continues to rise (perhaps because the pump has failed or its discharge is blocked), the second stage will be triggered. This stage may switch off the HVAC equipment (preventing the production of further condensate), trigger an alarm, or both.|$|E
50|$|To {{reduce the}} weight, {{the level of}} fuel carried is altered: for {{intermodal}} applications the fuel level is 7,300 litres, for coal applications that permit higher axle loads the fuel level is increased to 13,500 litres, with an intermediate fuel level of 10,750 litres also available. These limits are enforced during refuelling by a <b>float</b> <b>switch</b> in the tank, the permitted level being set by a key switch with an indication displayed in the cab if the limits are breached. The provision of inline refuelling permits the topping up of the tanks in transit from a separate tank wagon behind the locomotives.|$|E
50|$|Switches can be {{designed}} to respond to any type of mechanical stimulus: for example, vibration (the trembler switch), tilt, air pressure, fluid level (a <b>float</b> <b>switch),</b> the turning of a key (key switch), linear or rotary movement (a limit switch or microswitch), or presence of a magnetic field (the reed switch). Many switches are operated automatically by changes in some environmental condition or by motion of machinery. A limit switch is used, for example, in machine tools to interlock operation with the proper position of tools. In heating or cooling systems a sail switch ensures that air flow is adequate in a duct. Pressure switches respond to fluid pressure.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2007 To realize pipelined ADCs in deep-submicron processes, {{low voltage}} {{techniques}} {{must be developed}} to work around problems created by limited supply voltages such as the <b>floating</b> <b>switch</b> dead zone, reduced SNR, and reduced OpAmp performance. This thesis analyzes standard and low voltage design issues for pipelined ADCs and proposes a fully-differential implementation of the OpAmp Reset Switching Technique (ORST) as a suitable low voltage design solution. The technique uses a true fully differential MDAC structure with a switching common-mode feedback to achieve increased linearity and noise performance over the previously published ORST. A pipelined ADC test chip is designed to implement the fully differential ORST technique as a proof of concept. The design also includes a simple, low power input sampling network that also allows an increased input signal range and saves power by removing the dedicated, front-end S/H. Prototype performance demonstrates the fully differential ORST and shows sampling speeds of up to 60 MS/s, 51. 4 dB SNR, 58. 8 dB SFDR, and 49. 7 dB SNDR for an 8 -bit ENOB in a 0. 18 μm CMOS process with a 1 V supply. Little change in distortion is observed up to 90 MHz input frequency, demonstrating operation without a S/H...|$|R
40|$|This {{reference}} contains {{guidance for}} responding to a mercury spill, and how to recycle mercury bearing products. This document also contains specific recommendations for the following types of products: batteries, fluorescent lights, high intensity discharge lamps (HID) lamps, ballasts, thermostats, <b>switches,</b> <b>float</b> <b>switches,</b> sump pumps, silent light switches, washing machines, tilt switches, freezers, flow meters, manometers, barometers, vacuum gauges, flame sensors on gas appliances, rubber flooring containing mercury, and mercury accumulation in sanitary drains. This reference also contains a general checklist of products found to routinely contain mercury. Mercury is a dangerous element in the environment today. It can cause serious health problems such as neurological and kidney damage. Mercury is found in many products that end up in landfills and incinerators allowing the mercury to re-enter the environment and pollute drinking water and contaminate the food chain. The following information is a helpful guide to identify products that contain mercury switches and thermostats. This guide describes where mercury switches and thermostats are located and how to remove and dispose of these properly. Mercury bearing articles should not be thrown in the trash, and serious care should be taken when dealing with this element.

40|$|An {{advanced}} technology cost-effective drip irrigation system design and setup on environmentally sensitive elevated steep slopes (batters) of a coal train derailment site in Central Queensland, Australia, are presented. The final {{profile of the}} coal burial site consists of six batters and associated berms with a drop in elevation of about 35 m. A small dam constructed downstream of {{the confluence of the}} two main drainage channels at the site supplied water for irrigation of the batters to aid the establishment of grass to control erosion. Water was periodically pumped from the small dam to three storage tanks using a petrol (gas) pump. Three solar pumps drew water from the storage tanks and dam to irrigate the top four batters. Contractors, pressure switches and irrigation control valves in turn shared a single solar power source between the solar pumps. Level balls (<b>floating</b> <b>switches)</b> placed in the storage tanks cut the solar power supply to the pumps when the storage tanks were nearly empty. On the whole, the irrigation system worked very well and excellent grass cover was established within 12 weeks. Given the environmental risks associated with the on-site burying of coal, and the estimated cost of about AU$ 11. 73 /m 2 (every 10 years) in maintenance if the railway batters are not treated, the estimated total cost of AU$ 4. 61 /m 2 of batter area treated with irrigation, including AU$ 3. 08 /m 2 in irrigation cost, is justified...|$|R
