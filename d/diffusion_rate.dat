5|$|Size-dependence: {{the rate}} of cluster {{diffusion}} has a strong dependence {{on the size of}} the cluster, with larger cluster size generally corresponding to slower diffusion. This is not, however, a universal trend and it has been shown in some systems that the <b>diffusion</b> <b>rate</b> takes on a periodic tendency wherein some larger clusters diffuse faster than those smaller than them.|$|E
5|$|Tunneling {{diffusion}} is {{a physical}} manifestation of the quantum tunneling effect involving particles tunneling across diffusion barriers. It can occur {{in the case of}} low diffusing particle mass and low Ediff, and has been observed in the case of hydrogen diffusion on tungsten and copper surfaces. The phenomenon is unique in that in the regime where the tunneling mechanism dominates, the <b>diffusion</b> <b>rate</b> is nearly temperature-independent.|$|E
5|$|Mass {{transfer}} diffusion {{takes place}} in the case where adparticle sources and traps such as kinks, steps, and vacancies are present. Instead of being dependent only on the jump potential barrier Ediff, diffusion in this regime is now also dependent on the formation energy of mobile adparticles. The exact nature of the diffusion environment therefore plays a role in dictating the <b>diffusion</b> <b>rate,</b> since the formation energy of an adparticle is different for each type of surface feature as is described in the Terrace Ledge Kink model.|$|E
50|$|In current {{lithium-ion}} battery technology, lithium <b>diffusion</b> <b>rates</b> are slow. Through nanotechnology, faster <b>diffusion</b> <b>rates</b> can be achieved. Nanoparticles require shorter distances for {{the transport of}} electrons, which leads to faster <b>diffusion</b> <b>rates</b> and a higher conductivity, which ultimately leads to a greater power density.|$|R
40|$|The {{diffusion}} and energization {{of electrons}} in the equatorial plane of Earth's magnetosphere by ULF waves under different ionosphere boundary conditions are examined. Using test-particle simulations and considering intervals of weak geomagnetic activity, {{we find that}} the highest energization and minimum <b>diffusion</b> <b>rates</b> correspond to nightside ionosphere conditions. Conversely, the highest <b>diffusion</b> <b>rates</b> and minimum energization are seen for a perfectly reflecting ionosphere boundary. The maximum energies gained under dayside conditions, when Hall conductivity is included, are slightly greater than the maximum energy for similar conditions without Hall conductivity. The <b>diffusion</b> <b>rates</b> for dayside ionosphere conditions with only Pedersen conductivity are greater than the <b>diffusion</b> <b>rates</b> when Hall conductivity is included. These findings show that ULF wave-particle interactions in Earth's magnetosphere depend on the ionosphere conductance...|$|R
40|$|Diffusion {{counteracts}} cooling and {{the knowledge}} of <b>diffusion</b> <b>rates</b> {{is important for the}} calculation of cooling times and equilibrium beam sizes. Echo measurements are a potentially sensitive method to determine <b>diffusion</b> <b>rates,</b> and longitudinal measurements were done in a number of machines. We report on transverse echo measurements in RHIC and the observed dependence of echo amplitudes on a number of parameters for beams of gold and copper ions, and protons. In particular they examine the echo amplitudes of gold and copper ion bunches of varying intensity, which exhibit different <b>diffusion</b> <b>rates</b> from intrabeam scattering...|$|R
5|$|Once dissolved, {{distribution}} of the dissolved gas may be by diffusion, {{where there is no}} bulk flow of the solvent, or by perfusion where the solvent (in this case blood) is circulated around the diver's body, where gas can diffuse to local regions of lower concentration. Given sufficient time at a specific partial pressure in the breathing gas, the concentration in the tissues stabilizes, or saturates, at a rate that depends on solubility, <b>diffusion</b> <b>rate</b> and perfusion, all of which vary in the different tissues of the body. This process is referred to as in-gassing, and is usually modeled as an inverse exponential process.|$|E
5|$|The {{efficiency}} of an enzyme {{can be expressed}} in terms of kcat/Km. This is also called the specificity constant and incorporates the rate constants for all steps in the reaction up to and including the first irreversible step. Because the specificity constant reflects both affinity and catalytic ability, it is useful for comparing different enzymes against each other, or the same enzyme with different substrates. The theoretical maximum for the specificity constant is called the diffusion limit and is about 108 to 109 (M−1 s−1). At this point every collision of the enzyme with its substrate will result in catalysis, and the rate of product formation is not limited by the reaction rate but by the <b>diffusion</b> <b>rate.</b> Enzymes with this property are called catalytically perfect or kinetically perfect. Example of such enzymes are triose-phosphate isomerase, carbonic anhydrase, acetylcholinesterase, catalase, fumarase, β-lactamase, and superoxide dismutase. The turnover of such enzymes can reach several million reactions per second.|$|E
5|$|The lungs in {{amphibians}} are primitive {{compared to}} those of amniotes, possessing few internal septa and large alveoli, and consequently having a comparatively slow <b>diffusion</b> <b>rate</b> for oxygen entering the blood. Ventilation is accomplished by buccal pumping. Most amphibians, however, are able to exchange gases with the water or air via their skin. To enable sufficient cutaneous respiration, the surface of their highly vascularised skin must remain moist to allow the oxygen to diffuse at a sufficiently high rate. Because oxygen concentration in the water increases at both low temperatures and high flow rates, aquatic amphibians in these situations can rely primarily on cutaneous respiration, as in the Titicaca water frog and the hellbender salamander. In air, where oxygen is more concentrated, some small species can rely solely on cutaneous gas exchange, most famously the plethodontid salamanders, which have neither lungs nor gills. Many aquatic salamanders and all tadpoles have gills in their larval stage, with some (such as the axolotl) retaining gills as aquatic adults.|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} first {{relativistic}} electron pitch-angle and momentum <b>diffusion</b> <b>rates</b> for scattering by whistler-mode {{waves in the}} low density regieme. <b>Diffusion</b> <b>rates</b> are strongly dependent on the ratio between the electron plasma and gyro-frequencies ωpe/Ωe. For conditions typical of storm times, <b>diffusion</b> <b>rates</b> at a few MeV increase by more than 3 orders of magnitude as ωpe/Ωe is reduced from 10 to 1. 5. <b>Diffusion</b> <b>rates</b> are extremely sensitive to energy and become ineffective above 3 MeV. At energies below 100 keV pitch-angle diffusion approaches strong diffusion loss to the atmosphere, while loss at higher energies is much weaker. For storm-time whistler-mode chorus amplitudes near 100 pT, and ωpe/Ωe ≤ 2. 5, acceleration timescales can be {{less than a day}} at 1 MeV. This indicates that chorus diffusion could provide an important mechanism for local acceleration during the recovery phase of storms outside the plasmapause. ...|$|R
40|$|An NMR pulse {{sequence}} {{was designed}} to accurately measure the <b>diffusion</b> <b>rates</b> of intermolecular zero-quantum coherences (ZQCs) and double-quantum coherences (DQCs) in two-component spin systems. The Gaussian phase distribution approximation was employed to describe the behavior of intermolecular ZQCs and DQCs as they underwent unrestricted isotropic diffusion. Our experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that intermolecular ZQCs and DQCs evolve with the same <b>diffusion</b> <b>rates.</b> Uncorrelated phases between individual spins on different molecules in intermolecular ZQCs and DQCs are suggested as the cause for their unconventional diffusion behavior. The differences in <b>diffusion</b> <b>rates</b> between inter- and intramolecular ZQCs or DQCs are explained. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

25|$|Temperature: If the {{relative}} humidity is kept constant, {{the higher the}} temperature, the higher the drying rate.

The Moon's stabilizing effect will continue for less than 2 billion years. If the Moon continues to recede from Earth due to tidal acceleration, resonances may occur which will cause large oscillations of the obliquity.|$|E
40|$|We present {{analytical}} derivations of the <b>diffusion</b> <b>rates,</b> ratchet currents, {{and time}} scales {{of a new}} ratchet in a fully chaotic Hamiltonian system, introduced in Phys. Rev. Lett. 89, 194102 (2002), with a proposed implementation using atoms in pulsed standing waves of light. The origin {{of this type of}} ratchet current is in asymmetric momentum <b>diffusion</b> <b>rates</b> which result when a double-well lattice is pulsed with unequal kick periods. The form of the new short-time correlations which modify the <b>diffusion</b> <b>rates</b> are derived. The resulting formulas for the classical energy <b>diffusion</b> <b>rates</b> are shown to give good agreement with numerical simulations. A closed analytical formula for the ratchet current is also obtained, which predicts correctly the current magnitudes and current reversals.

25|$|While {{increasing}} hematocrit {{means that}} the blood can carry a larger total amount of oxygen, a possible advantage during hypoxia, {{increasing the number of}} RBCs in the blood can also lead to certain disadvantages. First, A higher hematocrit results in more viscous blood (especially in cold water) increasing the amount of energy the cardiac system requires to pump the blood through the system and secondly depending on the transit time of the blood across the branchial arch and the <b>diffusion</b> <b>rate</b> of oxygen, an increased hematocrit may result in less efficient transfer of oxygen from the environment to the blood.|$|E
25|$|The {{increase}} in respiration rate {{from the low}} range to the high range is sudden and occurs in response to hyperthermia. Birds lack sweat glands, so when placed under stress due to heat, they heavily rely upon increased evaporation from the respiratory system for heat transfer. This rise in respiration rate however is not necessarily associated with a greater rate of oxygen consumption. Therefore, unlike other birds, the common ostrich is able to dissipate heat through panting without experiencing respiratory alkalosis by modifying ventilation of the respiratory medium. During hyperpnea ostriches pant at a respiratory rate of 40–60 cycles per minute, versus their resting rate of 6–12 cycles per minute. Hot, dry and moisture lacking properties of the common ostrich respiratory medium affects oxygen's <b>diffusion</b> <b>rate</b> (Henry's Law).|$|E

25|$|Insulin is {{produced}} {{and stored in}} the body as a hexamer (a unit of six insulin molecules), while the active form is the monomer. The hexamer is an inactive form with long-term stability, {{which serves as a}} way to keep the highly reactive insulin protected, yet readily available. The hexamer-monomer conversion is one of the central aspects of insulin formulations for injection. The hexamer is far more stable than the monomer, which is desirable for practical reasons; however, the monomer is a much faster-reacting drug because <b>diffusion</b> <b>rate</b> is inversely related to particle size. A fast-reacting drug means insulin injections do not have to precede mealtimes by hours, which in turn gives people with diabetes more flexibility in their daily schedules. Insulin can aggregate and form fibrillar interdigitated beta-sheets. This can cause injection amyloidosis, and prevents the storage of insulin for long periods.|$|E
25|$|The {{absorption}} of gases in liquids {{depends on the}} solubility of the specific gas in the specific liquid, the concentration of gas, customarily measured by partial pressure, and temperature. In the study of decompression theory the behaviour of gases dissolved in the tissues is investigated and modeled for variations of pressure over time. Once dissolved, distribution of the dissolved gas may be by diffusion, {{where there is no}} bulk flow of the solvent, or by perfusion where the solvent (blood) is circulated around the diver's body, where gas can diffuse to local regions of lower concentration. Given sufficient time at a specific partial pressure in the breathing gas, the concentration in the tissues will stabilise, or saturate, at a rate depending on the solubility, <b>diffusion</b> <b>rate</b> and perfusion. If the concentration of the inert gas in the breathing gas is reduced below that of any of the tissues, there will be a tendency for gas to return from the tissues to the breathing gas. This is known as outgassing, and occurs during decompression, when the reduction in ambient pressure or a change of breathing gas reduces the partial pressure of the inert gas in the lungs.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen's low {{viscosity}} and high thermal conductivity {{make it the}} most powerful working gas, primarily because the engine can run faster than with other gases. However, because of hydrogen absorption, and given the high <b>diffusion</b> <b>rate</b> associated with this low molecular weight gas, particularly at high temperatures, H2 leaks through the solid metal of the heater. Diffusion through carbon steel is too high to be practical, but may be acceptably low for metals such as aluminum, or even stainless steel. Certain ceramics also greatly reduce diffusion. Hermetic pressure vessel seals are necessary to maintain pressure inside the engine without replacement of lost gas. For high temperature differential (HTD) engines, auxiliary systems {{may need to be}} added to maintain high pressure working fluid. These systems can be a gas storage bottle or a gas generator. Hydrogen can be generated by electrolysis of water, the action of steam on red hot carbon-based fuel, by gasification of hydrocarbon fuel, or by the reaction of acid on metal. Hydrogen can also cause the embrittlement of metals. Hydrogen is a flammable gas, which is a safety concern if released from the engine.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Budget Impact Analyses {{require a}} set of {{essential}} information on health technology innovation, including expected rates of adoption. There is an absence of studies investigating trends, magnitude of budgetary effects and determinants of <b>diffusion</b> <b>rates</b> for health technology innovations worldwide during the last decades. The present study proposes a pilot assessment on main determinants influencing <b>diffusion</b> <b>rates</b> of pharmaceutical innovations within the Brazilian Unified National Health System (SUS). Data from the Brazilian Health Informatics Department (DATASUS) was gathered to establish the main determinants of <b>diffusion</b> <b>rates</b> of health technology innovations in Brazil, specifically referring to pharmaceutical innovations incorporated in the Brazilian Program for Specialized Pharmaceutical Services (CEAF) at SUS. Information was retrieved on DATASUS relating to patients who had used one of the medicines incorporated into CEAF {{at least three years}} prior {{to the beginning of the}} study (2015) for treatment of each health condition available. Thus, data from patients adopting 10 different medicines were analyzed in the study. Results from the zero-one inflated beta model showed a higher influence on <b>diffusion</b> <b>rates</b> of pharmaceutical innovations due to: number of pharmaceutical competitors for treatment of the same disease available at CEAF (negative); medicine used in combination with other medication (positive); and innovative medicine within the SUS (positive).

500|$|The gas {{centrifuge}} process, where gaseous uranium hexafluoride (...) is separated by {{the difference in}} molecular weight between 235UF6 and 238UF6 using high-speed centrifuges, is the cheapest and leading enrichment process. The gaseous diffusion process had been the leading method for enrichment and {{was used in the}} Manhattan Project. In this process, uranium hexafluoride is repeatedly diffused through a silver-zinc membrane, and the different isotopes of uranium are separated by <b>diffusion</b> <b>rate</b> (since uranium 238 is heavier it diffuses slightly slower than uranium-235). The molecular laser isotope separation method employs a laser beam of precise energy to sever the bond between uranium-235 and fluorine. This leaves uranium-238 bonded to fluorine and allows uranium-235 metal to precipitate from the solution. An alternative laser method of enrichment is known as atomic vapor laser isotope separation (AVLIS) and employs visible tunable lasers such as dye lasers. Another method used is liquid thermal diffusion.|$|E
