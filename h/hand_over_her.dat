5|$|After thirty-four {{hours of}} lying in state, {{the doors of}} the Capitol were closed to the public and Nancy Reagan was escorted in, where she had a moment alone with the casket. A {{military}} honor guard entered and carried it down the west steps of the Capitol to a 21-gun salute where Nancy, holding her <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> heart, met it. After it was placed in a hearse, the motorcade departed on the five-mile-trip (8km) to the Washington National Cathedral, where the state funeral service was to be held; crowds lined the route of the cortege as the hearse made its way.|$|E
5|$|Doggett, searching in the salvage yard, finds a Chamber Technologies drum, {{inside of}} which is a metal corpse. When Scully and Doggett confront Pugovel about it, he admits it was Dr. Clifton, a doctor who mysteriously disappeared. He had {{requested}} that he be put in the barrel in order to not ruin the company or slow the research. Doggett and Scully realize that Ray was exposed to the barrel, and thus was transformed into a metal human. At the same time, Doggett notices Nora Pearce at the lab, looking through files for the person responsible. Later, the halfway house is raided by the FBI to find Pearce. Larina finds Ray and he puts one <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> mouth to muffle, but he kills her by accident.|$|E
25|$|Isabella's {{reign as}} regent lasted only four years, before the fragile {{political}} alliance {{that had brought}} her and Mortimer to power disintegrated. 1328 saw the marriage of Isabella's son, Edward III to Philippa of Hainault, as agreed before the invasion of 1326; the lavish ceremony was held in London to popular acclaim. Isabella and Mortimer had already begun a trend that continued {{over the next few}} years, in starting to accumulate huge wealth. With her lands restored to her, Isabella was already exceptionally rich, but she began to accumulate yet more. Within the first few weeks, Isabella had granted herself almost £12,000; finding that Edward's royal treasury contained £60,000, a rapid period of celebratory spending then ensued. Isabella soon awarded herself another £20,000, allegedly to pay off foreign debts. At Prince Edward's coronation, Isabella then extended her land holdings from a value of £4,400 each year to the huge sum of £13,333, making her one of the largest landowners in the kingdom. Isabella also refused to <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> dower lands to Philippa after her marriage to Edward III, in contravention of usual custom. Isabella's lavish lifestyle matched her new incomes. Mortimer, as her lover and effective first minister, after a restrained beginning, also began to accumulate lands and titles at a tremendous rate, particularly in the Marcher territories.|$|E

500|$|On March 2, {{the defense}} argued {{in court that}} Cisneros should be set free on bond during the trial {{because she did not}} pose a flight risk as {{demonstrated}} by her actions during the first trial. The defense stated that she never failed to appear in court during the 1994 trial even though she was facing a possible death penalty. In addition, they said she was a long-time resident of Brownsville and had no previous criminal history. Though Cisneros was aware of the FBI investigation, and the possibility of a new indictment against her, she had not fled, thus justifying her bond. On March 9, Cisneros was released from jail on a US$300,000 bond. The court ruled for the defense after deciding that she would not attempt to flee before the trial. [...] Court officials imposed certain restrictions on her freedom, however. They asked her to <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> U.S. passport and to limit her travel to the Brownsville and McAllen, Texas judicial districts. Her husband was also required to sign a document that made him a third-party custodian.|$|E
500|$|Stephen also {{commented on}} the feud, opining that while [...] "Mercedes and Mitzeee are hardly Dynasty's Alexis and Krystle, they are enjoying quite a good spat". After Mercedes' {{stalking}} of Mitzeee, Stephen went on to say: [...] "No one could deny that Mercedes has had one heck of an exciting life. Siege victim, kidnap victim, depressive, stalker..." [...] Stephen urged Mercedes to realise that [...] "there are other guys in the world apart from Riley. True, you've had them all, but you could simply start going round the circuit again". She added that Mercedes does not have much to lose in her life. After her stalking of Mitzeee, Mercedes went on to stab herself, on this Carena Crawford of All About Soap said the episode itself was a [...] "huge shocker" [...] due to Mercedes' actions. Crawford added that when Mercedes realises she will be blamed for knocking Mitzeee unconscious she sees the knife and [...] "mad Mercedes {{came up with the}} perfect plan and we winced as she plunged the blade into her own stomach, knowing everyone would think Mitzeee did it! So now manipulative Mercedes has the upper <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> rival [...] After all, who’d suspect anyone of stabbing themselves – very few people are warped enough to do that".|$|E

2500|$|McGreavy {{was arrested}} by police at 3:50 am, {{walking on a street}} near the Ralphs' home. Upon his arrest, McGreavy {{reportedly}} said, [...] "What's this all about?" [...] At first, McGreavy denied any responsibility, but, several hours later said, [...] "It was me, but, it wasn’t me," [...] after which he described in graphic detail what he had done. He told police, [...] "I put my <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> (Samantha's) mouth, and it went from there. It's all in the house. On Paul, I used a wire. I was going to bury him, but I couldn't. I went outside, {{and put them on the}} fence. All I could hear is kids, kids, kids." [...] McGreavy's only explanation for the murders was that the baby would not stop crying.|$|E
2500|$|On 27 July 1947, a 13-year-old girl {{reported}} to police that a boy called John had assaulted her by putting his <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> mouth and saying: [...] "What {{would you do}} if I killed you? I have done it before." [...] This incident was not connected to Straffen until later. Six weeks later, Straffen was found to have strangled five chickens belonging to the father of a girl with whom he had quarrelled. When arrested, Straffen was also under suspicion for burglary and in interview cheerfully confessed to it and many other incidents to which he had not been connected. He was remanded in custody, and the Medical Officer of Horfield prison examined him, certifying that he was mentally retarded. On 10 October, Straffen was committed to Hortham Colony in Bristol under the Mental Deficiency Act 1913.|$|E
2500|$|... "It is {{our belief}} that the {{abductor}} of the child suffocated her to death, possibly by putting a <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> mouth." [...] The coroner's report recommended that officials continue to investigate. Inspector Healey immediately detailed detectives {{to find out exactly}} what had happened. He told the Chicago Inter Ocean: [...] "I have forty detectives at work today on the theory that the criminals lived in the neighborhood of the Paroubek home. We are investigating every incident of the lives of the Paroubeks since they came to Chicago in order to trace a possible enemy. It will surprise me if the criminals are not arrested within a week." [...] To the Chicago Tribune he stated, [...] "We have one or two theories, but nothing specific enough to even talk about. I intend to place more men on the case tomorrow." [...] Lt. Costello returned to investigating the anonymous letters. Meanwhile, the New York Times reported Hoffman's and Paroubek's theory as fact.|$|E

2500|$|In October 2012, a storyline {{involving}} Lola Pearce, {{forced to}} <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> baby Lexi Pearce, was criticised by the charity The Who Cares? Trust, {{who called the}} storyline an [...] "unhelpful portrayal" [...] and said it had already received calls {{from members of the}} public who were [...] "distressed about the EastEnders scene where a social worker snatches a baby from its mother's arms". The scenes were also condemned by the British Association of Social Workers (BASW), calling the BBC [...] "too lazy and arrogant" [...] to correctly portray the child protection process, and saying that the baby was taken [...] "without sufficient grounds to do so". Bridget Robb, acting chief of the BASW, said the storyline provoked [...] "real anger among a profession well used to a less than accurate public and media perception of their jobs [...]. EastEnders shabby portrayal of an entire profession has made a tough job even tougher." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{first four}} slabs of the frieze, from the {{northwest}} corner {{to the middle of}} the west side, depict the attack on the Greeks at Troy by Amazons under Penthesilea BM 538, BM 532, BM 537, and BM 539 The battle itself spans three blocks, culminating in the death of Penthesilea at the hands of Achilles on BM 537, while the fourth slab, BM 539, depicts a truce at the end of the battle. ln the first pair of combatants, on slab BM 538, an Amazon has gained the upper <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> opponent, but with the second pair the situation is dramatically reversed. Here a bearded Greek, wearing a chiton, a cuirass, a helmet, and a baldric and carrying a shield, seizes an Amazon by the hair while trampling her underfoot. He is the most heavily armed soldier in either of the Amazonomachies depicted, and the only bearded Greek, so far as we can tell, anywhere on the frieze. On the second slab, BM 532, one Amazon uses a hoplite shield to guard a second kneeling Amazon who has just shot an arrow The battle reaches its climax on the third slab, BM 537, where [...] Achilles slays the Amazonian queen. Achilles and Penthesilea appear in the center of the slab, while a single Greek and a single Amazon flank them. The final slab in the series, BM 539, represents the moment when a truce has been called between the Greeks and Amazons in order to clear the battlefield of equipment, the wounded and the dead ...|$|E
