40|$|Morphometric {{techniques}} {{were used in}} the evaluation of lymphocyte morphology and activity in tropical sprue. jejunal biopsies from control subjects (8), patients with epidemic disease (7), patients with endemic disease (11), and subjects who had recovered from sprue (4) were analyzed blindly. In patients with sprue, lymphocytes were increased significantly within crypt (but not surface) epithelium. Immunoblasts (greater than 6 mu in diameter) were increased by 5 % over control subjects. Group means for lymphocytic mitotic indexes were also significantly raised, while flux ratios only differed significantly between <b>endemic</b> <b>sprue</b> patients and control subjects. The lymphocytic infiltration was distributed focally in the upper crypt and crypt-villus interzones. Analysis of epidemic cases (presenting within 4 - 28 days) revealed detectable changes in lymphocyte behavior only after 3 weeks' illness, whereas mucosal lesions and malabsorption were already established during the first week. These data indicate that lymphocyte activation, suggestive of a local cell-mediated immune reaction, does occur in tropical sprue but is secondary to damage already inflicted on enterocytes and their function...|$|E
40|$|THE FIRST DESCRIPTION of {{tropical}} sprue was presented over 2 centuries ago by Hillary {{from the island}} of Barbados in the West Indies (1, 2). Since that time, the presence of <b>endemic</b> tropical <b>sprue</b> in the West Indies has been thoroughly docu-mented on the islands of Cuba (3) and Puerto Rico (4, 5); however, the disease is alleged never to have been seen in Jamaica (4) {{and has not been}} reported from Haiti or other islands in the Caribbean. A recent nutritional survey by Sebrell and his associates (6) has indicated that a high prevalence of anemia and multiple nutritional deficiencies exists in the rural population of Haiti. In a preliminary stud...|$|R
