40|$|Abstract: There is a {{systematic}} and suggestive analogy between <b>grounding</b> <b>and</b> causation. In my view, {{this is no}} coincidence: <b>grounding</b> <b>and</b> causation resemble one another because grounding {{is a type of}} causation. I defend the identification of grounding with metaphysical causation from some initial objections, and I draw on the causation literature to explore connections between <b>grounding</b> <b>and</b> counterfactuals. I outline a sophisticated non-reductive counterfactual account of grounding along interventionist lines, and use it to diagnose the prevalence of scepticism about grounding as deriving, at least i...|$|R

40|$|Recent metaphysics {{has turned}} its focus to two notions that are—as well {{as having a}} common Aristotelian pedigree—widely thought to be intimately related: <b>grounding</b> <b>and</b> essence.

We develop a unified and uniform account of <b>grounding</b> <b>and</b> essence, one which understands them {{both in terms of}} a {{generalized}} notion of identity examined in recent work by Fabrice Correia, Cian Dorr, Agustín Rayo, and others. We argue that the account comports with antecedently plausible principles governing <b>grounding,</b> essence, <b>and</b> identity taken individually, and illuminates how the three interact. We also argue that the account compares favorably to an alternative unification of <b>grounding</b> <b>and</b> essence recently proposed by Kit Fine...|$|R
