5000|$|Because the {{government}} gave out incentives to help businesses, {{it had a}} lot of control over them. However, {{there was no way to}} ensure the businesses would use the incentives in an effective and efficient manner. In other words, there was no external monitoring system to monitor the Chaebol and ensure that they were efficient in the allocation of resources. All businesses undertake internal market transactions, which constitute [...] "purchase and sale of intermediate inputs, the provision and receipt of loan collaterals, and the provision and receipt of payment guarantees among member firms in a business group". There is the question of efficiency, especially in production and management. Therefore, the system of chaebol was not very transparent. Behind the scenes, businesses were provided with subsidiary financing and <b>intragroup</b> <b>transactions.</b> This allowed them easy loans to cover for their deficits, and prior to the 1997 crisis, huge debts had accumlated, many of which were hidden. That gave the illusion to the world that the system was flourishing into the 1990s.|$|E

Using hand-collected data on entrepreneurs 2 ̆ 7 political connections and firm ownership, we construct several original measures of social capital and examine their effect {{on the performance of}} entrepreneurial firms in China after their initial public offerings. Political connections or a high percentage of external investors tend to enhance firm performance, but <b>intragroup</b> related-party <b>transactions</b> commonly lead to performance decline. These forms of social capital have a strong influence on the performance of Chinese firms, whereas formal governance variables such as board size or board independence have little effect. Although social capital may serve as an informal governance mechanism and effectively substitute for formal governance mechanisms in an emerging market, this role of social capital raises several ethical concerns, notably the development of rent-seeking and crony capitalism...|$|R
40|$|This study empirically investigates {{whether the}} {{introduction}} of a new corporate governance system in the Korean economy (where controlling shareholders dominate business groups and corporate-bank relationships are prominent) affects corporate leverage strategies. We find evidence suggesting that improved corporate governance, measured by appointments of outside directors and controlling shareholder’s ownership, constrains corporate borrowing. Chaebol firms, on average, have higher levels of borrowing than stand-alone firms. However, the largest chaebols, who are heavily involved in multinational ventures, showed the opposite trend, ostensibly due to more diversified business opportunities and sources of financing available in international markets. This suggests that government policies designed to improved corporate governance among “average” chaebols may be ineffective (or only partially effective), because such policies do not account the heterogeneity that exists across chaebols. Lastly, we find that <b>intragroup</b> <b>transactions</b> among affiliates increase corporate borrowing, but they are not consistently related to chaebol borrowing as a whole.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} how legal-origin families affect {{minority shareholders}} ’ returns in intragroup {{mergers and acquisitions}} (M&As). I collected data for 1, 302 intragroup M&As from 60 countries to determine (1) whether and where expropriation takes place, and (2) if legal origin explains the treatment reserved to minority shareholders by the bidder. I find that intragroup acquisitions {{are not used to}} expropriate minority shareholders. This result is common to all of the regions examined, with the only exceptions being Eastern Europe and legal-origin families. To the contrary—intragroup M&As actually create value. However, target shareholders do not benefit from <b>intragroup</b> <b>transactions</b> in the same way. In fact, target shareholders in common law countries earn returns abnormally higher than those realized by target shareholders in civil law countries. Thus, while all legal families seem to provide at least a minimum level of investor protection in case of intragroup M&A, common law gives more power to minority investors when dealing with controlling shareholders.

40|$|Financial {{conglomerates}} are {{groups of}} financial institutions related by ownership or control. Specific regulatory and supervisory issues arise when financial services [...] such as commercial and retail banking, securities underwriting and trading, investment management, and insurance underwriting [...] are provided by a financial conglomerate structure. The author provides a handbook for authorities responsible for financial conglomerate regulation and supervision, identifying key issues, spelling out regulatory and supervisory alternatives, and describing both preferred solutions and alternatives. He makes reference to the regulatory framework adopted in the European Economic Community. Among the main tools available to the authorities are prudential regulations, accounting consolidation, and consolidated supervision. Prudential regulation for financial conglomerates preferably would be applied on a uniform and fully consolidated basis. Alternatively, existing regulations applicable to different financial sectors can be modified, in particular to mitigate the potential that <b>intragroup</b> <b>transactions</b> overstate capital or earnings. Accounting consolidation of the financial entities in a group {{is a prerequisite for}} consolidated prudential regulation and improves the transparency of the group's financial position. The authorities should use consolidated supervision to ensure that the risks from all group entities are identified and assessed.

40|$|Typical {{business}} groups are widely diversified into unrelated industries. Scholars have explained {{this as a}} consequence of institutional weaknesses and predicted that {{business groups}} would lose their effectiveness and increasingly refocus as institutional environments improve. In this dissertation, I suggest a new perspective on business groups by revisiting their hybrid nature and focusing on the fact that two different boundaries exist for business group member firms. I differentiate between group-level diversification and firm-level diversification and argue that they serve different purposes, which lead to divergent patterns of diversification. First, at the business group level, I question the appropriateness of applying the concept of relatedness to the diversification of a business group. Emphasizing the hybrid nature of the business group, I argue that its purpose of diversification may be more to provide the group?s member firms with critical resources than to obtain synergies from operating in related industries. Relying on the insights from the input-output model, I propose the idea that business groups are more likely to enter industries that have linkages to multiple other industries than to follow the relatedness criterion. I test the idea using the data of 30 major South Korean business groups? diversification from 1999 to 2008 and find an empirical support. Second, at the member firm level, I focus on the importance of group-level characteristics on member firms? diversification choices. Emphasizing economic incentives, I propose that the business group structure and relationships within it affect its member firms? strategic orientation and choices in ways that may satisfy the needs of both the controlling shareholders and minority shareholders. I theorize that the size, the degree of diversification, and the proportion of <b>intragroup</b> <b>transaction</b> of a business group would affect diversification choices of its member firms. Based on the data of 108 public member firms of 30 major South Korean business groups, I find empirical support for most of my hypotheses. The implication of my dissertation is that the business group may be not just a coping mechanism for underdeveloped institutions, but an organizational innovation that can work in any institutional environment...|$|R

Non-Technical Summary Already today, the trade between affiliated companies is assessed to average out at more than 60 percent of the world trade. As this figure is supposed to further increase, the organisational form of affiliated groups becomes even more important. The increased use of information and communication technologies (ICT) leads to different changes within the organisational structures of groups of companies. First of all, {{an increase in the number}} of <b>intragroup</b> cross-border <b>transactions</b> can be observed. Besides, the products transferred or services rendered as well as the organisational structures of affiliated groups become more and more specific and, thus, less comparable.

40|$|The use of {{information}} and communication technologies (ICT) within multinational groups leads to a rising number of <b>intragroup</b> cross-border <b>transactions.</b> At the same time, transactions and the organisational structures of affiliated groups become more and more specific and, thus, less comparable. The importance of human capital and of mobile factors of production, such as intangible assets, increases. The objective {{of this paper is to}} give an insight into the principal issues of profit allocation within multinational groups resulting from these economic changes. It is examined whether the traditional transaction methods based on the arm?s length principle can be upheld and to what extent the alternative method of formula apportionment is more suitable. The tax principles of inter-nation equity and feasibility are used to evaluate the different methods of profit allocation. We conclude that, in the light of the two demanded principles, formula apportionment is more appropriate than the arm?s length principle as regards the changed economic structures by use of ICT. As formula apportionment constitutes a suitable alternative especially in the European Union, the proposals made by the European Commission are considered to be a good starting point.

40|$|Understanding the {{important}} concepts necessary {{to undertake the}} preparation of consolidated financial statements has proven challenging for many accounting undergraduate students. As a result, the development of multimedia modelling concepts such as acquisition analysis, business combination valuation entries, reacquisition entries and <b>intragroup</b> <b>transactions</b> were embedded within an e-learning environment. The principle of modelling, derived from social cognitive theory, {{was applied to the}} design of the multimedia. A study was conducted to gauge the effectiveness of the approach and consider student perceptions with regard to learning through this approach. Quantitative data were collected from accounting undergraduate students (n= 464) enrolled across three different cohorts including international campuses (n= 386), an Australian campus (n= 49) and a distance education cohort (n= 29). Analyses were undertaken to show significant differences between these cohorts. This research paper presents findings that indicate a positive and significant association between the number of times the videos were accessed, and the assignment score (p< 0. 05) was evident, suggesting that students that referred to the videos relatively frequently were able to utilise the knowledge gained from the videos to assist them in completing the assignment...|$|E
40|$|A {{traditional}} {{subject matter}} falling under the general heading of our Article {{is related to}} the Greek and European legislators 2 ̆ 7 reaction towards the negative consequences and unfair practices in which <b>intragroup</b> <b>transactions</b> may result. Such transactions may result in detriment to shareholders, employees, and creditors, {{as well as of the}} state 2 ̆ 7 s interests regarding taxation policies. Currently, these considerations are not fully addressed by the traditional legal regime in Greece; as a result, discussion is still in progress. At an EU level, the recent legislative initiatives-in particular Directive 2002 / 87 /EC on the supplementary supervision of credit institutions, insurance undertakings, and investment firms in a financial conglomerate-seek to introduce specific prudential legislation for financial conglomerates. These directives also take the first steps to align the legislation on the European level with national laws concerning financial groups and financial conglomerates in the same sector, thus ensuring a minimum level of equal treatment of these groups throughout the European Union. The main objective, however, of the new EU regime is to ensure that separate state regulators-who typically focus on one sector in order to ensure capital adequacy of the entities under their supervision-are not hindered because of the existence of cross-sector financial conglomerates. This requires specific measures which will prevent situations, for example, where capital is used at the same time as a buffer against risk in two or more entities belonging in the same financial conglomerate (2 ̆ 2 multiple gearing 2 ̆ 2) and situations where a parent company issues debt and directs the proceeds as equity to its regulated subsidiaries (2 ̆ 2 excessive leverage 2 ̆ 2).
