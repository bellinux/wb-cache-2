500|$|Three Rivers Stadium was {{imploded}} on February 11, 2001, at 8:03a.m. on {{a chilly}} [...] day. Over 20,000 people viewed the implosion from Point State Park. Another 3,000-4,000 viewing from atop Mount Washington and an uncounted {{number of people}} viewed the demolition from various high points across the city. Mark Loizeaux of Controlled Demolition, Inc. pushed the button that set off the 19-second implosion, while Elizabeth and Joseph King pushed the [...] "ceremonial old fashioned dynamite plunger". The demolition cost $5.1million and used 4,800pounds of explosive. With the newly constructed Heinz Field only 80feet away, effects from the blast were a concern. Doug Loizeaux, vice president of Controlled Demolition, Inc., was <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> {{that there was no}} debris within 40feet of Heinz Field.|$|E
500|$|Queen Mary I's plan {{to marry}} Philip II of Spain {{was greeted with}} {{widespread}} opposition, not just among the populace but also among Members of Parliament and privy councillors. Thomas Wyatt's Rebellion in early 1554, in which the Duke of Suffolk took part, {{was a result of}} this dislike. It was not the intention of the conspirators to bring Jane Grey to the throne again. Nevertheless, [...] the government, {{at the height of the}} military crisis around 7February, decided to execute Jane and her husband, possibly out of panic. It was also an opportunity for removing possible inspirations for future unrest and unwelcome reminders of the past. It troubled Mary to let her cousin die, but she accepted the Privy Council's advice. Bishop Gardiner pressed for the young couple's execution in a court sermon, and the Imperial ambassador Simon Renard was <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> that [...] "Jane of Suffolk and her husband are to lose their heads." ...|$|E
500|$|The Tunnel {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Alex Fletcher of Digital Spy stated that while remakes are [...] "often underwhelming", The Tunnel was [...] "gripping stuff", {{and he believed}} that viewers [...] "should find plenty to enjoy" [...] in the series. The performances of Dillane and Poésy were also lauded. Gerard Gilbert of The Independent was positive in his assessment of the series, stating that [...] "as an avid fan of The Bridge, I am <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> that The Tunnel works well {{in its own right}} – it's intelligently made, well cast and ambitiously cinematic", adding that it had [...] "succeeded in its high-risk strategy of re-working a near-flawless Scandi-drama in our Anglo-French image". Ellen E Jones, also of The Independent, said that Dillane and Poésy's performances [...] "stuck closely" [...] to the original characterisation of the leads from the Scandinavian version. Of the execution, Jones stated: [...] "should you bother watching The Tunnel even if you've already seen the original? The early signs are good. The makers obviously have sense enough to preserve what was effective about the original, and invention enough to distinguish their work too." ...|$|E
50|$|In a {{previous}} career Staunau {{had been an}} expert in advertising, and <b>reports</b> started <b>to</b> appear that the US Chrysler Corporation was keen to incorporate the Staunau cars into its range for a future European sales programme. Many in the press were <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> disseminate these <b>reports.</b> More disturbingly many people were persuaded to part with their savings in order to invest in Staunau's business. When inevitable bankruptcy ensued, Karl-Heinz Staunau purchased a flight to South America, and so {{from the point of}} view of his German creditors, disappeared from view.|$|R
50|$|Owen {{is arrested}} for murder. The group admits {{that it was}} a prank to get Mercedes and Owen back for making them stay on campus. It is {{discovered}} that Mr. Walker was involved with Becky, the gun in his desk being the same one that killed her. Dodger visits Owen, and says that she would never have played the game if she knew that Mr. Walker was cheating on her, revealing she had organized everything. She had killed Becky because she was jealous of Mr. Walker's relationship with her. She had set up the game, knowing that Owen would blame Mr. Walker for the killings, thereby killing him and making her <b>happy.</b> Owen threatens <b>to</b> <b>report</b> her, <b>to</b> which she replies that no one would believe him.|$|R
2500|$|Survival is {{the term}} used for {{what happens to a}} person after he/she has already {{developed}} or contracted a serious illness. [...] Although happiness has been shown to increase health, with survival, {{this may not be the}} case. Survival may be the only area of health that evidence suggests happiness may actually be sometimes detrimental. It is unclear why exactly research results suggest this is the case, however Diener & Biswas-Diener offer an explanation. It is possible that <b>happy</b> people fail <b>to</b> <b>report</b> symptoms of the illness, which can ultimately lead to no treatment or inadequate treatment. Another possible reason may be that <b>happy</b> people tend <b>to</b> be optimistic, leading them to take their symptoms too lightly, seek treatment too late, and/or follow the doctor’s instructions half-heartedly. And lastly, Diener & Biswas-Diener suggest that people with serious illnesses may be more likely to choose to live out the rest of their days without painful or invasive treatments.|$|R
2500|$|Brantley {{reviewed}} the Broadway revival for The New York Times, writing: [...] "Somewhere {{along the road}} from Washington to Broadway, the Kennedy Center production of 'Follies' picked up a pulse. ... I am <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> that since then, Ms. Peters has connected with her inner frump, Mr. Raines has found the brittle skeleton within his solid flesh, and Ms. Maxwell and Mr. Burstein have only improved. Two new additions to the cast, Jayne Houdyshell and Mary Beth Peil, are terrific. This production {{has taken on the}} glint of crystalline sharpness." [...] The production's run was extended, and its grosses exceeded expectations, but it did not recoup its investment.|$|E
2500|$|WWE Hall of Famer Bret [...] "The Hitman" [...] Hart, {{who was a}} multi-time world {{champion}} in both WWE and WCW, enjoyed The Wrestler and applauded Rourke's [...] "clairvoyant" [...] performance, but called the film a [...] "dark misinterpretation" [...] of the business. He asserted: [...] "Randy [...] "The Ram" [...] Robinson was a main-eventer who sold out Madison Square Garden. So was I... Although the film speaks superbly to the speed bumps all pro wrestlers navigate, I’m <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> most of us don’t swerve off the road quite so severely." [...] WWE play-by-play commentator Jim Ross called it a [...] "really strong, dramatic film that depicts how people who are obsessed with {{their own lives and}} their careers can self-destruct".|$|E

30|$|We tested if {{happy and}} unhappy groups {{differed}} in age, gender, income, {{and level of}} education. The results showed that happy people were significantly younger (M =  46, SD =  18.3) than unhappy ones (M =  53, SD =  17.2) by almost 7  years (t =  5.42, df =  798, p <  0.001). The {{groups did not differ}} in gender (χ 2  =  1.81, df =  1, n.s.), but they significantly differed in the level of education (χ 2  =  22.14, df =  2, p <  0.001) with happy group being of higher educational level than the unhappy one. Finally, the groups differed in their income (χ 2  =  48.42, df =  3, p >  0.001). The <b>happy</b> people <b>reported</b> <b>to</b> have higher income than unhappy ones.|$|R

Univariate tests (Table  3) {{revealed that the}} <b>happy</b> group <b>reported</b> <b>to</b> {{spend more time in}} activities listed in the scales of Visiting cultural events, and Family and home activities than the unhappy group. No differences were found in time spent in Active socializing and going out activities. Additionally, the happy group did differ from the unhappy one in the involvement in the community life. Those results confirmed our hypothesis that happy people would be more involved in the community work (d =  0.34) and more engaged in leisure activities than unhappy ones (visiting cultural events d =  0.49; family and home activities d =  0.48). However, one component of the leisure activities that concerned the engagement in the social activities did not differ between two groups.|$|R

30|$|The {{involvement}} in the community work also differed between happy and unhappy citizens, {{but it should be}} pointed out that although significant, the difference between the two groups yielded small effect size. <b>Happy</b> citizens <b>reported</b> <b>to</b> being more frequently involved in helping to organize community events, to clean environment and to actively participate in civil organizations than unhappy ones. The {{involvement in}} the community work was quite low in both groups, which is in line with the findings that participation in voluntary associations is low across Europe (Wallace and Pichler 2009), and especially low in Croatia (Eurofound 2014). One of the reasons that Croatian citizens do not participate more in social activities is that they perceive that as individuals they cannot influence the decisions affecting local or more global community as documented by Franc et al. (2012) in a national survey.|$|R

60|$|There {{are three}} {{principal}} theatres. Two of them, the Park and the Bowery, are large, elegant, and handsome buildings, and are, I grieve to write it, generally deserted. The third, the Olympic, {{is a tiny}} show-box for vaudevilles and burlesques. It is singularly well conducted by Mr. Mitchell, a comic actor of great quiet humour and originality, who is well remembered and esteemed by London playgoers. I am <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> of this deserving gentleman, that his benches are usually well filled, and that his theatre rings with merriment every night. I had almost forgotten a small summer theatre, called Niblo's, with gardens and open air amusements attached; but I believe it is not exempt from the general depression under which Theatrical Property, or what is humorously called by that name, unfortunately labours.|$|E

Clara thought the same, and besides was secretly sure that if he admitted that he had been wrong in part, his uncle would imagine him to mean that he had been wrong in the whole. Their instructions and precautions were trying to James, whose chaplaincy had given him more experience of the sick and the feeble than they gave him credit for; but he was patient enough to amaze Clara and pacify Jane, who ushered him into the sick-chamber. There, even in his worst days, he must have laid aside ill-feeling at the aspect of the shrunken, broken figure in the pillowed arm-chair, prematurely aged, his hair thin and white, his face shrivelled, his eyelid drooping, and mouth contracted. He was still some years under sixty; but this was the result of toil and climate--of the labour generously designed, but how conducted, how resulting? ...|$|E

60|$|More than this, the Duke {{comes out}} the best man in the play. I am <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> to you that Stone does the honourable manly side of that pride inexpressibly better than I should have {{supposed}} possible in him. The scene where he makes that reparation to the slandered woman is certain to be an effect. He is not a jest upon the order of Dukes, but a great tribute to them. I have sat looking at the play (as you may suppose) pretty often, and carefully weighing every syllable of it. I see, in the Duke, the most estimable character in the piece. I am as sure that I represent the audience in this as I am that I hear the words when they are spoken before me. The first time that scene with Hardman was seriously done, it made {{an effect on the}} company that quite surprised and delighted me; and whenever and wherever it is done (but most of all at Devonshire House) the result will be the same.|$|E
