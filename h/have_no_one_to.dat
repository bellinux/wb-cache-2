25|$|One {{option is}} to trade off an intact sexual {{function}} {{for the possibility of}} a prolonged life expectancy by not having curative treatment. The choice involves a trade-off so it is of central importance for the person and the physician to have access to information on established treatment benefits and side effects. A Swedish study found that the willingness {{to do this kind of}} trade-off varied considerably among men. While six out of ten were willing to consider a trade-off between life expectancy and intact sexual function, given the present knowledge of treatment benefits for clinically localized prostate cancer, four out of ten stated that they would under all circumstances choose treatment irrespective of the risk for waning sexual function. Access to valid empirical information is crucial for such decision making. Key factors here are an individual’s feeling towards the illness, their emotional values and religious beliefs. A substantial proportion of people and physicians, experience stress in judging the trade-off between different treatment options and treatment side-effects which adds to the stress of cancer diagnosed, a situation made worse in that eight out of ten people with prostate cancer <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> confide in except their spouse and one out of five live in total emotional isolation.|$|E
500|$|An {{incident}} {{took place}} during the 1941 Harvard–Navy lacrosse game, when the Harvard Crimson men's lacrosse team attempted to field a player of African-American descent. The Navy Midshipmen men's lacrosse team's coach then refused to field his team. Harvard's athletic director, William J. Bingham, overruled his lacrosse coach, and had the player, Lucien Victor Alexis, Jr., sent back to Cambridge on a train. Conant subsequently apologized to the Commandant of Midshipmen. [...] After serving in World War II, Alexis was refused admittance to Harvard Medical School on the grounds that, as the only black student, he would <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> room with. Alexis graduated from Harvard Business School instead.|$|E
500|$|Johnson had {{the matter}} investigated, and after having Cobb's September 24 doubleheader {{statistics}} re-checked, discovered {{only the first}} game of Cobb's statistics had been scored, but not the second game, in which he went 2-for-3. This put Cobb's suggested actual batting average at [...]385, again ahead of Lajoie's. In the end, Johnson ruled that Lajoie's sacrifice bunt should have been recorded as a hit (which would have allowed him to go 9-for-9) but that Cobb's batting average was greater, recording 196 hits in 509 at bats to Lajoie's 227 hits in 591 at bats. Johnson asked Chalmers if his company would award an automobile to each player, to which he agreed. Initially Lajoie refused the car but eventually relented and accepted it. Cobb said, [...] "I am glad that I won an automobile and am especially pleased that Lajoie also gets one. I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> criticize. I know the games were on the square and I am greatly pleased to know that the affair has ended so nicely." [...] Lajoie said, [...] "I am quite satisfied that I was treated fairly in every way by President Johnson, but I think the scorer at St. Louis made an error in not crediting me with nine hits. However, I am glad that the controversy is over. I have the greatest respect for Cobb as a batter and am glad of his success." ...|$|E

2500|$|The name [...] "Yad Vashem" [...] {{is taken}} from a verse in the Book of Isaiah: [...] "To them I will give within my temple and its walls a {{memorial}} and a name better than sons and daughters; I will give them an everlasting name that will endure forever" [...] (...) [...] Naming the Holocaust memorial [...] "yad vashem" [...] (Biblical Hebrew [...] yād wā-šêm) conveys the idea of establishing a national depository for the names of Jewish victims who <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> carry their name after death. The original verse referred to eunuchs who, although {{they could not have}} children, could still live for eternity with the Lord.|$|E
2500|$|Mira's death left Baciu in near-complete {{isolation}} from the Romanian-speaking public. As he later noted: [...] "I literally <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> whom I would read the things I write. There are at most ten Romanian speakers living in Honolulu and none of them, absolutely none, has ever been to a bookstore or a library to peek into, or to ask for, or to purchase a single book of poetry." [...] He honored her memory with a 1979 semi-autobiographical novel, eponymously titled Mira. A new volume of his memoirs saw print in Honolulu in 1980, as Praful de pe tobă ("The Dust on the Drum"). It was taped by Virgil Ierunca and serialized by Radio Free Europe (RFE), which broadcast clandestinely into Romania.|$|E
2500|$|Ament, {{writing to}} Rev. Dr. Judson Smith on 27 December 1900, {{before he became}} aware of any criticism, gives this account of the {{collection}} of indemnities: After a month of very hard work, I am glad to report progress to you. I visited - beginning on the south - Wen An, Pao Ting Hsien, Pa Chou, P'ing Ting, Cho Chou, Liang Hsiang, and on the east, Shun Yi. I found the officials in all these places exceedingly friendly and anxious to settle the affairs of the converts, recognizing the right and the need of such claims. I have made no use of foreign soldiers and brought no external pressure to bear, relying on the justice of our claims. Mr. Conger has supported us in the measures and methods taken, though the military people have not failed to make criticisms. The survivors in all our country stations have been recouped for all their losses, again reinstated in their villages, with some money in hand, and a promise of houses restored next spring. Over and above restoration for the converts there has been gathered a fund for the support of widows and orphans, who have no homes and <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> look after them." ...|$|E

2500|$|By year's end, the Democratic {{governor}} of Missouri, Warren E. Hearnes, warned that Johnson {{would lose the}} state by 100,000 votes, despite winning by a 500,000 margin in 1964. [...] "Frustration over Vietnam; too much federal spending and... taxation; no great public support for your Great Society programs; and ... public disenchantment with the civil rights programs" [...] had eroded the President's standing, the governor reported. There were bright spots; in January 1967, Johnson boasted that wages were the highest in history, unemployment was at a 13-year low, and corporate profits and farm incomes were greater than ever; a 4.5 percent jump in consumer prices was worrisome, as was the rise in interest rates. Johnson asked for a temporary 6 percent surcharge in income taxes to cover the mounting deficit caused by increased spending. Johnson's approval ratings stayed below 50 percent; by January 1967, the number of his strong supporters had plunged to 16%, from 25 percent four months before. He ran about even with Republican George Romney in trial matchups that spring. Asked {{to explain why he}} was unpopular, Johnson responded, [...] "I am a dominating personality, and when I get things done I don't always please all the people." [...] Johnson also blamed the press, saying they showed [...] "complete irresponsibility and lie and misstate facts and <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> be answerable to." [...] He also blamed [...] "the preachers, liberals and professors" [...] who had turned against him.|$|E
