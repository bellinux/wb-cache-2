5000|$|That {{all these}} species were {{properly}} placed in Acraea {{has never been}} generally accepted. In 1807, Johan Christian Fabricius established the genus for the garden acraea, described as Papilio horta by Carl Linnaeus in 1764, and its relatives. By and by, {{an increasing number of}} species were placed <b>here.</b> <b>As</b> <b>early</b> as 1848, and again in 1887 and the early 1990s, it was attempted to divide the genus into groups of closest relatives, as it was suspected that some [...] "Acraea" [...] might actually be closer to other genera in the tribe Acraeini.|$|R

50|$|Box Lane Chapel, a Non-conformist chapel {{founded in}} 1668 on land {{owned by the}} Westbrook Hay estate, was re-built in 1690 and then altered in 1856 and again in 1876.

40|$|The warm circumnuclear dust in {{the inner}} cometary coma reradiates in the IR in the {{wavelength}} range of the ground state rotational band of the dominant atmospheric molecule H 2 O. However, the interaction of this radiation with H 2 O has hitherto not been {{taken into account in}} cometary atmospheric models. <b>Here,</b> <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> two-phase, multifluid model of the dusty atmosphere is extended by including this effect. Although this IR radiation initially pumps the rotational levels of H 2 O, frequent intermolecular collisions in the inner coma transfer this energy from rotational modes to translational modes. As a result the temperature in the innermost coma no longer decreases to about 10 K, as predicted by the earlier models, but reaches a minimum of only about 120 K...|$|R

50|$|His opera Günther von Schwarzburg, {{based on}} the life of the eponymous king (and {{described}} <b>here),</b> was <b>an</b> <b>early</b> German national opera, a performance of which Mozart and his sister attended, through which they met Anton Raaff, who was later to premiere a role in Idomeneo. This opera has recently been recorded on the label cpo. Holzbauer wrote 196 symphonies.|$|R

40|$|The thymic {{primordium}} in both {{birds and}} mammals is first colonized by cells emerging from the intra-embryonic mesenchyme but {{the nature of these}} precursors is poorly understood. We demonstrate <b>here</b> <b>an</b> <b>early</b> embryonic day 7 prethymic population with T lymphoid potential. Our work is a phenotypic analysis of, to date, the earliest embryonic prethymic progenitors arising in the avian para-aortic area during ontogeny. The phenotype of these cells, expressing the cell surface molecules α 2 β 1 integrin, c-kit, thrombomucin/MEP 21, HEMCAM and chL 12, reflects functional properties required for cell adhesion, migration and growth factor responsiveness. Importantly, the presence of these antigens was found to correlate with the recolonization of the recipient thymus following intrathymic cell transfers. These intra-embryonic cells were also found to express the Ikaros transcription factor, the molecular function of which is considered to be prerequisite for embryonic lymphoid development...|$|R
50|$|Ugthorpe was {{an ancient}} demesne of the Crown, and is styled in the Domesday book as Ughetorp. The Mauleys became lords <b>here</b> at <b>an</b> <b>early</b> period, and from them the manor and estate descended by {{marriage}} to the Bigods, and afterwards to the Ratcliffes, by whom the whole was sold in parcels.

30|$|The {{stand-alone}} approach taken <b>here</b> is <b>an</b> <b>early</b> {{indicator of}} the capability of detection and computation that is close at hand. Similar analyses such as Fast Fourier transforms which are available as apps, may expand the capability of stand-alone analysis especially in remote settings where analysis is needed even when the internet and PC are not available. In {{a country where the}} tyranny of distance is a major challenge, these options for immovable cultural heritage may prove to be useful.|$|R
