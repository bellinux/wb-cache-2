In past slumps, Chinese immigrants had been ostracized for being non-Christians, Catholics had been ostracized for being [...] "the wrong kind of Christians", and this time Muslims were suffering the brunt of prejudice. Rabbi Rami Shapiro noted that [...] "Muslims are in the way of God's plan" [...] for some anti-Muslim Christian Zionists, who believe that Muslims in Iran and <b>Iraq</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> forced out of their homes by Israeli expansion that will pave the way for the Second Coming of Jesus. Professor Ron Messier, who teaches Islamic studies and lives in Murfreesboro, commented: [...] "It's happened because this is an election year and I think there were some political candidates who thought that, here in Middle Tennessee, {{a lot of people have}} very right leanings and they could gain some political leverage by promoting fear about people who have been here for 20 years or more without ever being an issue." ...|$|E

5000|$|America's {{presence}} in Middle-Eastern countries like Saudi Arabia {{has been one}} source of discontent that has served {{as an excuse to}} Islamic fundamentalists to commit acts of violence. Even as the U.S. downscales its presence and existing bases (e.g. Saudi Arabia), {{it is not clear that}} the U.S. {{presence in}} <b>Iraq</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> anything but de-stabilising because many in the Muslim world resent the [...] "infidel" [...] presence in the Middle East, using this as a means of inciting the disenfranchised in their populations to violence. On the other hand, a stable democracy in Iraq could have a stabilising influence. Clearly, there was a gamble there, and only the post-war period will prove which viewpiont was correct.|$|E
50|$|The {{international}} Oil-for-Food program (1997-2003) further reduced {{farm production}} by supplying artificially priced foreign foodstuffs. The military action of 2003 did little damage to Iraqi agriculture; because of favorable weather conditions, {{in that year}} grain production was 22 percent higher than in 2002. Although growth continued in 2004, experts predicted that <b>Iraq</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> an importer of agricultural products for the foreseeable future. Long-term plans call for investment in agricultural machinery and materials and more prolific crop varieties—improvements that did not reach Iraq’s farmers under the Hussein regime. In 2004 the main agricultural crops were wheat, barley, corn, rice, vegetables, dates, and cotton, and the main livestock outputs were cattle and sheep.|$|E

5000|$|With the United States {{planning}} {{an attack on}} Iraq, accusing Saddam Hussein of possessing weapons of mass destruction, Abdullah opposed American intervention. [...] "A strike on <b>Iraq</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> disastrous for Iraq and {{the region as a}} whole and will threaten the security and stability of the Middle East", he warned during Dick Cheney's 2002 visit to the Middle East. In March 2003, during a meeting with George W. Bush at the White House, Abdullah tried to dissuade the president from invading Iraq. King Hussein's impartiality was seen as siding with Saddam Hussein during the 1990 Gulf War, which alienated Jordan from its Arab Gulf allies and the Western world; his stance precipitated an economic crisis triggered by the suspension of foreign aid and investment to Jordan. Failing to persuade Bush, Abdullah broke with his father and domestic opposition. He allowed American Patriot batteries to be stationed in the Jordanian desert along its border with Iraq, but did not allow coalition troops to launch an invasion from Jordan. Jordan had received subsidized oil from Saddam Hussein's Iraq at a savings of about $500 million per year, equal to American aid to Jordan at the time.|$|E

The security breakdown in Iraq and Baghdad’s lack of political will to confront Sunni sectarian grievances will, however, continue to provide an attractive theatre for global jihadists.

5000|$|In March 1993, a UN {{investigation}} reported {{hundreds of}} executions of Iraqis from the marshes {{in the preceding}} months, asserting that the Iraqi army's behavior in the south is the most [...] "worrying development Iraq in the past year" [...] and added that following {{the formation of the}} no-fly zone, the army switched to long-range artillery attacks, followed by ground assaults resulting in [...] "heavy casualties" [...] and widespread destruction of property, along with allegations of mass executions. In November 1993, Iran reported {{that as a result of}} the drainage of the marshlands, marsh Iraqis could no longer fish or grow rice and that over 60,000 had fled to Iran since 1991; Iranian officials appealed to the world to send aid to help the refugees. That same month, the UN reported that 40% of the marshlands in the south were drained, while unconfirmed reports surfaced that the Iraq army had used poisonous gas against villages near the border of Iran. In December 1993, the U.S. Department of State accused Iraq of [...] "indiscriminate military operations in the south, which include the burning of villages and forced relocation of non-combatants." [...] On February 23, 1994, Iraq diverted waters from the Tigris river to areas south and east of the main marshlands, resulting in floods of up to 10 feet of water, in order to render the farmlands there useless and drive the rebels who have been hiding there to flee back to the marshes which were being drained of water. In March 1994, a team of British scientists estimated that 57% of the marshlands have been drained and that in 10 to 20 years the entire wetland ecosystem in southern <b>Iraq</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> gone. In April 1994, the U.S. officials said Iraq was continuing a military campaign in Iraq's remote marshes.|$|E
5000|$|On 8 November 2002, the Security Council passed Resolution 1441, by a {{unanimous}} 15-0 vote: Russia, China, France, and Arab {{states such as}} Syria voted in favor. It {{has been argued that}} 1441 impliedly authorized UN member states to wage war against Iraq without any further decision by the UN Security Council. The representatives in the meeting were clear that this was not the case. The United States Ambassador to the United Nations, John Negroponte, said:" [...] This resolution contains no [...] "hidden triggers" [...] and no [...] "automaticity" [...] with respect to the use of force. If there is a further Iraqi breach, reported to the Council by UNMOVIC, the IAEA or a Member State, the matter will return to the Council for discussions as required in paragraph 12. The resolution makes clear that any Iraqi failure to comply is unacceptable and that Iraq must be disarmed. And, one way or another, <b>Iraq</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> disarmed. If the Security Council fails to act decisively in the event of further Iraqi violations, this resolution does not constrain any Member State from acting to defend itself against the threat posed by Iraq or to enforce relevant United Nations resolutions and protect world peace and security."The ambassador for the United Kingdom, the co-sponsor of the resolution, said:" [...] We heard loud and clear during the negotiations the concerns about [...] "automaticity" [...] and [...] "hidden triggers" [...] - the concern that on a decision so crucial we should not rush into military action; that on a decision so crucial any Iraqi violations should be discussed by the Council. Let me be equally clear in response... There is no [...] "automaticity" [...] in this resolution. If there is a further Iraqi breach of its disarmament obligations, the matter will return to the Council for discussion as required in paragraph 12. We would expect the Security Council then to meet its responsibilities."The message was further confirmed by the ambassador for Syria:" [...] Syria voted in favour of the resolution, having received reassurances from its sponsors, the United States of America and the United Kingdom, and from France and Russia through high-level contacts, {{that it would not be}} used as a pretext for striking against Iraq and does not constitute a basis for any automatic strikes against Iraq.
