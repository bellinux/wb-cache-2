40|$|Truncated {{models are}} {{indirect}} methods {{to estimate the}} size of a hidden population which, in contrast to the capture-recapture method, can be used on a single information source. We estimated the coverage of a tuberculosis screening programme among illicit drug users and homeless persons with a mobile digital X-ray unit between 1 January 2003 and 31 December 2005 in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, using truncated models. The screening programme reached about two-third of the <b>estimated</b> <b>target</b> <b>population</b> at least once annually. The intended coverage (at least two chest X-rays per person per year) was about 23 %. We conclude that simple truncated models can be used relatively easily on available single-source routine data to estimate {{the size of a}} population of illicit drug users and homeless persons. We assumed that the most likely overall bias in this study would be overestimation and therefore the coverage of the targeted mobile tuberculosis screening programme would be higher. © 2007 Cambridge University Press...|$|E

This study was motivated by a decline in public confidence, inconsistent results in terms of pass rate and quality of passes, poor performance in core-curricular activities at Matinunura High School and the institution stands to benefit from the effective implementation of the Result Based Management. The {{purpose of the study was}} to ascertain the effectiveness of planning and implementation of RBM to achieve quality education service delivery, determine the effectiveness of administered interventions in the attainment of expected outputs in ensuring quality education service delivery and to establish the key success factors for RBM in attaining quality education service delivery. The literature review was done through inquiry of textbooks, journals, research papers and online sources from different authors on Result Based Management. The researcher used both exploratory and descriptive research designs to carry out the study. The <b>estimated</b> <b>target</b> <b>population</b> was 420 constituting of ordinary level exam classes and upper six students, teachers, administrators at Matinunura as well as education officers where a sample size of 241 was then drawn for this study. Probability and non- probability sampling techniques were employed to draw samples from different targeted groups. The researcher also used questionnaires and interviews to gather primary data of a qualitative and quantitative nature which compelled the researcher to administer quantitative and qualitative approaches of analyzing the gathered data. Secondary data was obtained from the school registers, results analysis, journals and other online sources. It can be noted that the researcher used triangulation of research design, sampling methods, research instruments and data sources to ensure valid and reliability of research results. The researcher were found out that RBM system is difficult to plan and implement as teachers are finding it difficult to translate them into work plans and match resources with the desired results, intervention have not been effective and participation, continuous training and leadership commitment were identified as RBMâ€™s success factors.

The estimated participation rate for cervical cancer screening throughout Senegal is very low (6. 9 % of women 18 – 69  years old), especially in rural areas and among older age groups (only 1. 9 % of women above the age of 40  years). There are no reliable estimates of the prevalence of cervical dysplasia or risk factors for cervical dysplasia specific to rural Senegal. The goals of this study were to estimate the prevalence of cervical dysplasia in a rural region using visual inspection of the cervix with acetic acid (VIA) and to assess risk factors for cervical cancer control. Patients and methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study in which we randomly selected 38 villages across the Kédougou region using a three-stage clustering process. Between October  2013 and March 2014, we collected VIA screening results for women aged 30 – 50  years and cervical cancer risk factors linked to the screening result. Results: We screened 509 women; 5. 6 % of the <b>estimated</b> <b>target</b> <b>population</b> (9, 041) in the region. The point prevalence of cervical dysplasia (positive VIA test) was 2. 10 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 99 – 3. 21). Moreover, 287 women completed the cervical cancer risk factor survey (56. 4 % response rate) and only 38 % stated awareness of cervical cancer; 75. 9 % of the screened women were less than 40  years of age. Conclusion: The overall prevalence of dysplasia in this sample was lower than anticipated. Despite both overall awareness and screening uptake being less than expected, our study highlights the need to address challenges in future prevalence estimates. Principally, we identified that the highest-risk women are the ones least likely to seek screening services, thus illustrating a need to fully understand demand-side barriers to accessing health services in this population. Targeted efforts to educate and motivate older women to seek screenings are needed to sustain an effective cervical cancer screening program.

Estimates of problematic drug use, derived according to agreed guidelines, were collected from all EU countries and Norway. Methods included multipliers based on treatment, police, mortality or AIDS/HIV data, the capture-recapture method and the multivariate indicator method. Prevalence estimates were transformed into rates per 1000 population aged 15 - 64 years. <b>Target</b> <b>populations</b> varied according to data selection. Estimates for six partially overlapping types of drug use could be identified: 'problem opiate use', 'problem opiate or cocaine use', 'problem amphetamine or opiate use', 'problem drug use', '(current) injecting' and 'life-time injecting'. Rates of injectors ranged from 2. 6 in Germany to 4. 8 in Luxembourg; rates in Austria, Denmark, Finland, Portugal and the United Kingdom fell within this range. For problem opiate use, a group of high prevalence countries were found with average rates exceeding six cases (Italy, Luxembourg, Spain and the United Kingdom) and a group with lower prevalence with average rates close to three cases (Austria, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands). Rates obtained for France (problem opiate or cocaine use), Finland and Sweden (problem amphetamine or opiate use) are not directly comparable and fall between these rates.

40|$|While {{no single}} type of model can provide {{adequate}} answers under all circumstances, any modelling endeavour should incorporate three fundamental considerations in any decision-making question: the <b>target</b> <b>population,</b> {{the disease and}} the intervention characteristics. A <b>target</b> <b>population</b> {{is likely to be}} characterized by various types of heterogeneity and a dynamic evolution over time. It is therefore important to adequately capture these population effects on the results of a model. There are essentially two different approaches in modelling a population over time: a cohort-based approach and a population-based approach. In a cohort-based model, a closed group of individuals who have at least one specific characteristic or experience in common over a defined period of time is run through a state transition process. The cohort is generally composed of a hypothetical number of representative or 'average' individuals (i. e. the <b>target</b> <b>population</b> {{is considered to be a}} homogeneous group). The population-based approach projects the evolution of the <b>estimated</b> prevalent <b>target</b> <b>population</b> and intends to reflect as much as possible the demographic, epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the prevalent <b>target</b> <b>population</b> relevant for the decision problem. A cohort-based approach is generally used in most published healthcare decision models. However, this choice is rarely discussed by modellers. In this article, we challenge this assumption. To address the underlying decision problem, we affirm it is crucial that modellers consider the characteristics of the <b>target</b> <b>population.</b> Then, they could opt for using the most appropriate approach. Decision makers should also understand the impact on the results of both types of models in order to make informed healthcare decisions. Cost-effectiveness, Decision-analysis, Modelling. ...|$|R

40|$|Summary. The {{propensity}} score plays {{a central role}} in a variety of causal inference settings. In particular, matching and weighting methods based on the estimated {{propensity score}} have become increasingly common in the analysis of observational data. Despite their popularity and theoretical appeal, the main practical difficulty of these methods is that the propensity score must be estimated. Researchers have found that slight misspecification of the propensity score model can result in substantial bias of estimated treatment effects. We introduce covariate balancing propensity score (CBPS) methodology, which models treatment assignment while optimizing the covariate balance. The CBPS exploits the dual characteristics of the propensity score as a covariate balancing score and the conditional probability of treatment assignment. The estimation of the CBPS is done within the generalized method-of-moments or empirical likelihood framework. We find that the CBPS dramatically improves the poor empirical performance of propensity score matching and weighting methods reported in the literature. We also show that the CBPS can be extended to other important settings, including the estimation of the generalized propensity score for non-binary treatments and the generalization of experimental <b>estimates</b> to a <b>target</b> <b>population.</b> Open source software is available for implementing the methods proposed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. This is a mixed-methods data collection. This study used Respondent Driven Sampling (RDS) methodology, which is a sampling method designed to generate unbiased estimates of population characteristics for populations where a sampling frame is not available. It {{is a form of}} snowball or link-tracing sampling, where respondents are given coupons to recruit other members of the <b>target</b> <b>population,</b> and where respondents are rewarded for both participating and for recruiting others. In addition to variables of interest, data are collected on the number of members of the <b>target</b> <b>population</b> each participant knows. Estimation methods are then applied to account for the non-random sample selection in an attempt to generate unbiased <b>estimates</b> for the <b>target</b> <b>population.</b> In 2010, the researchers conducted an RDS study in a rural Ugandan population where total population data were available. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate whether RDS could generate representative data on a rural Ugandan population by comparing estimates from an RDS survey with total-population data. The data used to define the <b>target</b> <b>population</b> (male household heads) were available from an ongoing general population cohort of 25 villages in rural Masaka, Uganda covering an area of approximately 38 km. Annually, households in the study villages are mapped and after obtaining consent, a total-population household census and an individual questionnaire are administered and blood taken for HIV- 1 testing. A random sample of eligible men in the <b>target</b> <b>population</b> who were not recruited during the RDS study were also interviewed, using the same RDS questionnaire. Finally, 49 qualitative interviews (of which summaries have been deposited) were conducted with a range of people (men and women) including RDS participants and non-participants, and RDS interviewers. These data can be used to evaluate the RDS sampling method, and to test new RDS estimators. Further information may be found in the documentation and in the journal articles listed in the Publications section.

40|$|Capture-recapture {{modelling}} is {{a powerful}} tool for <b>estimating</b> an elusive <b>target</b> <b>population</b> size. This thesis proposes four new population size estimators allowing for population heterogeneity. The first estimator is developed under the zero-truncated of generalised Poisson distribution (ZTGP), called the MLEGP. The two parameters of the ZTGP are estimated by using a maximum likelihood with the Expectation-Maximisation algorithm (EM algorithm). The second estimator is the population size estimator under the zero-truncated Conway-Maxwell-Poisson distribution (ZTCMP). The benefits of using the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson distribution (CMP) are that it includes the Bernoulli, Poisson and geometric distribution as special cases. It is also flexible for over- and under-dispersions relative to the original Poisson model. Moreover, the parameter estimates can be achieved by a simple linear regression approach. The uncertainty in estimating variances of the unknown population size under new estimator is studied with analytic and resampling approaches. The geometric distribution is one of the nested models under the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson distribution, the Turing and the Zelterman estimators are extended for the geometric distribution and its related model, respectively. Variance estimation and confidence intervals are constructed by the normal approximation method. An uncertainty of variance estimation of population size estimators for single marking capture-recapture data is studied in the final part of the research. Normal approximation and three resample approaches of variance estimation are compared for the Chapman and the Chao estimators. All of the approaches are assessed through simulations, and real data sets are provided as guidance for understanding the methodologies. <br/...|$|R

But randomization implies some uncertainty about treatment condition, and individuals differ in their preferences towards taking on risk. Since human subjects often volunteer for experiments, or are allowed {{to drop out of the}} experiment at any time if they want to, it is possible that the sample observed in an experiment might be biased because of the risk of randomization. On the other hand, the widespread use of a guaranteed show-up fee that is non-stochastic may generate sample selection biases of the opposite direction, encouraging more risk averse samples into experiments. We undertake a field experiment to directly test these hypotheses that risk attitudes play a role in sample selection. We follow standard procedures in the social sciences to recruit subjects to an experiment in which we measure their attitudes to risk. We exploit the fact that we know certain characteristics of the population sampled, adults in Denmark, allowing a statistical correction for sample selection bias using standard methods. We also utilize the fact that we have a complex sampling design to provide better <b>estimates</b> of the <b>target</b> <b>population.</b> Our results suggest that randomization bias is not a major empirical problem for field experiments of the kind we conducted if the objective is to identify marginal effects of sample characteristics.

40|$|We {{all hope}} that study results will benefit <b>target</b> <b>populations.</b> However, {{experience}} suggests that extrapolation based on simple induction can be problematic. Here we {{have argued that}} examining mechanisms of action in study and <b>target</b> <b>populations</b> can help justify successful extrapolation and also guide adequate descriptions of interventions. Our proposed method involves (i) establishing that common problems with obtaining knowledge of mechanisms of action have been overcome; (ii) verifying that relevant mechanisms {{in the study and}} <b>target</b> <b>populations</b> are similar; and (iii) establishing that study and target contexts are relevantly similar...|$|R
30|$|Somewhat related is the Capture-Recapture method, which samples a {{specific}} <b>target</b> <b>population</b> {{at a certain}} place and repeats the sampling at a later stage (cf. Berry, 2007). Through the calculation {{of the percentage of}} persons selected in both samples, the size of the <b>target</b> <b>population</b> can be <b>estimated.</b> This method can be used to estimate the size of the <b>target</b> <b>population</b> but not so much for creating a probability sample of sub-populations. Another method based on location sampling was employed to survey migrants in China through pre-defined geographical locations identified through GPS data. Locations were randomly sampled and interviews conducted, which gave better results than those obtained from the census (Landry & Shen, 2005). This method, again, is more appropriate to estimate the size of the <b>target</b> <b>population,</b> but not for creating a probability sample.|$|R
