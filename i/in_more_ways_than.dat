The pastoral setting is integrated into the plot, particularly the guerrilla combat of the Chouans.

Fillmore was accused of complicity in Collier's actions, but this was never substantiated. Nevertheless, there were sound reasons for the selection of Fillmore, as he was a proven vote-getter from electorally crucial New York, and his track record in Congress and as a candidate showed his devotion to Whig doctrine, allaying fears he might be another Tyler were something to happen to General Taylor. Delegates remembered him {{for his role in}} the Tariff of 1842, and he had been mentioned as a vice presidential possibility along with Lawrence and Ohio's Thomas Ewing. His rivalry with Seward (already known for anti-slavery views and statements) made him more acceptable in the South.|$|E

25|$|Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception is an action-adventure {{platform}} {{video game}} played from a third-person perspective, with the player {{in control of}} Nathan Drake. Drake has {{a large number of}} different animation sets, enabling him to react according to his surroundings.

Drake can pick up weapons, automatically replacing the existing weapon he was using, and additional ammunition from downed enemies.|$|E

Coventry would continue being Collingwood's leading goal kicker during the years 1931–1934, and would win his first and only, Copeland Trophy in 1933, where he kicked another 108 goals for the season.|$|E

500|$|A {{review of}} 919 peer-reviewed {{scientific}} studies investigating {{the effects of}} EMF on wildlife, humans and plants included seven studies involving honey bees; six of these reported negative effects from exposure to EMF radiation, but none specifically demonstrated any link to CCD. The review noted that according to one study, when active mobile phones were kept inside beehives, worker bees stopped coming to the hives after 10 days. The same study also found drastic decrease in the egg production of queen bees in these colonies and stated [...] "electromagnetic radiation exposure provides a better explanation for Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) than other theories". [...] The review authors concluded: [...] "existing literature shows that the EMRs are interfering with the biological systems <b>in</b> <b>more</b> <b>ways</b> <b>than</b> one" [...] and recommended recognising EMF as a pollutant.

500|$|The film {{did receive}} some criticism. Geoffrey Macnab of The Independent gave the film a mixed review, writing: [...] "On the one hand, Saving Mr. Banks (which was {{developed}} by BBC Films and has a British producer) is a probing, insightful character study with a very dark undertow. On the other, it is a cheery, upbeat marketing exercise in which the Disney organization is re-promoting {{one of its most}} popular film characters." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle concluded that if the film [...] ""were 100 percent false and yet felt true, that would be fine. But this has the self-conscious whiff, if not of mendacity, then of public relations." [...] Lou Lumenick of The New York Post criticized the accuracy of the film's events, concluding that [...] "Saving Mr. Banks is ultimately much less about magic than making the sale, <b>in</b> <b>more</b> <b>ways</b> <b>than</b> one." [...] American history lecturer John Wills praised the film's attention to detail, such as the inclusion of Travers' original recordings, but doubted that the interpersonal relations between Travers and Disney were as amicable as portrayed in the film. Landon Palmer of Film School Rejects also described several moments where the film had a [...] "shrewd consumption of [...] own criticisms", only to later negate them and Disney-fy Travers as a character.|$|E

The earliest reliable recorded use of artillery in the region was against the Ottoman siege of Constantinople in 1396, forcing the Ottomans to withdraw. The Ottomans acquired their own cannon and laid siege to the Byzantine capital again in 1422. By 1453, the Ottomans used 68 Hungarian-made cannon for the 55-day bombardment of the walls of Constantinople, [...] "hurling the pieces everywhere and killing those {{who happened to be}} nearby." [...] The largest of their cannon was the Great Turkish Bombard, which required an operating crew of 200 men and 70 oxen, and 10,000 men to transport it.

500|$|The girdle's {{symbolic}} meaning, in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, {{has been}} construed {{in a variety}} of ways. Interpretations range from sexual in nature to spiritual. Those who argue for the sexual inference view the girdle as a [...] "trophy". However, it is not entirely clear who the [...] "winner" [...] is: Sir Gawain or Lady Bertilak. The girdle is given to Gawain by Lady Bertilak in order to keep him safe when he confronts the Green Knight. When Lord Bertilak returns home from his hunting trip, Gawain does not reveal the girdle to his host but, instead, hides it. This introduces the spiritual interpretation, that Gawain’s acceptance of the girdle is a sign of his faltering faith in God, at least in the face of death. To some, the Green Knight is Christ, who overcomes death, while Gawain is the Every Christian, who in his struggles to follow Christ faithfully, chooses the easier path. In Sir Gawain, the easier choice is the girdle, which promises what Gawain most desires. Faith in God, alternatively, requires one’s acceptance that what one most desires does not always coincide with what God has planned. It is arguably best to view the girdle not as an either–or situation, but as a complex, multi-faceted symbol that acts to test Gawain <b>in</b> <b>more</b> <b>ways</b> <b>than</b> one. [...] While Gawain is able to resist Bertilak’s wife’s sexual advances, he is unable to resist the powers of the girdle. Gawain is operating under the laws of chivalry which, evidently, have rules that can contradict each other. In the story of Sir Gawain, Gawain finds himself torn between doing what a damsel asks (accepting the girdle) and keeping his promise (returning anything given to him while his host is away).|$|E

[...] Debbie Lynn Elias of Culver City Observer commented, [...] "Female driven with confidence and positivity, Elsa and Anna are like two sides of a coin, both strong, albeit one through power and confidence and the other through clumsy sticktuitiveness and love," [...] while Stephen Holden from The New York Times appreciated that instead of a romantic attachment, it was a sisterly love and devotion that drove the story, which departed greatly from traditional Disney formula.
