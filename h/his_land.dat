5|$|Following the war, Boone {{worked as}} a {{surveyor}} and merchant, but fell deeply into debt through failed Kentucky land speculation. Frustrated with the legal problems resulting from <b>his</b> <b>land</b> claims, in 1799, Boone emigrated to eastern Missouri, where {{he spent most of}} the last two decades of his life (1800–20).|$|E

5|$|In {{his later}} years Clark's {{mounting}} debts {{made it impossible for}} him to retain ownership of <b>his</b> <b>land,</b> since it became subject to seizure due to his debts. Clark deeded much of <b>his</b> <b>land</b> to friends or transferred ownership to family members so his creditors could not seize it. Lenders and their assignees eventually deprived the veteran of nearly all of the property that remained in his name. Clark, who was at one time the largest landholder in the Northwest Territory, was left with only a small plot of land in Clarksville. In 1803 Clark built a cabin overlooking the Falls of the Ohio, where he lived until his health failed in 1809. He also operated a small gristmill, which he worked with two African American slaves.|$|E

Although a Slavic Piast by origin, he encouraged colonization of <b>his</b> <b>lands</b> by German settlers and a {{patron of the}} Cistercian movement, notably founding the Cistercian monastery of Grüssau (Krzeszów).|$|R
5000|$|Robert de Neubourg (d.1159), who {{inherited}} Henry's Norman {{lands and}} was Steward of Normandy. His eldest son Henry de Neubourgh (c. 1130 - 1214) inherited <b>his</b> <b>lands</b> in Normandy, while his younger son Roger de Newburgh (c. 1135 - 1192) inherited <b>his</b> <b>lands</b> in Dorset.|$|R
5|$|Nelson finally {{married in}} 1940 {{in an attempt}} to avoid the draft for World War II. His plan failed and he was drafted anyway. He joined the Military Police in Texas, but while training, he tore a muscle in his leg and was {{transferred}} to Camp Murphy, which was very close to <b>his</b> <b>land.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Edward the Confessor, the parishes of Ruislip and Ickenham belonged to a Saxon named Wlward Wit, a thane of the king who owned land in 11 counties. Ruislip parish {{included}} {{what is now the}} modern Ruislip, Northwood, Eastcote, Ruislip Manor and South Ruislip. Wit lost much of <b>his</b> <b>land</b> during the Norman conquest of England; Arnulf de Hesdin took control of Ruislip – his ownership is recorded within the 1086 Domesday Book.|$|E
5|$|Barrhill flourished {{until about}} 1885, when {{population}} in the village itself peaked at 50, and two effects caused a population decline. Firstly, a recession set in across New Zealand that made people move to where work opportunities presented themselves, and locally those opportunities were created near the stations of the Methven Branch railway. Wason began to gradually sell off parts of <b>his</b> <b>land</b> holdings from the mid-1880s.|$|E

50|$|On 19 September 1289 William Devereux {{acknowledged}} that he owed William de Hamelton, Clerk, £10 to be levied, in default of payment, of <b>his</b> <b>lands</b> and chattels in counties Stafford and Salop. The next month he {{acknowledged that}} he owed Robert Burnell, bishop of Bath and Wells, £10, to be levied, in default of payment, of <b>his</b> <b>lands</b> and chattels in county Hereford, and William de Hamelton received the acknowledgment. On 16 January 1290, William acknowledged the £10 debt once again, but now to be levied, in default of payment, of <b>his</b> <b>lands</b> and chattels in county Somerset. On 22 March 1306 William acknowledged owing William de Hamelton, executor of the will of Robert Burnell, 1 mark to be levied in default of payment of <b>his</b> <b>lands</b> in Herefordshire and Shropshire.|$|R
5|$|Beginning in 1879, Walker and the {{political}} economist Henry George engaged in a prominent debate over economic rents, land, money, and taxes. Based {{on a series of}} lectures delivered at Harvard, Walker published <b>his</b> <b>Land</b> and Its Rent in 1883 as a criticism of George's 1879 Progress and Poverty. Walker's position on international bimetallism influenced his arguments that the primary cause of economic depressions was not land speculation, but rather constriction of the money supply. Walker also criticized George's assumptions that technical progress was always labor saving and whether land held for speculation was unproductive or inefficient.|$|E
5|$|Boone {{served as}} syndic and commandant until 1804, when Missouri {{became part of}} the United States {{following}} the Louisiana Purchase. Because Boone's land grants from the Spanish government had been largely based on verbal agreements, he once again lost <b>his</b> <b>land</b> claims. In 1809, he petitioned Congress to restore his Spanish land claims, which was finally done in 1814. Boone sold most of this land to repay old Kentucky debts. When the War of 1812 came to Missouri, Boone's sons Daniel Morgan Boone and Nathan Boone took part, but by that time Boone was much too old for militia duty.|$|E
5|$|Caesar {{was assassinated}} on March 15, 44 BC. The {{assassination}} {{was led by}} Gaius Cassius and Marcus Brutus. Most of the conspirators were senators, who had a variety of economic, political, or personal motivations for carrying out the assassination. Many were afraid that Caesar would soon resurrect the monarchy and declare himself king. Others feared loss of property or prestige as Caesar carried out <b>his</b> <b>land</b> reforms {{in favor of the}} landless classes. Virtually all the conspirators fled the city after Caesar's death in fear of retaliation. The civil war that followed destroyed {{what was left of the}} Republic.|$|E

5|$|Details of Bonnet's {{military}} service are unclear, {{but he held}} the rank of major in the Barbados militia. The rank was probably due to <b>his</b> <b>land</b> holdings, since deterring slave revolts was an important function of the militia. Bonnet's militia service coincided with the War of the Spanish Succession, {{but there is no}} record that he took part in the fighting.|$|E
5|$|Discussion of damming the White River for {{flood control}} {{began in the}} 1930s, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (CoE) held {{hearings}} on building a dam in January 1946. The new dam would create a lake 50miles (80km) long, and one arm would extend to Monte Ne. Work on Beaver Dam began in 1960 as the CoE impounded and bought land around the White River. In July 1962, Mary Powell sold Camp Joyzelle to the CoE, and W. T. McWhorten sold <b>his</b> <b>land</b> as well.|$|E
5|$|Endecott {{used some}} of his {{properties}} to propagate fruit trees; a pear tree he planted still lives in Danvers, Massachusetts. He also engaged {{in one of the}} earliest attempts to develop a mining industry in the colonies when copper ore was found on <b>his</b> <b>land.</b> His name is found on a rock in Lake Winnipesaukee, carved by surveyors sent to identify the Massachusetts colony's northern border in 1652. Places and institutions are named for him, and (like many early colonists) he has several notable descendants.|$|E
50|$|It {{was thought}} that Malet had some quarrel with the king, and again lost <b>his</b> <b>lands,</b> {{on the basis of}} some {{statements}} by Orderic Vitalis, but most historians now think Orderic confused Malet with his successor William. Instead it appears he remained in the king's confidence and held <b>his</b> <b>lands</b> until <b>his</b> death.|$|R
50|$|Sir James Luttrell died {{fighting}} for the Lancastrian cause at the Battle of St Albans inn 1461. He was posthumously attainted for high treason and <b>his</b> <b>lands</b> were forfeited to the crown.

5|$|Everton {{originally}} {{played on}} an open pitch in the south-east corner of the newly laid out Stanley Park, the same site where Liverpool F.C. planned a stadium, however abandoned the project. The first official match took place in 1879. In 1882, a Mr J. Cruit donated land at Priory Road with the necessary facilities required for professional clubs. Cruit asked the club to leave <b>his</b> <b>land</b> after two years because the crowds became far too large and noisy.|$|E
5|$|For many at the indaba, {{the most}} {{pressing}} motivator was Matabeleland's security. While Lobengula considered the Transvaalers more formidable battlefield adversaries than the British, he understood that Britain was more prominent on the world stage, and while the Boers wanted land, Rudd's party claimed to be interested only in mining and trading. Lobengula reasoned that if he accepted Rudd's proposals, he would keep <b>his</b> <b>land,</b> and the British would be obliged {{to protect him from}} incursions by the Boers.|$|E
5|$|In 1750, Squire Boone sold <b>his</b> <b>land</b> {{and moved}} the family to North Carolina. Daniel Boone did not attend church again. He {{identified}} as a Christian and had all of his children baptized. The Boones eventually settled on the Yadkin River, {{in what is now}} Davie County, about two miles (3km) west of Mocksville. This was in the western backwoods area.|$|E

5|$|In 1854, Waller and {{two other}} people were chosen to find a {{location}} for Bloomsburg's Rosemont Cemetery. They chose a hill immediately north of Bloomsburg, which was partly <b>his</b> <b>land,</b> so on August 1, 1855 he sold them 2 acres and 33.5 perches of land to the Rosemont Cemetery Company for $490.

5|$|In 1882, Crease {{presided over}} the trial of John Hall, who owned {{most of the land}} on Burrard Inlet that now makes up the {{community}} of Belcarra, British Columbia, and who was accused of murdering his mother in law. Hall and Crease had known each other for years, and Crease had once employed him as his agent in a dispute with trespassers who illegally logged on land he and his friend Robert Burnaby owned near Hall's ranch. Hall was found guilty of manslaughter, and <b>his</b> <b>land</b> signed over to his attorney to pay for his defence.|$|E
5|$|In Didden v. Village of Port Chester (2006), an {{unrelated}} case {{brought about by}} the same town's actions, Sotomayor joined a unanimous panel's summary order to uphold a trial court's dismissal – due to a statute of limitations lapse – of a property owner's objection to <b>his</b> <b>land</b> being condemned for a redevelopment project. The ruling further said that even without the lapse, the owner's petition would be denied due to application of the Supreme Court's recent Kelo v. City of New London ruling. The Second Circuit's reasoning drew criticism from libertarian commentators.|$|E
