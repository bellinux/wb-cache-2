5|$|Icings – Roofs {{must also}} be {{designed}} to avoid ice dams, which result from meltwater running under the snow {{on the roof and}} freezing at the eave. Ice dams on roofs form when accumulated snow on a sloping roof melts and flows down the roof, under the insulating blanket of snow, until it reaches below <b>freezing</b> <b>temperature</b> air, typically at the eaves. When the meltwater reaches the freezing air, ice accumulates, forming a dam, and snow that melts later cannot drain properly through the dam. Ice dams may result in damaged building materials or in damage or injury when the ice dam falls off or from attempts to remove ice dams. The melting results from heat passing through the roof under the highly insulating layer of snow.|$|E

25|$|In the laboratory, {{glycerol}} is {{a common}} component of solvents for enzymatic reagents stored at temperatures below 0°C due to the depression of the <b>freezing</b> <b>temperature</b> of solutions with high concentrations of glycerol. It is also used as a cryoprotectant where the glycerol is dissolved in water to reduce damage by ice crystals to laboratory organisms that are stored in frozen solutions, such as bacteria, nematodes, and mammalian embryos.|$|E
25|$|A zone {{of rapid}} {{salinity}} increase with depth {{is called a}} halocline. The temperature of maximum density of seawater decreases as its salt content increases. <b>Freezing</b> <b>temperature</b> of water decreases with salinity, and boiling temperature of water increases with salinity. Typical seawater freezes at around −1.9nbsp&°C at atmospheric pressure. If precipitation exceeds evaporation, {{as is the case}} in polar and temperate regions, salinity will be lower. If evaporation exceeds precipitation, {{as is the case in}} tropical regions, salinity will be higher. Thus, oceanic waters in polar regions have lower salinity content than oceanic waters in temperate and tropical regions.|$|E
25|$|Misruns {{and cold}} shuts {{are closely related}} and both involve the {{material}} freezing before it completely fills the mold cavity. These types of defects are serious because the area surrounding the defect is significantly weaker than intended. The castability and viscosity of the material can be important factors with these problems. Fluidity affects the minimum section thickness that can be cast, the maximum length of thin sections, fineness of feasibly cast details, and the accuracy of filling mold extremities. There are various ways of measuring the fluidity of a material, although it usually involves using a standard mould shape and measuring the distance the material flows. Fluidity {{is affected by the}} composition of the material, <b>freezing</b> <b>temperature</b> or range, surface tension of oxide films, and, most importantly, the pouring temperature. The higher the pouring temperature, the greater the fluidity; however, excessive temperatures can be detrimental, leading to a reaction between the material and the mold; in casting processes that use a porous mould material the material may even penetrate the mould material.|$|E

2500|$|Carson {{had made}} a name for himself as a {{distinguished}} individual when handling manners with the indigenous population. [...] He enlisted the neighboring tribes in aiding his campaign to capture as many Navajos as he could. One tribe that proved to be most useful were the Utes. The Utes were very knowledgeable of the lands of the Navajos, and were very familiar with Navajo strongholds as well. Carson would launch his full-scale assault on the Navajo population in January 1864. He would destroy everything in his path, eradicating the way of life of the Navajo people. Hogans were burned to the ground, livestock was killed off, and irrigated fields would be destroyed. Navajos who surrendered were taken to Fort Canby and those who resisted were killed. Navajos would be able to escape Carson's campaign but were soon forced to surrender due to starvation and the <b>freezing</b> <b>temperature</b> of the winter months.|$|E

2500|$|While {{the use of}} {{irrigation}} is disparaged or even prohibited in many premium wine producing regions, its use in Washington is absolutely vital and is a major asset in quality wine production. The average vineyard in Eastern Washington receives approximately [...] in annual rainfall, most of it during the winter months. Without irrigation, agriculture in the region would not be possible. Compared to other wine regions that do not need or practice irrigation, a vineyard manager in Washington State has {{more control over the}} potential quality of the grapes. Utilizing drip irrigation and controlling the amount of water the vines receive and wine allows the grower to limit the amount of vigor (and thus yields) of vine and leverage water stress to produce more concentrated flavors and phenolic compounds in the grape. Growers will often withhold water early in the growing season to control the leaf canopy, which can have a beneficial business aspect by saving money compared to using costly viticultural chores such as sucker pruning, leaf striping and mildew treatment to control and tend to the leaf canopy. Applying a controlled amount of water during the ripening period following veraison encourages the grapes to ripen faster without a reductive loss in quality. One additional benefit {{of irrigation}} is frost protection. Following harvest, growers will soak the soil of the vineyard to moisten the soil down to two feet. As temperatures drop, this water can form a protective layer of ice that will give the vine a few extra degrees of protection from <b>freezing</b> <b>temperature</b> that may damage the roots.|$|E
