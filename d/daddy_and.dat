25|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s, {{high-end}} champagne brands have {{been featured in}} rap and hip hop music and videos; bottles featured in videos are often quite blingy and distinctive, often gold.

Mark is now living with an older Swedish woman named Ingrid and her children who call Mark <b>Daddy</b> <b>and</b> is working as a mechanic at a go-cart track.

25|$|Riley's group {{arrives at}} the city only to come upon a raised drawbridge. Riley leaves to bring the bridge down, but {{a small group of}} zombies begin to attack Dead Reckoning.
