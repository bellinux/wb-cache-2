40|$|Automated {{residential}} {{irrigation systems}} tend {{to result in}} higher water use than non-automated systems. Increasing the scheduling efficiency of an automated irrigation system provides the opportunity to conserve water resources while maintaining good landscape quality. Control technologies available for reducing over-irrigation include evapotranspiration (ET) based controllers, soil moisture sensor (SMS) controllers, and rain sensors (RS). The purpose {{of this research was}} to evaluate the capability of these control technologies to schedule irrigation compared to a soil water balance model based on the Irrigation Association (IA) Smart Water Application Technologies (SWAT) testing protocol. <b>Irrigation</b> <b>adequacy</b> and scheduling efficiency were calculated in 30 -day running totals to determine the amount of over- or under-irrigation for each control technology based on the IA SWAT testing protocol. A time-based treatment with irrigation 2 days/week and no rain sensor (NRS) was established as a comparison. In general, the <b>irrigation</b> <b>adequacy</b> ratings (measure of under-irrigation) for the treatments were higher during the fall months of testing than the spring months due to lower ET resulting in lower irrigation demand. Scheduling efficiency values (measure of over-irrigation) decreased for all treatments when rainfall increased. During the rainy period of this testing, total rainfall was almost double reference evapotranspiration (ETo) while in the remaining three testing periods the opposite was true. The 30 -day <b>irrigation</b> <b>adequacy</b> values, considering all treatments, varied during the testing periods by 0 - 68 percentile points. Looking at only one 30 -day testing period, as is done in the IA SWAT testing protocol, will not fully capture the performance of an irrigation controller. Scheduling efficiency alone was not a good indicator of controller performance. The amount of water applied and the timing of application were both important to maintaining acceptable turfgrass quality and receiving good <b>irrigation</b> <b>adequacy</b> and scheduling efficiency scores.

40|$|Evapotranspiration-based {{irrigation}} controllers, {{also known}} as ET controllers, use ET information or estimation to schedule irrigation. Previous {{research has shown that}} ET controllers could reduce irrigation as much as 42 % when compared to a time-based irrigation schedule. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the capability of three brands of ET-based irrigation controllers to schedule irrigation compared to a theoretically derived soil water balance model based on the Irrigation Association Smart Water Application Technologies (SWAT) protocol to determine the effectiveness of irrigation scheduling. Five treatments were established, T 1 -T 5, replicated four times for a total of twenty field plots in a completely randomized block design. The irrigation treatments were as follows: T 1, Weathermatic SL 1600 with SLW 15 weather monitor; T 2, Toro Intelli-sense; T 3, ETwater Smart Controller 100; T 4, a time-based treatment determined by local recommendations; and T 5, a reduced time-based treatment 60 % of T 4. All treatments utilized rain sensors set at a 6 Â mm threshold. A daily soil water balance model was used to calculate the theoretical irrigation requirements for comparison with actual irrigation water applied. Calculated in 30 -day running totals, <b>irrigation</b> <b>adequacy</b> and scheduling efficiency were used to quantify under- and over-irrigation, respectively. The study period, 25 May 2006 through 27 November 2007, was drier than the historical average with a total of 1326 Â mm of rainfall compared to 1979 Â mm for the same historical period. It was found that all treatments applied less irrigation than required for all seasons. Additionally, the ET controllers applied only half of the irrigation calculated for the theoretical requirement for each irrigation event, on average. <b>Irrigation</b> <b>adequacy</b> decreased when the ET controllers were allowed to irrigate any day of the week. All treatments had decreased scheduling efficiency averages in the rainy season with the largest decrease of 29 percentile points with a timer and rain sensor (T 4) and an average decrease of 20 percentile points for the ET controllers, indicating that site specific rainfall has a significant effect on scheduling efficiency results. Rainfall did not drastically impact the average <b>irrigation</b> <b>adequacy</b> results. For this study, there were two controller program settings that impacted the results. The first setting was the crop coefficients where specific values were chosen for the location of the study when calculating the theoretical requirement whereas the controllers used default values. The second setting was the soil type that defines the soil water holding capacity of the soil. The ET controllers were able to regularly adjust to real-time weather, unlike the conventional irrigation timers. However, the incorporation of site specific rainfall measurements is extremely important to their success at managing landscape water needs and at a minimum a rain sensor should be used.

40|$|Introduction: Designing and {{management}} of sprinkler irrigation systems depend on the situation and location of its implementation and often rely on professional and long-term tests (9). Having a good irrigation system depends on knowledge {{of the relationship between}} soil, water, plants, irrigation scheduling, the required amount of irrigation water to the water-holding capacity of soil, climate and plant growth (6). The less use of sprinkler irrigation systems and less performed research projects in the Guilan province, lack of correct design parameters due to shortage of the required parameters for local and regional planning, has led to reliance on charts and tables. Therefore, planning water resources cannot be performed well and with accurate details. According to many researchers (8), the technical evaluation should be a regular and short-term process to review the problems and possible performance of irrigation systems. Merriam and Keller (10) defined the assessment of an irrigation system analysis, based on field measurements in real terms during the normal work of the system. Therefore, to develop these systems over the next few years, it is essential to evaluate the use of irrigation systems and review the performance of existing problems and utilizing the results to improve it. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the current status of implemented irrigation systems in the tea plantations of Guilan and evaluate their performance. Materials and Methods: In this study, six classic sprinkler irrigation systems in tea fields of Guilan province were evaluated during two years. Sprinkler irrigation systems of semi-portable, solid-set and solid-set (hand-move sprinkler) were selected randomly. To evaluate this irrigation systems, Christiansen’s uniformity coefficient (CU), distribution uniformity (DU), potential application efficiency of low-quarter (PELQ) and application efficiency of low-quarter (AELQ) in the form of trial blocks were estimated by measuring pressure fluctuations which were applied to the entire system. Using irrigated area and <b>irrigation</b> water depth, <b>adequacy</b> of <b>irrigation</b> curve, deep percolation losses and spray losses were determined on the basis of existing relationships. Results and Discussion: Average values of CU, DU, PELQ and AELQ for 6 tea fields were 65, 52, 44 and 44 percent, respectively. Application efficiency in all irrigation systems, Christiansen’s uniformity coefficient and distribution uniformity were lower than recommended values in the references. Merriam and Keller (11) reported the allowable range for potential application efficiency of low-quarter between 65 to 85 percent. With respect to irrigation less than the actual water requirement of the plant in tea fields, AELQ was equal with PELQ. Untechnical design and implementation of irrigation systems, particularly poor operating pressure and economic problems were detected as the main reasons for the low PELQ. Simultaneous use of sprinklers with different specifications and models, old irrigation systems, water leakage from valves and other equipment, practically change the pressure and flow rate, which were the main reasons for the decrease in uniformity of water distribution and application efficiency of low-quarter. According to Cobban (4) uniformity coefficient of sprinkler irrigation systems were reported between 31 to 55 percent in Tanzania tea fields and in other reports were between 58 to 72 percent (7), which was due to poor design, long spacing of sprinklers and high speed wind. Christiansen’s uniformity coefficient and distribution uniformity of low-quarter in ED, WB & EP systems were lower than recommended values by Merriam and Keller (...|$|R
40|$|Farmers {{continue}} to show great differences in irrigation water use, {{even for a}} given location and crop. Irrigation advisory services have narrowed the gap between scientific knowledge and on-farm scheduling, but their success has been limited. The performance of sprinkler irrigation is greatly affected by factors such as wind speed, whose short-time variability requires tactical adjustments of the irrigation schedule. Mounting energy costs often require the consideration of interday and intraday tariff evolution. Opportunities have arisen that allow these challenges to be addressed through irrigation controllers guided by irrigation and crop simulation models. Remote control systems are often installed in collective pressurized irrigation networks. Agrometeorological information networks are available in regions worldwide. Water users’ associations use specialized databases for water management. Different configurations of irrigation controllers based on simulation models can develop, continuously update, and execute irrigation schedules aiming at maximizing <b>irrigation</b> <b>adequacy</b> and water productivity. Bottlenecks requiring action {{in the fields of}} research, development, and innovation are analyzed, with the goal of establishing agendas leading to the implementation and commercial deployment of advanced controllers for solid-set irrigation...|$|E
40|$|Water {{conservation}} {{is an important}} issue today. In 2005, the average residential water use in the United States was 371 liters capita 1 day 1 (USGS, 2005). In Utah, water is a limited resource; it’s the second most arid state in the nation, and is prone to droughts. In 2005, the average domestic or residential water use was 971 liters capita- 1 day- 1, of this, 439 liters capita- 1 day- 1 was used for watering lawns, plants, and gardens (Utah Division of Water Resources, 2007). Additionally, Utah is {{one of the fastest growing}} and most highly urbanized states. Therefore, residential and commercial landscape watering is a large potential source of urban water conservation. Climate-based irrigation controllers, also known as “smart controllers”, have been developed to help conserve water in landscapes with an automatic irrigation system installed. Smart controllers measure weather conditions daily to determine the amount of water plants need and allow irrigation. The main objective of this study was to evaluate, in a landscape setting, whether different climate-based irrigation controllers achieve different levels of water conservation. The experiment took place at Utah State University’s Greenville Research Farm in plots composed of an area of turfgrass (21 m 2) irrigated with sprinkler heads and another area of ornamental plants (7 m 2) irrigated with a drip irrigation system. Four experimental treatments with 5 replications were evaluated and arranged in a randomized complete block design. Each treatment represented a different irrigation controller. Hunter® Solar Sync and WeatherMatic® controllers used on-site sensors to measure weather conditions, while Rainbird® ET Manager used a remote paging signal to retrieve weather data from the closest weather station. In addition, standard irrigation controllers were programmed to irrigate control plots with schedules based on historical ETo of the hottest month of the year. Measurements were made during 10 -week periods during 2011 and 2012. Data collected and analyzed included weather conditions, weekly and overall water application amounts, distribution uniformity of the irrigation system, <b>irrigation</b> <b>adequacy,</b> and irrigation efficiency. Overall controller performance was analyzed using correlations between <b>irrigation</b> <b>adequacy</b> and efficiency. Results indicated average water savings based on the control treatment of 37, 39. 5 and 48 % for the Hunter® Solar Sync, Rainbird® ET Manager, and Weathermatic® controllers, respectively. Statistically significant differences in weekly water application indicated that the Weathermatic® controller applied significantly less water than the other treatments; Rainbird® ET Manager and Hunter® Solar Sync were not significantly different from one another. Control plots had significantly higher water applications than the rest of the treatments. Climate-based controllers modified irrigation scheduling based on weather, with noticeable changes during precipitation events. Irrigation efficiency values for all climate-based controllers were significantly higher than the control treatment. In 2011, Weathermatic® controllers had the best performance, followed by Hunter® Solar Sync and Rainbird® ET Manager. In 2012, all climate based-controllers performed significantly better than the control treatment. All of the climate-based controllers evaluated in the study are recommended for use in landscape for improving irrigation efficiency. Additional research that integrates plant health and quality, and evaluations of cost, adaptability, installation, programming and failure events are recommended...|$|E
40|$|Large-scale {{irrigation}} schemes have not yielded the expected outcomes in Sub-Saharan Africa. In Mauritania, average land productivity of rice schemes lies between 3 and 3. 5 tha - 1 and irrigated land has progressively being abandoned. At the same time, there is new international attention towards interventions in large-scale irrigation in the Sahel. Spatial and temporal variability of production are main causes of low productivity of large-scale {{irrigation schemes}} in Mauritania and threats to their sustainability. The present paper {{focuses on the}} performance of three representative large-scale schemes located along the River Senegal by analysing intra-scheme variability with respect to yield and irrigation intensity using field observations and satellite images. A sample of tertiary canals was selected in each irrigation scheme for weekly surveys of irrigation processes and maintenance. Yield measurement, irrigation (II) and harvest intensity (HI), indicators of <b>irrigation</b> <b>adequacy</b> (IIA) and drainage adequacy (IDA) constituted the basis of this analysis. Semi-structured interviews with the different actors at the various management levels (farmers; cooperatives; union of cooperatives; state irrigation agency; and the private service provider managing the water delivery in one of the schemes) were held in order to gain information on irrigation and drainage infrastructure, organisation and management of the schemes, financial aspects and irrigated surface. Within each irrigation scheme, a great variability was detected with respect to irrigation intensity and yield. Irrigation intensity could vary as much as from 0 to 1 whilst yield could range from 0. 4 to 7 tha - 1 in a single scheme. The analysis of water distribution patterns at scheme level indicated that variability in irrigation supplies and drainage were main sources of variability of yields and irrigation intensity. Physical, technical, and organisational factors underlie non-uniform water distribution patterns. The understanding of the origins of patterns of variability is a first step towards a more realistic assessment of schemes' sustainability and contribution to food security. © 2012 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{technical}} efficiency of sprinkler irrigation of smallholder sugarcane scheme in the Lubovane area of Swaziland in terms of design parameters, frequency of water application, adequacy of irrigation and irrigation uniformity. The study was done in Imbali Yamadlenya, Nxutsamlo and Ziyanhle irrigation schemes. Data were collected from each scheme using both primary and secondary data sources between June and September 2013. Primary data included informal interviews and field measurements about operations of the schemes while secondary data included literature review and design documents. Data were analyzed using Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel. All the schemes were under-performing in terms of the frequency of <b>irrigation,</b> <b>adequacy</b> and irrigation uniformity. Both Imbali Yamadlenya Farmers Association (FA) and Nxutsamlo FA had their emitters discharging more water than the designed specifications while at Ziyanhle FA the discharge was below the design specification. The flow variations for Imbali Yamadlenya, Nxutsamlo FA and Ziyanhle FA were 9. 3 %, 18. 6 % and - 38. 4 % respectively. The operating pressure variations were found to be 10 %, 8. 6 % and - 40 % for Imbali Yamadlenya FA, Nxutsamlo FA and Ziyanhle FA respectively. The first two schemes were over-irrigated while Ziyanhle FA was under-irrigated. The farmers in all the schemes had no systematic irrigation scheduling. They used the â€œfeelâ€ method to determine soil moisture content with one irrigation pattern adopted for the entire season. The calculated CWRs were 4. 1 mm/day, 11. 1 mm/day and 1. 7 mm/day for Imbali Yamadlenya FA, Nxutsamlo FA and Ziyanhle FA respectively. The observed basic infiltration rates for Nxutsamlo, Ziyanhle and Imbali Yamadlenya irrigation schemes were 19. 8 mm/h, 31. 8 mm/hr and 10. 2 mm/hr respectively which meant the soil could absorb water from the sprinklers without experiencing surface runoff. The calculated CUs for Nxutsamlo FA, Ziyanhle FA and Imbali Yamadlenya FA were 55 %, 45 % and 70 % respectively while the DUs calculated were 33. 3 %, 50 % and 60 % for all the schemes respectively. The project management need to develop technical interventions for capacity building of the smallholder farmers to better manage their irrigation schemes in order to achieve the projectâ€™s goal of reducing poverty and improving their livelihoods and that of their communities.,WaterNe...|$|E
40|$|A smart {{controller}} {{testing facility}} {{was established by}} the Irrigation Technology Center at Texas A&M University in College Station in 2008 in order to evaluate their performance from an ?enduser? point of view. The ?end-user? {{is considered to be}} the landscape or irrigation professional (such as a Licensed Irrigator in Texas) installing the controller. Controllers are tested using the Texas Virtual Landscape which is composed of 6 different zones with varying plant materials, soil types and depths, and precipitation rates. This report summaries the results from the 2010 evaluations. Eight controllers were evaluated over a 238 day period, from March 29 - November 22, 2010. Controller performance is analyzed for the entire evaluation period as well as seasonally (spring, summer, fall). Controller performance is evaluated by comparison to the irrigation recommendation of the TexasET Network and Website. This year, we introduce a new evaluate methodology: <b>irrigation</b> <b>adequacy</b> in order to identify controllers which apply excessive and inadequate amounts of water. Programing smart controllers for specific site conditions continues to be a problem. Only two (2) of the eight (8) controllers tested could be programmed directly with all the parameters needed to define each zone. The 2010 results showed an increase in controller performance compared to the Year One and Year Two results. However, we continue to see controllers irrigating excessively; some irrigated in excess of ETc even though 17 inches of rainfall fell during the study. Total Irrigation Amounts * When looking at total irrigation amounts for the entire landscape, one (1) controller was within +/- 20 % the recommendation of the TexasET Network for five (5) stations * Two (2) controllers applied greater than a simple ETc model (ETo x Kc, neglecting rainfall) and one (1) controller was greater than ETo. Adequacy Analysis * No controllers were consistently able (across all 6 stations) to adequately meet the plant water requirements throughout the entire season. * The results showed inconsistency in performance by the 8 controllers, with three (3) controllers irrigating excessive volumes and four (4) controllers irrigating inadequate volumes. * Two (2) controllers had five (5) stations irrigate adequate amounts and two (2) controllers had four (4) stations irrigate adequate amounts. Factors that could have caused over/under irrigation of landscapes are improper ETo calculations and insufficient accounting for rainfall. Only three (3) controllers were equipped with ?tipping bucket? type rain gauges which actually measure rainfall. Two of these were consistency among the top 3 performing controllers. Based on 2010 performance, controllers which used onsite sensors for ET calculations irrigated closer to the recommendations of the TexasET Network than those which operate on an ET subscription. It was observed that controllers that used on site sensors more often produced inadequate irrigation amounts compared to ET subscription controllers that generally produced excessive irrigation amounts...|$|E
