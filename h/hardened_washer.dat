5000|$|DTIs {{within the}} RCSC Specification section 8.2.4 are {{described}} thus: [...] "ASTM F959 direct tension indicators are recognized in this Specification as a bolt-tension-indicating device. Direct tension indicators are <b>hardened</b> <b>washer</b> shaped devices incorporating small arch-like protrusions on the bearing surface {{that are designed}} to deform in a controlled manner when subjected to compressive load." ...|$|E
50|$|A superbolt, or multi-jackbolt {{tensioner}} is {{an alternative}} type of fastener that retrofits or replaces existing nuts, bolts, or studs. Tension in the bolt is developed by torquing individual jackbolts, which are threaded through {{the body of the}} nut and push against a <b>hardened</b> <b>washer.</b> Because of this, the amount of torque required to achieve a given preload is reduced. Installation and removal of any size tensioner is achieved with hand tools, which can be advantageous when dealing with large diameter bolting applications.|$|E
5000|$|Regarding the ASTM F959 {{manufacturing}} specification, the Abstract {{from the}} ASTM website describe DTIs as [...] "capable of indicating {{the achievement of}} a specified minimum bolt tension in a structural bolt and are intended for installation under either a bolt head or a <b>hardened</b> <b>washer.</b> Steel materials used {{in the manufacture of}} direct tension indicators shall be designed, processed, heat treated, and protectively coated as specified. The direct tension indicators shall conform to required chemical composition, compression load, and dimensional values." ...|$|E
50|$|Washers {{are usually}} metal or plastic. High-quality bolted joints require <b>hardened</b> steel <b>washers</b> {{to prevent the}} loss of {{pre-load}} due to Brinelling after the torque is applied.|$|R
40|$|The {{test data}} {{reported}} herein {{deals with the}} fundamental behavior of several large structural truss-type connections consisting of 1 / 2 -in. gusset plates and 18 -in. I-beams, fabricated with either rivets or high strength steel bolts. Of the three specimens tested, one was fastened with hotdriven rivets while {{the other two were}} bolted. One of the bolted specimens was assembled with <b>hardened</b> beveled <b>washers</b> against the sloping faces of the I-beam flanges to provide parallel bearing faces for the bolts; the other was fastened using only <b>hardened</b> flat <b>washers.</b> A study of the load-slip and load-strain behavior is made for the three specimens and fundamental differences in their behaviors are pointed out. The distribution of stresses across the critical sections in the webs of the members is analyzed for all stages of the tests to determine what portion of the load on each specimen was resisted by the web. This makes it possible to determine the efficiency of the web and the flanges in resisting the loads applied to the members.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a review of}} different techniques to tighten a bolted joint and investigates {{the ability of the}} methods to tighten the joint to a prescribed bolt tension. A literature survey was undertaken which revealed that different opinions exist regarding the performance of certain tightening methods and the influence of several commonly encountered factors on them. Test equipment was designed and built to study the performance of five tightening methods: torque control, angle control - elastic range, angle control - yield range, yield control, and load indicating washers. The effects of a number of practical factors on the performance of these methods were investigated. The main factors investigated were: joint stiffness, nut and bolt plating and geometry, and washer type. The tests have shown that yield controlled tightening and angle control (yield range) provide the most accurate methods of tightening a bolted joint to a prescribed bolt tension (+/- 5 %). Torque control and load indicating washers (Coronet) can tighten the joint to +/- 10 %. Angle control (elastic range) gives relatively poor control over bolt tension (+/- 14 %), largely due to variations in snug position and tension-angle gradient. The deflections of the joint components influence the performance of the angle-related tightening methods. The deflection of the threaded connection itself is significant, especially for 'hard' joints. This contribution to the overall deflection has been largely neglected in previous studies. Methods to improve the accuracy of the tightening methods are discussed. In particular the use of <b>hardened</b> <b>washers</b> to improve the accuracy and repeatability of torque control is recommended. Furthermore, preliminary tests were conducted on the design of a washer, which would indicate when the joint has been tightened to a prescribed tension...|$|R
5000|$|Brinelling can {{be caused}} by a heavy load resting on a {{stationary}} bearing for an extended length of time. The result is a permanent dent or [...] "brinell mark". The brinell marks will often appear in evenly spaced patterns along the bearing races, resembling the primary elements of the bearing, such as rows of indented lines for needle or roller bearings or rounded indentations in ball bearings. It is a common cause of roller bearing failures, and loss of preload in bolted joints when a <b>hardened</b> <b>washer</b> is not used. For example, brinelling occurs in casters when the ball bearings within the swivel head produce grooves in the hard cap, thus degrading performance by increasing the required swivel force.|$|E
50|$|Multi-jackbolt {{tensioners}} (MJTs), registered {{under the}} trademark Superbolt or Supernut, {{are designed to}} decrease the torque required to tighten large bolted joints. One of the major problems associated with traditional bolt tightening methods is as {{the diameter of the}} bolt increases, the amount of torque required to tighten it increases in the third power of the diameter. Because of this, the largest size bolt a person can typically tighten by hand is 1".Multi-jackbolt tensioners reduce the amount of torque required to clamp the joint by using multiple jackbolts threaded through the nut or bolt head.The jackbolts, which are small enough to be tightened by simple hand tools, thrust against a <b>hardened</b> <b>washer</b> and generate clamping force on the joint. Loads up to 20,000,000 pounds and greater are attainable using only hand tools. MJTs and related products are produced by Superbolt, Inc. in Carnegie, PA.|$|E

40|$|A high-strength, low-weight {{pressure}} vessel dome was {{designed specifically to}} house a high-pressure [2, 000 psi (approx. = 13. 8 MPa) ] electrolyzer. In operation, the dome is filled with an inert gas pressurized to roughly 100 psi (approx. = 690 kPa) above the high, balanced pressure product oxygen and hydrogen gas streams. The inert gas acts to reduce the clamping load on electrolyzer stack tie bolts since the dome pressure acting axially inward helps offset the outward axial forces from the stack gas pressure. Likewise, radial and circumferential stresses on electrolyzer frames are minimized. Because the dome is operated at a higher pressure than the electrolyzer product gas, any external electrolyzer leak prevents oxygen or hydrogen from leaking into the dome. Instead the affected stack gas stream pressure rises detectably, thereby enabling a system shutdown. All electrical and fluid connections to the stack are made inside the pressure dome and require special plumbing and electrical dome interfaces {{for this to be}} accomplished. Further benefits of the dome are that it can act as a containment shield in the unlikely event of a catastrophic failure. Studies indicate that, for a given active area (and hence, cell ID), frame outside diameter must become ever larger to support stresses at higher operating pressures. This can lead to a large footprint and increased costs associated with thicker and/or larger diameter end-plates, tie-rods, and the frames themselves. One solution is to employ rings that fit snugly around the frame. This complicates stack assembly and is sometimes difficult to achieve in practice, as its success is strongly dependent on frame and ring tolerances, gas pressure, and operating temperature. A pressure dome permits an otherwise low-pressure stack to operate at higher pressures without growing the electrolyzer hardware. The pressure dome consists of two machined segments. An O-ring is placed in an O-ring groove in the flange of the bottom segment and is trapped by the flange on the top dome segment when these components are bolted together with high-strength bolts. The pressure dome has several unique features. It is made (to ASME Pressure Vessel guidelines) in a high-strength aluminum alloy with the strength of stainless steel and the weight benefits of aluminum. The flange of the upper dome portion contains specially machined flats for mounting the dome, and other flats dedicated to the special feedthroughs for electrical connections. A pressure dome can be increased in length to house larger stacks (more cells) of the same diameter with the simple addition of a cylindrical segment. To aid in dome assembly, two stainless steel rings are employed. One is used beneath the heads of the high-strength bolts in lieu of individual <b>hardened</b> <b>washers,</b> and another is used instead of individual nuts. Like electrolyzers could be operated at low or high pressures simply by operating the electrolyzer outside or inside a pressurized dome...|$|R
