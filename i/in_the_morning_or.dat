25|$|The {{original}} zone {{covered by}} the London Congestion Charge was about eight square miles, Singapore two square miles and Stockholm 18 square miles, but the scheme differed from London in that charges would have been lower and the charging hours much shorter. Inbound charges would have applied between 7:00am and 9:30am, outbound ones between 4:00pm and 6:30pm. There was to be no charge {{during the middle of}} the day, later in the evening, at the weekend or for journeys against the peak flow: leaving the city <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>or</b> entering it in the evening.|$|E

The block aired on Sunday mornings and weekdays (either <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mornings</b> <b>or</b> afternoons).|$|R
25|$|The {{classical}} rabbis {{themselves were}} at times not free from {{sharing in the}} popular beliefs. Thus, {{while there is a}} whole catalog of prognostications by means of Dreams in Ber. 55 et seq., and Rabbi Johanan claimed that those dreams are true which come <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>or</b> are dreamed about us by others, or are repeated, Rabbi Meïr declares that dreams help not and injure not. Dream interpretation is not however a factor in considering mythologyfication of Talmud knowledge since it was at the time a part of the wider nascent development of what later became the discipline of Psychology, and also incorporated Astrology, and effect of digestion on behaviour.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} {{those who have}} DSPD seek medical help, they usually have tried many times to change their {{sleeping}} schedule. Failed tactics to sleep at earlier times may include maintaining proper sleep hygiene, relaxation techniques, early bedtimes, hypnosis, alcohol, sleeping pills, dull reading, and home remedies. DSPD patients who have tried using sedatives at night often report that the medication makes them feel tired or relaxed, but that it fails to induce sleep. They often have asked family members to help wake them <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>or</b> they have used multiple alarm clocks. As the disorder occurs in childhood and is most common in adolescence, it is often the patient's parents who initiate seeking help, after great difficulty waking their child in time for school.|$|E
25|$|In 1877 the Board of Trade made a Provisional Order, {{known as}} the Nottingham and District Tramways Order, and Royal Assent was {{received}} on 23 July 1877. The company was authorised to operate animal-drawn trams only, in the borough of Nottingham {{and also in the}} districts of Lenton, Basford and Radford. These districts {{were not included in the}} Borough of Nottingham until the Extension Act of 1877. The Tramways Orders Confirmation Act of 1877 also specified the minimum levels of service that the company was required to operate: to run carriages each way every morning in the week and every evening in the week (Sundays, Christmas Day and Good Friday always excepted), at such house, not being later than seven <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>or</b> earlier than six in the evening respectively.|$|E

25|$|At the time, Owen Field did {{not have}} {{permanent}} artificial lighting sufficient for television broadcasts at night. This meant that untelevised home games had to start <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>or</b> early afternoon {{so as to be}} completed by dark, because the cost of leasing a set of portable lights was too high for a game that would not earn enough revenue to pay for those lights. For all televised games, portable lights on trucks were rented – but the leasing costs cut into the university's revenue, and often the four or five portable light trucks stayed on campus for weeks in anticipation of the next televised game. True night games were difficult to play in Norman because of the amount of portable lighting needed to illuminate the field adequately for spectators to see the players, much less the light required for television. Prior to 1982, the university knew which games would be televised and could plan months ahead for leasing the necessary lighting.|$|E

500|$|Syringomyelia (SM) is a {{condition}} affecting the brain and spine, causing symptoms ranging from mild discomfort to severe pain and partial paralysis. It {{is caused by a}} malformation, commonly known as Chiari Malformation, in the lower back of the skull which reduces the space available to the brain, compressing it and often forcing it out (herniating it) through the opening into the spinal cord. This blocks the flow of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) around the brain and spine and increases the fluid's pressure, creating turbulence which in turn is believed to create fluid pockets, or syrinxes (hence the term syringomyelia), in the spinal cord. Syringomyelia is rare in most breeds but has become widespread in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, with international research samples {{in the past few years}} consistently showing over 90% of Cavaliers have the malformation, and that between 30–70% have syrinxes. However, most dogs with syrinxes are not symptomatic. [...] Although symptoms of syringomyelia can present at any age, they typically appear between six months and four years of age in 85% of symptomatic dogs, according to Clare Rusbridge, a research scientist. Symptoms include sensitivity around the head, neck, or shoulders, often indicated by a dog whimpering or frequently scratching at the area of his neck or shoulder. [...] Scratching is often unilateral– restricted to one side of the body. [...] Scratching motions are frequently performed without actually making physical contact with the body ("air scratching"). [...] The scratching behavior appears involuntary and the dog frequently scratches while walking– without stopping– in a way that is very atypical of normal scratching ("bunny hopping"). [...] Scratching typical of SM is usually worse when the dog is wearing a collar, is being walked on leash, or is excited, and first thing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>or</b> at night.|$|E

50|$|The {{project was}} criticized {{on the basis}} of costs. One member {{suggested}} that children studying at the elementary level should continue to work <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fields, receiving education <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mornings</b> <b>or</b> evenings.Others felt <b>the</b> education should be limited to farmer-proprietors, since they alone would cause progress to be made in agriculture in France. Amable Dubois felt that there were no qualified teachers, and that the peasants would resist any form of theoretical instruction.The royalists were the most hostile to the project of educating the workers.|$|R

2500|$|Citalopram is {{typically}} taken in one dose, either <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>or</b> evening. It {{can be taken}} with or without food. Its absorption does not increase when taken with food, but doing so can help prevent nausea. [...] Nausea is often caused when the 5HT3 receptors actively absorb free serotonin, as this receptor is present within the digestive tract. The 5HT3 receptors stimulate vomiting. This side effect, if present, should subside as the body adjusts to the medication.|$|E
