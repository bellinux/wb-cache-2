500|$|On 27 May 1940 a Home Defence Executive {{was formed}} under General Sir Edmund Ironside, Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, to organise the defence of Britain. At first defence {{arrangements}} were largely static {{and focused on}} the coastline (the coastal crust) and, in a classic example of defence in depth, on a series of inland anti-tank 'stop' lines. The [...] were designated Command, Corp and Divisional according to their status. The longest and most heavily fortified was the General Headquarters anti-tank line, GHQ Line, which ran across southern England, wrapped around London and then ran north to Yorkshire. It was intended to protect the capital and the industrial heartland of England. Another major line was the Taunton Stop Line, which defended against an advance from England's south-west peninsula. London and other major cities were ringed with inner and outer stop lines. Some 50 known stop lines were constructed in Britain, though some of the less important lines were just <b>demolition</b> <b>belts</b> and not all lines were completed.|$|R
2500|$|After WrestleMania V, Demolition {{started a}} feud with The Twin Towers (Akeem and The Big Bossman) {{and then a}} feud with the Brain Busters (Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard), who were managed by Bobby [...] "The Brain" [...] Heenan. On the May 27, 1989 edition of Saturday Night's Main Event, the Brain Busters {{defeated}} Demolition by disqualification. [...] They finally dropped the titles to the Brain Busters in a {{two out of three}} falls match on the July 29 edition of Saturday Night's Main Event following outside interference from André the Giant with a chair. As well as looking to regain the <b>belts,</b> <b>Demolition</b> sought revenge on André and closure on The Twin Towers. At SummerSlam 1989, King Duggan and Demolition defeated André and the Towers in a six-man tag team match (already advertised prior to the title change) where Darsow showcased his strength by body slamming both of the Twin Towers. Demolition focused on regaining the tag titles and restarted their feud with the Brain Busters. On the November 4 edition of Superstars (taped on October 2), Demolition defeated the Brain Busters to regain their tag titles and win their second WWF Tag Team Championship.|$|R
