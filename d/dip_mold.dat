50|$|DOTP is {{a general}} purpose {{plasticizer}} that is considered safer than ortho-phthalate plasticizers due to its excellent toxicological profile. The terephthalates exhibit none of the peroxisome proliferation of liver enzymes that some ortho-phthalates have shown in several studies. It has uses in applications like extrusion, calendering, injection <b>molding,</b> rotational <b>molding,</b> <b>dip</b> <b>molding,</b> slush molding and coating.|$|R
50|$|In {{plastics}} processing, <b>dip</b> <b>molding</b> is {{a process}} of shaping of plastics by moulding. The coating of components with PVC has many applications. Plastic dip moulding is a technique where metal parts are coated with a plastic vinyl material. It is used to protect and make the metal parts more resistant to scratches and abrasions.|$|R
50|$|Southern bayberry's fruits are a {{traditional}} {{source of the}} wax for those old-fashioned Christmas decorations called bayberry candles. The wax was extracted by boiling the berries, and skimming off the floating hydrocarbons. The fats were then boiled again and then strained. After that the liquid was usable in candle making, whether through <b>dipping</b> or <b>molding.</b> Southern bayberry {{is not the only}} plant usable for making bayberry candles, however.

50|$|For many decades, rubber condoms were {{manufactured}} by wrapping strips of raw rubber around penis-shaped <b>molds,</b> then <b>dipping</b> the wrapped <b>molds</b> in a chemical solution {{to cure the}} rubber. In 1912, Polish inventor Julius Fromm developed a new, improved manufacturing technique for condoms: <b>dipping</b> glass <b>molds</b> into a raw rubber solution. Called cement dipping, this method required adding gasoline or benzene to the rubber to make it liquid. Latex, rubber suspended in water, was invented in 1920. Latex condoms required less labor to produce than cement-dipped rubber condoms, {{which had to be}} smoothed by rubbing and trimming. The use of water to suspend the rubber instead of gasoline and benzene eliminated the fire hazard previously associated with all condom factories. Latex condoms also performed better for the consumer: they were stronger and thinner than rubber condoms, and had a shelf life of five years (compared to three months for rubber).|$|R
50|$|Before the {{mechanization}} of papermaking, the laid {{pattern was}} produced by the wire sieve in the rectangular mold used to produce single sheets of paper. A worker would <b>dip</b> the <b>mold</b> into a vat containing diluted linen pulp, then lift it out, tilt it to spread the pulp evenly over the sieve, and, as the water drained out between the wires, shake the mold to lock the fibers together. In the process, {{the pattern of the}} wires in the sieve was imparted to the sheet of paper.|$|R
40|$|Three-dimensional {{graphene}} foam (3 D GrF) is an interconnected, {{porous structure}} of graphene sheets with excellent mechanical, electrical and thermal properties, {{making it a}} candidate reinforcement for polymer matrices. GrF’s 3 D structure eliminates nanoparticle agglomeration and provides seamless pathways for electron travel. The objective of this work is to fabricate low density GrF reinforced epoxy composites with superior mechanical and electrical properties and study the underlying deformation mechanisms. <b>Dip</b> coating and <b>mold</b> casting fabrication methods are employed in order to tailor the microstructure and properties. The composite’s microstructure revealed good interfacial interaction. By adding mere 0. 63 wt. % GrF, flexural strength was improved by 56 %. The addition of 2 wt. % GrF showed a surge in glass transition temperature (56 oC), improvement in damping behavior (150 %), and electrical conductivity 11 orders of magnitude higher than pure epoxy. <b>Dip</b> coated and <b>mold</b> casted composites showed a gauge factor of ~ 2. 4 indicating electromechanically robust composite materials...|$|R
40|$|Quality {{problems}} in continuous {{casting of steel}} can be identified as they occur by monitoring mold signals (level sensor, thermocouples in the mold walls, friction etc.) and taking appropriate action (such as slowing casting speed, changing taper, changing a clogged nozzle, or later visual inspection of the surface for possible downgrading. Surface depressions and groups of deep oscillation marks form at meniscus and reduce local heat transfer as they move down the mold at the casting speed. This slows shell growth, increases shell surface temperature, and causes characteristic <b>dips</b> in <b>mold</b> thermocouple signals. More importantly, they are also associated with longitudinal cracks. Characteristic thermocouple signatures have been identified for many defects, including sticker breakouts, transverse depressions and deep oscillation marks, narrow-face bleeds, transverse corner cracks, longitudinal cracks, mold level fluctuation defects, and other problems. With the help of computational models, these mold signals {{should be used to}} troubleshoot defects, and to take appropriate corrective action...|$|R

Called cement dipping, this method required adding gasoline or benzene to the rubber to make it liquid. [...] In America, Schmid was the first company to use the new technique. Using the new dipping method, French condom manufacturers were the first to add textures to condoms. [...] Fromm was the first company to sell a branded line of condoms, Fromm's Act, which remains popular Germany today. [...] The condom lines manufactured by Schmid, Shieks and Ramses, were sold through the late 1990s.

40|$|Objective(s) : Tissue {{engineering}} {{represents a}} new approach to solve the current complications of the heart valve replacements by offering viable valve prosthesis with growth and remodeling capability. In this project, electrospinning and dip coating techniques were used to fabricate heart valve constructs from medical grade polyurethane (PU). Methods: First, a mold of tricuspid valve was dip coated in a PU solution, except for its valvular parts. Then, PU nanofibers were electrospun on the <b>dip</b> coated <b>mold</b> to form the valves.   The morphology and diameter of nanofibers were investigated by SEM and contact angle measurements were done to evaluate the wettability of scaffolds. Thereafter, a tensile tester machine was used to assess mechanical properties of nanofibrous scaffolds. Then, the HUVEC cell line was cultured on the surface of scaffolds. Results: The SEM images showed the proper nanofibrous structure of the prepared scaffolds. Also, the obtained structure demonstrated appropriate tensile properties. Based on direct and indirect MTT, DAPI staining and SEM results, nanofibers were biocompatible and cells attached {{to the surface of the}} scaffolds, properly. Conclusions: This study demonstrated polyurethane-based nanofibrous scaffolds for engineering artificial heart valve.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{demonstrate}} that the asymmetric membrane capsule can be used to deliver apoorly water soluble drug with a pH sensitive solubility such as gliclazide. In order to obtain the desireddelivery duration, the drug was solubilized with the use of a pH-controlling excipient. The capsule wallmembrane was made by a phase inversion process, in which asymmetric membrane was formed on glassmold pins by <b>dipping</b> the <b>mold</b> pins into a coating solution containing a polymeric material followed bydipping into a quench solution. This study evaluates the influence of coating formulation that wascellulose acetate (CA), ethyl cellulose (EC), and plasticizer (glycerin and PEG 600). Results showcapsule that made by CA with glycerol and PEG 600 (F 8), which appear in asymmetric structure and areable to release gliclazide(GLZ) in significant percentage. Results show that sodium bicarbonate and Dmannitolis able to promote the release of GLZ from polymeric capsules prepared with CA withasymmetrical membrane. The addition of solubilizer, sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) could enhance therelease of GLZ by micelle formation of GLZ. Based on these results, influence of core formulationvariables, including D-mannitol, sodium bicarbonate and the added amount of SLS were examined onthe release of GLZ. It was found that HPMC 15 cp was suitable to be a thickening agent and both addedamount of HPMC and SLS showed a comparable and profoundly positive effect. In vitro release studiesfor all the prepared formulations were done (n= 3). Statistical test (Dunnett’s multiple comparison test) was applied for in vitro drug release at P> 0. 05. The best formulation closely corresponded to themarketed formulation by a similarity (f 2) value of 78. 36 and difference (f 1) value of 4. 49.
