25|$|Following a long {{international}} break, Lyon faced Lorient at home, {{their first}} and only back-to-back home league match set. In the match, which was fairly <b>even</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the statistics, Lyon controlled possession for 57 percent of the match, but did not score a goal until the 72nd following a perfect cross from Sidney Govou into the box, which landed {{at the head of}} Michel Bastos and then {{into the back of the}} net. Lyon maintained the 1–0 lead to win the match moving the club into a tie for second place with title rivals Bordeaux. The following week, Lyon faced rivals Paris Saint-Germain at the Parc des Princes in a match that saw a Lyon side missing several key players. In the 29th minute, the Parisians got a well-deserved goal from former Lyon player Ludovic Giuly. Despite the home side maintaining their attack well into the second half, their first half goal was canceled out following an Aly Cissokho cross into the box that saw Bafétimbi Gomis get a slight touch on the ball to get it past Grégory Coupet. The goal secured a point for Lyon and also allowed the club to maintain their top 2 position in the table. Lyon contested up-and-comers Toulouse the following match day. Lyon defense was again the first to concede allowing a goal from youngster Moussa Sissoko in just the eighth minute. Despite conceding early, however, Lyon's attack was extremely uptempo, which allowed the away side to break into numerous counterattacks. Lyon's attack finally paid off, in the 52nd minute following a goal from Yannis Tafer, which was his first professional goal. Tafer, who came on as a half-time substitute, secured the goal following a cross into the box by the dangerous Cissokho. The French youth international ran near post and got a shot off high into the visiting net. With Lyon's confidence high, their attack increased, which led to numerous chances. Eventually, Lyon got a goal from Gomis, his second in two matches to give the club a 2–1 victory. The following week, Lyon reached top of the table for the first time this season, courtesy of a 2–0 win over Lens. Despite enduring a hostile crowd and constant pressure from Lens, Lyon and their defense stood tall with Govou and Kim Källström getting both goals in the seventh and 78th minute, respectively.|$|E
500|$|Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire were {{developed}} by Game Freak and Nintendo {{under the direction of}} Junichi Masuda. As with its predecessors, Ken Sugimori was the art director, although these were the first games in which he did not single-handedly produce all of the art. When asked where his design team came up with the ideas for all of the new Pokémon, Sugimori stated that they got their ideas from past experiences in their childhood involving nature, animals, and the media and then base them on insects. <b>Even</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the world in a different perspective sometimes provided inspiration for the creatures. [...] "First we select an insect and after that we add essential elements to the insects to make it more like Pokemon, such as adding some hard shape to it, to be more like steel," [...] Sugimori said, describing the process of creating a Pokémon.|$|E
500|$|Accompanied by her adviser, Neto, Manasa {{descended to}} earth to see human devotees. She was {{initially}} mocked {{by the people}} but then Manasa forced them to worship her by raining calamity on those who denied her power. She managed to convert people from different walks of life, including the Muslim ruler Hasan, but failed to convert Chand Sadagar [...] Manasa {{wanted to become a}} goddess like Lakshmi or Saraswati. To get there she had to achieve the worship of Chand Sadagar who was extremely adamant and took oath not to worship Manasa. Thus to gain his fear and insecurity, Manasa one by one killed his six sons [...] At last Manasa conspired against two dancers of Indras Court who loved each other, Anirudha and Usha [...] Anirudh had to take birth as Lakhinder, Chand and Sanaka's seventh son. Usha took birth as behula and married him. Manasa killed him but Behula floated on water for nine months with the dead body of her husband and finally brought back the lives of the seven sons and the lost prosperity of Chand. At last, he yielded by offering a flower to the goddess with his left hand without <b>even</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> her. This gesture made Manasa so happy that she resurrected all of Chand's sons and restored his fame and fortunes. The Mangal kavyas say that after this, the worship of Manasa was popular forever.|$|E

500|$|Very {{was known}} as an eccentric, prone to odd {{behavior}} and may have suffered from bipolar disorder. The first signs of a breakdown came shortly after meeting Emerson, as Very was completing an essay on William Shakespeare. As Very later explained, [...] "I felt within me a new will... {{it was not a}} feeling of my own but a sensible will that was not my own... These two consciousnesses, as I may call them, continued with me". In August 1837, while traveling by train, he was suddenly overcome with terror at its speed until he realized he was being [...] "borne along by a divine engine and undertaking his life-journey". As he told Henry Ware Jr., professor of pulpit eloquence and pastoral care at Harvard Divinity School, divine inspiration helped him suddenly understand the twenty-fourth chapter of the Gospel of Matthew and that Christ was having his Second Coming within him. When Ware did not believe him, Very said, [...] "I had thought you did the will of the Father, and that I should receive some sympathy from you—But I now find that you are doing your own will, and not the will of your father". Very also claimed that he was {{under the influence of the}} Holy Spirit and composed verse while in this state. Emerson did not believe Very's claim and, noting the poor writing, he asked, [...] "cannot the spirit parse & spell?" [...] Very said he was also tormented by strong sexual desires which he believed were only held in check by the will of God. To help control himself, he avoided speaking with or <b>even</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> women—he called it his [...] "sacrifice of Beauty".|$|E
2500|$|One Ajah, the Red, {{is devoted}} to hunting down any and all male channelers and {{stripping}} them of their abilities (known as gentling). Removing a female's ability to access the One Power is known as stilling. The greatest form of White Tower punishment, Aes Sedai avoid <b>even</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the stilled as the mere idea of being separated from the One Power (the source of their elite status, {{as well as the}} experience of channeling) is so distasteful. Those who have been stilled, gentled or [...] "burned out" [...] experience deep depression and most often eventually die, wasting away in apathy.|$|E
2500|$|Lowry {{was born}} on 1 November 1887 at 8 Barrett Street, Stretford, which was then in Lancashire. It was a {{difficult}} birth, and his mother Elizabeth, who hoped for a girl, was uncomfortable <b>even</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> him at first. Later she expressed envy of her sister Mary, who had [...] "three splendid daughters" [...] instead of one [...] "clumsy boy". Lowry's father Robert, who was of northern Irish descent, worked as a clerk for the Jacob Earnshaw and Son Property Company and was a withdrawn and introverted man. Lowry once described him as [...] "a cold fish" [...] and [...] "(the sort of man who) realised he had a life to live and {{did his best to}} get through it." ...|$|E
