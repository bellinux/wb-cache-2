5000|$|The weather {{remained}} dry {{and warm}} for the Saturday morning practice sessions. Michael Schumacher again set the fastest {{time for the}} third session, a 1:37.176, quicker than his best on Friday. The Williams drivers were running quicker; Ralf Schumacher in second and Button in fourth. They were separated by Coulthard. Fisichella set the fifth quickest time, ahead of Villeneuve, who spun into the gravel late in the session. Barrichello, Irvine, Johnny Herbert and de la Rosa completed the top ten. In the final practice session, Häkkinen set the quickest time, a 1:37.037, one-tenth of a second faster than Michael Schumacher. Button was happy {{with the performance of}} his car and was third fastest. Barrichello maintained his consistent performance and set the fourth fastest time despite again spinning into the gravel traps. He was ahead of Ralf Schumacher who had his fastest time revoked after exceeding track limits. Coulthard was sixth, two-tenths of a second faster than Fisichella. Irvine, Alexander Wurz and Villeneuve completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Pole position provides the best opportunity to win the race. That has been our target all weekend, but the job is not finished yet. Obviously this is the best start and we have a good car to get the job done. I only did nine laps because I felt the track was not in the best condition early in the session and I did not see the point in wasting a set of tyres. The team did a good job to get me out at the right time. Today we had a very high quality fight for pole. I knew it would be tight and <b>either</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> could have been on pole. Michael Schumacher, commenting on taking pole position. Saturday's afternoon qualifying session lasted for an hour. Each driver was limited to twelve laps, with the starting order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver set a time within 107% of the quickest lap to qualify for the race. The session was held in dry weather conditions. Michael Schumacher clinched his eighth pole position of the season, his fifth at the circuit, in a time of 1:35.825. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Häkkinen, who was nine thousands of a second slower than his championship rival and battled him for grid position throughout the session. Häkkinen's teammate Coulthard qualified third, and conceded that he was not quick enough to challenge for pole position. The two Williams drivers qualified on the third row of the grid; Button ahead of Ralf Schumacher although both drivers had mixed feelings over their performance. Both Jaguar drivers took seventh and tenth and were satisifed with their pace. Frentzen reported that his car was difficult to handle but was happy to manage an qualifying position of eighth. Villeneuve took ninth despite suffering from excessive oversteer and was unable to improve his time because he changed his car in the opposite direction. Herbert who rounded out the top ten felt he could have qualified on the fourth row despite changes to his set-up. Wurz qualified eleventh and missed on qualifying in the top ten by nearly two thousands of a second. His teammate Fisichella started from twelfth position and reported his car lost performance after the morning practice sessions. Both Arrows drivers filled the seventh row of the grid-de la Rosa was faster than Verstappen-and were affected with problems on the cars limiting their running. Trulli had car handling issues and qualified 15th. Heidfeld qualified 16th, ahead of teammate Jean Alesi. Zonta had limited qualifying time because of an engine change and managed 18th overall. [...] The tenth row of the grid was filled by both Sauber drivers; Mika Salo in front of Pedro Diniz. Salo used the spare Sauber because his race car had alternator issues. Both of Diniz's two fastest qualifying times were disallowed because of him laying oil on the circuit in the morning practice sessions. The two Minardi drivers qualified {{at the rear of the}} grid with Marc Gené ahead of Gastón Mazzacane.|$|E

Josh is the Director of United Way Care for Elders, an {{initiative}} of United Way of Greater Houston that is a collaborative of aging service providers. One avenue of our collaboration has been a program called Financial Coaching at Family Services of Greater Houston. In aggregate we have run the program since 2007 – Josh from 2007 {{until the end of}} 2010, and Richard since that time. Financial Coaching and the more traditional Financial Education {{have been a part of}} a suite of economic programs at Family Houston, which has included a car loan program for working parents with poor credit, a (healthy) alternative to a payday loan product, and employment services. Financial Coaching and Education are also part of a larger community collaborative, United Way THRIVE, which is a coalition of 20 organizations focused on family financial stability in everything from job training to a full-service credit union and tax preparation services. Financial Coaching is financial education personalized and stretched out over six months to a year or longer. It is a best practice program that helps clients set a budget, reduce debt, save for their goals, and accomplish amazing things like home ownership or launching a small business. Also, because every decision and every relationship in life can have a financial component, Financial Coaching has the potential to touch on aspects of counseling, case management, family reunification, and many other elements of family function/dysfunction.

40|$|This {{article is}} an attempt to {{reconstruct}} and analyze the process of conducting a collaborative, interpretive study of the experience of Hurricane Andrew. Study data consist of accounts, including in-depth and focus-group interviews, collected in the months following the storm. The current inquiry addresses validity, with a focus on the impact of the investigators ’ biographies and theoretical orientations on the collection and analysis of qualitative data. We found that our interviews differed in terms of style, level of detail sought, and the degree of taken-for-granted knowledge shared by interviewer and respondent. In analysis, we found different aspects of the data interesting and, initially, produced different stories. These proved to be complementary, rather than contradictory. Collaboration made it possible to identify some of the biases we brought to the task and yielded a richer interpretation of the hurricane experience than either of us would have produced alone. When Hurricane Andrew tore through southern Dade County, Florida, 250, 000 people were left homeless and everyday life was disrupted or de-stroyed for countless more. Within a few weeks, social scientists and others were in the field examining the impact of the hurricane. The focus of this article {{is an attempt}} to reconstruct and comment on the research process involved in producing an ethnography of Hurricane Andrew. The method chosen to analyze our research is a verstehen process similar to Cooley’s &dquo;sympathetic introspection,&dquo; Mills’s &dquo;sociological imagination,&dquo; and Ellis’s &dquo;systematic sociological introspection&dquo; (Ronai & Ellis, 1989). Despite rather different research backgrounds and interests, the two of us joined forces to do an interpretive study of the experience of Hurricane Andrew (Smith & Belgrave, 1993, 1994). <b>Either</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> could have done such a sturdy.
