25|$|Neither scheme {{should be}} {{confused}} with encryption or encipherment; scrambling and spreading with LFSRs do not protect the information from eavesdropping. They are instead used to produce equivalent streams that possess convenient engineering properties to allow robust and efficient modulation and <b>demodulation.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{two-dimensional}} smart detector array, fabricated using a 2µm complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) process, {{was used}} to demonstrate full-field TD-OCT. Featuring an uncomplicated optical setup (Fig. 3), each pixel of the 58x58 pixel smart detector array acted as an individual photodiode and included its own hardware <b>demodulation</b> circuitry.|$|E
25|$|Some {{otherwise}} conventional tubes do {{not fall}} into standard categories; the 6AR8, 6JH8 and 6ME8 had several common grids, followed {{by a pair of}} beam deflection electrodes which deflected the current towards either of two anodes. It was sometimes known as the 'sheet beam' tube, and was used in some color TV sets for color <b>demodulation.</b> The similar 7360 was popular as a balanced SSB (de)modulator.|$|E
25|$|Rectifiers {{are also}} used for {{detection}} of amplitude modulated radio signals. The signal may be amplified before detection. If not, a very low voltage drop diode or a diode biased with a fixed voltage must be used. When using a rectifier for <b>demodulation</b> the capacitor and load resistance must be carefully matched: too low a capacitance makes the high frequency carrier pass to the output, and too high makes the capacitor just charge and stay charged.|$|E
25|$|An FM signal {{can also}} be used to carry a stereo signal; this is done with {{multiplexing}} and demultiplexing before and after the FM process. The FM modulation and <b>demodulation</b> process is identical in stereo and monaural processes. A high-efficiency radio-frequency switching amplifier can be used to transmit FM signals (and other constant-amplitude signals). For a given signal strength (measured at the receiver antenna), switching amplifiers use less battery power and typically cost less than a linear amplifier. This gives FM another advantage over other modulation methods requiring linear amplifiers, such as AM and QAM.|$|E
25|$|Signal {{processing}} {{deals with}} the analysis and manipulation of signals. Signals can be either analog, {{in which case the}} signal varies continuously according to the information, or digital, in which case the signal varies according to a series of discrete values representing the information. For analog signals, signal processing may involve the amplification and filtering of audio signals for audio equipment or the modulation and <b>demodulation</b> of signals for telecommunications. For digital signals, signal processing may involve the compression, error detection and error correction of digitally sampled signals.|$|E
25|$|The {{first use}} for the diode was the <b>demodulation</b> of {{amplitude}} modulated (AM) radio broadcasts. The history of this discovery is treated in depth in the radio article. In summary, an AM signal consists of alternating positive and negative peaks of a radio carrier wave, whose amplitude or envelope {{is proportional to the}} original audio signal. The diode (originally a crystal diode) rectifies the AM radio frequency signal, leaving only the positive peaks of the carrier wave. The audio is then extracted from the rectified carrier wave using a simple filter and fed into an audio amplifier or transducer, which generates sound waves.|$|E
25|$|These FM {{systems are}} unusual, {{in that they}} have a ratio of carrier to maximum {{modulation}} frequency of less than two; contrast this with FM audio broadcasting, where the ratio is around 10,000. Consider, for example, a 6-MHz carrier modulated at a 3.5-MHz rate; by Bessel analysis, the first sidebands are on 9.5 and 2.5MHz and the second sidebands are on 13MHz and −1MHz. The result is a reversed-phase sideband on +1MHz; on <b>demodulation,</b> this results in unwanted output at 6−1 = 5MHz. The system must be designed so that this unwanted output is reduced to an acceptable level.|$|E
25|$|The {{received}} {{signal is}} now processed by the demodulator stage where the audio signal (or other baseband signal) is recovered and then further amplified. AM <b>demodulation</b> requires the simple rectification of the RF signal (so-called envelope detection), {{and a simple}} RC low pass filter to remove remnants of the intermediate frequency. FM signals may be detected using a discriminator, ratio detector, or phase-locked loop. Continuous wave (Morse code) and single sideband signals require a product detector using a so-called beat frequency oscillator, {{and there are other}} techniques used for different types of modulation. The resulting audio signal (for instance) is then amplified and drives a loudspeaker.|$|E
25|$|The cyclic prefix, {{which is}} {{transmitted}} during the guard interval, {{consists of the}} end of the OFDM symbol copied into the guard interval, and the guard interval is transmitted followed by the OFDM symbol. The reason that the guard interval consists of a copy {{of the end of}} the OFDM symbol is so that the receiver will integrate over an integer number of sinusoid cycles for each of the multipaths when it performs OFDM <b>demodulation</b> with the FFT. In some standards such as Ultrawideband, in the interest of transmitted power, cyclic prefix is skipped and nothing is sent during the guard interval. The receiver will then have to mimic the cyclic prefix functionality by copying the end part of the OFDM symbol and adding it to the beginning portion.|$|E
25|$|Condenser {{microphones}} {{span the}} range from telephone transmitters through inexpensive karaoke microphones to high-fidelity recording microphones. They generally produce a high-quality audio signal {{and are now}} the popular choice in laboratory and recording studio applications. The inherent suitability of this technology {{is due to the}} very small mass that must be moved by the incident sound wave, unlike other microphone types that require the sound wave to do more work. They require a power source, provided either via microphone inputs on equipment as phantom power or from a small battery. Power is necessary for establishing the capacitor plate voltage, and is also needed to power the microphone electronics (impedance conversion in the case of electret and DC-polarized microphones, <b>demodulation</b> or detection in the case of RF/HF microphones). Condenser microphones are also available with two diaphragms that can be electrically connected to provide a range of polar patterns (see below), such as cardioid, omnidirectional, and figure-eight. It is also possible to vary the pattern continuously with some microphones, for example the Røde NT2000 or CAD M179.|$|E
2500|$|The {{simplest}} form of AM demodulator {{consists of}} a diode which is configured to act as envelope detector. [...] Another type of demodulator, the product detector, can provide better-quality <b>demodulation</b> with additional circuit complexity.|$|E
2500|$|Coherent <b>demodulation</b> of [...] {{to recover}} [...] {{is the same}} as AM: {{multiply}} by [...] and lowpass to remove the [...] "double-frequency" [...] components around frequency [...] [...] If the demodulating carrier is not in the correct phase (cosine phase here), then the demodulated signal will be some linear combination of [...] and , which is usually acceptable in voice communications (if the <b>demodulation</b> carrier frequency is not quite right, the phase will be drifting cyclically, which again is usually acceptable in voice communications if the frequency error is small enough, and amateur radio operators are sometimes tolerant of even larger frequency errors that cause unnatural-sounding pitch shifting effects).|$|E
2500|$|As {{electronic}} engineering advanced, notably during World War II, {{this function}} of a diode came to be considered as one type of <b>demodulation.</b> While firmly established by history, the term [...] "detector" [...] is not of itself descriptive, and should be considered outdated.|$|E
2500|$|In {{electronics}} and telecommunications, modulation means varying {{some aspect of}} a higher frequency continuous wave carrier signal with an information-bearing modulation waveform, such as an audio signal which represents sound, or a video signal which represents images, so the carrier will [...] "carry" [...] the information. [...] When it reaches its destination, the information signal is extracted from the modulated carrier by <b>demodulation.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Keeping {{the input}} and output phase in lock step also implies keeping the {{input and output}} {{frequencies}} the same. Consequently, in addition to synchronizing signals, a phase-locked loop can track an input frequency, or it can generate a frequency that is a multiple of the input frequency. [...] These properties are used for computer clock synchronization, <b>demodulation,</b> and frequency synthesis.|$|E
2500|$|Phase-locked loops {{are widely}} used for {{synchronization}} purposes; in space communications for coherent <b>demodulation</b> and threshold extension, bit synchronization, and symbol synchronization. Phase-locked loops {{can also be used}} to demodulate frequency-modulated signals. [...] In radio transmitters, a PLL is used to synthesize new frequencies which are a multiple of a reference frequency, with the same stability as the reference frequency.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{disadvantage}} of AM {{is that it}} is inefficient in power usage; at least two-thirds of the power is concentrated in the carrier signal. [...] The carrier signal contains none of the original information being transmitted (voice, video, data, etc.). [...] However its presence provides a simple means of <b>demodulation</b> using envelope detection, providing a frequency and phase reference to extract the modulation from the sidebands. [...] In some modulation systems based on AM, a lower transmitter power is required through partial or total elimination of the carrier component, however receivers for these signals are more complex and costly. The receiver may regenerate a copy of the carrier frequency (usually as shifted to the intermediate frequency) from a greatly reduced [...] "pilot" [...] carrier (in reduced-carrier transmission or DSB-RC) to use in the <b>demodulation</b> process. Even with the carrier totally eliminated in double-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission, carrier regeneration is possible using a Costas phase-locked loop. This doesn't work however for single-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission (SSB-SC), leading to the characteristic [...] "Donald Duck" [...] sound from such receivers when slightly detuned. Single sideband is nevertheless used widely in amateur radio and other voice communications both due to its power efficiency and bandwidth efficiency (cutting the RF bandwidth in half compared to standard AM). On the other hand, in medium wave and short wave broadcasting, standard AM with the full carrier allows for reception using inexpensive receivers. The broadcaster absorbs the extra power cost to greatly increase potential audience.|$|E
2500|$|In deeper water, Stokes {{waves are}} unstable. [...] This was shown by T. Brooke Benjamin and Jim E. Feir in 1967. The Benjamin–Feir {{instability}} is a side-band or modulational instability, with the side-band modulations propagating {{in the same}} direction as the carrier wave; waves become unstable on deeper water for a relative depth [...] (with k the wavenumber and h the mean water depth). The Benjamin–Feir instability can be described with the non-linear Schrödinger equation, by inserting a Stokes wave with side bands. Subsequently, with a more refined analysis, it has been shown – theoretically and experimentally – that the Stokes wave and its side bands exhibit Fermi–Pasta–Ulam–Tsingou recurrence: a cyclic alternation between modulation and <b>demodulation.</b>|$|E
2500|$|One {{disadvantage}} of all amplitude modulation techniques (not only standard AM) {{is that the}} receiver amplifies and detects noise and electromagnetic interference in equal proportion to the signal. Increasing the received signal-to-noise ratio, say, {{by a factor of}} 10 (a 10 decibel improvement), thus would require increasing the transmitter power by a factor of 10. This is in contrast to [...] frequency modulation (FM) and digital radio where the effect of such noise following <b>demodulation</b> is strongly reduced so long as the received signal is well above the threshold for reception. For this reason AM broadcast is not favored for music and high fidelity broadcasting, but rather for voice communications and broadcasts (sports, news, talk radio etc.).|$|E

To extract the near-field signal, , originating from the [...] "hot-spot" [...] below the tip apex (which carries the nanoscale-resolved information about the sample properties) a small harmonic modulation of the tip height H (i.e. oscillating the tip) with frequency Ω is provided and the detector signal is demodulated at higher harmonics of this frequency nΩ with n=1,2,3,4,... The background is nearly insensitive to small variations of the tip height and is nearly completely eliminated for sufficiently high <b>demodulation</b> orders (typically [...] ). Mathematically this can be shown by expanding [...] and [...] into a Fourier series, which yields the following (approximated) expression for the demodulated detector signal: ...|$|E
2500|$|... {{receiver}} or {{interfere with}} other transmissions, the data bit sequence {{is combined with}} the output of a linear-feedback register before modulation and transmission. This scrambling is removed at the receiver after <b>demodulation.</b> When the LFSR runs at the same bit rate as the transmitted symbol stream, this technique {{is referred to as}} scrambling. When the LFSR runs considerably faster than the symbol stream, the LFSR-generated bit sequence is called chipping code. The chipping code is combined with the data using exclusive or before transmitting using binary phase-shift keying or a similar modulation method. The resulting signal has a higher bandwidth than the data, and therefore this is a method of spread-spectrum communication. When used only for the spread-spectrum property, this technique is called direct-sequence spread spectrum; when used to distinguish several signals transmitted in the same channel {{at the same time and}} frequency, it is called code division multiple access.|$|E
2500|$|RF {{condenser}} microphones use {{a comparatively}} low RF voltage, {{generated by a}} low-noise oscillator. The signal from the oscillator may either be amplitude modulated by the capacitance changes produced by the sound waves moving the capsule diaphragm, or the capsule {{may be part of}} a resonant circuit that modulates the frequency of the oscillator signal. <b>Demodulation</b> yields a low-noise audio frequency signal with a very low source impedance. The absence of a high bias voltage permits the use of a diaphragm with looser tension, which may be used to achieve wider frequency response due to higher compliance. The RF biasing process results in a lower electrical impedance capsule, a useful by-product of which is that RF condenser microphones can be operated in damp weather conditions that could create problems in DC-biased microphones with contaminated insulating surfaces. The Sennheiser [...] "MKH" [...] series of microphones use the RF biasing technique.|$|E
2500|$|The {{availability}} of both amplitude and {{phase of the}} scattered field measured in nano-FTIR allows for the recovery of both real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function, i.e. finding the index of refraction and the extinction coefficient of the sample. While such recovery for arbitrarily-shaped samples or samples exhibiting collective excitations, such as phonons, requires a resource-demanding numerical optimization, for soft matter samples (polymers, biological matter and other organic materials) {{the recovery of the}} dielectric function could often be performed in real time using fast semi-analytical approaches. One of such approaches is based on the Taylor expansion of the scattered field with respect to a small parameter that isolates the dielectric properties of the sample and allows for a polynomial representation of measured near-field contrast. With an adequate tip-sample interaction model and with known measurement parameters (e.g. tapping amplitude, <b>demodulation</b> order, reference material, etc.), the sample permittivity [...] can be determined as a solution of a simple polynomial equation ...|$|E
