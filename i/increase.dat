5|$|As {{a result}} of their warming effects when {{relatively}} thin, cirrus clouds have been implicated as a potential partial cause of global warming. Scientists have speculated that global warming could cause high thin cloud cover to <b>increase,</b> thereby increasing temperatures and humidity. This, in turn, would <b>increase</b> the cirrus cloud cover, effectively creating a positive feedback circuit. A prediction of this hypothesis is that the cirrus would move higher as the temperatures rose, increasing the volume of air underneath the clouds and the amount of infrared radiation reflected back down to earth. In addition, the hypothesis suggests that the <b>increase</b> in temperature would tend to <b>increase</b> the size of the ice crystals in the cirrus cloud, possibly causing the reflection of solar radiation and the reflection of the Earth's infrared radiation to balance out.|$|E

40|$|In {{endothermic}} vertebrates, long-term <b>increases</b> in {{metabolic energy}} demand are {{often associated with}} <b>increases</b> in food intake and accompanied by <b>increases</b> in organ mass. Wide-scale <b>increases</b> in organ mass have often been attributed to a metabolic response to <b>increased</b> energy intake and utilization.

We hypothesized that, while <b>increased</b> food intake itself {{may be responsible for}} <b>increases</b> in digestive tract mass, the consequent <b>increased</b> protein intake would be the factor responsible for <b>increased</b> kidney mass and function. Thus, we exposed male and female mice to diets differing in protein level (7 %, 15 % or 46 % casein by mass) at different acclimation temperatures (5 °C or 23 °C). Within an acclimation temperature, food intake rate remained constant over the entire range of dietary protein level, and protein intake rate <b>increased</b> as dietary content <b>increased.</b> The mice in the cold-acclimation group Summary <b>increased</b> food intake rate by 48 – 120 % over those in the warm-acclimation group.
