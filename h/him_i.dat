5|$|He {{pulled me}} in {{and pointed to}} the bed. His whole body was {{trembling}} violently. He was screaming there were two Mexicans hiding under his bed with long daggers. To humor <b>him,</b> <b>I</b> looked under the bed and when I rose to assure him there was no one hiding there, he staggered and fell, a dead weight, in my arms. I ran across the hall and called in a woman doctor, Dr. Haberski, to examine him. She pronounced him dead.|$|E
5|$|I hope I {{have not}} exaggerated {{in talking about}} Liszt; he won't make me {{anything}} wonderful, so that I can come home and set the Thames on fire—not at all, so don't expect it; but—his readings or interpretations are greater and higher than anyone else's; if I can {{spend some time with}} him and go through a good deal of music with <b>him,</b> <b>I</b> shall pick up at least a great deal of his ideas;... The two or three lessons I had of him this summer showed me what an immensity I might learn.|$|E
5|$|Globocnik and I {{were talking}} about Operation Reinhard, which was in full effect {{following}} Heydrich's murder, and also the construction of Sobibor and Treblinka. I know I asked him about Höss, who was also standing there and had been summoned by Himmler regarding logistics or something regarding the new camp (Auschwitz). Then Globocnik mentioned to me and Kaltenbrunner that Lidice had been cleared, and all the Jews and Czechs had been dealt with. I noticed that this young pilot, who I later learned was Marseille, must have overheard, and I debated whether I should go over and say something to <b>him.</b> <b>I</b> decided against it.|$|E

5|$|In 1981, Fischer {{stayed at}} the home of {{grandmaster}} Peter Biyiasas, where, over a period of four months, he defeated Biyiasas seventeen times in a series of speed games. In an interview with Sports Illustrated reporter William Nack, Biyiasas assessed Fischer's play:He was too good. There was no use in playing him. It wasn't interesting. I was getting beaten, and it wasn't clear to me why. It wasn't like I made this mistake or that mistake. It was like I was being gradually outplayed, from the start. He wasn't taking any time to think. The most depressing thing about it is that I wasn't even getting out of the middle game to an endgame. I don't ever remember an endgame. He honestly believes there is no one for him to play, no one worthy of <b>him.</b> <b>I</b> played him, and I can attest to that.|$|E
5|$|Mark Hoppus' {{involvement}} {{stems from}} when an Atticus Clothing employee played <b>him</b> <b>I</b> Am the Movie. He was so taken with {{it that he}} raved about the band in Rolling Stone, inviting them to open for his group, Blink-182 on their 2004 European tour. On the trek, he became good friends with the musicians. He told them that he had purchased an abundance of recording gear and amplifiers for the previous Blink-182 album and told the band of his interest in recording music from a production standpoint. At the final show of the tour, guitarist Joshua Cain went to Hoppus' dressing room {{and asked him to}} produce their next record. Although Hoppus had never produced anything before, he was excited {{to be a part of}} the album and accepted the offer.|$|E
5|$|That rebellious {{attitude}} really came, I think, when {{my father}} remarried. Because for the three years before he married, I clung to him. It was like, OK, now you're mine, and you're not going anywhere. Like all young girls, I {{was in love with}} my father and I didn't want to lose <b>him.</b> <b>I</b> lost my mother, but then I was the mother, my father was mine. Then he got taken away from me when he married my stepmother. It was then that I said, OK I don’t need anybody. No one's going to break my heart again. I'm not going to need anybody. I can stand on my own and be my own person and not belong to anyone.|$|E

25|$|In {{the heat}} of the moment you {{sometimes}} do an act without thinking. I think this is what happened with Hodson. He had no need to interfere. He was stupid. He was told to keep away.

25|$|As far as Lange is concerned, he was {{the biggest}} murderer I have ever known. To {{write a book about}} him would {{definitely}} not be enough.
