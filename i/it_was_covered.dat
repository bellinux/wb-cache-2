5|$|The building's {{structural}} steel frame {{was also a}} first for the city. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>covered</b> in grey limestone from Saint-Marc-des-Carrières and Queenston. Due to the rapid construction, Saint-Marc-des-Carrières was unable to supply enough stone {{to keep up with}} demand on the building site, resulting in the use of Queenston as an additional source. Saint-Marc-des-Carrières limestone is a pearly grey, and becomes a pale beige with age, while Queenston limestone has pink calcite streaks from crinoid fossils and takes a chamois tint as it ages.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinctive}} nasal arch of Gryposaurus, {{like other}} cranial modifications in duckbills, {{may have been}} used for a variety of social functions, such as identification of sexes or species and social ranking. It could also have functioned as a tool for broadside pushing or butting in social contests, and there may have been inflatable air sacs flanking it for both visual and auditory signaling. The top of the arch is roughened in some specimens, suggesting that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>covered</b> by thick, keratinized skin, or that there was a cartilaginous extension.|$|E
5|$|The {{landscape}} {{upon which}} the settlement of Uxbridge was established is largely unchanged from the Mesolithic era. Much of <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>covered</b> by oak and elm trees, which were gradually cleared by early settlers. An archaeological excavation by the Museum of London in the 1990s found evidence of flint items shaped by Mesolithic hunters, as well as various animal bones and traces of charcoal from the remains of campfires.|$|E

5|$|The song's {{music video}} depicts {{the lives of}} six individuals, {{including}} Jackson, who are left isolated and disconnected from the world around them. This is Jackson's lowest charting song on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 91, though charted in the top 10 in numerous countries worldwide, including Australia, Italy, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. The song {{was performed on the}} HIStory World Tour in 1996–1997. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>covered</b> a few times by other artists.|$|E
5|$|In 1923, Hill {{learned of}} {{the remains of a}} Spanish saddle {{obtained}} from the George DeWitt farm in Webster County. He visited the farm, and learned from DeWitt, the son of the original homesteader, that when the land was first plowed, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>covered</b> with Native American relics. Hill opened a grave and found a Spanish bridle bit and spur; across the river, on land that had never been plowed, he found traces of a camp, including rifle pits. The topography of the site closely matched Pike's description; and when Hill attempted to follow Pike's route from the site to the Arkansas River, he recognized a number of landmarks from Pike's account.|$|E
5|$|The fossils {{found in}} {{abundance}} along this coastline {{provide evidence of}} how animals and plants evolved in this region. During the Triassic this area was a desert, while in the Jurassic {{it was part of}} a tropical sea, and in the Cretaceous <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>covered</b> by swamps. The fossilised remains of the animals and plants that lived in those periods are very well preserved, providing a wealth of information on their body shapes, the way they died and even the fossilised remains of their last meals. Fossil groups found here include crustaceans, insects, molluscs, echinoderms, fish, amphibians, reptiles and a few mammals. At Lulworth Cove there is a fossil forest of conifers, tree-ferns and cycads.|$|E

5|$|The {{watershed}} {{lies in the}} Willamette Valley ecoregion {{designated by}} the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>covered</b> until the mid-19thcentury with Oregon ash, red alder, and western redcedar forests and scattered black cottonwood groves in riparian areas. Douglas-fir and Oregon white oak grew in the uplands. About 57percent of the watershed is covered with plant life, including grass, trees, and all other forms of vegetation. As of 2000, about 70percent of the watershed lay within the urban growth boundary. Of the total land area, 57percent is single-family residential, 12percent multi-family, 10percent commercial, 8percent rural, and 13percent parks and open space. In 2000, of {{about half of the}} rural agricultural total in the watershed consisted of cultivated crops or pasture while tree farms and ornamental nurseries made up about 30percent.|$|E
5|$|People {{in eastern}} and {{southern}} Serbia believed that ale, in their voracity, attacked the Sun and the Moon. They gradually ate {{more and more of}} those celestial bodies, thereby causing an eclipse. During an eclipse, the Sun turned red because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>covered</b> with its own blood {{as a result of the}} ale’s bites; when it shone brightly again, that meant it had defeated the ale. The spots on the Moon were seen as scars from the ale’s bites. While ale devoured the Sun or the Moon, many elderly people became depressed and even wept in fear. If ale succeeded in devouring the Sun, the world would end. To prevent that, men shot their guns toward the eclipse or rang bells, and women cast spells incessantly. There was a notion in the Homolje region that, if ale succeeded in devouring the Moon, the Sun would die from sorrow, and darkness would overwhelm the world.|$|E

Because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>covered</b> almost entirely in glass, it also needed no artificial lighting during the day, thereby reducing the Exhibition's running costs.|$|E
