5|$|Nucleic acid {{amplification}} tests (NAATs), direct fluorescein tests (DFA), and <b>enzyme-linked</b> immunosorbent assays (ELISA) {{are highly}} sensitive tests that can identify specific pathogens present. Serology testing for antibodies {{is not as}} useful since {{the presence of the}} microorganisms in healthy people can confound interpreting the antibody titer levels, although antibody levels can indicate whether an infection is recent or long-term.|$|E
5|$|HIV-1 {{testing is}} {{initially}} by an <b>enzyme-linked</b> immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect antibodies to HIV-1. Specimens with a nonreactive {{result from the}} initial ELISA are considered HIV-negative unless new exposure to an infected partner or partner of unknown HIV status has occurred. Specimens with a reactive ELISA result are retested in duplicate. If the result of either duplicate test is reactive, the specimen is reported as repeatedly reactive and undergoes confirmatory testing with a more specific supplemental test (e.g., western blot or, less commonly, an immunofluorescence assay (IFA)). Only specimens that are repeatedly reactive by ELISA and positive by IFA or reactive by western blot are considered HIV-positive and indicative of HIV infection. Specimens that are repeatedly ELISA-reactive occasionally provide an indeterminate western blot result, which may be either an incomplete antibody response to HIV in an infected person or nonspecific reactions in an uninfected person.|$|E
5|$|The first {{screening}} test in someone {{suspected of having}} HIT is aimed at detecting antibodies against heparin-PF4 complexes. This may be with a laboratory test of the ELISA (<b>enzyme-linked</b> immunosorbent assay) type. The ELISA test, however, detects all circulating antibodies that bind heparin-PF4 complexes, and may also falsely identify antibodies that do not cause HIT. Therefore, those with a positive ELISA are tested further with a functional assay. This test uses platelets and serum from the patient; the platelets are washed and mixed with serum and heparin. The sample is then tested {{for the release of}} serotonin, a marker of platelet activation. If this serotonin release assay (SRA) shows high serotonin release, the diagnosis of HIT is confirmed. The SRA test is difficult to perform and is usually only done in regional laboratories.|$|E
25|$|<b>Enzyme-linked</b> receptors {{are either}} enzymes themselves, or {{directly}} activate associated enzymes. These are typically single-pass transmembrane receptors, with the enzymatic {{component of the}} receptor kept intracellular. The majority of <b>enzyme-linked</b> receptors are, or associate with, protein kinases.|$|E
25|$|Combination Methods Assays may utilize a {{combination}} of the above and other amplification methods to improve sensitivity. e.g. <b>Enzyme-linked</b> immunoassay or EIA, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay.|$|E
25|$|Laboratory {{methods to}} measure {{specific}} IgE antibodies for allergy testing include <b>enzyme-linked</b> immunosorbent assay (ELISA, or EIA), radioallergosorbent test (RAST) and fluorescent enzyme immunoassay (FEIA).|$|E
25|$|Membrane receptors {{are mainly}} divided by {{structure}} and function into 3 classes: The ion channel linked receptor; The <b>enzyme-linked</b> receptor; and The G protein-coupled receptor.|$|E
25|$|Assessment of the A and B toxins by <b>enzyme-linked</b> immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for toxin A or B (or both) has a {{sensitivity}} of 63–99% and a specificity of 93–100%.|$|E
25|$|With <b>enzyme-linked</b> receptors, the {{intracellular}} domain has enzymatic activity. Often, this is {{tyrosine kinase}} activity. The enzymatic activity {{can also be}} due to an enzyme associated with the intracellular domain.|$|E
25|$|Other related {{techniques}} include {{dot blot}} analysis, quantitative dot blot, immunohistochemistry, and immunocytochemistry where antibodies {{are used to}} detect proteins in tissues and cells by immunostaining, and <b>enzyme-linked</b> immunosorbent assay (ELISA).|$|E
25|$|The <b>enzyme-linked</b> immunospot assay (ELISPOT) {{is another}} blood test {{available}} in the UK that may replace the skin test for diagnosis. T-SPOT.TB, a type of ELISPOT assay, counts the number of activated T lymphocytes that secrete interferon γ.|$|E
25|$|ELISA (<b>enzyme-linked</b> immunosorbent assay) {{is another}} method {{that has been}} used to detect Bartonella, but it has a low {{sensitivity}} (17-35%). Western blot for protein detection of Bartonella-associated proteins has also been reported, but this method does not show clear immunoreactive profiles.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of ANAs in blood {{can be confirmed}} by a screening test. Although there are many tests {{for the detection of}} ANAs, the most common tests used for screening are indirect immunofluorescence and <b>enzyme-linked</b> immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Following detection of ANAs, various subtypes are determined.|$|E
25|$|<b>Enzyme-linked</b> immunosorbent assay (ELISA) {{is used in}} {{diagnostic}} laboratories to detect ANCAs. Although IF {{can be used to}} screen for many ANCAs, ELISA is used to detect antibodies to individual antigens. The most common antigens used on an ELISA microtitre plate are MPO and PR3, which are usually tested for after a positive IF test.|$|E
25|$|Anti-dsDNA {{antibodies}} are a {{group of}} anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) the target antigen of which is double stranded DNA. Blood tests such as <b>enzyme-linked</b> immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunofluorescence are routinely performed to detect anti-dsDNA antibodies in diagnostic laboratories. They are highly diagnostic of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and are implicated in the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis.|$|E
25|$|The <b>enzyme-linked</b> immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or Western {{blotting}} are {{two different}} ways that the purified antigen (or multiple antigens) can be obtained and analyzed. This method involves purifying an antigen through the aid of an attached antibody on a solid (beaded) support, such as agarose resin. The immobilized protein complex can be accomplished either in a single step or successively.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis of {{infection}} {{is confirmed by}} the identification of eggs in stools. Eggs of S. mansoni are approximately 140 by 60µm in size, and have a lateral spine. The diagnosis is improved {{by the use of}} the Kato-Katz technique (a semi-quantitative stool examination technique). Other methods that can be used are <b>enzyme-linked</b> immunosorbent assay (ELISA), circumoval precipitation test, and alkaline phosphatase immunoassay.|$|E
25|$|The <b>enzyme-linked</b> immunosorbent assay {{works by}} using {{antibodies}} immobilised on a microtiter plate to capture proteins of interest from samples {{added to the}} well. Using a detection antibody conjugated to an enzyme or fluorophore the quantity of bound protein can be accurately measured by fluorometric or colourimetric detection. The detection process {{is very similar to}} that of a Western blot, but by avoiding the gel steps more accurate quantification can be achieved.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{denaturing}} methods, native {{gel electrophoresis}} {{does not use}} a charged denaturing agent. The molecules being separated (usually proteins or nucleic acids) therefore differ not only in molecular mass and intrinsic charge, but also the cross-sectional area, and thus experience different electrophoretic forces dependent on {{the shape of the}} overall structure. For proteins, since they remain in the native state they may be visualised not only by general protein staining reagents but also by specific <b>enzyme-linked</b> staining.|$|E
25|$|As of 2009, {{there are}} 6 known types of <b>enzyme-linked</b> receptors: Receptor {{tyrosine}} kinases; Tyrosine kinase associated receptors; Receptor-like tyrosine phosphatases; Receptor serine/threonine kinases; Receptor guanylyl cyclases and histidine kinase associated receptors. Receptor tyrosine kinases {{have the largest}} population and widest application. The majority of these molecules are receptors for growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), nerve growth factor (NGF) and hormones such as insulin.|$|E
25|$|IgG {{antibody}} precipitin testing from serum is useful, {{as positive}} results {{are found in}} between 69–90% of patients, though also in 10% of asthmatics with and without SAFS. Therefore, it must be {{used in conjunction with}} other tests. Various forms exist, including <b>enzyme-linked</b> immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and fluorescent enzyme immunoassay (FEIA). Both are more sensitive than conventional counterimmunoelectrophoresis. IgG may not be entirely specific for ABPA, as high levels are also found in chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) alongside more severe radiological findings.|$|E
25|$|The <b>enzyme-linked</b> immunosorbent assay or ELISA is a {{diagnostic}} method for quantitatively or semi-quantitatively determining protein concentrations from blood plasma, serum or cell/tissue extracts in a multi-well plate format (usually 96-wells per plate). Broadly, proteins in solution are adsorbed to ELISA plates. Antibodies specific for the protein of interest {{are used to}} probe the plate. Background is minimised by optimising blocking and washing methods (as for IHC), and specificity is ensured via the presence {{of positive and negative}} controls. Detection methods are usually colorimetric or chemiluminescence based.|$|E
25|$|EIA (enzyme immunoassay) detects {{antibodies}} using a DNA-coated polystyrene microtitre plate. The DNA used {{in these}} assays is often recombinant dsDNA or from calf thymus extract. Upon incubation with serum containing anti-dsDNA antibodies, the antibodies will bind to the DNA and can then be visualised using <b>enzyme-linked</b> secondary antibodies. This assay can be quantitative or semi-quantitative, allowing for estimations of the levels of anti-dsDNA antibodies. This test can produce false positives due to contamination of ssDNA from denatured dsDNA. EIA detects low and high avidity anti-dsDNA antibodies, increasing its sensitivity and reducing its specificity.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, in many human infections, the fluke {{eggs are}} often {{not found in the}} faeces, even after {{multiple}} faecal examinations. Furthermore, eggs of F. hepatica, F. gigantica and Fasciolopsis buski are morphologically indistinguishable. Therefore, immunonological methods such ELISA and <b>enzyme-linked</b> immunoelectrotransfer blot, also called Western blot, are the most important methods in diagnosis of F. hepatica infection. These immunological tests are based on detection of species-specific antibodies from sera. The antigenic preparations used have been primarily derived from extracts of excretory/secretory products from adult worms, or with partially purified fractions. Recently, purified native and recombinant antigens have been used, e.g. recombinant F. hepatica cathepsin L-like protease.|$|E
25|$|The ANA test detects the autoantibodies {{present in}} an individual's blood serum. The common tests used for {{detecting}} and quantifying ANAs are indirect immunofluorescence and <b>enzyme-linked</b> immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In immunofluorescence, {{the level of}} autoantibodies is reported as a titre. This is the highest dilution of the serum at which autoantibodies are still detectable. Positive autoantibody titres at a dilution {{equal to or greater}} than 1:160 are usually considered as clinically significant. Positive titres of less than 1:160 are present in up to 20% of the healthy population, especially the elderly. Although positive titres of 1:160 or higher are strongly associated with autoimmune disorders, they are also found in 5% of healthy individuals. Autoantibody screening is useful in the diagnosis of autoimmune disorders and monitoring levels helps to predict the progression of disease. A positive ANA test is seldom useful if other clinical or laboratory data supporting a diagnosis are not present.|$|E
25|$|Physicians may {{consider}} diagnosing botulism if the patient's history and physical examination suggest botulism. However, these clues {{are often not}} enough to allow a diagnosis. Other diseases such as Guillain–Barré syndrome, stroke, and myasthenia gravis can appear similar to botulism, and special tests {{may be needed to}} exclude these other conditions. These tests may include a brain scan, cerebrospinal fluid examination, nerve conduction test (electromyography, or EMG), and an edrophonium chloride (Tensilon) test for myasthenia gravis. A definite diagnosis can be made if botulinum toxin is identified in the food, stomach or intestinal contents, vomit or feces. The toxin is occasionally found in the blood in peracute cases. Botulinum toxin can be detected by a variety of techniques, including <b>enzyme-linked</b> immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), electrochemiluminescent (ECL) tests and mouse inoculation or feeding trials. The toxins can be typed with neutralization tests in mice. In toxicoinfectious botulism, the organism can be cultured from tissues. On egg yolk medium, toxin-producing colonies usually display surface iridescence that extends beyond the colony.|$|E
25|$|Leishmaniasis is {{diagnosed}} in the hematology laboratory by direct visualization of the amastigotes (Leishman-Donovan bodies). Buffy-coat preparations of peripheral blood or aspirates from marrow, spleen, lymph nodes, or skin lesions should be spread on a slide {{to make a}} thin smear and stained with Leishman stain or Giemsa stain (pH 7.2) for 20 minutes. Amastigotes are seen within blood and spleen monocytes or, less commonly, in circulating neutrophils and in aspirated tissue macrophages. They are small, round bodies 2–4 μm in diameter with indistinct cytoplasm, a nucleus, and a small, rod-shaped kinetoplast. Occasionally, amastigotes may be seen lying free between cells. However, the retrieval of tissue samples is often painful for the patient and identification of the infected cells can be difficult. So, other indirect immunological methods of diagnosis are developed, including <b>enzyme-linked</b> immunosorbent assay, antigen-coated dipsticks, and direct agglutination test. Although these tests are readily available, {{they are not the}} standard diagnostic tests due to their insufficient sensitivity and specificity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Enzyme-linked</b> immunosorbent assay (ELISA) uses antigen-coated microtitre plates for the {{detection}} of ANAs. Each well of a microtitre plate is coated with either a single antigen or multiple antigens to detect specific antibodies or to screen for ANAs, respectively. The antigens are either from cell extracts or recombinant. Blood serum is incubated in the wells of the plate and is washed out. If antibodies that bind to antigen are present then they will remain after washing. A secondary anti-human antibody conjugated to an enzyme such as horseradish peroxidase. The enzyme reaction will produce a change in colour of the solution that is proportional to the amount of antibody bound to the antigen. There are significant differences in {{the detection}} of ANA by immunofluorescence and different ELISA kits and there is only a marginal agreement between these. A clinician must be familiar with the differences in order to evaluate the outcomes of the various assays.|$|E
25|$|The {{specific}} {{diagnosis of}} EVD {{is confirmed by}} isolating the virus, detecting its RNA or proteins, or detecting antibodies against the virus in a person's blood. Isolating the virus by cell culture, detecting the viral RNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and detecting proteins by <b>enzyme-linked</b> immunosorbent assay (ELISA) are methods best used {{in the early stages}} of the disease and also for detecting the virus in human remains. Detecting antibodies against the virus is most reliable in the later stages of the disease and in those who recover. IgM antibodies are detectable two days after symptom onset and IgG antibodies can be detected 6 to 18 days after symptom onset. During an outbreak, isolation of the virus via cell culture methods is often not feasible. In field or mobile hospitals, the most common and sensitive diagnostic methods are real-time PCR and ELISA. In 2014, with new mobile testing facilities deployed in parts of Liberia, test results were obtained 3–5 hours after sample submission. In 2015 a rapid antigen test which gives results in 15 minutes was approved for use by WHO. It is able to confirm Ebola in 92% of those affected and rule it out in 85% of those not affected.|$|E
25|$|Some {{proteins}} perform largely structural roles. For instance, {{movements of}} the proteins actin and myosin ultimately {{are responsible for the}} contraction of skeletal muscle. One property many proteins have is that they specifically bind to a certain molecule or class of moleculesthey may be extremely selective in what they bind. Antibodies are an example of proteins that attach to one specific type of molecule. In fact, the <b>enzyme-linked</b> immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which uses antibodies, {{is one of the most}} sensitive tests modern medicine uses to detect various biomolecules. Probably the most important proteins, however, are the enzymes. Virtually every reaction in a living cell requires an enzyme to lower the activation energy of the reaction. These molecules recognize specific reactant molecules called substrates; they then catalyze the reaction between them. By lowering the activation energy, the enzyme speeds up that reaction by a rate of 1011 or more; a reaction that would normally take over 3,000 years to complete spontaneously might take less than a second with an enzyme. The enzyme itself is not used up in the process, and is free to catalyze the same reaction with a new set of substrates. Using various modifiers, the activity of the enzyme can be regulated, enabling control of the biochemistry of the cell as a whole.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Conteh coauthored a study {{published}} in the Journal of Clinical Microbiology comparing the efficacy and outcome of diagnosing Lassa fever patients with the indirect fluorescent-antibody (IFA) test and the <b>enzyme-linked</b> immunosorbent assay (ELISA). According to Iruka N. Okeke, the study [...] "focused specifically on the development of a diagnostic test for Lassa fever". In 2001, Conteh travelled to London, England to attend an international conference on Lassa fever where he presented a paper on managing the disease. Conteh returned to London in September 2003 to receive the [...] "Spirit of Merlin" [...] award for his outstanding role in [...] "saving lives and alleviating suffering".|$|E
2500|$|Detecting antigens is {{yet another}} way to {{diagnose}} the disease. [...] This {{can be done with}} direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) techniques. [...] It can also be achieved through indirect immunofluorescence assay. [...] <b>Enzyme-linked</b> immunosorbent assay (ELISA) also detects antigens.|$|E
2500|$|Immunocytochemistry, which {{involves}} raising antibodies against targeted {{chemical or biological}} entities, includes a few other techniques of interest. A targeted neurotransmitter could be specifically tagged by primary and secondary antibodies with radioactive labeling {{in order to identify}} the neurotransmitter by [...] autoradiography. The presence of neurotransmitters (though not necessarily the location) can be observed in <b>enzyme-linked</b> immunocytochemistry or enzyme--linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) in which substrate-binding in the enzymatic assays can induce precipitates, fluorophores, or chemiluminescence. In the event that neurotransmitters cannot be histochemically identified, an alternative method is to locate them by their neural uptake mechanisms.|$|E
2500|$|Buczkowski and Bennett {{also studied}} {{the pattern of}} food {{movement}} within a nest. They labeled sucrose with Immunoglobin G (IgG) proteins, and then identified them using an <b>enzyme-linked</b> immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to track the movement of food. They found that food was spread through trophallaxis, which is when one animal regurgitates food to another. [...] Despite this trophallactic spread of food, the workers kept most of the sucrose. They also found that some queens received more food than others, suggesting a dominance hierarchy even between [...] queens. They {{also found that the}} nests were located in a system of trails, and that their distribution depended on where food was found and the distance between these patches of food.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{commonly}} included disorders of the endocrine system are congenital hypothyroidism (CH) and congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). [...] Testing for both disorders {{can be done}} using blood samples collected on the standard newborn screening card. [...] Screening for CH is done by measuring thyroxin (T4), thyrotropin (TSH) {{or a combination of}} both analytes. [...] Elevated 17α-hydroxyprogesterone (17α-OHP) is the primary marker used when screening for CAH, {{most commonly}} done using <b>enzyme-linked</b> immunosorbant assays, with many programs using a second tier tandem mass spectrometry test {{to reduce the number of}} false positive results. [...] Careful analysis of screening results for CAH may also identify cases of congenital adrenal hypoplasia, which presents with extremely low levels of 17α-OHP.|$|E
50|$|<b>Enzyme-linked</b> receptors {{are either}} enzymes themselves, or {{directly}} activate associated enzymes. These are typically single-pass transmembrane receptors, with the enzymatic {{component of the}} receptor kept intracellular.
