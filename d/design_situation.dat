40|$|The {{awareness}} about the gap between general design theory and design practice is increasing. Design practice is not really served {{with the results of}} current design theory. To build a bridge between theory and practice, design researchers should know {{what is really going on}} in practice. To explore design practice and to find the most important characteristics of <b>design</b> <b>situations,</b> I have chosen an empirical approach based on case studies in which design projects in different disciplines are compared. In each case study, an individual designer is interviewed and the design documents are analysed. The results in this article are based on two architectural projects, two software-engineering projects and two mechanical-engineering projects. The cross-case analysis has resulted in descriptions of <b>design</b> <b>situations</b> in these disciplines. A preliminary design frame to describe <b>design</b> <b>situations</b> in different disciplines has been derived. Based on similarities and differences in the descriptions, conclusions concerning design theory, design education and design practice are given. The most important conclusions are the following. First, designers are often not aware of their design process, but focus mainly on the product. Second, software designers more often than architects and mechanical engineers use methods to structure their overall design process. ...|$|R

He described a multi-media landscape that was converging into an integrated digital space. Adjacent to this was the redefinition of skills and roles that would create, build, sustain, and innovate this dynamic environment. He called for graphic/visual designers to broaden their perspective, beyond traditional artifacts and methods, and immerse themselves in a collaborative workspace. In his book, Designing Business, Mok emphasized redefinition of design practice dramatically affected by technological change: [...] "Designers {{are in a position}} to promulgate new values and to define and quantify the effects of those values, and over the next ten years, their optimum role will be to design 'understanding.' The age we're living now is an incredible time because of the extent to which designers, business people, engineers, and technologists can redefine their roles." ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Users of Business Intelligence (BI) {{systems have}} started to demand more {{flexible}} systems {{in which they could}} be empowered to serve themselves – self-service BI. In this paper we aim at explaining how such development influences designers of BI solutions and how it impacts the <b>design</b> <b>situation.</b> To say something about this we adapted the PACT (People, Activity, Context, Technology) framework on the BI <b>design</b> <b>situation</b> by conducting semi-structured interviews with vendors and suppliers of BI systems. From the research we found that self-service BI should be seen as a complement rather than a substitute to traditional BI. The concluding remark on the <b>design</b> <b>situation</b> is that designers of BI systems have to consider a more complex <b>design</b> <b>situation</b> where designers need to have increased knowledge about users mental models, decision focus and usage of BI systems in the analysis and design phases for being able to design useful self-service BI systems. The main conclusion from this is that designing for self-service BI is a more demanding <b>design</b> <b>situation</b> for designers of BI solutions...|$|E
40|$|Designing {{information}} systems {{is a complex}} task. The purpose of this work is to contribute to an improved understanding of the design conditions in order to alleviate the problems that occur due to complexity in the design process. To possibly increase {{the understanding of the}} conditions for the design of interactive {{information systems}}, this dissertation concerns applying systems approach to the <b>design</b> <b>situation.</b> This is done in order to obtain understanding, but also to be able to identify the consequences and possible benefits of doing so. A literature survey and two extensive interviews have been performed. The material has been analysed, and tentative models of the <b>design</b> <b>situation</b> and its components are presented. These models can be considered general to the <b>design</b> <b>situation</b> and consequences are deduced from them. The result of this work is manifested in the tentative models, which describe the <b>design</b> <b>situation,</b> the designer, the user, the customer and the design.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{in support of}} a keynote {{presentation}} at MIDI 2013, I compare three major design paradigms and their commitments to 'centric' design activities through analyses of their Abstract <b>Design</b> <b>Situations,</b> which differ in their commitment to making and co-ordinating various types of design choices. Combining existing design paradigms provides new post-centric opportunities for design that are Balanced, Integrative and Generous (BIG). To realise these opportunities in design work, we need to provide support via re-usable resources, and guidance on development and use of local resources to realise a balanced range of integrated functions.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a domain-independent design method developed to support designers {{during the whole}} design process.

40|$|The design {{standards}} (IEC, DNV and GL) define a minimum set of combinations of external conditions and <b>design</b> <b>situations</b> as load cases. Like other design load conditions, the <b>design</b> <b>situations</b> relating to fault and shut-down events shall be addressed. Emergency shut down {{occurs in the}} presence of severe faults to prevent turbine damage. For pitch-regulated turbines, blade pitching to feather provides an effective means of aerodynamic braking. The blades are pitched to feather at the maximum pitch rate. This action exerts huge loading on the turbine and may challenge the structural safety.

40|$|Part 2 : Situated Method EngineeringInternational audienceSituational design methods provide {{problem solving}} {{guidance}} {{that can be}} configured to fit a range of different design goals and contexts. While the formal aspects of situational method engineering are well researched, the specification of method fragment instances and their configurations is often left open and regarded as specific to the respective design problem class. We propose an approach that analyzes variations of existing design solutions to explore the underlying design factors and to identify <b>design</b> <b>situations.</b> This knowledge is then used to derive method fragments and configuration rules that represent the explored variety of design solutions. The proposed approach has been applied for several design problem classes to construct concrete situational design methods. As an illustrative example, {{the construction of a}} situational design method for enterprise architecture management is used in this paper. Based on the exploration of eight design factors and three <b>design</b> <b>situations,</b> six method fragments are derived that are combined into four situational method configurations...|$|R

40|$|Design is situated. Situatedness in {{designing}} entails the explicit {{consideration of the}} state of the environment, the knowledge and experiences of the designer and the interactions between the designer and the environment during designing. Central to the notion of situatedness is the notion of <b>design</b> <b>situation</b> and constructive memory. A <b>design</b> <b>situation</b> models a particular state of interaction between a design agent and the environment at a particular point in time. Memory construction occurs whenever a design agent uses past experiences and knowledge within the current design environment in a situated manner. This paper is concerned with the development of an agent-based computational design tool that takes into consideration the notion of situatedness {{in designing}}. A key element of this tool is a constructive memory system that supports the dynamic nature of designing where memories of past experiences are constructed as required by the current situation. The behaviours of the memory system are illustrated through a series of experiments that demonstrates the effect of learning across various situations according to interactions with the environment...|$|E
