25|$|Some {{wildlife}} species, {{which are}} fast vanishing {{in other parts}} of India, are found in the desert in large numbers such as the blackbuck (Antilope cervicapra), chinkara (Gazella bennettii) and <b>Indian</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> (Equus hemionus khur) in the Rann of Kutch. They have evolved excellent survival strategies, their size is smaller than other similar animals living in different conditions, and they are mainly nocturnal. There are certain other factors responsible for the survival of these animals in the desert. Due to the lack of water in this region, transformation of the grasslands into cropland has been very slow. The protection provided to them by a local community, the Bishnois, is also a factor. Other mammals of the Thar Desert include a subspecies of red fox (Vulpes vulpes pusilla) and the caracal.|$|E

50|$|Of late, it {{has been}} spotted right outside Ahmedabad near Nal Sarovar Bird Sanctuary. It seems {{it is no more}} {{confined}} to the 4,953.71 km2 area of the Rann, but it is now being found right up to the Kala Dungar near Banni grasslands in Kutch and Nal Sarovar. Within the State of Gujarat it is now also found in districts of Surendranagar, Rajkot, Patan, Banaskantha and Kutch.

50|$|A the {{previous}} census in 2009, estimated 4,038 <b>Indian</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ass.</b> However, {{the population was}} still growing. In December 2014, the population was estimated at 4,451 individuals. It has increased from a jump of 454. However, as of 2015, the current <b>Indian</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> population has increased to more than 4,800 individuals in {{and outside of the}} Wild Ass Wildlife Sanctuary of India.|$|E
5000|$|In India Prosopis spp {{had been}} {{introduced}} decades ago but it wasnâ€™t until recently that its effects had been studied. This plant species has been pushing out the <b>Indian</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> (Equus hemionus khur). [...] This herbivorous mammal eats the pods of Prosopis spp, {{which is one of}} the intended purposes of its introduction. Through digesting and excreting the seeds the Indian wild asses are providing the habitat needed for germination. The 5,000 square-kilometer <b>Indian</b> <b>Wild</b> <b>Ass</b> Sanctuary is experiencing mesquite invasion of roughly 1.95 square-kilometers a year. By overtaking the land, the dense canopy cover of Prosopis spp has made it so native vegetation cannot grow. It has also made watering holes inaccessible to the animals within this region. This lack of resources and range is forcing the endangered <b>Indian</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> into human landscapes and agriculture fields and locals are killing these asses in order to protect their crops.|$|E
50|$|India's Thar Desert {{spans the}} western states of Rajasthan and Gujarat. More people live here {{than in any other}} desert, with a {{population}} density 100 times that of the Sahara, and growing all the time. Fortunately the people of the desert look favourably on their wild neighbours, as demonstrated by the villagers of Khichan, who feed large flocks of demoiselle cranes over the winter. The birds are revered as symbols of fortune. Thapar visits a desert dwelling of the Bishnoi people, strict vegetarians and guardians of the animal population. Despite this, poaching is rife and the blackbucks, filmed in the breeding season, are being increasingly marginalised. The chinkara or Indian gazelle is an even hardier animal, getting all the moisture it needs from plants and the morning dew. Wolves and jackals are also shown. Around a camp fire, the nocturnal inhabitants of the desert are filmed as they emerge from the sand: dung beetles, gerbils and predatory saw scaled vipers and scorpions. The people of Jodhpur are vegetarians but use domesticated oxen, camels and buffalo as working animals. When they die, the carcasses are taken {{to the edge of the}} city and left as food for scavengers, among them Asian king vultures, Indian white-rumped vultures and griffon vultures. Waterholes attract many animals before they dry up during the heat of summer. It is also used by people and their livestock for washing and drinking. Birds shown include pied kingfisher, red-wattled lapwing and black-winged stilt. To escape egrets, frogs hop across the surface of the water. At night, climbing perch leave the water and travel across land to find other pools, and an ingenious ratel uses logs to reach a stricken kingfisher chick. The most extreme environment is the Rann of Kutch salt flats where only the monsoon brings relief to the last population of <b>Indian</b> <b>wild</b> <b>asses.</b> In the closing scenes, Thapar observes flocks of flamingos which come to the salt flats in times of flood.|$|R
50|$|Based {{on ancient}} drawings, the Atlas <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> had stripes on its legs {{as well as}} a {{shoulder}} cross. Of the living subspecies of African <b>wild</b> <b>ass,</b> the Somali <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> has only leg stripes, and the Nubian <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> only the shoulder stripe. One or both features appear sometimes in the domestic donkey, the domestic descendant of the African <b>wild</b> <b>asses.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Somali <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> {{is one of}} two {{subspecies}} of African <b>wild</b> <b>ass,</b> {{the other}} being the Nubian <b>wild</b> <b>ass.</b> Domesticated more than 6,000 years ago in northern Africa, <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> is thought to be the origin species for donkeys. The Somali <b>wild</b> <b>ass's</b> remaining <b>wild</b> population of fewer than 2,000 is found in small, scattered pockets of western Africa.|$|R
50|$|It {{is famous}} as the world's last refuge of the <b>Indian</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> (khur) for the {{conservation}} of which it has been declared as the <b>Indian</b> <b>Wild</b> <b>Ass</b> Sanctuary. Though a bleak landscape it is rich in biodiversity and is an ecologically important area for wildlife and many local and migratory waterbirds like cranes, ducks, pelicans, flamingos and land birds like sandgrouse, francolins and the Indian bustards.It is also home to various unique mammals apart from wild ass such as the Indian wolf (Canis lupus pallipes), desert fox (Vulpes vulpes pusilla) and nilgai (Boselaphus tragocamelus).|$|E
50|$|It {{is unknown}} how the <b>Indian</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> {{disappeared}} from its former haunts {{in parts of}} western India and Pakistan, since the animal was never a hunting target of Indian Maharajas and colonial British officials of the British Raj. However, India's Mughal Emperors and noblemen from the time took great pleasure in hunting it with Emperor Jahangir in his book Tuzk-e-Jahangiri. In an illustrated copy that has survived of Akbarnama, the book of Mughal Emperor Akbar the Great there is an illustration of Akbar on an <b>Indian</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> shoot with several of them having been shot by him.|$|E
50|$|The Gujarat Ecological Education and Research Foundation (GEER) {{report has}} {{recommended}} that the Thar desert in Rajasthan should be developed as an alternative site for re-establishing the <b>Indian</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> by reintroduction {{a few of them}} there.|$|E
50|$|The Badhyz State Nature Reserve is an {{important}} stronghold of the Asiatic <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> (Equus hemionus kulan). It was once the last place where the Turkmenian <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> was found. The <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> population increased from 200, when the reserve was founded to 5000 animals. After a strong decline, there are now about 650 <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> in the sanctuary.|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{data from}} extant donkeys (Equus asinus) have {{revealed}} two distinct mitochondrial DNA haplogroups, suggestive of two separate domestication events in northeast Africa about 5000 years ago. Without distinct phylogeographic structure in domestic donkey haplogroups and with little {{information on the}} genetic makeup of the ancestral African <b>wild</b> <b>ass,</b> however, it {{has been difficult to}} identify wild ancestors and geographical origins for the domestic mitochondrial clades. Our analysis of ancient archaeological and historic museum samples provides the first genetic information on the historic Nubian <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> (Equus africanus africanus), Somali <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> (Equus africanus somaliensis) and ancient donkey. The results demonstrate that the Nubian <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> was an ancestor of the first donkey haplogroup. In contrast, the Somali <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> has considerable mitochondrial divergence from the Nubian <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> and domestic donkeys. These findings resolve the long-standing issue {{of the role of the}} Nubian <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> in the domestication of the donkey, but raise new questions regarding the second ancestor for the donkey. Our results illustrate the complexity of animal domestication, and have conservation implications for critically endangered Nubian and Somali <b>wild</b> <b>ass...</b>|$|R
25|$|Few {{species of}} ass {{exist in the}} wild. The African <b>wild</b> <b>ass,</b> Equus africanus, has two subspecies, the Somali <b>wild</b> <b>ass,</b> Equus africanus somaliensis, and the Nubian <b>wild</b> <b>ass,</b> Equus africanus africanus, the {{principal}} ancestor of the domestic donkey. Both are critically endangered. Extinct species include the European ass, Equus hydruntinus, which became extinct during the Neolithic, and the North African <b>wild</b> <b>ass,</b> Equus africanus atlanticus, which became extinct in Roman times.|$|R

50|$|The Asiatic <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> {{is larger}} than African <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> at about 290 kg and 2.1 m (head-body length). They are reddish-brown or yellowish-brown in color and have broad dorsal stripe on {{the middle of the}} back. Unlike most horses and donkeys, onagers have never been domesticated. They are among the fastest mammals, as they can run as fast as 64 km/h (40 mph) to 70 km/h (43 mph). The onager is closely related to the African <b>wild</b> <b>ass,</b> as they both shared the same ancestor. The kiang, {{formerly}} considered a subspecies of Equus hemionus, diverged from the Asiatic <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> and has been acknowledged as a distinct species.|$|R
50|$|The Nubian <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> hasn't {{been seen}} since the 1950s-70s and is presumed extinct.
