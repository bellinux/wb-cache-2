5|$|Without any APFA wins, the Flyers {{could not}} contend for the APFA Championship. However, with wins against the Gas City Tigers and the Muncie Offers More AC, the Flyers {{claimed to have}} won the Indiana State Championship. Sportswriter Bruce Copeland {{compiled}} the All-Pro list for the 1920 season, but no player from the Flyers was on the list. Ken Huffine <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> affiliated with the Chicago Stayles after the 1920 season, and Cooney Checkaye took over the role the following season. It did not help, and the Flyers' final year in the APFA was 1921. As of 2012, no players from the 1920 Muncie Flyers have been enshrined into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.|$|E

5|$|Following the marriage, {{there was}} a period of {{consolidation}} taking the form of a series of statutes of the Reformation Parliament aimed at finding solutions to any remaining issues, whilst protecting the new reforms from challenge, convincing the public of their legitimacy, and exposing and dealing with opponents. Although the canon law was dealt with at length by Cranmer and others, these acts were advanced by Thomas Cromwell, Thomas Audley and the Duke of Norfolk and indeed by Henry himself. With this process complete, in May 1532 More resigned as Lord Chancellor, leaving Cromwell as Henry's chief minister. With the Act of Succession 1533, Catherine's daughter, Mary, was declared illegitimate; Henry's marriage to Anne was declared legitimate; and Anne's issue was <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> next in the line of succession. With the Acts of Supremacy in 1534, Parliament also recognised the King's status as head of the church in England and, with the Act in Restraint of Appeals in 1532, abolished the right of appeal to Rome. It was only then that Pope Clement took the step of excommunicating Henry and Thomas Cranmer, although the excommunication was not made official until some time later.|$|E
5|$|Michael Jackson, {{a former}} Motown star who by {{the start of}} {{development}} on The Wiz in 1977, had left Motown for Epic Records with his brothers The Jacksons, was cast as the Scarecrow. Jackson was dedicated to the role, and watched videotapes of gazelles, cheetahs, and panthers in order to learn graceful movements for his part. However Jackson's father Joseph Jackson didn't want him to land the role, as he was managing him at the time, but Jackson refused to listen to his father and <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> on the movie. Ted Ross and Mabel King were brought in to reprise their respective roles from the stage musical, while Nipsey Russell was cast as the Tin Man. Lena Horne, mother-in-law to Sidney Lumet during the time of production, was cast as Glinda the Good Witch, and comedian Richard Pryor portrayed The Wiz.|$|E
5|$|Nojima {{was charged}} with writing the {{scenario}} and with unifying the team members' ideas into a cohesive narrative, as Kitase was impressed with his earlier work on the mystery-like Heracles no Eikō III: Kamigami no Chinmoku, an entry in the Glory of Heracles series. To make the characters seem more realistic, Nojima wrote them so they would not unanimously agree, with some raising objections instead: while this inevitably slowed down {{the pace of the}} story, it added depth to the characters. The graphical improvements enabled even relatively bland lines of dialogue to be enhanced. As the inclusion of voice acting would have lead to significant load times, it was <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> omitted. Another writer who contributed was Masato Kato, who wrote several late-game scenes including the Lifestream sequence and Cloud and Tifa's conversation before the final battle. Initially not involved with the project, he was called upon to help flesh out less important story scenes. He wrote his scenes to his own tastes without outside consultation, something he later regretted.|$|E

5|$|The {{graphic design}} was <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{modelled}} {{from those of}} cartoons, and a goal was to have two thousand character animations. Another artist was hired to complete the graphics on time, and the team ultimately ended up with four. Fellow artist Andy Bass had difficulty getting the Kit-Kat graphics correct. He {{said they did not}} have the right colour, so Carr tweaked the palette. Bass modelled the vending machine that would use the Kit-Kat graphics and used 3D Studio to render it into the game palette, which he then edited using Deluxe Paint. By spring 1996, around half of the illnesses and animations were complete, the introduction and cutscenes were mostly complete, and the programming of the management system was almost finished. By early 1997, all that was left was refining the difficulty levels.|$|E
5|$|Trenyce {{was born}} in Memphis, Tennessee on March 31, 1980. Her father, Jesse Cobbins, worked for St. Joe Company, and her mother, Linda Ruth Cobbins, worked at FedEx. She has an older and a younger sister. As a child, she <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> known by her middle name, feeling that it better suited her ambitions as a performer. Trenyce has written that her {{interest}} in music started after performing a solo in a musical production celebrating Martin Luther King, Jr. She grew up in North Memphis, where she attended Central High School and performed in various talent shows and pageants. In 1996, she won first place in a singing competition at the national NAACP Afro-Academic, Cultural, Technological and Scientific Olympics in Atlanta.|$|E
5|$|Issues arose over {{authority}} {{to control the}} upbringing of his heir-presumptive. As head of the Coburg family, Ernest would normally {{have been able to}} arrange Alfred's education and general upbringing unchallenged. This however was not the case. Alfred was torn between his British birth and his German inheritance. This was partly because Alfred was second-in-line to the United Kingdom until the birth of his nephew Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale, in 1864. One example of the many problems of his education concerned the language he would speak. Although he grew up learning German, his native language was <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> English. In addition, a naval career was chosen for Alfred, a common profession for a British prince but almost unheard of for a German prince. Ernest also wanted Alfred to be educated in Coburg, but his brother refused. Albert's refusal most likely stemmed from the negative British reaction that would have inevitably occurred and the fact that Albert was fearful of Alfred's moral development. Thus despite Ernest's protests, he went unheeded in Albert's lifetime. In 1863, Ernest told Victoria {{that it was time for}} Alfred to leave the navy and enter a German university. By March of the following year, it was decided that Alfred would attend Bonn University but be left to consider his future, as he was having reservations over permanently residing outside England. The matter was eventually resolved; Alfred came to accept his inheritance, and Victoria understood and accepted that Ernest needed to be involved in the upbringing of his heir-presumptive, with a strong German element added to his education and (carefully chaperoned) visits to Coburg.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the reasons}} the {{development}} team chose Tokyo as the main setting was that its turbulent history, going through multiple phases of development and often suffering severe damage in wars or due to natural disasters, made it comparable with the fantasy settings of other games at the time. In a later interview, an Atlus staff member stated that this setting and style made it the antithesis of traditional fantasy RPGs, adding that this resulted in the game developing a punk spirit. Because of the post-apocalyptic setting of Megami Tensei II, the development team wanted to depict a time before the apocalypse. The decision to set the game in Tokyo was made by Suzuki and Kaneko, and was influenced by manga such as Violence Jack, Devilman, and Fist of the North Star. Kichijōji was <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the game's starting point due to Kaneko, Suzuki, and Ito all having lived in or near the area, or having visited it often. The abandoned Terminal Echo building there fascinated them, making them wonder how a building in such a prime location could remain unoccupied; Ito described it as two floors of arcade cabinets, {{with the rest of the}} building feeling like a ghost town. This fascination led to it being included as a dungeon in the game. While designing the maps, Kaneko wanted to use wire-frame models, but the Super Famicom's limited capacities meant this idea was scrapped.|$|E
5|$|The {{year after}} the Olympics, Dix began {{the season with a}} world-leading time of 10.00seconds in Tallahassee in April. He also set a world-leading relay time of 37.92seconds with Travis Padgett, Shawn Crawford and Darvis Patton at the Penn Relays. However, he failed to {{maintain}} this strong form through the rest of 2009. Coach Teddy Long planned to improve Dix's start and acceleration in his races, but the two parted company in April. He placed third behind Michael Rodgers and Asafa Powell at the Prefontaine Classic but, unusually, this proved to {{one of the highlights of}} a low-profile year for Dix. He competed at the US Championships, but injuries forced him out of both the 100m and 200m races and he did not qualify for the World Championships. Furthermore, he entered a legal battle with his management company, regarding whether they merited the 20% portion of his multimillion-dollar sponsorship contract with Nike. The dispute with his agent Kimberly Holland was resolved in July: although the terms were undisclosed, Dix left Holland's Icon Management and <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> his own agent. With his father as his coach, a legal battle and no major races to prepare for, Dix ran only a handful of local meetings in the rest of 2009.|$|E
