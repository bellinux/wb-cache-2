5000|$|Others {{focus on}} Trump's position. Dismissing Trump's {{argument}} as [...] "folk economics," [...] Tim Worstall argues that moving production to low-wage countries like Mexico {{is good for}} Americans who can buy air conditioners more cheaply. [...] Binyamin Appelbaum, writes that while {{the overwhelming majority of}} economists argue that importing goods manufactured by low-wage manufacturing work has been <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>America</b> because the balance of trade remains positive, economists have [...] "oversold their case," [...] neglecting to encounter the reality that, [...] "trade has a downside, and while the benefits of trade are broadly distributed, the costs are often concentrated," [...] borne by former factory workers. [...] By contrast, Jim Cramer thinks Trump is correct when he asserts that trade deals lowering tariff barriers have devastated the American economy.|$|E
5000|$|Cuellar has {{sometimes}} been criticized by fellow Democrats for being too close to Republicans. It has occasionally been suggested during his career that he would switch to the Republican Party. In an interview in September 2014, Cuellar said: [...] "I'm a Democrat, and I will die as a Democrat ... if a person, an elected official, puts party before their country or their state, it's wrong. We're certainly seeing that in Washington, where party comes first, and if you’re not loyal to the party, there’s something wrong with you. The easy for thing for me is to always {{go along with the}} Democratic Party, but that would not serve my state and that would not serve the district itself... I'm the first Democrat that pays my dues the DCCC... I pay more than anybody, any other Democrat, congressional member, in the state of Texas. I've done that {{for the last couple of}} years. I don’t go around and say, ‘I give more money than anybody,’ but I support my party. If you are going to have a litmus test — out of 100 votes, you support your party and that makes you a good member of Congress? I think that’s the wrong litmus test. What’s <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>America</b> and what’s good for Texas, that should be the litmus test." ...|$|E
40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{traditional}} approach to economic development which embodied the battle cry, “What’s good for General Motors is <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>America.</b> ” The authors explore and explain {{the changes in the}} world economy which have made {{the traditional approach}} passé. They explore the impact of entrepreneurship on employment and the U. S. economy, and demonstrate that the greatest impact on the economy during the decade of the 1990 s, as well as the greatest potential for future economic development, is vested in those firms with less than 20 employees. The authors propose specific economic development policy changes which can result in creating an atmosphere which is more conducive to entrepreneurial activity, and suggest that the battle cry should be changed to, “What’s good for Entrepreneurship is <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>America.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|Running a {{business}} {{has become less}} private, more open, less managerial, more political, less a right, more a privilege dependent on the will of stakeholders. It has also become more external: people outside management who are affected by management’s decisions increasingly have a voice in, if not a veto over, these decisions, and {{have access to the}} technology that enables them to have that voice heard globally. Historically, companies have tried to deal with their external environment by adding specific staff functions to respond to particular ’threats ’ as they emerged. The authors argue that a more proactive approach is needed to adapt to the new reality of business in a global world. After analysing several cases that laid out important historical antecedents spanning the last 30 years, the authors suggest a new paradigm-based on open systems theory for conceptualizing and organizing the corporate external affairs activities. In the 1950 s, a president of General Motors said that what was good for General Motors was <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>America.</b> About that time, an influential Brazilian state governor said that what was good for the United States was good for Brazil. Of course, both gentlemen were proved to be wrong...|$|E
40|$|During the Senate’s closed {{confirmation}} hearings on President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s nomination of George E.

Wilson replied that he would, but added he could not imagine having to make such a choice because “[f]or years I thought what was good for the country was good for General Motors and vice versa. ” This bit of rhetorical bromide was reported erroneously by the press, which had been excluded from the closed hearing, as the arrogant manifesto of corporate superiority with which most of us are familiar: “What’s good for General Motors is <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>America.</b> ” In a similar fashion, Professor Sung Hui Kim has converted the important but benign amicus support that General Motors and sixty-five other major American corporations gave to the University of Michigan in Grutter v. Bollinger into a hypocritical “diversity double standard,” because they allegedly embraced a diversity standard in Grutter that they would not accept for themselves. According to Kim, the corporate amici argued “that universities should promote diversity because it’s good for business,” but did not “make even a passing reference to the economic self-interest of universities or, for that matter, any of the significant costs that affirmative action programs generate for universities. ” Kim argues, however, that the very factors the corporate amici ignored in Grutter are central to their assessment of the appropriateness of diversity for themselves...|$|E
