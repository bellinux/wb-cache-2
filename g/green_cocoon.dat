5000|$|Mating in Tetragnatha montana is not {{initiated}} through courtship by {{the male}}s, the male avoids being bitten by the female by locking her chelicerae in his own, using a spur and escapes after mating. The female then produces a dark <b>green</b> <b>cocoon</b> where she stores the fertilised eggs, this is {{encased in a}} fine white web. The cocoon is attached to vegetation, most commonly leaves, and the female guards and protects the cocoon against predators until the spiderlings hatch, after about 100 days. [...] Molecular markers (allozymes) {{have been used to}} confirm that wild-collected females of T. montana, mated with multiple males, indicating that sperm competition is potentially an important driver {{in the evolution of the}} species' mating system.|$|E
40|$|In the {{silkworm}} Bombyx mori, dietary flavonoids are metabolized and {{accumulate in}} cocoons, thereby causing green coloration. Classical genetic {{studies suggest that}} more than seven independent loci are associated with this trait; however, because of the complex inheritance pattern, none of these loci have been characterized molecularly, and a plausible and comprehensive model for their action has not been proposed. Here, we report {{the identification of the}} gene responsible for the Green b (Gb) locus involving the <b>green</b> <b>cocoon</b> trait. In +Gb animals, glucosylation at the 5 -O position of dietary quercetin did not occur, and the total amount of flavonoids in tissues and cocoons was dramatically reduced. We performed positional cloning of Gb and found a 38 -kb deletion in a UDP-glucosyltransferase (UGT) gene cluster associated with the +Gb allele. RT-PCR and biochemical studies suggested that deletion of Bm-UGT 10286 (UGT) is responsible for Gb and Bm-UGT 10286 is virtually the sole source of UGT activity toward the 5 -O position of quercetin. Our data show that the regiospecific glucosylation of flavonoids by the quercetin 5 -O-glucosyltransferase can greatly affect the overall bioavailability of flavonoids in animals. Furthermore, we provide evidence that flavonoids increase the UV-shielding activity of cocoons and thus could confer an increased survival advantage to insects contained in these cocoons. This study will lead to greater understanding of mechanisms for metabolism, uptake, and transport of dietary flavonoids, which have a variety of biological activities in animals and beneficial effects on human health...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{quantitative}} trait loci (QTLs) associated with cocoon traits in silkworms were mapped in 44 individuals of a backcross of Dazao females with hybrid F 1 males; the hybrid males were from females of inbred C 100 strain, which have white cocoons and superior cocoon traits, crossed with males of inbred strain Dazao, which have <b>green</b> <b>cocoons</b> and inferior cocoon traits. Nineteen putative major QTLs of silkworm cocoon traits, five QTLs of whole cocoon weight, four QTLs of cocoon shell weight, six QTLs of pupa weight, and four QTLs of cocoon shell rate were scattered across nine linkage groups. The variances explained by QTLs for whole cocoon weight, cocoon shell weight, pupa weight, and cocoon shell rate were 51. 0, 73. 69, 51. 80, and 59. 52 %, respectively. The numbers of major QTLs 79 ©FUNPEC-RP www. funpecrp. com. brGenetics and Molecular Research 9 (1) : 78 - 88 (2010) QTLs for economic traits of silkworm cocoon with contributions above 10 % for these traits were two, three, two, and four, respectively...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the genetics of cross breeding system between multivoltine and bivoltine race, a hybridization experiment was conducted by crossing females of multivoltine Pure Mysore race (PM) with males of a bivoltine race C 108 and its reciprocals. The F 1 and F 2 progenies of the above crosses were derived in order to study the economic traits and biological characters. The results of the analysis of the thirteen economic traits in the F 1 progeny between the regular and reciprocal crosses clearly indicated that wherever PM is participated as female partner the values of the economic traits are on the higher side than the reciprocals. In regard to the studies on the biological characters, the F 1 progeny of a cross of females of PM with males of C 108 produced non-diapause eggs exhibiting 23 - 24 days of larval duration and spinning light <b>green</b> <b>cocoons.</b> On the other hand a cross between females of C 108 with males of PM produced only diapause type of eggs having larval duration of 22 days which is shorter by 1 - 1. 5 days compared to regular cross. The F 2 progenies involving both the crosses produced 3 : 1 ratio diapause: non-diapause eggs and green: white cocoons indicating Mendelian pattern of inheritance for voltinism and cocoon colour. The authors in the present investigation discussed the importance of hemizygous and heterozygous individuals of F 1 progeny and its utility in genetics and breeding of silkworm Bombyx mor...|$|R

The mine is long and serpentine, in which the loosened epidermis is pale green and a black line of frass extends through the middle.

50|$|The larvae feed on Quercus species, {{including}} Q. prinus, Q. platanoides and Q. alba. They {{mine the}} leaves of their host plant. The mine is a whitish linear tract varying in length and width, with a black line of frass running through it. The frass is occasionally more or less dispersed {{in parts of the}} mine.

50|$|The larvae feed on Quercus palustris. They {{mine the}} leaves of their host plant. The egg {{is placed on the}} upper side of the leaf. The early portion of the mine is very narrow, {{completely}} filled with frass and bent several times in close S-shaped curves. Next, the larva mines just above the lower epidermis, forming a blotch scarcely visible above except for occasional spots here and there toward the edges of the blotch, where the leaf substance is more fully consumed. Then a conspicuous large blotch is formed where the mine is transparent and whitish, with frass accumulated toward the beginning of the blotch. The larvae are pale <b>green</b> and the <b>cocoon</b> is ochraceous.|$|R
40|$|Breeding {{experiments}} {{have questioned the}} status of the green (g) and pink (p) colour morphs of Allolobophora chlorotica. Should they become regarded as separate species, the name Allolobophora virescens (Savigny, 1826) is available for the pink form of this earthworm. Breeding experiments were established to investigate the status of this species utilising previously unmated laboratory-reared adults. Pairs were set up for 10 days to facilitate mating, separated and then maintained in isolation for 28 days to obtain individual reproduction results. Cocoon production and viability were first determined from intra-morphic (p×p and g×g) and inter-morphic (p×g) pairings. All p×p and g×g pairings bred true with mean cocoon production in g×g (4. 6 cocoons/worm/ 28 days) significantly greater (P< 0. 05) than in p×p (3. 2 cocoons/worm/ 28 days). In p×g pairings, both pink and <b>green</b> individuals produced <b>cocoons</b> (3. 9 and 5. 9 cocoons/worm/ 28 days, respectively). However here, viability of cocoons produced by g was very low at 6...|$|R
