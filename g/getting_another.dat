5|$|During their travels {{across the}} Wastelands, the player can be {{accompanied}} by a single non-player character (NPC) companion, who can assist in combat. Which companion can accompany the player depends on who they have encountered that can join them; it is possible to not encounter all depending on how the game is played. Only one companion may travel with the player, and should they wish to take another with them, the first must be dismissed (either voluntarily by the player or as a consequence of other events) or die in combat. One unique companion the player can have, that can allow a third to join without issue, is a dog named Dogmeat, who can be killed during the game if the player misuses him or places him in a severely dangerous situation; the release of the Broken Steel DLC, makes it possible to replace Dogmeat, provided the player acquires a Perk that grants the opportunity of <b>getting</b> <b>another</b> dog.|$|E
25|$|On December 16 at TLC, Kaitlyn {{competed in}} a number one contender's battle royal to face Eve for the championship, but was {{eliminated}} due to interference from Eve. After defeating Eve in a non-title match, Eve evaded several title matches against Kaitlyn by fleeing or attacking the referee to get disqualified. This resulted in Kaitlyn <b>getting</b> <b>another</b> title opportunity, with the stipulation that the title would change hands if Eve got disqualified or counted-out; on the 20th anniversary episode of Raw on January 14, Kaitlyn defeated Eve {{in her hometown of}} Houston, Texas, to win the Divas Championship.|$|E
25|$|Most Parisians {{belonged to}} the working class or the poor. There were some forty {{thousand}} domestic servants, mostly working for middle-class families. Most came from the provinces; only five percent were born in Paris. They lived with the families they served, and their living and working conditions depended entirely on character of their employers. They received very low wages, worked long hours, and if they lost their job, or if a woman became pregnant, they had little hope of <b>getting</b> <b>another</b> position. A {{large portion of the}} working poor, especially women and including many children, worked at home, sewing, embroidering, making lace, dolls, toys and other products for small shops.|$|E

25|$|There is no {{permanent}} heaven or hell in Hinduism. In the afterlife, based on one's karma, {{the soul is}} reborn as another being in heaven, hell, or a living being on earth (human, animal). Gods too die once their past karmic merit runs out, as do those in hell, and they return <b>getting</b> <b>another</b> chance on earth. This reincarnation continues, endlessly in cycles, until one embarks on a spiritual pursuit, realizes self-knowledge, and thereby gains mokṣa, the final release out of the reincarnation cycles. This release {{is believed to be}} a state of utter bliss, which Hindu traditions believe is either related or identical to Brahman, the unchanging reality that existed before the creation of universe, continues to exist, and shall exist after the universe ends.|$|E
25|$|Surrey Lions made 237 for 7 batting {{first at}} The Oval, despite three wickets from Malaysian Arul Suppiah. The stage {{was set for}} a bigger score with James Benning and Mark Butcher in with the score 135 for 1, but Suppiah and Ian Blackwell broke through with wickets to prevent high scoring rates towards the end. Somerset Sabres, and in {{particular}} Blackwell, were intent on winning this match. Blackwell hit six sixes and seven fours in a lightning-quick 88, adding 120 with James Hildreth for the fourth wicket before his eventual dismissal - to the part-time off spin of Mark Ramprakash. Despite Nayan Doshi <b>getting</b> <b>another</b> wicket, {{it was too late}} for Surrey, as Hildreth added 17 with William Durston to see them across the line with five overs to spare.|$|E
25|$|Dirkhising's death {{received}} only regional media coverage until a Washington Times article {{ran a story}} nearly a month after his death, noting the lack of national coverage in contrast to that given to the 1998 death of Matthew Shepard. The Shepard murder was approaching its first anniversary and was <b>getting</b> <b>another</b> round of national attention, coupled with updates on pending hate crime legislation. Prompted by coverage in The Washington Times, the Dirkhising case gained notoriety as conservative commentators compared {{media coverage of the}} two cases and explored the issues of what was considered a hate crime. The added attention resulted in mainstream media also reporting the Dirkhising case in relation to the coverage of the Shepard case, with many attempting to explain why the two were handled differently by the media, and perhaps received differently by readers.|$|E

25|$|At WrestleMania 21, Venis {{competed in}} a 30-man Interpromotional battle royal which was won by Booker T. In {{the summer of}} 2005 he formed another team, V-Squared, with Viscera. While wrestling on Heat, they {{squashed}} {{a number of other}} tag teams including the World Tag Team Champions Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch in a non-title match. On the December 5 episode of Raw, V-Squared participated in a fatal four way match for the World Tag Team Championship, including the champions Big Show and Kane, The Heart Throbs, and Snitsky and Tyson Tomko but were defeated. Venis and Viscera continued to team in 2006, <b>getting</b> <b>another</b> shot at Big Show and Kane's titles, while occasionally having solo matches.

25|$|Starting pitcher Max Scherzer joined an {{exclusive}} club of pitchers in a June 6 {{game against the}} Dodgers by striking out 11 batters through the first four innings of the game. The feat had only been accomplished by four other pitchers in major league history. Scherzer ultimately ended up with 14 strikeouts and zero earned runs through seven innings of a 2–1 Nationals victory. The Nationals dropped the last game of the series to Clayton Kershaw, the Dodgers' ace, to finish 7–2 on their California roadtrip. Washington's Stephen Strasburg, who took the loss despite giving up just one earned run over seven innings and striking out eight Dodgers, tied Kerry Wood's record for most strikeouts in the first 1,000 innings of a starting pitcher's career at 1,166 during the game. <b>Getting</b> <b>another</b> start after a pair of poor outings, Ross bounced back in a makeup game against the Baltimore Orioles in interleague play at Nationals Park on June 8, pitching 7⅓ innings and allowing one earned run for the win and setting a new personal best for strikeouts in a game with 12.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, {{a mysterious}} new witch comes into play, being {{revealed}} to be Crowley's mother, Rowena. Also, the angel Hannah goes back to Heaven so that her vessel can have her life back. A large focus of the season is Dean's quest to overcome the Mark of Cain and have it removed if possible. After the Mark causes him to break Charlie's arm, Sam suggests that Dean {{has the ability to}} at least partially control the Mark, but only if he can control himself. New hope for ridding Dean of the Mark comes when Charlie unearths the Book of the Damned. Sam needs help in reading and using this powerful tome, and turns to Rowena for help, keeping the entire thing a secret from Dean. He requests help from Charlie, too, who decodes the text but is murdered by the Steins, a family that has secretly controlled much of history. After massacring the Steins, nearly killing Castiel and <b>getting</b> <b>another</b> hunter killed, Dean starts despairing of being free of the Mark, causing him to turn to Death for help. Death proposes putting Dean in isolation away the Earth, but insists Dean must kill Sam, who otherwise would work to bring Dean back. Sam and Dean both agree that it is {{for the good of the}} world. At the last moment however, Dean seemingly kills Death instead to save Sam. Oblivious to the dangers, Rowena successfully casts the spell to remove the Mark and unleashes the Darkness, a primordial evil that had been kept away by the Mark. Rowena also places Castiel under a spell so he attacks Crowley as she escapes with the Book of the Damned.|$|E

500|$|Firefly {{consists}} of a two-hour pilot and thirteen one-hour episodes (with commercials). The series originally premiered in the United States on Fox in September 2002. The episodes were aired out of the intended order. Although Whedon had designed the show to run for seven years, low ratings resulted in cancellation by Fox in December 2002 after only 11 of the 14 completed episodes had aired in the United States. The three episodes unaired by Fox eventually debuted in 2003 on the Sci Fi Channel in the United Kingdom. Prior to cancellation, some fans, worried about low ratings, formed the Firefly Immediate Assistance campaign whose goal was to support {{the production of the}} show by sending in postcards to Fox. [...] After it was canceled, the campaign worked on <b>getting</b> <b>another</b> network such as UPN to pick up the series. The campaign was unsuccessful in securing the show's continuation.|$|E

500|$|Stan Love, Wilson's {{cousin and}} band manager, fired Landy in December 1976 when Landy doubled his fee. Landy remembered 15 Big Ones as [...] "the only major success" [...] the Beach Boys had in recent years; [...] "Brian and I did that together. Right after that, I {{had to leave}} the situation. ... I was {{interested}} in making Brian a whole human being; they [...] were interested in <b>getting</b> <b>another</b> album done in time for 1977." [...] In 1977, Wilson was asked if Landy had too much control; he said, [...] "I thought so, but there was nothing I could do about it and I eventually gave in to it.... control of my life legally through the commitment of my wife.... He definitely helped me. It cost over a hundred thousand dollars – he charged {{a hell of a lot}} per month." [...] Wilson then reported that Landy was replaced with a new doctor, Steve Schwartz. After several sessions with Wilson, Schwartz died in a camping accident, falling off a mountain to his death.|$|E
500|$|Frank Scheck, of the Hollywood Reporter, {{believed}} {{that even though}} Zombie's remake of Carpenter's Halloween was better than <b>getting</b> <b>another</b> sequel in the long running franchise it still was not comparable to the 1978 original. For Scheck, Zombie replaced Carpenter's building suspense, which made it so [...] "brilliant", with graphic violence and extended scenes of nudity; he also criticized McDowell for lacking the intensity that Donald Pleasence brought to the Loomis character. By contrast, TV Guide's Ken Fox felt that Zombie did deliver a [...] "scary horror movie", not by copying Carpenter, but by making the film his own. Fox noted that Zombie seemed to follow more {{in the footsteps of}} Wes Craven and Tobe Hooper's [...] "savage, greasy-haired '70s" [...] films, which allowed him to bring Michael back to his roots and successfully terrify an audience which has grown accustomed to the recent [...] "torture porn" [...] horror films. Bill Gibron, of PopMatters, believes that audiences and critics cannot compare Carpenter's film to Zombie's remake; where Carpenter focused more on the citizens of Haddonfield—with Michael acting as a true [...] "boogeyman"—Zombie focuses more on Michael himself, successfully forcing the audience to experience all of the elements that Michael went through that would result in his [...] "desire for death".|$|E
