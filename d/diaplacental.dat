40|$|Porcine placentae from 18 to 114 days of {{gestation}} {{were investigated}} histologically, histochemically and immunohistochemically. The placenta was histologically {{divided into four}} areas : the chorionic fossa (CF), chorionic ridge (CR), regular areola (RA) and irregular areola (IRA). The IRA was further subdivided into fetal IRA, maternal depression and ruffled area of the maternal depression (RAMD). In histochemical analysis, a reaction product suggestive of acid mucopolysaccharides was detected exclusively in the uterine and chorionic epithelia of the IRA. In immunohistochemical analysis, the localization of IgG and IgM was demonstrated in the endometrial lamina propria mucosae, and the epithelia of the RAMD and fetal IRA. Regional IgG and IgM localization was identical {{to that of the}} acid mucopolysaccharides. In the fetal lymphatic tissues, a small number of IgG-containing cells was first noted at 114 days of gestation. In a serological survey, IgG and IgM were demonstrated at a constant level in all fetal sera from days 40 to 114 of gestation, although IgA was negative except for 2 of 23 sera from fetuses. Comparing the relative levels of maternal immunoglobulins (Igs), the fetal Igs were 1 / 200 in IgG and 1 / 500 in IgM. These results suggest that there is a possible <b>diaplacental</b> transition of IgG and IgM from the mother into the fetus occurring via epithelia exclusively at the RAMD and the fetal IRA...|$|E
40|$|Dedicated to Professor Dr. Dr. Ernst Schütte on the {{occasion}} of his 75 th birthday Summary: Pregnant rats were fed diets with an Mg 2 + content of 40, 12, 6 and 3 mmol/kg from day 10 - 19 of pregnancy. There was a linear correlation of non-protein bound Mg 2 + between foetal and maternal serum, between amniotic fluid and maternal serum, and between foetal serum and amniotic fluid, the ratios being 2. 7, 2. 0 and 1. 3 respectively, indicating active transport of Mg 2 + üp to a constant concentration gradient by the placenta. In hearts, increases of Na" 1 " and Ca 2 +, and decreases of Mg 24 " and K+ were observed only in the group receiving the lowest Mg 2 " 1 " supply. After i. v. injection of MgQh to pregnant rats, Mg 2 + was slowly transported from maternal to foetal serum and more slowly into the amniotic fluid. The effect of isoproterenol on cardiac electrolyte content in pregnant rats was less than in non-pregnant rats, and the effect of isoproterenol in foetal rats was smaller than in maternal rats. These results are explained by inactivation of isoproterenol in the plaeenta, by the small <b>diaplacental</b> transport of isoproterenol and by a smaller isoproterenol-stimulation of foetal cardiac adenylate cyclase.

40|$|SUMMARY- 7, 12 -Dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) adrnlnls-tered iv to {{pregnant}} Sprague-Dawley rats produeed eerebellar malfunction in {{at least}} 10 % of the offspring. The underlying morphologie basis of the eerebellar sympromatology was found in maldevelopment of eerebellar cortex, ranging from focal loss of granule and Purkinje's eell layers to extensive areas of eortieal disorganization with lasses of granule neurons. An interferenee {{with the proliferation of}} the granule eell-Iayer primordium was suggested as a mechanism of this eerebellar dysgenesis. After a 200 -day observation, no tumors were found in the offspring of the DMBA-treated, pregnant rats. -J Natl Cancer Inst 56 : 1063 - 1067, 1976. In numerous experimental models, exposure to en-vironmental carcinogens has induced tumors not only in the exposed individuals but also in their ofIspring. It seems that tumor incidence in the progeny increases when some carcinogens are administered during late pregnancy (1). In most experiments, the pups nursed on their own, carcinogen-treated mothers, which might confuse the distinction between prenatal and postnatal exposure (2). It has been repeatedly reported that car-cinogens given to a pregnant animal can produce tera-togenic efIects in the ofIspring as weIl (3); the organo-tropy of the carcinogen in the embryo may be retained or changed. 7,I 2 -Dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA), a widely used carcinogen for experimental models, be-longs to the group of hydrocarbons present in tobacco smoke and combustion engine exhausts (4). In an experiment designed for the investigation of the <b>diaplacental</b> efIects of DMBA in rats, severe cerebellar dysfunction was observed in the offspring of carcinogen-treated mothers. The morphologic basis of this cerebellar dysfunction is described and discussed in the following report...|$|E
