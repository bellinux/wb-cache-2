25|$|In March 2015, {{one of its}} units {{was sold}} for a whopping price of HK$433 million, with the price per sqft. amounting to HK$93,000. This {{supersedes}} the HK$82,000 price per sq.ft. record set by Swire Properties’ Opus Hong Kong and throughout Asia in 2012. Although it was sold at a higher price of HK$439 million in 2009, the lower stamp <b>duty</b> <b>rate</b> at the time resulted in a lower price per square foot. The buyer is confirmed to be a non-Hong Kong resident and therefore the stamp duty payable represents a total of 23.5%, which means the buyer {{will have to pay}} over HK$100 million in stamp duty expenses.|$|E
2500|$|The fuel {{protests in}} the United Kingdom were {{a series of}} campaigns held {{because of the cost}} of rising petrol and diesel fuel prices for road vehicle use. There have been three notable campaigns amongst many other protests in the 21st century. The first major protest in 2000 was {{primarily}} led by independent truck owner-operators. One group of truck owner-operators from the South East of England formed a protest group called [...] "TransAction" [...] that protested at oil refineries and fuel depots in Essex. Protests and blockades of oil facilities caused widespread disruption to the supply of petroleum products. The aim of the protests was to secure a reduction in the fuel <b>duty</b> <b>rate</b> on petrol and diesel, which the government refused to enact. After the protest ended, the government did announce a freeze on fuel duties, and promised changes would be made to the way that goods vehicles were taxed, which would include the taxing of foreign vehicles operating on British roads.|$|E

40|$|Different motives in {{determining}} the level and structure of alcohol taxes lead to greatly varying alcohol excise duty levels. The aim {{of this paper is}} to look at alcohol excise <b>duty</b> <b>rates</b> in European Union (EU) and the mechanisms affecting them. Also the trends in alcohol prices and alcohol consumption will be discussed. Material. Material concerning alcohol taxes and consumption comes from available statistics and published literature. Results. This paper shows that despite many attempts the EU has not been able to harmonise alcohol excise <b>duty</b> <b>rates</b> in its member states. The importance of alcohol taxes as an alcohol control measure has decreased as the real value of alcohol excise <b>duty</b> <b>rates</b> has decreased in most EU countries during the last decades. Discussion. In most European countries the share of alcohol taxes of the price of alcoholic beverages is quite low. Therefore, increasing alcohol excise <b>duty</b> <b>rates</b> would in most countries lead to increased alcohol tax revenues to the public sector. Consequently, increasing alcohol excise <b>duty</b> <b>rates</b> would serve both the fiscal and the health and social policy interests of the state...|$|R

50|$|Inverted tariff {{benefits}} exist {{when the}} <b>duty</b> <b>rate</b> {{for the overall}} finished good {{is lower than the}} <b>duty</b> <b>rate</b> of the component parts. Therefore, by manufacturing finished goods within an FTZ, US importers {{can take advantage of the}} inverted tariff <b>duty</b> <b>rate,</b> all while keeping manufacturing operations within the US. Inverted tariff works when an importer with manufacturing authority within an FTZ is allowed to admit their components into the zone duty-free, manufacture the finished good, and pay CBP duties on the foreign content in the finished good at the lower <b>duty</b> <b>rate</b> of the finished goods at the time of entry. The importer avoids paying the higher <b>duty</b> <b>rate</b> on the component parts and defers the lower duty payment on the value of the foreign content until the time of consumption in the commerce of the US. Inverted tariff is seen predominantly in the manufacturing industry, benefiting automotive, petroleum, pharmaceutical, aerospace, electronics, textile companies and many more.|$|E

40|$|A central {{feature of}} the {{constitutional}} changes imposed {{at the time of}} Federation in 1901 was the “fiscal union ” of the six States. This union involved the abolition of tariffs on trade between the States, the harmonisation of the tariff rates and of the excise <b>duty</b> <b>rates</b> of the former six Colonies, and the establishment of the financial arrangements to distribute the surplus net customs and excise revenues among the States. This paper examines these four elements of the fiscal union. It provides, for the first time, a measure of the change in the level of tariff duties imposed on imports from outside the Commonwealth and in excise duties. The harmonisation of the customs <b>duty</b> <b>rates</b> increased the average <b>rate</b> of customs <b>duty</b> on dutiable imports from outside the Commonwealth by about 36 per cent while the harmonisation of the excise <b>duty</b> <b>rates</b> maintained the rates at about the mid-point of these rates in the colonies. The four aspects of fiscal union are intimately connected and together they laid the foundations of assistance policy, commodity taxation and Commonwealth-Stat...|$|R
40|$|The {{constitutional}} changes {{imposed on}} the States {{at the time of}} Federation in Australia required the harmonisation of the excise tax rates of the former colonies as well as the harmonisation of <b>rates</b> of tariff <b>duty.</b> Each Colony had its own excise rate system. Excise rates were a major source of revenue for the Colonies and for the Commonwealth but the harmonisation of the excise <b>duty</b> <b>rates</b> has not been studied. This paper outlines the excise tax systems of the Colonies before Federation and that of the Commonwealth after Federation. Estimates are made of the consumer tax equivalent rates and of the rates of protection which were implicit in the excise cum tariff systems in each Colony before Federation and in the Commonwealth after Federation. I find that the Commonwealth government harmonised the excise tax rates of the colonies at about the mid-points of the rates of the Colonies. The implicit rates of protection, however, increased after Federation because the higher customs <b>duty</b> <b>rates</b> were combined with the constant excise <b>duty</b> <b>rates.</b> The paper also traces how the Commonwealth excise tax system evolved from the colonial systems of excise taxation...|$|R
5000|$|The new tariff {{provisions}} for wool and woolen goods were exceedingly protectionist. Wool was previously taxed {{based on a}} schedule, meaning that more valuable wool was taxed at a higher rate. Through a multitude of complicated tariff schedule revisions, the act made almost all woolen goods subject to the maximum <b>duty</b> <b>rate.</b> [...] Further, the act increased the tariff on carpet wool, a wool of very low quality that is not produced in the US. The government wanted to ensure that importers were not declaring higher quality wool as carpet wool to evade the tariff.|$|E

50|$|The U.S International Trade Commission ruled 6-0 {{in favor}} of Whirlpool, finding that the U.S washing machine {{industry}} was threatened by imports of residential washers from South Korea. Also, the commission stated South Korean producers, Daewoo, LG, and Samsung were dumping washing machines far below their market value. Investigation into the matter led to the finding that LG and Samsung's market sales in the United States were found significantly different and the differences were not taken into account using the average-to-average method. A countervailing duty of over 72 percent was set for Daewoo, while the two other South Korean companies were given much smaller duties of below two percent. LG Electronics Inc. faced a dumping margin of 13.02, while Samsung Electronics Co.

5000|$|The {{changes in}} Stamp Duty rates in 1974, 1984, and 1986 {{provided}} researchers with [...] "natural experiments", {{allowing them to}} measure the impact of transaction taxes on market volume, volatility, returns, and valuations of UK companies listed on the London Stock Exchange. Jackson and O'Donnel (1985), using UK quarterly data, found that the 1% cut in the Stamp Duty in April 1984 from 2% to 1% lead to a [...] "dramatic 70% increase in equity turnover". Analyzing all three Stamp <b>Duty</b> <b>rate</b> changes, Saporta and Kan (1997) found that the announcements of tax rate increases (decreases) were followed by negative (positive) returns, but even though these results were statistically significant, they {{were likely to be}} influenced by other factors, because the announcements were made on Budget Days. Bond et al. (2005) confirmed the findings of previous studies, noting also that the impact of the announced tax rate cuts was more beneficial (increasing market value more significantly) in case of larger firms, which had higher turnover, and were therefore more affected by the transaction tax than stocks of smaller companies, less frequently traded.|$|E

50|$|In the Republic of Ireland {{stamp duties}} are levied on various items {{including}} (but not limited to) credit cards, debit cards, ATM cards, cheques, property transfers, and certain court documents. Stamp duty was formerly a graduated progressive tax with more expensive the house bought {{the greater the}} stamp <b>duty</b> <b>rate.</b> The top rate slowly increased from 0.5% in 1882 to 3% in 1947, 5% in 1973, 6% in 1975, reaching its peak at 9% in 1997. The budget of 2008 inaugurated a series of rate reductions. After 2011 the stamp duty tax is set at 1% for residential properties up to €1 million and 2% on the remaining amount. Non-residential real property, building, insurance policies, the intangible business property goodwill are taxed at 2%. A lease for property of any type is taxed according to the lease duration, 1% of the average annual rent, or the market rate whichever is greater, if 35 years or less, 6% up to 100 years, and 12% for a lease of more than 100 years duration. Counterparts (duplicate copies) of documents are taxed the lesser of €12.50 or the duty on the original document. The value of property for stamp duty excludes VAT. Gifts are taxed at market value. Several exemptions including those for gifts between close relatives and first time home buyers expired in 2010. The transfer of stocks and marketable securities is taxed at 1% if over €1,000 or if a gift. Stock warrants in bearer form are taxed at 3% {{of the value of}} the shares, and the issue of (new) bearer warrants was prohibited effective 1 June 2015.|$|E
50|$|Before the 1960s it was {{relatively}} easy to get planning permission, but that changed in the year 1963 when the highly restrictive Planning Act was passed. This placed exceptional powers {{in the hands of}} newly appointed officials. Since this act was introduced it has been blamed as the principal factor of the upswing of Irish political corruption in the years after. This was proved in the following few years when Charlie Haughey, the Minister for Finance and Liam Lawlor, a TD from the Lucan area, both received planning permission for huge housing estates on land in which they owned.The Kenny Report of 1974 attempted to bring an effective end to land speculation by nationalizing all building land, putting a capital gains tax on any profit made from the disposal of land and placing a high stamp <b>duty</b> <b>rate</b> on the transfer of any land suitable for building but Fianna Fáil, the government at the time, refused to accept any of these, or the 9 other, recommendations that were made in the report, as it was against their best interests.Another corruption tribunal was brought to court in 1975, this one involving a Labour TD from Co. Meath, James Tully. Mr. Tully, who was the minister for local government at the time, was the subject of much suspicion regarding several planning decisions made in his name. These decisions were given the name “Tully permissions” and went completely against rules regarding proper planning. The year before, Tully was also accused of “Tullymandering”, a take off of gerrymandering, which involves rearranging electoral boundaries to benefit a particular political party. This tribunal was brought into being to investigate these matters and also his apparent improper relationship with a certain building contractor, Bobby Farrelly, and when the trial was over, he was cleared of any wrongdoing.|$|E
