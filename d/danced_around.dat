5|$|Darcus Allen, {{a convicted}} murderer who {{previously}} served in an Arkansas prison with Clemmons, was allegedly {{present for the}} conversation. Also on Thanksgiving, Clemmons cut off a GPS monitor which Jail Sucks Bail Bonds had secured onto his ankle. On November 28, Clemmons showed two handguns to friends Eddie and Douglas Davis and told them he planned to shoot police officers with them; the exchange was witnessed by Clemmons' half-brother Rickey Hinton, with whom he shared a house. During the exchange, Clemmons <b>danced</b> <b>around</b> with the guns in his hands, claiming to be Lucifer. He told the men he had twice tried {{to go to a}} Tacoma police station, where he planned to walk in and start shooting. The first time the station was closed, and the second time he got a flat tire on the way there, Clemmons claimed.

500|$|Prior to {{the nineteenth}} century, the term would have simply meant country song, with no {{particular}} form implied—a meaning it retains in {{the vocabulary of}} early music. According to Julie Kane, the refrain in each stanza indicates that the form descended from a [...] "choral dance song" [...] wherein a vocal soloist—frequently female—semi-improvised the [...] "unique" [...] lyrics of each stanza, while a ring of dancers—all female, or male and female mixed—chimed in with the repetitive words of the refrain as they <b>danced</b> <b>around</b> her in a circle." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{order to}} promote [...] "Everybody," [...] Madonna {{performed}} the track with backup dancers at Haoui Montaug's [...] "No Entiendes" [...] – a roving cabaret revue. In The Virgin Tour of 1985, Madonna wore a blue see-through crop-top which revealed her black bra, a purple skirt, lacy leggings and a brightly patterned jacket. She also wore crucifixes in her hair, and on her ears and neck. As the performance of [...] "Into the Groove" [...] ended, Madonna took the microphone and <b>danced</b> <b>around</b> the stage while singing [...] "Everybody".

500|$|In 2015, while {{appearing}} on The Ellen DeGeneres Show {{as part of}} promotion for her thirteenth studio album, Rebel Heart, Madonna and host Ellen DeGeneres sang the song during a revival of DeGeneres' bathroom concert series. They were dressed in matching robes and sang the song while sitting on a chair, adding commentary in between. At one point, Madonna removed the robe to reveal another dress with prints of hearts on it, and <b>danced</b> <b>around</b> DeGeneres, who also used props like oversized sunglasses and a leopard print cowboy hat for Madonna. The song was later included in the setlist of the Rebel Heart Tour, performed in a flamenco-style medley with [...] "Into the Groove", [...] "Everybody" [...] and [...] "Lucky Star". During the sequence the singer dressed in a Latin and gypsy inspired dress, created by Alessandro Michele for Gucci, consisting off a shawl, flamenco hat, lace, skirts and jacquard bodysuit.|$|E
500|$|During the {{backwards}} guitar solo, Frusciante {{was filmed}} waving a large aluminum ribbon; Kiedis was initially apprehensive about Sednaoui's {{desire for the}} guitarist to do so, believing he would tell the director [...] "'Fuck you and take that dancing ribbon and shove it up your French ass, buddy' but [...] gladly went off and made love to the air with this dancing ribbon. He would have <b>danced</b> <b>around</b> for hours with that thing." [...] The footage was edited in reverse to complement the solo. While some of the scenes in the video were planned with a storyboard, {{much of it was}} improvised or made up on the spot over the two-day shoot. During a particular scene Kiedis began to move his tongue flamboyantly to dramatically accentuate the lyrics, which Sednaoui believed was extremely beneficial to the exuberant nature of the video. Where the video begins in {{what appears to be the}} daytime, it concludes at dusk with silhouettes of the band members running into the setting sun.|$|E

The head is taken to the temple of Kali, where is it [...] "revived". In a ceremony called vitaiyatti ("the return dance"), the head is once more <b>danced</b> <b>around</b> the village, right up until early morning on the 17thday. On the 18th and final day, the head is decorated and paraded around the village a final time.

500|$|Madonna has {{performed}} the song on four of her world tours. She premiered {{the song in}} 1987, during her Who's That Girl World Tour, where she <b>danced</b> <b>around</b> the stage wearing a white Spanish-style dress designed by Marlene Stewart, and a black leather jacket {{similar to the one}} she used in the music video. The screen in the background showed portraits of Pope John Paul II and then-President of the US Ronald Reagan, along with scenes of John Perry III's short film, The Nightmare, ending with the words [...] "Safe Sex", as Madonna finished the song.

Two different performances of the song on this tour {{can be found on the}} videos: Who's That Girl: Live in Japan, filmed in Tokyo, Japan, on June 22, 1987, and , filmed in Turin, Italy, on September 4, 1987.|$|E
500|$|Two filmed {{scenes from}} [...] "The One with the Cast of Night Court" [...] were cut {{out from the}} airing.

500|$|Assessments vary as {{to whether}} Anderson was a {{deliberate}} impostor, delusional, traumatized into adopting a new identity, or someone used by her supporters for their own ends. Pierre Gilliard denounced Anderson as [...] "a cunning psychopath". The equation of Anderson {{with members of the}} imperial family began with Clara Peuthert in the Dalldorf Asylum, rather than with Anderson herself. Anderson appeared {{to go along with it}} afterwards. Writer Michael Thornton thought, [...] "Somewhere along the way she lost and rejected Schanzkowska. She lost that person totally and accepted completely she was this new person. I think it happened by accident and she was swept along on a wave of euphoria." [...] Lord Mountbatten, a first cousin of the Romanov children, thought her supporters [...] "simply get rich on the royalties of further books, magazine articles, plays etc." [...] Prince Michael Romanov, a grandson of Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia, stated the Romanov family always knew Anderson was a fraud, and that the family looked upon her and [...] "the three-ringed circus which <b>danced</b> <b>around</b> her, creating books and movies, as a vulgar insult to the memory of the Imperial Family." ...|$|E
500|$|On April 1, 2009, {{both the}} {{acoustic}} and normal version of [...] "Poker Face" [...] was performed live on Fox's American Idol. The performance started with Gaga {{sitting at a}} Plexiglass piano filled with bubbles and bathed in pink light. She started singing the second verse of [...] "Poker Face" [...] in a Bette Midler style accompanied by a violin player while wearing a shiny aluminum shoulder pad and platinum bleached blond wig. After the first chorus, the pace increased whence the original intro for the song started. Gaga got up from her seat and proceeded to perform the song {{in the middle of}} the stage. She wore a silvery leotard with a giant star on her shoulder and tassels. As the song progressed to the intermediate verse, the violinist played a hoe-down version of the music and Gaga <b>danced</b> <b>around</b> frantically over the stage. The performance ended with Gaga staring towards the audience while revealing an open zipper, patched over her left eye. The performance was described an [...] "alien-disco performance art." [...] Cortney Harding of Billboard wrote, [...] " [...] Gaga's crowning TV moment ... show middle America that she was a bona fide pop star." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 1957, Monk {{began to}} perform at the venue for six months with saxophonist John Coltrane, bassist Ahmed Abdul-Malik, and drummer Shadow Wilson in his group. However, by the time Monk's {{employment}} there ended in December, he had lost Wilson to poor health, while Coltrane left {{in pursuit of a}} solo career and a return to Miles Davis's group. After returning to New York City's club scene with a new quartet, Monk received an eight-week offer from Joe and Iggy Termini to play the Five Spot Café beginning on June 12, 1958. He played most nights during the weekend to capacity crowds with Abdul-Malik, drummer Roy Haynes, and tenor saxophonist Johnny Griffin, who had performed with Monk before. Griffin was unfamiliar with all of his repertoire and, like Coltrane, found it difficult to solo over Monk's comping during their first few weeks: [...] "Any deviation, one note off, and you sound like you're playing another tune, and you're not paying attention to what's going on. And it's so evident ... there's no space." [...] During their performances, Monk often left the stage for a drink at the bar or <b>danced</b> <b>around,</b> which gave Griffin an opportunity to play with more space. However, the quartet eventually developed a sufficient rapport and grasp of the set list.|$|E
