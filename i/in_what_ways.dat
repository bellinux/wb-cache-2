25|$|Many modern {{historical}} {{scholars have}} focused on the timing and the formation of the Mishnah. A vital question is whether it is composed of sources which date from its editor's lifetime, and to what extent is it composed of earlier, or later sources. Are Mishnaic disputes distinguishable along theological or communal lines, and <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>ways</b> do different sections derive from different schools of thought within early Judaism? Can these early sources be identified, and if so, how? In response to these questions, modern scholars have adopted a number of different approaches.|$|E
25|$|It {{is unclear}} <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>ways</b> silica is {{important}} in the nutrition of animals. This field of research is challenging because silica is ubiquitous and in most circumstances dissolves in trace quantities only. All the same it certainly does occur in the living body, leaving us with the problem {{that it is hard to}} create proper silica-free controls for purposes of research. This makes it difficult to be sure when the silica present has had operative beneficial effects, and when its presence is coincidental, or even harmful. The current consensus is that it certainly seems important in the growth, strength, and management of many connective tissues. This is true not only for hard connective tissues such as bone and tooth but possibly in the biochemistry of the subcellular enzyme-containing structures as well.|$|E

60|$|How to live?--that is the {{essential}} question for us. Not how {{to live in the}} mere material sense only, but in the widest sense. The general problem which comprehends every special problem is--the right ruling of conduct in all directions under all circumstances. <b>In</b> <b>what</b> <b>way</b> to treat the body; <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>way</b> to treat the mind; <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>way</b> to manage our affairs; <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>way</b> to bring up a family; <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>way</b> to behave as a citizen; <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>way</b> to utilise those sources of happiness which nature supplies--how to use all our faculties to the greatest advantage of ourselves and others--how to live completely? And this being the great thing needful for us to learn, is, by consequence, the great thing which education has to teach. To prepare us for complete living is the function which education has to discharge; and the only rational mode of judging of an educational course is, to judge <b>in</b> <b>what</b> degree it discharges such function.|$|R

2500|$|Historical {{study of}} the Talmud {{can be used to}} {{investigate}} a variety of concerns. One can ask questions such as: Do a given section's sources date from its editor's lifetime? To what extent does a section have earlier or later sources? Are Talmudic disputes distinguishable along theological or communal lines? <b>In</b> <b>what</b> <b>ways</b> do different sections derive from different schools of thought within early Judaism?

2500|$|Processualism's {{development}} transformed archaeology, and {{is sometimes}} called the [...] "New Archaeology." [...] With few notable exceptions such as Boston University, universities in America classify archaeology as a sub-discipline of anthropology, while in Europe it {{is thought to be}} a subject more like historical studies. It is important to analyze which sciences are close kin because such analysis highlights the questions of what archaeology ought to study and <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>ways.</b> Like the other social scientists, the New Archaeologists or processualists wanted to utilize scientific methodology in their work. Archaeology, and in particular archaeology of the historical period, has sometimes been allied more with humanities disciplines such as Classics. The question of where to put archaeology as a discipline, and its concomitant issues of what archaeology ought to study and which methods it ought to use, likely played no small part in the emergence of post-processualism in Europe.|$|E

2500|$|The term [...] "Being-with" [...] {{refers to}} an ontological {{characteristic}} of the human being, that it is always already with others of its kind. This assertion is to be understood not as a factual statement about an individual, {{that he or she}} is at the moment in spatial proximity to one or more other individuals. [...] Rather it is a statement about the being of every human, that in the structures of its being-in-the-world one finds an implicit reference to other humans. We all live with others, and in fact we could not live without them. Humans have been called (by others, not by Heidegger) [...] "ultrasocial" [...] and [...] "obligatorily gregarious." [...] Without others of our kind we could not survive. Heidegger, from his phenomenological perspective, calls this feature of human life [...] "Being-with" [...] (Mitsein), and says it is essential to being human. We are inauthentic when we fail to recognize how much and <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>ways</b> how we think of ourselves and how we habitually behave is influenced by our social surroundings. We are authentic when we pay attention to that influence and decide for ourselves whether to go along with it or not. Living entirely without such influence, however, is not an option.|$|E
2500|$|Just as he {{challenged}} the dominant analytic–synthetic distinction, Quine also {{took aim at}} traditional normative epistemology. [...] According to Quine, traditional epistemology tried to justify the sciences, but this effort (as exemplified by Rudolf Carnap) failed, and so we should replace traditional epistemology with an empirical study of what sensory inputs produce what theoretical outputs.: [...] "Epistemology, or something like it, simply falls into place as a chapter of psychology and hence of natural science. It studies a natural phenomenon, viz., a physical human subject. This human subject is accorded a certain experimentally controlled input — certain patterns of irradiation in assorted frequencies, for instance — and in the fullness of time the subject delivers as output {{a description of the}} three-dimensional external world and its history. The relation between the meager input and the torrential output is a relation that we are prompted to study for somewhat the same reasons that always prompted epistemology: namely, in order to see how evidence relates to theory, and <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>ways</b> one's theory of nature transcends any available evidence...But a conspicuous difference between old epistemology and the epistemological enterprise in this new psychological setting is that we can now make free use of empirical psychology."

6000|$|Well, {{probably}} enough; too probably! But what it more concerns us {{to remember}} here, is the fact, That in these dismal shufflings which have been, Pitt--{{in spite of}} Royal dislikes and Newcastle peddlings and chicaneries--has been actually in Office, in the due topmost place, the poor English Nation ardently demanding him, <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>ways</b> it could.

Without real power, we say; and has had no permanency. Came in 11th-19th November, 1756; thrown out 5th April, 1757. After six months' trial, the St. Vitus finds that it cannot do with him; and will prefer going on again. The last act his Royal Highness of Cumberland did in England was to displace Pitt: [...] "Down you, I am the man!" [...] said Royal Highness; and went to the Weser Countries on those terms.|$|E

60|$|Greatness[17] of {{dimension}} {{is a powerful}} cause of the sublime. This is too evident, and the observation too common, to need any illustration; {{it is not so}} common to consider <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>ways</b> greatness of dimension, vastness of extent or quantity, has the most striking effect. For, certainly, there are ways and modes wherein the same quantity of extension shall produce greater effects than it is found to do in others. Extension is either in length, height, or depth. Of these the length strikes least; a hundred yards of even ground will never work such an effect as a tower a hundred yards high, or a rock or mountain of that altitude. I am apt to imagine, likewise, that height is less grand than depth; and that we are more struck at looking down from a precipice, than looking up at an object of equal height; but of that I am not very positive. A perpendicular has more force in forming the sublime, than an inclined plane, and the effects of a rugged and broken surface seem stronger than where it is smooth and polished. It would carry us out of our way to enter in this place into the cause of these appearances, but certain it is they afford a large and fruitful field of speculation. However, it may not be amiss to add to these remarks upon magnitude, that as the great extreme of {{dimension is}} sublime, so the last extreme of littleness is in some measure sublime likewise; when we attend to the infinite divisibility of matter, when we pursue animal life into these excessively small, and yet organized beings, that escape the nicest inquisition of the sense; when we push our discoveries yet downward, and consider those creatures so many degrees yet smaller, and the still diminishing scale of existence, in tracing which the imagination is lost as well as the sense; we become amazed and confounded at the wonders of minuteness; nor can we distinguish in its effect this extreme of littleness from the vast itself. For division must be infinite as well as addition; because the idea of a perfect unity can no more be arrived at, than that of a complete whole, to which nothing may be added.|$|E
