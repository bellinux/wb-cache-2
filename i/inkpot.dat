5|$|Gimbal: The gimbal {{is known}} as the 'Cardan' {{suspension}} after Italian polymath Gerolamo Cardano (1501–1576), yet it was known long before him. The British scientist Joseph Needham writes that the earliest confirmed use of gimbals in Europe is the 9th century recipe book Little Key of Painting and Belgian chemist and historian of science Mappae clavicula, which mentioned a vase surrounded by rings which allowed it to be undisturbed when in a rolling motion. Needham and BGeorge Sarton both write that an Arabic translation—dated to roughly the era of Al-Ma'mun (r. 813–833)—of an ancient Greek work now lost (i.e. Pneumatica) by 3rd-century BC Greek engineer Philo of Byzantium (c. 280– c. 220 BC) contains a description of gimbals used to support an <b>inkpot</b> that could wet a pen on any of its sides, yet Needham suspects Arabic interpolation and doubts total authenticity, while Sarton asserts {{that for the most part}} the Arabic translation is faithful to Philo's lost original, hence Philo should be credited with the invention of the gimbal. Around 180 AD, the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) inventor and mechanical engineer Ding Huan (丁緩) — who also created a rotary fan and zoetrope lamp—invented a 'Perfume Burner for use among Cushions', or 'Bedclothes Censer'. This incense burner had a series of metal rings which could be moved in any direction while the burner in the middle remained constantly level. This is the first clear reference in China of the gimbal, although there is a hint in the writing of Sima Xiangru (179–117 BC) that this device existed in the 2nd century BC (i.e., 'the metal rings burning perfume'). The gimbal incense burner is mentioned in subsequent dynasties, while silverwork specimens of gimbal incense burners from the Tang Dynasty (618–907) still exist. In the Liang Dynasty (502–557) there is mention of gimbals used in hinges for doors and windows, while an unnamed artisan presented a warming stove to Empress Wu Zetian (r. 690–705) in 692 which employed gimbals to keep it constantly balanced.|$|E

Erskine constructed a large shellac and lac dye factory at Ilambazar and as Cheap retired from the field, virtually monopolized it.

Lac artisans, locally called nuris, worked out a variety of lacquered items namely, cups, <b>inkpots,</b> bracelets and toys ‘of excellent design and craftsmanship’. Some of the ornamental items were sent to the Great Paris Exhibition of 1855. However, Sherwill noted that ornamental items were manufactured at Ilambazar by only two men.

25|$|The Apparition did {{not speak}} until the third appearance, and {{therefore}} its identity {{was a matter of}} considerable speculation. Pious villagers Jeanne-Marie Milhet and Antoinette Peyret, on hearing Soubirous' description of the apparition, thought it was the returning spirit of one of their friends, who had died a few months before. Although not part of Catholic doctrine, the concept of the revenant was deeply rooted in Pyrenean superstition. According to tradition, revenants rarely spoke, but communicated their messages in writing, and so Milhet and Peyret furnished Soubirous with paper, a pen, and an <b>inkpot</b> to take with her, in case the apparition should make use of them.|$|E

40|$|I haven’t seen Aldous {{book and}} I {{do not want}} to. The idea bores me so terribly and I won’t waste time on it. The only {{reviewer}} who really realised its dullness was Rebecca West. She said just what was right – she shuddered at the silliness of it. But everybody else seems to puff him up. It gets very awkward if young men are forced to feed out of their friends <b>inkpots</b> in this way. In fact I confess it downright disgusts me’ [all sic]. Thus wrote Katherine Mansfield to Ottoline Morrell in January 1922, discussing Aldous Huxley’s novel Crome Yellow (1921). Ottoline herself had been wounded by its descriptions of ‘our life at Garsington, all distorted, caricatured and mocked at [ [...] . ]. I was filled with dismay’. And yet everyone in the Garsington and Bloomsbury sets, and those writers like Mansfield and D. H. Lawrence, for example, who found themselves {{on the fringes of}} both, continually fed ‘out of their friends inkpots’ for fictional copy. For example, the character of Eddie Warren from one of Mansfield’s most celebrated stories, ‘Bliss’ (1918), is a caricature of Huxley, and Pearl Fulton in the same story is almost certainly based on Virginia Woolf. The relationship between Mansfield’s husband John Middleton Murry and Huxley is well documented. David Goldie notes that ‘Murry began the post-war period with the critical world at his feet but ended it as something of a doormat’, exemplified by Huxley’s lampooning of Murry as the hypocritical character of Burlap in Point Counter Point (1928). However, the connection between Mansfield and Huxley has always remained rather a footnote to {{the relationship between the two}} men. This chapter seeks to redress such an imbalance. Huxley’s initial acquaintance with Mansfield led to dinners and private visits recorded by both parties, and to the fictionalising of each other in their creative writing. What emerges is a difficult relationship, blighted almost from the start by the friendships – and enmities – of those around them...|$|R
