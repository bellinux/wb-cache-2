40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityThe chief {{problem of}} this {{research}} was to study by standard sensitometric procedures the effects of intensity, time and wavelength on the amount of speed increase which might be obtained from four representative slow, regular, high, and extra <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>emulsions</b> (Royal Pan, Aerial Recon type 1 -B Class L, Plus X and Microfile) by latensification. Latensification has been defined simply as a process applied after exposure and before development to increase the speed or sensitivity (reciprocal of the exposure required to produce a given result) of an emulsion. A secondary purpose was to examine latensification of a very slow, fine grain emulsion for possible use in small high quality aerial camera systems, in which the emulsion graininess is the limiting factor when used with conventional <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>emulsions.</b> The latensification method in this case was post-exposure to radiation from 0. 36 to 0. 68 microns. This spectral range was divided into four bands by the Wratten Filters # 25 A, 58 and 47 B, (red, green and blue respectively) and the Corning 7 - 54, ultraviolet. White light was also used. A tungsten lamp of constant intensity, combined with a ground glass and two inch opal glass disk diffuser produced a source of uniform illumination. Normally exposed sensitometric strips were then subject to laten sification by exposure to radiation in which the spectral region, intensity, and time were varied. Each emulsion was subject to four spectral regions plus white light and four intensity levels for each region. The exposure was then extended over a range of time believed sufficient to reach a peak speed increase for that intensity. Reciprocity failure was sufficient to need considerable attention. The characteristic curves were analyzed by measuring ASA, halfgamma and inertia (H & D) speeds. The speed ratios (latensified speed/control speed) obtained for each spectral region, intensity, and time of exposure were compiled. Curves of speed ratio against time of exposure and fog level against required exposure time for each intensity and spectral region were plotted. These experiments have shown that white light may be used most efficiently in latensification with the panchromatic emulsions tested. In addition to this {{it has been shown that}} the short wavelength region is less effective in producing speed gains than is the long wavelength region. It has been explained that these effects may be due primarily to the greater scattering of the blue and ultra-violet light by the emulsion even though the Gurney-Mott theory of latent image formation would indicate otherwise if these other influences were n ot considered. The overall evaluation attests to the fact that the effect of wavelength is a secondary consideration as compared to the intensity of radiation used to latensify the emulsion. Optimum intensity, when applied with the proper length of exposure time to produce a fog lievel approximately double the normal fog, is the major factor leading to optimum conditions of speed gain. The maximum speed ratio gains achieved for each emulsion were Royal Pan 2. 24, Aerial Recon 1. 85, Plus X 2. 08, and Microfile 7. 35. Generally speaking the slower the emulsion the better the gains which may be achieved. Royal Pan, however, was an exception and produced unexpected results in speed gain. The results obtained with Microfile indicate this fine grain emulsion may possibly be employed in miniature camera systems for use in aerial photography. A less active developer than normally used D- 11 must be used to reduce contrast to a comparable degree ordinarily used in aerial photography. The effect of forced development in D- 11 was found not to produce <b>speed</b> gains as <b>high</b> as the less active development in D- 23, Development in Microdol (1 : 4) proved of little interest as speed loss was excessive. This speed loss is characteristic of most true fine-grain developers...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The present {{work was}} envisaged {{to reduce the}} dosing {{frequency}} and improve patient compliance by designing and evaluating Sustained Release Mucoadhesive (SRM) microspheres of Neostigmine bromide (NB) for effective control of myasthenia gravis. Microspheres were prepared by emulsification-internal gelation technique using Sodium alginate, Carbopol 934 P (CP), and Hydroxyl propyl methyl cellulose K 15 M (HPMC) as a mucoadhesive polymers. Microspheres prepared were found discrete, spherical and free flowing. The microspheres exhibits good mucoadhesive properties and showed high drug entrapment efficiency. NB release from these microspheres was slow and extended and dependent {{on the type of}} polymer used. The mean particle size decreased and the drug release rate increased at <b>higher</b> Stirring <b>speed</b> of <b>emulsion</b> content. Among all the formulation, formulation F 6 containing sodium alginate, 4 % & HMPC, 1 % and F 9 containing sodium alginate, 4 % & carbopol, 1 % showed the best reproducible results and mucoadhesive profile with good surface morphology. The data obtained thus suggest that mucoadhesive microspheres can successfully design for sustained delivery of NB and to improve patient compliance...|$|R

40|$|Double (w 1 /o/w 2) {{emulsions}} {{are potential}} fat replacers in foods. Fats {{are known for}} their lubricating properties, which contribute to texture perception. It is therefore of interest to understand how the composition of double emulsions influences lubrication properties. This study focuses on the understanding of the influence of the fraction of inner dispersed aqueous phase w 1 and the gelation of the w 1 droplets on the lubrication properties of double emulsions. The addition of an inner water phase w 1 to the oil droplets decreased friction at low entrainment speeds due to adsorption of the lipophilic emulsifier polyglycerol polyricinoleate (PGPR) at the hydrophobic tribo-surface. At <b>higher</b> entrainment <b>speeds,</b> double <b>emulsions</b> with w 1 fractions of up to 6 % (corresponding to fat reduction of 20 %) displayed comparable tribological behavior as full-fat single (o/w 2) emulsions. For double emulsions with gelled w 1 droplets at higher w 1 fractions of up to 15 % (corresponding to fat reduction of 50 %), an increase in friction was observed compared to full-fat single (o/w 2) emulsions. The increase in friction is probably related to the presence of gelled droplets expelled from the inner w 1 into the outer w 2 phase, and to the deformability of (w 1 /o) droplets. Lubrication decreased when gelled particles were expelled from the inner w 1 phase to the outer w 2 phase. Lubrication also decreased when the deformability of (w 1 /o) droplets decreased, since less deformable (w 1 /o) droplets spread less easily on the tribo-pair surface. Knowledge about lubrication properties of double emulsions can be used in future studies to relate composition to sensory perception and develop double emulsions further as fat replacers...|$|R
