5|$|Antiemetic {{medications}} may {{be helpful}} for treating vomiting in children. Ondansetron has some utility, with a single dose being associated with less need for intravenous fluids, fewer hospitalizations, and decreased vomiting. Metoclopramide might also be helpful. However, the use of ondansetron might possibly be linked to an increased rate of return to hospital in children. The intravenous preparation of ondansetron may be given orally if clinical judgment warrants. <b>Dimenhydrinate,</b> while reducing vomiting, {{does not appear to}} have a significant clinical benefit.|$|E

2500|$|NASA jokingly {{measures}} SAS {{using the}} [...] "Garn scale", named for United States Senator Jake Garn, whose sickness during STS-51-D {{was the worst}} on record. Accordingly, one [...] "Garn" [...] {{is equivalent to the}} most severe possible case of space sickness. By studying how changes can affect balance in the human body—involving the senses, the brain, the inner ear, and blood pressure—NASA hopes to develop treatments that can be used on Earth and in space to correct balance disorders. Until then, astronauts rely on medication, such as midodrine and <b>dimenhydrinate</b> anti-nausea patches, as required (such as when space suits are worn, because vomiting into a space suit could be fatal).|$|E
2500|$|Over-the-counter and {{prescription}} medications are readily available, such as Dramamine/Gravol (<b>dimenhydrinate),</b> scopolamine, Bonine/Antivert (meclizine), promethazine, cyclizine, and Stugeron (cinnarizine). Cinnarizine {{is not available}} in the United States, as it is not approved by the FDA. As these medications often have side effects, anyone involved in high-risk activities while at sea (such as SCUBA divers) must evaluate the risks versus the benefits. Promethazine is especially known to cause drowsiness, which is often counteracted by ephedrine in a combination known as [...] "the Coast Guard cocktail.". There are special considerations {{to be aware of}} when the common anti-motion sickness medications are used in the military setting where performance must be maintained at a high level.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dimenhydrinate</b> is {{primarily}} {{used to treat}} nausea, vomiting, and dizziness caused by motion sickness. <b>Dimenhydrinate</b> has also been found {{to aid in the}} treatment of ear congestion.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dimenhydrinate,</b> {{marketed as}} Dramamine and Gravol among others, is an {{over-the-counter}} medication {{used to treat}} motion sickness and nausea. <b>Dimenhydrinate</b> {{is a combination of}} two drugs: diphenhydramine and 8-chlorotheophylline.|$|E
50|$|Diphenhydramine is {{the primary}} {{constituent}} of <b>dimenhydrinate</b> and dictates the primary effect. The main difference relative to pure diphenhydramine is a lower potency due to being combined with 8-chlorotheophylline. By weight, <b>dimenhydrinate</b> is between 53% to 55.5% diphenhydramine.|$|E
5000|$|Antihistamines such as betahistine, <b>dimenhydrinate,</b> or meclizine, {{which may}} have {{antiemetic}} properties ...|$|E
50|$|As with <b>dimenhydrinate,</b> the {{stimulant}} {{effect of}} the acefylline counteracts the sedative effect from the diphenhydramine, resulting in an improved therapeutic profile.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dimenhydrinate</b> has {{successfully}} {{been used as}} an antiemetic and sedative in housepets. It is commonly used to reduce the effects of idiopathic vestibular syndrome.|$|E
50|$|The ethanolamines {{comprise}} {{a group of}} amino alcohols. A class of antihistamines is identified as ethanolamines, which includes carbinoxamine, clemastine, <b>dimenhydrinate,</b> diphenhydramine, and doxylamine.|$|E
50|$|Etanautine, {{also known}} as {{diphenhydramine}} monoacefyllinate, is an anticholinergic used as an antiparkinsonian agent. It is a 1:1 salt of diphenhydramine with acefylline, similar to the diphenhydramine/8-chlorotheophylline combination product <b>dimenhydrinate.</b>|$|E
50|$|Modern motion-sickness {{medications}} can counter {{space sickness}} but are rarely used {{because it is}} considered better to allow space travelers to adapt naturally over the first day or two than to suffer the drowsiness and other side effects of medication. However, transdermal <b>dimenhydrinate</b> anti-nausea patches are typically used whenever space suits are worn because vomiting into a space suit could be fatal, as it could obscure vision or block airflow. Space suits are generally worn during launch and landing by NASA crew members and always for extra-vehicular activities (EVAs). EVAs are consequently not usually scheduled for {{the first days of}} a mission to allow the crew to adapt, and transdermal <b>dimenhydrinate</b> patches are typically used as an additional backup measure.|$|E
50|$|Diphenhydramine is an {{antihistamine}} and a sedative and {{is available}} over-the-counter for allergy relief and {{for use as a}} sleep aid and <b>dimenhydrinate</b> is available over-the-counter for alleviation of motion sickness. Recreational users take many times (>250 mg) the therapeutic dose to achieve a state of delusional delirium.|$|E
5000|$|... 8-Chlorotheophylline, {{also known}} as 1,3-dimethyl-8-chloroxanthine, is a {{stimulant}} drug of the xanthine chemical class, with physiological effects similar to caffeine. Its main use is in combination with diphenhydramine in the antiemetic <b>dimenhydrinate.</b> Diphenhydramine reduces nausea but causes drowsiness, and the stimulant properties of 8-Chlorotheophylline help ward off that side-effect.|$|E
50|$|Naturally {{occurring}} deliriants {{are found}} in plant species such as Atropa belladonna (deadly nightshade), various Brugmansia species (Angel's Trumpets), Datura stramonium (Jimson weed), Hyoscyamus niger (henbane), and Mandragora officinarum (mandrake) {{in the form of}} tropane alkaloids (notably atropine, scopolamine, and hyoscyamine). Synthetic compounds such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) and <b>dimenhydrinate</b> (Dramamine) are also deliriants.|$|E
50|$|ACP paramedics have {{protocols}} {{to administer}} all PCP plus Adenosine, Calcium Chloride, Dextrose 50%, <b>Dimenhydrinate</b> (Gravol), Ipratropium Bromide (Atrovent), Lidocaine, Morphine Sulphate and Amiodarone (Cordarone). Their additional skills include synchronized cardioversion, airway isolation devices, endotracheal intubation, end-tidal CO2 monitoring, external jugular vein cannulation, transcutaneous pacing, IV colloid/crytalloid volume expanders, nasopharangeal airways, needle thoracentesis and surgical or needle cricothyrotomy.|$|E
50|$|Initial {{management}} {{includes the}} relief of symptoms and correcting electrolyte and fluid imbalance that may occur with vomiting. Antiemetics, such as <b>dimenhydrinate,</b> are used to treat the nausea. Pain may be treated with anti-inflammatories, NSAIDs such as ketorolac or diclofenac. Opioids, such as morphine, less commonly may be used. NSAIDs {{are more or less}} equivalent to opioids.|$|E
50|$|Treatment {{includes}} drinking {{fluids and}} a bland diet. Recommendations may include electrolyte-replacement drinks, thiamine, {{and a higher}} protein diet. Some women require intravenous fluids. With respect to medications pyridoxine or metoclopramide are preferred. Prochlorperazine, <b>dimenhydrinate,</b> or ondansetron may be used if these are not effective. Hospitalization may be required. Psychotherapy may improve outcomes. Evidence for acupressure is poor.|$|E
50|$|CNS {{depressants}} {{may enhance}} the depressant effects of hydromorphone, such as other opioids, anesthetics, sedatives, hypnotics, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, phenothiazines, chloral hydrate, <b>dimenhydrinate,</b> and glutethimide. The depressant effect of hydromorphone {{may also be}} enhanced by MAO inhibitors (including procarbazine), first-generation antihistamines (brompheniramine, promethazine, diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine), beta-blockers, and alcohol. When combined therapy is contemplated, the dose should be reduced of one or both agents.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dimenhydrinate</b> is recreationally {{used as a}} deliriant. Slang {{terms for}} Dramamine used this way include [...] "drama", [...] "dime", [...] "dime tabs", [...] "D-Q", [...] "substance D", [...] "d-house", and [...] "drams". Abusing Dramamine is {{sometimes}} referred to as Dramatizing or [...] "going a dime a dozen", a reference to the amount of Dramamine tablets generally necessary for a trip.|$|E
50|$|Included in {{this group}} are such plants as Atropa {{belladonna}} (deadly nightshade), Brugmansia species (Angel's Trumpet), Datura stramonium (Jimson weed), Hyoscyamus niger (henbane), Mandragora officinarum (mandrake), and Myristica fragrans (nutmeg), {{as well as a}} number of pharmaceutical drugs, when taken in very high doses, such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) and its close relative <b>dimenhydrinate</b> (Dramamine). Uncured tobacco is also a deliriant due to its intoxicatingly high levels of nicotine.|$|E
50|$|Most modern-day psychonauts who use deliriants report {{similar or}} {{identical}} hallucinations and challenges. For example, diphenhydramine, {{as well as}} <b>dimenhydrinate,</b> when taken in a high enough dosage, often are reported to evoke vivid, dark, and entity-like hallucinations, peripheral disturbances, feelings of being alone but simultaneously of being watched, and hallucinations of real things ceasing to exist. Deliriants also may cause confusion or even rage, and thus {{have been used by}} ancient peoples as a stimulant before going into battle.|$|E
50|$|Risk {{factors for}} benign {{fasciculations}} may {{include the use}} of anticholinergic drugs over long periods. In particular, these include ethanolamines such as diphenhydramine (brand names Benadryl, Dimedrol, Daedalon and Nytol), used as an antihistamine and sedative, and <b>dimenhydrinate</b> (brand names Dramamine, Driminate, Gravol, Gravamin, Vomex, and Vertirosan) for nausea and motion sickness. Persons with benign fasciculation syndrome (BFS) may experience paraesthesia (especially numbness) shortly after taking such medication; fasciculation episodes begin as the medication wears off.|$|E
50|$|Antiemetic {{medications}} may {{be helpful}} for treating vomiting in children. Ondansetron has some utility, with a single dose being associated with less need for intravenous fluids, fewer hospitalizations, and decreased vomiting. Metoclopramide might also be helpful.

The intravenous preparation of ondansetron may be given orally if clinical judgment warrants. <b>Dimenhydrinate,</b> while reducing vomiting, {{does not appear to}} have a significant clinical benefit.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the PCP protocols and medications, they may also administer Acetaminophen, Adenosine, Atropine Sulphate, Calcium Chloride, Dextrose 50%, <b>Dimenhydrinate</b> (Gravol), Hemabate, Indomethacin, Lorazepam, Magnesium Sulphate, Midazolam (Versed), Morphine Sulphate, Ondansetron, Oxytocin, Sodium Bicarbonate and Out-of-Scope medications with orders from a CCTA. ITT paramedics have their own unique set of prehospital treatment guidelines that mirror ACP guidelines {{in the areas of}} pediatrics, having the ability to treat respiratory/cardiac arrest and disrhythmias. The ITT practitioner also has adult ACLS guidelines and intubation in the event they encounter an adult cardiac arrest.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the EMR guidelines, PCP licensees have treatment guidelines for shortness of breath (SOB), anaphylaxis, opioid overdose, an expanded diabetic emergencies and a catch-all for people with a decreased level of consciousness not yet diagnosed (NYD) that combines the diabetic/hypoglycemic and opioid OD guidelines. PCP-qualified paramedics may also be endorsed for intravenous cannulation (PCP-IV) and will have an additional guidelines for hypovolemia as well as enhancements to the anaphylaxis, diabetic, opioid OD and NYD guidelines. Additional PCP-level medications include salbutamol, naloxone, glucagon, epinephrine, diphenhydramine, thiamine (thiamine has been removed as treatment), dextrose 10% (D10W), TXA, <b>dimenhydrinate</b> and normal saline.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dimenhydrinate</b> is marketed under many brand names: in the USA, Mexico and Serbia as Dramamine, in Ukraine as Driminate, in India and Canada as Gravol, in Iceland as Gravamin, in Russia and Croatia as Dramina, in South Africa and Germany as Vomex, in Australia and Austria as Vertirosan, in Brazil as Dramin, in Ecuador as Anautin, in Hungary as Daedalon, in Sweden as Calma or Arlevert, in Indonesia as Antimo, in Italy as Xamamina or Valontan, in Peru as Gravicoll, in Poland and Slovakia as Aviomarin, in Portugal as Viabom, in Spain as Biodramina, in Thailand as ไดเมนนีน (Daimenin), and in Pakistan as Gravinate.|$|E

50|$|Other CNS effects {{occur within}} the limbic system and hippocampus, causing {{confusion}} and temporary amnesia due to decreased acetylcholine signaling. Toxicology also manifests in the autonomic nervous system, primarily at the neuromuscular junction, resulting in ataxia and extrapyramidal side-effects {{and the feeling}} of heaviness in the legs, and at sympathetic post-ganglionic junctions, causing urinary retention, pupil dilation, tachycardia, irregular urination, and dry red skin caused by decreased exocrine gland secretions, and mucous membranes. Considerable overdosage can lead to myocardial infarction (heart attack), serious ventricular dysrhythmias, coma and death. Such a side-effect profile is thought to give ethanolamine-class antihistamines a relatively low abuse liability. The specific antidote for <b>dimenhydrinate</b> poisoning is physostigmine, usually given by IV in a hospital.|$|E
5000|$|Over-the-counter and {{prescription}} medications are readily available, such as Dramamine/Gravol (<b>dimenhydrinate),</b> scopolamine, Bonine/Antivert (meclizine), promethazine, cyclizine, and Stugeron (cinnarizine).

50|$|Attacks of vestibulocerebellar {{syndrome}} may {{be triggered}} by a sudden change in head position, fatigue, or by being {{in an environment of}} fast-moving objects. These attacks may be alleviated by lying quietly with eyes closed for fifteen to thirty minutes. Lying down stabilizes the head in a fixed position while closing the eyes removes the unstable sensory input responsible for the dizziness. Treatment is presently focused on addressing specific symptoms to alleviate the nausea that often accompanies attacks and to make daily life more manageable. There have been very few studies on the effectiveness of drugs that are used for the management of other ataxias on vestibulocerebellar syndrome. Trials with acetazolamide achieved some success, while amitriptyline hydrochloride was unsuccessful. Acetazolamide therapy proved effective in treating episodic vertigo. In trials with patients afflicted with vestibulocerebellar syndrome, acetazolamide either eliminated or significantly decreased the frequency and severity of vertigo episodes. Dramamine (<b>Dimenhydrinate)</b> and antihistamine drugs have also been helpful in decreasing the frequency and severity of attacks.|$|E
50|$|Many pharmacologic {{medications}} {{are available}} {{for the treatment of}} nausea. There is no medication that is clearly superior to other medications for all cases of nausea. The choice of antiemetic medication may be based on the situation during which the person experiences nausea. For people with motion sickness and vertigo, antihistamines and anticholinergics such as meclizine and scopolamine are particularly effective. Nausea and vomiting associated with migraine headaches respond best to dopamine antagonists such as metoclopramide, prochlorperazine, and chlorpromazine. In cases of gastroenteritis, serotonin antagonists such as ondansetron were found to suppress nausea and vomiting, as well as reduce the need for IV fluid resuscitation. The combination of pyridoxine and doxylamine is the first line treatment for pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting. <b>Dimenhydrinate</b> is an inexpensive and effective over the counter medication for preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting. Other factors to consider when choosing an antiemetic medication include the person's preference, side-effect profile, and cost.|$|E
5000|$|As of 2008, most {{well-known}} hallucinogens (aside from dextromethorphan, diphenhydramine and <b>dimenhydrinate)</b> are illegal in most Western countries. In the United States hallucinogens {{are classified as}} a schedule 1 drug. The 3-pronged test for schedule 1 drugs is as follows: the drug has no currently accepted medical use, {{there is a lack}} of safety for the use of the drug under medical supervision, and the substance has a high potential for abuse. One notable exception to the current criminalization trend is in parts of Western Europe, especially in the Netherlands, where cannabis is considered to be a [...] "soft drug". Previously included were hallucinogenic mushrooms, but as of October 2007 the Netherlands officials have moved to ban their sale following several widely publicized incidents involving tourists. While the possession of soft drugs is technically illegal, the Dutch government has decided that using law enforcement to combat their use is largely a waste of resources. As a result, public [...] "coffeeshops" [...] in the Netherlands openly sell cannabis for personal use, and [...] "smart shops" [...] sell drugs like Salvia divinorum, and until the ban of psilocybin mushrooms took effect, they were still available for purchase in smartshops as well. (See Drug policy of the Netherlands).|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: A simple, {{rapid and}} precise reverse phase high {{performance}} liquid chromatographic method {{has been developed}} for simultaneous estimation of Cinnarizine and <b>Dimenhydrinate</b> in Tablet Dosage Form. Chromatography was performed on a Phenomenex Partisil ODS C 18 (250 X 4. 6 mm) 5 m column using Acetonitrile: Water (90 : 10) as a mobile phase. The detection of the synthetic mixture was carried out at 265 nm with a flow rate of 0. 7 ml/min. The retention times were 4. 3 and 5. 8 minutes for Cinnarizine and <b>Dimenhydrinate,</b> respectively. Proposed method was validated as per ICH guidelines for linearity, accuracy, precision; specificity and robustness for estimation of Cinnarizine and <b>Dimenhydrinate</b> in Tablet Dosage Form and results {{were found to be}} satisfactory. The linearity of the method was excellent over a concentration range 20 - 100 μg/ml for Cinnarizine and 40 - 200 μg/ml for <b>Dimenhydrinate.</b> The correlation coefficient was 0. 996 and 0. 992 for Cinnarizine and <b>Dimenhydrinate,</b> respectively. The limit of detection was 1. 62 μg/mL and 2. 62 μg/mL for Cinnarizine and <b>Dimenhydrinate,</b> respectively. The limit of quantitation was 4. 93 μg/mL and 7. 95 μg/ml for Cinnarizine and <b>Dimenhydrinate,</b> respectively. The relative standard deviation values for repeatability, intraday precision and interday precision studies were less than 2 % and % recovery was 98 % to 102 % for both drugs. So the proposed method was found to be suitable for the routine estimation of Cinnarizine and <b>Dimenhydrinate</b> in Tablet Dosage Form...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether the use of <b>dimenhydrinate</b> was associated with delay in the diagnosis and management of treatable illnesses or with direct adverse effects in children with vomiting presenting to an emergency department. DESIGN: Questionnaire survey and review of drug reaction and telephone inquiry records. SETTING: The emergency department of a tertiary care children's hospital and a provincial poison information centre. PATIENTS: The parents of 148 children who presented with vomiting completed the questionnaire. The database at the poison information centre included 474 reports of adverse drug reactions over an 8 -year period and 105 reports of telephone inquiries over a 4 -year period. MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-one (14 %) of 148 children had received <b>dimenhydrinate</b> before arrival at the emergency department. The patients who had received <b>dimenhydrinate</b> {{were more likely than}} the others to present more than 12 hours after the onset of vomiting (14 [67 %] of 21 v. 43 [34 %] of 127, p less than 0. 01). The discharge diagnoses for those who had received <b>dimenhydrinate</b> included asthma, pelvic inflammatory disease and urinary tract infection. No clinically important direct adverse reactions to <b>dimenhydrinate</b> were documented. CONCLUSIONS: The use of <b>dimenhydrinate</b> in children with vomiting is associated with a risk of delay in the diagnosis of treatable medical conditions...|$|E
