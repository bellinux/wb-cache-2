5|$|Although adult lions have {{no natural}} predators, <b>evidence</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{majority}} die violently from humans or other lions. Lions often inflict serious injuries on each other, either members of different prides encountering {{each other in}} territorial disputes, or {{members of the same}} pride fighting at a kill. Crippled lions and lion cubs may fall victim to hyenas, leopards, or be trampled by buffalo or elephants, and careless lions may be maimed when hunting prey.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{parasite}} responsible for P.falciparum malaria {{has been in}} existence for 50,000–100,000 years, the population size of {{the parasite}} did not increase until about 10,000 years ago, concurrently with advances in agriculture {{and the development of}} human settlements. Close relatives of the human malaria parasites remain common in chimpanzees. Some <b>evidence</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> P.falciparum malaria may have originated in gorillas.|$|E

After the Chinese had invented gunpowder, they began adapting its explosive properties for use in military technology.

5|$|This {{species of}} {{wildebeest}} {{seems to have}} evolved around 2.5 million years ago. The black wildebeest {{is believed to have}} diverged from the blue wildebeest to become a distinct species around a million years ago, in the mid to late Pleistocene. Fossil <b>evidence</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> blue wildebeest were quite common in the Cradle of Humankind in the past.

5|$|Anecdotal <b>evidence</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> plant may be mildly toxic. The noxious odours {{have been}} {{associated}} with nausea and headaches, as well as with contact dermatitis reported in both humans and sheep, who also developed weakness and paralysis. It contains a quinone irritant, 2,6-dimethoxybenzoquinone, as well as active quassinoids (ailanthone itself being one) which may account for these effects, but they have, however, proved difficult or impossible to reproduce in humans and goats. In one trial a tincture from the blossom and foliage caused nausea, vomiting and muscular relaxation.|$|E
5|$|Increased dietary {{selenium}} {{reduces the}} effects of mercury toxicity, although it is effective only at low to modest doses of mercury. <b>Evidence</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> molecular mechanisms of mercury toxicity includes the irreversible inhibition of selenoenzymes that are required to prevent and reverse oxidative damage in brain and endocrine tissues. An antioxidant, selenoneine, which is derived from selenium and {{has been found to}} be present in the blood of bluefin tuna, is the subject of scientific research regarding its possible roles in inflammatory and chronic diseases, methylmercury detoxification, and oxidative damages.|$|E

5|$|Pelicans {{give their}} {{name to the}} Pelecaniformes, an order which has a varied taxonomic history. Tropicbirds, darters, cormorants, gannets, boobies and frigatebirds, all {{traditional}} members of the order, have since been reclassified: tropicbirds into their own order, Phaethontiformes, and the remainder into Suliformes. In their place, herons, ibises, spoonbills, the hamerkop and the shoebill have now been transferred into Pelecaniformes. Molecular <b>evidence</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> shoebill and the hamerkop form a sister group to the pelicans, though there is some doubt as to the exact relationships among the three lineages.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} Malagasy {{hippopotamus}} (also known as Malagasy dwarf hippopotamus or Malagasy pygmy hippopotamus or Madagascan instead of Malagasy) {{lived on the}} island of Madagascar but are now believed to be extinct. The animals were very similar to the extant hippopotamus and pygmy hippopotamus. The fossil record suggests that at least one species of hippopotamus lived until about 1,000 years ago, and other <b>evidence</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> species may have survived until much more recently. The taxonomy of these animals is not resolved and not widely studied. The various species are believed to have survived into the Holocene era.|$|E

5|$|The {{sketches}} {{were written}} {{during the spring}} and summer of 1828, possibly even earlier. The inner movements were sketched up to the final bar, while the outer, sonata-form movements were only sketched up to the beginning of the recapitulation and in the coda. In the sketches, passages from different movements (or even different sonatas) sometimes appear on the same leaf; such <b>evidence</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> last two sonatas were composed in parallel, at least in part. Furthermore, in the B-flat Sonata, Schubert sketched the finale before completing the first movement, unlike his usual practice, in which finales were conceived at a later stage.|$|E
5|$|Unas {{had several}} daughters and {{possibly}} {{one or two}} sons who {{are believed to have}} predeceased him. Manetho, an Egyptian priest of the Ptolemaic period and author of the first history of Egypt, claims that with Unas' death the Fifth Dynasty came to an end. Unas was succeeded by Teti, the first pharaoh of the Sixth Dynasty, possibly after a short crisis. However, the archaeological <b>evidence</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Egyptians at the time made no conscious break with the preceding dynasty and the distinction between the Fifth and Sixth dynasties might be illusory.|$|E
5|$|Using {{data from}} Mars Global Surveyor, Mars Odyssey and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, {{scientists}} have found widespread deposits of chloride minerals. <b>Evidence</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> deposits were formed from the evaporation of mineral enriched waters. The research suggests that lakes may have been scattered over {{large areas of the}} Martian surface. Usually chlorides are the last minerals to come out of solution. Carbonates, sulfates, and silica should precipitate out ahead of them. Sulfates and silica have been found by the Mars Rovers on the surface. Places with chloride minerals may have once held various life forms. Furthermore, such areas could preserve traces of ancient life.|$|E

5|$|As regards numbers, the mid-2nd-century army {{contained}} c. 80,000 cavalry out of c. 385,000 total effectives i.e. cavalry constituted c. 21% of {{the total}} forces. For the late army, about {{one third of the}} army units in the Notitia are cavalry, but in numbers cavalry were a smaller proportion {{of the total}} because cavalry units were on average smaller than infantry units. For example, in the comitatus, cavalry vexillationes were probably half the size of infantry legiones. Overall, the available <b>evidence</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> proportion of cavalry was much the same as in the 2nd century. Examples: in 478, a comitatus of 38,000 men contained 8,000 cavalry (21%). In 357, the comitatus of Gaul, 13–15,000 strong, contained an estimated 3,000 cavalry (20–23%).|$|E
5|$|Finney {{disagreed}} with the accidental voyaging portion of Sharp's hypothesis. To investigate the problem, he founded the Polynesian Voyaging Society with Herb Kane and Tommy Holmes in 1973, intent on building a voyaging canoe to sail from Hawaii to Tahiti to test whether intentional two-way voyaging throughout Oceania could be replicated. With the help of Mau's navigational knowledge guiding Hōkūle‘a, the Polynesian Voyaging Society demonstrated that intentional voyaging was not only possible, but also the ancestors of the Polynesians could have settled the Pacific on similar voyages using non-instrument wayfinding techniques such as Mau's. Finally, linguistic and archaeological <b>evidence</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> history of the Polynesian people does not originate in the East Pacific but in the West. Recent developments {{in the field of}} DNA analysis have unequivocally settled the debate of Polynesian origin. They prove Polynesians share common ancestry with indigenous Taiwanese and East Asians.|$|E
5|$|More than 600 archeological {{sites have}} been found inside the {{boundaries}} of Petrified Forest National Park. <b>Evidence</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> earliest inhabitants of the park arrived at least 8,000 years ago. Two Folsom-type spear points, the earliest artifacts of Paleo-Indians found in the park, are at least that old. Between 6000BCE and 1CE, the Archaic–Early Basketmaker Era, nomadic groups established seasonal camps in the Petrified Forest from which they hunted small game such as rabbits, pronghorn antelope, and deer and harvested seeds from Indian ricegrass and other wild plants. Around 150BCE, they began to grow corn in the area. By 1CE, as their farming techniques improved, some built houses in the Petrified Forest and began to stay there year-round.|$|E
