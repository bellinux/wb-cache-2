5|$|This {{problem has}} been the object of growing concern. For example, {{researchers}} at the University of Hohenheim are studying how bees can be poisoned by exposure to seed disinfectants. In France, the Ministry of Agriculture commissioned an expert group, the Scientific and Technical Committee for the Multifactorial Study on Bees (CST), to study the intoxicating and sometimes fatal effects of chemicals used in agriculture on bees. Researchers at the Bee Research Institute and the Department of Food Chemistry and Analysis in the Czech Republic have pondered the intoxicating effects of various chemicals used to treat winter rapeseed crops. Romania suffered a severe case of widespread bee intoxication and extensive bee mortality from <b>deltamethrin</b> in 2002. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) even has published standards for testing chemicals for bee intoxication.|$|E
5|$|Indoor {{residual}} spraying is the spraying of insecticides on {{the walls}} inside a home. After feeding, many mosquitoes rest on a nearby surface while digesting the bloodmeal, so if the walls of houses have been coated with insecticides, the resting mosquitoes can be killed before they can bite another person and transfer the malaria parasite. As of 2006, the World Health Organization recommends 12 insecticides in IRS operations, including DDT and the pyrethroids cyfluthrin and <b>deltamethrin.</b> This public health use of small amounts of DDT is permitted under the Stockholm Convention, which prohibits its agricultural use. One problem with all forms of IRS is insecticide resistance. Mosquitoes affected by IRS tend to rest and live indoors, and due to the irritation caused by spraying, their descendants tend to rest and live outdoors, meaning that they are less affected by the IRS.|$|E
25|$|Pyrethroids are direct stimulators {{of sodium}} {{channels}} in neuronal cells, inducing rapid depolarization and spastic paralysis leading to death. The effect is {{specific to the}} parasite since the drugs used are only slowly absorbed by the host and rapidly metabolized once absorbed. Cypermethrin (Excis, Betamax) and <b>deltamethrin</b> (Alphamax) are the two pyrethroids commonly used to control sea lice. Resistance to pyrethroids {{has been reported in}} Norway and appears to be due to a mutation leading to a structural change in the sodium channel which prevents pyrethroids from activating the channel. Use of <b>deltamethrin</b> has been increasing as an alternate treatment with the rise in resistance observed with emamectin benzoate.|$|E
25|$|Organophosphate and {{carbamate}} insecticides, e.g. malathion and bendiocarb, respectively, {{are more}} expensive than DDT per kilogram and are applied {{at roughly the same}} dosage. Pyrethroids such as <b>deltamethrin</b> are also more expensive than DDT, but are applied more sparingly (0.02–0.3g/m2 vs 1–2g/m2), so the net cost per house is about the same.|$|E
25|$|IRS is {{effective}} if at least 80% {{of homes and}} barns in a residential area are sprayed. Lower coverage rates can jeopardize program effectiveness. Many residents resist DDT spraying, objecting to the lingering smell, stains on walls, and the potential exacerbation of problems with other insect pests. Pyrethroid insecticides (e.g. <b>deltamethrin</b> and lambda-cyhalothrin) can overcome some of these issues, increasing participation.|$|E
25|$|These usually {{consist of}} netting made of {{synthetic}} fibers or fine metal mesh that is fitted to the ventilation slats / windows of housing for livestock animals. The fiber netting can be impregnated with insecticides {{such as the}} synthetic pyrethroid <b>deltamethrin</b> that acts rapidly when flies such as Stomoxys or Glossina species land on it. Valuable horses in areas infested with Culicoides midges or Simulium black-flies can be protected with commercially available shields made of cloth that fit over head, neck and back. Flies such as the Musca, Stomoxys and Haematobia species have larval habitats amongst livestock dung and soiled bedding found around livestock farms. There is scope for reducing fly infestation by clearing these wastes to composting containers or areas. However, for many types of dipteran fly the larvae inhabit areas such as bogs (Culicoides), swamps (mosquitoes), or rivers (Simulium) that are impractical to treat under typical commercial constraints within agriculture.|$|E
25|$|Synthetic {{chemicals}} such as diethyltoluamide (often called DEET) {{dissolved in}} an oily carrier are sometimes used. Also {{there are various}} organic, botanical repellents such as citronella oil and neem oil. Typically various types of synthetic pyrethroids such as <b>deltamethrin,</b> cypermethrin, and permethrin are formulated in an oil or watery suspension suitable for application direct to the skin of animals at risk. This is usually done with a pour-on applicator along the back line of the host from where the insecticide spreads downwards through the hair coat. In addition, to protect against flies such as Stomoxys and Glossina species that feed on legs and belly the insecticide can be sprayed selectively to those regions. Also cattle can be treated using self-applicators such as back-rubbers made of large bundles of fiber impregnated with the insecticide, or in automatic walk-through sprayers. The same types of insecticides are also formulated into the plastic sheet of ear-tags for protecting cattle against Musca and similar flies feeding around the head of cattle. Insect growth regulators (juvenile hormones, chitin synthesis inhibitors, etc.) are available. For example, the insect growth regulator cyromazine is effective for the prevention or treatment of infestations with blowfly larvae. Botanical extracts such as azadirachtin from the neem tree can be formulated as repellents and insecticides, with the potential advantage of more rapid degradation to harmless forms in the environment, lower toxicity and potentially lower cost.|$|E
500|$|Many {{remedies}} {{have been}} tried {{in the search for}} control of the major pest species of cockroaches, which are resilient and fast-breeding. Household chemicals like sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) have been suggested, without evidence for their effectiveness. Garden herbs including [...] bay, catnip, mint, cucumber, and garlic have been proposed as repellents. Poisoned bait containing hydramethylnon or fipronil, and boric acid powder is effective on adults. Baits with egg killers are also quite effective at reducing the cockroach population. Alternatively, insecticides containing <b>deltamethrin</b> or pyrethrin are very effective. In Singapore and Malaysia, taxi drivers use pandan leaves to repel cockroaches in their vehicles.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} uses for <b>deltamethrin,</b> ranging from {{agricultural}} uses to home pest control. <b>Deltamethrin</b> {{has been instrumental}} in preventing the spread of diseases carried by tick-infested prairie dogs, rodents and other burrowing animals. It is helpful in eliminating and preventing a wide variety of household pests, especially spiders, fleas, ticks, carpenter ants, carpenter bees, cockroaches and bed bugs. <b>Deltamethrin</b> {{is also one of the}} primary ingredients in ant chalk.|$|E
50|$|Alphamethrin, <b>deltamethrin,</b> Malathion {{can be used}} {{to control}} the mosquito.|$|E
50|$|<b>Deltamethrin</b> powder (WP) {{is another}} {{solution}} to weevil infestation in grains.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Deltamethrin</b> is a {{pyrethroid}} ester insecticide. It is sold as [...] "DeltaGard" [...] in Canada.|$|E
50|$|Two {{mutation}}s, the valine to leucine mutation (V419L) and the leucine to isoleucine mutation (L925I) in voltage-gated {{sodium channel}} α-subunit gene, {{have been identified}} as responsible for knockdown resistance to <b>deltamethrin</b> in bed bugs. One study found that 88% of bed bug populations in the US had {{at least one of the}} two mutations, if not both, meaning that <b>deltamethrin</b> resistance among bed bugs is currently making this insecticide obsolete.|$|E
50|$|Cases of {{toxicity}} {{have been}} observed in cattle following use of agricultural <b>deltamethrin</b> preparation in external application for tick control.|$|E

50|$|Pyrethroid {{insecticides}} {{can be used}} {{to control}} carpet beetles. Products containing active ingredients such as permethrin, bifenthrin, <b>deltamethrin,</b> tralomethrin are components of the Pyrethroid insecticide.|$|E
50|$|<b>Deltamethrin</b> plays {{key role}} in {{controlling}} malaria vectors, and {{is used in the}} manufacture of long-lasting insecticidal mosquito nets. It is used as one of a battery of pyrethroid insecticides in control of malarial vectors, particularly Anopheles gambiae, and whilst being the most employed pyrethroid insecticide, can be used in conjunction with, or as an alternative to, permethrin, cypermethrin and organophosphate-based insecticides, such as malathion and fenthion. Resistance to <b>deltamethrin</b> (and its counterparts) is now extremely widespread and threatens the success of worldwide vector control programmes.|$|E
50|$|Ant chalk, {{also known}} as Chinese chalk or 'Miraculous Insecticide Chalk', is an {{insecticide}} {{in the form of}} normal looking chalk. It contains the pesticides <b>deltamethrin</b> and cypermethrin.|$|E
50|$|Kalkitoxin may {{activate}} the NMDA receptor. It also blocks the voltage-gated sodium channel and the electron transport chain (ETC) complex 1. It remains unknown how exactly kalkitoxin binds to the voltage-gated sodium channel. Neurotoxin sit 1 and 2 have been ruled out as possible binding sites, whereas neurotoxin site 7 is suggested as binding site for kalkitoxin. This is probable, {{because there is}} inhibition of the channel by kalkitoxin when <b>deltamethrin,</b> which has positive allosteric effects, is present. This could be because molecular determinants for binding are similar in kalkitoxin and <b>deltamethrin.</b>|$|E
50|$|Mixed with phoxim, cypermethrin, beta-cypermethrin {{imidacloprid}} and <b>deltamethrin,</b> profenofos can be {{used against}} Cotton MealyBug, cabbage caterpillar, Plutella xylostella and asparagus caterpillars, as well as against wheat and cabbage aphids.|$|E
50|$|Hopper band {{outbreaks}} {{are frequent}} in the Karoo and {{are controlled by}} farmers with insecticide spray operations: usually <b>deltamethrin</b> with motorised mistblowers set for ultra-low volume application (subsidised by the Government).|$|E
50|$|Recently, in South Africa, {{residues}} of <b>deltamethrin</b> {{were found}} in breast milk, together with DDT, {{in an area that}} used DDT treatment for malaria control, as well as pyrethroids in small-scale agriculture.|$|E

50|$|<b>Deltamethrin</b> {{products}} {{are among the}} most popular and widely used insecticides in the world and have become very popular with pest control operators and individuals in the United States. This material is a member of one of the safest classes of pesticides: synthetic pyrethroids. This pesticide is highly toxic to aquatic life, particularly fish, and therefore must be used with extreme caution around water. Although generally considered safe to use around humans, it is still neurotoxic to humans. <b>Deltamethrin</b> is able to pass from a woman's skin through her blood and into her breast milk. It is an allergen and causes asthma in some people.|$|E

Disadvantages: some are persistent in the ecosystem and toxic to fish, possibly resistance.|$|E
5000|$|In {{areas where}} the known vector is a sandfly, <b>deltamethrin</b> collars worn by the dogs has been proven to be 86% effective. [...] The sandfly is most active at dusk and dawn; keeping dogs indoors during those peak times will help {{minimize}} exposure.|$|E
50|$|There are no antidotes, and {{treatment}} must be symptomatic, as {{approved by a}} physician. Over time, <b>deltamethrin</b> is metabolized, with a rapid loss of toxicity, and passed from the body. A poison control center should be contacted {{in the event of}} an accidental poisoning.|$|E
50|$|Synthetic {{insecticides}} such as cypermethrin and <b>deltamethrin</b> are efficient, {{but must}} be thoroughly applied inside the bush and under leaves. Natural pyrethrin insecticides, extracted from Chrysanthemum and mixed with colza oil, can also be used. Spinosad, based on chemical compounds found in a bacterium, is also efficient.|$|E
50|$|Anopheles (Celia) vagus is {{a species}} complex of zoophilic {{mosquito}} {{belonging to the}} genus Anopheles. It is found in India, Sri Lanka and Indonesia. It is a potential natural vector of malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum, and Japanese encephalitis virus. It is highly susceptible to insecticide <b>deltamethrin</b> and resistant to DDT.|$|E
50|$|Until the 1990s, {{the traps}} that have offered {{the best results}} were hand-crafted, made of wood soaked in a potent and {{long-lasting}} insecticide concentrate. Among the various insecticides, the best results are obtained with <b>deltamethrin.</b> These traps have been carried out, mass-trapping {{for over a decade}} with about 130,000 plants in Sardinia with results comparable to those obtained with the adulticide treatments using the protein bait. Since the late 1990s, traps are commercially available on an industrial scale (Ecotrap) for the mass trapping of the olive fruit fly. The Ecotrap is triggered by using a form of double attraction: the pheromone of the olive fruit fly and the ammonium bicarbonate, with biocidal action carried out by <b>deltamethrin.</b> Despite the limited series of tests carried out in recent years in some areas of the Mediterranean regions, the results are judged to be positive.|$|E

50|$|<b>Deltamethrin</b> is a {{pyrethroid}} {{composed of}} a single stereoisomer, of a possible 8 stereoisomers, selectively prepared by the esterification of (1R,3R)- or cis-2,2-dimethyl-3-(2,2-dibromovinyl)cyclopropanecarboxylic acid with (alpha,S)- or (+)-alpha-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl alcohol or by selective recrystallization of the racemic esters obtained by esterification of the (1R,3R)- or cis-acid with the racemic or (alpha-R, alpha-S, or alpha-R/S)- or + or &minus; alcohol.|$|E
50|$|Silverfish are {{considered}} household pests, {{due to their}} consumption and destruction of property. However, although {{they are responsible for}} the contamination of food and other types of damage, they do not transmit disease. Earwigs, house centipedes, and spiders are known to be predators of silverfish. Silverfish die on contact with toxins such as Permethrin or <b>Deltamethrin.</b>|$|E
