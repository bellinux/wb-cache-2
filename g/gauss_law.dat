25|$|In {{the long}} history of {{canonical}} quantum gravity formulating the Hamiltonian constraint as a quantum operator (Wheeler–DeWitt equation) in a mathematically rigorous manner has been a formidable problem. It was in the loop representation that a mathematically well defined Hamiltonian constraint was finally formulated in 1996. We leave more details of its construction to the article Hamiltonian constraint of LQG. This together with the quantum versions of the <b>Gauss</b> <b>law</b> and spatial diffeomorphism constrains written in the loop representation are the central equations of LQG (modern canonical quantum General relativity).|$|E

From <b>Gauss's</b> <b>law</b> it is concluded that in vacuum, where no electric charges are present, divergence of electric field and closed surface integral of electric field are zero. In this paper we make an attempt to theoretically prove that for time-varying electric fields <b>Gauss's</b> <b>law</b> is not valid. In other words, for time-varying electric field even in vacuum divergence of electric field and closed surface integral of electric field are non-zero. We do this by considering simple sinusoidal motion of the charge and then by calculating closed surface integral at specific time of time-varying electric field due to charge motion.
