50|$|As noted above, {{in order}} to {{represent}} the full structural formulas of many complex organic and inorganic compounds, chemical nomenclature may be needed which goes well beyond the available resources used above in simple condensed formulas. See IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry and IUPAC nomenclature of inorganic chemistry 2005 for examples. In addition, linear naming systems such as <b>International</b> <b>Chemical</b> Identifier (InChI) allow a computer to construct a structural formula, and simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) allows a more human-readable ASCII input. However, all these nomenclature systems go beyond the standards of chemical formulas, and technically are <b>chemical</b> <b>naming</b> systems, not formula systems.|$|R

40|$|End users use {{chemical}} {{search engines}} {{to search for}} chemical formulae and <b>chemical</b> <b>names.</b> <b>Chemical</b> search engines identify and index chemical formulae and <b>chemical</b> <b>names</b> appearing in text documents to support e±cient search and retrieval in the future. Identifying chemical formulae and <b>chemical</b> <b>names</b> in text automatically has been a hard problem that has met {{with varying degrees of}} success in the past. We propose algorithms for chemical formula and <b>chemical</b> <b>name</b> tagging using Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) that achieve higher accuracy than existing (published) methods. After chemical entities have been identi¯ed in text documents, they must be indexed. In order to support user-provided search queries that require a partial match between the <b>chemical</b> <b>name</b> segment used as a keyword or a partial chemical formula, all possible (or a signi¯cant number of) sub-formulae of formulae that appear in any document and all possible sub-terms (e. g., `methyl') of <b>chemical</b> <b>names</b> (e. g., `methylethyl ketone') must be indexed. Indexing all possible sub-formulae and sub-terms results in an exponential increase in the storage and memory requirements, and the time taken to process the indices. We propose techniques to prune the indices signi¯cantly without reducing the quality of the returned results signi¯cantly. Finally, we propose multiple query semantics to allow user...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Term clustering, by {{measuring}} the string similarities between terms, is known within the natural language processing community {{to be an effective}} method for improving the quality of texts and dictionaries. However, we have observed that <b>chemical</b> <b>names</b> are difficult to cluster using string similarity measures. In order to clearly demonstrate this difficulty, we compared the string similarities determined using the edit distance, the Monge-Elkan score, SoftTFIDF, and the bigram Dice coefficient for <b>chemical</b> <b>names</b> with those for non-chemical names. Results Our experimental results revealed the following: (1) The edit distance had the best performance in the matching of full forms, whereas Cohen et al. reported that SoftTFIDF with the Jaro-Winkler distance would yield the best measure for matching pairs of terms for their experiments. (2) For each of the string similarity measures above, the best threshold for term matching differs for <b>chemical</b> <b>names</b> and for non-chemical names; the difference is especially large for the edit distance. (3) Although the matching results obtained for <b>chemical</b> <b>names</b> using the edit distance, Monge-Elkan scores, or the bigram Dice coefficients are better than the result obtained for non-chemical names, the results were contrary when using SoftTFIDF. (4) A suitable weight for <b>chemical</b> <b>names</b> varies substantially from one for non-chemical names. In particular, a weight vector that has been optimized for non-chemical names is not suitable for <b>chemical</b> <b>names.</b> (5) The matching results using the edit distances improve further by dividing a set of full forms into two subsets, according to whether a full form is a <b>chemical</b> <b>name</b> or not. These results show that our hypothesis is acceptable, and that we can significantly improve the performance of abbreviation-full form clustering by computing <b>chemical</b> <b>names</b> and non-chemical names separately. Conclusions In conclusion, the discriminative application of string similarity methods to <b>chemical</b> and non-chemical <b>names</b> may be a simple yet effective way to improve the performance of term clustering. </p...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>chemical</b> <b>names</b> are the {{scientific}} names, {{based on the}} molecular structure of the drug. There are various systems of chemical nomenclature and thus various <b>chemical</b> <b>names</b> for any one substance. The most important is the IUPAC <b>name.</b> <b>Chemical</b> <b>names</b> are typically very long and too complex to be commonly used in referring to a drug in speech or in prose documents.
