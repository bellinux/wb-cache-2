5|$|At the {{succession}} of King Henry I, the new king imprisoned Ranulf in the Tower of London on 15 August 1100 on charges of embezzlement. His custodian, William de Mandeville, allowed the bishop to escape on 3 February 1101. Flambard {{was not only the}} first inmate of the prison, but also the first person to escape from it. A popular legend represents the bishop as descending from the window of his cell by a rope which <b>friends</b> <b>had</b> smuggled to him in a flagon of wine. Ranulf gave the wine to his guards, and after they were drunk and asleep, climbed down the rope to escape. His <b>friends</b> <b>had</b> arranged a ship to transport Ranulf, some of the bishop's treasure, and the bishop's elderly mother to Normandy. He took refuge across the English Channel with Henry's brother Robert Curthose, where {{he became one of the}} duke's principal advisors. King Henry dispossessed Ranulf of his lands at Whitsun in 1101, and the new Archbishop of York Gerard deposed him from his bishopric. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Anselm arranged for Flambard's trial in a papal court for simony, and a papal decree was issued against Ranulf.|$|E

50|$|The {{friendship}} {{paradox is}} the phenomenon first observed by the sociologist Scott L. Feld in 1991 {{that most people}} <b>have</b> fewer <b>friends</b> than their <b>friends</b> <b>have,</b> on average. It can be explained {{as a form of}} sampling bias in which people with greater numbers of <b>friends</b> <b>have</b> an increased likelihood of being observed among one's own friends. In contradiction to this, most people believe that they <b>have</b> more <b>friends</b> than their <b>friends</b> <b>have.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to examine whether adolescents 2 ̆ 7 conceptions of the influences of romantic relationships on the features of same-sex friendships varied with age and sex, and to examine how adolescents 2 ̆ 7 adjustment is related to their conceptions of friendships when one member of the friendship has a romantic relationship. Ninth (n = 198) and eleventh graders (n = 152) completed a questionnaire about their conceptions of friendship features both when one <b>friend</b> <b>had</b> a romantic relationship and when neither <b>friend</b> <b>had</b> a romantic relationship. Students also reported on the features of their best friendship and on their social, psychological, and academic adjustment. The results showed that conceptions of the impact of romantic relationships on friendship varied with age and sex. Ninth and eleventh graders viewed a friendship in which one <b>friend</b> <b>had</b> a romantic relationship as having less frequent interactions and less self-esteem support and intimacy, but more conflict, rivalry, and disloyalty than a friendship in which neither <b>friend</b> <b>had</b> a romantic relationship. Moreover, the effect of a romantic relationship on frequency of interaction was greater in the eleventh than the ninth grade. Eleventh graders also viewed friends as engaging in less co-rumination when one <b>friend</b> <b>had</b> a romantic partner than when neither <b>friend</b> <b>had</b> a romantic partner, while ninth graders did not. Compared to boys, girls viewed friendships as lower in intimacy and co-rumination and higher in conflict and rivalry when one <b>friend</b> <b>had</b> a romantic relationship than when neither <b>friend</b> <b>had</b> a romantic relationship. Adolescents who were better adjusted academically viewed friendships in which one <b>friend</b> <b>had</b> a romantic relationship as more supportive. Students who perceived themselves as more accepted by their peers had conceptions of such friendships as higher in intimacy. These results imply that with increasing age, romantic relationships have an increasingly negative impact on the closeness of friendships, compared to boys, girls 2 ̆ 7 friendships are more adversely influenced by a <b>friend</b> <b>having</b> a romantic relationship, and adolescents who expect friendships with a <b>friend</b> who <b>has</b> a romantic relationship to be characterized by greater support and intimacy and less conflict and rivalry show better adjustment. ...|$|R
5|$|Buckner had a keen {{interest}} in politics and <b>friends</b> <b>had</b> been urging him to run for governor since 1867, even while terms of his surrender confined him to Louisiana. Unwilling to violate these terms, he instructed a friend to withdraw his name from consideration if it was presented. In 1868, he was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention that nominated Horatio Seymour for president. Though Buckner had favored George H. Pendleton, he loyally supported the party's nominee throughout the campaign.|$|E
5|$|In 1773, Barbauld {{brought out}} {{her first book}} of poems, after her <b>friends</b> <b>had</b> praised them and {{convinced}} her to publish. The collection, entitled simply Poems, went through four editions in just one year and surprised Barbauld by its success. Barbauld became a respected literary figure in England on the reputation of Poems alone. The same year she and her brother, John Aikin, jointly published Miscellaneous Pieces in Prose, which was also well received. The essays in it (most of which were by Barbauld) were favourably compared to Samuel Johnson's.|$|E
5|$|Leaving Russia before Reed, {{who wanted}} {{to report on the}} Bolshevik debate about Russian {{participation}} in the war with Germany, Bryant returned to New York, arriving on February 18, 1918.

Under government pressure, The Masses had shut down. Working out of a room at the Brevoort Hotel, Bryant wrote articles about the October Revolution and speeches or cables urging support of the workers' government in Russia.|$|E

5|$|The Society of <b>Friends</b> <b>had</b> become {{established}} {{there by}} the mid-17th century. One Quaker family, the Clarks, started a business in sheepskin rugs, woollen slippers and, later, boots and shoes. This became C Clark which still has its headquarters in Street, but shoes are no longer manufactured there. Instead, in 1993, redundant factory buildings were converted to form Clarks Village, the first purpose-built factory outlet in the United Kingdom.

5|$|Arnold lived extravagantly in Philadelphia, {{and was a}} {{prominent}} figure on the social scene. During the summer of 1778, he met Peggy Shippen, the 18-year-old daughter of Judge Edward Shippen, a Loyalist sympathizer who had done business with the British while they occupied the city. Peggy had been courted by British Major John André during the British occupation of Philadelphia. Peggy and Arnold married on April 8, 1779. Peggy and her circle of <b>friends</b> <b>had</b> found methods of staying in contact with paramours across the battle lines, despite military bans on communication with the enemy. Some of this communication was effected through the services of Joseph Stansbury, a Philadelphia merchant.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} nine, Zakuani {{attracted}} interest from West Ham United's youth program. He later tried out for the youth team of Queens Park Rangers, and in 1997, he joined the Arsenal Academy. Zakuani became cocky and brash while not focusing on schoolwork and was released. His off-the-field issues culminated in serious injuries when {{he was involved in}} a crash while riding on a moped that one of his <b>friends</b> <b>had</b> stolen. Zakuani was unable to play for 18months. After losing interest in soccer and renewing his efforts in school, his teacher and mentor Paul Goodison took him to watch motivational speaker and evangelist Myles Munroe. This inspired Zakuani to renew his commitment to becoming a professional player and, although unsuccessful, he tried out for the senior teams of Queens Park Rangers, Wigan Athletic, AZ Alkmaar, and Real Valladolid.|$|E
5|$|Baker {{was born}} in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania, the second son of Alfred Thornton Baker, a wealthy upholsterer, and Mary Augusta Pemberton, a socialite. Alfred, known as Bobby to his <b>friends,</b> <b>had</b> played halfback while a student at Princeton University in the 1880s, the same school his father had attended. One of Baker's {{ancestors}} was Francis Rawle, a Quaker who emigrated to Philadelphia in 1688 {{and became one of}} the wealthiest members of the city. Baker was named after his uncle, Dr. Hobart Amory Hare, who was the obstetrician at his birth and president of the Jefferson Medical Hospital in Philadelphia. At the age of eleven, Baker and his twelve-year-old brother Thornton were sent to St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire. Baker's parents divorced in 1907 and both remarried.|$|E

5|$|During {{his final}} months in office, Patton drew {{criticism}} for abusing his patronage power. Critics charged {{that he had}} appointed several {{of his family and}} friends who were in non-merit system jobs to merit system positions, increasing their chances of being retained when a new administration took over. These charges were particularly damaging because, earlier in the year, the General Assembly had ordered Patton to cut 800 non-merit positions to help balance the budget. The Lexington Herald-Leader opined that these charges were more serious than those of the Conner affair. Patton maintained that his <b>friends</b> <b>had</b> followed proper personnel protocol in applying for and securing merit positions.|$|E
5|$|In 1932, Como left Canonsburg, {{moving about}} 100 miles away to Meadville, Pennsylvania, where his uncle had a barber {{shop in the}} Hotel Conneaut. Around 80 miles from Cleveland, it was a popular stop on the {{itinerary}} for dance bands who worked {{up and down the}} Ohio Valley. Como, Roselle, and their <b>friends</b> <b>had</b> gone to nearby Cleveland; their good times took them to the Silver Slipper Ballroom where Freddy Carlone and his orchestra were playing. Carlone invited anyone who thought he might have talent to come up and sing with his band. Young Como was terrified, but his friends urged him and pushed him onto the stage. Carlone was so impressed with Como's performance that he immediately offered him a job.|$|E
5|$|Otto Frank survived his {{internment}} in Auschwitz. After the war ended, {{he returned}} to Amsterdam, where he was sheltered by Jan and Miep Gies as he attempted to locate his family.

He attempted to determine the fates of his daughters' friends and learned many had been murdered. Sanne Ledermann, often mentioned in Anne's diary, had been gassed along with her parents; her sister, Barbara, a close friend of Margot's, had survived.

5|$|Shindler {{continued}} to pitch The Second Coming to other television networks while Davies sought other ventures. His next series {{was based on}} a gay friend who married a woman and fathered a child. He saw the relationship as a promising concept for an unconventional love story and asked the couple about their relationship to develop the show. After developing the series around the prejudice that he and his gay <b>friends</b> <b>had</b> shown, he realised he was creating caricatures for the purpose of exposing them, and instead focused on telling a traditional love story and gave the couple the traditionally British names of Bob Gossage and Rose Cooper.|$|E
5|$|Though women <b>Friends</b> <b>had</b> {{since the}} 1660s {{publicly}} preached, written and led, and traditional Quaker tenets held {{that men and}} women were equals, Quaker women met separately from the men to consider and decide a congregation's business. By the 1840s, some Hicksite Quakers determined to bring women and men together in their business meetings as an expression of their spiritual equality. In June 1848, approximately 200Hicksites, including the Hunts and the M'Clintocks, formed an even more radical Quaker group, known as the Yearly Meeting of Congregational Friends, or Progressive Friends. The Progressive Friends intended to further elevate the influence of women in affairs of the faith. They introduced joint business meetings of men and women, giving women an equal voice.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev's family, Yuri, Galina and Yuri Churbanov, were {{investigated}} and all, {{with the exception}} of Galina, were arrested on charges of political corruption during Mikhail Gorbachev's administration. Churbanov, Brezhnev's son-in-law, was sentenced to twelve years in prison on charges of large-scale embezzlement and corruption. By December 1988 Churbanov had been stripped of all state honours, and sent to a labour camp. Galina, {{along with the rest of}} Brezhnev's family, lost all their state privileges. The city of Brezhnev reverted to its old name Naberezhnye Chelny, and a group within the Soviet leadership wanted to rename all towns, street, factories and institutions bearing Brezhnev's name. This was actually carried through by the authorities in December 1988 when the Soviet Government issued a decree which stated all town, streets, factories, institutions and the like bearing Brezhnev's and Konstantin Chernenko's were to revert to their former name. According to his grandson Andrei Brezhnev, the very name Brezhnev had become a curse for the family, and several family members had been forced out of their jobs and their <b>friends</b> <b>had</b> deserted them. Brezhnev, who had inflated his role in World War II, was rescinded the Order of Victory on 21 September 1989 in a Supreme Soviet convocation.|$|E
