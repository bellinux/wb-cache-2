40|$|Abstract. Information <b>integrity</b> <b>policies</b> are {{traditionally}} enforced by {{access control mechanisms}} that prevent unauthorized users from modifying data. However, access control does not provide end-to-end assurance of integrity. For that reason, integrity guarantees {{in the form of}} noninterference assertions have been proposed. Despite the appeals of such information-flow based approaches to integrity, that solution is also unsatisfactory because it leads to a weaker notion of integrity than needed in practice. This paper attempts to clarify <b>integrity</b> <b>policies</b> by comparing and contrasting access control vs. information flow, <b>integrity</b> vs. confidentiality <b>policies,</b> and <b>integrity</b> vs. availability <b>policies.</b> The paper also examines data invariants as a way to strengthen integrity. The result is a better classification of information-integrity policies. ...|$|R

40|$|Protecting {{confidentiality}} of data has become increasingly important for computing systems. Information-flow techniques have been developed {{over the years to}} achieve that purpose, leading to special-purpose languages that guarantee information-flow security in programs. However, rather than producing a new language from scratch, informationflow security can also be provided by a library. This paper proposes a library in Haskell that, besides confidentiality, considers another important aspect of security: integrity of data. Integrity of data seeks to prevent that programs destroy, accidentally or maliciously, information. We describe how to enforce different <b>integrity</b> <b>policies</b> by access control, data invariants, and information-flow integrity. To the best of our knowledge, a library that combines confidentiality and <b>integrity</b> <b>policies</b> has not been previously considered. Augmenting the set of enforceable policies develops further the changes for the library to be attractive for programmers.

Lubchenco helped to strengthen science in the agency {{in a number of}} ways. First, the position of Chief Scientist, previously vacant for 16 years, was reinstated, although the Senate did not act to confirm the President’s nominee at this time. Second, NOAA doubled the number of senior scientist positions, and created a scientific Council of Fellows. Third, under her leadership, NOAA created its first Scientific <b>Integrity</b> <b>Policy.</b> The Scientific <b>Integrity</b> <b>Policy</b> allows NOAA scientists to speak freely to the media and public, and forbids the manipulation, suppression, distortion and misuse of science in the agency. Early in President Obama’s administration, he charged agencies with establishing strong scientific integrity policies that would ‘return science to its rightful place’ in government. NOAA’s Scientific <b>Integrity</b> <b>Policy</b> has been called the “Platinum Standard” for agency policies in protecting the rights of scientists to communicate freely and in ensuring policy makers will not suppress or modify scientific findings. In addition, a first-ever all-agency-scientist workshop was held to identify scientific priorities and ways to strengthen science at the agency. This workshop helped form the foundation of NOAA’s Next Generation Strategic Plan, which assesses the highest priority opportunities for NOAA to contribute to the advancement of society.|$|E
50|$|The {{model is}} {{primarily}} concerned with formalizing the notion of information integrity. Information integrity is maintained by preventing corruption of data items in a system due to either error or malicious intent. An <b>integrity</b> <b>policy</b> describes how the data items in the system should be kept valid from one state of the system to the next and specifies the capabilities of various principals in the system. The model defines enforcement rules and certification rules.|$|E
50|$|A {{computer}} security policy defines the goals and elements of an organization's computer systems. The definition can be highly formal or informal. Security policies are enforced by organizational policies or security mechanisms. A technical implementation defines whether a computer system is secure or insecure.

For example, the Bell-La Padula model is a confidentiality policy model, whereas Biba model is an <b>integrity</b> <b>policy</b> model.|$|E

40|$|Concerns {{regarding}} plagiarism and collusion {{in higher}} education have generated an extensive literature on the causes, composition and consequences of these practices, and {{the development and implementation}} of academic <b>integrity</b> <b>policies.</b> Although many disciplines use non-text-based assessments, such as computer programs, databases, spreadsheets, images and visual designs, the literature deals primarily with prose text. This paper reports the results of a national Australian survey of academics and students who use non-text-based assessments, principally in computing or visual design. The survey investigated perceptions of the adequacy of current academic <b>integrity</b> <b>policies,</b> how academics and students ensure adherence to these policies, and how academics detect and deal with breaches of academic integrity. The results reveal that a combination of education and assessment design methods are used to ensure compliance with academic <b>integrity</b> <b>policies,</b> that academics rely heavily on manual methods to detect breaches, and that they use both educational and punitive measures when breaches are detected. A consensus emerged that the current suite of academic <b>integrity</b> <b>policies</b> and associated educational efforts are inadequate for addressing issues related to assessments of these types. Participants perceived that existing policies and procedures regarding academic integrity are not always rigorously implemented for non-text-based assessments. A number of differences were evident between the views of academics and students, and between the computing and visual design streams. Future research could explore these differences more extensively and guide the development of discipline-specific guidelines, policies and procedures for non-text-based assessments...|$|R

5000|$|Quoting {{from the}} Carport <b>Integrity</b> <b>Policy</b> for the Arizona State Historic Preservation Office:As early as 1909, {{carports}} {{were used by}} the Prairie School architect Walter Burley Griffin in his design for the Sloane House in Elmhurst, Illinois (Gebhard, 1991: 110). By 1913, carports were also being employed by other Prairie School architects such as the Minneapolis firm of Purcell, Feick & Elmslie in their design for a residence at Lockwood Lake, Wisconsin. In this instance, the carport was termed an [...] "Auto Space" [...] (Gebhard, 1991: 110). The late architectural historian David Gebhard suggested that the term [...] "carport" [...] originated from the feature’s use in 1930s Streamline Moderne residences (Gebhard, 1991: 107). This term, which entered popular jargon in 1939, stemmed from the visual connection between these streamlined residences and nautical imagery. In the 1930s through the 1950s, carports were also being used by Frank Lloyd Wright in his Usonian Houses; an idea that he probably got from Griffin, a former associate.|$|E
