40|$|A metal-hydride {{heat pump}} (HHP) has been {{proposed}} to provide an advanced regenerable nonventing thermal sink for the liquid-cooled garment worn during an extravehicular activity (EVA). The conceptual design indicates {{that there is a}} potential for significant advantages over the one presently being used by shuttle crew personnel as well as those that have been proposed for future use with the space station. Compared to other heat pump designs, a HHP offers the potential for extended use with no electrical power requirements during the EVA. In addition, a reliable, compact design is possible due to the absence of moving parts other than high-reliability check valves. Because there are many subtleties in the properties of metal hydrides for heat pump applications, it is essential that a prototype hydride heat pump be constructed with the selected materials before a committment is made for the final design. Particular care must be given to the <b>evaporator</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> worn by the astronaut since the performance of hydride heat pumps is generally heat transfer limited...|$|E
40|$|Maintaining future high {{performance}} microprocessor chips within an acceptable {{operating temperature range}} (e. g. less than 85 °C), is likely to involve the removal of large quantities of heat (e. g. several hundred Watts), from small areas (e. g. 1 - 2 cm 2), necessitating very high heat fluxes. To date, heat dissipation from computer chips has generally been achieved by means of heat sinks and fans; however, alternative, more effective cooling techniques {{are likely to be}} needed in the future. Three UK universities are undertaking a 3 -year collaborative project to develop a miniature vapor compression refrigeration (VCR) system, suitable for future microprocessor and electronic cooling. The design and testing of a novel porous media based <b>evaporator</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> is being undertaken by Newcastle University. Preliminary results suggest that this device should be capable of achieving the high heat fluxes required. The University of Oxford's Cryogenics Group has developed specialised oil-free compressors for low temperature cooling systems for space applications. Based on this work, a new design of compressor has been developed, which is suitable for use with miniature VCR devices. The performance of such systems is being studied by means of simulation by London South Bank University. Models developed to date include an overall miniature VCR system model, and a detailed model of the compressor. The current paper will focus on the design and construction of the compressor and the compressor model developed. The mathematical modelling approach used will be discussed, and the results from a number of simulations will be reported. © 2010 IEEE...|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} the result of the {{cooperative}} research and development agreement (CRADA) between Oak Ridge National Laboratory and E. I. Du Pont De Nemours and Company, Inc., (CRADA No. 92 - 0161) for testing the use of heat exchangers as the evaporator and condenser in an air-conditioning rig. Heat exchangers at typical realistic operating conditions were tested with R- 22 and with its potential replacement, a ternary mixture of R- 32 (30 %) /R- 125 (10 %) /R- 134 a(60 %). A test rig was built that provided for operation of the low-temperature exchanger (evaporator) with flooded coils. The test results indicated that the performance of the <b>evaporator</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> using ternary mixture, in terms of cooling capacity, would be around 7. 4 % less than the performance using R- 22. The cooling capacity for both refrigerants improved with flooded evaporator operation by 8. 6 % for R- 22 and by 15 % for ternary mixture. Compared with R- 22 operation, operation with ternary mixture results in slightly higher compressor discharge pressure, lower compressor discharge temperature, slightly lower compressor power consumption, and a higher compressor high-low pressure ratio. Temperature glide for ternary mixture, for both evaporator and condenser, was clearly evident, but not as pronounced as expected because of the pressure drop (and thus the temperature drop) along the coils. Further improvement of the performance of ternary mixture is possible if the evaporator is arranged in a counter-cross-flow configuration to take advantage of the temperature glide. Current evaporator designs are mostly concurrent-cross-flow, which is more appropriate for single-component refrigerants or azeotropic refrigerant mixtures...|$|E
40|$|This work {{refers to}} an {{innovative}} integrated system for the simultaneous production of fresh water and electricity. In particular, a 1 kWe Stirling engine coupled with a thermal desalination plant has been considered for the purpose. The prototype, which refers to the distributed micro cogeneration field, has the final aim of building and testing a single effect distillation plant with a fresh water production of about 150 L/d. Firstly, thermodynamic theories and numerical analysis {{have been carried out}} to define the final prototype configuration. Then, an experimental test phase has been carried out to evaluate the actual plant performance. The experimental analysis has been in good agreement with the predicted results. In particular, at nominal operating conditions (@ 50 °C) the maximum heat transfer rate was higher than the <b>evaporator</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> designed condition (5. 5 kWt). Despite the non-ideal plant thermal insulation, fresh water production reached a maximum of about 7 L/h at best operating conditions, proving a good process efficiency. According to the behavior predicted by the model, fresh water production is strongly dependent on the temperature difference between the heating fluid and the salt water in the evaporator tank while it is weakly influenced by the salt content of the treated water. Moreover, the apparatus exhibited a very good response to varying thermal power input thus confirming the opportunity to feed the desalination plant also with different forms of waste heat. More precisely, the plant average efficiency was about 1. 3 L/kWh of energy input with minimum and maximum values equal to 1. 16 and 1. 42 L/kWh. Definitely the proposed solution, studied for a coupling with a 1 kWe Stirling engine, can be easily applied also to the other micro-CHP technologies...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project was to investigate a passive containment cooling system (PCCS) for the double concrete containment of the Korean Next Generation Reactor (KNGR). Two conceptual PCCS designs: the thermosyphon loop and the internal evaporator-only (IEO) were studied. Based on their requirements, a number of full-scale single-tub experiments have been conducted to investigate {{the performance of the}} evaporator, the key component in both PCCS designs. The thermosyphon loop design consists of an evaporator (with integrated exit steam separator) and a condenser heat exchanger. The <b>evaporator</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> is located in the containment atmosphere; on its outside tube surfaces steam condensation in presence of noncondensable gases takes place. The condenser heat exchanger is placed in a large water pool located exterior to the containment building; its storage capability serves as the final heat sink. The numerical simulation in GOTHIC of this design shows that, depending on the water pool initial temperature, ten to fourteen thermosyphon loops are needed {{in order to keep the}} containment temperature and the total pressure below the design values for the design basis accident (60 psia) and three-to-five loops for the severe accident (120 psia). The IEO design is similar to the PCCS concept using internal condensers discussed earlier by KAIST. The difference between the IEO and the thermosyphon loop is that the steam exciting the evaporator is directly vented to atmosphere in the IEO rather than the exterior condenser in the thermosyphon loop design. The target of this system is to keep containment pressure below 8. 3 bar (12 psia) in the absence of any other containment cooling following a severe accident, which postulates core damage and hydrogen combustion. A DBA scenario (LB LOCA, ECCS flow and no spray) and a severe accident scenario (LB LOCA without ECCS and containment spray flow, 100 % Zr oxidation and complete hydrogen combustion), as used in KNGR safety analyses (similar to those in the standard safety analysis report for SYSTEM 80 +) were modeled using the GOTHIC computer code. GOTHIC performance analysis of the IEO for the DBA condition shows that this concept can likely meet the design peak pressure of 60 psia, if 10 IEOs are used assuming that the separator water level is sufficiently low. However it is inherently difficult to meet the second design criterion of half of peak design pressure within 24 hours because the temperature difference between the containment and the IEO wall is low in the long term. Fir the severe accident, even with two IEOs, there is no problem in meeting the design criteria of 120 psia during the long-term period, with a generous margin. In addition the peak pressure is just 110 psia even assuming 100 % zirconium oxidation and the complete burning of hydrogen. The fouling effect by aerosols on the IEO performance was calculated to be negligible. Judging from the above findings for the performance analysis involving DBAs and severe accidents, it is concluded that the IEO has considerable merit for severe accident mitigation and is worthy of further evaluation. A smooth tube, an axial-finned tube and a radial-finned tube have been tested to experimentally estimate the performance of the reference smooth evaporator tube and the enhancement factors, which may be achieved by finning smooth tubes. An empirical correlation has been developed for numerical analysis use. The Diffusion Layer Model (DLM) has been recommended for use beyond the range of this empirical correlation. Condensation in the presence of helium and tube bundle effects were also studied. Theoretical analysis and experimental results of the two finned tubes suggested an enhancement factor of 4 be used in GOTHIC simulation of the PCCS concept based on smooth tube modeling.

Coil fouling, the deposition of indoor dusts and other particulate matter on <b>evaporator</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers,</b> increases system pressure drop and, correspondingly, decreases system air flow and air conditioner performance. In this paper, we apply experimental and simulation results describing particle deposition on evaporator coils as well as research about indoor particle and dust concentrations to determine coil fouling rates.

The most important parameters in determining coil fouling times are the efficiency of the filter and indoor particle concentrations, although filter bypass and duct and coil design are important as well. The reduced air flows that result from coil fouling cause typical efficiency and capacity degradations of less than 5 %, however they can be much greater for marginal systems or extreme conditions. These energy issues, as well as possible indoor air quality issues resulting from fouling by biological aerosols, suggest that regular coil cleaning to ameliorate low flow and the elimination of filter bypass should be an important part of residential {{air conditioning}} commissioning and maintenance practices...|$|R

For coupling with a LT-PEMFC today an external preferential oxidation or methanation is added. A HT-PEMFC can be coupled directly to the fuel processor at a temperature level of 160 °C. It is discussed that HT-PEMFC systems can exceed the electrical efficiency of LT-PEMFC systems up to five percentage points because of the integration of high quality heat from the fuel cell cooling cycle. In process simulations with AspenPlus® this efficiency advantage could be confirmed. But further investigations concerning heat integration showed for both systems the advantage of using the condensation enthalpy of the flue gas provided by the system burner.

Data acquisition and visualization are realized in a LabView application, which also includes thermodynamic parameters that cannot be measured directly, but are calculated in real time by means of thermophysical property library, Coolprop (Bell et al., 2014). The test rig can be charged with different working fluids. This paper deals with the results obtained during test runs with SES 36 (Solkatherm) and R 245 fa, which are commonly used fluids in low temperature heat recovery applications. The oil temperature at the evaporator inlet is limited to 125 °C because of the expander design: the average temperature may not exceed 120 °C and the maximum pressure is 12 bar. Subcooling caused by non-condensable gases present in the working fluid, typically the case for installations with sub-ambient pressure in the condenser (in particular Solkatherm-filled), is taken into account...|$|R
40|$|The {{solubility}} {{of calcium}} phosphate in concentrated dairy brine streams {{is important in}} understanding mineral scaling on equipment, such as membrane modules, <b>evaporators,</b> and <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers,</b> and in brine pond operation. In this study, the solubility of calcium phosphate has been assessed {{in the presence of}} up to 300 g/L sodium chloride as well as lactose, organic acids, and anions at 10, 30, and 50 °C. As a neutral molecule, lactose has a marginal but still detectable effect upon calcium solubility. However, additions of sodium chloride up to 100 g/L result in a much greater increase in calcium solubility. Beyond this point, the concentrations of ions in the solution decrease significantly. These changes in calcium solubility can readily be explained through changes in the activity coefficients. There is little difference in calcium phosphate speciation between 10 and 30 °C. However, at 50 °C, the ratio of calcium to phosphate in the solution is lower than at the other temperatures and varies less with ionic strength. While the addition of sodium lactate has less effect upon calcium solubility than sodium citrate, it still has a greater effect than sodium chloride at an equivalent ionic strength. Conversely, when these organic anions are present in the solution in the acid form, the effect of pH dominates and results in much higher solubility and a calcium/phosphate ratio close to one, indicative of dicalcium phosphate dihydrate as the dominant solid phase. embarg...|$|R

40|$|The {{experimental}} {{system for}} the transcritical CO 2 residential air-conditioning with an internal <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> was built. The effects of working conditions on system performance were experimentally studied. Based on the experimental dada, the second law analysis on the transcritical CO 2 system was performed. The effects of working conditions on the total exergetic efficiency of the system were investigated. The results show that in the studied parameter ranges, the exergetic efficiency of the system increases with the increases of gas cooler side air inlet temperature, gas cooler side air inlet velocity and evaporating temperature. And it will decrease with the increases of evaporator side air inlet temperature and velocity. Then, a complete exergetic analysis was performed for the entire CO 2 transcritical cycle including compressor, gas cooler, expansion valve, <b>evaporator</b> and internal <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> under different working conditions. The average exergy loss in gas cooler is the highest one under all working conditions which is about 30. 7 % of the total exergy loss in the system. The second is the average exergy loss in expansion valve which is about 24. 9 % of the total exergy loss, followed by the exergy losses in evaporator and compressor, which account for 21. 9 % and 19. 5 %, respectively. The exergy loss in internal <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> is the lowest one which is only about 3. 0 %. So in the optimization design of the transcritical CO 2 residential air-conditioning system more attentions should {{be paid to the}} gas cooler and expansion valve.
