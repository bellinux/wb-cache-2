5|$|Citizen Kane eschews the {{traditional}} linear, chronological narrative, and tells Kane's story entirely in flashback using <b>different</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> {{many of them}} from Kane's aged and forgetful associates, the cinematic equivalent of the unreliable narrator in literature. Welles also dispenses {{with the idea of}} a single storyteller and uses multiple narrators to recount Kane's life. The use of multiple narrators was unheard of in Hollywood films. Each narrator recounts a different part of Kane's life, with each story partly overlapping. The film depicts Kane as an enigma, a complicated man who, in the end, leaves viewers with more questions than answers as to his character, such as the newsreel footage where he is attacked for being both a communist and a fascist.|$|E
5|$|Representative {{of the new}} {{historical}} perspective is the 2003 biography by Pauline Croft. Reviewer John Cramsie summarises her findings:Croft's overall assessment of James is appropriately mixed. She recognises his good intentions in matters like Anglo-Scottish union, his openness to <b>different</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> and his agenda of a peaceful foreign policy within his kingdoms' financial means. His actions moderated frictions between his diverse peoples. Yet he also created new ones, particularly by supporting colonisation that polarised the crown's interest groups in Ireland, obtaining insufficient political benefit with his open-handed patronage, an unfortunate {{lack of attention to}} the image of monarchy (particularly after the image-obsessed regime of Elizabeth), pursuing a pro-Spanish foreign policy that fired religious prejudice and opened the door for Arminians within the English church, and enforcing unpalatable religious changes on the Scottish Kirk. Many of these criticisms are framed within a longer view of James' reigns, including the legacy – now understood to be more troubled – which he left Charles I.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes Venus only grazes the Sun {{during a}} transit. In {{this case it}} is {{possible}} that in some areas of the Earth a full transit can be seen while in other regions there is only a partial transit (no second or third contact). The last transit of this type was on 6 December 1631, and the next such transit will occur on 13 December 2611. It is also possible that a transit of Venus can be seen {{in some parts of the}} world as a partial transit, while in others Venus misses the Sun. Such a transit last occurred on 19 November 541 BC, and the next transit of this type will occur on 14 December 2854. These effects occur due to parallax, since the size of the Earth affords <b>different</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> with slightly different lines of sight to Venus and the Sun. It can be demonstrated by closing an eye and holding a finger in front of a smaller more distant object; when you open the other eye and close the first, the finger will no longer be in front of the object.|$|E

25|$|The ruins are {{remarkable}} {{more for}} their extent than their magnificence: the chief objects of interest are the projecting corbels in the eastern front, which appear to have supported an open corridor; there are some large vaults, which were probably prisons.

25|$|A bimodule (or correspondence) is a Hilbert space H with module {{actions of}} two {{commuting}} von Neumann algebras. Bimodules {{have a much}} richer structure than that of modules. Any bimodule over two factors always gives a subfactor since {{one of the factors}} is always contained in the commutant of the other. There is also a subtle relative tensor product operation due to Connes on bimodules.

25|$|Stereopsis {{was first}} {{described}} by Wheatstone in 1838. In 1840 {{he was awarded}} the Royal Medal of the Royal Society for his explanation of binocular vision, a research which led him to make stereoscopic drawings and construct the stereoscope. He showed that our impression of solidity is gained by the combination in the mind of two separate pictures of an object taken by both of our eyes from <b>different</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>view.</b> Thus, in the stereoscope, an arrangement of lenses or mirrors, two photographs of the same object taken from different points are so combined as to make the object stand out with a solid aspect. Sir David Brewster improved the stereoscope by dispensing with the mirrors, and bringing it into its existing form with lenses.|$|E
25|$|I find it {{amazing that}} he wrote this in the time period he did. It's very prophetic, {{it seems to be}} in line with a more modern {{understanding}} of Jesus that readers of The Course in Miracles and Marianne Williamson are a large part of vocalizing. But even fundamentalists would enjoy this book… being how it is written from the opinion of 80 <b>different</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> many of which do proclaim him the Son of God. Ultimately, any view can be thoughtfully stimulating because the people of any opinion have personalities and background given that support why they view Jesus with their perspective. The overall impression I received from this beautiful prose is the beauty and message of Jesus, the devotion, admiration, gratitude and love inspired by him, and the grace which he exuded with confident compassion. And whether he was God, man, a combination of both that we all are potentially, or a combination we can only idolize with an envious self-debasing distorted form of humility, this book shows him to be nothing less than relevant to our comprehension.|$|E

500|$|Many {{dictator}} novels, including I, the Supreme {{belong to}} the Latin American Boom, a literary movement {{which began in the}} 1960s and 1970s, when the work of a group of relatively young Latin American novelists became widely circulated in Europe and throughout the world. The Boom novels were essentially modernist novels, which according to Pope, relied on superposition of <b>different</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> blurring time and linearity. He further notes, [...] "linguistically self assured, it used the vernacular without apologies." [...] Other notable characteristics of the Boom include the treatment of both [...] "rural and urban settings," [...] internationalism, an emphasis on both the historical and the political, as well as [...] "questioning of regional as well as, or more than, national identity; awareness of hemisphereic as well as worldwide economic and ideological issues; polemicism; and timeliness." ...|$|E
500|$|Critic Pierre A.

He emphasized that the unity of Angelou's autobiographies underscored one of her central themes: the injustice of racism and how to fight it. [...] Angelou's biographies, beginning with Caged Bird, consisted of [...] "a sequence of lessons about resisting racist oppression". This sequence led Angelou, as the protagonist, from [...] "helpless rage and indignation to forms of subtle resistance, and finally to outright and active protest" [...] throughout all seven of her autobiographies. [...] Angelou changed her views in the course of her autobiographies about Black-white relationships and learned to accept <b>different</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>view.</b> It was changes in how she regarded race, and her views of white people, that provided Angelou with freedom. According to Hagen, one of Angelou's themes was that humans tend to be more alike than different.|$|E

500|$|The {{narrative}} mode of Burger's Daughter alternates between Rosa Burger's internal monologues and {{the anonymous}} narrator, whom Gordimer calls [...] "Rosa's conscious analysis, her reasoning approach {{to her life}} and to this country, and... my exploration as a writer of what she doesn't know even when she thinks she's finding out". Abdul R. JanMohamed, professor of English and African American Literature at Emory University, calls this change of perspective a [...] "stylistic bifurcation", which allows the reader to see Rosa from <b>different</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> rendering her a complex character who is full of contradictions. The two narratives, the subjective and the objective viewpoints, complement each other. JanMohamed explains that while the objective, third-person narrative is factual and neutral, the subjective first-person narrative, Rosa's voice, is intense and personal. Rosa's monologues are directed towards Conrad, her lover, {{in the first part}} of the story, her father's former wife, Katya, while Rosa is in France, and her father after she returns to South Africa. Because her imagined audience is always sympathetic and never questions her, Rosa's confessions are honest and open.|$|E
500|$|Beginning with Caged Bird {{and ending}} with her final autobiography, Angelou used the metaphor of a bird, which {{represented}} Angelou's confinement resulting from racism and depression, struggling to escape its cage, {{as described in the}} Paul Laurence Dunbar poem [...] "Sympathy". [...] Angelou's autobiographies can be placed in the African-American literature tradition of political protest. [...] Their unity underscored one of Angelou's central themes: the injustice of racism and how to fight it. [...] According to scholar Pierre A. Walker, all of Angelou's books described [...] "a sequence of lessons about resisting racist oppression". [...] In the course of her autobiographies, her views about Black-white relationships changed and she learned to accept <b>different</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>view.</b> [...] Angelou's theme of identity was established from the beginning of her autobiographies, with the opening lines in Caged Bird, and like other female writers in the late 1960s and early 1970s, she used the autobiography to reimagine ways of writing about women's lives and identities in a male-dominated society. Her original goal was to write about the lives of Black women in America, but it evolved in her later volumes to document {{the ups and downs of}} her life.|$|E
500|$|The Boom {{novels are}} {{essentially}} modernist novels. [...] They treat time as nonlinear, often use {{more than one}} perspective or narrative voice and feature {{a great number of}} neologisms (the coining of new words or phrases), puns and even profanities. [...] As Pope writes, in reference to the style of the Boom: [...] "It relied on a Cubist superposition of <b>different</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> it made time and lineal progress questionable, and it was technically complex. Linguistically self assured, it used the vernacular without apologies." [...] Other notable characteristics of the Boom include the treatment of both [...] "rural and urban settings", internationalism, an emphasis on both the historical and the political, as well as [...] "questioning of regional as well as, or more than, national identity; awareness of hemisphereic as well as worldwide economic and ideological issues; polemicism; and timeliness." [...] Boom literature breaks down the barriers between the fantastical and the mundane, transforming this mixture into a new reality. [...] Of the Boom writers, Gabriel García Márquez is most closely {{associated with the use of}} magical realism; indeed, he is credited with bringing it [...] "into vogue" [...] after the publishing of One Hundred Years of Solitude in 1967.|$|E
