40|$|Abstract — The S 1000 D {{specification}} {{is developed}} {{as the standard}} format to describe technical publications in aerospace and military field. The S 1000 D supports systematically classifying technical information about various equipments in XML format. Most technical information about equipments contains procedural information about installation, operation, and maintenance. The procedural information can be effectively described using graphical description methods rather than using textual description like XML. Also, In UML, activity diagrams {{can be used to}} describe the business and operation step-by-step workflows. In the S 1000 D, there are many types of <b>data</b> <b>modules</b> and procedural <b>data</b> <b>modules</b> regarding procedural information.

When the object has achieved the required replication degree, its index {{is said to be}} complete, otherwise it is partial.

50|$|In 2011 a {{major effort}} to {{renovate}} the MonetDB codebase was started. As part of it, the code for the MonetDB 4 kernel and its XQuery components were frozen. In MonetDB 5, parts of the SQL layer were pushed into the kernel. The resulting changes created a difference in internal APIs, as it transitioned from MonetDB Instruction Language (MIL) to MonetDB Assembly Language (MAL). Older, no-longer maintained top-level query interfaces were also removed. First was XQuery, which relied on MonetDB 4 and was never ported to version 5. The experimental Jaql interface support was removed with the October 2014 release. With the July 2015 release, MonetDB gained support for read-only data sharding and persistent indices.

5000|$|While {{cellular}} {{is becoming}} more common, many machines still use landlines (POTS, DSL, cable) to connect to the IP network. The cellular M2M communications industry emerged in 1995 when Siemens set up a department inside its mobile phones business unit to develop and launch a GSM <b>data</b> <b>module</b> called [...] "M1" [...] based on the Siemens mobile phone S6 for M2M industrial applications, enabling machines to communicate over wireless networks. In October 2000, the modules department formed a separate business unit inside Siemens called [...] "Wireless Modules" [...] which in June 2008 became a standalone company called Cinterion Wireless Modules. The first M1 module was used for early point of sale (POS) terminals, in vehicle telematics, remote monitoring and tracking and tracing applications. Machine to machine technology was first embraced by early implementers such as GM and Hughes Electronics Corporation who realized the benefits and future potential of the technology. By 1997, machine to machine wireless technology became more prevalent and sophisticated as ruggedized modules were developed and launched for {{the specific needs of}} different vertical markets such as automotive telematics.|$|E

The brick architecture {{is divided into two}} parts - the Index Module and the <b>Data</b> <b>Module.</b> The index module keeps a list of the list of all the replicas that are cached by the disc, mapped with their hashes. In addition, for each object that is stored, the IM also keeps a list of locations of all other replicas of the object. IM listens to the MRL and updates itself according to membership changes and also according to data being entered into BitVault system or being retrieved from it. The IM is also responsible to initiate repair of replicas once it is informed of a damaged one, and to ask for repair of replicas in its store. The IM is connected to a small Access Module, which serves as the gateway to external clients.Data module stores replicas of objects to a local disc. Along with the object, its metadata such as its hash key and its degree of replication in the BitVault system is also kept.|$|E

Since there is no data compression, after 20 tape copies of multi generations there is no noticeable loss of quality.

The <b>Data</b> <b>Module</b> could record and play back 2k DPX files at 6 frames per second over a HIPPI connection.

5000|$|In {{the actual}} course of events, Captain Janeway {{had agreed to}} provide the Vaskans with medical {{supplies}} in exchange for dilithium crystals. The Kyrians, who were {{at war with the}} Vaskans, boarded Voyager to stop the deal, which they thought was a military alliance of some sort. During their time on the ship, they stole a <b>data</b> <b>module</b> carrying a backup copy of the Doctor. Seven hundred years later, this module was part of a Kyrian museum exhibit which showed their version of the encounter. This biased encounter showed Voyager as a warship with a savage and sadistic crew that was willing to commit genocide. Even the Vaskan in the simulation became horrified over the atrocities committed, but the simulated Janeway told him {{it was too late to}} stop now. Quarren, the curator at the museum, always fascinated by Voyagers story even though they were [...] "the bad guys," [...] had found (with the help from an archaeological team) the Doctor's backup module three weeks prior. He was able to activate it using Voyagers own tools. The Doctor, upon seeing this biased simulated version of history, is appalled and offers to show Quarren his own accurate version of events from 700 years ago aboard Voyager. Initially, the Doctor's claims that Voyager was unfairly depicted by the Kyrians are ignored, and he is told he could be held accountable for war crimes when he presents his version of history before the Commission of Arbiters. The Doctor states, however, that a presently non-functional Starfleet medical tricorder would settle the issue of who killed Tedran, a Kyrian revolutionary hero who died during a raid on Voyager.|$|E
