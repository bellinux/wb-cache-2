50|$|The {{operation}} of the door open button is transparent, immediately opening and holding the door, typically until a timeout occurs and the <b>door</b> <b>closes.</b> The {{operation of}} the <b>door</b> <b>close</b> button is less transparent, and it often appears to do nothing, leading to frequent but incorrect reports that the <b>door</b> <b>close</b> button is a placebo button: either not wired up at all, or inactive in normal service. Working door open and <b>door</b> <b>close</b> buttons are required by code in many jurisdictions, including the United States, specifically for emergency operation: in independent mode, {{the door open and}} <b>door</b> <b>close</b> buttons are used to manually open or <b>close</b> the <b>door.</b> Beyond this, programming varies significantly, with some <b>door</b> <b>close</b> buttons immediately <b>closing</b> the <b>door,</b> but in other cases being delayed by an overall timeout, so the <b>door</b> cannot be <b>closed</b> until a few seconds after opening. In this case (hastening normal closure), the <b>door</b> <b>close</b> button has no effect. However, the <b>door</b> <b>close</b> button will cause a hall call to be ignored (so the door won't reopen), and once the timeout has expired, the <b>door</b> <b>close</b> will immediately <b>close</b> the <b>door,</b> for example to cancel a door open push. The minimum timeout for automatic <b>door</b> <b>closing</b> in the US is 5 seconds, which is a noticeable delay if not overridden.|$|R

Don defeats Vardhaan and his thugs, and kills Jabbar. Don ultimately saves the entire team. Don obtains his immunity papers, surrendering the plates and a disc with information about his team.

25|$|Day-to-day {{operations}} will {{be handled}} rather {{like those of}} Docklands Light Railway, with service employees riding in some trains {{to watch out for}} disruptive passengers and unusual occurrences and to supply information to passengers. Unlike the DLR however, not every train will be accompanied by a service employee, and again unlike the DLR, service employees have no task in the actual operation of the train. Hence the grade of automation is mixed between GoA 3 - Driverless, and GoA 4 - Unattended Train Operation (UTO). <b>Doors</b> <b>close</b> automatically, supervised by light barriers and pressure-sensitive door edges. Only in the case of service disruptions will a service employee take over the task of driving the train. For this purpose, all service employees are fully trained drivers.|$|E

Shifu is alarmed and sends his messenger, the goose Zeng, with a request for the prison to heighten security in order to prevent Tai Lung's escape. He then holds a kung fu tournament for the Furious Five so that Oogway may identify the Dragon Warrior, the one kung fu master worthy of receiving the Dragon Scroll and capable of defeating Tai Lung. Forced to take a cumbersome noodle cart to the tournament, Po arrives as the arena <b>doors</b> <b>close</b> and is unable to enter. Desperate to see the Dragon Warrior chosen, Po straps himself to a set of fireworks, rockets into the sky, and crashes {{into the middle of the}} arena and opens his eyes to see Oogway pointing his finger at him.

500|$|The {{episode was}} one of the most {{expensive}} in the series at the time, with two visual effects milestones for the series. During one of the sequences, the visual effects team switched from stock explosions on 2D to 3D versions. The producers wished to exceed the minute-long Horizon sequence in the previous episode. The scene where the <b>doors</b> <b>close</b> while the shield is collapsing was merely stock footage from [...] "Hot Zone", with the CGI of the shield added on. When the producers conceived the idea for the space jump between Sheppard and Zelenka, they thought it would be [...] "cool", as well as thinking that they were possibly too apprehensive. [...] However, the sequence was pulled off, and Paul Mullie described the jump as [...] "one of the best visual effects we have ever done."

Geraldine shouts to alert them, {{and those in the}} wardrobe pretend they did not hear Mark and Liz's conversation. Mark and Liz reluctantly enter the wardrobe. As the <b>doors</b> <b>close,</b> Rachel's boyfriend Lee enters the room, but as the wardrobe has become more cramped, Stuart and Lee hide under the bed and Ian moves to the en suite bathroom. Stuart and Carl argue, and it is revealed that Carl has a fear of intimacy. When [...] "Stinky" [...] John enters the room, both those in the wardrobe and under the bed claim there is no room, so he hides behind a curtain. Jeremy enters the room and tells Rebecca he is going to pick up another guest from the train station, but as he turns to leave he mistakenly calls her [...] "Rachel". Andrew, Rebecca's father, enters and becomes annoyed when he sees people hiding in different places. He forces Jeremy, Stuart, Lee and Stinky John into the wardrobe with everyone else and follows them in.|$|E

2500|$|... 16. Duet. The Queen warns Hamlet {{that he has}} {{offended}} his father, and she may be {{powerless to}} save his life (The Queen: Hamlet, ma douleur est immense! [...] "Hamlet, my grief is great!"). Hamlet asks, who has offended his father? She denies any understanding of his meaning. Hamlet blocks her attempt to leave, tries to force her to confront her guilt (Hamlet: Ah! que votre Ã¢me sans refuge pleure sur les devoirs trahis [...] "Ah! Let your defenseless heart weep over duties betrayed"). Hamlet leads his mother to the two portraits and points to the portrait of his father (Hamlet: Ici la grÃ¢ce et la beautÃ© sereines [...] "Here are grace and serene beauty"), then to the other portrait (LÃ , tous les crimes de la terre! [...] "There, all crimes of the earth!"). The Queen begs for mercy, kneeling before Hamlet (The Queen: Pardonne, hÃ©las! ta voix m'accable! [...] Forgive me, alas! Your voice devastates me!"). The Queen collapses on a couch. The orchestra repeats the distinctive ostinato first heard in the Ramparts Scene as the accompaniment to Hamlet's aria (Spectre infernal!). The light dims, and the Ghost appears behind the couch, one arm extended toward Hamlet (Ghost: Mon fils! [...] "My son!"). Hamlet pulls back in confusion. The Ghost warns Hamlet (Ghost: Souviens-toi... mais Ã©pargne ta mÃ¨re! [...] "Do not forget... but spare your mother!"). As the Ghost vanishes, the orchestra plays the theme of Hamlet's Promise, and the <b>doors</b> <b>close</b> themselves. Hamlet asks his mother not to think he is mad; his rage has calmed.
