40|$|Electroslag {{remelted}} cast iron-aluminum alloys {{having the}} compositions: 1) Fe- 16 Al- 0. 5 C, 2) Fe- 10 Al 0. 5 C, and 3) Fe- 8 Al- 0. 5 C {{were employed to}} investigate the effect of Al on the oxidation behavior of Fe- 0. 5 C alloys in the temperature range 973 - 1273 K. Microstructural and phase analyses of these alloys revealed distribution of a carbide phase, Fe 3 AlC 0. 692 in the Fe 3 Al matrix of alloy I and in Fe-Al matrix of alloys 2 and 3. The oxidation behavior of these alloys {{was found to be}} dependent upon relative composition and stability of the carbide and matrix phases. High-Al content alloys were <b>free</b> <b>from</b> <b>decarburization,</b> whereas low-Al content alloys suffered from decarburization...|$|E
50|$|The heating {{of steel}} is {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} method to alter the carbon content. When steel is heated in an oxidizing environment, the oxygen combines with the iron to form an iron-oxide layer, which protects the steel <b>from</b> <b>decarburization.</b> When the steel turns to austenite, however, the oxygen combines with iron to form slag, which provides no protection <b>from</b> <b>decarburization.</b> The formation of slag and scale actually increases decarburization, because the iron oxide keeps oxygen {{in contact with the}} decarburization zone even after the steel is moved into an oxygen-free environment, such as the coals of a forge. Thus, the carbon atoms begin combining with the surrounding scale and slag to form both carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, which is released into the air.|$|R
40|$|Quenching and {{partitioning}} (Q&P) {{has been}} developed as a novel steel heat treatment to produce advanced high-strength microstructures consisting of a martensitic matrix containing significant amounts of retained austenite. Austenite stabilization is hypothesized to result <b>from</b> <b>decarburization</b> of the martensite and transport into the austenite. Differential scanning calorimetry was employed to study Q&P microstructures. Two exothermic events were observed when heating a Q& P sample from room temperature to 600 C. An activation energy suggesting a mechanism controlled by carbon diffusion in bcc iron is obtained for the first peak which {{is believed to be}} associated with carbon partitioning. The second peak is believed to be associated with austenite decomposition...|$|R
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{model of}} oxygen steelmaking {{that includes the}} kinetics of scrap melting, flux dissolution, slag chemistry, temperature profile of the system, formation and residence of metal droplets in the emulsion, and kinetics of decarburization reaction in different reaction zones was developed. This paper discussed the development {{and the application of}} the model into an industrial practice. The results from the model were consistent with the plant data from the study of Cicutti et al. The model suggested that 45 % of the total carbon was removed via emulsified metal droplets and the remaining was removed from the impact zone during the entire blow. It was found that the residence time of droplets as well as decarburization reaction rate via emulsified droplets was a strong function of bloating behavior of the droplets. This model is the first attempt in the open literature that allows for the decarburization kinetics of the impact zone to be predicted separately <b>from</b> <b>decarburization</b> kinetics of the emulsion...|$|R
40|$|Two {{types of}} {{commercial}} cermet powders WC- 10 Co- 4 Cr and nanostructured WC- 12 Co were modified by cladding thin layers of magnesium oxide onto their surface. The {{objective was to}} protect the WC phase <b>from</b> <b>decarburization</b> that regularly results from thermal spray. As-received and cladded powders were deposited by using the HVOF thermal spray technique. The coatings features were investigated by using several characterization techniques. The results show that original spray powders were thermally protected by the layer of magnesium oxide clad on their surface {{that acts as a}} sacrificial material. This cladding material vanished partially endothermically by sublimation, fusion followed by evaporation, by endothermic reaction with the spraying atmosphere or acted as refractory material and did not much affect the original material. Thus, less heat was transferred from the flame onto original powders, and coatings produced following this process presented less degradation (conservation of the initial phases and structures) which was reflected by better mechanical properties.

40|$|International audienceThe {{kinetics}} of ferrite {{growth in}} the Fe-C-Co and Fe-C-Si systems has been quantified using controlled decarburization experiments. The Fe-C-Co system is a particularly interesting system since a large range of Co contents can be considered providing a suitable data set for examination of the composition dependence of the solute drag effect. Six Fe-C-Co alloys containing Co from 0. 5 to 20 pct have been considered. Three Fe-C-Si alloys have also been considered and each has been transformed at three temperatures proving a suitable data set for examining the temperature dependence of the solute drag effect. This data set, along with ferrite growth data <b>from</b> <b>decarburization</b> experiments on an Fe-C- 2 Cr alloy {{has been used to}} test the ferrite growth model proposed in the companion article by Zurob et al. It is shown that this model for ferrite growth, that includes diffusional dissipation due to interaction between the solute and the migrating boundary, quantitatively captures both the temperature and composition dependence of the deviation of experimental ferrite growth kinetics from the PE and/or LENP models...|$|R
