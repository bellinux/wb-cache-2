500|$|The {{first episode}} of the season, [...] "Nothing Important Happened Today", {{gathered}} 10.6 million viewers, whereas the second part gathered only 9.4 million viewers. On May 19, 2002, the series finale, [...] "The Truth", aired, and the Fox Broadcasting Company confirmed that The X-Files was not being renewed for a tenth season.

[...] "The Truth" [...] received the highest Nielsen household rating and viewership numbers of the season. It earned a 7.5 rating and gathered 13.25 million viewers in the United States. The loss of viewers resulted in this season seeing a 30 percent ratings drop when compared to the eighth season.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} series finale, [...] "The Truth", attracted 13.25 million viewers, the series' lowest rated season finale. The ninth {{season was}} the 63rd most-watched {{show for the}} 2001–02 season, tying its season two rank. On May 19, 2002, the finale aired and the Fox network confirmed that The X-Files was over.

[...] While news outlets cited declining ratings because of lackluster stories and poor writing, The X-Files production crew blamed September 11 terrorist attacks as the main factor. At the end of 2002, The X-Files had become the longest-running consecutive science fiction series ever on U.S. broadcast television. This record was later surpassed by Stargate SG-1 in 2007 and Smallville in 2011.|$|E

This is a LECP that uses SOAP {{to communicate with}} a SP, using a reverse HTTP binding. This is identified as PAOS-LECP. Thus one Enhanced Client Profile uses a client that <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> its IDP, but does not use SOAP {{to communicate with the}} SP. This has been submitted as the LECP solution proposal.

Since a reverse HTTP binding is used, the client {{does not need to be}} addressable.

2500|$|Reet Silvia Jurvetson had {{departed}} {{from her home}} country to visit a man named [...] "John" [...] or [...] "Jean" [...] in California {{in the late summer}} of 1969. Several weeks after she had arrived (and just two weeks prior to her murder), she wrote a postcard to her family which described her general satisfaction with her life in Los Angeles, and encouraging her parents to maintain contact with her via correspondence. Another postcard was also sent to her closest friend. These two postcards were the final contact her family and friends ever received from Reet. Her family did not report her missing, as they had known just how adventurous Reet had become in her later teenage years, and presumed she was simply [...] "making a new life for herself". The Jurvetsons had made tentative efforts to contact Reet throughout the years, although all had proven fruitless. Her sister, Anne, would recollect in 2016 that, in addition to the family's hope Reet would contact them as and when she felt the urge to do so: [...] "We did not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> someone {{on the other side of}} the continent." [...] Nonetheless, after several weeks had passed without contact from their daughter, her parents did send an individual to the return address upon the postcard, only for this individual to be informed Reet had vacated the apartment several weeks previously. Shortly thereafter, the family hired a private investigator, although this individual was unable to garner any fruitful leads. Despite these setbacks, Reet's sister emphasized the fact that, prior to her being shown the online photographs of her deceased sister, she and her family had never given serious thought to Reet being the victim of a homicide.|$|E
