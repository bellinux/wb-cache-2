5|$|Before long, Bohemond granted Jabala (which {{was still}} to be conquered) to the Templars {{although}} Raymond-Roupen had promised the town to the Hospitallers. The papal legate, Cardinal Pelagius, brokered an agreement between the military orders, dividing the town between them. However, Bohemond remained <b>hostile</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Hospitallers. After he confiscated their property in Antioch, Pelagius excommunicated him.|$|E
5|$|Many educated Sudanese were {{suspicious}} of the Council and drifted towards the Khatmiyya side in the 1944 elections, not for religious reasons but because they were <b>hostile</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> government, wanted to retain links with Egypt as a counterpoise to British influence {{and did not want}} a monarchy under Sayyid Abd al-Rahman.|$|E
5|$|The goal of {{his policy}} was to {{withdraw}} all the U.S. forces from Europe. The settlement reached {{would give the}} Kremlin sufficient reassurance against the establishment of regimes in Eastern Europe <b>hostile</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union, tempering the degree of control over that area that the Soviet leaders {{felt it necessary to}} exercise.|$|E
25|$|In 1964, Northern Rhodesia becomes {{independent}} as Zambia, {{under the}} leadership of Kenneth Kaunda. From then on, Angola becomes almost surrounded by countries with regimes <b>hostile</b> <b>to</b> Portugal, <b>the</b> exception being South West Africa.|$|R

50|$|The only {{detailed}} account {{of the life of}} Peregrinus was recorded by Lucian in his satire, The Death of Peregrinus (De Morte Peregrini). Although this account is <b>hostile</b> <b>to</b> Peregrinus, <b>the</b> bare facts of his life can be extracted.|$|R
5|$|Chrétien's {{position}} {{was far more}} difficult than Johnson's: Part of the 1993 Liberal election platform had been moving the country away from large scale constitutional debates. Provincial governments were also far more <b>hostile</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> constitutional process {{than they had been}} in the decade prior, with even the federal government's typical ally, Ontario, being firmly against any pursuit of constitutional accommodation.|$|E
5|$|In 1529 {{the king}} summoned Parliament {{to deal with}} annulment, thus {{bringing}} together those who wanted reform but who disagreed what form it should take; it {{became known as the}} Reformation Parliament. There were Common lawyers who resented the privileges of the clergy to summon laity to their courts; there were those who had been influenced by Lutheran evangelicalism and were <b>hostile</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> theology of Rome; Thomas Cromwell was both. Henry's Chancellor, Thomas More, successor to Wolsey, also wanted reform: he wanted new laws against heresy.|$|E
5|$|On 26 November 1940, the Iron Guard began {{a bloody}} {{retaliation}} against various political figures {{who had served}} under Carol (following a late investigation into the 1938 killing of Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, the movement's founder and early leader, by Carol's authorities). Tătărescu and Constantin Argetoianu were among the second wave of captured politicians (on 27 November), and were destined for arbitrary execution; they were, however, saved by the intervention of regular police forces, most of whom had grown <b>hostile</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Guardist militias.|$|E

50|$|Initial {{audience}} reaction <b>to</b> <b>the</b> band's {{music was}} not encouraging. During their first few shows, {{they met with}} jeering and <b>hostile</b> objection <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rock style and techniques they employed.|$|R
5|$|On March 27 {{the eight}} soldiers, Captain Preston, and four civilians {{who were in}} the Customs House and were alleged to have fired shots, were all indicted for murder. Bostonians {{continued}} to be <b>hostile</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> troops and their dependents. General Gage, convinced the troops were doing more harm than good, ordered the 29th Regiment out of the province in May. Governor Hutchinson took advantage of the ongoing high tensions to orchestrate delays of the trials until later in the year.|$|E
5|$|Saladin, who overthrew the Fatimids in 1171, was <b>hostile</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Shi’ite {{principles}} of learning propounded at al-Azhar during the Fatimid Caliphate, and under his Ayyubid dynasty the mosque suffered from neglect. Congregational prayers were banned by Sadr al-Din ibn Dirbass, appointed qadi by Saladin. The {{reason for this}} edict may have been Shāfi‘ī teachings that proscribe congregational prayers in a community to only one mosque, or mistrust of the former Shi'a institution by the new Sunni ruler. By this time, the much larger al-Hakim Mosque was completed; congregational prayers in Cairo were held there.|$|E
5|$|There was no {{international}} media presence in Vukovar, {{as there was}} in the simultaneous Siege of Dubrovnik and the later Siege of Sarajevo, and relatively little of the fighting in Vukovar was broadcast to foreign audiences. British journalist Misha Glenny commented that the JNA, the Croatian Serb government and many ordinary Serbs were often <b>hostile</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> foreign media, while the Croatians presented a much more open and friendly attitude.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hostile</b> <b>to</b> Fascism from <b>the</b> {{start of}} Benito Mussolini's government, he became President of the Italian Senate on July 20, 1944, after the Fascist regime collapsed.|$|R
50|$|Shavit rockets are {{launched}} from Palmachim Airbase by the Israel Space Agency into highly retrograde orbits over <b>the</b> Mediterranean Sea <b>to</b> prevent debris coming down in populated areas {{and also to}} avoid flying over nations <b>hostile</b> <b>to</b> Israel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east; {{this results in a}} lower payload-to-orbit than east-directed launches would allow. The launcher consists of three stages powered by solid-fuel rocket motors, with an optional liquid-fuel fourth stage, and is manufactured by IAI.|$|R
50|$|Kahlenberg and Marvit {{also argue}} that at least in efforts to pass a right-to-work law in Michigan, the {{exclusion}} of police and firefighter unions—traditionally less <b>hostile</b> <b>to</b> Republicans—from <b>the</b> law, caused some to question claims that the law was simply an effort to improve Michigan's businesses climate, not to seek partisan advantage.|$|R
5|$|Will {{therefore}} {{schemes to}} push his daughter and Ben together, {{to try to bring}} fresh, virile blood into the family. However, she is openly <b>hostile</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> crude, if magnetic, upstart. Will is determined to have his bloodline go on, so he offers to make Ben wealthy if he marries Clara. Meanwhile, Minnie Littlejohn (Angela Lansbury), Will's long-time mistress, is dissatisfied with their arrangement and wants to marry him.|$|E
5|$|Alice again laid {{claim to}} the regency. However, most Antiochene lords {{remained}} <b>hostile</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> idea of a female ruler and sent envoys to BaldwinII's successor, Fulk of Anjou, who was Alice's brother-in-law. Alice made an alliance with Joscelin II, Count of Edessa, and Pons, Count of Tripoli, in early 1132. Fulk had to travel to Antioch by sea, because Pons did not allow him to march through the County of Tripoli. Fulk landed at St. Symeon where the Antiochene barons acknowledged him as regent. He appointed Reynald I Mazoir, Constable of Antioch, to administer the principality.|$|E
5|$|Asad was {{a member}} of the Qasr clan, a {{subtribe}} of the Banu Bajila. His great-grandfather, Asad ibn Kurz al-Qasri, is said by some traditions to have been the chief of the Bajila in the times of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, and is counted as one of Muhammad's companions. Other traditions, <b>hostile</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> family, report that Asad was a Jew and a runaway slave. Asad's grandfather Yazid was an early and prominent supporter of the Umayyads in the First Fitna, while Asad's father Abdallah sided with Ibn al-Zubayr in the Second Fitna, but was eventually pardoned by the Caliph Abd al-Malik (reigned 685–705).|$|E
50|$|Additionally, the new flag's {{predominantly}} blue-on-white appearance immediately antagonised many in Iraq {{because of}} its alleged resemblance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> flag of the State of Israel, considered <b>hostile</b> <b>to</b> Iraq since <b>the</b> former's establishment in 1948.|$|R

25|$|Some {{knowledge}} of physiology and {{the physics of}} diving is considered necessary by most diver certification agencies, as the diving environment is alien and relatively <b>hostile</b> <b>to</b> humans. <b>The</b> physics and physiology knowledge required is fairly basic, and helps <b>the</b> diver <b>to</b> understand <b>the</b> effects of the diving environment so that informed acceptance of the associated risks is possible.|$|R
5|$|Bache's {{strategy}} for presenting these works {{was one of}} familiarity. He performed two-piano arrangements of Liszt's orchestral works prior to the debuts of the original versions, and performed some of Liszt's symphonic poems shortly after they had been premiered at the Crystal Palace. He also provided informative, scholarly program notes, written by leading musical analysts and intimates in the Liszt circle. The English musical press, while generally <b>hostile</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> music he presented, noted and appreciated Bache's efforts. Liszt remained grateful; without Bache, he acknowledged, his music might not have gained the foothold that it did.|$|E
5|$|By summer 1537, Montejo {{believed}} that Higueras {{had been almost}} completely pacified, with very few casualties amongst either the Spanish or the natives. Gracias a Dios and San Pedro were more secure, and many Indians had returned to their villages, encouraged by Montejo's moderate policies. In reality, only the areas around the Spanish settlements had been thoroughly conquered, and in the remoter areas {{the vast majority of}} the natives were still <b>hostile</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Spanish, and determined to resist. In contrast to other provinces, the Spanish were unable to recruit reliable native auxiliaries to assist their conquest.|$|E
5|$|Evidence of {{the effect}} of the Reformation was seen in early 1524. Candlemas was not celebrated, processions of robed clergy ceased, worshippers did not go with palms or relics on Palm Sunday to the Lindenhof, and triptychs {{remained}} covered and closed after Lent. Opposition to the changes came from Konrad Hofmann and his followers, but the council decided in favour of keeping the government mandates. When Hofmann left the city, opposition from pastors <b>hostile</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Reformation broke down. The bishop of Constance tried to intervene in defending the mass and the veneration of images. Zwingli wrote an official response for the council and the result was the severance of all ties between the city and the diocese.|$|E
50|$|Originally an evangelical, Dale came {{to believe}} that {{ritualism}} was specifically appropriate <b>to</b> deal with <b>the</b> nature of secularism and forces <b>hostile</b> <b>to</b> Christianity of <b>the</b> time. He began to use eucharistic vestments at Christmas 1873.|$|R
50|$|In the stories, Sugawara Akitada {{entered the}} civil service as a junior clerk in the Ministry of Law, with an income barely able to support his family: his mother who was shown as always being inexplicably <b>hostile</b> <b>to</b> him (<b>the</b> reason not {{revealed}} until the novel Hell Screen), two younger sisters and a small staff of family retainers.|$|R
50|$|Cumbernauld's history {{stretches}} to Roman times, with {{a settlement}} near the Antonine Wall, the furthest and most northerly {{boundary of the}} Roman Empire. The security that the wall gave from possibly <b>hostile</b> tribes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north probably allowed {{the foundation of a}} settlement.|$|R
