This has led to an ever growing exposure of human beings to this substance. The first purpose of the Nano Committee of Food and Drug Administration of The Islamic Republic of Iran (IFDA) is developing guidelines to assess and approve commercial nano-health products for their safety of human applications. Nanobiocide® as a commercial product of stable colloid including 2000 ppm Ag-NPs for surface antimicrobial applications was investigated according to IFDA guidelines in the approval process. Methods: The first fabrication and characterization method of the product were determined. The human exposure to Nanobiocide® were studied by cytotoxicity assay, <b>dermal</b> <b>irritation</b> and inhalation toxicity assay based on the standard assay. Results: According to cytotoxicity assay by MTT method the concentration-dependent of cell viability was reduced and Inhibitory concentration- 50 was about 1160 ppm. The Draize <b>dermal</b> <b>irritation</b> <b>scoring</b> system (DDIS) showed no irritation to the skin of rabbits. No sign of gross toxicity, adverse pharmacological effect, or abnormal behavior based on inhalation toxicity was observed.

40|$|Oncostatin M (OM) is {{a member}} of the interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) {{cytokine}} subfamily. The binding of OM to its receptor initiates signal transduction through JAK-signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) pathways and activates transcription activators through mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. Results of in vitro assays documented that OM modulates cytokine expression and alters the production of proteases that down-regulate inflammation. Administration of OM to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -challenged mice lowered serum tumor necrosis factor-&alpha; (TNF-&alpha;) levels and decreased the lethal effects of LPS administration. OM also reduced inflammation in animal models of human disease, including inflammatory bowel disease, antibody-induced arthritis, and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.

40|$|Abstract Background Post-herpetic {{neuralgia}} (PHN) is {{a common}} type of neuropathic pain that can severely affect quality of life. NGX- 4010, a capsaicin 8 % dermal patch, is a localized treatment that can provide patients with significant pain relief for up to 3 months following a single 60 -minute application. The NGX- 4010 application {{can be associated with}} application-site pain and in previous clinical trials pretreatment with a topical 4 % lidocaine anesthetic was used to enhance tolerability. The aim of the current investigation was to evaluate tolerability of NGX- 4010 after pretreatment with lidocaine 2. 5 %/prilocaine 2. 5 % anesthetic cream. Methods Twenty-four patients with PHN were pretreated with lidocaine 2. 5 %/prilocaine 2. 5 % cream for 60 minutes before receiving a single 60 -minute application of NGX- 4010. Tolerability was assessed by measuring patch application duration, the proportion of patients completing over 90 % of the intended treatment duration, application site-related pain using the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), and analgesic medication use to relieve such pain. Safety was assessed by monitoring adverse events (AEs) and <b>dermal</b> <b>irritation</b> using <b>dermal</b> assessment <b>scores.</b> Results The mean treatment duration of NGX- 4010 was 60. 2 minutes and all patients completed over 90 % of the intended patch application duration. Pain during application was transient. A maximum mean change in NPRS score of + 3. 0 was observed at 55 minutes post-patch application; pain scores gradually declined to near pre-anesthetic levels (+ 0. 71) within 85 minutes of patch removal. Half of the patients received analgesic medication on the day of treatment; by Day 7, no patients required medication. The most common AEs were application site-related pain, erythema, edema, and pruritus. All patients experienced mild <b>dermal</b> <b>irritation</b> 5 minutes after patch removal, which subsequently decreased; at Day 7, no irritation was evident. The maximum recorded dermal assessment score was 2. Conclusion NGX- 4010 was well tolerated following pretreatment with lidocaine 2. 5 %/prilocaine 2. 5 % cream in patients with PHN. The tolerability of the patch application appeared comparable with that seen in other studies that used 4 % lidocaine cream as the pretreatment anesthetic.

NE with nifedipine was development and characterized, presenting droplet size of 20 nm with low polydispersity index (IP< 0. 1), spherical shape without aggregation, pH compatible with typical skin levels and stability evaluated by seven months. In the permeation studies, a classical formulation based in an oil/water cream containing nifedipine was used for comparison with NE. Nanoemulsion promoted and improved the retention of nifedipine in the epidermis and dermis in relation to classical formulation. This promoting effect {{is related to the}} nanometric size of the droplets of the NE (20 nm), which give him a large superficial area, favoring the contact of the nanocarrier with the skin surface.

DGBE was administered dermally at 10 or 30 % v/v in aqueous solutions or undiluted (100 %) for 13 weeks under occlusion, 6 hdday, 5 daydweek at a maximum attainable volume of 2 mLkg. Satellite groups {{of male and}} female rats were treated with the top dose of DGBE for 13 weeks, mated, and the females were treated through day 20 of gestation and allowed to deliver and nurse their offspring through day 21 of lactation (weaning). DGBE produced <b>dermal</b> <b>irritation,</b> which was dependent on concentration in incidence, severity, and time of onset and was more severe in females than in males. No corresponding histopathology was evident. The only suggestion of a systemic effect was a slightly increased incidence of urinary occult blood at study termination in the females receiving the 30 % or 100 % DGBE dose. There was no evidence of histopathologic changes in the testes, and vaginal cytology indicated no adverse effect on estrous cycling. There were no effects on reproductive performance of the DGBE-treated males and females. Litters delivered by treated females contained the same number of live pups as control litters and th...|$|R
40|$|Since the September 11 {{terrorist}} attacks on the World Trade Center, there has been concern about the impact of environmental contaminants generated by the fires and building collapses on the health of workers at and near the site as well as of residents of the surrounding communities and workers returning to work at or near the site. Potential environmental exposures related to the WTC disaster exposures include: cement and glass dust, asbestos, fiberglass, PM 2. 5 and PM 10 (small particulate matter), larger particulate matter, lead and other heavy metals, PCBs, dibenzoflurans, volatile organic compounds and other products of combustion. While concern has been primarily about inhalational exposures, {{there have been a number}} of reports of <b>dermal</b> <b>irritation</b> and rashes on exposed areas of the skin. In addition, those escaping the area on September 11 th and those working without appropriate respiratory early after the disaster, experienced ingestional exposures. Primary short-term health effects of exposure to airborne contaminants may include asthma/reactive airways disease (RADS), chemical irritation of the eyes, nasal passages, throat, and upper airways, sinusitis, and persistent cough, and pneumonitis. Additionally, ingestional exposures may result in digestive symptoms such as irritation of the upper gastrointestinal tract with gastro-esophageal reflux (GERD) ...|$|R
40|$|Ethosome {{formulations}} containing phenylethyl resorcinol (PR) were developed. The formulation {{was produced}} from 0. 5 % w/v PR, 0. 5 % w/v cholesterol from lanolin, 3 % w/v L-α-phosphatidylcholine from soybean, 30 % v/v absolute ethanol, and {{water up to}} 100 % v/v. It was characterized by a vesicular size of 389 [*]nm, low polydispersity index of 0. 266, zeta potential of − 34. 19 ± 0. 44 [*]mV, high PR entrapment efficiency of 71 %, and good stability on storage at 4 and 30 °C at 75 % RH for 4 months. In vitro studies using pig skin revealed that permeation coefficient of PR from ethosomes {{was significantly higher than}} that from liposomes. In vitro retention profiles showed that PR accumulation in pig skin following application of ethosome formulations was 7. 4 -, 3. 3 -, and 1. 8 -fold higher than that achieved using liposomes, 20 % propylene glycol solution, and 30 % hydroethanolic solution, respectively. An inhibition value of around 80 % was measured for antityrosinase activity of PR in pig skin. Consistently, ethosomes exhibited higher tyrosinase inhibition activity and melanin content reduction when compared to other formulations in B 16 melanoma cells. Ethosomes did not cause acute <b>dermal</b> <b>irritation</b> in albino rabbits. These findings demonstrate that ethosomes are capable of delivering PR into the skin efficiently and hold promise for topical application of skin lightening products...|$|R
40|$|Cytotoxicity of 5 phenol {{derivatives}} (phenol, catechol, resorcinol, hydroquinone and phloroglucinol) {{was tested}} using a mouse 3 T 3 fibroblast cell line. Its relationships with structural and physicochemical properties were investigated. Linear regression analysis and Pearson’s correlation coefficient were used to characterise the relationship between cytotoxicity (expressed by IC 50 values) and physicochemical parameters of compounds or their toxicity in vivo expressed by LD 50 values. The studies showed that physicochemical properties of compounds seemed to have less influence on their cytotoxic potency than structural properties. Cytotoxicity of the compounds probably depends {{on the number of}} –OH groups and their location in the aromatic ring more than on physicochemical properties of compounds. The best correlation was obtained for IC 50 values and LD 50 values determined following rabbit skin administration and experimental skin <b>irritation</b> <b>score.</b> phenol catechol resorcinol hydroquinone phloroglucinol cytotoxicity 1...|$|R
40|$|NIOSH {{recommends}} that employee exposure to thiols {{in the workplace}} be controlled by adherence to the following sections. The recommended standard is {{designed to protect the}} health and provide for the safety of employees for up to a 10 -hour workshift, in a 40 -hour workweek, during a working lifetime. Compliance with all sections of their recommended standard should prevent adverse effects of exposure to thiols on the health of employees and provide for their safety. Techniques recommended in the standard are valid, reproducible, and available to industry and government agencies. Sufficient technology exists to permit compliance with the recommended standard. Although NIOSH considers the recommended workplace environmental limits to be safe levels based on current information, employers should regard them as the upper boundaries of exposure and make every effort to maintain exposures as low as is technically feasible. The criteria and recommended standard will be reviewed and revised as necessary. Because of systemic effects, absorption through the skin on contact, and possible <b>dermal</b> <b>irritation,</b> "occupational exposure to thiols" is defined as work in any area where thiols are produced, processed stored, or otherwise used. If thiols are handled or stored in intact, sealed containers, e. g., during shipment, NIOSH {{recommends that}} only Sections 3, 5 (a), and 6 (g) of this proposed standard apply. If exposure to other chemicals also occurs, provisions of any standard applicable to the other chemicals shall be followed. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 CurrentPrevention and ControlEnvironmental Healt...|$|R
