5|$|In 1801, the {{astronomer}} Giuseppe Piazzi discovered an object which he initially {{believed to be}} a comet. Shortly thereafter he announced his observations of this object, noting that the slow, uniform motion was uncharacteristic of a comet, suggesting <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> type of object. This was lost from sight for several months, but was recovered later that year by the Baron von Zach and Heinrich W. M. Olbers after a preliminary orbit was computed by Carl Friedrich Gauss. This object came to be named Ceres, and was the first asteroid to be discovered.|$|E
5|$|Hammond {{spent much}} of the 1934 season troubled by sore throats and back {{problems}} which restricted his appearances for Gloucestershire. His form for his county was good and in all first-class matches, he scored 2,366 runs (average 76.32), although he took fewer wickets at a higher average than the previous season. Awarded a benefit match, which raised just over £2,600, Hammond was idolised by the press and public for his achievements. In Tests, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> story; according to Wisden, he failed badly. England lost the Ashes, 2–1, in a series overshadowed at times by the Bodyline controversy. Hammond played in all five Tests against Australia but his top score was 43; he scored 162 runs at an average of 20.25, and took five wickets at an average of 72.80. Although the press and selectors supported him, there were some suggestions he should be left out of the side, and Hammond felt under great pressure.|$|E

5|$|The Madagascan sunset moth {{was first}} {{described}} by the British entomologist Dru Drury in 1773 from a specimen obtained from a Captain May of Hammersmith. Because of its resemblance to swallowtail butterflies, Drury described the species as Papilio rhipheus. The specimen Drury received had {{the head of a}} different species attached, probably that of a butterfly, which had clubbed antennae—this trait is frequently used to differentiate moths from butterflies. Once the inaccuracy in Drury's specimen was found, the moth was placed in the genus Urania, until 1823 when the German entomologist Jacob Hübner placed it in a new genus, Chrysiridia. The moth has also been described under other names. Because Drury described his specimen as having clubbed antennae and being tailless, William Swainson thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> species than the complete specimen described by Cramer. In 1833, Swainson named the butterfly Rhipheus dasycephalus and the moth Leilus orientalis. Other synonyms include U. crameri by Maassen in 1879 and U. ripheus var. madagascariensis by Lesson in 1831.|$|E
5|$|With the {{discovery}} of Pluto in 1930, most astronomers considered the Solar System to have nine planets, along with thousands of significantly smaller bodies (asteroids and comets). For almost 50years Pluto {{was thought to be}} larger than Mercury, but with {{the discovery}} in 1978 of Pluto's moon Charon, it became possible to measure Pluto's mass accurately and to determine that it was much smaller than initial estimates. It was roughly one-twentieth the mass of Mercury, which made Pluto by far the smallest planet. Although it was still more than ten times as massive as the largest object in the asteroid belt, Ceres, it had one-fifth the mass of Earth's Moon. Furthermore, having some unusual characteristics, such as large orbital eccentricity and a high orbital inclination, it became evident that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> kind of body from any of the other planets.|$|E

25|$|Watson won {{the special}} {{election}} with 59.1 {{percent of the}} vote to become the first Republican to represent South Carolina in the House since 1896, and the first Republican to win an undisputed House election in the state since Reconstruction. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> Republican Party in the South, however, as in 1965 most blacks in South Carolina were still effectively disenfranchised. Watson was comfortably reelected in 1966 and 1968. Watson's opposition to civil rights legislation exceeded that of most other Southern Republicans. For instance, he was the only House Republican to vote against the Jury Selection Act of 1968, a civil rights measure intended to eliminate racial discrimination in jury selection.|$|E
25|$|Although {{they did}} not make much of an {{impression}} in the inaugural East African Premier League, dominated by the two Ugandan sides, they did dominate in the opening rounds. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> story in the 50-over counterpart, the East African Cup, though. They totally dominated the tournament, and except the occasional Ugandan good performance, nearly every franchise appeared minnows in front of them. They topped the group with 28 points from 10 games (6 wins and only two losses), and then won comprehensively in the twice-postponed final against Ugandan side Nile Knights (the other being Rwenzori Warriors) by 84 runs. After they posted a massive 280/5 (Rakep Patel 92, Duncan Allan 65), Pakistani-born Kenyan cricketer Abdul Rehman took 4-32 as their opponents could only manage 196/9.|$|E
25|$|Bretscher and Feather argued, on {{theoretical}} grounds, {{that this}} element might {{be capable of}} fission by both fast and slow neutrons like uranium-235. If so, this promised another path to an atomic bomb, {{as it could be}} bred from the more abundant uranium-238 in a nuclear reactor, and separation from uranium could be by chemical means, as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> element, thereby avoiding the necessity for isotope separation. Kemmer suggested that since uranium was named after the planet Uranus, element 93 could be named neptunium and 94 plutonium after the next two planets. Later it was discovered that the Americans had independently adopted the same names, following the same logic. Bretscher and Feather went further, theorising that irradiation of thorium could produce a new isotope of uranium, uranium-233, which might also be susceptible to fission by both fast and slow neutrons.|$|E

25|$|The Razorbacks {{began the}} 2010 {{campaign}} on February 19 with a 10–2 {{victory over the}} Ball State Cardinals. Hogs starter Mike Bolsinger earned the win, and Andy Wilkins provided two hits, 2 RBI, and a solo home run. Every Razorback starting player recorded at least a base hit in the contest. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> story in game two, however, as Ball State took a lead {{in the first inning}} and did not relinquish it. Geoffrey Davenport would continue after the shaky start to pitch effectively for four innings, including striking out the side in the fourth. The Razorbacks left twelve runners on base, and committed four defensive errors. Game three was initially delayed fifteen minutes due to rain, but once the game started, Brett Eibner and Drew Smyly pitched well. Designated hitter Monk Kreder, a junior college transfer native to Keller, Texas, collected three hits. Six different Razorbacks scored in the 9–3 victory.|$|E
25|$|FCB {{were drawn}} into Group C {{alongside}} Barcelona, Shakhtar Donetsk and Sporting CP. Basel lost their opening game 2–1 at St. Jakob-Park on 16 September against Shakhtar. Fernandinho put the Ukrainians ahead on 25 minutes before Jádson doubled their lead just before half time. David Abraham scored a late consolation {{goal for the}} home team. Sporting CP were the opponents on Matchday 2 (1 October) and despite defending well and causing a few scares {{at the other end}} of the park, Basel were defeated 2–0 at the Estádio José Alvalade. On Matchday 3 (22 October), Barcelona visited Basel and came away with a 5–0 win, but a fortnight later <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> story as FCB came away with a respectable 1–1 draw at the Camp Nou, with Eren Derdiyok scoring a late equaliser after Lionel Messi put Barça ahead. On 26 November, Basel travelled to Ukraine to play Shakhtar, where they were thrashed 5–0. Basel then faced Sporting at home on the final Matchday (9 December) and were defeated 1–0.|$|E
25|$|Bass player John Arliss {{initially}} took Andes' place. California {{was still}} in the line-up, but he had suffered a head injury from a horse riding accident and was unable to tour. Bass player Al Staehely was recruited by Locke and Cassidy, and they toured briefly before deciding that they had to add a guitar player to do the music justice. Al's brother, John Christian (Chris) Staehely, auditioned for the band and was quickly brought on board, departing the Texas rock group Krackerjack. The Staehelys, Cassidy and Locke recorded the 1972 album Feedback in Columbia/Epic's Hollywood studios. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> turn for the group, showing more of a country rock influence pervading their jazzier tendencies, but it only met with a mild commercial response, also reaching No.63 in the charts. The tour for Feedback proceeded very well for much of that year, but with musical roots that went different directions, eventually both Cassidy and Locke left the lineup. The Staehely brothers recruited Stu Perry to play drums. While the tour was well received critically, Spirit disbanded in mid-1973. The brothers would release their own album, Sta-Hay-Lee, in 1973.|$|E

25|$|Between 1900–1906 Studd was {{pastor of}} a church at Ootacamund in Southern India and {{although}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> situation to the pioneer missionary work he had undertaken in China, his ministry was marked by numerous conversions amongst the British officials and the local community. However, on his return home Studd met a German missionary named Karl Kumm, and he became concerned about the large parts of Africa {{that had never been}} reached with the Gospel. In 1910 he went to the Sudan and was concerned by the lack of Christian faith in central Africa. Out of this concern Studd was led to set up the Heart of Africa Mission. His speaking on the subject inspired Howard Mowll (Bishop of China, and later Archbishop of Sydney), Arthur Pitts-Pitts (of the Church Missionary Society in Kenya), and Graham Brown (Anglican Bishop of Jerusalem). As an HQ for the venture, the Studds chose 17 Highland Road in Upper Norwood, South London. Like Hudson-Taylor, Studd believed that funds for the work should not be directly solicited. Finances were often tenuous. However, he enjoyed the support of Lord Radstock.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} years of Prohibition, the new law was {{enforced}} in regions such as the rural South and western states, where it had popular support; however, in large urban cities and small industrial or mining towns, residents defied or ignored the law. The Ku Klux Klan was a major supporter of Prohibition; once it was passed they helped with its enforcement. For example, in 1923, Klansmen traded pistol shots with bootleggers, burned down roadhouses, and whipped liquor sellers, and anybody else who broke the moral code. The Prohibition was effective in reducing per-capita consumption, and consumption remained lower for a quarter-century after Prohibition had been repealed. Sale of alcoholic beverages remained illegal during Prohibition, but alcoholic drinks were still available. Large quantities of alcohol were smuggled into the United States from Canada, over land, by sea routes along both ocean coasts, and through the Great Lakes, and alcohol was diverted from the limited exceptions to the Volsted Act: medicinal and religious. While the federal government cracked down on alcohol consumption on land within the United States, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> story along the U.S. coastlines, where vessels outside the 3-mile limit were exempt. In addition, home brewing was popular during Prohibition. Malt and hops stores popped up across the country and some former breweries turned to selling malt extract syrup, ostensibly for baking and beverage purposes.|$|E
