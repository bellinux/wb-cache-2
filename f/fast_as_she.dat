However, this proved to be the last time she ran that <b>fast,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> suffered a severe injury to her left foot during training, breaking the bone and having surgery as a result. She attempted a return, but additional complications forced her to retire from athletics.|$|E
25|$|In all, Binchy {{published}} 16 novels, four short-story collections, a {{play and}} a novella. A 17th novel, A Week in Winter, was published posthumously. Her literary career began with two books of short stories: Central Line (1978) and Victoria Line (1980). She published her debut novel Light a Penny Candle in 1982. In 1983, {{it sold for}} the largest sum ever paid for a first novel: £52,000. The timing was fortuitous, as Binchy {{and her husband were}} two months behind with the mortgage at the time. However, the prolific Binchy – who joked that she could write as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> could talk – ultimately became one of Ireland's richest women.|$|E
2500|$|Guachapins {{greatest}} {{moment of}} glory came {{later that year}} on 18 August 1801. On that day [...] was between Martinique and St. Lucia [...] {{when she saw the}} Guachapin in an unequal fight against a Spanish letter of marque armed with 18 brass guns - 32 and 12-pounders. Heureux sailed up as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> could but even before she arrived the Spaniard had struck to Guachapin. The two-hour engagement had cost Guachapin three men killed and three wounded, and the Spaniard nearly the same. The Spaniard was the Theresa, under the command of an officer of the Spanish Navy, and had a crew of 120 men.|$|E
60|$|The girl's pulses throbbed {{a little}} <b>faster</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> spoke, {{and there was}} nothing in the man's face which escaped her attention. Again the curious glint became {{apparent}} in his eyes, and the warm bronze a little deeper in tint.|$|R

50|$|In the New Warriors series {{where they}} star on a reality {{television}} show Debrii is actually considered {{a low level}} electromagnetic telekenetic. Although {{she is able to}} move massive amounts of debris she cannot lift anything really heavy with her powers. She can also levitate herself a little (probably not <b>faster</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> can comfortably walk), but cannot really fly.|$|R
2500|$|While the Vizcaya {{was under}} fire, the Cristóbal Colón had drawn ahead. Within {{a little more}} than an hour, five of the six ships of the Spanish Caribbean Squadron had been {{destroyed}} or forced aground. Only one vessel, the speedy new armored cruiser Cristóbal Colón, still survived, steaming as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> could for the west and freedom. Though modern in every respect and possibly the fastest ship in either fleet, Cristóbal Colón had one serious problem: She had been only recently purchased from Italy, and her main [...] armament was not yet installed because of a contractual issue with the British firm of Armstrong. She therefore sailed with empty main turrets, albeit retaining her ten [...] secondary battery. This day, speed was her primary defense.|$|E
2500|$|At a Cabinet {{meeting on}} 3 May 1939, the First Lord of Admiralty, Lord Stanhope, stated that [...] "at {{the present time}} Germany was {{building}} ships as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> could but {{that she would not}} be able to exceed the 35 per cent ratio before 1942 or 1943". Chatfield, now Minister for the Co-ordination of Defence, commented that Hitler had [...] "persuaded himself" [...] that Britain had provided the Reich with a [...] "free hand" [...] in Eastern Europe in exchange for the agreement. Chamberlain stated that Britain had never given such an understanding to Germany, and he commented that he first learned of Hitler's belief in such an implied bargain during his meeting with the Führer at the Berchtesgaden summit in September 1938. In a later paper to the Cabinet, Chatfield stated [...] "that we might say that we now understood Herr Hitler had in 1935 thought that we had given him a free hand in Eastern and Central Europe in return for his acceptance of the 100:35 ratio, but that as we could not accept the correctness of this view it might be better that the 1935 arrangements should be abrogated".|$|E

60|$|But now, Mr. Pilgrim, having {{felt the}} pulse, was putting some brandy in a tea-spoon between Dempster's lips; the brandy went down, and his {{breathing}} became freer. Janet noticed the change, {{and her heart}} beat <b>faster</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> leaned forward to watch him. Suddenly a slight movement, like the passing away of a shadow, was visible in his face, and {{he opened his eyes}} full on Janet. It was almost like meeting him again on the resurrection morning, after the night of the grave.|$|R
50|$|In 1999, Commodore Clipper (IMO9201750) was {{delivered}} to Commodore Ferries and replaced a freight ferry Island Commodore. The new Commodore Clipper was able to replace Havelet as all-weather back-up for the <b>fast</b> craft <b>as</b> <b>she</b> had space for 500 passengers.|$|R

60|$|Madeline {{replied that}} she already felt it. The wind {{appeared}} {{to penetrate the}} robes. It was cold, pure, nipping. It was so thin she had to breathe <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> if <b>she</b> were under ordinary exertion. It hurt her nose and made her lungs ache.|$|R
2500|$|...

5|$|Like most {{characters}} in the Sonic series, Amy can run at superhuman speeds but not <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> Sonic. <b>She</b> attacks foes with her ever-present signature weapon, the Piko-Piko Hammer, with which she is very proficient.

60|$|She sat in {{her room}} upstairs after the {{visitors}} had gone, thinking it over. The light was fading <b>fast,</b> and <b>as</b> <b>she</b> sat at the open window the remembrance of Mr. Tredgold’s conduct helped to mar {{one of the most}} perfect evenings she had ever known.|$|R

60|$|There was a {{rustle of}} draperies, and Bonita Castro {{swept into the}} room with the grace of {{movement}} and carriage which characterizes her mother's race. There was, however, nothing spiritual about Miss Castro's beauty, which was of the flesh and of the glowing south, appealing to the senses, delighting the eye; and Dane's pulse throbbed a little <b>faster</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> came toward him with a low cry of pleasure. It {{was the first time he}} had risen from his trestle cot in the adjoining room. Stooping, she held toward him a great cluster of the spotless African lilies--which, scented ambrosially, spring up wherever decay is rankest--then sank with lithe gracefulness into a chair near his side.|$|R
50|$|Xing Ling's skills focus {{mainly on}} speed and agility. In The Celestial Zone II, {{she was found}} to be <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> lightning. <b>She</b> often uses her leg to steer her attacks.
