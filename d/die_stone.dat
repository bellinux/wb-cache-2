50|$|Single-Pour - The single-pour system {{eliminates}} the need for a stone base. When the impression is poured up, it is directly mounted on a plastic base or tray that already has a built-in condyle to form a complete articulator when the two halves are joined. By eliminating the need to pour up a stone base, the single-pour is a much faster system than the Stone Base system. There are varieties of single-pour systems that use dowel pins, and there are some that omit the need for dowel pins by creating the model completely out of <b>die</b> <b>stone.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{main goal}} of this pilot study was to {{determine}} if a correlation was present between interproximal wear rate and facial form and/or interproximal wear surface area and facial form. Additionally, interproximal wear was evaluated with regards to salivary pH. VPS impressions of interproximal tooth surfaces were captured in 29 adolescent volunteers after orthodontic separation and prior to band placement. A positive replica was created using a type IV <b>die</b> <b>stone.</b> The subsequent die stones were scanned, analyzed and interproximal wear surface area measurments were calculated. Correlation tests revealed that there was no clear or consistent relationship between interproximal wear and facial form and interproximal wear and salivary pH.

MATERIALS AND METHOD: Three representative brands of commonly used elastomeric impression materials along with four types of disinfecting agents were used in this study. Contact angle measurements after disinfection of elastomeric impressions were recorded {{as a measure of}} wettability, at three time periods (15, 30 and 120 minutes), using the photographic method. RESULTS: Immersion disinfection of these materials rendered a general significant decrease in the contact angle values (P< 0. 01) {{as a function of the}} disinfection time and the disinfecting agent type. The 30 -minute time period of disinfection yielded the greatest decrease in contact angles data indicating the best wettability. Polyether impression material showed significantly (P< 0. 01) the least contact angle data when immersed in chlorine dioxide disinfecting solution. CONCLUSION: Immersion disinfection of elastomeric impressions decreased the contact angle values and hence, an increase in their wettability occured. The contact angle values varied as a function of disinfection time and disinfecting agent type. King Saud Universit...|$|E
40|$|Statement of Problem: Tetrahydrozoline {{has been}} {{introduced}} as new gingival retraction agent but its clinical efficacy with widely used conventional retraction agents has not been tested. Purpose: The {{study was designed to}} clinically evaluate efficacy of newer retraction agent tetrahydrozoline with two widely used retraction systems i. e., Expasyl retraction system and medicated retraction cords on basis of amount of gingival retraction. Materials and Methods: 30 subjects were selected according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Maxillary Impressions were made with irreversible hydrocolloid for all subjects.

40|$|Purpose: This {{study was}} aimed to {{determine}} the effect of various tray spacer thickness and subsequent repeated pours on the accuracy and dimensional stability of the impression made from monophasic polyvinyl siloxane material. Materials and Methods: Custom trays with different spacer thickness (2, 4 and 6 mm) were used for making an impression of a master model simulating 3 unit fixed partial denture with monophasic polyvinyl siloxane material. These impressions were poured with <b>die</b> <b>stone</b> and repoured. Distance between the reference points were measured and subjected to statistical analysis. Result: Casts obtained from 1 st, 2 nd and 3 rd pour of the impression in 2, 4 and 6 mm spacer thickness tray have similar dimensional accuracy amongst each other and with the master model except in molar diameter and inter-abutment distances of cast obtained from 6 mm spacer thickness tray. Conclusion: The vertical distance of stone dies were decreased, whereas horizontal distance increased as the thickness of impression material is increased. There were statistically non-significant changes occurring among the repeated pours in 2, 4 and 6 mm spacer thickness. Clinical Implication: 2 and 4 mm spacer thickness are acceptable for making an impression for three unit fixed partial denture with monophasic polyvinyl siloxane material and it was not affected by two subsequent (1 st and 2 nd) repeated pours...|$|E
40|$|Aims : The {{application}} of a paint-on die spacer onto the dies prior to the fabrication of cast crowns is an acceptable procedure to improve the fit of the restoration. The primary {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the variation in thickness of different brands of die spacer based on the effect of storage time and {{application of}} additional layers. Materials and Methods: Dies were duplicated from a master model of ivorine teeth, with a full ceramic preparation. Dies obtained were then painted with one, two, and three coats of each brand of die-spacers separately. These dies were embedded in <b>die</b> <b>stone</b> and sectioned bucco-lingually. The same procedure was done after three and six months. The thickness of the paint on die spacer was measured at five points on the die using an optical microscope, and the data were statistically analyzed. Results and Conclusion : There was a definite variation in the thickness of the die spacer with all the three brands and at various points on the die. Two coat thicknesses were found to be in the range of tolerance of 20 - 40 microns. Thickness at occlusal groove was noted to be the maximum with least at occlusoaxial line angles.

Methods. Irreversible hydrocolloid impressions were con-taminated individually with Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Actinobacter calcoaceticus, Bacillus subtilis, Mycobacterium phlei and Candida albicans. Four readily available disinfecting solutions (glutaraldehyde, povidone-iodine, chlorhexidine and sodium hypochlorite) were added to the <b>die</b> <b>stone</b> mix used to pour up the impressions. The set cast surfaces were swabbed at 1 h and 24 h, the samples plated on agar and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h and 3 d for M. phlei. Subsequently, colony forming units were counted. The physical properties assessed were setting time, setting expansion, compressive strength, detail reproduction and delayed expansion of the stone. Results. Only glutaraldehyde and povidone-iodine killed all contaminating microorganisms within 1 h, while the 1 : 5 dilution of sodium hypochlorite solution was equally effective after 24 h. Two percent glutaraldehyde was the most effective disinfectant with the least adverse effects on the physical properties of the set cast. Although povidone-iodine caused a decrease in the compressive strength of the set cast, it can be considered to be a sound alternative. Significance. This study supports the concept of incorporating disinfectants into model stone as a standard operating procedure for impressions of unknown history and, most sensibly, all dental impressions...|$|E

Materials and Methods: Thirty subjects (10 males and 20 females; all aged 20 – 30 years) with complete set of natural upper and lower anterior teeth were selected for this study after obtaining approval from the Institutional Ethical Committee. The upper and lower alginate impressions were taken and <b>die</b> <b>stone</b> models were obtained from each impression; overlays were produced from the biting surfaces of six upper and six lower anterior teeth by hand tracing from study casts, hand tracing from wax impressions of the bite surface, radiopaque wax impression method, and xerographic method. These were compared with the original overlay produced digitally. Results: Xerographic method was the most accurate of the four techniques, with the highest reproducibility for bite mark analysis. The methods of wax impression were better for producing overlay of tooth away from the occlusal plane. Conclusions: Various techniques are used in bite mark analysis and the choice of technique depends largely on personal preference. No single technique {{has been shown to}} be better than the others and very little research has been carried out to compare different methods.

40|$|Objective: To {{suggest a}} custom bar {{supported}} overdenture treatment modality for prosthodontic management {{of patients with}} severe gag reflex. Background: Some patients have a severe gag reflex and cannot tolerate conventional maxillary complete dentures with maximum palatal coverage and extensions of all borders. The condition further gets complicated in patients suffering from respiratory problems along with severe gag reflex. Severe gagging acts {{as a barrier to}} treat such patients with accepted clinical procedures and prevent patients from wearing the prosthesis. By saving some of the remaining natural teeth and fabricating, a horse shoe shape palateless simple tooth or bar supported overdenture can be successfully used for treating such patients. Materials and Methods: The remaining maxillary right and left canines were prepared with the tapered round end diamond bur to receive copings of custom bar after intentional root canal treatment of same teeth. Impression was made with light body and putty of the polyvinyl siloxane elastomer with double step putty wash technique. Impression was poured with <b>die</b> <b>stone.</b> Wax pattern of copings with bar was fabricated with inlay wax which was invested and casted. After retrieving the bar, it was finished and its fit was evaluated. The coping-bar assembly was finally cemented with the glass ionomer cement.

40|$|Objective. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} if there was a significant difference on vertical marginal gap with metal copings fabricated by two different techniques. Background. The reduction of the marginal gap between a crown and tooth abutment is an important goal in Fixed Prosthodontics. Smaller gap produce less gingival irritation and decrease cement washout, improving the clinical outcome and longevity of the restoration. Methods. From a master die, eight impressions were made using PVS material. These 8 impressions were poured twice each in type IV <b>die</b> <b>stone</b> to produce 16 samples. The techniques used to fabricate the metal copings were: A wax pattern coping and a CAD/CAM milled plastic coping. The dies were numbered from 1 to 8 and marked A for the 1 st pour group and B for the 2 nd pour group. Groups 1 and 2 were organized as follows: Group 1 (CAD/CAM) included the first four samples of group A and the last four samples of Group B. Group 2 (WAX) included the last four samples of Group A and the first four samples of group B. The sixteen samples were sent to a dental laboratory for fabrication of metal copings produced by these two different techniques. Results.

40|$|Background The authors {{evaluated}} clinical {{performances of}} a packable and a conventional hybrid resin-based composite {{used with a}} self-etch adhesive system. Methods Three dentists placed 105 posterior restorations in 65 adults. They placed a packable (SureFil, Dentsply DeTrey GmbH, Konstanz, Germany) and a conventional (SpectrumTPH, Dentsply DeTrey GmbH) resin-based composite using a self-etch resin adhesive system. The authors evaluated the restorations using Ryge modified criteria, photographs and <b>die</b> <b>stone</b> replicas. Results After 3. 5 years, six large SureFil and two SpectrumTPH restorations had failed from bulk fracture and secondary caries, resulting in cumulative survival rates of 81. 3 and 92. 0 percent, respectively. Failed SureFil restorations generally were larger than the remaining intact restorations. Other ratings were satisfactory, with {{no significant differences between}} the two materials for any restoration parameter. Alfa ratings for both materials were approximately 80 percent or greater for marginal discoloration, anatomical form, surface texture and surface staining. Lower percentages of restorations were rated Alfa for color match, marginal integrity and gingival health. No postoperative sensitivity was reported. Net mean occlusal wear (± standard deviation) was 28. 9 (± 32. 9) micrometers for SureFil and 33. 8 (± 29. 6) μm for SpectrumTPH restorations; the difference was not statistically significant. Conclusions When used with a self-etch adhesive, the 3. 5 -year clinical performances of both composites were similar and satisfactory for the restoration of Class I and moderate-sized Class II cavities. Clinical Implications The two composites placed in this study have an increased risk of bulk fracture when placed in large intracoronal Class II molar preparations. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} test the ability of an {{algorithm}} to quantify simulated palatal erosion, a total of 10 extracted permanent upper central incisors were mounted in brass blocks. Baseline impressions were recorded using an addition cured silicone impression material in a metal impression tray. Once set and removed from the teeth, the impressions were coated twice with a high silver content electroconductive paint, applied using a brush, before being backed up with <b>die</b> <b>stone</b> to form an electroconductive replica. Each tooth was then subject to three treatments: application of phosphoric acid etchant gel for 60 s, application of etchant gel for 120 s and immersion for 3 h in Diet Coca-Cola*. After each one the replication process was repeated. Thereafter all replicas were mapped using a computer controlled electrical probe and the resultant digital terrain models (DTMS) compared using a surface matching and difference detection algorithm (SMADDA). Surface matching was unsuccessful only in one instance. As {{the duration of the}} insult increased, so did the proportion of the surface that underwent change to a maximum of 33 · 3 %. Anatomical site was significantly (P < 0 · 05) associated with the susceptibility to erosion. The cingulum periphery appeared most resistant to this. The algorithmic approach offers much scope for monitoring dental erosion as acid dissolution of the tooth's surface appears to occur gradually. The cingulum region appears relatively more resistant to this process than other tooth sites and thus facilitates the process of surface matching. Further testing is however, required to determine precisely the algorithm's upper tolerance level...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackground and aimOne of {{the major}} {{problems}} of all ceramic restorations is their probable fracture against the occlusal force. The aim of the present in vitro study is to compare the effect of two marginal designs (shoulder and chamfer) on the fracture resistance of all ceramic restorations, INCERAM. Materials and methodsOn an extracted first maxillary premolar 50 in. chamfer margin (0. 7 mm) was prepared. Ten impressions were taken using a polyvinylsiloxane. The impressions were poured with epoxy resin to fabricate dies. The same tooth was retrieved and 50 in. chamfer was converted into 90 in. shoulder (1 mm). Ten impressions were taken and ten more epoxy resin dies were fabricated. Impressions of each epoxy resin die were taken using polyvinylsiloxane impression material and poured with <b>die</b> <b>stone.</b> Alumina cores with 0. 5 mm thickness fabricated on the stone dies in a dental laboratory. The alumina cores were then cemented on the epoxy resin dies and underwent a fracture test with a universal testing machine and samples were investigated {{from the point of}} view of the origin of the failure. ResultThe mean value of fracture resistance for the chamfer samples were 610. 18 ± 58. 79 N and 502. 72 ± 105. 83 N for the shoulder samples. The Student's t-test revealed a statistically significant difference between groups. ConclusionThe result of this study indicates a relationship between the marginal design of the alumina cores and their fracture resistance. A chamfer margin could improve the biomechanical performance of posterior single crown alumina restorations. This may be because of the strong unity in the chamfer margin...|$|E
40|$|To {{compare the}} levels of {{agreement}} and the survival rates of sealant retention for different sealing materials over a 2 -year period assessed using the visual clinical examination and replica methods, sealant retention data were obtained by visual clinical examination and from replicas of the same sealed tooth at baseline and at 0. 5 -, 1 - and 2 -year evaluation points in 407 children and were compared for agreement using kappa coefficients. Survival curves of retained sealants on occlusal surfaces were created using modified categorisation (fully retained sealants and those having all pits and fissures partly covered with the sealant material versus completely lost sealants that included pit and fissure systems that had >/= 1 pit re-exposed) according to the Kaplan-Meier method. The kappa coefficient for the agreement between both assessment methods over the three evaluation time points combined was 0. 38 (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 35 - 0. 41). More sealant retention was observed from replicas than through visual clinical examination.
