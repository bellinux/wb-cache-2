5|$|According to Yoichi Wada, then-CEO of Square Enix, XIV {{was being}} planned {{as a serious}} rival to {{successful}} western MMORPG World of Warcraft. The game was developed primarily for Windows, and was then ported across to PS3. XIV was originally scheduled for simultaneous release on Windows and PS3 in 2010, but the PS3 version was delayed into 2011. This was <b>explained</b> <b>as</b> due to it taking longer than expected to make the adjustments needed so the game could fit within the console's limited memory. The game {{did not use the}} PlayOnline service used for XI. This was <b>explained</b> <b>as</b> being due to the marked decrease of content on the service. Instead, they would migrate to a new service that still allowed cross-platform gameplay, including the use of a universal Square Enix ID that would allow players to play from wherever they left off. In October 2009, the game's Beta release was announced as being only for Windows. First print runs of the PS3 version of Final Fantasy XIII contained a bonus code for the PS3 version of XIV for a special in-game item.|$|E
5|$|After further {{slippage}} in the timescales, {{the opening}} date was revised from late June 2015 to 19 August 2015.

The road finally opened {{on the evening of}} 19 August 2015, costing £20.4M in total, of which Sefton Council funded £5.9M (approximately 30%) of the cost.|$|E
5|$|Another myth {{surrounding}} this species {{is that it}} occasionally catches small monkeys and other large animals in its pitchers. Such tales have persisted {{for a very long}} time, but can probably be <b>explained</b> <b>as</b> rodents being mistaken for other species.

5|$|Most main-sequence {{stars with}} a {{spectral}} class between O5 and F5 {{have been found}} to rotate rapidly. For stars in this range, the measured rotation velocity increases with mass. This increase in rotation peaks among young, massive B-class stars. As the expected life span of a star decreases with increasing mass, this can be <b>explained</b> <b>as</b> a decline in rotational velocity with age.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} month, Frail {{observed}} that the luminosity of the radio source fluctuated significantly {{from day to day}} but increased on average. The fluctuations did not occur simultaneously along all of the observed wavelengths, which Jeremy Goodman of Princeton University <b>explained</b> <b>as</b> being the result of the radio waves being bent by interstellar plasma in the Milky Way. Such radio scintillations (rapid variations in the radio luminosity of an object) occur only when the source has an apparent diameter of less than 3microarcseconds.|$|E

5|$|The {{evolution}} of the asteroid belt after Late Heavy Bombardment was mainly governed by collisions. Objects with large mass have enough gravity to retain any material ejected by a violent collision. In the asteroid belt this usually is not the case. As a result, many larger objects have been broken apart, and sometimes newer objects have been forged from the remnants in less violent collisions. Moons around some asteroids currently can only be <b>explained</b> <b>as</b> consolidations of material flung away from the parent object without enough energy to entirely escape its gravity.|$|E
5|$|The fossils {{from near}} Santa Fé {{included}} the horse tooth which had puzzled Darwin {{as it had}} been previously thought that horses had only come to the Americas in the 16th century, close to a Toxodon tooth and a tooth of Mastodon andium (now Cuvieronius hyodon). Owen confirmed that the horse tooth was of an extinct South American species which he named Equus curvidens, and its age was confirmed by a corroded horse tooth among the Punta Alta fossils. This discovery was later <b>explained</b> <b>as</b> part of the evolution of the horse.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{religious}} {{language has}} been <b>explained</b> <b>as</b> via negativa, analogy, symbolism, or myth, {{each of which}} describes a way of talking about God in human terms. The via negativa {{is a way of}} referring to God according to what God is not; analogy uses human qualities as standards against which to compare divine qualities; symbolism is used non-literally to describe otherwise ineffable experiences; and a mythological interpretation of religion attempts to reveal fundamental truths behind religious stories. Alternative explanations of religious language cast it as having political, performative, or imperative functions.|$|E

Rob Hayter makes a cameo appearance as Bob, Agent of Hydra, a recurring character in the comics alongside Deadpool. The rights for Bob are owned by Marvel Studios, who did not give permission {{for him to be}} used in the film, so his comic history and connections to the organization Hydra are not referenced in the film. He is instead <b>explained</b> <b>as</b> a former special forces operative like Wilson. Wolverine star Hugh Jackman was very supportive of Deadpool, and of it making fun of himself and his character, and is seen in the film via his People's Sexiest Man Alive magazine cover.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{types of}} {{learning}} are possible, respective to each applicable type of learning, only within a limited age range {{known as a}} critical period. Bowlby's concepts included the idea that attachment involved learning from experience during a limited age period, influenced by adult behaviour. He did not apply the imprinting concept in its entirety to human attachment. However, he considered that attachment behaviour was best <b>explained</b> <b>as</b> instinctive, combined with the effect of experience, stressing the readiness the child brings to social interactions. Over time it became apparent there were more differences than similarities between attachment theory and imprinting so the analogy was dropped.|$|E
5|$|Domain-general views {{have been}} criticized for not fully {{explaining}} how children manage to avoid mapping errors when there are numerous possible referents to which objects, actions, or events might point. For instance, if biases are not present from birth, why do infants assume that labels refer to whole objects, instead of salient parts of these objects? However, domain-general perspectives do not dismiss the notion of biases. Rather, they suggest biases develop through learning strategies instead of existing as built-in constraints. For instance, the whole object bias could be <b>explained</b> <b>as</b> a strategy that humans use to reason about the world; perhaps we are prone to thinking about our environment in terms of whole objects, and this strategy is not specific to the language domain. Additionally, children may be exposed to cues associated with categorization by shape early in the word learning process, which would draw their attention to shape when presented with novel objects and labels. Ordinary learning could, then, lead to a shape bias.|$|E

5|$|From 1830 to 1833, {{geologist}} Charles Lyell {{published his}} multi-volume work Principles of Geology, which, building on Hutton's ideas, advocated a uniformitarian {{alternative to the}} catastrophic theory of geology. Lyell claimed that, rather than being the products of cataclysmic (and possibly supernatural) events, the geologic features of the Earth are better <b>explained</b> <b>as</b> {{the result of the}} same gradual geologic forces observable in the present day—but acting over immensely long periods of time. Although Lyell opposed evolutionary ideas (even questioning the consensus that the fossil record demonstrates a true progression), his concept that the Earth was shaped by forces working gradually over an extended period, and the immense age of the Earth assumed by his theories, would strongly influence future evolutionary thinkers such as Charles Darwin.|$|E
5|$|In Greek mythology, Taurus was {{identified}} with Zeus, who assumed {{the form of}} a magnificent white bull to abduct Europa, a legendary Phoenician princess. In illustrations of Greek mythology, only the front portion of this constellation are depicted; this was sometimes <b>explained</b> <b>as</b> Taurus being partly submerged as he carried Europa out to sea. A second Greek myth portrays Taurus as Io, a mistress of Zeus. To hide his lover from his wife Hera, Zeus changed Io into {{the form of a}} heifer. Greek mythographer Acusilaus marks the bull Taurus as the same that formed the myth of the Cretan Bull, one of The Twelve Labors of Heracles.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{the latest}} {{aggregated}} {{research has found}} {{no difference in the}} prevalence of self-harm between men and women. This is in contrast to past research which indicated that up to four times as many females as males have direct experience of self-harm. However, caution is needed in seeing self-harm as a greater problem for females, since males may engage in different forms of self-harm (e.g., hitting themselves) which could be easier to hide or <b>explained</b> <b>as</b> the result of different circumstances. Hence, there remain widely opposing views as to whether the gender paradox is a real phenomenon, or merely the artifact of bias in data collection.|$|E
