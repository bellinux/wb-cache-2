This recommended combat air patrols (CAP) which were larger and operated further from the carriers than before, a line of picket destroyers and destroyer escorts at least 80 km from {{the main body of the}} fleet to provide earlier radar interception, and improved coordination between fighter direction officers on carriers. This plan also called for around-the-clock fighter patrols over Allied fleets, though the U.S. Navy had cut back training of fighter pilots so there were not enough Navy pilots available to counter the kamikaze threat. A final element included intensive fighter sweeps over Japanese airfields, and bombing of Japanese runways, using delayed action bombs to make repairs more difficult.|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} an {{increase}} in gravity on the mechanics of running has been studied by using a force platform fixed to the floor of an aircraft undergoing flight profiles, resulting in a simulated gravity of 1. 3 g. The power spent to maintain the motion of the centre of mass of the body is similar to 1. 3 times greater than on Earth, due to a similar increase of both the power spent against gravity and to sustain the forward speed changes. This indicates that the average vertical displacement per unit distance and the average direction of the push are unchanged. The increase in power is mainly due to {{an increase in}} step frequency rather than to an increase in the work done at each step. The increase in step frequency in turn is mainly due to a decreased duration of the <b>effective</b> <b>aerial</b> phase (when the vertical force is less than body weight), rather than an increase in the stiffness of the bouncing system. The maximal speed where step frequency can match the resonant frequency of the bouncing system is increased by similar to 5 km h(- 1) at 1. 3 g. These results suggest a similar running mechanics at higher gravity, maintained at the expense of greater energy expenditure...|$|R
40|$|International audienceConstructed {{wetlands}} (CWs) {{offer an}} alternative to traditional industrial wastewater treatment systems that has been proved to be efficient, cost-effective and environmentally friendly. Most of the time, CWs are planted with proliferative species such as Phragmites australis or with plants originating from nurseries, both representing a risk for the natural biodiversity conservation of aquatic ecosystems located downstream of the CWs. For the removal of metals and organic pollutant mixtures present in industrial effluents, {{it is necessary to}} select tolerant plant species that are able to produce a high aboveground biomass and to develop a healthy belowground system. Wild plant species growing in aquatic bodies at industrial outfalls could constitute suitable tolerant species to use in CWs for industrial effluent treatment. To test this hypothesis, we assessed, under laboratory conditions (using an experimental design), the tolerance to mixtures of metals (Al, As, Cd, Cu, Cr, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sn, Zn) or/and organic pollutants (THC, PHE, PYR, LAS) of five European sub-cosmopolitan native macrophytes (Alisma lanceolatum, Carex cuprina, Epilobium hirsutum, Iris pseudacorus and Juncus inflexus) that had been collected in a polluted Mediterranean wetland, after a field study (crossing ecological releves and analyses of contaminant concentrations in water and sediments). Our results demonstrated that research on phytoremediation of industrial effluents should focus much more on the use of native macrophytes growing at short distances from industrial discharges (such as C cuprina in this study), and that root/shoot ratio, <b>aerial</b> <b>height</b> and proportion of green leaves are good and cost-effective indicators of plant tolerance to metals and organic pollutant mixtures in laboratory studies.

We coupled population genetics and phylogenetic approaches to understand spatial structure in fungal populations on a continental scale. Using nine microsatellite markers, we characterized gene flow among 16 {{populations of the}} widespread EM basidiomycete Laccaria amethystina over Europe (i. e. over 2900 km). We also widened our scope to two additional populations from Japan (104 km away) and compared them with European populations through microsatellite markers and multilocus phylogenies, using three nuclear genes (NAR, G 6 PD and ribosomal DNA) and two mitochondrial ribosomal genes. European L. amethystina populations displayed limited differentiation (average FST = 0. 041) and very weak isolation by distance (IBD). This panmictic European pattern may result from <b>effective</b> <b>aerial</b> dispersal of spores, high genetic diversity in populations and mutualistic interactions with multiple hosts that all facilitate migration. The multilocus phylogeny based on nuclear genes confirmed that Japanese and European specimens were closely related but clustered on a geographical basis. By using microsatellite markers, we found that Japanese populations were strongly differentiated from the European populations (FST = 0. 416), more than expected by extrapolating the European pattern of IBD. Population structure analyses clearly separated the populations into two clusters, i. e. European and Japanese clusters. We discuss the possibility of IBD in a continuous population (considering some evidence for a ring species over the Northern Hemisphere) vs. an allopatric speciation over Eurasia, making L. amethystina a promising model of intercontinental species for future studies...|$|R
