It has developed the unique FS-FHSS based on the spread spectrum communication technology. The new technology can monitor and select the undisturbed frequency band. FS-FHSS makes sure {{the stability of the}} communication. It is applied to GONSIN wireless conference system, which implements the discussion、simultaneous interpretation、voting and others comprehensive conference application functions. The feature of FS-FHSS: it uses the 2.4 GHz global frequency band, it does not require certificate. The wireless frequency points are abundant, 80 frequency points could be used; 2.4 GHz has high frequency carrier, the signal diffractivity is relatively weak so that other 2.4 GHz signal could not interfere the conference signal. Adopt FS-FHSS technology, it detect the wireless environment and select the useable <b>frequency</b> <b>point</b> before the conference, during the conference, it hops between the backup frequency points, which can avoid the interference source. It utilizes the efficient digital audio encode and decode technology, one <b>frequency</b> <b>point</b> can transmit 4 channels, it just need two frequency points to transmit 8 channels simultaneous interpretation signals. Because the system occupies relatively less frequency points resource and utilizes the FS-FHSS technology to operate, it can co-work with WIFI and other 2.4 GHz system. It applies the digital audio encryption and digital modulation to avoid any interception and malicious interference; the signal transmitting power could be modified in according with the application occasion, the adjusting range is from 50 meters to 500 meters( [...] the customized system can cover 2,000 meters).|$|E

50|$|In {{terrestrial}} {{point to}} point microwave systems ranging from 11 GHz to 80 GHz, a parallel backup link can be installed alongside a rain fade prone higher bandwidth connection. In this arrangement, a primary link such as an 80 GHz 1 Gbit/s full duplex microwave bridge may be calculated to have a 99.9% availability rate over the period of one year. The calculated 99.9% availability rate means that the link may be down for a cumulative total of ten or more hours per year as the peaks of rain storms pass over the area. A secondary lower bandwidth link such as a 5.8 GHz based 100 Mbit/s bridge may be installed parallel to the primary link, with routers on both ends controlling automatic failover to the 100 Mbit/s bridge when the primary 1 Gbit/s link is down due to rain fade.

5000|$|The {{calculations}} can {{be carried}} out by means of a straightforward computer algorithm, but this is not very efficient in computer usage. Consequently, more efficient algorithms have been developed, especially Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT). Computer programs which implement the FFT are widely available in the literature and in proprietary CAD programs such as Mathcad, MATLAB, and Mathematica. In the following example a linear chirp with time bandwidth product of 25 is sampled at 128 points (i.e. N = 128). In the figure samples of the real part of the waveform are shown - note that these are samples in the time domain. The FFT process assumes the waveform is cyclic, so these 128 data points can be considered to be part of an endlessly repeating sequence in time.By calculating the N-point FFT of this data, the discrete spectrum of the sequence is obtained. The magnitude of this spectrum is shown in the attached figure, where these data points are samples in frequency. The data is cyclic so, in the plot, the zero <b>frequency</b> <b>point</b> is at n = 0 and also at n = 128 (i.e. both points are the same frequency). The point n = 64 corresponds to +fs/2 (and also to -fs/2).To display the spectrum in more detail (but not necessarily with more resolution), the time sequence can be extended by zero padding. [...] For example, extending the 128 point time sequence with zeros to give N = 4096 results {{in that part of the}} spectrum originally presented in 16 samples, now being presented in 512 samples, as shown.|$|E

As a result, the <b>frequency</b> <b>point</b> B should be the first-order localized response of the right side section of the perforated rectangular resonator. For <b>frequency</b> <b>point</b> D, we observed that its |Hy| field distribution is mainly focused on the left side of the lossy dielectric layer (see Fig.  4 l), indicating this mode should be attributed to the first-order localized response of the left side section of the perforated rectangular resonator. Based on the above analysis, the introduction of the air hole on the rectangular resonator can indeed play a important role in the redistribution of the near-field patterns. The redistributed near-field distributions come into being two new absorption modes, the frequency points B and D. As a result, quad-band light absorption device can be realized in this slightly deformed rectangular resonator. Compared to the traditional design methods to obtain the multiple-band absorption [22 – 38], the concept of the design possesses obvious advantages, such as simplified structure design, low-cost and easy fabrication steps, and so on.|$|E
