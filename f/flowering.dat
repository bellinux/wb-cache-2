5|$|Banksia prionotes × hookeriana {{has also}} been {{verified}} as occurring in the wild, but only in disturbed locations. The two parent species have overlapping ranges and are pollinated by the same honeyeater species; and though preferring different soils, they often occur near enough {{to each other for}} pollinators to move between them. It therefore appears that the only barrier to hybridisation in undisturbed areas is the different <b>flowering</b> seasons: B.prionotes has usually finished <b>flowering</b> by the end of May, whereas <b>flowering</b> of B.hookeriana usually does not begin until June. In disturbed areas, however, the increased runoff and reduced competition mean extra nutrients are available, and this results in larger plants with more flowers and a longer <b>flowering</b> season. Thus the <b>flowering</b> seasons overlap, and the sole barrier to interbreeding is removed. The resultant F1 hybrids are fully fertile, with seed production rates {{similar to that of the}} parent species. There is no barrier to backcrossing of hybrids with parent species, and in some populations this has resulted in hybrid swarms. This raises the possibility of the parent species gradually losing their genetic integrity, especially if the intermediate characteristics of the hybrid offer it a competitive advantage over the parent species, such as a wider habitat tolerance. Moreover, speciation might occur if the hybrid's intermediate characteristics allow it to occupy a habitat unsuited to both parents, such as an intermediate soil type.|$|E

5|$|Female moths are {{attracted}} to <b>flowering</b> soybean fields. The most severe infestations occur between <b>flowering</b> and when pods become fully developed. Large-scale outbreak is associated with time of peak <b>flowering,</b> when most pods are developed, and peak moth flight, for giant. Moths are also attracted to drought stressed soybeans or fields with poor growth. Dry weather leads to quick drying of corn plants, compelling moths to leave and seek other hosts. Heavy rainfall also decreases corn earworm populations because it drowns pupae in their soil chambers, limits moth flight, washes eggs from leaves, and creates favorable conditions for fungal diseases that kill caterpillars.|$|E
5|$|<b>Flowering</b> {{begins in}} February {{and is usually}} {{finished}} {{by the end of}} June.

Individual flowers open sequentially from bottom to top within each inflorescence, the rate varying with the time of day: more flowers open during the day than at night, with a peak rate of around two to three florets per hour during the first few hours of daylight, when honeyeater foraging is also at its peak.|$|E

40|$|<b>Flower</b> {{size and}} number of <b>flowers</b> per plant are {{important}} external quality aspects in cut chrysanthemum. The present work is conducted in a glasshouse and aims at investigating how these quality aspects can be predicted.

To analyse the effect of assimilate supply on number of <b>flowers</b> per plant, three light intensities (no shade control, 65 ␕ight, and 45 ␕ight) where combined with three plant densities (32, 64, and 80 plants m- 2).
