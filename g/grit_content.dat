40|$|The {{utilization}} of whole grains in food formulations is nowadays recommended. Extrusion cooking allows obtaining precooked cereal products {{and a wide}} range of ready-to-eat foods. Two rice varieties having different amylose content (Fortuna 16 % and Paso 144, 27 %) were extruded using a Brabender single screw extruder. Factorial experimental design was used to study the effects of extrusion temperature (160, 175, and 190 °C) and <b>grits</b> moisture <b>content</b> (14 %, 16. 5 %, and 19 %) on extrudate properties. Specific mechanical energy consumption (SMEC), radial expansion (E), specific volume (SV), water absorption (WA), and solubility (S) were determined on each extrudate sample. In general, Fortuna variety showed higher values of SMEC and S (703 – 409 versus 637 – 407 [*]J/g; 33. 0 – 21. 0 versus 20. 1 – 11. 0 %, resp.) than those of Paso 144; on the contrary SV (8. 64 – 3. 47 versus 8. 27 – 4. 53 [*]mL/g) and WA tended to be lower (7. 7 – 5. 1 versus 8. 4 – 6. 6 [*]mL/g). Both varieties showed similar values of expansion rate (3. 60 – 2. 18). Physical characteristics depended on extrusion conditions and rice variety used. The degree of cooking reached by Paso rice samples was lower than that obtained for Fortuna. It is suggested that the presence of germ and bran interfered with the cooking process, decreasing friction level and broadening residence time distribution...|$|R

Hardness measurement and protein content analysis results of the two varieties of corn grits resulted from degermination show that incubation with papain on corn grits reduced grit hardness and protein <b>content.</b> <b>Grit</b> hardness reduction is due to protein matrix degradation that covers starch granular of horny endosperm. It is identified that local corn grit reduction difference is bigger than that of hybrid corn grits. Observation on morphology grits shows that there are difference in incubation effect with papain on both variety corn grits. First, local corn horny endosperm starch granular size is smaller and more homogeneous (3 - 7 µm) than that of hybrid corn (3 - 12 µm). Second, local corn horny endosperm granular shape is spherical while hybrid corn’s is dominantly polygonal. The association shows that hardness difference on local corn and hybrid corn does not affect directly to corn flour amylograph characteristics produced...|$|R
40|$|A {{study is}} {{presented}} on {{the influence of}} processing conditions on tempering grit rheology and the resulting molecular fragmentation of starch that occurs during the milling of conventional processed grit corn flakes. Corn grits were tempered and milled under a range of combinations of processing conditions which included low and high percent moistures and tempering temperatures. Starch fragmentation was determined using hot and cold water-soluble fractionation methods and an intermediate-pressure size-exclusion chromatograph with multi-angle laser light scattering and refractive index detection. Rheology of the tempered grits was obtained using a broad band frequency squeezing flow technique. Results showed that tempered <b>grit</b> moisture <b>content</b> and tempering temperature and time directly influence the rheology of the tempered corn grits. Rheology of the tempered corn grits was shown to directly influence mill gap width and roll vibrations. Corn grits processed under low moisture-low tempering temperatures were significantly harder. Generally, moisture content was the principal component governing final grit hardness and milled flake thickness in experiments using the same flaking roll setting. Processing conditions resulting in increased shear forces at the flaking mill produced increased amounts of fragmented amylopectin with decreasing average molecular weights. Overall, thinner flakes produced a higher degree of starch fragmentation, yet processing conditions can be modified to yield a range of starch fragmentation for any given milled flake thickness. Characterization of the fragmented starch occurring during milling is presented. Depending on processing conditions, the average molecular weight of the branched polymer was 1. 5 × 10 6 to 1. 1 × 107 Da. Resulting starch fragmentation was shown to strongly impact bowl life and overall sensory quality of the finished corn flakes. Corn flake samples containing high amounts of starch fragmentation were positively correlated to increased water uptake and increased leaching of starch fragments into water. Processing conditions resulting in corn flakes of the same milled flake thickness, but containing different amounts of starch fragmentation, further corresponded to different bowl lives with the flake sample containing the highest amount of starch fragmentation yielding the poorest bowl life. ...|$|R

Therefore {{the aim of this}} study was to determine the effect of screw configuration (4 : 1 and 1 : 1), moisture content (15 % and 20 %) and particle size of corn grits (> 500 µm and < 500 µm) on properties of extrudates. Samples were extruded in the laboratory single screw extruder Brabender 19 / 20 DN, at temperature profile 135 / 170 / 170 °C, using die with 4 mm diameter. Physical and rheological properties, digestibility and starch damage of the obtained extrudates were determined, and results were compared with control samples of non-extruded corn <b>grits.</b> Lower moisture <b>content</b> and usage of screw with compression ratio 4 : 1 increased expansion ratio and fracturability, but decreased bulk density and hardness of extrudates, regardless of granularity. After extrusion process water absorption index increased, but peak, hot and cold viscosity of all samples decreased, with more pronounced effect in grits extruded with lower moisture content and with screw 4 : 1.

40|$|Ready to Eat (RTE) {{snack foods}} are {{commonly}} manufactured using single and twin screw extruders and com grits as raw materials. Variations in product quality caused by grits from different hybrids and grain hardness {{have not been}} investigated. Furthermore, the relationship between rheological properties of the extrudate melt and the operating conditions in the extruder is not fully understood. Appropriate methods to determine com grain hardness to characterise com hybrids and the on-line viscosity of the extrudate melts {{have not yet been}} developed. These methods could provide sound and appropriate techniques to investigate the areas of milling and extrusion of com based food products. In this study, milling characteristics of 38 com hybrids from the 92 - 93 season and 12 com hybrids from the 94 - 95 season produced in New Zealand were studied. A modified Stenvert Hardness Test (SHT) using new parameters including milling energy and milling resistance time was developed. It was found that the modified SHT was simple and easy to use with low variability. The SHT milling energy can be used as an effective hardness index. It increased with grain bulk density and the ratio of hard to soft endosperm. All measured properties were highly dependent on the moisture content. For the same hybrid, SHT hardness increased and the grain bulk density decreased when the moisture content of the com grains increased. A roller-milling test was also developed to study the dry milling characteristics of these com hybrids. During milling, the breaking force measured in the roller-milling test increased with grain hardness. Analysis of particle size distributions in the ground samples after the modified Stenvert Hardness tests and the roller-milling tests showed that grit recovery rate increased with the grain hardness. Grits produced from hybrids harvested in the 92 - 93 and the 94 - 95 seasons, along with other grits and starches commercially manufactured in New Zealand, were used for the extrusion experiments. A new Slit-Die-Viscometer (SDV) was developed to measure the viscosity of extrudate melts on-line. Unlike many other viscometers used on-line, the operation of the new SDV did not interfere with the operating conditions of the extruder. The rheological properties and the degree of starch gelatinisation were affected by the operating conditions of the extruder and the characteristics of the raw materials: It was found that the melt viscosity decreased as moisture content increased. The apparent viscosity had a maximum value at barrel temperature of about 130 DC, changed very little when screw speed increased at constant feed, and decreased slightly when the feed increased at constant screw speed. The grits were less gelatinised at high moisture content. The degree of starch gelatinisation increased slightly with screw speed and linearly with barrel temperature between 90 DC and 130 DC. At barrel temperatures higher than 130 DC, the extrudate was almost fully gelatinised. Melts produced with starch of high amylopectin content had an overall lower viscosity with less shear thinning and a higher degree of starch gelatinisation than that produced with starch of high amylose <b>content.</b> <b>Grit</b> size affected the rheological properties and the degree of starch gelatinisation. Melts produced from medium and coarse grits had a lower viscosity and a lower degree of starch gelatinisation than that produced with fine grits. The effect of different hybrids of the same season on the rheological properties of the melt was negligible. However, the rheological properties were affected by the methods used to produce the grits. Grits from degermed grains had less oil and produced melts with lower viscosity and less shear thinning than grits from whole grains (higher oil content) ...|$|R
