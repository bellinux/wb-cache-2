5|$|According to Njal's saga, Bróðir {{tried by}} sorcery {{to predict the}} outcome of the battle against Brian. He augured that if the battle were on Good <b>Friday,</b> King Brian would fall but win the battle; but if they fought on any day before, all who opposed Brian would be killed. Brian was unwilling to fight on Good <b>Friday,</b> as he would not fight on a fast day, but the Danes forced the battle to the <b>Friday,</b> which fell that year on 23 April.|$|E
5|$|After his release, <b>Friday</b> {{returned}} to Acton, {{where he had}} a girlfriend called Maxine Doughan and a baby daughter called Nicola. Maxine was of mixed race. The local controversy surrounding the interracial relationship caused the couple and their circle of friends to be socially isolated, {{and led to a}} physical attack on the group one night in an Acton public house. Despite this, and the opposition by both sets of parents—Alf refused to even attend the wedding—they married, both aged 17. <b>Friday</b> did not take his marital commitments seriously and continued to womanise, drink heavily and take narcotics. A friend who played for Walthamstow Avenue, a semi-professional Isthmian League club from north-east London, took <b>Friday</b> along to training one day in early 1971. <b>Friday</b> played well enough for Walthamstow to sign him the same day on wages of £10 per week. Many of his new teammates were asphalters from east London, and <b>Friday</b> soon joined them in that trade.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the films}} were not popular with critics, <b>Friday</b> the 13th is {{considered}} one of the most successful media franchises in America—not only for the success of the films, but also because of the extensive merchandising and repeated references to the series in popular culture. The franchise's popularity has generated a fanbase who have created their own <b>Friday</b> the 13th films, fashioned replica Jason Voorhees costumes, and tattooed their bodies with <b>Friday</b> the 13th artwork. Jason's hockey mask has become one of the most recognizable images in horror and popular culture.|$|E

5|$|From {{the figure}} 8, {{it is clear}} that an economy {{operating}} at a position where the MRS of either Crusoe or <b>Friday</b> is not equal to the MRT between coconuts and fish cannot be Pareto efficient. This is because the rate at which, say <b>Friday</b> is willing to trade coconuts for fish is different from the rate at which coconuts can be transformed into fish. Thus, {{there is a way to}} make <b>Friday</b> better off by rearranging the production pattern.|$|E

5000|$|The {{business}} side at <b>Friday's</b> grew with the systems and controls like those used at Boise Cascade Corporation which enabled Scoggin to increase <b>Friday's</b> bottom line from 9% to 30% {{within a year}} of their implementation. The systems, philosophies and theories developed at <b>Friday's</b> became industry standards. Managers trained at <b>Friday's</b> became the most sought after in the industry and were often paid bonuses for bringing <b>Friday's</b> training manuals to the competition. The innovations developed by Scoggin and T.G.I.Friday's, Inc. are used in many types of industries today. As the industry innovator, <b>Friday's</b> was noted for leading customer trends: the creation of potato skins, blended and frozen drinks (Smoothies and Flings), summer menus, a non-alcoholic menu as well as expanding regional cuisines across the nation. Later as drinking moderated in the United States, <b>Friday's</b> led the casual theme industry towards high-end cognacs and wines in an effort to educate the consumer through drinking less, but drinking better. Adding flair bartending became so popular it led to the Bartender Olympics that is a worldwide event even today. The film Cocktail, starring Tom Cruise, was based on <b>Friday's</b> bartender flair. The legendary [...] "Magic" [...] Mike Werner and Jimmy Skeadas having been schooled in <b>Friday's</b> method of bartending, went on to create ShowTenders the international bartender training college. One of the most memorable beverage promotions done by <b>Friday's</b> edged FedEx into the international shipping business by participating in the great worldwide delivery race of Beaujolais Nouveau. <b>Friday's</b> was the winner of the American race by arriving earliest in the States with a FedEx DC-10 fully loaded with the wine.|$|R

5|$|If we {{want more}} fish, we should shift that person who has a {{comparative}} advantage in fish hunting (i.e. <b>Friday)</b> out of coconut gathering and into fish hunting. When <b>Friday</b> is producing 96 pounds of fish, he is fully occupied. If fish production is to be increased beyond this point, Crusoe will have to start hunting fish. Here onward, {{the slope of the}} joint PPF is -2. If we want to produce only fish, then the economy will have 144 pounds of fish, 48 from Crusoe and 96 from <b>Friday.</b> Thus the joint PPF is kinked because Crusoe and <b>Friday</b> have comparative advantages in different commodities. As the economy gets more and more ways of producing output and different comparative advantages, the PPF becomes concave.|$|E

5|$|Late in Friday's {{first season}} in Wales, Cardiff took on Luton Town on 16 April 1977. Cardiff {{were in the}} relegation zone and had not won in seven games, while Luton were fifth in the table and {{challenging}} for promotion. After clashing repeatedly early in the match with Luton goalkeeper Milija Aleksic, <b>Friday</b> was lectured by the referee for a high tackle on the goalkeeper in the 36th minute. <b>Friday</b> held {{out a hand to}} apologise, but Aleksic reacted angrily. When the free kick was taken, <b>Friday</b> ran back, stole the ball from Luton defender John Faulkner, broke away, rounded Aleksic and slotted the ball past him into the net. In celebration, <b>Friday</b> jogged back past the goalkeeper while giving him the V-sign. Cardiff won the match 4–2 {{and at the end of}} the season avoided relegation to the third tier only on goal difference. Meanwhile, without <b>Friday,</b> Reading were relegated back to the Fourth Division by one point. Friday's actions became even stranger during his time at Cardiff; after they lost the second leg of the Welsh Cup final 3–0 to Shrewsbury Town on 18 May 1977, the players and staff were awoken in the middle of the night by loud bangs coming from below their rooms. The cause was found to be <b>Friday,</b> standing on the hotel's snooker table in his underpants and throwing the balls around the room in fury.|$|E
