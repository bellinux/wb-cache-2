500|$|Walpole {{was sent}} to England, where {{according}} to his biographer Rupert Hart-Davis {{the next ten years}} were the unhappiest time of Walpole's life. He first attended a preparatory school in Truro. Though he missed his family and felt lonely he was reasonably happy, but he moved to Sir William Borlase's Grammar School in Marlow in 1895, where he was bullied, frightened and miserable. He later said, [...] "The food was inadequate, the morality was 'twisted', and Terror – sheer, stark unblinking Terror – stared down every one of its passages... The excessive desire to be loved that has always played so enormous a part in my life was bred largely, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>from</b> the neglect I suffered there".|$|E
500|$|After Troutman's death, Ice Cube {{said that}} [...] "More Bounce To The Ounce" [...] {{introduced}} him to hip-hop. [...] "I was in the sixth grade, we'd stayed after school. We had this dude named Mr. Lock, {{and he used to}} bring in his radio with these pop-lockers. He used to teach [...] the L.A. Lockers, and he would do community service in after-school programs. He knew a lot of kids and introduced them to all the new dances, he put on that song 'More Bounce', and they started pop-locking. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>from</b> that visual, from seeing that, it was my first introduction into hip-hop. Period. I didn't know nothing about nothing. I hadn't heard [...] "Rapper's Delight" [...] yet. It was the first thing that was really fly to me. They started dancing, and since 'More Bounce' goes on forever, they just got down. I just think that was a rush of adrenaline for me, like a chemical reaction in my brain." ...|$|E
500|$|I {{was visiting}} {{my friend and}} generous benefactor, Prof. Edward C. Pickering. With {{characteristic}} kindness, he had volunteered to have the spectra observed for all the stars—including comparison stars—which had been observed in the observations for stellar parallax which Hinks and I made at Cambridge, and I discussed. This piece of apparently routine work proved very fruitful—it led to the discovery that all the stars of very faint absolute magnitude were of spectral class M. In conversation on this subject (as I recall it), I asked Pickering about certain other faint stars, not on my list, mentioning in particular 40 Eridani B. Characteristically, he sent a note to the Observatory office and before long the answer came (<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>from</b> Mrs Fleming) that the spectrum of this star was A. I knew enough about it, even in these paleozoic days, to realize at once {{that there was an}} extreme inconsistency between what we would then have called [...] "possible" [...] values of the surface brightness and density. I must have shown that I was not only puzzled but crestfallen, at this exception to what looked like a very pretty rule of stellar characteristics; but Pickering smiled upon me, and said: [...] "It is just these exceptions that lead to an advance in our knowledge", and so the white dwarfs entered the realm of study! ...|$|E

2500|$|An early {{source of}} disillusionment with Britain's {{imperial}} policy was his realisation that, given more patient and skilful negotiation, the Boer War {{could have been}} avoided. His friend and biographer Basil Williams noticed his growing doubts about Britain's actions in South Africa while they were on campaign together: [...] "Both of us, who came out as hide-bound Tories, began to tend towards more liberal ideas, partly from the ... democratic company we were keeping, but chiefly, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>from</b> our discussions on politics and life generally." ...|$|E
2500|$|Two of his novels, Cliffs of Fall (1945) and Not Here, Not Now (1970), {{are set in}} Otago University, {{although}} Bertram {{says they}} are [...] "among his least satisfactory works". Dan and Winnie co-authored a publication for schools by the Department of Education School Publications Branch, Writing in New Zealand: The New Zealand Novel (1956, parts 1, 2). Chris Laidlaw who used to drink with Dan in Oxford said there was [...] "an abiding sadness about Dan; a melancholy that sprang, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>from</b> his frustration at being a prophet without honour in his own country. ... He was an early victim of the great New Zealand clobbering machine and often warned me to beware of this." [...] Laidlaw quoted Davin's view that in New Zealand {{there is a very}} strong [...] "stereoptype that controls what you can say or be seen to do." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shoemaker also {{addressed}} an AA group in Charlotte, North Carolina, June 17, 1962 saying:To {{set the record}} straight, that there has gotten going in AA, a kind of rumor, that I {{had a lot to}} do with the 12 steps. I didn't have anymore to do with those 12 steps other than that book had, those twelve steps, I believe came to Bill by himself, I think he told me they came to him in about 40 minutes and I think its one of the great instances of direct inspiration that I know in human history, inspiration which doesn't only bring material straight down outta heaven, but brings rather <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>from</b> God the ability to interpret human experience in such a way that you distill it down into transmissible principles, I compare it to Moses going up on a mountain and bringing down Ten tables of the Law, I don't think that's the first time Moses ever thought about righteousness, but I'm glad he went up there and got those ten and brought em down and gave em to us. And I'm glad Bill got quiet for those 40 minutes, until he finished off these 12 steps and I believe they have only been changed by about one word. Bill said at the end of this talk [...] "Who invented AA?, It was God almighty that invented AA, but this is the story of how we learned to be Free." [...] And he closed by saying [...] "God grant that AA and the program of recovery, and unity, and service be a story that continues into the future as long as God needs it." [...] Praise be to God for it, and for the life of that fellow and all those who where with him in the beginnings of this incredible movement.|$|E

60|$|They {{were both}} attentive. Mabane's {{expression}} was purely negative. Arthur, {{on the other}} hand, was distinctly nervous. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>from</b> the first he had some idea {{what it was that}} I wanted to say.|$|R

6000|$|... "I have noticed," [...] he said, [...] "that {{you seem}} to delight in taking a topsy-turvy view of life. It arises, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>from</b> an over {{developed}} sense of humour. You would find things to laugh at even in Artemus Ward." ...|$|E
