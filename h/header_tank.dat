5|$|The Spitfire's {{airframe}} was complex: the streamlined, semi-monocoque duralumin fuselage {{featured a}} large number of compound curves built up from a skeleton of 19 formers, also known as frames, starting from frame number one, immediately behind the propeller unit, to the tail unit attachment frame. The first four frames supported the glycol <b>header</b> <b>tank</b> and engine cowlings. Frame 5, to which the engine bearers were secured, supported the weight of the engine and accessories, and the loads imposed by the engine. This was a strengthened double frame which also incorporated the fireproof bulkhead and, in later versions of the Spitfire, the oil tank. This frame also tied the four main fuselage longerons {{to the rest of the}} airframe. Behind the bulkhead were five 'U' shaped half-frames which accommodated the fuel tanks and cockpit. The rear fuselage started at the eleventh frame, to which the pilot's seat and (later) armour plating was attached, and ended at the nineteenth, which was mounted at a slight forward angle just forward of the fin. Each of these nine frames were oval, reducing in size towards the tail, and incorporated several lightening holes to reduce their weight as much as possible without weakening them. The U-shaped frame 20 was the last frame of the fuselage proper and the frame to which the tail unit was attached. Frames 21, 22 and 23 formed the fin; frame 22 incorporated the tailwheel opening and frame 23 was the rudder post. Before being attached to the main fuselage, the tail unit frames were held in a jig and the eight horizontal tail formers were riveted to them.|$|E
25|$|Late {{production}} Mk IXs, {{in common}} with Mk XVIs introduced a new upper engine cowling which incorporated a distinct bulged top surface; this design was adopted for the Mk XVI {{to allow for the}} modified intercooler of the Packard Merlin 266, which had an integral <b>header</b> <b>tank.</b>|$|E
25|$|Since 1904, the fluted {{top surface}} to the {{radiator}} grille has been Daimler's distinguishing feature. This motif {{developed from the}} heavily finned water-cooling tubes slung externally {{at the front of}} early cars. Later, a more conventional, vertical radiator had a heavily finned <b>header</b> <b>tank.</b> Eventually these fins were echoed on a protective grille shell and, even later, on the rear licence plate holder.|$|E

50|$|This {{modification}} was successful, but it {{was noted}} that the engine hoods were a potential constraint. All further DSC class locomotives equipped with the refuges had their engine hoods shortened by 500mm, necessitating the relocation of the radiator <b>header</b> <b>tanks</b> to their present 'east-west' alignment.|$|R

2500|$|The {{engine oil}} tanks {{were in the}} engine nacelles. Each nacelle {{contained}} a [...] oil tank, including a [...] air space. The oil tanks themselves had no separate coolant controlling systems. The coolant <b>header</b> <b>tank</b> was in the forward nacelle, behind the propeller. The remaining coolant systems were controlled by the coolant radiators shutters in the forward inner wing compartment, between the nacelle and the fuselage and behind the main engine cooling radiators, which were fitted in the leading edge. Electric-pneumatic operated radiator shutters directed and controlled airflow through the ducts and into the coolant valves, to predetermined temperatures.|$|E
2500|$|A voltage {{regulator}} under a black, cylindrical cover was mounted {{low on the}} back of frame 11, directly behind the pilot's seat:starting in the N30xx series this was repositioned higher, appearing low in the rear transparency. From N32xx the regulator was mounted directly behind the pilot's headrest on frame 11. Other changes were made later in 1939 when a simplified design of pitot tube was introduced and the [...] "rod" [...] aerial mast was replaced by a streamlined, tapered design. To improve protection for the pilot and fuel tanks a thick laminated glass bulletproof plate was fitted to the curved, one piece windscreen and a 3mm thick cover of light alloy, capable of deflecting small calibre rounds, was fitted {{over the top of the}} two fuel tanks. From about mid-1940, 73 pounds (33kg) of armoured steel plating was provided in the form of head and back protection on the seat bulkhead and covering the forward face of the glycol <b>header</b> <b>tank.</b> In addition, the lower petrol tank was fitted with a fire-resistant covering called [...] "Linatex", which was later replaced with a layer of self-sealing rubber.|$|E

50|$|The {{process was}} spread {{out from the}} late 1970s into the early 1980s. As part of this, some {{locomotives}} were repainted in the International Orange livery but with their pre-TMS numbers instead of the later TMS numbers. As a result of this, the locomotives were equipped with new radiator <b>header</b> <b>tanks</b> which were mounted behind the radiator {{on top of the}} engine hoods in a 'north-south' alignment. Later the tanks were relocated to an 'east-west' alignment.|$|R

5000|$|Automobile {{radiators}} {{are constructed}} {{of a pair}} of <b>header</b> <b>tanks,</b> linked by a core with many narrow passageways, giving a high surface area relative to volume. This core is usually made of stacked layers of metal sheet, pressed to form channels and soldered or brazed together. For many years radiators were made from brass or copper cores soldered to brass headers. Modern radiators have aluminum cores, and often save money and weight by using plastic headers. This construction is more prone to failure and less easily repaired than traditional materials.|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} of campylobacters in broiler chickens {{and throughout the}} broiler water delivery systems of 12 farms in northeastern Scotland was investigated by sensitive enrichment methods and large-volume filtration. Campylobacter presence was independent of the water source and whether the water was treated. The genotypes of Campylobacter jejuni isolates recovered from chickens and various locations within the water delivery systems were compared by multilocus sequence typing. Matching strains in shed <b>header</b> <b>tanks</b> and birds were found at 1 of the 12 farms investigated. However, the sequence of contamination or whether the source was within or outside the shed was not determined. Nevertheless, these data provide evidence that drinking water could be associated with broiler infection by campylobacters...|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the largest}} landplanes of its time, it was a large, {{twin-engine}} four-bay staggered biplane with a box-like fuselage, and a three-rudder, biplane tail. The pilot and navigator sat in open cockpits atop the nose, while the 25 troops it was to carry entered through a hatch in the floor and sat in two rows of [...] "bus"-style seats with a centre aisle. It was of composite construction, with a tubular-steel-framed fuselage and wooden wings incorporating substantial hinges {{to allow them to}} be folded for storage. The Napier Lion engines were supported on tubular-steel supports between the wings and housed in streamlined cowlings with retractable radiators on the underside. The three cylindrical main petrol tanks were slung under the floor in an aluminium fairing, and fed fuel via windmill-driven pumps to <b>header</b> <b>tanks</b> {{on the underside of the}} upper wing.|$|R
50|$|Vitruvius {{described}} the many innovations made in building design {{to improve the}} living conditions of the inhabitants. Foremost {{among them is the}} development of the hypocaust, a type of central heating where hot air developed by a fire was channelled under the floor and inside the walls of public baths and villas. He gave explicit instructions on how to design such buildings so fuel efficiency is maximized; for example, the caldarium is next to the tepidarium followed by the frigidarium. He also advised using a type of regulator to control the heat in the hot rooms, a bronze disc set into the roof under a circular aperture, which could be raised or lowered by a pulley to adjust the ventilation. Although he did not suggest it himself, his dewatering devices such as the reverse overshot water-wheel likely were used in the larger baths to lift water to <b>header</b> <b>tanks</b> {{at the top of the}} larger thermae, such as the Baths of Diocletian and the Baths of Caracalla.|$|R

40|$|In Australia {{rainwater}} {{tanks are}} used in cities to reduce demand of mains water and increase the resilience of cities to drought. Rainwater is collected in a tank and supplied to a dwelling through a small pump. Typically the energy footprint for rainwater supply (in kWh/kL) is higher than for centralised water supply, {{but it can also}} vary markedly from dwelling to dwelling (0. 4 - 11 kWh/kL). This study aimed to understand how the design of the rainwater supply system from the collection tank to the household can reduce the energy consumption of pumping. We examined the operation of a range of system components for rainwater supply, such as pumps, switches and pressure vessels, in a controlled residential environment (a model house) to understand their impact on the energy required for rainwater supply in urban dwellings. Results show that urban rainwater applications have flow and volume requirements which cause pumps to operate at high energy for rainwater delivery. Matching pump sizes to end use requirements and adoption of ancillary devices (pressure vessels and <b>header</b> <b>tanks)</b> have the potential to lower the energy footprint for rainwater supply. However, the energy savings can be constrained by dwelling characteristics, appliances and system design. Â© IWA Publishing 2013...|$|R
50|$|The steam {{collected}} in the separators was vented separately from the liquid coolant. The steam did not require mechanical pumping to do this, and the buildup of pressure inside the separator was sufficient. The steam was piped down the lower {{right side of the}} engine bay and led into the open spaces between the upper and lower wing skins of the outer wing panels. There, it further expanded and condensed by cooling through the skins. The entire outer wing, both ahead of and behind the main spar, was used for this purpose covering that portion of the span containing the ailerons (the fuel was also carried entirely in the wings and occupied the areas behind the main spar in the center section and immediately ahead of the outboard flaps). The condensate was scavenged by electrically-driven centrifugal pumps and fed to the <b>header</b> <b>tanks.</b> Sources indicate as many as 22 separate pumps were used for this, each with their own attendant pilot light on the instrument panel, {{but it is not clear}} whether that number includes all of the pumps in the entire water- and oil-cooling systems or merely the number of pumps in the outer wing panels. The former is generally accepted.|$|R
50|$|Fuel is gravity fed {{from the}} main tanks to a <b>header</b> <b>tank</b> to supply the engine. Optional long range tanks in the wing tips have {{electric}} pumps to transfer fuel to the main tanks. Fuel can also be pumped {{from side to side}} to correct any lateral imbalance.|$|E

50|$|A 20th-century {{building}} of rendered breeze blocks with a zinc roof.

5000|$|Coolant {{exits the}} DB 601 at two points {{located at the}} front of the engine and at the base of each {{cylinder}} block casting immediately adjacent to the crank case. In the Heinkel system, an [...] "S"-shaped steel pipe took the coolant from each side of the engine to one of two steam separators mounted alongside the engine's reduction gear and immediately behind the propeller spinner. The separators, designed by engineers Jahn and Jahnke, accepted the water at about 110 C and [...] of pressure. The vertically mounted, tube-shaped separators contained a centrifugal impeller at the top connected to an impeller-type scavenge pump at the bottom. The coolant was expanded through the upper impeller where it lost pressure, boiled and cooled. The by-product was mostly very hot coolant and some steam. The liquid coolant was slung by the centrifugal impeller to the sides of the separator where it fell by gravity to the bottom of the unit. There, it was pumped to <b>header</b> <b>tanks</b> located in the leading edges of both wings by the scavenge pump. The presence of the scavenge pump was necessary to ensure the entire separator did not simply fill up with high-pressure coolant coming from the engine.|$|R
5000|$|Although soundly built, the {{locomotives}} were plagued initially by unreliability issues {{stemming from}} the Caterpillar D398 diesel engine which was overrated initially at 1050 hp, and unlikely to be reliable beyond 800-850 hp [...] the NZR, CME concluded the correct rating of the DJ 797 hp, and it suffered from overheating problems, turbocharger blow outs [...] unavailability and maintenance cost excesses,and as an advanced, untested experimental design and NZR management, viewed it poorly, compared with the well tested DAs, which were hardly more expensive at actual landed, 1967 costs of 175,000 final unit cost, cf with the DJ $130,000 after currency movement, and NZR {{did not want to}} reengine the DJ with new Caterpillars and actually gained Labour Government approval in 1973 to reengine the DJ class with 1200 Hp EE Paxman Ventura, diesels in 1975-78, this was not ultimately financed and the solution was to fit rectangular <b>header</b> <b>tanks</b> to the locomotives roofs above the radiator, down-rate the engines, and fit additional air intakes, nicknamed 'flyswatters' by enthusiasts due to their shape. These modifications, made in the late 1970s, made the DJ class more reasonably reliable. The greatest improvement offered by the DJ over the steam JA was in hillclimbing particularly on the Greymouth-Otira section and in moving heavy slow freight, but unlike the NI DA neither the DJ or earlier EE DG actually improved rail economics, cf with the 1950s JA.|$|R
5000|$|The PA-18 has {{developed}} a very dedicated following in the bush-flying community, and many modifications {{have been developed for}} it, {{to the point where it}} is quite rare to find an original, completely stock Super Cub. Modifications include extended baggage compartments (reaching farther back into the fuselage, or even two-level baggage compartments in the top and bottom of the rear fuselage), external luggage pods, fuel pods, lumber racks for carrying construction materials into unimproved bush runways. Also the removal of <b>header</b> <b>tanks,</b> larger 24 or even 30 gallon wing fuel tanks, extended main landing gear for better ground clearance of the propeller, strengthened tailwheel springs, the addition of a small third passenger seat in the luggage area and lightweight generators and starters. Also various different mount areas for the battery (to move the weight forward, and reduce tail weight to shorten takeoff distance), various different tailfin shapes to increase surface area, lengthened flaps, various wingtip designs, vortex generators on the leading edge of the wings, movement of the electrical panel from the right wing root to the dashboard to reduce fire hazard during a crash, and even the addition of a constant-speed propeller.Above all, the most common modification is the addition of [...] "bush wheels", large, soft, low pressure balloon-tires designed to absorb impacts from rocks and boulders, and to not sink into sand or other soft surfaces, ideal for off-runway landings.|$|R
