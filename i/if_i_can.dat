5|$|I {{will not}} {{disguise}} {{it in the}} least... the fact is, I most eagerly aspire after future eminence in literature, my whole soul burns most ardently after it, and every earthly thought centres in it... I am almost confident in believing, that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> ever rise in the world it must be by the exercise of my talents in the wide field of literature.|$|E
5|$|I hope I {{have not}} exaggerated {{in talking about}} Liszt; he won't make me {{anything}} wonderful, so that I can come home and set the Thames on fire—not at all, so don't expect it; but—his readings or interpretations are greater and higher than anyone else's; <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{spend some time with}} him and go through a good deal of music with him, I shall pick up at least a great deal of his ideas;... The two or three lessons I had of him this summer showed me what an immensity I might learn.|$|E
5|$|The first {{deceased}} {{artist to}} top the UK Albums Chart was Otis Redding, {{who died in}} a plane crash on 10 December 1967. On 20 May 1968, Redding's sixth studio album, The Dock of the Bay, was released in the UK – three weeks later, it became his first and only UK number-one album. Since Redding, 11 further artists have posthumously topped the albums chart, of which three have done so more than twice. The first of these was American singer Eva Cassidy; after dying in 1996, three posthumous releases from Cassidy reached number one in consecutive years, 2001–03. The second musician to achieve this feat was American entertainer Elvis Presley. Following his death from a heart attack in August 1977, Presley's compilation album 40 Greatest climbed to number one within three weeks. Subsequent compilations ELV1S (2002), The King (2007), <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>Can</b> Dream (2015) and The Wonder of You (2016) also topped the chart. With <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>Can</b> Dream, Presley achieved his fourth posthumous number one, more than any other artist.|$|E
60|$|MR. BARLOW. You won't disturb your mother? Don't disturb Eva {{if she is}} {{busy with}} your mother. (Exit WINIFRED.) <b>If</b> only <b>I</b> <b>can</b> see Winifred happy, my heart is at rest: <b>if</b> only <b>I</b> <b>can</b> hope {{for her to be}} happy in her life.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Ruth; I may be wrong, and <b>if</b> <b>I</b> am <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{only say}} {{beforehand}} that I am sorry; but I {{have an idea}} that you suspect, and have {{for a long time}} suspected, that George Forester murdered Miss Carne." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] she assented; [...] "but <b>if</b> <b>I</b> could--YOU <b>can</b> thick anywhere, Mrs. Brinkley--Mrs. Trevor's lovely {{house would}} inspire me to it." ...|$|R
5|$|I {{was just}} trying to make a point. I wanted to show people {{how easy it is to}} {{manipulate}} someone's voice. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.|$|E
25|$|L: Yes. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do {{anything}} for your physical safety, please call me.|$|E
25|$|I {{wanted to}} tell you something… and I think it's {{affected}} my whole life, and I don't know <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> tell it very well, but I've thought about it a lot of times.|$|E

6000|$|... "Farewell to London!" [...] Bruce exclaimed. [...] "Except as a {{prisoner}} I shall never see it again. The die is cast this time, Sir Archie, and for good; even <b>if</b> <b>I</b> would <b>I</b> <b>can</b> never draw back again. Comyn's treachery has made my action irrevocable--it is now indeed death or victory!" ...|$|R
25|$|L: Well, Mr. President, {{that is your}} decision, certainly. I cannot {{advise you}} {{one way or the}} other. But as I've said, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> ever be of any {{assistance}} in looking after your security, I would certainly do so.|$|E
25|$|My name is Sam Tyler. I had an {{accident}} and I woke up in 1973. Am I mad, in a coma, or back in time? Whatever's happened, it's like I've landed on a different planet. Now, maybe <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> work out the reason, I can get home.|$|E
25|$|In {{search of}} sanctuary, I have found {{my way to}} that country, the nobility of whose traditions, and whose ever-present charm, have already been as balm to my soul. I shall be glad and {{grateful}} <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> spend some few years of peace and repose in France and Paris, and still more grateful to be enabled to repay the hospitality accorded to me, by making available those abundant stores of knowledge acquired throughout my career.|$|E

25|$|Lodge: Well, {{you are a}} {{chief of}} state. I cannot give you advice, but personally, and as a friend, and as {{somebody}} who is concerned about your health, my suggestion would be you think seriously of getting away. Now, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> be of any help on that, I'm prepared to send my driver with an officer of mine to escort you to safety. And we can get you on my jet aircraft, and I'm sure I can deliver on that. One of my officers will ride {{in the front seat}} of my limousine with the chauffeur.|$|E
25|$|I find it {{very hard}} to say this truth. I am to blame for {{everything}} I did at that time. I am trying to erase all this and to be what I was not at that time. I am also to blame for what I did not do, for not trying to protect those prisoners. Regardless of the temporary nature of my then-post. I ask myself again and again, what could I have done that I didn't do? Thousands of innocent victims perished. Graves remain behind, refugees, destruction and misfortune and misery. I bear general part of the responsibility for this. There is misfortune on all sides that stays behind as a warning that this should never happen again. My testimony and admission of guilt will also remove blame from my nation because it is individual guilt, the guilt of a man named Dragan Obrenović. I stand by this. I am responsible for this. The guilt for which I feel remorse and for which I apologise to the victims and to their shadows. I will be happy if this contributed to reconciliation in Bosnia, if neighbours can again shake hands, if our children can again play games together, and if {{they have the right to}} a chance. I will be happy if my testimony helps the families of victims, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> spare them having to testify again and thus relive the horrors and the pain during their testimony. It is my wish that my testimony should help prevent this ever happening again, not just in Bosnia, but anywhere in the world. It is too late for me now, but for the children living in Bosnia now, it's not too late and I hope that this will be a good warning to them.|$|E
500|$|Later, {{when asked}} if she still wanted to have another child, Feng told The New York Times, [...] "That depends on how my body recovers. Yes, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> get my health back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now I must be going," [...] she said. [...] "I was slapped and pinched, last time, {{for being}} so long, but I have several things to get today, so that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> hurry <b>I</b> <b>can</b> be back again {{as soon as they}} expect me. You have not settled when you are going, yet?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall {{say what}} I like to my son, sir. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{cut him off}} with a {{shilling}} <b>if</b> <b>I</b> like. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> make him a beggar <b>if</b> <b>I</b> like. I WILL say what I like," [...] the elder said.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are welcome, then, {{to return}} to our hotel. I cannot promise to receive you as I did of old; you would despise me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> did. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> promise, however, to think no more of all that has passed between us, and yield up my own {{happiness}} for that of the daughter of my dear husband.|$|R
500|$|Addressing his finesse {{pitching}} style, Zito said, [...] "My fastball {{is set up}} by my offspeed, that's no secret. So <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> command my fastball to {{both sides}} of the plate and throw most of my offspeed for strikes, I'll get them to miss the barrel. That's what I'm going for." ...|$|E
500|$|After the stage, Matthews {{said that}} he felt he could win the overall general classification. He said, [...] "I think <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> survive Saturday , I can win. With the way I’ve been climbing, I think it’s possible." [...] Contador, meanwhile, said that the final climb of Stage 6 was not very steep and {{that it might be}} {{difficult}} to put significant time into Matthews.|$|E
500|$|On his {{approach}} to casting, Stallone {{said that he was}} looking for actors who had not experienced recent success in film: [...] "I like using people that had a moment and then maybe have fallen on some hard times and give them another shot. So we’re always looking for actors like Michael Biehn and Michael Paré. I like those kinds of guys. Someone did it for me and I like to see <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do it for them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You spared my {{life when}} you easily might have taken it," [...] he said after we had {{proceeded}} some little way in silence, [...] "and I would aid you <b>if</b> <b>I</b> might. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> help to make your life here more bearable, but your fate is inevitable. You may never hope {{to return to the}} outer world." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Matter enough," [...] grumbled Bumble the Bee. [...] "I've {{got to make}} a sack of honey, and as if that isn't enough, old Mother Nature {{has ordered}} me to carry a sack of gold from each flower I visit to the next flower <b>I</b> visit. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>I</b> <b>can</b> get no honey. Buzz-buzz-buzz," [...] grumbled Bumble the Bee.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why shouldn't I, just {{to punish}} you?" [...] she demanded. [...] "There are scores {{of men who}} fancy {{themselves}} in love with me. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> choose, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> keep them all their lives hanging to the hem of my skirt, praying for a word, a touch. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> make them furious one day and penitent the next--wretched always, perhaps, but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> keep them there. Why should I not treat your brother in the same way?" ...|$|R
500|$|I {{finally got}} tired of making movies where all I did was walk across the screen and look pretty. I got a big chance to do some real acting in The Postman Always Rings Twice, and I'm not going to slip back <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> help it. I tried to persuade the studio to give me {{something}} different. But every time I went into my argument about how bad a picture was, they'd say, [...] "well, it's making a fortune". That licked me.|$|E
500|$|In 1928, Loyola {{traveled}} to South Bend, Indiana to play Notre Dame in its season opener. The Wolves took a 6–0 halftime lead before they eventually fell, 12–6. After the game, Notre Dame head coach Knute Rockne reportedly said, [...] "Never get me another 'warm-up game' against a team coached by that guy." [...] The following year, Rockne {{was asked to}} name the best football coach and responded, [...] "Modesty forbids...But <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> name the two best football coaches in America, {{one of them is}} going to be Clark Shaughnessy." ...|$|E
500|$|Song said in 2005, [...] "Besides Hollywood grand-openings and award shows, I try to {{stay away}} from the parties. It's so easy to be swept away from that whole scene because it's {{expected}} of you. I've never drank or smoked in my entire life, but I've seen 15-year-olds drinking and smoking and I just think that's gross." [...] On being a young role model to kids, Song said: [...] "Oh goodness, I hope I can set a good example. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do it, anyone can. I'm living my dream every single day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... '"Jove!" [...] {{he began}} abruptly, [...] "there {{are days when}} a fellow is too absurd for anything; only <b>I</b> know <b>I</b> <b>can</b> tell you what I like. I talk about being done with it--with the bally thing {{at the back of}} my head [...] . Forgetting [...] . Hang me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> know! <b>I</b> <b>can</b> think of it quietly.

6000|$|... "I have {{no right}} to do so, and would not <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{understand}} your feelings of deep gratitude and can respect them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Am I to {{understand}} it is your intention to allow board-school games under your study windows, Flint? <b>If</b> so, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> only say--" [...] He said much, and Flint listened politely.|$|R
