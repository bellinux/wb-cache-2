5000|$|The Savage system {{employed}} {{the theory that}} the rifling in the barrel caused a rotational force that would hold the <b>gun</b> <b>locked</b> until the projectile left the barrel.

5000|$|Leaving {{a firearm}} {{within reach of}} a child under 14 is {{generally}} a misdemeanor if that child points it at anyone, harms anyone, or shows it to anyone in a public place.

During some high-altitude bombings the radar-guided <b>guns</b> <b>locked</b> onto the falling 1,000-lb bombs and, it is claimed, destroyed them on at least three occasions.

50|$|Conversely, Engel has {{received}} a 100 percent rating from the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. He has also been given a 100 percent grade from the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. Engel repeatedly votes in favor of stricter gun control laws. He introduced H.R. 1784, the Protect Law Enforcement Armor (PLEA) Act, which would ban the Five-seveN handguns. Engel introduced H.R. 2217, intended to protect parents and children from faulty <b>gun</b> <b>locks</b> by instructing the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to set a national quality standard for all child safety devices used on firearms.|$|R
50|$|In the {{wireless}} tube the lock {{of the gun}} makes the electric contact with an insulated disc in {{the head of the}} tube. This disc is connected by an insulated wire to a brass cone, also insulated, the bridge being formed from an edge of the cone to a brass wire which is soldered to the mouth of the tube. Priming composition surrounds the bridge and the tube is filled with powder. The electric circuit passes from the <b>gun</b> <b>lock</b> to the disc, then through the bridge to the body of the tube, returning through the metal of the gun and mounting.|$|E

The department has auxiliary policing and neighborhood watch programs available to citizens ages 21 and over. The police department offers programs such as <b>gun</b> <b>lock</b> giveaways, house watch programs, and programs to put a child up for adoption in case the parent is not capable of raising the child.|$|E
5000|$|A gun safe is {{a secure}} and {{protective}} storage container {{for one or}} more firearms, and, or ammunition for those guns. Gun safes are primarily used to prevent access to unauthorized or unqualified persons, for burglary protection, and, in more capable safes, to protect the contents from damage during a flood, fire, or natural disaster. Access prevention is required by law in many places, necessitating a <b>gun</b> <b>lock,</b> metal gun cabinet, or gun safe. Gun safes have largely replaced the gun cabinets made of fine stained wood with etched glass fronts used for display that were commonly used decades ago, although some gun safes are made to resemble such gun cabinets.|$|E

50|$|Herbert Schmidt {{had been}} {{providing}} many manufacturers and gun exporters with parts and guns, {{so that it}} is difficult to list all of them or research the whole production range. It seems that Schmidt had produced single-action revolvers since the early 1920s and exported them to the United States. All parts of the guns were handmade and out of steel, except for the frames, which were out of a zinc-aluminium alloy. They were sold in the US as low-priced revolvers, but were overproof, which is typically German. Their quality is astonishingly good, and these revolvers lasted for a long time, even when used a lot. A characteristic feature of Herbert Schmidt's single-action revolvers is the integrated firing pin and the cutaway hammer that allows dry firing without any gun damage. This construction later led to the modern <b>gun</b> <b>lock</b> safety system, though this was first made by Arminius rather than by Herbert Schmidt.|$|E
50|$|The town {{grew in the}} 19th century {{around the}} nut, bolt and <b>gun</b> <b>lock</b> {{manufacturing}} and coal mining industries. It was highly industrialised {{with a population of}} 6,000 in 1841. Large areas of land were owned by the Birmingham Coal Company and the area was accessed by the Birmingham Canal Navigations and Grand Junction Railway. In December 1839, the rector of the parish reported that there were approximately 1,500 homes in the parish of Darlaston, most of which were in poor condition and owned by working-class people. The Rose family were identified as a wealthy family in the area during the 19th century as a result of Richard Rose's acquisitions of unenclosed land. Upon his death in 1870, his estate was valued at over £877. He bequeathed the land to his wife Hannah. His brother was identified as James Rose in an 1871 census and was listed as a latch, bolt and nut maker, employing 39 people, including 19 children. At the time of the 1881 census, James Rose was 55 and his business had expanded to employ 90 people. James Rose died in 1901. Construction of Darlaston Town Hall commenced on 21 June 1887 and it was completed in 1888.|$|E
40|$|This report {{provides}} {{a series of}} proposals that state legislators should enact in their states to help protect children from improperly stored firearms. These proposals include: Requiring adults to keep guns properly locked up or under their immediate control, whenever they {{have a reason to}} know a child is present or might have access to the area; Requiring gun dealers to ensure that all gun buyers, including buyers of rifles or shotguns, are provided with a <b>gun</b> <b>lock</b> or other safety device; Ensuring that appropriate safety information accompanies the sale or transfer of every gun by a licensed gun dealer; Prohibiting adults from allowing children to handle machine guns, even if they are supervised, due to the unusually dangerous nature of these weapons. This report {{provides a}}rguments in support of these proposals, along with the legal and factual background for each proposal. It also provides a list of the features that make up a strong law on each topic. Too many families have needlessly suffered the horrific loss of a child due to an unsecured gun. It is our hope that this report will provide a "toolkit" for legislators and advocates who want to move forward to help prevent unintended gun deaths of children...|$|E

He has been responsible for the disclosure of such security defects as the bypass of tubular locks with ball point pens, the insecurity of <b>gun</b> <b>locks</b> that are relied upon to protect children, many popular consumer security devices, lock bumping in the United States, and most recently the security flaws {{in one of the most}} recognized high-security locks in the United States.|$|R

5000|$|The Wichita Massacre, {{also known}} as the Wichita Horror, was a spree of random robberies, assaults, rapes, and murders perpetrated from December 7 to 14, 2000 by {{brothers}} Reginald and Jonathan Carr against several people in the city of Wichita, Kansas. In this period, the Carrs killed five people and a dog in the course of robberies and assaults, robbed another man, and severely wounded a woman. The crimes shocked Wichitans, and incited a boom in sales of <b>guns,</b> <b>locks,</b> and home security systems. [...] The brothers were tried and convicted on multiple counts, including for kidnapping, robbery, rape, four counts of capital murder, and one count of first-degree murder. They were both sentenced to death in October 2002.|$|R
