40|$|This study aims to {{evaluate}} the in vitro angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition activity of different extracts of Orthosiphon stamineus (OS) leaves and their main flavonoids, namely rosmarinic acid (RA), sinensetin (SIN), eupatorin (EUP) and 3 ′-hydroxy- 5, 6, 7, 4 ′-tetramethoxyflavone (TMF). Furthermore, to identify possible mechanisms of action based on structure–activity relationships and molecular docking. The in vitro ACE inhibition activity relied on determining hippuric acid (HA) formation from ACE-specific substrate (hippuryl-histidyl-leucine (HHL)) {{by the action of}} ACE enzyme. A High Performance Liquid Chromatography method combined with UV detection was developed and validated for measurement the concentration of produced HA. The chelation ability of OS extract and its reference compounds was evaluated by tetramethylmurexide reagent. Furthermore, molecular docking study was performed by LeadIT-FlexX: BioSolveIT’s LeadIT program. OS ethanolic extract (OS-E) exhibited highest inhibition and lowest IC 50 value (45. 77 ± 1. 17 µg/mL) against ACE compared to the other extracts. Among the tested reference compounds, EUP with IC 50 15. 35 ± 4. 49 µg/mL had highest inhibition against ACE and binding ability with Zn (II) (56. 03 % ± 1. 26 %) compared to RA, TMF and SIN. Molecular docking studies also confirmed that flavonoids inhibit ACE via interaction with the zinc ion and this interaction is stabilized by other interactions with amino acids in the active site. In this study, we have demonstrated that changes in <b>flavonoids</b> <b>active</b> core affect their capacity to inhibit ACE. Moreover, we showed that ACE inhibition activity of flavonoids compounds is directly related to their ability to bind with zinc ion in the active site of ACE enzyme. It was also revealed that OS extract contained high amount of flavonoids other than RA, TMF, SIN and EUP. As such, application of OS extract is useful as inhibitors of ACE...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{we tested}} eight naturally-occurring flavonoids—three flavanones and five flavones—for their {{possible}} antibacterial properties against four Gram-positive and four Gram-negative bacteria. Flavonoids {{are known for}} their antimicrobial properties, and due their structural diversity; these plant-derived compounds are a good model to study potential novel antibacterial mechanisms. The lipophilicity and the interaction of antibacterial compounds with the cell membrane define the success or failure to access its target. Therefore, through the determination of partition coefficients in a non-polar/aqueous phase, lipophilicity estimation and the quantification of the antibacterial activity of different flavonoids, flavanones, and flavones, a relationship between these parameters was assessed. <b>Active</b> <b>flavonoids</b> presented diffusion coefficients between 9. 4 × 10 − 10 and 12. 3 × 10 − 10 m 2 /s and lipophilicity range between 2. 0 to 3. 3. <b>Active</b> <b>flavonoids</b> against Gram-negative bacteria showed a narrower range of lipophilicity values, compared to <b>active</b> <b>flavonoids</b> against Gram-positive bacteria, which showed a wide range of lipophilicity and cell lysis. Galangin was the most <b>active</b> <b>flavonoid,</b> whose structural features are the presence of two hydroxyl groups located strategically on ring A and the absence of polar groups on ring B. Methylation of one hydroxyl group decreases the activity in 3 -O-methylgalangin, and methylation of both hydroxyl groups caused inactivation, as shown for 3, 7 -O-dimethylgalangin.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Intercropping of {{vegetables}} and medicinal plants might produce favorable interactions for both crops, resulting in increased production and profit per unit area. It is known that active compounds can change because of several factors, including the cropping system. Therefore, {{the goal of this}} study was to evaluate the effect of intercropping of lettuce and marigold on the productivity of these crops and on the flavonoid content of marigold flowers. The experiment was conducted in the experimental area of EPAMIG in Oratorios-MG. Treatments consisted of lettuce + marigolds intercropping between rows, lettuce + marigold intercropping between plants, and monocultures of each species. Spacing was 0. 3 x 0. 3 m. The experimental design consisted of randomized blocks with ten repetitions. Harvest of lettuce and marigold flowers started 45 days after transplantation (DAT) and extended up to 72 DAT for marigolds. Lettuce and marigold intercropping appears feasible because lettuce production did not differ between the monoculture and intercropped cultivations, and marigold productivity was higher when intercropped with lettuce.

This SFC method was validated and applied to the analysis of five flavonoids (kaempferol, luteolin, quercetin, luteoloside, buddleoside) present in Chrysanthemum morifolium Ramat. from different cultivars (Chuju, Gongju, Hangju, Boju). The results indicated a good repeatability and sensitivity for the quantification of the five analytes with RSDs for overall precision lower than 3 %. The limits of detection ranged from 0. 73 to 2. 34 μg/mL, while the limits of quantification were between 2. 19 and 5. 86 μg/mL. The method showed that SFC could be employed as a useful tool for the quality assessment of Traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) containing <b>flavonoids</b> as <b>active</b> components.

40|$|Objectives. To {{evaluate}} the in vitro leishmanicidal activity of nine flavonoid derivatives from Delphinium staphisagria against L. infantum and L. braziliensis. Design and Methods. The in vitro activity of compounds 1 – 9 was assayed on extracellular promastigote and axenic amastigote forms and on intracellular amastigote {{forms of the}} parasites. Infectivity and cytotoxicity tests were carried on J 774. 2 macrophage cells using Glucantime as the reference drug. The mechanisms of action were analysed performing metabolite excretion and transmission electronic microscope ultrastructural alteration studies. Results. Nine flavonoids showed leishmanicidal activity against promastigote as well as amastigote forms of Leishmania infantum and L. braziliensis. These compounds were nontoxic to mammalian cells and were effective at similar concentrations up to or {{lower than that of}} the reference drug (Glucantime). The results showed that 2 ″-acetylpetiolaroside (compound 8) was clearly the most active. Conclusion. This study has demonstrated that <b>flavonoid</b> derivatives are <b>active</b> against L. infantum and L. braziliensis...|$|R
40|$|Andrographis paniculata (Burm. f.) Ness {{is one of}} {{the native}} tradisional {{medicine}} in Indonesia which contain <b>active</b> <b>flavonoid.</b> It has potential activity as antioxidant, antibacterial, and inflammation. Antioxidant sensitive to light and heat. Flavonoid antioxidant activity could be decline by heat and oxidation. We can find these caution while evaporate the liquid solvent with heating in conventional evaporation to get dry extract. One of the conventional evaporation instrument is Rotary Evaporator. Other evaporation system, lyophillization is alternative to evaporate solvent without heat. This system uses instrument called Freeze Dryer. Present study about antioxidant activity influenced by two different evaporation using IC 50 determination in DPPH oxidation proved that evaporation difference could change antioxidant ability. The result shows freeze dryer evaporation result with 17. 06 % of extract yield and 585. 730 µg/mL IC 50 value better than rotary evaporator with 24. 96 % of extract yield and 792. 196 µg/mL IC 50 value in solvent evaporate ability and antioxidant activity...|$|R
40|$|Excessive {{cholesterol}} and fatty acids {{in the diet}} can lead to cardiovascular disease. Recent studies have reported that elevated Angiopoietin-Like Protein 3 (ANGPTL 3) expression contributes to dyslipidemia. The aim {{of the study was}} to examine the beneficial effect of icariin, an <b>active</b> <b>flavonoid</b> glucoside, on meat quality in swines and the mechanisms involved. About 36 Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire swines with an initial average body weight 65 kg were randomly divided into 3 groups: control swines group, two groups of icariin-treated swines (0. 1 or 0. 3 %). About 42 days after, icariin (0. 1 or 0. 3 %) treatment significantly decreased fat meat percentage, drip loss rate, plasma and hepatic total cholesterol levels, plasma and hepatic triglyceride concentrations, expression of ANGPTL 3 mRNA and increased meat color, lean meat percentage, plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, activity of Lipoprotein Lipase (LPL). The present results suggest that icariin changes ANGPTL 3 expression and LPL activity to improve meat quality in swine...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the {{antimicrobial}} activity of two ethanolic extracts of propolis (EEPs) and selected flavonoids against 16 Campylobacter jejuni clinical isolates and several Gram-positive and Gram-negative human pathogens. The antimicrobial activity of EEPs and flavonoids was evaluated by the agar well diffusion method. The EEPs inhibited the growth of C. jejuni, Enterobacter faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus. The most <b>active</b> <b>flavonoid</b> was galangin, with the highest percentage of sensitivity among C. jejuni strains (68. 8 %); lower percentages of sensitivity were observed for quercetin (50 %). The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of EEPs and flavonoids for C. jejuni isolates were determined by the agar dilution method. EEPs showed MIC values of 0. 3125 – 0. 156 mg=mL for all C. jejuni strains; galangin and quercetin gave MICs ranging from 0. 250 to 0. 125 mg=mL. Thus propolis preparations could be used as support to traditional therapy for Campylobacter infection, especially when the antibiotic agents show no activity against this microorganism...|$|R
