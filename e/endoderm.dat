5|$|During {{embryogenesis}} the ear develops {{as three}} distinct structures: the inner ear, {{the middle ear}} and the outer ear. Each structure originates from a different germ layer: the ectoderm, <b>endoderm</b> and mesenchyme.|$|E
5|$|Most {{anthozoans}} are unisexual {{but some}} stony corals are hermaphrodite. The germ cells {{originate in the}} <b>endoderm</b> {{and move to the}} gastrodermis where they differentiate. When mature, they are liberated into the coelenteron and thence to the open sea, with fertilisation being external. To make fertilisation more likely, corals emit vast numbers of gametes, and many species synchronise their release in relation to the time of day and the phase of the moon.|$|E
5|$|After implantation, {{around the}} second to third week the {{developing}} embryo consists of three layers: <b>endoderm,</b> mesoderm and ectoderm. The {{first part of the}} ear to develop is the inner ear, which begins to form from the ectoderm around the 22nd day of the embryo’s development. Specifically, the inner ear derives from two thickenings called otic placodes {{on either side of the}} head. Each otic placode recedes below the ectoderm, forms an otic pit and then an otic vesicle. This entire mass will eventually become surrounded by mesenchyme to form the bony labyrinth.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the third}} week of development, the embryo is a three-layered disc, covered with ectoderm, {{mesoderm}} and <b>endoderm.</b> A tube-like formation develops in the midline, called the notochord. The notochord releases extracellular molecules that affect the transformation of the overlying ectoderm into nervous tissue. The neural tube, forming from the ectoderm, contains CSF prior {{to the development of the}} choroid plexuses. The open neuropores of the neural tube close after the first month of development, and CSF pressure gradually increases.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{structures}} of the inner and middle ear, which develop from pharyngeal pouches, the ear canal originates from the dorsal portion of the first pharyngeal cleft. It is fully expanded {{by the end of}} the 18th week of development. The eardrum is made up of three layers (ectoderm, <b>endoderm</b> and connective tissue). The pinna originates as a fusion of six hillocks. The first three hillocks are derived from the lower part of the first pharyngeal arch and form the tragus, crus of the helix, and helix, respectively. The final three hillocks are derived from the upper part of the second pharyngeal arch and form the antihelix, antitragus, and earlobe. The outer ears develop in the lower neck. As the mandible forms they move towards their final position level with the eyes.|$|E
5|$|All {{vertebrates}} have {{a similar}} basic body plan {{and at some point}} in their lives, mostly in the embryonic stage, share the major chordate characteristics; a stiffening rod, the notochord; a dorsal hollow tube of nervous material, the neural tube; pharyngeal arches; and a tail posterior to the anus. The spinal cord is protected by the vertebral column and is above the notochord and the gastrointestinal tract is below it. Nervous tissue is derived from the ectoderm, connective tissues are derived from mesoderm, and gut is derived from the <b>endoderm.</b> At the posterior end is a tail which continues the spinal cord and vertebrae but not the gut. The mouth is found at the anterior end of the animal, and the anus at the base of the tail. The defining characteristic of a vertebrate is the vertebral column, formed in the development of the segmented series of vertebrae. In most vertebrates the notochord becomes the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral discs. However, a few vertebrates, such as the sturgeon and the coelacanth retain the notochord into adulthood. Jawed vertebrates are typified by paired appendages, fins or legs, which may be secondarily lost. The limbs of vertebrates are considered to be homologous because the same underlying skeletal structure was inherited from their last common ancestor. This is one of the arguments put forward by Charles Darwin to support his theory of evolution.|$|E
5|$|In early human {{embryonic}} life, {{a series of}} five branchial arches and four branchial pouches form {{that give rise to}} the human face, neck, and surrounding structures. The pouches are numbered such that the first pouch is the closest {{to the top of the}} embryo's head and the fourth is the furthest from it. The parathyroid glands originate from the interaction of the <b>endoderm</b> of the third and fourth pouch and neural crest mesenchyme. The position of the glands reverses during embryological life. The pair of glands which is ultimately inferior develops from the third pouch with the thymus, whereas the pair of glands which is ultimately superior develops from the fourth pouch. During embryological development, the thymus migrates downwards, dragging the inferior glands with it. The superior pair are not dragged downwards by the fourth pouch to the same degree. The glands are named after their final, not embryological, positions. Since the thymus's ultimate destination is in the mediastinum of the chest, it is occasionally possible to have ectopic parathyroids derived from the third pouch within the chest cavity if they fail to detach in the neck.|$|E
25|$|Nodal {{causes the}} {{transcription}} of mRNAs involved in {{left and right}} axis specification, mesoderm and <b>endoderm</b> induction.|$|E
25|$|During development, {{definitive}} <b>endoderm</b> and ectoderm differentiates {{into several}} gastrointestinal epithelial lineages, including endocrine cells. Many {{studies have indicated}} that Notch signaling has a major role in endocrine development.|$|E
25|$|The embryo {{undergoes}} well-characterized morphogenetic movements during gastrulation {{and early}} development, including germ-band extension, formation of several furrows, ventral invagination of the mesoderm, and posterior and anterior invagination of <b>endoderm</b> (gut), {{as well as}} extensive body segmentation until finally hatching from the surrounding cuticle into a first-instar larva.|$|E
25|$|There is {{initially}} a cloacal membrane, composed of ectoderm and <b>endoderm,</b> reaching from {{the umbilical cord}} to the tail, separating the cloaca from the exterior. After {{the separation of the}} rectum from the dorsal part of the cloaca, the ventral part of the cloacal membrane becomes the urogenital membrane.|$|E
25|$|Teratoma formation: iPSCs {{injected}} into immunodeficient mice spontaneously formed teratomas after nine weeks. Teratomas are tumors of multiple lineages containing tissue {{derived from the}} three germ layers <b>endoderm,</b> mesoderm and ectoderm; this is unlike other tumors, which typically are of only one cell type. Teratoma formation is a landmark test for pluripotency.|$|E
25|$|During {{the stage}} of neural plate {{formation}} the embryo consists of three cell layers: the ectoderm that eventually forms the skin and neural tissues, the mesoderm that forms muscle and bone, and the <b>endoderm</b> that will form the cells lining the digestive and respiratory tracts. The progenitor cells {{that make up the}} precursors to neural tissues in the neural plate are called neuroepithelial cells.|$|E
25|$|A zygote {{initially}} develops into {{a hollow}} sphere, called a blastula, which undergoes rearrangement and differentiation. In sponges, blastula larvae swim to a new location and develop into a new sponge. In most other groups, the blastula undergoes more complicated rearrangement. It first invaginates to form a gastrula with a digestive chamber, and two separate germ layers—an external ectoderm and an internal <b>endoderm.</b> In most cases, a mesoderm also develops between them. These germ layers then differentiate to form tissues and organs.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the other}} phyla, the Ctenophora and the Cnidaria, which {{includes}} sea anemones, corals, and jellyfish, are radially symmetric and have digestive chambers {{with a single}} opening, which serves as both the mouth and the anus. Both have distinct tissues, {{but they are not}} organized into organs. There are only two main germ layers, the ectoderm and <b>endoderm,</b> with only scattered cells between them. As such, these animals are sometimes called diploblastic. The tiny placozoans are similar, but {{they do not have a}} permanent digestive chamber.|$|E
25|$|The {{ectodermal}} dysplasia associated with EEC syndrome arises from abnormalities in the embryonic ectoderm, as described above. Very early in embryonic development, the {{embryonic stem cells}} differentiate into three types of cells: the ectoderm, mesoderm, and <b>endoderm.</b> It is from these three types of cells that all body organs originate. In general terms, ectodermal cells generate the skin, spinal cord, and teeth (as well as the numerous derivatives mentioned above). Mesodermal cells generate blood vessels, muscle and bone, and endodermal cells generate the lungs, the digestive system and the urinary system.|$|E
25|$|Deuterostomes {{differ from}} protostomes in several ways. Animals from both groups possess a {{complete}} digestive tract. However, in protostomes, the first {{opening of the}} gut to appear in embryological development (the archenteron) develops into the mouth, with the anus forming secondarily. In deuterostomes the anus forms first, with the mouth developing secondarily. In most protostomes, cells simply fill {{in the interior of}} the gastrula to form the mesoderm, called schizocoelous development, but in deuterostomes, it forms through invagination of the <b>endoderm,</b> called enterocoelic pouching. Deuterostome embryos undergo radial cleavage during cell division, while protostomes undergo spiral cleavage.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} to dissect the embryo at other stages so as to accordingly give rise to one lineage of cells from an embryo selectively and not the other. For example, subsets of blastomeres {{can be used to}} give rise to chimera with specified cell lineage from one embryo. The Inner Cell Mass of a diploid blastocyst for example {{can be used to make}} a chimera with another blastocyst of eight-cell diploid embryo; the cells taken from the inner cell mass will give rise to the primitive <b>endoderm</b> and to the epiblast in the chimera mouse.|$|E
25|$|Embryonic stem (ES) {{cells are}} {{the cells of}} the inner cell mass of a {{blastocyst}}, an early-stage embryo. Human embryos reach the blastocyst stage 4–5 days post fertilization, at which time they consist of 50–150 cells. ES cells are pluripotent and give rise during development to all derivatives of the three primary germ layers: ectoderm, <b>endoderm</b> and mesoderm. In other words, they can develop into each of the more than 200 cell types of the adult body when given sufficient and necessary stimulation for a specific cell type. They do not contribute to the extra-embryonic membranes or the placenta.|$|E
25|$|From this knowledge, ES cell {{contributions}} to chimeras have been developed. ES cells {{can be used}} in combination with eight-cell-and two-cell-stage embryos to make chimeras and exclusively give rise to the embryo proper. Embryos that are to be used in chimeras can further be genetically altered in order to specifically contribute to only one part of chimera. An example is the chimera built off of ES cells and tetraploid embryos, tetraploid embryos which are artificially made by electrofusion of two two-cell diploid embryos. The tetraploid embryo will exclusively give rise to the trophectoderm and primitive <b>endoderm</b> in the chimera.|$|E
25|$|Stem {{cells are}} {{undifferentiated}} biological cells that can differentiate into specialized cells and can divide (through mitosis) {{to produce more}} stem cells. They are found in multicellular organisms. In mammals, there are two broad types of stem cells: embryonic stem cells, which are isolated from the inner cell mass of blastocysts, and adult stem cells, which are found in various tissues. In adult organisms, stem cells and progenitor cells act as a repair system for the body, replenishing adult tissues. In a developing embryo, stem cells can differentiate into all the specialized cells—ectoderm, <b>endoderm</b> and mesoderm (see induced pluripotent stem cells)—but also maintain the normal turnover of regenerative organs, such as blood, skin, or intestinal tissues.|$|E
25|$|The ovary is {{differentiated}} into {{a central}} part, the medulla of ovary, {{covered by a}} surface layer, the germinal epithelium. The immature ova originate from cells from the dorsal <b>endoderm</b> of the yolk sac. Once they have reached the gonadal ridge they are called oogonia. Development proceeds and the oogonia become fully surrounded by a layer of connective tissue cells (pre-granulosa cells) In this way, the rudiments of the ovarian follicles are formed. The embryological origin of granulosa cells, on the other hand, remains controversial. Just as in the male, there is a gubernaculum in the female, which pulls it downward, albeit {{not as much as}} in males. The gubernaculum later becomes the proper ovarian ligament and the round ligament of the uterus.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fourth}} week a {{swelling}} appears {{from the second}} pharyngeal arch, in the midline, called the copula. During the fifth and sixth weeks the copula is overgrown by a swelling from {{the third and fourth}} arches (mainly from the third arch) called the hypopharyngeal eminence, and this develops into the posterior part of the tongue (the other third). The hypopharyngeal eminence develops mainly by the growth of <b>endoderm</b> from the third pharyngeal arch. The boundary between the two parts of the tongue, the anterior from the first arch and the posterior from the third arch is marked by the terminal sulcus. The terminal sulcus is shaped like a V with the tip of the V situated posteriorly. At the tip of the terminal sulcus is the foramen caecum, which is the point where the embryological thyroid begins to descend.|$|E
25|$|The proneural genes {{also have}} an {{important}} role in the development of distinct types of sensory organs, namely chordotonal organs (proprioceptorsthat detect mechanical and sound vibrations) and external sensory organs. Members of achaete-scute complex, such as achaete and scute, as well as ‘’atonal’’ and ‘’daughterless’’ confer to ectodermal cells the ability to become sensory mother cells (SMCs). In the development of sensory organs there are two main phases: determination and differentiation that may not be mechanistically separable. Proneural proteins are involved in both processes, through the activation of the downstream “differentiating genes” that in turn regulate the induction of sensory-organ-subtype characteristics. The specification of sensory organs by proneural genes is a complex process, since they elicit different cellular contexts. For instance, in Drosophila, atonal (ato) can promote the development of chordotonal organs, for the receptors of olfactory sense organs, depending on the imaginal disc in which it is expressed. In Drosophila’s embryogenesis, the proneural gene achaete is expressed in well-determined regions as in the <b>endoderm,</b> being responsible for the formation of particular sensory organs in the adult and larvae. According to Ruíz-Gomes and Ghysen (1993), this expression occurs in two distinct phases: a competent state, in which the proneural gene is expressed in a cell cluster; a determined state, in which a specific cell accumulate high levels of ‘’ac’’ transcripts, originating a neural precursor. The function of each of the ASC complex genes varies with the development state (larvae or adult). For example, in the adult state the ac and sc genes promote the differentiation of two sets of complementary sensory organs and ase gene as a minimal function, while in the larvae state ac and sc genes affect the same set of sensory organs and ase is responsible for the determination of a complementary set.|$|E
500|$|Unlike plant cells, animal {{cells have}} neither a cell wall nor chloroplasts. Vacuoles, when present, are more {{in number and}} much smaller {{than those in the}} plant cell. The body tissues are {{composed}} of numerous types of cell, including those found in muscles, nerves and skin. Each typically has a cell membrane formed of phospholipids, cytoplasm and a nucleus. [...] All of the different cells of an animal are derived from the embryonic germ layers. Those simpler invertebrates which are formed from two germ layers of ectoderm and <b>endoderm</b> are called diploblastic and the more developed animals whose structures and organs are formed from three germ layers are called triploblastic. All of a triploblastic animal's tissues and organs are derived from the three germ layers of the embryo, the ectoderm, mesoderm and <b>endoderm.</b>|$|E
500|$|Platyhelminthes are bilaterally {{symmetrical}} animals: {{their left}} and right sides are mirror images of each other; this also implies they have distinct {{top and bottom surfaces}} and distinct head and tail ends. Like other bilaterians, they have three main cell layers (<b>endoderm,</b> mesoderm, and ectoderm), while the radially symmetrical cnidarians and ctenophores (comb jellies) have only two cell layers. Beyond that, they are [...] "defined more by what they do not have than by any particular series of specializations." [...] Unlike other bilaterians, Platyhelminthes have no internal body cavity, so are described as acoelomates. They also lack specialized circulatory and respiratory organs, both of these facts are defining features when classifying a flatworm's anatomy. Their bodies are soft and unsegmented.|$|E
2500|$|More than 99% {{of primary}} lung cancers are carcinoma, which are tumors {{composed}} of cells that originate from embryonic ectoderm or <b>endoderm,</b> or that feature epithelial characteristics or differentiation. Eight major groups of lung carcinomas are recognized in WHO-2004: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{ability to}} make mouse chimeras comes from an {{understanding}} of early mouse development. Between the stages of fertilization of the egg and the implantation of a blastocyst into the uterus, {{different parts of the}} mouse embryo retain the ability to give rise to a variety of cell lineages. Once the embryo has reached the blastocyst stage, it is composed of several parts, mainly the trophectoderm, the inner cell mass, and the primitive <b>endoderm.</b> Each of these parts of the blastocyst gives rise to different parts of the embryo; the inner cell mass gives rise to the embryo proper, while the trophectoderm and primitive <b>endoderm</b> give rise to extra embryonic structures that support growth of the embryo. Two- to eight-cell-stage embryos are competent for making chimeras, since at these stages of development, the cells in the embryos are not yet committed to give rise to any particular cell lineage, and could give rise to the inner cell mass or the trophectoderm. [...] In the case where two diploid eight-cell-stage embryos are used to make a chimera, chimerism can be later found in the epiblast, primitive, <b>endoderm</b> and trophectoderm of the mouse blastocyst.|$|E
2500|$|The {{development}} {{of the nervous system}} in radiata is relatively unstructured. [...] Unlike bilaterians, radiata only have two primordial cell layers, <b>endoderm</b> and ectoderm. [...] Neurons are generated from a special set of ectodermal precursor cells, which also serve as precursors for every other ectodermal cell type.|$|E
2500|$|Approximately 99% of lung cancers are carcinoma, a {{term that}} {{indicates}} that the malignant neoplasm is composed of, or descended from, cells of epithelial lineage (i.e. derived from embryonic <b>endoderm,</b> {{as is the case}} in lung carcinomas, or from ectoderm), and/or that the malignant cells exhibit tissue architectural, cytological, or molecular features characteristically found in epithelial cells. Under WHO-2004, lung carcinomas are divided into 8 major taxa: ...|$|E
2500|$|All bilaterian {{animals at}} an early stage of {{development}} form a gastrula, which is polarized, with one end called the animal pole and the other the vegetal pole. [...] The gastrula has the shape of a disk with three layers of cells, an inner layer called the <b>endoderm,</b> which gives rise to the lining of most internal organs, a middle layer called the mesoderm, which gives rise to the bones and muscles, and an outer layer called the ectoderm, which gives rise to the skin and nervous system.|$|E
2500|$|Creating induced {{pluripotent}} {{stem cells}} ("iPSCs") is a long and inefficient process. Pluripotency refers to a stem cell that has the potential to differentiate into any of the three germ layers: <b>endoderm</b> (interior stomach lining, gastrointestinal tract, the lungs), mesoderm (muscle, bone, blood, urogenital), or ectoderm (epidermal tissues and nervous tissue). A specific set of genes, often called [...] "reprogramming factors", are introduced into a specific adult cell type. These factors send signals in the mature cell that cause the cell to become a pluripotent stem cell. This process is highly studied and new techniques are being discovered frequently on how to better this induction process.|$|E
2500|$|Discoveries {{in recent}} years have {{suggested}} that adult stem cells might have the ability to differentiate into cell types from different germ layers. For instance, neural stem cells from the brain, which are derived from ectoderm, can differentiate into ectoderm, mesoderm, and <b>endoderm.</b> Stem cells from the bone marrow, which is derived from mesoderm, can differentiate into liver, lung, GI tract and skin, which are derived from <b>endoderm</b> and mesoderm. This phenomenon is referred to as stem cell transdifferentiation or plasticity. It can be induced by modifying the growth medium when stem cells are cultured in vitro or transplanting them to an organ of the body different from the one they were originally isolated from. There is yet no consensus among biologists on the prevalence and physiological and therapeutic relevance of stem cell plasticity. More recent findings suggest that pluripotent stem cells may reside in blood and adult tissues in a dormant state. These cells are referred to as [...] "Blastomere Like Stem Cells" [...] (Am Surg. 2007 Nov;73:1106-10) and [...] "very small embryonic like" [...] – [...] "VSEL" [...] stem cells, and display pluripotency in vitro. As BLSC's and VSEL cells are present in virtually all adult tissues, including lung, brain, kidneys, muscles, and pancreas Co-purification of BLSC's and VSEL cells with other populations of adult stem cells may explain the apparent pluripotency of adult stem cell populations. However, recent studies have shown that both human and murine VSEL cells lack stem cell characteristics and are not pluripotent.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{debate as}} to which portion of the vagina is formed from the Müllerian ducts and which from the {{urogenital}} sinus by {{the growth of the}} sinovaginal bulb. Dewhurst's Textbook of Obstetrics and Gynaecology states, [...] "Some believe that the upper four-fifths of the vagina is formed by the Müllerian duct and the lower fifth by the urogenital sinus, while others believe that sinus upgrowth extends to the cervix displacing the Müllerian component completely and the vagina is thus derived wholly from the <b>endoderm</b> of the urogenital sinus." [...] It adds, [...] "It seems certain that some of the vagina is derived from the urogenital sinus, but it has not been determined whether or not the Müllerian component is involved." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{formation}} of the pancreas from <b>endoderm</b> begins in early development. The expression of elements of the Notch signaling pathway {{have been found in}} the developing pancreas, suggesting that Notch signaling is important in pancreatic development. Evidence suggests Notch signaling regulates the progressive recruitment of endocrine cell types from a common precursor, acting through two possible mechanisms. One is the [...] "lateral inhibition", which specifies some cells for a primary fate but others for a secondary fate among cells that have the potential to adopt the same fate. [...] Lateral inhibition is required for many types of cell fate determination. Here, it could explain the dispersed distribution of endocrine cells within pancreatic epithelium. A second mechanism is [...] "suppressive maintenance", which explains the role of Notch signaling in pancreas differentiation. Fibroblast growth factor10 is thought to be important in this activity, but the details are unclear.|$|E
2500|$|Although, SHH is most {{commonly}} associated with brain and limb digit development, it is also seen {{to be an important}} player in lung development. Studies using qPCR and knockouts have demonstrated that SHH contributes to embryonic lung development. The mammalian lung branching occurs in the epithelium of the developing bronchi and lungs. SHH expressed throughout the foregut <b>endoderm</b> (innermost of three germ layers) in the distal epithelium where the embryonic lungs are developing. This suggests that SHH is partially responsible for the branching of the lungs. Further evidence of SHH’s role in lung branching has been seen with qPCR. SHH expression occurs in the developing lungs around embryonic day 11 and is strongly expressed in the buds of the fetal lungs but low in the developing bronchi. Mice who are deficient in SHH can develop tracheoesophageal fistula (abnormal connection of the esophagus and trachea). Additionally, it a double (SHH-/- [...] ) knockout mouse model exhibited poor lung development. The lungs of the SHH double knockout failed to undergo lobation and branching (the abnormal lungs only developed one branch compared to an extensively branched phenotype of the wildtype).|$|E
