40|$|This paper, {{which is}} contextualised {{in terms of}} the broader history of the moving image, {{examines}} new media artist Lynette Wallworth's installation Duality of Light with respect to recent advances in neuroscientific research. These have led to greater understanding of how the brain processes visual imagery. Of greatest relevance to Wallworth's work is the discovery that the binding of the largely anatomically segregated attributes of colour, motion and faces occurs asynchronously and is subject to a temporal hierarchy. Moreover, such binding is post-conscious. Further to this, following <b>Gansing,</b> while simultaneously factoring in these recent neuroscientific advances, the idea of `interactivity' is challenged. The inadequacy of `interactive' as an undifferentiated descriptor, often uniformly applied to diverse new media works, is also highlighted. Works such as those created by Wallworth - whose work is informed intuitively by these recent neuroscientific findings - reveal the shortcomings of such homogenising terminology. Finally, this exploratory paper, which will form the basis of further work, demonstrates the interwoven nature of the aforementioned subject matter and thematic concerns...|$|R

A {{study from}} power {{relations}} {{in the world of}} blogs Author: Klara Sigfridsson Department for Media and Cultural Studies, Malmö Högskola Tutor: Kristoffer <b>Gansing</b> This is a report that aims to research upon Fairclough´s Critical discourse analysis to emphasise the power relationship between professional bloggers and former amateur bloggers at the fashion-entertainment web page Veckorevyn. com. Professional bloggers as they appear in the research object and their power within the Media seem to be a subject that is very relevant these days. This paper will look at different factors that make professional bloggers popular and as an example on their responsibility as a role model. However, amateur bloggers do have an importance in this discussion as they are more and more competing with the professionals. In addition, the identity perspective has an interplay with the critical discourse analysis discussion as it plays a large role in the genre that Veckoreyvn. com suits into. To make this research, the qualitative interviewing method has been used. These interviews and other litterature to the theoretical foundation have made this analysis as relevant as possible. The analysis is build on the critical discourse analysis and its three dimensional model and to turn the identity discussion in a relevant direction that Fairclough´s three dimensional model not can offer, Giddens identity perspective has been used. The results this report has given is that professional bloggers have a popularity within the blog world that leaves them with certain power instruments, in which they maximise in their blog texts. The report has only been interested in analysing the texts by the bloggers from the mentioned perspectives. Ebba Von Sydow and Caisa Janson are the example of the established bloggers who have the attraction that is needed to stand out in the Media flow. But as the research has been made it seems those professional bloggers have taken over for good as far as the blog world is concerned...|$|R

In {{the figure of the}} novelist Emmanuel <b>Ganse,</b> a latter-day Balzac, who has pretty well exhausted himself as a writer and who keeps going only with the aid of three secretaries, Bernanos seems cruelly bent on guying himself. His honesty here, however, is swamped by the exacerbated preoccupation with contemporary literary names, jobs and reputations and by the arbitrary violences of behaviour of the sickly and sinister trio of secretaries.|$|E
5000|$|The word [...] "goose" [...] is {{a direct}} descendent of Proto-Indo-European root, *ghans-.

50|$|Suh Myung-suk {{had a clear}} {{principle}} {{when she}} worked on the route signs for Jeju Olle Trail. She would use eco-friendly materials and make any signs go along with nature, but be easily seen. She {{was inspired by the}} route signs she saw in Santiago. The signs were made up of shells or rocks, and only yellow arrows were painted on them. Similarly, but distinctively she decided to lacquer blue arrows on rocks as blue was the color that hikers on Jeju Olle Trail could always see in the skies and seas of the island. For the routes on which she could not find rocks, she tied blue ribbons on nearby trees. However, she soon found it necessary to slightly alter her original plan. Spraying lacquer could damage rocks and as a consequence that conflicted with her conviction to not harm nature. Instead of lacquering the arrows with blue Suh chose to paint the arrows. Routes signs have gone on to expand to blue and orange ribbons along with the <b>Ganse</b> outline, which is shaped after the distinctive Jeju pony. These blue outlines indicate how long a hiker has left is on the particular route. Wooden arrows are also placed a crossroads, while plates are tied to utility poles in the city and some trees in the forest. There are detour and danger signs at locations that require caution. A map and de-tour distance, if needed, are shown. The start of every route has a marker stone. There is a wooden <b>Ganse</b> box with stamps for an Jeju Olle Trail passport to record progress.|$|E

40|$|The {{radiation}} emission mechanism {{responsible for}} both type-II and type-III solar radio bursts is commonly accepted as plasma emission. Recently <b>Ganse</b> et al. suggested that type-II radio bursts may be enhanced when the electron foreshock geometry of a coronal mass ejection contains a double hump structure. They {{reasoned that the}} counter-streaming electron beams that exist between the double shocks may enhance the nonlinear coalescence interaction, thereby giving rise to more efficient generation of radiation. <b>Ganse</b> et al. employed a particle-in-cell simulation to study such a scenario. The present paper revisits the same problem with EM weak turbulence theory, and show that the fundamental (F) emission is not greatly affected {{by the presence of}} counter-streaming beams, but the harmonic (H) emission becomes somewhat more effective when the two beams are present.

We present a scenario resulting in time-dependent behaviour of the bow shock and transient, local ion reflection under unchanging solar wind conditions. Dayside magnetopause reconnection produces flux transfer events driving fast-mode wave fronts in the magnetosheath. These fronts push out the bow shock surface due to their increased downstream pressure. The resulting bow shock deformations lead to a configuration favourable to localized ion reflection and thus the formation of transient, travelling foreshock-like field-aligned ion beams. This is identified in two-dimensional global magnetospheric hybrid-Vlasov simulations of the Earth's magnetosphere performed using the Vlasiator model ([URL] We also present observational data showing the occurrence of dayside reconnection and flux transfer events {{at the same time}} as Geotail observations of transient foreshock-like field-aligned ion beams. The spacecraft is located well upstream of the foreshock edge and the bow shock, during a steady southward interplanetary magnetic field and in the absence of any solar wind or interplanetary magnetic field perturbations. This indicates the formation of such localized ion foreshocks. The simulation was run on the Sisu supercomputer at the CSC – IT Center for Science, Espoo, Finland. We thank T.

Methods: This is a prospective, observational, cross-sectional, pharmacoepidemiologic study {{with a total of}} 2544 consecutive patients treated with a statin for at least 6 months. Main outcome measures: Prevalence of isolated and mixed dyslipidemias of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides among all patients and among patients at high cardiovascular risk; clinical variables associated with attainment of lipid targets/normal levels in French national guidelines. Results: At least one dyslipidemia was present in 50. 8 % of all patients and in 71. 1 % of high-risk patients. Dyslipidemias of LDL-C, HDL-C, and triglycerides were present in 27. 7 %, 12. 4 %, and 28. 7 % of all patients, respectively, and in 51. 0 %, 18. 2 %, and 32. 5 % of high-risk patients, respectively. Among all subjects with any dyslipidemia, 30. 9 % had mixed dyslipidemias and 69. 4 % had low HDL-C and/or elevated triglycerides, while 30. 6 % had isolated elevated LDL-C; corresponding values for high-risk patients were 36. 8 %, 58. 9 %, and 41. 1 %. Age, gender, body mass index and Framingham Risk Score &gt; 20 % were the factors significantly associated with attainment of normal levels for &ge; 2 lipid levels. Conclusions: At least one dyslipidemia persisted in half of all patients and two-thirds of high cardiovascular risk patients treated with a statin.
