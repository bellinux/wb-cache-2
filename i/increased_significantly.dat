For example, while opium and coca had been used for centuries, their active ingredients, morphine and the cocaine alkaloid, were not isolated until 1803 and 1855 respectively. Cocaine and various opiates were subsequently mass-produced and sold openly and legally in the Western world, resulting in widespread misuse and addiction. Drug use and addiction also <b>increased</b> <b>significantly</b> following {{the invention of the}} hypodermic syringe in 1853, with overdose being a leading cause of death among intravenous drug users.|$|E

5|$|A {{traditional}} {{thesis is}} that cavalry assumed {{a much greater}} importance in the 4th-century army than it enjoyed in the 2nd century.

It also enjoyed much higher status than in the 2nd century. At the same time, the infantry declined in efficiency and value in operations, leaving the cavalry as the effective arm.

5|$|Brezhnev {{conspired to}} oust Podgorny from the {{collective}} leadership {{as early as}} 1970. The reason was simple: Brezhnev was third, while Podgorny was first in the ranking of Soviet diplomatic protocol; Podgorny's removal would have made Brezhnev head of state, and his political power would have <b>increased</b> <b>significantly.</b> For much of the period, however, Brezhnev was unable to have Podgorny removed, {{because he could not}} count on enough votes in the Politburo, since the removal of Podgorny would have meant weakening of the power and the prestige of the collective leadership itself. Indeed, Podgorny continued to acquire greater power as the head of state throughout the early 1970s, due to Brezhnev's liberal stance on Yugoslavia and his disarmament talks with some Western powers, policies which many Soviet officials saw as contrary to common communist principles.|$|E
5|$|Canada's {{economic}} integration with the United States has <b>increased</b> <b>significantly</b> since World War II. The Automotive Products Trade Agreement of 1965 opened Canada's borders {{to trade in}} the automobile manufacturing industry. In the 1970s, concerns over energy self-sufficiency and foreign ownership in the manufacturing sectors prompted Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's Liberal government to enact the National Energy Program (NEP) and the Foreign Investment Review Agency (FIRA). In the 1980s, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Progressive Conservatives abolished the NEP and changed the name of FIRA to Investment Canada, to encourage foreign investment. The Canada– United States Free Trade Agreement (FTA) of 1988 eliminated tariffs between the two countries, while the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) expanded the free-trade zone to include Mexico in 1994.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, most fruits rich in vitamin C, such as oranges, became {{difficult}} to obtain in the United Kingdom. Since blackcurrant berries are {{a rich source of}} the vitamin and blackcurrant plants are suitable for growing in the UK climate, the British Government encouraged their cultivation and soon the yield of the nation's crop <b>increased</b> <b>significantly.</b> From 1942 onwards, blackcurrant syrup was distributed free of charge to {{children under the age of}} two, and this may have given rise to the lasting popularity of blackcurrant as a flavouring in Britain. In Britain the commercial crop is completely mechanised and about 1,400 hectares of the fruit are grown, mostly under contract to the juicing industry. Commercially, most large-scale cultivation of blackcurrants is done in eastern Europe for the juice and juice concentrate market.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} {{establishment}} of Yosemite National Park, tourists began to travel into the Merced Canyon and Yosemite Valley as early as 1855. The first roads were constructed into Yosemite Valley in the 1870s. The first was Coulterville Road, followed by Big Oak Flat Road, a trading route from Stockton to Merced Canyon. Environmental movements led by John Muir and Robert Underwood Johnson convinced the U.S. Congress to establish Yosemite National Park in 1890. With {{the creation of the}} national park tourism to the Valley and the Merced River <b>increased</b> <b>significantly,</b> leading to many other roads being built throughout the upper Merced River watershed. Other national forests protecting more of the Merced River upper basin followed, including Sierra National Forest and Stanislaus National Forest.|$|E

Capital ships were typically commanded by a Kapitän zur See (Captain at Sea) or Korvettenkapitän (corvette captain). Each of these ships typically had a total crew in excess of 1,000 officers and men; the light cruisers that screened for the fleet had crew sizes between 300 and 550. The fleet torpedo boats had crews of about 80 to 100 officers and men, though some later classes approached 200.|$|E
