5|$|As the war progressed, Italy {{transformed}} the Albanian Kingdom into Greater Albania, a protectorate of Italy that included most of <b>Kosovo</b> <b>and</b> {{a portion of}} western Macedonia which was detached from Yugoslavia after the Axis powers invaded in 1941. Kosovo Albanians enthusiastically welcomed the Italian occupation. Although officially under Italian rule, the Albanians in Kosovo controlled the region and were encouraged to open Albanian schools, which had been prohibited under Yugoslav rule. They were also given Albanian citizenship by Italian authorities and allowed to fly the Albanian flag. Nevertheless, the Italians kept {{hundreds of thousands of}} troops in Albania and surrounding areas. Yugoslav sources indicated that there were approximately 20,000 Italian soldiers and 5,000 Italian police and frontier guards in <b>Kosovo,</b> <b>and</b> 12,000 soldiers and 5,000 police and border guards in the Albanian-annexed portion of Macedonia. At the same time, Italian military authorities warned that at least ten hostages would be shot for every Italian soldier killed or wounded in these regions.|$|E
5|$|For the 500 Jews {{who lived}} in Albanian-dominated Kosovo, the {{experience}} was starkly different and many did not survive the war. With the surrender of Italy in September 1943, German forces occupied Albania, <b>Kosovo</b> <b>and</b> other territories that had been annexed to the country. In 1944, an Albanian Waffen-SS division was formed, which arrested and {{handed over to the}} Germans a further 281 Jews from Kosovo who were subsequently deported to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where many were killed. In late 1944, the Germans were driven out of Albania-proper and the country became a communist state under the leadership of Enver Hoxha. Around the same time, Axis forces in the Albanian-annexed regions of <b>Kosovo</b> <b>and</b> western Macedonia were defeated by the Yugoslav Partisans, who subsequently reincorporated these areas into the newly established Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia.|$|E
5|$|In April 1941, Germany, Italy and Hungary invaded and {{occupied}} Yugoslavia. Montenegro {{was captured by}} the Germans, who soon withdrew, leaving the Italians to occupy it. The Montenegrins quickly developed grievances against the Italians related to the expulsion of Montenegrins from <b>Kosovo</b> <b>and</b> Vojvodina, the influx of refugees {{from other parts of}} Yugoslavia, and those fleeing Ustaše terror in the regions along the borders with Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Montenegrins also had grievances against the Italian annexation of important food producing territory in <b>Kosovo</b> <b>and</b> a salt producing facility at Ulcinj to Albania, and the economic damage inflicted on many Montenegrins by the temporary removal of Yugoslav banknotes of 500 dinars and above from circulation. By the time of the invasion, Đurišić had been promoted to the rank of kapetan prve klase (captain first class).|$|E

5|$|Albania {{remained}} {{occupied by}} Italy until its {{surrender to the}} Allies in September 1943. In August of that year, faced with the imminent collapse of the Italian war effort, Germany deployed the 2nd Panzer Army to the Balkans to take over areas previously occupied by Italy. One of the Italian areas seized by the Germans was Albania, where the XXI Mountain Corps of Generaloberst (General) Lothar Rendulic's 2nd Panzer Army had been deployed. A Wehrmacht plenipotentiary general, and a special representative of Heinrich Himmler, SS-Brigadeführer und Generalmajor der Waffen-SS und Polizei Josef Fitzthum, were both based in the Albanian capital of Tirana. The Germans took control of all Albanian forces that had been collaborating with the Italians prior to their capitulation, including the Balli Kombëtar, an anti-communist and nationalist militia. The Germans strengthened the Albanian army and gendarmerie, but quickly decided those troops were unreliable. That year, a number of Albanians from <b>Kosovo</b> <b>and</b> the Sandžak region were recruited into the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar (1st Croatian), a Waffen-SS division composed largely of Bosnian Muslims and Croats with mostly German officers. For about six months the division included about 1,000 ethnic Albanians from <b>Kosovo</b> <b>and</b> the Sandžak who made up the 1st Battalion of the 2nd Regiment (I/2), which later became the 1st Battalion of the 28th Regiment (I/28). The division later recruited a further 500 men from the Sandžak.|$|E
5|$|Although the bunkers {{were never}} {{used in a}} real {{conflict}} during Hoxha's rule, some found use in conflicts that {{broke out in the}} 1990s. During the 1997 rebellion in Albania, the townspeople of Sarandë in southern Albania were reported to have taken up positions in bunkers around the town in the face of fighting between government troops and rebels. After the outbreak of the Kosovo War in 1999, border villages in Albania were repeatedly shelled by Serbian artillery batteries located in nearby <b>Kosovo</b> <b>and</b> local people used the bunkers to shelter from the shelling.|$|E

However, {{some of the}} policies implemented by the Young Turks, such as a tax rise and the interdiction of ethnic-based political parties, discontented minorities. Albanians opposed the nationalist character of the movement and led local uprisings in 1910 and 1912. During the latter they managed to seize most of <b>Kosovo</b> <b>and</b> took Skopje on 11 August. On 18 August, the insurgents signed the Üsküb agreement which provided {{for the creation of}} an autonomous Albanian province and they were amnestied the day later.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of Yugoslav {{president}} Josip Broz Tito in 1980, the political situation in Yugoslavia deteriorated, with national tension fanned by the 1986 Serbian SANU Memorandum and the 1989 coups in Vojvodina, <b>Kosovo</b> <b>and</b> Montenegro. In January 1990, the Communist Party fragmented along national lines, with the Croatian faction demanding a looser federation. In the same year, the first multi-party elections were held in Croatia, with Franjo Tuđman's win raising nationalist tensions further. Some of Serbs in Croatia left Sabor and declared the autonomy of areas that would soon become the unrecognised Republic of Serbian Krajina, intent on achieving independence from Croatia.|$|E

5|$|As {{happened}} to {{other members of}} the royal family, Boril's ascension forced Strez and his closest supporters to flee, in that case to neighbouring Serbia, where he was welcomed by the reigning Stefan Nemanjić (1196–1228) in 1207 or early 1208. Even though Boril requested the extradition of Strez to Bulgaria, the Serbian ruler hoped to use Strez as a puppet in gaining Bulgarian-held territory. Stefan believed that Strez's royal ancestry and imperial aspirations would make it much easier to impose Serbian rule over Macedonia, <b>Kosovo</b> <b>and</b> Braničevo, as well as Belgrade, all captured by Bulgaria under Kaloyan. At the same time, Boril was unable to take military action against Strez and his Serbian patron, as he had suffered a major defeat {{at the hands of the}} Latins at Plovdiv. Stefan went as far as to become a blood brother of Strez in a ceremony which Stefan was hoping would secure Strez's loyalty.|$|E
5|$|In February 1944, Hitler {{approved}} {{the creation of}} an Albanian Waffen-SS division that was to serve only inside <b>Kosovo,</b> <b>and</b> was intended to protect ethnic Albania but remain under German control. It was meant to be one of three Muslim Waffen-SS divisions serving in the Balkans, the other two being the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar (1st Croatian) and the 23rd Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Kama (2nd Croatian). Himmler's goal was to expand Waffen-SS recruiting in the Balkans and form two corps of two divisions each, with one corps to operate in the region of Bosnia in the Independent State of Croatia and the other in Albania. These corps would then be combined with the Volksdeutsche 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen and together would form a Balkan Waffen-SS mountain army of five divisions.|$|E
