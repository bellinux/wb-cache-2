The Era of Stagnation, a term coined by Mikhail Gorbachev, is considered by several economists {{to be the worst}} financial crisis in the Soviet Union. It was triggered by the Nixon Shock, over-centralisation and a conservative state bureaucracy. As the economy grew, the volume of decisions facing planners in Moscow became overwhelming. As a result, labour productivity decreased nationwide. The cumbersome procedures of bureaucratic administration did not allow for the <b>free</b> <b>communication</b> and flexible response required at the enterprise level to deal with worker alienation, innovation, customers and suppliers. The late Brezhnev Era also saw an increase in political corruption. Data falsification became common practice among bureaucrats to report satisfied targets and quotas to the government, and this further aggravated the crisis in planning.|$|E

2500|$|The Decree of March 31, 1821 {{brought the}} [...] "Tribunal do Santo Oficio" [...] (the Inquisition) to an end, {{because it is}} found to be [...] "incompatible with the {{principles}} adopted as basis for the Constitution", being [...] "the spiritual and the merely ecclesiastical causes" [...] returned to the [...] "Episcopal Jurisdiction". The Constitution of 1822 established the freedom of the press ("the <b>free</b> <b>communication</b> of thoughts"), without the need for prior censorship, though it still reserved the possibility for any abuse to be punished [...] "in the cases and the way the law determines". The censorship in matters of religion was left, reserved to the ecclesiastical episcopal power, being the government obligated to help the bishops in punishing whoever was found guilty. This period of relative freedom, would however, be a short one. With the Vilafrancada, one year later, prior censorship was once again reintroduced. On November 13, John VI, aware of the revolutionary influences that were coming into the country through several newspapers printed abroad, extended censorship also to include international papers, which would, from then on, require a royal license to enter the country. From 1824, censorship was handled by two instances (being the third one, the Inquisition definitely extinct): the [...] "Censura do Ordinário" [...] (Ordinary Censor) and the [...] "Desembargo do Paço" [...] (roughly the Custom House Censor, for foreign materials).|$|E

40|$|Abstract — When every a {{communication}} {{system is to}} be designed whether wireless or wired, {{the first and the}} most important issue which is to be considered is about the features possess by the medium through which communication will take place and whether those features will induce a negative role on it or not. In <b>free</b> space light <b>communication</b> technique, it is clear by the name that the atmosphere is being used as a medium for carrying or transferring data using infrared carrier. Various atmospheric phenomena do play a negative role on light communication and what we term them as attenuation phenomenal. This paper deals with such various phenomena and its negative role on <b>free</b> space light <b>communication</b> technique.

At runtime, these parts may be replaced by new DIOC fragments from outside the application. DIOC programs are compiled, generating code for each site, in a lower-level language called DPOC. We formalise both DIOC and DPOC semantics as labelled transition systems and prove the correctness of the compilation as a trace equivalence result.
