5|$|The video opens as {{the protagonist}} (Rihanna) shoots and kills a man while he walks through a busy train station. She flees before a {{flashback}} {{to the previous}} day, when she rides her bike, meets friends and is alone in a bedroom at dusk. At a nightclub the protagonist dances and flirts with another club-goer, who then attacks her when she leaves the club. Disheveled, the woman cries in the street after an implied sexual assault, and the video ends as she runs home to grab a gun hidden in a <b>dresser</b> <b>drawer.</b>|$|E
500|$|As Scully {{calls for}} a {{forensic}} team to come out there immediately, she hears something in the house. She goes for her gun in the <b>dresser</b> <b>drawer,</b> but finds it missing. As the creature comes up the stairs, a bloodied Big Mike grabs Scully and tells her to get out, that [...] "it's coming" [...] for her. He shoves Scully in the closet, and fights with the creature. Meanwhile, Mulder confronts Gogolak about marking the Klines for death by giving them the tacky windmill. Mulder says the creature is a Tulpa, a Tibetan thoughtform, that Gogolak conjured to assure compliance with the HOA rules. Mulder arrests him, handcuffs him to a mailbox, and goes to find Scully. Cuffed to the mailbox, Gogolak begs for help, knowing the creature is coming. The creature attacks Gogolak and, as he dies, it disintegrates into dirt. Scully comes outside too late to see the creature, the remnants of which are at Mulder's feet.|$|E
2500|$|Bradley married Betty Van Gorp (1924–2013), {{settled in}} Antigo, had eight children, and {{was active in}} {{numerous}} civic clubs, rarely taking part in ceremonies celebrating the flag-raising [...] and by the 1960s avoiding them altogether. He subsequently purchased and managed a funeral parlor. [...] Bradley's wife later said he was tormented by memories of the war, wept in his sleep {{for the first four}} years of their marriage and kept a large knife in a <b>dresser</b> <b>drawer</b> for [...] "protection". He also had flashbacks of his best friend Iggy, Ralph Ignatowski, who was captured and tortured by Japanese soldiers. Bradley could not forgive himself for not being there to try and save his friend's life.|$|E

2500|$|In October, a {{grand jury}} began {{examining}} the case, calling 95 witnesses and amassing 975 pages of testimony. Mrs. Crater refused to appear. The conclusion was that [...] "the evidence is insufficient to warrant any expression of opinion as to whether Crater is alive or dead, or {{as to whether he}} has absented himself voluntarily, or is the sufferer from disease in the nature of amnesia, or is the victim of crime". At the time, some theorized that he had left town with another woman or fled to avoid revelations of corruption, but the case's extensive publicity would have made it virtually impossible for Crater to have begun a new life somewhere else. Six months after his disappearance, Crater's wife found envelopes in a <b>dresser</b> <b>drawer</b> containing money and a note from the judge. The discovery led to a number of new but ultimately inconclusive leads, and no trace of him was ever found. [...] Crater's wife said that he had been murdered. The case was officially closed in 1979.|$|E
2500|$|While Butt-Head's main {{interest}} {{in life is}} [...] "chicks", Beavis {{seems to be more}} interested in toilet humor and displays of violence. Beavis has a penchant for making off-beat sound effects to suit the occasion. Whenever he sees something that is sexually arousing, he imitates a spring (onomatopoetically saying [...] "Boi-oi-oi-oi-oiiing!!!") indicating a quick erection. He sometimes makes a Bronx cheer by puckering his lips. He occasionally does impersonations, such as of Principal McVicker ("Speech Therapy"), motivational speaker Mr. Manners/Mr. Candy ("Manners Suck/Candy Sale"), and Woody Woodpecker ("Top O' the Mountain"). During one episode, Beavis conspicuously reveals that he is sometimes prone to getting erections in the company of other men. A special ability of his is speaking backwards, as seen in [...] "Vidiots", while the duo review a music video; however, he forgets how to do so {{by the end of the}} video. Beavis also displays a predilection for defecating and things that are related to it, and in a high-pitched tone will often enthusiastically utter the word [...] "poop", or will say the word [...] "plop" [...] to indicate a bowel movement. He frequently pulls down his pants during music video reviews. He also took Kaopectate once after hearing it is for diarrhea under the misconception he would get diarrhea; he was only soothed by an enormous bowel movement which he saved in his <b>dresser</b> <b>drawer,</b> much to Butt-Head's disgust. Beavis sometimes displays examples of the idiot savant when slapped hard by Butt-Head or when attempting to pass out by holding his breath and blowing into his thumb, in which cases Beavis starts to make intellectual statements usually regarding the music videos he is viewing.|$|E

60|$|And while I slept, I dreamed a dream. My dreams often commit me to a {{quiet and}} radiant life, as if of a reality less strange to me than that of waking.

In the old days I would {{sometimes}} tell my dreams to Mrs Ballard; and she would look them up in a frowsy book she kept in the <b>dresser</b> <b>drawer,</b> a brown, grease-stained volume entitled Napoleon's Book of Fate. Then she would promise me a prince for a husband, or that I {{would be a great}} traveller across the sea, or that I must beware of a red-haired woman, and nonsense of that kind.

2500|$|Fuller's {{energy-efficient}} {{and inexpensive}} Dymaxion house garnered much interest, {{but only two}} prototypes were ever produced.

According to Fuller biographer Steve Crooks, the house {{was designed to be}} delivered in two cylindrical packages, with interior color panels available at local dealers.

50|$|Given {{that the}} cajón comes from slave musicians in the Spanish colonial Americas, {{there are two}} {{complementary}} origin theories for the instrument. It {{is possible that the}} drum is a direct descendant of a number of boxlike musical instruments from west and central Africa, especially Angola, and the Antilles. These instruments were adapted by slaves from the Spanish shipping crates at their disposal. In port cities like Matanzas, Cuba, codfish shipping crates and small <b>dresser</b> <b>drawers</b> became similar instruments. Another theory is that slaves used boxes as musical instruments to subvert Spanish colonial bans on music in predominantly African areas; In this way, cajones could easily be disguised as seats or stools, thus avoiding identification as musical instruments. In all likelihood it is a combination of these factors - African origins and Spanish suppression of slave music - that led to the cajón's creation.|$|R
