5|$|Abi {{discovers that}} Ian's {{restaurant}} {{is on fire}} and goes inside to find Jane in a corridor on the floor struggling to breathe. A pipe falls onto Abi, knocking her unconscious, but Max and Steven soon find her and <b>drag</b> <b>her</b> out. She is taken to hospital with Lauren by her side in the ambulance. At the hospital Abi tells Steven {{he is going to}} be a father. Steven declares his love for her and makes a promise that he will make their relationship work. Steven then goes into cardiac arrest and dies after being injured in the fire leaving Abi devastated. In an attempt to console Lauren but also partly out of jealousy that Lauren is getting all the attention, Abi tries to tell Lauren about her pregnancy, but Lauren angrily mistakes this as gloating about her own abortion. Upset at the accusation, Abi says that she wishes Lauren died instead and that she never deserved Steven. Abi attends Steven's funeral as sole mourner and declares her love. Unable to cope with Steven's death, Abi decides to leave Walford to visit Tanya in Devon, taking Steven's ashes with her. When Lauren finds out that Abi is leaving, she asks if she and Louie can come with her. Abi agrees and they leave Walford together.|$|E
5|$|At 11:00, Rosseau gave {{orders for}} the French frigates to sail once more, {{slipping}} away from the British ships which had drifted {{to the north and}} anchoring safely between the batteries at Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue and the island of Tatihou. Observing the strong position the French frigates had taken up, Grant sent messages to Malcolm's force at Cherbourg requesting reinforcements. Malcolm brought Donegal and Revenge to support the frigates on 14 November, maintaining position off the anchorage despite a strong gale which caused Elisa to <b>drag</b> <b>her</b> anchors. Captain Fraycinet-Saulce was forced to throw much of the ship's stores overboard to prevent his frigate from being wrecked on the shore. The following day, Diana took advantage of the rising tide to attack the anchored Amazone, Captain Rosseau withdrawing deeper into the sheltered anchorage under protection from the batteries. Twice more Grant launched probing attacks on the French frigate, each time beaten off by heavy fire from the batteries. Joined by Malcolm and the remainder of the British force, four successive attacks were launched against Amazone, each one driven back by cannon fire. At 13:00, with the tide falling, the British squadron was compelled to retreat to deeper water, out of range of the French. All four British ships had suffered under fire, with two killed and five wounded on Revenge, three wounded on Donegal and one wounded on Diana. French losses were a single man killed on Amazone.|$|E
25|$|The wind intensified, causing London Valour to <b>drag</b> <b>her</b> {{anchor and}} driving her towards the shore. At about 1330 hrs the first officer, Robert Kitchener, saw from his cabin {{that the ship}} was getting closer to the mole. He raised a general alarm, and Second Officer MacIsaac alerted Captain Muir and the {{engineer}} on watch.|$|E

25|$|Trial was {{commissioned}} in July 1744 and launched on 9 November for {{service in the}} ongoing War of the Austrian Succession. The British naval blockade of France had been broken at the Battle of Toulon in February of that year, and Trial was sent to patrol the northern coastline of England for signs of French or Spanish ships. The voyage was not a success; after five days at sea, Trial encountered heavy weather and ran aground at Lindisfarne. A salvage crew was eventually able to <b>drag</b> <b>her</b> off shore, and she was returned southward to await reassignment.|$|E
25|$|The rest of {{the crew}} make a last stand against the Reavers to buy Mal time to {{broadcast}} the recording. Through a message recorded by Mr. Universe into his sex robot before his death, Mal learns of a backup transmitter. Sustaining heavy injuries, the crew retreats behind a set of blast doors that fail to properly close. A Reaver shoots through the opening and severely wounds Simon, prompting River to dive through the doors and close them as the Reavers <b>drag</b> <b>her</b> away. At the backup transmitter, Mal incapacitates the Operative and forces him to watch the broadcast recording. Mal returns to the crew, and the blast doors open to reveal that River has killed all the Reavers. Alliance troops arrive, but the Operative orders them to stand down.|$|E
500|$|On 5 November 1918, in {{the final}} week of the First World War, Royal Oak was {{anchored}} off Burntisland in the Firth of Forth accompanied by the seaplane tender [...] and the light battlecruiser [...] A sudden Force 10 squall caused Campania to <b>drag</b> <b>her</b> anchor, collide with Royal Oak and then with Glorious. Both capital ships suffered only minor damage; Campania, however, was holed by her initial collision with Royal Oak. The ship's engine rooms flooded, and she settled by the stern and sank five hours later, though without loss of life.|$|E

On 5 November 1918, Glorious was anchored off Burntisland in the Firth of Forth together with the seaplane tender [...] and the battleship [...] when a sudden Force 10 squall caused Campania to <b>drag</b> <b>her</b> anchor and collide first with Royal Oak and then with Glorious. Both Royal Oak and Glorious suffered only minor damage, but Campania was holed by her collision with Royal Oak.

500|$|On 4 February 1999, New Carissa {{was bound}} for the Port of Coos Bay {{to pick up a}} load of wood chips. The ship's crew was {{informed}} by the local bar pilots that weather conditions would prevent the ship (which was empty at the time) from entering Coos Bay harbor until the next morning. The captain ordered the ship to drop anchor [...] off the coast in order to ride out the storm. The crew used a single anchor to secure the ship. According to a United States Coast Guard review of the incident, the chain used was too short. The short chain and the weather conditions, including winds of , caused the ship to <b>drag</b> <b>her</b> anchor. Poor navigational techniques and inadequate watchkeeping led to the crew's failure to notice that the ship was moving. Once movement was detected, the crew attempted to raise anchor and maneuver away from the shore, but the weather and sea conditions made this difficult. By the time the anchor was raised, the ship had been pushed too close to the shore to recover.|$|E
500|$|In 1801, Désirée was {{attached}} to the fleet gathering at Yarmouth under Sir Hyde Parker and Lord Nelson for service in the Baltic Sea against the League of Armed Neutrality. Sailing for Denmark in March, the fleet anchored off Copenhagen and on 1 April a squadron under Nelson closed with the Danish fleet, which was anchored in a line of battle protecting the harbour. Désirée was ordered to operate at the Southern end of the Danish line, engaging shore batteries and nearby ships while their attention was focused on the main British battle-line. When the battle began at 10:00 on 2 April, Inman engaged the Provesteen, which was firing on the 50-gun [...] Désirée succeeded in inflicting considerable damage on the Danish ship and drew some fire away from the battered Isis. Once Provesteen had been abandoned by her Danish crew Désirée was engaged with a number of Danish shore batteries, but due to poor aim of the Danish gunners, who fired over the frigate throughout the engagement, she was not badly damaged and suffered only four men wounded in the battle. At 14:00 Danish fire slackened and shortly afterwards Nelson began to withdraw his ships out of range of the Danes. A number of his ships of the line grounded on the complicated shoals in the region and when Désirée came to the assistance of ] she too became stuck. Bellona was hauled off by Isis shortly afterwards, but Désirée was forced to remain on the sandbank for two days until boats from the squadron could be spared to <b>drag</b> <b>her</b> free.|$|E

500|$|In [...] "The Quarterback", Rachel is devastated {{with the}} loss of Finn. Michele, who in real life was dating Cory Monteith, had asked to {{postpone}} this episode until everyone was ready. Rachel doesn't appear in this episode until the very end where she states, [...] "Before Finn, I used to sing alone, {{this was one of the}} songs we would sing when we drove around together." [...] She sings [...] "Make You Feel My Love". Later in the episode, she states that Finn was her person and that they were always going to be together. Later in the season, it is revealed that she got a tattoo of Finn's name (despite telling Kurt that she chickened out when they went to the tattoo shop). Rachel hires Santana to be her publicist, which leads her to take on a charitable cause with a local rescue kennel. She performs with Mercedes and Santana on stage for the benefit, Broadway Bitches, but the publicity stunt goes wrong when the dogs pull her down and <b>drag</b> <b>her</b> for several blocks. Despite this, Santana reassures her and they discuss the next step in their campaign. Rachel lands the lead on the Broadway show, Funny Girl. Santana offers to be Rachel's understudy when Rachel is stuck in Los Angeles for a television show audition. Before the opening, she suffers from a bout of self-doubt, but performs after Santana gives her a pep talk. Lee Paulblatt, a Fox Television executive, sees Rachel perform, and is so impressed, he informs her wants to cast her in an upcoming, untitled television pilot. He has her meet with the famed screenwriter, Mary Halloran, who will be creating the script. After the first meeting, Rachel is confused by Mary's ideas and idiosyncratic behavior. Rachel has the group review Mary's script, and everyone agrees it is terrible (except Brittany). Rachel meets with Mary and tells her that the lead character does not sound like her. Mary points out that television viewers want anti-heroes, but Rachel responds by singing, and Mary, uncharacteristically, is moved and made happy by the performance. She agrees to redo the script, but warns Rachel that the network will never make a pilot from it. Eventually, the network loves the script and calls Rachel, and she moves to LA to start shooting her pilot.|$|E

2500|$|The film {{begins with}} [...] "1 Nature" [...] at the Nyon {{cultural}} center. A young couple, Marie and her boyfriend, {{are setting up}} a used bookstand. Another couple, Davidson and Isabelle, arrive. By the way that Marie, her boyfriend, and later the character Ivitch address Davidson, it appears {{that he is a}} professor. Brandishing a copy of The Gulag Archipelago, Davidson remarks that its author, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, did not need to use Google to search for the book's subtitle. The professor then asks Isabelle what thumbs used to be for before smartphones, making a punning reference to the French children's story Hop-o'-My-Thumb. He then proceeds to deliver an impromptu lecture on the ideas of Jacques Ellul, such as the abdication of individual rights and responsibilities to the state, a situation that Ellul declared to be the triumph of Adolf Hitler. Abruptly a car drives up, a man gets out and, speaking in German, he accosts Josette, who has been standing nearby. After demanding that she come home (implying that the man is Josette's husband), threatening her with consequences, and trying to physically <b>drag</b> <b>her</b> away, the man retreats out of frame and fires shots from a gun. As the other characters rush to where the shots were fired, the car departs. Josette wanders away, while Gédéon, who has been watching all along, follows her. As Josette washes her hands in a fountain, Gédéon approaches and declares to her, [...] "I am at your service." ...|$|E
2500|$|Soon {{after the}} release of Lucifer Rising, a PBS {{documentary}} of Anger and his films was made, titled Kenneth Anger's Magick, which was directed by Kit Fitzgerald, who later recalled interviewing him in his New York flat on a very hot July evening, during which Anger revealed that he was so broke that he had been forced to sell his air conditioner. Anger himself considered producing other films that would continue on from Lucifer Rising in a series, and he began referring to his finished film as [...] "Part I: Sign Language", to be followed by two further parts. Nonetheless, these projects would never be finished, and Anger himself would not produce any further films for nearly two decades. In need of money, Anger subsequently released Hollywood Babylon II in 1984, as well as continuing to screen his films at various festivals and at universities; around this time he began wearing an eyepatch to these public events, something likely due to him having been beaten up and getting a bruised eye, a story that he would bring up in various interviews, although partly changing who it was who had beaten him up in various versions of the story. In 1984, a notorious incident occurred when Anger was invited to appear on The Coca Crystal Show, however upon arriving at the studio he demanded that somebody pay for his taxi ride there, and when they refused, he attacked the talent coordinator Maureen Ivice and tried to <b>drag</b> <b>her</b> into his taxi, before she was rescued by other members of staff – Anger reportedly escaped the scene by flinging a $100 bill at the cab driver and screaming [...] "GET ME OUT OF HERE!" ...|$|E
