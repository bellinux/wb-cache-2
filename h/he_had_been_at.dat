5|$|The White House Farm murders {{took place}} {{near the village}} of Tolleshunt D'Arcy, Essex, England, during the night of 6–7 August 1985. Nevill and June Bamber were shot and killed inside their farmhouse, along with their adoptive daughter, Sheila Caffell, and Sheila's six-year-old twin sons, Daniel and Nicholas Caffell. The only {{surviving}} member of June and Nevill's immediate family was their adoptive son, Jeremy Bamber, then 24 years old, who said <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> home a few miles away when the shooting took place.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1891 he was {{considered}} by many to be the top two-year-old. During the 1892 season he earned £13,023, the second highest of any horse and only bettered by La Fleche. By the time he retired at the end of the 1893 season, he had earned £32,528 throughout his racing career. This was the third highest of any horse in history, behind only Donovan and Ayrshire. When Orme was at his best, John Porter rated him 7 to 10 pounds inferior to Ormonde, whom Porter also trained. Porter also believed that Orme was a better racehorse at age four than <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> two and three.|$|E

5|$|At this point, {{the entire}} Austrian force, {{including}} Klenau's column, withdrew into Ulm {{and its environs}} and Napoleon himself arrived to take command of the II, V, VI Corps, Ney's Cavalry and the Imperial Guard, numbering close to 80,000 men. Archduke Ferdinand and a dozen cavalry squadrons broke out through the French army and escaped into Bohemia. Again, as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> Mantua, Klenau {{was caught in a}} siege from which there was no escape, and again, he helped to negotiate the terms, when, on 21 October, Karl Mack surrendered the encircled army of 20,000 infantry and 3,273 cavalry. Klenau and the other officers were released on the condition that they not serve against France until exchanged, an agreement to which they held.|$|E
5|$|Bamber {{told the}} police that Sheila was {{familiar}} with guns {{and that they had}} gone target shooting together. He said <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> the farmhouse himself a few hours earlier, and that he had loaded the rifle because he thought he had heard rabbits outside. He had left it on the kitchen table fully loaded, with a box of ammunition nearby. After the bodies were discovered, a Dr. Craig, was called to the house to certify the deaths, which he testified could have occurred {{at any time during the}} night. He said Bamber appeared to be in a state of shock; Bamber broke down, cried and seemed to vomit. The doctor said Bamber told him about the discussion the family had had about possibly having Sheila's sons placed in foster care.|$|E
5|$|He {{at first}} denied being {{anywhere}} near the Farm, then during interview four {{said he had been}} there and had thrown stones, and during interview five said <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> the Tangmere block, but had played no role in the murder. During interview six, he said he had hit Blakelock with an iron bar in the chest and leg. Rose writes that there were no such injuries on Blakelock's body. In a seventh interview, he said he had hit a police officer, but that it was not Blakelock. On the basis of this confession evidence, he was charged with murder.|$|E

5|$|He was an Australian {{selector}} from 1967 to 1979. Immediately {{after his}} appointment, he was embroiled in controversy during the First Test against India at Brisbane in 1967–68. The Queensland Cricket Association {{wrote to the}} board, complaining that Harvey, who was the selector on duty at the Test, had missed two hours of play. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> a race meeting {{at the invitation of}} the QCA president. The ACB gave Harvey a talking to. Despite this, he retained his position at the next annual election, with Queensland's Ken Mackay failing to gain a seat on the selection panel.|$|E
5|$|Scully {{begins to}} {{question}} Berquist's motives, noting {{that she was}} the reason Mulder decided to look into this investigation. Mulder, however, begins to suspect Detweiler after learning that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> the vet's office; Mulder believes that he is the dhole and is tranquilizing himself in an attempt to stop murdering. Mulder asks Cahn to confront Detweiler, but Cahn is attacked and severely injured by the Dhole and placed in the hospital. Mulder then visits Berquist and says he thinks she has not been honest with him. Berquist reveals that she first suspected Detweiler when she saw him. She also says that he will try to finish off Cahn. Mulder worriedly tells Scully, who remains skeptical.|$|E
5|$|Neville was {{keeper of}} the royal seal under the new king, Henry III (r. 1216–1272) from about 6 November 1218. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> the royal court since May 1218, and was given custody of the seal {{as soon as it}} was made up. One of the first {{documents}} subsequently sealed was a declaration that no charters or other rights would be granted in perpetuity until Henry attained his majority. Neville was also vice-chancellor of England under the chancellorship of Richard Marsh, who had been elected as Bishop of Durham in 1217 and spent most of his time attending to ecclesiastical affairs in his northern diocese. In fact, if not in name, Neville was responsible for all the duties of the chancellorship, and he exercised most of the power of that office, although Marsh continued to hold the title of chancellor until his death in 1226. When instability threatened the royal government in May and June 1219 Neville was ordered by Pandulf, the papal legate, to remain in London with the Great Seal while a royal council was held at Gloucester. The council resulted in royal government coming under the control of Hubert de Burgh the Justiciar, Pandulf, and Peter des Roches, the Bishop of Winchester.|$|E

5|$|On 18 February 1905, he {{was married}} to a divorcee, Frances Jane Wyatt, in London. In 1908, he was brought before the courts in {{bankruptcy}} proceedings, owing some ₤5,500. During the hearing he stated that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> sea during the period 1898–1902, and had not been working since he returned, although he had visited Ceylon late the previous year looking for work. He and his wife had one daughter. He was enlisted in the Royal Horse Artillery in September 1910, having lowered his age and given Auckland as his place of birth. He served as a soldier for a year before leaving his wife and child at their Park Lane home in London and travelling to Sydney, Australia. In the remaining years before the outbreak of World War I he worked as a clerk at a sugar mill weighbridge in Proserpine, Queensland, and while doing so, lived at Kelly's Club Hotel in Brandon, where he formed a close connection to the publican's family.|$|E
5|$|Now {{known as}} Takanohana, {{he was also}} the {{youngest}} ever to be promoted to ōzeki at 20years 5months. With the foreign born Akebono as sumo's only yokozuna, there was a great weight of expectation on Takanohana to make the next step up. However, his lack of consistency, and Akebono's dominance, delayed his promotion to yokozuna. He won his third championship in May 1993, but lost a playoff to Akebono in the following tournament in July, and even produced a make-koshi or losing score of 7–8 in November. In 1994, a year in which Akebono suffered several injury problems, Takanohana won the January and May tournaments, but was then outshone by Musashimaru, who won in July with a perfect 15–0 record. After taking the September 1994 championship, Takanohana now had six top division titles, but none had been won consecutively. No previous wrestler had ever accumulated so many titles before reaching sumo's highest rank. The Sumo Association nominated him for yokozuna after the September tournament, but the Yokozuna Deliberation Council failed to endorse it by the required two-thirds majority, the first time this had happened in twenty five years. They insisted that two consecutive championships were required, having demanded the same of Akebono before his promotion. In November 1994, Takanohana at last managed to win two consecutive tournaments, with his second consecutive unbeaten 15–0 score, and his promotion was confirmed. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> the ōzeki rank for 11 tournaments, or nearly two years. However, at 22years and 3months, he was still the third youngest yokozuna ever at the time.|$|E
