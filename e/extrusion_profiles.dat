In hot extrusion process, finite-element method (FEM), BP neural network and genetic algorithm were combined together to optimize <b>extrusion</b> die <b>profile</b> which yielded more uniform wear depth distribution on die profile. A method of B-spline function interpolation was used to describe <b>extrusion</b> die <b>profile.</b> The temperature, pressure and velocity field of nodes that lied on <b>extrusion</b> die <b>profile</b> were gained by FEM simulation. Wear depth of <b>extrusion</b> die <b>profile</b> was calculated by modified Archard theory.

Replacing steel with alternative materials, such as aluminum extrusions, {{has become a}} viable strategy for obtaining weight savings at moderate cost penalty, which provide affordability and thus positive environmental impact.

40|$|Abstract. Extruded {{aluminum}} profiles {{are essential}} for lightweight constructions in contemporary transport and automotive applications. The reinforcement of such aluminum-based profiles with high-strength materials offers a high potential for weight reduction and an improvement of functional and mechanical properties. In comparison to conventional composite extrusion using fiber or particle reinforced billets, the alternatively developed process for the embedding of endless reinforcing elements provides enormous advantages regarding extrusion forces, load-adapted reinforcement, and tool abrasion. In this extrusion process with conventional billets, modified tools with portholes are used to position reinforcing elements from outside the pressing tool and to embed them into the material flow during the pressing operation. This composite extrusion process {{is part of the}} research work started in 2003 and carried out within the scope of the Collaborative Research Center SFB/TR 10. To increase the potential of composite extrusion with endless reinforcing elements, the manufacture of composite <b>extrusion</b> <b>profiles</b> with high-strength non-metallic alumina wires is planned. Due to the wires ’ specific properties, e. g. high stiffness, their deflection behavior must be analyzed to guarantee a stable feeding-in process.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to produce by co-extrusion-spheronization pellets with two {{cohesive}} layers, one of them containing a self-emulsifying system for vinpocetine, a poorly water soluble model drug. Two layers were prepared: an inert layer of microcrystalline cellulose, lactose and water and a second one wetted with the self-emulsifying system. Different formulations of both layers were tested, evaluating the effects of formulation variables with an experimental design. The screening amongst formulations was performed preparing rod extrudates and using the <b>extrusion</b> <b>profiles</b> to assess their suitability for extrusion and to anticipate quality of the spheronized extrudates. Tubular extrudates and co-extrudates/spheronized pellets were then produced. Two types of bi-layered pellets were prepared: type I with the self-emulsifying system internally and the inert matrix externally, whereas type II vice versa. The pellets were characterized for sizing and shape, density, hardness, in vitro dissolution and disintegration and released droplets size and in vivo tests. Although both types of pellets demonstrated adequate morphological and technological characteristics, pellets type II revealed an improved drug solubility and in vivo bioavailability. These preliminary technological and pharmacokinetic data demonstrated that co-extrusion/spheronization is a viable technology to produce bi-layered cohesive self-emulsifying pellets of good quality and improved in vivo bioavailability.

40|$|Purpose: Seam welds {{occur during}} the hollow profile extrusion; the billet’s {{material}} {{is divided into}} separate metal streams by the bridges of the die which support a mandrel, and then these metal streams are welded in welding chamber behind the bridges. When the desired conditions have not been provided, the required quality in seam welds may not occur. One of the possible reasons for this situation is a poor metal feed. In this study, an insufficient pressure problem occurring in seam welds on an aluminum <b>extrusion</b> <b>profile</b> section is investigated. Design/methodology/approach: The study was realized on a hollow <b>extrusion</b> <b>profile</b> type which has seam weld zones. The experimental profile was produced by a real extrusion press which has a capacity of 1460 tones. Findings: The poor metal feed occurring on specimen is shown by microstructural pictures. Microstructure of the main region has a homogenous appearance. In the microstructure, containing seam weld region, only a slight change was observed in seam weld region. However, {{there was no significant}} change in near of seam weld regions. This points out that there has been no metallurgical problem. Therefore, the problem is an insufficient pressure problem and this caused poor metal feeding. In the other hand, micro hardness tests are realized on seam weld region, main region and defective region’s surround of specimen’s section. After the micro hardness tests important differences are shown among these regions’ strength. Hardness values of seam weld region were lower than the main material’s hardness values, but higher than the defective region’s.
