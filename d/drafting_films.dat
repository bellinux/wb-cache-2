50|$|Drafting {{film is a}} {{sturdier}} {{and more}} dimensionally stable substitute for drafting paper sometimes used for technical drawings, especially architectural drawings, and for art layout drawings, replacing drafting linen for these purposes. Nowadays it is almost invariably made of transparent biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate, which should last several centuries under normal storage conditions, {{with one or two}} translucent matte surfaces provided by a coating. However, some older <b>drafting</b> <b>films</b> are cellulose acetate, which degrades in only a few decades due to the vinegar syndrome. Uncoated films are preferred for archival, because there is then no possibility that the coating material could deteriorate over time or react with other materials.|$|E

5000|$|Because non-etching ink doesn't {{penetrate}} {{the surface of}} the film the way it penetrates paper, it is often possible to remove inked lines from <b>drafting</b> <b>film</b> when drawing on it by hand; an abrasive-free vinyl drafting eraser is the preferred tool for this, although a scalpel works too. [...] For the same reason, graphite on the surface tends to smear; there are polyester pencil drafting leads available as a substitute for graphite for drawing on <b>drafting</b> <b>film.</b> [...] Different matte coatings (generally consisting of amorphous silica particles dispersed in a resin) are better suited for graphite or for polyester leads.|$|R
50|$|Drawing inks can {{be divided}} into two groups: India ink and polymer inks. India ink is used on paper and <b>drafting</b> <b>film</b> plastics. The most {{commonly}} used India ink is a colloidal mixture of water and carbon black.|$|R
5000|$|Historically, {{some types}} of artworks were {{prepared}} on clear polyester <b>drafting</b> <b>film</b> or similar media for strength, durability and dimensional stability. [...] Modern artwork may be stored electronically, such as those created in Adobe Illustrator file format (.ai).|$|R
50|$|Manual {{drawing on}} <b>drafting</b> <b>film</b> {{requires}} special care with cleanliness, because {{oil from the}} illustrator's hands can form skid patches on the film's nonporous surface, where ink and pencil will not adhere to the matte surface, while drafting paper will absorb the oil.|$|R
40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Level 2 land use mapping from high altitude aircraft photography at {{a scale of}} 1 : 100, 000 required production of a photomosaic mapping base {{for each of the}} 48, 50 x 50 km sheets, and the interpretation and coding of land use polygons on <b>drafting</b> <b>film</b> overlays. To enhance the value of the land use sheets, a series of overlays was compiled, showing cultural features, county boundaries and census tracts, surface geology, and drainage basins. In producing level 1 land use maps from LANDSAT imagery, at a scale of 1 : 250, 000 <b>drafting</b> <b>film</b> was directly overlaid on LANDSAT color composite transparencies. Numerous areas of change were identified, but extensive areas of false changes were also noted...|$|R

50|$|Dimensional {{stability}} {{is important for}} scale drawings that don't have explicit dimensions, such as maps, because measurements may be taken directly from the drawing, so drawings that expand and shrink with temperature and humidity can introduce great imprecision into these measurements; some undimensioned drawing standards {{require the use of}} <b>drafting</b> <b>film</b> for such drawings.|$|R

50|$|In the collection, torture machines, human flesh, {{apparatus}} are organs were shown. The artworks were {{exhibited in}} topographical perspective {{in order to}} make them look like the pages in an old textbook.

5000|$|Before the {{widespread}} adoption of CAD, engineering drawings or architectural drawings were plotted onto sheets of boPET <b>film,</b> known as <b>drafting</b> <b>film.</b> The boPET sheets become legal documents from which copies or blueprints are made. boPET sheets are more durable and can withstand more handling than bond paper. This {{is no longer}} necessary, as traditional diazo [...] "blueprint" [...] duplication has fallen out of use.|$|R
50|$|Apartment 16 is a 2010 bestselling horror {{novel and}} the second novel by British author Adam Nevill. The book was first {{published}} in the United Kingdom on 7 May 2010. Apartment 16 took {{four and a half years}} for Nevill to complete, during which time he wrote seventeen <b>drafts.</b> <b>Film</b> rights to Apartment 16 were under option by Blind Monkey Pictures, the horror movie portion of Festival Film & TV, but have since lapsed.|$|R

After the trials of the gang members, Queen retired from the ATF, and wrote Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang. In 2003, {{while it was still}} only a <b>draft,</b> <b>film</b> rights to the book were sold to Icon, the Hollywood production company owned by Mel Gibson. The book became a bestseller upon its release in 2005.|$|R
50|$|The cyanotypes {{are created}} through a {{scientific}} and experimental process, by painting {{the images on}} semitransparent <b>drafting</b> <b>film.</b> Next, they are pressed on paper glazed with light-sensitive emulsion and exposed to the sun, creating a positive image. This process mimics that of the Harvard Computer’s astronomical plates, essentially creating a photographic print {{without the use of}} a camera. Stepping away from the often formulaic process of science, Halloran’s pieces do not dwell in accuracy, but instead offers an active experience, re-igniting the spirit of the universe.|$|R
2500|$|Greetings {{is about}} three New Yorkers dealing with the <b>draft.</b> The <b>film</b> is often {{considered}} the first to deal explicitly with the <b>draft.</b> The <b>film</b> is noteworthy for its use of various experimental techniques to convey its narrative in ultimately unconventional ways. Footage was sped up, rapid cutting was used to distance the audience from the narrative, and {{it was difficult to}} discern with whom the audience must ultimately align. [...] "Greetings" [...] ultimately grossed over $1 million at the box office and cemented De Palma's position as a bankable filmmaker.|$|R

50|$|Sadomasochism, {{pain and}} torture were {{the themes of}} the show.

It told a weird story of a factory worker became a serial killer who then got raped by a machine and gave birth to an abnormal child. The idea is about the extreme effects caused by over relying on technology. The book included Su's drawings, a postscript by artist named Nadim Abbas and an 18,000-word novella created by her Asia Art Archive colleague named Mary Lee.|$|R

50|$|From {{the late}} 19th century {{until the middle}} of the 20th century, {{drafting}} linen, also known as drafting cloth, was commonly used as an alternative to wood-pulp and rag papers in creating technical drawings. Its major benefits were considerable strength, especially in erasing and redrawing, durability in handling, and translucency for making multiple reprographic prints. Manufactured as an undyed muslin woven fabric, typically using cotton or linen fiber, the textile was highly starched and then calendered to create a smooth surface for precise ink and graphite lines. Although drafting linen was most typically used in creating original drawings, it was occasionally used as the underlying support for blueprints and other similar reprographic processes. Drafting linen largely fell out of favor after the development of <b>drafting</b> <b>film</b> — varying in chemical composition from cellulose acetate to polyester—in the 1950s.|$|R
