5|$|Lutetium {{tantalate}} (LuTaO4) is the densest known stable {{white material}} (density 9.81 g/cm3) and therefore <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>ideal</b> host for X-ray phosphors. The only denser white material is thorium dioxide, with density of 10 g/cm3, but the thorium it contains is radioactive.|$|E
5|$|Molecular oxygen <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>ideal</b> {{terminal}} {{electron acceptor}} {{because it is}} a strong oxidizing agent. The reduction of oxygen does involve potentially harmful intermediates. Although the transfer of four electrons and four protons reduces oxygen to water, which is harmless, transfer of one or two electrons produces superoxide or peroxide anions, which are dangerously reactive.|$|E

5|$|O'Flaherty {{interprets the}} myth of Prithu—his {{transformation}} from a hunter who chased the earth-cow to the herdsman-farmer—as a transition in Vedic or Hindu people from eating beef to having cow's milk and cultivated vegetables and grain instead of beef. David Shulman compares Prithu with the Vedic deity Rudra-Shiva. Prithu, like Rudra, <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>ideal</b> king, but with a violent side. Prithu's actions of chasing the earth-cow as a hunter and finally milking her, display this terrifying side of the king. Both, Prithu and Rudra, are closely associated with sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|The {{headland}} at Braich y Pwll is {{the only}} known location on the British mainland of the spotted rock rose, which produces bright yellow petals that last only one day. The coast here has open grass heath land and mountain, giving way to rugged sea cliffs and coves. There is a profusion of wildlife, and it <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>ideal</b> vantage point to watch the spring and autumn bird migrations. Choughs, peregrine falcons, kestrels, puffins, stonechats, guillemots and Manx shearwaters can be seen, and dolphins, porpoises and seals can be spotted in the water.|$|E
5|$|Pindus National Park is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} least visited and least known national parks in Europe and it is not signposted from the main roads of the region. The area offers opportunities for hiking with its dirt roads being in good condition except in winter. The park can be best accessed from north, from the village of Perivoli, while there is also a track from the west side, near Milia. A climbing resort lies near Mavrovouni peak, at a height of , which <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>ideal</b> base for excursions to the park's area. According to the local legislation, the collection of any kind of organism is not allowed, while camping and staying in the park's core after the setting of the sun is prohibited. Additional restrictions include the lighting of fires, while activities such as kayaking and rafting need a special clearance from the local forestry.|$|E

Mammal species living in hardwood hammocks include opossums (Didelphis virginiana), raccoons (Procyon lotor), bobcats (Lynx rufus), Everglades minks (Neovison vison), marsh rabbits (Sylvilagus palustris), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), and the rare, critically endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi).|$|E
5|$|A fictionalized memoir set in {{both the}} United States and France during the 1960s American civil rights movement, White Dog focuses on the events that occur after Gary and his then-wife Jean Seberg, an actress and an activist, adopt a {{handsome}} and clearly well-trained German Shepherd dog who comes back to their home with one of their other dogs. At first, the dog, which they name Batka, <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>ideal</b> new member of the family: intelligent, devoted, and quickly befriending the couple's assortment of other animals. To their dismay, they discover that the dog, a former Alabama police dog, was trained to attack black people on sight. Although they are told the dog is {{too old to be}} retrained, they take him to a black dog trainer to try. Instead, the man trains the dog to attack white people, including Gary himself. Gary states that he changed the ending of the American version to be more optimistic.|$|E
