40|$|The paper {{examined}} {{the role of}} water demand management instruments to achieve domestic water use efficiency in Gweru. Household water consumption histories were reconstructed using monthly household water consumption records for 2005 to 2010. Background characteristics of household heads were taken into consideration when analyzing water consumption patterns. To manage water demand the City uses socioeconomic instruments like <b>differential</b> <b>water</b> <b>rate</b> structures, education and reduction in water releases to domestic consumers using mechanical devices. These measures are expected to impact domestic water consumption patterns by curtailing perceived non essential uses of water. Results show that impact of these measures on household water consumption is varied. There is a relationship between income and water consumption. Water consumption in high income residential areas is high due to presence of high water demanding indoor appliances and outdoor activities. Households in low income residential areas react to water price disincentives by restricting consumption to basic needs. To succeed water demand management strategies must be supported by robust institutional, legislative and regulatory frameworks for enforcement of the water demand management instruments...|$|E
40|$|Laboratory tests {{conducted}} on building assemblies {{to assess their}} resistance to rain penetration are commonly conducted by exposing the assemblies to air pressure <b>differentials</b> and <b>water</b> sprayed onto the outer surface to simulate wind-driven rain. The two primary test parameters are magnitude of air pressure <b>differential</b> and <b>water</b> spray <b>rate.</b> To assess the appropriateness of current standards for testing window assemblies exposed to real weather conditions in Metro Vancouver’s unique temperate rainforest climate, measurements of hourly wind-driven rain observed at building sites in Metro Vancouver are used to compute corresponding test conditions. Analysis of the observed site data leads to an expression for catch ratio {{as a function of}} wind speed. To establish a statistical basis for computing test conditions for specific return periods, the site data are linked to 25 years of average hourly historical data collected by Environment Canada from 1981 to 1996 at the Vancouver International Airport. Based on an extreme distribution analysis of wind speed and driving rain intensity, the <b>water</b> spray <b>rate</b> and air pressure differential corresponding to 10 - and 20 -year return periods are computed and compared to current standards. Results suggest that the standard for the intensity of rain impinged on window surfaces meets or exceeds measured conditions corresponding to a 20 -year return period and are adequate for Metro Vancouver’s climate...|$|R

The fused measurement is obtained by combining the complementary advantages of two different approaches to measuring the building cooling load. One approach is the direct measurement, which calculates the building cooling load directly, using the <b>differential</b> <b>water</b> temperature and <b>water</b> flow <b>rate</b> measurements. The other is the indirect measurement, which calculates building cooling load based on chiller models using the instantaneous chiller electrical power input, etc. The combination strategy is tested using the field data collected from the central plant of the air-conditioning system in a high-rise building in Hong Kong. The confidence degree associated with the fused measurement is systematically evaluated. Periodic update of the fusion algorithm parameters is also developed to improve the performance of the fusion strategy and the chiller sequencing control.

40|$|The water soft path (WSP) {{has been}} {{formulated}} as a progressive paradigm in water management. The WSP {{has four main}} principles: water {{should be viewed as}} a service; ecological sustainability is of utmost importance; water quantity and quality should be conserved; and planning should be done from the future backwards, not projected from the present. It may be possible to use conservation-based water pricing programs, especially at the residential level, in order to incrementally implement the WSP. Moreover, the implementation of residential seasonal <b>water</b> <b>rates</b> has been suggested as a method to curb peak demand in municipal water systems, thereby deferring infrastructure expansion. The purpose of this thesis is to answer the question: what are the barriers to implementing residential seasonal <b>water</b> <b>rates</b> in the Region of Waterloo? This question is addressed using a variety of data sources, with the majority of the information coming from academic and non-academic literature, and from interviews with water professionals and local councillors. The results provide a descriptive case study concerning the barriers to implementing seasonal <b>water</b> <b>rates</b> in one particular region of southwestern Ontario, but the conclusions can be generalized to describe some of the barriers to the implementation of seasonal <b>water</b> <b>rates</b> in Ontario. Results suggest that some barriers are more severe than others, and that the more serious ones may be addressed by: expounding the potential for seasonal <b>water</b> <b>rates</b> to curb peak demand; carefully designing a rate study to be administered with non-price programs; and implementing the designed rate structure as a pilot study. It is suggested that the implementation of seasonal <b>water</b> <b>rates</b> can be used as an incremental step towards the adoption of WSP principles, but not without first envisioning a desirable future...|$|R
