60|$|Molloy <b>frowned</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{floor for}} some moments in stern perplexity.|$|E
60|$|Foster {{told him}} to watch Walters' door, and <b>frowned</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> lad.|$|E
60|$|Then, suddenly, he laughed. Portentously spectral, Mr. Jones <b>frowned</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sound.|$|E
60|$|Vesey {{sat down}} on a table corner and began to whistle softly, <b>frowning</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> cablegram.|$|R
60|$|The Marquis glanced with {{a slight}} <b>frown</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> machine, and, taking her wrists, stooped down and kissed them lightly.|$|R
60|$|Jon stood still. Sweat {{broke out}} on his forehead, and his limbs trembled. Fleur too had stopped, and was <b>frowning</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> river.|$|R
60|$|The {{man made}} no reply, but smoked with {{increasing}} intensity, while he <b>frowned</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> empty fire-place.|$|E
60|$|She {{turned away}} and left him; and Weston <b>frowned</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> supper dishes he had carried down to the lake.|$|E
60|$|Andrew <b>frowned</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> chart, {{as if he}} did {{not know}} how to go on; and Whitney came to his rescue.|$|E
60|$|Until he came, my aunt sat {{perfectly}} {{upright and}} stiff, <b>frowning</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> wall. When he came, my aunt performed the ceremony of introduction.|$|R
60|$|This {{argument}} seemed unanswerable. <b>At</b> {{all events}} <b>the</b> old {{man did not}} answer it, but sat <b>frowning</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> cooking-lamp {{under the influence of}} intense thought.|$|R
6000|$|... "Crazy!" [...] cried Jeff, {{laughing}} and <b>frowning</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time. [...] "What's crazy in {{wanting to go}} off on a drive and choose your own party?" ...|$|R
60|$|Cranly still <b>frowned</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> stout student below him. Then, with a snort of disgust, {{he shoved}} him violently down the steps.|$|E
60|$|Buck Mulligan <b>frowned</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> lather on his razorblade. He hopped {{down from}} his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily.|$|E
6000|$|He {{lost his}} head, [...] "I'm afraid," [...] he mumbled, [...] "I'm afraid this means I {{shall have to}} go back to town at once." [...] He <b>frowned</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{telegram}} ferociously.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why don't he pull a bit, daddy?" [...] inquired Billy {{pointing}} with a <b>frown</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{figure that}} lay crouched {{up in the}} bow of the boat.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked up}} gravely {{to see if}} he agreed. He turned from <b>frowning</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> cloud to smile at her. He seemed so bright, teeming with life.|$|R
6000|$|Then Turnbull, who {{had been}} staring with a <b>frown</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fresh turf, burst out with a rather bitter laugh and cried, {{throwing}} his red head in the air: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'They have no manners, these Men Folk,' said Mowgli to himself. 'Only {{the gray}} ape would behave as they do.' So he threw back {{his long hair}} and <b>frowned</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> crowd.|$|E
60|$|Thus appealed to, Dr Hopley {{paused a}} moment and <b>frowned</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> teapot, {{as though he were}} about to tax his brain to the utmost in the {{solution}} of an abstruse question in medical science.|$|E
6000|$|... "They have no manners, these Men Folk," [...] said Mowgli to himself. [...] "Only {{the gray}} ape would behave as they do." [...] So he threw back {{his long hair}} and <b>frowned</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> crowd.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't know it. Not {{going to}} try till next week. Grind away over your old Greek {{as much as you}} like, but don't bother me," [...] {{answered}} Jack, <b>frowning</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> mere thought of the detested lesson.|$|R
60|$|He {{rode with}} the letter open in his hand, <b>frowning</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> curious turmoil which Ferrand excited in his heart. It was as though this foreign vagrant twanged within him a {{neglected}} string, which gave forth moans of a mutiny.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't {{say that}} I have," [...] {{answered}} the interpreter, with a matter-of-fact <b>frown</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ground, [...] "but I {{have noticed that}} the pit-saw they was usin' yesterday {{has been allowed to}} saw into the holdin'-irons and damaged half o'--" ...|$|R
6000|$|At {{the corner}} of Wilde's house he halted, frowned at Elijah's name {{announced}} on the Metropolitan hall, <b>frowned</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> distant pleasance of duke's lawn. His eyeglass flashed frowning in the sun. With ratsteeth bared he muttered: ...|$|E
60|$|Giglio came up {{the steps}} with his horrible bride on his arm, looking as pale {{as if he was}} going to execution. He only <b>frowned</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Fairy Blackstick--he was angry with her, and thought she came to insult his misery.|$|E
60|$|The Genoese <b>frowned</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> boldness {{with which}} Francis spoke, but at heart agreed in the sentiments he expressed; for among the Genoese officers, generally, {{there was a}} feeling that this brutal {{execution}} in cold blood was an impolitic, as well as a disgraceful deed.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, if I must, I must,' the King said, with {{a melancholy}} air, and, after folding {{his arms and}} <b>frowning</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> cook till his eyes were nearly out of sight, {{he said in a}} deep voice, 'What are tarts made of?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I ain't quite sure, sir," [...] {{replied the}} little plain one, with an inquiring <b>frown</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> chandelier, [...] "but I know it 'ad somethink {{to do with}} cats. P'r'aps it was Mew Street; but I'm quite sure it was Pimlico." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Treherne at last, {{leaning back}} and <b>frowning</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> signboard, with the colored birds and dolphins, just about his head; [...] "suppose {{somebody}} did kill the Squire. He'd killed {{a good many}} people with his hygiene and his enlightened landlordism." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nor do I, but {{it seems}} to promise a clue," [...] Dick {{answered}} dryly. He <b>frowned</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> blotter and then added: [...] "We'll leave it at that. I've some vague suspicions, but nothing to act upon. If the thing gets any plainer, I'll let you know." ...|$|E
60|$|Sir Marmaduke, after {{a slight}} pause, had {{contrived}} to utter an oath--indicative of the wrath he, as Lady Sue's guardian, should have felt at her statement. Squire Boatfield <b>frowned</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> oath. He had never liked de Chavasse and disapproved {{more than ever}} of the man's attitude towards his womenkind now.|$|E
60|$|Beth <b>frowned</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{news and}} then sat down to {{carefully}} think out the problem. In an hour she had logically concluded that Diana Von Taer was the proper person to appeal to. If anyone knew where Louise was, it was Diana. That same afternoon she drove to the Von Taer residence and demanded an interview.|$|E
6000|$|... "The king glanced {{with a dark}} <b>frown</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{chair of}} his kinsman Mordred, {{but it was not}} empty! A strange, indistinct, shadowy form rested on it. It had no human shape, but a dreadful outline of {{something}} unearthly. Awe-struck and silent, <b>the</b> company <b>at</b> once broke up.|$|R
60|$|Roderick {{said that}} he could offer them nothing but to show them the great terrace, with its view; and ten minutes later the group was {{assembled}} there. Mrs. Light was extravagant in her satisfaction; Christina looked away <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Sabine mountains, in silence. The prince stood by, <b>frowning</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> rapture of the elder lady.|$|R
60|$|He was <b>frowning</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{floor as}} he spoke, {{and there was}} a light under his heavy lids that was not often seen there. The mysticism that was buried deep under all the cynicism of his {{experience}} was awake and moving in the depths. His voice took unexpected turns and inflections, almost as if two men were speaking.|$|R
