5|$|Unbinilium, {{also known}} as eka-radium or simply element 120, is the {{hypothetical}} chemical element in the periodic table with symbol Ubn and atomic number 120. Unbinilium and Ubn are the temporary systematic IUPAC name and symbol, until a permanent name is decided upon. In the periodic table of the elements, {{it is expected to}} be an s-block element, an alkaline earth metal, and the second element in the eighth period. It has attracted attention because of some predictions that <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the island of stability, although newer calculations expect the island to actually occur at a slightly lower atomic number, closer to copernicium and flerovium.|$|E
5|$|Unbiunium, {{also known}} as eka-actinium or element 121, is the {{hypothetical}} chemical element with symbol Ubu and atomic number 121. Unbiunium and Ubu are the temporary systematic IUPAC name and symbol, until a permanent name is decided upon. In the periodic table of the elements, {{it is expected to}} be the first of the superactinides, and the third element in the eighth period: analogously to lanthanum and actinium, it could be considered the fifth member of group 3 and the first member of the fifth-row transition metals. It has attracted attention because of some predictions that <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the island of stability, although newer calculations expect the island to actually occur at a slightly lower atomic number, closer to copernicium and flerovium.|$|E
5|$|Though a {{few small}} factions broke with Smith's {{organization}} during his lifetime, he retained the allegiance {{of the vast majority}} of Latter Day Saints until his death in June 1844. Following Smith's death, the movement experienced a leadership crisis which led to a schism within the church. The largest group, which would become the LDS Church, followed Brigham Young, settling in what would become the Utah Territory. The second-largest faction, the RLDS Church, coalesced around Joseph Smith III, eldest son of Joseph Smith. Other would-be leaders included the senior surviving member of the First Presidency, Sidney Rigdon; the newly baptized James Strang from Wisconsin; and Alpheus Cutler, one of the Council of Fifty. Each of these men still retains a following as of 2014—however tiny <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> some cases—and all of their organizations have experienced further schisms. Other claimants, such as Granville Hedrick, William Bickerton and Charles B. Thompson, later emerged to start still other factions, some of which have further subdivided.|$|E

25|$|When {{the team}} bats, the captain decides the batting order.

If quick runs are needed, a naturally attacking batsman may be promoted up the order.

2500|$|The {{belief that}} free trade would promote peace was widely shared by English liberals of the 19th and early 20th century, leading the {{economist}} John Maynard Keynes (1883–1946), {{who was a}} classical liberal in his early life, {{to say that this}} was a doctrine on which he was [...] "brought up" [...] and which he held unquestioned only until the 1920s. In his review of a book on Keynes, Michael S. Lawlor argues that <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> large part due to Keynes' contributions in economics and politics, as in the implementation of the Marshall Plan and the way economies have been managed since his work [...] "that we have the luxury of not facing his unpalatable choice between free trade and full employment". A related manifestation of this idea was the argument of Norman Angell (1872–1967), most famously before World War I in The Great Illusion (1909), that the interdependence of the economies of the major powers was now so great that war between them was futile and irrational (and therefore unlikely).|$|E

2500|$|Institutionalist {{arguments}} for resolving ethnic conflict often focus on national-level institutions {{and do not}} account for regional and local variation in ethnic violence within a country. Despite similar levels of ethnic diversity in a country, some towns and cities have often found to be especially prone to ethnic violence. For example, Ashutosh Varshney, {{in his study of}} ethnic violence in India, argues that strong inter-ethnic engagement in villages often disincentivizes politicians from stoking ethnic violence for electoral gain. Informal interactions include joint participation in festivals, families from different communities eating together or allowing their children to play with one another. Every day engagement between ethnic groups at the village level can help to sustain the peace in the face of [...] national level shocks like an ethnic riot {{in another part of the}} country. In times of ethnic tension, these communities can quell rumors, police neighborhoods and come together to resist any attempts by politicians to polarize the community. The stronger the inter-ethnic networks are, the harder it is for politicians to polarize the community even if <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> their political interest to do so.|$|E
2500|$|After {{reviewing}} the existing {{law on the}} subject of vagueness, starting with the Supreme Court's decision in Grayned v. City of Rockford eight years earlier, Leighton considered Hoffman Estates' ordinance. [...] "It is obvious that [...] is not a model of legislative clarity," [...] he began. [...] "Its purpose, nonetheless, is evident." [...] The words [...] "item", [...] "effect", [...] "paraphernalia", [...] "accessory" [...] or even [...] "thing" [...] were not used in a technical sense; [...] "they are, in fact, ordinary words." [...] Since no precedent had considered their definition, he resorted to a dictionary and found clear and specific definitions for all but one. To get a better handle on the remaining word, [...] "paraphernalia", he looked to a 1954 decision in a bookmaking case by a California appellate court, which noted that it was [...] "not a technical word in the law of crimes, although <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the law of property." [...] More recently, he noted, both law enforcement and drug users had begun referring to the items targeted by the ordinance collectively as parpahernalia, and the Eighth Circuit had taken notice of that usage in a case where it upheld the seizure of such items based on search warrant which had used the word.|$|E

He raised funds and {{campaign}}ed but in early February 2005, dropped out and threw his support to C. Virginia Fields. His campaign funding amounted to about $49,000, far less than that of some of other Democratic candidates; Fernando Ferrer raised $1.2million in six months, and Gifford Miller raised $1million in 6 months.Michael Slackman and Jim Rutenberg, [...] New York Times, January 19, 2005 Barron chose to endorse Fields rather than attempt a long-shot campaign. [...] "I think two blacks in the race cancel each other out", he said, indicating a fear that the black vote would be divided and weakened by the choice of two candidates.
