40|$|Invited {{chapter in}} the book Colour Design: Theories and Applications. In PART 3 COLOUR, DESIGN AND COLORATION this chapter covers: - Hardcopy colour: {{analogue}} versus digital - Colour theory in relation to printing - Overview of halftoning and digital print technologies - Overview and development of inks - Inkjet papers and inks - Recent and future trends in colour, printing inks and hardware. This book differs from other existing books in the field, {{with the aim of}} an accessible yet precise and clear text on understanding colour, discussing how to produce colour and real examples of how the designer can apply colour in their work. The book is organised systematically into two distinct parts. Part one reviews the main underlying theories and principles and of what colour is. Topics include lighting in colour, colour illusions and colour trends. Part two examines how colour design is used in applications, such as fashion design, interior design, the World Wide Web and food. The avoidance of complicated descriptions will make this book suitable for a range of readers including <b>designers,</b> <b>colour</b> technologists, colour quality inspectors, product developers and anyone who uses colour in their work. It is also intended for academics and students studying colour and design...|$|E

50|$|Women’s Oxford {{shoes are}} fashionable in the 2010s; however, this trend {{dates back to}} the 19th century. Borrowed from men’s {{footwear}} style, women’s Oxfords have received immense popularity since the 1920s including much attention in the 1940s-1950. The body of the Oxford shoe is created to appear as a flawless portion of leather, with a second leather piece forming the toe-cap. The differences in styles are generally due to the ornamentation: taller heels and <b>designer</b> <b>colours.</b> Since the current women’s oxfords draw ideas not only from the men’s shoe, but also from almost any conceivable source, the women’s variety has more freedom in terms of design, choice, and less adherence to tradition. This implies that Oxford shoes can fit almost every woman’s preferred style.|$|R

As architects have significant roles in determining the appearance of buildings that contribute to city colourscapes, it might be expected that they have considerable colour knowledge.

40|$|A colour {{design tool}} {{targeted}} at both unskilled consumers and professional designers is currently under development, {{on the basis}} of psychophysical studies into semantic associations of colour, the cultural influences and colour harmony. From experimental results for single-colour associations, 3 underlying factors were identified: “warm-cool”, “heavy-light” and “active-passive”, which were found to agree well with those identified by earlier research. For colour-combination associations, an “additive property” of colour association was discovered: the semantic score of a colour combination can be determined by averaging semantic scores of each constituent colour in that combination. According to the experimental results, there were 4 general patterns of colour harmony: similarity in hue and chroma, difference in lightness, high lightness and the hue effects.

It is important to educate students in design schools about colour, and how this element can play a big role in transforming the whole creative design process. Theorists disagree regarding the stage at which colour is considered. For example, many references, such as Pile (2007), showed that colour choices occurred in a later stage of design, concept development, while Attiah’s 2016 study demonstrates that <b>designers</b> consider <b>colour</b> in the first stage of a design project. The aims of this study are to determine the stage of colour thinking and choices by observing interior design and furniture students in King Abdulaziz University, who were undertaking commercial design studio, where their task involved designing retail interiors (stores) from scratch. The study will be in two stages, the first one is determining the stage of colour thinking and choices when students were building their design concepts, and the second one is to compare the findings with the results of Pile’s and Attiah’s theories.

WCAG 2. 0 defines contrast guidelines that ensure web pages can be read by people with a visual acuity of as low as 20 / 80.

40|$|A conference paper {{presented}} at the Electronic Imaging, Society for Imaging Science and Technology/Society of Photographic Instrumentation Engineers, 26 - 31 January 2008. Advances in rapid prototyping technologies have led to the emergence of three-dimensional printers which can fabricate physical artefacts, including the application of surface colours. In light of these developments, this paper asserts that the need to print colour accurately is just as important for <b>designers</b> using three-dimensional <b>colour</b> printing as it is for two-dimensional inkjet printing. Parallels can be made with two-dimensional digital Inkjet printing and 2 D common problems include: on screen pre-visualisation, colour management methods, colour gamut and maintaining colour accuracy. However, for three dimensional colour printed objects, there are more variables that will affect the finished colour. These are: the powder and process inks, unevenness of the surface, wax post-coating processes and different infiltration medium and procedures. Furthermore, in some 3 D printers, the K channel is replaced by the binder and so the printer is only using the cyan, magenta and yellow channels. The paper will suggest methods for improving pre-visualisation and accurate pre-viewing of the colours through the manufacture of three-dimensional colour charts as a reference guide for designers so that they can make accurate coloured artefacts.

40|$|Colour {{is a very}} {{important}} topic that interior designers need to consider. Considerable research has been conducted in the area of colour application in interior design; in this study we are concerned with colour terms in interior design, mainly the terms designers use and know about. Fifteen interior designers with varied professional backgrounds, but based in the Middle East (Saudi Arabia, Dubai, Bahrain, Lebanon, Egypt, and Turkey), were interviewed. Previously we reported that fourteen out of fifteen <b>designers</b> stated that <b>colour</b> thinking and decision making take place at the early stages of their design processes; eight of them reported that colour takes place in the first step when meeting clients and starting the project (Attiah et al., 2014). This study documented 137 terms which the fifteen designers use whilst brainstorming and working on a design project; subsequent analysis of these terms could form a basis for understanding how interior designers communicate the abstract properties of colour as part of their design processes. In this paper we show how the 137 terms were categorised according to a framework of four categories of colour terms: emotional, descriptive, cultural and functional. In addition, seventeen words (scientists names and technical terms), which are widely used in colour science (such as: CIELAB, Saturation, Itten) were shown to the designers; their knowledge was shown to be incomplete...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} a {{designer}} – for example, interior designer, architect, landscape architect, etc. – to design for a particular target group (user and/or clients) is potentially enhanced through more targeted studies relating colour in situ. The study outlined in this paper involved participant responses to five achromatic scenes of different built environments prior to viewing the same scenes in colour. Importantly, in this study the participants, who were young designers, came to realise that colour potentially holds the power to impact on the identity of an architectural form, an interior space and/or particular elements such as doorways, furniture settings, etc., as well as influence atmosphere. Prior to discussing the study, a selection of other research, which links colour to meaning and emotions, introduces how people understand and/or feel in relation to colour. For example, yellow {{is said to be}} connected to happiness; or red evokes feelings of anger. Secondly, the need for spatial <b>designers</b> to understand <b>colour</b> in context is raised. An overview of the study is then provided. It was found that the impact of colour includes a shift in perception of aspects such as its atmosphere and youthfulness. Through studio/class discussions it was also noted the predicted age of the place, the function, and in association, the potential users when colour was added (or deleted) were often challenged. ...|$|R

The system was designed to translate between descriptive words and colour combinations and aims to provide a form of ideas stimulus for a product designer at {{the initial stages of}} the design process. The computer system uses elements of artificial intelligence (AI) to `learn' colour and descriptor semiotic relations from a product designer based upon a proposed objective criteria or to reflect a <b>designers</b> personal style. <b>Colour</b> concepts for products can then be generated from descriptors based upon these semiotic relations.

40|$|Accompanying {{workbook}} {{not available}} in digital formatBoth empirical and anecdotal evidence indicates that visual communication 1 design practices implemented by <b>designers</b> with full <b>colour</b> vision often disadvantage, and sometimes endanger, colour-blind people. The thesis The Machine postulates that colour-blind people – comprising approximately 8 % of males and 0. 5 % of females (Lewis et al., 1990) – are marginalized by such practices. It argues that this group could benefit from a design strategy that enhances the communicative potential and visibility of colour. The proposed strategy involves embedding pattern into potentially confusing colours such as red and green. The embedded pattern would function for colour-blind people as an additional clue to the identity of these colours. The thesis contends that while colour alone can be confusing for colour-blind people, patterned colour could offer a solution {{with a wide range}} of possible applications. The research aims of The Machine include: developing a system of patterned colour; creating a wordless picture book that demonstrates the effectiveness of the system; constructing a narrative around the condition of red-green colourblindness; and employing visual rhetoric 2 to increase awareness of and sensitivity to colour-blindness among those with full colour vision. The design of the thesis is supported by research in a number of interrelated areas. These include the history of pattern post- 1850, particularly in Western culture; precedents for patterned colour; and visual rhetoric in story-telling. The research also incorporates an analysis of the defining characteristics of ten late twentieth-century and early twenty-first-century wordless picture books. The thesis is further supported by applied research into patterned colour and visual rhetoric. The Machine aims to benefit colour-blind people, a significant minority group whose visual needs are currently inadequately met. In addition, it proposes broadening the cultural role and significance of pattern. Moreover, by incorporating informative elements usually associated with pedagogic material, it aspires to extend the boundaries of the fantasy picture book genre. 1 Visual communication (n) : communication that relies on vision (Wordnet, 2006). 2 Visual rhetoric: the use of visual techniques, such as the creation of visually ‘engaging’ characters, as a means of persuading a target audienc...|$|R
40|$|Environmental colour is multifaceted, {{playing a}} variety of roles in our {{everyday}} lives. However, is colour considered important {{in the design of}} our built environment by those who practice design, such as architects and interior designers? Prototypes and massing models for designs are often presented in white or monochromatic combinations, irrespective of the materials incorporated and the colours that may be applied in the final constructed building, interior, or object. Therefore, questions are raised concerning design professionals’ perceptions of the importance of colour in relation to space and form, and to the experience of place. The built environment is understood by the designers and design researchers generally in one of four contexts—as object, as product, as communicator, or as social domain (Smith, Architectural Experience: A Composition of Viewpoints, doctoral dissertation, Queensland University of Technology, Australia; 2000). Designers who consider place as an experience, or as part of a social domain, will address the design task differently than those who treat it as an object to be coloured. In addition, Franz (A Phenomenographic Study of Design in the Interior Context, doctoral dissertation, Queensland university of Technology, Australia; 1997) identified four conceptions of designing held by designers: experiential, structural, production, and retail. Therefore, designers’ conceptions of what it is to design in general are related to {{the manner in which they}} design in practice. In association with such conceptions, it is assumed that the integration of colour in the built environment is also influenced by these understandings. Explorations into environmental meaning, in addition to colour theory and decorative applications, are hypothesized to be important sources of information for <b>designers</b> involved in <b>colouring</b> the built environment. Discussions of environments in terms of signification and experience may broaden practitioners’ understanding of the role that colour plays in place formation. In addition, the findings of a study in which 16 Queensland architects and interior designers were surveyed to ascertain whether colour is considered an integral part of their design process are reported. The study is not conclusive, however; although further investigation is required, the study does identify differences and commonalities among participants that are of interest in light of the aforementioned issues...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between man-made interior designed spaces {{and the critical}} element of colour in these spaces is the concern throughout this study. It is the designer who thinks, re-thinks, decides, then applies the colours onto the interior environment; thus {{is the key to}} improve the colour outcomes in interiors. It is important to understand how <b>designers</b> deal with <b>colour.</b> Sensing a gap in applying colour for interior design, four routes of data collection were designed: literature review, case studies, interviews, and observations. While collecting data, the need for good analysis was needed; and thus CTSC (Constant Theoretical Sampling and Comparison) method was designed and applied. CTSC meets GTM in some rules, but differs in some others. CTSC clarifies the data collection routes/methods used in this study and proposes new terms and criteria for design process researchers. Many concepts and themes emerged from analysing each route individually; emerged concepts in CTSC are the results of analysing each study (for example: the refined results of the interviews are called the interviews’ emerged concepts). When linking all the emerged concepts of the four study routes together using the proposed CTSC big linking, the findings of the research were defined, and a justified theory was formed in the area of colour-in-interior design. The case studies analysed three interiors in the UK, whereas the interview study was the major in-depth followed route in this thesis, traveling to seven countries and interviewing twenty-five interior designers. The designed observational study included seven interior design projects. Building contacts with more than thirty designers and design practices facilitated more opportunities for the research to emerge in up-to-date concepts and themes, which allowed to result in theory, and gave the research more chances to design future plans. The insights of this thesis can assist future researchers who are interested in both areas: design process, by proposing data collection and analysis useful CTSC method, and the area of colour in interior design, by proposing the CTSC colour in interior design theory, which included crucial findings such as: colour comes first in design processes, and that designers will always like to keep their colour choices open to inspirations...|$|R
40|$|At first glance, {{the image}} of a map looks {{familiar}} to a graphic <b>designer.</b> It comprises <b>colours,</b> shapes and typography. But beyond the graphical surface it hides a complex system of techniques and rules, like the clockwork behind a dial. This thesis tries to approach and improve map production from a starting point in graphic design. By addressing visitor maps for nature reserves it aims to make nature more accessible and appealing to a larger group of people. The main purpose of the thesis is to examine how Swedish nature reserve visitor maps can be improved with focus on relevance for their aims and use and how this is communicated through the visual presentation. A secondary purpose is to examine how to produce such maps in a rational way, using digital geographic information systems (GIS) and adopted working processes. The research was conducted using a combination of traditional methods and techniques combined with research through design activity. Methods and techniques were gathered from ethnography, action-research and usability-research and include literature studies, interviews, questionnaire surveys, participatory observation, action-research protocols, beta-testing and collection of samples. The design activity resulted in both free-standing sketches and map-sketches for the Gotlandic nature reserves Langhammars and Stora Karlsö. Two processes and one descriptive structure were developed and described: a process to adopt visual representations of map-information to its contextual relevance, a process to produce nature reserve visitor maps, and a structure to present practical design work in a scientific context. Results also comprised collected answers, discussions and samples from questionnaire surveys, participatory observation, interviews and general research. The thesis concludes that it is fruitful to consider the visitor map as “a product made for use” and apply a usability-approach as it is rather an example of visual information than visual communication. Close research of both sender and users is also important to be able to select, adapt and fine-tune the information in the map in relation to its aims and use. The digital possibilities that enables GIS to provide easy accessible and accurate data can produce efficient workflows in map design if combined with the graphic designers experience to develop and streamline design processes. The combination of modern technology, practical design work and research is profitable in both an analogue and digital context and makes visitor maps a contemporary and interesting area for both researchers and practitioners...|$|R
40|$|Our {{research}} group, led by Professor J. H. Johnston, {{has developed}} a novel approach for dyeing merino wool with nanogold [gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) ] by coupling the chemistry of gold with that of wool fibres. This utilises the plasmonic properties of nanogold to create attractive fabric colours ranging from pink to purple to grey. The newly created fabric benefits from the synergistic effect of the unique properties of strong merino wool and valuable gold, i. e. the innovative product is intensely coloured, colour fast, naturally hydrophobic, anti-microbial, anti-static as well as having first-rate wearing comfort. This innovation has attracted substantial interest from industry resulting in the collaboration of our research group with leading fabric manufacturers and <b>designers.</b> However, the <b>colour</b> range of this unique high-value product is limited. It was desirable to enlarge the colour range by developing new strategies to create wash fast nanogold–wool composites with a broad colour spectrum. Thus my research aimed to identify and understand the fundamental principles that govern the formation of nanogold–wool composites. Based on the derived knowledge, it was aimed to develop a methodology to covalently link pre-synthesised AuNPs of various colours {{to the surface of}} New Zealand merino wool fibres in order to obtain wash fast nanogold–wool composites with a broad colour spectrum. This involved the synthesis, functionalisation and characterisation of colloidal AuNPs, and their application as colourants for wool. The methodology followed three general steps: (1) synthesis of colloidal gold, (2) preparation of the wool surface for the colouring processes, and (3) production of nanogold–wool composites. Each work stage was accompanied by thorough analysis and characterisation of the intermediate and final products. Studying colloidal gold systems and nanogold–wool composites which were previously reported provided the insights that were necessary to develop new methodologies to strongly link AuNPs to wool. For instance, nanogold stabilised by oleylamine produces especially bright pink nanogold–wool composites; however, the AuNP–wool bond is relatively weak. Hence, several AuNP–wool bond types were intensively studied, {{and as a result of}} combining the knowledge gained, two approaches were developed to provide a proof-of-concept for the creation of wash fast nanogold–wool composites. These approaches involved a specifically designed, in-house-synthesised capping agent for AuNPs as well as a crosslinker that binds functionalised AuNPs to the reactive sites of wool. In addition to achieving the project aims, my work produced three new systems of colloidal gold in aqueous medium which stand out due to their properties. Specifically, these properties were: (1) being stable without significant electrostatic or steric stabilisation, (2) having a unique surface functionalisation allowing for selective chemistry, and (3) having an intense blue colour as a result of controlling the AuNP shape during synthesis. All three systems show application potential for wool colouration, ligand exchange reactions, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), and in the field of biomedicine...|$|R

In an indoor environment, walls and furniture colours affect {{the perception of the}} space and induce different emotions and psychological states. In the scientific literature several experiments have been addressed to study color preferences and emotional effects, also looking at different applications. Despite different adopted methods and visual tasks, findings are in quite agreement in asserting that "cool colours" as blue and green are relaxing, calming and peaceful, whereas "warm colours" as red and yellow result activating and arousing. On the other side "neutral colours" have less impact on emotions. As it is well known, white light emitted by lamps and luminaires is characterized by a colour tone, expressed by means of the correlated colour temperature(CCT). All experimental researches performed on circadian effects of light demonstrate that cool light, rich in short wavelengths, has a greater effect in terms of melatonin suppression rather than warm light, assuming the same illuminance value at the eye's level. CCT is not a synthetic parameter able to accurately quantify melatonin suppression, for example it roughly indicates that when very high values are attained, corresponding to a bluish white, circadian stimulus is high as well, once fixed the illuminance values. On the contrary warm light, characterized by low CCT values and corresponding to a reddish white has a lower impact, all other conditions being equal. Furthermore, researches confirmed that blue enriched light, i. e. light with a great amount of short‐wavelength radiations and CCT greater than 10000 K has a positive effect both on seasonal affective disorder (bright light reduces SAD symptoms) and on cognitive performance in educational and office environments, stimulating attention and alertness. As a consequence of the above reported statements, some contradictions seem to appear: in order to obtain relaxing environments cool colours for furniture are recommended, whereas red objects or walls can induce arousal or sense of danger or of alert. At the same time, warmer lights (i. e. reddish lights) are more relaxing and cooler lights (bluish) have a greater effect on melatonin suppression and alertness. As the colour of light is concerned, other parameters have an impact on environmental perception, as illuminances, {{as well as for the}} objects colours, not only hue, but also chroma and value are involved. In order to better understand and overcome these contradictions, we first provide a critical analysis of the current literature and present a preliminary analysis of comparisons between different spectral irradiances at the eye, troughout combined effects of light sources SPDs and objects spectral reflectances. This could be a first step of a wider research aimed to provide advices for interior and lighting <b>designers</b> on proper <b>colour</b> choices of either light and furniture for different applications...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{hypothesised}} that a {{major factor}} in the failure of many e-Commerce ventures was the lack of emotion imparted into the design, with trust barriers still being to the fore, and a lack of affective human factors like fun, pleasure and joy in the user experience. The human brain often acts emotionally before rationally and this affects initial reactions to experiences and the propensity to purchase online. A key to understanding human-computer communication is that form should follow emotion (as well as function). A wide range of design concepts and theories are analysed for linkages to human emotion due to the exploratory nature of this thesis. Aspects of New Media design such as video, sound, images, colour and virtual reality are covered along with previous research into affective human factors; transferability of emotional elements from other products; and the importance of trust and prevention of negative emotions. Case examples are provided throughout via screenshots and commentary, including a special section on the way that the Nike site has met many emotional design criteria. Research into the opinions of designers and users is undertaken via questionnaires to verify literary findings and measure views on emotional appeal within Websites. It was found that there are misunderstandings of human-computer communication - with designers not meeting user expectations in some areas, even though many designers agree that emotional design is important. In particular, there needs to be a better understanding of how to integrate fun, social contact, colour, trust and sound into designs. Emotion is core to human function, and evolution has seen the emotional parts of the brain grow long before rational areas arose. Given the importance of emotion it is only natural that an emphasis should be placed on it in design philosophies. Whilst some designers are realising the importance of this in consumer products this concept needs to be further emphasised in the world of e-Commerce. Designers surveyed in this thesis were nearly all following a form follows function or a subjective/intuitive design philosophy. However, it was found that there was a good level of support (70 %) for emotional design. A gap was established from this fact because only 45 % believe they are currently using a high level of emotional design in practice. Chi-square tests showed that there were a number of significant relationships between the level of education and other questionnaire variables such as the importance of colour and recontextualising from car and game design. Establishing trust helps to overcome the core human emotion of fear. Branding, seals of approval and high quality navigation are amongst the elements that can assist in bridging human-computer distrust. Predispositions and previous experiences can also affect initial trust values. Questionnaire results found that designers still believe that lack of trust is a major psychological barrier to purchasing online. Major trust dimensions from previous empirical research were all deemed important. It was also found that users and designers rated trust near the top of emotional themes to concentrate on in Web design. Negative emotions (anger and frustration) can also arise if the design is not inherently usable. Usability was the top-rating design theme amongst designers. There has to be a good balance between the rational and emotional sides. Further negative emotions can be evoked if the site is slow or if there are delays. Speed of loading was amongst the top emotional design elements for both users and designers. It is a difficult line for designers to tread - on one hand using speed to prevent negative emotions, but on the other hand balancing the need for other design elements that generate positive emotions through fun and pleasure characteristics (that might slow things down). Designers involved in this study were very much in agreement with the importance of choosing colours to match the emotions they wanted to evoke in visitors (based on understandings of colour-emotion stereotypes and 'temperatures'). Colour can achieve harmonious interactions or cause rejection by the human brain depending on its application. The survey of users revealed that almost half of the respondents counted colour in their top 5 emotional themes, whereas designers did not think, it was as important as other emotive dimensions. Different cultures may respond differently to metaphorical images, colours, and dimensions such as power-distance and masculinity. Nearly all designers believed that empathising with target users (a part of emotional intelligence) was very important, as was involving users in the design process (usercentred design). Only 50 % of users felt that designers were respecting their demographies and culture, so there is still a large number of people who feel they could be more satisfied in this sense. It is proposed that more user testing be carried out in conjunction with frameworks that rate cultural dimensions based on target audiences. The use of video and streaming media was portrayed to be a proposition requiring careful consideration and application by previous non-empirical references. Streaming video can connect with people on an emotional level, bringing in a degree of surprise and variation, and fully highlight the appealing characteristics of the product(s) trying to be sold online. Other New Media technologies such as virtual reality (VR) and 3 D have been around for quite awhile (in computer games and scientific applications) but are yet to achieve widespread usage in Website e-Commerce. Some literature is against the use of VR and 3 D on the Web but several companies have been receiving accolades in this area because of the ability to bridge an emotional gap between brands and consumers. Questionnaire results showed that most design respondents did not think streaming media, 3 D and VR were important in order to gain emotional connections. However, higher bandwidth speeds that will facilitate more use of streaming media and 3 D are deemed favourable by designers in terms of increasing emotional appeal. The need for social contact, familiarity and recognition of expressions and gestures led to the proposition of using virtual shop assistants and agents. Contact in the form of live text chat can also fulfil some social needs and plays a big part in portraying trustworthiness since a real person is being interacted with. Designers surveyed in this study were reasonably evenly distributed amongst those in favour, unsure and in disagreement with the use of agents. Surprisingly, given that users would not have had much exposure to virtual agents and characters online, they actually deemed them amongst the highest rating emotional design elements - creating a gap between user expectations and designer actions. Resources revealed that sound can account for a large part of an overall experience. Sound creates mood and atmosphere, and is present in the physical retail environment. Although literature stresses the importance of sound to Web design, designers in this study were of quite the opposite view. Sound was not deemed to be an important experience (near the bottom of ranked emotional dimensions). Users, however, rated sound amongst the middle group of emotional elements. More use of sound is an opportunity for the future. Two broad product ranges - automobiles and computer games - were investigated to see what made them such emotion-centred items. Cars and games evoke feelings of pleasure, fun, flow and fantasy because of their design. <b>Designers</b> favoured interactivity, <b>colour</b> use and fun as gaming elements best applied to Web design. More than half of designer respondents believed that the design of cars and games can be recontextualised into Web design, and most users were definitely in favour of seeing emotional elements they like about cars and games placed into Websites. Dimensions and potential mechanisms for measuring or assessing the emotional intelligence of Websites are proposed, and these include the use of semantic maps to position and compare Websites based on their performance against dimensions such as fun, warmth, trustworthiness, use of colour and the ability to engage users on a social level. The capability of building emotion into a Website is then balanced with the need for high-quality navigation, functionality and usability - as poor efforts in these 'rational' areas can lead to negative emotions and distrust. The design also has to keep in line with the demands of the company wanting the Website built. This study was exploratory - with the aim of bringing out into the open some aspects of New Media e-Commerce design that could he better utilised in order to match the emotions and feelings of customers - potentially leading to higher degrees of sales success. This thesis is therefore hoped to be a catalyst for further study in this area. <...|$|R
