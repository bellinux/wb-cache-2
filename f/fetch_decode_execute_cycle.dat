50|$|The pipelined {{datapath}} is {{the most}} commonly used datapath design in microarchitecture today. This technique is used in most modern microprocessors, microcontrollers, and DSPs. The pipelined architecture allows multiple instructions to overlap in execution, much like an assembly line. The pipeline includes several different stages which are fundamental in microarchitecture designs. Some of these stages include instruction <b>fetch,</b> instruction <b>decode,</b> <b>execute,</b> and write back. Some architectures include other stages such as memory access. The design of pipelines is one of the central microarchitectural tasks.|$|R
50|$|Microcode was {{originally}} {{developed as a}} simpler method of developing the control logic for a computer. Initially, CPU instruction sets were hardwired. Each step needed to <b>fetch,</b> <b>decode,</b> and <b>execute</b> the machine instructions (including any operand address calculations, reads, and writes) was controlled directly by combinational logic and rather minimal sequential state machine circuitry. While very efficient, the need for powerful instruction sets with multi-step addressing and complex operations (see below) made such hard-wired processors difficult to design and debug; highly encoded and varied-length instructions can contribute to this as well, especially when very irregular encodings are used.|$|R
50|$|However, {{the choice}} of {{instruction}} set architecture may greatly affect the complexity of implementing high performance devices. The prominent strategy, used to develop the first RISC processors, was to simplify instructions to a minimum of individual semantic complexity combined with high encoding regularity and simplicity. Such uniform instructions were easily <b>fetched,</b> <b>decoded</b> and <b>executed</b> in a pipelined fashion and a simple strategy {{to reduce the number}} of logic levels in order to reach high operating frequencies; instruction cache-memories compensated for the higher operating frequency and inherently low code density while large register sets were used to factor out as much of the (slow) memory accesses as possible.|$|R
40|$|Multiple-instruction-issue {{processors}} seek {{to improve}} performance over scalar RISC processors by providing multiple pipelined functional units in order to <b>fetch,</b> <b>decode</b> and <b>execute</b> several instructions per cycle. The process of identifying instructions which can be executed in parallel and distributing them between the available functional units {{is referred to as}} instruction scheduling. This paper describes a simple compile-time scheduling technique, called confitional compaction, which uses the concept of conditional execution to move instructions across basic block boundaries. It then presents the results of an investigation into the performance of the scheduling technique using C benchmarks programs scheduled for machines with different functional unit configurations...|$|R
5000|$|After the {{execution}} of an instruction, the entire process repeats, with the next instruction cycle normally fetching the next-in-sequence instruction because of the incremented value in the program counter. If a jump instruction was executed, the program counter will be modified to contain {{the address of the}} instruction that was jumped to and program execution continues normally. In more complex CPUs, multiple instructions can be <b>fetched,</b> <b>decoded,</b> and <b>executed</b> simultaneously. This section describes what is generally referred to as the [...] "classic RISC pipeline", which is quite common among the simple CPUs used in many electronic devices (often called microcontroller). It largely ignores the important role of CPU cache, and therefore the access stage of the pipeline.|$|R

The compile-time schedule is shown to significantly impact performance, despite out-of-order execution. The problem of determining an optimal schedule at compile-time is shown to be NP-complete. A variety of heuristics for instructions scheduling are applied to benchmarks, and it is shown that traditional depthfirst instruction scheduling performs badly compared {{to a variety of}} breadth-first instruction scheduling heuristics.

30|$|The MicroBlaze {{pipeline}} is {{a parallel}} pipeline, {{divided into three}} stages: <b>fetch,</b> <b>decode,</b> and <b>execute.</b> In general, each stage takes one clock cycle to complete. Consequently, it takes three clock cycles (ignoring delays or stalls) for the instruction to complete. Each stage is active on each clock cycle so three instructions can be executed simultaneously, one {{at each of the}} three pipeline stages. MicroBlaze implements an instruction prefetch buffer that reduces the impact of multi-cycle instruction memory latency. While the pipeline is stalled by a multi-cycle instruction in the execution stage the instruction prefetch buffer continues to load sequential instructions. Once the pipeline resumes execution the fetch stage can load new instructions directly from the instruction prefetch buffer rather than having to wait for the instruction memory access to complete. The instruction prefetch buffer is part of the backbone of the MicroBlaze architecture and {{is not the same thing}} as the optional instruction cache.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1980s (2 years later than planned), the Ivory family of single-chip Lisp Machine {{processors}} superseded the G-Machine 3650, 3620, and 3630 systems. The Ivory 390k transistor VLSI implementation designed in Symbolics Common Lisp using NS, a custom Symbolics Hardware Design Language (HDL), addressed a 40-bit word (8 bits tag, 32 bits data/address). Since it only addressed full words and not bytes or half-words, this allowed addressing of 4 Gigawords (GW) or 16 gigabytes (GB) of memory; {{the increase in}} address space reflected the growth of programs and data as semiconductor memory and disk space became cheaper. The Ivory processor had 8 bits of ECC attached to each word, so each word fetched from external memory to the chip was actually 48 bits wide. Each Ivory instruction was 18 bits wide and two instructions plus a 2-bit CDR code and 2-bit Data Type were in each instruction word fetched from memory. Fetching two instruction words at a time from memory enhanced the Ivory's performance. Unlike the 3600's microprogrammed architecture, the Ivory instruction set was still microcoded, but was stored in a 1200 x 180-bit ROM inside the Ivory chip. The initial Ivory processors were fabricated by VLSI Technology Inc in San Jose, California, on a 2 µm CMOS process, with later generations fabricated by Hewlett Packard in Corvallis, Oregon, on 1.25 µm and 1 µm CMOS processes. The Ivory had a stack architecture and operated a 4-stage pipeline: <b>Fetch,</b> <b>Decode,</b> <b>Execute</b> and Write Back. Ivory processors were marketed in stand-alone Lisp Machines (the XL400, XL1200, and XL1201), headless Lisp Machines (NXP1000), and on add-in cards for Sun Microsystems (UX400, UX1200) and Apple Macintosh (MacIvory I, II, III) computers. The Lisp Machines with Ivory processors operated at speeds that were between two and six times faster than a 3600 depending on the model and the revision of the Ivory chip.|$|R

Critical code is compiled to native code, and non-critical code is compiled to a very dense virtual instruction set which is executed on a highly optimized interpreter. The system employs dictionary-based compression by means of superinstructions which correspond to patterns of frequently used base instructions. The code compression system is designed for the Philips TriMedia VLIW processor. The interpreter is pipelined to achieve a high interpretation speed. The pipeline consists of three stages: <b>fetch,</b> <b>decode,</b> and <b>execute.</b> While one instruction is being executed, the next instruction is decoded, {{and the next one}} after that is fetched from memory. On a TriMedia VLIW with a load latency of three cycles and a jump latency of four cycles, the interpreter achieves a peak performance of four cycles per instruction and a sustained performance of 6. 27 cycles per instruction. Experiments are described that demonstrate the compression quality of the system and the execution speed of the pipelined interpreter; these were found to be about five times more compact than native TriMedia code and a slowdown of about eight times, respectively...|$|R
40|$|The phenomenal {{growth of}} the World Wide Web has {{resulted}} in the emergence and popularity of several information technology related computer applications. These applications are typically executed on computer systems that contain state-of-the-art superscalar microprocessors. Superscalar microprocessors can <b>fetch,</b> <b>decode,</b> and <b>execute</b> multiple instructions in each clock cycle. They contain multiple functional units and generally employ large caches. Most of these superscalar processors execute instructions in an order different from the instruction sequence that is fed to them.

With the aid of sophisticated branch predictors, they identify the potential path of program flow in order to find instructions to execute in advance. At times, the predictions are wrong and the processor nullifies the extra work that it speculatively performed. Most of the microprocessors that are executing today’s internet workloads were designed before the advent of these emerging workloads.

50|$|A {{less common}} but {{increasingly}} important paradigm of processors (and indeed, computing in general) deals with data parallelism. The processors discussed earlier are all {{referred to as}} some type of scalar device. As the name implies, vector processors deal with multiple pieces of data {{in the context of}} one instruction. This contrasts with scalar processors, which deal with one piece of data for every instruction. Using Flynn's taxonomy, these two schemes of dealing with data are generally referred to as single instruction stream, multiple data stream (SIMD) and single instruction stream, single data stream (SISD), respectively. The great utility in creating processors that deal with vectors of data lies in optimizing tasks that tend to require the same operation (for example, a sum or a dot product) to be performed on a large set of data. Some classic examples of these types of tasks include multimedia applications (images, video, and sound), as well as many types of scientific and engineering tasks. Whereas a scalar processor must complete the entire process of <b>fetching,</b> <b>decoding,</b> and <b>executing</b> each instruction and value in a set of data, a vector processor can perform a single operation on a comparatively large set of data with one instruction. Of course, this is only possible when the application tends to require many steps which apply one operation to a large set of data.|$|R

The network processors are in-charge of various complex functions such as routing, packet switching, queuing, encryption, decryption, pattern matching, computation and other such tasks. Many Pico processors work in parallel with the network processor, which leads to reduced computing time and improved performance (speed).
