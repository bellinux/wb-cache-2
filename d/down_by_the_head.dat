There was some doubt {{about whether or not}} she would hold together on refloating but she did, and she was repaired and returned to service. Her survival was attributed to her heavier than normal post World War II construction which had included provision for minesweeping gear and a deck gun in case she was ever requisitioned by the Admiralty for use in a future war.|$|E

40|$|A {{mechanism}} {{to connect the}} supporting portions of orthopaedic implants such as in <b>the</b> <b>head,</b> spine, upper limb and lower limb and thereby prevent loosening and fretting at the implant interface of an orthopaedic implant construct has been developed based on shape memory effect and super-elasticity of shape memory materials such as nickel-titanium (nitinol or NiTi) shape-memory-alloy, {{without the use of}} typical threaded fastening technique. Advantages are conferred <b>by</b> making <b>the</b> entire device, not just connecting pieces, out of shape memory alloy and having shape memory effect and super-elasticity. Heating <b>the</b> memory <b>head</b> of <b>the</b> device will compress the connection portion without the use of an auxiliary device (e. g. coupling member) so that the connection portion can be completely clamped <b>down</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> memory <b>head.</b> Further advantages are provided {{through the use of a}} two-way shape memory effect in which the memory device can be closed or tightened <b>by</b> heating up <b>the</b> ambient temperature, and re-opened <b>by</b> cooling <b>down</b> <b>the</b> temperature. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
25|$|In early January 1879, O noapte furtunoasă {{was first}} staged <b>by</b> <b>the</b> National Theater. Its {{production}} brought the first association between Caragiale and comedian Mihai Mateescu, {{who went on}} to portray some of his most popular characters.

Caragiale was soon outraged to discover that, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> second staging, his text had been toned <b>down</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> government-appointed <b>Head</b> of Theaters, <b>the</b> National Liberal Ion Ghica.

60|$|I {{immediately}} procured a {{horse and}} started for the country, taking no baggage with me, of course. There is an insignificant creek--the Gravois--between Jefferson Barracks and the place to which I was going, and at that day there was not a bridge over it from its source to its mouth. There is not water enough in the creek at ordinary stages to run a coffee mill, and at low water there is none running whatever. On this occasion it had been raining heavily, and, when the creek was reached, I found the banks full to overflowing, and the current rapid. I looked at it a moment to consider what to do. One of my superstitions had always been when I started to go any where, or to do anything, not to turn back, or stop until the thing intended was accomplished. I have frequently started to go to places where I had never been and to which I did not know the way, depending upon making inquiries on the road, and if I got past the place without knowing it, instead of turning back, I would go on until a road was found turning in the right direction, take that, and come in <b>by</b> <b>the</b> other side. So I struck into the stream, and in an instant the horse was swimming and I being carried <b>down</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> current. I <b>headed</b> <b>the</b> horse towards the other bank and soon reached it, wet through and without other clothes {{on that side of the}} stream. I went on, however, to my destination and borrowed a dry suit from my --future--brother-in-law. We were not of the same size, but the clothes answered every purpose until I got more of my own.|$|R
50|$|The final race {{started with}} the tall Venezuelan Alberth Bravo taking a {{commanding}} lead, making up the stagger on the diminutive Renny Quow from Trinidad and Tobago to his outside. Reality set in on the home stretch, Quow holding form on a more evenly paced race while Bravo tied up. TTO passed first while Bravo ended up passing last to a flat footed José Meléndez. Michael Mathieu sped through the turn to put Bahamas in the lead at the break. Jarrin Solomon and Adrian Chacón had TTO and Cuba fall in behind, putting a gap on USA leading {{the rest of the}} field. As they battled on the final straightaway, James Harris bridged the gap to make it a four team breakaway at the handoff. With Bahamas (Alonzo Russell) and Cuba (Osmaidel Pellicier) battling for the lead, Marcus Chambers fell off the back for USA on the backstretch while hurdler Emanuel Mayers for TTO tied up at the finish, allowing USA to hand off third well behind the leaders. Bahamas had a two metre lead at the handoff, which Jeffery Gibson quickly extended to five through the turn. Another five metres back Machel Cedenio used his inside position to get the jump on American hurdler Kerron Clement. Down the backstretch and through the final turn, Cuba's Yoandys Lescay slowly whittled <b>down</b> Gibson's lead. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> of <b>the</b> stretch it was down to a metre, with Cedenio and Clement 8 metres back. Coming off the turn Lescay moved into lane 2 and eased past Gibson, whose strides noticibly shortened. Behind them, Cedenio came off the turn wide into lane 2, with Clement looking to take advantage accelerating on his inside. Instead, Cedenio exploded into a different gear, sprinting {{while the rest of the}} runners were trying to maintain their stride. In 60 metres he made up the gap on Lescay, passing him 8 metres before the finish for the Trinidad and Tobago win. Clement followed Cedenio, passing the struggling Gibson for bronze but still four metres behind Lescay.|$|R
