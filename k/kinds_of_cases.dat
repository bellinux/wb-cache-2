5|$|Some {{academic}} researchers {{argue that}} the actual efficacy of SJS is obscured by poor research methodology. Specifically, demographic characteristics used to predict juror attitudes and juror verdicts may not hold true across all <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases.</b> For example, men convict more frequently than women in some types of criminal trials but less frequently in others. Besides this, demographic characteristics are often less predictive than the attitudes jurors hold; for example, attitudes towards rape are better verdict-predictors than gender in rape trials.|$|E

25|$|The Mishnah and Talmud {{distinguish}} between ritual or criminal matters and monetary matters (issurim and mamonoth) and impose different regulations for them, with criminal cases generally having much more stringent limitations. Courts ruled in both <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases.</b> Any question {{that could not}} be resolved by a smaller court was passed up to a higher court. If the Sanhedrin was still uncertain, divine opinion was sought through the Urim ve-Tumim (the parchment in the High Priest's breastplate, which was inscribed with the Name of God and could give supernatural clues).|$|E
500|$|Competition, for Russell, is a {{word that}} may have many uses. Although most often meant to refer to {{competition}} between companies, it may also be used to speak of competition between states, between ideologues, between classes, rivals, trusts, workers, etc. On this topic, Russell ultimately wishes to answer two questions: [...] "First, in what <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> is competition technically wasteful? Secondly, in what cases is it desirable on non-technical grounds?" [...] (Russell 1938:176). In asking these questions, he has two concerns directly in mind: economic competition, and the competition of propaganda.|$|E
500|$|The eleven {{numbered}} circuit {{courts of}} appeals and the District of Columbia Circuit have appellate jurisdiction over cases {{in almost every}} area of the law arising {{within the boundaries of}} that circuit. However, the subjects that appear more frequently in each circuit vary according to the <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> that arise more often within the circuit's boundaries. The District of Columbia Circuit, for example, hears a large number of administrative law cases. Likewise, the Second Circuit hears nearly one third of all federal securities law appeals, and the Fifth Circuit hears approximately one half of all federal immigration appeals. Eric Hansford argues that this has led to [...] "specialized" [...] courts with particular expertise with the subjects that appear before the court more frequently. Studies also suggest that the Supreme Court is more likely to affirm decisions of circuit courts when the circuit court has ruled on a case for which they possess special expertise.|$|E
5000|$|There are two <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> {{judges in}} the circuit court: circuit judges and {{associate}} judges. Circuit judges are elected for six years, may be retained by voters for additional six-year terms, and can hear any <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>case.</b> Circuit judges are elected on a circuit-wide basis or from the county where they reside.|$|R

2500|$|In the United States, {{parallel}} {{systems of}} law (providing money damages, with cases heard {{by a jury}} upon either party's request) and equity (fashioning a remedy to fit the situation, including injunctive relief, heard by a judge) survived well into the 20th century. The United States federal courts procedurally separated law and equity: the same judges could hear either kind of case, but a given case could only pursue causes in law or in equity, and the two <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> proceeded under different procedural rules. This became problematic when a given case required both money damages and injunctive relief. In 1937, the new Federal Rules of Civil Procedure combined law and equity into one form of action, the [...] "civil action." [...] Fed.R.Civ.P[...] The distinction survives {{to the extent that}} issues that were [...] "common law (as opposed to equity)" [...] as of 1791 (the date of adoption of the Seventh Amendment) are still subject to the right of either party to request a jury, and [...] "equity" [...] issues are decided by a judge.|$|E

60|$|Another {{respect in}} which Bergson's {{statement}} of causation is inadequate {{is in its}} assumption that the cause must be one event, whereas it may be two or more events, or even some continuous process. The substantive question at issue is whether mental events {{are determined by the}} past. Now in such a case as the repeated reading of a poem, it is obvious that our feelings in reading the poem are most emphatically dependent upon the past, but not upon one single event in the past. All our previous readings of the poem must be included in the cause. But we easily perceive a certain law according to which the effect varies as the previous readings increase in number, and in fact Bergson himself tacitly assumes such a law. We decide at last not to read the poem again, because we know that this time the effect would be boredom. We may not know all the niceties and shades of the boredom we should feel, but we know enough to guide our decision, and the prophecy of boredom is none the less true for being more or less general. Thus the <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> upon which Bergson relies are insufficient to show the impossibility of prediction in the only sense in which prediction has practical or emotional interest. We may therefore leave the consideration of his arguments and address ourselves to the problem directly.|$|E
