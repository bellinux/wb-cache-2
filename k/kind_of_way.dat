Hill:Seeing so many of the European films, Japanese films, I was part of this isolated community in east Hollywood. I remembered thinking just a little further west they are making the films I want to see. I'm going to do this. Sink or swim... I wanted to be a writer on my way to being a director. Directors were already my heroes. Kurosawa, number of Italian directors... Movies from England, France, Sweden, Italy. Poland...

I was tremendously interested in genre films. Wanted to work within genre films.|$|E

[...] Hartman claimed that he borrowed his style from actor Bill Murray: [...] "He's been a great influence on me – when he did that smarmy thing in Ghostbusters, then {{the same sort of}} thing in Groundhog Day.

Key said that the songs have [...] "lost that adolescent bounciness -- they've come into adulthood a bit". In an interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Key revealed that during the time he and Mosely spent in New York, he said it [...] "brought out some darker places" [...] in them and that it was [...] "not in a 'now I'm going to start wearing eyeliner' <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>way,</b> but emotionally darker."

The review added, [...] "It's squeaky and clean sounding in a sugary, fluff <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>way,</b> {{almost as if it}} were a song recorded by Janet years ago and recently rediscovered. And you know what? It's cool because of that." [...] Aaron Foley of MLive considered it Jackson's fourth most underrated single, calling it among [...] "the fruits from that era that don't get the respect they deserve". Foley added, that after Jackson's Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy, [...] "I Want You" [...] "got lost in the wash.

Hammond commended Madsen as the film [...] "achieves a sense of psychological complexity– and a pervasive atmosphere of fear and confusion– without sacrificing the rhythm and dramatic tension necessary to a war film". Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised its combination of [...] "sharp scenes of moral inquiry with {{a few too many}} functional, oldfangled espionage twists". Fuchs applauded the interpolation of emotional relations as they [...] "help to make Flame & Citrons taut action even more effective. Beautifully choreographed and filmed in deep shadows that cut the violence into shadowy, brutal fragments, Flame and Citron's jobs are at once thrilling and disconcerting". Kate Taylor from The Globe and Mail, however, said the romantic relationship, [...] "predictable in a James Bond <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>way,</b> is the weakest link in the script".|$|E

[...] To reflect his transition into adulthood and the changes in his music, Songz changed his appearance by cutting off his trademark braids. Songz also began dressing in more sophisticated attire, trading in sneakers and T-shirts for vests, tailored pants, and [...] "tasteful" [...] shoes. On the appearance change, Songz's mentor, producer, {{and the head of}} Songbook Entertainment, Troy Taylor said, [...] "Trey's from the streets, he's a hood kid. He wasn't glamorous and (didn't have) the finer things in life growing up, [...] He didn't want to lose his street-ism, [...] As he grew into it I think he began to realize, 'Wait a minute, this ain't that bad after all,' and then he got the ladies' opinions." ...|$|E

[...] Decades passed before she began to trust white people. Some families spoke of Rosewood, but forbade the stories from being told: Arnett Doctor heard the story from his mother, Philomena Goins Doctor, who was with Sarah Carrier the day Fannie Taylor claimed she was assaulted, and was in the house with Sylvester Carrier. She told her children about Rosewood every Christmas. Doctor was consumed by his mother's story; he would bring it up to his aunts only to be dissuaded from speaking of it.|$|E

[...] Gerard O'Donovan of The Telegraph thought that the series [...] "proved thoroughly entertaining", and praised Wolstencroft's writing, which O'Donovan felt was [...] "confident enough to be playful with its subject – especially regarding Britain's poor-relation relationship with America." [...] Alison Graham of the Radio Times called the first series [...] "a tremendous pieces of hokum, which is only slightly po-faced (but in a knowing <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>way)</b> and which manages to stay just on the right side of self-parody."
