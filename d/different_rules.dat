5|$|Field {{lacrosse}} is a {{full contact}} outdoor men's sport played with ten players on each team. The sport originated among Native Americans, and the modern rules of field lacrosse were initially codified by Canadian William George Beers in 1867. Field lacrosse {{is one of three}} major versions of lacrosse played internationally. The other versions, women's lacrosse (established in the 1890s) and box lacrosse (which originated in the 1930s), are played under significantly <b>different</b> <b>rules.</b>|$|E
5|$|The aerial {{rules of}} {{engagement}} applied in Laos (which prescribed the offensive action of pilots and the locations and circumstances under which offensive actions could be taken) were created to protect the civilian population of the country. To the American pilots that conducted the missions, however, they became complex {{to the point of}} incomprehensibility. The rules were constantly altered and elaborated upon by the political decision makers in Washington and Vientiane and bore little relation to the reality on the ground. There were <b>different</b> <b>rules</b> for every type of activity, for each different branch of service, and in each military region.|$|E
5|$|The 1904 Tour de France was {{the second}} Tour de France, held from 2 to 24 July. With a route similar to its {{previous}} edition, 1903 Tour de France winner Maurice Garin seemed to have repeated his win by a small margin over Lucien Pothier, while Hippolyte Aucouturier won {{four of the six}} stages. But the race became a victim of its own success, plagued by scandals; cyclists were accused of having taken trains during the race. Twelve cyclists, including the first four of the final classification and all stage winners, were disqualified by the Union Vélocipédique Française (UVF). Henri Cornet, originally the fifth-place finisher, was awarded the victory four months after the race. The problems caused the Tour de France to be provisionally cancelled, and subsequently the 1905 Tour de France was run with <b>different</b> <b>rules</b> from the 1903 and 1904 edition.|$|E

25|$|The sanctioning {{bodies have}} {{slightly}} <b>different</b> <b>rules</b> for qualifications of advancement in races between skill levels and age classification. For instance the ABA and the NBL uses <b>different</b> <b>rules</b> of qualifying for mains from the motos. The ABA uses almost an {{all or nothing}} system called the Transfer System while the NBL uses a cumulative scoring scheme called the Moto System.|$|E

We perform several simulation experiments to evaluate the performance trade-offs yielded by different execution semantics in various operating conditions. In particular, we evaluate the eflect of executing transaction and rule statements that affect a varying number of data instances, and applications with <b>different</b> <b>rule</b> triggering breadth and depth. Since references to data changed by the database operation triggering the rules are commonly used in active rule programming, we also analyze the impact of its management on overall performance. 1...|$|R
25|$|In some cases, a {{claim for}} {{misrepresentation}} in contract, may also in parallel, be grounds for an action for deceit in tort, which has <b>different</b> <b>rules</b> and a different basis for damages.|$|E
25|$|Although {{these are}} the laws as laid down by FIDE and, as such, are used at almost all {{top-level}} tournaments, at lower levels <b>different</b> <b>rules</b> may operate, {{particularly with regard to}} rapid play finish provisions.|$|E
25|$|As the {{popularity}} of the pinewood derby grew, other organizations adopted the concept. Pinewood derby is a registered trademark of the BSA, so most use different names. Each derby has slightly <b>different</b> <b>rules</b> for making and racing their cars.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} <b>different</b> <b>rule</b> sets for Kriegspiel. The most {{widespread}} rules are those {{used on the}} Internet Chess Club, where Kriegspiel is called Wild 16. The rules are as follows.|$|R

25|$|Different {{countries}} have <b>different</b> <b>rules</b> regarding maternity leave, paternity leave and parental leave.

25|$|A lead {{may be of}} one of four types, {{each with}} <b>different</b> <b>rules</b> dealing with what can be played on it. As a rule of thumb, when any card or {{combination}} of cards is lead, other players must always follow the number of card(s) played.|$|E
25|$|If all virtual servers {{belong to}} the same domain, a {{wildcard}} certificate can be used. Besides the loose host name selection that might be a problem or not, there is no common agreement about how to match wildcard certificates. <b>Different</b> <b>rules</b> are applied depending on the application protocol or software used.|$|E
50|$|But a <b>different</b> <b>rule</b> applies for {{applying}} the let expression to itself. Note that the let expression does not restrict {{the scope of}} the variable x, so x is the same variable in the two let expressions.|$|R
30|$|<b>Different</b> {{scheduling}} <b>rules</b> produce <b>different</b> performances or {{complexity of}} line-seru conversion. Up to now, {{the influences of}} scheduling rules to line-seru conversion are not investigated yet. Therefore, one objective {{of this study is}} to clarify the influence of <b>different</b> scheduling <b>rules</b> to complexity of line-seru conversion. Since the complexity of seru formation is independent of scheduling rule, we focus on clarifying the influence of <b>different</b> scheduling <b>rules</b> to complexity of seru load.|$|R
50|$|This {{triangle}} may {{be constructed}} similarly {{to the original}} version of Bell's triangle, but with a <b>different</b> <b>rule</b> for starting each row: the leftmost value in each row is the difference of the rightmost and leftmost values of the previous row.|$|R
25|$|Whereas in the past, the National and American leagues had {{separate}} administrative organizations (which, for example, {{allowed for}} the introduction of <b>different</b> <b>rules</b> such as the designated hitter), under Selig, Major League Baseball consolidated the administrative functions of both leagues into the Commissioner's Office in 2000. The last official presidents of the NL and AL were Leonard S. Coleman Jr. and Dr. Gene Budig respectively.|$|E
25|$|A {{detonation}} wave follows slightly <b>different</b> <b>rules</b> from an ordinary shock {{since it is}} driven by the chemical reaction occurring behind the shock wavefront. In the simplest theory for detonations, an unsupported, self-propagating {{detonation wave}} proceeds at the Chapman-Jouguet flow velocity. A detonation will also cause a shock of type 1, above to propagate into the surrounding air due to the overpressure induced by the explosion.|$|E
25|$|Although main group {{elements}} of the second period and beyond usually react by gaining, losing, or sharing electrons until they have achieved a valence shell electron configuration with a full octet of (8) electrons, other elements obey <b>different</b> <b>rules.</b> Hydrogen (H) can only form bonds which share just two electrons, while transition metals often conform to a duodectet (12) rule (e.g., compounds such as the permanganate ion).|$|E
5000|$|Reasoning that, Previously (1st appeal), it was {{the opinion}} that the {{complaint}} stated a cause of action ex contractu of contract and not ex delicto of tort. Governed by a <b>different</b> <b>rule</b> of damages, the previous case rules {{on the question of}} damages.|$|R
30|$|With {{the purpose}} of mining multiobjective rare {{association}} rule, only few {{attempts have been made}} in the literature. The first one by Hoque et al. [56] in their algorithm FRIMA and the second one being the RP-Tree algorithm developed by Tsang et al. [146]. In case of FRIMA, in addition to support and confidence parameters, comprehensibility and interestingness are also used to measure the quality of a rule. RP-Tree employed seven <b>different</b> <b>rule</b> interestingness measures to gauge the quality of the rare rules generated. To obtain significant interesting rare rules, there is a need to employ <b>different</b> <b>rule</b> interestingness measures, instead of sticking to the mere ‘support-confidence framework’. The rare association rule generation algorithms must extend their concept of <b>rule</b> quality to <b>different</b> interestingness parameters.|$|R
25|$|NASCAR {{issues a}} <b>different</b> <b>rule</b> book for each racing series; however, rule books are {{published}} exclusively for NASCAR members {{and are not}} {{made available to the}} public. Still, many of the rules, such as the scoring system, have been widely publicized both by NASCAR and the media.|$|R
