40|$|The {{present study}} reports four {{new species of}} the Family Lumbrineridae Schmarda, 1861, three in the genus Lumbrineris de Blainville, 1828 {{and one in the}} genus Gallardoneris Carrera-Parra, 2006. The new species were found on the Portuguese {{continental}} shelf at water depths ranging from 11 to 190 m. Gallardoneris iberica sp. nov. is the first record of this genus in the Atlantic Ocean and can be distinguished from the other two known Gallardoneris species by the distribution of the composite and the simple multidentate hooded hooks and the shape of the parapodial lobes. Lumbrineris luciliae sp. nov. has an arcuate, unidentate MIII and MIV unidentate with well-developed plate, digitiform wide basally postchaetal lobes in anterior parapodia, composite multidentate hooded <b>hooks</b> <b>with</b> short blade. Furthermore, L. luciliae sp. nov. has simple multidentate hooded hooks of two sizes, preacicular hook twice as big as postacicular hook, and distally curved aciculae in median and posterior parapodia. Both Lumbrineris lusitanica sp. nov. and Lumbrineris pinaster sp. nov. are characterized by having MIII unidentate followed by a knob. However, L. lusitanica sp. nov. has digitiform wide basally postchaetal lobes in the anterior parapodia, composite multidentate hooded <b>hooks</b> <b>with</b> short blade and simple multidentate hooded <b>hooks</b> <b>with</b> short hood; while L. pinaster sp. nov. has auricular postchaetal lobes in the anterior parapodia, composite multidentate hooded <b>hooks</b> <b>with</b> long blade, and simple multidentate hooded <b>hooks</b> <b>with</b> short and long hood.
