40|$|Fiscal {{sponsorship}} is {{an emerging}} {{trend in the}} nonprofit organizational landscape. Fiscal sponsorship refers {{to the practice of}} nonprofit organizations offering their legal and tax-exempt status to groups engaged in activities related to the organizations' missions.

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} multiple indirect Big Five personality influences on professionals’ annual salary while considering relevant mediators. These are the motivational variables of occupational self-efficacy and career-advancement goals, and the work status variable of <b>contractual</b> <b>work</b> hours. The motivational and work status variables were conceptualized as serial mediators (Big Five → occupational self-efficacy/career-advancement goals → <b>contractual</b> <b>work</b> hours → annual salary). Design/Methodology/Approach We realized a 4 year longitudinal survey study with 432 participants and three points of measurement. We assessed personality prior to the mediators and the mediators prior to annual salary. Findings Results showed that except for openness the other Big Five personality traits exerted indirect influences on annual salary. Career-advancement goals mediated influences of conscientiousness (+), extraversion (+), and agreeableness (−). Occupational self-efficacy mediated influences of neuroticism (–) and conscientiousness (+). Because the influence of occupational self-efficacy on annual salary was fully mediated by <b>contractual</b> <b>work</b> hours, indirect personality influences via occupational self-efficacy always included <b>contractual</b> <b>work</b> hours in a serial mediation. Implications These findings underline the importance of distal personality traits for career success. They give further insights into direct and indirect relationships between personality, goal content, self-efficacy beliefs, and an individual’s career progress. Originality/Value Previous research predominantly investigated direct Big Five influences on salary, and it analyzed cross-sectional data. This study is one of the first to investigate multiple indirect Big Five influences on salary in a longitudinal design. The findings support process-oriented theories of personality influences on career outcomes...|$|R

40|$|Do {{paid work}} {{activities}} displace volunteering? A potential explanation from role overload theory Recent changes in Dutch society {{might lead to}} a shortage of volunteers. On the one hand, the demand for volunteers is increasing: in the social welfare domain because of governmental austerity policies and in other domains such as sports because of the higher supervision intensity of activities. On the other hand, the supply of volunteers is likely to decrease as more and more women and older workers are active in the labor market, which reduces the time that is available for volunteering. Role overload theory would suggest that the increasing labor participation rate of certain categories of workers goes along with a decline of participation in voluntary work. The secondary data analysis shows that various role loads (work, care for children living at home) are associated with differences in participation in voluntary work. However, while a higher number of <b>contractual</b> <b>work</b> hours and hours spent on work-related training are negatively associated with volunteer work, care for children living at home is positively associated with volunteering. These results provide only limited support for role overload theory...|$|R

Called Tele-snaps, these photographs constitute an archive of British television from a period where only a limited quantity of programme material survives. Based on papers relating to Cura's work, available in the BBC's Written Archive Centre, the article details the development of Cura's relationship with the BBC as a freelancer, from his speculative attempts at securing clients in the late 1940 s to his long-standing <b>contractual</b> <b>work</b> with production offices throughout the 1950 s and 1960 s.

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this paper is to report a study of the role of internships for IT {{students}} and for the IT sector. The contribution of internships for career-readiness, and for the development of existing IT organisations and the creation of new ones is explored. Design/methodology/approach Surveys of interns and managers from host firms were conduced, followed by in-depth interviews with six interns and five organisations. Findings Internships are useful for increasing enterprise and employability skills and commercial awareness for IT students. IT organisations also benefit in that internships are used to recruit fresh talent. Findings regarding entrepreneurship were disappointing, with little reportage of ambitions to create new firms, nor awareness of the high likelihood of self-employed <b>contractual</b> <b>work</b> in the sector. Research limitations/implications Implications for research include that self-employment and business ownership are not always “successful” entrepreneurial outcomes born of agency. This requires further study. Practical implications Development of opportunities for experiential, real-world learning for IT students is implied, as is increased educational focus on employability and enterprise skills to best advantage students for the realities of employment in IT. There is a strong suggestion that much more needs to be done in terms of encouraging entrepreneurship.

40|$|Shipbuilding, {{being one}} of the oldest {{industries}} in the world, consists of more than just of building a ship. Many yards around the world design, build, test and repair ships. And even one project to build a ship consists of several lengthy stages. Going through these stages requires different background and expertise. Even though there are two main parties, the buyer and the builder, the success of a final “product” will also depend on professionalism and efforts of many other parties. When it comes to performance of a shipbuilding contract, in many cases the builder won’t be able to undertake all <b>contractual</b> <b>works</b> all by himself. Therefore he will have to subcontract a portion of <b>contractual</b> <b>works.</b> There might be several different reasons to subcontract a part of project. For instance, the shipbuilding project is too big and the yard has no capacity or resources, so {{there is a need to}} create an organization at minimal cost. Or perhaps the yard have the capacity, but some parts of project are too costly, and it is reasonable to find a cheaper yard. In Norway shipbuilding is an important branch of maritime activity. Norwegian shipbuilding industry is characterized as technologically innovative and professional, and this makes it adaptable and internationally competitive. However, Norwegian shipbuilding industry is also marked by costly production and high wage rates. In particularly it concerns hulls – that is the most costly and time consuming part of construction. Therefore Norwegian yards prefer to subcontract hull building to cheaper yards abroad. This is where the analysis of this thesis starts. Even though the building of a new ship is just one of ways to acquire a vessel, it is the most expensive way. Therefore the buyer is very precise in choosing a builder. Although the question regarding the price of a vessel is important, the yard’s reputation and experience are also major factors in this decision. This leads to a situation that when it comes to the subcontracting of a major part of construction works to another yard, the buyer might be not willing to allow this predicating, for example, on uncertain reliability of the subcontractor or any other reason. However, if the parties to a shipbuilding contract have agreement regarding subcontracting, then they have to accept the fact that a certain complexity is added to their legal relation. The builder and the subcontractor are parties to a contract which is secondary to the prime shipbuilding contract. Although the builder decides to subcontract on the grounds that are beneficial to him, his position in the whole shipbuilding project becomes rather more difficult. At the same moment when he signs the subcontract, he becomes responsible for the work of another yard, and this makes him dependent from the professionalism of the subcontractor’s specialists. If the subcontractor undertakes to perform a major part of construction work, his failure might mean huge losses to the builder. The buyer’s position with regard to subcontracting becomes more complex as well. As long as the work is performed according to the contract and there is no negligence on the part of the subcontractor, no problems arise. However, defects or negligence are not unusual in this kind of projects and the buyer might be in need of protection...|$|R
