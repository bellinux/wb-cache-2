40|$|Abstract. This paper investigates {{a number}} of {{techniques}} and services around a unifying concept: the secondary screen. Far too often television consumption is considered a passive activity. While there are specific genres and programs that immerse the viewer into the media experi-ence, there are other times in which whilst watching television, people talk, scan the program guide, record another program or recommend a program by phone. This paper identifies four major usages of the sec-ondary screen in an interactive digital television environment: control, enrich, share, and transfer television content. By control we refer to the decoupling of the television stream, optional enhanced content, and tele-vision controls. Moreover, the user can use the secondary screen to enrich or author media content by, for example, including personalized media overlays such as an audio commentary that can be shared with his peer group. Finally, the secondary screen {{can be used to}} bring along the televi-sion content. This paper reviews previous work on the secondary screen, identifies the <b>key</b> <b>usages,</b> and based on a working system provides the ex-periences of developing relevant scenarios as well as an initial evaluation of them. ...|$|R

This rhythm dominated most of the Fourth Symphony and was practically nonexistent in the Fifth Symphony but becomes {{nothing short of a}} driving force in the Sixth Symphony; the metric complexities generated by this unique rhythmic grouping are more pronounced in the first movement of the Sixth Symphony than in any of Bruckner's other compositions.|$|E
50|$|MACs {{differ from}} digital {{signatures}} as MAC values are both generated and verified {{using the same}} secret key. This implies that the sender and receiver of a message must agree on the same key before initiating communications, {{as is the case}} with symmetric encryption. For the same reason, MACs do not provide the property of non-repudiation offered by signatures specifically in the case of a network-wide shared secret key: any user who can verify a MAC is also capable of generating MACs for other messages. In contrast, a digital signature is generated using the private key of a key pair, which is public-key cryptography. Since this private key is only accessible to its holder, a digital signature proves that a document was signed by none other than that holder. Thus, digital signatures do offer non-repudiation. However, non-repudiation can be provided by systems that securely bind <b>key</b> <b>usage</b> information to the MAC key; the same key is in the possession of two people, but one has a copy of the key that can be used for MAC generation while the other has a copy of the key in a hardware security module that only permits MAC verification.

40|$|During {{the last}} ten years, the {{presence}} of sensor networks in common life has become pervasive and sensor nodes are currently used {{in many areas of}} interest. One of the most common radio communication protocol designed for Personal Area Network (PAN) is described by the IEEE 802. 15. 4 standard, according to which data communication among devices can also be protected on a per frame basis, so making it possible to assure data authenticity and confidentiality, and security mechanisms can be configured in a flexible and effective way. In this thesis work, the IEEE 802. 15. 4 security sublayer has been implemented. In particular, the TinyOS implementation for the tmote sky mote and the CC 2420 chipset have been considered. The main goal of this work is to extend the above mentioned MAC layer implementation {{in order to make the}} IEEE 802. 15. 4 security mechanisms available, that is sending and receiving both ciphered and authenticated frames, by means of the security features provided by the CC 2420 chipset. All security data structures and procedures have been implemented, so making it possible to deal with different cryptographic <b>keys</b> <b>usage</b> and retrieval modes. During the development phase, some problems strictly related to computational and memory capacity shortage have been faced and properly addressed. Finally, the implemented security sublayer has been tested and evaluated by means of a simple application, which sends secured packets whose payload changes both in content and size...|$|R

In Cooper's novels The Pioneers (published in 1823) and The Last of the Mohicans (1826), both Native American and white characters use the term. These novels were widely distributed, and can be credited with bringing the term to [...] "universal notice" [...] and notes that the first time the term appears in Bartlett's [...] "Dictionary of Americanisms" [...] (in 1858) the illustrative reference is to Last of the Mohicans.|$|E
