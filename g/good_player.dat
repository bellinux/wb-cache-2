5|$|Samaras {{is also a}} good dribbler. This is due to his skill, quick {{feet and}} agility. He uses this to his {{advantage}} as often goes on runs where he beats several opposition players. However, he can sometimes hold onto the ball for too long and get tackled. As well as his dribbling ability, he is quick which means he can beat players with his pace. He can also use his strength to beat players as well and is also able to use his creativity to set up goals for other players. While he was at Manchester City, Eriksson said that he would only retain him in the side if he stopped dribbling and running out wide. Eriksson said that he believed Samaras to be a good header of the ball and he had to stop believing he was like Ronaldinho if he was to become a <b>good</b> <b>player.</b>|$|E

25|$|One of {{the great}} {{strengths}} of the team was its plentiful all-rounders, apart from Keith Miller, there was Ray Lindwall, Colin McCool, Ian Johnson and the wicketkeeper Don Tallon. Lindwall took to fast bowling after seeing Harold Larwood as a boy, but was a strong striker of the ball and a menace to parked cars in grade cricket. In the Third Test he hit exactly 100 off 90 balls with 14 fours and a six and added 154 {{in an hour and}} a half with Tallon, whose 92 off 108 balls with 10 fours was the highest score by an Australian wicketkeeper until Rod Marsh made 132 against New Zealand in 1973–74. Like Tallon Ian Johnson never quite batted as well as expected, but topped the averages in the 1954-55 Ashes series by making 116 runs (58.00). McCool made 95 in the First Test and 104 not out in the Third, when he came in at 188/5 and dominated the strike. He was a <b>good</b> <b>player</b> of spin with wristy cuts and vigorous hooks.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} Surrey captain, Lord Dalmeny, assumed {{control of}} the team for the following match against Essex, the club's opening County Championship match, beginning on 4 May. Hobbs retained his place and scored 155 runs in around three hours during Surrey's second innings. Hobbs later held the catch which won the game for Surrey and he was cheered from the ground by the crowd. Lord Dalmeny awarded Hobbs his County Cap as the players left the field; it was very unusual for a player to be awarded a cap so quickly. Press reports over the following days recognised that he was potentially a very <b>good</b> <b>player.</b> Hobbs maintained his form over the following weeks; he scored another century against Essex and hit 94 runs against the touring Australian cricket team. However, {{from the beginning of}} June he was generally less successful. Although he scored 75 not out against Middlesex and 58 in a second match against the Australians, his next best score in the remainder of the season was 38. He struggled to cope with a variety of bowlers and began to despair of scoring runs. The fatigue of playing cricket up to six days each week affected his batting, while in contrast to his subsequent career, his fielding was criticised by spectators and journalists. To attempt to recapture his form, Surrey tried Hobbs in different positions in the batting order and occasionally left him out of the side, but nothing helped.|$|E

A Key Distribution Center of a network is a server enabling private communications within groups of users. A Distributed Key Distribution Center is a set of servers that jointly realizes a Key Distribution Center. In this paper we build a robust Distributed Key Distribution Center Scheme secure against active and mobile adversary. We consider a general access structure for the set of servers and for the adversary access structure. We also revise the unconditionally secure Verifiable Secret Sharing Schemes from [11, 10, 20, 23] proposing a modified version which is proactively secure. ...|$|R

25|$|Having {{overcome}} initial {{reservations about}} leaving {{his wife and}} newly-born son, Hobbs accepted the invitation but throughout the voyage to Australia was severely affected by sea-sickness, a condition which was to afflict him throughout his life. To allow him to recover from his illness upon arrival in Australia, Hobbs missed {{the first two games}} of the tour, but once recovered, he played in only two of the remaining four fixtures before the Test series began. Hobbs later expressed the belief that the MCC captain, Arthur Jones was instrumental in his omission from the team as he did not rate Hobbs a <b>good</b> <b>player.</b> He also believed that Jones did not {{give him a chance to}} prove himself. But Hobbs failed with the bat on his two appearances and was subsequently left out of the team for the first Test match. Even when Jones was taken ill before the game started, George Gunn, not a member of the touring team but present in Australia, was preferred to Hobbs and scored a century in the game. However, England lost the game and the performance of the amateur wicketkeeper and makeshift opening batsman Dick Young was singled out as detrimental to the team. Following effective batting performances by Hobbs in two matches after the Test, Frederick Fane, the stand-in England captain, chose Hobbs to open the batting in the second Test. He made his Test debut on 1 January 1908 at Melbourne. He went in to bat on the second day after Australia had scored 266; in 182 minutes, he scored 83 runs in his first innings and although he batted more slowly than usual, critics praised his defence. Eventually, England needed 282 to win. Hobbs and Fane added 54 for the first wicket; before Hobbs fell for 28 but England went on to win the match by one wicket.|$|E

Verifiable secret sharing schemes (VSS) are secret sharing schemes (SSS) dealing with possible cheating by participants. In this paper we use the VSS proposed by Cramer, Damgard and Maurer [6, 7, 5]. They introduced a purely linear algebraic method to transform monotone span program (MSP) based secret sharing schemes into VSS. In fact, the monotone span program model of Karchmer and Wigderson [14] deals with arbitrary monotone access structures and not just threshold ones. Stinson and Wei [17] proposed a proactive SSS based on threshold (polynomial) VSS. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to build unconditionally secure proactive SSS over any access structure, as long as it admits a linear secret sharing scheme (LSSS). ...|$|R
