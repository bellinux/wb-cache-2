5|$|The game {{starts with}} an opening crawl {{resembling}} the ones {{featured in the}} Star Wars films. Further story details are presented through the game's instruction manual, pre-mission briefings, characters' conversations during the game and in-game cut scenes. During the Trade Federation's initial invasion of Theed, Lieutenant Gavyn Sykes and Captain Kael are able to escape the capital and head into the surrounding farmland. The two attempt to protect civilian farmers, but Federation presence <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>strong,</b> and they retreat into the nearby swamps. There they learn of a smuggler hidden in the mountains who might aid them. With the help of farmer Ved Deviss, Sykes and Kael find Borvo the Hutt. Borvo agrees to assist the resistance movement against the Trade Federation after the group helps him escape Federation forces.|$|E
5|$|The typical summer {{weather pattern}} is for heat-produced thermals, powered {{by either the}} Gulf or Atlantic sea breeze (and {{occasionally}} both simultaneously), to build puffy white cumulus clouds into threatening thunderheads over {{the interior of the}} Florida peninsula. Usually, the resulting storms drift slowly westward to the bay area, though they may rain themselves out before reaching Tampa if the easterly winds are light or the sea breeze from the Gulf of Mexico <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>strong.</b> Occasionally, the storms survive to move out over the Gulf of Mexico, where they can be seen at night from the beaches as spectacular light shows. Nighttime storms offshore are driven by the land-breeze front which is the dermal counterpart of the daytime sea-breeze front.|$|E
5|$|Without seismic data or {{knowledge}} of its moment of inertia, little direct {{information is available}} about the internal structure and geochemistry of Venus. The similarity in size and density between Venus and Earth suggests they share a similar internal structure: a core, mantle, and crust. Like that of Earth, the Venusian core is at least partially liquid because the two planets have been cooling {{at about the same}} rate. The slightly smaller size of Venus means pressures are 24% lower in its deep interior than Earth's. The principal difference between the two planets is the lack of evidence for plate tectonics on Venus, possibly because its crust <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>strong</b> to subduct without water to make it less viscous. This results in reduced heat loss from the planet, preventing it from cooling and providing a likely explanation for its lack of an internally generated magnetic field.|$|E
60|$|Finding {{that the}} French {{position}} <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>strong</b> to <b>be</b> attacked, Forde fell {{back to a}} strong position at Chambol, a village nearly four miles from the French camp. Here, for four days, the two armies remained watching each other, the leaders of both sides considering that {{the position of the}} other <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>strong</b> to <b>be</b> attacked.|$|R

25|$|To {{prepare a}} pectin-gel, the {{ingredients}} are heated, dissolving the pectin. Upon cooling below gelling temperature, a gel starts to form. If gel formation <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>strong,</b> syneresis or a granular texture are the result, whilst weak gelling leads to excessively soft gels. Pectins gel according to specific parameters, such as sugar, pH and bivalent salts (especially Ca2+).|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} remove or recover the {{extracted}} solute, SIR particles can be regenerated using low pressure steam stripping, which is particularly effective for {{the recovery of}} volatile hydrocarbons. However, if the vapor pressure of the extracted solute is too low, or if the complexation between solute and extractant <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>strong,</b> other techniques need to be applied, e.g. pH swing.|$|E
25|$|The em dash is used {{in several}} ways: {{primarily}} in places where a set of parentheses or a colon might otherwise be used, it can show an abrupt change in thought or be used where a full stop (period) <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>strong</b> and a comma too weak. Em dashes are also used to set off summaries or definitions. Common uses and definitions are cited below with examples.|$|E

25|$|Canoeing. The only safe {{section for}} canoeists {{downstream}} from Clearwater Lake is around The Horseshoe meander bend. There is a put-in at Alice Creek and a take-out at Deer Creek, {{both on the}} Clearwater Valley Road. The Clearwater River between Azure Lake and {{the upper end of}} Clearwater Lake is safe for a canoeist to go downstream, but the current <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>strong</b> to go upstream and a portage trail is available.|$|E
25|$|Hopper's crew have {{repaired}} the ship, and the Doctor rewires {{the controls}} {{to the station}} so they are inactive. He then sets up a circuit to electrify the doors again, along with the control panels and the hatch. The Controller, still alive, advances towards them. Everyone tries to shut the outer doors using insulating poles, but the Controller <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>strong.</b> Toberman closes the doors, completing the circuit, and both he and the Controller are electrocuted.|$|E
25|$|Perique was {{developed}} in 1824 through the technique of pressure-fermentation of local tobacco by a farmer, Pierre Chenet. Considered the truffle of pipe tobaccos, it {{is used as a}} component in many blended pipe tobaccos, but <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>strong</b> to be smoked pure. At one time, the freshly moist Perique was also chewed, but none is now sold for this purpose. It is typically blended with pure Virginia to lend spice, strength, and coolness to the blend.|$|E

25|$|Tamsulosin and {{silodosin}} are selective α1 receptor blockers that preferentially bind to the α1A receptor in {{the prostate}} {{instead of the}} α1B receptor in the blood vessels. Less-selective α1 receptor blockers such as terazosin and doxazosin may lower blood pressure. The older, less selective α1-adrenergic blocker prazosin is not a first line choice for either high blood pressure or prostatic hyperplasia; it is a choice for patients who present with both problems at the same time. The older, broadly non-selective alpha blocker medications such as phenoxybenzamine are not recommended for control of BPH. Non-selective alpha blockers such as terazosin and doxazosin may also require slow dose adjustments as they can lower blood pressure and cause syncope (fainting) if {{the response to the}} medication <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>strong.</b>|$|E
25|$|Love, a theme {{throughout}} the Divine Comedy, {{is particularly important}} for the framing of sin on the Mountain of Purgatory. While the love that flows from God is pure, it can become sinful as it flows through humanity. Humans can sin by using love towards improper or malicious ends (Wrath, Envy, Pride), or using it to proper ends but with love that is either not strong enough (Sloth) or love that <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>strong</b> (Lust, Gluttony, Greed). Below the seven purges of the soul is the Ante-Purgatory, containing the Excommunicated from {{the church and the}} Late repentant who died, often violently, before receiving rites. Thus the total comes to nine, with the addition of the Garden of Eden at the summit, equaling ten.|$|E
25|$|Out of {{kindness}} towards Mimì, Marcello tries to silence him, {{but she has}} already heard all. Her weeping and coughing reveal her presence, and Rodolfo hurries to her. Musetta's laughter is heard and Marcello goes {{to find out what}} has happened. Mimì tells Rodolfo that she is leaving him, and asks that they separate amicably (Mimì: Donde lieta uscì—"From here she happily left"); but their love for one another <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>strong</b> for the pair to part. As a compromise, they agree to remain together until the spring, when the world is coming to life again and no one feels truly alone. Meanwhile, Marcello has found Musetta, and the couple quarrel fiercely about Musetta's flirtatiousness: an antithetical counterpoint to the other pair's reconciliation (quartet: Mimì, Rodolfo, Musetta, Marcello: Addio dolce svegliare alla mattina!—"Goodbye, sweet awakening in the morning!").|$|E

25|$|In the Chinese Market Mary meets Klarion the Witch boy, {{who tries}} {{to get some of}} her power. After Eclipso {{attempts}} to corrupt Mary, the Shadowpact take notice of Mary's activities, and attack Mary and Eclipso, who are overwhelmed and escape. Eclipso takes Mary to meet Darkseid, who offers to show her true darkness. Upon observing his treatment of people as mere puppets, Mary attacks him. An interruption by Desaad allows Mary to escape. Eclipso talks Mary into returning to Darkseid and submitting to his authority, suggesting that she can usurp his powers if she grows strong enough. The asteroid on which Mary and Eclipso are standing is destroyed by a stray shot from the Dominators and Monarch's armies. After Eclipso teleports her to safety, Mary blasts Eclipso with her own black diamond after realizing that Eclipso was only interested in selling her to Darkseid as a concubine in exchange for power. Eclipso manages to wrest the diamond from Mary's grasp, and leaves, telling her that she is once again alone. Eclipso then attempts to kill Mary, but finds that she <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>strong.</b> During their battle, Mary calls down the lightning, which strikes the two of them, causing Mary to fall into the ocean and wash up on the shores of Themiscyra.|$|E
500|$|Audiences also {{responded to}} the Beatles' brash social impudence. Director Richard Lester said, [...] "The general aim of the film was to present what was {{apparently}} becoming a social phenomenon in this country. Anarchy <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>strong</b> a word, but the quality of confidence that the boys exuded! Confidence that they could dress as they liked, speak as they liked, talk to the Queen as they liked, {{talk to the people}} on the train who 'fought the war for them' as they liked. ... still based on privilege—privilege by schooling, privilege by birth, privilege by accent, privilege by speech. The Beatles were the first people to attack this… they said if you want something, do it. You can do it. Forget all this talk about talent or ability or money or speech. Just do it." ...|$|E
500|$|Angelou {{takes the}} title of her fourth {{autobiography}} from a poem by Georgia Douglas Johnson, a Harlem Renaissance writer. Critic Lyman B. Hagan states that although the title is [...] "less striking or oblique than titles of her preceding books," [...] it is appropriate because Johnson's poem mentions a caged bird and provides a connection to Angelou's first autobiography, whose title was taken from a poem by Paul Lawrence Dunbar. The title suggests Angelou's painful loneliness and exposes a spiritual dilemma also present in her first volume. Johnson's use of the metaphor is different from Dunbar's because her bird is a female whose isolation is sexual rather than racial. The caged bird may also refer to Angelou after her failed marriage, but writer Mary Jane Lupton says that [...] "the Maya Angelou of The Heart of a Woman <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>strong</b> and too self-determined {{to be kept in}} a cage".|$|E

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of season six, Brittany returns with Santana {{and the rest of}} Glee club alumni to McKinley High School in [...] "Homecoming" [...] to help Rachel and Kurt recruit for New Directions. In [...] "Jagged Little Tapestry", while the alumni stick around for another week, Brittany is surprised by Santana's marriage proposal and gladly accepts. Brittany and Santana then return in [...] "What The World Needs Now" [...] to deal with Santana's disapproving grandmother Alma – with whom she hasn’t spoken since coming out as a lesbian. Brittany takes matters into her own hands and tries to invite Alma to the wedding, but Alma's prejudice <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>strong</b> and she rejects their engagement, and Brittany tells her off for doing so. Later the New Directions serenade them in an attempt to be invited to their upcoming wedding. Brittany and Santana are wed in a double ceremony with Kurt and Blaine in the eighth episode [...] "A Wedding". Before the ceremony, Sue arrives with Alma, who she has helped to realize that although she may not believe females should marry each other, family is the most important thing, leading her and Santana to reconcile. Brittany and Santana return briefly in the last minutes of the series finale [...] "Dreams Come True" [...] for a last performance {{with the rest of the}} Glee Cast to take a bow.|$|E
