5|$|The Nazi {{government}} quickly {{negotiated a}} deal in which the Swiss burned the Bf 110under the supervision of German observers {{in return for a}} sale to the Swiss of 12new Bf 109G-6 Gustav to replace combat losses. The new fighters were delivered <b>in</b> <b>batches</b> of six on 20and 22May. The new planes had serious manufacturing defects from the poor workmanship and production disruptions caused by Allied bombings, and after complaints the Germans refunded half of the six million Swiss franc purchase price.|$|E
5|$|These trains were {{manufactured}} from 1986 to 1989 <b>in</b> <b>batches</b> by a Japanese consortium {{consisting of}} Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Nippon Sharyo, Tokyu Car Corp and Kinki Sharyo following {{a round of}} intense competitive bidding by rolling stock manufacturers from around the world. No visible differences {{can be found in}} any of these batches, which were built to agreed specifications.|$|E
5|$|Butterfly {{eggs are}} {{protected}} by a hard-ridged outer layer of shell, called the chorion. This is lined with a thin coating of wax which prevents the egg from drying out before the larva has had time to fully develop. Each egg contains a number of tiny funnel-shaped openings at one end, called micropyles; {{the purpose of these}} holes is to allow sperm to enter and fertilize the egg. Butterfly eggs vary greatly in size and shape between species, but are usually upright and finely sculptured. Some species lay eggs singly, others <b>in</b> <b>batches.</b> Many females produce between one hundred and two hundred eggs.|$|E

5|$|The Iraqi Army, led by Bakr Sidqi, an {{experienced}} brigadier general, an Iraqi nationalist and general of Kurdish origin, {{although not a}} Kurdish nationalist, moved north in order to crush the Assyrian revolt. The Iraqi forces started executing every Assyrian male found in the mountainous Bekher region between Zakho and Duhok starting from 8 August 1933. Assyrian civilians were transported in military trucks from Zakho and Dohuk to uninhabited places, <b>in</b> <b>batches</b> of eight or ten, where they were shot with machine guns and run over by heavy armoured cars {{to make sure no}} one survived.|$|E
5|$|During 1973, B Squadron, 1st Armoured Regiment—designated the Medium Tank Trials Unit (MTTU)—evaluated the German Leopard 1 {{against the}} American M60A1 Patton as a {{replacement}} for the obsolete Centurions. The Leopard was judged the superior tank, and 90 gun tanks, eight Leopard 1 Armoured Recovery Vehicles Medium and five Leopard 1 bridge layer tanks were ordered. The Australian tanks were designated the Leopard AS1, and were based on the Leopard 1A3 which had been built for the German Army. The main difference between the Australian and German tanks was the inclusion of a SABCA fire control system, equipment to allow the tank to better operate in the tropics, additional storage boxes {{on the sides of the}} tank as well as improved trunnion bearings and combustion cleaners. These tanks were delivered to Australia <b>in</b> <b>batches</b> between 1976 and 1978. During the Leopard's service very little in the way of upgrades were undertaken, and by the 1990s they had become obsolete.|$|E
5|$|Kill 'Em All was {{released}} on July 25, 1983 by Megaforce with an initial pressing of 15,000 copies. Because of the label's financial restrictions, the album was pressed <b>in</b> <b>batches</b> of 500 copies. Kill 'Em All had sold 17,000 copies in the U.S. {{by the end of}} the year. Similarly to punk rock acts, Metallica promoted its material through the tape trading network and independent music magazines such as Metal Forces in the UK and Metal Mania in the U.S. The album did not enter the Billboard 200 chart until 1986, when it peaked at number 155 following Metallica's commercial success with its third studio album Master of Puppets. The 1988 re-issue on Elektra Records also charted on the Billboard 200, peaking at number 120. It was certified 3× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 1999 for shipping three million copies in the United States. Despite being the lowest selling Metallica studio album, it helped the band establish its image and build a fanbase in its inaugural years.|$|E

5|$|The {{very first}} {{computer}} games {{began to appear}} in the 1950s, starting with Bertie the Brain, a computer-based game of tic-tac-toe built by Dr. Josef Kates for the 1950 Canadian National Exhibition. While the status of these games as video games depends on the definition used, the games developed during this time period ran on the large antecedents of mainframe computers and were primarily developed for the purposes of academic research or to showcase the technological development of the computers on which they ran. Access to these computers, located almost exclusively in universities and research institutions, was restricted to academics and researchers, preventing any development of entertainment programs. Over the course of the decade, computer technology improved to include smaller, transistor-based computers on which programs could be created and run in real time, rather than operations run <b>in</b> <b>batches,</b> and computers themselves spread to more locations.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s, various {{computer}} games {{were created in}} the context of academic computer and programming research and for demonstrations of computing power, especially after the introduction later in the decade of smaller and faster computers on which programs could be created and run in real time as opposed to being executed <b>in</b> <b>batches.</b> A few programs, however, while used to showcase the power of the computer they ran on were also intended as entertainment products; these were generally created by undergraduate and graduate students and university employees, such as at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) where they were allowed on occasion to develop programs for the TX-0 experimental computer. These interactive graphical games were created by a community of programmers, many of them students and university employees affiliated with the Tech Model Railroad Club (TMRC) led by Alan Kotok, Peter Samson, and Bob Saunders. The games included Tic-Tac-Toe, which used a light pen to play a simple game of noughts and crosses against the computer, and Mouse in the Maze, which used a light pen to set up a maze of walls for a virtual mouse to traverse.|$|E

40|$|Dry {{fermented}} sausages were manufactured adding {{fish oil}} extracts rich in n- 3 fatty acids {{in order to}} obtain functional products and their nutritional advantages and intensity of oxidation process compared with traditional ones. Modified products were manufactured with 0. 53 % (batch A) and 1. 07 % (batch B) of fish oil extract. The amounts of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) per 100 g of dry fermented sausages were 0. 15 g and 0. 13 g <b>in</b> <b>batch</b> A, 0. 33 g and 0. 26 g <b>in</b> <b>batch</b> B, respectively, <b>in</b> contrast with the control products which only showed 0. 01 g EPA and 0. 03 g DHA. No significant differences were found in the rest of fatty acids. A decrease in the n- 6 /n- 3 ratios from 16. 14 in the control to 7. 78 <b>in</b> <b>batch</b> A and 5. 32 <b>in</b> <b>batch</b> B was achieved. TBA values were similar in control (0. 31 ppm) and <b>in</b> <b>batch</b> A products (0. 34 ppm) but increase significantly <b>in</b> <b>batch</b> B products (1. 22 ppm). No statistical differences were observed among batches for the content of cholesterol oxidation products (2. 36 to 2. 43 μg/g fat) leading to similar percentages of oxidation. 7 -Ketocholesterol, considered as an indicator of oxidation was not present in any sample. Values obtained for L * and Hue (arctg b*/a*) were comparable to that of meat products. Although no effect was observed in COP formation and instrumental measurements of colour the high level of n- 3 fatty acid seems to accelerate significantly the oxidation process...|$|R
