5|$|Taylor {{received}} a ten-year sentence, the maximum sentence {{the judge had}} the power to impose. The sentences received by the other defendants ranged from four years to nine-and-a-half years imprisonment.

5|$|McDougal was {{released}} at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> and returned home. The following day {{she went to}} buy whisky and was confronted by a mob who were angry at the not proven verdict. She {{was taken to a}} police building in nearby Fountainbridge for her own protection, but after the mob laid siege to it, she escaped through a back window to the main police station off Edinburgh's High Street. She tried to see Burke, but permission was refused; she left Edinburgh the next day, and there are no clear accounts of her later life. On 3 January 1829, on the advice of both Catholic priests and Presbyterian clergy, Burke made another confession. This was more detailed than the official one provided prior to his trial; he placed much of the blame for the murders on Hare.|$|E
5|$|The Megans are {{determined}} to put humanity and the Enterprise crew on trial for what humans did to their people during the Salem witch-trials as well as Lucien for bringing them here. Kirk comes out in support of Lucien's life and says that killing him would make the Megans just like humans. Lucien's punishment is to be condemned into limbo for eternity for bringing humans into the Megans' world. While Kirk states that humanity has progressed infinitely since 1691, the Megans ignore his words. At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial,</b> Kirk offers his life to save Lucien's and the Megans are so impressed by the captain's gesture that they spare Lucien, and tell the Enterprise that they would welcome future human visits to their planet. They also return the Enterprise to its proper universe, while Lucien is revealed to be Lucifer.|$|E

5|$|Without a club during pre-season, Kinkladze {{trained with}} Portsmouth, where his former manager Jim Smith {{was on the}} {{managing}} staff. He played for Portsmouth in one pre-season friendly, but Portsmouth decided instead to sign another former Manchester City playmaker, Eyal Berkovic. Over the next few months, he was linked with moves to Scottish clubs Dundee and Celtic, and later Leeds United, but none resulted in a contract offer. As a consequence, he had to train individually and lost {{his place in the}} national team again, this time before the return match against Russia. In December 2003, Kinkladze went for a one-week trial at Panathinaikos, following an invitation from Giannis Vardinogiannis, the owner of the Greek club. However, at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial,</b> the club decided not to sign him. Six months later, he was linked with a move to Russian club Shinnik Yaroslavl, but again, he was not offered a contract.|$|E

25|$|In January 1976, the BPP civil {{lawsuits}} went {{to trial}} with Taylor and law partner Jeffrey Haas as trial counsel. The trial lasted for 18 months, longer any previous federal court case. During the trial, it was established that the FBI had not turned over 200 volumes of Black Panther documents to defense counsel. Both Taylor and Haas were jailed for contempt when they protested what they claimed were unfair rulings by federal Judge Joseph Sam Perry. At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial,</b> Judge Perry dismissed the case. Taylor, Haas and colleague Dennis Cunningham appealed to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.|$|E

After a mistrial was declared on October 1, 1957, Liberace, Flynn and O'Hara would give up on their own individual lawsuits. But Edmund Brown preempted Confidentials win by calling for a retrial. Harrison was rattled. To spare his niece another ordeal—and the danger of three-years' imprisonment—Harrison promised the Attorney General to publish only positive stories.|$|E
25|$|Tunnelling resumed after a {{delay of}} several months, and by 1971 the TBM {{was ready to}} {{commence}} work. A three-month trial period had been allocated to assess the suitability of the TBM for work at the western portal. It soon {{became apparent that the}} nature of the rock at this end of the tunnel was too fractured for efficient operation of the TBM, resulting in the cutters and fill extraction systems of the machine being continually blocked by rock. By the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> period, the TBM had only advanced 106 m and was wearing out far more quickly than was hoped, so it was decided to dismantle it and move it to the eastern portal.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> meaning <b>of</b> {{spontaneous}} skin conductance activity, and {{its relevance}} to appraisal theory, are examined. Spontaneous skin conductance activity is hypothesised to reflect task engagement, {{and thus to}} be correlated with appraisals of problem-focused coping potential. In a within-subjects design, subjects solved anagrams in which task difficulty was manipulated by varying both <b>the</b> difficulty <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anagrams and <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> time available to solve them. In the most difficult condition, appraisals of coping potential were expected, and observed, to be especially low, and these appraisals were predicted to produce selective disengagement from the task, yielding reduced skin conductance activity. Within trials, skin conductance activity increased at <b>the</b> start <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trials</b> in all conditions, but decreased by <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trials</b> in <b>the</b> most difficult condition only. At <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trials,</b> both spontaneous response rate and maximum response amplitude were positively correlated, within-subjects, with appraisals of coping potential, and, even after controlling for task difficulty, with solving the anagram. These findings support the hypothesised relation between appraised coping potential and spontaneous skin conductance activity, and <b>the</b> interpretation <b>of</b> this activity as reflecting task engagement...|$|R

25|$|Ekinci {{was arrested}} in Italy after interrogation. Turkish Minister of Justice Cemil Çiçek {{reported}} that {{there would not be}} a direct return request to the Italian Ministry of Justice until the Chief Public Prosecutor's Office and Ministry of Internal Affairs had completed their work on the subject. They then requested the return of Ekinci. Giuseppe Giannuzzi, prosecutor of the hijacking incident, said to The Associated Press in an interview that the hijacker will remain in jail until the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> which will presumably take two years after inception. Giannuzzi has charged Ekinci with hijacking and considered other charges like terrorism and kidnapping, if Ekinci is sentenced for hijacking he will be imprisoned for 7 to 21 years.|$|E
25|$|Rickhey was exonerated by {{statements}} of past employees and written interrogations of his engineering colleagues – only {{the testimony of}} one former engineer was incriminating. Witnesses offered by the prosecution made only vague statements about his activities in camp operations because they had generally not personally witnessed it. Written evidence of Rickhey's guilt was also lacking; only after the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> were documents found showing his culpability in the inhumane working conditions in the Mittelwork. Rickhey testified {{on his own behalf}} and put the entire responsibility for the inhumane conditions and forced labor on the late internment engineer Albin Sawatzki, who had died in American detention in 1945. Furthermore, he pointed to his cooperation with the U.S. Air Force (USAF) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.|$|E
25|$|The {{trial began}} on 21 April 1924. It lasted about two weeks. Near the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial,</b> Overturf testified {{in his own}} defense. He denied the charges, but {{admitted}} that several appraisals were higher than {{they should have been}} due to inaccurate measurements of the properties. In addition, Overturf testified that he had asked the veterans’ aid commission several times for instructions on how to prepare his appraisal, but had received no answer to his queries. The jury deliberated for twelve hours before finding Overturf and other defendants guilty of mail fraud. However, after the verdict the jury petitioned the judge for leniency in sentencing, recommending that Overturf and the others be given fines rather than prison sentences. The judge agreed, giving Overturf a $1,000 fine and the others three defendants $500 fines. Overturf paid his fine and did not appeal the outcome of the trial.|$|E

25|$|In 1611, {{her father}} was working with Agostino Tassi to {{decorate}} the vaults of Casino delle Muse inside the Palazzo Pallavicini-Rospigliosi in Rome, so Orazio hired the painter to tutor his daughter privately. During this tutelage, Tassi raped Artemisia. Another man, Cosimo Quorli, was also involved. After the rape, Artemisia continued to {{have sexual relations with}} Tassi, with the expectation {{that they were going to}} be married and with the hope to restore her dignity and her future. Tassi reneged on his promise to marry Artemisia. Nine months after the rape, when he learnt that Artemisia and Tassi were not going to be married, Orazio pressed charges against Tassi. Orazio also claimed that Tassi stole a painting of Judith from the Gentileschi household. The major issue of this trial was the fact that Tassi had taken Artemisia's virginity. If Artemisia had not been a virgin before Tassi raped her, the Gentileschis would not have been able to press charges. During the ensuing seven-month trial, it was discovered that Tassi had planned to murder his wife, had engaged in adultery with his sister-in-law, and planned to steal some of Orazio’s paintings. During the trial, Artemisia was subjected to a gynecological examination and torture using thumbscrews to verify her testimony. At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> Tassi was exiled from Rome, although they never carried out the sentence. The trial influenced the feminist view of Artemisia Gentileschi during the late twentieth century.|$|E
