40|$|Background: Chlamydia pneumoniae {{is a human}} {{respiratory}} pathogen {{that has}} recently been related to the genesis of symptomatic atherosclerosis. C. pneumoniae has been studied more widely in relation to coronary atherosclerosis than to peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD). The present study aimed to retrospectively analyze the presence of C. pneumoniae DNA in patients with PAOD. Materials and Methods: A seminested PCR method was applied on 85 samples from 71 patients with PAOD secondary to surgical treatment. The control group comprised 50 patients with chronic superficial venous insufficiency who required varicose resection surgery. Results: The number of patients, number of samples studied and percentage of patients found to be positive in the PCR study were 17, 18 and 59 %, respectively, for arteries of the lower extremities; 15, 16 and 60 % for aneurysm of the abdominal aorta; 22, 23 and 73 % for carotid stenosis and 17, 18 and 65 % for aortic stenosis. C. pneumoniae DNA was found in six <b>external</b> <b>pudendal</b> <b>arteries</b> (12 %) of the control group, {{significantly lower than the}} incidence in the patient group (p < 0. 0001). Conclusion: A causal relationship between chronic C. pneumoniae infection and PAOD cannot be ruled out. On the contrary, the high incidence of C. pneumoniae DNA detected in our patients suggests that C. pneumoniae infection may play some role in the pathogenesis of peripheral vascular disease...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{study the}} origin and course of various {{branching}} pattern of femoral artery and to measure {{the distance from the}} point of origin to mid inguinal point and also the side of origin of all branches of femoral artery. MATERIALS & METHODS: A total of 40 femoral triangles were dissected from 40 adult human cadavers for present study. RESULTS: Superficial epigastric, superficial circumflex iliac and superficial <b>external</b> <b>pudendal</b> <b>arteries</b> arising from femoral artery as separate branches in 68. 3 % within femoral sheath. The mean distance from the point of origin of all superficial arteries was found within 3. 5 cm and profunda femoris artery was 3. 28 cm from femoral artery. Medial circumflex femoral artery arises frequently from femoral artery by 20 % and lateral circumflex femoral artery was by 15 %. The mean distance from the mid inguinal point to the origin of Medial circumflex femoral artery was 2. 68 cm when it arises from femoral artery and 4. 5 cm when it arises from profunda femoral artery. The mean distance from the mid inguinal point to the origin of lateral circumflex femoral artery was 4. 5 cm when it arises from femoral artery and 5. 46 cm when it arises from profunda femoral artery. CONCLUSION: Anatomical knowledge of branching pattern of femoral and profunda femoral artery and their distance of origin is very important to surgeons to avoid the complications in vascular reconstructive surgeries.

40|$|The {{importance}} of the superficial external pudendal artery in cases of lower limb obstructive arteriopathies has been established, and a perfect knowledge of its anatomy is desirable {{for the creation of}} successful flaps involving it. However, little information is available on the morphometry of this artery. PURPOSE: In this study, we conducted a quantitative investigation of the superficial external pudendal artery as the basis for skin grafts. METHOD: Twenty-five right and left sides of the inguinal region of male cadavers were dissected. After retracting the skin at the inguinal region, the femoral vessels and the sapheno-femoral junction were exposed. The following aspects were then analyzed: 1) the presence of the superficial external pudendal artery, 2) the place of origin of the superficial external pudendal artery and the common trunk, 3) the duplication of the superficial external pudendal artery, 4) the distance from the superficial external pudendal artery or the common trunk to the inguinal ligament, and 5) the diameter of the superficial external pudendal artery. RESULTS: The results were the following: 1) superficial <b>external</b> <b>pudendal</b> <b>arteries</b> were found in 46 of 50 sides (92 %); 2) they originated from the femoral artery in 45 cases and from the deep femoral artery in only 1 case; 3) the arteries were found duplicated in 21 cases (46 %), as a common trunk in 11 cases (24 %), and as a single artery in 14 cases (30 %); 4) the distance from the superficial external pudendal artery to the inguinal ligament ranged from 0. 8 cm to 8. 5 cm; from the common trunk, it ranged from 3. 5 cm to 6. 7 cm; 5) the diameter of the superficial external pudendal artery ranged from 1. 2 mm to 3. 8 mm; and 6) the diameter of the common trunk ranged from 1. 35 mm to 5. 15 mm. CONCLUSION: The results show that the superficial external pudendal artery generally originates from the femoral artery. It was found as a common trunk, duplicated, or as a single artery.

A importância do conhecimento da anatomia da artéria pudenda superficial externa está bem estabelecida e um conhecimento adequado de sua anatomia é desejável para a criação bem sucedida de flaps. Entretanto, são escassos os trabalhos morfométricos sobre esta artéria. OBJETIVO. No presente estudo, foi feita uma análise quantitativa da artéria pudenda superficial externa, como base para enxertos de pele. MÉTODO. Foram dissecadas 25 regiões inguinais direitas e 25 esquerdas de cadáveres do sexo masculino. Após rebater a pele da região inguinal, os vasos femorais, a junção safeno-femoral e a artéria pudenda superficial externa foram expostas. Os seguintes aspectos foram então analisados: 1. Presença da artéria pudenda superficial externa; 2. Local de origem da artéria pudenda superficial externa ou do tronco comum; 3. Duplicação da artéria pudenda superficial externa; 4. Distância da artéria pudenda superficial externa ou do tronco comum ao ligamento inguinal; 5. Diâmetro da artéria pudenda superficial externa. RESULTADOS. Os resultados mostraram que: 1. A artéria pudenda superficial externa foi encontrada em 46 dos 50 lados dissecados (92 %); 2. A artéria teve origem na artéria femoral em 45 casos; em um único caso teve origem na artéria femoral profunda; 3. A artéria foi encontrada duplicada, em 21 casos (46 %), formando um tronco comum, que depois se bifurcava, em 11 casos (24 %) e como uma artéria única 14 vezes (30 %); 4. A distância da artéria ao ligamento inguinal variou de 0, 8 cm a 8, 5 cm; quando sob a forma de tronco comum, esta distância variou de 3, 5 cm a 6, 7 cm; 5. O diâmetro da artéria pudenda superficial externa variou de 1, 36 mm a 5, 15 mm. CONCLUSÕES. Os resultados mostram que a artéria pudenda superficial externa origina-se, na grande maioria dos casos, da artéria femoral. Foi encontrada como um tronco comum, duplicada ou como uma artéria única.

During the standard surgery {{it is imperative to}} demonstrate and ligate the tributaries of the saphenofemoral junction in combination with stripping of the great saphenous vein. We studied 228 patients with varicose veins who underwent surgery during two years. The number and name of tributaries at the saphenofemoral junction, presence of <b>external</b> <b>pudendal</b> <b>artery</b> and its relationship to the saphenofemoral junction were recorded. The number of tributaries varied from 2 to 7 at the first five centimeters of the great saphenous vein.

40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} aimed {{to show the}} {{arterial}} blood supply of the udder of the Egyptian native breed of goat (Baladi goat) {{to be used as}} a guide during mastectomy and other surgical interferences. The study was carried out on the udder of twelve apparently healthy adult female Egyptian Baladi goats. Four goats were used for mastectomy, one specimen was used for radiography and the other specimens were subjected to gum-milk latex injection to clarify the origin, course and distribution of the main arteries supplying the udder. The results revealed that the udder of goat was supplied by the <b>external</b> <b>pudendal</b> <b>artery</b> and dorsal labial and mammary branch of the ventral perineal artery. The course of the <b>external</b> <b>pudendal</b> <b>artery</b> through the inguinal canal before reaching the base of the udder, as well as that of the dorsal labial and mammary branch of the ventral perineal artery in the perineal region, were briefly described to determine the appropriate site for ligation of these vessels before mastectomy. Moreover, the arterial interconnection between the two halves of the udder was emphasized to be highlighted during unilateral mastectomy. Vascular ligation of the main blood vessels supplying the udder on the basis of the anatomical description provided less traumatic surgery and reduced the severity of the blood loss...|$|R

40|$|A {{case report}} is {{presented}} {{of a young}} male patient seen at the University Teaching Hospital Lusaka Zambia with a right scrotal mass. During orchidectomy which was performed through a low inguinal incision iatrogenic complete penile amputation occurred. Subsequent direct replantation was done without microsurgical repair. The excellent outcome achieved with complete sexual function but no sensory or skin loss leads the authors to a discussion on the blood supply to the penis and the possible clinical significance {{in the management of}} penile disease. It is well known that the blood supply to the skin of the penis is from the superficial <b>external</b> <b>pudendal</b> <b>artery</b> and distinct from the dorsal artery to the penis which supplies the erectile cylinders. The dorsal artery to the penis is considered an end artery. The case report suggests good anastomosis between these two arteries probably through the prepuce.

40|$|Pseudoaneurysms rarely {{occur as}} a serious {{complication}} following incomplete hemostasis of an arterial puncture site. As {{a result of the}} increase in diagnostic and therapeutic angiography, the frequency of iatrogenic pseudoaneurysm has increased as well. Iatrogenic pseudoaneurysms associated with angiographic catheterization occur most commonly in the common femoral artery. Here we report a case of iatrogenic superficial <b>external</b> <b>pudendal</b> <b>artery</b> (SEPA) pseudoaneurysm following cardiac catheterization, which was diagnosed with Doppler ultrasound (US) and multidetector computed tomographic angiography (MDCTA) before Doppler US-guided compression therapy. To the best of our knowledge, iatrogenic SEPA pseudoaneurysm, which is an unusual vessel location for pseudoaneurysm occurrence, has not been reported in the literature. In patients in whom anticoagulant-thrombolytic therapy or therapeutic catheterization with larger sized sheath is planned, determination of the precise localization of arterial puncture site is important for the prevention of iatrogenic pseudoaneurysm development. Arterial puncture guided with Doppler US might reduce complications. When suspected, MDCTA is useful in the diagnosis and demonstration of iatrogenic pseudoaneurysms. Treatment of US-guided compression should be the first choice for iatrogenic pseudoaneurysms. Interventional radiologists and cardiologists should have enough experience about the catheterization complications and their treatment in order to decrease the morbidity and mortality related to the intervention...|$|R

40|$|AbstractCongenital {{cervical}} agenesis of {{is a rare}} Müllerian anomaly {{that may}} be associated with partial or complete vaginal aplasia and renal anomalies. Symptoms such as amenorrhea and abdominal pain usually develop shortly after menarche, when the absence or obstruction of the cervical canal results in blood accumulation in the uterus and fallopian tubes, and finally in the peritoneal cavity. Physical examination sometimes reveals normally developed external sex organs. Delayed diagnosis and treatment may potentially result in extensive endometriosis, which may potentially cause severe adhesion and damage to reproductivity. Such consequences could complicate further the management of the disease. Traditionally, hysterectomy has been the treatment of choice in these cases because of the high failure rate of canalization procedures and risk of serious ascending infection. With advanced laparoscopic techniques, conservative management seems feasible and has been recommended. We herein present a patient with complete cervical and vaginal agenesis. Creation of a neovagina and uterovaginal anastomosis were performed first under the guidance of laparoscopy (Figure  1). A neocervix was composed of a polytetrafluoroethylene graft and a piece of oral mucosa retrieved from the buccal area. The neovagina was reconstructed with an <b>external</b> <b>pudendal</b> <b>artery</b> perforator flap. A cervical Fr 16 size Foley was left in place as a stent. The patient had uneventful postoperative recovery and fair wound healing at the outpatient follow-up. Congenital agenesis of the uterine cervix and vagina can be differentiated accurately and reconstructed laparoscopically. Using mesh-buccal mucosa composite and pudendal perforator flap is a practical way to reconstruct neocervix and neovagina after their creation...|$|R

In group B ewes, the procedure took place abruptly; ewes were milked twice daily for the last time on D 0 and no milking was carried out after that. B-mode and Doppler ultrasonographic examination of the udder of all ewes was performed throughout the drying-off procedure. Appropriate data management and analysis were performed. Progressive changes of the various parameters evaluated throughout the study period were significant in both groups (P 0. 3). Diameter of the <b>external</b> <b>pudendal</b> <b>artery</b> progressively decreased during the study and differed significantly between the two groups (P= 0. 037). Both resistance index and pulsatility index progressively increased throughout the study period in both groups; for both parameters, differences between the two groups were significant (P< 0. 0005). B-mode ultrasonographic examination indicated differences in remodelling of the extracellular matrix in relation to the procedure for udder drying-off.

A aorta abdominal emitiu de sua superfície dorsal de 6 a 8 artérias lombares únicas. Das artérias renais, direita e esquerda, originaram-se as artérias frênico-abdominal para irrigar parte do diafragma e da parede abdominal lateral cranial. A aorta abdominal lançou dorsalmente, a artéria sacral mediana, cranialmente a sua bifurcação em artérias ilíacas comuns. As artérias ilíacas comuns, ramos terminais da aorta abdominal, originaram as artérias ilíacas interna e externa. A artéria ilíaca interna distribuiu-se nas vísceras da cavidade pélvica. A artéria ilíaca externa emitiu uma artéria umbilical e, antes de alcançar o anel femoral, lançou a artéria circunflexa ilíaca profunda para a parede abdominal lateral, em seus dois terços caudais. A artéria ilíaca externa lançou o tronco pudendo-epigástrico, que originou a artéria epigástrica caudal, para a parede abdominal ventral e a artéria pudenda externa, que saiu pelo canal inguinal, para irrigar a genitália externa. Os ramos parietais diretos da aorta abdominal foram as artérias lombares e a artéria sacral mediana, enquanto as artérias frênico-abdominal, circunflexa ilíaca profunda e epigástrica caudal, foram ramos colaterais parietais indiretos.
