50|$|Indirect {{grilling}} is {{a barbecue}} cooking technique {{in which the}} food is placed {{to the side of}} or above the heat source instead of directly over the flame as is more common. This can be achieved by igniting only some burners on a <b>gas</b> <b>barbecue</b> or by piling coals to one side of a charcoal pit. A drip tray is placed below the food to prevent fat from the food igniting and generating a direct flame. Indirect grilling is designed to cook larger (e.g. pork shoulders, whole chicken) or tougher foods (e.g. brisket, ribs) that would burn if cooked using a direct flame. This method of cooking generates a more moderate temperature (about 275-350 °F) and allows for an easier introduction of wood smoke for flavoring.|$|E

5000|$|In Australia, {{barbecues}} are {{a popular}} summer pastime. Sometimes known colloquially as a [...] "barbie" [...] or sometimes [...] "barby" [...] (plural [...] "barbies"), and often written as BBQ, the traditional meat used historically was lamb chops and beef steak for adults, and sausages (colloquially known as [...] "snags") for {{both children and}} adults. Coin-operated or free public <b>gas</b> or electric <b>barbecues</b> are common in city parks. While Australian barbecue uses similar seasonings to its American counterpart, smoking or sugary sauces are used less often. Beer is often drizzled over cooking chops and steak during cooking, the theory being that it adds flavour while making the meat more tender. Meat is sometimes marinated for flavour and is then cooked on a hot plate or grill. Australian barbecues tend to be either all hot-plate or half and half hot-plate/grill. The barbecuing of prawns has become increasingly popular in Australia. US-style barbecuing, {{as opposed to the}} traditional grilling techniques, is becoming more popular.|$|R
