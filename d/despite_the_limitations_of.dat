Method: A cross-sectional survey of 836 adolescents, one total school year in Bermuda. The BITE and EAT self-report questionnaires were administered in a classroom setting. The analysis was for caseness and for total scores. Caseness represents possible developing anorexic or bulimic eating disorder pathology for this non-adult population. Results: 7. 3 % fulfilled EAT caseness, 0. 24 % fulfilled BITE caseness. There was no gender or ethnic difference for caseness. Multivariate analysis for EAT case-ness found Odds Ratios of 2. 89 (95 % CI 1. 37, 6. 11) for Manual maternal job status. Conclusion: <b>Despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> a questionnaire analysis, lower socio-economic status increases the risk of possible eating disorder pathology in this adolescent population.
