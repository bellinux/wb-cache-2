50|$|Traditionally, Dayak {{agriculture}} {{was based}} on actually Integrated Indigenous Farming System. Iban Dayaks tend to plant paddy on hill slopes while Maloh Dayaks prefer flat lands as discussed by King. Agricultural Land in this sense was used and defined primarily in terms of <b>hill</b> <b>rice</b> farming, ladang (garden), and hutan (forest). According to Prof Derek Freeman in his Report on Iban Agriculture, Iban Dayaks used to practice twenty seven stages of <b>hill</b> <b>rice</b> farming once a year and their shifting cultivation practices allow the forest to regenerate itself rather than to damage the forest, thereby to ensure the continuity and sustainability of forest use and/or survival of the Iban community itself. The Iban Dayaks love virgin forests for their dependency on forests but that is for migration, territorial expansion and/or fleeing enemies.|$|E
50|$|With a {{population}} of approximately 6,600 people (2013) the Kelabit comprise {{one of the smallest}} ethnic groups in Sarawak. Many have migrated to urban areas over the last 20 years and it is estimated that only 1,200 still live in their remote homeland. There, tightly knit communities live in inherited longhouses and practice a generations-old form of agriculture—they are cultivators of wet paddy, <b>hill</b> <b>rice,</b> maize, tapioca, pineapple, pumpkin, cucumber, beans,coffee,lemon grass, taro and fruitlike passion fruit, strawberry. Hunting and fishing is also practised. Domesticated buffalo are valued highly, seven of which are traditionally required for the dowry for an upper class bride.|$|E

50|$|Rice Hill is {{a summit}} that divides the {{watersheds}} of Elk Creek and the Umpqua River. It was named either for Isadore F. Rice, who {{settled in the}} area in the 1850s, or for William S. Rice, who had a Donation Land Claim {{at the north end of}} Rice Valley at about the same time. The two-mile long valley stretches south from the community of Rice Hill. Southern Pacific Railroad (today Union Pacific) has a station on its Siskiyou Line at the summit named Rice <b>Hill.</b> <b>Rice</b> Hill post office was established in 1892, and soon renamed Ricehill. The office closed in 1908.

40|$|The Author(s) 2015. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract In the Andapa region of northeast Madagascar, smallholders cultivating swidden <b>hill</b> <b>rice</b> (tavy) for subsis-tence are pressing against neighboring nature reserves. A dominant policy approach to reducing this pressure requires that smallholders abandon tavy and purchase rice from pro-ceeds obtained from their environmentally sustainable com-mercial crops, vanilla and coffee. Economic liberalization pol-icies {{have succeeded in}} stimulating the expansion of these commercial crops, but have failed to reduce tavy production. We ask why this dual (subsistence and commercial) produc-tion system persists. We test two explanatory views: that either market imperfections deny farmers full entry into the market, or that internal production goals or socio-cultural norms create barriers to full market participation. Results support the latter view, although not for reasons that {{have been associated with}} this view in past studies. We propose a new factor that may serve as a barrier to full-market immersion among Andapa tavy farmers, the social relations of property...|$|E
40|$|Over 114 {{countries}} in the world grow rice and more than 50 countries have an annual rice production of 100, 000 tonnes or more. Asian farmers produce about 90 % of the global total rice production. Generally, there are two most common varieties of rice; cultivated and <b>hill</b> <b>rice.</b> Nowadays a lot of agriculture land is contaminated with toxic elements owing to the use of sludge or municipal compost, pesticides, fertilizers and emissions from municipal waste incinerators, car exhausts, residues from metalliferous mines, and smelting industries. The distribution and concentration of several toxic elements in grains particularly rice has lately become a big concern. A study to determine the concentrations of some elements in a few varieties of rice in our local market using Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis has been performed by Waste and Environmental Technology Division, Malaysian Nuclear Agency. A total of 15 elements were measured. The method was validated by analysing the Standard Reference Material SRM- 1568 a (Rice Flour) and SRM- 1573 a (Tomato Leaves) of NIST. The measured concentrations of major and minor elements were analysed in terms of the average intake of nutrient content and comparison of several toxic elements to other studied values...|$|E
40|$|Beginning in 1997, {{international}} {{prices for}} black pepper (Piper nigrum L.) boomed {{for about three}} years, coinciding with the Asian economic crisis. Smallholders throughout Southeast Asia responded to the price rises by investing more labor into existing pepper gardens as well as planting new gardens. While {{this is part of}} an old pattern with such boom-and-bust cash crops, the unique historical circumstance surrounding the most recent boom was the Asian crisis. Here we compare the response of Iban pepper smallholders to this situation {{on either side of the}} international border separating Sarawak, Malaysia and West Kalimantan, Indonesia. On both sides, Iban benefited from the higher prices, but many households without productive vines at the onset of high prices were too late as their new gardens had hardly matured before prices fell in 2000. In the study communities, the Iban Kalimantan significantly reduced their labor migration to focus on pepper during the period of high prices, whereas the Sarawak Iban relied on rather specific off-farm income sources in the tourism, off-shore oil and gas industries, and did not significantly alter their pepper cultivation strategies. The mutual buffering capacity of <b>hill</b> <b>rice</b> cultivation and pepper farming described in an earlier study in Sarawak was not evident in the study communities...|$|E

40|$|Soil {{erosion and}} the {{deterioration}} of water quality in many river systems of Malaysia {{is a major concern}} and can among other things be attributed to deforestation associated with land conversion for agricultural purposes. This study looks at the relationship between land use and soil erosion in Tikolod, Sabah. The village has gone through a major transformation because of an increase in population partly caused by migration from Kionop village located within the boundaries of what is today Crocker Range National Park (CRNP). With the use of rapid rural appraisal, an erosion risk assessment using the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) and monitoring of river discharge and turbidity, it was possible to investigate the relationship between land use practices and soil erosion in relation to water quality. The study found that farmers did not relate soil erosion to land management but to the rainfall and no explicit soil conservation measures were used. Risk of erosion was high on ginger and <b>hill</b> <b>rice</b> fields mainly due to the steep slopes and because no conservation measures were used. It was questionable whether the USLE was valid for plots of 40 degrees slope. Finally, the lack of buffer zones along the river may be the major cause of high turbidity and sediment concentration in the watershed combined with a reduction of the fallow period. It is therefore important that conservation practices are incorporated in future land management to prevent deterioration of water quality...|$|E
40|$|Because of the {{disruptive}} potential {{inherent in}} conflict situations, all societies have devised some mechanisms for their resolution. Universal functions of these mechanisms include {{the resolution of}} the substantive issues of disputes and the restoration of the integrity of the social fabric. The means used to realize these objectives, however, vary widely cross-culturally and are intimately related to other aspects of personality, society, and culture. In this paper, I analyze one such process of conflict resolution as it occurs among the Semai Senoi of West Malaysia and trace some of contextual relationships. The Semai Senoi are an aboriginal population numbering some 15, 000 individuals. They live for the most part in small, relatively isolated hamlets of fewer than 100 people, the settlements scattered along the deep valleys that dissect the mountainous spine of the cen-tral Malay Peninsula. Although the degree of acculturation to and integration into the national socioeconomic system varies from area to area within the Semai region, the traditional Semai pattern is one of politically autonomous settlements. Each village exploits a de-fined territory and subsists by swidden cultivation of manioc and <b>hill</b> <b>rice</b> supplemented by hunting, fishing, trapping, and gathering. This pattern persists in the less accessible highland and deep forest areas and characterizes the settlement — a tiny hamlet of four houses and sixty-five men, women, and children — where the bulk of the research for this paper was conducted. The Semai are best known in the anthropological literature fo...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This was {{a five-year}} {{retrospective}} study (1999 - 2004) on {{the prevalence of}} malaria at the Aborigine Hospital, Gombak, Malaysia. A total of 94 malaria cases was analysed. The highest case reports were for the year 2000, with 32 cases (34 %), and the lowest was in 2004, with only 1 (1 %). The majority of cases reported were among the Semai tribe (44 %), followed by the Temiar tribe (34 %) and the unspecified tribe (s) (20 %). Females (53 %) were more commonly affected than males (47 %). The majority of cases were within the age group 1 - 5 years (51 %). Plasmodium falciparum {{was the most common}} species reported in this study, at 57 %, followed by Plasmodium vivax (38 %) and 5 % mixed infection of P. falciparum and P. vivax. Most patients (27 %) stayed for more than one month in hospital. Most patients came from Kuala Lipis, Pahang, (78 %). The most common complication was anemia (38 %) followed by splenomegaly (18 %); only 2 % had cerebral malaria. All patients were treated with the standard anti-malarial drugs.

40|$|Effects of {{genotype}} {{and medium}} composition on {{the frequency of}} callus induction and green plant regeneration from anther of Nepalese rice were investigated. Cold pretreated anthers from six rice genotypes at 8 ± 2 °C for seven days were cultured on three different callus induction media designated as Callus Induction Medium (CIM 1) : N 6 mineral salts + N 6 vitamins (2 mg L - 1 each) + myoinositol (100 mg L - 1) + 2, 4 -D (2. 5 mg L - 1) + KI (0. 5 mg L - 1) + AgNO 3 (10 mg L - 1) + maltose (50 g L - 1), CIM 2 : N 6 mineral salts + MS organic salts + NAA (4 mg L - 1) + Kinetin (KI) (2 mg L - 1) + Silver nitrate (AgNO 3) (5 mg L - 1) and sucrose 60 (g L - 1) and CIM 3 : CIM 2 without AgNO 3.. The callus induction frequency was significantly affected by rice genotypes and genotype x medium interactions. The efficiency of callus induction (calli/anther) was higher in CIM 1 (14. 1 %) followed by CIM 2 (12. 54 %) and CIM 3 (10. 3 %). CIM 2 {{was found to be}} superior for the recovery of green plants. Among genotypes, only the calli from Chandanath - 3 and Khumal- 4 were able to differentiate into green plants. In this study the calli induced on medium containing 2, 4 -Dichloroacetic acid (2, 4 -D) had lower regeneration ability than the medium supplied with α-naptthalene acetic acid (NAA).

40|$|To achieve {{self-sufficiency}} in rice once {{a surplus}} of 10 million tons in 2014, one way could be reached by the application of technology. This review describes the rice cultivation technologies that have been and are being developed in West Sumatra by different institutions. Integrated Crop Management (ICM) is a technology recommendation of the Ministry of Agriculture. ICM in West Sumatra began in 2001. ICM technology is the integration of technological components, such as: young seedlings, seed quality, planting less than 3 plants per hill, new high yielding varieties, improved soil aeration with intermittent irrigation, the use of organic fertilizer, site-specific nutrient management through fertilizer N efficiency use LCC, {{as well as the}} use of P and K fertilizers based on soil nutrient status. Rice result achievement by ICM technology of various locations in West Sumatra is 5. 30 to 7. 25 t/ha. ICM has been implemented in the form of ICM-Field School in accelerating the deployment of technological innovation. SRI (The System of Rice Intensification) technology in pioneered by the Faculty of Agriculture, Andalas University since 2004. Four main components in the SRI are: the use of young seedlings, one seedling per planting point, plant spacing rare, and no stagnant water throughout the season. Increased productivity by SRI technolgy is mainly due to the increased number of productive tillers significantly, ie 40 - 80 plants per <b>hill.</b> <b>Rice</b> productivity achieved about 7. 8 t/ha versus conventional farming productivity about 4. 5 t/ha. Padi Tanam Sabatang/PTS (One-stem Planting Rice), is a rice-planting movement are programmed by the Agricultural Service of West Sumatra Province with District/City Agricultural Service all of West Sumatra. PTS that recommended since 2006 is actually a modification of the SRI technology. Component technologies that are emphasized include: the use of organic fertilizer, planting young seedlings one plant per hill, plant spacing of 30 x 30 cm or more, and the setting limited puddle during growth. Result achievement of rice with PTS technology about 7. 0 t/ha. PTS has been applied to the level of Farmers Group or farmers through PTS-Field School.

This data collection consists of primary dataset with accompanying documents for 'General Households Survey and Choice Experiment' {{segment of the}} data for work package 6 (WP 6) of the ESPA (ecosystem services for poverty alleviation) -funded P 4 ges project (see Related resources). WP 6 {{is concerned with the}} socio-economic aspects of the research undertaken within P 4 ges project. The survey was designed to provide background information on household composition, livelihoods and assets for use in analysis looking at the opportunity cost of conservation using discrete choice experiment and for selecting a sub-sample for more detailed follow-up surveys looking at agricultural practices, productivity and use of wild harvested products. The data was collected between June 2014 and June 2015 and comprises of 603 households. Project description: Zafy lives in a village on edge of the forest in Madagascar. He wants the best for his family and so uses the resources and options he has open to him and clears a patch of forest to grow <b>hill</b> <b>rice.</b> His hard labour pays off and he is able to sell a small surplus. Rakoto farms rice on the valley floor. In good years, when there is plenty of water, he produces more than his family can eat. However as the forest on the slopes continues to be cut, water in the dry season is reduced, and there are fewer and fewer good years. That tropical deforestation threatens species' survival is well known to the general public. There is also increasing awareness that it contributes to climate change (through the release of carbon stored in trees and soils). Zafy's story demonstrates that although cutting down forest is often presented as wanton destruction, it may well be a perfectly sensible choice for the people directly involved. It also shows that some negative impacts of deforestation may be felt locally as well as globally. In recent years a new approach to conserving tropical forests has evolved. The central idea is that those who benefit from the existence of forest should pay those who would otherwise cut it down. This concept is known as payment for ecosystem services and has come to dominate discussions about rainforest conservation. People who support this approach argue that it will benefit poor people like Zafy, who will be compensated for not clearing forest, through cash payments or development activities in their area. In addition, the land-use changes which will be encouraged under the payment schemes (protecting forest or planting new forest) may benefit other poor people in the area; for example Rakoto may benefit from increased forest cover through improved flow of water to his rice fields. Unfortunately nothing is ever as simple as it seems. While these payments for ecosystem services schemes are attracting millions of dollars, and there is a commitment by many involved to ensure they are beneficial for poor people, questions remain both about the impact current schemes are having on the poor and about how these schemes could be designed to realise any potential for alleviating poverty while avoiding harm. These vitally important questions need a research approach which brings together specialists with a range of expertise. Our team involves sociologists, economists, ecologists, hydrologists, remote sensing experts and modellers who will explore the complex ways in which international ecosystem service payments affect the lives of poor people. Specific questions we will address include quantifying the benefits which lowland rice farmers may expect from increasing forest cover, exploring the costs (and who bears them) of reduced access for wild-product harvesting, and investigating how politics and social structures influence how any benefits from payments are distributed. We focus on a single area (the eastern rainforests), in a single country (Madagascar). Such a narrow focus is necessary to get the complete picture which takes account of all the interactions between ecological and social systems. Although we focus field work within Madagascar, and our results will directly influence payment schemes in the country, our project's findings will also have a much wider impact. We are working closely with those involved in developing the policies which underpin payment schemes, and in implementing them on the ground both in Madagascar and worldwide. Our project will result in scientific papers which push the boundaries of interdisciplinary research, and interesting coverage in the media and on our project website. However through this wider engagement our project will also result in concrete changes to the design of payment schemes which should improve the lives of people like Rakoto, Zafy and their families, wherever they live in the world...|$|E
