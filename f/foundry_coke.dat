40|$|Genotoxic {{carcinogenic}} compounds react chemically with DNA and proteins to form covalent adducts which, in {{the case}} of DNA adducts, are strongly {{believed to be the first}} step in cancer process (biologically effective dose). The paper reviews the main studies on the dosimetry of adducts in the biological monitoring of occupational exposure to mutagens and carcinogens. Dosimetry of DNA adducts has been used to assess exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in environments such as <b>foundries,</b> <b>coke</b> ovens and the aluminium industry. In many cases, adduct levels higher than those of control populations were found in exposed workers. Only one study reported increased levels of DNA adducts in workers exposed to styrene. Dosimetry of hemoglobin adducts has been used to identify occupational exposure to ethylene oxide, styrene, BaP and arylamines. The results obtained in the last few years confirm the usefulness of dosimetry of DNA and protein adducts in assessing occupational exposure to genotoxic carcinogens occurring in working environments, even at very low exposure levels, but the methods in question require high standardization and validation if systematic errors in measurement are to be avoided. In the coming years, dosimetry of adducts, together with evaluation of individual genetic sensitivity to mutagens and carcinogens, will be one of the new frontiers in research on the prevention of occupational cancer. Current research already makes use of sophisticated analytical techniques such as mass spectrometry, and both specificity and sensitivity in the determination of adducts have been considerably improved. In the future, therefore, dosimetry of adducts may also be applied to industrial health practices...|$|R

40|$|This Department of Energy National Energy Technology Laboratory {{sponsored}} research {{effort to}} develop environmentally cleaner projects as a spin-off of the FutureGen project, which seeks to reduce or eliminate emissions from plants that utilize coal for power or hydrogen production. New clean coal conversion processes were designed and tested for coproducing clean pitches and cokes used in the metals industry {{as well as a}} heavy crude oil. These new processes were based on direct liquefaction and pyrolysis techniques that liberate volatile liquids from coal without the need for high pressure or on-site gaseous hydrogen. As a result of the research, a commercial scale plant for the production of synthetic <b>foundry</b> <b>coke</b> has broken ground near Wise, Virginia under the auspices of Carbonite Inc. This plant will produce <b>foundry</b> <b>coke</b> by pyrolyzing a blend of steam coal feedstocks. A second plant is planned by Quantex Energy Inc (in Texas) which will use solvent extraction to coproduce a coke residue as well as crude oil.

40|$|Eight tons of CTC/DOE {{formed coke}} of 6 inches x 5 inches x 4 inches size were {{produced}} in the PDU. This coke will be tested at 100 percent formed coke charge in a commercial size foundry. A scheduled test run was postponed due to production requirements at the foundry. <b>Foundry</b> <b>coke</b> was produced from weakly coking Colorado coal. Blending of this coal with 40 percent of stronger caking, higher rank coals was required. Western coal from the Rosebud seam was pyrolyzed to upgrade this low rank, high moisture coal.

30|$|The {{calorific values}} {{of all the}} coal samples are high enough {{and can be used}} for power generation. The Shankodi-Jangwa coal sample with the highest heating value of 6, 502.70 [*]cal/g may be the best for heating and power generation, but it may require sulphur {{reduction}} prior to use. The lower sulphur contents of both Tai and Garin Maiganga coal samples make them more suitable for smokeless fuel production, heating of residential buildings, firing kiln for cement production, raising steam for power generation and in <b>foundry</b> <b>coke</b> production without any concern of sulphur pollution. The coal samples may be used for liquefaction because lignitic, sub-bituminous and high-volatile bituminous coals are potentially good for liquefaction to produce synthetic crude oil and tar[23]. For coal gasification, the Shankodi-Jangwa coal sample, being bituminous, is the only coal sample with potentials for hydro-gasification to produce methane, even though there may be a problem of caking because bituminous coals are known to cake on gasification[23].|$|E
30|$|Sulphur {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{undesirable}} elements in coal. The Shankodi-Jangwa coal sample had the highest sulphur content of 1.63 %, which is above the maximum acceptable limit of 1.5 % to 1.60 %[17]. High sulphur must be reduced during iron and steel making either by modifying the blast furnace burden with a consequence reduction in iron output or by external desulphurizing technique which are both money- and time-consuming[17]. Even though sulphur contributes to the heating value of coal, on combustion, it produces acids of sulphur dioxide (SO 2) and sulphur trioxide (SO 3) which corrode the equipment and also cause atmospheric pollution. Sulphur also affects clinkering and slagging tendencies in boilers, corrodes chimneys and other equipment such as air heaters and economizers and limits flue gas exit temperature. The sulphur contents of both Tai and Garin Maiganga coal samples are within the acceptable limit; they may be suitable for smokeless fuel production, heating of residential buildings, firing kiln for cement production, raising steam for power generation and in <b>foundry</b> <b>coke</b> production.|$|E

In the research re-ported here, a ize was modified by a gas-fired melting and/or ing chamber into the stack above {{the level of the}} coke bed, for study as a prototype for a coal-fired melting chamber. The modified cupola, in which natural gas was used to partially replace <b>foundry</b> <b>coke,</b> was evaluated in several trial runs.

40|$|This study {{reports on}} overfeed packed bed char {{combustion}} experiments and modelling. Experimental results {{are used to}} verify the assumptions of an existing char combustion simulation. The computer model uses finite volume discretization methods to predict temperature and concentration profiles for packed bed char combustion. Also, the behaviour of ash in a packed bed is explored and incorporated into the model by accounting for the effect of ash on such properties as bed void fraction and heat and mass transfer processes. The effects of air flow rate and bed depth on the burning rate, the bed temperature and gas concentrations are also examined. Experiments were performed in a reactor 23 cm in diameter and 20 cm high. Thermocouples measured bed temperatures and a water-cooled probe sampled bed gases. Gas samples were analysed for CO 2, CO and O 2 using a gas chromatograph. The fuel was <b>foundry</b> <b>coke</b> with a particle diameter in the 1 cm size range. Experiments were run for bed heights ranging from 5 to 15 cm and air flow rates of 191 to 520 kg/m 2 hr. Comparison of the experimental bed profiles and burning rates with model predictions shows good agreement, indicating that the model can reliably predict packed bed char combustion. Species concentrations are shown to be only dependent on bed depth; whereas the burning rate {{is a function of}} both the bed depth and air flow rate. The data also show that the ash properties are highly dependent on the operating conditions; since the model predictions are very sensitive to the ash properties, a relationship between ash properties and temperature needs to be developed and included in the model. More research is also needed on the CO 2 reduction reaction parameters and pore diffusion model and the oxidation kinetics in the ash layer...|$|E
40|$|Char, {{the major}} {{co-product}} of mild coal gasification, represents about 70 {{percent of the}} total product yield. The only viable use for the char is in the production of formed coke. Early work to develop formed coke used char from a pilot plant sized mild gasification unit (MGU), which was based on commercial units of the COALITE plant in England. Formed coke was made at a bench-scale production level using MGU chars from different coals. An evolutionary formed coke development process over a two-year period resulted in formed coke production at bench-scale levels that met metallurgical industries` specifications. In an ASTM D 5341 reactivity test by a certified lab, the coke tested CRI 30. 4 and CSR 67. 0 which is excellent. The standard is CRI 55. In 1991, a continuous 1000 pounds per hour coal feed mild coal gasification pilot plant (CMGU) was completed. The gasification unit is a heated unique screw conveyor designed to continuously process plastic coal, vent volatiles generated by pyrolysis of coal, and convert the plastic coal to free flowing char. The screw reactor auxiliary components are basic solids materials handling equipment. The screw reactor will convert coal to char and volatile co-products at a rate greater than 1000 pounds per hour of coal feed. Formed coke from CMGU char is comparable to that from the MGU char. In pilot-plant test runs, up to 20 tons of <b>foundry</b> <b>coke</b> were produced. Three formed coke tests at commercial foundries were successful. In all of the cupola tests, the iron temperature and composition data indicated that the formed coke performed satisfactorily. No negative change in the way the cupola performed was noticed. The last 20 -ton test was 100 percent CTC/DOE coke. With conventional coke in this cupola charging rates were 10 charges per hour. The formed coke charges were 11 to 12 charges per hour. This equates to a higher melt rate. A 10 percent increase in cupola production would be a major advantage. 13 figs., 13 tabs...|$|E
