The use of infinitesimals will often require the application of calculus whereas circuits analysed by the lumped element model can be solved with linear algebra. The distributed model is consequently only usually applied when accuracy calls for its use. Where this point is dependent on the accuracy required in a specific application, but essentially, it needs to be used in circuits where the wavelengths of the signals have become comparable to the physical dimensions of the components.

A basic <b>rule</b> of reliability <b>engineering</b> {{is that the}} level of independent redundancy should increase with increasing risk of fatal system failure.

Shrubs in humid environments tend to be hydraulically integrated, with single, round basal stems, whereas dryland shrubs typically have modular hydraulic systems and multiple, segmented basal stems. Modularity is achieved anatomically at the vessel-network scale or developmentally at the whole-plant scale through asymmetric secondary growth, which results in a semiclonal or clonal shrub growth form that appears to be ubiquitous in global deserts. 6 page(s...|$|R

40|$|In {{the near}} future a {{significant}} increase in electric power consumption in vehicles is to be expected. To limit the associated increase in fuel consumption and exhaust emissions, smart strategies for the generation, storage/retrieval, distribution and consumption of the electric power can be used. This paper considers a vehicle configuration with a conventional drive train. Two energy management strategies that control the alternator power are analysed: a regenerative braking strategy and a more advanced strategy based on optimisation techniques. The potential behind these strategies is analysed by studying the typical characteristics of components that are directly related to the energy flow in the vehicle. It is shown that operating the internal combustion engine at the highest efficiency will not inherently lead to the lowest fuel consumption. Subsequently, <b>engineering</b> <b>rules</b> are presented to evaluate the performance that can be expected for each strategy.

40|$|Because {{the amount}} of {{knowledge}} in the engineering domain nowadays is huge, while being opaque, heterogeneous, distributed and informal at the same time, it is incredibly time-consuming for an engineer to find the knowledge (s) {{he is looking for}} and to reuse that knowledge. Furthermore, {{the amount of}} knowledge is growing exponentially, while the amount of qualified engineers is decreasing. To increase resource effectiveness and enable engineers to focus on what they do best (come up with creative design solutions) these time-consuming and non-creative tasks need to be removed from the engineer’s plate. This study set out to investigate and offer solutions to the issue of knowledge reuse relating to the knowledge contained in <b>engineering</b> <b>rules,</b> in context of a Knowledge-Based Engineering (KBE) based Multi-Disciplinary Optimization (MDO) framework, called the Integrated Design and Engineering Engine (IDEE). This research has investigated the different rule types that are required for capturing <b>engineering</b> <b>rules.</b> It was shown that these can be captured by a production rule language. To formally capture this knowledge, this research has identified the available technologies and based on this, extended the ontology based Knowledge Representation Model (KRM) of the IDEE with the production rule language RIF-PRD. <b>Engineering</b> <b>rules</b> are integrated into the KRM by means of a rule ontology that embeds the RIF-PRD expression. It was found that expressing formulas would benefit from an additional extension, which was added {{in the form of the}} mathematical language Content MathML. Formulas expressed in Content MathML are embedded into RIF-PRD. To increase the effectiveness of the IDEE approach, an implementation has been created by the author that provides the means to capture and reuse <b>engineering</b> <b>rules</b> in a more user-friendly way; from the point of informal capture to the generation of KBE application code usable by a KBE system, and the generation of process workflows usable by Simulation Work Flow Management (SWFM) tools. In addition, the implementation incorporates a reasoning engine in the form of elREy. This provides the IDEE with reasoning capabilities, used for instance to instantiate workflows. From the use cases it became apparent that all identified <b>engineering</b> <b>rules</b> were able to be captured by the extended KRM via the implementation. The implementation facilitated the modeling considerable. Because of the guidance the user gets, it is even for beginning rule modelers impossible to make a syntax error. For experienced programmers, the semi-graphical modeling might go somewhat slower, though, also due to annotation steps, but the value this brings in return is huge. The annotation provides so much information regarding origin, author, explanations, etc. that it makes the rules and the rationale easy to understand, even long after the creation of the knowledge. Because rules are stored separately they can be managed easily and directly linked to. Due to the capture of the semantics the knowledge contained in rules is easy to find, update and reuse, saving time (and money). Moreover, non-creative tasks carried out in order to reuse knowledge can be automated (e. g. generation of a KBE application). In addition, rules are platform independent and centrally stored, making sure that the knowledge they contain will not be lost and one consistent model is used in the entire framework.
