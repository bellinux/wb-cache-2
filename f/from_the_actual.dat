5|$|Meanwhile, at Cap Nègre to {{the west}} of the main invasion, a large group of French commandos {{destroyed}} German artillery emplacements as part of Operation Romeo. Their main effort was supported by diversionary flank landings by other commando teams. While the main mission succeeded, 67 French commandos were taken prisoner after they ran into a minefield. In addition to the commando operations, another operation was carried out, named Operation Span. This was a deception plan, aimed to confuse the German defenders with fake landings and paratroopers, to disperse them <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> landing zones.|$|E
5|$|Samantha tells Mulder {{that the}} Bounty Hunter and the clones are {{actually}} aliens, and the Bounty Hunter will begin chasing her {{as soon as}} he has killed the remaining clones. Meanwhile, Scully heads to a hotel to hide from the Bounty Hunter. Returning to the lab, she finds four more clones, who claim to be the last. Scully arranges for them to be transported to a safe place, but the Bounty Hunter follows her and watches. At her hotel room, Scully lets in a man who seems to be Mulder, only to receive a phone call <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> Mulder soon after.|$|E

5|$|The {{back story}} in the {{published}} synopsis differs <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> production in a few aspects. When the organ grinder takes the children back to his hovel, the inter-title states {{they are forced to}} dance. In the synopsis, it states the children are instructed to dance to the hurdy-gurdy. The organ grinder does not play a hurdy-gurdy. In the published synopsis the parents are named Eugenie Freeman and Paul Temple. However, the letter the father receives is addressed to Paul Tilden. The letter informs him of Joseph Tilden's death and of the $100,000 inheritance.|$|E
5|$|The lack of {{gameplay}} {{information was}} also criticized. Laura Parker found the trailer disconnected <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> game, with the trailer being misleading by not showing any in-game information, {{and with the}} game failing to deliver the same emotional effect as the trailer. Daemon Hatfield from IGN similarly thought that the trailer was not useful in assessing the game's quality and expressed concerns that the game {{would not be as}} entertaining and interesting as the trailer. Upon release, many reviewers thought that the trailer had set expectation too high for the actual game, and that the game ended up not meeting expectations.|$|E

5|$|A {{hurricane}} in {{the middle}} of September affected some of the same areas along the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico as the August hurricane. It was first detected on the evening of September 10 in the southeastern Gulf, although its track may be far off <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> storms movement {{due to a lack of}} available information. Its first data point in the hurricane database lists it as possessing sustained winds of , placing it at Category 2 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The storm followed a broad northward curve through the central Gulf of Mexico, making landfall along the Mississippi River Delta of Louisiana on the night of September 14. It continued toward the north-northeast, dissipating on September 16.|$|E
5|$|Building {{practices}} {{along the}} coast also included boathouses, fishing cottages, piers, etc. Here, houses for livestock and people were typically built up <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> shoreline. A typical medium-sized farm in the inland of Norway would include a dwelling house (våningshus), hay barn (låve), livestock barn (fjøs), one or more food storage houses (stabbur), a stable, and occasionally separate houses for poultry, pigs, etc. Houses that had separate heat sources, e.g., washing houses (eldhus) and smithies were usually kept separate from the other houses to prevent fires. Outhouses were typically separate, small structures. If the farm housed craftsmen, there would also be separate houses for carpentry, wheel making, shoemaking, etc.|$|E
5|$|The {{film version}} of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom was {{released}} in 1984 and starred Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones. A year later, in 1985, Atari Games capitalized on the franchise by releasing the initial version of the game on arcade machine. This version was a platform and fighting game and featured theme music and sound clips <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> film. The game takes place over three zones {{that are based on}} the movie's plot, where the objective is to free the slave children and recover the Sankara stones. This version was also the first translated from any of the movies in the Indiana Jones series into an arcade game, although Raiders of the Lost Ark for the Atari 2600 and Indiana Jones in the Lost Kingdom for the Commodore 64 had come out in 1982 and 1985 respectively.|$|E

5|$|This pyramid was {{the last}} pyramid ever built {{as part of a}} {{mortuary}} complex in Egypt. The pyramid would be abandoned by subsequent pharaohs of the New Kingdom, for both practical and religious reasons. The Giza plateau offered plenty of room for building pyramids; but {{this was not the case}} with the confined, cliff-bound geography of Thebes and any burials in the surrounding desert were vulnerable to flooding. The pyramid form was associated with the sun god Re, who had been overshadowed by Amun in importance. One of the meanings of Amun's name was the hidden one, which meant that it was now theologically permissible to hide the Pharaoh's tomb by fully separating the mortuary template <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> burial place. This provided the added advantage that the resting place of the pharaoh could be kept hidden from necropolis robbers. All subsequent pharaohs of the New Kingdom would be buried in rock-cut shaft tombs in the Valley of the Kings.|$|E
5|$|Grim Fandango mixed static pre-rendered {{background}} {{images with}} 3D characters and objects. Part {{of this decision}} was based on how the calaca figures would appear in three dimensions. There were more than 90 sets and 50 characters in the game to be created and rendered; Manny's character alone comprised 250 polygons. The development team found that by utilizing three-dimensional models to pre-render the backgrounds, they could alter the camera shot to achieve more effective or dramatic angles for certain scenes simply by re-rendering the background, {{instead of having to}} have an artist redraw the background for a traditional 2D adventure game. The team adapted the engine to allow Manny's head to move separately from his body to make the player aware of important objects nearby. The 3D engine also aided in the choreography between the spoken dialog and body and arm movements of the characters. Additionally, full motion video cutscenes were incorporated to advance the plot, using the same in-game style for the characters and backgrounds to make them nearly indistinguishable <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> game.|$|E
