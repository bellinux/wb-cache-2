500|$|The RD-93 {{is known}} to produce smoke trails. The Guizhou Aero <b>Engine</b> <b>Group</b> has been {{developing}} a new turbofan engine, the WS-13 Taishan, since 2000 to replace the RD-93. It {{is based on the}} Klimov RD-33 and incorporates new technologies to boost performance and reliability. A thrust output of , a lifespan of 2,200 hours, and a thrust-to-weight ratio of 8.7 are expected. An improved version of the WS-13, developing a thrust of around [...] (22,450lb), is also reportedly under development. During the 2015 Paris Air Show, it was announced that flight testing of a JF-17 equipped with the WS-13 engine had begun. In 2015, a representative of Pakistan Aeronautical Complex said that Pakistan would continue to use the RD-93 engine on their fighters. Local media reports in Jan 2016 say that, Russia is planning to sell engines for JF-17 directly to Pakistan. According to a PAC representative, Pakistan is looking to collaborate with Russia in developing and repairing engines ...|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the design and testing period the absence of a suitable, serially produced light aircraft engine was a concern and the wing was therefore mounted so that it could be moved fore and aft to allow for the varying centre of gravity positions resulting from engines of different weight. [...] A glider version was contemplated though not finally used. [...] Instead, the flight programme began with the L20 powered by the [...] Harley-Davidson motor cycle engine used in the L15. [...] By mid 1925 this had been replaced with a new engine, the [...] air-cooled, flat twin Mercedes F7502a, which Klemm had persuaded Daimler's <b>engine</b> <b>group</b> to design and build for the light aircraft market. The cost of flying the L20 was low as its cruise fuel consumption was only 63 mL/km (45 mpg). From 1926 the uprated [...] Mercedes F7502b was fitted. [...] The F7502 was central {{to the success of the}} L20, though it suffered from repeated rocker arm failures.|$|E
