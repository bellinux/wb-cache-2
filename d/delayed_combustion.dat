The characteristic parameters of the flame are derived from flame images that are captured using a vision-based flame monitoring system. Experiments were carried out on a 0. 5 MWth coal combustion test facility. Different flue gas recycle ratios and furnace oxygen levels were created for two different coals. The characteristics of the flame and the correlation between the measured flame parameters and corresponding combustion conditions are described and discussed. The results show that the flame temperature decreases with the recycle ratio for both test coals, suggesting that the flame temperature is effectively controlled by the flue gas recycle ratio. The presence of high levels of CO 2 at high flue gas recycle ratios may result in <b>delayed</b> <b>combustion</b> and thus has a detrimental effect on the flame stability...|$|E

Initially, castor eat oil and their blends were chosen. The physical and chemical properties of Castor oil, Mustard oil and its blend were determined. In general, viscosity of neat vegetable oil is high, which can be reduced through blending with diesel and heating them. The performance and emission characteristics of engine are determined using Castor and Mustard oil and their blends with diesel. These results are compared to those of pure diesel. Byanalyzing the graphs, it was observed that the performance characteristics are reduced and emission characteristics are increased at the rated load compared to those of diesel. This is mainly due to lower calorific value, high viscosity and <b>delayed</b> <b>combustion</b> process. From the critical analysis of graphs, it can be observed that 10 % of Castor oil and Mustard oil mixture mixed with 90 % of diesel is the best suited blend for Diesel engine without eating and without any engine modifications.

40|$|In a hypergolic {{internal}} combustion engine, with a given amount of fuel per power stroke, {{we wish to}} optimize the output work and the efficiency by controlling fuel injection. We assume the engine is ideal except for friction losses which are given {{as a function of}} the cylinder pressure. The optimization is determined through calculations of thermodynamic efficiency, cylinder pressure versus crank angle and friction loss characteristics. A mathematical model is developed, and since the efficiency consists of output work over input fuel constraint, a calculus of variations approach will be used for solving the problem. The constraint however is not constant but variable. A new approach shows, among the value of constraint, that the maximum efficiency can be optimized. Its inverse problem, in which the output work is constraint, also can be optimized. The results of optimizing the problem, show that the fuel injection starting angle is approximately 5 (DEGREES) after top dead center regardless of the amount of fuel injection per cycle, while the ending angle varies from approximately 8 (DEGREES) to 20 (DEGREES) with increasing fuel injection per cycle. In a hypergolic combustion engine, since the fuel is activated, the <b>delayed</b> <b>combustion</b> is not expected.

40|$|Premixed charge {{compression}} ignition {{mode of operation}} simultaneously reduces oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and particulate matter with improved fuel economy. Late injection is one such strategy to achieve premixed charge {{compression ignition}} mode along with the control over the ignition timing. Late injection along with charge dilution retards combustion and prepares homogeneous mixture by providing sufficient ignition delay. The in-cylinder charge distribution dictates mixture formation which affects the performance and emissions characteristics. Experimental results fail to provide an insight of the in-cylinder processes involved. Hence, numerical simulations have been performed to get in-cylinder distributions of scalars, which help in understanding the combustion process. The work consists of late in-cylinder injection of Diesel wherein the heat release rate trace shows only a premixed mode with lower soot and NOx. The absence of diffusion combustion confirms that the engine operates in a premixed charge compression ignition mode. In this work, effects of various injection parameters and swirl ratio on engine in-cylinder processes, performance and exhaust emissions have been studied using a three-dimensional model with detailed chemistry by using Converge, a computational fluid dynamics tool. Increasing swirl ratio improved air-fuel mixing causing lower soot emission {{up to a certain}} limit beyond which further increase in swirl ratio led to higher soot emission due to increased heat loss. Delayed start of injection resulted in <b>delayed</b> <b>combustion</b> leading to lower soot and NOx emission but partial oxidation resulted in higher carbon monoxide (CO) emissions.

40|$|As the CO 2 {{emission}} standards {{around the world}} become more stringent, the turbocharged downsized gasoline direct injection (GDI) engine provides a mature platform to achieve better fuel economy. For this reason, {{it is expected that}} the GDI engine will capture increasing shares of the market during the coming years. The in-cylinder liquid injection, though advantageous in most engine operation regimes, creates emissions challenges during the cold crank-start and cold fast-idle phases. The engine cold-start is responsible for a disproportionate share of the hydrocarbons (HC), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) emitted over the certification cycle. Understanding the sources of the pollutants during this stage is necessary for the further market penetration of GDI under the constraint of tighter {{emission standards}}. This work aims to examine the formation processes of the HC, NOx and PM emissions during the cold-start phase in a GDI engine, and the sensitivity of the pollutant emissions to different operation strategies. To this end, a detailed analysis of the crank-start was carried out, in which the first three engine cycles were individually examined. For the steady-state phase, the trade-off between low fast-idle emissions and high exhaust thermal enthalpy flow, necessary for fast catalyst warm-up, is investigated under several operation strategies. The pollutant formation processes are strongly dependent on the mixture formation and on the temperature and pressure history of the combustion process. The results show that unconventional valve timing strategies with large, symmetric, negative valve overlap and <b>delayed</b> <b>combustion</b> phasing are the most effective ways to reduce engine-out emissions during both crank-start and fast-idle phases. by Juan Felipe Rodríguez.

40|$|Practical {{application}} of Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) combustion must demonstrate robust responses to variations in environmental conditions. This work examines {{the impact of}} ambient conditions and fuel changes on HCCI engine operation, and evaluates cam phasing as a mechanism to compensate for these changes. Experiments were carried out on a modified 2. 3 L 14 production engine, and HCCI operation was achieved {{by the use of}} residual trapping by negative valve overlap. The first phase of the project examined the impact of changes in intake air temperature and humidity on HCCI operation. Exhaust cam phasing was used to control load, and intake cam phasing was use to produce a change in combustion phasing. Cam timing control was largely able to compensate for changes in combustion due to changes in air temperature and humidity. Higher intake air temperature advanced combustion phasing and resulted in a 1 bar reduction of the net indicated mean effective pressure (NIMEP) at the high load limit for lower engine speeds. Intake air temperature did have more of an impact during lean operation. Higher intake air humidity <b>delayed</b> <b>combustion</b> phasing. (cont.) During stoichiometric operation, this delay allowed a small extension (a few tenths of a bar in NIMEP) in the high load limit. During lean operation, the delay in combustion timing resulted in a reduction of the high load limit. The second phase of the project examined the impact of market fuel composition variations on HCCI operation. Twelve test fuels were created to vary the composition of 5 fuel properties: Research Octane Number (RON), Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP), olefin content, aromatic content, and ethanol content. The test fuels were blends of different commercial refinery streams and contained hundreds of different hydrocarbons to be representative market gasolines. Fuel type was found to have only a small impact on the HCCI operating range, and cam phasing was largely able to compensate for changes in fuel composition. The main effect of the different fuel composition appeared to be differences in ignition delay. by Morgan M. Andreae. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|In {{low-temperature}} combustion {{concepts such}} as partially premixed <b>combustion,</b> the ignition <b>delay</b> should be large enough {{in order to ensure}} sufficient fuel and air mixing before the start of combustion. It is also necessary that the combustion timing is sufficiently well phased for high thermal efficiency. Since the ignition <b>delay</b> and <b>combustion</b> timing are intimately coupled, the decoupling of these two quantities gives rise to an interesting multiple input, multiple output control problem where the control of the air system and the fuel injection system have to be combined.

40|$|The {{article of}} record as {{published}} {{may be found}} at [URL] support of an ongoing U. S. Navy alternative fuel evaluation program, the combustion characteristics of two very different alternative diesel fuels were evaluated in a direct-injection marine diesel engine {{across a variety of}} speeds and loads. The fuels were an algal-based hydrotreated renewable diesel fuel (HRD) with cetane number of ∼ 75 and a synthetic paraffinic kerosene (SPK) with cetane number of ∼ 25. These fuels were experimentally tested as blends with conventional petroleumbased military diesel fuel (designated F- 76) with cetane ≈ 46, giving a cetane number range from 25 to 75. Start of injection (SOI) was characterized using a strain gauge to determine actuation of the mechanical unit injector; SOI remained essentially unchanged for changes in fuel type. As expected based on cetane number, ignition delay (IGD) increased with greater amounts of SPK fuel and decreased for greater amounts of HRD fuel in the test blend. Energy release analysis showed that longer IGD led consistently to slightly advanced combustion phasing, as indicated by the location of 50 % mass fraction burned, decreased overall combustion duration, and greater maximum rate of pressure rise due to greater fuel-air premixing. Fuel consumption was 0 − 5 % higher for these alternative fuels. Ignition delay was modeled using a detailed primary reference fuel mechanism tuned to match the measured cetane number of each neat and blended fuel. The modeled chemistry was able to capture relative changes in the experimentally observed IGD, suggesting that the measured differences in physical properties, which will affect spray development, do not contribute as significantly to differences in IGD. The results suggest that typical higher cetane alternative fuels, such as HRD, have no deleterious effects from the perspective of combustion characteristics. Processes that yield lower cetane alternative fuels, such as SPK, while still achieving satisfactory performance, begin to show signs of problems through <b>delayed</b> <b>combustion,</b> increased rates of pressure rise, and higher peak pressures, which induce higher mechanical stress and combustion noise.

40|$|Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) {{engines are}} one of the most {{promising}} engine technologies for the future of energy conversion from clean, efficient combustion. HCCI engines allow high efficiency and lower CO 2 emission through the use of high compression ratios and the removal of intake throttle valves (like Diesel), and allow very low levels of urban pollutants like nitric oxide and soot (like Otto). These engines, however, are not without their challenges, such as low power density compared with other engine technologies, and a difficulty in controlling combustion timing. This dissertation first addresses the power output limits. The particular strategies for enabling high power output investigated in this dissertation focus on avoiding five critical limits that either damage an engine, drastically reduce efficiency, or drastically increase emissions: 1) ringing limits, 2) peak in-cylinder pressure limits, 3) misfire limits, 4) low intake temperature limits, and 5) excessive emissions limits. The research shows that the key factors that enable high power output, sufficient for passenger vehicles, while simultaneously avoiding the five limits defined above are the use of: 1) high intake air pressures allowing improved power output, 2) highly <b>delayed</b> <b>combustion</b> timing to avoid ringing limits, and 3) using the highest possible equivalence ratio before encountering ringing limits. These results are revealed by conducting extensive experiments spanning a wide range of operating conditions on a multi-cylinder HCCI engine. Second, this dissertation discusses strategies for effectively sensing combustion characteristics on a HCCI engine. For effective feedback control of HCCI combustion timing, a sensor is required to quantify when combustion occurs. Many laboratory engines use in-cylinder pressure sensors but these sensors are currently prohibitively expensive for wide-scale commercialization. Instead, ion sensors made from inexpensive sparkplugs are proposed for sensing combustion timing. Ion sensing, however, is unreliable under certain HCCI conditions. The dissertation presents two strategies for improving the usefulness of ion sensors in HCCI engines: 1) the use of tiny fractions of metal-acetate fuel additives that expand the useful range of ion sensors, and 2) the use of ion sensors for detecting excessive ringing that must be avoided in HCCI engines. These two innovative research efforts make ion sensors viable for sensing combustion characteristics across the full range of HCCI operation, making them effective for use in engine control systems. In summary, this Ph. D dissertation addresses two important technical challenges facing HCCI engines: power output limits, and difficulty in sensing combustion characteristics for control applications. The strategies proposed in this dissertation research bring HCCI engines closer to widespread commercialization allowing vehicles to operate with significantly higher efficiency and with cleaner emissions...|$|E

The study covers a wide range of engine load and speed operating conditions, comprising measurements of cylinder pressure diagrams, high-pressure fuel pipe pressures, exhaust gas temperatures, fuel consumptions, exhaust smokiness and exhaust gas emissions (nitrogen oxides, unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide). Processing of the measurements provides important performance parameters such as maximum combustion pressure, dynamic injection timing, ignition <b>delay,</b> <b>combustion</b> irregularity and knocking tendency. The differences in the measured performance and exhaust emission parameters are determined for engine operation with JP- 8 fuel, against baseline engine operation using diesel fuel. The study shows that the exhaust emission levels are not much different for operation with the two fuels. On the contrary, operation with JP- 8 fuel increases combustion pressures, combustion intensity and irregularity. This is caused mainly by high pressure fluctuations present in the fuel injection system due to the different physical properties of JP- 8 fuel (compared to diesel fuel), which totally change the injection characteristics. Retardation of the static injection timing is one means of improving this situation, while using the same fuel injection equipment. (C) 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

SPFI is a system developed to convert any externally-mixing (port injection, carburetor) spark ignition engine to direct injection by combining fuel injectors into spark plugs. The burning rates of methane were measured using normalized combustion pressure method, where the normalized pressure rise due to combustion {{is equivalent to the}} mass fraction burnt at the specific crank angle. A single cylinder research engine was installed with the SPFI system. Cylinder pressures were taken with engine running at 1100 rpm and stoichiometric air/fuel ratio.

Results showed that SPFI direct injection, increased the volumetric efficiency by 11 % compared to port injection, resulting in higher heating value of cylinder charge per cycle.

40|$|Abstract—Simulation of {{combustion}} in SI engines {{has been}} an interesting research topic for several decades. Successful simulation of combustion depends {{very much on the}} accuracy with which the combustion process itself could be predicted in terms of the <b>combustion</b> duration, ignition <b>delay,</b> <b>combustion</b> temperature and pressure, flame velocities and heat release rates etc. New and improved models for predicting the “Overall Combustion Duration”, “Ignition Delay”, which take into account primarily the influence of Compression ratio on the overall combustion process in SI engines have been developed for a more precise simulation of combustion in SI engines. Taylor’s original equation for predicting the overall combustion duration has been modified by including a logistic equation for the error term and incorporating it in the original equation. Ignition delay as proposed by Keck et al., has been modified by incorporating a polynomial of 3 rd order into the original equation. A program in Turbo-C++ has been developed for the complete simulation of SI engine combustion, taking into account the variable specific heats of burnt gases, dissociation of gases at high temperatures, progressive combustion phenomena, heat transfer (based on Woschni`s equation), gas exchange process based on 1 D-steady gas flow equation employing Taylor’s mach index of 0. 6 for valve design. The program is very handy to make preliminary parametric studies which may later be validated experimentally.

Further use and distribution of this paper requires permission from SAE International. Controlled auto ignition (CAI) {{is a form of}} combustion which uses an auto-ignited homogeneous air/fuel mixture but is controlled (or moderated) by regulating the quantity of internal exhaust gas residuals. In this paper, using a fully variable valve train and a newly developed exhaust valve control strategy, we substituted EGR with hot nitrogen or hot air. We found that the internal exhaust gas residuals have both thermal and chemical effects on CAI combustion. To investigate the thermal effect, nitrogen was used as it is a chemically inert gas. Although its temperature was raised to that of the internal exhaust gas residuals during testing, CAI combustion could not be promoted without assistance from a spark in a form of hybrid CAI, thus indicating that exhaust gas residuals have a chemical effect as well. Conversely, with the introduction of oxygen (which in air is a reactant of combustion), no auto ignition combustion occurred until its temperature was increased to 120 degrees C, proving that a minimum thermal condition of an added gas is required to generate auto-ignition. Comparing this EGR introduction, we found that nitrogen has the ability to <b>delay</b> <b>combustion</b> and smooth the pressure increase rate, while oxygen accelerates combustion and turns CAI combustion into an uncontrollable form normally associated with knock. These effects help to explain the contribution of the chemical effect of the EGR on CAI combustion since exhaust gas residuals contain nitrogen as well as chemically active species...|$|R

At higher loads and at 15 : 1 compression ratio, necessary for good full load efficiency, a less reactive fuel is required to delay auto-ignition and phase combustion correctly.

40|$|Copyright © 2011 SAE International Premixed Charge Compression Ignition (PCCI) is a {{combustion}} {{concept that}} holds the promise of combining emission levels of a spark-ignition engine with the efficiency of a compression-ignition engine. In a short term scenario, PCCI would {{be used in the}} lower load operating range only, combined with conventional diesel combustion at higher loads. This scenario relies on using near standard components and conventional fuels; therefore a set of fuels is selected that only reflects short term changes in diesel fuel composition. Experiments have been conducted in one dedicated test cylinder of a modified 6 -cylinder 12. 6 liter heavy duty DAF engine.

40|$|In opposed-piston folded-cranktrain diesel engines, the {{relative}} movement rules of opposed-pistons, combustion chamber components and injector position {{are different from}} those of conventional diesel engines. The combustion and heat release characteristics of an opposed-piston folded-cranktrain diesel engine under different operating conditions were investigated. Four phases: ignition <b>delay,</b> premixed <b>combustion,</b> diffusion combustion and after combustion are used to describe the heat release process of the engine. Load changing has a small effect on premixed combustion duration while it influences diffusion combustion duration significantly. The heat release process has more significant isochoric and isobaric combustion which differs from the conventional diesel engine situation, except at high exhaust pressure and temperature, due to its two-stroke and uniflow scavenging characteristics. Meanwhile, a relatively high-quality exhaust heat energy is produced in opposed-piston folded-cranktrain diesel engines...|$|R

Results show that the injection timing can be slightly retarded when biodiesel fuel is applied for improved performance and reduced NOx emission. To explain this phenomenon, combustion analysis is conducted based on the cylinder pressure measurement. The shorter ignition <b>delay</b> of biodiesel <b>combustion</b> explains why the best torque timing should be retarded for biodiesel fuel...|$|R

The result {{showed that the}} max combustion pressure was added and the heat release was reduced by the methanol increase. The reason was that the different methanol content could effect the combustion process product such as CH 2 O，H 2 O 2 ，O，OH，H, and effect ignition <b>delay</b> period and <b>combustion</b> duration period, and accordingly effect power and emission. ...|$|R
40|$|Societal {{concerns}} on combustion-based {{fuel consumption}} are ever-increasing. With respect to internal combustion engines, this translates to {{a need to}} increase brake fuel conversion efficiency (BFCE). Diesel engines are a relatively efficient internal combustion engine to consider for numerous applications, but associated actions to mitigate certain exhaust emissions have generally deteriorated engine efficiency. Conventionally, diesel engine emission control has centered on in-cylinder techniques. Although these continue to hold promise, the industry trend is presently favoring the use of after-treatment devices which create new opportunities to improve the diesel engine's brake fuel conversion efficiency. This study focuses on injection timing effects on the combustion processes, engine efficiency, and the engine system's responses. The engine in the study is a medium duty diesel engine (capable of meeting US EPA Tier III off road emission standards) equipped with common rail direct fuel injection, variable geometry turbo charging, and interfaced with a custom built engine controller. The study found that injection timing greatly affected BFCE by changing the combustion phasing. BFCE would increase up to a maximum then begin to decrease as phasing became less favorable. Combustion phasing would change from being mostly mixing controlled combustion to premixed combustion as injection timing would advance allowing more time for fuel to mix during the ignition <b>delay.</b> <b>Combustion</b> phasing, in turn, would influence many other engine parameters. As injection timing is advanced, in-cylinder temperatures and pressures amplify, and intake and exhaust manifold pressures deteriorate. Rate of heat release and rate of heat transfer increase when injection timing is advanced. Turbocharger speed falls with the advancing injection timing. Torque, however, rose to a maximum then fell off again even though engine speed and fueling rate were held constant between different injection timings. Interestingly, the coefficient of heat transfer changes from a two peak curve to a smooth one peak curve as the injection timing is advanced further. The major conclusion {{of the study is}} that injection advance both positively and negatively influences the diesel engine's response which contributes to the brake fuel conversion efficiency...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo {{overcome}} the drawback of using diesel in LTC, a new fuel concept called WDF was proposed in recent years. WDF refers to fuels {{with a wide}} distillation range from initial boiling point (IBP) of gasoline to final boiling point (FBP) of diesel. In this work, two kinds of WDF (GDBF and FDF) were studied for both short-term and long-term consideration. In the study of GDBF, 50 % gasoline proportion is selected as the optimal choice due to the load adaptability;at the same NOx emissions level for Euro VI, G 50 and diesel have similar ITE, G 50 has the soot emissions around the target value of Euro V, while diesel has one orderhigher soot emissionsat high load. In the long term, {{it is not necessary}} to employ different distillation and refinery processes to produce gasoline and diesel fuels. A novel fuel concept named FDF is proposed and an exploration of the feasibility was conducted. The measured physical and chemical properties of FDF indicate that C/H ratio, density and heat value of FDF vary between those of gasoline and diesel fuel and kinematic viscosity is close to the lower limit of diesel, which is benefit to high pressure injection. Cetane number of FDF is in the lower range of diesel fuel. The thermal efficiency, combustion and emission characteristics of a common-rail diesel engine fueled with FDF were experimentally investigated and compared with those burning the conventional diesel fuel and GDBF. The ignition <b>delay,</b> <b>combustion</b> duration changes little compared to diesel fuel while thermal efficiency is higher than diesel and GDBF; the pressure rise rate and heat release rate of FDF are higher than diesel fuel but lower than GDBF, and as the engine load increases, the combustion characteristics of FDF are close to diesel fuel; the soot, NOx and CO emissions of FDF are close to diesel fuel, however, the THC emissions are slightly higher than diesel fuel...|$|R
40|$|The {{article focuses}} on bench testing results of a four-stroke, four-cylinder, direct-injection, {{naturally}} aspirated diesel engine operating on the normal 95 vol % (class C) diesel fuel + 5 vol % RME (DF), F- 34 jet fuel (JF) and jet fuel F- 34 treated with the cetane improver (JF+ 0. 12 vol%). The purpose of the research is to investigate the availability to use of military F- 34 jet fuel for land-based direct injection diesel engine powering and examine the effect of F- 34 fuel and F- 34 fuel treated with 0. 12 vol% 2 -ethylhexyl nitrate on the autoignition <b>delay,</b> <b>combustion,</b> engine performance, emissions and smoke opacity of the exhausts. The peak in-cylinder gas pressure generated from JF and JF+ 0. 12 vol % is lower by 4. 3 % and 2. 8 % at 1400 min– 1 speed, and 2. 5 % and 5. 7 % at 2200 min– 1 speed compared to that 86. 6 MPa and 82. 5 MPa of the normal diesel. At rated 2200 min– 1 speed, the use of treated jet fuel leads to smoother engine performance under all loads and the maximum cylinder pressure gradient lowers by 9. 4 % as against that 15. 9 bar/deg of base diesel. The minimum brake specific fuel consumption (bsfc) for F- 34 and treated F- 34 fuels decreases by 4. 8 % and 3. 5 % at 1400 min– 1 speed and increases by 2. 7 % and 3. 7 % at 2200 min– 1 speed compared to 249. 5 g/kWh and 251. 8 g/kWh values of base diesel. Maximum NO emissions produced from fuels JF and JF+ 0. 12 vol % decrease by 11. 5 % and 7. 0 % at 1400 min– 1, and 17. 1 % and 17. 3 % at 2200 min– 1 speed compared to 1705 ppm and 1389 ppm emanating from the normal diesel.

In microalgae combustion, two peaks at 265 and 485 °C were attributable to combustion of protein and carbohydrate with lipid, respectively. The DTG profile of coal showed one peak with maximum {{mass loss rate}} at 360 °C. Replacement of N₂ by CO₂ <b>delayed</b> the <b>combustion</b> of coal and microalgae.
