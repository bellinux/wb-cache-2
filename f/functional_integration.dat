25|$|<b>Functional</b> <b>integration</b> is {{the study}} of how brain regions work {{together}} to process information and effect responses. Though <b>functional</b> <b>integration</b> frequently relies on anatomic knowledge of the connections between brain areas, the emphasis is on how large clusters of neurons - numbering in the thousands or millions - fire together under various stimuli. The large datasets required for such a whole-scale picture of brain function have motivated the development of several novel and general methods for the statistical analysis of interdependence, such as dynamic causal modelling and statistical linear parametric mapping. These datasets are typically gathered in human subjects by non-invasive methods such as EEG/MEG, fMRI, or PET. The results can be of clinical value by helping to identify the regions responsible for psychiatric disorders, as well as to assess how different activities or lifestyles affect the functioning of the brain.|$|E

2500|$|Over {{the next}} 300 years, between 900 and 1200, the Khmer Empire {{produced}} {{some of the}} world's most magnificent architectural masterpieces in the area known as Angkor. Most are concentrated in an area approximately [...] east to west and [...] north to south, although the Angkor Archaeological Park, which administers the area, includes sites {{as far away as}} Kbal Spean, about [...] to the north. Some 72 major temples or other buildings are found within this area, and the remains of several hundred additional minor temple sites are scattered throughout the landscape beyond. Because of the low-density and dispersed nature of the medieval Khmer settlement pattern, Angkor lacks a formal boundary, and its extent is therefore difficult to determine. However, a specific area of at least [...] beyond the major temples is defined by a complex system of infrastructure, including roads and canals that indicate a high degree of connectivity and <b>functional</b> <b>integration</b> with the urban core. In terms of spatial extent (although not in terms of population), this makes it the largest urban agglomeration in recorded history prior to the Industrial Revolution, easily surpassing the nearest claim by the Mayan city of Tikal.

40|$|Generalized tonic-clonic {{seizures}} (GTCS) {{are characterized}} by unresponsiveness and convulsions, which cause complete loss of consciousness. Many recent {{studies have found that}} the ictal alterations in brain activity of the GTCS epilepsy patients are focally involved in some brain regions, including thalamus, upper brainstem, medial prefrontal cortex, posterior midbrain regions, and lateral parietal cortex. Notably, many of these affected brain regions are the same and overlap considerably with the components of the so-called default mode network (DMN). Here, we hypothesize that the brain activity of the DMN of the GTCS epilepsy patients are different from normal controls, even in the resting state. To test this hypothesis, we compared the DMN of the GTCS epilepsy patients and the controls using the resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Thirteen brain areas in the DMN were extracted, and a complete undirected weighted graph was used to model the DMN for each participant. When directly comparing the edges of the graph, we found significant decreased functional connectivities within the DMN of the GTCS epilepsy patients comparing to the controls. As for the nodes of the graph, we found that the degree of some brain areas within the DMN was significantly reduced in the GTCS epilepsy patients, including the anterior medial prefrontal cortex, the bilateral superior frontal cortex, and the posterior cingulate cortex. Then we investigated into possible mechanisms of how GTCS epilepsy could cause the reduction of the <b>functional</b> <b>integrations</b> of DMN.

The neurobiological underpinnings of IGA should be studied {{to unravel the}} potential heterogeneity of IGA. This study investigated the brain functions in IGA patients with resting-state fMRI. Methods Fifteen IGA subjects and fourteen healthy controls participated in this study. Regional homogeneity (ReHo) measures were used to detect the abnormal <b>functional</b> <b>integrations.</b> Results Comparing to the healthy controls, IGA subjects show enhanced ReHo in brainstem, inferior parietal lobule, left posterior cerebellum, and left middle frontal gyrus. All of these regions are thought related with sensory-motor coordination. In addition, IGA subjects show decreased ReHo in temporal, occipital and parietal brain regions. These regions are thought responsible for visual and auditory functions. Conclusions Our results suggest that long-time online game playing enhanced the brain synchronization in sensory-motor coordination related brain regions and decreased the excitability in visual and auditory related brain regions. </p...|$|R
