5000|$|The {{simplest}} {{example of}} an electric quadrupole consists of alternating positive and negative charges, arranged on the corners of a square. The monopole moment (just the total charge) of this arrangement is zero. Similarly, the dipole moment is zero, regardless of the coordinate origin that has been chosen. But the quadrupole moment of the arrangement in the diagram cannot be reduced to zero, regardless of where we place the coordinate origin. The electric potential of an electric charge quadrupole is given by where [...] is the electric permittivity, and [...] <b>follows</b> <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> above.|$|E

Moreover, in the classical {{definition of}} Jackson {{the equivalent of the}} N-particle quantum mechanical expectation value is an integral over a one-particle charge distribution. Remember {{that in the case of}} a one-particle quantum mechanical system the expectation value is nothing but an integral over the charge distribution (modulus of wavefunction squared), so that the definition of this article is a quantum mechanical N-particle generalization of Jackson's definition.|$|E

5000|$|A model-driven {{application}} is a software application that the functions or behaviors are based on, or in control of, some evolutionary applied {{models of the}} target things to the application. The applied models are served {{as a part of}} the app in which it can be changed at runtime. The target things are what the application deals with, such as the objects and affairs in business for a business application. <b>Follows</b> <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> of application in TOGAF, a model-driven business application could be described as an IT system that supports business functions and services running on the models of the (things in) business. Gartner Group  defined the model-driven packaged applications as [...] "enterprise applications that have explicit metadata-driven models of the supported processes, data and relationships, and that generate runtime components through metadata models, either dynamically interpreted or compiled, rather than hardcoded." [...] Business process management is the significant practice of model-driven application architectural style. A BPM system is model-driven if the functions are operating on business process models which are built and changed at the application time but not the design or implementation time; the biggest advantage is that it can deal with the continuous changing business process directly without modifying the software. Model-driven application architecture is one of few technology trends to driven the next generation of application modernization, that claimed by some industrial researchers in 2012. Note that it should be distinguished from the Model-Driven Architecture (MDA); the latter is a software design approach for the development of software systems and generally does not specify a specific system style or the runtime configuration.|$|E
