25|$|Macropedius wrote several {{textbook}}s. The {{most famous}} of all was Epistolica, a textbook {{on the art of}} writing letters. It was published {{for the first time in}} Antwerp in 1543. It was also printed as Methodus de Conscribendis Epistolis in Basel, Cologne, Dilligen, Frankfurt am Main, 's-Hertogenbosch, and Leyde. The book was published in London in 1576, followed by ten reprints; the last one dates from 1649. Even William Shakespeare may <b>have</b> <b>known</b> <b>it</b> due to the reprint of the work by his friend, fellow townsman and printer, Richard Field.

Piet Levy from USA Today newspaper named the show [...] "the evening's highlight". During the show, many fans held up Bic lighters, and lit their cell phones and cameras. Leah Greenblatt from Entertainment Weekly called the show as [...] "a set heavy on hard-spat hits". Gil Kaufman from MTV News thought of Mars' chorus being [...] "a feathery pop sheen to the harder-edge". Mars also brought a silver guitar that he occasionally played.

500|$|Twilight was in {{development}} for approximately {{three years at}} Paramount Pictures's MTV Films, during which time a screen adaptation differing significantly from the novel was written. For example, the script transformed Bella into a star athlete. Stephenie Meyer stated {{that there was some}} debate in allowing the movie to be made because of the negative or positive outcome of the movie compared to the book, '"They could have put that [...] movie out, called it something else, and no one would <b>have</b> <b>known</b> <b>it</b> was Twilight!" [...] The idea of seeing a scene converted correctly, specifically the meadow scene, convinced Meyer to sell the rights. In seeing the script, she was frightened that she had made the wrong decision. When Summit Entertainment reinvented itself as a full-service studio in April 2007, it successfully acquired the rights to the novel. Erik Feig, President of Production at Summit Entertainment, guaranteed a close adaptation to the book. The company perceived the film as an opportunity to launch a franchise based on the success of Meyer's book and its sequels. Meyer felt that Summit was open to letting her {{be a part of the}} film. Catherine Hardwicke was hired to direct the film, and soon afterward, Melissa Rosenberg was selected to be the film's structural base as the writer of the film.|$|E

[...] At one point during the show, he told them, [...] "Everybody here tonight, I just wanna say thank you for sticking by me and not giving up on me."

2500|$|Although {{there is}} no direct {{literary}} source for the induction, the tale of a tinker being duped into believing he is a lord is one found in many literary traditions.
