5|$|A {{total of}} 131 athletes won medals at the 1960 Games. The Soviet Union {{was awarded the}} most medals, with its athletes winning seven gold medals, five silver, and nine bronze, {{for a total of}} 21 medals overall. The United States placed second in medal count, with a total of 10 medals, and Germany placed third, with eight medals overall. Of the 30 NOCs {{competing}} in the 1960 Games, 14 won at least one medal, with 10 of these winning at least one gold medal. There was a bronze medal awarded to Theron Bailie, USA, {{for the development of the}} <b>digital</b> <b>clock</b> used for the first time in downhill skiing.|$|E
5|$|In games {{subject to}} time control, a chess clock is used, {{consisting}} of two adjacent clocks and buttons to stop one clock while starting the other, such that the two component clocks never run simultaneously. The clock can be analog or digital though a <b>digital</b> <b>clock</b> is highly preferred under both USCF and FIDE rulesets. This is since most tournaments now include either a time delay (a countdown to when a clock starts again) or add (extra time being added prior or after the move) to their time controls. Before {{the start of the}} game, either the arbiter decides, or whomever is playing Black, where the chess clock is placed.|$|E

5000|$|In 1961, <b>digital</b> <b>clocks</b> were {{installed}} {{at the height of}} 65 metres from the ground, which were donated by Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., a Japanese electronics manufacturer. This installation was suggested by the founder of the company Konosuke Matsushita, who thought these <b>digital</b> <b>clocks</b> would draw a great attention to the Tower. These <b>digital</b> <b>clocks,</b> installed at four sides of the Tower, have been repaired two times: in 1998 and 2006. The interior and exterior of the Sapporo TV Tower were renovated in 2002, and the color of walls at the second and third floors were changed from pale green to dark green. In the second repair of the <b>digital</b> <b>clocks</b> in 2006, the light-emitting diode was adopted, and the advertisement right below the clocks was changed from the [...] "National" [...] to [...] "Panasonic".|$|R
5|$|Those Mesoamerican {{countries}} that once formed {{part of the}} Maya civilization – Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador – all organized festivities to commemorate the end of b'ak'tun 13 at the largest Maya sites. On 21 December 2011, the Maya town of Tapachula in Chiapas activated an eight-foot <b>digital</b> <b>clock</b> counting down the days {{until the end of}} b'ak'tun 13. On 21 December 2012, major events took place at Chichén Itzá in Mexico and Tikal in Guatemala. In El Salvador, the largest event was held at Tazumal, and in Honduras, at Copán. In all of these archaeological sites, Maya rituals were held at dawn led by shamans and Maya priests.|$|E
5|$|A major concept used in {{the series}} {{was the idea of}} a running clock. This {{initially}} came from Joel Surnow, who wanted the audience to always know what time it was in the show's fictional timeline. This was done by an on-screen <b>digital</b> <b>clock</b> that appears before and after commercial breaks, and a smaller clock also appears at other points in the narrative. The time shown is the in-universe time of the story. When the running clock is shown full screen, an alternating pulsating beeping noise (like the kind seen on a time bomb) for each second can usually be heard. On rare occasions, a silent clock is used. This usually follows the death of a major character or an otherwise dramatic event.|$|E

25|$|By {{the late}} 1950s, changes {{were taking place}} at the BBC. With the {{introduction}} of their new logo of square boxes with slanted letters {{a number of things}} changed. Firstly the clock design was changed c.1958 to two circles, one inside the other, containing the clock and the new logo. The large second hand was retained, reaching the larger of the two circles. The clock element itself was made larger and more consipcous. This was changed again on 8 October 1960 to a <b>digital</b> <b>clock,</b> featuring the BBC logo above a line, with the 'TV' box and time below. Having a <b>digital</b> <b>clock</b> was very unusual in television as nearly all station clocks were analogue; the only notable exception to the rule was ATV's clock.|$|E

Having finally revealed the story of Caroline's father to her, Daisy dies as Hurricane Katrina approaches.|$|E
25|$|The Map logo {{itself was}} {{introduced}} c.1962 and featured the BBC logo {{in the middle}} of a circle containing a segmented map of the regions. This logo also had a variant of a plain circle with BBC logo, used for Breaking News. Regional variations were changed from this point to a similar design to that of the <b>digital</b> <b>clock.</b> The design featured the 'BBC TV' logo above a line with the region name below.|$|E

This was fully imported from Japan. The hatchbacks were {{released to the}} market in August 1982. The facelift model launched in Australia during November 1983. Notably, configurations of the R30 sold in Australia and New Zealand were missing the traditional hotplate tail lights, instead opting for more conventional styling.|$|E
25|$|The GT-R had a {{significantly}} larger intercooler, larger brakes, and aluminium front guards and bonnet. Other distinguishing features include flared front and rear wheel arches. More supportive seats were fitted, and the turbo boost gauge and <b>digital</b> <b>clock</b> were removed from inside the instrument cluster. The clock was replaced with a torque meter that indicated how much torque was being delivered to the front wheels (0%–50%). Oil temp, voltage, and turbo boost gauges were fitted just above the climate control.|$|E

25|$|A {{liquid-crystal display}} (LCD) is a flat-panel display or other {{electronically}} modulated optical device {{that uses the}} light-modulating properties of liquid crystals. Liquid crystals do not emit light directly, instead using a backlight or reflector to produce images in colour or monochrome. LCDs are available to display arbitrary images (as in a general-purpose computer display) or fixed images with low information content, which can be displayed or hidden, such as preset words, digits, and 7-segment displays, as in a <b>digital</b> <b>clock.</b> They use the same basic technology, except that arbitrary images {{are made up of}} a large number of small pixels, while other displays have larger elements.|$|E
25|$|Despite the Rally's {{outstanding}} performance {{on both the}} street and in the market, it was affected {{by a series of}} unexpected problems. Internally, VAM suffered problems with several customer's confusing the Rally SST and the three-door Lerma models and became undecided on which car to buy. Also, the Lerma's high price and relatively plain looks for a high-end luxury model (intended to become VAM's new flagship since the departure of the Matador-based Classic line) meant poor sales that ended way below VAM's expectations for the year. In terms of luxury, VAM gave priority to the Lerma and the high trim American (Concord) models over the Rally line. The Lerma for 1982 was changed from being a single version to two different versions to create a price difference. The final flagship of the company was available as the semi-equipped Lerma 610 and the fully equipped Lerma 620, both in three and five doors. Externally, a set of misguided moves from the Mexican government took their toll on the whole auto industry. First, the legal exemption of up to 500 automobile engines without emission certification was revoked, affecting directly the high performance 4.6/X engine of the Rally GT models. This was followed by a decree banning the importation of automotive luxury accessories affected the whole auto industry. The only way for the auto makers to keep on offering those accessories was to have them either produced or sourced locally, some found a replacement while others did not. In the VAM Rally's case, the list of accessories that were lost included the bullet-shaped sports remote mirrors, power door locks, power windows, electric trunk release, rear spoiler, analog tachometer, rear defroster, the Quartz <b>digital</b> <b>clock,</b> and the center console with armrest and rear ashtray.|$|E
50|$|Most <b>digital</b> <b>clocks</b> use {{electronic}} {{mechanisms and}} LCD, LED, or VFD displays; many other display technologies {{are used as}} well (cathode ray tubes, nixie tubes, etc.). After a reset, battery change or power failure, these clocks without a backup battery or capacitor either start counting from 12:00, or stay at 12:00, often with blinking digits indicating that the time needs to be set. Some newer clocks will reset themselves based on radio or Internet time servers that are tuned to national atomic clocks. Since the advent of <b>digital</b> <b>clocks</b> in the 1960s, the use of analog clocks has declined significantly.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Digital</b> <b>clocks</b> {{typically}} use the 50 or 60 hertz oscillation of AC {{power or}} a 32,768 hertz crystal oscillator as in a quartz clock to keep time. Most <b>digital</b> <b>clocks</b> display {{the hour of}} the day in 24-hour format; in the United States and a few other countries, a more commonly used hour sequence option is 12-hour format (with some indication of AM or PM). Some timepieces, such as many digital watches, can be switched between 12-hour and 24-hour modes. Emulations of analog-style faces often use an LCD screen, and these are also sometimes described as [...] "digital".|$|R

500|$|One log {{shows that}} Bamber rang Chelmsford police station—rather than the {{emergency}} number (999)—and spoke to PC Michael West {{in the information}} room. As a result West began an [...] "event log". This states that Bamber's call came in at 3.36am on 7 August 1985. The timing is important; Bamber maintains that he telephoned 10 minutes after his father phoned him. But at trial it was accepted that West had misread a <b>digital</b> <b>clock,</b> and that the call had probably come in just before 3:26am, because that was when West asked a civilian dispatcher, Malcolm Bonnett, to send a car to the scene. The car, Charlie Alpha 5, was dispatched at 3:35 am. The event log noted a call from: ...|$|E
500|$|Although not {{the first}} to do so, 24 embraced the concept of real time. This idea started when {{producer}} Joel Surnow thought of the idea of doing [...] "24 episodes in a season, with each episode lasting an hour". They decided that the idea of real time had to make the show a [...] "race against the clock". Each episode takes place over the course of one hour, with time continuing to elapse during the commercial breaks. The exact time is denoted by the <b>digital</b> <b>clock</b> display {{at the beginning and end}} of each segment. The protocol is that mundane events, such as travel, sometimes occur during commercial breaks and thus these events are largely unseen. The story time correlates with elapsed viewing time if episodes are broadcast with commercial breaks of set duration inserted at the points prescribed by the episode. In line with the depiction of events in real time, 24 does not use slow motion techniques. The series also does not use flashbacks, except once during the first-season finale. Watched continuously without advertisements, each season would run approximately 17 hours. As a result of the timing nature of the series, a number of visual cues were projected onto the screen.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Does {{the naming}} of clocks always require {{conceptual}} preparation? To examine this question, speakers were presented with analog and <b>digital</b> <b>clocks</b> {{that had to be}} named in Dutch using either a relative (e. g., “quarter to four”) or an absolute (e. g., “three forty-five”) clock time expression format. Naming latencies showed evidence of conceptual preparation when speakers produced relative time expressions to analog and <b>digital</b> <b>clocks,</b> but not when they used absolute time expressions. These findings indicate that conceptual mediation is not always mandatory for telling time, but instead depends on clock time expression format, supporting a multiple-route account of Dutch clock time naming...|$|R
