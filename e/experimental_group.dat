The <b>experimental</b> <b>group</b> (the vitamin-restricted foxes) developed a fine, sparse gray coat that resembled the fashionable fur of the silver fox. Morgan found that the foxes with normal intake of B vitamins had shiny black fur. After the experiments, a fur stole was made out of fur from both the experimental and control groups. Morgan wore the stole on at least two important occasions – her presentation of the study data in 1939 and her Garvan Medal award ceremony ten years later.|$|E
5|$|Polistes exclamans have comparably smaller nests and colonies {{compared}} to certain other eusocial wasps species. Thus, {{it is common}} for the nest to be destroyed, for the queen to die prior {{to the end of the}} season, or for the nest to fail through other means, such as predation, parasitisation, or worker mortality, leading workers to help rear broods that are less related to them than are their sister wasps. Due to this, it would be advantageous for there to be wasps that remain casteless till adulthood, allowing female wasps’ reproductive capabilities to be plastic. It has thus been predicted that Polistes exclamans worker wasps would act as workers if a brood were present and would begin to develop gyne characteristics if a brood was not present, exhibiting the aforementioned adaptive plasticity. Experimentally, this has been found to be true. Solis and Strassmann conducted a study in which an <b>experimental</b> <b>group</b> had the eggs and larvae removed. In the <b>experimental</b> <b>group,</b> the wasps began to behave like future queens and even developed the characteristic layer of fat common to queens. In the control group, the wasps continued to behave as workers. This is indicative that the presence of the brood affects caste differentiation and that Polistes exclamans female workers exhibits adaptive reproductive plasticity.|$|E
5|$|Several {{recent studies}} attempt {{to examine the}} effects of chronic low-dose {{manganese}} overexposure on child development. The earliest study was conducted in the Chinese province of Shanxi. Drinking water there had been contaminated through improper sewage irrigation and contained 240–350µg Mn/L. Although Mn concentrations at or below 300µg Mn/L were considered safe at the time of the study by the US EPA and 400µg Mn/L by the World Health Organization, the 92 children sampled (between 11 and 13 years of age) from this province displayed lower performance on tests of manual dexterity and rapidity, short-term memory, and visual identification, compared to children from an uncontaminated area. More recently, a study of 10-year-old children in Bangladesh showed a relationship between Mn concentration in well water and diminished IQ scores. A third study conducted in Quebec examined school children between the ages of 6 and 15 living in homes that received water from a well containing 610µg Mn/L; controls lived in homes that received water from a 160µg Mn/L well. Children in the <b>experimental</b> <b>group</b> showed increased hyperactive and oppositional behavior.|$|E

25|$|The {{learning}} curve for cued recall increases systematically {{with the number}} of trials completed. This result has caused a debate about whether or not learning is all-or-none. One theory is that learning is incremental and that the recall of each word pair is strengthened with repetition. Another theory suggests that learning is all-or-none, that is one learns the word pair in a single trial and memory performance is due to the average learned pairs, some of which are learned on earlier trials and some on later trials. To examine the validity of these theories researchers have performed memory experiments. In one experiment published in 1959, experimental psychologist Irvin Rock and colleague Walter Heimer of the University of Illinois had both a control group and an <b>experimental</b> <b>group</b> learn pairs of words. The control group studied word pairs that were repeated until the participants learned all the word pairs. In the <b>experimental</b> <b>group,</b> the learned pairs remained in the list while unlearned pairs were substituted with recombinations of previous words. Rock believed that associations between two items would be strengthened if learning were incremental even when pairs are not correctly recalled. His hypothesis was that the control group would have a higher correct recall probability than the <b>experimental</b> <b>group.</b> He thought that repetition would increase the strength of the word pair until the strength reaches a threshold needed to produce an overt response. If learning were all or none, then the control group and the <b>experimental</b> <b>group</b> should learn the word pairs at the same rate. Rock found experimentally there was little difference in learning rates between the two groups. However, Rock's work did not settle the controversy because in his experiment he rearranged replaced word pairs that could be either easier or harder to learn than the original words in the word- digit pair. In further experiments that addressed the question, there were mixed results. The incremental learning hypothesis is supported by the notion that awhile after Ai-Bi pairs are learned, the recall time to recall Bi decreases with continued learning trails.|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of DPP on fertility and development of female reproductive system in Balb/C mice. Methods: Ten groups were assigned to 2 control and 8 <b>experimental</b> <b>groups.</b> On the control groups 1 and 2 no treatment was conducted, but in the control group 2, after 10 days the mice were mated. In <b>experimental</b> <b>groups</b> 1 and 2, the animals received DPP (100 and 200 mg/kg, respectively) byoral administration for 10 days. In <b>experimental</b> <b>groups</b> 3 and 4 percentage of mating was evaluatedafter 10 days. <b>Experimental</b> <b>groups</b> 5 and 6 received DPP during gestation. Embryos were removedto evaluate ovaries histology. For <b>experimental</b> <b>groups</b> 7 and 8, DPP was administered until 21 thday after birth. The offspring ovaries were removed to evaluate histological parameters. The levelsof sexual hormones were also measured. Results: Several parameters of ovaries in offspring, including mass index, diameter of ovaries,number of primary and secondary graph follicles and corpora luteal, percentage of mating, bodymass index and Crown rump (CR) of embryos, diameter of ovary, basic sexual cell number inembryos, and mass index increased in <b>experimental</b> <b>groups</b> in comparison to the controls. However, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in the experimentalgroups were not significantly different from those in control groups (P > 0. 05), while estrogen andprogesterone considerably increased in <b>experimental</b> <b>groups</b> (P < 0. 05). Conclusion: Results of our investigation propose that DPP can create an appropriate situationfor oogenesis and maintain efficient fertility in female mice which it may be considered as usefulnutraceuticals for potentiation of fertility in future human studies...|$|R
