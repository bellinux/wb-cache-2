50|$|Classical human rights, such as {{the right}} to life or freedom of expression, are {{formulated}} or understood as prohibitions <b>for</b> the <b>State</b> <b>to</b> act {{in a way that would}} violate these rights. Thus, they would imply an obligation <b>for</b> the <b>State</b> not <b>to</b> kill, or an obligation <b>for</b> the <b>State</b> not <b>to</b> impose press censorship. Modern or social rights, on the other hand, imply an obligation <b>for</b> the <b>State</b> <b>to</b> become active, such as to secure individuals' rights to education or employment by building schools and maintaining a healthy economy. Such social rights are generally more difficult to enforce.|$|R

5|$|Throughout the 1990s, {{progress}} accelerated {{towards a}} {{comprehensive test ban}} treaty (CTBT). Following a series of international meetings on the subject, the UN General Assembly approved resolution 50/64, which appealed <b>for</b> <b>states</b> <b>to</b> follow the PTBT and called for conclusion of the CTBT talks. In September 1996, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty was signed and superseded the PTBT, though the PTBT is still in effect for states not party to the CTBT. The CTBT has yet to enter into force, as 8 required states have not ratified the treaty, including the US and China. France, Russia, and the UK have ratified the CTBT. The technology for detecting underground tests has significantly improved since the 1950s and 1960s, with monitors detecting tests down to 1 kiloton {{with a high degree of}} confidence.|$|E

25|$|A third {{voluntary}} hypothesis, particularly {{common with}} some explanations of early state development, is that long distance trade networks created an impetus <b>for</b> <b>states</b> <b>to</b> develop at key locations: such as ports or oases.

25|$|According to Tilly's argument, state {{capacity}} evolves as {{response to}} the emergence of war.

25|$|Reclaimed {{water is}} not {{regulated}} by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), but the EPA has developed water reuse guidelines that were most recently updated in 2012. The EPA Guidelines for Water Reuse represents the international standard for best practices in water reuse. The document was developed under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement between the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and the global consultancy CDM Smith. The Guidelines provide a framework <b>for</b> <b>states</b> <b>to</b> develop regulations that incorporate the best practices and address local requirements.|$|E
25|$|Unger's work {{in office}} {{was an attempt}} to enact his program. Seeing the future in small {{enterprises}} and advocating a rotating capital fund that would function like a government run venture capital fund, he pushed for a rapid expansion of credit to smaller producers and a decentralized network of technical support centers that would help broaden the middle class from below. He further called for political solutions that would broaden access to production forces such as information technology, and <b>for</b> <b>states</b> <b>to</b> focus on equipping and monitoring civil society rather than trying to provide social services.|$|E
25|$|According to this criticism, {{the electoral}} college reduces {{elections}} to a mere count of electors for a particular state, and, as a result, it obscures any voting problems within a particular state. For example, if a particular state blocks some groups from voting, perhaps by voter suppression methods such as imposing reading tests, poll taxes, registration requirements, or legally disfranchising specific minority groups, then voting inside that state would be reduced, but as the state's electoral count would be the same, disenfranchisement {{has no effect on}} the overall electoral tally. Critics contend that such disenfranchisement is partially obscured by the Electoral College. A related argument is the Electoral College may have a dampening effect on voter turnout: there is no incentive <b>for</b> <b>states</b> <b>to</b> reach out to more of its citizens to include them in elections because the state's electoral count remains fixed in any event. According to this view, if elections were by popular vote, then states would be motivated to include more citizens in elections since the state would then have more political clout nationally. Critics contend {{the electoral college}} system insulates states from negative publicity as well as possible federal penalties for disenfranching subgroups of citizens.|$|E

25|$|According to this argument, {{the fact}} the Electoral College {{is made up of}} real people instead of mere numbers allows for human {{judgment}} and flexibility to make a decision, if it happens that a candidate dies or becomes legally disabled {{around the time of the}} election. Advocates of the current system argue that human electors would be in a better position to choose a suitable replacement than the general voting public. According to this view, electors could act decisively during the critical time interval between when ballot choices become fixed in state ballots until mid-December when the electors formally cast their ballots. In the election of 1872, losing Liberal Republican candidate Horace Greeley died during this time interval, which resulted in disarray for the Democratic Party, who also supported Greeley, but the Greeley electors were able to split their votes for different alternate candidates. A situation in which the winning candidate died has never happened. In the election of 1912, Vice President Sherman died shortly before the election when it was too late <b>for</b> <b>states</b> <b>to</b> remove his name from their ballots; accordingly, Sherman was listed posthumously, but the eight electoral votes that Sherman would have received were cast instead for Nicholas Murray Butler.|$|E
25|$|In this schema, {{three main}} {{prerequisites}} are posited for globalization to occur. The {{first is the}} idea of Eastern Origins, which shows how Western states have adapted and implemented learned principles from the East. Without the traditional ideas from the East, Western globalization would not have emerged the way it did. The second is distance. The interactions amongst states were not on a global scale and most often were confined to Asia, North Africa, the Middle East, and certain parts of Europe. With early globalization, it was difficult <b>for</b> <b>states</b> <b>to</b> interact with others that were not within close proximity. Eventually, technological advances allowed states to learn of others' existence and another phase of globalization was able to occur. The third has to do with interdependency, stability, and regularity. If a state is not dependent on another, then there is no way for either state to be mutually affected by the other. This is one of the driving forces behind global connections and trade; without either, globalization would not have emerged the way it did and states would still be dependent on their own production and resources to function. This is one of the arguments surrounding the idea of early globalization. It is argued that archaic globalization did not function in a similar manner to modern globalization because states were not as interdependent on others as they are today.|$|E
25|$|Since {{medieval times}} the episcopal see of Rome has been {{recognized}} as a sovereign entity. Earlier, there were papal representatives (apocrisiarii) to the Emperors of Constantinople, beginning in 453, {{but they were not}} thought of as ambassadors. In the eleventh century the sending of papal representatives to princes, on a temporary or permanent mission, became frequent. In the fifteenth century it became customary <b>for</b> <b>states</b> <b>to</b> accredit permanent resident ambassadors to the Pope in Rome. The first permanent papal nunciature was established in 1500 in Venice. Their number grew {{in the course of the}} sixteenth century to thirteen, while internuncios (representatives of second rank) were sent to less-powerful states. After enjoying a brilliant period in the first half of the seventeenth century, papal diplomacy declined after the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, being assailed especially by royalists and Gallicans, and the number of functioning nuncios was reduced to two in the time of Napoleon, although in the same period, in 1805, Prussia became the first Protestant state to send an ambassador to Rome. There was a revival after the Congress of Vienna in 1815, which, while laying down that, in general, the order of precedence between ambassadors would be determined by the date of their arrival, allowed special precedence to be given to the nuncio, by which he would always be the dean of the diplomatic corps.|$|E

500|$|Seven {{years after}} the Santosky decision, the United States Supreme Court held in Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins that Santosky's higher burden of proof is an {{exception}} to the [...] "conventional rules of civil litigation [...] that parties to civil litigation need only prove their case by a preponderance of the evidence." [...] The Court later extended Santoskys finding of governmental interest in [...] "preserving and promoting the welfare of the child" [...] when it held in Reno v. Flores that children with no available guardians may be held in custody pending deportation hearings. In 2000, the right of parents to choose how to raise their child, one of the main constitutional interests at issue in Santosky, was affirmed in Troxel v. Granville when the Court struck down a Washington law that allowed for third parties to petition for visitation rights over parental objections. In his dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens rebutted the assumption of Santosky that interests of the parent and the interests of the child do not diverge, arguing that [...] "the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment leaves room <b>for</b> <b>States</b> <b>to</b> consider the impact on a child of possibly arbitrary parental decisions that neither serve nor are motivated by {{the best interests of the}} child." ...|$|E
