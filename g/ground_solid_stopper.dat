60|$|Great {{difficulties}} beset the Duke of Parma at {{the commencement}} of the siege. Sluys was built upon the only piece of <b>solid</b> <b>ground</b> in the district, and it was surrounded by such a labyrinth of canals, ditches, and swamps, that {{it was said that}} it was almost as difficult to find Sluys as it was to capture it. Consequently, it was impossible to find <b>ground</b> <b>solid</b> enough for a camp to be pitched upon, and the first labour was the erection of wooden huts for the troops upon piles driven into the ground. These huts were protected from the fire of the defenders by bags of earth brought in boats from a long distance. The main point selected for the attack was the western gate; but batteries were also placed to play upon the castle and the bridge of boats connecting it with the town.|$|R
