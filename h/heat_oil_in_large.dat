50|$|A basic cacciatore recipe usually {{begins with}} a couple of tablespoons of olive <b>oil</b> <b>heated</b> <b>in</b> a <b>large</b> frying pan. Chicken parts, dusted with salt and pepper, are seared <b>in</b> the <b>oil</b> for three to four minutes on each side. The chicken is removed from the pan, and most of the fat poured off. The {{remaining}} fat is used to fry the onions, peppers or other vegetables for several minutes. A small can of peeled tomatoes (drained of liquid and chopped coarsely) is typically added to the pan along with rosemary and a half cup of dry red wine. Bay leaf may be used, along with chopped carrot to give extra sweetness. The seared chicken parts are returned to the pan which is then covered. The dish is done after about an hour at a very low simmer. Cacciatore is often served with a rustic bread or pasta on the side.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{utilizes}} calculated {{historical volatility}} and GARCH models {{to compare the}} historical price volatility behavior of crude oil, motor gasoline and <b>heating</b> <b>oil</b> <b>in</b> U.

This study has three major conclusions. First, there was an increase in volatility {{as a result of a}} structural shift to higher crude oil prices after April 1999. Second, volatility shocks from current news are not important since GARCH effects dominate ARCH effects in the variance equation. Third, persistence of volatility in all commodity markets is quite transitory, with half-lives normally being a few weeks.
