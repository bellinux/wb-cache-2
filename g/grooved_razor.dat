40|$|ConferÃªncia internacional realizada em Aveiro de 21 - 25 de junho de 2014 Ria de Aveiro is {{a popular}} place where {{professionals}} and the population who lives nearby go to collect bivalves (the population does that as an economic complement). The species collected are: cockle (Cerastoderma edule), <b>grooved</b> <b>razor</b> shell (Solen marginatus), pullet carpet shell (Venerupis senegalensis) and grooved carpet shell (Ruditapes decussata). This work study {{is based on the}} observation which has been carried out for the last 10 years in the area and concludes that: The legislation applied to this activity was and is thought {{in order to keep the}} sustainability of Ria de Aveiro. In this context, the majority of the capture of these bivalves is being performed by hand or with small tools, according to the law. Although the impact is thought to be almost none (both in the environment and with the species), compared to some other capture techniques, the reality shows that these bivalves are being collected far below the legal size by adulterating the tools used in the process. Also, some legal tools are not the best to use in the collection of bivalves because they cause damage to the intertidal bottom of Ria de Aveiro. Both situations endanger the sustainability of the biodiversity of bivalves in the area...|$|E
