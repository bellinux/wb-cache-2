5|$|Colonels wore three gold {{stars of}} the same size on their collar; the same as generals, but without the wreath. While {{lieutenant}} colonels wore two stars on their collars, majors wore one star, which was placed {{in the middle of the}} collar. Captains had three gold <b>horizontal</b> <b>bars,</b> first lieutenants wore two bars, and second lieutenants wore one bar. However, the Confederate Congress often created new commissions, and did not always standardize rank insignia immediately.|$|E
5|$|For {{the period}} of 1894 to 1900, the club did not win the league championship, {{finishing}} as high as second several times, and fifth (last) once. For the 1896–97 season, the Ottawa club unveiled the first use of the 'barber-pole' style sweaters of <b>horizontal</b> <b>bars</b> of black, red and white. This basic style would {{be used by the}} club until 1954 except for the 1900 and 1901 seasons, when the team used a plain sweater with only the letter 'O' on the front, identical in design to the sweaters of the Ottawa Football Club, also an OAAA affiliate.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} period, {{different}} helms {{began to be}} used for different ranks: sovereigns' and knights' helms faced forwards (affronté), whereas those of peers and gentlemen faced to the right (dexter). In the medieval period crests would always have faced {{the same way as the}} helm, but as a result of these rules, the directions of the crest and the helm might be at variance: a knight whose crest was a lion statant, would have the lion depicted as looking over the side of the helm, rather than towards the viewer. Torses also suffered artistically, being treated not as silken circlets, but as <b>horizontal</b> <b>bars.</b>|$|E
50|$|When using grab bars as {{safety devices}} {{in order to}} prevent falls, your best choice would be a <b>horizontal</b> <b>bar.</b> Scientific {{research}} has found that gripping strength is far greater using a <b>horizontal</b> <b>bar</b> than a vertical bar in a fall situation. This makes <b>horizontal</b> grab <b>bars</b> the safest choice.|$|R
50|$|Going {{into the}} 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, Hambüchen was {{considered}} the favourite for the <b>horizontal</b> <b>bar</b> title and a strong contender for an All Around medal. He qualified to 4 individual finals including 2nd into the All Around and was the top qualifier for the <b>horizontal</b> <b>bar</b> final. The German team placed 4th in the Team final, with Hambüchen contributing scored on 5 events. However in the All Around final, Hambüchen had a fall on <b>horizontal</b> <b>bar</b> and placed in 7th. He then placed 4th in the floor final and the parallel bars final. He then won his first Olympic Medal with a bronze on <b>horizontal</b> <b>bar.</b>|$|R

25|$|In 2005, the CR-V {{received}} a mid-cycle refresh. The 2005 CR-V was now equipped with 16inch wheels, the earlier models had 15inch wheels. Visual changes included new taillights and headlights with clear indicators. The new headlights now have two separate H1 bulbs for low beams and high beams, the previous setup used H4 single bulb for both {{low and high}} beams. The taillights now used clear lenses instead of amber for the turning indicators. The grille was also changed; it had two <b>horizontal</b> <b>bars</b> instead of one. The front bumper design was slightly changed, it now has round fog lights compared to the previous rectangle fog lights {{and in addition to}} the lower grill there are two <b>horizontal</b> <b>bars</b> instead of one. The rear bumper reflectors were longer and narrower.|$|E
25|$|Grated iron {{doors were}} found in England, but were {{constructed}} using a different method. For the English-style gate, the vertical bars all passed {{in front of the}} <b>horizontal</b> <b>bars,</b> and were riveted or fixed in place; the spaces were infilled with oak, making the gate solid. One notable exception, however, is constructed using the Scottish method: a yett from Streatlam Castle, now held at Bowes Museum. Streatlam was rebuilt by Sir George Bowes following damage in the 16th century; the Bowes family had connections in Scotland, which may have inspired the yett construction.|$|E
25|$|Like people, fancy mice {{can become}} obese if they overeat {{and do not}} get enough {{physical}} activity. This can lead to them developing life-threatening cardiovascular disorders and diabetes as well as arthritis. Activity aids such as tubes and wheels are great for ensuring mice get enough exercise, as well as mental stimulation. Mice also love to climb, and a wire cage with <b>horizontal</b> <b>bars</b> is perfect for this. A mouse set loose for exercise should be carefully observed, as they tend to scurry into a hiding spot and {{can be difficult to}} retrieve.|$|E
50|$|Manteuffel was {{a member}} of the German team that won two gold medals by placing first in both of the team events, the {{parallel}} <b>bars</b> and the <b>horizontal</b> <b>bar.</b> He also competed in the parallel <b>bars,</b> <b>horizontal</b> <b>bar,</b> vault, and pommel horse individual events, though without success.|$|R
50|$|Hillmar won two {{gold medals}} {{as a member}} of the German team that won both of the team events, the {{parallel}} <b>bars</b> and the <b>horizontal</b> <b>bar.</b> He had less success in the individual events, contesting the parallel <b>bars,</b> <b>horizontal</b> <b>bar,</b> vault, and pommel horse without earning any medals.|$|R
50|$|Flatow {{competed in}} the {{parallel}} <b>bars,</b> <b>horizontal</b> <b>bar,</b> vault, pommel horse, and rings individual events. He won no medals, unlike his cousin and teammate Alfred Flatow. However, both {{were members of the}} German team that {{competed in the}} two team events, for parallel <b>bars</b> and the <b>horizontal</b> <b>bar.</b> As Germany won both those events (the <b>horizontal</b> <b>bar</b> unchallenged), Gustav earned two gold medals. He also competed at the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris, but without winning medals. He retired from gymnastics to manage his textile company, which he founded in 1899.|$|R
25|$|The {{official}} flag is 7x5 feet in {{dimension and}} includes three <b>horizontal</b> <b>bars</b> of equal height. The bottom bar is red and symbolizes First and Second Degree members, {{the foundation of}} the fraternity. The middle bar is silver for Third and Fourth Degree members, indicative of the field of fraternal service. The Greek letters ΦΣΚ are located in the center of this bar. The top bar, also red, commemorates Fifth and Sixth Degree members, indicative of Grand Chapter recognition. The silver and red tumbling T's logo inscribed in a triangle of silver is located at the left end of the upper bar.|$|E
25|$|The 1966 model's frontal {{appearance}} was mildly altered with an eggcrate grille insert {{to replace the}} previous <b>horizontal</b> <b>bars,</b> and the coupe lost its roof-mounted extractor vents, which had proven inefficient. Corvettes also received an emblem {{in the corner of}} the hood for 1966. Head rests were a new option, one of the rarest options was the Red/Red Automatic option with power windows and air conditioning from factory which records show production numbered only 7 convertibles and 33 coupes. This relative lack of change reflected plans to bring out an all-new Corvette for 1967. It certainly did not reflect a fall-off in the car's popularity, however. In fact, 1966 would prove another record-busting year, with volume rising to 27,720 units, up some 4,200 over 1965s sales.|$|E
25|$|On {{the uneven}} bars, the gymnast {{performs}} a timed routine on two parallel <b>horizontal</b> <b>bars</b> set at different heights. These bars {{are made of}} fiberglass covered in wood laminate, {{to prevent them from}} breaking. In the past, bars were made of wood, but the bars were prone to breaking, providing an incentive to switch to newer technologies. The width and height of the bars may be adjusted to the size needed by individual gymnasts. In the past, the uneven parallel bars were closer together. The bars have been moved increasingly further apart, allowing gymnasts to perform swinging, circling, transitional, and release moves that may pass over, under, and between the two bars. At the Elite level, movements must pass through the handstand. Gymnasts often mount the uneven bars using a springboard or a small mat. Chalk (MgCO3) and grips (a leather strip with holes for fingers to protect hands and improve performance) may be used by gymnasts performing this event. The chalk helps take the moisture out of gymnasts' hands to decrease friction and prevent rips (tears to the skin of the hands); dowel grips help gymnasts grip the bar.|$|E
50|$|In 2012, Hambüchen {{once again}} missed the European Championships, {{as he wanted}} to focus on {{preparation}} for the Olympics. At the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, he qualified 3rd into the All Around and 4th into the <b>horizontal</b> <b>bar</b> final. He contributed scores on 5 events to the German Team's 7th place finish. However he had multiple large mistakes in the All Around final, once again including a fall from the <b>horizontal</b> <b>bar,</b> finishing in 15th place. In the <b>horizontal</b> <b>bar</b> final he won his second Olympic medal, winning the silver behind Netherlands' Epke Zonderland.|$|R
40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} {{of science and}} technology, data analysis has become an indispensable part of people’s work and life. <b>Horizontal</b> <b>bar</b> training has multiple categories. It is an emphasis for the re-search of related workers that categories of the training and match should be reduced. The application of data mining methods is discussed based {{on the problem of}} reducing categories of <b>horizontal</b> <b>bar</b> training. The BP neural network is applied to the cluster analysis and the principal component analysis, which are used to evaluate <b>horizontal</b> <b>bar</b> training. Two kinds of data mining methods are analyzed from two aspects, namely the operational convenience of data mining and the rationality of results. It turns out that the principal component analysis is more suitable for data processing of <b>horizontal</b> <b>bar</b> training...|$|R

500|$|The {{body of the}} bowfin is {{elongated}} and cylindrical, {{with the}} sides and back olive to brown in color, often with vertical bars, and dark reticulations, or camouflaged pattern. The dorsal fin has <b>horizontal</b> <b>bars,</b> and the caudal fin has irregular vertical bars. [...] The underside is white or cream, and the paired fins and anal fin are bright green. [...] During larval stage, hatchlings from about [...] total length are black and tadpole-like in appearance. [...] At approximately [...] total length they {{have been described as}} looking like miniature placoderms. [...] They grow quickly, and typically leave the nest within 4 to 6 weeks after hatching. Young males have a black eyespot on the base of the tail (caudal peduncle) that is commonly encircled by an orange-yellowish border while the female's is black, if present at all. [...] It is thought the purpose of the eyespot is to confuse predators, deflecting attacks away from the head of the fish to its tail, which affords the bowfin an opportunity to escape predation. The bowfin is so named for its long, undulating dorsal fin consisting of 145 to 250 rays, and running {{from the middle of the}} back to the base of the tail.|$|E
