40|$|In this study, {{the role}} of {{electrostatic}} fields on aerosol recovery from a system with a large collapsible reservoir (30 L) was investigated. In addition, {{the efficacy of the}} reservoir method for bronchial challenge procedures was assessed in vivo. Aerosol recovery was determined by measuring the fraction of aerosol (0. 05 % 99 mTc-tagged human albumin solution) retrieved from the reservoir. Before aerosol recovery experiments, electrostatic fields in the reservoir were measured. Aerosol recovery varied significantly with wall thickness of the reservoir and presence of an antistatic coating (range 6. 0 - 70. 3 %). A close inverse relationship was found between the mean electrostatic field in the reservoir and aerosol recovery. The nebulized provocative concentration of histamine causing a 20 % fall in forced expiratory volume in one second in asthmatics was found to be approximately half that of a standard method when compared with the reservoir system (mean ratio 2. 24 (95 % confidence interval, 1. 60 - 3. 12)). Recovery from an aerosol delivery system with a relatively large collapsible aerosol reservoir was highly dependent on the electrostatic field in the reservoir. In these systems the use of <b>electrostatic</b> field <b>dissipative</b> material for the reservoir is therefore recommende...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the <b>electrostatic</b> charge <b>dissipative</b> (ESD) {{properties of the}} conducting copolymers of aniline (AN) and 1 -amino- 2 -naphthol- 4 -sulfonic acid (ANSA) blended with low-density polyethylene (LDPE). The copolymers of aniline and ANSA were synthesized under different reaction conditions. Blending of copolymers with LDPE {{was carried out in}} twin screw extruder by melt blending method by loading 0. 5 and 1. 0 [*]wt% of the conducting copolymer in LDPE matrix. The mechanical properties of the blended films depend on the incorporation of copolymer in the LDPE matrix. The morphology of copolymer–LDPE blend was studied by scanning electron microscopy. The conductivity of the blown film of poly(AN-co-ANSA) /LDPE blend was found to be in the range of 10 − 6 – 10 − 11 [*]S/cm, showing its potential use as antistatic bag for the encapsulation of electronic equipments. The static decay time of the film was found to be of the order of 0. 1 – 1. 9 [*]sec on recording the decay time from 5000 to 500 [*]V. Static charge measurements carried out on the films show that no charge is present on the surface. The level of interaction between the copolymers and the matrix polymer was determined by the FTIR spectra, blend morphology, electrical conductivity, and thermal analysis.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the <b>electrostatic</b> charge <b>dissipative</b> performance of conducting polymer nanocomposite impregnated fabric based on polyaniline (PANI) and zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs). Conducting polymer nanocomposites (PANI-ZnO NPs) were synthesized by in situ chemical oxidative polymerization of aniline by using {{sodium dodecyl sulfate}} as surfactant and HCl as dopant. Coating of PANI-ZnO nanocomposites on the cotton fabric was carried out during polymerization. The interaction of ZnO NPs with the PANI matrix was determined by Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR), TGA, XRD, scanning electron Microscopy (SEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and conductivity measurements. The conductivity of PANI-ZnO NP coated fabric {{was found to be}} in the range 10 (- 3) - 10 (- 6) S cm(- 1) depending on the loading concentration of ZnO NPs in the polymer matrix. TEM and HRTEM images showed that the PANI-ZnO nanocomposites had an average diameter of 25 - 30 nm and were nicely dispersed in the polymer matrix. Antistatic performance of the nanocomposite impregnated fabric was investigated by static decay meter and John Chubb instrument. The static decay time of the film was in the range 0. 5 - 3. 4 s on recording the decay time from 5000 V to 500 V. This indicated that the nanocomposite based on PANI-ZnO nanocomposites has great potential to be used as an effective antistatic material...|$|R
40|$|<b>Electrostatic</b> <b>dissipative</b> {{polymers}} {{are used}} {{for a variety of}} functions. Typical methods utilized to transform electrically insulating polymers into either charge dissipative or conductive materials involve incorporating a conductive filler, conductive polymer, oxidizing the surface using plasma, or incorporating surfactants that act as surface wetting agents. Another approach is to synthesize a block copolymer that is expected to result in better electrical properties with minimal impacts to physical, fire, and thermal properties. One such block that can be added into the main chain of polymers is a diol terminated ferrocene oligomer, which is expected to impart <b>electrostatic</b> <b>dissipative</b> properties into the host polymer while concurrently improving the overall fire properties. Previous work with polyurethanes incorporating a ferrocene oligomer into the main chain resulted in much improved fire retardancy. In dealing with <b>electrostatic</b> <b>dissipative</b> materials the important questions are: how easily does the material charge and how quickly can the charge move to ground. One normally describes the materials conductivity, but conductivity only measures the fastest path for an electron not the slowest path. The slowest path is the one of interest, since it is left on the surface and thus can cause discharges. In order to assess ease of charging and decay times corona charge dissipation measurements can accurately assess these properties by introducing a charge {{on the surface of the}} material then measuring the surface voltage and the amount of charge deposited. The charge decay curve then will give an indication of a materials electrostatic dissipation properties. Normally, triboelectric testing can be performed, but results vary. Corona charge dissipation results are more repeatable...|$|E

40|$|The <b>electrostatic</b> charge <b>dissipative</b> (ESD) {{properties}} of conducting self-doped and PTSA-doped copolymers of aniline (AA), o-methoxyaniline (methoxy AA) and o-ethoxyaniline (ethoxy AA) with 3 -aminobenzenesulfonic acid (3 -ABSA) blended with low-density polyethylene (LDPE) were investigated {{in the presence}} of external dopant p-toluenesulfonic acid (PTSA). Blending of copolymers with LDPE was carried out in a twin-screw extruder by melt blending by loading 1. 0 and 2. 0 wt% of conducting copolymer in the LDPE matrix. The conductivity of the blown polymers blended with LDPE was in the range 10 (- 12) - 10 (- 6) Scm(- 1), showing their potential use as antistatic materials for the encapsulation of electronic equipment. The DC conductivity of all self-doped homopolymers and PTSA-doped copolymers was measured in the range 100 - 373 K. The room temperature conductivity (Scm(- 1)) of self-doped copolymers was: poly(3 -ABSA-co-AA), 7. 73 x 10 (- 4); poly(3 -ABSA-co-methoxy AA), 3. 06 x 10 (- 6); poly(3 -ABSA-co-ethoxy AA), 2. 99 x 10 (- 7); and of PTSA-doped copolymers was: poly(3 -ABSA-co-AA), 4. 34 x 10 (- 2); poly(3 -ABSA-co-methoxy AA), 9. 90 x 10 (- 5); poly(3 -ABSA-co-ethoxy AA), 1. 10 x 10 (- 5). The observed conduction mechanism for all the samples could be explained in terms of Mott's variable range hopping model; however, ESD properties are dependent upon the electrical conductivity.

A uniformly dispersed MWCNT/PC composite system was fabricated using solvent casting and a combination of solvent casting and compression molding techniques. The effect of MWCNTs on the failure mechanism of the polymer under tensile loading showed a ductile to brittle transition with increasing amount of carbon nanotubes. ESD studies showed that the composite films of 2 and 5 wt% functionalized-MWCNT/PC with respective charge decay times of 1 and 0. 6 s show promise as <b>electrostatic</b> <b>dissipative</b> materials.

In this article the parametrization for the DPD repulsive parameters aij for the electrolyte components is calculated considering the dependence of the Flory-Huggins ḩi̧ parameter on the concentration {{and the kind of}} electrolyte added, by means of the activity coefficients.

40|$|A wide {{spectrum}} of applications of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in specific engineering applications includes high performance materials in space applications, automotive applications, electronic devices, electromagnetic shielding (EMI) and <b>electrostatic</b> <b>dissipative</b> (ESD) materials. High L/D ratio and flexibility along with attractive forces between multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) surfaces manifest in highly ‘agglomerated’ structure of ‘as-received’ MWNTs. Incorporation of MWNTs in various polymer matrices has been exploited as a strategy to obtain electrically conducting composites with superior mechanical and thermal properties. CNTs pose issues during processing with polymer matrices, arising from ‘agglomeration’ and ‘entanglement’ of MWNTs, ‘slippage’ of nanotubes during deformation and, poor polymer/MWNTs interfacial interaction. It is therefore a challenging task to achieve a uniform dispersion of MWNTs in a polymer matrix through melt-mixing technique. In order to uniformly disperse MWNTs in immiscible polymer blends, {{it is necessary to}} enhance the extent of ‘debundling’ of MWNTs and selectively localize the MWNTs in one of the phases or at the interface. It is difficult to determine the state of dispersion of MWNTs in polymer matrices using a single characterization technique. Hence, the investigation of dispersion has been carried out at various length scales in order to study the overall state of dispersion of MWNTs in the polymer blend of polyamide 6 (PA 6) and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene copolymer (ABS) with the help of novel organic non-covalent modifiers in combination with a suitable reactive compatibilizer.
