5000|$|One {{reason for}} an {{efficiency}} drop {{is because the}} design and/or implementation of the heating system gives return water (heat transfer fluid) temperatures at the boiler of over 55°C (131°F), which prevents significant condensation in the heat exchanger. Better education of both installers and owners {{could be expected to}} raise efficiency towards the reported laboratory values. Natural Resources Canada also suggests ways to make better use of these boilers, such as combining space and water heating systems. Some boilers (e.g. Potterton) can be switched between two flow temperatures such as 63°C (145°F) and 84°C (183°F), only the former being [...] "fully condensing." [...] However, boilers are normally installed with higher <b>flow</b> <b>temperature</b> by default because a domestic hot water cylinder is generally heated to 60°C (140°F), and this takes too long to achieve with a <b>flow</b> <b>temperature</b> only three degrees higher. Nevertheless, even partial condensing is more efficient than a traditional boiler.|$|E

50|$|Combined forced {{convection}} and natural convection, or mixed convection, occurs when natural convection and {{forced convection}} mechanisms act together to transfer heat. This is also defined as situations where both pressure forces and buoyant forces interact. How much each form of convection {{contributes to the}} heat transfer is largely determined by the <b>flow,</b> <b>temperature,</b> geometry, and orientation. The nature of the fluid is also influential, since the Grashof constant increases in a fluid as temperature increases, but is maximized at some point for a gas.|$|E

30|$|The Joule–Thomson (JT) phenomenon, {{the study}} of fluid {{temperature}} changes for a given pressure change at constant enthalpy, has great technological and scientific importance for designing, maintenance and prediction of hydrocarbon production. The phenomenon serves vital role in many facets of hydrocarbon production, especially associated with reservoir management such as interpretation of temperature logs of production and injection well, identification of water and gas entry locations in multilayer production scenarios, modelling of thermal response of hydrocarbon reservoirs and prediction of wellbore <b>flowing</b> <b>temperature</b> profile. The {{purpose of this study}} is to develop a new method for the evaluation of JT coefficient, as an essential parameter required to account the Joule–Thomson effects while predicting the <b>flowing</b> <b>temperature</b> profile for gas production wells. To do this, a new correction factor, C NM, has been developed through numerical analysis and proposed a practical method to predict C NM which can simplify the prediction of <b>flowing</b> <b>temperature</b> for gas production wells while accounting the Joule–Thomson effect. The developed correlation and methodology were validated through an exhaustive survey which has been conducted with 20 different gas mixture samples. For each sample, the model has been run for a wide range of temperature and pressure conditions, and the model was rigorously verified by comparison of the results estimated throughout the study with the results obtained from HYSYS and Peng–Robinson equation of state. It is observed that model is very simple and robust yet can accurately predict the Joule–Thomson effect.|$|R
50|$|MPC models {{predict the}} change in the {{dependent}} variables of the modeled system that will be caused by changes in the independent variables. In a chemical process, independent variables that can be adjusted by the controller are often either the setpoints of regulatory PID controllers (pressure, <b>flow,</b> <b>temperature,</b> etc.) or the final control element (valves, dampers, etc.). Independent variables that cannot be adjusted by the controller are used as disturbances. Dependent variables in these processes are other measurements that represent either control objectives or process constraints.|$|E

40|$|International audienceDuring {{manufacturing}} processes, thermoplastic polymers can {{be subjected}} to extensive stretching above their glass transition temperature but below their <b>flowing</b> <b>temperature.</b> Examples {{can be found in}} thermoforming and injection stretch blow molding of bottles. To improve the manufacturing techniques, a good understanding of the material behavior from its flow state to its solid state is determinant. Many thermomechanical approaches have been proposed by different authors to catch the material response for amorphous polymers. However, those models don’t describe the material behavior at temperatures higher than the glass transition temperature. To overcome this limitation, we study the material mechanical response under tensile loading at low strain (linear viscoelastic region) and at high strain in the range of temperatures of interest. The main purpose of this work is to understand and to model the mechanical behavior of amorphous polymers from their glass transition temperature up to their <b>flowing</b> <b>temperature</b> accounting the microstructural evolution in the material...|$|R

5000|$|Isothermal flow is a {{model of}} {{compressible}} fluid flow whereby the flow remains at the same temperature while flowing in a conduit.

50|$|The {{hatchery}} {{production of}} shellfish also involves a crucial settling phase where free-swimming larvae settle {{out of the}} water onto a substrate and undergo metamorphosis if suitable conditions are found.

Settlement behaviour is governed by a range of cues including substrate type, water <b>flow,</b> <b>temperature,</b> and the presence of chemical cues indicating the presence of adults, or a food source etc. Hatchery facilities therefore need to understand these cues to induce settlement and also be able to substitute artificial substrates to allow for easy handling and transportation with minimal mortality.|$|E
