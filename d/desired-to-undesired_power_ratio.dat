40|$|Ultra {{wideband}} (UWB) automotive radars {{have attracted}} {{attention from the}} viewpoint of reducing traffic accidents. The performance of automotive radars may be degraded by interference from nearby radars using the same frequency. In this study, a scenario where two cars pass each other on a road was considered. Considering the utilization of cross-polarization, the <b>desired-to-undesired</b> signal <b>power</b> <b>ratio</b> (DUR) was found to vary approximately from - 10 to 30 dB. Different pseudo random sequences were employed for spectrum spreading the different radar signals to mitigate the interference effects. This paper evaluates the interference suppression provided by maximum length sequence (MLS) and Gold sequence (GS) through numerical simulations of the radar’s performance in terms of probability of false alarm and probability of detection. It was found that MLS and GS yielded nearly the same performance when the DUR is - 10 dB (worst case); for example when fixing the probability of false alarm to 0. 0001, the probabilities of detection were 0. 964 and 0. 946 respectively. The GS are more advantageous than MLS due to larger number of different sequences having the same length in GS than in MLS...|$|R

The proposed network structure consists of a set of λ/ 4 planar transmission lines at the design frequency and does not require any isolating resistor. The power divider is capable of providing various <b>power</b> <b>ratios</b> by judicious choice of the transmission lines characteristic impedances. Design equations are derived for arbitrary <b>power</b> <b>ratios.</b> Simulation results obtained from the ADS software proved the possibility of achieving preset <b>power</b> <b>ratios</b> with fairly linear phase response over a certain bandwidth.

METHODS: Percentage ionization curve was measured at SSD= 95 cm using 10 x 10 standard cone and 6, 8, 10, 12, 15 and 18 MeV electron energies. Stopping <b>power</b> <b>ratios</b> at each depth were determined as recommended by the three protocols. %DD curves were then found and compared.

Simulations are done in a typical 130 &#x 2009;nm CMOS technology. Based on the simulation results, the static power consumption is estimated and compared for different filter architectures. Substantial power reductions are shown in both FIR-filters and IIR-filters. Three different types of architectures, namely, bit-parallel, digit-serial, and bit-serial structures are used to demonstrate the methodology. The paper also shows that the relative <b>power</b> <b>ratio</b> {{is strongly dependent on}} the used word length; that is, the gain in <b>power</b> <b>ratio</b> is larger for longer word lengths. A static <b>power</b> <b>ratio</b> at 0. 48 is shown for the bit-serial FIR-filter and a <b>power</b> <b>ratio</b> at 0. 11 is shown in the arithmetic part of the FIR-filter.

40|$|A polarity-coincidence {{detector}} with biased polarity indicators (biased hard limiters) is {{studied to}} determine the effects of the bias on the detector output mean value, output variance, and output signal-to-noise <b>power</b> <b>ratio.</b> The mean value of the detector output is derived for the case of Gaussian input signal and Gaussian input noise, with arbitrary spectra for the signal and noise. The mean value is expressed as a function of the input signal-to-noise <b>power</b> <b>ratio,</b> and as a function of the biases in the input channel and the reference channel polarity indicators. It is shown that the effect of bias is to introduce a spurious component in the output mean value. The variance of the defector output is derived for the cage of Gaussian input signal and Gaussian input noise, with RC low-pass spectra for signal and noise, for small input signal-to-noise <b>power</b> <b>ratios</b> only. The variance is expressed as a function of the biases in the input channel and reference channel polarity indicators, and as a function of the input signal-to-noise band-width radio. It is shown that the effect of bias is to introduce a spurious component in the output variance. The output signal-to-noise <b>power</b> <b>ratio</b> (the square of the output mean divided by the output variance) is derived for both an ideal polarity-coincidence detector (no bias) and for a biased polarity-coincidence detector. The output signal-to-noise <b>power</b> <b>ratio</b> is expressed as a function of the input signal-to-noise <b>power</b> <b>ratio,</b> the biases in the input channel and the reference channel polarity indicators, and input signal-to-noise band-width ratio, for small input signal-to-noise <b>power</b> <b>ratios</b> only. It is shown that the output signal-to-noise <b>power</b> <b>ratio</b> of an ideal polarity-coincidence detector is degraded from that of a correlation detector. When the input signal-to-noise band-width ratio is unity, the degradation is about 1. 4 db. The degradation increases to about 2. 2 db. when the input signal-to noise band-width ratio becomes either very small or very large. It is also shown that the output signal-to-noise <b>power</b> <b>ratio</b> of a biased polarity-coincidence detector is degraded from that of an ideal polarity-coincidence detector. A simple expression for the degradation is presented. Limits on the biases are given, such that when the biases are smaller than these limits, the degradation of the output signal-to-noise <b>power</b> <b>ratio</b> is negligible...|$|R

We attempt to establish quantitative EEG parameters that are suitable for evaluating AD in clinical practice. Methods: Ninety-five patients with newly diagnosed AD at different stages from four neurologic institutes were enrolled for the study. Standard scalp resting EEG data were collected for quantitative analysis. Global band <b>power</b> <b>ratio</b> and interhemispheric alpha band coherence were calculated. Results: Patients with advanced AD had a greater slow-to-fast wave <b>power</b> <b>ratio.</b> Among several <b>power</b> <b>ratio</b> parameters, global theta and delta to alpha and beta band <b>power</b> <b>ratio</b> showed the best correlation with stages of AD (p <  0. 05 between any two patient groups).

Conclusion: Increased global slow-to-fast <b>power</b> <b>ratio</b> and decreased centroparietal interhemispheric alpha band coherence are strongly correlated with disease progress in AD patients. These two quantitative EEG parameters may help evaluate AD patients in daily clinical practice. Global <b>power</b> <b>ratio</b> changes may suggest a shift of dominant frequency, and decreased interhemispheric alpha band coherence may suggest functional disconnection and corpus callosum abnormalities in AD patients...|$|R
