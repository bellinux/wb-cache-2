5|$|Summer of '42 is a 1971 American coming-of-age comedy-drama film {{based on}} the memoirs of screenwriter Herman Raucher. It {{tells the story of}} how Raucher, in his early teens on his 1942 summer {{vacation}} on Nantucket Island (off the coast of Cape Cod), embarks on a one-sided romance with a young woman, Dorothy, whose husband has <b>gone</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> fight in World War II.|$|E
5|$|On 4 March 1941, Pattle claimed three enemy Fiat G.50bis fighters (nos 22–24) {{belonging}} to 24oGruppo. He claimed the first, while Nigel Cullen — another leading fighter ace — flew as his wingman. Escorting Blenheims to attack Italian warships, the pair were engaged by a lone G.50. Pattle engaged the Fiat and shot it down — its landing gear dropped {{down and it}} rolled over and into a mountainside just north of Himare. Pattle searched for Cullen, expecting him to be behind him but saw {{no sign of the}} Australian. He assumed Cullen had <b>gone</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> scout for more enemy aircraft after missing out on Pattle's victory. Now alone, he was attacked by another lone G.50bis while flying towards Vlorë. After a brief combat, he shot down the Fiat. It crashed into the sea southwest of Vlorë harbour. He then became involved with a third such fighter over Valona harbour and claimed to have shot this down into the sea in flames {{on the west side of}} the promontory. After his return to base, he was informed Cullen had been posted missing in action. Pattle and the squadron considered he had most likely been shot down and killed.|$|E
25|$|This book {{is about}} four {{children}} whose names were Ann, Martin, Rose and Peter. But it is most about Peter who was the youngest. They all had to go away from London suddenly because of Air Raids, and because Father, {{who was in the}} Army, had <b>gone</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> the War and Mother was doing some kind of war work. They were sent to stay with a kind of relation of Mother's who was a very old professor who lived all by himself in the country.|$|E

25|$|Tom van Vollenhoven the brush-cut wing who {{appeared}} on the scene in 1955, was the kind of player who captured the imagination every time he touched the ball. His try for the Light Blues against the Junior Springboks in 1955, when he beat one player after another in spectacular a zigzag run of almost 80 metres, is still lauded as the try of all tries. This got him into the Springbok side against the 1955 British Lions of Robin Thomson and in the second test scored a hat trick of tries. He would probably {{have been one of the}} greatest heroes if he had not <b>gone</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> play professional rugby league in England so early in his career.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} part of Impington to be inhabited is {{near the}} junction of Cambridge Road and Arbury Road. In this location {{there is a large}} ancient settlement - thought to have been built by the Ancient Britons. The settlement was taken over by the Romans when they invaded Britain. There are several roads in Impington that are thought to be based on Roman roads. The Parish is likely to date from about the sixth century. At this time a Saxon tribe called the Empings lived there. Over time dukes have <b>gone</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> help prevent the Danes from invading, William the 1st took interest and sorted out an argument over the town (then 'Epintone') between the Norman Sheriff of Cambridge and the church.|$|E
25|$|In spring 324 BC Hephaestion left Susa, {{where he}} had been married, and {{accompanied}} Alexander {{and the rest of the}} army as they travelled towards Ecbatana. They arrived in the autumn and it was there, during games and festivals, that Hephaestion fell ill with a fever. Arrian says that after the fever had run for seven days, Alexander had to be summoned from the games to Hephaestion, who was seriously ill. He did not arrive in time; by the time he got there, Hephaestion was dead. Plutarch says that being a young man and a soldier, Hephaestion had ignored medical advice and as soon as his doctor, Glaucias, had <b>gone</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> the theatre, he ate a large breakfast consisting of a boiled fowl and a cooler of wine, and then fell sick and died.|$|E

25|$|Middlesex Crusaders {{defeated}} Essex Eagles despite missing Irish batsman Ed Joyce, who had <b>gone</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> {{play in the}} 2005 ICC Trophy. The opening {{partnership between}} Owais Shah and Ed Smith yielded 100 runs, Shah eventually making 79, and despite three wickets from Essex off-spinner James Middlebrook, Middlesex finished on 185 for 6 as Irfan Pathan hit two sixes to end with 21. Pathan then took three wickets inside 20 minutes, those of Alistair Cook, Ronnie Irani and Ravinder Bopara, and Essex were 45 for 5. James Foster made 62 not out at just the rate required to win, but Andre Adams could only hit at 7.5 an over as Essex finished on 154 for 7, 32 short of victory. Pathan had Adams caught near the end to finish with four for 27.|$|E
25|$|December 1808. Its new {{commander}} General Pedro de Alcántara Álvarez de Toledo, 13th Duke of the Infantado {{allowed his}} soldiers to rest but {{was forced to}} execute three soldiers. One, a lieutenant had refused to march and positioned his artillery battery to fire on the troops who were obeying orders. The remnant of the 1st Division was sent home to Valencia province to recruit, while the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Divisions were reorganized into four divisions including a Vanguard and a Reserve. Many low-strength line regiments were consolidated from three battalions into one or two. Stragglers and reinforcements swelled the ranks. The soldiers' spirits rose when a brigade under General Conde de Alacha Lilli marched into camp, having escaped from Napoleon's armies. Hearing that the emperor had <b>gone</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> the north, Infantado decided to launch an offensive toward Madrid before his reorganization was completed.|$|E

Too impatient, Colbert and Stewart then decided to walk across the hall and finally end the fight on O'Brien's set. However, the door {{supposedly}} leading to O'Brien's set was locked, leaving Colbert and Stewart no other choice but to use forced entry—via a bobby pin. [...] A later interview with O'Brien revealed further information of how Stewart and Colbert were able to slip through security: ...|$|E

500|$|In 2006, Laurie Olin {{said the}} Halprin's Portland {{sequence}} was [...] "a huge influence on even becoming a landscape architect. I had <b>gone</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> Europe and saw them published there. They {{had to do}} with representation and meaning but also had an exuberance. They are landmark pieces. When Ada Louis Huxtable wrote in The New York Times that Forecourt Fountain (in front of Keller Auditorium) was the greatest civic fountain since the Renaissance, I knew she was right. They were also transformative for the field of landscape architecture, not all for the best, because {{there were a lot of}} bad copies and wannabes".|$|E
2500|$|Ole B. Budsberg, {{an elderly}} widower from Iola, Wisconsin, {{appeared}} next. He {{was last seen}} alive at the La Porte Savings Bank on April 6, 1907, when he mortgaged his Wisconsin land there, signing over a deed and obtaining several thousand dollars in cash. [...] Ole B. Budsberg's sons, Oscar and Mathew Budsberg, {{had no idea that}} their father had <b>gone</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> visit Gunness.

They also try to see Major Eustace and hear that he has <b>gone</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> play golf. [...] Mention of this suddenly makes Poirot see everything clearly. Managing to get hold of Eustace later on, they notice that he smokes a brand of Turkish cigarette whose stubs were found in the mews house, even though Mrs Allen smoked a different kind. They also prove that he wore a set of cufflinks, a damaged part of which was found in the room where Mrs Allen died and Japp arrests him for murder.|$|E

2500|$|The {{legacy of}} the codex {{is based on the}} life and death of Saint Boniface who, in 753, had <b>gone</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> Friesland one more time to try and convert the Frisians. On the morning of June 5, 754, Boniface, camping in the Frisian {{countryside}} with 50 or so comrades, was getting ready to accept new converts, when the camp was overrun by pagan bandits who killed all the missionaries and destroyed their possessions. While the earliest hagiographical accounts of Boniface and his martyrdom had him order his comrades to lay down their arms and accept martyrdom willingly, later accounts added that he held a book over his head to protect himself—this is what Boniface scholar Lutz von Padberg calls the Schutzhypothese, the [...] "protection hypothesis", and it has become an enduring image of the saint.|$|E
2500|$|At this point, {{the novel}} moves more quickly, giving {{highlights}} covering the period {{leading up to}} the sequel, Lonesome Dove. [...] Maggie gives birth to Call's son Newt, but Call refuses to acknowledge the child is his. [...] She goes to work at the general store, and Jake Spoon more or less moves in with her. [...] The Civil War takes most of the soldiers away from the frontier, enabling the Comanches to push back the white settlers. [...] After the Civil War, Call and McCrae are sent in pursuit of Blue Duck and his band of renegades. Buffalo Hump has <b>gone</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> die. [...] Blue Duck hears of this and leaves his cutthroats to pursue his father. The Rangers attack his band, but Blue Duck, having left, evades capture. [...] He finds his father at his chosen place of death and kills him there. Maggie dies while the Rangers are on this expedition.|$|E
2500|$|Still {{keeping his}} options open, Fripp left The League of Gentlemen in 1965 {{in order to}} study for A-levels at Bournemouth College, where he studied {{economic}}s, economic history and political history, writing a special paper on social conditions of the mid-to-late 19th century; it was there where he met future musical colleagues John Wetton, Richard Palmer-James and Greg Lake. He subsequently spent three further years playing light jazz in the Majestic Dance Orchestra at the Bournemouth Majestic Hotel (replacing future The Police guitarist Andy Summers, who had <b>gone</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> London with Zoot Money). At age 21, going back home from college late at night, Fripp tuned on to Radio Luxemburg where he heard the last moments of [...] "A Day in the Life". [...] "Galvanized" [...] by the experience, {{he went on to}} listen to Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Béla Bartók's string quartets, Antonín Dvořák's New World Symphony, Are You Experienced and John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers. Many years later, Fripp would recall that [...] "although all the dialects are different, the voice was the same... I knew I couldn't say no".|$|E
