6000|$|Well, now, I want <b>to</b> ask <b>you</b> a question. I daresay {{there are}} some of you who do not like this or that {{particular}} point in the Budget, who do not like some particular argument or phrase which some of us may have used in advocating or defending it. But it is not of these details that I speak; the question I want each of <b>you</b> <b>to</b> ask himself is this: On which side of this great battle which I have described <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> does the <b>Budget</b> count? Can any of you, looking at it broadly and as a whole, looking on the policy which surrounds it, and which depends upon it, looking at the arguments by which it is defended, as well as the arguments by which it is opposed--can any one doubt that the Budget in its essential character and meaning, in its spirit and in its practical effect, would be a tremendous reinforcement, almost like a new army coming {{up at the end of}} the day, upon the side of all those forces and influences which are fighting for the life and health and progress of our race? ...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the association of}} ED length of stay (EDLOS) and outcome of patients admitted to a ward, intensive care (ICU) or stepdown (high dependency) unit (SDU). METHODS: DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using linked administrative and clinical data. SETTING: 650 -bed, university-affiliated, tertiary referral hospital, whose ED has approximately 60 [*] 000 patient presentations per annum. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients admitted via the <b>ED,</b> <b>to</b> a ward (<b>ED</b> <b>to</b> ward), ICU (<b>ED</b> <b>to</b> ICU) or SDU (<b>ED</b> <b>to</b> SDU), and whose EDLOS was < 24 [*]h. OUTCOME MEASURES: Hospital outcome and LOS. RESULTS: A total of 43 [*] 484 patients over 4 years. Median EDLOS was 2 : 36 [*]h for ICU, 5 : 07 [*]h for SDU and 7 : 19 [*]h for ward (P < 0. 01) patients. EDLOS differed significantly, based on hospital outcome, for ward (alive, 7 : 18 [*]h vs died, 7 : 44 [*]h, P < 0. 001), but not SDU or ICU patients. At an EDLOS of 4 and 8 [*]h, 19. 4 % and 5. 2 % of ICU, 52. 1 % and 15. 5 % of SDU and 77. 9 % and 32. 6 % of ward patients remained in the ED. EDLOS {{was not a significant}} predictor of death, in comparison with increasing age and admitting unit across all three groups, and higher triage acuity for <b>ED</b> <b>to</b> ward and <b>ED</b> <b>to</b> ICU. CONCLUSIONS: EDLOS was greater for <b>ED</b> <b>to</b> ward patients, and of the <b>ED</b> <b>to</b> ward patients who died. At an EDLOS of 4 [*]h there were fewer ICU, in comparison with ward, patients remaining in the ED. Future studies that report on EDLOS should differentiate for patients admitted from the <b>ED</b> <b>to</b> the ward, ICU or SDU.

40|$|I hereby submit <b>to</b> <b>you</b> my {{proposed}} <b>Budget</b> for 2011 ‑ 12. This Budget {{proposes a}} far‑reaching realignment of government functions by restoring to local government {{authority to make}} decisions that are best made closer to the people, not in Sacramento. My plan also envisions reorganizing state government {{to make it more}} efficient and save scarce tax dollars by consolidating or eliminating functions. Since it will take some time to fully implement these changes, I propose to ask the voters for a five‑year extension of several current taxes so that we can restructure in an orderly manner with minimal disruption. If we make the tough decisions now and put our accounts in order, we will again make California the national leader in job creation as our nation slowly recovers from the current recession. We begin 2011, after the longest budget stalemate in the history of California, with a budget gap of more than $ 25 billion. Short‑term measures and gimmicks adopted in recent years did not solve our problem and in fact made it worse. This Budget closes our short‑term budget gap and also eliminates projected future deficits. The Budget focuses on the core functions of government and maintains essential services. Nowhere is this more important than in our public schools, which have taken big cuts in recent years. Along with responsibilities returned to local government through the proposed realignment, the Budget provide...|$|R

Whole VM tissue DA, NA, and A contents increased with advancing age. VRI DA/protein increased from <b>ED</b> 15 <b>to</b> <b>ED</b> 16, whereas NA/protein increased from <b>ED</b> 15 <b>to</b> <b>ED</b> 16 and from <b>ED</b> 20 <b>to</b> P 4. VM DA/NA ratio increased from <b>ED</b> 14 <b>to</b> <b>ED</b> 15 and decreased from <b>ED</b> 18 <b>to</b> P 4. VM cell suspensions exhibited higher DA/NA ratios than whole VM tissue. Washed cell suspensions had higher DA/NA than unwashed counterparts. We conclude that data from both VM immunohistochemistry and catecholamine assays relate to VRI development. VM DA is contained mainly in cells, whereas VRI NA is located in fibers that channel at the dorsal side of the VM. Determination of tissue catecholamine contents may be helpful for the biochemical characterization of tentatively identified VM grafts. (C) 1997 Academic Press...|$|R

40|$|Introduction We {{aimed to}} assess the current scope of handoff {{education}} and practice among resident physicians in academic centers, and to propose a standardized handoff algorithm for the transition of care from the emergency department (<b>ED)</b> <b>to</b> an inpatient setting.   Methods This was a cross-sectional survey targeted at emergency medicine residency programs in the United States (US). The Web-based survey consisted of multiple choice, completion, and Likert scale items and was distributed to potential subjects through a listserv. A panel of experts used a modified Delphi approach to develop a standardized algorithm for <b>ED</b> <b>to</b> inpatient handoff.   Results 121 of 172 allopathic and osteopathic programs responded to the survey, for an overall response rate of 70. 3 %. Our survey showed that most EM programs in the US {{have some form of}} handoff training, and the majority of them occur either during orientation or in the clinical setting. The handoff structure from <b>ED</b> <b>to</b> inpatient is not well standardized, and in those places with a formalized handoff system over seventy percent of residents do not uniformly follow it. Approximately half of responding programs felt that their current handoff system was safe and effective. About half of the programs did not formally assess handoff proficiency of trainees.   Handoffs most commonly take place over the phone, though respondents disagreed about the ideal place for a handoff to occur with nearly equivalent responses between programs favoring the bedside, over the phone, or face to face at a computer station. Approximately 2 / 3 of responding programs reported that their residents were competent in performing <b>ED</b> <b>to</b> inpatient handoffs. Based on this survey and review of the literature, we developed a five-step algorithm for the transition of care from the <b>ED</b> <b>to</b> an inpatient setting.   ConclusionOur results identified current trends of education and practice in transitions of care from the <b>ED</b> <b>to</b> inpatient setting among US academic medical centers. An algorithm to guide this process is proposed to address the current gap in a standardized approach <b>to</b> <b>ED</b> <b>to</b> inpatient handoffs identified from the surveyed needs assessment...|$|R
