Beamish {{promoted}} Finucane instantly {{to the rank of}} squadron leader. Beamish had flown in the Battle of Britain and was posted to Group Captain Operations headquarters at 11 Group in 1941. Beamish frequently asked for an operational command and eventually Leigh-Mallory relented and gave him Redhill. Beamish was ordered not to fly on operations but usually flew whenever he <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>it.</b> Beamish was killed on operations just two months later. Finucane observed 602's Glasgow traditions by reviving the squadron badge which pictured the Scottish lion rampant in red.|$|E

25|$|I think no, it {{has been}} too long. If they {{would have made it}} to a million in like 2 months, then they would have had something. They even got {{sponsored}} by that gum factory. I <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>it's</b> three years later, forget it. I also felt that people signed numerous times on the petition so it is probably only like 150,000 people that actually signed it.|$|R

500|$|... "When Whitney {{first heard}} the song, she figured I'd lost it—I couldn't come up with words anymore. And, {{actually}} she's right. I couldn't think of anything for that particular part. It <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> should groove there. But I knew it couldn't groove without any vocals, so I started humming along with it and that's what happened. The 'shoops' came. But they felt so good, I thought 'Why not?' It doesn't have to mean anything." ...|$|E

500|$|Hensleigh's {{directing}} was criticized. Scott Tobias {{said the}} directing [...] "doesn’t do much beyond {{filling in the}} template". He noted that Hensleigh was telling the [...] "true-life tale" [...] of the mob's decline in Cleveland, but also said that [...] "every character and setpiece <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> fell off a truck". LA Weeklys Nick Pinkerton held similar views, saying that although [...] "Hensleigh perks up when filming violence, the atmosphere throughout is past-prime, stymieing any strut".

500|$|In {{his memoir}} , Dylan {{described}} the kinship he felt with the route that supplied {{the title of}} his sixth album: [...] "Highway 61, the main thoroughfare of the country blues, begins about where I began. I always felt like I'd started on it, always had been on it and could go anywhere, even down in to the deep Delta country. It was the same road, full of the same contradictions, the same one-horse towns, the same spiritual ancestors... It was my place in the universe, always <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> was in my blood." ...|$|E

The new songs will be influenced by hip-hop, while retaining effortless Swedish pop melodies. “With the first two albums, we didn’t tell people what the songs were about, because we wanted the audiences to have their own story for what they could be about, but ever since then, we’ve <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>it’s</b> really important for us to tell people what we think in a different way,” Gustafsson said about Urban Cone’s new sound.|$|R
5000|$|Glenn Diaz from BuddyTV opinionated, [...] "While {{the episode}} {{featured}} Gibbs and Vance heavily, {{it was probably}} Ducky who did the most significant progress on Ziva." [...] Steve Marsi from TV Fanatic wrote, [...] "For the past two episodes NCIS, while always superb, has <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>it's</b> delaying the inevitable. Ziva was there, yet only in body, not in spirit. Her mind was somewhere else...The 20,000-ton {{elephant in the room}} - the cargo ship that brought Ziva to (and went down off) the Horn of Africa, was recovered, as was a dead marine who was on board." ...|$|R

Jazz said [...] "There was talk about the Clash reforming before he died. But there had been talk for years and years about them reforming. They had been offered stupid amounts of money to do it, but they were very good at keeping the moral high ground and saying no. But I think if Dad hadn't died, it would have happened.

500|$|Ruby Messer Barber {{had this}} to say about joining the WAVES, [...] "It was a choice of adventure. I didn't have any brothers, and I thought that's {{something}} I can do, one way I can make a contribution. My sisters thought it was great, but they were not interested. There was too much discipline and routine involved. I <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> would be a challenge, to step forth and do it, to see what it was all about. It gave a sense of confidence.
