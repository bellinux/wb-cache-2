2500|$|Power was {{supplied}} in three-phase form at 480 VAC {{through three}} conductor strips on the guideway wall. Below the conductors {{was a common}} ground, and above it was an <b>inductive</b> <b>loop</b> used for signalling. Mechanical [...] "feelers" [...] extending {{from the corners of}} the vehicle with brushes on their ends engaged the conductors. Power was rectified and fed into a DC motor, which was attached to a conventional differential and then to the wheels at one end. The motor was bi-directional and was switched depending on the vehicle's direction of travel.|$|E
2500|$|Originally the DLR used {{signalling}} {{based on}} a fixed-block technology developed by GEC-General Signal and General Railway Signal. This was replaced in 1994 with a moving-block TBTC (Transmission Based Train Control) system developed by Alcatel, called SelTrac. The SelTrac system was bought by Thales in 2007 and updates are provided by Thales Rail Signalling Solutions. The same technology is used by rapid transit systems including Vancouver's SkyTrain, Toronto's SRT, San Francisco's Municipal Railway (MUNI) and Hong Kong's MTR. The SelTrac S40 system has also been adopted by the London Underground Jubilee line and Northern line. Transmissions occur via an <b>inductive</b> <b>loop</b> cable between each train's Vehicle On-Board Controller (VOBC) and the control centre (VCC, SMC) at Beckton. If this link is broken and communication is lost between the VOBC and VCC, SMC, the train stops until it is authorised to move again. If the whole system fails the train can run in restricted manual at [...] for safety until the system is restored and communication is re-established. Emergency brakes can be applied if the train breaks the speed limit during manual control or overshoots a fixed stopping point, or if it leaves the station when the route has not been set.|$|E

50|$|Correction: It wasn't 'leaky feeder' for the 999 kHz operation, but the {{standard}} <b>inductive</b> <b>loop</b> system, which was {{the standard}} magnetic system available to student and hospital radio at the time. This offered reception on the campus, but beyond the boundary the signal fell away quickly, minimising the chances of off-site reception. This consisted of a WW audio processor/transmitter in the studio in Norwich House, from which underground cables extended out towards Park Village, and then on around the other areas of accommodation. Every so often the cable fed a tuned <b>inductive</b> <b>loop</b> 'aerial' which was mounted onto the wall {{of one of the}} buildings. A few of the larger blocks (e.g. Yorks and Lancs) had 'loops' on the roofs, which probably weren't truly inductive, and hence might have radiated the signal further than intended.|$|E

40|$|Bicycling {{and walking}} have gained {{increased}} attention recently; however, systematic bicycle and pedestrian counts are still scarce. At intersections, transportation agencies are interested in counting bicycles and pedestrians and leveraging for counting purposes, if possible, existing signal detection equipment. This study evaluated four counting technologies: <b>inductive</b> <b>loops</b> and a thermal camera to count bicycles and passive infrared counters and pedestrian signal actuation data to count pedestrians. The four technologies were tested {{in a parking lot}} (controlled environment) and in an intersection (real-world environment). The findings revealed that while the <b>inductive</b> <b>loops</b> and thermal camera counted bicycles accurately in a controlled environment, the loops and cameras failed to do so at an intersection. Passive infrared counters were found to count pedestrians accurately at the intersection sidewalk, and pedestrian signal actuation data could be a cost-effective surrogate for pedestrian demand at signalized intersections...|$|R
