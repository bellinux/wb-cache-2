5|$|Carre's is a state-run {{selective}} grammar school. It {{converted to}} an Academy and reopened on 1 August 2011; it {{is governed by}} Carre's Grammar School Academy Trust and converted without sponsorship. As of 2015, the student body {{is made up of}} 815 pupils aged 11–18. The school admits boys on a selective basis for years 7–11 and has a co-educational Sixth Form; there are 60 <b>girls</b> <b>on</b> roll as of 2015. The majority of pupils come from White British backgrounds and very few pupils speak English as an additional language. The number of pupils supported through allowances, including those eligible for free school meals (2.3%), is below average, as is the number of students with learning disabilities. Pupils are allocated into houses based on their forms. The first house system at Carre's consisted of four sets: scarlet, maroon, green and blue. They became houses in 1933 as Carre, Bristol, Lafford and Welby, named respectively after its founder, the Earls of Bristol, an old name for Sleaford, and Richard Welby, who owned the Gedney lands purchased by Carre.|$|E
5|$|In a Year 3 {{elementary}} {{classroom in}} South Wales a teacher was having difficulty keeping three <b>girls</b> <b>on</b> task during designated private study times. The teacher reached for aid from behavior analysts, and a delayed gratification behavior modification plan {{was put into}} place. The study gave limits on the amounts of questions the children could ask, {{and if they did}} not exceed the limit, they were given tokens for rewards. The token economy for rewards is an example of delayed gratification, by way of cool processing. Instead of having the girls focus on attention-seeking behaviors that distracted the teacher and the students, the teacher had them focus on how many questions they had, and if they needed to ask for help from the teacher. They also focused on gaining tokens rather than focusing on the final reward, which increased their delays. By giving the children this goal and the promise of positive reinforcement for good behavior, the girls dropped their rate of question-asking and attention-seeking.|$|E

5|$|The Crosthwaite Free Grammar School, {{adjoining}} Crosthwaite churchyard, was {{an ancient}} institution, its date of foundation uncertain. In 1819 the parish of Crosthwaite had {{five or six}} schools in {{the town and the}} outlying areas, with a total of 332 children. By 1833 Keswick had twelve daily schools, including a new National School at High Hill. The new parish church of Keswick, St John's, started educational work in 1840 with a Sunday school which also educated infant boys, and later <b>girls,</b> <b>on</b> weekdays. A full-time boys' school opened in 1853. For older pupils, Keswick School, the free co-educational grammar school, successor to the Crosthwaite Free Grammar School, opened at a site diagonally opposite Greta Bridge in 1898. In 1951 a new secondary modern school was built at Lairthwaite in Underskiddaw.|$|E
5|$|The {{kidnapping}} of Jaycee Dugard occurred on June 10, 1991, south of South Lake Tahoe, California. Dugard was 11 {{years old at}} the time and was abducted from a street while she was walking from home to a school bus stop. Searches began immediately after her disappearance, but no reliable leads were generated despite the fact that her stepfather, Carl Probyn, witnessed her kidnapping and chased the kidnappers on his mountain bike. Dugard remained missing until 2009, when a convicted sex offender, Phillip Garrido, visited the University of California campus in Berkeley accompanied by two young <b>girls</b> <b>on</b> August 24 and 25 that same year. The unusual behavior of the trio sparked an investigation that led Garrido's parole officer to order him to take the two girls to a parole office in Concord, California, on August 26. He was accompanied by a woman who was successfully identified as Jaycee Dugard who was by then 29 years old.|$|E

5|$|Before season 20, {{little was}} shown {{concerning}} Cartman's romantic interests, {{as for the}} most part, his attitude towards females had been sexist. However, at least in one episode ("Chef Goes Nanners"), Cartman develops an attraction to Wendy, which is apparent {{from the end of}} episode when Wendy describes her temporary infatuation towards Cartman as 'sexual tension' and even though Cartman agrees in front of Wendy, he sighs with sorrow at being alone again. During a period when he was physically unable to control his speech and he repeatedly blurted hidden feelings, he expressed a romantic interest in classmate Patty Nelson, a side character who has not been seen before or since. In Season 20, after Cartman is wrongfully accused of being a persistent and highly aggressive internet troll (actually Gerald Broflovski) leaving foul posts primarily targeting women and <b>girls</b> <b>on</b> South Park Elementary's school message boards, the other boys destroy most of Cartman's electronics, and by extension, his social media presence, causing him to become despondent to everything around him. That is until Heidi Turner, who had quit social media in response to the trolling, offers to show him life outside of social media. The two quickly become friends, and later, an official and shockingly very happy couple.|$|E
